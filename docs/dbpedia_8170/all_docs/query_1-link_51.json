These three countries formed an ethnic, linguistic and religious conglomeration which bordered both geographically and culturally with South-Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Their official Christianisation began as early as the 4th century, leaving a lasting mark on the entire region. In the following centuries, it became a well-connected and strategically important buffer zone for Byzantine, Persian, Arab, Turkic, and Mongol powers. And although the borders constantly shifted, the ancient countries of the Southern Caucasus formed a geographical and historical unity that was diverse in itself, yet sharing not only the same history but also common cultural traits. For both Armenians and Georgians, history and culture of their countries are well known through their own languages, which have been written continuously since the 4th century CE. In contrast to this, Caucasian Albania with the peoples inhabiting it, its history and culture and, ultimately, its “disappearance” have remained by and large obscure, due to the scarcity of autochtonous sources. Nevertheless, interest in the ancient state of Caucasian Albania has been revived on a large scale, especially in recent years. After the Second Karabakh War in autumn 2020 and the ceasefire agreed between Armenia, Azerbaijan and the (internationally unrecognised) Republic of Artsakh in November 2020, massive media attention was paid to this historical region and especially to “supposedly” Albanian monuments such as churches and monasteries which are now under the administrative control of Azerbaijan. In particular, the Azerbaijani government and scientists affiliated to it have most intensively promoted a theory which, put simply, relates the history of the Azerbaijanis back to the Albanians, thus putting the state of Azerbaijan on a similar historical footing as Armenia and Georgia which can both demonstrate their millennia-long existence on the basis of textual, archaeological and architectural monuments. The “Albanianising” approach, first put forward by the Soviet-Azerbaijanian historian Ziya Bunyatov in the 1950s and 60s, has now acquired new topicality by being instrumentalised in abnegating the Armenian background of the disputed territory of Karabakh, even though international scholars such as Nora Dudwick and Harun Yilmaz have argued against this theory in several academic publications since the late 1980s, already during the outbreak of the First Karabakh War, and declared it politically motivated, as a form of historical revisionism that is based on nationalist attitudes.

Armenia, in turn, refers to its strong ecclesiastical links with Caucasian Albania which are believed to have brought the country very close to the Armenian culture. However, all this is often built upon distorted, media-spread but not scientifically substantiated ideas about who the “Albanians” really were, and thus on the fact that many things have for long been – and are still being – misinterpreted, willingly or unwillingly, following various hypotheses that are not based on up-to-date, scientifically substantiated facts. Several traditional assumptions, even though outdated and obsolete, are mixed with manipulated narratives and historical claims as well as an inconsiderate and often erroneous exploitation of still understudied, newly discovered material. There are indeed several competing theories about what happened to the Albanians after the Middle Ages, whether they were absorbed into the Armenian, Georgian, Iranian or, lastly, Turkish population of the region. To shed light on this debate, which seems to have been fought mostly on the backs of the Armenians with their long-lasting presence, historically irrefutable, in the disputed region of Karabakh, and on that of the Udi people who are now being talked up as the true successors of the Caucasian Albanians, supported (if not directed) by the Azerbaijanian government in a new post-Soviet “ethnogenesis”, we deemed it overdue to counter the (definitely not harmless) myths on Caucasian Albania that are swirling around today, with scientifically sound and proven facts. For this purpose, a group of internationally acknowledged scholars and distinguished representatives of their scientific fields have agreed to compile the present Handbook, bringing together in a neutral way up-to-date accounts of the historical realities of Caucasian Albania, based on their own research into the textual and archaeological sources available. The Handbook thus reflects the present state of scientific knowledge on ancient medieval Caucasian Albania, including the most recent findings. The interdisciplinary nature of the Handbook, which spans a wide range from historical, linguistic-philological, archaeological, church and art historical up to ethnological and sociological contributions, warrants a comprehensive picture of Caucasian Albania and its inhabitants. It was by no means compiled to support nationalistic or revisionist points of view but aims solely at a clear and neutral, scientific presentation of the existing facts. It is obvious that one or the other piece of the “puzzle” that Caucasian Albania presents is still missing if we intend to provide a complete, truly coherent and yet scientifically sound image. No doubt, much more research needs to be undertaken in this area in order to get rid of insubstantial national, political and territorial disputes and claims. But even now we may underline an important result of this Handbook, which lies so\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\nto say in the heart of the puzzle: it is clear now that Armenians, Georgians, and a multitude of Caucasian and other peoples have lived together on the territory of ancient and medieval Caucasian Albania since Antiquity, leaving their traces in the history, culture and language of Caucasian Albania as one of the ancient states of the Southern Caucasus.\n\nContent and contributors All in all, the Handbook comprises 16 Chapters contributed by 15 different authors. In Chapter 1 (Caucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources), Marco Bais, Faculty member of the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome as an expert of Oriental Ecclesiastical Sciences, evaluates with a special focus on the methodology of historical research the information on Albania and the Albanians that is provided by authors of Classical Antiquity, thus illustrating the oldest witnesses of the country that are known. In Chapter 2 (Caucasian Albania in Medieval Armenian Sources), Jasmine Dum-Tragut, specialist for Armenian studies, linguistics and equine sciences at the Center for the Study of the Christian East, Paris-Lodron University in Salzburg, and Jost Gippert, comparative linguist and Caucasiologist now working at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, University of Hamburg, provide an overview of the historiographical accounts of Albania in Armenian language, covering the period from the 5th to the 13th century; the Chapter largely builds upon previous work by Zaza Aleksidze, who unfortunately did not live to see the present volume published, and Jean-Pierre Mahé, whose readiness to support the Handbook is greatly acknowledged. The following three Chapters are devoted to the written heritage of the Albanian language. In Chapter 3 (The Textual Heritage of Caucasian Albanian), Jost Gippert summarises the present knowledge on the textual remains in Albanian, i.e., the fragments of Bible translation that were found in palimpsest manuscripts with Georgian overwriting in St Catherine’s monastery on Mt Sinai, as well as the few inscriptions that have been detected so far. Chapter 4 (The Language of the Caucasian Albanians), co-authored by Jost Gippert and the late Wolfgang Schulze, up to his untimely decease in April 2020 teaching as a linguist at the universities of Munich and Banská Bystrica and one of the leading specialists of East Caucasian languages, provides a comprehensive description of the Albanian language as preserved in the textual witnesses, taking into account the many amendments that have become possible by the utilisation of new imaging methods in analysing the palimpsests. Chapter 5 (Caucasian Albanian and Modern Udi), again co-authored by Wolfgang Schulze and Jost Gippert, outlines the mutual relationship of the Albanian language and that of the Udi people of today,\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nwhich is regarded as its successor. In an appended Chapter (5A: The Udis’ Petition to Tsar Peter), Igor Dorfmann-Lazarev, historian with a focus on the Caucasus and the ancient Near East, until recently working at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures, University of Hamburg, explains the background of a petition translated by him, which was sent by Udis to Tsar Peter in 1724. The next three Chapters deal in more detail with the Albanian Church and questions of its relation to the surrounding Christian Churches. In Chapter 6 (Albanians, Armenians and Georgians: a Common Liturgy), Charles Renoux OSB, Orientalist formerly of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique and the leading scholar on the Christian rite of Jerusalem, evaluates the liturgical information that is contained in the Albanian palimpsests with regard to their connection with the early Armenian and Georgian lectionaries. In Chapter 7 (One or two? On Christological and Hierarchical Disputes and the Development of the “Church of Albania”), Jasmine Dum-Tragut summarises the knowledge on the interrelation of the Albanian Church with those of the Armenians and the Georgians, illustrating the developments between the 4th and the 8th century along the track of the relevant ecumenical and inner-Caucasian councils. In an appended Chapter (7A: The Holy Covenant), Armenuhi Drost-Abgaryan, Armenologist at the Seminar for the Christian East and Byzantium, University of Halle-Wittenburg, thematises the “Holy Covenant” that was struck up by Armenians, Georgians and Albanians in their common war of defence against Sasanian Iran in the 4th century. In Chapter 8 (Albanians in the Holy Land – Absence of Archaeological Evidence or Evidence of Absence?), Yana Tchekhanovets, archaeologist and specialist for the ancient Near East at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, discusses the question as to whether the Albanians possessed monasteries of their own in Jerusalem and around. Three more Chapters are concerned with archaeological remnants that have been related to the Caucasian Albanians and their Church. In Chapter 9 (Urban Planning and Architecture of Caucasian Albania. Main Monuments and Trends of Development), Armen Kazaryan, director of the Institute of Architecture and Urban-Planning of the Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, provides an overview of the cities, fortresses and other fortifications as well as churches and other monuments that have been associated with the Albanians. In Chapter 10 (The Ensemble of the “Seven Churches” – an Ecumenical Monastery Ahead of Time?), Patrick Donabédian, specialist of Early and Medieval Islamic art and architecture of Aix-Marseille University, Aix-en-Provence, scrutinises the architectural properties of the ruined ensemble of churches named Yeddi Kilsǝ in Northwest Azerbaijan and its architectural relations to the neighbouring regions. In Chapter 11 (Tigranakert in Artsakh), Hamlet Petrosyan, historian, archeologist and anthropologist of the Department of Cultural Studies, Yerevan State Universi-\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nty, and the Institute for Archaeology and Ethnography, National Academy of Sciences, Yerevan, gives a comprehensive account of the present state of the excavations undertaken at the site of Tigranakert in Northeast Karabakh, with special emphasis on the reforms of the Albanian king Vachagan III manifesting themselves there. The final five Chapters of the Handbook are devoted to ethnic, religious and social issues of Caucasian Albania, from Late Antiquity up to the present day. In Chapter 12 (The Ethnic Situation in Antique and Medieval Caucasian Albania), Aleksan Hakobyan, renowned historian specialised on the Christian East at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the National Academy of Sciences, Yerevan, examines the question whether the late antique state of Albania was ethnically homogeneous and traces the emergence of an Albanian “meta-ethnos” through the centuries. Chapter 13 (The Rebels of Early Abbasid Albania) by Alison Vacca, historian of early Islam working on the caliphal provinces Armenia and Caucasian Albania at Columbia University in the City of New York, analyses the Arabic sources concerning rebellions in and around Albania during the Abbasid era (c. 566–809 CE) and the information these sources provide as to the inhabitants of the Caucasian provinces under Arab rule and their relation to the Caliphate. In Chapter 14 (“You say Albanian, I say Armenian”: Discourses of Ethnicity and Power Around an Albanian King of Armenia), Sergio La Porta, specialist on Near Eastern Languages and Civilisation in the Armenian Studies Program of California State University, Fresno, investigates the identity and positionality of a local king of the 11th century named Senekerim and ideologies of kinship manifesting themselves in contemporary and later discourses. In Chapter 15 (Between the Planes and the Mountains: the Albanian-Armenian Marches in the 12th Century and David of Gandzak), Igor Dorfmann-Lazarev studies the relation of Christian and Muslim inhabitants of the city of Ganja/Gandzak during the rule of the Kurdish Shaddadids and the first decades of the Turkic colonisation of the south-eastern Caucasus, with a focus on the “Admonitory Exhortations” of the Christian Armenian author David son of Alavik (c. 1065–1140) which mirror this relation. In an appended Chapter (15A: The Gate of Ganja), Jost Gippert provides a short account of the iron gate of Gandzak which was transferred as booty to Georgia by king Demetre after capturing the city in 1139. Lastly, Chapter 16 (Reverse Engineering: A StateCreated “Albanian Apostolic Church”) by Hratch Tchilingirian, researcher on the sociology of minorities and inter-ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus at the Oriental Institute of the University of Oxford, examines the way how Azerbaijan is constructing an “Albanian Apostolic” or “Udi Orthodox Church” as part of a new narrative that connects the modern state to ancient peoples, cultures and early Christianity in the Caucasus.\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nStructural preliminaries Due to its broad historical scope, the Handbook deals with original sources in various languages and scripts, from (Caucasian) Albanian via Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Middle Persian, Parthian, and Russian up to Syriac. Given the chaos of different systems of transcription that are spread over the scholarly literature, we decided to use a simplified English transcription throughout the main text of the Handbook, thus rendering it as easily readable as possible. This accounts for all kinds of names and terms which are known from, or identifiable via, English reference works, but also for author’s names, which are resolved in their original spelling in the bibliographical references. Non-Latin scripts are usually only reproduced as such in quotations from original texts; the same is true for scientific transcription systems, which are here and there used in rendering names and special terms, especially when the actual sounding is thematised. In these cases, the transcription systems are those applied in the first edition of the Albanian palimpsests of Mt Sinai (Gippert et al. 2008) for Caucasian languages, Hübschmann-Benveniste for Armenian, DIN for Arabic, and Orientalists’ systems for other languages; Greek remains untranscribed. To help our readers cope with the wide range of publications referred to, many of which are hard to find in public or scientific libraries, we have added links to online representations (mostly in PDF format) wherever possible. In some cases, access will be limited to certain persons or institutions, and sometimes it will depend on fees; we hope that this will not result in severe problems for anybody. We have added links to Google Books only if it provides at least partial access to the contents of a given book or source, and we have refrained from linking to booksellers as we do not regard commercial support as our task. Publications that are only available online are labelled as such.\n\nAcknowledgements As editors, we are extremely grateful to the contributors of the Handbook who, alongside their many other duties, were ready to provide their Chapters in a remarkably short period of time so that the volume can now go into the press just one and a half year after the first online meeting of its participants. Beyond the authors of the Chapters, we wish to express our thanks to several other colleagues who have supported the publication with help and advice. Besides the late Zaza Aleksidze and Jean-Pierre Mahé, who generously let us make use of their introduction to the first edition of the Albanian palimpsests, this is true for the team of the Sinai Palimpsests Project (Claudia Rapp, Michael Phelps, Keith\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nKnox, Robert Easton and various other members of the Early Manuscripts Electronic Library, EMEL, as well as Dawn Childress and other members of the staff of the library of the University of California at Los Angeles, UCLA), who made excellent multispectral and transmissive light images available and thus facilitated a thorough re-analysis of the only manuscript remnants of the Albanian language. We are further grateful to many people who generously shared photographs and drawings with us; this is true, first of all, for the participants of the Artsakh archaeological expedition of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, National Academy of Sciences, Republic of Armenia, but also for Arshak Banouchyan, Andranik Kekishyan, Timur Maisak, Slava Sargsyan, Jon Seligman, Nikolaus von Twickel, and several online users who share their images via the internet. Our thanks are also due to a lot of librarians world-wide who undertook the efforts of digitising manuscripts, microfilms, and ancient and rare books which we needed for our research; in place of all, let us name the staff of the Matenadaran (Research Institute of Ancient Manuscripts named after Mesrop Mashtots) and the Tache and Tamar Manoukian Library of the Mother See of St Ejmiatsin in Armenia, and Emzar Jgerenaia and Nineli Mikadze of the National Parliament Library of Georgia as well as Maia Machavariani and Temo Jojua of the Korneli Kekelidze Georgian National Centre of Manuscripts, Tbilisi, who helped us searching for old journals and manuscripts and identifying unknown authors. Peculiar thanks are due to the publishing house of de Gruyter, Berlin, who kindly accepted this Handbook for their “Reference” series, and especially to Birgit Sievert and Barbara Karlson, who accompanied us with help and advice during its preparation. Lastly, we greatly acknowledge the support by the European Research Council (ERC) and the German Research Foundation (DFG) who facilitated the preparation and Open Access publication of this Handbook by generous grants within the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and Germany’s Excellence Strategy, and the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Culture of the University of Hamburg for providing the necessary infrastructure.

Greek and Latin sources help to shed light on some aspects of Albanian political history, particularly in the period between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, but they are also central for a better understanding of questions crucial to the history of ancient Albania, such as ethnic and geographical issues. The occasional contradictory nature of these sources and their fragmentation should not hinder the historians’ attempt to outline the main features of Albanian history.\n\n1 Present and past Interest in Caucasian Albania has been rekindled after the Second NagornoKarabakh War in October 2020, producing heated debates and renewing the focus on the history of the Southern Caucasus and the fate of the cultural heritage of the region. This impulse to the investigation of the past, imparted by events of the present, is not surprising, “for, whether it likes it or not, it is according to its present needs that [history] systematically collects, and then classifies and groups the facts of the past. It is in function of life that it gathers the testimony of the dead […] Organising the past in relation to the present: this could be called the social function of history”.1 The dynamics between present events and the understanding of the past, perhaps inherent to human psychology,2 is one of the main stimuli for reflection on the past. In the case of Caucasian Albania, for example, Russian penetration into the Caucasus was the spur that led to the rediscovery of this ancient country from the 19th century onwards, also encouraging the publication of studies based on the ancient sources that preserved evidence of it.3 Even in the 20th century and at the beginning of the present millennium, a number of studies was fostered by nationalistic tensions in the South Caucasus, without in\n\n1 Febvre (1949: 245–246). 2 Cf.

They, in fact, began to deal with Albania when the territories of the South Caucasus became the theatre of the Mithridatic Wars, shortly before the middle of the 1st century BCE, thus marking the entry of Albania into Rome’s geographical and political horizon. From that moment on and for several centuries to follow, the narration of the military operations carried out by Lucullus and Pompey in the Caucasus (75–63 BCE) and the campaigns of the first Roman emperors to the eastern borders of the empire were the context in which a series of rapid references to Albania and the Albanians found their place. The information conveyed is sometimes limited to the mere mention of a few names or episodes of warfare, which in any case testify to the role of Albania in the strategies implemented by Rome to control and consolidate the eastern limes of its dominion.7 Despite the loss of the work of Theophanes of Mytilene (1st century BCE), a direct witness to Pompey’s exploits in the East, information about Albania and the Albanians at the time of the Mithridatic Wars has been handed down by various authors such as Titus Livius (1st century BCE – 1st century CE), who mentioned them in one of his lost books of which only a short summary survives (Periocha 101). More detailed are the accounts of Plutarch (1st–2nd century CE) in the Vitae of Lucullus (chapter XXVI, 4) and Pompey (XXXIV–XXXV; XXXVIII), and those of Appian (2nd century: Mithridatic Wars 103) and Dio Cassius (2nd–3rd century: Roman History XXXVI, 54; XXXVII, 1–5). In contrast to these, little more than\n\n4 Abuladze (1938), Shanidze (1938). See Gippert et al.

A few decades after the end of the Third Mithridatic War, it was the military operations conducted by Publius Canidius Crassus in Armenia and the Caucasus, particularly against Iberia (Eastern Georgia) and Albania, in preparation for Mark Antony’s Parthian campaign (37–36 BCE) that kept the spotlight on Albania. Again, the work of the most direct witness to the events, Quintus Dellius, a friend of Mark Antony, has been lost. Albania and the Albanians are named in connection with those events by Plutarch in the Vita of Mark Antony (XXXIV, 10) and by Dio Cassius (XLIX, 24), while the Emperor Augustus mentions in his Res Gestae the request for friendship sent to Rome also by the ambassadors of the kings of Albania and Iberia (§ 31). In the following decades and centuries, the tensions between Rome and the Iranian world, sometimes resulting in conflicts on the Armenian plateau, gave rise to a renewed attention to the peoples of the South Caucasus, including the Albanians, occasionally mentioned under the reigns of Tiberius (14–37) and Nero (54–68) in the Antiquities of the Jews (XVIII, 97) by Flavius Josephus (1st century CE) and in the Annals (II, 68; IV, 5; VI, 33–35; XII, 45; XIII, 41) by Tacitus (1st– 2nd century CE). In his Histories (I, 6), the latter also mentions Nero’s plan of an expedition in Albanos.8 The Parthian campaign undertaken by Trajan (97–117) in the last years of his reign provides Eutropius (VIII, 3.1) and Festus (20.2) with an opportunity to recall, using almost the same words, the reassertion of Roman authority over the South Caucasus, including Albania. Emperor Hadrian (117–138) is said to have maintained good relations with Albanians, Iberians, Armenians and other eastern peoples, showering their kings with benefits, despite their refusal to meet him (Augustan History, Life of Hadrian 21.8).9 Under Hadrian, both Dio Cassius (LXIX, 15.1) and Themistius (4th century CE: Oration 34, 8; 32) mention\n\n8 On the possible interpretations of this passage, see Bais (2001: 86–87) and, more recently, Hajiev (2007), Greatrex (2007: 137–139), and Preud’homme (2021: 157) and the literature cited in these studies. 9 Bais (2001: 94) with bibliography, Braund (1991) and especially Giardina (1996: 108–119).\n\n6\n\nMarco Bais\n\nan incursion of Alans which caused damage to Albania and Media and reached as far as Armenia and Cappadocia, then governed by Arrian, author of the Anabasis of Alexander in which the Albanians are mentioned (III, 8.4; 11.4; 13.1), perhaps anachronistically, among the allies of the Persians already at the time of the battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE).10 Thereafter, the already scarce mentions of Albania and the Albanians in Greek and Latin sources become even more sparse and, where they do resurface, it is always in connection with the troubled relations between the Romans and the Sasanians. Until about the mid-3rd century, Albania is absent from the texts that have come down to us. It is referred to in the Augustan History (Life of Valerian 4.1), which speaks of the loyalty of the Iberians, Albanians and other peoples to Emperor Valerian (253–260) after he has been taken prisoner by the Iranian king of kings, Shapur I. Similarly, the Life of Aurelian reports the veneration enjoyed by Emperor Aurelian (270–275) among the Albanians and other eastern peoples (41.10). Despite the fact that the 3rd century ended with the reassertion of Roman power in the East, sanctioned by the Treaty of Nisibis in 299, the gradual disappearance of Albania from Greek and Latin sources seems to be a symptom of the removal of this country from the Romans’ political horizon. Indeed, some sixty years later, Ammianus Marcellinus (Res Gestae XVIII, 6–7; XIX, 2.3), a contemporary of the events narrated, presents an Albania openly siding with Persia at the time of the Persian occupation of the fortress of Amida in Mesopotamia (359). Tensions on the eastern limes of the Romano-Byzantine Empire and relations with the Sasanians are the context for a number of cursory mentions of Albania also in some Byzantine historians and chroniclers. Procopius of Caesarea (6th century) names the Albanians only in his description of the west-east trend of the Taurus range (Persian War I, 10.1). Yet, the way his narrative unfolds leaves the doubt that he meant to allude to the Alans instead, an altogether different people settled in the Northern Caucasus. Procopius refers to the Alans also in his overview of the Caucasus (Gothic War VIII, 2–3), where there is no mention of the Albanians, despite the fact that the historian, whose focus lies on the western part of the isthmus, cursorily hints at the eastern Caucasian regions as well. Menander the Guardsman (6th century), on the other hand, records two invasions by the generals of the Caesar Tiberius (574–578) in Albania (frg. 18.5–6),11 which is referred to as the theatre of Byzantine-Persian clashes in the early years of Emperor Maurice’s reign (582–602) by both Theophylact Simocatta (6th–7 th cen-\n\n10 Cf. 3. below for more details. 11 Blockley (1985: 162–166).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n7\n\ntury: History III, 6–7) and Theophanes the Confessor (8th–9th century).12 The latter also mentions Albania during the Caucasian campaign of Heraclius (610–641)13 and refers to it, as well as to Iberia and other countries, at the time of the confrontation between the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphs, in the early years of Emperor Justinian II (685–695 and 705–711).14 Even a later author such as John Zonaras (12th century), drawing extensively from earlier sources, names Albania several times, both in connection with Pompey’s expedition to the Caucasus (Epitome X, 4.7; 18)15 and with the Alans’ raid recorded by Dio Cassius (XI, 24.2),16 and in relation to the reign of Justinian II (Epitome XIV, 22.11; XV, 1.14),17 again showing a tendency to confuse the Albanians with the Alans.18\n\n2.2 Geography and ethnography The Roman expansion in the East fostered interest in the new lands not only in historians who dealt with Rome’s political and military affairs. The military campaigns were in fact accompanied by the exploration of the regions traversed by Roman armies with the consequent creation of maps.19 This knowledge flowed into the works of geographers, ethnographers and naturalists that are among the most interesting and extensive Greek and Latin accounts of Albania and the Albanians. Among these works, the Geography of Strabo (1st century BCE – 1st century CE) stands out for the richness and variety of information conveyed. Strabo, a native of Amaseia in the Pontus, not far from the Caucasus, does not limit himself to geographical notations but also makes considerations on the economy, political and social structure, religion and customs of the Albanians (XI, 4). While drawing on the tradition of earlier geographers such as Eratosthenes (3rd–2nd century BCE), he points to Iberia and Albania as examples of recently explored countries for which he could rely on new sources (II, 5.12), one of which is certainly Theophanes of Mytilene, mentioned together with Metrodorus of Scepsis (2nd–1st century BCE) and Hypsicrates of Amissus (1st century BCE) in a passage about the\n\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\n\nde Boor (1883: 262). de Boor (1883: 308–309). de Boor (1883: 363).

Strabo is not the only author to touch on social and economic aspects of Albania. A rather vague and incidental hint of these aspects can also be found in a passage of the Preparation for the Gospel (VI, 10.31) of Eusebius of Caesarea (3rd–4th century), inspired by Bardaisan’s Book of the Laws of the Countries (2nd– 3rd century). Eusebius lists Albania and other countries such as Alania, Otene, Sarmatia and Scythia, among the lands where one does not meet bankers, painters, architects, geometers, masters of declamation, etc. The Geography by Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE) is a description of the world known in his time that shows the borders of the different countries, records the names of the peoples and contains long lists of settlements, rivers, mountains, etc., identified by means of precise coordinates. Accordingly, Albania extended from 77° to 87° (longitude) and from 44° to 47° (latitude) in the Ptolemaean grid of parellels and meridians; cf. his “Third map of Asia” as designed on the basis of the Latin translation by Jacopo d’Angelo in 1467 and its excerpt showing Albania (Figures 1–2).21 The Geography thus constitutes our main source for the toponymy of Albania: most of the ancient Albanian place names we know are attested only in this work (V, 11).22 Ptolemy does not give much information about his sources but it seems that, in addition to previous geographical works, he also made use of maps, itineraria and exploratory reports by merchant travellers and seafarers.23 Pliny the Elder (1st century CE) discusses the Caucasus in the first part of Book VI of his Natural History (VI, 29; 38–39), which closes the section of the work devoted to geography and ethnography. The type of information conveyed is essentially of a geographical and ethnographic nature, presenting the orohydrographic and ethnic characteristics of various regions. The author does not neglect to point out cases in which information from the ancients can be supplemented and sometimes corrected by data provided by contemporaries. Thus, we know that, as far as the Caucasus is concerned, Pliny saw the maps made during Corbulo’s Parthian campaigns shortly after the mid-1st century BCE and criticised them for confusing the Portae Caucasiae (i.e. the Darial Gorge, also known as the Gate\n\n20 For the status quaestionis regarding the sources of Strabo’s Book XI, see Lasserre (1975: 7– 28). 21 Ptolemy, Geography, Ἀσίας πίναξ γʹ.

Information on the ethnic groups, settlements and communication routes of the south-eastern Caucasus is also found in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a medieval copy (12th–13th century) of a cartographic representation of the known world dating back to the Roman era (3rd or 4th century CE; cf. Fig. 3),25 and in the cosmography compiled by an anonymous Ravennate around the 8th century, known as Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia (I, 12).26\n\n2.3 Mythological contexts The progress in the knowledge of an unknown land is sometimes associated with the paradoxical narration of mirabilia, such as the news from Isigonos of Nicaea 24 Braund (1994: 225–226); Bais (2001: 87, n. 360); Preud’homme (2021). 25 Bosio (1983: 149–162). The dating problem remains open: whereas Talbert (2010: 7; 135–136; 149–153) thinks more or less of this period, Emily Albu in various articles and especially in Albu (2014) considers the map a product of the Carolingian world (c. 800). On this and other problems concerning the Tabula, see Rathmann (2015). 26 Schnetz (1940: 11–12).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n11\n\n(1st century BCE), taken up by Pliny (Natural History VII, 12) and Aulus Gellius (2nd century CE), who relates it this way: “it was handed down by tradition that in a distant land called Albania men are born whose hair turns white in childhood and who see better by night than in the daytime”.27 We find the same tradition, expressed in almost the same words, in Solinus (3rd century CE) who, however, makes explicit the paretymological link between the ethnic name and the colour of the hair, joining Albanus ‘Albanian’ with albus ‘white’: “the colour of the head gave name to the people”.28 The recourse to the language of mythical imagery is not infrequently bent to the service of political propaganda.29 A noteworthy case is the mention of the Amazons among the adversaries faced by Pompey during the Mithridatic Wars, suggesting a comparison between the exploits of the Roman general and mythical heroes such as Hercules and Theseus, as well as great figures of the past such as Alexander the Great.30 The Roman presence in the Caucasus also offers reason to recall the myth of Jason, the hero who led the Argonauts to the conquest of the Golden Fleece. Pliny (Natural History VI, 38) and Solinus (Collection of Curiosities 15.5) hint at a supposed descent of the Albanians from Jason, while according to Justin’s epitome of Pompeius Trogus (XLII, 3.4) they would have entered into a pact with the Greek hero.31 With regard to their origin, Justin/Trogus says they came from Mount Albano in Italy, from where they are said to have followed Hercules when he travelled the peninsula after stealing the catkins from Geryon. This is perhaps a tradition reflecting Pompey’s use of kinship diplomacy in the Caucasus.32 This use of myth as an ideological key is particularly revealing of how much the present can influence the historians’ gaze on the past and how much the events of the time in which the ancient (but also modern!) historians find themselves living constitute one of the motives for their investigation. The intrusion of the present brings with it all the conditionings – personal convictions, ideological\n\n27 Gellius, Attic Nights IX, 4.6: … traditum esse memoratumque in ultima quadam terra, quae Albania dicitur, gigni homines, qui in pueritia canescant et plus cernant oculis per noctem quam interdiu (Rolfe 1927: 164). 28 Solinus, Collection of Curiosities 15.5: capitis color genti nomen dedit (Mommsen 1895: 83). 29 Braund (1986). 30 There is large literature on the influence of the Alexander myth on Roman politics and Pompey’s activities. Recent publications include Kopij (2017), who insists on Pompey’s Mithridatic campaign as the starting point of the general’s imitatio Alexandri; cf. Kühnen (2008: 53–75) and Barnett (2017: 15–21) and the literature cited therein. 31 Bais (2001: 61, n. 237). 32 Patterson (2002); cf.

This must be borne in mind when using the testimonies of ancient authors, but also modern historiographical production, and it should also alert us to our own work as historians. For while we aim for as neutral a representation of our object of study as possible, we are also aware of the impossibility of completely detaching ourselves from our subjectivity in order to aspire to absolute objectivity.34 This does not mean that the work of historians is condemned to relativism or to an irredeemable subjectivism. From these risks we can be saved precisely by the awareness that “[w]e cannot be impartial. We can only be intellectually honest: that is, to be aware of our passions, to guard against them, and to warn our readers against the dangers of our partiality. Impartiality is a dream, probity is a duty”.35 Nevertheless, it can happen that historians fail in their duty as well, particularly when directly involved in identity issues or territorial disputes that feed on distortions, reinterpretations, downsizing and denials of history.36 But if it is grave that those who are directly affected by these issues can indulge more or less deliberately in instrumental and sectarian reconstructions, I believe it is even more grave and dangerous that the very object of research is perceived – or is made to be perceived – as so contaminated and so dangerous for anyone who approaches it, merely because it has been used to fuel a nationalistic diatribe. This is the case with two questions crucial to the history of ancient Albania, the ethnic issue and the geographical and territorial issue, for which the classical sources are pivotal.\n\n3 Ethnic issues In the 60s of the 1st century BCE, during the Mithridatic Wars, we find the Albanians under the leadership of Oroises/Oroizes (Ὀροίσης/Ὀροίζης), their chief (βασιλεύς), allied with the Iberians against Pompey, to whom they would later submit.37 Plutarch considers them, together with the Iberians, the most important 33 Topolski (1997: 69–70; 131–139). 34 However, absolute objectivity would be so aseptic and sterile as to be regarded as “eunuchisch[e] Objektivität” (“eunuchic objectivity”; Droyßen 1977: 236). 35 Salvemini (2017: 3). 36 Among the many examples that could be cited, see those examined by Hewsen (1982) and cited in Fabian (2020: 16, n. 26). Traina (2002: 228) notes “a certain ‘political’ use of sources” also in Hakobyan (1987). 37 Appian, Mithridatic Wars 103; Dio, Roman History XXXVII, 4–5; Plutarch, Pompey XXXIV– XXXV.\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n13\n\npeople among all those settled in the vicinity of the Caucasus and crossed by Pompey in pursuit of Mithridates (Pompey XXXIV, 2), thus hinting at the existence, next to the Iberians and Albanians, of other Caucasian tribes that came into contact with the Romans on that occasion. Other Caucasian peoples are also mentioned by Dio Cassius when he states that, after concluding peace with the Albanians, Pompey received messengers from some tribes living along the Caucasus as far as the Caspian Sea with whom he made peace agreements (Roman History XXXVII, 5.1). Thus, along the slopes of the Caucasus there lived tribes that had probably participated in the struggle waged by the Albanians and Iberians against the Romans but were not part of either the Albanian or the Iberian state and had sufficient political autonomy to be able to negotiate peace directly with the Roman general. The names of these peoples are mostly unknown to us, but Plutarch and Appian give some clues in the passages mentioned above, while speaking of the Amazons who allegedly sided with the Albanians (Pompey XXXV) or with the Albanians and the Iberians (Mithridatic Wars 103) against the Romans. Appian doubts that these Amazons are to be considered a neighbouring nation,38 wondering whether this might rather be a generic designation by which the barbarians generally called warriors “women”.39 Plutarch, on the other hand, specifies that they do not border on the Albanians but are divided by them from the Gelae and Leges,40 just as we read in Strabo, according to whom it was Theophanes of Mytilene who said that between the Amazons and the Albanians live the Scythian Gelae and Legae.41 Therefore, Gelae and Legae must have been peoples neighbouring the Albanians, but distinct from them, possibly related to those nomads who, according to Strabo, join with the Albanians in war against the outsiders, just as they do with the Iberians, and for the same reasons.42 Florus is the only historian to mention “Caspians” in the context of the Mithridatic Wars, stating that “Iberians, Caspians, Albanians and both Armenias” were dragged into ruin by Mithridates.43 A few centuries later, in 363 CE, Emperor 38 Appian, Mithridatic Wars 103: ἔθνος γειτονεῦον (Viereck & Roos 1962: 513). 39 Appian, Mithridatic Wars 103: τινὰς πολεμικὰς ὅλως γυναῖκας (Viereck & Roos 1962: 513). 40 Plutarch, Pompey XXXV, 6: οὐχ ὁμοροῦσαι τοῖς Ἀλβανοῖς, ἀλλὰ Γέλαι καὶ Λῆγες οἰκοῦσι διὰ μέσου (Sintenis 1869: 226). 41 Strabo, Geography XI, 5.1: μεταξὺ τῶν Ἀμαζόνων καὶ τῶν Ἀλβανῶν φησι Γήλας οἰκεῖν καὶ Λήγας Σκύθας (Meineke 1877: II, 707). 42 Strabo, Geography XI, 4.5: τούτοις δὲ συμπολεμοῦσιν οἱ νομάδες πρὸς τοὺς ἔξωθεν, ὥσπερ τοῖς Ἴβηρσι, κατὰ τὰς αὐτὰς αἰτίας (Meineke 1877: II, 705). This is Strabo’s text. Traina’s translation “Si uniscono a loro anche i nomadi contro nemici esterni, come gli Iberi, e per cause comuni” (Nicolai & Traina 2000: 103) is wrong at this point. 43 Florus, Epitomes I, 40.21: Itaque conversus ad proximas gentes totum paene orientem ac septentrionem ruina sua involvit. Hiberi, Caspii, Albani et utraeque sollicitantur Armeniae, per quae omnia decus et nomen et titulos gloriae Pompeio suo Fortuna quaerebat (Forster 1947: 184).\n\n14\n\nMarco Bais\n\nJulian exhorted his soldiers before the confrontation with the Persians by recalling previous Roman campaigns in those regions and mentioning Lucullus and Pompey “who, passing through the Albanians and the Massagetae, whom we now call Alans, broke into this nation also and saw the Caspian Sea”.44 Apart from the problems connected with the Caspians of Florus45 and the Massagetae mentioned by Julian in Ammianus Marcellinus, who records an ethnopolitical situation of the eastern Caspian coast subsequent to the time of the Mithridatic Wars,46 the accounts describing the victory of Pompey in 61 BCE mention only the main peoples over whom Pompey celebrated his triumph, such as the Albanians and the Iberians,47 passing over in silence the possible presence of other (minor) Caucasian tribes close to them that enriched the ethnic landscape in which the Albanians and Iberians were placed, unless we want to recognise in the Scythian women paraded in triumph48 the Amazons mentioned in the sources, as some scholars do.49 The geographers are more prodigal with information on the ethnic context of the Albanians. According to Strabo, the Iberians and Albanians almost completely fill the Caucasian isthmus (Geography II, 2.19) and occupy a territory that lies on the southern edge of the regions inhabited by the Maeotic Sauromatians, the Scythians, Achaei, the Zygi, and the Heniochi (II, 5.31). The section of his Geography devoted to Albania (XI, 4) opens by recalling the proximity of the Albanians to the nomadic peoples:50 “The Albanians on the other hand are more\n\n44 Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae XXIII, 5.16: qui per Albanos et Massagetas, quos Alanos nunc appellamus, hac quoque natione perrupta, vidit Caspios lacus (Gardthausen 1968: 319). 45 About the Caspians and the Caspiane (ἡ Κασπιανή) see Bais (2001: 51–52). 46 On the Massagetae see Bais (2006; 2014: 276–279); Hajiev (2021b). 47 Pliny, Natural History VII, 98; Plutarch, Pompey XLV (followed by Zonaras, Epitome X, 5); Appian, Mithidatic Wars 116–117. Diodorus Siculus (Historical Library XL, 4) mentions an inscription that recorded Pompey’s achievements in Asia, as well as the fact that he gave protection (ὑπερασπίσας), among others, to Armenia, (Scythian) Achaia, Iberia and Albania, and brought into subjection (ὑποτάξας), among others, the king of the Iberians, the Achaei, the Iozygi, the Soani, the Heniochi “and the other tribes along the seacoast between Colchis and the Maeotic Sea, with their kings, nine in number” (καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ φῦλα τὰ μεταξὺ Κολχίδος καὶ Μαιώτιδος λίμνης τὴν παράλιον διακατέχοντα καὶ τοὺς τούτων βασιλεῖς ἐννέα τὸν ἀριθμὸν; Walton 1984: 286). 48 Plutarch, Pompey XLV, 4 (Σκυθίδες γυναῖκες); Appian, Mithridatic Wars 117 (Σκυθῶν βασίλειοι γυναῖκες). 49 See e.g. Östenberg (2009: 148–149) who does not neglect to highlight that the ideological significance of the Amazons’ presence in this context evokes a link between Pompey and his enterprise and mythical figures such as Hercules and Theseus and great figures of the past such as Alexander the Great (cf. 2.3 with n. 30 above). 50 See Bais (2001: 59–60), considerations later taken up by Traina (2015: 45). See now Fabian (2020: 24–26).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n15\n\ninclined to the shepherd’s life and closer akin to the nomadic people, except that they are not savages, thus they are moderately warlike”.51 Strabo insists on this closeness, spatial as well as cultural, emphasising the double-edged character of the Albanians also by means of clichés known to ancient ethnography: they benefit from the fertility of their land without having to work too hard at farming (ΧΙ, 4.3); they lack mercantile spirit, are unfamiliar with accurate weights and measures, and ignorant of numbers over a hundred; they do not use money but practise bartering, and so on (XI, 4.4). Strabo also mentions some physical characteristics of the Albanians declaring them to be unusually handsome and large (XI, 4.4) and recalls their respectful attitude towards the elderly and some features of their funeral practices (XI, 4.8). He also dwells on some aspects of their religious (XI, 4.7) and political life. In this regard, he states that “the kings also are distinguished. Now, in truth, one rules all [the tribes], whereas before, each [tribe] had its own king according to its language. They have twenty-six languages because of the fact that they have no easy means of intercourse with each other”.52 According to Pliny’s account, “from the border of Albania the whole face of the mountains is occupied by the wild tribes of the Silvi and further down by those of the Lupenii, and afterwards by the Diduri and Sodi”.53 Besides, those entering the Scythian Gulf 54 have on the right “the Udini, a Scythian tribe, then along the coast the Albanians descended from Jason, as people say, whereby the part of the sea at that point is called ‘Albanian’. This nation, scattered across the Caucasus Mountains, comes down, as previously stated, as far as the river Cyrus (Kur), which forms the boundary of Armenia and Iberia. Beyond the coastal regions of this (nation) and the nation of the Udini lie the Sarmatae, the Uti, the\n\n51 Strabo, Geography XI, 4: Ἀλβανοὶ δὲ ποιμενικώτεροι καὶ τοῦ νομαδικοῦ γένους ἐγγυτέρω, πλὴν ἀλλ᾽οὐκ ἄγριοι· ταύτῃ δὲ καὶ πολεμικοὶ μετρίως (Meineke 1877: II, 704). 52 Strabo, Geography XI, 4.6: Διαφέρουσι δὲ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς· νυνὶ μὲν οὖν εἷς ἁπάντων ἄρχει, πρότερον δὲ καὶ καθ᾽ ἑκάστην γλῶτταν ἰδίᾳ ἐβασιλεύοντο ἕκαστοι. γλῶτται δ᾽ εἰσὶν ἓξ καὶ εἴκοσιν αὐτοῖς διὰ τὸ μὴ εὐεπίμικτον πρὸς ἀλλήλους (Meineke 1877: II, 706); cf. also Chapter 12 of this Handbook (Hakobyan), 1. 53 Pliny, Natural History VI, 29: ab Albaniae confinio tota montium fronte gentes Silvorum ferae et infra Lupeniorum, mox Diduri et Sodi (Rackham 1942: 358). 54 One of the gulfs that formed the Caspian Sea. Pliny follows the theory of Eratosthenes, but probably already of Hecataeus of Miletus, according to which the Caspian Sea was not an inland sea but rather an inlet from the northern Ocean. The hypothesis that it was, instead, an enclosed sea was supported by Herodotus (Histories I, 202.4) and Aristotle (Meteorology II, 1.354a) and was later accepted by Ptolemy (Geography VII, 5.4); see the classic histories of ancient geography on this point: Bunbury (1879: I, 222; II, 592–593); Tozer (1961: 136, 345); Thomson (1948: 79–86); and, more recently, Gehrke (2015: 91–93) on the role of Alexander the Great’s enterprise in reinforcing the idea of the open sea.\n\n16\n\nMarco Bais\n\nAorsi, the Aroteres, and in their rear the already mentioned Amazons and Sauromatides”.55 Pomponius Mela, too, conceives the Caspian as an open sea composed of three gulfs – the Hyrcanian, the Scythian and the Caspian – and, listing the peoples living on the coasts, he states that “inland, on the Caspian Gulf there are the Caspians and the Amazons, but those they call Sauromatides; on the Hyrcanian Gulf the Albanians, the Moschi and the Hyrcani; on the Scythian Gulf the Amardi and Pestici and, already near the strait, the Derbices”.56 Ptolemy, more concisely, states that Albania is bordered in the north by Sarmatia, in the west by Iberia, in the south by Armenia and in the east by the Hyrcanian Sea (Geography V, 11.1) and, indicating the location of certain peoples of Asiatic Sarmatia, he states that along the Pontus are settled Achaei, Cercetae, Heniochi and Suannocolchi and above Albania the Sanaraei (Geography V, 8.13). These testimonies give us an idea of the rich ethnic context in which Albanians and Iberians are immersed, but from which they stand out as two of the most important peoples both in terms of number and because they appear to be organised in a state structure headed by a chief (βασιλεύς). Moreover, Strabo’s depiction of the Albanians as a people with distinctive physical traits and shared customs and religious institutions would make one think of them as a strongly cohesive people. This image, however, is shattered in the paragraph in which Strabo speaks of the Albanians as a conglomeration of 26 tribes, distinct on a linguistic basis, whose achieved political unity – that is, the fact of having only one king, and this is the situation that the sources describe at the time of Pompey’s campaigns – has not yet resulted in a true fusion of the different ethnic segments, which, due to the difficulty of mutual contacts, maintain their individuality and continue to speak 26 different languages. Strabo’s description of the Albanians gives rise to a series of questions with which historians have to deal and which are partly related to the way we interpret the geographer’s passage. Should we take it as referring to the first step of a process that should have led to the formation of an Albanian “ethnos”, or does it instead depict the formation of that confederation of tribes, the Ἀλβανοί/Albani\n\n55 Pliny, Natural History VI, 38–39: … Udini Scytharum populus, dein per oram Albani, ut ferunt, ab Iasone orti, unde quod mare ibi est Albanum nominatur. haec gens superfusa montibus Caucasis ad Cyrum amnem, Armeniae confinium atque Hiberiae, descendit, ut dictum est. supra maritima eius Udinorumque gentem Sarmatae, Uti, Aorsi, Aroteres praetenduntur, quorum a tergo indicatae iam Amazones et Sauromatides (Rackham 1942: 364–366 with the reading Utidorsi instead of Uti Aorsi). 56 Pomponius Mela, Description of the World III, 39: Intus sunt ad Caspium sinum Caspii et Amazones sed quas Sauromatidas adpellant, ad Hyrcanium Albani et Moschi et Hyrcani, in Scythico Amardi et Pestici et iam ad fretum Derbices (Parthey 1867: 70–71).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n17\n\nwith which the Roman generals in the 1st century BCE were confronted?57 The presence in the text of the adverb νυνί ‘now’, as opposed to πρότερον ‘before’, suggests that the situation described by the sentence “now, in truth, one rules all [the tribes]…”, refers to a period shortly before the account was written. In fact, the presence of a single leader (βασιλεύς) at the head of the Albanians is what we find at the time of the Mithridatic Wars. Therefore, this situation dates back to a period roughly contemporary to Strabo and certainly contemporary to his source, if we assume that this passage goes back to Theophanes of Mytilene who took part in Pompey’s military operations. The fact that Strabo then goes on in the present tense: “They have twenty-six languages…”, suggests that this variety was still under the eyes of the Romans at the time of Pompey. It would thus seem reasonable to conclude that Strabo’s passage describes the presumably recent formation of a confederation of tribes. If the territory called Ἀλβανία/Albania was inhabited by 26 different linguistic communities shortly before the mid-1st century BCE, the Ἀλβανοί/Albani against whom Pompey fought according to the ancient sources cannot possibly be an “ethnos”. It seems more likely that ancient authors used that name to designate the ethnically diverse population that inhabited the territory of the Albanian state over which political control was exercised by a single leader. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that Ἀλβανοί/Albani was originally the name – most likely as an exoethnonym, corresponding to a different endoethnonym unknown to us – of the leading ethnic group of this set of tribes, perhaps the same ethnic group that supplied the leader for the entire confederation. If so, one might go so far as to imagine an Albanian ethnos pre-existing the Albanian state as the Romans knew it at the time of the Mithridatic Wars, and one might ask whether the testimony of Arrian (Anabasis of Alexander III, 8.4; 11.4; 13.1) who, writing in the 2nd century CE, mentions the Albanians among the allies of the Persians against Alexander the Great at Gaugamela (331 BCE), is to be considered an anachronism or, instead, a trace of the existence of this ethnos already a few centuries before our first accounts on Albania. In this perspective, even the episode of the dogs presented by an Albanian king to Alexander the Great 58 could be read in a different light.59 Furthermore, if the Ἀλβανοί/Albani met by Pompey were a conglomeration of tribes, what was the relationship between them and the numerous peoples\n\n57 Bais (2001: 60, 70–71). 58 Pliny, Natural History VIII, 149–150; Solinus, Collection of Curiosities XV, 7. Pliny lists Albania among the countries crossed and subjugated by the Macedonian armies (Natural History IV, 39). 59 In Bais (2001: 69) it is considered a variation of the similar episode involving an Indian king (Strabo, Geography XV, 1.31; Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library XVII, 92), but see the considerations of Traina (2003: 318–319).\n\n18\n\nMarco Bais\n\nsettled in their vicinity according to the sources? This question has come to the fore again, especially after the recent advances in the knowledge on the ancient “Albanian” language, which have revealed beyond doubt its close connection to modern Udi,60 which Akaki Shanidze had already assumed.61 What relationship exists between the modern Udis and the ancient Udini and Uti mentioned in our sources? And between the Gargarians (Γαργαρεῖς), neighbours of the Amazons,62 and the Gargaracʿikʿ that some Armenian authors relate to the language of their neighbours converted by Mesrop Mashtots?63 And between these peoples and the Albanians?64 These are complex issues that also involve reflecting on what kind of ethnicity is implied by an ethnonym of Classical times.65 Of course, attempting to answer these questions requires that we also take into consideration the data from the other sources available, particularly the Armenian ones, which, although later, confirm the intricacy of the ethnic landscape of the Eastern Caucasus and hand down ethnonyms that are sometimes difficult to compare with those attested in Greek and Latin sources. However, it must never be forgotten that half a millennium elapsed between the information reported by the Classical sources and that conveyed by the Armenian texts,66 not to mention the data obtainable from the Albanian palimpsests, and thus they cannot provide us with homogenous data.67 As can be seen, ethnic issues are of great relevance and scholars continue to grapple with them, both because a widely accepted reconstruction of the facts has not yet been achieved, and because advances in our knowledge of ancient Albania are gradually raising new problems, which sometimes require a reinterpretation of our data. Despite this, these themes have sometimes been regarded with suspicion, as if they were in themselves indicative of a nationalistic drift in historiographical reconstruction.68 While it is true that interest in questions of\n\n60 Cf. Chapter 5 of this Handbook (Schulze and Gippert) for details. 61 Shanidze (1938). 62 Strabo, Geography XI, 5.1. 63 Movses Khorenatsi, History of the Armenians III, 54 and, based on him, Movses Kałankatuatsi/ Daskhurantsi, History of the Country of the Albanians II, 3. 64 See e.g. Gippert et al. (2008: II-95–102); Schulze (2015; 2018). 65 See the considerations in Schulze (2018: 275–281). 66 Cf. Chapter 2 of this Handbook (Dum-Tragut and Gippert) for a survey of relevant Armenian works. 67 Cf. Chapter 12 of this Handbook (Hakobyan) for further reflections on the issue of the ethnic diversity of Caucasian Albania. 68 See, for example, the criticism levelled by Traina (2002: 231) on the treatment of these issues in Bais (2001): “B[ais] while keeping his distance from the heated debate that often shifts, more or less inadvertently, from philology to politics, allows himself to be conditioned by the terms of the debate, and ends up considering ethnogenesis as the dominant element”. An odd remark\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n19\n\nidentity and ethnogenesis becomes central in a historiography tinged with nationalistic tendencies,69 we must prevent the degeneration of historiographical debate into political diatribe from polluting even the debated topics, to the point of tabooing them. Such attitudes are pernicious because they can hinder independent research, leaving these topics to those who make instrumental use of them. Criticism should therefore be directed at the way in which certain topics are treated, and not at the fact that they are treated.\n\n4 Geographical and territorial issues Issues related to the geographic location of the Albanians and the territorial extent of the Albanian state can also easily fuel the nationalistic debate,70 but that is not why they should be ignored. On the contrary, it is among the historians’ preliminary tasks to understand in which geographical area the object of their research lies. It is therefore not surprising that attention was paid to these issues already in the first studies devoted to Albania in the 19th century.71 Indeed, already some years before that century the Mekhitarist historian Mikayel Chamchean had dealt with the border between Armenia and Albania.72 Nor should it surprise us that interest in the historical geography of Albania has remained constant over time. As with ethnic questions, nationalistic distortions have hindered the construction of a shared vision of the historical geography of Albania, but this should not lead us to distance ourselves from these issues. On the contrary, it is precisely the risk of sectarian reconstruction that should incite greater rigour in historical investigation.73 Greek and Latin sources play an important role in this debate. For the earliest period, up to around the 3rd century CE, they offer valuable and, at times, unique, albeit sketchy information.\n\nindeed, given that my interpretation of Strabo’s passage is not ethnogenetic since I consider it rather a description of a stage in the development of the Albanian state; see Bais (2001: 70–71). Curiously enough, it is Traina himself who insists on the concept of ethnogenesis even when speaking of the formation of an Albanian state (2002: 232). 69 See, by way of example, Eriksen (2010); Kohl (1998); and the studies of Victor A. Shnirelman, among which Shnirelman (2001) is dedicated to Transcaucasia. 70 See Fabian (2020: 16, particularly notes 26 and 28). 71 Cf. Bais (2001: 149–153); Fabian (2020: 15–17) and the literature cited therein. 72 See e.g. Chamchean (1784: 565–566). 73 For these reasons, I do find it meaningless to speak of a “calcified discourse” when talking about Albanian historical geography, just as there is no point in defining it a “popular” subject among the 19th-century scholars that has remained so to this day (Fabian 2020: 15).\n\n20\n\nMarco Bais\n\nStrabo (Geography XI, 4.1) and Ptolemy (Geography V, 11.1) give us an overall territorial definition of Albania, i.e. with respect to all four cardinal points, and use both geographical objects (seas, mountains, rivers) and Albania’s neighbouring peoples as landmarks. Other authors, such as Pliny, provide scant geographical references, and so the location of the Albanians must be inferred mainly from their proximity to other ethnic groups (Natural History VI, 28–29; 39). Historians, finally, yield even more fragmentary pieces of information, such as incidental remarks generally linked to descriptions of troop movements during this or that military operation. But it is precisely the use of geographical data as points of reference – either to locate a certain war event, or to explain the tactical choices of a general – that confers great reliability and value to this kind of testimony. Therefore, geographical information dating back, for example, to the Caucasian expeditions of the Romans must not be debased in view of the fact that “the aim [of the Romans] was the pursuit of the king of Pontus Mithridates, and not the study of Albania”.74 In doing so, due account is not taken of the dialectical relation – inevitable in the case of military campaigns in remote and little-known regions – between strategy formulation and territorial exploration.75 Nor should one be seduced by the chimera of spatial contiguity that extols the reliability of the first-hand knowledge of authors born in or around the Caucasus, thereby persuading “to give preference, among sources from different languages and periods, both ancient and late (Arabic and Persian), to local sources (Albanian, Armenian and Georgian)”.76 To do so means to avoid making an overall assessment of the geographical information that can be found in classical authors without, however, precluding the possibility of occasionally resorting to it in order to draw arguments in support of this or that thesis. This leads to a devaluation of the evidence of authors who, although distant in space, are incomparably closer in\n\n74 Mamedova (1986: 119): “… чьей целью было преследование понтийского царя Митридата, а вовсе не изучение Албании”; cf. also Mamedova (2005: 277) where, furthermore, the scholar clearly states: “It seems to us that we should not overestimate the data of ancient authors on the issue we are interested in, because their information was occasional, contradictory and perhaps even inaccurate” (“Нам представляется, что не следует переоценивать данные античных авторов в интересующем нас вопросе, ибо их информация носила случайный, противоречивый характер и вполне могла быть не точной”). 75 Giardina (1996: 90–91). 76 Mamedova (1986: 88): “… из разноязычных и разновременных источников как античных, так и поздних арабских, персидских, предпочтение отдать местным источникам – албанским, армянским и грузинским”. This methodological approach is evident right from the presentation of the sources, which are divided into “Albanian” (actually works of Armenian literature such as Movses Kałankatuatsi/Daskhurantsi’s History and Mkhitar Gosh’s Chronicle) and Armenian, see Mamedova (1986: 5–42 and 42–54) where we do not find a word about the classical sources. A similar attitude can be found in Mamedova (2005: 277–278).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n21\n\ntime, with the risk of anachronistically attributing to an ancient period a later political balance.77 This attitude has favoured the development of a static view of the Albanian territorial extension, which would have remained substantially unchanged over the centuries: “taking stock of the investigation of the political boundaries of Albania over a long period of a thousand years (from the 3rd century BCE to the 8th century), it must be noted that the territorial limits of the Albanian state remained more or less stable”.78 On the contrary, the inclusion of the data handed down by the classical sources in the assessment of Albania’s territorial extent is crucial for formulating a dynamic model of the political balances in the Eastern Caucasus, according to which the area called Albania by the sources varied over the centuries.79 An element of ambiguity is certainly represented by the use in the sources of the ethnonym Ἀλβανοί/Albani, which designates an anthropic element that is not easily definable, along with the choronym Ἀλβανία/Albania, which instead refers to a territorial and political entity. Indeed, the ethnic boundary does not always coincide with that of a state formation created or determined by a given ethnic group, provided one manages to define the ethnic value of the ethnonym in question, which is not easy as we have seen above. It is imperative to escape the suggestion of the nation-state concept, in which political boundaries tend to be also ethnic and cultural boundaries. Ἀλβανία/Albania was rather a confederation of tribes or, if one prefers, a multi-ethnic entity: one thing is the ethnos, another is the state that theoretically may coincide with the territory inhabited by an ethnos, but may also be larger or smaller. Therefore, the alternation of ethnonym and choronym in ancient sources does not entitle us to speak of “the borders of the Albanian people” when discussing the political borders of the Albanian state,80 unless we have previously defined “the Albanian people” as the population living within the borders of Albania at a given time.81 Of course, we should not overlook the possibility that the boundaries of these ancient territorial entities had a different nature than those that define today’s states. Today, distinct political entities are physically in contact with each other,\n\n77 See the remarks of Bais (2001: 153–155). 78 Mamedova (1986: 143–144): “Подводя итоги исследования политических границ Албании за длительный период в 1000 лет (III в. до н. э. по VIII в. включительно) можно сказать, что территориальные пределы Албанского государства были почти стабильными”. This view also remains unchanged in Mamedova (2005: 273–307). See also maps 6–12 at the end of the same book. 79 See Bais (2001: 152–153; 156–184). 80 As we read for instance in Mamedova (1986: 87: “пределы албанского народа”). The risk of overlap between the ethnic and the territorial levels is also evident in Mamedova (2005: 244). 81 See Bais (2001: 34–35).\n\n22\n\nMarco Bais\n\ndelimited only by a border line, but this may not necessarily have been the case for the ancient states as well. In some cases, in fact, they may have been separated by border zones, which mediated the contact by making it less direct and continuous.82 Even when the sources indicate the borders of Albania by means of geographical coordinates, the historians’ task is not easy. Sometimes, in fact, the identification of the geographical objects mentioned in the sources (rivers, mountains, etc.) with the elements of the actual landscape is not simple and requires recourse to other disciplines.83 In other cases, the sources may be contradictory. It may even happen that the same author provides pieces of information that appear to be at odds with each other.84 Despite these difficulties, the contribution of classical sources to a better understanding of Albanian historical geography is out of question85 and they cannot be mistrusted just because of their fragmentary or occasionally contradictory nature, nor because of the fact that they may lend themselves to misinterpretations or to partial and tendentious reconstructions. Stating, rather ambiguously, that “[a]s Hewsen rightly pointed out, the modern questions about ancient borders ‘will not be settled by scholars rummaging about in the fragments of data which have come down to us on the ethno-history of southeastern Caucasia two millennia ago’”86 means to contribute to debasing the classical sources by using Robert Hewsen’s authority. However, Hewsen’s studies on the historical geography of Armenia and the Caucasus, in line with the teachings of his master, Cyril Toumanoff, prove exactly the opposite, namely how important he considered it to have knowledge of the historical geography of a given region and how fundamental and indispensable the testimonies of ancient authors are for acquiring such a knowledge. On the other hand, the problems concerning the ancient borders, whether ethnic or political, in the Caucasus is a “modern question”, at least in the sense that it cannot be neglected by today’s historians dealing with the ancient Caucasus. And this is precisely because we are still far from a shared reconstruction of the historical events. 82 See Bais (2001: 149). See also the discussion on this issue in Greatrex (2007: 105–113). 83 This is e.g. the case of the eastern Albanian border. Ptolemy (Geography V, 11.1) makes it coincide with a section of the Caspian littoral whose identification would be made easier by assuming a change in the level of the Caspian Sea; see Murav’ev (1983; 1991); Hewsen (1990). The variations of the Caspian with respect to climate models suggest caution with respect to this hypothesis (see Kislov, Panin & Toropov 2014) which, anyway, should also be investigated on an archaeological basis. 84 See e.g. the data on the Armenian-Albanian border analysed in Bais (2005), an attempt to overcome inconsistencies by looking beyond the complicated Quellengeschichte of many ancient works, which is often believed to be the reason of the contradictions found in them. 85 Bais (2001: 150–151). 86 Fabian (2020: 17).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n23\n\nHaving clarified this, we may state that Hewsen’s words can in no way be related to the problem of the geographical location of ancient Albania but rather refer to the recognition of Karabakh as an autonomous oblast’ within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. He wrote: “Whether this is just or unjust need not detain us here, for this is a political question rather than an academic one and will doubtless be resolved, if it ever is, on the basis of political considerations. It will not be settled by scholars rummaging about in the fragments of data which have come down to us on the ethno-history of southeastern Caucasia two millennia ago”.87 Hewsen thus meant to emphasise the mistake that is made “in placing scholarship at the service of political concerns, which is another matter altogether, and we are reminded, once again, that when such tendentiousness enters the historical arena, scholarship quickly departs”.88 In ancient sources, therefore, we cannot find answers to political questions, but we can certainly search solutions for scholarly questions.\n\n5 The mosaic and the tile: disintegration of history The fragmentary nature of the sources on Caucasian Albania and the awareness of the conditionings that affect every historian, ancient and modern, have probably favoured a new approach to these sources that tends to emphasise the “view” or “image” or “representation” of Albania handed down by this or that author or historiographic tradition.89 Each author treats a certain subject in a way that reflects not only his knowledge of it, but also the circumstances in which he writes, the sources he uses (if any), his way of seeing the world, the political ideology that inspires him, etc. All this affects the writing of his historical narrative to varying degrees, contributing to organising the data he has at his disposal in a certain order and establishing between the events certain causal links that respond to his interpretation of those events. To a certain extent, therefore, consciously or unconsciously, the historian manipulates these data. Thus, ancient authors left us with their idea of Albania or with what they wanted their readership or posterity to know about Albania. In this respect, these authors and historical traditions must be considered not only as mere testimonies of past events, but also in themselves, as mediators, if not creators, of a certain view of the past.\n\n87 Hewsen (1982: 35). 88 Hewsen (1982: 35). 89 Traina (2015); Fabian (2020); Rapp (2020).\n\n24\n\nMarco Bais\n\nIt therefore appears necessary to disassemble our sources, to deconstruct them and analyse the conditions under which they were produced,90 in order to shed light on the reasons why a certain author adopted a given perspective rather than another. This kind of analysis helps to grasp a better knowledge of the author in question, of his ideology, of his cultural context, of the logic of power balances and of the political dynamics of his time, and so on. Ultimately it allows to expand the exploitation of the sources, enabling the historian to draw from them new data that will foster a better understanding of his subject. It is nothing new that our sources give a picture of the past which is partial and cannot in itself be considered a photograph of how things were, assuming that a photograph constitutes an objective representation of reality (which of course it does not). Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrasting a historiography attentive to the cultural and political influences that affected the ancient authors, with a historiography indulging in a “positivistic” approach to the sources which, instead, considers them as a mere “compendium of neutral data points that have happened to survive the vicissitudes of history and are ready to be strung into a representative whole”.91 Besides, accusations of a positivistic use of sources addressed generically to the “scholarship on Albania”92 or to the “historiography on Albania”93 discredit the entire historiographic production dealing with Albania and give the impression that all previous historians have acted with full confidence in the information provided by the sources according to the most blatant positivistic attitude, considering the sources as a wardrobe containing ready-made garments to be chosen and matched in the way most pleasing them. Apart from this unpleasant and vaguely pretentious attitude, one can see an even more serious risk precisely in the tendency to present “views”, “images” or “representations” of the past. When the analysis of the sources and their deconstruction is taken to extremes, they can lead to the disintegration of the historical discourse: “The ‘views from the west’ in antiquity are a particular piece of the puzzle of ancient Albania’s history. Moving beyond the tempting desire to string them together into a cohesive narrative, we reach a more comprehensive understanding of Albania if we instead appreciate them for their ambiguity and fragmentation”.94 There is no doubt that the historians must be aware of the ambiguity and fragmentary nature of the information conveyed by the classical sources\n\n90 91 92 93 94\n\nLe Goff (1982: 443–455); Topolski (1997: 125–127). Fabian (2020: 17). Fabian (2020: 10). Traina (2015: 42). Fabian (2020: 26–27).\n\nCaucasian Albania in Greek and Latin Sources\n\n25\n\non Albania, yet they cannot merely take note of this state of affairs. Instead, they must try to explain this ambiguity and to overcome this fragmentation, also with the help of other sciences ancillary to history, such as archaeology, which may supplement or correct the testimony of ancient authors. Otherwise, they will be simply abdicating the role of the historian, whose work includes the analysis and interpretation of the sources, the collection of data, but also the organisation of the various pieces of information in an overall picture, proposing hypotheses and conjectures to fill the gaps due to lack of information. Only in this way can the historian give a representation of events that approaches the complexity of the reality, going beyond the mere listing of data by reconstructing processes. In other words, through the ancient historians’ gaze on Albania, the modern historians must cast their gaze on that particular historical object, in order to give their own representation of it in turn. And in doing so, the historians must strive to give an overall picture and not limit themselves to illustrate the individual pieces of the puzzle, “for history does not present men with a collection of isolated facts. It organises these facts. It explains them”.95\n\nReferences Abuladze, Ilia. 1938. Илья Абуладзе. К открытию алфавита кавказских албанцев.
