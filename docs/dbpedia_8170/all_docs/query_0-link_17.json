While every conflict constellation has its individual whereabouts and dynamics, the protracted existence of territorial conflicts and the emergence of the-­‐ se new conflicts pose similar questions to their so-­‐called parent-­‐states (e.g. Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) as well as to the international community of states. Apart from broader questions of international and regional security, political and legal status and possible ways of internationalized conflict settlement, actors in the region face a range of everyday-­‐challenges when dealing with the economic and humanitarian situation of the popu-­‐ lations concerned. With all these conflicts being of a ‘pro-­‐ tracted nature’, creative political thinking about effective\n\n4. 2 temporary solutions – ensuring acceptable life conditions while holding status questions open – are of key im-­‐ portance. The workshop aims to develop a deeper under-­‐ standing of the two most recent territorial conflicts in the so-­‐called post-­‐Soviet space and looks for possible transfers of existing expertise and knowledge from other cases in the regions. Contributions with different disciplinary back-­‐ ground reaching from political science, sociology to law and anthropology should address one of the following questions and topics: A. Nature of post-­‐Soviet conflict constellations: What is the specific background of the conflicts in Ukraine, how have they developed since early 2014 and how can the current political status and the situation on the ground (political, economic, humanitarian) be described and analysed? How can scholars and prac-­‐ titioners learn from the experience in similar conflict settings? We encourage speakers to take compara-­‐ tive perspectives, embedding their analysis in the broader context of secessionist and protracted con-­‐ flicts in the post-­‐Soviet space and beyond.\n\n5. 3 B. The Role of International and Non-­‐Governmental Ac-­‐ tors: A second area of interest is the impact of the engagement of the so-­‐called international communi-­‐ ty (e.g. the EU and its member states, the USA, and IGOs) and non-­‐governmental actors on the conflicts under consideration and their resolution. How are the conflicts perceived by foreign-­‐policy makers, which policies and formats have been adopted so far, how effective are they? Could the international community learn or has it already learned from ex-­‐ periences with other post-­‐Soviet territorial conflicts? How much does the involvement of NGOs affect the humanitarian, economic, and ecological situation in the territories concerned, and how are existing ‘cor-­‐ ridors of dialogue’ used by them? C. Opportunities and Obstacles for Conflict Settlement: Under what conditions can the territorial conflicts in Ukraine be effectively transformed and eventually solved? What political settlement options are cur-­‐ rently discussed, how realistic are they, and are there best practice-­‐examples and practices actors can draw upon? What dimensions of conflict resolu-­‐\n\n6. 4 tion are of special importance for the cases con-­‐ cerned (economic reconstruction, transitional jus-­‐ tice) and how can existing expertise and local condi-­‐ tions be reconciled? Organizers are the «German and European Studies» program, located at NaUKMA and based on a cooperation project between NaUKMA and Friedrich-­‐Schiller-­‐University Jena, together with the Research Group “Frozen and Un-­‐ frozen Conflicts” of the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (IOS). The workshop is fi-­‐ nanced by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). We invite applications from young scholars, PhD candi-­‐ dates, early career researchers and Post-­‐Docs, from Ger-­‐ many, Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus and Moldova. Proposals (not more than 250 words) on topics fitting in one of the above prescribed three sub-­‐themes should be sent togeth-­‐ er with a short CV to our workshop assistant (mattia.nelles@gmail.com) no later than 3 December 2017. A limited number of scholarships (based on DAAD-­‐defined rates and categories) covering travel and accommodation expenses are available for successful applicants. Working language of the workshop is English.\n\n7. 5 Organizers: Dr. André Härtel DAAD Associate Professor for “German and European Studies” Political Science Department, National University of Kyiv-­‐ Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA) Dr. Cindy Wittke Leader of the Research Group Frozen and Unfrozen Con-­‐ flicts Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Sebastian Relitz Research Associate Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Contact: Mattia Nelles DAAD Language Assistant Political Science Department, National University of Kyiv-­‐ Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA) (mattia.nelles@gmail.com)\n\n8. 6 Program of the Workshop FRIDAY 26 JANUARY 1:00 pm – 1:20 pm Introduction and Welcoming Re-­‐ marks N.N. and André Härtel, NaUKMA TOPIC A: THE NATURE(S) OF POST-­‐SOVIET CONFLICT CONSTELLATIONS Moderator: André Härtel, NaUKMA 1:30 pm – 3:00 pm PANEL I: “What is Behind the Conflicts in Donbass and Crimea?” “The Conflict in Donbas: A Challenge to the Liberal Script?” Oleksandra Khryshtapovych, Free University of Berlin “The Role of Media in Post-­‐Soviet Conflicts: The Case of Donbass and Crimea” Oleksandr Yaroshchuk, NaUKMA “President Putin’s Policy Towards Crimea Before Annexa-­‐ tion” Agata Łukasiewicz, Cracow University “Competing Interpretations of the Socio-­‐Political Crisis in Ukraine, 2013-­‐2017” Valentin Yakushik, NaUKMA\n\n9. 7 3:00 pm – 3:30 pm Coffee Break 3:30 pm – 5:00 pm PANEL II: “Lessons Learned – Secessionist Conflicts from Comparative Perspectives” “Territorial Integrity vs. Western Integration: Quo Vadis Separatism in Ukraine?“ Harutyun Voskanyan, Civil Consciousness NGO (Yerevan) “Patterns of Conflict between Russia and its Post-­‐Soviet Neighbors 1991-­‐2017” Jonas Driedger, EUI Florence “Secessionist Conflicts and De Facto States in the Post-­‐ Soviet Space and Beyond: Main Findings and Challenges” Sebastian Relitz, IOS 5:45 pm – 7:00 pm ROUNDTABLE: “International and Nongovernmental Organization’s Role in Conflict Management: Practi-­‐ tioners’ Perspectives” Moderator: Maksym Yakovlyev, NaUKMA with Stan Veitsman (UN RCO); Felix Schimansky-­‐Geyer (Kurve Wustrow); Kateryna Zarembo (New Europe Center); Iulia Cozacenko (Consultant, UNDP Moldova)\n\n10. 8 SATURDAY 27 JANUARY TOPIC B: THE ROLES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NON-­‐ GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS IN POST-­‐SOVIET-­‐CONFLICT CONSTELLATIONS Moderator: Sebastian Relitz, IOS 9:30 am – 11:00 am PANEL III: “International Organizations and Conflict Management: Scholarly Perspectives” “The Role of EUAM as a Security Provider: Are the Civilian Instruments Effective for Crisis Management in Ukraine?” Mihai Mogildea, Collegium Civitas, Warsaw “EU Member States Foreign Policies and the Ukraine Crisis” André Härtel, NaUKMA “Real or Void?

The workshop venue is on the old campus of the Mohyla Academy with the official address Hryhoriya Skovorody Street 2. The entrance is not so easy to find. Therefore, someone will take the whole group from the hotel to the venue on the first workshop day on Friday the 26th, 12:30 pm (meeting point in hotel lobby). On Saturday, you can walk there alone. It is an easy walk of about 25 minutes. We would not recommend taking the metro as it would take you more time. Even in the night this walk should be safe. This map shows the way (blue route recommended):\n\n27. 25 Hotel The hotel “Dnipro” is located right at the end of the fa-­‐ mous Kreshchatyk Street on Evropeyska Ploshcha, the site of the so called “Anti-­‐Maidan” during the “Euro-­‐ maidan” in autumn 2013 and later one of the main hot spots of the “Revolution of Dignity”. The Maidan Nezaleshnosti (Independence Square) is just nearby. The hotel is paid for you and breakfast is included. It is an average-­‐priced hotel with 3 stars (booking.com). Legend: 04 = Cooperation Office 10 = Antonovych-­‐Library 14 = NaUKMA Historical and Museum Centre\n\n28. 26 Meals We can guarantee to cover your travel costs up to a cer-­‐ tain amount and the accommodation. We will also make dinner reservations at reasonably priced restaurants for Friday and Saturday and for lunch on Saturday. For all your meals during your stay, you will receive 60 € on Friday in the late afternoon. Please expect to cover the costs until Friday afternoon on your own and change some money directly after your arrival. How do you get back to the airport? We advise to order a taxi at the hotel reception. It would cost at least 300 UAH to Borispil airport. You need ap-­‐ prox. 30 min for the trip, if traffic is normal. Other Useful Information Emergencies: Please check before your departure whether you have a world-­‐wide applicable health-­‐ insurance also covering Ukraine. In any case if something happens to you during your stay, you should call André Härtel first. (+380996216527 Transport/Security: Kyiv is a major city but not to be compared with other major European capitals. Most events of significance take place on a small territory in the so called “upper town” and the old district Podil, where the Academy is located. All major sights are very near to your hotel and in walking distance.\n\n29. 27 The metro runs till app. 1 am and costs 5 UAH a trip. Taxis are cheap (app. 50 UAH for an inner-­‐city trip) but foreigners are often over-­‐charged. So, agree on the price before taking the taxi; most drivers speak a bit of Eng-­‐ lish. Crime is not a problem, but keep an eye on your belongings in crowded places and the metro. The police is generally very friendly and approachable for foreign-­‐ ers. Money: The exchange rate Euro/Hryvnya is app. 1:34 these days. You can take money from ordinary cash ma-­‐ chines, but we would recommend you doing it in safe places such as inside banks or hotels. Weather: Please bring warm clothes and shoes – the temperature can get well below zero degrees in January.

The postgraduate course is conducted at both NaUKMA and the FSU. Germany and the European Union do not only belong to the most important trading partners of Ukraine, but also play an important role in the political sphere, espe-­‐ cially for external relations and the future development of the country. The master program provides the scien-­‐ tific requirements to analyze critical political, legal and economic aspects connected to Germany’s and the Eu-­‐ ropean Union’s historical and contemporary develop-­‐ ment. It also focuses on the international relations of Germany as well as of the EU."
