        "text": "The purpose of my report is to present the Armenian book trade during its formation, by studying the Armenian press from 1512 to 1800. The moveable type printing invention had irrevocably changed the course of book history. During the time, book production made the book an industrial product, a factor in democratization, secularization, and subjectivity. In the Armenian reality, especially among the Armenian population, who settled in urban centers in different countries, this scientific and technological novelty gets a wide reaction, especially in the 17-18 centuries. We can trace this integration process through Armenian publications and “paratexts„ left to us by publishers, patrons, and book owners. Such paratexts (text that exists in parallel to, or alongside, the main text within a book) are Title pages, principal copied colophons, colophons written later, index of the names and etc. The most requested book of all, of course, was the Bible. This religious dominance in book trade reflected the central role of religion in early modern Armenian society. Based on preliminary research, it was found that although spiritual literature remained dominant until the late 1700s, secular literature had already begun to take decisive steps. This study addresses the following issues in the history of Armenian printing: • A study of the 16th to 18th centuries, an important period in the formation of Armenian socio-cultural identity, based on a book product • Specifying the most popular and more printed books of secular and spiritual content • The formation of the printing market and the increase in the number of readers involving children and women • The importance of printed illustrations as an attractive tool for “advertising„ book and vital clues as to what the book contains. Therefore, the reuse of authorship and recognized woodcuts as well.\n\nThe article was one of the keynote addresses at the 13th General Conference of the Association international des études arméniennes (AIEA) held in cooperation with the Matenadaran, the Repository of Ancient Manuscripts, which was responsible for the splendid organization, in Erevan last fall. The exercise was to imagine how an entire volume devoted to the arts of Armenia, one of a projected seven-volume series for the Armenian component of Brill’s Handbook of Oriental Studies, the first volume of which, Armenian Philology, was published last year. Among the topics discussed are: How to define Armenian art. How to treat major and minor arts. Should modern and contemporary be included, if so how? How to integrate Armenian art created in the diaspora. Finally, who is the volume to be directed to? And how to accommodate specialists and at the same time those with little or no knowledge of Armenian art.\n\nIn 1902 Enid Layard bequeathed four illuminated Armenian manuscripts, belonging to her late husband, to the Arme-nian Mekhitarist College of Venice and to the Correr Museum. This survey retraces the manuscripts' earlier provenance and their arrival in the Venetian collections. Austen Henry Layard's private papers and publications attest to a close relationship with the Armenian community, both in Constantinople and Venice. The aim of this paper is not only to show more fully the early reception of Armenian artworks in a Western context, but also to present a first study of these manuscripts by providing some comparisons.\n\nThe Armenian Catholic Parish in Gheorgheni (Harghita county, Romania) houses a rich library of books in different languages (ill. 1). The parish is situated near the Holy Mother of God church, which was built by Armenians in 1733–34. The parish library was created by priests of the church, as indicate the ex librises and possessors’ handwritten inscriptions on the books. This library is an important evidence of the Armenian community in Gheorgheni with its long history. The collection of Armenian manuscripts and printed books of the library is smaller than that of the items in languages other than Armenian. Some publications about manuscripts are already known, yet very little is known about the printed books. The purpose of this study is to present: a) the catalogue of Armenian printed books from 17th to 19th centuries; b) the chronology and topography of these books; c) the information contained in handwritten inscriptions in order to form a certain idea about the Armenian community and its representatives (basically in Transylvania, as these inscriptions testify). It should be noted that the library is currently incomplete. As the inventory numbers reveal, many books from the library are missing. To form an idea about the original state of the library, we kept the existing inventory numbers and assigned numbers only to those books that did not have an inventory number."
