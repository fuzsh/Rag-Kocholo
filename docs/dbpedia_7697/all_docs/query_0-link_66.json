        "text": "Did you know that your local library branch has many new biographies and memoirs available for check-out?\n\nThis week we feature a few new biographies and memoirs that we hope you will enjoy. Happy Reading!\n\nCoco Chanel: The Legend and the Life By Justine Picardie, September 2010, 343 pages\n\nFeared and revered by the rest of the fashion industry, Coco Chanel died in 1971 at the age of 87. But her legacy lives on. Drawing upon her unprecedented access to the Chanel archive, Picardie brings Gabrielle Chanel out of hiding and uncovers the consequences of what Chanel covered up, unpicking the seams between truth and myth in a story that reveals the true heart of fashion.\n\nThis book is an authoritative account of the life of this mysterious fashion icon.\n\nThe Hilliker Curse: My Pursuit of Women By James Ellroy, September 2010, 203 pages\n\nThe year was 1958. James Ellroy was 10 years old. His mother, Jean Hilliker, had divorced her fast-buck hustler husband. She gave her son a choice: live with his father or her. He chose his father, and Jean attacked him. He wished her dead. Three months later, she was murdered.\n\nThis is a gut-wrenching and heart-rending memoir of how this author dealt with his shattered childhood, love affairs, marriages and a nervous breakdown. This is a brilliant, soul-baring memoir, unlike any you will ever read.\n\nWashington: A Life By Ron Chernow, October 2010, 904 pages\n\nThis comprehensive account of the life of George Washington negates the stereotype of a stolid, unemotional man and instead reveals a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions and many moods who fiercely guarded his private life. Renowned biographer Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of Americaâ€™s founding.\n\nWith a dramatic sweep worthy of its giant subject, this book is a commanding work from one of our most elegant storytellers.\n\nHeather Timko\n\nAdult Services Supervisor\n\nStrongsville Branch Library\n\nFor more information on available materials, visit cuyahogalibrary.org or these area branches:\n\nStrongsville, 18700 Westwood Drive, (440) 238-5530\n\nNorth Royalton, 14600 State Road, (440) 237-3800\n\nBrecksville, 9089 Brecksville Road, (440) 526-1102"
