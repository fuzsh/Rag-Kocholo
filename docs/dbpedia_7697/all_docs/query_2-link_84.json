Below is a description of that Act, OMB’s FOIA regulations, as well as a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs). Following the FAQs, you’ll find OMB’s FOIA Library of released records and FOIA reports.\n\nKey OMB FOIA Contacts\n\nFOIA Officer\n\nTim Nusraty\n\nFOIA Public Liaison\n\nMichele Holt\n\nFOIA Office\n\nOffice of Management and Budget\n\n725 17th Street NW, Suite 9272\n\nWashington, DC 20503\n\n(202) 395-FOIA\n\n(202) 395-3504 (fax)\n\nFOIA Requester Service Center: (202) 395-FOIA\n\nE-mail address: OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov\n\nGovernment-wide FOIA.Gov Portal: https://www.foia.gov/ Using the FOIA.gov system is an alternative option for submitting FOIA requests to OMB that allows requesters to create a request using a web-based form. However, requests may still be submitted directly to OMB using the above contact information.\n\nI. The Freedom of Information Act\n\nAs the President stated on December 14, 2005, in his Executive Order 13,392, Improving Agency Disclosure of Information,\n\n“The effective functioning of our constitutional democracy depends upon the participation in public life of a citizenry that is well informed. For nearly four decades, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided an important means through which the public can obtain information regarding the activities of Federal agencies. Under the FOIA, the public can obtain records from any Federal agency, subject to the exemptions enacted by the Congress to protect information that must be held in confidence for the Government to function effectively or for other purposes.”\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552), provides a right of access to the public of government records. The Act also allows the government to withhold certain information in responding to those requests in 9 exemptions, including for national security, deliberative process and attorney client, and confidential business information, to name a few.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAbout OMB:\n\nWhat does OMB do?\n\nWhat offices does OMB have?\n\nWhat types of records does OMB have?\n\nAbout FOIA and how to submit a request:\n\nWhat does FOIA do?\n\nMay I ask a question under the FOIA?\n\nHow do I submit a FOIA request?\n\nWhat are the reasons for not releasing a record requested under a FOIA?\n\nDo I need to submit a particular form to request documents under FOIA?\n\nIs there a fee to submit a FOIA request?\n\nHow long will it take to receive an answer to my FOIA request?\n\nWhat will I receive, in response to my FOIA request?\n\nWhat if I have concerns about the processing of my FOIA request?\n\nMay I ask for my request to be expedited?\n\nAbout the response I receive from OMB:\n\nWhat if I have concerns about the response I receive to my FOIA request?\n\nHow do I appeal OMB’s response to my FOIA request?\n\nWhen will I hear back on my appeal?\n\nAbout documents OMB has:\n\nAre there records that OMB has that I can look at (inspect) without filing a FOIA request?\n\nBack to Top\n\nAbout OMB:\n\nWhat does OMB do?\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is an agency within the Executive Office of the President. OMB assists the President in the discharge of his budgetary, management, and other executive responsibilities. More specifically, OMB assists the President in the preparation of the Federal budget and in managing its execution by the agencies. OMB works to assure that proposed legislation (as well as testimony, reports and policies) is consistent with Administration policies, including the President’s Budget. OMB also has a central role in providing leadership in the development, oversight and coordination of the Federal government’s policies in procurement, financial management and the information, statistical, and regulatory arenas as well as in the implementation of those policies. OMB promotes better program management, strengthens administrative management, develops agency-performance measures and improves coordination of the Executive Branch’s various operations.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nWhat offices does OMB have?\n\nOMB has offices in the Eisenhower and New Executive Office Buildings in Washington, D.C. (OMB does not have regional or field offices.) OMB staff are divided into the following offices:\n\nthe OMB Director’s office;\n\nseveral small staff offices (General Counsel, Legislative Affairs, Strategic Planning and Communications, Management and Operations, and Economic Policy)\n\nthe Budget Review Division (which provides support in the development and execution of the Federal budget)\n\nthe Legislative Reference Division (which develops and supports the President’s management and budget agenda by carrying out OMB’s interagency legislative review function);\n\nfive Resource Management Offices (which develop and support the President’s budget); and\n\nfour statutory offices:\n\nthe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,\n\nthe Office of Federal Financial Management,\n\nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and\n\nthe Office of Electronic Government and Information Technology. Back to FAQs\n\nWhat types of records does OMB have?\n\nYou can find out about the type of records OMB has in our reading room, which is organized by subject matter, such as Grants, or the President’s Budget.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nAbout FOIA and how to submit a request:\n\nWhat does FOIA do?\n\nAs noted above, FOIA provides a right of access to the public of government records. The Act also allows the government to withhold certain information in responding to those requests in 9 exemptions, including for national security, deliberative process and attorney client, and confidential business information, to name a few.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nMay I ask a question under the FOIA?\n\nPlease be aware that FOIA does not require agencies to do research, analyze data, answer written questions, or to create records in order to respond to a request.It is also important to understand that there is no central office in the government which processes FOIA requests for all agencies; each Federal agency responds to FOIA requests for records in its own files. Thus, the public may submit FOIA requests to OMB to obtain records that are in OMB’s files.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nHow do I submit a FOIA request?\n\nIndividuals wishing to file a FOIA request must write a letter to submit a FOIA request. Address your letter to: Dionne Hardy, FOIA Officer\n\nOffice of Management and Budget\n\n725 17th Street NW, Suite 9204\n\nWashington, DC 20503\n\nE-mail address: OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov\n\nPlease note that for security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail may be delayed. Therefore, you may also fax your letter to: 202.395.3504. You should be as specific as possible in your request for records (see below for records you can receive without submitting a FOIA request). Please describe the specific records you are requesting in sufficient detail so that the records can be located with a reasonable amount of effort. You should also consult OMB’s FOIA regulations, which outline the procedures governing the FOIA request process. Upon receipt of a FOIA request, the FOIA Officer will determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such request whether it is appropriate to grant the request. (Please be aware that the time period for providing a response may be extended under the FOIA.) OMB will provide a written response to the FOIA request; if the request is denied in whole or in part, OMB will notify the requester of the denial, and of the requester’s right to file an appeal within OMB. If OMB denies an appeal in whole or in part, the requester may seek judicial review of that denial. Back to FAQs\n\nWhat are the reasons for not releasing a record requested under the FOIA?\n\nThe FOIA statute provided reasons why an agency may not release a requested record. Such records are considered to be legally exempt from release. Among the reasons for withholding a document are the following exemptions from disclosure:\n\nExemption (b)(1) National Security\n\nExemption (b)(2) Internal Documents\n\nExemption (b)(3) Statutory withholding\n\nExemption (b)(4) Commercial or proprietary data\n\nExemption (b)(5) Predecisional, deliberative communications\n\nExemption (b)(6) Privacy\n\nExemption (b)(7) Law enforcement\n\nExemption (b)(8) Financial institutions\n\nExemption (b)(9) Geological information Back to FAQs\n\nDo I need to submit a particular form to request documents under FOIA?\n\nNo. However, in order to process your request, you need to reasonably describe the records you are looking for, providing as much information as possible (in order for OMB to search for them). OMB may also contact you to request that you provide more detail.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nIs there a fee to submit a FOIA request?\n\nOMB, like other agencies, may charge a fee for responding to your FOIA request. The amount of fee depends on who you are and why you are making a FOIA request. The FOIA Act divides requesters into four categories for fees, as described below. In addition, in certain circumstances, OMB may request advance payment of fees. You may also indicate, in your letter, how much in fees you are willing to pay, before OMB needs to contact you. Back to FAQs\n\nHow long will it take to receive an answer to my FOIA request?\n\nThe FOIA Act gives OMB a minimum of 20 working days (that’s excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) to respond to your request. OMB can also extend that time period an additional 10 working days (OMB will send you a letter when that occurs). As noted above, due to security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail could be delayed; the 20-day time period only begins when OMB has received your letter.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nWhat will I receive in response to my FOIA request?\n\nOMB will send you a letter responding to your FOIA request. If we have located records in response to your request, our letter will tell you that. If we have located records, but have withheld any part of them, our letter will tell you of your right to file an appeal within OMB (see below for how to file an appeal). If OMB denies an appeal in whole or in part, the requester may seek judicial review of that denial.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nWhat if I have concerns about the processing of my FOIA request?\n\nOMB has a FOIA Requester Service Center. You can call the FOIA Requester Service Center at: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). The FOIA Requester Service Center is available to assist you in answering questions that you have about your request. If you are not satisfied with the assistance you receive from the FOIA Requester Service Center or they cannot assist you, you may also leave a message for OMB’s Public Liaison: (202) 395-FOIA (3642).\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nMay I ask for my request to be expedited?\n\nOMB’s regulations provide for how someone can request expedited processing. Generally, you can request expedited processing if you demonstrate in your request letter to OMB one of the following:\n\nCircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\nAn urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;\n\nThe loss of substantial due process rights; or\n\nA matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government’s integrity which effect public confidence.\n\nOMB will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 working days. At the present time, OMB does not have multi-track processing (which means that OMB staff works on requests as they come in; there is not a first-in-first-out queue that your request comes in). Back to FAQs\n\nAbout the response I receive from OMB:\n\nWhat if I have concerns about the response I receive to my FOIA request?\n\nAs noted above, OMB has a FOIA Requester Service Center. You can call the FOIA Requester Service Center at: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). The FOIA Requester Service Center is also available to assist you in answering questions that you have about OMB’s response to your request. If you are not satisfied with the assistance you receive from the FOIA Requester Service Center or they cannot assist you, you may also leave a message for OMB’s Public Liaison: (202) 395-FOIA (3642).\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nHow do I appeal OMB’s response to my FOIA request?\n\nSend your appeal, in another letter, to the same address as before: Dionne Hardy, FOIA Officer\n\nOffice of Management and Budget,\n\n725 17th Street NW, Suite 9204\n\nWashington, DC 20503\n\nE-mail address: OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov\n\nPlease note that for security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail may be delayed. Therefore, you may also fax your letter to: (202) 395-FOIA (3642). Although it is not required, it is helpful to OMB in processing your appeal request if you include a copy of your original request letter as well as OMB’s response. Back to FAQs\n\nWhen will I hear back on my appeal?\n\nThe FOIA Act gives OMB a minimum of 20 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) to respond to your appeal request. OMB can also extend that time period an additional 10 working days (OMB will send you a letter when that occurs). As noted above, due to security reasons, OMB’s receipt and processing of mail could be delayed; the 20-day time period only begins when OMB has received your letter.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\nAbout documents OMB has:\n\nAre there records that OMB has that I can look at (inspect), without filing a FOIA request?\n\nOMB makes available in its Public Reading Room and in the Regulatory/Paperwork Records Management Center information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by OMB; these are commonly known as “reading room materials.” These materials include the Federal Budget, OMB Circulars, selected OMB Bulletins, regulations and information collections reviewed by OMB, other policies and management documents, and OMB’s Annual FOIA Report. Many of these documents are also available through OMB’s Internet Home Page. Visitors to the public reading area must write or telephone ahead (see below for details) to make an appointment. Security in the New Executive Office Building prevents visitors from entering the building without an appointment.\n\nOMB’s Public Reading Room: OMB’s public reading area is located in the Executive Office of the President Library, Room G-102, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-FOIA (3642). Back to FAQ\n\nFOIA Library\n\nMany of OMB’s documents are available to the public without having to make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. These documents are called “proactive disclosures” because they are proactively posted online. Documents which are disclosed in the interest of transparency and documents which have been requested frequently under FOIA are provided below. Additional OMB documents including circulars and bulletins can be found by using the search tool on this page.\n\nCALENDARS OF DIRECTOR YOUNG\n\n2023\n\nJanuary February March\n\n2022\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August September October November December\n\n2021\n\nMarch April May June July August September October November December\n\nCALENDARS OF ACTING DIRECTOR FAIRWEATHER\n\n2021\n\nJanuary February March\n\nCalendars of Director Vought\n\n2021\n\nJanuary\n\n2020\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\nJuly August September October November\n\nDecember\n\n2019\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\nJuly August September October November\n\nDecember\n\nCalendars of Director Mulvaney\n\n2018\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\nJuly August September October November\n\nDecember\n\n2017\n\nFebruary March April May June\n\nJuly August September October November\n\nDecember\n\nCalendars of Acting Director Sandy\n\n2017\n\nJanuary\n\nCalendars for additional months are being processed and will be released in the future on a rolling basis.\n\nOMB Visitor Records\n\nJanuary 2017 February-March 2017 April 2017 May 2017\n\nJune-September 2017 October 2017-January 2018\n\nFebruary 2018 March 2018 April 2018 May 2018\n\nJune 2018 July 2018 August 2018 September 2018 October 2018\n\nNovember 2018 December 2018 January 2019 February 2019\n\nMarch 2019 April 2019 May 2019 June 2019 July 2019\n\nAugust 2019 September 2019 October 2019 November 2019\n\nDecember 2019 January 2020 February 2020 March 2020\n\nApril 2020 May 2020 June 2020 July 2020 August 2020\n\nSeptember 2020 October 2020 November 2020 December 2020\n\nVisitor logs posted pursuant to President Biden’s voluntary disclosure policy are available here.\n\nPublic Comments on Government-wide Reform\n\nPosted here are the public comments and suggestions received in response to Executive Order 13781 (Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch) and OMB Memorandum M-17-22 (Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government and Reducing the Federal Civilian Workforce).
