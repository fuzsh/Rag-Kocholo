        "text": "Facts\n\nInternational Shoe Co. was a business incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Missouri. It employed about a dozen salesmen in the state of Washington, who were residents of that state paid by commissions on their sales. International Shoe did not own any property or have a permanent location in Washington, since the salesmen used hotels and rented spaces to interact with potential clients. This system was designed to restrict the company's location to Missouri, although the business earned about $30,000 annually from customers in Washington.\n\nThe state enacted a tax on companies doing business there that functioned as a mandatory contribution to its Unemployment Compensation Fund. When International Shoe failed to comply with the tax, the state of Washington served a notice of assessment on one of the resident salesmen and sent a letter by registered mail to the company's Missouri headquarters. International Shoe tried to forestall the case at the outset by moving that it be dismissed for a lack of personal jurisdiction. This argument failed at every level of the state court system.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nHarlan Fiske Stone (Author)\n\nStanley Forman Reed\n\nFelix Frankfurter\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nFrank Murphy\n\nJohn Rutledge\n\nHarold Hitz Burton\n\nAnalyzing the level of contact between International Shoe and the state of Washington, Stone found that due process was satisfied by personal service on the salesman and mailing the registered letter to the corporate headquarters. He felt that the tax was constitutional and the interstate nature of International Shoe's operations did not exempt it from contributions. The opinion articulated the standard of \"minimum contacts\" that gave rise to much modern jurisprudence in the area of personal jurisdiction. Stone ruled that a forum is proper if establishing jurisdiction over the defendant there would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. He also divided types of contact into systematic and continuous contact as opposed to casual contact. In the former situation, any type of claim may be brought against a defendant. In the latter situation, only claims related to the contact with the state can be brought there.\n\nConcurrence\n\nHugo Lafayette Black (Author)\n\nBlack argued that the majority did not go far enough in giving states the ability to claim jurisdiction over corporate defendants from outside their borders.\n\nRecused\n\nRobert Houghwout Jackson (Author)\n\nCase Commentary\n\nTraditionally, non-foreign corporations could be brought into a court only by consent, by being present in a state through doing business there, or a combination. These theories became outdated as interstate commerce grew, and this decision shows that corporations can be sued in many states in a broad range of situations. States now have long arm statutes that have codified this type of jurisdiction, which may be essential in view of the increasingly fluid economy and the tendency of corporations to do business nationwide."
