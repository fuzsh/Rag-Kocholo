        "text": "What Are They?\n\nPeriodical cicadas are insects that spend most of their lives underground as nymphs, feeding off the sap of tree roots. They emerge to transform into adults and mate. Some periodical cicadas emerge every 13 years and others emerge every 17 years. The males \"sing\" by vibrating a membrane on the sides of their bodies.\n\nAfter mating, the female makes slits in tree branches and lays eggs there. The eggs hatch six to seven weeks later, the nymphs fall to the ground and go into the soil, and the cycle begins again. The adult periodical cicadas only live three to four weeks.\n\nTwo Broods of Periodical Cicadas Will Emerge in the United States in 2024\n\nPeriodical cicadas emerge in groups called broods. Starting in late April, Brood XIII (the Northern Illinois Brood, which has a 17-year life cycle) and Brood XIX (the Great Southern Brood, which has a 13-year cycle) will emerge from underground in the Midwest and Southeast, respectively. These two broods have not emerged at the same time since 1803! Experts estimate these emergences could produce more than one trillion cicadas. But don't worry — they don't bite. (Source: Smithsonian Magazine article, April 8, 2024)\n\nTeaching Resources: Natural History of Cicadas\n\nWe compiled this collection of digital resources and experiences in 2021 to explore the natural history of cicadas during the Brood X emergence. The resources are all complementary, aiming to help students, teachers, and anyone interested learn a bit more about cicadas.\n\nThe interactive module linked at the top is the most robust experience, and integrates the other digital media resources that are also listed on this page.\n\nInteractive Lesson\n\nUnderstanding a cicada’s life history can help quell fears about them and even spark curiosity and interest in them. This interactive module, The Natural History of Cicadas, will provide learners with an overview of the natural history of cicadas through videos, audio, images, graphics, and text. Each section of the lesson concludes with a fun interactive that reinforces learning, helping your learners gain these skills:\n\nSort basic natural history statements about cicadas as true or false\n\nMatch each life cycle stage to the correct description\n\nRecall what a cicada eats and identify the type of mouthparts a cicada has\n\nIdentify a periodical cicada from an annual cicada and recall how much time it spends underground\n\nSort statements about periodical cicada emergence events as true or false\n\nCicada Life Cycle\n\nThere are about 3,000 species of cicadas worldwide and they all have a similar life cycle. This video provides a brief overview.\n\nFeeling curious, nervous, or excited about the cicada emergence? This podcast is for you! Learn about cicadas and the Brood X emergence in 2021 directly from an expert: Smithsonian Entomologist Floyd Shockley. The podcast was moderated and produced by museum educator Maggy Benson.\n\nPart 1: Natural history of cicadas, the Brood X emergence, and cicada adaptations\n\nPart 2: How museums collect cicadas and you can track cicadas, too!\n\nPart 3: What to expect with the Brood X emergence in 2021\n\nVisit the Cicada Safari App webpage to learn more about tracking cicadas and using the app that Floyd mentioned in the podcast!\n\nWebinar Video\n\nSmithsonian Science How – Cicadas and the Brood X Emergence with Entomologist Floyd Shockley\n\nBrood X, one of the broods of periodical cicadas that spends 17 years underground as nymphs, emerged in the Eastern United States in 2021. In this video, Smithsonian Entomologist Floyd Shockley teaches us about these cicadas, their special adaptations and life cycle and unique things about their natural history that you may not have known. Floyd joins us from the National Museum of Natural History, where he shows viewers live cicadas and cicadas preserved in the Smithsonian's Entomology collection. This Zoom webinar aired May 26, 2021. Watch the cicada webinar video.\n\nLearn more about Floyd Shockley in this short \"Scientist Spotlight\" video. In it, Floyd shares how he came to be interested in insects, why there isn't any one way to do science or be a scientist, and how all people are doing science every day, even if they don't realize it.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nOnline School Program: Insect Illustration\n\nField Book Activity: Making and Recording Observations (including of cicadas)\n\nArticle: Cicadas (from the Encyclopedia of Life)\n\nSmithsonian Magazine: Meet Benjamin Banneker, the Black Scientist Who Documented Brood X Cicadas in the Late 1700s\n\nCicada Origami (PDF)\n\nCredits\n\nImage at top of page by James St. John, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr.
