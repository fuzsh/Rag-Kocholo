        "text": "Although hundreds of books have written about our first president, George Washington, that should not be a reason to pass up the one published this month. \"Washington: A Life\" (The Penguin Press, $40), Ron Chernow's account of the statesman's times, accomplishments and personality, is likely the most thorough one-volume biography ever written about the great man.\n\nDon't expect it to make bookstores rich, though. At almost a thousand pages, it is too cumbersome to tote to the dentist's office or read while waiting at school for the kids to bounce out the door. To read it in bed is not an option, either, because of the small type. If all that is not enough, there's the matter of the price: $40.\n\nThe book, however, does offer rare insights. Washington's early life is examined closely, including the observation, \"The young man was highly responsive to female charms.\" While the reader is told how he once \"dallied\" with one young woman while smitten by another, we are spared anything graphic.\n\nWashington's marriage to widow Martha Custis assured him a life of wealth. His taste for fine clothing and the costly entertaining at the Mount Vernon mansion left Washington at times with cash-flow problems even though he was rich in land and slaves.\n\nAn interesting facet of the book is his relationship with his stepson, with such men as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, and with those who fought under him in the Revolutionary War.\n\nWashington was politically ambitious without wanting to appear so. Likely, he would have wanted people to believe God just appeared on the road one day and said, \"George, you have to be the first president of this new nation.\" Instead, he made all the right moves and spent considerable energy to get that post.\n\nChernow is author of five previous books, including \"Alexander Hamilton\" and \"Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\" Research on the Hamilton book aided immensely in writing about Washington. The genius of Hamilton and of Jefferson exceeded that of Washington, but their personal lives may not have been as circumspect, and their concern about image was not as strong.\n\nNo regrets from my standpoint about reading the book. Kept me out of the pool halls, and I'm too old to be \"responsive to female charms.\" (Well, almost.) Aw, go ahead and take it to the dentist's office."
