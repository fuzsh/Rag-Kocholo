        "text": "These pages summarize the Federal position classification appeals process. Throughout these pages, \"you\" refers to a current Federal employee, \"we\" or \"us\" refers to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and \"classification appeal\" refers to classification appeals by General Schedule (GS) employees and job grading appeals by Federal Wage System (FWS) employees.\n\nThe decisions posted on these pages provide useful occupational information, classification analysis, factor level accreditation patterns, and interpretations of the governing criteria. As a classification or job grading standard or guide is updated, classification appeal decisions issued using the old standard or guide may be deleted.\n\nYou must file a classification or job grading appeal in writing.\n\nEarlier Decisions\n\nRedaction of names and other non-Privacy Act-protected identifying information from appeal decisions was discontinued in 2015.\n\nHow to Use Our Classification Appeal Decisions\n\nThe classification appeal decisions posted on these pages do not substitute for or add to position classification or job grading standards and guides and are not \"case law.\" Further, these decisions should not be used as the basis for other classification determinations for two reasons. First, section 5107 of title 5, United States Code, prohibits the classification of positions on the basis of position-to-position comparisons. Second, these decisions do not provide enough information for direct application in the classification of other positions.\n\nCautions\n\nThese decisions are provided with the following cautionary notes:\n\nYou must keep in mind that the decisions are taken out of context. Neither the actual position description nor the appeal case file is provided to supplement the decision.\n\nEach decision relates to a specific position and may not provide an appropriate basis for extrapolation to other positions.\n\nEach decision provides an interpretation of classification standards and guides in force at the time the case was decided appropriate for the circumstances of the position in question. This interpretation may not be appropriate for other positions given the different ways similar work may be accomplished, alternative interpretations of the flexibilities that may be allowed in the classification standards and guides, and the specific conditions associated with the work of the position being considered.\n\nOPM Decision Numbers\n\nAn OPM decision number identifies decisions. The 12-character decision number is made up of C (for classification appeal), 4 digits for the OPM-certified occupational series of the position, 2 digits for the OPM-certified grade of the position, and 2 digits for the number of the decision for that particular series and grade.\n\nFor example, the decision number C-0802-11-02 indicates that it is a classification appeal decision for a position in the 0802 Engineering Technician occupational series at the grade 11 level and is the second decision issued with that series and grade determination.\n\nIf the grade is 00 or the series is 0000, that indicates we made a determination on only the series or the pay system; that is, whether the position should be in the Federal Wage System or the General Schedule.\n\nThe Order of Decisions\n\nThe decisions in the General Schedule, Federal Wage System and Pay System tables are listed in numerical order by occupational series and within series by grade.\n\nOutcome Entries\n\nThe following entries describe our classification appeal decision. If the OPM-certified pay system or occupational series or grade differs from the pay system or occupational series or grade assigned to the position by the agency, we note only what the difference is.\n\nNo Change\n\nThe OPM-certified pay system, occupational series, and grade matches the pay system, occupational series, and grade assigned to the position by the agency.\n\nNew Pay System\n\nThe OPM-certified pay system differs from the pay system assigned to the position by the agency.\n\nNew Series\n\nThe OPM-certified series differs from the series assigned to the position assigned by the agency.\n\nUpgraded\n\nThe OPM-certified grade is higher than the grade assigned to the position by the agency.\n\nDowngraded\n\nThe OPM-certified grade is lower than the grade assigned to the position by the agency.\n\nAbout Grade Changes\n\nAlthough the OPM-certified grade may be higher or lower than the grade assigned by the agency, this does not necessarily mean the grade of the employee in the position will automatically go up or down. An agency has a number of options available to it when complying with an OPM classification decision. Regardless of our decision, the employee's agency still has full control over the assignment of duties to a position and who performs those duties. Any personnel action affecting an employee resulting from our classification appeal decision will be taken by the employee's agency.\n\nQuestions\n\nBecause of the detailed information required and the fact finding and analysis work we must do in a classification appeal case, we cannot respond to specific questions about your individual situation. Specific questions about your own position should be addressed to your agency's human resources office. If you have general questions about a particular classification appeal decision, please contact the OPM office serving your area.\n\nBack to Top\n\nYou must file a classification or job grading appeal in writing.\n\nInfo that Should be Included in a Position Classification Appeal Filed with OPM\n\nYou may have a representative (designated in writing) help you prepare and submit your appeal case, but the representative cannot be someone with management or classification authority over your position. You or your designated representative, who must be designated in writing, should send your appeal to\n\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\n\nClassification Appeals and FLSA Claims Program Manager\n\n1900 E. ST NW Room 6484\n\nWashington, DC 20415\n\n* OPM will accept electronic filings of classification appeals during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, you should also follow up with a written, signed, and dated copy of the appeal request sent to the above address. Appeals can be sent to FEDCLASS_APPEALS.INTERNET@opm.gov.\n\nIf you decide to submit a classification appeal to us, it should contain the following information in writing and must be signed by you or your duly authorized representative:\n\nYour name, email address, mailing address, and commercial office telephone number;\n\nThe present classification of your position and the requested classification;\n\nThe name of the department or agency and the office in which you work;\n\nThe name, mailing and email address of the servicing Human Resources office having classification authority over the appealed position;\n\nThe city where you are employed and the installation's mailing address;\n\nA copy of your official position description and either a statement affirming that it is accurate or a detailed explanation of the inaccuracies and an explanation of the efforts made to correct the position description;\n\nAny additional information about the position that will aid in understanding it; and\n\nArguments supporting the requested classification by referencing the appropriate classification standards.\n\nSpecific Requirements for Filing a Federal Wage System (FWS) Job Grading Appeal with OPM\n\nIf you are a FWS employee, you must first appeal to your agency. If you are dissatisfied with your agencyâ€™s decision, you may then appeal to OPM.\n\nYour appeal to OPM must be filed within 15 calendar days of the date you receive your agency's decision. You must specify that part of your agency's decision with which you disagree. OPM may extend the time limit for filing if circumstances beyond your control prevented you from filing within 15 days, or if you were not notified or were otherwise unaware of the 15-day time limit.\n\nOPM Fact Finding\n\nOur appeal decision is based on information supplied by you and your agency. If we need additional information, we will call, write, or visit the work site. If we conduct an interview or desk audit, you will be the only person present unless you are in a General Schedule position and we ask another person to participate. We do not conduct appeal hearings\n\nWhen we conduct fact finding, it is important that you emphasize the major areas of your work and how your position fits into your unit's and agency's operations. Most importantly, do not understate or exaggerate your duties and responsibilities.\n\nEffective Dates and Back Pay\n\nThe effective date of a classification appeal decision can be retroactive only if it corrects a classification action that resulted in an actual decrease in pay.\n\nIn order for the decision to be made retroactive, the employee must appeal the classification to either the agency or the Office of Personnel Management, but not both at the same time, within 15 calendar days after the effective date of the reclassification action.\n\nRetroactivity may be based only on duties and responsibilities existing at the time of demotion and cannot be based on duties and responsibilities assigned later.\n\nCancellation or Withdrawal of an Appeal\n\nYou may withdraw your appeal at any time before we issue a decision.\n\nWe may cancel your appeal if you or your designated representative fail to provide requested information or if you leave the position that is being appealed.\n\nCautionary Note\n\nThese pages explain the position classification appeals process available to current employees of the United States Federal Government. Former employees of the United States Federal Government may not file a classification appeal.\n\nYou should be aware that there might be a delay between official publication of materials and their change or appearance on these pages. We will make every effort to correct errors that come to our attention.\n\nThe Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations, published by the National Archives and Records Administration, remain the official sources for regulations published by the Office of Personnel Management. The Office of Personnel Management's regulations for classification appeals for General Schedule employees are in subpart F of part 511 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations for job grading appeals for Federal Wage System employees are in subpart G of part 532 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. You must file a classification or job grading appeal in writing. However, you may send comments or general questions to us electronically.\n\nWhy You Must File a Classification Appeal in Writing\n\nYou must file a classification appeal in writing because the appeal must have an original signature by you or your designated representative. Additionally, a classification appeal frequently contains supporting documentation such as position descriptions, organizational charts, and work samples that are not available electronically.\n\nPlease see our frequently asked questions section if you have any additional questions about how to file a classification appeal.\n\nBack to Top"
