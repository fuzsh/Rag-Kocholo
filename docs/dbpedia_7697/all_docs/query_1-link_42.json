        "text": "I knew I was in for more than light summer reading when I purchased Ron Chernow's biography of George Washington. But fortunately, I was never tempted to use the hefty book, which runs well over 800 pages, merely as a paperweight on the living room table. With extensive research and compelling prose, Chernow manages to topple the marble man of American myth and reveal a far more complex, interesting and, ultimately, more heroic figure than the early mythmakers constructed.\n\nAppropriately enough, I finished \"George Washington: A Life,\" a few days before the nation's 235th birthday. I now have a much richer understanding of why Washington was called the father of our country. And from this majestic narrative of his life, I've acquired new insights about the crucial importance of political leadership.\n\nChernow makes clear that this reserved Virginia planter and conflicted slave owner was the indispensable man of the Revolution, the glue that held the fledgling nation together through the trials of war and the fractious early days of the republic. The concept of nation building takes on new meaning when you read Chernow's account of how Washington struggled to sustain a sense of unity and national purpose among colonists who rarely looked beyond state and regional interests.\n\nWe tend to think that Americans were driven to triumph over England by the love of freedom and patriotic fervor. In truth, many colonists identified with the mother country and rejected the founders' call to arms. Washington spent as much time rallying public support for the cause as he spent on the battlefield.\n\nThe ideas and ideals of the Revolution changed the world, but Chernow's book forced me to consider whether the ideals would have faltered without Washington's awe-inspiring leadership. I don't use the word \"awe-inspiring\" lightly; if there ever was an American who inspired awe among his or her fellow citizens, it was George Washington.\n\nChernow describes Washington's rise \"to new heights of renown\" in the wake of his army's successive victories in the battles of Trenton and Princeton. One newspaper wrote that \"had he lived in the days of idolatry,\" Washington would have \"been worshipped as a god.\"\n\nWashington's reputation didn't depend on military success; his army lost about as many battles as it won. He was an outstanding strategist -- he understood that he needed to wear down the British instead of trying to defeat them in decisive, European-style battles -- but he occasionally blundered in the heat of combat.\n\nUnlike Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, the man from Mount Vernon was not a brilliant political theorist. He did not possess the genius of Ben Franklin, America's Renaissance man. He was not a powerful orator like Patrick Henry; a bout with pleurisy left Washington with a thin, breathy voice.\n\nChernow writes that \"his contemporaries admired him not because he was a plaster saint or an empty uniform but because they sensed his unseen power.\"\n\nWhat was the source of this power?\n\nHis physical appearance was certainly part of his charisma. According to Chernow, the portraits of Washington painted during his presidency don't capture the muscular, handsome, physically graceful man described by his contemporaries.\n\nBut good looks and physical presence can't come close to accounting for the effect he had on so many Americans, including people who knew him well. That unseen power emanated from his character. Washington's amazing life is irrefutable proof that character counts.\n\nWhen I talk about character, I don't mean Washington was a goody-two-shoes like the never-tell-a-lie fellow depicted in the Parson Weems biography. Chernow's book reveals that he was vain, ambitious and inclined to luxurious living that, even with all of his wealth as a landowner and slaveholder, kept him on the brink of financial trouble through most of his adult life. Though he usually appeared reserved and even aloof, he struggled to control his emotions, especially his volcanic temper.\n\nAs the owner of hundreds of human beings, he was deeply implicated in America's original sin of slavery. Washington privately deplored the \"peculiar institution,\" but the fragile state of his finances kept him from acting on his principles. In his will, he freed the slaves he owned and provided pensions for the older African Americans who had worked on his plantation.\n\nWashington never spoke out publicly against slavery, fearing that his endorsement of emancipation would divide the states and destroy the new republic. This was, by far, Washington's greatest political and moral failure. But his inability to put his principles into practice must be viewed through the lens of the era in which he lived, a time when the concept of human equality, expressed so powerfully in the Declaration of Independence, had not yet taken root.\n\nWashington's hesitancy on the issue of slavery contrasts with the courage he displayed on the battlefield and in the political disputes that threatened to tear the country apart after the Revolution. He showed no fear of bullets or the ferociously personal attacks directed at him during his presidency.\n\nIn war and in politics, he was never selfish, petty or vindictive. A key sentence from the book points to a quality that set him apart from most of his contemporaries -- and certainly from many political leaders today. \"He was always careful to separate the personal from the political, the man from the mission,\" Chernow writes.\n\nWashington inspired respect, admiration and even awe because he was brave, displayed an iron will and remarkable self control and -- most important -- because he rose above personal concerns and selflessly pursued a higher calling.\n\nAfter reading \"George Washington: A Life,\" I'm convinced that had Washington been a lesser man than the one described so vividly in the book, we would not be celebrating American independence tomorrow. The Declaration of Independence provided a heart and soul for the Revolution, but George Washington supplied the backbone and strength needed to make a nation."
