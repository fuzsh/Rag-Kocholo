        "text": "Looking for ways to learn about the first American president? Good news: I’ve got a great list of George Washington books for kids to help you learn!\n\n*This post contains affiliate links; see disclosure for details.*\n\nThis list is a good mix of older favorite George Washington books as well as newer titles that are likely to be loved for years to come.\n\nIt also includes fiction and nonfiction, along with chapter books and picture books. Regardless of what type of George Washington book you’re looking for, you’ll find it here. :)\n\nGeorge Washington Books for Kids\n\nBefore we jump into the book options, keep in mind that links in the descriptions below all lead to Amazon. If you prefer to support independent bookstores through your purchases, see my similar list on bookshop.org. It has most of these titles, plus some extras not included here.\n\n1. George Washington for Kids\n\nIf you’re only able to get one book from this list of George Washington books for kids, this is a great one to consider. It’s a comprehensive look at his life and background, but also includes lots of hands-on ideas and cultural and historical details to help readers understand the world in which he lived.\n\n2. Who Was George Washington?\n\nWho Was George Washington? is a great biography option for kids who are ready to go beyond picture books, but aren’t quite ready for a longer read.\n\nI like this one because it includes helpful illustrations, maps, and a timeline, but can also serve as a light read aloud for elementary kids learning about the first American president.\n\n3. George Washington\n\nIngri and Edgar Parin d’Aulaire’s George Washington book is a great one to turn to while learning about Washington or the birth of the United States in general. With its comprehensive text and lithograph illustrations, it’s engaging, informative, and tells Washington’s story well.\n\n4. I Am George Washington\n\nBrad Meltzer’s I Am George Washington is perfect for preschoolers and early elementary kiddos who are learning about George Washington. It’s from his Ordinary People Change the World series and features conversational text and cartoon-style illustrations.\n\n5. A Picture Book of George Washington\n\nDavid Adler’s A Picture Book of George Washington is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a basic overview of George Washington’s life paired with simple, but nice illustrations, making it another good option to share with younger kids.\n\n6. George Washington\n\nNational Geographic’s George Washington reader is a good option if you’re looking for something other than picture books or traditional biographies. It’s full of colorful photos and illustrations and the layout is especially nice for visual learners.\n\n7. Take the Lead, George Washington\n\nJudith St. George’s Take the Lead, George Washington is a colorful picture book about Washington’s adventurous early years.\n\n8. George Washington and the General’s Dog\n\nThis Step Into Reading book is a fun one. It shares a lesser-known story about George Washington and a dog in battle, but also includes a photo of a letter from the first president about the incident.\n\n9. Revolutionary War on Wednesday\n\nMary Pope Osborne’s Revolutionary War on Wednesday isn’t exclusively about George Washington, but it follows Magic Tree House characters Jack and Annie as they travel back in time and help General Washington in a crucial time. While it’s a fictional account, it’s a great way to get younger kids interested in Washington and the American Revolution.\n\nAlso, since it is a fun fictional story, it pairs nicely with the nonfiction American Revolution fact tracker and the corresponding teacher resources on the Magic Tree House website.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the free Magic Tree House resources, you can find them by clicking the Teachers button when you enter the website, entering your date of birth, and then clicking the Resources tab.\n\nThat Resources tab has trivia, printable reading certificates, and tips for using the books to teach, as well as free printables to go along with most of the Magic Tree House books.\n\n10. George Washington, Our First Leader\n\nThis title from the Childhood of Famous Americans series is a great choice for focusing on Washington’s formative years. At nearly 200 pages, it’s ideal for older elementary kids and middle schoolers or for a family read aloud to go along with your American Revolution studies.\n\n11. Meet George Washington\n\nNeed a George Washington biography for early and middle elementary years? Meet George Washington from the Landmark series is a good choice. It’s a nice length for a chapter book (about 80 pages), lightly illustrated, and written in a clear, informative style.\n\n12. George Washington’s Breakfast\n\nGeorge Washington’s Breakfast is a fun book to add to your reading pile because it does such a great job of bringing you into life as George Washington knew it.\n\nAlso worth noting, Jean Fritz has another book about Washington. In George Washington’s Mother, a level 3 book from Penguin’s Young Readers series, she shines the spotlight on Mary Washington and how she impacted her famous son’s life.\n\n13. George Washington: A Photographic Story of a Life\n\nThis DK biography is another great option if you’re looking for highly visual nonfiction George Washington books. Aimed at middle grades, it covers Washington’s life pretty well and includes maps, a timeline, and suggested resources for further learning.\n\n14. George Washington’s Teeth\n\nYou’re most likely familiar with stories about George Washington and his dental issues, so this book about George Washington is a great way to set the record straight about those legendary wooden teeth.\n\n15. George Washington’s World\n\nA Newberry Honor Title recipient, Genevieve Foster’s George Washington’s World is a great choice if you’re looking for living books about Washington that are well-suited for older students.\n\n16. Washington’s War\n\nStacia Deutsch’s Washingtons’ War is another fun opportunity to step back in time and imagine what it would have been like to spur George Washington along and encourage him to keep fighting the Revolutionary War.\n\n17. George Washington: True Patriot\n\nGeorge Washington: True Patriot is another good option for read aloud time or for older students to read alone. It’s more than 200 pages and shares Washington’s journey of becoming one of the most trusted and valued leaders in American history.\n\nLooking for some similar reading suggestions?
