        "text": "- Hi, I'm Kevin Beene, a family medicine with obstetrics doctor. While I was growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin I witnessed a lot of health disparities and when I went to college I was studying biomedical engineering and originally thought that that was kind of the branch of medicine and healthcare that was the best fit for me. But ultimately, through volunteering at hospitals and really having more direct patient care, did I realize that actually being a medical provider was what was most fulfilling for me. So I am a true Wisconsinite and stayed in Madison Wisconsin for my medical degree after I finished my bachelor's and master's degrees. From there, came to Seattle for my residency training in family medicine and have really enjoyed staying here in Seattle. It's a wonderful place to practice medicine and I've really enjoyed growing my practice here. I see everyone from newborn babies to pregnant people to older adults. Also, as a obstetrics provider, I manage pregnancy and prenatal care, so I can see people at the very start of their pregnancy and for routine visits for prenatal care. And then I also see them in the hospital delivering babies. My hope is that when patients come to see me they feel like I'm listening and that I'm hearing them and that they have the autonomy to make decisions about their own health and their own bodies and that I can provide the information that they need in order to make those informed decisions. So when I'm not at work, I really enjoy being outside whether that's going for runs or going on the water and paddle boarding or going for hikes. And Seattle's really a great place for all of those things. It's got wonderful outdoors so I've loved that part of my life here. If you're looking for a provider who is really passionate about medicine, really enjoys getting to know people and also really wants to support you in whatever that means for maintaining your health or improving your health then I might be the right provider for you.\n\n- Hi, I'm Stephanie Coleman and I highly recommend the Lifestyle and Metabolic Medicine clinic. I had been experiencing weight gain and several different health complications for about 10 years progressively, and probably over a 20 year period of time. And I was feeling really overwhelmed because I'd tried so many different things for my weight, and my high blood pressure, and asthma, and all of these different things that were going on, and I would try, and try to lose weight, and I couldn't. I was referred by my Polyclinic provider to the actual Polyclinic Lifestyle and Metabolic Medicine Clinic, and they are the team that has helped me gain my health back. So I go to the doctor and I sit down with the nutritionist and she goes through information and basically tells you what their clinic is about. Then you go and see the doctor and he sits and informs you of what your body's been doing. It just takes that away from you, that guilt. And it's kind of an interesting process because there's ups and downs throughout the whole thing and it's not that you're not losing weight, it's just that your body's adjusting to different things. And so you continue with this wonderful team at the metabolic clinic. And you can talk to them about anything. You can write them on my chart. You can ask them questions that you may seem as silly. The patience and the guidance, the feeling of you're not alone, the support that they give you. The results for me have been incredible. They've been life changing. I have gone from a size 22 to a size eight. I've lost asthma, and high blood pressure, and I was pre-diabetic, and I'm no longer pre-diabetic. I was in a very high risk for heart issues and I'm no longer in any of those categories. I never was walking or running or exercising before. There's not a day that goes by that I'm not out there even in the rain. I just, I have to move. I ran my first 10K and that was really exhilarating. The nutritionist from the metabolic clinic met me out there, at the finish line, that will make me cry.\n\n- Hi, I'm Dan Smith. I'm a Urologist here at The Polyclinic. I went into medicine for the same reason I would hope anyone would go into medicine for just the desire to help people. You get to do something different every day. You're not sitting behind a desk all the time and you can, you know, actually see tangible ways that you're helping people. I'm originally from the Seattle area. I left the area to go to medical school at the University of Colorado in Denver, Colorado and then completed a residency in Urology at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. As a Urologist, I see patients 18 and up with issues of the genital urinary tract. So that means anything from the kidneys, ureter, bladder on out of the body. I think my approach to patient care is to, for a lot of things, let the patient drive a lot of their care. Some things are straightforward, like if someone has a big ureteral stone that needs to be treated, but a lot of things in urology are subjective and what may be very bothersome to one person not so bothersome to someone else. So really, taking in someone's values of what's important to them and how they wanna proceed down the road to potentially observation medication surgery. Just trying to really understand the entire patient before really making any sort of decision. Outside of work I like to spend time with my family, my wife, dog, cat, two toddlers. I do a lot of running. We like to get up to the mountains or out to the islands just spend time enjoying the outdoors."
