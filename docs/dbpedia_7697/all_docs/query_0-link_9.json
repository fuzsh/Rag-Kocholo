Fine unread condition gold boards, forest green spine with gold spine lettering contained in a near fine condition non price-clipped color illustrated dust jacket. Includes List of Other Books by Ron Chernow; Author Dedication; Preliminary Page Quote by Abigail Adams; Author's Note; Prelude: The Portrait Artist; Acknowledgments; Notes; Bibliography; Books; Articles; Index; and About the Author.

Rubbing to the rear outer jacket (see photographs). All pages are in as new condition and the spine is in exceedingly tight and square unread condition (see photographs). \"In Washington: A Life, celebrated biographer Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of our nation. With a breadth and depth matched by no other one-volume life of Washington, this crisply paces narrative carries the reader through his troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French and Indian War, his creation of Mount Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presideing over the Constitutional Convention, and his magnificent performance as America's first president. Despite the reverence his name inspires, Washington remains a lifeless waxwork for many Amerecans, worthy but dull. A laconic man of granite self-control, he often arouses more respect than affection. In this groundbreaking work, based on massive research, Chernow shatters forever the stereotyple of a stolid, unemotional man. A strapping six feet, Washington was a celebrated horseman, an elegant dancer, and a tireless hunter with a fiercely guarded emotional life. Chernow brings to vivid life a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions and many moods. Probing his private life, the author explores Washington's fraught relationship with his crusty mother, his youthful infatuation with the married Sally Fairfax, and his often conflicted feelings toward his adopted children and grandchildren. Chernow also provides a lavishly detailed portrait of Washington's marriage to Martha and his complex bahavior as a slave master. Most of all, Washington is an astute and surprising portrait of a canny political genius who knew how to inspire people. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, but he also brilliantly orchestrated their actions to shape the new federal government, define the separation of powers, establish the office of the presidency, and forge a nation. In this unique biography, Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding. With a dramatic sweep worthy of its giant subject, Washington is a magisterial work from one of our most elegant storytellers.\" -- from the inner front and rear jacket flaps."
