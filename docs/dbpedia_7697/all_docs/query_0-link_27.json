SIGNED and dated by author on 12/1/10. \"In WASHINGTON: A LIFE, celebrated biographer Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of our nation. With a breath and depth matched by no other one-volume life of Washington, this crisply paced narrative carries the reader through his troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French and Indian War, his creation of Mount Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention, anf his magnificent performance as America's first president.In this grounbreaking work, based on massive research, Chernow shatters forever the stereotype of a stolid, unemotional man.

Chernow brings to vivid life a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions and many moods.\". Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Near Fine. 1st Edition.
