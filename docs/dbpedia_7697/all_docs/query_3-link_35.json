        "text": "The Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) was established in 2009 as part of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA). The origins of the office date to 1961 with the establishment of the Office of Systems Analysis, which became the Office of Program Evaluation and Analysis in the mid-1970s. The CAPE staff consists of approximately 150 people, including both government civilians and military officers. The military officers serve in two- to three-year rotational assignments with the organization and are selected for both their operational and technical expertise. CAPE's civilian and military staff is highly educated, with backgrounds in a variety of academic disciplines, including physics, economics, engineering, mathematics, biology, computer science, and operations research. Approximately 42% of the analytic civilian staff holds a doctorate in their field, and a substantial share have prior military experience.\n\nBy law, the CAPE Director reports directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, providing independent analytic advice on all aspects of the defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems.\n\nCAPE is responsible for the management of the Department's programming process, including development of planning guidance (in conjunction with other organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense), production of applicable programming guidance, and direction of the annual program review. The ultimate product of the program review is the Future Years Defense Program - the authoritative statement of what the Department plans, year by year, in terms of force structure (how many ships, brigades and divisions, aircraft squadrons and wings, etc., we will operate), procurement (how many ships, tanks, aircraft, missiles, etc., we will buy), manpower (how many people, military and civilian, we plan to employ in each of the services and defense agencies), other supporting programs (such as R&D and military construction), and what it will all cost.\n\nCAPE helps to shape the force in the long-term by providing analysis and advice on resource issues to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council as well as formulating study guidance for analyses of alternatives for major defense acquisition programs. In addition, CAPE plays a central role in conducting analyses and formulating alternatives for major DoD-wide assessments, such as the Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretary's Strategic Portfolio Reviews.\n\nAt the direction of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, or the Director, the CAPE team also conducts numerous special studies and offers advice in other areas, such as military medical care, school systems for military dependents, information technology, and defense economics. These special studies sometimes include support to other federal agencies, several of which have created their own program analysis groups modeled on CAPE.\n\nAs an independent advisor to the Secretary, CAPE conducts analyses to answer the critical questions needed to shape and implement the Secretary of Defense's priorities and direction. Toward that end, CAPE leads the necessary but often unpopular task of fitting the defense program to the budgetary limits set for the Department by the President and Congress. Consistent with its advisory role, the office has no direct decision authority or line responsibility and has no vested interest in any sector of the defense budget."
