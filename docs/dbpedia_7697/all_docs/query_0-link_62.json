        "text": "Biographies are catnip for those who love to read and to puzzle out what makes people tick.\n\nHere are three of the year’s best:\n\n• Cleopatra: A Life (Little, Brown; 384 pages; $29.99) by Stacy Schiff\n\nAdmittedly, it can be hard to relate to the Ptolemy dynasty, which Cleopatra (69-30 B.C.) was part of. These rulers of Egypt didn’t think twice about marrying their brothers or sisters, then murdering them when said siblings got in the way of ambition (on the other hand, a visiting Roman was murdered by an angry crowd for killing a cat).\n\nThat having been said, Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-\n\nwinning biographer, portrays Cleopatra as the ambitious and talented ruler she was, and puts her affairs with Caesar and Mark Antony in their proper political context.\n\nThe Romans, the early writers of Cleopatra’s history, portrayed her as a lascivious, power-grabbing hussy. But Schiff works hard and successfully to get at the truth.\n\n• The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham (Random House, 640 pages, $35) by Selina Hastings\n\nMaugham, author of the novels Of Human Bondage and The Razor’s Edge, was enormously popular in his day (1874-1965). Few contemporaries knew that he was a closeted homosexual or occasional bisexual. He was trapped into marrying a woman he didn’t love after he got her pregnant, but his lifelong passion was for a dissolute charmer named Gerald Haxton.\n\nDespite all this personal drama, Maugham never stopped writing and reporting. He traveled the far reaches of the British Empire to research his stories, which are indelible and unflinching examinations of human nature. Hastings tells his story with grace and sympathy.\n\n• Washington: A Life (Penguin, 904 pages, $40) by Ron Chernow\n\nA masterful researcher and writer, Chernow benefited from an ever-\n\nexpanding treasure-trove of material at the Washington Papers project at the University of Virginia.\n\nHe vividly portrays all the George Washingtons: the vain, ambitious young man, prone to overreaching; the general, struggling to keep his troops clothed and fed; the president, shouldering the weight of the new republic. This book would be a terrific gift for any lover of American history."
