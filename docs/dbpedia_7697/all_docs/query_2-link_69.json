        "text": "Kerry Washington drops a number of massive bombs about her personal life in her stunning memoir, , but there’s a not-so-major reveal in the acknowledgments that’s almost as eyebrow-raising as the others. “Thank you to Shonda Rhimes,” Washington writes, “who told me to write a book 10 years ago.”\n\nGiven how close the actor and the Shondaland boss are — Rhimes knew of Washington’s pregnancies before Washington’s mother — it is reasonable to assume that Rhimes knew some of the things Washington opens up about in her book: Washington’s intense family backstory, her struggles with body issues, or that pearl-clutching discovery about her father. Surely, Rhimes knew all this, and that’s why she suggested that Washington write a book a whole decade ago, right?\n\n“She didn’t,” Washington tells Shondaland via phone one afternoon in mid-September, a week before Thicker Than Water hit the shelves. “Which is so funny because she would always say, ‘You have a book in you. I know you do. The notes you give after a table read … I know you’re a writer.’”\n\nBoy, was she right.\n\nThicker Than Water very much reads like a movie, opening with Washington getting a cryptic, mysterious text from her parents in 2018 — after Scandal had wrapped and Washington, now a bona fide movie star and Hollywood A-lister, was forging a new path with new projects of her own. “We need to talk,” the note read, setting Washington and the reader up for a suspenseful, jerky journey as compelling as any one of Olivia Pope’s escapades.\n\nBut Kerry Washington is of course not a fictional character but a flesh-and-blood real person, and Thicker Than Water traces Washington’s trail from bright overachiever in the Bronx to anxiety-ridden but talented tween who develops toxic perfectionist traits to a young woman gradually uncovering secrets her parents kept from her. It’s exceptionally written, no surprise, but Thicker Than Water truly veers into the remarkable as Washington draws deftly composed parallels between her life and the characters she’s played in her career. (Washington says that when Rhimes read a draft, she was “so supportive” and advised her to move some things around, which, coming from a master storyteller, was “appropriate.”)\n\nBy far, the biggest revelation in the book is one about her father, and the challenges her mother faced trying to conceive baby Kerry; Washington connects the dots between her origin story and characters including Olivia, who famously had all kinds of secrets and drama with her dad, and Mia of Little Fires Everywhere, a surrogate who runs off with the daughter she was supposed to hand over to the parents. Thicker Than Water becomes surreal — a narrative so perfectly coordinated, it’s like something penned by Shonda Rhimes herself.\n\n“The universe talks to us,” Washington says. “We have to learn to listen. And I clearly was not ready until a few years ago. I think I was writing, apparently just to try to make sense of it all — make sense of my life — and then making the decision to share it came from just not wanting to hide.”\n\nKerry Washington and her father are shown during the opening night of The Vagina Monologues at The Apollo in New York City.\n\nReaders of Thicker Than Water will no doubt wonder if Washington got an okay from her parents to share the details unveiled within; there’s a portion where she recounts her father literally saying, verbatim, “Just don’t ever talk about it.” Yet that secret, and so many others, is now part of the book — not to mention the public discourse. Did she feel any guilt about revealing all this? Did she ask permission to put her family’s heaviest and most personal and classified business out in the world?\n\n“I’ve always had a very public relationship with my parents,” she says. “They’ve come to lots of red carpets with me, and I’ve done lots of interviews with them, fashion shows, and award shows. So weirdly, to keep this information private felt like I was in a lie, kinda. I didn’t get their permission, but I got their blessing afterward because I felt like if I get their permission, then they get to be collaborators on the book. And I’m not really telling our story. I’m telling my story. And they’re in it. Their version would be a different book. They got to have their version of the story for a really long time. I was the supporting character in their version of the narrative for four decades. It was time for me to be able to have my take.”\n\nSunlight, they say, is the best disinfectant after all, and in absorbing Thicker Than Water, readers come away with not only a new appreciation for Washington but also the truth that celebrities really are people just like the rest of us. Thicker Than Water also shows Washington as courageous and brave; it’s one thing to open oneself to scrutiny by appearing on a red carpet and, say, wearing open-toe shoes, but another entirely to tell the world, “This is where I came from; these are the issues I deal with; these are the wounds I’m working on.” She hopes that by opening all her closet doors, readers will also let light in their own lives, particularly the parts that remain hidden.\n\n“One of the big things that happens when people read it is that they tell me their secrets,” she tells Shondaland. “That’s really meaningful to me because people are feeling the vulnerability that I’m stepping into, and they’re willing to step into that with me. I hope that people feel like when they read the book, they can be on their own journey. Not everybody has to write a book and share it with the world; not everybody has to know everything. But holding on to secrets allows them to hold on to shame. So, I hope people find places to share their truth.”\n\nThicker Than Water is on sale now.\n\nMalcolm Venable is a Senior Staff Writer at Shondaland. Follow him on Twitter @malcolmvenable."
