The data and status reports on this page are updated weekly and let you see our progress in processing Compensation, Pension, Education, and other Special Mission benefits. You can also download a spreadsheet to see the most recent weeks’ worth of performance data. More information is available in the weekly claims detail data listed below.\n\nVA continues to provide more care, more benefits, and more services to more Veterans than ever before. Across the enterprise, VA has achieved record-breaking numbers in providing benefits and care. In 2023 alone, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) completed more than 1.9 million disability compensation and pension claims for Veterans, an all-time VA record that broke the previous year’s record by 15.9%. Our continued focus on claims processing fundamentals, such as expanded C&P examination capacity, digitization of federal records, and ensuring a robust hiring and onboarding process, contributed to the agency’s ability to meet these goals. Learn more about the VBA's claims inventory.\n\nStatus Reports\n\nThe reports below contain data covering claims inventory, claims backlog, claims accuracy, and fully developed claims. VBA employees are completing more compensation claims than ever before, resulting in Veterans and survivors receiving over $150 billion in disability compensation and pension benefits in 2023.\n\nVBA Quality Assurance Sampling Methodology\n\nDuring fiscal year 2015, VBA revised its quality assurance program to reflect industry-standard best practices in statistical sampling and estimation. VBA’s quality assurance program is designed to provide quality estimates within a 5% margin of error with a 95% confidence level for every 12 months of reviews. For more information on VBA’s quality assurance program and claim sampling methodology, please read: VBA accuracy sampling methodology.\n\nGet the Weekly Reports\n\nAccess the weekly reports below.
