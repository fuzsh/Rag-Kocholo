        "text": "If you are not a current SNAP recipient, you can apply online for regular SNAP benefits. More information on this can be found at www.dcfs.la.gov/getSNAP.\n\nYou can apply for regular SNAP benefits online through the CAFÉ customer portal, or by downloading a paper application and submitting it to DCFS by U.S. Mail or fax. You will find a list of documents here that are required for proof of identity and eligibility. Applications cannot be emailed. For instructions on how to apply for SNAP, visit www.dcfs.la.gov/getSNAP or text GETSNAP (no spaces) to 898-211.\n\nYou can also find tips, how-to videos and more at http://www.dcfs.louisiana.gov/page/snap-how-to-apply. Find helpful how-to videos here: http://www.dcfs.la.gov/page/cafe-video-tutorials.\n\nIt depends. Individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or households including anyone who receives Family Independence Temporary Assistance Program (FITAP), Kinship Care Subsidy Program (KCSP) or Strategies to Empower People (STEP) Program benefits, are exempt from the SNAP resource limit.\n\nDCFS is also using Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) to expand SNAP eligibility to applicants who have excess assets but who are otherwise income eligible. If a household is BBCE-eligible, assets will not be counted in determining SNAP eligibility.\n\nCertain restrictions do apply. If household members have been disqualified (for program violations, failure to comply with work registration requirements, noncompliance with SSI-required treatment for addiction/alcoholism, conviction of certain crimes, receipt of substantial lottery/gambling winnings) or if a household member is otherwise ineligible (e.g., an ineligible student, ineligible alien, or on strike), Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility will not apply and assets will be considered in determining SNAP eligibility.\n\nAssets of households who are not BBCE-eligible, and who are not otherwise exempt from the resource limit, must be counted in determining SNAP eligibility.\n\nAssets include things like bank accounts, cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), stocks and bonds. More information on SNAP eligibility and resource limits.\n\nMaybe. It depends on how much you receive and your household size.\n\nWhile the USDA allows certain disaster unemployment assistance to be excluded from income for SNAP purposes, the 1st round of federal pandemic unemployment benefits ($600 weekly) authorized under the CARES Act were required to be counted as income when calculating SNAP eligibility.\n\nHowever, the 2nd round of pandemic unemployment benefits ($300 weekly) authorized under the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2021, will NOT be counted as income. Please note that state unemployment benefits will still be counted.\n\nYou can also find the income limits for eligibility here. For more information about what income and resources are counted in determining SNAP eligibility, and to see maximum income levels by household size, visit www.dcfs.la.gov/page/snap-eligibility\n\nWhen applying for SNAP benefits, there are several documents you need to provide – either by uploading them in CAFÉ when you apply or by emailing/mailing/faxing them to us.\n\nUploading these documents in CAFÉ when you apply will help reduce the time it takes to process your SNAP application. Please gather these documents and save them to your computer or mobile device before you start the application process so you will have them ready to upload when you apply. CAFÉ can accept scanned PDF documents, as well as GIF, JPG and PNG photos. For a video tutorial on How to Upload Documents to CAFÉ, visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqDbW1m_fRc&feature=youtu.be. This and other helpful How-To videos about CAFÉ and applying for SNAP can also be found at www.dcfs.la.gov/page/cafe-video-tutorials.\n\nDocuments you need to provide with a SNAP application include proof of:\n\nIdentity\n\nStatus as a legal resident, if applicable\n\nWage information if employed or a notice of termination or separation if recently unemployed\n\nSelf-employment income information\n\nAny other income, such as unemployment compensation, Social Security, veterans benefits, child support, or retirement income\n\nMedical expenses\n\nChild support paid to someone outside your home\n\nFor a list of what kinds of documents can be used as proof, visit www.dcfs.la.gov/page/204.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are applying for FITAP and/or KCSP, additional documentation is required. For a list of what documents are required with FITAP/KCSP applications, visit www.dcfs.la.gov/page/204.\n\nIf you cannot upload your documents in CAFÉ, you may email, mail, or fax them to us instead:\n\nEmail to LAHelpU.DCFS@la.gov\n\nMail to DCFS Economic Stability, P.O. Box 260031, Baton Rouge, LA 70826\n\nFax to (225) 663-3164\n\nWhen you send your documents by email, mail or fax, please be sure to include on each page: your name as it appears in our records, your date of birth, your mailing address and the last four digits ONLY of your Social Security Number.\n\nThe best way to provide documents is through the DCFS CAFE portal. You can find a helpful how-to video about this and other SNAP application issues here on our website. However, if you're having trouble, you can send your documents using one of the following options:\n\nFax the documents to (225) 663-3164\n\nMail copies of the documents to:\n\nDPC\n\nP.O. Box 260031\n\nBaton Rouge, LA 70826\n\nYou should also include your name, date of birth, your mailing address and the last four digits only of your Social Security number. If you already have a SNAP EBT card, you should include your case ID number (the small number below the 16-digit number on your card).\n\nFind out what documents are needed to provide proof of eligibility: http://www.dcfs.louisiana.gov/page/204\n\nBecause of the great volume of applications DCFS has been receiving, it may take 30 days to process applications. Providing all required documents at the time of application can help expedite the process. More about what must be verified and examples of proof. If we do not receive all required documentation to make a determination on your case, you will receive a call and/or letter from your caseworker, requesting the needed documentation.\n\nAfter you apply, you can check on the status of your application through our online CAFÉ customer portal at www.dcfs.la.gov/cafe. After signing into your CAFÉ account, go to the “My Applications” page and click the status link next to the application. Possible status updates include: Submitted, Received, Incomplete, Pending, Awaiting Verifications, Verifications Received, Approved, Denied and Unavailable.

This will ensure you have a card in-hand in case your application is ultimately approved, so that you can access benefits more quickly.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: No benefits will be loaded onto the card unless/until your application is approved, so you may receive a card with $0 benefits loaded onto it. The benefits would then be loaded onto the card the day after your application is approved.\n\nIf your application is approved before the 21st day after your application date, an EBT card will be mailed to you the day after your application is approved.

Benefits will be loaded onto your card if/when your application is approved.\n\nIf you have previously bookmarked or saved the link to our CAFE customer portal on your computer or phone, you may have linked to our old CAFE Customer Portal rather than our new, upgraded CAFE Self-Service Portal.
