        "text": "Follow this checklist to make sure you have everything you need to submit a complete application for admission.\n\nThe applications\n\nSelf-report your courses and complete CADRs\n\nChoose your program\n\nThe writing section\n\nAdditional information about yourself or your circumstances\n\nThe application fee\n\nSend test scores?\n\nSend transcripts?\n\nStudents impacted by disasters and emergencies\n\nMake sure you also know what’s not considered.\n\nThe applications\n\nThe UW application for freshman autumn admission opens September 1 each year. (See dates and deadlines for additional information.) You may apply to the UW using one of two applications — ApplyWeb or the Common App. Please apply with only one application. The UW does not have a preference of application platform. The deadline for both is November 15, and decisions will be released March 1–15.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nApply using ApplyWeb\n\nApply using the Common App\n\nQuestions about the applications?\n\nInstructions for ApplyWeb\n\nInstructions for the Common App\n\nJoin us for a webinar about applying with the Common App.\n\nNOTE: The UW will not accept the Coalition application for the autumn 2023 – 24 application cycle.\n\nSelf-report your courses and complete CADRs\n\nAll freshman applicants will self-report their courses on the application. A minimum level of preparation in six subject areas must be met for admission. (Learn more about satisfying CADRs.) You are required to provide complete and accurate information when self-reporting. Although official transcripts are not required at the time of application, you will be required to provide a final official high school transcript if you are admitted and plan to enroll at the UW.\n\nChoose your program\n\nIf your first-choice major participates in Direct to Major or Direct to College admission, be sure to select it as your first choice on the application to be automatically considered. Second-choice majors are not considered for direct admission programs.\n\nThe writing section\n\nThe writing section is a required and important part of your application. Learn more about the essays, including prompts and word count. Please note that the UW essay questions must be answered within our application. For the Common App, that means within our UW questions. We do not consider the Common App essay.\n\nAdditional information about yourself or your circumstances\n\nMaximum length: 200 words\n\nYou are not required to write anything in this section, but you may include additional information here if something has particular significance to you. For example, you may use this space if:\n\nYou have experienced personal hardships in attaining your education\n\nYour activities have been limited because of work or family obligations\n\nYou have experienced unusual limitations or opportunities unique to the schools you attended\n\nThe application fee\n\nU.S. freshman students\n\nThe application fee is nonrefundable and must be submitted each time you apply for admission. It cannot be transferred to another quarter, campus of the UW or to another student.\n\nApplication fee: $80\n\nFee waivers available\n\nSpring: freshman applications not accepted\n\nLearn more about the application fee.\n\nInternational freshman students\n\nThe application fee is nonrefundable, and must be submitted each time you apply for admission. It cannot be transferred to another quarter, campus of the UW or to another student.\n\nApplication fee: $90\n\nFee waivers not available\n\nWinter/Spring: international freshman applications not accepted\n\nLearn more about the application fee.\n\nSend test scores?\n\nThe UW no longer requires SAT or ACT scores for most applicants. Homeschooled applicants and applicants who come from schools with non-standard grading practices that do not have letter or numeric grades are still required to submit SAT or ACT scores. Learn more about SAT/ACT scores.\n\nInternational freshman students — English proficiency\n\nInternational students must submit English proficiency test scores that meet the minimum requirement for admission. Learn more about English proficiency.\n\nSend transcripts?\n\nU.S. schools and international schools that follow a U.S.-style curriculum\n\nDo not send high school or college transcripts unless you receive a request from the Office of Admissions. The application asks you to provide a detailed account of your academic coursework, and that’s all we need to review your application.\n\nSchools outside the U.S. that follow a national/local curriculum\n\nRegardless of whether you are applying as a U.S. or international student, if you have attended a school outside of the U.S. that follows a national compulsory curriculum, you are required to upload a scanned, unofficial copy of your transcript for grade levels 9 and higher as part of your application.\n\nDo not mail high school transcripts or mid-year school reports to the Office of Admissions.\n\nStudents impacted by disasters and emergencies\n\nNatural disasters and emergency situations, including international conflicts, have impacted the lives of many students and their families. While entirely optional, you may share information regarding how any of these events have affected you or your family circumstances in a specific question on the application or as part of your essay response. If your circumstances prevent you from submitting your application by the deadline, please contact the Office of Admissions.\n\nWe welcome applications primarily from undergraduate students displaced from their universities by the conflict in Gaza. Please contact the Office of Admissions for more information.\n\nThings we do not consider\n\nNo interviews/demonstrated interest\n\nThe UW does not conduct formal interviews or consider demonstrated interest in the admission decision.\n\nNo letters of recommendation\n\nWe ask that you not send letters of recommendation or other supplemental materials such as drawings, CDs, DVDs, books or other portfolio-type items. We will learn everything we need to know about you through your essay responses.\n\nNo Common App personal essay\n\nThe Common App personal essay will not be reviewed as part of your application to the UW. Be sure to complete the UW writing section to tell us everything you want us to know."
