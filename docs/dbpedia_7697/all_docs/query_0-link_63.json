        "text": "Washington: A Life\n\nRon Chernow\n\nFormat: Hardcover, 904pp.\n\nISBN: 9781594202667\n\nPublisher: Penguin Press HC\n\nPub. Date: October 4, 2010\n\nAverage Customer Review:\n\nFor Bulk Orders Call: 626-441-2024\n\nDescription and Reviews\n\nFrom The Publisher:\n\nFrom National Book Award winner Ron Chernow, a landmark biography of George Washington.\n\nIn Washington: A Life celebrated biographer Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of our nation. With a breadth and depth matched by no other one-volume life of Washington, this crisply paced narrative carries the reader through his troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French and Indian War, his creation of Mount Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention, and his magnificent performance as America's first president.\n\nDespite the reverence his name inspires, Washington remains a lifeless waxwork for many Americans, worthy but dull. A laconic man of granite self-control, he often arouses more respect than affection. In this groundbreaking work, based on massive research, Chernow dashes forever the stereotype of a stolid, unemotional man. A strapping six feet, Washington was a celebrated horseman, elegant dancer, and tireless hunter, with a fiercely guarded emotional life. Chernow brings to vivid life a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions and many moods. Probing his private life, he explores his fraught relationship with his crusty mother, his youthful infatuation with the married Sally Fairfax, and his often conflicted feelings toward his adopted children and grandchildren. He also provides a lavishly detailed portrait of his marriage to Martha and his complex behavior as a slave master.\n\nAt the same time, Washington is an astute and surprising portrait of a canny political genius who knew how to inspire people. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, but he also brilliantly orchestrated their actions to shape the new federal government, define the separation of powers, and establish the office of the presidency.\n\nIn this unique biography, Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding. With a dramatic sweep worthy of its giant subject, Washington is a magisterial work from one of our most elegant storytellers.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Tenaciously researched...This new portrait offers a fresh sense of what a groundbreaking role Washington played, not only in physically embodying his new nation's leadership but also in interpreting how its newly articulated constitutional principles would be applied...deeply rewarding.\"\n\nNew York Times\n\n\"Just as he resuscitated Alexander Hamilton in a heralded 2004 biography, Ron Chernow now resurrects Washington...[A] remarkable book.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly\n\n\"Today, books about Washington continue to appear at such an astonishing rate that the publication of Ron Chernow's prompts the inevitable question: Why another one? An obvious answer is that Chernow is no ordinary writer. Like his popular biographies of John D. Rockefeller and Alexander Hamilton, his 'Washington'...is vivid and well paced.\"\n\nNew York Times Book Review\n\n\"Magisterial...the brilliant biographer Ron Chernow, author of the National Book Award-winning The House of Morgan, demonstrates in his magnificently written, richly detailed and always compelling Washington: A Life just how and why his subject attained such an exalted status.\"\n\nBook Page\n\n\"Whether he's debunking the legend of Washington's wooden teeth (ivory that cracked and discolored over time) or the purely fictional tale of the cherry tree, the massive yet briskly paced Washington: A Life is a rollicking read, sure to redefine perceptions and correct assumptions.\"\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\n\"A vastly enlightening, overwhelmingly engaging treatment of a great man ...another book on Washington? is a question rendered pointless by this one, which happens to be the author's masterpiece. Definitive Washington is the point and effect of this biography.\"\n\nBooklist\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRon Chernow is the prize-winning author of five previous books. His first, The House of Morgan, won the National Book Award. His two most recent books, Alexander Hamilton and Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, were both nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in biography.\n\nFind Items On Similar Subjects\n\nHero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Essential Lists\n\nBOOKS TO READ BEFORE YOU LEAD\n\nGrow Your Leadership Skills\n\nNEW AND UPCOMING LEADERSHIP BOOKS\n\nClassic Leadership Books\n\nBOOKS TO READ BEFORE YOU LEAD"
