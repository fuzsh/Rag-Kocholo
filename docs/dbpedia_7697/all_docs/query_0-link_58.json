        "text": "'Simple truth is his best, his greatest eulogy,’ Abigail Adams – wife of the founding father and second President of the United States John Adams – said of George Washington after his death.\n\nBut what is the truth about the man who led American forces to victory over the crown during the eight-year war with Britain, which ended with the capitulation of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1783? Was he an English gentleman or a proud American, an avatar of freedom or a slave-owner, a gifted military commander or a lucky general, whose career depended on factors beyond his control?\n\nThe remarkable thing, as Ron Chernow shows in his Washington: A Life, is that he was all these things, at different times, and sometimes even simultaneously. This, of course, is well known, and purists may wonder whether we really need another Washington biography. Strictly speaking, the answer has to be: not this one.\n\nThe author brings no new evidence to bear and advances no fundamentally new interpretation. The justification for Chernow’s book lies elsewhere: in the fluency of the argument, the wisdom of the author’s judgments, and – despite its length – the tautness of the narrative, which keeps the reader engrossed from the first to the last page.\n\nSome stylistic slips and a tendency towards the homespun aside, the author writes well, and has a remarkable eye for telling anecdotes and quotations. He takes us deftly through the familiar set-pieces of Washington’s career, beginning with his struggle with his overbearing mother and the disastrous expedition against the French and Indians that nearly brought his career to a premature end in the mid-1750s.\n\nAs Chernow shows, the future revolutionary leader started as an ardent partisan of empire. His disillusionment with London was the result of the British government’s refusal to colonise the western lands after the Seven Years War and thus embark on an endless conflict with the local Indians.\n\nWashington believed that further expansion was not only the just reward for his exertions – and Chernow reminds us just how deeply his subject speculated in these lands – but that it was essential to forestall French or Spanish ambitions. Although the author does not quite put it this way, it is clear that Washington, like so many American rebels, took up arms against the King not because they objected to the British Empire as such, but because it was not imperialist enough.\n\nInevitably, much of the book is taken up with the swings and roundabouts of the War of Independence, especially the bitter winter at Valley Forge and Washington’s battles with his political masters in the Continental Congress. They were suspicious of popular generals and almost seemed to will him to fail by keeping the troops short of pay, equipment and food.\n\nHere Chernow is highly persuasive on the secret of Washington’s success. He was hardly a charismatic figure and was, if anything, rather reserved and aloof. Washington was a good listener, however, and knew how to keep his own counsel. This marked him out from other major military figures, such as his bête noire Charles Lee and the swaggering Horatio Gates, victor of Saratoga.\n\nAlways sensitive to the opinions of others, he does not seem to have minded criticism, so long as it was open and not part of the many cabals which formed in Congress and within the Continental Army. His leadership of men was superb, bringing out the best in the often surly and under-appreciated rank and file, while managing the egos and ambitions of his brother officers. Above all, he kept the army together during the lean early years of the rebellion, until the French intervened and made possible the knockout blow at Yorktown.\n\nWisely, Chernow does not explicitly set out to write a biography 'for our times’. All the same, his account bears an obvious message for American readers: big government, far from being a betrayal of the Founding Fathers, is as American as pecan pie. The final chapters show that Washington was deeply concerned after independence by the weakness of the bonds holding the 13 states together.\n\nThere was virtually no executive to speak of, and the new country was therefore unable to pay its war debts, to take up credits, to manage a common currency, to promote trade and above all to provide for the common defence. Washington was appalled at the failure to deal with the Barbary pirates, to expand westwards systematically to stop the British, French and Spaniards from doing so, and even from preventing the individual states from falling out among themselves over the spoils.\n\nThe result was the great 'Federalist debate’ and the American Constitution of 1787-1788, with its strong executive presidency, to which Washington was elected with acclaim. He and other founding fathers, such as John Jay, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, thus rendered the young nation a service even greater, because more durable, than the fragile independence they secured from Britain.\n\nWashington: A life\n\nBy Ron Chernow\n\nALLEN LANE, £35, 904pp"
