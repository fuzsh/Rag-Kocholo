        "text": "Print\n\nStudent Handbook 2023-2024\n\nThe policies of Washington and Lee University are under continual examination and revision. This Student Handbook is not a contract; it merely presents the policies in effect at the time of publication and in no way guarantees that the policies will not change. For more updated policies and information see www.wlu.edu.\n\nThis Student Handbook and the policies contained herein remain in force and effect in between terms of the academic year and during holidays and other periods of the academic year when classes are not in session.\n\nThis Student Handbook and the policies contained herein apply to all students enrolled at Washington and Lee University, including those auditing courses at Washington and Lee University and the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nThis year's Student Handbook was last updated in February 2024.\n\nI. Policy Statement Relating to Campus Life\n\n(As adopted by the Board of Trustees May 25, 1985)\n\nThe Board of Trustees believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to encourage the development and maintenance of an environment within the University community, which best permits the realization of our institutional goals. Those goals, according to the University's Statement of Institutional Philosophy, include the pursuit of our educational purpose in a climate of learning that stresses the importance of the individual, the personal honor and integrity of all students and their harmonious relationships with other members of the greater community. In this context, the institutionalized extracurricular and social life of students should contribute to these goals.\n\nIt is our desire that student self-government should be encouraged and that a proper balance between student privilege and responsibility should be sought and achieved. We recognize that all members of the student body will spend a portion of their life apart from the institution and outside its governance. Students must nonetheless remain aware that they are members of a University community whose traditions, image and reputation can be harmed by negative actions and behavior as well as being helped by positive contributions. This awareness is especially important because the University, lodged as it is within a larger community, must encourage respect for local ordinances and law enforcement and honor the claims of non-University persons for quiet and safety. In all of its expression, the spirit of this Campus Life statement places emphasis on concepts of honor, integrity, standards of value, leadership, good character, respect for traditions and personal responsibility. We do expect that individual and group actions and behavior will be measured against these concepts. It is our intention to hold accountable for the successful implementation of this policy the administration, the faculty, the students and, indeed, this Board of Trustees.\n\nAs provided in the University By-Laws, the Faculty shall be responsible for the academic regulation of students, for entrance and graduation requirements, for the approval and supervision of courses of study, and for the recommendation of students for degrees. The Faculty may adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the discharge of its obligations.\n\nII. Executive Committee of the Student Body\n\nThe Executive Committee is a 13-member body of representatives elected by students from each undergraduate and law class. The Executive Committee is entrusted with administration of the Honor System by the Washington and Lee Board of Trustees. The Executive Committee also serves as the student government organization, which maintains the student activity fee and is responsible for allocation of funds, other than the Student Bar Association fee, to student organizations.\n\nIII. The Honor System\n\nThe Honor System at Washington and Lee University\n\nHonor is the moral cornerstone of Washington and Lee University. Commitment to honor is recognized by every student, faculty member, administrator, and staff member of the University. Honor provides the common thread woven through the many aspects of this institution and creates a community of trust and respect affecting fundamentally the relationships of all its members. The centrality of honor at Washington and Lee is contained in its Honor System. The Board of Trustees has granted to students the privilege of overseeing the administration of the Honor System. This privilege includes the responsibilities of (1) defining dishonorable acts that the current student generation views as breaches of the community’s trust; (2) investigating possible violations of the Honor System; (3) administering closed hearings where possible Honor Violations are suspected; (4) writing and revising the White Book, the Honor System policy and procedures manual; and (5) reporting directly to the Board of Trustees on the administration of the Honor System. The sole penalty for an Honor System violation is dismissal from the University. These responsibilities are administered by the Executive Committee of the Student Body, a group of students elected annually by their peers. Academic life is essentially shaped by this commitment to honor. Assuming that students will behave honorably, the faculty grants flexibility in the scheduling of most final examinations and all are taken without supervision. Take-home closed book examinations are a common occurrence. The pledge, “On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unacknowledged aid on this (exam, test, paper, etc.),” expresses the student’s promise that the work submitted is his or hers alone. Students’ dedication to honorable behavior creates a strong bond of trust among them and between them and the faculty. This student dedication and the bond that it engenders also provide the basis for the faculty’s commitment to accepting a student’s word without question.\n\nThe dedication to behave honorably is not confined to academic life. It is expected that students will respect each other’s word and intellectual and personal property in the residence halls and the Greek houses, on the playing field, in the city of Lexington, or wherever Washington and Lee students take themselves. This principled expectation provides the foundation for the community of trust which students seek to create not only in the academic sphere but in life outside it as well. The Honor System has been a unique feature of Washington and Lee University for well over a century. Thousands of students have lived under it while in residence, have been morally shaped by it and, as alumni and alumnae, continue to be guided by it in their professional lives. Current students are as committed to it as were those who lived and studied here before them, and they maintain with firm conviction this distinctive ideal of the University.\n\nStudents attending Washington and Lee must realize that our commitment to the principle of honor is firm. This commitment stems from a long tradition of trust and honesty in a community that respects those traits. Under this system, students must not lie, cheat, steal or misrepresent themselves in any way that is considered dishonorable by the student generation involved. Students found guilty by their peers of a breach of the Honor System are dismissed permanently from the University.\n\nA Community of Honor\n\nThe Honor System of Washington and Lee is based on the fundamental principle that a spirit of trust pervades all aspects of student life. This spirit of trust makes Washington and Lee a unique educational institution. Students enjoy unparalleled academic and social freedom. The system is one of mutual trust---trust among students, faculty, administrators, and townspeople that students attending Washington and Lee will conduct themselves honorably at all times, on or off campus. Students are expected to do their own work, represent themselves truthfully, and claim only that which is their own. No violation of this trust is more egregious than another or too small to be ignored.\n\nThe Honor System governs only acts that indicate a student is not worthy of trust by his or her peers. The System is not structured to work against students, but rather for students. It is not structured to frighten honest students, but rather to encourage them. The System is mutually reinforcing. The more students live by the System, the stronger the System becomes.\n\nThe notion of an honorable community is closely related to the University's educational objectives, for the learning process flourishes best in an environment where mutual trust and respect shape the bedrock of relationships within the community. Every student at Washington and Lee, thus, has a duty to the Honor System.\n\nImplications of our System\n\nA student at Washington and Lee is presumed to act honorably at all times. A sense of mutual trust and respect surrounds all aspects of a student's life at Washington and Lee. Professors rely on the integrity of their students and expect that all work submitted is exclusively their own. All work at Washington and Lee, unless otherwise stated, is considered pledged.\n\nThe form of the pledge is: \"On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unacknowledged aid on this (exam, test, paper, etc.).\"\n\nOpen Exam Policy\n\nOne of the truest expressions of trust and honesty found on our campus and one of the most tangible privileges of the Washington and Lee Honor System is the open examination policy. Under this policy, it is the general practice of The College, the School of Law, and the Williams School, not to have exams proctored by University officials.\n\nUndergraduates are allowed to schedule their exams on any day of the six possible exam dates. Students are required to make their selections the week before the examination period begins. Only in rare instances are there stated times for a particular examination.\n\nAt the School of Law, only first-year course exams are given at one stated period. Generally, second and third-year law students have a choice between two stated times and dates.\n\nThis policy reinforces the great amount of trust placed in Washington and Lee students. In order for students to continue to exercise such academic freedom, they must accept the responsibilities and challenges of governing themselves. Part of the open exam policy is an agreement that no one will discuss any aspect of an exam with anyone else until the examination period has ended. Even a casual remark as to the difficulty of an exam is not allowed. Experience has proven such remarks may give some students an unfair academic advantage over their peers. Therefore, it is imperative to the freedom and trust placed in Washington and Lee students that no aspect of any exam be discussed or commented upon until the examination week is concluded. To do so would place a great strain on the privilege. Discussing exams is considered a serious honor violation.\n\nPlagiarism\n\n\"Plagiarism\" describes the use of another's words or ideas without proper acknowledgment. The students of Washington and Lee University have considered plagiarism a violation of the Honor System in the past; therefore, all forms of plagiarism including Internet plagiarism are taken very seriously. Students at Washington and Lee must be aware of the nature of plagiarism. Plagiarism takes many forms, including the wholesale copying of phrases or texts, or the use of ideas without indicating the source. Certain facts must also be properly acknowledged.\n\nExamples of possible plagiarism can be found in the Executive Committee's Plagiarism Pamphlet. This is available to the entire W&L community on the Executive Committee's website at ec.wlu.edu. In addition, Leyburn Library has a helpful site on avoiding plagiarism: https://libguides.wlu.edu/plagiarism.\n\nA Brief Synopsis of Procedure\n\nThe Honor System at Washington and Lee is administered exclusively by the Executive Committee of the Student Body. The authority for the Honor System comes directly from the Board of Trustees of the University and is in no way influenced by the University's administration or faculty.\n\nBeing completely student administered means that the students have a great responsibility in preserving this unique aspect of the community. As a result of previous students' dedication, the Honor System has remained strong. See The Honor System “White Book” published by the Student Executive Committee at ec.wlu.edu.\n\nHearing Advisors\n\nHearing Advisors who show exceptional ability and a strong desire to uphold the Honor System may be selected to serve as members of the investigative team and as advisors for the respondent. The Executive Committee selects a student (undergraduate or law) to serve as head hearing advisor and a student to serve as assistant head hearing advisor.\n\nThe Head Hearing Advisor administers the Hearing Advisor Program. These advisors are also available to assist in other conduct matters.\n\nReporting Possible Violations\n\nAnyone with knowledge of a possible Honor Violation should seek clarification from the student suspected of the Violation and ask for an explanation of the incident. Should this explanation convince the inquiring person that no honor offense exists the matter should be dropped.\n\nIf the inquiring person still believes that an Honor Violation may have occurred, then the matter should be brought to the attention of a member of the Executive Committee. A person not wishing to confront a student suspected of an Honor Violation should bring the matter to the immediate attention of a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nUpon receiving information that an Honor Violation might have occurred, the President of the Executive Committee will appoint a team to investigate the allegation and prepare a report of their findings. If, after hearing the investigative team's report and recommendations, the Executive Committee believes that there is sufficient evidence of an Honor Violation, an Executive Committee Hearing shall be held, during which the accused student will be assisted by Hearing Advisors if he or she so chooses. If the Executive Committee finds the accused student did not commit an Honor Violation, all charges are dropped and the student remains an active part of the University. If the Executive Committee finds that the accused student committed an Honor Violation, the accused student may either withdraw from the University or appeal the case to a Student Body Hearing. The Hearing, which is open to all members of the W&L community, is conducted before a jury of twelve students selected at random from the student body. If the jury returns a verdict of \"not guilty,\" the student shall remain a member of the University. If the jury returns a verdict of \"guilty,\" the student is dismissed from the University. The decision of the student jury is final and cannot be appealed.\n\nIV. University Policies and Procedures — Academic\n\nAcademic policies are set by the faculty. The University Catalog on the web, along with the notifications of changes, is the most complete and up-to-date information about these policies. Please check the most current version on the University Registrar's web page at catalog.wlu.edu.\n\nClass Attendance\n\nParticipation in the work of a course is clearly a precondition for a student receiving credit in that course. Because of the wide variety of courses and teaching methods at Washington and Lee, the University recognizes that the nature of a student’s participation in the work of a course cannot be prescribed on a University-wide basis. For this reason, classroom attendance is not a matter subject to regulation by the University. Attendance in class and laboratory is usually a matter between the student and the professor in that class or laboratory. Faculty members may require a previously registered student to drop a class if the student misses the first meeting of the term without the prior approval of the instructor. In such cases, the student is responsible for submitting the appropriate forms.\n\nIf a situation arises that requires a student to be away from campus for more than two consecutive weeks, the student must petition FEC for permission. In such instances, the student may be required to take a leave of absence for the remainder of the term. See the leave of absence policy for information on returning from a leave of absence. A student taking an unauthorized underload or maintaining an unapproved extended absence from classes (two weeks or more during the fall or winter term and one week or more during the spring term) may be required to withdraw from the University for the term in which that conduct occurs, forfeiting all academic credit, tuition and fees for that term. The appropriate Dean will inform the student of the withdrawal, along with the steps that the student must take to apply for reinstatement.\n\nReligious Holidays\n\nWashington and Lee University values diverse religious perspectives and beliefs. Our students celebrate and value a variety of religious traditions. We are committed to supporting our students in observing their religious holidays, while also maintaining their commitment to their academic efforts. The catalog states the following university policy:\n\nAny student who is unable, because of his or her religious holiday(s), to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, athletic, or work requirement on a particular day shall be provided an opportunity to satisfy the requirement in a timely manner or shall be excused from the requirement. Specifically,\n\nUndergraduate students should reach out to their faculty member, adviser, supervisor, or coach, within the first two weeks of class in fall or winter term, two days in spring term, and again prior to the religious holiday to discuss how best to make up the missed requirement.\n\nLaw students should reach out to their faculty member within the first two weeks of class in the relevant semester and again prior to the religious holiday to discuss how best to make up the missed requirement.\n\nNo adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who makes use of this provision of university policy.\n\nThe faculty (including coaches) receive annual reminders of this policy and are encouraged to work carefully with students in anticipating and resolving conflicts to their mutual satisfaction.\n\nAs stipulated in the Faculty Handbook, apart from absences for observance of religious holidays, faculty may set their own attendance policies and have discretion to designate absences for other reasons as \"excused\" or \"unexcused\" based upon their professional judgment.\n\nClass Absence Policy and Procedure for Athletes\n\nIntercollegiate athletic competition provides young men and women with opportunities for character development and learning that are not necessarily available in the classroom context. This is particularly true at the Division III level, where athletics remain unsullied by the pressures imposed by scholarships, high exposure, and the need to promote revenue-generating events. As a consequence, Washington and Lee University encourages students to take maximum advantage of opportunities at the University to engage in intercollegiate athletics. This is part of their education. At the same time the University and the Department of Physical Education and Athletics recognize that the primary goal of a university education is intellectual development. As a consequence, student-athletes are fully expected to devote themselves to their courses and to their intellectual development in no less a fashion than they would were they not engaged in intercollegiate competition.\n\nTo accommodate these twin goals of intellectual development and athletic participation, the Department of Physical Education and Athletics makes every effort to schedule “the time, place, and duration of team practices and contests” in a manner that avoids conflicts with students’ class schedules (Mission Statement of the Department of Physical Education and Athletics). With respect to practices and team meetings, the faculty and coaching staff understand that class attendance takes precedence over participation in athletics. Furthermore, full class participation in courses that may cause students to miss occasional practices will not, in itself, prejudice the coaches in the selection of team participants.\n\nOn occasion, University-sanctioned athletic events may unavoidably conflict with academic schedules. In those situations, student-athletes are not automatically entitled to exemptions from class attendance. However, given the Athletic Department’s commitment to the academic mission of the University, professors are encouraged to accommodate those conflicts whenever doing so will not damage the individual student-athlete’s academic performance. In this regard, students who participate in intercollegiate athletics should review their calendars to see which athletic contests, if any, conflict with their academic schedules. Each student is responsible for discussing any scheduling conflict with his or her professors at the beginning of the term or as soon as possible after the student learns of the conflict. The ultimate goal is a reasonable accommodation of academic and athletic pursuits.\n\nProgress Toward Degree\n\nAll students at Washington and Lee are expected to make steady progress toward completing their degree requirements. Their progress is judged by the quality of their academic work as measured by their grade-point averages. Withdrawal from courses, repetition of courses, incomplete courses, and transfer courses may have an effect on a student’s grade-point average, total credits attempted, or number of terms completed toward degree requirements. Eligibility for federal Title IV aid is determined by the Satisfactory Academic Progress guidelines listed in the financial aid section of the catalog.\n\nFailure to make the minimum progress as defined below for undergraduate students will result in academic probation or in the students being suspended under the Automatic Rule.\n\nAcademic Probation\n\nThe Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement places students on academic probation whenever their term GPA or cumulative GPA falls below 2.000.\n\nStudents placed on academic probation are warned of their precarious position and advised to limit their participation in extracurricular activities during the period of their probation. Students who do not resolve their probationary status within the timeframes described below receive academic suspension under the Automatic Rule. Term specific information follows.\n\nAt the end of the fall term, a student is put on probation if:\n\nthe fall-term grade-point average is below 2.000 and/or\n\nthe cumulative grade-point average is below 2.000.\n\nThese students will be on probation during the following winter term, at the end of which they must have a term and cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.000 to avoid academic suspension under the Automatic Rule.\n\nAt the end of the winter term, a student is put on probation if:\n\nthe winter-term grade-point average is below 2.000 and/or\n\nthe cumulative grade-point average is below 2.000.\n\nThese students will be on probation during the following spring and fall terms. A spring-term grade-point average at or above 2.000 will not remove the student from academic probation, even if the cumulative grade-point average is over 2.000 at the end of the spring term. Rather, probation extends into the following 13-week fall term when the probation is either removed (via cumulative and term grade-point averages at or above 2.000) or converted to academic suspension.\n\nAt the end of the spring term, a student is put on probation if:\n\nthe spring-term grade-point average is below 2.000 and/or\n\nthe cumulative grade-point average is below 2.000.\n\nThese students will be on probation during the following fall term, at the end of which they must have a term and cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.000 to avoid academic suspension under the Automatic Rule.\n\nAutomatic Rule (Academic Suspension)\n\nAt the end of any academic term, the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement suspends students who are on probation if they fail to meet either the term grade-point average or cumulative grade-point average standards described above. Suspension from the university severs all connections and privileges associated with being a student at Washington and Lee.\n\nThe following also fall under the Automatic Rule:\n\nFirst-year students whose first-term grade-point average falls below 1.000; or\n\nThose students who have been reinstated on probation and who have failed to meet the grade-point standard required by the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement; or\n\nThose students withdrawing from the university during any term for reasons other than medical and having a cumulative grade-point average below 2.000; or\n\nAt the end of the winter term, those students unable to remove their probationary status by attempting no more than four credits during the spring term; or\n\nContinuing education students (University employees taking courses for credit) with a failing grade in two concurrent or consecutive courses.\n\nA student who has been suspended from the university under the Automatic Rule may apply for reinstatement after a minimum absence of one year (see the details and requirements for this process at “Reinstatement” or in the Reinstatement section of this handbook below). Such students are placed on academic probation if reinstated. Though rarely granted, a student may appeal for immediate reinstatement. Students petitioning for immediate reinstatement may appeal in writing to the Dean of Student Life, Chair of the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement, by 12 noon US Eastern time on the Friday following release of grades for fall, winter, or spring terms. (See the application at https://intranet.wlu.edu/registrar/FormsUnivReg/reinstate-app.pdf.)\n\nStudent Disability Accommodations\n\nIt is the policy of the Washington and Lee University and its School of Law to provide equal access to educational opportunities to qualified students with physical or mental disabilities, in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Students requesting accommodation will need to provide appropriate documentation of: (1) a disability, which is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; and (2) a need for accommodation, by virtue of the specific functional limitations of the disability, to have equal access to educational opportunities. The University and the School of Law intend to provide an interactive process of dialogue and timely exchange of information between either the Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, Commons 237, Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia 24450, (540) 458-4055 (undergraduate students) or the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging, Sydney Lewis Hall 417, Washington and Lee University School of Law, Lexington, Virginia 24450, (540) 458-8162 (law students).\n\nIt is the responsibility of a student (undergraduate or law) with a physical or mental disability who may require any type of accommodation to make the accommodation request in a timely manner. In order to allow sufficient time for the eligibility and accommodation decision process and to make arrangements for appropriate accommodations, the student should contact the relevant contact person (Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources for undergraduate students and Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging, for law students) and submit the documents required for consideration of disability accommodations in accordance with the applicable timelines and documentation guidelines set forth in the relevant policy and/or protocol (Undergraduate Disability Accommodation Policy; Law Student Disability Accommodation Policy). The Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources or the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging will inform the student of further specific procedures and any additional required documentation.\n\nLeave of Absence\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nUndergraduate students who wish to leave the University temporarily for academic, medical, religious or military-service reasons, may request a Leave of Absence for a specified period of time by petitioning the Committee on Automatic Rule and Reinstatement. Students on academic or conduct probation are not eligible for leaves, except for medical leaves. Leaves are normally approved for up to one academic year. The application (http://registrar.wlu.edu/forms) must be submitted to the Dean of Student Life, who is the Chair of the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement. International students should also contact the Center for International Education to discuss eligibility and potential visa issues.\n\nLeaves planned in advance must be requested at least three weeks before the beginning of the term during which the student wants to be absent from W&L. Requests for unexpected (e.g., health-related) leaves must be made immediately and are not considered retroactively.\n\nMedical leaves must be supported by Student Health and University Counseling. Students must submit medical documentation in support of the leave with their application and/or in support of readiness to return, as feasible under the circumstances. Students must also submit with their application consent for the Director of the Student Health Center and/or Director of University Counseling to communicate with the health care and/or mental health care provider in order to make an informed, individualized, objective recommendation to the applicable University administrators on the appropriateness of the leave of absence, readiness to return, and follow up treatment needs.\n\nAcademic leaves of absence are normally granted only for the purpose of academic enrichment. Students taking courses elsewhere while on leave of absence must request departmental approval in advance for any course to be used for degree credit, particularly major or FDR requirements.\n\nOther types of leaves will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFor the purpose of federal or other official government enrollment statuses only (federal loans, international visas, etc.), students on Spring Option will be reported as being enrolled Less Than Half-Time and, if they do not return to W&L, as Voluntarily Withdrawn effective with the end of winter term. This withdrawal date will affect the terms of repayment for any federal student loans students may have received. Graduating seniors' grace period would thus begin in April and repayment would normally begin in October.\n\nReturn is contingent upon approval of a Return from Leave of Absence application and good conduct in the interim. Return is also contingent on an acceptable academic record during an academic leave and/or on readiness to resume full-time academic and campus life after a medical leave, with or without reasonable accommodation, as determined by the University. The University reserves the right to request appropriate documentation, determined on a case-by-case basis, to confirm that the student is qualified and/or ready for return. Students found to be not ready or academically qualified to return in the judgment of the University, after an individualized assessment based on best available current information, will be considered to have voluntarily withdrawn. Such students may apply for reinstatement (see go.wlu.edu/ugr-reinstate).\n\nStudents who do not return for the specified term will be withdrawn retroactive to their leave date and may face financial consequences. Leaves of longer than 180 days may also have financial consequences.\n\nStudent conduct issues arising during a leave of absence may result in referral for discipline prior to or upon return to the University, which could lead to suspension or required withdrawal from the University.\n\nLaw Students\n\nLaw students wishing to request a leave of absence should contact the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging.\n\nNote: The University applies this policy and associated procedures in a nondiscriminatory manner, in consultation with qualified professionals, as appropriate, and will make each reinstatement or readmission determination based on an individualized assessment of that student's situation and what is in the best interests of the student, the campus community, and the University.\n\nAppealing Grades\n\nStudents who believe their class work has been unfairly evaluated have the right to bring the matter to the attention of the head of the department concerned. The head of the department may then discuss the grade with the faculty member involved. However, the determination of any student’s grade remains the responsibility of the faculty member teaching the course.\n\nVoluntary Withdrawal\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nStudents who withdraw voluntarily sever their connection with the University. Students must accomplish withdrawal during a term through the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students (or designee). Those students withdrawing from the university during any term for reasons other than medical and having a cumulative grade-point average below 2.000 will fall under the Automatic Rule. A voluntary withdrawal will have an effect on academic grades and/or credits, refund of applicable fees, and access to University housing or other facilities. The University will consider students not returning for a subsequent term to have withdrawn voluntarily. Students who withdraw voluntarily may apply for reinstatement (see the details and requirements for this process in the Reinstatement section below.)\n\nLaw Students\n\nLaw students who withdraw voluntarily sever their connection with the School of Law. Students must accomplish withdrawal during a term through the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging (or designee). A voluntary withdrawal will have an effect on academic grades and/or credits, refund of applicable fees, and access to University facilities. The School of Law shall consider students not returning for a subsequent term to have withdrawn voluntarily. Students who withdraw voluntarily may apply for reinstatement (see the details and requirements for this process in the Reinstatement section below.)\n\nRequired Administrative Withdrawal for Academic Reasons\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nA student taking an unauthorized underload or maintaining an unapproved extended absence from classes (two weeks or more during the fall or winter term and one week or more during the spring term, without contacting the appropriate Dean's office) may be required to withdraw from the University for the term in which that conduct occurs, forfeiting all academic credit, tuition and fees for that term. The appropriate Dean will inform the student of the withdrawal, along with the steps that the student must take to apply for reinstatement.\n\nLaw Students\n\nIn accordance with the accreditation standards of the American Bar Association, the School of Law requires prompt and regular class attendance. The School of Law also expects its students to prepare for their classes diligently and to complete course assignments in a timely and professional manner. A professor has the authority to reduce a student's grade for poor attendance, lack of preparation, or failure to complete course assignments on time. In extreme or chronic cases of poor attendance, lack of preparation, or failure to complete course assignments on time, a professor has the authority to give the student a failing grade or to deny the student the right to sit for the final exam. In the case of a student's failure to satisfy attendance and other obligations in multiple courses, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, after consultation with the Dean, may impose other sanctions, including withdrawal from a course or courses or withdrawal from school.\n\nFamily Notification\n\nThe University expects students themselves to notify family members when they withdraw from the University. However, the University retains the discretion to notify parents, guardians or spouses of student withdrawals, which constitute a change in a student’s official enrollment status, with student consent or when the University deems it appropriate to do so and in accordance with the University’s student records policy.\n\nReinstatement\n\nStudents who withdraw voluntarily or who are withdrawn administratively from or suspended by the University may apply for reinstatement.\n\nUndergraduate applications for reinstatement are available online at go.wlu.edu/ugr-reinstatement. Undergraduate students must return the completed application, along with all required materials, so that the Dean of Student Life, the Chair of the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement, receives it by 4:30 p.m. (US Eastern time) November 15 for winter term, March 1 for spring term, and May 15 or August 1 for fall term.\n\nThe University will not reinstate an undergraduate student for a spring term unless that student has both: 1) satisfactorily completed at least one fall or winter term at Washington and Lee University, and 2) was registered for a full-time course load through midterm during at least one of the two preceding 13-week terms at Washington and Lee. This means that first-year and new transfer students who withdraw during the winter term are not eligible to apply for reinstatement for spring term unless they have completed the fall term in the same academic year. Undergraduate applications for reinstatement are reviewed and acted upon at the discretion of the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement (\"the Committee\"). See https://catalog.wlu.edu/content.php?catoid=36&navoid=3529&hl=%22reinstatement%22&returnto=search#REINSTATE.\n\nLaw student applications for readmission are available from the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging or Director of Law Records. Law students must return the completed application, along with all required materials, so that the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging receives it by November 15 for spring term or July 1 for fall term. The Law School will not readmit a law student unless the student can complete his or her degree within six (6) years of beginning it (see law school catalog for exception for reinstatement after active duty military service). The Dean of the Law School (or designee) will review and act upon applications for law students.\n\nIn all reinstatement cases (whether the withdrawal was voluntary or involuntary, including suspensions), the University reserves the right to require sufficient documentation, determined on a case-by-case basis, that the student is qualified and ready to return to full-time academic work and campus life. Depending on the particular circumstances and reasons for the individual student's withdrawal, this may involve an on-campus interview with one or more appropriate university officials and/or submission of a written progress assessment from a treating health professional indicating that the student is qualified and ready to resume the particular rigors and essential requirements of full-time academic work and campus life at Washington and Lee, with or without reasonable accommodation, and that his/her treatment and care needs, if applicable, can be supported at Washington and Lee.\n\nIn cases where the University requires a written progress assessment from a treating health professional, the Director of Student Health and/or the Director of University Counseling will require a release from the student to discuss current treatment and follow-up needs with the treating health professional, in order to assess whether the student is qualified and ready to return to the particular rigors and essential requirements of full-time academic work and campus life at Washington and Lee, with or without reasonable accommodation, and whether the University can provide the follow-up care needed to maintain the student's enrollment. The Director of Student Health and/or Director of University Counseling will review this information and recommend to the Committee or Dean of the Law School or designee approval (with or without conditions of treatment, education, counseling, or other) or denial of the reinstatement/readmission. Members of the Committee or Dean of the Law School or designee may review the health professional’s written progress assessment and/or relevant health care records when needed to inform their decision-making.\n\nAfter consulting with University health professionals and/or other appropriate university officials as necessary to facilitate an informed decision, the Committee or Dean of the Law School or designee will act on the application. Decisions regarding undergraduate reinstatement are made at the sole discretion of the Committee on the Automatic Rule and Reinstatement or, for law-student readmission, the Dean of the Law School or designee. For more information about undergraduate student reinstatement procedures, consult the University Web page at https://my.wlu.edu/student-life/policies-and-guidelines/reinstatement.\n\nNote: The University applies this policy and associated procedures in a nondiscriminatory manner, in consultation with qualified professionals, as appropriate, and will make each reinstatement or readmission determination based on an individualized assessment of that student’s situation and what is in the best interests of the student, the campus community, and the University.\n\nBoard of Trustees Policy on Withholding of Degrees\n\nThe Board of Trustees reserves the right to withhold the degree of any student who has been convicted of a felony by a court in any jurisdiction. Upon the satisfactory completion of that student’s court-imposed sentence, including any period of supervised probation, the Board may approve the awarding of such degree.\n\nThe Board may postpone approval of a degree for any student who has been charged with a felony in any jurisdiction when such charge is pending at the time the degree is to be awarded.\n\nV. University Policies and Procedures — Non-Academic\n\nStatement on Student Behavior\n\nAdmission to the Washington and Lee community carries with it certain expectations concerning personal conduct. These expectations are specifically covered by the Honor System. Other less specific expectations concern the way we treat each other. The community expects civil, decent behavior designed to encourage mutual respect for our individual differences, desires, and ways of thinking.\n\nInstances of uncivil behavior involving students are most effectively dealt with in personal and informal ways, not by formal conduct procedures. Therefore, members of the Washington and Lee community who believe they have been objects of such behavior should first seek resolution by personal consultation with friends, faculty, designated advisers, or others who may intervene in the dispute. If such direct efforts do not resolve the matter, instances of uncivil behavior involving students may be reported to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students. The University will take appropriate action by resolving the matter, referring the matter to other resources for informal resolution where appropriate, or to the designated conduct body. One of four conduct bodies may exercise formal procedures:\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Student Body (EC) oversees the Honor System and hears cases of breaches of trust such as lying, cheating, and stealing.\n\nThe Student Judicial Council (SJC) hears allegations of alcohol policy violations and other types of student misconduct, including hazing by individuals or by organizations not under the jurisdiction of the Interfraternity Council.\n\nThe Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Board (HSMB) hears allegations of prohibited discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and sexual misconduct.\n\nThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) hears allegations of hazing, retaliation associated with hazing, and other violations of University policy by fraternities that are members of the IFC.\n\nThreat to the Community: Action of the President\n\nStudents or student organizations may be required to sever their connection with the University for non-academic reasons by disciplinary action as outlined in the Student Handbook. In cases where the University has reason to believe that a student or student organization represents a threat to the well-being of the University community, the President or designee, may suspend or dismiss the student, suspend a student organization, or take other appropriate action. Students who are suspended may apply for reinstatement after the period of suspension. Student organizations may apply for reinstatement after the period of suspension. Students and student organizations who are dismissed from the University are precluded from returning to Washington and Lee.\n\nNote: The University applies this policy and associated procedures in a nondiscriminatory manner, in consultation with qualified professionals, and will make each determination based on an individualized assessment of that student’s situation, observations of student conduct, actions, and statements, and their impact on others and the campus community, not on mere perceptions or speculations.\n\nRequired Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Academic Reasons\n\nWashington and Lee University is committed to the well-being and safety of its community members and the integrity of its learning environment. The University may require a student to take an administrative withdrawal if there is a sufficient showing that: (1) the student is engaging or is likely to engage in behavior that presents a significant risk of substantial harm to others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation; or (2) is engaging or is likely to engage in behavior that substantially disrupts the learning environment and activities of the campus community; or (3) that the student is not otherwise qualified to participate in university programs or activities, with or without reasonable accommodation, including but not limited to a determination that the student requires a level of treatment and care which the University cannot provide to support the student’s continued enrollment and presence on campus. Any of the above circumstances will support a required administrative withdrawal when based on a reasonable, individualized assessment of current objective information, in consultation with qualified professionals, as appropriate.\n\nThis policy and associated procedures do not take the place of sanctions associated with a student's behavior that is in violation of University policies, standards, or regulations. This policy is to be invoked in extraordinary circumstances in which, in the discretion of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students or the Dean of the Law School (“appropriate Dean”) or designee, the conduct board process cannot be used or is not appropriate.\n\nThis policy may be invoked when a student is unable or unwilling to request a voluntary withdrawal and the appropriate Dean or designee deems a withdrawal necessary to protect the health and safety of the campus community or the integrity of the learning environment and campus programs and activities. Examples of such extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to: ongoing substance abuse, threats or acts of harm to others, or bizarre or destructive behavior causing trauma to others and disruption to the campus community. Before a required administrative withdrawal is considered, the appropriate Dean or designee will encourage the student to take a voluntary withdrawal. The procedures related to this policy appear below. A withdrawal form (registrar.wlu.edu/forms) will be filed with the University Registrar’s office by the appropriate Dean or designee.\n\nA student who is involuntarily withdrawn may apply for reinstatement under the detailed process and requirements set out above (see also \"Reinstatement\" in the catalog).\n\nNote: The University applies this policy and associated procedures in a nondiscriminatory manner, in consultation with qualified professionals, and will make each determination based on an individualized assessment of that student’s situation, observations of student conduct, actions, and statements, and their impact on others and the campus community, not on mere perceptions or speculations.\n\nProcedures\n\nConsideration of Required Administrative Withdrawal\n\nThe Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students or designee will consider required administrative withdrawal for undergraduates. The Dean of the Law School or designee will consider required administrative withdrawal for law students. Upon learning of a student’s behavior from among a variety of sources (such as Student Health Center, University Counseling, Public Safety, Residence Life staff, a student’s adviser, etc.), the appropriate dean or designee may initiate the following procedures, as deemed appropriate:\n\nThe appropriate dean or designee will notify the student that a required administrative withdrawal is under consideration and will afford the student an opportunity to discuss the behavior and circumstances at the time. The appropriate dean or designee will discuss with the student the implications of a required administrative withdrawal and the relevant procedures and will provide the student with a copy of this policy. Whenever possible and appropriate, the appropriate dean or designee will encourage the student to take a voluntary withdrawal from the University. The appropriate dean or designee may involve a parent, guardian, or spouse in this process with student consent, or when the appropriate dean or designee deems it appropriate to do so and in accordance with the University’s student records policy as applicable.\n\nThe appropriate dean or designee also will confer as appropriate and feasible with the following University resources, or others as appropriate to the circumstances, regarding the need for a required administrative withdrawal under the policy:\n\nUniversity Physicians\n\nUniversity Counselors\n\nOffice of Public Safety\n\nResidence Life Staff\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nFaculty Adviser\n\nAcademic Deans\n\nThe appropriate dean or designee may require an evaluation of the student’s behavior and any relevant physical/mental conditions by an appropriate medical professional if the dean or designee believes that an evaluation will facilitate an informed decision. This evaluation may be done by University physicians/counselors, or by outside health professionals, including the student’s treating health professional, as indicated and appropriate in the appropriate dean’s or designee’s judgment.\n\nFollowing these consultations and the review of all relevant information available, the appropriate dean or designee will make a decision regarding the required administrative withdrawal. At any time prior to the appropriate dean’s or designee’s decision, the student may choose to take a voluntary withdrawal, subject to a showing of readiness to resume full-time academic work and campus life at the time of any application for reinstatement, under the policy and procedures for reinstatement (see Reinstatement section).\n\nIn cases involving an imminent threat to health or safety, the appropriate dean or designee has the discretion to take immediate action to remove the student from campus pending receipt and review of all relevant information.\n\nRequired Administrative Withdrawal Imposed\n\nThe appropriate dean or designee will give the student advance written notice of a required administrative withdrawal including the beginning date of the withdrawal and the steps that the student must take to request reinstatement. The appropriate dean or designee will notify a parent, guardian, or spouse of the withdrawal, either with the student’s consent or when he/she deems it appropriate and in the student’s best interest to do so, in accordance with the University’s student records policy.\n\nThe student must leave campus within the time frame established by the appropriate dean or designee in the required administrative withdrawal notice. The appropriate dean or designee may ask a parent, guardian, spouse, or other appropriate individual to make arrangements to remove the student from the University. If the student refuses to leave campus after imposition of a required administrative withdrawal, the appropriate dean or designee may implement an enforced administrative withdrawal, equivalent to an immediate suspension. During the duration of the withdrawal, the student may visit the campus only with prior written authorization from the appropriate dean or designee.\n\nA student may appeal a required administrative withdrawal under this policy to the Provost; however, at the discretion of the appropriate dean or designee the withdrawal may remain in effect during the appeal. A student who wishes to appeal must do so in a written letter of appeal delivered to the Provost within three (3) business days of receipt of the appropriate dean or designee’s withdrawal decision. The written appeal must state specifically why the student believes the appropriate dean’s or designee’s decision is not warranted under the circumstances. After reviewing the written appeal, the Provost may meet with the student and consult with the appropriate dean or designee and/or other University officials, as he or she deems necessary, before reaching a decision. The decision of the Provost is final.\n\nRequired Administrative Withdrawal Not Imposed\n\nIn the event that a required administrative withdrawal is not imposed, the appropriate dean or designee may impose specific conditions and/or requirements for the student to have continued enrollment and presence at Washington and Lee, after an individualized assessment of the student’s situation. One of these requirements may be a behavioral contract. Non-compliance with such conditions/requirements will result in reconsideration of a required administrative withdrawal from the University. The appropriate dean or designee will notify a parent, guardian or spouse of the specific conditions and requirements for the student’s continued enrollment, either with the student’s consent or when he/she deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the student to do so, in accordance with the University’s student records policy as applicable.\n\nProhibited Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Retaliation\n\nUnder the University's Nondiscrimination/Equal Employment Opportunity Statement (go.wlu.edu/OGC/NonDiscrimination), students, faculty, and staff have the right to be free from prohibited discrimination, harassment, and retaliation within the University community. Specifically, the University prohibits discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, veteran's status, and genetic information in its educational programs and activities and with regard to employment as described and addressed in the University Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Other Than Sex. The University also prohibits discrimination, harassment and retaliation on the basis of sex and gender, including sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity, stalking, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, and domestic and dating violence as described and addressed in the separate Interim Sexual Discrimination and Misconduct Policy, the University prohibits retaliation against any individual who brings a good faith complaint under either policy, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this policy, or engaged in bystander intervention of misconduct. Such conduct violates not only University policy and expectations of personal integrity and respect for others but may also violate state and federal law. Students, faculty, and staff found to have violated either policy will be disciplined appropriately, up to and including termination from employment or dismissal from the University.\n\nThe University Policy on Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Other Than Sex is available at go.wlu.edu/OGC/DiscriminationPolicy.\n\nThe Interim Sexual Discrimination and Misconduct Policy is available in full at Appendix A to this handbook and at go.wlu.edu/OGC/SexualMisconductPolicy.\n\nBoard of Trustees Policy Statement on Substance Abuse\n\nThe Board of Trustees of Washington and Lee University condemns irresponsible alcohol distribution and consumption. Abusive consumption of alcohol and illegal drug use are inconsistent with the core values of Washington and Lee University. The Board expects W&L students to act responsibly and to conduct themselves in accordance with the applicable laws and University policies on alcohol and drugs. The Board is committed to combating cultural causes of substance abuse on campus. The Board is committed to reducing substance abuse by students through comprehensive education and counseling programs, and effective discipline requiring individual and organizational accountability for alcohol and drug policy violations.\n\nAlcohol and Illegal Drugs/Controlled Substances/Tobacco Products\n\nWashington and Lee University supports the Commonwealth of Virginia laws on the licensing, distribution and consumption of alcoholic beverages. A fundamental principle of the Washington and Lee University Policy on Alcohol is that students are adults who are personally responsible for conforming their behavior to state and local laws and University policy.\n\nWashington and Lee Public Safety works with the Lexington Police, the Rockbridge County Sheriff, and the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to promote awareness of and adherence to the alcohol laws.\n\nFurthermore, Washington and Lee University supports the Commonwealth of Virginia and federal laws on the possession, use, sale, or transfer of illegal drugs/controlled substances and tobacco products. It is the responsibility of all members of the University community to abide by those laws.\n\nThrough the appropriate University administrative offices, committees and organizations, Washington and Lee University conducts on-going educational programs to acquaint students with the Commonwealth of Virginia and federal laws on alcohol and other drugs, the health dangers of the abuse of alcohol and other drugs, and the medical and counseling resources available for students. A student who violates Washington and Lee University’s alcohol and/or drug policies will be referred to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students to be handled administratively or by the Student Judicial Council. Resolution of the alleged violation will be handled in accordance with the University Policies on Alcohol and Other Drugs.\n\nHazing\n\nWashington and Lee University prohibits hazing and encourages reporting of alleged violations of this policy. This policy applies to all University students, and student organizations.\n\nHazing is defined by Virginia law at Va. Code §18.2-56 as follows: \"hazing\" means to recklessly or intentionally endanger the health or safety of a student or students or to inflict bodily injury on a student or students in connection with or for the purpose of initiation, admission into or affiliation with or as a condition for continued membership in a club, organization, association, fraternity, sorority, or student body regardless of whether the student or students so endangered or injured participated voluntarily in the relevant activity.\n\nAllegations of hazing or retaliation by individuals or student organizations not under the jurisdiction of the Interfraternity Council (IFC) will be referred to the Student Judicial Council (this includes our NPC and NPHC organizations). Allegations of hazing or retaliation by fraternities is under the jurisdiction of the IFC.\n\nReporting Potential Violations of This Policy\n\nThere are multiple avenues for students, parents, faculty, staff, and community members to report hazing. If you see or hear something that concerns you, please report it to support the health and safety of our students. The University is best positioned to respond to hazing concerns when we receive accurate, timely, and factual information. Please do not assume others have reported the concern - we would rather receive multiple reports than none at all.\n\nWhile all cases of suspected hazing or retaliation should be reported to the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, other ways to report a hazing or retaliation concern include:\n\n• If there is immediate concern for safety, please call 911 before taking any next steps.\n\n• Submit a report through Silent Witness or the Live Save App [ Google Play | App Store ]\n\n• Contact Public Safety directly 540-458-8999\n\n• Talk with a member of the community who can assist you with reporting. Some of these people might include: a Student Affairs dean, adviser of your organization, coach, trainer, member of student affairs staff, RA or CA.\n\nRetaliation is prohibited against any individual who, in good faith, reports allegations of hazing, or cooperates in an investigation or adjudication under this policy. Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, physical, verbal, or written harassment, threats, or intimidation of any person(s) who in good faith reports an alleged violation of this policy, or cooperates in an investigation or adjudication under this policy.\n\nComputing Resources, Network and Email Use Policy\n\nPlease see go.wlu.edu/OGC/AcceptableUse for the most current version of this policy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nWashington and Lee University provides computing and network resources to its students primarily for educational purposes and to its faculty and staff primarily for work purposes. The University may provide access to other users at its discretion. Use of the University's computing and network resources is a privilege. All users are expected to exercise personal and professional responsibility and integrity when using these resources.\n\nApplicability\n\nThis policy applies to all users of University owned or managed computer-related equipment, computer systems, and interconnecting networks, as well as all information contained therein.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThere are no definitions applicable to this policy.\n\nPolicy\n\nThe University enforces necessary restrictions, which may be revised from time to time, to protect its computing and network resources, including the revocation of use privileges for unauthorized or inappropriate use. The Chief Technology Officer or designee is authorized to temporarily suspend use privileges in any case he or she deems appropriate until final resolution of the matter. While the University desires to maintain user privacy and to avoid the unnecessary interruption of user activities, and while the University does not monitor the content of user activities, the University reserves the right to investigate concerns of unauthorized or improper use of University resources, as appropriate.\n\nThe campus network, including its servers and associated software, is the property of Washington and Lee University. Neither the network pathways nor W&L-owned computer systems are to be used:\n\nfor purposes incompatible with established University policies, procedures, protocols or applicable laws;\n\nfor unauthorized commercial enterprise;\n\nfor harassing, fraudulent, or threatening purposes; or\n\nfor pirating software, music or images.\n\nThe following activities are nonexclusive examples of those that are not permitted and that may lead to suspension or revocation of use privileges and other penalties or discipline:\n\nunauthorized access, attempts to gain unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or violation of the University's Confidentiality Policy (go.wlu.edu/OGC/Confidentiality) involving the University's computing and network resources;\n\nmisrepresenting or attempting to misrepresent one's identity;\n\naltering or tampering with the configuration of computers in student labs and other common areas, or installing unauthorized games or other programs on their hard disks or on the shared-files area of the file servers;\n\nany network activity that impedes the flow of network traffic, significantly diminishes the availability of resources to other users, or imposes avoidable burdens on other users (for example, sending mass e-mails instead of using the appropriate services available for communicating with the entire community or large sub-groups); or\n\nthe unauthorized physical or virtual extension or re-configuration of any portion of the campus network by such means as routers (wired or wireless), wireless access points, network wiring, or other methods.\n\nStudents, faculty, staff, and volunteers with access to confidential data are reminded of the University's Confidentiality Policy (go.wlu.edu/OGC/Confidentiality). Among other things, the policy states that electronic documents and files containing confidential information are to be accessed, used, and disclosed only with explicit authorization and only on a need-to-know basis for either an employee's job functions or volunteer's service.\n\nSocial Media Guidelines\n\nSocial media have become powerful communications tools with significant advantages in telling the University's story to both internal and external audiences. With such tools as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Vimeo, LinkedIn, and blogs along with such image-sharing sites as Flickr and Picasa, members of the University community can provide instantaneous content on the Internet to individuals around the world. With the power of social media come responsibilities. These guidelines provide best practices under which members of the W&L community should operate when using these tools. The basic principle is that members of the community are expected to adhere to the same levels of civility in their online conversations as in their face-to-face conversations. The same laws, University policies, guidelines, and personal and professional expectations for interacting with all University constituents apply online as in the real world. For example, posting hate speech or confidential information about university students may constitute a violation of existing university policies and would be handled as such.\n\nSince social media are constantly changing, these best practices may be updated frequently. The Digital Communications office is available to offer support and advice in efforts to establish a social media presence and in exploring new social media tools.\n\nNothing in these guidelines prohibits employees from discussing the terms and conditions of their employment as authorized by law.\n\nBest Practices for All Social Media Users\n\nSocial media has the ability to send your message around the world instantaneously. Consider these tips before getting started - https://my.wlu.edu/communications-and-public-affairs/content-marketing-and-media/social-media/social-media-guidelines/best-practices-for-all-social-media-users.\n\nBest Practices for Individuals Posting on an Official University Account\n\nWhen you manage a social media presence for a department, office or organization at Washington and Lee, you are no longer representing yourself, but the University. Consider these tips before getting started - https://my.wlu.edu/communications-and-public-affairs/content-marketing-and-media/social-media/social-media-guidelines/best-practices-for-individuals-posting-on-an-official-university-account.\n\nPeer-to-Peer File Sharing\n\nIn August, 2003, the University implemented a ban on the use of peer-to-peer file-swapping software on computers attached to the University network. The programs, including KaZaA, Morpheus, iMesh, Gnutella, LimeWire, Grokster, and other descendants of Napster, are used nearly exclusively to download and allow the uploading of copyright-protected music, movies, software, and other works, likely in violation of federal law.\n\nSharing protected works by unauthorized copying is not only a violation of copyright law but also a violation of the University's Computer and Network Use Policy, which forbids use of the network \"for purposes incompatible with established University codes and regulations or applicable laws.\"\n\nAgents of copyright owners have become increasingly aggressive in pursuing violators on university networks, filing suits seeking tens of thousands of dollars in damages from some students and other users. The ban seeks to protect users from exposure to such liability, to adhere to the copyright laws, and to protect network capacity for educational uses.\n\nThe use of peer-to-peer computer file sharing programs (e.g., KaZaA, Morpheus, LimeWire, iMesh, Gnuttella, Grokster, and all similar programs and their successors) that are primarily employed to share copyrighted works is prohibited on the campus network. Where possible, banned file swapping will be intercepted and blocked by network control systems. The use of methods designed to evade that blocking is prohibited. For help in removing file swapping software from a computer, call the Information Desk at xHELP (x4357). Specific exceptions to this policy may be approved by the Chief Technology Officer in instances where such programs will be used exclusively for educational/research purposes and in a manner that complies with all US copyright laws.\n\nCopyright\n\nIt is the policy and intent of Washington and Lee University that all members of the University community adhere to the provisions of United States copyright law. A copyright grants to its owner the right to control an intellectual or artistic creation, to prohibit others from using the work in specific ways without permission, and to profit from the sale and performance of the work. Copyright protection extends beyond copies of the written word and recordings of sound to include visual and animated images, and encompasses \"hard copy\" and electronic use and duplication of protected works. Each member of the University community must take some individual responsibility for copyright compliance. The University has developed extensive guidelines to assist and direct faculty, students, and staff in their compliance obligations. The full University Policy for the Use of Copyrighted Works can be found at go.wlu.edu/OGC/CopyrightPolicy. Conforming to this policy may in some cases result in additional costs to the student for course materials and some additional inconvenience and time delay in the preparation procedure of those materials. Members of the University community who willfully disregard the copyright policy do so at their own risk.\n\nWhatever gray areas there may be in copyright law, offering for sharing over the network a recording, movie, text, software, graphic image, or other work without the authorization of the owner of that work's copyright is unambiguously offering to \"distribute\" that work and subjects one to serious legal consequences. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other statutes require the University to cooperate in eliminating such activity.\n\nUsers must protect themselves and the University by not making copyrighted materials available over the Internet without the owner's authorization. Students must ensure that their computers are not offering to share copyrighted works. Faculty and staff may not use their University-owned computers to run file-sharing programs.\n\nFederal Penalties for Copyright Infringement\n\nCopyright infringement is the act of exercising, without permission or legal authority, one or more of the exclusive rights granted to the copyright owner under section 106 of the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the United States Code). These rights include the right to reproduce or distribute a copyrighted work. In the file-sharing context, downloading or uploading substantial parts of a copyrighted work without authority constitutes an infringement.\n\nPenalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or “statutory” damages set at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For “willful” infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney’s fees. For details, see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.\n\nWillful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.\n\nFor more information, please see W&L’s Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Policy (https://go.wlu.edu/OGC/P2P-Policy), W&L’s Plan to Deter Illegal Peer-to-Peer File Sharing (https://go.wlu.edu/OGC/P2P-Deterrence), and/or the website of the U.S. Copyright Office (www.copyright.gov), especially their FAQs (www.copyright.gov/help/faq).\n\nAudio/Video Recording of Classes\n\nStudents may not make audio or video recordings of classes without the advance written permission of the instructor. Students may use such recordings only for course purposes, may not distribute them outside the class, and are expected to destroy the recordings at the conclusion of the course term. The full policy is located at go.wlu.edu/OGC/RecordingOfClasses.\n\nPublic Performance of Copyrighted Works – Showing Movies\n\nThe Copyright Act protects audiovisual works such as films, videos, and DVDs and controls the showing of movies to any public group. Among the rights of a copyright holder is the right to authorize public performance (showing) of videotape or DVD copies of films subject to “fair use.” Showing of copyrighted films, videotapes, or DVDs generally is permissible in conjunction with teaching activities.\n\nIf a videotape or DVD is labeled “For Home Use Only,” the showing must fall under the face-to-face classroom teaching exemption, be licensed or be permissible as “fair use.” Unless a license is acquired, most performances (showings) of films, videotapes, or DVDs in a public room, or in a university building (including public areas of fraternities, sororities, and other university housing), for entertainment, whether a fee is charged or not, is an infringement.\n\nIf a performance license is needed, the University’s libraries will assist you in seeking permission by helping you locate the address of the producer’s permissions department. You will then need to fax or send a letter giving full details of what, where, when, how many times, admission policy, advertising, etc. Add a line for the permission agent’s signature and include a self-addressed stamped return envelope or a return fax number. Student organizations showing films for entertainment purposes are responsible for paying royalties.\n\nThe showing of a protected work for a legitimate educational purpose may qualify as \"fair use\" or fall within the exemption of classroom teaching and not require permission. More information is available in the University's Policy for the Use of Copyrighted Works (go.wlu.edu/OGC/CopyrightPolicy), especially Section IV.\n\nUse of W&L Names, Logos and Other Marks\n\nFaculty, staff, and students may use the University’s names, logos, and/or other marks (e.g. W&L, the W&L crest) where necessary to identify themselves on matters of official University business. Use of the University name for private purposes is limited to use purely for identification by a current or former member of the faculty, staff, and/or student body (e.g. “John Doe, Professor of Physics, Washington and Lee University,” or “John Doe, Class of ’79, W&L”). W&L names, logos, and other marks shall not be used by individuals or entities otherwise in a manner that implies University endorsement or responsibility for particular activities, products, or publications involved, or by any individual or group promoting itself, without the express written permission of the Provost or designee. Any and all use of the University names, logos, and/or other marks for commercial purposes is prohibited unless approved by the Treasurer or designee.\n\nFor more information, consult the University Policy on Intellectual Property at go.wlu.edu/OGC/IP- Policy.\n\nSmoking\n\nAll faculty, staff, students, vendors, and visitors to the University are expected to comply with Virginia law regarding the minimum age for persons purchasing or possessing tobacco products, nicotine vapor products and alternative products (21 years of age as of July 1, 2019, with an exception for active duty military personnel).\n\nSmoking, including e-cigarettes/nicotine vapor products and alternative nicotine products, is not permitted inside classroom buildings, administrative buildings, student residential buildings (including Greek and theme housing), dining areas, University Store, athletic facilities, or University owned or rented vehicles or within 25 feet of residential buildings (including Greek and theme housing). Smokers are asked to refrain from smoking in entranceways to buildings, or adjacent to open windows or air intakes, or in other outdoor areas where environmental smoke is not rapidly dispersed. All members of the University community are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect in honoring this policy.\n\nWeapons\n\nWashington and Lee University is committed to providing a safe and secure learning and working environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors on all campus properties. The use, possession and storage of firearms, components of firearms, live ammunition, crossbows, lowguns, BB guns, air guns, stun weapons, explosives, machetes, electric shock devices, knives (except pocket knives having a folding metal blade of less than three inches) or other dangerous articles are prohibited on all properties owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by Washington and Lee University. Law enforcement officers duly authorized to carry such instruments are excepted.\n\nAny person violating this policy will be subject to conduct sanctions including suspension or dismissal from the University or termination of employment. Student violations will be dealt with through the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students. Any suspected violations should be reported to the Director of Public Safety.\n\nMissing Student Notification Policy\n\nThis policy is established by Washington and Lee University in compliance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 and applies to all students at the University.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, a student may be considered to be a “missing person” if the student’s absence from campus is contrary to his or her usual pattern of behavior and W&L has reasonable belief that the unusual circumstances may have caused the absence. Such circumstances may include, but not be limited to, a report or suspicion that the student may be a victim of foul play; the student has expressed suicidal thoughts, may be drug dependent or in a life-threatening situation; or if the student is overdue returning to campus and is not heard from after giving a specific return time to friends or family.\n\nIf a member of the University Community has reason to believe that a student is missing, whether or not the student resides on campus, that individual should contact the University's Public Safety Office. Public Safety will collaborate with the Student Affairs staff to make an effort to locate the student and determine his or her state of health and well-being. Public Safety will gather pertinent information about the student from the reporting person. Such information may include description, cellular phone number, clothes last worn, vehicle description, information about the physical and emotional well-being of the student, an up-to-date photograph, etc.\n\nUniversity officials will also endeavor to determine the student's whereabouts through contact with friends, associates, and/or employers of the student, and determine whether the student has been attending classes, scheduled organizational or academic meetings, and work. If the student is an on-campus resident, Public Safety may make a welfare entry into the student's room. If the student resides off-campus, Public Safety will informally enlist the aid of the neighboring police agency having jurisdiction.\n\nIf a residential student is reported missing and cannot be located, certain notices will be made as follows:\n\nParents/Guardians will be notified within 24 hours (after Public Safety receives the initial missing person report) to determine whether they know the whereabouts of the student.\n\nLocal law enforcement will be notified within 24 hours after Public Safety determines that the student is missing.\n\nThe student’s designated emergency contact (if any) will be notified once Public Safety or local law enforcement personnel make a determination that the student has been missing for more than 24 hours.\n\nIf the student is an off-campus resident, Public Safety will notify appropriate family members or associates within 24 hours of receiving the initial report. These individuals will then be encouraged to make an official missing-person report to the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction. Public Safety will cooperate, aid, and assist the primary investigative agency as appropriate.\n\nAfter the student has been located, Public Safety will attempt to verify the student's state of health and intention of returning to the campus. When and where appropriate, a referral may be made to the Counseling Center and/or the Student Health Center.\n\nDesignation of Emergency Contact Information\n\nStudents will be given an opportunity during the fall-term matriculation process to designate an individual to be contacted by the University if the student is determined to be missing. Returning and transfer students will be given an opportunity to provide this information during the fall term. The designation will remain in effect until changed or revoked by the student. The form provided for the designation will state the circumstances in which the designated emergency contact information will be used, and will include a statement that the University is required by law to also notify the student’s custodial parent or guardian if the student is under 18 at the time he or she is discovered to be missing.\n\nCommunications about Missing Students\n\nIn accordance with established University emergency procedures, the Executive Director of Communications and Public Affairs will be part of the University's administrative response team and is the designated spokesperson to handle media inquiries concerning a missing student.\n\nThe local law enforcement agency in charge of the investigation and Public Safety will be consulted by the Executive Director of Communications and Public Affairs prior to any information release from the university so as not to jeopardize any investigation.\n\nInformation provided to the media to elicit public assistance in the search for the missing person will be handled by the local law enforcement agency.\n\nRequired Health Insurance\n\nBy University policy, all students are required to provide evidence of health and hospitalization insurance coverage each year, to supplement the health care provided by the University. This coverage may be in the form of an individual policy already in effect, inclusion in a family policy, or enrollment in the optional student health insurance plan offered to all Washington and Lee students. An online waiver must be completed annually for those who choose not to participate in the University-sponsored student health insurance plan. A Health Insurance Information Form must be completed by each entering student and returned to the University, along with a copy of all health insurance cards. Enrollment information for the student health insurance plan will be sent to all students during the summer. International students are required to purchase coverage through the University-sponsored student health insurance plan. The Administrative Assistant in the Student Health Center will assist students in filing claims for coverage under this plan. Students are responsible for updating their Student Health Center record with any changes in insurance coverage.\n\nVI. Contacts for Student Grievances and Concerns\n\nStudents who wish to bring a grievance or concern pertaining to University policies, procedures, or operations are encouraged to address their concern to the appropriate department head or official who oversees that area of University operations. Undergraduate students with disabilities who need assistance in addressing a grievance or concern should contact the Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources. Law students with disabilities who need assistance in addressing a grievance or concern should contact the Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging.\n\nIf a student has any doubt as to whom to direct a concern, the following officials may be contacted:\n\nStudent Life Concerns\n\nSidney Evans, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students\n\nDave Leonard, Dean of Student Life\n\nTamara Futrell, Dean for Diversity, Inclusion and Student Engagement\n\nMaria Saez Tatman, Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging (law students)\n\nHousing concerns (including assignments, roommate issues, and residence hall maintenance concerns)\n\nChris Reid, Director of Residence Life\n\nFinancial Aid Concerns\n\nJames Kaster, Director of Financial Aid\n\nFinancial Charges/Payments Concerns\n\nIrma Bailey, Associate Treasurer and Controller\n\nHarassment/Discrimination Concerns\n\nLauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources\n\nDisability Accommodations Concerns\n\nLauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources (undergraduate students)\n\nMaria Saez Tatman, Associate Dean of Law Student Affairs, Community, and Belonging (law students)\n\nStudent Employee Concerns\n\nKim Austin, Associate Director of Human Resources\n\nAll other non-academic concerns (including student conduct, public safety, and other campus life issues)\n\nSidney Evans, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students\n\nAcademic Concerns\n\nGrade Appeals\n\nUndergraduate Students - - Chair of the Academic Department (for the particular course)\n\nGrading, Academic Course Policy, and Fair Treatment by Faculty\n\nConcerns about grading, academic course policy, and fair treatment by faculty should be addressed to the department head of the department in question, and/or to the academic dean who supervises that division:\n\nCollege: Chawne Kimber, Dean of the College\n\nWilliams School: Rob Straughan, Dean of the Williams School\n\nLaw School: Melanie Wilson, Dean of the Law School\n\nAcademic concerns can also be conveyed to the Provost of the University, Lena Hill.\n\nDistance Learning\n\nConcerns relating to distance education covered by the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) should be addressed to the Provost of the University, Lena Hill.

Contact information for the Virginia SARA can be located at https://www.schev.edu/institutions/virginia-sara.\n\nAny concerns or inquiries regarding general academic policies should be addressed to the appropriate academic dean and/or to the University Registrar, Kim Robinson.\n\nVII. Student Judicial Policies and Procedures\n\nStatement of Goals for the Student Conduct System\n\nWashington and Lee is, above all else, an educational institution. The purpose of all our institutional activities, including conduct hearings, is to protect and promote our educational objectives. The training of conduct board members, the hearing procedures that are tailored to address specific types of misconduct and the overall structure of each conduct body are designed to create a system that upholds the University's standards--honor, integrity and civility--while providing fair process and judgment for students and student organizations.\n\nThe authority of the University to sanction students is independent of any criminal or other external legal action. University discipline is neither demanded by external legal efforts, nor is it precluded by the absence or failure of the state to act.\n\nAt the final faculty meeting before the respective graduation, there shall be only two conditions required for faculty recommendation for a degree: (1) that the candidate has met the academic requirements for a degree, attested to by the University Registrar for undergraduates or by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for law students; and (2) that there are no Washington and Lee conduct proceedings or criminal charges pending against a candidate, attested to by the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students for undergraduates and the appropriate student affairs dean for law students. If student misconduct occurs between the faculty meeting and graduation, the matter will be handled administratively through the Office of the Provost.\n\nThe Student Judicial Council (SJC), a wholly student group, shall have primary, first-instance responsibility for deciding most misconduct cases and imposing penalties with the exception of cases involving the Honor System (adjudicated by the Student Executive Committee), or student acts of prohibited discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and sexual misconduct, which will be heard by the Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Board (HSMB). The Interfraternity Council (IFC) is responsible for deciding cases of hazing and retaliation by fraternities under their jurisdiction. The President has independent conduct authority consistent with University policies. A student may appeal a finding and the sanction imposed by the Student Judicial Council or the Interfraternity Council to the University Board of Appeals consistent with University policy.\n\nViolations of the Honor System are adjudicated by the Executive Committee of the Student Body. A student found in violation of the Honor System is subject to a single sanction--dismissal from the University. A student may appeal the finding by the Executive Committee to an open Student Body Hearing.\n\nStudent Conduct System\n\nWashington and Lee University has developed four conduct bodies designed to address specific areas of student misconduct:\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Student Body (EC) manages the Honor System and hears cases of breaches of trust such as lying, cheating, and stealing.\n\nThe SJC hears allegations related to alcohol, drugs, hazing by individuals or by organizations not under the jurisdiction of the IFC, and a history or pattern of student or group misconduct.\n\nThe Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Board (HSMB) hears allegations of prohibited discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and sexual misconduct.\n\nIFC hears allegations of hazing, retaliation associated with hazing, and other violations of University policy by fraternities under its jurisdiction.\n\nStudent Judicial Council (SJC)\n\nThe SJC acts upon complaints of alleged student misconduct, except for dishonorable acts that involve the general categories of lying, cheating, stealing, or other breaches of trust (which are under the jurisdiction of the EC); or acts that involve discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or sexual misconduct (which are under the jurisdiction of the Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Board); or hazing, retaliation associated with hazing, or other violations of University policy by a fraternity under the jurisdiction of IFC. The University's jurisdiction extends to all conduct committed while a member of the Washington and Lee community, including but not limited to study abroad programs, pre-orientation, pre-season athletic practices, campus summer programs and camps, and summer research programs. Students who return to Lexington, Buena Vista, or Rockbridge County for the purpose of enrolling in classes, even if they do not reside in University housing, are under the jurisdiction of the SJC as well as the other University conduct systems. The SJC is designed to affirm the student's obligation to individual responsibility and to see that obligation fulfilled.\n\nThe SJC believes that honorable behavior is a University Community Standard (\"Standard\") that must be upheld. Students are bound to this Standard just as they are bound to the Honor System. Any person who believes a student has deviated from this Standard may bring a complaint to the SJC. Violations of the Standard are not limited to findings or convictions of criminal conduct, except those expressly tied to criminal convictions. Violations of the Standard include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nAny conduct disruptive to the life of the University, other universities and colleges or the surrounding community\n\nViolations of residence hall regulations or other University policies or regulations\n\nVandalism or destruction of property\n\nActions which endanger person or property\n\nViolations of the University Policy on Alcohol and Other Drugs for Individuals\n\nHazing by individuals or by organizations not under the jurisdiction of the IFC\n\nConduct unbecoming of a Washington and Lee student\n\nA history or pattern of student misconduct\n\nNote: Voluntary intoxication shall not excuse any misconduct. Intoxication means impairment by alcohol or other substances. Addiction shall not excuse possessing, possessing with intent to distribute, or distributing any drug.\n\nStudent Judicial Council Procedures\n\nComposition\n\nThe SJC shall be comprised of ten elected justices--one from each undergraduate class (four), one from each law class (three), one elected at-large from the School of Law, and the SJC Chair and SJC Secretary, both elected by the student body. Alternate justices will be appointed by the SJC Chair at the beginning of the academic year in consultation with the Administrative Advisor,[1] by first trying to draw from students who have served on judicial committees, and if no students are available from that pool, from students in the community who the chair believes can serve as an objective and fair justice. If the SJC cannot meet quorum for a case, which is seven members, the SJC Chair shall appoint student Alternates. Alternates may also be appointed by the chair in cases where the chair determines that a panel greater than seven (7) justices is desired.\n\nReports of Violation, Forms of Resolution\n\nA person wishing to report an alleged violation of the Standard against a student may submit relevant information to any SJC Justice or the Administrative Advisor who will then submit the information to the Chair of the SJC and the Advisor. The Chair and Administrative Advisor will determine initially whether the alleged misconduct falls within the jurisdiction of the SJC. If so, they (or designee) will request an additional investigation, if deemed necessary by the Chair, to determine whether sufficient evidence exists that the respondent may have violated the Standard. If there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, the matter will be closed with no further action. If there is sufficient evidence to believe the respondent violated the Standard, the respondent will be notified of a pending charge and investigation and how the complaint will be resolved -- whether administratively or through a SJC hearing. A respondent who proceeds to a SJC hearing will be notified of the right to have the assistance of a Hearing Advisor.\n\nAdministrative Resolution\n\nFor those cases where the respondent admits to the misconduct and/or there is a record or information provided to the Administrative Advisor that confirms the misconduct, the respondent may accept responsibility and accept a sanction that falls within the parameters set forth in these procedures. Administrative resolution is typically utilized for first time violations that are less egregious in nature. If a student rejects proceeding with an administrative resolution, the case will be referred to the SJC for a hearing.\n\nHearings\n\nIn cases that proceed to a SJC hearing, the SJC Chair and Administrative Advisor will gather relevant information and documentation for distribution to the SJC members hearing the case. The respondent will receive copies of documents that are provided to the SJC. The SJC Secretary shall notify the respondent of the charge(s) and hearing date in writing, which will be held no earlier than 72 hours from the notice, and refer respondent to the SJC policy and procedures that are set forth in the Student Handbook. The SJC Secretary shall also notify the respondent and complainant, if applicable, of the confidential nature of the proceeding and the obligation to observe confidentiality as set forth further below. If the respondent, after receiving proper notification of the hearing, fails to attend, the hearing may be conducted in the student's absence.\n\nThe SJC will conduct hearings according to the following guidelines:\n\nThe SJC Chair shall, as presiding officer, regulate and determine the order of the proceedings, the relevancy of witnesses and evidence, and the nature of questioning. The Chair shall exercise reasonable discretion in dealing with all matters not formally covered in these procedures and all procedural questions are subject to the final decision of the Chair.\n\nThe respondent and complainant, if applicable, may choose to be advised by a Hearing Advisor. The responsibilities of the Hearing Advisors are to advise the respondent and complainant on SJC procedures, to assist the respondent and complainant in developing an opening and closing statement, and to advise the respondent and complainant on the specifics of a written appeal, if necessary. Advisors are also available to provide information about resources that the parties may wish to contact to obtain support until resolution.\n\nWhen the respondent is one of two or more allegedly involved in a joint misconduct, the hearing may be held jointly or separately, as determined by the SJC. In the case of a joint hearing, the verdicts will be presented separately.\n\nThe SJC and parties have the right to request witnesses bearing relevant information to testify. Witnesses may not be present in the hearing other than to provide testimony and shall not discuss the case with other witnesses. It is the SJC's expectation that any students with relevant information cooperate with the SJC, including appearing to testify, if requested.\n\nRequests by parties to interview witnesses before a hearing should be directed to the Administrative Advisor who will arrange for the appropriate persons to meet.\n\nThe parties shall provide the Administrative Advisor a list of witnesses whom they intend to call to provide testimony prior to the hearing. The respondent and complainant, if there is one, may be present at the hearing while witnesses testify and to question them. The Advisors have the same rights as the respondent and complainant, if applicable, to be present at the hearing and to question witnesses. The respondent, Hearing Advisors and complainant may remain present throughout the hearing except during SJC deliberations.\n\nThe SJC hearing will begin with the Chair reading the charges to the respondent after which the respondent may make an opening statement, as may the complainant, if applicable.
