        "text": "What is a Stranding?\n\nA marine mammal that is on the shore and unable to return to the water under its own power.\n\nA marine mammal that is on the shore and, although able to return to the water, is in need of apparent medical attention.\n\nA marine mammal in the water that cannot return to its natural habitat without assistance.\n\nA dead marine mammal on the beach or in the water.\n\nHow to Report a Stranding\n\nFirst, determine if the animal is truly stranded. Many seals and sea lions haul out and rest on land and are not in distress. You can evaluate the animal’s behavior and monitor their condition for 24 hours. Let others who are nearby know to stay at least 100 yards away (about the length of a football field), keep pets 100 yards away, help minimize disturbances if possible, and be aware of hazards or rising tides and monitor from an area that is safe.\n\nReporting Hotlines\n\nTo report a dead, injured, or stranded marine mammal along the West Coast (i.e., off California, Oregon, and Washington):\n\nWest Coast Region Stranding Hotline: 1-866-767-6114\n\nRegional Stranding Response Contacts\n\nTo report entangled marine mammals:\n\nEntanglement Reporting Hotline: 1-877-SOS-WHAL or 1-877-767-9425\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard: VHF Ch. 16\n\nTo report harassments and other violations to law enforcement:\n\nNOAA Enforcement Hotline: 1-800-853-1964\n\nTo report derelict gear:\n\nDerelict Gear Hotline: 1-855-542-3935\n\nWhat Information To Report?\n\nSpecies or description of the animal\n\nLocation (region/landmarks and/or specific location like GPS coordinates)\n\nDate and time the animal was last seen\n\nApproximate size of the animal (length and weight), take a photo with a phone if possible\n\nCondition of the animal (alive, dead, wounded, entangled, bleeding, etc.)\n\nHuman interactions (evidence of ship strike, entangled, shooting, etc.)\n\nTags or branding on the animal (if applicable)\n\nName and contact number for the person reporting the incident\n\nShould I Report?\n\nThere is a live cetacean on the beach or entangled cetacean in the water… YES!\n\nThere is a live pinniped on the beach for more than 24 hours… YES!\n\nThere is an obviously sick or injured animal that has been hauled out less than 24 hours… YES!\n\nThere are ANY dead marine mammals… YES!\n\nHealth Guidelines\n\nZoonotic diseases are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. There are known zoonotic diseases that have been transmitted to people from the marine mammals they have worked with, so please remember the following:\n\nPlease stay at least 100 yards away!\n\nKeep dogs at least 100 yards away at all times!\n\nDo not disturb, move, touch, or feed a marine mammal!\n\nAll marine mammals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and it is illegal for unauthorized persons to harass, handle, or feed them.

Members of the network respond to marine mammal stranding events along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts and are part of a nationwide network.\n\nEvery year there are hundreds of reports of stranded marine mammals throughout Washington, Oregon, and California. Each case can hold important information about the species, which can contribute to scientific research or public education. Information collected from stranded animals can be used to:\n\nEstablish baseline information on marine mammal populations and their health.\n\nIncrease biological information for research.\n\nDevelop safety information and increase awareness.\n\nProvide public education about marine mammals to reduce the chances of negative human and wildlife interactions.\n\nIn most stranding cases, the cause of the stranding is unknown, but some identified causes have included disease, parasite infestation, harmful algal blooms, injuries from ship strikes or fishery entanglements, pollution exposure, trauma, and starvation. While most stranded animals are found dead, some strand alive. In a limited number of cases it is possible to transport them to rehabilitation centers for care. In rare cases, successfully rehabilitated animals are returned to the wild.\n\nThe West Coast Region coordinates stranding network activities from the NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Region offices based in Seattle, WA, and Long Beach, CA.\n\nOur Stranding Network is composed of cooperating scientific investigators and institutions, volunteer networks, and individuals in all three states. Other organizations that are also involved are wildlife and fisheries agencies and state and federal law enforcement. Although response areas are defined geographically, the stranding network members coordinate extensively within the region and on occasion with our Canadian counterparts. Each stranding event is handled on a case-by-case basis and is dependent on local capability, available resources, personnel, and logistics.\n\nNetwork Maps\n\nThe West Coast Region's Stranding Network coverage area is the nearshore waters and shoreline of Washington, Oregon, and California. North of 32º 30'N (the U.S./Mexico border) and South of 49º0'N (the U.S./Canadian border), including the inland waters of Washington State. There are 3,767 km (2,337 nautical miles) of marine shoreline in Washington, 476 km (295 nautical miles) in Oregon, and 1674 km (904 nautical miles) in California.\n\nWashington Jurisdictions (PDF, 1 page)\n\nPuget Sound Jurisdictions (PDF, 1 page)\n\nOregon Jurisdictions (PDF, 1 page)\n\nCalifornia Jurisdictions (PDF, 1 page)\n\nContacts\n\nStranding Response Hotlines in CA, OR, and WA\n\nWest Coast Stranding Events & Summaries\n\nWest Coast Stranding Network 10-Year Data Summary and Q&As (2007-2016) (PDF, 11 pages)\n\nStranding Network Q & A (PDF, 2 pages)\n\nWest Coast Stranding Network Partners\n\nThe network is composed of cooperating scientific investigators and institutions, volunteer networks, and individuals authorized by NOAA Fisheries to respond to strandings. Other organizations also involved are wildlife and fisheries agencies and state and federal law enforcement. Participants are trained in systematic data collection and are experienced in handling a variety of marine mammal stranding related tasks. Data are collected for inclusion in a national database to establish baseline information on marine mammal communities and monitor their health.\n\nSince the inception of the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program in 2001, millions of dollars have been granted nationwide to support our efforts. There is an annual competitive program as well as funding made available throughout the year for emergency response. In the West Coast Region, we have supported over 34 of our Stranding Agreement Partners in Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\nCalifornia Partners\n\nNorthcoast Marine Mammal Center (NMMC)\n\nCalifornia Polytechnic University - Humboldt State University (CPUH)\n\nThe Marine Mammal Center (TMMC)\n\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences, Department of Ornithology and Mammalogy (CAS)\n\nLong Marine Laboratory, University of California, Santa Cruz (LML)\n\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratories, San José State University (MLML)\n\nChannel Islands Cetacean Research Unit (CICRU)\n\nChannel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute (CIMWI)\n\nCalifornia Wildlife Center (CWC)\n\nMarine Animal Rescue (MAR)\n\nNatural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHMLA)\n\nOcean Animal Response and Research Alliance (OARRA)\n\nMarine Mammal Care Center of Los Angeles (MMCCLA)\n\nPacific Marine Mammal Center (PMMC)\n\nSeaWorld of California (SWC)\n\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\n\nUniversity of California, Davis - Oiled Wildlife Care Network (OWCN)\n\nWashington and Oregon Partners\n\nCascadia Research Collective\n\nCentral Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network\n\nDungeness National Wildlife Refuge\n\nHighline Community College, Marine Science & Technology Center\n\nJuan de Fuca Marine Mammal Stranding Network\n\nMakah Tribe\n\nOlympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary\n\nOlympic National Park\n\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\nOregon State University Marine Mammal Institute\n\nPortland State University / Seaside Aquarium\n\nPort Townsend Marine Science Center\n\nSan Juan Islands Marine Mammal Stranding Network\n\nSR3 SeaLife Response, Rehab, and Research\n\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Mammal Investigations\n\nWest Seattle Seal Sitters\n\nWhatcom County Marine Mammal Stranding Network\n\nWorld Vets\n\nMore Information"
