        "text": "The Nordic Countries include Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark, with its associated territories: the Faroe Islands, and Greenland. Scandinavia is a modern term, most often used in English to include Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, though it is not truly accurate. The word Scandinavia refers to only those nations on the Scandinavian Peninsula: Norway and Sweden. Fenoscandian is the word that refers to the three countries: Norway, Sweden and Finland. To include Denmark, the country located on the Jutland peninsula north of Germany, the word Nordic has to be used! Denmark is south of the Scandinavian Peninsula, separated by the Danish Straits. The Scandinavian Peninsula extends north of the Arctic Circle, with lakes, tundra, moraines, and fjords that are remnants of the Ice Age. The majority of inhabitants on this peninsula are referred to as Scandinavians, belonging to the Germanic peoples. A minority of people living on the Scandinavian Peninsula and in Fenoscandia are Sami peoples who live in an undefined area in the far north of Norway, Sweden, and parts of Finland, an area known as SÃ¡mpi, formerly known as Lapland. Scandinavian languages of Danish, Forese, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish are classified as North Germanic languages. Sami and Finnish languages fall under a different linguistic category belonging to the Uralic language group. With all these differences in terrain and language, and despite the wars fought through many centuries between and amongst these Nordic nations, both the nations and its people remain culturally and politically close to one another. Though Henry and I have not yet visited all the Nordic countries, we did visit four of them: Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, three of which are classified as kingdoms.. Between 1873 until 1914, a Scandinavian Monetary Union existed amongst Sweden, Norway and Denmark with fixed exchange rates of each of their own currency, pegged to the gold standard.Â Today, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are members of the European Union; however, of all the Nordic countries, only Finland uses the Euro as its currency. Norway opted out of the European Union by referendum.\n\nGovernment: Parliamentary democracy & Constitutional Monarchy with a King, Prime Minister & President\n\nCurrency:Â Norwegian Krone (NOK)\n\nNorway rejected EU membership in a referendum in â92.\n\nGovernment: Unitary Parliamentary Democracy & Constitutional Monarch with Monarch, Prime Minister, and Speaker of the Riksdag Currency: Currency: Swedish krona (SEK)\n\nEU member since â95\n\nGovernment: Parliamentary Republic with a President and Prime Minister\n\nCurrency: Euro\n\nEU member since â95\n\nGovernment Parliamentary democracy & Constitutional Monarchy\n\nCurrency:Â Danish Krone (DKK)\n\nEU Member â73\n\nTerritory: Greenland Autonomous State under Denmark\n\nGovernment: Parliamentary democracy & Constitutional Monarchy\n\nCurrency: Danish Krone (DKK)\n\nTerritory: Faroe Island - Territory of Denmark\n\nGovernment: Parliamentary democracy with a Constitutional Monarchy\n\nCurrency: Faroese Krona tied to the Danish Krone (DKK)\n\nCountry: Iceland / Capital: Reykjavik\n\nGovernment:Â Unitary Parliamentary Government\n\nCurrency: Icelandic KronÃ¡ (ISK)"
