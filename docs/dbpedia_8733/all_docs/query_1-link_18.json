        "text": "Maybe Norway but only because Ive got a friend there. Have only visited briefly but enjoyed it. I have been to Finland and didnt like it as much. Not visited the others.\n\nOo that‚Äôs interesting I would put Finland last! It might be considered the happiest but it also has the highest suicide rates out of Nordic countries\n\n‚ÄúWhat country has the least amount of mosquitoes?\n\nIn almost every country in the world, mosquitoes are a menace. Everywhere but Iceland, that is. Iceland is one of the few habitable places on the planet that is mosquito-free, and nobody really seems to know why‚Äù\n\nthere you have it ü§£ü§£\n\nIceland. I love it there and I'm a sun/heat loather, so it would suit me to a T.\n\nNorway is fabulous, the only drawback is that it's the most expensive of them all, but then wages would be very good too.\n\nI‚Äôm in Denmark at the moment on holiday. It‚Äôs lovely but I wouldn‚Äôt want to live here. Norway is lovely but too cold in winter. I‚Äôll stick to home.\n\n@Wildwildwildwest Iceland might not have mozzies, but it does have midges that could swallow you whole. Ask me how I know üòñ\n\n@PTSDBarbiegirl mmmm Sweden is quite right wing but I wouldn‚Äôt consider Denmark to be so. I‚Äôm from one of the Nordic countries btw and recently moved there. After living for 8 years in uk!\n\nFinland, because my Finnish colleagues have a sauna in the office and because it is (or was, not sure how current) the world‚Äôs biggest consumer per capita of ice cream. The office also had a free ice freezer.\n\nFjords, meatballs and small mermaids? Nice, but no contest for the ice cream.\n\nNorway. My mum has friends there so I spent a few childhood summers there, and she‚Äôs taken my kids in their early teens. The landscape is beautiful and lifestyle is very wholesome. It‚Äôs the best side of me.\n\nIve been to Denmark, Sweden and Lapland too - loved taking my kids to see Santa in Lapland but didn‚Äôt really experience much local culture, Sweden I think I liked the least, Denmark was nice. But Norway‚Ä¶. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
