        "text": "At the assessment it may be given particular consideration whether you have established a long-term residence here in Denmark, whether your property and your closest relatives (for instance spouse and children) are in Denmark and whether you are staying in Denmark (not taking into account brief trips outside of Denmark in connection with for instance business, study or holidays).\n\nThe same applies if you merely have occupational ties to Denmark and you have your personal ties in another country, which you regularly return to.\n\nIf you have a foreign driving licence and are staying temporarily in Denmark\n\nIf you do not have normal residence in Denmark, you may use your foreign driving licence in Denmark in the following cases:\n\nThe driving licence is issued by an EU or EEA country (Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein).\n\nThe driving licence is from the Faroe Islands.\n\nThe driving licence is from Greenland.\n\nIt is a temporary driving licence issued in Finland, Iceland, Norway or Sweden.\n\nIt is a foreign driving licence (not issued in an EU or EEA country), issued in the Latin alphabet or accompanied by a translation in Danish, English or French. The translation must be produced by a public authority or by an organisation which has been authorised to produce it by the issuing country.\n\nIt is an international driving licence.\n\nIn Denmark, you are allowed to drive the same types of vehicles as you are according to your valid driving licence from the issuing country.\n\nIf you need a Visitor’s Driving Licence during your temporary stay in Denmark\n\nIf you do not have normal residence in Denmark and you do not possess the required driving licence, you can apply for a Visitor’s Driving Licence.\n\nIn order to apply for a Visitor’s Driving Licence, you must contact Færdselsstyrelsen and send documentation from your home country relating to your driving licence.\n\nIf you have a foreign driving licence and have normal residence in Denmark\n\nIf you have normal residence in Denmark, you must in some cases exchange your foreign driving licence for a Danish driving licence.\n\nWhether you must exchange your foreign driving licence and whether you must complete a driving test (consisting of a theoretical and a practical part) prior to the exchange, depends on the country/constituent state which has issued your driving licence. Moreover, different rules apply as to how long you can wait until you must exchange your foreign driving licence for a Danish driving licence.\n\nDriving licences issued in the Faroe Islands, in an EU country or an EEA country (Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein)\n\nAn exchange is not required and you are allowed to drive the same types of vehicles in Denmark as you are according to your valid driving licence from the issuing country.\n\nHowever, it is a condition that you must fulfill the age requirements which apply when issuing an equivalent Danish driving licence (certain exceptions apply to driving licences from EU and EEA countries).\n\nIf you desire, you may apply for an exchange even if it is not required.\n\nIn principle, you are not required to complete a driving test in connection with the exchange.\n\nDriving licenses issued in a former EU or EEA country\n\nYou are entitled to drive with a valid driving license issued in a former EU or EEA country, but at the time of issue was a member of EU or EEA for a maximum of 180 days after the date on which the country no longer is a member of EU or EEA, or 180 days after having established normal residence in Denmark.\n\nNo later than 180 days after having established normal residence, you must exchange your license for a Danish driving license, if you still wish to drive in Denmark.\n\nAn exchange of driving license does not require, that you pass a driving test.\n\nDriving licences issued in Greenland\n\nYou are entitled to drive with your valid Greenlandic driving licence for a maximum of 180 days after having established normal residence in Denmark.\n\nHowever, it is a condition that you must fulfill the age requirements which apply when issuing an equivalent Danish driving licence.\n\nNo later than 180 days after having established normal residence, you must exchange your Greenlandic driving licence for a Danish driving licence if you still wish to drive in Denmark.\n\nIn this connection, you are required to complete a driving test.\n\nDriving licences issued in other countries or driving licenses issued on the basis of such driving licenses\n\nHow long you are allowed to drive with a foreign driving license and whether you need to take a driving test to verify your skills when exchanging your foreign driving license for a Danish one depends on which country/territory etc. has issued your driving license. There is a distinction between different groups of countries: Group 1, Group 2, and other countries.\n\nGroup 1 countries\n\nIf your driving license was issued in the Australian Capital Territory, Brazil, Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), Japan, Jersey, Gibraltar, Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales), Guernsey, Northern Ireland, Russia, Ukraine, The Republic of Korea (South Korea) or Switzerland, you are allowed to drive with your foreign driving license for 180 days from the day you establish normal residence in Denmark.\n\nThis only applies if your foreign driving license is valid. In addition, your driving license must be issued with Latin characters or accompanied by an official translation into Danish, English or French.\n\nIn addition, you must meet the age requirements that apply for being issued a corresponding Danish driving license.\n\nWhen 180 days have passed since you established residence in Denmark, you must exchange your foreign driving license for a Danish driving license if you wish to continue to drive in Denmark."
