        "text": "Although around 86% of Denmark’s population are ethnic Danes, the country has a liberal, tolerant and egalitarian stance which welcomes all races, ethnicities and orientations.\n\nThe idea of ‘the greater good’ is held sacred – everyone does their bit, and the benefits are reaped in the nation’s rich quality of life. Danes are a quiet, reserved people who also know how to let loose.\n\nThe Danish language\n\nThe Danish language has more than 5 million speakers worldwide and belongs to the East Scandinavian branch of North Germanic languages. Danish is the language you will hear the most in Denmark. However, English is also very prominent - 86% of Danes speak English as a second language.\n\nLearning Danish\n\nAlthough most Danes speak excellent English, this should not be assumed. Apart from helping you to get by, learning the language will help you understand the nuances of the culture. Additionally, delving into Danish literature, art and film will grant you a larger perspective on cross-cultural matters.\n\nAs soon as you master your pronunciation of Æ, Ø, Å, you’ll be well on your way to learning the language!\n\nOpportunities to learn Danish\n\nThere are plenty of private and public institutions in Denmark that offer lessons at various levels.\n\nA popular option is the government-run scheme where foreigners with an official Danish address (folkeregisteradresse) are offered free, publicly-funded Danish lessons at recognized schools."
