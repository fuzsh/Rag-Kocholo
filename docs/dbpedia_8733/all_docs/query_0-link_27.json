        "text": "The Nordic countries make up the northernmost part of western Europe, extending into the Arctic. They include Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Åland and in most definitions Greenland, as there are long-standing political, cultural and linguistic ties.\n\nThese neighbours share a common heritage dating back at least to the Viking Age, with several unions in the past and close cooperation today. At almost 1.2 million km² (463,000 square miles), the Nordic countries form one of the largest regions in Europe, but are home to only around 24 million people, accounting for a mere 4% of its population. The Nordic countries contain some of Europe's greatest natural wonders, and boast an excellent standard of living. Despite the common heritage and political affiliation, this wide area covers a great variety in nature and settlements: From the dense population and intense agriculture of Denmark, to the rugged coast of Norway and the glacial deserts of the arctic, from the volcanoes of Iceland to the wide forests and lakes of Sweden and Finland.\n\nCountries\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark\n\nThe smallest mainland Nordic country features hundreds of islands, rolling farmland, endless beaches and a more continental vibe.\n\nFinland\n\nA hundred thousand islands and lakes to explore in this bridge to the east. The most sparsely populated EU country and the only Nordic country to use the euro; the Finnish language is unrelated to the main languages in the rest of the Nordics.\n\nIceland\n\nSpectacular scenery of volcanoes, glaciers, geysers, and waterfalls on this North Atlantic island.\n\nNorway (including Svalbard)\n\nFamous for deep fjords, an endless coastline, steep mountains, glaciers, countless waterfalls, wooden churches and millennial maritime traditions. Norway's topography and nature have distinctive regional diversity.\n\nSweden\n\nThe largest Nordic country by area and population is home to endless forests, clear blue lakes and the beautiful archipelagos along its coasts.\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nAn autonomous territory of Denmark in the Atlantic Ocean with a very distinct culture and sense of national identity. Especially known for its dramatic natural scenery and unique bird life.\n\nÅland\n\nAn archipelago and autonomous territory of Finland in the Baltic Sea, where the Swedish-speaking population has its own distinctive culture and sense of quasi-national identity.\n\nGreenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark; geographically part of North America. The indigenous people, the Inuit, are also culturally and linguistically close to native America, but there is a strong modern Nordic influence.\n\nWhile the Baltic states have much common history with the Nordic countries, and Estonians in particular claim their country to be Nordic, they are not members of the Nordic Council and they are covered by a separate region on Wikivoyage.\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\n— a brilliant Open Air Museum containing historic buildings from towns and cities across Denmark, many from the 1800s\n\n— old Hanseatic trading centre with wonderfully cute wooden buildings, a magnificent mountain setting, varied nightlife and tons of atmosphere\n\n— a vast number of offers for cultural experiences, shopping and the inspiration of Danish design traditions, a gastronomical centre of the region with \"New Nordic Cuisine\", has picturesque canals.\n\n— a port and industrial city on the Swedish west coast, second in size in Sweden\n\n— the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Finland's capital and largest city with its iconic cathedral\n\n— museums of national importance, a beautiful setting, lively nightlife and cultural scene\n\n— the northernmost national capital in the world\n\n— spread out over a number of islands, one of the most beautiful cities of Scandinavia\n\n— the gateway to the Archipelago Sea; the huge Castle and Cathedral are the two poles of historic Turku, between which just about every important site in the city can be found\n\nOther destinations\n\n[edit]\n\n— the largest island in the Baltic Sea, with the UNESCO heritage main town of Visby and great partying in the summer\n\n— the largest glacier on the European mainland\n\n— one of Europe's largest wilderness areas, in northernmost Sweden\n\n— a lake region near Akureyri in the north of Iceland\n\n— this cliff is the northernmost point of continental Europe\n\n— a pint-sized marvel just 35 km from Helsinki\n\n— a winter sports centre in Finnish Lapland, neighbouring the vast Urho Kekkonen National Park\n\n— 55 islands and islets, one of Denmark's most scenic areas\n\n— not only is this the original site of the longest running parliament in the world, it's also where the North American and European continental shelf plates are being torn apart\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic countries\n\nDenmark (Faroe Islands, Greenland), Finland (Åland), Iceland, Norway, Sami culture, Sweden\n\nBoating • Cuisine • Folk culture • Hiking • Music • Nordic Noir • Right to access • Sauna • Winter\n\nNordic history: • Vikings & Old Norse • Danish Empire • Swedish Empire • Monarchies\n\nScandinavia is a geographic term including only Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The term Nordic countries also includes Finland and Iceland, although the terms often are used interchangeably by visitors. Greenland is geographically a part of North America, but is politically linked to the rest of the Nordic countries by being both an integral part of the Danish Kingdom and a member of the Nordic Council, a cooperative organization.\n\nNorway and Sweden make up the Scandinavian Peninsula, as Denmark is separated from the two by the entry to the Baltic Sea. \"Fennoscandia\" is a rarely used technical term for the Scandinavian mainland plus Finland, while the Jutland peninsula (the mainland portion of Denmark, but not its main centre of population) also includes part of German Schleswig Holstein. As a political and cultural term, \"Nordic countries\" includes islands in the Atlantic such as Iceland, the Faroes and in most definitions Greenland, as there are long-standing political and linguistic ties. Estonia considers itself at least partially Nordic but is not always seen as such by others.\n\nThe Nordic countries share many cultural traits, including similar flags, and most of their languages are related. They have a shared history and are economically interconnected. The Nordic passport union was formed in the 1950s, and there was a common labour market long before the European Union. There is considerable shopping, tourism and migration across the borders – one reason for the non-EU Iceland and Norway to join the Schengen agreement was not to spoil this. Denmark, Finland and Sweden are EU members; Norway and Iceland have rejected EU membership but belong to the EFTA (which has free trade with the EU) and the Schengen area. Greenland left the European Union in 1985 mostly over disputes concerning fisheries.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Nordic countries became high-income countries. Norway and Iceland in particular have profited from an abundance of natural resources. Sweden and Finland also have their share, but in the international marketplace they are mostly famous for strong brands like Ikea, Volvo, Saab, Ericsson and Nokia. Although Denmark has developed sophisticated businesses in a number of industries, it is above all the leading agricultural country in the North, especially famous for pork products. High minimum wages and taxes translate into high prices for visitors.\n\nElaborate welfare states supported by high tax rates are a common characteristic of the Nordic countries. Most things are highly organized, and visitors can expect everything to proceed according to plans, rules and timetables. The Nordic countries are among the least corrupt in the world, enjoy a relatively low crime rate, and consistently rank among the most livable countries in the world. In addition, the Nordic countries are the world's most highly-rated in terms of gender equality, with the world's highest proportions of women in senior leadership positions, as well as generous paternity and maternity leave and a strong culture of equal responsibility in child rearing. In part due to this strong tradition of gender equality, Nordic national teams often punch above their weight in female sports competitions, especially soccer and handball. Although the neoliberalist wave has also affected the politics here, the support for the welfare state among people is strong.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vikings and the Old Norse, Nordic history, Danish Empire, Swedish Empire\n\nScandinavia and Finland were covered by an ice sheet around 10,000 BC. As the ice pushed the land down, it is still rising from the sea, at a rate near 1 cm a year. As the ice melted, the north Germanic peoples populated southern coastal areas and Finns and Sami migrated from the Ural Mountains. Thus, the Nordic countries were among the last parts of Eurasia to be settled by humans.\n\nThe 8th to the 11th centuries are known as the Viking Age. \"Viking\" is not the name of a tribe or nation, but the Old Norse word for \"sailor\". Most Norse people were farmers who remained in Scandinavia, and were by definition not Vikings, but some Norsemen (and in some cases women) sailed the Atlantic and European rivers, venturing as far as Canada and Central Asia, sometimes settling at the destination, and taking part in the foundation of nations such as England, France, and Russia. The expeditions ranged from peaceful trade to pirate raids, the latter giving the Norse a bad reputation across Europe.\n\nIceland was settled during the Viking Age primarily by migrants from Western Norway. The first decades of colonization is known as the \"land grab years\" (iclandic: Landnámsöld). While a notable number of women or slaves originated from Scotland and Ireland, cultural and political ties were mostly to Scandinavia and the Old Norse language remained so linguistically stable in Iceland, that some renditions of the Old Norse Sagas render them with modern Icelandic pronunciation which is close enough to the real thing. Iceland's ancient sagas includes important parts of Norway's medieval history and literature.\n\nAs the Norse nations were unified and Christianized around AD 1000, the Viking raids declined. Finland was Christianized and annexed by Sweden in the 13th century. The Nordic countries were joint in the Kalmar Union throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, but since Sweden broke away in the 16th century, they fought eleven wars against Denmark, during the following 300 years, until the idea of Scandinavian unity was revived in the 19th century. During the years under Denmark, Norway was heavily influenced by Danish politics and language, and written Danish also became the language of Norway. After independence from Denmark in 1814, leading men in Norway swiftly compiled a democratic constitution that is still in effect as one of the oldest in the world. Norway had a high degree of autonomy during the union with Sweden (1814-1905) and broke away peacefully.\n\nNorway, Finland and Iceland gained or regained independence during the early 20th century. Since the end of World War II, the five Nordic countries have prospered to democratic welfare states. Though they have taken different paths in the international community, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the European Union, and Finland being the only Nordic country to adopt the euro, the brotherhood between the Nordic nations is only tainted by friendly rivalry.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark borders on Germany, while Finland and northern Norway border on Russia, but otherwise the Nordic countries are separated from their neighbours by the Baltic, the North Sea or the Atlantic itself. Denmark is usually regarded as part of continental Europe, while the rest of the Nordic countries are not. Denmark is part of the North European Plain - the largely mountain-free lowland that also includes Belgium, the Netherlands, northern Germany and large parts of Poland.\n\nAn abundance of land, water and wilderness is a common characteristic of the Nordic countries. While Denmark is mostly farmland or settlements with little wilderness, the land is still dominated by the sea and the most populous areas are on islands; you are always less than an hour from the sea. Also in Iceland and Norway most people live near the sea. The Nordic countries are often counted among the smaller countries of Europe, but this is largely due to their small populations, and they cover a surprisingly large chunk of land. Outside Russia, Sweden is the fourth largest country in Europe and Norway is the fifth largest. Norway's largest municipality by area (Kautokeino) is almost four times the size of Luxembourg but has only 3,000 inhabitants, and the largest county by area (Troms og Finnmark) is larger than the Republic of Ireland. Sweden is ten times larger than Denmark.\n\nThe Nordic countries have a large extent north-south. There is for instance an equal distance from the southernmost point in Denmark to either the Nordkapp at the northernmost point of mainland Norway or to Syracuse in southern Sicily. Even without Greenland, the Nordic countries are larger than the United Kingdom, France and Germany combined. Most areas of the Nordic countries are sparsely populated and the northern sections are the least populated in the EU. A drive through the county Troms og Finnmark is about 1,000 km, which is longer than London to Inverness. Only around and south of the Bergen-Oslo-Stockholm-Helsinki-line there is population comparable to continental Europe.\n\nNorway and Sweden has a 1600 km border (one of the longest in Europe) with about 70 crossing points by road. Norway and Finland has some 730 km joint border with 6 crossing points by road.\n\nThe part of Norway, Sweden and Finland north of the arctic circle is often referred to as Nordkalotten (\"Cap of the North\"), which largely corresponds to Sápmi, the traditional home of the Sami people. At more than 300,000 km² it is about the size of Germany and constitutes about one third of the Nordic countries, but less than a million people live in this northernmost region.\n\nThe landscapes and nature varies much across the Nordic countries. Denmark is a flat lowland like the Netherlands and Northern Germany. Iceland is both volcanic and Arctic. Norway and Sweden share the Scandinavian peninsula, which is highest on the Atlantic coast and gradually becomes lower until Sweden meets the Baltic sea. The Scandinavian mountains are steep and rugged on the Atlantic side with deep fjords cutting into the bedrock, gentle on the Eastern side. They run through most of Norway's length and parts of Sweden's and constitute Europe's longest mountain range. Finland is relatively flat, and characterized by lakes scattered over the entire country. Deep pine tree forests stretch from eastern Norway across much of Sweden and Finland, and form the western end of the great Russian taiga. Galdhøpiggen, in Norway's Jotunheimen national park, is at 2,469 m (8,100 ft) the tallest European mountain north of the Alps, while Kebnekaise is Sweden's tallest mountain at 2,104 m (6,903 ft).\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Winter in the Nordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries cover a wide range of climate and prevailing weather depends on latitude as well as altitude, distance from oceans and landscape. In Norway in particular, weather can differ considerably within a short distance due to the mountains and valleys. In winter distance from ocean is the most important factor. Weather also varies considerably from week to week, as the weather systems of the Westerlies and those of the Arctic chase high and low pressures. Finland in particular can have easterly winds bring hot weather in summer or cold in winter, or westerly winds bring mild and moist weather.\n\nThe Nordic countries have a temperate to Arctic climate, while much milder than other locations at the same latitude. While a large section of the Nordic countries lies north of the arctic circle (Norwegian: polarsirkelen), locals basically use the term \"arctic\" for areas with a real arctic climate such as Svalbard and the North Pole. The Scandinavian Mountains and wide areas in the very north of Fennoskandia is alpine tundra with an alpine-arctic climate. Most locals don't use the term \"tundra\" and instead refer to this cool, treeless areas as snaufjell, vidde, duottar, tunturi or fjäll (English: fell). There are areas with permafrost in the high mountains of South Norway and some areas at lower altitudes in Northern Sweden/Norway. Vardø in eastern Finnmark is one of the few towns with an Arctic climate.\n\nDenmark and coastal areas of Southern Norway, Iceland and Western Sweden experience only occasional frost and snow during winter. Summers in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland are pleasantly warm, with day temperatures in the range 15–30 °C (60–90 °F). In the mountains and along western coasts, the weather is generally more unstable. Finland has the most stable sunny weather in summer. In general, the further inland, the larger the difference between summer and winter. While western Norway and the Atlantic Islands only see temperature differ moderately between summer and winter, in Finland the temperature occasionally drops below −20°C (−5°F) even in the south, with records below −50°C (−55°F) in the north – Norway's and Sweden's northern interior has equally cold winters.\n\nThe Norwegian coast gets the most precipitation in all of Europe. While autumn tends to be the wet season, weather can change fast around the year. In coastal areas spring and early summer are usually the driest seasons.\n\nThe further north, the greater is the variation of daylight between summer and winter. North of the Arctic circle, the Midnight Sun can be seen in part of the summer, and Arctic night experienced part of the winter. In midwinter, the hours with daylight – or in the far north: even dusk – are few and precious; try to be outdoors before first sign of dawn. Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki (around 60 degrees north) enjoy white nights in June, but only six hours of daylight in December.\n\nElectricity\n\n[edit]\n\nElectricity is available nearly everywhere. All countries use 230 V 50 Hz. Denmark uses the E and K power plug; the other countries use F. Cabins away from settlements and public roads may or may not have electricity, sometimes solar powered 12 V DC or USB.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Germanic languages are spoken in all the Nordic countries. People who have regular Nordic contacts usually know how to adjust their Danish, Norwegian or Swedish into Skandinavisk (\"Scandinavian\") so that it is more easily understood by the others. However, mutual intelligibility is limited between those who have had less contact across the borders (and thus less trained ears), and Finnish, Greenlandic and Sámi are not related to the German languages at all – although the proximity and common history has resulted in lots of loanwords, and similar meanings of words even when the words themselves differ.\n\nDanish, Norwegian and Swedish are closely related and more or less mutually intelligible in their standard forms, especially in writing. From the middle ages until the late 19th century (when writing standards for Norwegian were created), Danish was the written language of Norway. As these are Germanic languages, there are many cognates in German and Dutch, and even English speakers will be able to recognise the odd word once they get their heads around the phonetic spelling: e.g. English school is Swedish skola and Danish/Norwegian skole, while first becomes först/først. Everyday words such as \"open\", \"room\", \"bus\" and \"taxi\" are virtually identical to English. Many grocery items also, for instance \"bread\" is \"brød/bröd\", \"milk\" is \"melk/mjölk\".\n\nNorwegian and Swedish are often recognized by the use of pitch accent giving these languages a \"singing\" quality like Latvian and some South Slavic languages, but unlike most other European languages. While Swedish and Norwegian may seem very similar, there are notable differences in vocabulary and several false friends that can cause confusion and fun. For instance Swedes say \"glass\" when they want ice cream, Norwegians say \"iskrem\" or simply \"is\" – which means just ice in Swedish. When Swedes say \"rolig\" they mean funny or amusing, whereas Norwegian \"rolig\" means calm or easy. Norwegians in Sweden (or Swedes in Norway) often pick up some local words to make themselves understood and create a mix known as \"Svorsk\" (\"Sworegian\").\n\nWhile a few archaic dialects are only understood by locals, virtually everyone speaks their country's standard national language, though in Norway people use their dialects in most contexts. Still, Bokmål as spoken by people in Oslo's west end is the unofficial standard spoken Norwegian; presenters on national TV and radio will use something close to this standard East Norwegian or a likewise standardized West Norwegian (both writing standards of Norwegian, Nynorsk and Bokmål, are approximations of different \"average dialects\" rather than the native tongue of any individual Norwegian).\n\nWhile Icelandic and Faroese are also North Germanic languages, they have been in a linguistic freezer since the 13th century, and are largely unintelligible to other Germanic speakers. They developed from Old Norwegian (also known as Old West Norse), as the islands were largely colonized by Norwegians. Norn, the Norse variant spoken in Shetland and Orkney until about 1500, is closely related to Faroese. Many cognates will still be recognisable particularly to visitors from West Norway. Icelanders and Faroese learn Danish at school, and can in theory talk with their Scandinavian kinsmen in a Nordic tongue, though in practice, Danish proficiency tends to be poor among Icelanders who don't have regular contact with Scandinavia.\n\nThe real outliers are Finnish and the Sámi languages, which belong to the Finno-Ugric family, and Greenlandic, which is Eskimo–Aleut. These are not Germanic or even Indo-European languages at all, making them considerably harder for speakers of most other European languages to learn. On the other hand, Finland has a roughly 5% Swedish-speaking minority, and Finnish and Swedish have equal legal standing. Finnish speakers study Swedish at school and about 45% are conversant in Swedish by adulthood. Still, most Finns have better mastery of English than Swedish, while urban Swedish speakers usually are fluent in all three. Finnish is quite closely related to Estonian and to some minority languages in Russia (notably Karelian) while Hungarian is distant enough not to help in intelligibility. The Sámi languages also belong to the Finno-Ugric family and Sámi is an official language in some municipalities of Lapland and Finnmark and also a recognized minority language in Sweden. The Sámi are generally bilingual with the main language of their countries. The people of Åland speak Swedish (with widely varying proficiency in Finnish). In Greenland many are bilingual with Danish.\n\nThe Nordic alphabets contain some special letters: å, ä/æ and ö/ø (the latter versions in Danish and Norwegian). In contrast to diacritic letters in many other languages, these are letters in their own right, ordered at the end of the alphabet; see the phrasebooks for details. Icelandic also contains the letter \"þ\", Icelandic and Faroese the letter \"ð\" – which used to exist in English and are now mostly represented by \"th\" in words that used to contain them – and both those languages use vowels with accents, which change the pronunciation of the letter. The Sámi languages also have letters of their own.\n\nThe Nordic countries have some of the highest levels of English proficiency among countries where English is not an official or first language. Public information (such as in public transport or government offices) is often printed in English in addition to the relevant official languages. Tourist information is often printed in other languages as well, typically German or French.\n\nVirtually everybody born since 1945 speaks at least basic English, and younger people tend to be fluent. Most students also study a third major European language, such as German, French and increasingly Spanish. Foreign language television programmes, as well as segments of local programmes with foreign language (e.g. interviews with foreigners), are usually shown in their original language with subtitles, with only children's programmes sometimes being dubbed into the local language, and even then DVDs and cinemas also offer the original language with subtitles.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the Nordic countries are part of the Schengen Area (exceptions include Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Svalbard), so residents of and visitors to EU can usually get here with little bureaucracy. Access to Svalbard by air is usually only possible from mainland Norway. Note that Iceland, Norway and the non-Schengen territories are not part of EU, so there is still a customs border here, too. There are also special requirements for those travelling with pets (some diseases common in central Europe are absent in the Nordic countries). Border crossing usually proceeds with no or minimal delay.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the large distances and the surrounding waters, air travel is often the most practical way to get into the Nordic countries. All the largest cities have international airports, and even towns like Haugesund and Ålesund have some international flights. Almost all European airlines serve at least one Nordic airport.\n\nSAS Scandinavian Airlines (Denmark, Norway, Sweden) is the flag carrier and dominant airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Copenhagen Airport (CPH IATA) is the main hub, with secondary hubs in Stockholm-Arlanda and Oslo-Gardermoen. Intercontinental flights to San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C, New York, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo\n\nFinnair (Finland) is Finland's flag carrier, flying out from its main base in Helsinki (HEL IATA), utilizing its eastern location for transit flights between Europe and Asia. Intercontinental flights to New York, Delhi, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Singapore.\n\nIcelandair (Iceland) – Iceland's flag carrier leverages on its strategic location midway between Europe and North America to maintain a strong presence on North American routes, with its main hub in Keflavík Airport (KEF IATA). Intercontinental flights to Seattle, Minneapolis-St Paul, Orlando, Boston, New York, Toronto, Halifax, and Philadelphia Int'l Airport\n\nAtlantic Airways (Faroe Islands) - Flies to many destinations in the North Atlantic, including Britain and Iceland, and their partner airline Icelandair extends the North Atlantic network to include several destinations in Greenland.\n\nNorwegian (Scandinavia) is a budget carrier, which despite the name, does not just fly from Norway. It flies from Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen although they ended their intercontinental operations in 2021.\n\nBesides these, many international airlines offer direct routes to the Nordic countries. Emirates, Gulf Air, Air Canada and Singapore Airlines fly to Copenhagen, Air China to Stockholm. Also PIA (Pakistan), Thai, Qatar Airways, American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines all service several intercontinental routes to Scandinavia.\n\nAlternative low cost airlines in the region include Norwegian in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Many of the low cost airlines mainly serve routes between the colder Scandinavia and the sunny Mediterranean; hence you can also often find bargain flights from Spain, Italy, etc. should you wish to experience a real Nordic winter.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark is well-connected to the German rail network. The direct connection to Copenhagen is, however, by the Puttgarden–Rødby ferry (a fixed link by subsea tunnel is expected to open in the late 2020s). Sweden is connected to Danish railways via the Øresund bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö, and to the German capital by a bi-daily sleeper train during the summer, bypassing Denmark via the Trelleborg–Rostock ferry – this is the last of a once formidable network of sleeper services between Central Europe and Scandinavia, as the German railways has gotten out of the business. The connections from Germany may be sold out on busy days in the tourist season, book in time. The only rail connections from the east are to southern Finland from St Petersburg and Moscow in Russia, suspended in 2022 because of Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nFor Interrail pass holders most of the ferries crossing the Baltic and North seas offer discounts (25–50%), but only the Scandlines ferries are completely included in the pass (see By ferry below).\n\nHamburg, (Germany)\n\nBerlin, (Germany)\n\nBerlin, (Germany)\n\nMoscow, (Russia) -\n\nSt Petersburg, (Russia) -\n\nCopenhagen, (Denmark))\n\nMalmö, (Sweden\n\nAarhus, (Denmark)\n\nHelsinki, (Finland)\n\nHelsinki, (Finland)\n\nDB Deutsche Bahn, 5 hours (day)\n\nSJ Berlin Night Express [dead link] , 8½ hours (night)\n\nDB Deutsche Bahn, 8½ hours (day)\n\nVR Finnish Railways[dead link] , 14½ hours (night)\n\nVR Finnish Railways[dead link] , 3½ hours (day)\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Baltic Sea ferries\n\nNorway is served by ferries from Denmark and Germany. To Sweden, there are ferries from Denmark, Germany, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Iceland is connected to Denmark and the Faroe Islands by ferry.

Denmark's main islands Fyn (Funen) and Sjælland (Zealand including Copenhagen) are connected to Jylland (Jutland) by bridge. Zealand is in turn connected to the Scandinavian peninsula through the Öresund bridge. Finland has a long land border to Russia, with several border crossings, including the one of E18 near Saint Petersburg (most of the others are remote). Also Norway has an overland border crossing with Russia, in the far north-east.\n\nDenmark is connected to the continental road network. From Denmark it is possible to cross to Sweden over the Öresund bridge (which is a toll road, see official site for prices – around €50 as of 2017). There are many ferry connections from Denmark to Sweden; most of them take cars. Save a few short stretches of regular road, you can drive all the way to Stockholm or Oslo on highway from the German ones, but keep in mind that the tolls on the two Danish highway bridges you need to pass to get to Sweden are heavy, and you could save money and kilometres on your car taking a more direct route with a ferry. Virtually all Nordic roads are toll free, but some of the larger cities (notably Stockholm, Gothenburg and Oslo) have introduced congestion charges when driving in the centre, and some of the longer bridges and tunnels levy tolls to pay for their construction.\n\nBy yacht\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Boating on the Baltic Sea\n\nIceland, the Faroes and Greenland are out in the Atlantic, so getting there requires some serious off-shore experience, but Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland are quite easily reached from the rest of northern Europe, e.g. Dutch and British vessels are regularly seen even in Finnish marinas. Norway is behind the North Sea for most visitors, but also reachable by the coast via Denmark or Sweden, while the Danish Straits, the Kiel Canal and the Göta Canal are the main options for visitors from the west to Finland or Sweden. The Baltic Sea is also reachable via inland waterways from most European countries.\n\nThe Nordic countries have a huge number of yachts compared to the population, so the infrastructure is good – and the archipelagos and fjords offer an endless coastline to explore.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThanks to the Schengen Area and the Nordic passport union, you seldom have to worry about border crossings. The main exception is travel to Greenland, the Faroe Islands or Svalbard, which are not part of Schengen.\n\nIceland, Norway and the non-Schengen territories are not part of EU, and Åland not part of the EU customs union, so there are still customs borders. If you have pets, arms or other special goods, you might have to contact customs whether or not there is a customs station where you cross or any actual checks.\n\nAn passport or suitable ID may be needed to board ferries and aeroplanes on international routes. The one land border where checks are common is the one between Denmark and Sweden, where \"temporary checks\" have been the rule rather than the exception since 2015.\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Baltic Sea ferries\n\nNo visit to the Nordic countries is complete without a ferry cruise. Major coastal cities of the Baltic Sea are often connected with ferry lines, e.g. Turku–Stockholm and Helsinki–Tallinn, and ferries are a natural part of many journeys for Scandinavians. The larger long-distance ferries are in effect cruise ships, with behemoths like the Silja Europa featuring 13 decks stacked full of shops, restaurants, spas, saunas etc. Longer routes are nearly always scheduled to sail during the night, so you arrive fresh to continue the often long journeys required here. If you travel by ferry to Norway or via Åland, there are Tax Free sales on board, since Norway is not part of the EU and Åland is subject to special regulations. For the same reason some of these lines, especially the Stockholm–Helsinki ferries, are known as party boats – alcohol is heavily taxed on shore.\n\nIn addition to major lines listed below, the Hurtigruten ferries, running all along Norways amazing jagged coast line, and through spectacular fjords, from Bergen in the south to Kirkenes in the Arctic north, docking in many small hamlets and villages on the way, offer a unique and very Scandinavian experience. More than a hundred car ferries are an integral parts of Norway’s roads, most crossings are short and frequent.\n\nMinor ferries connect many inhabited islands to the mainland in also the other archipelagos, and tour boats cruise e.g. the archipelagos of Stockholm and Helsinki, and lakes such as Päijänne and Saimaa. Particularly in the Finnish Lakeland there are cable ferries across lakes, often part of the public road system. In the Archipelago Sea ferries are the only way for getting around (for those without their own boat), and the same goes for minor islands of Denmark.\n\nFromToOperator Copenhagen, (Denmark)Oslo (Norway)DFDS Seaways, 16.5 hr Grenå, (Denmark)Varberg, (Sweden)Stena Line 4.5 hr Frederikshavn, (Denmark)Göteborg, (Sweden)Stena Line 2-4 hr Hirtshals, (Denmark)Larvik, (Norway)Colorline, 4 hr Hirtshals, (Denmark)Kristiansand, (Norway)Colorline, 4 hr Hirtshals, (Denmark)Bergen, (Norway)Fjordline, 19.5 hr (via Stavanger - 11.5 hr) Hirtshals, (Denmark)Seyðisfjörður, (Iceland)Smyril line[dead link] , 69 hr (via the Faroe Islands - 44 hr summer) Hirtshals, (Denmark)Tórshavn, (Faroe Islands)Smyril line[dead link] , 44 hr (winter) Strömstad, (Sweden)Sandefjord, (Norway)Colorline, 2.5 hr Stockholm, (Sweden)Helsinki, (Finland)Tallink Silja line & Viking line, 16.5 hr (via Åland islands) Stockholm, (Sweden)Turku, (Finland)Tallink Silja line & Viking line, 11 hr (via Åland islands) Umeå, (Sweden)Vaasa, (Finland)Wasaline, 3.5 hr\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nPlanes are an efficient if boring way of travelling between and around the Nordic countries. As a rule of thumb, routes between capitals are heavily competed and have reasonable fares, but other international connections are limited and expensive, and domestic flights monopolized by a single company will charge through the nose.\n\nThe main airlines are covered above in Get in#By plane. Don't get too hung up on the names: for example, Norwegian operates many domestic flights in both Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Europe\n\nTrains are an adequate way of travelling around the Nordic countries, except the island nations and the far north. International connections between Denmark, southern Sweden and southern Norway are good, but up north services are sparse, and Iceland and the Faroe Islands have no trains at all. Norway’s rail network is limited and mostly centred on Oslo with lines to main cities in other parts of the country. Finnish railways use the Russian broad gauge, so while there are connecting rails, no regular passenger trains cross the border.\n\nThe previous night train connection between Copenhagen and Oslo has been retired, and this route now requires a change in Gothenburg, on the other hand day time connections have become much more frequent after the opening of the Øresund bridge (8.5 hr). Up to seven daily X2000 express trains run directly between Copenhagen and Stockholm (5.5 hr), and the daily night train only requires an easy change in Malmö (7.5 hr). Further north there are two daily connections between Oslo and Bodø (17 hr, via Trondheim) – the northernmost stop on the Norwegian railway network – and two daily night trains (regular and express) between Stockholm and Umeå/Luleå (16–20 hr) in the northernmost part of Sweden. The Norwegian port of Narvik is connected to the Swedish network via the impressive Iron Ore Railway through Kiruna, also served by passenger train. In Finland the daily night trains between Helsinki and Turku in the south and Rovaniemi, Kemijärvi and Kolari in the north also take cars.\n\nThe ScanRail pass was retired in 2007, but visitors not resident in Europe can opt for the very similar Eurail Scandinavia Pass[dead link], which offers 4 to 10 days of travel in a 2-month period for €230–360. For residents of Europe, the all-Europe or single-country Interrail passes are also an option. Like in the rest of Europe, some trains have mandatory seat reservation fees often not covered by the passes.\n\nMajor railway companies in the Nordic countries include DSB and Arriva in Denmark, NSB in Norway, SJ and Transdev in Sweden and VR in Finland.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you are not using a rail pass, long distance buses will often be a cheaper alternative, especially for longer journeys. Bus is also needed to get to many smaller towns or the countryside. Since highways are almost exclusively centred around the southern half of Scandinavia, journeys become increasingly time consuming as you get further north. On the other hand, rail services also get increasingly sparse in northern Scandinavia.\n\nThere is no dominant company like Greyhound is in North America or Flixbus is in Germany, but a host of local, regional and national bus companies. The major national intercity bus companies are Abildskou in Denmark, Nor-Way and Nettbuss in Norway. Big companies also include GoByBus and Swebus[dead link] , which all service routes in the Scandinavian triangle between Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. In Finland there are many national and regional companies, but the budget operator Onnibus dominates on the main intercity routes. Timetables and tickets to nearly all lines in Finland can be obtained through Matkahuolto.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nDriving in the Nordic countries\n\nDenmark • Finland • Iceland • Norway • Sweden\n\nA self-drive is a good way to explore the Nordic countries outside to cities, particularly the rugged landscapes of Norway and Iceland. Driving is easy and traffic is mostly light, but distances are long and services limited in many less populated areas. For a self-drive in the northern section Norway, Sweden and Finland should be considered as one area. For instance, the shortest route from south Norway to Finnmark is through Sweden and Finland.\n\nDriving in the Nordic countries is costly, even by European standards. Rentals are often expensive, fuel price is among the world's highest, and distances are long. In Norway, in particular, distances that seem short on a map can be very long and tiring if you need to drive along twisty fjord roads. Collisions with wildlife, particularly moose, deer and, mostly north of the Arctic circle, reindeer, are quite common and can be fatal. On the other hand, roads are generally in good condition, traffic is disciplined, and per capita fatalities are among the lowest in the world, for instance the US has four times higher accident rates than Norway (per 2017) ̣—̣ Norway and Sweden are aiming for zero fatalities.\n\nFrom November until end of March (and well into May in the northern regions), expect winter driving conditions and have proper equipment – particularly winter tyres, as roads are treacherously slippery. People will drive nearly as in summer, so with summer tyres you will either block the traffic or cause an accident. Nordic type winter tyres (studded or unstudded) are the best, although other types with enough tread depth are permitted. Black ice in the morning and occasional snowfall are possible also quite early in the autumn, and then mess up traffic worse than in winter, as not everybody is prepared. Leave your car alone such days (many locals who had not yet switched to winter tyres do), at least in the morning, until things have settled, especially if you were not prepared for winter driving. Studded tyres are allowed from November to sometimes in April, except in some parts of a few city centres.\n\nSpeed limits are reduced in winter on some major roads, but not enough for bad conditions; you and your travel mates can get seriously injured if you drive ill prepared or too fast. Study the regulations carefully; you can get fined for not having winter tyres in some countries in certain periods and conditions and driving with studded tyres might either cost you a fee or be limited to certain periods:\n\nIn Denmark studded tyres are allowed from 1 November to 15 April.\n\nIn Finland studded tyres are allowed from 1 November to one week after Easter, and otherwise with good reason (i.e. icy or snowy roads expected here or at the destination). Winter tyres are mandatory from 1 December through the end of February if conditions require (i.e. on many small roads and everywhere every now and then).\n\nIn Iceland studded tyres are allowed from November to April.\n\nIn Norway studded tyres are allowed from 1 November; there is a fee for using studded in cities: 30 kr per day. Winter tyres are mandatory November–April.\n\nIn Sweden winter tyres are mandatory in winter conditions from 1 December to 31 March (for cars registered in Sweden; foreign cars with summer tyres are not allowed to drive in bad conditions). Driving with studded tyres is forbidden in certain streets.\n\nSpeed limits are uniform; 50 km/h (31 mph) in cities and 80 km/h (50 mph) (70 km/h in Sweden) on rural roads unless otherwise indicated. Motorways range from 100 km/h (62 mph) or 110 in Norway (only when signposted, otherwise 80), 110 in Sweden, 120 in Finland to 130 in Denmark, again unless other speed limits are signposted. Keep in mind that while many Scandinavians routinely exceed speed limits slightly, fines are heavy, so you will in essence probably be gambling with your holiday budget. Speeding in city zones is considered a severe offence, and there are many unmarked automatic speed traps installed in such zones.\n\nWithin Norway there are many car ferries across fjords and straits. These are not separate means of transport but an integral part of the road network. On main roads ferries are mostly frequent (2–3 per hour) and most crossings are short (10–25 minutes).\n\nSome main routes are E75 through Finland (\"Nelostie\"), E4 through Sweden, E6 through Sweden and Norway (\"Eseksen\"), E8 through Finland and Norway, E10 through Sweden and Norway, E18 through Norway, Sweden and Finland, and E45 through Denmark and Sweden. Some of these are useful also for getting in.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Boating on the Baltic Sea\n\nThere is a boat for every seventh person in each of Finland, Norway and Sweden, so facilities for yachts as well as availability of boats, through a local friend or by rent or charter, are good. These countries also have large archipelagos and many lakes, with ample opportunities for boat trips. Norway's coastline is around 100,000 km when fjords and islands are included, and there are more than 100,000 islands, offering endless opportunity for sailing in sheltered waters. Figures are similar in the other two of these countries. The sea is important also for Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\nHitchhiking is not too common in the Nordic countries. In some regions it is quite easy to get a ride – once there comes a vehicle – in others only a small fraction of cars take hitchhikers. If trying to hitchhike in autumn or winter, remember it can get quite (or very) cold, and hours with daylight are limited. There are large sparsely inhabited areas; avoid having a ride end in the middle of nowhere in the evening, unless you are prepared to stay the night there. In addition to the normal places, it is possible to approach drivers on ferries and ask for a ride.\n\nBy bike\n\n[edit]\n\nBicycle infrastructure varies from country to country and from town to town, but is generally at least decent.\n\nHelmet, lights (at least from August), reflectors and lock are mandatory or strongly advised.\n\nThe best developed bicycle infrastructure is in Denmark (see Cycling in Denmark), where bike lanes are ubiquitous in cities and common also in the countryside, with a good network of routes. In the other countries there are usually some kind of bike lane network in the cities, but the routes may not be obvious or complete, and they are not always maintained in winter. The main roads outside of towns do not always have bike lanes or usable shoulders, and not all drivers are careful when passing by.\n\nIt is usually easy to find places to rent a bike, and municipal short-time rental systems have been introduced in some cities.\n\nIt is usually possible to take the bike on coaches and trains for moderate fees, which is recommended for most to do on some stretches because of the long distances. In Sweden only folding bikes can be taken on trains. Short-haul ferries are often free or nearly free for cyclists, Baltic ferries take a small surcharge. In general the price for a cyclist will be the same as for a \"pedestrian\" or slightly higher, and much lower than for hauling around a ton of metal box.\n\nIn Finland and Sweden there are often minor roads that make good routes for long-distance cycling, provided you have a map allowing you to navigate them. Most cities have decent bike lane networks.\n\nIn Iceland there are few bike lanes outside Reykjavik, but cycling is quite safe because of low traffic (except on the roads out of Reykjavik). The weather and the distances between towns can be challenging.\n\nIn Norway cycling is popular and a fine way to see the varied landscape. The mountainous landscape, often quite narrow roads and sometimes less respectful drivers makes cycling a challenge. Some main roads and mountain passes have 7–10% slopes and there are countless tunnels, some of them very long. In many areas there is only one road and no alternative local road. Also here there are some old roads usable as (or transformed to) cycling routes. Following major roads, check whether bikes are allowed in the tunnels. Even if cycling is allowed in a tunnel, it is often uncomfortable. Norway has many subsea tunnels and these are often steep. Bike lanes are not too common, even in towns, but speeds are usually quite low. Bicycle visitors should plan carefully and consider using train, bus or express passenger boat on some difficult stretches.\n\nThere are a couple of EuroVelo cycling routes through the countries (mostly developed but not yet signed):\n\n1) The Atlantic Coast Route from Nordkapp southwards along the coast\n\n3) The Pilgrim Route from Trondheim towards Santiago de Compostela\n\n7) The Sun Route from midnight sun of Nordkapp through Sweden towards Malta\n\n10) Baltic Sea Cycle Route (Hansa circuit) around the coasts of the Baltic Sea\n\n11) East Europe Route from Nordkapp through Finland towards Athens\n\n12) North Sea Cycle Route from the British islands with ferry and to Germany by the coasts\n\n13) The Iron Curtain Trail from the Barents Sea and Kirkenes along the Russian border in Finland and via St. Petersburg towards the Black Sea\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a constant and long-standing rivalry between Copenhagen and Stockholm over which city can claim the title as Scandinavia's unofficial capital. Depending on how you count, both cities are the largest, most visited, and the target of most investment. However, after the completion of the Øresund bridge, and subsequent integration of Copenhagen and Malmö – Sweden's third largest city – this region is fast emerging as the main urban centre in Scandinavia, while Stockholm arguably grabs the title as the most beautiful.\n\nVisit the unusual free city of Christiania in Copenhagen\n\nVisit the famous Tivoli Gardens theme park in Copenhagen\n\nSee the amazing Vasa Museum in Stockholm, displaying an entire flagship that sunk in the harbour nearly 400 years ago\n\nSceneries\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the fjords of Norway might be the most spectacular Nordic sceneries, the other countries have their fair share of beautiful nature as well, e.g. the Stockholm archipelago and the Archipelago Sea in the Baltic Sea, the thousand lakes of Finland (and quite some in Sweden), quiet forests and wide open landscapes of Iceland and of the north.\n\nThose interested in geology will find many traces of the Ice Age. Especially easy to see are the glacial erratics (big stones brought from far by the ice) and the look of smooth bedrock. The bedrock of Fennoscandia is very old; in Kolvanuuro near Kontiolahti there are traces of an ice age 2,500 million years (sic!) ago. The younger Stevns Cliff in Denmark shows evidence of the meteorite impact that caused the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million year ago.\n\nThe Nordic countries also give opportunities to see Eurasian wildlife. Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Norwegian coast have the Atlantic with whales and spectacular bird cliffs. The taiga forest stretches from the Pacific coast through Finland and Sweden to parts of Norway, and especially in Finland there are several eastern species not seen in western Europe.\n\nThe region also offers the most accessible experience of the Arctic. While there is little real tundra, the fell heath is tundra-like, with many Arctic species, and the countries show features not found southwards, such as aapa and palsa bogs. Large areas in the north are sparsely inhabited, with little light pollution, allowing fully experiencing polar night, stars and northern lights. The Arktika, the migration of Arctic birds, can be seen also in more southerly regions.\n\nNorthern Lights\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Northern Lights (Latin: Aurora Borealis; Scandinavian: Nordlys/-ljus; Swedish: Norrsken; Finnish: Revontulet) can be seen in Iceland and in the northern parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden, and at rare occasions as far south as in Denmark. With a bit of bad luck they are obscured by clouds, so take local weather into account if planning to watch for them – and they do not appear every night. In cities they are usually masked by light pollution, so unless you aim for the outdoors, villages or minor towns, you should make some effort to see them.\n\nViking heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vikings and the Old Norse\n\nBefore AD 1000 Norse people only wrote short rune carvings, and most literature about the Viking Age was either authored by the Viking's enemies, or written down centuries later. Since most of their buildings have perished, the Viking Age is shrouded in mystery. Still, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden all have archaeological sites and Viking-themed museums.\n\nWhile traces from the Viking Age are of modest size, they are numerous, especially runestones and burial mounds, everywhere in Scandinavia. Some good places to see Viking age artifacts are the Swedish History Museum (\"Historiska museet\") in Stockholm, Birka in Ekerö, the Settlement Exhibition Reykjavík 871±2 of the Reykjavik City Museum (\"Minjasafn Reykjavíkur\") in Reykjavik, the Viking Ship Museum (\"Vikingeskibsmuseet\") in Roskilde, Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, and Old Uppsala in Uppsala.\n\nMonarchies\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Nordic monarchies\n\nDenmark, Sweden, and Norway are all monarchies, although the royal families only have ceremonial roles. They remain part of society and are, more or less, popular among the population. They remain public figures often portrayed in the media and taking part in all sorts of events. Wherever they will show up, something interesting is likely going on. But more importantly, royal palaces and mansions are dotted throughout the region and make for some quality sightseeing, and knowing they are actual homes of some of the longest continuously running royal families in the world just makes it better. The royal families are related in different ways and when Norway became a separate monarchy in 1905 a Danish prince was elected king.\n\nNordic design\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Functionalist architecture in Finland\n\nScandinavia is famous for its design and architecture, which are often characterised by a minimal and functional approach. Copenhagen and Helsinki are the best places to experience it with some excellent, interactive museums and some live samples throughout the streets. Actually, the design and architecture are some of the strongest, most important assets of these cities, but there are interesting opportunities elsewhere as well. Functionalism in architecture (Norwegian and Swedish: funkis) had a stronghold in the Nordic countries from around 1930. Bergen, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Aarhus have notable funkis buildings. Since year 2000 Oslo there has been a boom in daring architecture in Oslo. See Swedish Grace Tour for Stockholm's interpretation of Art Deco architecture.\n\nFolk culture\n\n[edit]\n\nNordic folk culture expresses the peasantry's heritage in folk music and dance (see Nordic music), folk costumes (with the Norwegian bunad frequently worn even by young women), folk art, handicraft (slöjd, hemslöjd) and traditional farming. Local identity used to be based on the socken/sogn (parish) and the province. Many provinces have an open-air museum with buildings, workshops and sometimes livestock and wild animals on display; the oldest ones being Skansen in Stockholm and Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo.\n\nThe northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland are home to the Sami an indigenous people.\n\nFiction tourism\n\n[edit]\n\nAstrid Lindgren tourism: Astrid Lindgren is one of the world's most read children's authors.

The countries, in particular Denmark, are known for its many music festivals during the summer months. The largest in each country are:\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2020s, the Nordic countries can be rather expensive for foreigners, particularly when it comes to services, renting a car, eating out, taxis, alcohol and tobacco, sometimes even exceeding world cities like Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York City and London. Norway and Iceland are particularly expensive. That said, there's plenty of nature and wildlife that's free. Many museums and galleries are free or moderately priced (in Finland a €40 one-week museum card is valid for most). Public transport is not too expensive, at least for children, students and seniors. Luxury items may even be cheaper in the Nordic countries than elsewhere. Tipping is not expected, as menus and bills include taxes and service.\n\nFinland is the only Nordic country which uses the euro. Denmark's currency is pegged to the euro within a narrow band.\n\nIceland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden each has a national currency, all known as krona or krone (plural krónur/kronor/kroner), often shortened kr. The centesimal subdivision is øre, although only Denmark has coins smaller than 1 kr; bills are rounded when paid in cash (so \"kr 1,95\" means 2 kr in practice). At the currency exchange, the currencies are known as DKK, ISK, NOK and SEK, with the first letter the same as in the country's name. Foreign currencies are generally not accepted, except at border towns. Euro may be taken in some shops in the cities.\n\nATMs are common in cities. Most establishments accept credit cards (at least VISA and Mastercard), so carrying large amounts of cash is usually unnecessary. In fact in Sweden, cash is refused at many places; and in Denmark, many establishments may legally refuse cash payments after 22.00. Small businesses that cannot afford card terminals may prefer payment by app, (e.g. in Norway Vipps, in Sweden Swish, each of which requires a local bank account generally only open to residents).\n\nSuggested shopping items include traditional handicraft, and modern Nordic design. Neither is cheap, though.\n\nAs the Nordic countries were relatively unharmed by modern wars, antique furniture are easy to find. Craft furniture from the early 20th century are too ubiquitous to be recognized as antique, and can usually be bought cheaper than modern pieces.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Nordic cuisine\n\nThe cuisines of all Scandinavian countries are quite similar, although each country does have its signature dishes. Seafood features prominently on restaurant menus, although beef, pork, lamb and chicken are more common in everyday dishes. Potatoes are the main staple, most often simply boiled, but also made into mashed potatoes, potato salad and more. Spices are used sparingly, but fresh herbs are used to accentuate the ingredients.\n\nFamous pan-Scandinavian dishes include:\n\nHerring, especially pickled\n\nMeatballs, served with potatoes, berries and creamy sauce\n\nSalmon, especially smoked or salt-cured (gravlax)\n\nSmörgåsbord, a popular lunch option with bread, herring, smoked fish, cold cuts and more\n\nBread comes in dozens of varieties, with dark, heavy rye bread a speciality, and Scandinavian pastries are so well known that the word \"danish\" has even been imported into English.\n\nAlthough derived from German sausages, the hot dog has been adapted for local tastes, with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland each having their own unique national styles. Danish røde pølser in particular are seen as an important part of national culture and cuisine.\n\nSince the early 21st century, there has been a focus on revitalizing the Nordic kitchen by focusing on local produce and generally raising the quality of gastronomy in the region, in an approach often called New Nordic or Modern Scandinavian cuisine. This has influenced both everyday cooking and fine dining. As a result, excellent high end restaurants have developed in the region's cities, especially Copenhagen and Stockholm. Copenhagen's Noma, opened in 2003, was ranked as the best restaurant in the world by Restaurant magazine in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014 and stood in the magazine's 2nd place as of 2019.\n\nAs in most of Europe, internationalized fast food and ethnic cuisines are popular in major Nordic cities. Denmark and Sweden have a particularly large number of Middle Eastern, Chinese and other Asian diners. Norway has a large number of Asian cafés and restaurants.\n\nAwareness about dietary restrictions is high, at least in big cities. Most restaurants have vegetarian options, although often not very special. Good vegetarian restaurants are found in many cities. Halal meat is more difficult to find in mainstream establishments.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nVikings were famously heavy drinkers, and despite continuing government efforts to stamp out the demon drink through heavy taxation, today's Scandinavians continue the tradition. Bring in your full tax-free allowance if you plan to indulge, since in Norway you can expect to pay up to 60 NOK (€7) for a pint of beer in a pub, and Sweden and Finland are not far behind. Alcohol in Denmark is significantly cheaper, although still more expensive than elsewhere in Europe. To reduce the pain, it is common to start drinking at home before heading out to party. The drinking age is generally 18 (20 in Iceland), but many bars and clubs have their own higher age limits.\n\nDenmark is the only Nordic country where stronger alcoholic beverages can be bought in supermarkets. The other countries restrict most retailing to government-operated stores. Vinmonopolet in Norway, Vinbuđin on Iceland, Systembolaget in Sweden and Alko in Finland. Age limits and closing hours are strict.\n\nThe main tipples are beer and vodka-like distilled spirits called brännvin, including herb-flavored akvavit. Spirits are typically drunk as snaps or ice-cold from shot glasses.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nAs expected, hotels are quite expensive. Some money can be saved by timing (business hotels are cheaper in the weekends etc.), but it may be worthwhile to check other options.\n\nIn the countryside, hotels are sparse except at resorts, but there are usually guesthouses or similar instead, often very nice. Another option (at resorts and in the countryside) is a cottage, some of them very reasonably priced for a group, at least off season – but check what to expect, the facilities vary wildly.\n\nWith so much incredible nature outside the doorstep, it should be no surprise that the Scandinavian countries have a well developed hostel network, named Vandrerhjem/Vandrarhem in the Scandinavian languages – literally translating into \"wanderers' home\" or \"hikers' home\". While the rules are often quite strict, it is much cheaper than hotels, and with almost 800 hostels available, you can often find one. The respective national organisations are called Danhostel in Denmark, STF or SVIF in Sweden, Norske Vandrerhjem in Norway, SRM in Finland, and Farfuglar in Iceland.\n\nThroughout the Nordic countries, with exception of more densely populated Denmark, Allemansrätten (\"Every Man's Right\"), is an important underpinning of society, and guarantees everyone the right to stay or camp on any uncultivated land for one or two nights, as long as you respect certain norms, stay out of sight of any residents, and leave no traces of your visit when you leave. If you enjoy the great outdoors, this can help make the otherwise expensive Scandinavian countries become quite affordable. In national parks and similar, and in the Norwegian mountains, there are also wilderness huts, with price of lodging varying from free (open wilderness huts in Finland, a few primitive huts in Norway) to cheap or reasonable (Iceland, Norway and Sweden; reservation huts in Finland)\n\nCar camping (or just camping) can be an economic option; there are camping sites also near many cities.\n\nIn cottages and hostels you are often supposed to bring your own linen, with linen provided for a fee otherwise, or in some cases, like some wilderness huts, not provided at all. If using primitive facilities, a sleeping bag may be handy or even needed. Sleeping bags for summer use are often enough also when camping in season (and not much too warm indoors), but night temperatures close to freezing are possible most of the year; early and late in the season, and in the north and the mountains, a three-season sleeping bag can be a good choice.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nordic countries are in EEA and thus fully participate in the free movement of labour, so EU citizens can take jobs on basically the same conditions as locals. While English is good enough for some types of jobs, most careers require fluency in the national language. Language is less of a barrier for intra-Nordic migrants, as Swedish, Norwegian and Danish are mutually intelligible, and many Icelanders and Finns speak one of those languages. Requirements for official recognised qualifications can be a hindrance for taking some jobs, also for EU citizens; in a few cases a simple test may be enough, or a foreign certificate can get recognised with some paperwork, so check beforehand.\n\nThe Nordjobb is a scheme for summer jobs (with housing and activities) for the youth. Proficiency in Danish, Norwegian or Swedish and Nordic or EEA citizenship is required.\n\nSalaries tend to be high; but so are consumption taxes and costs of living (income taxes are on par with other countries in western Europe). Of course the taxes pay for a lot of social and healthcare programs, and mostly free education; working while raising small children is made easier by generous pro-family policies and childcare institutions. The Nordic countries provide generous paternity leave in addition to maternity leave, and fathers are generally expected to share an equal responsibility with mothers in raising children.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Winter in the Nordic countries\n\nCrime rate is generally low, but use common sense to avoid drunk brawls, vandalism, and pickpocketing, especially in large cities. The Nordic countries are usually ranked as the world's least corrupt countries; bribes are never expected and would lead to trouble in most situations.\n\nCold weather is a major risk factor during the winter; and year round in highland and Arctic areas. Hypothermia can occur well above freezing if there is wind or rain, and is a risk factor when you cannot get indoors, such as when hiking. There may be a similar problem in particularly cold weather in cities at night, if you get lost or cannot find a taxi, but you seldom have to endure such a situation for several hours.\n\nFor daytime activities in cities and towns, the cold is hardly dangerous, as you can get indoors if need be, but adequate clothing allows you to enjoy the winter weather – and in severe cold you'd easily find yourself confined to indoor activities if your clothing is deficient.\n\nWildlife is not a big threat, and threat from big carnivores is irrelevant. Instead crashing into elk or deer on the road, or getting borreliosis or TBE from ticks are real threats. Mosquitoes can be a nuisance in the countryside summer, in some areas one not to take lightly, but they don't carry any diseases (malaria disappeared from here in the 19th century).\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tap water is mostly of very good quality (in Iceland despite the volcanic smell), often better than bottled water. Where the tap water is not safe (such as on trains), you can expect there to be a warning. Also, good-looking water from streams is good in many areas. In important ground water areas there may be restrictions on swimming, et al.\n\nThe countries have a well-developed public healthcare service, mostly subsidised for Nordic citizens and those with the European Health Insurance Card (i.e. from EU/EEA/Switzerland/UK). Travellers from elsewhere should check that their insurance covers the costs, which can be high (don't confuse fees for nationals with actual costs). Also, medical evacuation out of the countries and non-urgent care are not covered. There are also private clinics. Emergency care is always provided; payment is sorted out afterwards.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\n“ Att komma i tid är att komma för sent.\n\n\"Showing up on time, is showing up too late.\" ”\n\n—Attributed to a Swedish drill officer.\n\nNordic people are generally cosmopolitan and secular. They have some virtues in common:\n\nEquality: treat people equally, regardless of their gender or title.\n\nModesty: bragging, or showing off wealth, is not popular.\n\nPunctuality: show up on the minute for appointments and business meetings. Showing up five to ten minutes before set time is good manners.\n\nPrivacy: Nordic people have a justified reputation of needing much personal space, and avoiding small talk with strangers in public spaces. Even celebrities are usually able to walk down the street undisguised without worrying about being bothered by the paparazzi or their fans. Shop assistants and other service workers can be perceived as unattentive. It is good manners to keep physical distance from strangers whenever possible.\n\nTobacco smoking is prohibited at indoor venues in all countries. Rather few Nordic people smoke; instead smokeless tobacco such as snus is widely used. While sober at work and behind the steering wheel, binge-drinking alcohol during weekends is not uncommon, with a risk of drunk brawls.\n\nDespite the liberal image of the Nordic countries, narcotics including cannabis are taboo among most, young and old, and treated with zero tolerance by the police. Possession of even personal use amounts is criminalized in all five countries. Denmark, long more liberal than the rest, is taking a harder line to fight the drug dealing in Christiania, and Danish law is being administered in the district. The area is still known as the part of Copenhagen where drugs are easily accessible.\n\nThe political reputation of a society where everybody is taken care of seems at times hard to reconcile with the way in which Nordic people tend to be distant and reserved towards strangers. Keep your distance and others won't bother you, either. Loud voices are frowned on. While reserved, if asked for help people in the Nordic area tend to be sincere and helpful, even more so in the countryside and in the wilderness. The idea that the government should provide for the needy makes people more reluctant to offer help themselves where help is not needed on the spot.\n\nNordic people might be reluctant to give favours and gifts to strangers or new acquaintances. Receiving a gift of more than token value could feel like a burden for Nordic people, who value independence. At a restaurant, the norm is that everybody pays their own food and drinks (although when inviting somebody to a restaurant this rule is not clear, and a man inviting a woman for a romantic dinner could upset her either way, depending on her and on the circumstances).\n\nThe Nordic reputation to have relaxed view of nudity and sexuality is only partly true. Nordic people accept homosexual and cross-gender expressions. When it comes to public breastfeeding; if adults are allowed to eat somewhere, babies are as well. However, skinny-dipping (toddlers aside) is only accepted in private communities, at designated nudist beaches or in the remote wilderness. Public nudity is not forbidden, but \"indecent\" behaviour is, that is, if you are likely to offend (and the judgement call is difficult for a foreigner). In Sweden, Norway and Iceland, hiring a prostitute is criminalized (and also in Finland, if they are victim of trafficking), and while pornography is legal (including strip clubs), it is taboo.\n\nHunting and wildlife management are sensitive topics, where countryside-dwellers tend to have strong opinions, especially for or against the bear and wolf population. Norway and Iceland are among the few countries which allow the controversial practice of whaling.\n\nNordic people prefer to greet new acquaintances with a handshake; they might be hugging close friends. While cheek-kissing is not unheard of, most Nordic people find it confusing.\n\nWhile political relations between the Nordic countries are good, many Nordic people are patriotic — not least the Norwegians and Finns, who have fought hard for their independence in modern times. Visitors should recognise the unique character of the country they are in. There is a (mostly) friendly rivalry between the countries, particularly evident in sports, such as the rivalry between Denmark and Sweden in football (soccer), or between Finland and Sweden in ice hockey, and violence between the fans of opposing teams is not unheard of.\n\nIn each country, Lutheranism is either the state religion, or has privileged status. Church buildings are often prominent, particularly in villages, and key Christian holidays are also public holidays. Nevertheless, in practice people are rather secular in daily life, and those who go to church regularly are the exception rather than the rule. In general, Nordic people are tolerant towards people of all faiths, though attempts to proselytise are not welcome.\n\nThis region travel guide to Nordic countries is a usable article.
