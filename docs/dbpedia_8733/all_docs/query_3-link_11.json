        "text": "The first humans in Denmark\n\nThe first Danes were hunters and fisherman who probably entered the country migrating from Southern and Eastern Europe by the end of the last Ice Age around 10,000 BC.\n\nBy 3000 BC, farms had begun to appear on the flat, fertile land we now call Denmark. At first, the farmers used stone tools and weapons, but they later adopted bronze and iron.\n\nBy the time of the Iron Age, the Danes had established trade links with the Roman Empire, trading goods such as animal furs and amber. By 200 AD, the Danish people had begun using the Rune language chiseled in stone.\n\nThe glamorous, violent Vikings\n\nOne of the most notorious periods in Danish history is the age of the Vikings. It began around 793 AD with the raids on the English tidal island of Lindisfarne. The Vikings were eventually to establish settlements in Yorkshire in Northern England and in Normandy in the Northwestern part of France.\n\nThe Viking Age lasted about 250 years. At one point, the Danish Viking Sweyn Forkbeard (Svend Tveskæg) and his son Canute the Great (Knud den Store) were the kings not only of Denmark but of Norway, Southern Sweden, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland, Orkney and parts of England.\n\nThe Vikings travelled widely outside their realm, sailing to what today is Russia and Turkey. Their admirable navigation skills at sea also brought them as far as Greenland and North America. They continued to plunder and steal, along with more peaceful activities such as trading precious metals, textiles, glassware, jewellery, and fur. On occasion, they also bought and sold European slaves.\n\nThe introduction of Christianity\n\nFollowing the baptism of the Danish King Harald Bluetooth in 965 AD, the Christian clergy became influential in Danish society. The newly-adopted religion, however, did not immediately turn the Danes into a peaceful people. They continued to fight to maintain and expand their territory, conquering parts of Germany and Estonia.\n\nNordic unity and rivalry\n\nIn 1397, with the Kalmar Union, Denmark (incl. Greenland and Iceland), Norway and Sweden was joined into a single monarchy ruled by the Queen Margrethe I.\n\nThe Kalmar Union lasted until Sweden broke away in 1523, the first shot in a long rivalry between Denmark and Sweden for dominance in the region. The two countries fought on a regular basis and in 1658 Denmark had to cede the provinces of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge, which today make up the Southernmost provinces of Sweden. In 1814, the sovereignty of Norway was transferred to Sweden too. Iceland gained independence in 1918.\n\nAbsolutism and democracy\n\nThe humiliating defeat and loss of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge to Sweden set the stage for a power grab that introduced a hereditary and absolute monarchy in Denmark. The strong central government helped to create a well-organised bureaucratic state and introduce agricultural reforms that made farming more efficient, although many peasants were still tied to the land and forced to work at least part of their time for the landowner.\n\nReforms in 1784 changed this scenario and paved the way for additional rights for the peasants, and in 1814 universal primary education was introduced.\n\nIn a power struggle with the German Confederation about the affiliation of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg on the southern border with Germany. the Danish king declared himself a constitutional monarch, paving the way for the present democratic constitution.\n\nThis move led to the war with the Germans (1848-1851) which Denmark won. But tensions continued and Denmark was defeated by Germany in a renewed conflict in 1864. As a result, Denmark had to cede all three duchies.\n\nThe northern, predominantly Danish part of Schleswig, returned under Danish rule in 1920 as a result of a plebiscite following Germany’s defeat in World War I. Denmark remained neutral in World War I. A small German minority still lives in the region.\n\nThe German minority comprises approximately 10-15,000 people, who reside mainly in the southern and western parts of Sønderjylland, where they account for approximately 7 percent of the total population. Members of the German minority in Denmark are Danish nationals and speak both Danish and German. The German minority runs its own schools and day cares that receive funding from both the Danish and German governments.\n\nRead more about the German minority in Denmark here\n\nImportant events in Danish history\n\nC. 10000 BCE First hunters inhabit Danish lands\n\n3900 BCE Basic society built on agriculture and animal husbandry\n\n400 - 700 Urbanisation begins\n\n866 - 867 Danish Vikings conquest York, which becomes the Viking capital of England\n\nC. 965 Introduction of Christianity to Denmark\n\n1015 - 1034 England under Danish rule\n\n1397 - 1523 The Kalmar Union: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Orkney\n\n1479 Founding of the University of Copenhagen\n\n1523Loss of Sweden\n\n1536 The Reformation, Norway incorporated into Denmark\n\n1660 - 1661 Introduction of absolutism – absolute power of the monarchy\n\n1666 - 1917 Danish colonies created in the Caribbean\n\n1807 Copenhagen bombed by the English navy\n\n1814 Loss of Norway\n\n1848 Abolition of absolutism\n\n1849 First democratic constitution - \"the June Constitution\"\n\n1864 Loss of the duchies Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg\n\n1914 - 1918 Danish neutrality during World War I\n\n1915 Constitutional reform, enfranchisement of women\n\n1918 Iceland gains independence from the Kingdom of Denmark\n\n1920 North-Schleswig votes in favour of reunion with Denmark\n\n1940 - 1945 German occupation during World War II\n\n1945 Founding membership of the UN\n\n1949 Membership of NATO\n\n1973 Membership of the EEC\n\n1993 Membership of the EU\n\n2011 First female Prime Minister in office, Helle Thorning-Schmidt"
