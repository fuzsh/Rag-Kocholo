        "text": "Denmark is one of the happiest countries in the world, you will see that Danish people are very friendly and welcoming. The Danes are known for being cosmopolitan, well-educated, and open-minded people. Equality is a key word in Danish culture. The vast majority of people belong to the middle class, and the percentage of poor people is low. The idea that everyone should have equal opportunities is reflected in the healthcare system as well as in the educational system, among other things. In Danish culture, people follow the concept of hygge (creating a warm atmosphere and enjoying the good things in life with good people) – they value their personal space and love to be cosy and comfortable.\n\nDenmark is composed of the Jutland Peninsula and 406 islands, but only 79 of them are inhabited. And even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are self-governing, they are still part of the Kingdom of Denmark. So, if you are inserted to go to the North Atlantic if you want to be in Denmark mainland you can say no to a North Atlantic placement. But even in the mainland you will probably be placed in the countryside or suburban areas.\n\nDanish food is diverse and has a wide variety of fresh produce, grains, and meats. Other staples are roast pork, pickled herring, fish, beans, Brussels sprouts, rice pudding, potato soup, meatballs in curry sauce, salted black licorice, and pastries.\n\nDanish lunch is traditionally an open sandwich called smørrebrød. Dinner is usually the main meal and typically a time for the whole family to gather and talk about their days. Occasionally, Danish families will go out to eat at a restaurant, but this is a rare treat.\n\nDanish is the main language spoken but Faroese, Greenlandic and German are also recognised as official languages. As you can see from the name of the language, if you are in the Faroe Islands you will find more Faroese language and if you are in Greenland you will hear more Greenlandic. However, as English is widely taught in Denmark, a large part of the population speaks very good English.\n\nA typical school day in Denmark starts at 8 am and finishes at 3pm, with extra school activity after courses. You will need to quite independent because Danish students tend to be more mature than young people the same age in most other countries. A key phrase in Denmark is “freedom with responsibility” so any student who cannot respect this freedom may have trouble at a Danish school.\n\nFamilies in Denmark are close and most prefer to cook dinner at home together every night. Key values in a typical Danish family include punctuality, planning and responsibility. They often trust and share their daily lives with each other. It is common for all family members to attend sports clubs or other local activities after work and school. Typically, both parents in a Danish family work full-time and are away from home during the day. They are quite involved in their children’s school lives and activities. Each family member contributes to household chores and is treated equally. Parents, teachers and elders are usually referred to by their first name.\n\nOn weekends, Danish teens, like most teens around the world, like to get together with friends to hang out, go to parties or see a movie. Although soccer is the most popular sport, they also enjoy swimming, sailing or rowing (nowhere in Denmark is more than an hour away from the seashore!) Danish schools and local community organisations offer various activities, such as sports, music, crafts, drama, and scouting. Danish teens are generally independent and proactive with their schoolwork, as the Danish school system is quite rigorous.\n\nLet AFS guide your intercultural adventure\n\nAFS provides comprehensive orientation for all students and families before, during and after your exchange – AFS volunteers will be there to support and guide you the whole way through!
