I spent the first 21 years of my life in a small town in East Jutland, a town I didn’t appreciate until I moved to Copenhagen for uni and realized that I belong in the countryside. I only lasted for two years in Copenhagen and never really grew to love the city or city life. I decided to finish my Bachelor’s in Greenland, so I officially moved away from Denmark in 2018. I came back in 2020 during the Covid–19 crisis and moved temporarily to the island of Lolland to work as an archaeologist in November that same year. I loved Lolland so much that I stayed for eight months – and came back for another twelve months after half a year of travels! After a 13-month interlude in Scotland, I returned to Denmark and moved to Thisted to work at the local museum, and that’s where I’m currently at!\n\nGrowing up, I always considered Denmark to be one of the most boring countries in the world, mainly due to our complete lack of mountains. But I was blind to the fact that Denmark has some of the world’s most beautiful coastline with pristine beaches and majestic chalk cliffs as well as endless forests and rolling hills, hundreds of idyllic islands and many incredible archaeological sights dotted around the landscape just waiting to be discovered. Travelling is what made me realize how much I love Denmark. In fact, Denmark is one of few countries that I’m considering settling down in once the time is right.\n\nDespite spending most of my life living in Denmark, I still have so much that I want to see, especially the idyllic islands dotted all over the country. And I want to make it a priority. While travelling all over the world, I also want to spend several months of the year in Denmark so I can explore my own backyard."
