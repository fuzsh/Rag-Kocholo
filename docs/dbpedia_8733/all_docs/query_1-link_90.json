If you want to live in another Nordic country, you simply need to register with the national register.\n\nAs an EU citizen you have the right to work, study or live in any EU/EEA country without a residence permit. You also have the right to start and operate a private business. The right of EU citizens to stay in another EU/EEA country without a residence permit is called right of residence. You have right of residence if you are employed, self-employed, a student or have enough means to support yourself. If you have right of residence, you do not need to contact the Migration Agency, you need to register with the national register.\n\nNational register in the Nordic countries:\n\nDenmark – Citizen Service Centre (Borgerservicecenter)\n\nFinland – Digital and population data services agency (Myndigheten för digitalisering och befolkningsdata)\n\nIceland – Registers Iceland (Þjóðskrá Íslands)\n\nNorway – Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten)\n\nSweden – Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket)\n\nMoving to a Nordic country as a non-EU/EEA citizen\n\nIf you or your family are citizens of a non-EU country and you intend to live in Sweden, you can apply for residence permits and work permits in accordance with each country’s national rules.

They also do well for digital life, safety and security, and health and well-being. Most foreigners enjoy the work-life balance but are quite often dissatisfied with their career prospects, and the high cost of living is a frequent cause for complaint.\n\nLiving in the Nordic countries you get access to affordable childcare and education, an amazing environment, and a great work-life balance. However, throughout the Nordic region foreign people suffer from social isolation and struggle with settling in.\n\nIt can be hard to move to another country, and it can be hard to make friends in a new country – and so even in the Nordic countries. Being a foreigner and getting used to local habits and different cultures is always a challenge – but also very rewarding.\n\nThe Danes are outspoken, the Finns are silent, the Icelanders are private, the Norwegians are family orientated, and the Swedes are punctual.\n\nTo some the Nordic people may seem a little private at first – not wanting to intrude on other people’s personal space uninvited. Nordic people don’t really make small talk unless provoked and they often keep their friends from childhood.\n\nWhile they all might seem reserved at first, you will usually find the people of the Nordic countries fun-loving once you get to know them. The best advice is to make the first move - go ahead and say hello. You’ll soon discover that most of the people of this region are very approachable, friendly, and helpful.\n\nAny tips & tricks?\n\nIf you have some great tips & tricks for relocating to a Nordic country as a nurse, please share them below."
