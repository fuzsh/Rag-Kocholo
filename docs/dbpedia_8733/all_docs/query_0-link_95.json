        "text": "International Scholarships for Europe’s Nordic Countries main image\n\nNorthern Europe is renowned for its style, high living standards and world-class higher education. So, it’s little wonder that the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) are prime destinations for study abroad students.\n\nWhile higher education in most Nordic countries was free for all up until a few years ago, tuition fees are being gradually introduced. As it stands, only Norway and Iceland remain tuition-fee free to all. As a result, there’s growing demand for international scholarships for this part of the world, and even those looking to study in Iceland or Norway may be able to gain funding to cover living costs and other fees.\n\nKeen to attract talented students from around the world, each of the five Nordic countries offers various scholarship opportunities for international students.
