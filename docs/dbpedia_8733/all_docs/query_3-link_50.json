Denmark, a Scandinavian country slightly less than twice the size of Massachusetts, is originally known as the home of Viking raiders. However, it is now thought of as a modern, prosperous nation that plays a large role in the political and economic integration of Europe. Danes pride themselves on progressive social policies, a strong cultural heritage and competitiveness on the global economic market. Denmark makes the list of the world’s least corrupt countries and has one of the highest per capita incomes and highest levels of income equality in the world.\n\nTravelers should be sure to explore some of the Best Places to Visit in Denmark.
