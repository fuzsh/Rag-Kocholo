While I am a Norwegian and currently live in Norway, I have lived in other countries abroad. So have many of my family members, including my wife. Thus I feel I have some unique ability to compare as the experiences of living in different countries is something we often discuss in my family.\n\nI hope to be able to illuminate this question while giving those who might consider moving to the Nordic region, specifically Norway, a sense of what they gain and what they have to sacrifice to live here.\n\nAre Nordic Countries Really That Great?\n\nWe should examine the premise of the question, which is that Nordic countries are as great as people claim. This claim has merit:\n\nFrom 2013 until today, every time the World Happiness Report (WHR) has published its annual ranking of countries, the five Nordic countries — Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland — have all been in the top ten"
