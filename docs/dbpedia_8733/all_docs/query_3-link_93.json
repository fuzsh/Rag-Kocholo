This may account both for the reason the English\n\nspelled Danmark with an \"e\" - it was probably because that's how it sounded\n\nto them - and for the fact that Danes can't understand why the English found\n\nit necessary to replace the first \"a\" with an \"e.\"\n\n2.

We talk about\n\nGreenland (translated from Grønland) and we say Ivory Coast instead of Côte\n\nD'Ivoire, while the Danes call Austria Østrig, which is not only a\n\ntranslation of Österreich (eastern kingdom), but sounds a bit like it. The\n\nDanes used to call New York \"Ny York,\" and you may still hear the United\n\nStates referred to as \"De forenede Stater,\" although I believe \"US\" is now\n\nthe norm. New York certainly is.\n\n4. The North Sea is, naturally enough called \"Vesterhavet\" (the Western Sea)\n\nin Danish, because it's on the left, so to speak.

Roma became Rome in English and Rom in Danish, because that's how it\n\n>sounds to careless listeners.\n\nOld English 'Rome' sounds almost exactly like the modern Italian pronunci-\n\nation. But final schwas became mute in the transition from Middle to\n\nEarly Modern English, and the vowel became diphthongised. (If it had\n\nfollowed the normal development of OE. [o:], it would be /rum/ today.\n\nSometimes, the pronunciation of names can be more conservative than that\n\nof the average lexical item.)\n\n>Fyn (a Danish island) became Fuhnen in\n\n>English,\n\nOr did it become 'Fyn' in Danish? Perhaps English is more conservative in\n\nthis case. After all, ON 'Haithabu' became English 'Hedeby' but Danish\n\n'Haddeby'. We kept the /i/ insofar as it raised the preceding vowel to an\n\n/e/, but the Danes just discarded it completely.\n\n[snip]\n\n>2.

It's from\n\nthe Latin, which is based on OHG 'Ostarrihhi' (from earlier *Austarrikja).\n\nAnd both 'Nuernberg' and 'Nuremberg' come from earlier 'Nurinberg' (IIRC).\n\nIt's the Germans who have dropped a syllable here, not the rest of us who\n\nhave added one (as in the case of 'Koeln', Dutch 'Keulen', English/French\n\n'Cologne' from Latin 'Colonia [Augusta]). This is only natural--who would\n\nwe expect to shorten the word more, those who refer to it occasionally or\n\nthose who make reference to it daily?\n\n>It was probably some Cockney who in the process dropped the \"H\" from\n\n>Helsingør so it became Elsinore.

Since\n\nthat's not the case with Copenhagen (the harbour sits in a narrow passage\n\nbetween the islands of Zealand and Amager), researchers ought to have taken\n\nanother crack it.\n\nThe place was referred to back in 1026 when Olaf den Hellige (literally Olaf\n\nthe Holy One) summoned the Danes to a \"ting\" or parliament on the Zealand\n\nside of the Sound, but it was not until 1043 when the name was recorded, and\n\nthen only as \"Hafn,\" which later became \"Hawn and eventually \"Havn\" -\n\nharbour. Hafn was then mentioned as the city where Svend Estridssøn sought to\n\ntake refuge when pursued by Magnus den Gode, or Magnus the Good. (I'm sure\n\nHagar the Horrible is closely related to one of aforementioned gentlemen.\n\nBlack sheep and all that)\n\nLater, \"Harbour\" became known as Merchant's Harbour, or \"Køpmannæ hawn,\" which\n\nevolved to Kjøpmandshavn, to Kjøbenhavn and eventually (this century) to\n\nKøbenhavn. Ain't got nothing to do with \"hage\" or hook. Never did.\n\nI've heard say that in some Danish dialect, Kjøbenhavn may have been\n\npronounced with a drawn-out sound at the end, something like \"...heighvn\"\n\nwhich may have led to the name being spelled Copenhagen and Kopenhagen.\n\n[1] There also those who speculate that it was the Hansa traders who mistook\n\n\"hawn\" for the Oldnordic word \"hagæ\" (grassy field), which has evolved to the\n\nDanish word \"have\" - garden. If that theory is correct, it looks like the\n\nerror of the Germans was visited upon the English. København was known as a\n\ncentre of fishing, trading and industry, not agriculture.\n\n>(You Danes aren't very\n\n>kind to your consonants.)\n\nI suspect the Danes might reply that it's their consonants, so they'll treat\n\nthem any way they like:-)\n\n\n\nIn article <7g4om1$u1$1...@nnrp1.dejanews.com>, <PJ...@JBSyndicate.com> wrote:\n\n>Please forgive me for citing more of the previous posts than I normally do.

An awful lot of years have gone by since I had\n\nthe opportunity to discuss this type of thing in person with various\n\nscholars, so I can't begin to recall names or even places where I have heard\n\nsimilar assertions being presented as fact. However, I have in the last\n\ncouple of days received email on this subject from several people who say\n\nthey are regular AUE lurkers, one of them being a lady who wrote that one of\n\nher university professors had (in her words) \"spouted that same nonsense.\"\n\n(Relax, Dan, it wasn't anywhere near Michigan.)\n\n>... No reason to conceive of some\n\n>Anglocentric cartographical conspiracy theory\n\nOf course not. But I *am* insinuating that some scholars - I wouldn't name\n\nthem here so long after the fact even I could remember their names - are\n\noccasionally substituting guesswork for good research, requiring their\n\nstudents to accompany them as they perform remarkable leaps of faith.\n\nAs you, yourself, has pointed out, the \"hage(n)\" explanation is bogus. I\n\nwouldn't dream of suggesting that you made it up out of whole cloth - that\n\nwould have been intellectual dishonesty - but I did reach the conclusion that\n\nyour source(s) is(are) unreliable. If it was the same source that supplied the\n\n\"Austria\" explanation, I think I could be forgiven for taking whatever else\n\nthat source has passed on to you with a pound of salt. (Now I know it was not\n\nthe same.)\n\nSo when you wrote:\n\n>>>...It's from\n\n>>>the Latin, which is based on OHG 'Ostarrihhi' (from earlier *Austarrikja).\n\nI responded:\n\n>>Very interesting. It it may even be accurate...\n\nI'll still maintain that it's quite possibly accurate. If it's not, I wouldn't\n\nsuggest it's your fault. Wahrig is IMO no more infallible than the pope. I\n\nsimply used the \"may even be accurate\" remark to lead into my comments about\n\nthe Copenhagen explanation, which I knew to be about as inaccurate as it could\n\nbe. Again, no fault of Dan's.\n\n[clipsville]\n\nJust a comment about Switzerland. When I wrote about the \"Schwitzers,\" I had,\n\nof course, tongue firmly placed in cheek. Now it appears I may unwittingly\n\nhave been on the right track, because someone explained to me in a private\n\nemail that in one of the Swiss dialects, the residents of that country are\n\nreferred to as Shvitzers ... that's the pronunciation, not the spelling,\n\nwhich my correspondent wasn't sure of. I hasten to add that there may be\n\nsound evidence to show the name Switzerland is more likely to have come into\n\nbeing in English by another route.\n\n\n\nD. Edward Gund v.

I did note,\n\nthough, that the bibliography omits works published between 1977 and 1771.\n\n-0-\n\nInstead of continuing to quote all the gory details, I'll take the liberty\n\nof summarizing some earlier comments.\n\nDan explained something about the origin of the name Austria, whereupon I\n\ncommented that \"it may even be accurate...\" and went on to question the\n\nreliability of some unnamed scholars.\n\nThis upset Dan no end because he saw it as\n\n>>\"... a quite uncalled at-\n\n>>> tack on my honesty.\n\nAfter I attempted to explain why I had written that and that I had chosen my\n\nwords carefully, Dan responded:\n\n>Not carefully enough, I'm afraid. \"It may even be accurate\" sounds *ex-\n\n>tremely* belittling in English, as if accuracy were achieved by coinci-\n\n>dence or pure dumb luck.\n\nHow it sounds is obviously very much in the mind of the beholder, so to\n\nspeak. I am a Canadian, my first language is English[1] and I am fully aware\n\nof the possible connotations.\n\nSince I have already explained the reason for my choice of phrase, I would\n\nhave let this matter drop here. But it now appears that Dan is unsure of the\n\nvast difference between the English word \"recall\" (as in IIRC) and the\n\nEnglish term \"off the top of my head.\" The English term \"bridging\" should\n\nalso be considered, it being a device a writer may employ to move more or\n\nless seamlessly from one subject to another by finding ideas or thoughts\n\nthat are common to both subjects.\n\nSince Dan said he recalled a certain etymology for the name Copenhagen, and\n\nsince it was patently false (I assumed Dan's recall was excellent but knew\n\nthat the source of the recalled information was in error), I felt justified\n\ncalling into question the validity of *all* his sources. That this was taken\n\nby Dan to mean I was belittling him by (I assume) suggesting he misquoted\n\ncertain authorities was IMO a pretty far stretch. I have over the years\n\ndeveloped what I consider a healthy skepticism; while I admire and enjoy\n\nusing reference works by established experts in various fields, I do not\n\nnecessarily take everything written by these authorities as gospel. I don't\n\nthink Dan does, either.\n\nSo when I went from the Austria explanation to the one about Copenhagen, I\n\nused as a bridge the words \"it may even be accurate...\" Dan may believe it\n\nto be a clumsy, inelegant or even uncalled for choice of a bridge, and he\n\nprobably does. But there's no need to get all huffy about it. When Dan\n\naccused me of making \"baseless insinuations\" and suggested I was \"talking\n\nthrough my hat,\" I didn't get all riled up. I've been in too many debates\n\nfor that. Instead, I attempted to show the basis for the insinuation ... as\n\nI have done again in the above. I'll gladly, well, reluctantly, eat crow,\n\nwhen I feel I've gone off the beaten track and will apologize if I am\n\npersuaded I have gone over the line. This is not one of those cases.\n\nSo here we go again. In one post regarding the origin of the name\n\nKøbenhavn/Copenhagen, Dan insisted that\n\n>>> ...(I covered my ass by typing\n\n>>> \"IIRC\"...\n\nIn his last post (da-da-da-daaaa), Dan said ...\n\n>...It's clearly off the top of my\n\n>head.\n\nIf in the first instance, Dan had written \"off the top of my head\" or used\n\nwords such as \"guess, speculate, reason, surmise,\" I would have bought that,\n\nnoting the coincidence that at least two people had at different times in\n\ndifferent places used the same pattern of reasoning to arrive at the\n\nidentical erroneous conclusion. If Dan had expressed himself accurately\n\nhere, I would not have been able to use the \"may even be accurate\" term\n\nwhich so offended him. I would have been up the post without a bridge.\n\nJust one final note in this silly affair: I use smileys very sparingly, but\n\nmight have inserted one after the \"may even...\" comment if it had not broken\n\nup the sentence. If I had realized such a little bit of sarcasm - clearly\n\n(to me) intended as light relief - would cause such an uproar, I might not\n\nhave used it. Then again, I might have. Looks like both Dan and I can be\n\nrather snarky when we feel the occasion calls for it.\n\n-0-\n\n[1] When I retired about three years ago, I decided to try to re-learn my\n\nlong-forgotten Danish. To that end I joined a Danish language group -\n\nnews:dk.kultur.sprog - where my first few posts, consisting of badly\n\nfractured Danish sprinkled liberally with English, caused a fair amount of\n\nmerriment among the Danes. With the aid of that group's correspondents, I\n\nhave over the last couple of years achieved a certain level of fluency in\n\nDanish ... although my sentence structure is often bass ackwards.\n\nThis fluency, resulting from the fact that I am now able to think in Danish\n\nas opposed to translating in my mind, has not come without a cost. Probably\n\nas a result of an addled old brain, I occasionally find it difficult to\n\nswitch quickly from one language to another, such as when I go from writing\n\none comment in Danish to composing a letter in English. Or rattling off a\n\npost to a group such as this. I have even been known to turn around from the\n\ncomputer and start speaking Danish to my wife who doesn't understand a\n\nsingle word of it.\n\n"
