As stated in Article 49 of the Rules of Court, the\n\nmain purpose of the Reply and the Rejoinder should be to\n\naddress those issues of the dispute which continue to divide the\n\nParties. Unfortunately, the Parties seem to have little common\n\nground with respect to the law which should govem the present\n\ndispute. Also with regard to the facts of the case the two Parties\n\nare not in agreement. The contents of the Mernorial and the\n\nCounter-Memorial make it apparent why this maritime\n\ndelimitation case is now pending before the International Court of\n\nJustice.\n\n2. Though the Counter-Memorial operates with several\n\nlines of reasoning which are said to be both independent of and\n\nsupplementary to each other, they al1 seem to end up in the\n\nthesis that the median line method amounts to a legal principle\n\nwhich must govem al1 maritime delimitation situations at least as\n\na starting point, and in the present case even as a mandatory rule\n\ndeciding the dispute.\n\n3. However, the goveming norm for maritime\n\ndelimitation according to contemporary international law is to\n\nseek an equitable solution. It is the submission of the Danish\n\nGovemment that the relevant factors substantiating that norm in\n\nthe present case, and among them first and foremost the factors\n\nof geography and population, lead to the establishment of a\n\n200-mile boundary line measured from Greenland's baseline.\n\n4. The most astonishing features in the Norwegian\n\npresentation are the assertion that the boundary line conceming\n\nthe continental shelf in the waters between Greenland and Jan\n\nMayen is already in place and has, in fact, been so since 1965,\n\nand the assertion that Denmark has caught Norway by surprise in\n\nsuddenly changing its long-standing practice of defending the\n\nmedian line approach. 5. The former assertion is without legal foundation, see\n\npages 126 - 130 paragraphs 337 - 350 below. Suffice it at this\n\nstage to recall that this contention has never been made to the\n\nDanish side during the eight years of negotiations preceding the\n\npresent proceedings before the International Court of Justice as\n\nacknowledged in the Counter-Memorial, page 73, paragraph 258.\n\n6. The latter assertion, mentioned in paragraph 4 above,\n\nis equally unfounded, see pages 130 - 150, paragraphs 351 - 408.\n\nIn this connection it is worth recalling that Nonvay itself\n\nrecognised that a median line would not in al1 situations lead to\n\nan equitable result in the North Atlantic region. Already in 1976\n\nNonvay did not pay any attention to Bear Island -and rightly so\n\n- when drawing the boundary line for the economic zone of\n\nNorway, and four years later when entering into the Agreement\n\nof 28 May 1980 with Iceland on Fishery and Continental Shelf\n\nQuestions Norway recognised that the island of Jan Mayen\n\nshould not be allowed to encroach upon Iceland's 200-mile\n\neconomic zone.\n\n7. Denmark fully shares this attitude adopted by Norway\n\nand has adopted the same position as far as the boundary line in\n\nthe waters between Greenland and Jan Mayen is concerned. In\n\nthe view of the Danish Government an equitable solution in this\n\narea would not allow Jan Mayen to encroach upon Greenland's\n\n200-mile fishery zone and corresponding shelf area. The island of\n\nJan Mayen must be well-satisfied with a claim under\n\ncontemporary international law to a maritime zone of some\n\n255,000 square kilometres consisting of a 200-mile zone to the\n\neast and a somewhat reduced zone to the south and to the West,\n\nrespecting the rights of Iceland and Greenland. That zone alone\n\nwould primafacie seem to be exorbitant compared to the land\n\narea of Jan Mayen consisting of some 380 square kilometres. In\n\nterms of maritime zones Nonvay indeed belongs to the group of\n\ncountries which may be categorised as geographically privileged\n\nStates.\n\n8. The Nonvegian Government has chosen a historical\n\napproach emphasising the importance of earlier bilateralagreements between Denmark and Norway, of Danish conduct\n\nbefore the present case arose and of the equidistance method\n\nstipulated in Article 6 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on the\n\nContinental Shelf. This approach disregards contemporary\n\ninternational law as evidenced in the 1982 Convention on the\n\nLaw of the Sea, in State practice and in international case law,\n\nespecially the Judgments of the International Court of Justice.\n\n9. Another characteristic feature of the Counter-Memonal\n\nis its constant reference to the entirlement of Jan Mayen to\n\nmaritime zones, including a median line vis-à-vis Greenland, as if\n\ntitle was the governing nom in maritime delimiration.\"Title\" and\n\n\"delimitation\" are two different legal concepts. From the fact that\n\na delimitation situation cannot arise without title, it does not\n\nfollow that title governs a maritime .delimitation situation.\n\nDelimitation is governed by the nom of equity as an expression\n\nof justice and the mle of law substantiated by a set of factors\n\nconsidered to be relevant in each individual case.\n\n10. Norway's strong emphasis on Jan Mayen's entitlement\n\nto broad maritime zones can be explained - as will be done in\n\nChapter II of Part II of this Reply - by the uncertainty as to\n\nwhether Jan Mayen could be considered to have a status under\n\ninternational law which would allow it to claim the broad\n\nmaritime zones that won general acceptance among States in\n\n1976177. Denmark does not, for its part, question Jan Mayen's\n\nstatus as an island under international law, but it is the Danish\n\nsubmission that the small size and unpopulated character of Jan\n\nMayen does not entitle the island to a maritime zone which\n\nimpinges upon Greenland's 200-mile zone. This submission still\n\nleaves a 12-mile territorial sea and an additional maritime zone\n\nof no less than 32 nautical miles to Jan Mayen vis-à-vis\n\nGreenland.\n\nII. As to the task of the Court in this case, the\n\nGovernment of Denmark furthemore wishes to make the\n\nfollowing observations. 12. Under the heading \"Procedural Issues\" the Nonvegian\n\nGovemment raises questions as to \"the nature\" of the claim\n\nbrought forward in this case. It is stated that \"(t)o the extent that\n\nthe claim for a single line is a claim for a delimitation of a\n\ndifferent nature as compared with other delimitationsu such claim\n\nwould not be admissible without the agreement of the -Parties(the\n\nCounter-Memorial. p. 197, paras. 702 - 704).\n\n13. Norway makes no reference to applicable procedural\n\nrules, and Denmark, for its. part, has not been able to identify\n\nany such niles.\n\n14. The Govemment of Denmark has asked the Court Io\n\ndeclare that Greenland is entitled to a full 200-mile fishery zone\n\nand continental shelf area vis-à-vis the island of Jan Mayen; and\n\nconsequently to draw a single line of delimitation. It is\n\nDenmark's contention that intemational law supports the claim to\n\na 200-mile fishery zone and a 200-mile continental shelf area. A\n\nspecial agreement is, therefore, not a precondition for a single\n\nline delimitation.\n\n15. The Govemment of Denmark submits that the Coun\n\nis competent to deal with the case as brought forward by\n\nDenmark and in doing so also competent to draw the final line\n\nof delimitation. This is a task already undertaken by Courts and\n\nTribunals in delimitation cases and in no sense a claim of a\n\n\"different nature\" to those normally made.\n\n16. Norway's contention that the Court should not make\n\nthe precise identification of the maritime boundary is not\n\nsupported by any legal arguments. If the contention were to be\n\nfollowed by the Court, the scope of Article 36, paragraph 2, of\n\nof the Statute of the Intemational Court of Justice would be\n\nlimited in a way which would not funher intemational justice.\n\n17. Despite the basic difference of approach the\n\nGovemment of Denmark will make a new .effort. to clarify the\n\nFacts (Part 1) and the Law (Part II), taking into account the\n\npresentation contained in the Norwegian Govemment'sCounter-Mernorial. The Reply will end by stating the Submissions\n\nof the Government of Denmark at the present juncture of the\n\nproceedings (Part III).\n\n18. The Government of Denmark reserves its position\n\nwith regard to al1points of facts and law advanced by Norway in\n\nits Counter-Mernorial which have not been addressed in this\n\nReply.'\n\n' In ils Reply. the Governmentof Denmark has not taken Nomay's\n\nCorrectedReprintof Appendix 5 to the Counter-MemorialinIo accouni. The\n\nGovernmenlof Denmarkreceivedthe CorrectedReprinton 14 January1991. PART 1\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nRefutation of the Norwegian Presentation\n\nand Supplementary Information A. The Relevant Area\n\n19. In the opinion of the Danish Government the Parties\n\nto a delimitation dispute pending before the Court should\n\nestablish the area within which the actual delimitation is to be\n\neffected. This is in accordance with the practiceof the Court, see\n\ne.g., the Libya-Malta case (I.CJ. Reports 1985, p. 20, para. 14,\n\nand pp. 49 - 50, paras. 67 '-68). The Nonvegian description of\n\nthis basic element of maritime delimitation as \"a geometrical\n\nexercise\" (the Counter-Memonal, p. 130, para. 437). \"wholly\n\nirrelevant to any delimitation in accordance with legal principles\"\n\n(ibid., pp. 148 - 49, para. 505), and an \"artificiality\" (ibid., p.\n\n149, para. 506) appears to be nothing but an attempt to avoid a\n\nconfrontation between the two coastal fronts which are the basis\n\nof title to the adjacent maritime areas of Greenland and Jan\n\nMayen, respectively.\n\n20. Nonvay has argued that by its definition of the\n\ndisputed area Denmark has requested the Court to determine its\n\nentitlement to an area which by Agreements between Nonvay and\n\nIceland of 28 May 1980 and 22 October 1981 has been afforded\n\nto Iceland, see the Counter-Memorial, page 4, paragraph 14.\n\nNorway requests the Court to confine its consideration to the\n\nmaritime area which to the south is bounded by the outer limit\n\nof the Icelandic economic zone as defined by Iceland to the point\n\nwhere this line intersects themedian line between Jan Mayen and\n\nGreenland at 70°12'04\"N (the Counter-Memorial, p. 4, para. 15).\n\n21. Denmark does not seek a decision from the Court\n\nwhich affects the rights of Iceland under international law. It\n\nfollows from Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court\n\nof Justice that a line drawn by the Court will not be binding on\n\nIceland.\n\n22. At this stage it may be appropriate bnefly to reiterate\n\nthe status of the delimitations between Iceland and Greenland and\n\nbetween Iceland and Jan Mayen. In their relevant legislationDenmark and Iceland have both provided that the waters between\n\nGreenland and Iceland will be delimited by an equidistance line,\n\nsee the Mernorial, pages 10 - 11, paragraph 27. The Parties have\n\nnot yet agreed on the drawing of the delimitation line, as\n\nDenmark has disputed the legitimacy under international law of\n\nIceland's use of the rock of Kolbeinsey as a basepoint, see ihid.,\n\npage 11, note 2. At present there are, therefore, two median lines,\n\nan.Icelandic and a Danish, see the sketch map on page 13, where\n\nthe northern line between lceland and Greenland employs\n\nKolbeinsey as a basepoint, whereas the southern line disregards\n\nKolbeinsey. Similarly, two Icelandic 200-mile lines vis-à-vis Jan\n\nMayen can be drawn. The sketch map also depicts these two\n\nlines, the northern employing Kolbeinsey as a basepoint\n\n(represented by the B-C,-D, line), the southern disregarding\n\nKolbeinsey (represented by the B-C-D line).\n\n23. The Norwegian assertion that the B-C-D line\n\npresented by Denmark in Map II of the Memorial prejudices\n\nIceland's nghts under the above mentioned Agreements between\n\nNorway and Iceland leads the Govemment of Denrnark to make\n\ntwo observations. First, that under international law two States\n\ncannot by agreement divide a maritime area to which a third\n\nState has a legitimate claim without the consent of that State.\n\nThus, any agreed Icelandic-Norwegian boundq within maritime\n\nareas that Greenland claims in accordance with international law\n\nis not binding on Denmark.\n\n24. Secondly, the disputed area and the relevant area were\n\ndefined by Denmark in its Memonal precisely with a view to\n\nleaving the interests of Iceland unaffected, see the Memorial,\n\npage 10 - 11, paragraphs 25 - 29 and Map II. The definition of\n\nthe two areas was based on the assumption that in the\n\nAgreements between lceland and Nonvay of 1980 and 1981,\n\nNonvay had not consented to Iceland's use of Kolbeinsey as a\n\nbasepoint.

The Agreements between Nonvay and Iceland of 1980\n\nand 1981 do not express such consent. No map depicting the\n\nactual delimitation line was attached to either Agreement as\n\npublished in the official Nonvegian ga~ette.~ The Danish\n\nassumption that Kolbeinsey had not been recognised as a valid\n\nIcelandic basepoint by Norway was further supported by the\n\nsketch map attached to the Iceland-Nonvay Agreement of 22\n\nOctober 1981 in Annex 28 to the Memorial. This map was\n\ncopied by Denmark from the United Nations publication Maritime\n\nBoundav Agreements (1970 - 1984), Office for Ocean Affairs\n\nand the Law of the Sea, New York, 1987, pages 38 - 42. The\n\nmap from this publication is reproduced in Annex 56. In this\n\nmap the delimitation line between lceland and Jan Mayen stops\n\nat a point that is close to or coincides with the point where\n\nKolbeinsey starts to affect the drawing of the line (point C, on\n\nthe sketch map on, page 13 above). Maps showing a similar\n\ndelimitation line, Le., tenninating before Kolbeinsey starts to\n\ninfluence the line, are found in the Report of the Conciliation\n\nCommission appointed by the Governments of Iceland and\n\nNorway to recommend a delimitation of the continental shelf area\n\nbetween Iceland and Jan Mayen (I.L.M. Vol. XX, 1981, p. 828)\n\nand in the Proposition dated 19 Febmary 1982 submitted by the\n\nNonvegian Govemment to the Srorring relating to the granting of\n\nconsent to conclusion of an Agreement with Iceland on the\n\ncontinental shelf between Jan Mayen and Iceland (St.Prp. No.\n\n61). The map from the Norwegian Govemment's Proposition to\n\nthe Storting is reproduced in Annex 57.\n\n26. The sketch map now attached by Nonvay to the 1981\n\nAgreement between Iceland and Norway on the Continental Shelf\n\nand presented in Annex 72 to the Counter-Mernorial has surprised\n\nthe Govemment of Denmark. In contrast to the map presented by\n\nthe Norwegian Government to the Storting, this sketch map\n\ndepicts a maritime boundary line between Iceland and Jan Mayen\n\nthat continues from the point where Kolbeinsey starts to affect\n\n- -\n\npublishedby the Ministryof ForeignAffairs, Oslo.912 and 1982 pa598, the line (point Cl on the sketch map on page 13) up to a point\n\non the median line between Greenland and Jan Mayen that\n\ncorresponds to latitude 70°12'04\"N, a latitude given by Nonvay\n\nin the Counter-Memorial. page 4, paragraph 15 (illustrated as\n\npoint Dl on the sketch map on page 13). This delimitation line\n\nseems to reflect a Nonvegian consent to Iceland's use of\n\nKolbeinsey as a basepoint.\n\n27. The Govemment of Denmark would thus appreciate if\n\nthe Govemment of Nonvay would disclose any agreement or\n\nunderstanding between Norway and Iceland which recognises\n\nKolbeinsey as an Icelandic basepoint and the date of such\n\nagreement or understanding. The Govemment of Denmark would\n\nfurther appreciate being informed of when the sketch map in\n\nAnnex 72 to the Counter-Memorial was produced and when it\n\nwas first released.\n\n28. In the Memorial the disputed area was defined on the\n\nbasis of information then known to the Government of Denmark.\n\nUpon receipt of the Counter-Memorial the Govemment of\n\nDenmark has noted that the Government of Norway does not\n\nclaim any maritime area south of the outer limit of the Icelandic\n\n200-mile economic zone as defined by Iceland (Le., giving full\n\neffect to the rock of Kolbeinsey) as part of the Nonvegian\n\nfishery zone around Jan Mayen, see page 4, paragraphs 14 - 15\n\nof the Counter-Memorial. The relevant segment of the 200-mile\n\nlimit as claimed by Iceland is shown in the sketch map on\n\npage 13 as the line B-Cl-Dl.\n\n29. As the Govemment of Norway has renounced al1\n\nclaims to the area south of the line B-Cl-Dl on the sketch map,\n\nthe area is not part of the dispute between the Parties presently\n\npending before the Court. The disputed area mus be redefined\n\naccordingly.\n\n30. Consequently, . the Govemment of Denmark\n\nrespectfully submits that the Court confines its decision to the\n\narea north of the line B-C,-D, on the sketch map above. The\n\nredefined disputed area is depicted as the triangular-shaped figureA-B-C,-Dl on Map V of this Reply. The relevant coordinates are\n\nlisted in the legend to Map V.\n\n31. Map V also incorporates the revised East Greenland\n\nbaseline established on the basis of the results of a\n\nhydrographiclgeodetic reconnaissance expedition canied out in\n\n1989, see the Memorial, page 9, note 1.' The northward\n\ntransposing of the southem border of the disputed area described\n\nabove does not necessitate any substantial modification of the\n\nrelevant area as defined in the Memonal, pages 11 - 12,\n\nparagraphs 30 - 35. In accordance with the notation applied\n\nabove, the relevant area is now defined as the geodetic polygon:\n\nA - E - the NW baseline of Jan Mayen -F -B - C, - Dl - G -\n\nthe relevant baseline of East Greenland- H, see Map V.\n\n32. On the basis of the results of the reconnaissance\n\nexpedition the relevant coastal front of Greenland (the geodesic\n\nGH) has now been computed to approximately 518 kilometres\n\nvis-à-vis the relevant coastal front of Jan Mayen (the geodesic\n\nFE) of approximately 54 kilometres. The ratio between the\n\nrelevant coastal fronts is thus reduced from 9.8:l to about 9.6:l\n\nin favour of Greenland, see the Memonal, page 96, paragraph\n\n297.\n\nB. History of the Dispute\n\n1. The Incident\n\n33. The Government of Norway finds it difficult to see\n\nhow the cntical situation which developed in the disputed area at\n\nthe end of August 1981, including the boarding by the\n\nNorwegian Coast Guard of two Danish fishing vessels, can be\n\ntermed an \"incident\", with the connotations attaching to that\n\nconcept in current diplomatic usage. Norway prefers to name the\n\nThe revised baselisshown in medium scale in Map VI1 insened on\n\ntheinside backcover of this VolThe.detailof the baseline are given in\n\nAnnex 58.situation a \"sequence of events\" (the Counter-Memorial, p. 75,\n\npara. 269).\n\n34. This expression is not adequate to describe the critical\n\nsituation which, within very few days, necessitated several\n\ncontacts, direct and indirect, between the Foreign Ministers of the\n\ntwo countries as well as meetings in Denmark at governmental\n\nlevel and consultations with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the\n\nDanish Parliament (Folketing), see the excerpt from a day-to-day\n\ndescription drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 16\n\nSeptember 1981 (Annex 59). Seen against this background, the\n\nterm \"incident\" is obviously a correct expression for the events.\n\n35. The senous character of the incident proved the\n\ndangers created by the absence of a clear junsdictional line in the\n\ndisputed area and has heen one of the factors prompting Denmark\n\nto seek a final solution of the delimitation dispute in accordance\n\nwith international law.\n\n2. Interim Arrangement\n\n36. The Memonal descnbes the mutual understanding\n\nreached in 1984 between Denmark and Norway on an interim\n\narrangement regarding monitoring of fishing for capelin (the\n\nMemonal, pp. 17 - 18, paras. 58 - 60).\n\n37. In the Counter-Memonal the Norwegian Government\n\ndisputes the correctness of the account of the issue given in the\n\nMemonal. It is stated that the understanding is \"alleged\", and the\n\ntext of this understanding is claimed to \"resemble\" an informal\n\npaper produced by the \"Danish\" side and rejected by Norway. It\n\nis also rnaintained that Norway at the time clearly stated that no\n\nunderstanding, forma1 or informal, would be acceptable (the\n\nCounter-Memorial, pp. 75 -76, paras. 270 - 272).\n\n38. The description in the Counter-Memorial is not\n\ncorrect. The facts are as follows. 39. The matter was discussed between Danish and\n\nNonvegian negotiators at meetings in Oslo on 6 January 1984\n\nand in Copenhagen on 4 June 1984. At the meeting in\n\nCopenhagen the Nonvegian side tabled a draft in the Nonvegian\n\nlanguage, dealing both with catch allocations to each of the\n\nParties and with the conduct of surveillance operations in the\n\ndisputed area. It was agreed at the meeting that the two items\n\nshould be dealt with in two separate papers, which were both\n\ntyped out dunng the meeting in the Danish language. The text of\n\nthe paper dealing with the conduct of surveillance operations was\n\nidentical to the Norwegian draft. It is this text translated into\n\nEnglish which is enclosed as Annex 13 to the Memonal and\n\nreferred to by Norway as a text resembling an informal paper\n\nproduced by the Danish side.\n\n40. At the meeting on 4 June 1984 the Parties agreed on\n\nsaid textad referendum.\n\n41. On 12 July 1984 the Nonvegian Foreign Ministry\n\ninformed the Danish Foreign Ministry that the Nonvegian\n\nauthorities would abide by the agreed temporary arrangement,of 4\n\nJune 1984 conceming the conduct of surveillance operations. It\n\nwas, however, the wish of Nonvay that the two Parties should\n\nconsider the arrangement as based on a tacit understanding, and\n\ninformation to the public would be limited to a statement by the\n\nNorwegian authorities to the effect that the Nonvegian Coast\n\nGuard would receive instructions aiming at avoiding episodes in\n\nthe disputed area. This was accepted by Denmark on 19 July\n\n1984 by a letter to the Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs of the\n\nNorwegian Foreign Ministry. The text of the understanding was\n\nattached to thatletter.\n\n3. Arbitration Negotiations\n\n42. The account given in the Counter-Memonal of the\n\nnegotiations between Denmark and Norway on having the\n\ndelimitation dispute settled by arbitration gives an incorrectdescription of the events (the Counter-Memorial. pp. 73 - 74,\n\nparas. 262 - 263). It is necessary to redress that description.\n\n43. At the meeting in Copenhagen on 7 - 8 April 1988 it\n\nwas agreed that the Danish delegation should draft a paper\n\ndescribing the elements to be included in an arbitration\n\nagreement. Such a paper - covering the composition of an\n\narbitration court, the questions tobe put to the court, as well as\n\nthe basis on which the arbitration court should make its decision\n\n- was sent to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 9\n\nMay 1988 and discussed at the meeting in Oslo on 20 May 1988\n\n(Annex 60). On al1 essential points Norway disagreed with the\n\nDanish suggestions.\n\n44. At the meeting in Copenhagen on 21 June 1988 the\n\nNonvegian delegation tabled two papers containing draft elements\n\nof an \"arbitration\" procedure (Annex 61). adding that the papers\n\ncould not be interpreted as reflecting the position of the\n\nNorwegian Govemment, see Danish conclusion résuméof the\n\nmeeting on 21 June 1988 (Annex 62).\n\n45. In the view of both delegations, the lengthy and\n\ncomplicated procedure suggested by Nonvay would extend over\n\nseveral years and was to be followed by further negotiations.\n\nThis procedure did not satisfy the Danish wish for a final\n\nsolution of thedispute within a reasonable time.\n\n46. This was made unequivocally clear to the Norwegian\n\ndelegation at the meeting on 21 June 1988. At the conclusion.of\n\nthe meeting the Dgnish delegation stated that the matter would be\n\nsubmitted to the Government for evaluation on the basis of the\n\nlatest developments and for consideration of the possibilities to\n\nmake progress in the matter, either through negotiation or judicial\n\nsettlement by arbitration or by the International Court of Justice\n\n(Annex 62). The alleged Norwegian understanding that contact\n\nbetween the Parties with a view to further exploration of the\n\npossibility of agreement on the procedures for judicial settlement\n\nwas still in progress subsequent to this meeting, cannot be based\n\non the Danish response to the Norwegian proposal. For anyonepresent at the meeting it was clear that the time for further\n\nnegotiations between the Parties on these issues had come to an\n\nend. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that contrary to\n\nnormal practice, no further meetings were scheduled at the end of\n\nthe meeting on 21 June 1988.\n\n47. The Government of Denmark regarded a unilateral\n\nsubmission of the dispute to the International Court of Justice as\n\nthe only way to secure a final and binding solution of the dispute\n\nwithin a foreseeable future, and as a step which Denmark was\n\nfully entitled to take as a matter of law.\n\n48. The Norwegian assertion that the penod 1980 - 1988\n\ncan be split up into \"Formal Negotiations 1980 - 1983\" and\n\n\"Further Contacts 1983 - 1988\" (the Counter-Memorial, pp. 73 -\n\n74, paras. 256 - 265). is nothing but a semantic exercise. Dunng\n\nthe negotiations in Oslo on 20 May 1988 and in Copenhagen on\n\n21 June 1988. concrete documents were submitted and discussed.\n\n49. According to Article 40 of the Statute of the Court, a\n\ncase can be brought before the Court either by special agreement\n\nbetween the parties or by unilateral application by one party. In\n\nthis case, the experience gained by Denmark from eight years of\n\nfmitless negotiation -including finally the rejection by Norway of\n\n'the Danish proposa1 concerning the elements of an arbitration\n\nagreement, and the contents of the Nonvegian counter-proposa1 -\n\ncould only lead to the conclusion that it would not be possible to\n\ncome to lems with Norway on the contents of a special\n\nagreement. Consequently, the Government of Denmark chose to\n\nsubmit its Application to the International Court of Justice on 16\n\nAugust 1988.\n\n50. This ought not to have caused any surprise to Norway\n\nconsidering both the negative result of the negotiations as well as\n\nthe fact that Nonvay, when accepting the compulsory jurisdiction\n\nof the International Court of Justice in conformity with Article\n\n36, paragraph 2, of the Statute by its Declaration of 2 April\n\n1976, had added the following reservation to its acceptance: \"...the Royal Nonvegian Government, having regard to\n\nArticle 95 of the Charter of the United Nations, reserves\n\nthe nght at any time to amend the scope of this Decla-\n\nration in the light of the results of the Third United\n\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea in respect of\n\nthe settlement of disputes.\" (See Doc. ST/LEG/SER.E/8\n\nMultilateral Treaties deposited with the Secretary\n\nGeneral. Status as at 31 December 1989).\n\n51. This reservation would have allowed Norwayto limit\n\nor withdraw, at any moment, its acceptance of the compulsory\n\njurisdiction of the Court, theieby extinguishing the last possibility\n\nfor Denmark to obtain a final judicial solution of the present\n\ndelimitation dispute.\n\nC. Jan Mayen\n\n1. General Descriptionof Jan Mayen\n\n52. In the Counter-Memonal, Norway has taken exception\n\nto the way in which Denmark has described Jan Mayen. Norway\n\nfinds that Denmark has \"rather deprecatingly characterized\" Jan\n\nMayen as \"an oceanic volcanic island ...a desolate island ...and\n\nas an isolated island\" (the Counter-Mernorial, p. 133, para. 444).\n\nThe use of the term \"isolated\" is felt to be \"gratuitously\n\npejorative\", (ihid.,p. 143, para. 482) and Denmark is said to \"...\n\nmake play with adjectives such as \"desolate\" and \"uninhabited\" ...\"\n\n(ihid.,p. 189, para. 675). Denmark would respectfully point out\n\nthat al1 these terms are commonly used in descriptions of Jan\n\nMayen, not least by Norwegians themselves. Some examples will\n\nserve to illustrate this point and to refute the Nonvegian attempt\n\nto discredit the scientific integrity which Denmark has sought to\n\nmaintain in its pleadings before the Court. \"...the Royal Nonvegian Government, having regard to\n\nArticle 95 of the Charter of the United Nations, reserves\n\nthe nght at any time to amend the scope of this Decla-\n\nration in the light of the results of the Third United\n\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea in respect of\n\nthe settlement of disputes.\" (See Doc. ST/LEG/SER.E/8\n\nMultilateral Treaties deposited with the Secretary\n\nGeneral. Status as at 31 December 1989).\n\n51. This reservation would have allowed Norwayto limit\n\nor withdraw, at any moment, its acceptance of the compulsory\n\njurisdiction of the Court, theieby extinguishing the last possibility\n\nfor Denmark to obtain a final judicial solution of the present\n\ndelimitation dispute.\n\nC. Jan Mayen\n\n1. General Descriptionof Jan Mayen\n\n52. In the Counter-Memonal, Norway has taken exception\n\nto the way in which Denmark has described Jan Mayen. Norway\n\nfinds that Denmark has \"rather deprecatingly characterized\" Jan\n\nMayen as \"an oceanic volcanic island ...a desolate island ...and\n\nas an isolated island\" (the Counter-Mernorial, p. 133, para. 444).\n\nThe use of the term \"isolated\" is felt to be \"gratuitously\n\npejorative\", (ihid.,p. 143, para. 482) and Denmark is said to \"...\n\nmake play with adjectives such as \"desolate\" and \"uninhabited\" ...\"\n\n(ihid.,p. 189, para. 675). Denmark would respectfully point out\n\nthat al1 these terms are commonly used in descriptions of Jan\n\nMayen, not least by Norwegians themselves. Some examples will\n\nserve to illustrate this point and to refute the Nonvegian attempt\n\nto discredit the scientific integrity which Denmark has sought to\n\nmaintain in its pleadings before the Court. 53.\n\nThis is a standard geological term, and is used of Jan\n\nMayen in the most comprehensive published account of Jan\n\nMayen geology, that by the Icelandic geologist P. Imsland (Rit\n\nVisindafélag islendinga 43, Reykjavik 1984). which begins on\n\npage 11 with the following words: \"Oceanic volcanic islandsfa11\n\ninto three major groups ...\" and continues 14 lines later: \"Jan\n\nMayen falls into this third group\". Other oceanic volcanic islands\n\nplaced in this third group by P. Imsland are Gough Island,\n\nRéunion, Easter Island and Bouvet Island, the last annexed by\n\nNorway in 1928. Some of these islands are desolate and\n\nuninhabited, others are pleasant places to live on.\n\n54. How the use of the term \"oceanic volcanic island\" can\n\nbe \"deprecating\" in a paragraph descnbing the geology of Jan\n\nMayen is beyond comprehension. NATO's Fifeen Nations, April\n\n- May 1978 contains the following description in an article by\n\nEllrnann Ellingsen (Jan Mayen in Norwegian Security Policy): \"It\n\nis of volcanic origin ..Beerenberg, the volcano of 2,277 metres,\n\ncovers large parts of North Jan Mayen. It had its last eniption in\n\n1970, when the island was evacuated for a short time.\"\n\n55. The. description of Jan Mayen by W. Werenskiold in\n\nA Geography of Norden (A. Somme (editor), Oslo 1960) begins\n\nwith the following words: \"Jan Mayen is a desolate island\". In an\n\narticle published in Annuaire Français de Droit International,\n\n1980, page 711, Judge J. Evensen gives a description of Jan\n\nMayen containing inter alia the following phrases: \"Jan Mayen is\n\nin almost al1 respects an inhospitable island. The flora there is\n\npoor. No tree grows there ...\".4\n\n' Originaltext: \"JanMayenestàpresquetous égards,une île inhospitalière.\n\nLa flore y est pauvre.Aucun arbren'y pou...\"\n\n22 56. In the Counter-Memorial, one finds the words \"Jan\n\nMayen stands in isolation\" and \"an isolated island like Jan\n\nMayen\" (p. 186, para. 665, and p. 191, para. 685). In these days\n\nof helicopters and short take off and landing aircraft, many parts\n\nof the world are geographically isolated yet accessible. The\n\nCounter-Mernorial fails to distinguish between isolation and\n\ninaccessibility, and has assumed that Denmark has done the sarne.\n\n57. Nomay Information, published by the Royal\n\nNorwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, January 1982, describes\n\nJan Mayen as follows: \"There are no bushes and trees and no\n\nbays sheltered from the open sea ..Access to Jan Mayen is\n\nseason-limited and difficult because of the climate and lack of\n\nharbours .The barren, unproductive landscape of Jan Mayen and\n\nits severe climate provides no basis whatsoever for industry of\n\nany kind\". The above-mentioned article in AnnuaireFrançais de\n\nDroit International, 1980, page 711, by Judge J. Evensen,\n\ncontains the following phrase: \"Jan Mayen has no natural\n\nharbours or other harbours\".' In NATO's FrfieenNations, April -\n\nMay 1978, it is also mentioned that \"There is no harbour on the\n\nisland.supplies from the sea are therefore today put ashore by\n\nfloats and dories.\" In the same article it is stated that the\n\nGovemor of Svalbard, who holds the chief administrative\n\nresponsibility for Jan Mayen, has only visited the island once.\n\n2. The Relevance of Geology and Geomorphology\n\n58. Denmark had not expected that geology and\n\ngeomorphology would be an issue in the present case, and had\n\nhoped that the Court would not have to concem itself greatly\n\nwith these matters. Unfortunately, Nonvay has chosen othenvise\n\nand has attempted to discredit Denmark's presentation of the facts\n\nconceming geology and geomorphology. However, in its\n\n'Original text: \"JanMayen n'a pasde pons naturels ou autres.\"eagerness to achieve this end, Nonvay has overlooked or\n\nmisunderstood several passages in the Memorial. This will be\n\ndemonstrated in the following paragraphs.\n\n59. In the Counter-Memorial, the paragraphs on geology\n\nin the Memorial are characterised as \"...in form at least,\n\ndescriptive, but in the result they produce highly tendentious\n\nevaluation...\" (the Counter-Memonal, p. 171, para. 601). As\n\nevidence of tendentiousness the following sentence from page 40,\n\nparagraph 158 in the Memorial is quoted:\n\n\"As for the shelf margin to the West of the Ridge and\n\nsouth of 70°N, this is within 50 nautical miles of the\n\naxis of the Ridge, i.e. more than 200 nautical miles from\n\nthe east coast of Greenland.\"\n\nThe words \"and south of 70°N\" were not emphasised in the\n\noriginal, as it was not thought that the sentence could be\n\nmisunderstood, least ofal1 in its original context.\n\n60. The facts are that in the maritime areaouth of 70°N\n\nand West of the Jan Mayen Ridge, the Ridge is flanked by an\n\noceanic basin floored by oceanic cmst and more than 2,000\n\nmetres deep, see Map on page 39 in the Memonal and Profile 2\n\non page 30 in the Counter-Memonal. The maximum westerly\n\nposition of thegeomorphologic shelf margin of Jan Mayen here\n\ncannot lie farther West than the axis of this basin, i.e., the line\n\nwhere the ocean floor ceases to slope away from the Ridge and\n\ninstead begins to slope towards it. This basin axis is more than\n\n200 nautical miles from the east coast of Greenland. It appears\n\nthat Norway has included this oceanic basin in the \"Jan Mayen\n\nshelf' (see pp. 27 - 28, para. 69 below). No claim is made by\n\nDenmark that the geologically/geomorpholo gifnelly\n\ncontinental margin of East Greenland lies farther east than the\n\naxis of the adjacent oceanic basins.\n\n61. As for the area West of Jan Mayen and north of\n\n70°N, this is described on page 40, paragraph 158 in the\n\nMemorial as follows: \"However, it should be noted that in the maritime area\n\nWestof Jan Mayen and north of approximately 70°N, the\n\nsea floor topography is rough, and terms like continental\n\nrise, slope and shelf break are not applicable in this\n\narea.\"\n\nThe word \"rough\" is commonly used in descriptions of sea floor\n\nmorphology where volcanic ridges, seamounts and plateaus\n\n(guyots) rise from the ocean floor. The word was chosen here\n\nbecause the area in question was labelled \"zone of rough\n\ntopography\" in a paper published in a Norwegian journal and\n\nwith a Norwegian as first author (Grgnlie, G., Chapman, M. &\n\nTalwani, M. Norsk PolarinsrirutrSkrifter Nr. 170, Oslo 1979, fig.\n\n2, p. 28). Map III in the Counter-Memorial is simplified so much\n\nthat the character of this area is not apparent.\n\n62. Frorn the wording of paragraph 602, page 171, and\n\nparticularly paragraph 603, pages 171 - 172, in the Counter-\n\nMemorial it would appear that the sentence from paragraph 158\n\nof the Memorial quoted in the paragraph above has been\n\noverlooked. The Memorial makes no attempt to interpret or\n\nconceal the data, or to detect the location of the Jan Mayen shelf\n\nmargin north of 70°N. What the Memorial is trying to convey is\n\nthat it is doubtful whether a continental shelf, as normally\n\nunderstood by geologists and geomorphologists, can be said to\n\nexist in the area between 70°N and the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone\n\nto the north.\n\n63. On page 172, paragraph 604 of the Counter-\n\nMernorial, it is stated that the bathymetry contradicts the\n\nMernorial. As an example it is implied that the Memorial\n\nsuggests that the Jan Mayen continental shelf is cut off to the\n\nsouth. The Memorial does not discuss how and where the shelf\n\nends to the south or if there is a continental margin in this\n\ndirection. It is merely remarked that the depth of the top of the\n\nridge increases to about 1,000 metres at a point about 150\n\nnautical miles south of the southwestern tip of the island. Thiscan be supplemented by the following quotations from papers by\n\nNorwegian authors:\n\n\"Physiographically, the Jan Mayen Ridge is a flat-\n\ntopped north-south trending ridge extending southwards\n\nfrom the island of Jan Mayen. ...At 69\"N the ridge\n\ntrend changes towards the south-west. The ridge breaks\n\nup into a regime of individual seamounts at about\n\n68.5\"N with no harhymerric relief south of 67.6'N.\"\n\n(Myhre, A.M., Eldholm, O. & Sundvor, E. Polar\n\nReseorch Vol. 2 n.s., Oslo 1984, p. 47; emphasis added)\n\n\"The Jan Mayen Ridge block, which becomes\n\nfragmented south of 68.S0N, loses its bathymetric\n\nsignature south of 67.6ONU(Eldholm, O., Skogseid, J.,\n\nSundvor, E. & Myhre, A.M. Geology of Norrh Americo\n\nVol. L, 1990, p. 356).\n\nIn other words, Norwegian geoscientists seem to be in no doubt\n\nthat the Ridge ends to the south.\n\n64. Perhaps it has been overlooked in the Counter-\n\nMemorial that it is the.Jan Mayen Ridge, and not the continental\n\nshelf and margin, that is described in the relevant sentence on\n\npage 38, paragraph 158 of the Memorial. The Memorial does not\n\ndiscuss the southern extent of the Jan Mayen shelf, because it is\n\nthe maritime boundary between Greenland and Jan Mayen that is\n\nin dispute, not that between lceland and Jan Mayen.\n\n65. In any case page 172, paragraph 604 of the Counter-\n\nMemorial is illogical. The Kolbeinsey Ridge lies to the West of\n\nthe Jan Mayen Ridge, not to the south. How the Jan Mayen\n\nRidge ends to the south has nothing to do with how it might or\n\nmight not be connected to Kolbeinsey Ridge to the West. The\n\nwestern extent of the Jan Mayen Ridge and shelf has already\n\nbeen discussed above on pages 24 - 25, paragraphs 60 -62.\n\n66. Turning now to the description of geology and\n\ngeomorphology in the Counter-Memorial (pp. 18 - 19 and pp. 28 - 31, paras. 60 - 67 and 102 - 109), two comments are called\n\nfor.\n\n67. The first is that Norway has not taken care always to\n\ndistinguish between facts and opinions. This can be exemplified\n\nby the remark on page 19, paragraph 62, (see also p. 28, para.\n\n104) that \"Jan Mayen is a landmass which is situated on a ridge\n\nof continental crust\". This is an opinion, not a statement of\n\nscientific fact, and it is an opinion that is not greatly favoured in\n\nthe scientific community. The matter is discussed fully in a\n\nmonograph on the volcanic rocks of Jan Mayen by the Icelandic\n\ngeologist P. Imsland (Rif Visindafélagislendinga 43, Reykjavik\n\n1984, 332 pp.), in which one finds the following statement:\n\n\"Gronlie et al. (1979) believe the continental segment in\n\nthe Jan Mayen ndge to end somewhere about 50 km\n\nsouth of Jan Mayen island. All this [the foregoing\n\nparagraphs in Imsland's monograph] points to the\n\nabsence of a continental rock segment under Jan Mayen\"\n\n(p. 303). (The author Gronlie referred to by P. Imsland\n\nis the Norwegian geoscientist Gisle Grf~nlie.)\n\n68. In a recently published account of the geology of the\n\nNorwegian-Greenland Sea by four Norwegian scientists the island\n\nof Jan Mayen is shown as being situated on oceanic crust, with\n\ncontinental crust first occurring under the subrnerged Jan Mayen\n\nRidge to the south- (see Figure 5 on p. 359 in Eldholm, O.,\n\nSkogseid, J., Sundvor, E. & Myhre, A.M. Geology of North\n\nAmerica, Vol. L, 1990). This is how the situation is described in\n\nparagraph 203 of the Memorial.\n\n69. The second comment is more important and concems\n\nthe Norwegian use of the term \"continental shelf'. While\n\nDenmark, in paragraphs describing geology and geomorphology,\n\nhas consistently used this term as it is understood in these\n\nsciences, Norway uses the term in the geological sense when\n\nreferring fo the East Greenland shelf, but in some other sense\n\nwhen referring to the Jan Mayen shelf. This, in a section on\n\ngeology, can result in rather confused statements such as thatintroducing paragraph 109, page 31 in the Counter-Memorial: \"As\n\nhas been noted, the Kolbeinsey Axis projects northeastwards on\n\nthe central portion of the continental shelf between Jan Mayen\n\nand Greenland...\". Since the Kolbeinsey Ridge (or Axis) is a\n\ntypical mid-oceatiic ridge with associated rift (see for example p.\n\n29, para. 104 of the Counter-Memorial), the sentence quoted is,\n\nscientifically speaking, a contradiction in terms.\n\n70. The above should be borne in mind when reading\n\nreferences in the Counter-Mernorial to \"the Jan Mayen shelf ...\n\ntowards the west\" (p. 29, para. 106). \"the western pari of the Jan\n\nMayen continental.shelf' (p. 29, para. 107). \"the shelf to the West\n\nof Jan Mayen\" (p. 50, para. 159). Until Norway defines what it\n\nmeans by the Jan Mayen shelf in each context, these references\n\nto the shelf can lead to ambiguity.\n\n71. In summary, the Memorial presents a correct, albeit\n\nbrief, description of the maritime area between Greenland and Jan\n\nMayen, using terms as they are understood in the sciences of\n\ngeology and geomorphology.

General Remarks\n\n72. The Norwegian activities in the North Atlantic region\n\nare descnbed at great length in the Counter-Memorial, particularly\n\nin Pan 1, Chapter 1 and Appendices 2 - 5. A detailed account is\n\ngiven of the Norwegian activities in the north, south, east, and\n\nWest of this region, but only a small part of the information\n\nsubmitted by Norway concerns the disputed area or even the area\n\nrelevant to the present delimitation as defined by Denmark in the\n\nMemorial, pages 11 - 12, paragraphs 30 - 35. Historical aspects\n\nof Norwegian fishing and particularly sealing as well as the\n\nNorwegian exploitation of a number of resources that are far removed from the area in dispute are addressed extensively in the\n\nCounter-Memorial.\n\n73. The present case, however, centres around\n\n- the relevant coasts of East Greenland and Jan Mayen,\n\n-\n\na certain geographical area between East Greenland and Jan\n\nMayen (the relevant area as illustrated on Map V of this\n\nReply),\n\n- a certain period, i.e., from 1979 until the present proceed-\n\nings, which is the only period when competing claims have\n\nbeen made to the maritime area in question, and\n\n- the actual and potential exploitation of economic resources in\n\nthe relevant area, i.e., primarily capelin fishing, as no\n\nexploitation of possible sea-bed resources has so far taken\n\nplace or is likely to take place in the foreseeable future.\n\n74. A striking feature in the Counter-Memorial is the\n\napparent reluctance to address these essential issues of relevant\n\ncoasts, relevant area, relevant period and relevant resources.\n\n75. The Norwegian effort is instead directed towards de-\n\npicting Norway as a major power in the North Atlantic region\n\ndating back from the time of the VikingsPJorsemen, canying out\n\nactivities in almost al1 quarters of the region, thereby claiming a\n\npredominant and legitimate interest in, inter alio, the Jan Mayen\n\nregion. These activities are then alleged to be opposable to\n\nneighbouring countries, in the present case to Greenland. But how\n\ncould an expansive Norwegian maritime policy in the North\n\nAtlantic region in general be opposable to Greenland as far as\n\nthe area West of Jan Mayen is concerned, where activities\n\nrelevant for the present case, Le., capelin fishing, started as late\n\nas in 1978 and have been the subject of interest of hoth parties?\n\nThe answer is of course that it cannot. 76. Norway, in al1 fairness, does not claim any historical\n\nrights in the relevant area. Indeed, such rights would be\n\nimpossible for Norway to substantiate, a fact recognised by a\n\nmember of the Norwegian Parliament during the debate on the\n\n1980 Icelandic-Norwegian Agreement on 6 June 1980: \"In fact\n\nthere is no tradition of Norwegian fishing off Jan Mayen\", see\n\nRecords of the Parliamentary Debate on 6 June 1980 on\n\nRecomrnendation No. 318 (1979 - 1980) to the Storting (Annex\n\nII to the Counter-Memorial, p. 44). It may nevertheless be\n\nappropriate briefly to state the general position of international\n\nlaw with respect to historical rights.\n\n77. Land territory may be terra nullius and as such\n\nsubject to acquisition. It is generally recognised that a State's\n\nactivities withinsuch territory can form part of the basis for a\n\nclaim of sovereign rights or other rights to the territory whether\n\nin cornpetition or not with clairns from other States whose\n\nactivities have been less intensive.\n\n78. As regards the high seas, the situation is different.\n\nThe high seas outside territorial waters were until recently\n\nconsidered to be res communis and could be used by al1 States\n\nand their citizens on an equal basis. A State's activities, however\n\nlong they have lasted, could not form the basis for any special\n\nrights in relation to particular parts of the high seas, and certainly\n\nnot the basis for an assertion of exclusive, sovereign rights.\n\n79. This is true also as far as such parts of the high seas\n\nare concerned that now form part of the present broad maritime\n\nzones established in accordance with international law as it has\n\nsubsequently developed. The basis for the exclusive rights of\n\ncoastal States to such zones lies in their mere existence as\n\ncoastal States. The previous activities of the coastal State in the\n\narea are of no consequence, and the right of the coastal State to\n\na broad maritime zone is unaffected by activities previously\n\ncarried out within the zone area by other States.\n\n80. It seems equally clear that a delimitarion of maritime\n\nzones outside territorial waters on the basis of international law between opposite Statesare not affected by the previous activities\n\nof the States concerned, however long-lasting, in the zones to be\n\ndelimited. Such activities do not constitute a 'relevant\n\ncircumstance to be taken into account by an international court in\n\ndeciding the course of a boundary line. This does not, however,\n\nhinder the parties concerned from seeking a negotiated\n\narrangement as a supplement to the delimitation, involving a\n\n\"phasing out\" of, inter alia. traditional fishery according to the\n\nprinciples underlying proposais discussed at the Second\n\nConference on the Law of the Sea, 1960, and later implemented\n\nin the Fisheries Convention of 9 March 1964 (the European\n\nFisheries Convention). An example is provided by the\n\nDanish-Swedish Delimitation Agreement of 9 November 1984\n\nwhere the median line between Sweden and the Danish island of\n\nBornholm was supplemented by a Protocol concerning the\n\nphasing out of Danish fishery on the Swedish side of the\n\nboundary, provisionally for a IO-year period (Annex 33 to the\n\nMemorial).\n\n81. Norwegian expansionist activities in the North Atlantic\n\nregion have forced Denmark to challenge their legality on a\n\nprevious occasion. In the early 1930s. these activities had reached\n\na point where Norway felt justified in claiming part of East\n\nGreenland for Norway under the name of a Norwegian Viking\n\n(Eirik Raude's Land). This provocative act prom~ted Denmark to\n\nunilaterally institute proceedings against Nonvay before the\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice without consultin-\n\nNorway as to the appropriateness of such a step. Denmark has\n\nfelt justified in taking a similar step in the present case to seek\n\njudicial recognition of Greenland's right to a 200-mile fishery\n\nzone and continental shelf zone vis-à-vis the island of Jan\n\nMayen. In passing, it may be noted that the area in dispute is\n\nsituated off that part of the Coast of East Greenland (the area\n\nbetween latitudes 71°30' and 75'40' N) which Norway attempted\n\nto take possession of in 1931after having annexed Jan Mayen in\n\n1929.\n\n82. It is generally recognised that heavy dependence on\n\nfisheries may be a relevant factor under international law as faras territories like Greenland are concerned. Reference is made to\n\nthe Resolution adopted on 26 April 1958 inconnection with the\n\nConvention of 29 April 1958 on Fishing and Conservation of the\n\nLiving Resources of the High Seas (Official Records, Vol. II,\n\nDoc. AICONF 13/38, p. 144). By that Resolution Greenland,\n\ntogether with the Faroe Islands and Iceland, was recognised as\n\noverwhelmingly dependent upon fisheries for its livelihood and\n\neconomic development (the Mernorial, p. 98, para. 305).\n\n83. This is far from being the case of Norway. Figures\n\nquoted in the Counter-Memorial, page II, paragraph 39, reveal\n\nthat fisheries account for only a very small percentage of\n\nNonvay's total export value (approximately 4 per cent. in 1985,\n\nsee p. 38 - 39, para. 102, note 9, below), although this fact has\n\nbeen somewhat disguised in the Norwegian presentation of the\n\nfigures. In 1989, the corresponding figure for Greenland was 78\n\nper cent. And even more relevant in the case presently pending\n\nbefore the Court, Jan Mayen -having no population in the usual\n\nsense of the word and no economic life - is not at al1 dependent\n\non fisheries.\n\n84. Norway has emphasised that the capelin resource of\n\nthe disputed area is not fished by Greenland vessels. This is\n\ncorrect, and the reasons for Greenland's present exploitation of\n\nthe capelin resource through issuance of fishing licences to third\n\nState vessels against payment are given below on pages 58 - 60,\n\nparagraphs 142 - 149. It is a method of exploitation of off-shore\n\nresources commonly used by developing States. How Greenland\n\nis exploiting the capelin resource at present is, however,\n\nimmaterial to the present delimitation of the maritime zones.\n\nGreenland's right to an extension of the fishery zone to 200\n\nmiles is based on a rule of customary international law that has\n\nbeen expressed in the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. A\n\nState's application of this rule does not depend upon the\n\nexistence of any particular resource within such a zone, nor is it\n\nconditional on the capacity of the State itself to exploit the\n\nresources of the zone. Article 62 of the 1982 Convention on the\n\nLaw of the Sea explicitly recognises that a coastal State may not\n\nhave the capacity to harvest the entire resources of its 200-milezone. In this situation the coastal State must give other States\n\naccess to reap any surplus living resource. The coastal State\n\nexercises the right to exploit the living resources within the200-\n\nmile zone either by domestic fishing vessels or by licence\n\narrangements with third States. As a corollary to that right, the\n\nState is obliged, through proper conservation and management\n\nmeasures, to ensure that the maintenance of the living resources\n\nin the zone is not endangered by over-exploitation.\n\n85. The concept of th? 200-mile zone does not depend\n\nupon ocrual or full exploitation of the resources of the zone by\n\nthe coastal State nor does the delimitation of that zone. The\n\nconcept recognises the right of the coastal State to its future\n\neconomic potential, either through the gradua1 expansion of a\n\ndomestic fishing fleet, or through licensing of foreign fishing\n\nvessels. The Norwegian comment that the Greenland population is\n\nlargely concentrated on the West Coast is thus irrelevant (the\n\nCounter-Mernorial, p. 175, para. 616). For the population of\n\nGreenland, every single part of ils coast and the adjacent sea is\n\nof importance both to the suwival of the population and to\n\npreserving ils cultural roots. Thus the nonheast coast has been\n\nthe site of many settlements throughout the ages and no one\n\nknows which part of Greenland and its surrounding sea may be\n\nthe next to prosper. Even if Greenland at present does not itself\n\ncatch the capelin in the disputed area but exploits this resource\n\nthrough the issuance of licences to third State vessels, this merely\n\nreflects the current priorities of Greenland's administration of its\n\nfishing resources, but by no means an absence of Greenland\n\ninterest in the resources of the area.\n\n86. Greenland derives an important income from the\n\nissuance of fishing licences to third State vessels under the ten\n\nyear Fishery Agreement with the EEC, see below page 50,\n\nparagraphs 126 - 127. Full exploitation of the living resources,\n\nhowever, must not be pursued at the expense of a proper\n\nmaintenance of the ecological balance. In the relevant area the\n\nexistence of an ample capelin stock is particularly important, as\n\nthe capelin constitutes the main food resource forseals and larger\n\nfish in the area. Greenland's interest in the disputed area isconcerned with the conservation as much as with the exploitation\n\nof the capelin resource.\n\n2. Specific Comments on Map 1in the Counter-Mernorial\n\n87. The Govemment of Denmark wishes to point out that\n\nMap I \"Human Settlement and Norwegian Hunting and Fishing\n\nGrounds\" in the Counter-Memorial, gives a distorted picture of\n\nhabitation, hunting, and fishing patterns, both with respect tothe\n\ntime period and the geographic locations coveredby the M~P.~\n\n88. First ofall, the Map does not give any indication of\n\nwhich date or period it relates to. According to the Counter-\n\nMemorial, page 7, paragraph 21 and the legend to Map 1, the\n\nMap demonstrates \"the persistent pattern\" of settlement and\n\nNorwegian hunting and fishing grounds.\n\n89. According to the Map legend, the red spots mark\n\n\"land use involving 10 people or more within a radius of 2\n\nkilometres\". It must be pointed out that a number of inhabited\n\nplaces in Greenland which satisfy this criterion are not included.\n\nThe following examples are striking.\n\n90. In North-West Greenland in the municipality of\n\nAvanersuaq the Savissivik settlement on Meteorite Island, midway\n\nbetween Cape York and Cape Melville, has 116 inhabitants, and\n\nthe settlement Qeqertat at the head of Inglefield Broad has 31\n\ninhabitants. The settlements Moriusaq with 73 inhabitants and\n\nQeqertarsuaq with 17 inhabitants, both settlements established\n\naround 1950, are not included on the Map. In the East Greenland\n\nmunicipality of Taasiilaq the settlements lsortoq with 180\n\ninhabitants as of 1 January 1990, and Sermiligaaq with 182 in-\n\nhabitants as of 1 January 1990, are not included.\n\nVn orderto enablethe Court to aegeneralknowledgeon thehistoryand\n\nculture of Greenland the atlas Kalaallit Nunaof Green1990,has been\n\ndepositedin 20 copieswith the Registrarof the Court.\n\n34 91. The omission of these inhabited places mentioned here\n\ncannot be due to the scale of the Map, nor to overlap with red\n\nmarks already on the Map as the settlements mentioned are\n\nsituated in isolation from existing red marks on the Map.\n\n92. Furthermore, the criterion \"Land use involving 10\n\npeople or more within a radius of 2 kilometres\" is not suitable to\n\nGreenland conditions. The Greenland population lives mainly in\n\ntowns and settlements, but especially in the hunting regions of\n\nEast and Northwest Greenland a significant portion of the\n\npopulation is semi-nomadic during the summer - a pattern which\n\nhas prevailed for centuries. In the hunting and fishing temtory -\n\nfiords, highlands, mountain Stream valleys and bird cliff areas -\n\nnumerous summer settlements are used by 10 people or more,\n\nwho exploit an area around the settlement larger than four\n\nkilometres in diameter. According to the legend, these settlements\n\nare qualified to a red mark on the Map. In the view of the\n\nGovernment of Denmark these numerous periodic settlements\n\nshould have been included on theMap. This would have shown\n\na remarkable increase in the number of red spots on Greenland's\n\nland territory.\n\n93. One could of course also sketch a Map with the\n\ncriterion 30 people or more within a radius of 25 kilometres in\n\nwhich case al1 the red spots and many more on Greenland's\n\nterritory would appear on the Map whereas the red spots on Jan\n\nMayen and Bear Island would disappear.\n\n94. The marks on the Map indicating Nonvegian hunting\n\ngrounds at sea are similarly incorrect. The four whale signs off\n\nthe West Coast of Greenland do not satisfy \"the persistent\n\npattern\" criterion that seems to have been adopted by Norway, as\n\nNorwegian whaling in the West Greenland fishery zoneended in\n\n1985. The four whale signs within the East Greenland fishery\n\nzone south of Kangerlussuaq are also incorrect, as the Greenland\n\nHome Rule Authority issued its last permit for Nonvegian\n\nwhaling inside the East Greenland fishery zone in 1985. Finally,\n\nwhen considering the four seal symbols off the East Coast of\n\nGreenland, it should be noted that permission for Nonvegian sealhunting inside the East Greenland fishery zone was last granted\n\nby the Greenland Home Rule Authority in 1988.\n\n95. If the Map presented by Nonvay is intended to reflect\n\npresent-day reality, discontinued activities should not be included\n\nas they give the impression that the areas indicated are\n\n\"Nonvegian hunting grounds\". They are not. The Norwegian\n\nwhaling and sealing activities in question belong to history.\n\n96. As regards the marks on the Map for fishing activities\n\noff the West and East Coast of Greenland it must be pointed out\n\nthat since January 1977 Norwegian fishing activity has been\n\ndependent on negotiated access to the Greenland zone. The\n\ncurrent Nonvegian access, mainly to the East Coast of Greenland,\n\nis further described below, pages 50 -51, paragraphs 128 - 130.\n\nE. The Greenland Economy and Fisheries Sector\n\n1.

After having sustained a considerable trade deficit for years, Greenland produced its first trade surplus in 1989\n\namounting to USD 22 milli~n.~\n\n99. Table 1 illustrates that the 1989 trade surplus was\n\ncaused by an increase in export value and a considerable decrease\n\nin the volume of imports.\n\nTABLE 1 Greenland's Trade Balance.

The reduction in the value of imported goods is a\n\nconsequence of austerity measures introduced by the Home Rule\n\nAuthority in 1988; measures whose full effect was not felt until\n\n1989. The export increase may be ascribed to two equally\n\nimportant factors, pnce increases, in particular for zinc ore, and a\n\nquantitativerise in exported goods, particularly cod and cod\n\nproducts.\n\n'\n\nThroughout the Reply. figures in Danish Kroner havebeen converted into\n\nUS dollars at the rate of exchange employed in the Memonal. namely the\n\nkroner 772.25.prevailing on I lune 1989 when 100 US dollars equalled Danish\n\nVn comparison with Table 11,p. 44 in the Danish Memonal the impon\n\nfigures and consequently the deficit figures for1987 and 1988 have\n\nbeen altered on the hasis of new information made available by the Danish\n\nBureau of Statistics. 101. 1989 may be the last year within the foreseeable\n\nfuture in which Greenland will enjoy a trade surplus. As has\n\nbeen demonstrated in the Memorial, page 43, Table 1,\n\nGreenland's exports consist almost exclusively of unprocessed or\n\nsemi-processed natural resources. Thus, the basis of Greenland's\n\neconomy is in principle exhaustible and, at any rate, inherently\n\nunstable. The availability and exploitability of Greenland's natural\n\nresources depends to a large extent on extemal factors beyond the\n\ncontrol of man, such as climate, migratory patterns of marine\n\nspecies and viable accessibility ofmineral deposits. Despite the\n\ntrade surplus of 1989, the prospects for the Greenland economy\n\nare bleak, and it is expected that the next few years will expose\n\nthe vulnerability of an economy based exclusively on natural\n\nresources.\n\nTABLE II Composition of Greenland Exports Trade in 1987 -\n\n1989.

In comparison, the Norwegian fish\n\nexports represented approximately 4 per cent. of the total\n\nNorwegian export value in 1985, see the Counter-Memorial, pages 10 - 11, paragraph 39.9In 1989, the Norwegian figurehad\n\nrisen to 5.5 per cent. of the total export of goods.I0\n\n103. Greenland's only other important export commodity,\n\nzinc ore and other minerals, represenied 18 per cent. of the total\n\nvalue of Greenland exports in 1989, see Table II above. The last\n\nactive mine in Greenland, the \"Black Angel\" in Uummannaq\n\nmunicipality, terminated its operations in the summer of 1990 as\n\nthe deposits were exhausted. Consequently, the 1990 export value\n\nof minerals isexpected to fall to approximately one third of the\n\n1989 level, and Greenland will derive no income from mineral\n\nexports in 1991. No other mine projects are expected to open\n\nwithin the foreseeable future, although exploration surveys are\n\nbeing carried out in several parts of Greenland.\n\n104. The income generated from sales of cod and cod\n\nproducts almost doubled between 1987 and 1988 and again\n\nbetween 1988 and 1989 when cod ,accounted for 15 per cent. of\n\nthe total expok value. The catch' statistici for these two years\n\nmay be attributed to the exceptionally plentiful cod fry of 1984\n\nand 1985. The cod fry of 1985 may be fished until 1990, but the\n\nsubsequent cod years have been so meagre that in the early\n\n1990s the Greenland cod catch is expected to dwindle to\n\napproximately one fifth of the 1989 level. The Greenland fishery\n\nzone lies on the periphery of the cod's geographical area of\n\ndistribution, and even very slight variations in climatic conditions\n\nor sea currenis may make the difference between a successful and\n\na disastrous cod year within the Greenland fishery zone,.\n\n105.

Shrimp\n\nalready constitute Greenland's most important export commodity.\n\nIn 1989, shrimp accounted for an approximate 60 per cent. of the\n\ntotal export revenues. Due to conservation considerations, the\n\nyearly total allowable shrimp catch in the Greenland zone is not\n\nlikely to be increased. As the Greenland shrimp are at the same\n\ntime encountering fiercer pnce cornpetition on the export markets,\n\nGreenland shrimp fishing is not expected to bring a substantially\n\nhigher yield in the next few years. With no other export\n\ncommodity immediately capable of offsetting the anticipated loss\n\nof income on mineral resources and cod products, Greenland may\n\nbe facing a serious trade deficit problem in the years to corne.\n\nThese prospects compel Greenland to augment the exploitation of\n\nal1available resources.\n\n106. As a consequence of the introduction of Home Rule\n\nin Greenland in 1979, most public administrative fields have\n\nthrough the 1980s been gradually transferred to Home Rule, with\n\nthe transfer of the law-making and budgetary powers from the\n\nCentral Authonties of the Danish Realm to the Home Rule\n\nAuthonty, see the Memonal, pages 31 - 32, paragraphs 124 -\n\n126. Vested with these extensive powers, the Home Rule\n\nAuthority decided that increased public expenditure was required\n\nwithin a number of transferred administrative fields in order for\n\nGreenland to meet the challenge of sustaining an independent\n\neconomy.\n\n107. In 1986, the Home Rule Authority launcheda major\n\nindustrial development programme to promote employment and\n\nthe profitability of the expon trade. The fisheries sector is\n\nexpected to remain the corner-stone of the Greenland economy,\n\nand most of the investments were made in fish processing plants,\n\npublic and publicly subsidised private purchases of fishing\n\nvessels, port facilities etc. 108. As a result of these extensive capital investments,\n\nGreenland sustained a rapidly increasing budget deficit in the\n\nmid-1980s. Deficits were covered by loans from foreign and\n\nGreenland commercial banks to the Home Rule Authority. In\n\n1988 the Home Rule Authority decided to introduce a public\n\nausterity programme lest the developing Greenland economy be\n\ncrippled by a heavy foreign debt burden. Table 111demonstrates\n\nthat the austerity measures have improved the Greenland economy\n\nby tuming the budget deficit of the mid-1980s into a surplus.\n\nThe surplus was only reached through a severe reduction in\n\npublic investments, especially within the fishing industry,\n\ninvestments that are imperative if Greenland is to obtain a higher\n\ndegree of economic independence.\n\nTABLE III lncome and Expenditure of the Home Rule Authority\n\nin 1987 -1989.

In addition to Greenland's export revenues from its\n\nown fishing activities, Greenland receives a very substantial\n\nincome from granting third State fishing vessels access to fishing\n\noperations in the Greenland fishery zone under the Fishery\n\nAgreement with the EEC, see below pages 50, paragraphs 126 -\n\n127. In 1989, Greenland's revenue from the issuance of fishing\n\nlicences to third States was USD 28 million, growing Io USD 36\n\nmillion in 1990. 110. When examining the importance of exploitation of\n\nmarine resources in the Greenland fishery zone to the economy\n\nof Greenland, one should focus not only on the current export\n\nrevenues of the Greenland fishing industry but also on the\n\neconomic potential of a future Greenland exploitation of resources\n\nthat are presently allocated to third States against payment.\n\nGreenland vessels already fish more than three fourths of the fish\n\ncaught in the Greenland fishery zone, see below page 48, Table\n\nVI, but itis the long-term goal of the Greenland fishery policy to\n\nrender the local fishing industry capable of exploiting al1 of\n\nGreenland's manne resources.\n\n2.

The wealth of Nonvegian catch statistics is interesting\n\nas an overview of the wide-ranging North Atlantic operations of\n\nthe Nonvegian fishing fleet, but the information submitted by\n\nNorway i's mostly irrelevant to the present delimitation of the\n\nmaritime zones between the East Coast of Greenland and Jan\n\nMayen. ,Alrnost al1 catch statistics in Appendix. 5 of the\n\nCounter-Mernorial cover fishing' activities outside the disputed\n\narea, or are concemed with species that are 'no 'longer caught in\n\nthe disputed area.\n\n113. The tables of Appendix 5 the Counter-Memorial with\n\nrespect to fishing in the \"Jan Mayen-Greenland Area\" are predominantly based on figures published by the Intemational\n\nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The statistics\n\ncompiled by ICES serve as a basis for biological advice on the\n\nmanagement of the fish stocks, but take no account of national\n\nfishery zones. A number of the Norwegian tables thus include\n\ncatches taken in parts of the Greenland fishery zone, parts of the\n\ndisputed area, pans of the Jan Mayen fishery zone, and in some\n\ncases parts of the high seas. The geographical scope of the\n\nNorwegian tables of Appendix 5 are correspondingly vague (\"East\n\nGreenland Area, Table 5.2; \"Jan Mayen-Iceland-East Greenland\n\nArea\", Table 5.6). Often the tables do not indicate precisely what\n\ngeographical areas are covered. The value of this type of\n\nstatistics in a delimitation case is at best limited.\n\n114. In order to rebut the inference of Norwegian fishing\n\npre-eminence in Greenland waters that may be drawn from the\n\ngeneral tenor of the Counter-Memorial, the Govemment of\n\nDenmark will describe the development of the ratio between\n\nGreenland and foreign state fishing in Greenland waters over the\n\nlast decades.\n\n115. The Govemment of Denmark has chosen to provide\n\ncatch statistics covering catches within the Greenland fishery zone\n\nonly. Following the extensions of the Greenland fishery zone in\n\n1977 (on the West Coast and on the East Coast south of 67ON)\n\nand in 1980 (on the East Coast north of 67\"N), Danish and\n\nsubsequently Home Rule authorities have required al1 vessels\n\nfishing in the Greenland zone to submit catch reports. These\n\nreports have enabled the authonties to monitor al1 activities\n\nwithin the Greenland zone. Prior to the extensions of the\n\nGreenland fishery zone, Greenland, Faroese and Danish catches in\n\nthe waters off Greenland were registered, but the total fishing\n\nactivities of al1 States in this period may be recorded only\n\nthrough the application of figures collected by ICES or ICNAF\n\n(International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries,\n\ncovering the waters off the West Coast of Greenland).\n\n116. Due to the above-mentioned rnanner in which\n\ninformation on catches has been collected by Denmark/Greenland,Nonvay, and international bodies such as ICES and ICNAF,\n\nneither Nonvay nor Denmark is able to provide catch statistics\n\ncovering al1 activities within the disputed area.\n\nFISHING IN GREENLAND WATERS BEFORE THE ~~O-MILE FISHERY\n\nZONE\n\n117. Pnor to the extensions of the Greenland fishery zone\n\nto 200 nautical miles in 1977 and 1980, the resources of the\n\nwaters around Greenland were predominantly exploited by\n\nnon-Greenland vessels. The vessels came from a number of West\n\nand East European countries. Greenland did not benefit from the\n\nactivities ofhese third State vessels in the area; on the contrary,\n\nthe absence of regulations on the management of the fish stocks\n\nbinding upon al1 parties led to overfishing of several species to\n\nthe point of depletion of the stocks. Cod fishing was the main\n\nattraction of Greenland waters to foreign fishing vessels in the\n\n1950s and 1960s with total yearly catches running into several\n\nhundreds of thousands of tonnes. In this penod Greenland vessels\n\naccounted for approximately 5 per cent. of total cod catches. A\n\nsudden drop in sea temperature in the late 1960s resulted in a\n\ndrastically reduced occurrence of the available cod stock and in\n\nreduced fishing activities by foreign vessels in the waters off\n\nGreenland. Table IV graphically depicts the proportions of foreign\n\nfishing, Norway separately noted, vis-à-vis Greenland fishing in\n\nthe waters around Greenland until the extension of the Greenland\n\nfishery zone. Until 1970 cod catches formed the overwhelming\n\npart of the totalnnual catches.

The extensions of the Greenland fishery zone to 200\n\nnautical miles in 1977 and 1980 provided the legal basis for a\n\nclosely monitored exploitation and an appropriate conservation of\n\nthe fish stocks within the Greenland zone. Total allowable\n\ncatches were established for the various species on the basis of\n\nbiologicaladvice and fishing by foreign States made contingent\n\nupon negotiated access.\n\n119. At the time of the extensions of the zone in 1977\n\nand 1980, Greenland was a member of the European\n\nCommunities, and the Greenland fishery zone was considered\n\nEEC waters for purposes of EEC fishery policy. The EEC fishingauthonties established national quotas phasing out fishing by\n\nnon-EC third States in the waters around Greenland in favour of\n\nEC vessels. Although Greenland's crucial dependence on income\n\nfrom the fishing industry was recognised by the EEC and the\n\ngrowing Greenland fishing fleet allowed to fish in Greenland\n\nwaters, the Greenland vessels still had to compete with vessels\n\nfrom transatlantic EC countries for the allotment of quotas in\n\nGreenland waters. Norway was not a member of the\n\nCommunities and was in pnnciple barred from continuing its\n\nfishing in the waters around Greenland after the extensions of the\n\nGreenland fishery zone. However, the EEC granted Norway\n\naccess to fishing in the Greenland fishery zone as part of a\n\nreciprocal fishery agreement concluded in 1980 between the\n\nCommunities and Norway. Norway became entitled to exploit\n\ninter aliapart of the valuable shrimp stock at the expense of\n\nreduced access to Greenland shrimp fishing for EC nations,\n\nincludingDenmark.\n\nGREENLAND'W SITHDRAWA LROM THE EC\n\n120. Effective as of 1 Febmary 1985 Greenland left the\n\nEC and assumed full control of the exploitationnthe fish stocks\n\nin the Greenland fishery zone. Thisexercise of Greenland's right\n\nto make decisions on the management of its own resources had\n\nbeen the goal of strong political forces in Greenland since the\n\ninstitution of Home Rule in Greenland in 1979. The activities of\n\nforeign fishing vessels in Greenland waters did not cease with\n\nGreenland's departure from the EC, but the extent and character\n\nof foreign fishing was now regulated by the Home Rule\n\nAuthonty and wasonly allowed in so far as such fishing was\n\nconsidered ecologically sustainable and beneficial to the\n\nGreenland society.\n\n121. The fishery policy of the Home Rule Authonty has\n\nbeen committed to the promotion of the domestic Greenland\n\nfishing industry, the main source of income to the Greenland\n\neconomy. The Greenland share of the total catches in Greenland\n\nwaters has grown rapidly since the extensions of the zone in\n\n1977 and 1980. In 1989 Greenland vessels fished more than 75 per cent. of the total catches in the Greenland fishery zone as\n\nopposed to only 46 per cent. in 1978. The ratio between\n\nGreenland and foreign fishing within the Greenland fishery zone\n\nin the period 1978 - 1989 is graphically depicted below in Table\n\nV. Table V should be compared with Table IV on page 45\n\ndepicting the same ratio in the period up to the extension of the\n\nGreenland fishery zone in 1977.\n\nTABLE V Greenland and Foreign Fishing, Noway Separately\n\nNoted, in the GreenlandFishery Zone in 1978 - 1989.

As a result, Greenland's\n\n75 per cent. share of the total catches in the Greenland zone in\n\n1989 is estimated to account for approximately 90 per cent. of\n\nthe total first-hand catch value.

The resources of the Greenland fishery zone are to\n\nthe widest extent possible utilised by Greenland vessels.\n\nHowever, the modem Greenland fishing fleet is neither\n\nsufficiently large nor sufficiently specialised tollow Greenland\n\nto exploit itself the full potential of the resources of Greenland\n\nwaters. In accordance with the principles embodied in Article 62\n\nof the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, Greenland has\n\nallowed third States to fish the surplus resource that Greenland is\n\nnot currently capable of exploiting itself.\n\n124. A shortage of pnvate capital in Greenland has made\n\nthe development of the fishing fleet and the fishing industry in\n\ngeneral dependent on Public support and investments. The largest\n\noperation within the Greenland fisheries sector is Royal\n\nGreenland, a limited Company owned by the Home Rule\n\nAuthority. Royal Greenland owns its own trawler fleet, practically\n\nal1 fish processing plants in Greenland and an export unit in\n\nDenmark. Expansion and development of the pnvately owned\n\nGreenland fishing fleet also depends on subsidies and other forms\n\nof public support.\n\n125. The fishery policy of Greenland has focused on local\n\nexploitation of the most profitable species, and the Home Rule\n\nAuthority has acquired a number of industrial trawlers as well as\n\nextensively supported the private purchase of fishing vessels in\n\ngeneral. However, rendering the Greenland fishing fleet capable\n\nof fishing al1 available resources in the Greenland zone requires\n\nsuch substantial investments in the fishing industry that these\n\nmust necessarily be undertaken over a period of years. Finally,\n\nGreenland denves a considerable income from the issuance of\n\nfishing licences ta third States, and the revenues constitute an\n\nimportant contribution to the development of Greenland's\n\neconomy, including the fisheries sector. The reasons for allocating\n\nparticularly the capelin fishing to third State vessels will be\n\naddressed below on pages 64 - 65, paragraphs 159 - 161. GREENLAND' FISHERY AGREEMEN T lTH THEEEC\n\n126. Greenland's most important fishery agreement is the\n\nten-year Fishery Agreement concluded with the EEC in 1984 on\n\nthe eve of Greenland's withdrawal from the European Community\n\n(Annex 21 to the Memonal). The Agreement is descnbed in the\n\nMemonal, page 47, paragraph 177. Suffice it hereIOpoint out\n\nthat the EEC Agreement is more complex than a regular third\n\nState licence arrangement. The EEC is allotted annual quotas for\n\nthe different species and pays a fixed yearly fee irrespective of\n\nwhether the quotas are exploited. In addition ta the receipt of a\n\nyearly payment from the EEC, Greenland products are exempted\n\nfrom EEC duty. Under the Agreement, the EEC may reallocate\n\nquotas to the individual EC member States according to EEC\n\nfishery policy and also to non-EC nations. The EEC has\n\nreallocated quotas to Norway and the Faroe Islands. The Faroe\n\nIslands have had Home Rule since 1948 and have never been a\n\nmember of the EC.\n\n127. The conditions of the second five-year terni of the\n\nFishery Agreement with the EECwere negotiated in 1989. In this\n\nSecond Protocol (1990-1994) the quotas and payment have been\n\nreviewed and adjusted according to the biological status of the\n\ndifferent fish stocks (Annex 63). As a result, the EEC cod quota\n\nwas substantially cut, and the European access ta shnmp fishing\n\nshifted from West Greenland waters to East Greenland.\n\nGreenland's yearly remuneration increased fromECU 26.5 million\n\n(approximately USD 28 milli~n)'~ to ECU 34.25 million\n\n(approximately USD 36 million).\n\nNORWAY'S ACCESS TO GREENLAND WATERS UNDER THE EEC\n\nAGREEMENT\n\n128. Under the reciprocal Fishery Agreement between\n\nNorway and the EEC of 1980, Norway is reallocated part of the\n\nEEC quotas in Greenland waters. The Counter-Memorial omits\n\n\"Accordingto the rate of exchange rulingal 1 lune 1989 when 100 ECU\n\nequalled 104.73 USD.\n\n50 direct mention of Norway's negotiated access to the Greenland\n\nfishery zone. The access obtained through the EEC is Norway's\n\nonly basis for operating inside the Greenland fishery zone, a fact\n\nthat should be kept in mind when examining e.g., the Norwegian\n\nshrimp catches off West Greenland and East Greenland in\n\nAppendix 5, Table 5.11 of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n129. Under the new 5-year Protocol of the Fishery\n\nAgreement between Greenland and the EEC, Norway has been\n\nallotted most of the EEC share of the lucrative shrimp fishing off\n\nthe East Coast of Greenland, see Table VI11below on page 57.\n\nIn addition, Norway is entitled to fish Greenland halibut off both\n\nthe West and the East Coast of Greenland, and (Atlantic) halibut\n\noff the West Coast.\n\n130. The EEC has developed a common denominator for\n\ncomparing the value of different species of fish, namely the \"cod\n\nequivalent\". This denominator has been employed by the EEC\n\nand Greenland in the EEC Fishery Agreement. Based on the EEC\n\ncod equivalent, the value of the Norwegian quotas in the\n\nGreenland fishery zone may be calculated to 7.9 per cent. of the\n\ntotal value of the quotas allotted to the EEC under the Fishery\n\nAgreement with Greenland. The Norwegian \"share\" of the total\n\nEEC access fee under the Fishery Agreement thus amounts to\n\nUSD 2.8 million. It should be noted that Norway has not\n\ncompensated the EEC for the quotas granted to Norway in the\n\nGreenland fishing zone in cash, but by reciprocal fishing rights\n\nfor EC vessels in the Norwegian fishery zone.\n\nF.

In the Counter-Memorial, Norway has attempted to\n\nbelittle the importance to the Greenland economy of the fishing\n\nactivities off the East Coast of Greenland. 132. Norway States that \"the activities of the modem\n\nGreenland fishing fleet have been almost exclusively confined to\n\nGreenland West Coast waters\" and that \"Greenland'sinterest in\n\neast coast fishing is of a very recent date\". Norway further\n\nmaintains that available resources in the East Coast waters have\n\nmainly been allocated to third States through licences, with\n\nGreenland vessels participating to a limited extent only in the cod\n\nand shrimp fishing off the southeast coast. Finally, emphasis is\n\nput on the fact that out of a total of 310 modem Greenland\n\nfishing vessels, only five had their registered home port in East\n\nGreenland (the Counter-Memonal, p. 12, para. 45).\n\nGREENLAND IS A GEOGRAPHIC"
