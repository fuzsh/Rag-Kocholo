FY 1950–1959\n\nA. Denmark\n\nMilitary Assistance Fiscal Data\n\nTotal grant military assistance for Denmark as of 30 June 1959 amounted to $511.5 million, of which $434.9 million had been delivered by that date.\n\nIn addition, as of 30 June 1959, excess stocks (not chargeable to the Military Assistance Program) with an acquisition cost of $16.6 million had been programmed, $10.3 million of which had been delivered by that date.\n\nDenmark has also benefited from military assistance offshore procurement (OSP). OSP obligations as of 30 June 1959 amounted to $25.6 million, of which $16.8 million had been expended by that date.\n\nForces\n\nMutual Security Forces for Denmark are:\n\n4 Infantry Divisions\n\n75 Naval Vessels\n\n7 Air Squadrons\n\n1 Surface-to-Surface Missile Squadron (Mace)\n\n2 Surface-to-Surface Missile Bns. (Honest John)\n\n2 Surface-to-Air Missile Bns. (Nike)\n\n1 Surface-to-Air Missile Bn. (Hawk)\n\n2 8\" Howitzer Batteries (Atomic)\n\nU.S. Military Commitments\n\nU.S. military commitments to Denmark stem from our joint membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nMilitary Assistance Program Content\n\nThe Military Assistance Program has greatly assisted in strengthening the Danish forces by delivery of tanks, transport vehicles, artillery, aircraft, escort vessels, mine warfare vessels, special electronics equipment, and ammunition. The grant military assistance programmed during the period FY 1950–1959 included the following major categories of equipment:\n\nAircraft, components, spares and related support equipment (includes 240 F–84 and 56 F–86 aircraft) $ 113 million Ships and harbor craft, components and spares (includes 2 minelayers, 12 minesweepers, and 2 patrol escort vessels) $ 54 million Tanks, other vehicles, weapons, components and spares (includes approximately 290 tanks and 3,900 trucks) $ 101 million [Page 683] Ammunition (training and war reserve) $ 90 million Guided missile systems, components, and spares (for a Nike and an Honest John missile battalion) $ 40 million Electronics and communications equipment, components and spares $ 37 million\n\nCost-Sharing Programs\n\nDenmark has benefited from the U.S. contribution to NATO Infrastructure Program with total expenditures of $17.3 million as of 30 June 1959. In addition, the United States and Denmark signed an agreement in FY 1959 for the construction in Denmark of 23 small naval craft over a five-year period, with costs to be shared equally between the United States and Denmark. $10.2 million of military assistance has been programmed through FY 1959 as the U.S. contribution to the cost-sharing shipbuilding program.\n\nMilitary Sales Program\n\nDuring the period FY 1950–1959, Denmark placed orders with the U.S. Military Departments for purchase on a cash dollar basis for $3.5 million of equipment under the Mutual Security Military Sales Program, of which $2.4 million had been delivered by 30 June 1959.\n\nAnalysis of Expenditure Trends\n\nThe average annual expenditure level for the period FY 1958–1960 is less than half the average annual expenditure level for the previous five fiscal years (FY 1953–1957). Inasmuch as the NATO requirements for the Danish forces have never been fully met, the declining level of expenditures is attributable to the over-all decline in the availability of military assistance funds and the increased demands upon these funds for other countries. The estimated increase in FY 1960 expenditures, as compared with FY 1958 and FY 1959, is due to the delivery of Honest John and Nike missiles.\n\nB. Norway.\n\nMilitary Assistance Fiscal Data\n\nTotal grant military assistance for Norway as of 30 June 1959 amounted to $679.7 million, of which $603.7 million had been delivered by that date.\n\nIn addition, as of 30 June 1959 excess stocks (not chargeable to the Military Assistance Program) with an acquisition cost of $19.0 million had been programmed, substantially all of which had been delivered by that date.\n\nNorway has also received benefits from military assistance offshore procurement (OSP). OSP obligations were $48.7 million as of 30 June 1959, of which $26.5 million had been expended by that date.\n\n[Page 684]\n\nForces\n\nMutual Security Forces for Norway are:\n\n3–1/3 Infantry Divisions\n\n46 Vessels\n\n1 ASW Patrol Squadron\n\n9 Air Squadrons\n\n2 Surface-to-Surface Bns (Honest John)\n\n2 Surface-to-Air Bns (Nike and Hawk)\n\nU.S. Military Commitments\n\nU.S. military commitments to Norway stem from our joint membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nMilitary Assistance Program Content\n\nThe Military Assistance Program has greatly assisted in strengthening the Norwegian forces by delivery of tanks, transport vehicles, artillery, aircraft, escort vessels, mine warfare vessels, special electronics equipment, and ammunition. The grant military assistance programmed during the period FY 1950–1959 included the following major categories of equipment:\n\nAircraft, components, spares and related support equipment (includes 176 F–86 aircraft) $177 million Ships and Harbor craft, components and spares (includes 9 minesweepers, 2 minelayers and 10 motor torpedo boats) $52 million Tanks, other vehicles, weapons, components and spares (includes 113 light tanks and approximately 3,500 trucks) $119 million Ammunition (war reserve and training) $137 million Guided missile systems, components and spares (including an Honest John and a Nike battalion) $55 million\n\nCost-Sharing Programs\n\nThrough FY 1959 Norway received $41.4 million of U.S. assistance under the NATO Infrastructure Program. In addition, Norway participates in the Mutual Weapons Development Program (MWDP) and the Weapons Production Program (WPP). Expenditures through 30 June 1959 were $2.5 million for MWDP and $0.8 million for WPP.\n\nMilitary Sales Program\n\nDuring the period FY 1950–1959, Norway placed orders with the U.S. Military Departments for the purchase on a cash dollar basis for $2.5 million of equipment under the Mutual Security Military Sales Program, of which $2.2 million was delivered by 30 June 1959.\n\n[Page 685]\n\nAnalysis of Expenditure Trends\n\nThe expenditure level for FY 1958 was comparable with the average annual expenditure for the five preceding fiscal years. There was a sharp decline in FY 1959 because of the over-all decline in the availability of military assistance funds and increased requirements elsewhere in the world. The estimated expenditures for FY 1960 show an upward turn resulting from the delivery of Honest John and Nike missiles, although the estimated FY 1960 expenditures will still be only about half the annual expenditure level for the FY 1953–1957 period.\n\nC. Sweden\n\nSweden does not receive grant military assistance and is not joined with the United States under any collective security agreement. As a result, U.S. assistance is limited to the cash dollar sale of equipment under the provisions of the Mutual Security Military Sales (MSMS) program.\n\nSweden purchased $10.7 million of equipment on a direct cash basis from the U.S. Military Departments under the MSMS program through 30 June 1959, of which $0.3 million was delivered by that date. Most of the purchases occurred in FY ($10.2 million for 2,000 Sidewinder missiles).\n\nIn December 1959, Sweden expressed interest in purchasing in the United States or in manufacturing in Sweden certain advanced U.S. weapons including Hawk, Bomarc, Falcon, and Sidewinder missiles. Final action has not yet been taken.\n\nII. FY 1960–1963\n\nA. Denmark\n\nMilitary Assistance, FY 1960–1963:\n\nMilitary Assistance for the period FY 1950–1959 was predominantly in the form of grant assistance for conventional weapons for the initial equipping of the Danish forces. Some advanced weapons, including Nike and Honest John missiles, were programmed in the FY 1950–59 period. During the next few years, Military Assistance will be primarily directed toward (1) continuation of the equipping of the Danish forces with advanced aircraft and missile systems, (2) the replacement and modernization of obsolete or worn out conventional equipment, and (3) inducing an increase in and better utilization of Danish defense resources through cost-sharing programs.\n\nThe estimated program for FY 1960 includes 17 F–100 aircraft, a fifty percent U.S. contribution toward the construction of two minesweepers and a submarine in accordance with the U.S.-Danish cost-sharing agreement, missile spare parts and components, ammunition, and training assistance.\n\n[Page 686]\n\nThe proposed FY 1961 program contains 17 F–100 aircraft, a fifty percent U.S. contribution toward the construction of two escort destroyers and two minelayers, rehabilitation costs for two minesweepers to be redistributed from Norway, spare parts, ammunition and training assistance.\n\nThe projected programs for FY 1962–1963 include Nike, Hawk, Honest Johns, and Sidewinder missiles; light tanks, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, and other combat vehicles; F-104 and F–100 aircraft; ammunition; spare parts and engine overhaul; naval vessels; and training assistance. A significant portion of the naval vessels, aircraft, and missiles will probably be provided through Danish-U.S. and/or NATO cost-sharing programs.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nNo major changes are projected in the force structure or mission of the Danish forces. The ability of the Danish forces to assist in closing the exits of the Baltic to Soviet submarines will continue to be of security interest to the United States.\n\nThe estimates assume that Denmark will not become “financially able to pay” for military equipment within the terms of NSC Action No. 2158 during the period covered by this Financial Appendix.8\n\nFiscal Analysis:\n\nA total grant assistance program of $203 million is projected for FY 1960–FY 1963 to assist Denmark in the attainment of its NATO goals (paragraph 33).\n\nThe undelivered balance of grant aid military assistance programmed as of June 30, 1959, was approximately $70 million. This balance plus the projected FY 1960–1963 programs of $203 million would result in projected expenditures of $198 million over the FY 1960–1963 period, leaving an undelivered balance of $75 million as of June 30, 1963.\n\nExpenditure Trends:\n\nThe annual expenditure level for the period FY 1958 and FY 1959 was less than half the average annual expenditure level of the previous five fiscal years. Inasmuch as the NATO requirements for the Danish forces have never been fully met, the decline in FY 1958 and FY 1959 expenditures was primarily attributable to the over-all decline in the availability of military assistance funds and the increased demands upon these funds for other countries. Expenditures are expected to return to the pre-FY 1958 level in the FY 1960–1963 period because of the [Page 687] increased cost of the more modern weapons systems included in the current and projected programs.\n\nB. Norway\n\nMilitary Assistance FY 1960–1963:\n\nMilitary Assistance for the period FY 1950–1959 was predominantly in the form of grant assistance for conventional weapons for the initial equipping of the Norwegian forces. Some advanced weapons, including Nike and Honest John missiles, were included in the FY 1958 and FY 1959 programs. During the next few years, military assistance will be primarily directed toward: (1) the continuation of the equipping of the Norwegian forces with advanced aircraft and missile systems, (2) the replacement and modernization of obsolete or worn out conventional equipment, and (3) inducing an increase in and better utilization of Norwegian defense resources through cost-sharing programs.\n\nThe estimated program for FY 1960 includes 25 F–86F aircraft, six maritime patrol aircraft, a minelayer, electronic equipment, missile spares, ammunition, and training assistance.\n\nThe proposed FY 1961 program includes a fifty percent U.S. contribution toward the construction of two submarines; 12 advanced reconnaissance aircraft; 10 F–86F attrition aircraft; four maritime patrol aircraft; missile spares and components; ammunition; and training assistance.\n\nThe projected programs for FY 1962–1963 include SS 10/11, Honest John, and Hawk missiles, destroyers and submarines, RF–104 and maritime patrol aircraft, armored personnel carriers, medium tanks, special purpose vehicles and helicopters, ammunition, spare parts, and training assistance. A significant portion of the aircraft, naval vessels and missiles will probably be provided through U.S.-Norwegian and/or NATO cost-sharing programs.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nNo major changes are currently projected in the force structure or the mission of the Norwegian forces. The ability of the Norwegian forces to provide surveillance and assist in closing the exits of the Baltic to Soviet submarines will continue to be of security interest to the United States.\n\nThe estimates assume that Norway will not become “financially able to pay” for military equipment within the terms of NSC Action No. 2158 during the period covered by this Financial Appendix.9\n\n[Page 688]\n\nFiscal Analysis:\n\nA total grant assistance program of $207 million is projected for FY 1960–FY 1963 to assist Norway in the attainment of its NATO goals (Paragraph 33).\n\nThe undelivered balance of grant military assistance programmed as of June 30, 1959, was approximately $33 million. This balance plus the projected FY 1960–1963 programs of $207 million would result in projected expenditures of $185 million over the FY 1960–1963 period, leaving an undelivered balance of $55 million as of June 30, 1963.\n\nExpenditure Trends:\n\nThe expenditure level for FY 1958 was comparable with the average annual expenditure level for the five preceding fiscal years. There was a sharp decline in the FY 1959 expenditures resulting from the over-all decline in military assistance funds and increased requirements elsewhere in the world. The estimated expenditures for FY 1960–1963 show an upward turn because of the increased cost of the more modern weapons included in the current and projected programs.\n\nC. Sweden\n\nMilitary Assistance, FY 1960–1963:\n\nIt is not currently envisaged that U.S. grant military assistance will be provided to Sweden in the FY 1960–1963 period."
