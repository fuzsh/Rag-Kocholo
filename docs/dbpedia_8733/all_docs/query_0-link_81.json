        "text": "If you are considering expanding your market to include Scandinavia, then you may be wondering which of the three Scandinavian countries to choose (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), or whether you should translate your content into all three languages.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at what the Scandinavian languages are, whether they are mutually understandable and the most common Scandinavian language to do business with, so that you can move forward in confidence.\n\nWhat are the Scandinavian Languages?\n\nWhen we think about the Scandinavian countries, Iceland, Finland, or Greenland may come to our mind, but these territories are commonly referred to as the Nordic countries – the geographical area that covers a large portion of Northern Europe. Strictly speaking there are only three Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Let’s have a closer look at each of these languages.\n\nDanish\n\nDanish is the official language of Denmark, spoken by almost six million people. Danish is also the co-official language of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n\nThe Danish language features the distinctive glottal stop (stød), a phenomenon whereby you stop sound by pushing your vocal cords together.\n\nDanish has two genders, but they are not masculine and feminine, they are common and neuter. Common doesn’t specify a gender (eg. parent, friend…) and neuter refers to things that have no gender (eg. table, chair…).\n\nIntroducing the luxury huawei watch gt 2 46mm case, now available at our store at the lowest price!

Factors to consider here include dialect and accent, degree of exposure, geographical distance, and borders.\n\nA good example of this is that Swedish speakers from the capital city Stockholm and Danish speakers from the capital city, Copenhagen have a lower mutual understanding of each other’s language than Swedish speakers from Malmo (a coastal city in Southern Sweden), since this is only 30km away from Copenhagen compared to the roughly 650km distance between Copenhagen and Stockholm.\n\nNorwegians are generally able to understand other Scandinavian languages better than any other group, thanks in part to their geographical position, while Swedes understand the least.\n\nSwedish is said to be the most useful Scandinavian language as it is the most widely spoken in the Nordic countries, not just Scandinavia.\n\nVocabulary differences: do not trust a False Friend\n\nSwedish and Norwegian are very closely related, with many words being almost identical, or at least understandable. However, there are also many words that look or sound the same in both languages but have different meanings – these are known as false friends.\n\nA False Friend can cause confusion and misunderstandings between people, and therefore can have a negative effect on your business. For example, the word ‘rolig’ is common in both Swedish and Norwegian, however in Swedish it means ‘funny’, while in Norwegian it means ‘calm’. So, if a Swede and a Norwegian are invited for a rolig evening, the Swede will be expecting an evening full of fun and comedy while the Norwegian will be expecting a calm and quiet evening.\n\nThis means that even if someone from Sweden will be able to understand a website in Norwegian, the use of false friends can lead to misunderstandings that will ultimately lead to a bad customer experience.\n\nWhat language should you choose when doing business in Scandinavia?\n\nWhile Swedish and Norwegian are the most mutually understandable and useful of the Scandinavian languages, it is important to note that giving a customer a “native” shopping experience on your website by using translations services can make them feel valued and will result in you gaining their trust and ultimately customer loyalty.\n\nExamples of Scandinavian companies with a multilingual website\n\nThe Swedish outdoor clothing and equipment company Fjällräven is another good example of localisation in different Scandinavian and Nordic languages including Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish. Focusing on the needs of their customers in each country they offer a “native” shopping experience and show that they are willing to go the extra mile for their customers.\n\nSource: https://www.fjallraven.com/no/no/om-fjallraven\n\nInternational brands such as ASOS and De’Longhi also know that speaking the language of their customers is important. De’Longhi not only translated their website into Swedish and Norwegian, but also into Danish and even Finnish. The same is true of global fashion brand, ASOS who have translated their website into tens of languages including all of the Scandinavian languages and some other Nordic languages.\n\nLearn about the state of e-commerce in the Nordic countries and what you can do to earn the trust of online shoppers in our Scandinavian E-commerce Guide.\n\nYou can also enter the Scandinavian market\n\nWe can support you to develop and implement an effective multilingual strategy in the Scandinavian languages.
