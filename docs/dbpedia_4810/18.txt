SiteGround plans and pricing

SiteGround offers several types of hosting. If you open their website, you will quickly see offers related to web hosting, WordPress hosting, WooCommerce hosting, as well as Cloud hosting.

For the purposes of this overview, I will show you what you can get with their WordPress hosting offering.

SiteGround key features and functions

SiteGround offers everything you could need for hosting your WordPress website. Let’s discover the most prominent features and functions that the company promises to deliver:

Dashboard overview

SiteGround comes with a custom panel that allows you to quickly and easily control every aspect of your hosting and site.

Home

The home tab holds all of the important information and connects you to the rest of the panel where you can finetune the details.

Websites

Whether you have one or several websites active on your hosting plan, you will be able to find them here. If the site was created with WordPress, you will have the “WordPress” kit button that opens all of the available tools for optimizing your WordPress site.

If you need to have more people working on the same account (a colleague or a client who needs to log in), this tab will let you manage user accounts as well, so you do not have to share account credentials.

Services

This tab will hold all of the services you have active with SiteGround. This means that all hosting plans and domains that you have associated with SiteGround will be easily found under the Services tab, where you can quickly manage them.

Billing

This is the place to manage your billing. Easily change account info, cancel automatic renewals, and more. If you need an official invoice, this is also the location to generate one quickly.

Affiliates

If you want to join SiteGround’s affiliate program, this is the place to manage everything you need. Set up your first campaign, get your affiliate links, track conversions, and more.

Here you will also find visual assets (like banners for your site) that will help you to get started with affiliate marketing more easily.

Marketplace

If you decide to expand your current services on SiteGround, you can find everything you will need on their Marketplace. Buy new domains, hosting plans, add 3rd party services, and more.

SiteGround knowledge base and support

Their documentation center is always available on SiteGround’s website, and you can access it even before you purchase a hosting plan. The knowledge base looks nice, and more importantly, is organized well. You will find the topics organized into categories for easier navigation. There’s also always a search bar available at the top of the screen.

If you open one of the articles, you will realize that they are short and direct, while all of the images are on-point, so that you can quickly solve any issue by yourself.

However, if that doesn’t happen, it is good to know that you can easily contact support via chat and tickets. Phone support is available as well, and the great news is that SiteGround’s phone support is available 24/7!

SiteGround refund policy

SiteGround offers a 30-day refund policy for all of their shared hosting plans. However, if you purchase one of the Cloud hosting plans, the refund policy is only 14 days.

Please note that domain name fees, 3rd party services, and paid support are not refundable.
