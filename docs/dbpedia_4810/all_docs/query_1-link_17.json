Other characters like space and tab characters also cause issues because, unless properly quoted such that the white space is seen as embedded characters, they appear more like separators and so instead of programs seeing one file named \"this and that\" they see three files:\n\nYou, as a developer are then tasked with trying to facilitate ease of creation of files and directories with automated fixing of file and directory names to avoid problems. This is most often done in DCTs with FormAPI code, but it can be done in other locations using similar code that performs fairly basic regex processing (at least for Latin / Roman alphabets, other alphabets may require a bit more code to handle correctly)\n\n0"
