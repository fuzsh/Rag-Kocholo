        "text": "The title of this thread has been changed by a moderator from: \"There is an issue with Square online appointment not showing all the services of the salon\".\n\nI am new to Square appointment. So I created all the Salon Services on the Square appointment app, and I had no issues booking appointments on my phone or sending to payments, until I decided to activate my online booking link, which is only showing two services out of let’s say 20!\n\nhow can I fix that?\n\nThat's really strange @Aramiamo.\n\nWhich type of browser are you using to view your Online booking site? Could you give these browser troubleshooting steps a try? Then head back to your Online Booking site and see if you're able to view your services.\n\nLet me know if you're still not able to see them, though.\n\nnika\n\nBeta Community Manager, Square\n\nJoin the Beta Community\n\nEvaluate | Influence | Engage\n\nHi there, @Hojo77 - thanks for reaching out to us here on the Seller Community.

Usually, the customer will make the service selection and there will be a \"more info\". This will generate the drop down box for the variations to show. Please let me know if you're not seeing this.\n\nDo you have a screenshot of when the variations aren't displaying correctly? This will help give me some insight on where the disconnect it.\n\nI will keep an eye out for your reply .\n\nKassi\n\nCommunity Moderator, Square\n\nSign in and click Mark as Best Answer if my reply answers your question.\n\nHi Kassi_\n\nSorry for the late response, I got frustrated and was just hoping that it's a glitch and will be fixed in a few days...but no I still don't see my variations showing.\n\nAs for your questions -\n\nWhich services aren't showing the variations you have added for them?\n\nParticularly my \"One 60-minute Lesson\" and \"Four 60-minute Lessons\". It's very weird because all the other ones shows their variations.\n\nUsually, the customer will make the service selection and there will be a \"more info\". This will generate the drop down box for the variations to show. Please let me know if you're not seeing this.\n\nI'm still not seeing it. I clicked on \"more info\" and checked the box. Nothing have worked. All the other ones would just show the variations if I just check the box without click open the \"more info\". As shown in the screenshot I took months ago.\n\nMy website - www.SimpleStringsMusic.com\n\nPlease help me figure out how to fix it, as it's really driving me crazy..."
