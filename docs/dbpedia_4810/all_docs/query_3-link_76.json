        "text": "Hi there - I am attempting to increase site speed. I have followed all the steps from the blog post linked below. I also have used WP Optimize as well. Despite these steps, the time it takes for mobile to load is still poor at ~9.1s and the total blocking time is 14,260 ms.\n\nPlease advise what I can do to improve my site speed!\n\nBlog post I’m referencing: How to Speed up a Directory or Marketplace Website Built with HivePress | HivePress Blog\n\nGoogle Ads has been removed completely, i have followed your tutorial for setuping LiteSpeed Cache Plugin for HivePress, and still the results are the same, i m hosting on same server 15+ more websites (litespeed server), and with other WP Themes i m reaching in each category over 95 points, but just with HivePress theme not, and same results are with the demo self:\n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Flistinghive.hivepress.io%2F\n\nSo its not about us or ours server configurations, the theme self must and should be improved in the next updates.\n\nI have even tried to setup HivePress on AWS machine (5GBit/s port), LiteSpeed (CyberPanel Enterprise), (32GB RAM & 8 CPU Cores) + CloudFlare premium CND solution for WordPress, and the results were always the same, zero improvement.\n\nWouldn’t it be much better if the developer took care of it, because apparently the error messages are caused by the theme self. There are little things that have to be adjusted once, but which will have an extremely good effect on the optimization, i’m very interested in purchasing all of the plugins by the end of this month, but the only thing holding me back are the minor issues with the theme and loading times. Unfortunately, I’m not interested in premium themes because they don’t belong in my niche in terms of design, and the “free” version is in my opinion anyway the best modular solution right now. I’m also not interested in putting you down or badly criticizing your work, and I’m more than thankful for the free version of the plugin and theme. So we should work as a community to make this project better and stay in development for a long time. Maybe we should create a ToDo list with all things that can be fixed in the next updates, and of course there shouldn’t be a lack of constructive suggestions.\n\nMy suggestions:\n\nset one default font type locally\n\nload geo map scripts locally, if possible\n\nthumbnails of listings should be converted automatically in to WebP formats (right now i have to use another plugins for it which costs monthly…)\n\nAnother stuff which is recommended by PageSpeed can be improved with the time like the case is with render-blocking resources.\n\nThanks for your feedback, we’ll try to do what we can to improve the performance out of the box, but most of the performance issues are not related to HivePress, for example:\n\nImage optimization\n\nDeferring scripts\n\nDeferring fonts\n\nSending cache expiration headers with every request\n\nCombining styles and scripts\n\nWe already minify all the JS and CSS in HivePress, but we can’t combine all the website styles and scripts into a single file since this would affect other plugins, this should be done by the cache/optimization plugin. Image optimization (WEBP generation and replacement) is also beyond the HivePress plugin territory, image uploads are implemented on the WordPress level. To resolve the mentioned issues we would have to develop something like LiteSpeed or WP Rocket and include it in HivePress.\n\nI checked your site again and it seems that Mapbox CSS causes most of the issues, you can try switching to Google Maps because it loads styles/scripts asynchronously. Also, you can set a higher cache expiration Screenshot by Lightshot then this suggestion will disappear and the rank will be higher."
