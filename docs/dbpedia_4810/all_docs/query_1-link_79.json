        "text": "To update existing content that CloudFront is set up to distribute for you, we recommend that you use a version identifier in file names or in folder names. This helps give you control over managing the content that CloudFront serves.\n\nUpdate existing files using versioned file names\n\nWhen you update existing files in a CloudFront distribution, we recommend that you include some sort of version identifier either in your file names or in your directory names to give yourself better control over your content. This identifier might be a date-time stamp, a sequential number, or some other method of distinguishing two versions of the same object.\n\nFor example, instead of naming a graphic file image.jpg, you might call it image_1.jpg. When you want to start serving a new version of the file, you'd name the new file image_2.jpg, and you'd update the links in your web application or website to point to image_2.jpg. Alternatively, you might put all graphics in an images_v1 directory and, when you want to start serving new versions of one or more graphics, you'd create a new images_v2 directory, and you'd update your links to point to that directory. With versioning, you don't have to wait for an object to expire before CloudFront begins to serve a new version of it, and you don't have to pay for object invalidation.\n\nEven if you version your files, we still recommend that you set an expiration date. For more information, see Manage how long content stays in the cache (expiration).\n\nRemove content so CloudFront wonât distribute it\n\nYou can remove files from your origin that you no longer want to be included in your CloudFront distribution. However, CloudFront will continue to show viewers content from the edge cache until the files expire.\n\nIf you want to remove a file right away, you must do one of the following:"
