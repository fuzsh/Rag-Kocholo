        "text": "Youâ€™re wondering how to change the image that shows on website link becauseâ€¦ You just finished your WordPress website and youâ€™re super proud of it, so you share it via text message or post it to Facebook â€“ and then you see an image you donâ€™t want representing your entire website pop up with the link youâ€™ve just shared. Sound familiar?\n\nThe good news is there is an easy way to change the image that shows on website link. (Thatâ€™s a little awkward phrasing, but Yoast SEO saysâ€¦).\n\nNote: Some things have changed since I first posted this, if you want the 2023 version using the SEOPress free plugin, click here.\n\nChange the Image that Shows on Website Link\n\nOption #1\n\nSo this image is actually a page thumbnail, and you can change it much the same way you change the thumbnail image for your blog posts. You can simply upload a featured image.\n\nNote: Depending on your theme, uploading a featured image may alter the content on your page by putting that image at the top of it. If this happens, youâ€™ll want to use option #2.\n\nTo do this, you will go to your page settings by clicking Edit Page. Note, if you use a front end page builder, you donâ€™t want to be in the page builder, but in the actual page. So in my case, I am selecting â€˜Editâ€™, not â€˜Edit with WPâ€¦.â€™.\n\nFrom there, Iâ€™m simply going to add a Featured Image in the righthand bar.\n\nOnce youâ€™ve done that, you can purge your cache and test your link again to see if you were able to change the image that shows on website link.\n\nOption #2\n\nIf this doesnâ€™t seem to work, or if it alters content on the page, then you can use the Yoast SEO plugin.\n\nOnce youâ€™ve installed the Yoast SEO plugin, youâ€™ll go back to your pageâ€™s back end via the Edit option and scroll down until you see the Yoast SEO section. Here youâ€™ll select the social tab and upload your image there:\n\nAgain, purge your cache and re-test your link. If THIS doesnâ€™t work drop my a comment and Iâ€™ll workshop it with you ðŸ™‚\n\nBest of luck! Xx, Kara\n\nReady for more?"
