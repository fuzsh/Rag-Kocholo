Upload the .sql file to your /public_html directory using an FTP client or the cPanel File Manager.\n\n2. Start a terminal client (PuTTy, etc.) and connect to your account.\n\n3. Run the following command in the console:\n\nmysql -u mysql_user -p mysql_db < public_html/database.sql\n\nReplace mysql_user with your database username, mysql_db with your database name, and database.sql with the name of your uploaded .sql file.\n\n4. Enter the MySQL user password and hit your enter key.\n\nThat’s it. If you did not get an error in your terminal client, the database import was successful."
