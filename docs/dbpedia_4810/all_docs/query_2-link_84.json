        "text": "The best web hosting services are integral to building your first website or your latest. Choosing a web hosting provider is key, like finding the best website builder, because your site can't exist online without hosting. A busy market filled with similar packages can, however, make this choice tough, but we're here to help.\n\nIf you're new to web hosting, our FAQs section outlines what you need to know to choose the right package. We advise that you consider your budget; bear security and reliability in mind; outline the storage and bandwidth levels you'll require; and make sure your chosen provider offers leading customer support and service.\n\nRead on to see our analysis and ranking of the best web hosting services.\n\nThe 3 best web hosting services right now\n\nHostinger\n\nHostinger: the best all-round web hosting service\n\nHostinger is our top web host thanks to a great range of advanced tools at top-value prices. Our exclusive deal on its Premium Shared Hosting, available for £1.99 a month, includes 100 sites, 100GB storage, and unlimited bandwidth and MySQL databases.\n\nWP Engine\n\nWP Engine: best web hosting for WordPress users\n\nWP Engine provides powerful managed WordPress hosting for developers with automated backups, integrated development, and staging environments. Its high-level performance and market-leading tools are ideal for WordPress experts wanting scalable, flexible sites.\n\nHostwinds\n\nHostwinds: market-leading performance and tools\n\nHostwinds offers excellent value-for-money, advanced tools, and excellent performance alongside a solid uptime guarantee. Modern server infrastructure, easy installations, and website builder integrations ensure it's one of the top hosts currently available.\n\nWhat are the best web hosting services?\n\nHostinger is the best web hosting service available. It offers the best budget hosting, top tools, the excellent native hPanel, high-level security integrations, Zyro's website builder, one-click Cloudflare installation, and built-in domain registration.\n\nWP Engine provides leading performance and advanced services for WordPress devs with advanced web experience. Hostwinds' excellent performance levels, features, integrations, excellent service, and value-for-money rank it highly too.\n\nCloudways, GreenGeeks, SiteGround, Namecheap, Liquid Web, HostGator, Bluehost, DreamHost, InMotion Hosting, and Domain.com are all also worth considering thanks to their own particular strengths and focuses.\n\nOur pick of the best web hosting services, compared\n\nThe best web hosting services available today\n\nHostinger\n\nThe best web hosting service available\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: No\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nIndustry-leading value for money\n\nIntuitive, easy to use hPanel control panel\n\nExcellent security tools across the board\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nNo high-end hosting options\n\nRenewal prices can be a little high\n\nLow storage limits with shared plans\n\nScore: 4.5/5\n\nHostinger is the best web hosting service currently available. It's also our pick for the best cloud hosting, the best web hosting for small business, the best VPS cloud hosting, the best WordPress hosting, the best VPS hosting, and the best free web hosting (via 000webhost).\n\nIt relies on its own technology, and doesn't let third parties have a say in performance, feature management, or control. Customers can choose between three cloud, three shared, six VPS, and two email plans. It also offers cPanel, WordPress and Minecraft hosting, in addition to CyberPanel VPS hosting, and includes the Zyro website builder with all plans.\n\nHostinger offers great hosting at a fraction of the price of many competitors, and the native hPanel control panel is a standout feature we'd argue is as good as (if not better than) cPanel, the industry standard. Streamlined SSL setup, a full CloudFlare CDN integration, and other top features combine with excellent performance metrics to keep it at the top.\n\nRead our comprehensive Hostinger review.\n\nHostinger's shared hosting plans\n\n*This is the annual cost of a four-year subscription. Expect to pay significantly more per year for shorter subscription terms.\n\nWP Engine\n\nThe best hosting for experienced WordPress users\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: No\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nAutomatic daily backups\n\nIntegrated WordPress website builder\n\nDevelopment and staging environments\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nMay be overwhelming for beginners\n\nLimited storage for multiple websites\n\nScore: 4.5/5\n\nWP Engine's powerful managed WordPress hosting is aimed at developers, with automated backups, integrated development, and staging environments building on high performance.\n\nWhile not cheap, its tools are market-leading, though it can be harder to get to grips with for first-timers. It's best suited to those with site creation or WordPress development experience aiming for scalable, flexible sites. All plans include 10 professionally-designed themes and a simple, block-based WordPress site builder, while automatic site and staging environment back-ups are simple to set up.\n\nEach site includes development, staging, and production environments, allowing you to test changes; try out new code; upload and make live changes; and get feedback from collaborators. A built-in CDN improves performance too, while single sign-on makes using the service seamless.\n\nPricing-wise, WP Engine offers two plans: Managed WordPress for business sites, and eCommerce Solutions for online stores (Advanced Solutions are available for enterprises on request). Both have Startup, Professional, Growth, Scale, and Dedicated levels, with storage, bandwidth, and other elements increasing with price.\n\nSites share storage and bandwidth, with monthly or annual payments accepted (the latter offers a 17% discount). While not the cheapest, the level of features you get with WP Engine is second-to-none for experienced WordPress site builders and developers, offering tools for scaling up sites and ensuring continued smooth performance.\n\nRead our full WP Engine review.\n\nWP Engine’s pricing plans\n\nHostwinds\n\nThe best web hosting for dedicated plans\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: Yes\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nExcellent performance\n\nDecent support resources\n\nA great selection of hosting products\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nSSL installation can be confusing\n\nPrices could be clearer\n\nScore: 4.5/5\n\nHostwinds is the master of dedicated hosting, boasting powerful configurations catering to both regular sites and high-demand, resource-draining gaming servers. It also provides shared, business, VPS (for Linux and Windows, managed and unmanaged), and cloud hosting.\n\nThis highly customisable provider offers several base options you can tailor to your own needs. Even its cheapest dedicated packages come with a four-core single processor and 8GB RAM. In fact, its range of unlimited features across plans means it's the best unlimited web hosting provider, in our opinion.\n\nAdditional features include various RAID configuration options, and a Weebly builder for free. All plans include full server management, so you can relax and not worry about sysadmin: ideal for less tech-savvy users. It also provides server monitoring and nightly backups, and guarantees to never throttle traffic thanks to a 1Gbps network link available to all users, regardless of what bandwidth option they’ve selected.\n\nWe had a bone to pick on a couple of matters — SSL certificate installation could be clearer, and pricing could be less confusing — but excellent performance and plans more than make up for these issues.\n\nRead our full Hostwinds review.\n\nHostwinds' shared hosting plans\n\n*We’ve listed the standard prices here. Expect to receive a discount of up to 50% for your first billing cycle.\n\nCloudways\n\nThe best cloud hosting provider\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: No\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nAttractive PAYG pricing model\n\nA selection of different cloud hosting networks\n\nExcellent performance with even the cheapest plans\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nNo domain registration services\n\nSometimes confusing native control panel\n\nScore: 4.5/5\n\nCloudways offers extremely flexible, pay-as-you-go plans across different cloud infrastructure networks. A strong focus on security includes dedicated firewalls and DDoS attack protection, advanced bot detection, 2FA, and automatic patching.\n\nOther top features include a custom PHP app automatic installer for WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, and other services, as well as a proprietary Breeze WordPress caching plugin to reduce page load times. All plans offer 24/7 real-time monitoring, free SSL certificates and site migrations, 24/7/365 support, unlimited app installations, and automatic backups.\n\nOther add-ons are available for extra customisation, and its performance is among the best we've tested for, with 100% uptime during our testing period, and great average server response times too.\n\nPricing is a little complicated. as you can choose subscriptions from five networks: DigitalOcean, Linode, VULTR, AWS, and Google Cloud. Some are separated into Standard and Premium plans. Hourly and monthly payments are available, but there are no long-term discounts. You're not locked-in, so can cancel at any time, while a free trial lets you see what it offers before you pay.\n\nRead out comprehensive Cloudways review.\n\nCloudways’ cloud hosting plans\n\n*Significant discounts are available with longer-term subscriptions, and you may be required to pay more on renewal.\n\nGreenGeeks\n\nThe best eco-friendly web hosting platform\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes (not by phone)\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nLeading eco-friendly hosting services\n\nGreat value for money\n\nData centres in the US, Europe, and Canada\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nComplicated price structure\n\nThe support site is a little basic\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nGreenGeeks is dedicated to eco-friendly hosting, proclaiming itself as the \"world’s #1 green energy web hosting provider\". These aren’t just empty words: its 300% energy offset scheme means that for every amperage pulled from the grid, it invests three times that in renewable energy.\n\nThat said, its offering is bland at best, but shared hosting does stand out, while it also provides WordPress, VPS, and reseller hosting. Features include unlimited resources — web storage, bandwidth, databases, and email — Cloudflare CDN integration, the Softaculous app installer, shared SSL, LSCache, nightly backups, and a free domain for a year.\n\nPrices aren’t hefty either, with a three-year deal on its Lite packages costing only £2.42 a month, which increases to £8.98 a month. This is best for small sites and blogs that are just getting started, as it only covers one site.\n\nIf your needs are greater, you can pick Pro at £4.97 a month (increasing to £13.41 a month after the initial period), offering twice the performance; or Premium at £9.15 a month (which renews at £21.81 a month), for four times the power, a free dedicated IP, and a free premium SSL.\n\nAll packages are covered by a 30-day money-back guarantee, and a user-friendly Weebly website builder is available via separate plans starting from £2.08 a month. There's also a phone line if you need direct contact with customer support.\n\nRead our detailed GreenGeeks review.\n\nGreenGeek's shared hosting plans\n\n*GreenGeeks offers monthly, annual, biannual, and triannual billing with its shared hosting products. Monthly prices decrease with longer subscription terms.\n\nSiteGround\n\nThe best web hosting for feature-packed plans\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nLoads of advanced features\n\nData centres across the world\n\nOptions for businesses of all sizes\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nOn the expensive side\n\nServer response times a little slow\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nSiteGround's capabilities and wealth of hosting features and tools help it stand out among competitors, maintaining quality at the expense of higher prices. Offering a simple, guided setup, the host offers a well-designed native management dashboard alongside the aforementioned range of hosting elements.\n\nThese include, but are not limited to, management tools, advanced developer integrations, a wide range of sophisticated security elements, a domain registration portal, a full staging environment, app and integration marketplace, and the SuperCacher tool for advanced caching capabilities.\n\nIf there's a downside at all, it's that its performance was surprisingly middling compared to other top-level hosts, but it should be noted that it performed far better than the average, and a 99.99% uptime figure adds increased confidence.\n\nIts costs are higher than you might expect, with three shared plans starting from £2.99 a month but increasing to £11.99 a month after the first year. Despite that steep increase, bear in mind that all plans are managed, and a wealth of its tools and add-ons are included in the price where other hosts would charge extra.\n\nRead our full SiteGround review.\n\nSiteGround’s shared hosting pricing plans\n\nNamecheap\n\nThe best cheap and unlimited hosting provider\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: Yes (on Plus plan)\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nSome of the lowest prices we’ve seen\n\ncPanel control panel\n\nHighly configurable VPS solutions\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nLimited advanced tools or features\n\nVery poor shared hosting performance\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nNamecheap focuses on providing affordable services without cutting corners on quality. It certainly succeeds, as you’ll see if you purchase one of its more advanced packages across WordPress, reseller hosting, VPS, and dedicated servers. The Site Maker website builder is also available for simpler sites, on separate monthly or annual plans.\n\nIts cheapest shared hosting plan, at only £1.84 a month (£1.58 a month for the two-year plan), doesn’t get you much — only 20GB storage and 30 email accounts. However, it's a real bargain, and includes free CDN support, one domain name, and coverage for three websites.\n\nIncrease to £2.68 a month (£2.42 a month for the two-year plan) and you’ll get access to unrestricted SSD storage, unlimited websites, and auto-backups. At £4.19 a month (£3.77 a month for the two-year plan), you’ll receive 50GB SSD, cloud storage that guarantees zero interruptions, ultimate stability, and top-notch data protection.\n\nAs well as a 99.9% uptime guarantee and above-average speeds, Namecheap is beginner-friendly, and does its best to ease you in with helpful information in its welcoming email, alongside a huge online knowledge base.\n\nRead our full Namecheap review.\n\nNamecheap's shared hosting plans\n\n*This price only applies to the first year of your subscription, and renewal prices will be significantly higher.\n\nLiquid Web\n\nThe best managed hosting service\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: No\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nExcellent high-end option for larger businesses\n\nLeading uptime and performance metrics\n\nFriendly, knowledgeable support services\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nQuite expensive\n\nNo budget hosting options\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nLiquid Web does an excellent job of providing various expert managed hosting services for all types of users and requirements. These range from WordPress and email to WooCommerce, dedicated, VPS and cloud hosting, and its capabilities shine.\n\nTake its WordPress solution as an example — you get automated WordPress and plugin updates, applied first in an isolated environment to avoid any potential problems affecting you later, before being forwarded to your site.\n\nData centres run entirely on managed hardware and network infrastructure allow Liquid Web to provide a wide variety of powerful features. These include a professional-level virus and spam defense system, deep system monitoring, key software installation, updates, support, and free external migrations.\n\nVia its WordPress plugins add-on option, Liquid Web also offers you the ability to create WordPress sites. Its incredibly expedient and professional customer support is the cherry on top, and while it doesn't come cheap, good things rarely do, this provider certainly justifying the cost.\n\nRead our full Liquid Web review.\n\nLiquid Web's managed WordPress hosting plans\n\n*Monthly prices for managed WordPress plans double after the first six months\n\nHostGator\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: Yes\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nCompetitive introductory prices\n\n45-day money-back guarantee\n\nFast, helpful live chat support\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nVery average security features\n\nHigh renewal prices\n\nBasic VPS and dedicated server options\n\nScore: 3.5/5\n\nHostGator is one of the best web hosts whose trump card has “budget” written all over it. Several plans are available for each and every pocket and project, with two shared hosting plans — Hatchling and Baby — offering attractive features such as unmetered bandwidth and disk space, support for FTP and email accounts, MYSQL databases and subdomains.\n\nYou'll also enjoy cPanel-based website management, and £125 of Google and Bing Ads credits. Hosting comes with guarantees relating to 99.9 percent uptime and a 45-day money-back period. It also offers the Gator Website Builder as a separate subscription, a drag-and-drop editor packaged with a free domain, unmetered storage and bandwidth, and free SSL certificate.\n\nOther hosting offered includes WordPress, dedicated, VPS, and reseller packages. One main drawback HostGator is guilty of, like other budget providers, is that its cheapest plan covers only one site. Its security is not great either, especially compared to the competition. However, this is hardly a cause of alarm when the next plan up costs only a fraction more, and will hardly leave a dent in your budget.\n\nRead our full HostGator review.\n\nHostGator’s shared hosting plans\n\n*Introductory prices are quoted, rates will increase significantly on renewal.\n\nBluehost\n\nThe best feature-rich shared hosting\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nFeature-rich shared hosting plans\n\nBeginner-friendly cPanel control panel\n\nImpressive 24/7 support\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nDeceptive introductory prices\n\nUnderpowered VPS and dedicated server plans\n\nScore: 3.5/5\n\nBluehost offers affordable yet effective shared hosting, with a variety of plans and options to suit most businesses. However, check pricing going forward, as it's not always clear how much you'll pay on renewal.\n\nIt offers managed and unmanaged WordPress, shared, dedicated, and VPS hosting. You can also sign up for a drag-and-drop WordPress website builder, available as part of a great number of the hosting packages and on its own via two plans.\n\nWe like that there are plenty of customer support options available, on the off-chance you need help or things go wrong. An inexpensive host that doesn’t skimp too much on features, Bluehost offers consistency despite having comparatively fewer features than many others.\n\nIt also has a range of potentially useful add-ons for search engine optimisation and pay-per-click advertising management, making it a solid choice for those willing to pay a little more for good support. Its performance does let it down on cheaper plans, however.\n\nRead our full Bluehost review.\n\nBluehost's shared hosting plans\n\n*Monthly payments aren’t available, so the monthly prices shown are derived from the price of a subscription with a one-year term. Prices will increase significantly after your initial subscription.\n\nDreamHost\n\nThe best web hosting for email plans\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes (except live chat)\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nExcellent prices\n\n97-day money-back guarantee\n\n100% uptime guarantee\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nEmail costs extra on basic plan\n\nLimited one-click app install options\n\nScore: 3.5/5\n\nDreamHost offers the full gamut of hosting packages at competitive prices, ranging from shared to VPS, managed and unmanaged WordPress, dedicated, and cloud hosting.\n\nWith top performance, its straightforward packages are stuffed with value-adding features, and it has a strong focus on privacy and security that's not often seen as much across web hosting as it should be. However, it doesn't include any top-level marketing tools, and with all servers US-based, it's not ideal for customers in other regions.\n\nFor email hosting, it's the top pick, with some very reasonable rates. Monthly plans cost £1.66 per mailbox, while the annual subscription will set you back just £1.40 per mailbox. Plans come with 25GB storage, email syncing between desktop and mobile, and handy webmail software, regardless of whether you've chosen a monthly or annual subscription.\n\nTo make sure all emails are not just spam-free, but also protected against malware and viruses, its smart anti-spam filter adapts to all new threats. What's key to note here is that every DreamHost web hosting plan, except for its Remixer Standard and the Shared Starter plan, includes email hosting for free.\n\nIf you're looking to keep everything in-house, a drag-and-drop WordPress website builder is also available from £2.16 a month.\n\nRead our full Dreamhost review.\n\nDreamHost's shared hosting plans\n\n* Undiscounted monthly rates\n\n** Undiscounted one-year rates\n\nInMotion Hosting\n\nThe best reseller hosting platform\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes\n\nUnmetered storage: No\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nReliable\n\nIntuitive WordPress site builder\n\nUS-based support\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nPoor performance\n\nCheapest plans lack features\n\nScore: 3/5\n\nInMotion Hosting is a web hosting veteran, and it's easy to see why, as it offers a long list of features, bundles and pricing plans for every user and budget. Starting with shared hosting, it also offers WordPress, VPS, and dedicated packages.\n\nThese come with access to a dedicated team of professionals, who offer high-level support at any time. What separates InMotion from the crowd is its propensity to offer bonus features at no extra charge, including protection from DDoS attacks and malware, email spam shield, and an option for the creation of functional backups.\n\nHosting is powered by cPanel and Softaculous platforms, which act as its seals of quality. All of this is easily checked within a 90-day guarantee period, more than enough time in which to make up your mind. However, its performance is poor on the cheaper packages, and not much improved on more expensive plans.\n\nYou can refer friends to earn a year of free hosting, while a website builder from BoldGrid is available if you want to build and host your site together.\n\nRead our full InMotion review.\n\nInMotion Hosting's reseller hosting plans\n\n*After introductory offers expire\n\nDomain.com\n\nThe best budget-conscious hosting for beginners\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nUnmetered bandwidth: Yes (scalable)\n\nUnmetered storage: Yes\n\n24/7 support: Yes\n\nREASONS TO BUY\n\nAffordable shared hosting plans\n\nExcellent performance\n\n24/7 customer support\n\nREASONS TO AVOID\n\nNo VPS or dedicated hosting options\n\nDoesn’t offer cPanel software\n\nScore: 3/5\n\nDomain.com is among the more cost-effective and reliable of the hosting providers featured here, with shared hosting attracting the most attention. The Basic plan includes unlimited storage and plenty of bandwidth, albeit for only one site.

The quicker your page loads, the quicker you can catch a visitor’s attention, keep them interested, and potentially convert them into a customer. Your search engine rankings will also improve with faster loading speeds.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, reliability and uptime are key factors too - the better the host’s uptime pledge, the more insurance you have to know that your site will remain online, and that the host can be relied upon to keep it live, responsive, and error free.\n\nLeading web hosts offer industry-leading technical support, meaning that whether you’re a relative novice or an old hand with web development, they have experts on hand to guide you through or fix the biggest issues your site might face.\n\nAs well as utilising domain-associated email addresses via your host (for example, john@yourdomain instead of a Gmail or iCloud address), you can take advantage of site backups made by your host, so you can quickly get back online and recover data if the worst happens.\n\nWeb hosting offers your website improved security, as not only are physical data centres highly secure, but firewalls, automatic installations of anti-malware, virus, and spam software - alongside security plugins - help keep your site protected.\n\nWeb hosting FAQs\n\nLooking to learn more about web hosting? Take a look at our frequently asked questions below, which tackle some of the most common queries around web hosting, and will help you understand what benefits you can expect from web hosting for your business website.\n\nWhat is web hosting?\n\nWeb hosting allows you to lease online server space where your site's content is hosted (images, videos, or text). When visited by a user, all of these resources are loaded onto their device from your host's server.\n\nWhat are the different types of web hosting?\n\nShared hosting sees you share resources on a server with other users, won’t cost much, and will offer decent service, but can affect loading speeds. Virtual private servers (VPS hosting) mimic dedicated servers in a shared environment, giving you your own storage and hosting space.\n\nIf you need huge levels of devoted resources, dedicated hosting is the way to go. Consider service-level agreements defining commitments on uptime guarantees, support hours, response times, security levels, and compensation when these aren’t met.\n\nCloud hosting offers flexibility and scalability, and doesn’t require as much infrastructure or space. In comparing managed vs unmanaged hosting, managed hosting takes charge of administrative tasks, so you can focus on business; unmanaged is ideal for those with more experience.\n\nWordPress hosting mainly focuses on managed hosting. Sites are often migrated too, and when comparing web hosting vs WordPress hosting, there are similarities but also stark differences.\n\nAnonymous hosting helps protect privacy, as you don't have to provide personal, identifying information. Sign up via a pseudonym and/or email, and pay with an anonymous method, to reduce the risk of breaches.\n\nHow much does the best web hosting cost?\n\nThe cost of hosting your website can vary wildly depending on what type you require. For basic sites which aren’t expecting high levels of traffic, shared hosting is more than adequate: costs start very low, on average around $2.49 a month.\n\nWith more specialised, expansive hosting, the scale and costs rise from VPS hosting via shared servers, up to cloud hosting, and dedicated servers. VPS is a little more expensive than shared; cloud hosting is parcelled out via pay-as-you-use pricing; and dedicated servers for high-traffic, high-performance sites will see you pay in advance of $80 a month.\n\nWhat’s worth noting is that while cheap web hosting looks ideal, introductory rates are often for the first year only. Make sure to read the fine print, because many services increase rates substantially after that first term.\n\nWhich web hosting is better? Paid or free?\n\nThe short answer is paid hosting. The best cheap web hosting is perfectly suitable for a personal site or blog, but businesses require a more complex platform, so don't cut corners. Paid services will typically provide an SSL certificate, which shows visitors your business is serious and trustworthy. You’ll also get more bandwidth and storage space, not to mention necessary backups.\n\nHow to choose the best web hosting\n\nWhen choosing from the best web hosting services, there are common features to be aware of and mistakes to avoid. Free hosting is fine for hobby sites or blogs, but large business sites need serious power and substantial investment. Always read the fine print: if a full price isn’t displayed (usually crossed out by the discounted price), it'll show during payment. Take advantage of introductory discounts, as cheap shared hosting can offer unlimited bandwidth, sites, or storage. Also consider how much support you’ll need.\n\nHow we review the best web hosting services\n\nWhen we review the best web hosting providers, we test response times and uptimes, as these are integral to site performance. If a builder's included, we'll test out the building process; if not, we'll examine another key feature. We also look at how web security stands up, and at how responsive customer service teams are. Finally, we look at pricing in-depth, as many packages can be very confusing, with large initial term discounts. Each in-depth review compares a host to competitors too, providing as much information as we can to help you choose.\n\nYour next steps with web hosting\n\nIf you're looking to find out more about types of hosting, or various providers, it's worth comparing the best unlimited web hosting, and the best VPS hosting, and the best web hosting for small business."
