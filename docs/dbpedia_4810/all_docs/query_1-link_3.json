Usually, these are the images uploaded on the website, which after a transfer stop showing on the website’s pages.\n\nTo resolve this problem, convert the files to UTF-8. To do that you must first find their current encoding.\n\nLog in your account via SSH and navigate to the folder where the files are located and then run the following command:\n\nfile -i *\n\nThis will list all files in the current directory and show their encoding, for example:\n\nusername@server [~/public_html]# file -i * ������_����.txt: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-5\n\nThe value of the charset parameter is the current encoding of the files. In this case, it is iso-8859-5.\n\nIf you cannot see the files with their proper names while logged in your account via SSH, add the following lines in the ~/.bashrc file:\n\nexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\n\nTo modify the file use SSH, FTP or Site Tools > Site > File Manager.\n\nNow that you know the exact encoding the files are using, convert them to UTF-8 using the convmv utility. First, you must download and extract it by using this command:\n\nwget https://www.j3e.de/linux/convmv/convmv-2.01.tar.gz; tar -xzf convmv-2.01.tar.gz\n\nThen to convert the files execute this command:\n\n./convmv-2.01/convmv --notest -r -f iso-8859-5 -t UTF-8 ."
