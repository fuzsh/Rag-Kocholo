SiteGround will allow you to set up a domain name for your website.\n\nYou’ll have two options in this step. Either you can purchase a new domain name, or use a domain name that you’ve already acquired.\n\nIf you’re going to purchase a new domain name, then it will cost you $15.95 per month on this platform.\n\nTo purchase a domain name, simply enter the name for your site on the text box. Also, don’t forget to set the required extension for your domain name.\n\nIn the above image, you can see a lot of domain extensions varying according to countries, purpose, and so on.

You need to provide your Card Number, Expiration Date, Cardholder Name, and CVV Code.

If yes, then you need to uncheck the tick mark shown in this above image.\n\nAfter doing that, you can see some more text boxes. You need to provide your current billing address and contact number. Then, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 6: Verification and Extra Features\n\nYou can now verify your purchase information.

We opt to purchase domain registration from SiteGround, so there’s a tick mark for this option. Other services that you can buy are Domain Privacy and SG Site Scanner.\n\nStep 7: Agree to Terms and Conditions\n\nIn this final step, you simply need to read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of SiteGround.
