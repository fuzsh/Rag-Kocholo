After migrating, the images are all linking to unviewable image folders instead of the images in the media library. The files are there in the media library and the posts and pages are there though.\n\nI migrated the site using **xml **files and the built in importer. The original wordpress.com site is still active, so it did in fact download the images and they are in the correct folders in the media library. On the original wordpress.com site, the images on posts and pages link like this:\n\nhttps://mywebsite.com/2023/08/02/thisisthepostname/thisistheimagename/\n\nMost of the images are in gallery blocks but not all of them. The featured images work correctly for some reason.\n\nBut now, when this format is used on SIteground, the thumbnails are broken and if I click on the gallery links I get:\n\n\"Oops! That page can't be found.\"\n\nI have noticed that when I edit the resolution for the galleries, it fixes the issue, but this is a lot of work to do one by one"
