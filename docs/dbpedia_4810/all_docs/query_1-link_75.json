        "text": "Do you want to rename images and media files in WordPress?\n\nImage file names can improve your SEO and help potential customers and visitors find your content. However, by default, WordPress doesn’t allow you to change an image’s file name after uploading it.\n\nIn this article, we will show you how to easily rename images and media files in WordPress.\n\nWhy Rename Images and Media File Names in WordPress?\n\nMany popular search engines let users search for images. This means that interesting, helpful, or eye-catching images can often increase your blog traffic.\n\nHowever, search engines need to understand what your images are about so they can show them to the right people at the right time.\n\nUsing meaningful, descriptive file names is a big part of image SEO. For example, a file name like new-york-skyline.jpg gives the search engines more information than DSC00789.jpg.\n\nWhile WordPress lets you change the image caption and alt tag, it doesn’t let you change the file name after uploading.\n\nThis is a problem if you find new keywords and want to add them to your images, you used an unhelpful file name by accident, or you are uploading files directly from your phone.\n\nHaving said that, let’s take a look at how to easily rename images and media files in your WordPress blog.\n\nHow to Easily Rename Images and Media Files Using a Plugin\n\nThe easiest way to rename media files in WordPress is by using Phoenix Media Rename. This plugin allows you to rename media files without leaving the WordPress admin area.\n\nThe plugin will also update the file name for any images you’ve used in posts or pages. This can save you a lot of time and effort.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is install and activate Phoenix Media Rename. For more details, see our step-by-step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin.\n\nUpon activation, simply go to Media » Library. If the library shows the grid view, then you’ll need to switch to the list view by clicking on the list icon.\n\nWordPress will now show more information about each media file, including its name.\n\nSimply hover your mouse over the image you want to rename on your WordPress website, and then click on the ‘Edit’ link when it appears.\n\nThis will open the image in your WordPress media edit screen. From here, you can optimize your images by changing the image alt text, caption, and more.\n\nScroll down to the bottom, and you’ll see a new ‘Filename’ field.\n\nFrom here, you can change the file name. We recommend using a meaningful name that describes the image and adding any relevant keywords. It’s also a good idea to use all lowercase letters and add dashes in between words.\n\nAfter that, simply click on the ‘Update’ button to save your changes. You will also see that the file name part of your file URL has also been changed.\n\nLearn More Ways to Manage Your WordPress Files\n\nBesides renaming file names, here are more ways you can organize your files in the media library:\n\nHow to Organize WordPress Files in Media Library Folders\n\nHow to Add Categories and Tags to WordPress Media Library\n\nHow to Clean Up Your WordPress Media Library\n\nHow to Easily Organize Media Uploads by Users in WordPress\n\nGreat WordPress Plugins for Managing Images (Updated)\n\nHow to Connect Google Drive to Your WordPress Media Library\n\nHow to Change the Default Media Upload Location in WordPress\n\nWe hope this article helped you learn how to easily rename images and media files in WordPress.
