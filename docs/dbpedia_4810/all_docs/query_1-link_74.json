        "text": "Adding/Uploading PDFs\n\nPreparing your PDF document for upload\n\nEnsure that you have prepared your PDF document carefully in advance. PDF documents can be created using many different software packages.\n\nYour PDF document should ideally be optimised for web use (as opposed to print). This will provide quicker loading for your users. There are plenty of free websites which offer compression services such as:\n\nwww.docfly.com/compress-pdf\n\nwww.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf\n\nwww.pdf2go.com/compress-pdf\n\neasypdf.com/compress-pdf\n\nwww.cleverpdf.com/compress-pdf\n\nWe recommend that the filename is relatively short and should avoid including any unusual characters (especially apostrophes). Otherwise the server may reject their upload.\n\nWhen your document is prepared and ready to be added to your website, follow the steps below.\n\nThe steps to follow will depend on whether your website uses the newer Block Editor or the old Classic Editor. If unsure, check this with your website administrator.\n\nFor websites using the (newer) Block Editor:\n\nFirst upload your PDF files to the Media Library\n\n1. Log into WordPress and select ‘Media’ in the left sidebar.\n\n2. Click the ‘Add new’ button.\n\n3. Select your file to upload or drag the files into the ‘Drop files to upload’ box.\n\n4. With your PDF file uploaded, select it and in the Attachment details pop-up box, select the ‘Copy URL to clipboard’ button. The URL (address) for your uploaded PDF is now on the your computer’s ‘clipboard’.\n\nAdding the link to your page or post\n\n1. Edit the page or post where your PDF link is required.\n\n2. Select the text which you would like to link to your PDF document and select the link button in the toolbar above. TIP: your link text should be appropriate to the linked document – avoid linking text such as ‘click here’.\n\n3. In the link box, paste in the URL of your PDF document (which should still be on your clipboard). For PDF links, we recommend turning in the ‘Open in a new tab’ option. This allows visitors to easily return to your website after reading your PDF.\n\n4. Select the ‘submit’ button to finish adding the link (showing an arrow).\n\n5. Finally Update your page or post and we recommend checking it by viewing the page as a visitor and testing it.\n\nNote that images can also be linked to PDFs, by selecting the image and selecting the same ‘Insert link’ button, as for text, with similar options available. WordPress buttons work in a similar way too.\n\nFor websites using the (older) Classic Editor:\n\nIf your website uses the Classic Editor, you can either upload your PDFs to the Media Library first (see above) or you can upload them when editing the page (as detailed below).\n\nEdit the page or post where your PDF link is required.\n\nLocate your cursor precisely where the text link will be placed (but don’t type any text).\n\nClick the Add Media button (above the editing toolbar buttons).\n\nClick Select Files or drag your PDF file into the dotted box. Your PDF document will be imported into the WordPress Media library.\n\nOnce the uploading/crunching process has completed, enter the text you require (for the link on the page) in the Title box.\n\nUnder ATTACHMENT DISPLAY SETTINGS choose Link To Media File. This ensures that text added to your post will link to the file you have just uploaded.\n\nClick the Insert into Page/Post button\n\nDon’t forget to press the Update or Publish button to finish.\n\nSetting the PDF to open in a new browser tab (Classic Editor)\n\nIt’s often preferred that the PDF loads up in a new browser tab, so the user can easily return to your web page afterwards. To set this:\n\nClick anywhere within your linked text.\n\nClick the Edit button (pencil icon).\n\nClick the Link options button (cog icon).\n\nTick ‘Open link in a new tab’ and click Update.\n\nUpdate the page or post to finish.\n\nLinking images to PDFs (Classic Editor)\n\nImages can also link to PDF documents and can create a more visible link than text. As before, ensure you’ve uploaded your PDF to the Media Library and copy the URL to your computer’s clipboard.\n\nInsert the image (if not already added). Select the image and press the Edit button (pencil icon).\n\nUnder DISPLAY SETTINGS, set ‘Link To’ to Custom URL.\n\nPaste the URL of your PDF into the box underneath. If you would like the PDF opened in a new tab, tick the appropriate box under ADVANCED OPTIONS.\n\nTo finish, click Update. Lastly, update the page or post."
