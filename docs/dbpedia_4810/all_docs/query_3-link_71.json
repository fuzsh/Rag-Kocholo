        "text": "Image Compression\n\nWe will resize your images to decrease the space they occupy and the time needed for each image to load. The dimensions of your images will not change and with our improved resizing algorithm the visual change in quality is practically non-detectable.\n\nYou can use the Preview button to test with a single image how the compression works and choose the most appropriate compression level for you.\n\nThis will open a new window where you can use our default picture or upload your own with which you can see how the different compression levels affect the quality of the image.\n\nBy using the Edit button you can then set the desired compression level and whether you want for us to create a backup of your images before compressing them. Note that depending on the number of images on your website the process may take a while.\n\nUse WebP Images\n\nWebP is a next generation image format supported by modern browsers which greatly reduces the size of standard image formats while keeping the same quality. Reduced image size means faster web page loading speeds, so we strongly recommend you enable this feature.\n\nLazy Load Media\n\nThis option makes your images load only when they are about to become visible to your visitors and not in the initial loading process for your page. By switching on the this option, the gravatars (really useful for posts with many comments, where hundreds of requests might be needed just to load the gravatars of your comment authors), thumbnails, responsive images, widgets, and mobile will be lazy loaded.\n\nYou can also exclude specific CSS classes and media types from the Lazy Load functionality.\n\nMaximum Image Width\n\nIf youâ€™re often uploading or using large images on your website, you might want to start resizing images to fit a maximum width. This can reduce the images size up to 80% and dramatically increase loading speed on pages with one or more large images. Enabling this will resize your future images whose width exceeds 2560 px."
