I have my navbar using href = \"fileName.html\" to navigate the page. This leads the URL to become www.\"siteName\".com/\"fileName.html\" once navigating off the homepage.\n\nThis is what I have so far in my .htaccess to remove the .html from the end:\n\nOptions -MultiViews RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\\.[^./]+)$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f RewriteRule (.*) $1.html [L] <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\\.html$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l RewriteRule . /index.html [L] </IfModule>\n\nThis does not seem to be working. Should I change my .htaccess file? Should I change the way my navbar navigates the pages?"
