You can either choose the default identity or create a new one.\n\nUnder the Signature section, click the HTML icon and enter the desired information in the Signature field. You have two options to add an image to your signature:\n\nUse the Insert/edit image in the Signature field. To show the button, first click the three dots (Moreâ€¦), which will expand the available buttons and show the Insert/edit image. In this tool, you can upload an image from your computer, or specify the image URL location (e.g. http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg).\n\nAlternatively, you can drag and drop the image URL from your browser to the Signature field.\n\nFinally, save the changes, and the image of your choice will appear when you compose your messages."
