We use product data, strategic methodologies and expert insights to inform all of our content and guide you in making the best decisions for your business journey.\n\nWe reviewed multiple services using a detailed methodology to help you find the 10 best dedicated hosting services for small businesses. Our ratings consider factors, such as transparent pricing, bandwidth, storage, uptime, server locations and customer reviews. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nBest Overall\n\nMochaHost\n\n4.2\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n100%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nTwo*\n\nRAM\n\n4GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn MochaHost's Website\n\n100%\n\nTwo*\n\n4GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nMochaHost offers multiple dedicated hosting plans that are affordable and packed with features and extras. For Linus servers, the Lungo Linux I plan costs normally costs $39 per month but is discounted to $19.50 per month during its current promotion. What’s special about this price is that it’s the same whether you pay monthly, yearly or every three years.. The plan includes two CPU core and 4GB of DDR4 memory, along with unlimited bandwidth. There are also two additional Linux plans at higher price points available. MochaHost also offers four unmanaged Windows servers plans that start at $45 per month, reduced by 50% during the current promotion. Although the core allowance is very low for some plans, the pricing evens out the value—MochaHost is much more affordable than its competitors.\n\nIt isn’t easy to figure out exactly what MochaHost offers sometimes because the text-heavy language on its site is so full of marketing jargon. For example, its “Lightning Fast Guarantee” is essentially a CDN and the “NEVER Reboot Protection” is simply automatic updates for your server. Some of the extras you get with MochaHost include free SSL certificates, automatic snapshot backups, migration help and some plans get a free domain for life.\n\nAll of MochaHost’s dedicated hosting plans come with a 100% uptime guarantee and 180-day money-back guarantee, though it’s prorated.\n\nLearn more: Read our full MochaHost review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nAs long as you’re ready to commit to two or three years of dedicated hosting, MochaHost is an excellent choice for a lifetime discount, lots of added features and excellent uptime and loading speed.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable monthly plans\n\nUp to 16 CPU cores\n\nLifetime discounts available\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nFree migration help\n\nCDN included at no charge\n\n180-day prorated money-back guarantee\n\nPricing can be confusing\n\nMarketing-heavy language on outdated site\n\nBest for Low Introductory Rate\n\nIONOS\n\n4.1\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.9%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nEight*\n\nRAM\n\n8GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn IONOS' Website\n\n99.9%\n\nEight*\n\n8GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nIONOS by 1&1 gives new customers a bit of a bargain on managed and unmanaged dedicated server hosting. Low-priced plans start at $32 or $50 per month for unmanaged servers (SSD server comes with 240GB storage, 8GB RAM while HDD server comes with 1TB storage, 12GB RAM). Managed servers start at $70, $75 or $100 per month, depending on SSD or HDD choice.\n\nDespite the hike in price after the introductory term, monthly prices still stay low compared to competitors. You get a respectable set of features too. The unlimited data transfer is limited to 1GB speed, which means virtually no lag for your site visitors. IONOS’ dedicated servers top out at eight cores, though, so there’s a bit less power than other providers on the market. For example, InMotion Hosting offers up to 24 cores on its highest tier.\n\nLearn More: Read our full IONOS review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nAs long as you don’t need generous storage for your sites, IONOS would be an excellent choice for your first dedicated server. It offers a cheap introductory rate with a fair amount of resources.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans\n\nLow six-month intro price starting at $45 per month\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\n24/7 support\n\nPrice increases after six months\n\nLow storage allowances\n\nLow power compared to other hosts\n\nBest for Affordability\n\nInterServer\n\n4.0\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee: 99.9%\n\n99.9%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nTwo*\n\nRAM\n\n32GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nRead Forbes' Review\n\n99.9%\n\nTwo*\n\n32GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nInterServer is one of the most affordable options for dedicated hosting services, although it doesn’t quite beat MochaHost—InterServer’s lowest-priced plans cost $62 per month. They come with 30 GB of memory and eight cores.\n\nThere are no setup fees if you choose InterServer for dedicated hosting. Plus, the web host offers free migration services, so you can move your site from another host seamlessly with help and at no added cost. Although InterServer is a good value for the cost, you won’t find low introductory rates for your first term like most of its competitors.\n\nLearn More: Read our full InterServer review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nInterServer’s low-cost dedicated server packages offer affordable and predictable pricing with generous resources, making it a good pick for anyone who needs a dedicated server.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nVery affordable plans starting at $44 per month\n\nGenerous CPU core allowances\n\n150TB data transfer\n\nNo discounts\n\nLow storage\n\nPricey added storage\n\nBest for Round-the-Clock Support\n\nHostGator\n\n3.7\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.9%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n8GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn HostGator's Website\n\n99.9%\n\nFour*\n\n8GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nIf you anticipate needing the help of support often, HostGator could be a good pick for your dedicated hosting needs. HostGator offers 24/7/365 support by phone and live chat. As far as dedicated servers go, you’ll have your pick between semi-managed or fully managed servers with 8GB to 30GB of RAM. The starter plan gives you 1TB of storage, but on HDD. Bandwidth is unmetered but limited to 10TB of data transfer.\n\nHostGator isn’t by any means cheap dedicated server hosting, but it does offer low prices to start. To get the lowest price possible from HostGator, you’ll have to rely on a new customer discount and pay for three years of service in advance. The regular rate for the low-priced plan is about $91.98 per month for a three-year term. A month-to-month contract costs $161.99.\n\nLearn More: Read our full HostGator review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nHostGator offers fairly standard dedicated hosting services, but it also gives you 24/7 support via live chat or phone, so it’s a good choice for those who need help at all hours.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nDeep introductory discounts\n\nSemi-managed or managed options\n\n24/7 support\n\nSteep price hike after discount ends\n\nNo money-back guarantee\n\nNo choice in server location\n\nBest for Resources\n\nInMotion Hosting\n\n3.7\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.999%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n16GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn InMotion Hosting's Website\n\n99.999%\n\nFour*\n\n16GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nInMotion Hosting caters to both developers and small businesses with unmanaged and managed dedicated server hosting. The introductory rate for unmanaged dedicated servers is $35 per month if paid annually; a managed dedicated server starts at $89.99 per month, paid annually. It’s a pricey service, but we find that it’s still a solid value.\n\nInMotion offers 10TB of data transfer per month, which is generous but doesn’t top InterServer’s 150TB. The starting RAM is twice as much as most hosts, and you get four cores by default. Perhaps the most impressive feature of InMotion is its server uptime guarantee of 99.999%. (You might experience four minutes of downtime per month.) Most hosts only offer 99.9%, which could mean as much as 44 minutes of downtime per month (though MochaHost has a 100% uptime guarantee).\n\nLearn More: Read our full InMotion review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nConsidering the 10TB of bandwidth and 16GB of RAM for the lowest-priced dedicated server, InMotion is a good pick for anyone with a traffic- and resource-heavy website.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nHigh data transfer allowance\n\nNew customer discounts available\n\nHigh uptime guarantee\n\n24/7 support\n\nExpensive plans\n\nUser reviews mention poor customer support\n\nBest for Fully Managed Servers\n\nTMDHosting\n\n3.6\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.99%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n8GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn TMDHosting's Website\n\n99.99%\n\nFour*\n\n8GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nMost dedicated hosting services offer unmanaged and managed servers (unmanaged servers cost a little less), but TMDHosting sticks to fully managed servers only. So, if you want to save a few dollars per month with an unmanaged server, choose one of TMDHosting’s competitors. If you want a managed solution, TMDHosting gives you a lot of assistance with your server.\n\nThe lowest-priced plan costs $79.99 per month and includes four CPU cores, 1TB of storage and 8GB of memory. There’s no cost for setup, and TMDHosting’s experts help with site migration, daily security audits, 24/7 monitoring and you get access to the support team at any hour.\n\nYou can take advantage of server management by having the TMDHosting staff take care of server updates and app and CMS installation. Not only is the support staff available around the clock, but there’s also a 15-minute response time guarantee. TMDHosting servers have a 99.99% uptime guarantee.\n\nLearn More: Read our full TMDHosting review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nIf you don’t mind paying a higher cost for a fully managed server and you want round-the-clock support, TMDHosting could be a good solution for you.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFully managed dedicated servers\n\n24/7 phone and email support\n\n24/7 monitoring\n\nDaily backups\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nVery expensive plans\n\nNo live chat support\n\nBest for Beginners\n\nBluehost\n\n3.3\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\nNone\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nTwo*\n\nRAM\n\n4GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Bluehost's Website\n\nNone\n\nTwo*\n\n4GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nBluehost is one of the most popular hosting services in the industry, so you may be using it now for your own web host. It offers a simple platform and partially managed servers, so it’s one of the most logical choices for beginners who want to move their sites from shared hosting to a dedicated server.\n\nThe Standard plan costs $91.98 per month, paid in full, if you agree to a three-year term (paid upfront). You’ll get two cores, 8GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD storage, which could be suitable for a small site. Rather than offer unlimited bandwidth, Bluehost caps you at 5TB of data transfer.\n\nBluehost gives you a little help with your dedicated server, such as with updates and maintenance, but you also get root access, so you can take control if you want. If you need more help, Bluehost’s support team is available 24/7 and dedicated server customers get dedicated and expedited help from experts.\n\nLearn More: Read our full Bluehost review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nBluehost is an easy-to-use web host that provides partially managed servers, so it’s a good choice for beginners.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPartially managed dedicated servers\n\nFree domain included for first year\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nAverage monthly cost\n\nNo server uptime guarantee\n\nOnly one- and three-year terms available\n\nBest for Custom Plans\n\nSiteGround\n\n3.2\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.9%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n8GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nRead Forbes' Review\n\n99.9%\n\nFour*\n\n8GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nSiteGround breaks from the pack of dedicated server offerings with its cloud hosting options. You can choose from one of four plans (starting at $100 per month) or you create your own plan with the specific resources you need. The Jump Start plan gives you four cores, 8GB RAM, 40GB storage (SSD) and 5TB bandwidth.\n\nTo customize your plan, just use the sliders on the site to increase or decrease cores (up to 33), memory (up to 130GB) and storage (up to 1TB). Your bandwidth remains the same. Pricing goes up as you adjust cores, RAM and storage, of course. It’s worth pointing out that if your site gets some extra traffic, you can add more resources any time to support it.\n\nLearn More: Read our full SiteGround review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nSiteGround is a good choice if you want to create your own plan with customized resources on a cloud server, or if you anticipate needing to up your resources on the fly.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nCreate a custom plan\n\nAffordable starter plan\n\nUses SSD storage\n\nInstantly scale resources any time\n\nFree daily backups\n\nCDN included\n\nNo phone support\n\nProprietary CDN may be slower than Cloudflare\n\nBest for Server Uptime\n\nDreamHost\n\n3.1\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n100%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n4GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn DreamHost's Website\n\n100%\n\nFour*\n\n4GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nDreamHost isn’t the only web host to guarantee 100% server or network uptime, but its guarantee rewards you if or when it fails. For every hour your site is down, DreamHost will credit you for one day’s worth of hosting (up to 10% of total renewal fee). The only downtime you should experience is during scheduled maintenance.\n\nAs far as the managed dedicated servers go, DreamHost is pretty average with a slightly higher-than-average cost. The entry-level plan ($149 per month, paid annually) gives you four cores, 4GB RAM and 1TB of hard drive space. The good news is that DreamHost doesn’t cap data transfer, so it’s essentially unlimited (though you may be asked to upgrade resources if there’s a strain). You have the option to increase your RAM at checkout, so it’s more customizable than most web hosts offer.\n\nLearn more: Read our full DreamHost review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nEveryone wants their website to stay up all the time, but if uptime is the most important aspect of web hosting for you, DreamHost is a good choice.\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\n100% network uptime guarantee\n\nNo bandwidth cap\n\nIncrease RAM at checkout\n\n24/7 server monitoring\n\nHigher cost than industry average\n\nLow RAM on starter plan\n\nBest for Storage Options\n\nGoDaddy\n\n3.0\n\n*Data transfer and RAM figures are based on the lowest priced package.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantee\n\n99.9%\n\nNumber of CPU Cores\n\nFour*\n\nRAM\n\n32GB*\n\nLearn More\n\nOn GoDaddy's Website\n\n99.9%\n\nFour*\n\n32GB*\n\nEditor's Take\n\nGoDaddy is likely best known as a domain registrar, but as a web host, it has expanded what it offers over the years, including dedicated server hosting. It’s Linux SSD server costs $159.99 per month for a one-year term) while a Windows SSD server costs $189.99 per month.\n\nThe only free add-on you get is an SSL certificate and only for the first year. Prices are high for GoDaddy servers and fully managed servers are even more costly (starting at $269.98 per month for one year).\n\nLearn More: Read our full GoDaddy review.\n\nWho Should Use It:\n\nThe best reason to choose GoDaddy is for the storage options if you’re set on lots of storage (HDD) or speedy processing (SSD).\n\n*Based on the lowest-cost plan\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFully managed dedicated servers available\n\nChoice of SSD or HDD storage\n\nFree SSL certificate for your first year\n\n24/7 support\n\nExpensive plans—managed and unmanaged\n\nServer monitoring only on managed plans\n\nLots of pricey add-ons for bare metal servers\n\nForbes Advisor Ratings\n\nWhat Is Dedicated Server Hosting?\n\nAmong the many ways in which you can have a website hosted, dedicated servers provide resources specifically for your site, from storage to RAM to bandwidth so that you aren’t sharing with other customers. These allocated resources make it the most stable, secure and expensive method.\n\nDedicated server hosting is meant more for established businesses that need extra resources to maintain high page load speed and for more media on their sites. It also means you don’t have to worry about other sites suddenly taking up more of the resources on the server, which could induce lag on your own site (and for your site visitors). Some of the best web hosting for small business included dedicated hosting packages.\n\nDedicated Hosting Pros and Cons\n\nSo, how do you know when you need to upgrade to a dedicated server? When you first create a website, you likely don’t have much of an internet footprint. Your site or brand probably doesn’t rank high on search engines, so you don’t get a ton of traffic. That’s why a lot of people start out with shared hosting and then upgrade to a virtual private server (VPS), which simply gives you more resources (but it’s still shared). When a VPS still isn’t enough, that’s when it may be time for you to upgrade to a dedicated server.\n\nPros\n\nReliability: No shared resources means faster performance for your site.\n\nScalability: You can add multiple websites to your server or add more media to your site without noticeable effects. Plus, you can increase resources as needed. This is especially true of cloud hosting, which lets you increase storage or bandwidth yourself at any time.\n\nSecurity: No need to worry about other sites getting hacked or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks launched against others, as you might on shared servers.\n\nIncreased resources: Get more storage and bandwidth on dedicated servers, which gives you the green light to add more media as you need.\n\nDedicated support: Most web hosting services provide dedicated or priority support for dedicated server clients, so you can get your issues resolved quickly.\n\nResell hosting: Some web hosts offer reseller hosting packages or allow you to sell hosting from your dedicated server, which could be a good stream of income (or at least offset the cost of your dedicated hosting).\n\nCons\n\nExpensive: The biggest downside of a dedicated server is that it’s far more expensive than shared and virtual hosting.\n\nMore technical: A fully managed dedicated server won’t require much work on your end, as the hosting service should handle configuration, security and updates for you, but this is more expensive. Unmanaged dedicated servers require you to handle all the technical details, so you’ll need that knowledge.\n\nHow Much Does a Dedicated Server Cost?\n\nThe cost of a dedicated server varies depending on the host you choose, whether you go with fully managed or unmanaged and whether you opt for cloud hosting. The best dedicated server hosting costs $115, on average, per month (billed annually). You can expect to pay about $20 to $50 more per month for a fully managed dedicated server.\n\nMany dedicated server hosts offer discounts on the first month or if you sign a long-term agreement. Signing up for years in advance can be pricey and you’ll be locked into the same web host for a long time, but there’s also typically a longer money-back guarantee if you’re not happy at the start.\n\nHow To Choose the Best Dedicated Hosting Service\n\nThe benefits of a dedicated server may be worth the added cost, so you may not even need to read this section. If you’re on the fence and wondering whether it’s worth increasing your monthly cost tenfold, then you may want to keep reading to see what you’re getting with your own server.\n\nStorage and Bandwidth\n\nA dedicated server gives you 100% of the resources instead of just a slice. With more storage, you can add more products, if you’re running an e-commerce website, which also means more photos and videos. On a shared server, you’re much more limited, but some of the best e-commerce hosting providers make it doable.\n\nYou’ll also get more bandwidth, which means your site visitors shouldn’t see lag when your site pages load. It also means you can accept more visitors at once without any slowdowns or interruptions. Shared servers typically limit this resource so that all clients on the server aren’t affected by traffic spikes.\n\nServer Uptime Guarantees\n\nYou’ve likely seen web hosts boast 99.9% server uptime. That’s nearly 100%, so it has to be good, right? No server is going to be up 24/7. Web hosts have to perform maintenance, and so occasionally servers will be down. Hosts will tell you when the server will be down, and that downtime doesn’t count toward the guarantee.\n\nHowever, if your server is down at any time other than the scheduled maintenance, you’re likely entitled to a portion of your monthly fee back. It’s a good idea to keep an uptime monitor running to either claim the money-back guarantee or see whether it’s worth moving to another host (if there’s too much downtime). After all, if your server isn’t up, no one can visit your site(s).\n\nServer Location\n\nAnother benefit to choosing dedicated hosting is that you can usually choose your server location. This is helpful if you study your site visitor data. If most of your site traffic originates in the Midwest of the United States, you may be able to choose a server in, say, Chicago. Being able to choose your server location can help with site load speed for site visitors.\n\nAlternatively, look for a web host that offers a content delivery network (CDN), which mirrors your site on multiple servers throughout the globe. This cuts down on the time it takes to load your website for visitors that originate in another part of the world.\n\nManaged vs. Unmanaged Dedicated Hosting\n\nMost web hosts offer two options for a dedicated server: unmanaged or managed dedicated server hosting. An unmanaged, or bare metal, server costs less because the host doesn’t maintain the server for you.\n\nChoose an unmanaged server if you don’t mind doing the work. You’ll install a control panel, maintain security, apply patches and maintain updates yourself. Go with a managed server if you want the web host to handle security and maintenance for you—this is a better option if you’ve never performed server maintenance before.\n\nYou may also want to consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to enhance security when logging in to your server. It’s especially helpful to use a VPN when accessing the internet over Wi-Fi. The best VPNs are affordable and easy to use on your desktop or a mobile device.\n\nHDD vs. SSD Storage\n\nA classic HDD is a mechanical hard drive on which you store files. It’s a far cheaper option for personal computers and servers alike. However, an SSD is faster, offers better overall performance and uses less energy and power. So, it comes down to your needs. If you aren’t concerned about speed and want an affordable, large storage option, go with HDD. If price isn’t a concern and you don’t need as much storage, SSD is a better choice.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nBluehost\n\nStarting price\n\n$1.99 per month\n\nStorage Limit\n\nUnmetered bandwidth, SSD storage starts at 10GB\n\nStandout Features\n\nFree domain name & SSL for a year\n\n1\n\nBluehost\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Bluehost.com's Website\n\n2\n\nHostGator\n\nStarting Price\n\n$2.75 per month (for first 36 months)\n\nMoney-Back Guarantee\n\n30 days\n\nStandout Features\n\nFree SSL certificate, free website transfer\n\n2\n\nHostGator\n\nLearn More\n\nOn HostGator's Website\n\n3\n\nWeb.com\n\nStarting price\n\n$2.75 per month\n\nWebsite Building\n\nYes\n\nStandout Features\n\nCustomizable templates, Easy drag-and-drop technology, SSL certificate\n\n3\n\nWeb.com\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Web.com's Website\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose the best dedicated hosting services, we surveyed the field of options and selected 13 companies to analyze. These competitors were scored on 17 criteria across five categories, which were weighted according to their value for small businesses.\n\nHere are the criteria we considered for best dedicated server hosting:\n\nPricing\n\nWe looked at entry-level prices, add-on fees and whether a host offers lower pricing for annual payment. We also took into consideration whether the price goes up after an introductory period. In total, pricing accounted for 30% of the total score.\n\nGeneral Features\n\nWhen upgrading from shared or virtual hosting servers, one should see an increase in storage, RAM and data transfer allowances. We also considered processors and the number of cores available. In addition, every web host should offer an uptime guarantee because having your site(s) online is imperative for any business—downtime equals potentially lost business. These features account for 20% of scoring.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nIn addition to the essential features every dedicated server should offer, we looked at those that go above and beyond. Companies received bonus points for offering a free business email address, a content delivery network (CDN), and automatic backups. These bonuses make up 10% of the final score.\n\nRatings & Reviews\n\nSometimes, reviews can be telling or you take them with a grain of salt. We considered each host’s ratings on several review sites such as G2, Trustpilot, BBB and others and also factored in the number of reviews on each platform. These reviews cover 20% of the ranking.\n\nExpert Score\n\nLastly, we factored in our expert analysis. Although not part of the numerical scoring, server location is important. We ensured each host has multiple servers available, even if you can’t choose your preferred server location. Unlimited or unmetered bandwidth is nice, but on a dedicated server, there’s typically a limit. It should be generous—at least 5TB data transfer per month.
