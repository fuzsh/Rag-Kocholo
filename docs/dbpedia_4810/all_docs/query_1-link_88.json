At first, I was running into an error where I could only build a functional WebGL build if I created a Development Build. Now even that workaround won’t function. I haven’t built a usable WebGL build in months, despite hours of online troubleshooting and retrying. I was hoping somebody here might be willing to help me out.\n\nMy current version is Unity 2021.1.4f1.\n\nMy newest build gave me an error message, shown below (my file is named “WebGL v1”):\n\nI also took a look in Chrome’s developer tools console to investigate the error, shown below:\n\nHere are all of my build settings for WebGL:\n\nAs for the project, it’s a very simple platformer without any special plugins or packages in use. If you have any more questions about my build settings, my setup, or anything else, please let me know!\n\nThanks for taking the time to help\n\nThe root issue here is like the error message is suggesting: the web server that is being used is misconfigured, and does not advertise the\n\nContent-Encoding: br\n\nHTTP response header when serving the files with a .br suffix.\n\nFixing this requires configuring the web server to be able to do network compression. As a workaround if you do not have access to server configuration, you can keep the compression but enable “Compression Fallback”, in which case Unity embeds a Brotli decompressor into the build. This has performance implications but can serve as a functional workaround."
