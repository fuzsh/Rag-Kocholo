        "text": "To change the MediaWiki default logo you should do the following:\n\n1. Create an image for your logo with dimensions of 135×135 pixels.\n\nThe recommended format for the image is .png, but other formats like .gif or .jpeg are also ok. Note that if you upload image with different dimensions it may not be displayed.\n\n2. Upload your logo image somewhere on your web hosting account.\n\nFor example, you can upload it directly in the public_html folder.\n\n3. Add or edit the $wgLogo line in the LocalSettings.php to contain the path to your logo\n\nThe LocalSettings.php file is located under the directory where your MediaWiki is installed. If it is installed directly in the public_html, this file will also be there. If it is installed in a subdirectory of the public_html, the file will be located in the subdirectory.\n\nYou should open the LocalSettings.php and look for a line that starts with $wgLogo. If there is no such line you should add it yourself and if there already is such a line you should edit it to contain the path to your logo. For example, if we suppose that your logo is named logo.png and you have uploaded it directly in the public_html folder the line should look like:\n\n$wgLogo = $wgScriptPath . ‘logo.png’\n\nIf you have uploaded the logo in a subdirectory of your public_html, be sure to paste the whole path. If you have uploaded your logo logo.png in the skins/common/images/ directory the line should look like:\n\n$wgLogo = $wgScriptPath . ‘skins/common/images/logo.png’\n\n4. If you have followed the instructions above and you still do not see your logo, make sure that in the LocalSettings.php the image upload is allowed.\n\nTo do this open the LocalSettings.php file and change the line\n\n$wgEnableUploads = false;\n\nto\n\n$wgEnableUploads = true;"
