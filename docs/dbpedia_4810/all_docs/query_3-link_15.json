        "text": "I’ve created a new site which has 2 pages in it. It was started by using the Astra Theme, complete with it’s images and layout.\n\nI have built a home page and contact page and when I view them from WordPress (that is I am logged in as a WordPress administrator) I see the layout as expected with logo on the top left and menu on the top right.\n\nI can switch from home to the contact page – all is fine.\n\nHowever… If I am not logged in to WordPress then the menu and site logo are not visible, nor are they in the footer which I added. I have tried changing to different themes with the same result. I have run the WordPress from different browsers and I get the same view when in WordPress (Admin) success but no menu when I am not logged into WordPress.\n\nI disabled numerous plugins with no difference. I’m running out of ideas. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis topic was modified 10 months, 3 weeks ago by nitroman2.\n\nHere’s a full-page screenshot of what I see on your homepage: https://i.snipboard.io/S0N1pZ.jpg\n\nIf this is not the new page you expect to see, then you need to flush every caching you’re using on your site. I see references to sg-cachepress in the HTML code on your homepage. I also see x-proxy-cache: HIT in the HTTP response headers on your homepage. Both are indicators that some caching is being done on your website.\n\nThe caching is being provided by the ISP hosting the site (SG). Are you saying that this is the cause for it?\n\nIt’s a common cause.\n\nBut, in your case, there seems to be more going on.\n\nTo dig further into this, kindly provide a screenshot of what you see on the homepage when you’re logged in as admin. I want to see the full address in the browser, so please don’t crop that off.\n\nPost your screenshot here https://snipboard.io/ and add the link in your response.\n\nStanding by.\n\nThanks for the screenshot. It was helpful to see the logo and menu you had been referring to… though that didn’t take us any closer to solving this mystery.\n\nI’m still going back to the cache issue.\n\nThe cache is currently deactivated and I can’t see any references to it anymore.\n\nYou must be referring to the caching plugin.\n\nBut as I mentioned earlier, there’s x-proxy-cache: HIT in the HTTP response headers, indicating some caching is being done by your hosting provider (Siteground), outside of your WordPress environment.\n\nPlease login to your Siteground hosting dashboard, and flush ALL the caching options there… or even temporarily disable them… and let’s see if it makes a difference. You can find your host’s support article on this here: https://world.siteground.com/kb/clear-site-cache/\n\nStanding by."
