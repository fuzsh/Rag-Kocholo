The message appears when you try to upload a file with an extension different than what WordPress allows by default. The default file types allowed are:\n\nImages: .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif, .ico\n\nDocuments: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .psd\n\nAudio: .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav\n\nVideo: .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2\n\nTrying to upload files with extensions outside of the above will result in the “Sorry, you are not allowed to upload this file type.” error.\n\nHow to Avoid Getting The “Sorry, you are not allowed to upload this file type” Error?\n\nChange File Format Before Uploading\n\nTo change the file extension to avoid the “Sorry, You Are Not Allowed to Upload This File Type” error in WordPress, follow the steps below.\n\nOn MacOS – locate the file, right-click, and select “Get Info.” Under “Name & Extension,” edit the file name, including the desired extension. Confirm the change and acknowledge any warning prompts.\n\nOn Windows – find the file, right-click, and choose “Rename.” Modify the file name, ensuring the new extension is appropriate. Windows may ask for confirmation; proceed accordingly. After changing the file extension, consider updating any references within the article or associated metadata. Test the upload functionality on WordPress to ensure the error is resolved.\n\nUpdate The wp-config\n\nTo allow the upload, go to Site Tools > Site > File Manager and edit the wp-config.php file for your WordPress, which is usually found in the public_html folder. Above the line ‘That’s all, stop editing! Happy publishing.‘ insert the following:\n\ndefine('ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true);\n\nSave the changes to the file and you should be able to upload the desired file from your WordPress wp-admin -> Media -> Add New.\n\nFor security reasons it is recommended to remove that new line you added in the wp-config.php after you upload the desired files. If you later want to upload more, you can add the line again."
