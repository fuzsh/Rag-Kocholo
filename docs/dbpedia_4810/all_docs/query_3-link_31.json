However, sometimes, it’s not clear how to make the logo bigger or smaller.\n\nIn this article, we will show you how to easily change the WordPress logo size in any theme.\n\nWhy Change the Size of the Logo in WordPress?\n\nNo matter whether you hire someone to design a custom logo for your WordPress website or design one yourself using a free logo maker, logos are an important part of any website.\n\nHowever, the default WordPress images sizes may not work for your logo.\n\nA logo that’s too small won’t stand out, while a logo that’s too big can distract visitors from the rest of your content.\n\nWhile you can do basic image editing in WordPress, your site’s logo is an important part of your branding so you’ll want to make sure it looks great. That being said, let’s see how you can properly change the logo size in WordPress. Simply use the quick links below to jump to the method you want to use:\n\nMethod 1: Change Logo Size With WordPress Customizer (Recommended)\n\nThe simplest and easiest way to change the logo size in WordPress is by using the theme customizer. However, this method only works if your theme supports additional image sizes in WordPress.\n\nThe good news is that many of the popular themes come with built-in tools for resizing the logo, including Divi, Astra, and Ultra.\n\nNote: Your logo will only ever be as big as the image you upload, so make sure to upload a larger image if you want to make the logo bigger.\n\nIn this guide, we will show you how to change your logo in Divi, Astra, and Ultra themes, but the method is similar for most popular WordPress themes.\n\nEven if we are not covering your specific theme, it’s still worth seeing if you can change the logo size using the WordPress customizer.\n\nSimply go to Appearance » Customize and look for any settings that are labeled Header, Site Identity, Logo, or similar.\n\nIf you don’t see these settings, then you can always check your theme’s documentation or reach out to the developer for help. For more information on this topic, please see our guide on how to properly ask for WordPress support and get it.\n\nIf your theme doesn’t have a built-in logo editor, then you will need to use method 2 or 3.\n\nChange the WordPress Logo Size in Divi WordPress Theme\n\nFirst, go to Divi » Theme Customizer and click on ‘Header & Navigation.’\n\nAfter that, select ‘Primary Menu Bar.’\n\nHere, you can change the size of your logo. For example, you might display it as a full size image.\n\nFirst, you need to adjust the ‘Menu Height’ setting. This controls the height of your entire navigation menu, which will define how big you can make your logo.\n\nAfter that, you can change the ‘Logo Max Height’ setting, which is a percentage of the total menu height.\n\nYou can drag the ‘Logo Max Height’ slider up and down until you find the perfect size for your WordPress blog.\n\nWhen you are happy with how the logo looks, make sure to click on ‘Publish’ before closing the WordPress Customizer.\n\nChange the WordPress Logo Size in Astra WordPress Theme\n\nIf you’re using the Astra theme, then go to Appearance » Customize and click the ‘Header Builder’ menu option.\n\nAfter that, click the ‘Site Title & Logo’ menu option.\n\nHere, you can easily change the size of your logo.\n\nSimply drag the ‘Logo Width’ slider to the left or right to make the logo bigger or smaller.\n\nThe WordPress Customizer will show these changes in its live preview, so you can try different sizes to see what looks the best for your WordPress website.\n\nWhen you are happy with how the logo looks, click ‘Publish’ to make it live on your website.\n\nChange the WordPress Logo Size in Ultra WordPress Theme\n\nTo customize the logo size in the Ultra theme, go to Appearance » Customize, and click ‘Site Logo & Tagline’ in the left-hand menu.\n\nAfter that, click the ‘Site Logo’ dropdown.\n\nWhen it appears, select the ‘Logo Image’ radio button.\n\nNow, you can make the logo bigger or smaller by typing new sizes into the boxes.\n\nYou can change the width using the box on the left and the height using the box on the right.\n\nIf you want to scale the logo based on the original size, then only change the dimensions in one box.\n\nAs you type in new dimensions, the size of the logo will change in real time.\n\nWhen you are happy with how the logo looks, go ahead and click on ‘Publish’ to make your changes live.\n\nMethod 2: Change the WordPress Logo Size Using the Full Site Editor (Block-Based Themes Only)\n\nIf you are using a block-based theme like Hestia Pro, then you can resize images without losing losing quality, using the full site editor.\n\nchange the logo size using the full site editor.\n\nTo get started, just go to Themes » Editor in the WordPress dashboard.\n\nBy default, the full site editor will show your theme’s home template.\n\nTo resize your site’s logo, you will typically select ‘Patterns.’\n\nThe editor will now show a list of all the patterns and template parts that make up your theme.\n\nSimply click on the Header option, which controls the layout of your blog’s header.\n\nWordPress will now show all the Header template parts that make up the current theme. Simply find the header you want to edit and give it a click.\n\nYou’ll now see a preview of that header template. To go ahead and edit the template, click on the small pencil icon.\n\nWith that done, click to select your site’s logo.\n\nIn the right-hand menu, select the ‘Block’ tab.\n\nThen, select the ‘Settings’ tab.\n\nYou can now make the logo bigger or smaller by dragging the ‘Image Width’ slider.\n\nWhen you are happy with how the logo looks, click on the ‘Save’ button.\n\nNow, if you visit your website, you will see the new logo in action.\n\nMethod 3: Change the WordPress Logo Size by Editing CSS (Works With Most Themes)\n\nIf your WordPress theme doesn’t have built-in support for changing the logo size, then another option is adding custom CSS. This allows you to resize your logo without using a separate image optimization plugin.\n\nTo start, you will need to know the CSS class of your website’s logo. To get this information, go to any page that has the logo, such as your site’s homepage.\n\nHere, right-click anywhere on that page and select the ‘Inspect’ option.\n\nThis will open an Inspect menu that shows all the code for the homepage.\n\nAfter that, click the ‘Select an element’ icon, which looks like a mouse pointer.\n\nNext, simply hover the mouse over your website’s logo until the CSS class pops up.\n\nIt will look similar to the image below.\n\nYou’ll use this CSS class to customize the size of your WordPress logo, so make a note of the class in a text editor like Notepad.\n\nIn the WordPress dashboard, go to Appearance » Customize. Then, click on the ‘Additional CSS’ option.\n\nYou can now add custom CSS code to the small code editor.\n\nSimply add the CSS class you found earlier, and then specify the new logo dimensions that you want to use.\n\nHere’s an example of how the code will look:\n\nimg.custom-logo { max-height: 100px !important; }\n\nMake sure you change the img.custom-logo CSS class and the max-heightvalue.\n\nAfter making your changes, simply click the ‘Publish’ button to make them live.\n\nMethod 4: Change the WordPress Logo Size Without Editing CSS (No Code)\n\nIf you aren’t comfortable editing theme files or adding custom CSS, then you can use a WordPress CSS plugin instead. These plugins allow you to make visual changes to your site, similar to using a drag-and-drop page builder.\n\nWe recommend using CSS Hero as it allows you to optimize images and customize almost every CSS style without writing a single line of CSS code.\n\nDeal: WPBeginner readers can get a 40% discount through our CSS Hero coupon code.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is install and activate the plugin. For more details, see our step-by-step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin.\n\nUpon activation, click the ‘Proceed to Product Activation’ button to activate the plugin. You will find it right above your list of installed plugins.\n\nThis will bring you to a screen where you can enter your username and password. Simply follow the onscreen instructions to verify your account, and you will be sent back to the WordPress dashboard when you’re finished.\n\nAfter that, click the ‘Customize with CSS Hero’ button in the WordPress admin toolbar.\n\nYou will now see your website with CSS Hero running on top of it.\n\nCSS Hero uses a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, so simply click any element on the page, and you will see a toolbar with all the customizations you can make.\n\nSimply click on your WordPress logo at the top of the page.\n\nAfter that, select the ‘Show Advanced Props’ link to see all the changes you can make to your WordPress logo.\n\nIn the ‘Measures’ box, you will find the ‘Max Width’ and ‘Max Height’ options.\n\nTo change the size of the logo, simply type new numbers into these fields. If you want to keep the original image dimensions, then only change the height or the width.\n\nThe live preview will show your changes automatically. This means you can try different sizes to see what looks the best.\n\nWhen you are happy with how your logo looks, click on ‘Save and Publish’ to make the resized logo live.\n\nWe hope this article helped you change your logo size.
