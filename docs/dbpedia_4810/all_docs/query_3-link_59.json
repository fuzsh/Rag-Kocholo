I occasionally make minor changes to the site. this is the site. https://targettraining.edu.au/ I have 2 issues now.\n\nThe logo is not displaying properly on site. It shows properly in the admin panel but not once I logged out. The caption \"YOUR SUCCESS, OUR TRADITION\" is not in the logo image and I searched the whole dashboard but couldn't find where the caption is entered.\n\nIf I add new content or changes to the site it's not getting updated right away but after a day. Similarly, I can see the changes in the admin portal not once I logged out.\n\nThe solutions I have tried through surfing the internet."
