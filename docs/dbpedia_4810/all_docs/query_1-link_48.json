        "text": "Are you seeing the ‘Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons’ error in WordPress?\n\nYou can upload most common file types in WordPress without any errors. However, you may see this error if the file type is not supported by WordPress.\n\nIn this article, we will show you how to easily fix the ‘Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons’ error in WordPress.\n\nWhat Causes the “Sorry, This File Type Is Not Permitted for Security Reasons” Error?\n\nThe error “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons” appears when you try to upload a file type that WordPress does not support.\n\nYou may have seen this error message appear when trying to add a new file to your Media Library.\n\nIf you use the latest WordPress version, you may see the error message saying, “Sorry, you are not allowed to upload this file type.”\n\nFor security reasons, WordPress restricts the file types you can upload through your WordPress dashboard.\n\nThe permitted file types include all common images, video, document, and audio formats.\n\nOne solution to fix this problem is to upload the files through FTP or your WordPress hosting provider’s file manager app. However, it is not as convenient as using the built-in WordPress media library.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at how to fix the “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons” error in WordPress. The methods explained in this guide are all friendly for beginners.\n\nYou can use the links below to jump to the different solutions:\n\nOption 1: Check and Fix the File Type Extension Spelling\n\nLet’s say that you might have uploaded the same types of files to WordPress previously with success. However, this time, your attempt has failed, and you are wondering why that is.\n\nIn this case, it is likely that the error occurs because you have misspelled the file extension.\n\nA file extension is the 3 or 4-letter file type suffix that appears at the end of file names on your computer.\n\nFor instance, an image file may be named holidayphoto.png, where holidayphoto is the file name and png is the extension.\n\nThese extensions are used by many programs and applications, including WordPress, to recognize file types.\n\nHere are the default WordPress file types and extensions:\n\nImages: .png, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .ico, .webp\n\nDocuments: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .psd\n\nAudio: .wav, .mp3, .m4a, .ogg\n\nVideo: .mp4, .m4v, .mpg, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2\n\nWhen you get this error, the first thing we recommend is checking the file extension to make sure it is correct. Sometimes, you may accidentally delete a file name extension or mistype it while editing or saving a file on your computer.\n\nOn Windows 10 and 11, you can easily check file extensions. Simply open the folder that contains your file and click on the ‘View’ link at the top of the window. From here, simply check the ‘File name extensions’ box.\n\nAfter checking that box, you will now see the extension after the file names.\n\nIn the example below, you can see that it is a JPG image.\n\nThis will show the extension for all files on your computer, not just the ones in this folder.\n\nMac users can view file extensions by opening the Finder app and going to Finder » Settings or Finder » Preferences in the top menu.\n\nThis will bring up the Preferences popup, where you need to click on the ‘Advanced’ tab and make sure that the box next to the ‘Show all filename extensions’ option is checked.\n\nNow that you can view the file name extensions, find the file you were trying to upload and make sure it has the correct extension.\n\nIf the extension is incorrect, then you can simply right-click and select the ‘Rename’ option to change the file name and add the correct extension.\n\nOption 2: Allow New File Types in WordPress With the File Upload Types Plugin\n\nIf you want to upload file types that are not supported by WordPress, then you can still upload them by adding them as a supported file type.\n\nThe File Upload Types plugin is the easiest way to fix the “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons” error. This plugin was co-created by WPBeginner’s founder, Syed Balkhi.\n\nFirst, you need to install and activate the File Upload Types plugin. For more details, see our step-by-step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin.\n\nUpon activation, go to the Settings » File Upload Types page in your WordPress admin area. Then, simply type your file type into the search box.\n\nNext, check the box next to the file type(s) that you want to enable. This will change the default file type upload settings.\n\nYou must then click on the ‘Save Settings’ button at the bottom of the screen to store your changes.\n\nNow, go ahead and return to the media library.\n\nYou will be able to add your file(s) without getting an error message.\n\nOption 3: Allow New SVG File Types Using WPCode\n\nYou can also manually specify which file types are allowed to be uploaded on your WordPress website. However, it can be dangerous to edit your site’s files directly because small mistakes can cause big WordPress errors.\n\nThat’s why we recommend using WPCode instead. WPCode is the best WordPress code plugin that allows you to insert code snippets into your website without directly editing your theme’s functions.php file.\n\nWPCode has a code snippet specifically for allowing SVG file uploads. You can see more in our guide on how to add SVG image files in WordPress.\n\nOption 4: Edit Your wp-config.php File (Advanced)\n\nThis method is the most advanced of all the ones we’ve listed, and we only recommend it if none of the above options have worked to upload your custom file types.\n\nWe also strongly suggest backing up your WordPress website using a plugin like Duplicator before following this tutorial to prevent further errors.\n\nThis method requires editing your wp-config.php file. For more information, you can check out our guide on how to edit your wp-config.php file in WordPress.\n\nOnce you open the file, find the line that says /* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */ or /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */ . Then, copy and paste the following code right above that line:\n\ndefine('ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true);\n\nAfter that, save the file and try uploading your media or document again. If this method is successful, then go back to the wp-config.php file and remove this line.\n\nThis code prevents users from uploading file formats that could harm your site. By disabling these filters, you’re opening your site to potential security vulnerabilities like malware uploads, so you should use this method with caution.\n\nKeeping Your WordPress Site Secure When Permitting Additional File Types\n\nThe reason WordPress blocks many file types is to help keep your WordPress website secure.\n\nWhen you enable additional file types, we strongly advise taking some security measures to protect your WordPress website.\n\nYou should:\n\nRestrict non-registered users so they can only upload the file types that they need to upload. The best way to do this is with a file upload form.\n\nUse a WordPress security plugin to monitor your site for vulnerabilities.\n\nRegularly scan your WordPress site for potentially malicious code.\n\nConsider limiting the size of uploaded files to stop users from uploading large files that may contain malware.\n\nAdd user activity logging so that you have records of which user uploaded which file.\n\nWe hope this article helped you learn how to fix the “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons” error in WordPress. You may also want to see our list of must-have WordPress plugins for your website and our ultimate guide on how to fix the most common WordPress errors."
