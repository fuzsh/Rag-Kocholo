        "text": "A site icon, also known as a favicon, is a unique icon representing your website. This guide will show you how to add a site icon to your site.\n\nThe site icon is displayed in several places including:\n\nNext to your site’s name in your WordPress.com dashboard.\n\nIn your visitors’ browser tab.\n\nAs the icon used when someone bookmarks your site in their browser.\n\nIn search results.\n\nAs a home screen app icon when saved to a browser or phone.\n\nHere are several examples:\n\nYou can upload a site icon by following these steps:\n\nStarting from your dashboard, navigate to Settings → General.\n\nClick on “View” in the upper-right corner and ensure the “Default view” is selected:\n\nIf you do not see the “View” option in the upper-right corner, you can visit the “Site Identity” section directly by clicking this link will take you directly to where you can edit your site icon.\n\nClick on the “Change” button underneath “Site Icon“:\n\nNote that you may need to click on Site Identity before being able to choose an image, depending on your theme.\n\nYour site’s Media will open where you can:\n\nChoose an existing image.\n\nUpload a new image following these guidelines.\n\nAfter selecting an image, click the “Continue” button. You may then be given an option to crop the image to ensure it’s square. You can also skip the cropping step if you wish.\n\nClick the “Done” button when you’re happy with the icon, and your changes will be saved automatically.\n\nThe image file for your site icon should meet the following criteria:\n\nAspect ratio: Upload a square image.\n\nDimensions: At least 512 x 512 pixels.\n\nFile type: PNG and SVG image file types are the most common. Any valid favicon format is supported.\n\nHere are some actionable tips you can follow:\n\nKeep it simple. Remember, you don’t have a lot of space to play around with!\n\nKeep it recognizable. Try to encapsulate your brand in the small space you have to work with. If you’re used to using a logo that isn’t a tiny square, try to create something that evokes that logo rather than unnecessarily squeezing the whole original in.\n\nUse as little text or lettering as possible. Remember that the favicon is a small image. Even if your usual logo has your company name spelled out, keep it concise in your favicon.\n\nThink about color. Different web browsers (like Google Chrome, Safari, and Edge) use different color palettes. And, with the increasing popularity of dark mode, you’ll want to ensure your favicon looks great regardless of the user’s browser. Ensure the favicon looks good and stands out on white, gray, and black background colors.\n\nYou can remove a site icon you added by following these steps:"
