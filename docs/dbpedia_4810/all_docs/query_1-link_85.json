Many users take advantage of its powerful features to power their websites, blogs, and products. But WordPress can also be used to manage, store, and sell digital files.\n\nUsing WordPress for file management lets you easily sell and share large files with customers without worrying about data storage limits or security issues. It lets you control download permissions and restrict certain files based on user roles, such as subscribers or paying customers.\n\nAnother benefit of using WordPress to manage file downloads is that it’s also a great platform for selling digital products. With a plugin like Easy Digital Downloads (EDD), you can easily turn your WordPress site into an eCommerce store and sell and manage your file downloads in WordPress with ease:\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to monetize your content and potentially create additional revenue streams for your business. You can even use WordPress + EDD to offer subscription services, where customers pay to access specific files or content over time.\n\n💡For a full guide, refer to How To Sell Files Online (Best Way + Comparisons)\n\nIf you’re selling physical goods and, therefore, use a plugin like WooCommerce, you may need a separate download manager plugin.

Learn about SiteGround + Managed EDD Hosting to get WordPress and Easy Digital Downloads set up in just a few clicks!\n\nHow to Manage File Downloads in WordPress\n\nReady to get started?

The best plugin for digital creators and sellers is Easy Digital Downloads:\n\nAs one of the best WordPress eCommerce plugins, EDD delivers an all-in-one solution for selling digital products. This includes:\n\nOpen Source Software\n\neBooks\n\nVideo & audio files\n\nWordPress themes & templates\n\nPDFs, documents, & spreadsheets\n\n& Much more\n\nYou can use the powerful tool to manage file downloads in WordPress.

To maximize your success, I suggest purchasing a paid plan. With an EDD Pass, you get access to a range of extra features and functionality, including the impressive library of premium extensions.\n\nOnce you purchase your plan, you can download and install the Easy Digital Downloads WordPress plugin. To get started, go to File Downloads from your EDD account dashboard. Click on Get Easy Digital Downloads:\n\nNext, you can upload the zip file to your WordPress website under Plugins » Add New » Upload Plugin:\n\n🔌New to WordPress? Use this guide on installing a WordPress plugin.\n\nOnce activated, EDD adds a Downloads menu item to your WordPress admin dashboard. This is basically the central hub for your online store:\n\nNext, you can begin configuring the plugin settings. Under Downloads » Settings » General » Store, you can enter your business information:\n\nUnder the Payments tab, you can select a default payment gateway:\n\n⚙️There are many other setup and configuration options to tackle. We won’t get into them here. But for help setting up your store, refer to:\n\nEDD Quickstart Guide\n\nQuickly Sell Digital Downloads With Stripe\n\nHow to Create an Online Store With WordPress\n\nChoosing a WordPress Theme\n\nStep 2: Add Your Files in WordPress\n\nAfter activating Easy Digital Downloads and configuring the payment options, you can start adding downloadable files to your site. EDDs lets you add multiple files for each product. It also supports various file types, such as PDFs, audio files, images, etc.\n\nFirst, go to Downloads » Add New from your WordPress dashboard:\n\nNext, you’ll see the download/product editor page:\n\nYou can name the downloadable file and add a description. Under the editor, go to Download Prices to enter a price. To offer it as a free download, you can leave the value at “0”:\n\nNext, in the Downloads Files section, you can enter a Filename. This text will appear as the download link to your customers. Then, under File URL, select the link icon to upload a new file:\n\nFrom the pop-up panel that opens, you can upload files from your computer or the WordPress Media Library:\n\nTo the right, you’ll find additional file download settings. For instance, you can add a download image. Under Button Options, you can select the type of button to display with the file download:\n\nFinally, click Save Draft » Preview to see the file product page from the frontend of your site. If you’re happy with how it looks, you can select Publish to make it available for customers.\n\nStep 3: Configure the File Download Settings\n\nEasy Digital Downloads comes with a handful of settings you can use to control, restrict, and manage file downloads in WordPress. This includes options for limiting downloads based on certain criteria. It also lets you customize the emails and purchase receipts that include download buttons/links.\n\nControl File Downloads in WordPress\n\nTo configure the global file download settings, go to Downloads » Settings » Misc » File Downloads:\n\nThe first setting you can enable is the Require Login checkbox. This lets you restrict file downloads to logged-in users.\n\nNext on this page, you can change the default Download Method. There are two main file download delivery methods to choose from: Forced or Redirect.\n\n🔗Learn more about Forced vs Redirect file deliver and how to Force Files to Download (Not Open In a Browser)\n\nAnother way to manage file downloads in WordPress is to set a file download limit:\n\nThe number you enter here will be the maximum number of times files can be downloaded. Note that you can overwrite this setting for individual downloads. On the download product page, you can go to Download Settings, then enter the number under File Download Limit:\n\nAnother option on the File Downloads settings screen is to enable Download Link Expiration:\n\nHere, you can specify a certain number of hours your customers have to download the file before the download link expires. After that, they’ll have to go to their account page to generate a new URL.\n\nFinally, you have the option to Disable Redownload:\n\nThis setting hides the download link from the customer’s account page.\n\nWhen you’re done, be sure to click on Save Changes at the bottom.\n\n🔐 Want to further secure WordPress files? Learn how to add password protection to PDFs!\n\nCustomize the Download Receipt/Emails\n\nAs I briefly mentioned earlier, Easy Digital Downloads lets you automate purchase receipts/emails to your customers. For instance, once they complete the checkout process from the download page, they’re brought to the confirmation/receipt page:\n\nHere, they can see that their purchase/order was successful and some key details, such as the order status and download link.\n\nA Purchase Receipt is also emailed to customers:\n\nTo customize the message, go to Downloads » Settings » Emails » Purchase Receipts:\n\nYou can enter an email heading, subject line, and body text. Additionally, you can personalize the email using the HTML and tag markers listed under the text box:\n\nFor instance, the {download_list} tag will insert a list of download links for each download purchased. You can select Preview Purchase Receipt or Send Test Email to see how it looks to customers:\n\nWhen you’re done, click on Save Changes.\n\nStep 4: Track & Monitor File Downloads in WordPress\n\nYou can view customer orders, manage customer accounts, and track downloads in real time. For instance, under Downloads » Tools » Logs, you can see key info on file downloads and filter by dates:\n\nYou can see download data and analytics under Downloads » Reports:\n\nYou can switch between tabs to view detailed reports. This includes the top file downloads, popular payment gateways, etc.\n\nIf you have a paid EDD license, you can also use the Advanced Reports extension. This is one of many add-ons you can use to extend the capabilities of your eCommerce store. For instance, Advanced Reports lets you filter by payment status and export subscription orders.\n\n📊 Learn How to Enable Enhanced eCommerce Tracking in WordPress & integrate with Google Analytics!\n\nFAQs About Managing File Downloads\n\nManage File Downloads in WordPress\n\nStart taking advantage of WordPress’s file management capabilities today and you’ll be on your way to a more successful digital business.
