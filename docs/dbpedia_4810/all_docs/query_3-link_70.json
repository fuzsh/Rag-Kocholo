When you type in the URL https://iplaysite.com/ in the browser, it gets redirected to iPLAYSITE – design • code • music and reloads constantly. Also, if you try to navigate to another page like Notebook – iPLAYSITE , it gets redirected and reloads again. Sigh.\n\nPlease see the attached video to see what I mean.\n\nLink to the Video:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1uCTzjtOmyfdaf5vLo5kWcVXokR70pU7S/view?usp=sharing\n\nThis bug started out of the blue when I updated one of the posts. Any insight on how to resolve this issue would be so grateful.\n\nI also tried deactivating all of my plugins, but the same reload problem occurs.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHi Jenn,\n\nThanks for your reply! Deleting the header and the Footer template seems to stop the looping. I will just have to rebuild them.\n\nStrangely, that logo path was located in the footer. But I did not touch the header or the footer template at all. Would you have any idea how the refresh line of code got added?\n\nThank you so much."
