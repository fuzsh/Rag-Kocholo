Read on to grasp this feature and learn its role in brand recognition.\n\nWhat is a WordPress Favicon\n\nA WordPress site’s favicon (a.k.a favorite icon) is the small icon displayed in the web browser tabs. It is also shown in bookmarks or app icons on your mobile device’s home screen. A favicon icon is an image icon that serves as a visual cue for your site’s identity.\n\nBelow is an example of a favicon on a WordPress website.\n\nHow to add Favicon in WordPress? (4 ways)\n\nIn this section, we’ll show you how to add a WordPress favicon to your site in 4 different methods.\n\nYou can use whichever suits you by clicking on it bellow.\n\n1. Add a Favicon Using the WordPress Customizer\n\n2. Change WordPress Favicon using the Site Editor\n\n3. Adding Site Icons with a WordPress Favicon Plugin\n\n4. Manually adding a favicon to your WordPress website\n\n1. Add a Favicon Using the WordPress Customizer\n\nAdding a custom favicon, or “Site Icon,” to your WordPress site is simple if your theme settings include the option.\n\nHere’s how you can do it using the WordPress Customizer:\n\nLog in to your WordPress dashboard.\n\nClick on Appearance > Customize to open the WordPress Customizer.\n\nIn the Customizer, look for the Site Identity section and click on it.\n\nHere, click on the Select Site Icon button. This is where you upload your favicon file.\n\nClick the Select File button to upload your favorite image.\n\nOr select an existing icon image from the WordPress Media Library. The recommended size for a favicon is 512×512 pixels. WordPress will allow you to crop images if necessary.\n\nOnce ready, click Publish at the top of the Customizer to save your changes.\n\nYour new favicon should now be visible in the browser tab when you visit your site. It will also show up when someone bookmarks your site or adds it to their home screen on a mobile device.\n\n2. Change WordPress Favicon using the Site Editor\n\nSince the release of WordPress version 5.8, you can change the favicon using the Site Editor, as long as your theme supports it. Keep reading to master the WordPress favicon change with the Full Site Editor.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nLog in to your WordPress dashboard.\n\nClick on Appearance > Editor.\n\nOnce in the Editor, look for the Patterns panel.\n\nScroll down to the Header tab and click on the block pattern on the left.\n\nClick on the site logo block to Add a Site Logo.\n\nThen select your unique favicon from the Media Library or upload it.\n\nHit Save, then Publish to apply the changes.\n\n3. Adding Site Icons with a WordPress Favicon Plugin\n\nAnother method of adding a WordPress favicon to your site using a plugin like RealFaviconGenerator. This free plugin provides a user-friendly interface to streamline the process of managing and updating your site icon.\n\nHere’s how you can go about it:\n\nGo to Plugins > Add new from your dashboard.\n\nInstall and Activate the plugin.\n\nNavigate to Appearance > Favicon.\n\nClick the Select From Media Library button.\n\nAdd the favicon image by clicking on it and hit Select.\n\nClick the Generate Favicon button.\n\nThat will forward you to the RealFaviconGenerator website. The tool allows you to choose WordPress icon fonts and sizes. You can also modify how it looks on Google Search Results pages, desktop web browsers, and mobile browsers like Chrome browser or Safari.\n\nScroll down to the Favicon Generator Options and specify if that’s the first favicon package for your site or the favicon version if you are changing an existing one.\n\nHit the Generate your Favicons and HTML code button.\n\nThe plugin will generate and install the Favicon files on your site, showing a “Favicon is installed!” message on your dashboard.\n\nWith Real Favicon Generator, you ensure your favicon will look sharp and professional, whether viewed on a desktop browser, a mobile device, or even as an app icon.\n\nRemember that the plugin must remain active on your site to guarantee your favicon is always active. This contributes to a cohesive brand image that users will recognize and trust.\n\n4. Manually adding a favicon to your WordPress website\n\nThis approach is suitable if your theme settings don’t include a Site Identity tab or just prefer to go the manual way.\n\nTo add a favicon manually, follow the steps below:\n\nCreate a site icon and get your zip favicon package that contains all ico files.\n\nUpload its contents to your site’s root directory. You can use an FTP client or your web hosting control panel’s File manager. The root directory is usually public_html. That’s the same folder where you can find WordPress folders like wp-content and wp-admin.\n\nNext, you must add your favicon code to your WordPress so that browsers know where to find the favicon. Edit the header.php file of your theme files via FTP or File Manager.\n\nNOTE: Be cautious when editing code and consider using a Child theme to avoid losing changes on theme updates.\n\nInsert the following line of code within the <head> section of your header.php file:\n\nlink rel=\"icon\" href=\"http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico\" type=\"image/x-icon\"\n\nImportant!: Replace http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico with the actual URL where your favicon file is hosted.\n\nSave the changes to the header.php file.\n\nNOTE: If you are not seeing your favicon after implementing it, make sure to clear your browser cache.\n\nThat’s all! Now you know 4 different ways to add a favicon in WordPress.\n\nHow to remove a Favicon in WordPress?\n\nYou haven’t created your logo or favicon icon yet, but you want to remove the default WordPress favicon? Or maybe you’re making branding changes and revamping your site? Whatever the reason, read on to learn how to delete an existing favicon image\n\nTo remove a favicon from your WordPress site, follow these steps:\n\nGo to your WordPress dashboard.\n\nClick on Appearance > Customize.\n\nFind the Site Identity tab\n\nScroll down to the Site Icon option.\n\nClick Remove or clear the existing image file set as the favicon.\n\nDon’t forget to save your changes by clicking Publish.\n\nThat’s it! Your WordPress favicon is now removed, and you can add a new one if that’s your goal.\n\nHow to create a Favicon?\n\nCreating a favicon can be quick and easy, especially with web tools like the RealFaviconGenerator.\n\nHere’s a condensed guide:\n\nDesign Your Icon. Craft a simple, clear design. Start with a square image (512×512 pixels is ideal) representing your brand, like a simplified logo. You can use various tools like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Canva.\n\nGo to the realfavicongenerator web tool and upload your image.\n\nGet your Favicon package and HTML code and proceed with the Manual upload method\n\nAlternatively, install the RealFaviconGenerator plugin on your WordPress site. It will help you convert your image into .ico format. Also, it will assist in implementing your design across all platforms and devices without manually creating different sizes.\n\nUpload and Generate. Through the plugin’s interface, upload your design. The RealFaviconGenerator will automatically create the necessary favicon files and HTML code.\n\nPublish. Save your changes within the plugin and add the HTML code to your header.php. Then, your new favicon will be live, providing a consistent brand experience for all your visitors.\n\nFavicon image Size & Guidelines\n\nWhen creating a favicon, make sure your image is a square with dimensions of at least 512×512 pixels. Opt for saving it in PNG or SVG formats for their broad browser support and scalability.\n\nHere’s how to craft an effective favicon:\n\nSimplicity is Key: A clean and straightforward design will be most effective with limited space.\n\nBrand Representation: Your favicon should clearly reflect your brand. If your logo isn’t square, adapt it to fit the favicon format without losing its essence.\n\nMinimal or No Text: Avoid using text unless it’s part of your brand’s identity. If it’s necessary, use as few characters as possible.\n\nColor Considerations: Choose colors that pop against different browser backgrounds, including white, gray, and black, to ensure visibility in light and dark modes.\n\nYour favicon should be easily recognizable to maintain brand continuity across various platforms and browsing environments.\n\nThe Role of a WordPress Site Icon in Brand Recognition\n\nA site icon in WordPress plays a crucial role in brand recognition by visualizing your website across modern browsers and devices. This small yet significant graphic appears in the browser tab, bookmarks, history listings, and even when saved to a smartphone’s home screen. It offers a consistent and immediate identifier for your site amidst the many tabs and bookmarks a user may have open.\n\nAdopting a unique and memorable favicon that aligns with your brand’s logo, colors, and identity establishes a more professional online presence. It enhances user experience and fosters brand familiarity. Each time a user encounters your WordPress favicon, it reinforces your brand’s image, making it essential to building trust and recognition in the digital space."
