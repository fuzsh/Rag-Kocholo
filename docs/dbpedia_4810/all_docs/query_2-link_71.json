        "text": "Hi,\n\nthe desktop header keeps showing up on mobile, i.e. it does not switch to the mobile header on certain pages.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/jz6j0RP\n\nI could find out that the problem is definitely connected to page caching. I am not asking you to solve a problem that it is not caused by the theme, but it would be great if you could look into it. Just in case something with the theme causes it, since it affects only the header.\n\nI use W3 total cache. With page cache disk mode enabled, the wrong header (i.e. the desktop header) is displayed on all pages instead of the mobile header.\n\nHowever, with page cache in opcache mode enabled, the wrong header is displayed only on the homepage. All other pages show the correct mobile header.\n\nI have ruled out all other caching methods, asset minification, other plugins, etc… It is independent of the phone, or the browser. I also went through xstore’s speed optimization options one after the other.\n\nThe problem consistently goes away only with page caching disabled. Interestingly, with page cache ON it works correctly for a few minutes right after emptying the cache, but then again switches to desktop header on page reload.\n\nI would very much appreciate you help!\n\nBest regards\n\nMartin\n\nPlease, contact administrator\n\nfor this information.\n\nHello, @Martin,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the detail explanation of the issue.\n\nNow, the thing is on your site there multiple cache plugins installed and activated also, you are using the theme cache options on your site as well. While using third-party plugins for the cache/optimizing do not use the theme settings for the cache both will conflict and cause unexpected issues on the site like now.\n\nTo solve your issue I just disable these options from the theme settings >> speed optimization >> see the images: https://postimg.cc/V5c1qCjm and https://postimg.cc/LYp71jGW by doing this your issue is resolved. Here is the resulting video from my personal mobile: https://streamable.com/rabdnr as you can see I navigate to multiple pages and the header is working fine now.\n\nFurther if the issue came back again then try to flush ther server cache and use only 1 cache plugin at a time for now, there are multiple plugins installed and activated for the cache and optimizing on your site.\n\nRegards 8Themes Team.\n\nHi Tony,\n\nthank you for your help. But the issue comes back, flushing caches does not help.\n\nI know, sometimes it goes away for a few minutes. Usually after changes in the xstore configuration.\n\nSee screenshot https://postimg.cc/jCGTmdfd\n\nthere are multiple plugins installed and activated for the cache and optimizing on your site\n\nNo, there really aren’t. I only use W3 total cache for page, object and browser cache. CSS and JS are managed exclusively in “Asset Cleanup” which does not affect the problem at all. Neither does Perfmatters do any caching at all.\n\nI had already tried deactivating those settings in xstore speed optimization before, one by one AND in combination. No results.\n\nFor good measure, just before writing this, I also deactivated Menu Dropdown Ajax Loading and Menu Cache. And again, for 2 minutes it worked fine, then the problem came back upon page reload!\n\nAlso, once again, I deactivated ALL plugins except W3 total cache, waited, flushed, waited… the problem persisted.\n\nOnly when I deactivate page cache in W3 total and the issue is reliably gone.\n\nBest regards\n\nMartin\n\nHello, @Martin,\n\nOf course, As I said about the cache. Once you flush the cache from the plugin settings it starts to appear fine and then after just a few minutes the issue will start appearing. If there is something wrong with the theme or its settings the issue does not have to solve for a couple of minutes only, no matter how many times you flush the cache.\n\nI suggest you contact your service provider and let them know about your cache issue.\n\nThey will flush the server cache and disable the cache system from your site. I hope by doing this your issue will be resolved.\n\nRegards 8Themes Team.\n\nHello Tony,\n\nI do not see what it has to do with the provider. I can disable/flush the opcache myself in the panel, but it does not help.\n\nI can also change the cache method to “disk”, which I have done. Problem still there.\n\nCss/js management is OFF. Opcache is OFF on the server. Problem still there.\n\nOnly when I disable page cache in w3 completely, it is gone.\n\nSo either it is an issue with w3 or with xstore. I cannot tell but I need to start somewhere. All I am asking for is to have a look into it, please.\n\nBeste regards\n\nMartin"
