In the folder tree on the left, navigate to the folder in which you want to create the new file/folder. Click the New File or the New Folder icon in the upper toolbar.\n\nHow to upload files/folders to my website?\n\nNavigate to the folder in which you want to upload from the folder/file tree on the left. Click the File Upload or the Folder Upload icon in the upper toolbar and choose the upload item from your computer.\n\nThere is no file size limit for uploads in the File Manager.\n\nHow to edit website files?\n\nWhen inside the File Manager, navigate to the location of the file you want to edit. Select the file and click Edit (pencil icon) in the upper toolbar. Alternatively, right-click on the file and choose Edit from the menu.\n\nApply the necessary changes and click Save (save icon) in the upper toolbar.\n\nHow to edit hidden/system files?\n\nIn the Linux operating system, a hidden file is any file that begins with a “.” (dot). An example of such a file is .htaccess.\n\nSuch hidden files can be edited in two ways:\n\nUsing File Manager in Site Tools. By default, all hidden files are displayed there.\n\nThe alternative method for editing your hidden files is by using the edit functionality included in your FTP client. For example, if you wish to see a hidden file in your FileZilla select Force Showing Hidden Files which is located in the Server menu.\n\nHow to find .htaccess file in File Manager?\n\nClick on “public_html” from the left sidebar in the File Manager and locate the .htaccess file.\n\nHow to see your file/folder size and inodes in File Manager?\n\nTo see your file/folder size and inodes, click on the Show folder size & inodes icon in the top navigation bar.\n\nHow to manage file permissions\n\nTo manage your File/Folders permissions, select the file/folder, and click Change Permissions (the key icon).\n\nA pop-up window will appear where you can customize the permissions for your website, file, or folder. If you are changing the permissions of a folder and you want to apply them to the subfolders and files, select Recursive. Once ready, click Confirm.\n\nThe following permissions need to be set in order for your website to function properly.\n\nAll HTML files and images need to be readable by others. The permission for this is 644 (readable by User, Group, and World, and writable by User). It is set automatically when you upload files.\n\nAll folders need to be executable by others. The permission for this is 755 (readable by User, Group, and World, writable by User, executable by User, Group, and World). It is set automatically when you create a folder.\n\nAll CGI files (all files in the CGI-bin folder) need to be executable by others. The value for this is 755 (readable by User, Group, and World, writable by User, executable by User, Group, and World). It is not set automatically when you upload files. You need to change the file permissions manually.\n\nHow to remove website files/folders?\n\nIf you want to remove files/folders, navigate to the location of the file you want to delete. Select the file and click Delete (trash can icon) in the upper toolbar. Alternatively, right-click on the file and choose Delete from the menu.\n\nConfirm the deletion in the popup that appears to permanently remove the item from your website. After that, the file will not be present in the File Manager."
