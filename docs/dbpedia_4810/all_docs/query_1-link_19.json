        "text": "Hi everyone. My name is Anna and I’m writing from Italy. I have no computer skills and, for this reason, I use RW. In 15 years I have created various sites related to my hobbies and my work. This time I’m having trouble publishing it on SiteGround. It gives me a 404 error: it means there is a problem with the .hatcess files. My new site has a home page called “VETRINA” plus 12 other pages. When I start publishing it connects correctly to SiteGround but the .hatchess files window is empty and I don’t know what code to edit. Can someone help me?\n\nHi @emmeci47,\n\nNot sure I understand, are you trying to visit the .htaccess file in your web browser? That wouldn’t work, you can’t access it like .html or .php pages.\n\nCan you clarify what you are trying to do with the .htaccess file? Did SiteGround tell you that you should enter some code there? Did you read online about some code you should enter there?\n\nWe would need more information in order to help.\n\nHi Dan.\n\nWhen I try to publish my website https://leoccasionidianna.it/ I’ve verified that there is no code in the window of the .hatcess file.\n\nThis is the reason why SiteGround says that without a correct .hatcess file it is impossible to publish my website and Google writes “Error 505 page not found\".\n\nI’ve controlled the .hatcess file in the managing files page of SiteGround: the icon is present but it is empty, without any code.\n\nSo SiteGroun wrote to me to enter this generic code, with no results:\n\nRewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]\n\nI think they work well with WordPress but they are absolutely not familiar with RW.\n\nMind that on November 2023 I’ve published a previous version without this kind of problem and it is almost ten year I use RW to make five websites (having no programming skills: this is why RW is fantastic).\n\nUnfortunately nothing from the previous site was saved, because it was outdated and needed to be completely redone, which is why I am unable to verify old .hatcess file and I’m asking for your help.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnna.\n\nPS. My website is .an e-commerce business without a cart. My customers can choose and purchase from a vast gallery of wool and cotton yarns, since I live in Biella, the city that is the Italian capital of wool.\n\nHi @emmeci47,\n\nThat bit of code tells the server to point any request for a page or file that does not exist back to the index.php file to handle the redirect.\n\nThis won’t work on your website, as there is no index.php file to point to. So, in short, the advice that SiteGround is giving you, makes no sense.\n\nIt looks to me that your website is stored in the wrong folder on your server. If you go to the publishing settings in RapidWeaver, you should see the folder it stores your site in here:\n\n(the folder (or path) on this image is of course an example)\n\nCheck with SiteGround if you have the correct path in this setting field. They should be able to tell you if it do, or what it should be if it don’t.\n\nCheers,\n\nErwin"
