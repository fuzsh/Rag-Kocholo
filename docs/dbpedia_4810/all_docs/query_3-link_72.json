        "text": "Are you looking for an alternative for SiteGround’s managed WordPress hosting services? Then you’ve hit the jackpot because we have the perfect one for you. This SiteGround alternative not only offers a similar level of quality but even outperforms SiteGround when it comes to certain qualities.\n\nAnd as if this weren’t enough, our SiteGround alternative also comes at a much cheaper price.\n\nAs a WordPress hosting provider, SiteGround offers amazing services, there’s absolutely no arguing about that. But when it comes to SiteGround’s hosting infrastructure, website performance, elasticity, website design options and pricing, you’ll find that there’s definitely some room for improvement.\n\nThat’s where 10Web comes into play.\n\n10Web, as a Google technology partner, provides a magnificent range of state-of-the-art features. Starting from our high-class security to our website speed optimization services, we’ve got all your needs covered, even when you yourself are not aware of them.\n\nSo without further ado, this is what’s coming at you.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n+95 PageSpeed Score\n\nOne-Click Automated Migration\n\nElastic Scaling\n\nReal-time Differential Backup\n\nPricing\n\nSecurity Services\n\nAll-in-One Website Builder\n\nImage Optimizer\n\nSEO Services\n\nLet’s get right to it!\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right hosting provider, it all starts with the infrastructure.\n\nIn this department, 10Web shines as the better SiteGround alternative with its automated WordPress hosting that’s powered by Google cloud.\n\nCloud computing has been such a game changer for the website hosting world, based on the countless advantages it offers. Here are a few examples:\n\nHigher speed performance and scalability through load balancing,\n\nSecurity and administrative flexibility and independence thanks to containerization,\n\nBetter connectivity thanks to the distribution of several data centers around the globe, taking the world wide web onto a whole different level.\n\nThe list goes on and on. Not to put this rave to an end, but rather to paint a clearer picture, let’s take a look at how being powered by Google cloud hosting has benefited 10Web:\n\nTo ensure a state-of-the-art infrastructure, we’re using the latest generation of Google Cloud’s servers. So, with us, you never have to worry about lagging behind.\n\nAdditionally, using Google Cloud’s SSD storage allows us to keep latency down to a minimum, while keeping the performance level high at all times.\n\nBy providing our users with an LXD container, we basically offer operating system-level virtualization. Translation: You’ll be isolated from other users that share the same servers, i.e. resources with you. This way we ensure higher security levels, more flexibility and independence when it comes to managing your resources, protect you from bad neighborhood effects, and consequently enhance your performance.\n\nWith Nginx and FastCGI caching we ensure low memory usage and a high concurrency level. We’re perfectly equipped to ensure a high performance under high traffic!\n\nWe’re further pushing the performance of our users by using the latest version of PHP (currently, it’s 7.4).\n\nAs for SiteGround, while the hosting provider has announced that they’re planning a move towards Google Cloud as well, the fact they’ve waited so long to make this move speaks for itself.\n\nThis being said, we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and carefully watch when and how this plan is put into motion.\n\nTo end this section on a positive note: SiteGround offers data centers on 4 continents and provides 100% renewable energy match. So does 10Web, by the way, but as avid advocates for environmental protection, we’re always happy to observe and support environmentally friendly approaches within our industry.\n\n90+ PageSpeed Score\n\nAnother thing to look for in a SiteGround alternative is website speed optimization.\n\nDon’t worry, though, we’ll spare you a lecture about how crucial website speed is for your website, especially in terms of enhancing your SERP ranking, which in turn will impact your conversion rates.\n\nMostly because we feel that, by now, most website owners have understood the message. And partially, because I, the refreshingly humble writer of this article, have far more important information to share with you.\n\nFor example, did you know that every user that migrates his or her website to 10Web automatically receives a 90+ PageSpeed score? It’s not just an empty promise, we, at 10Web, are men and women of our words.\n\nBut just in case there are some skeptics reading this and questioning the integrity of our services, we’d like to warmly welcome you to check our platform yourself. That’s what our free trial without any credit card requirement is for. Use it and if you’re not convinced, you’re free to leave it.\n\nFor those who already have a website, here’s what to do:\n\nGo to our WordPress Speed Optimization page and enter your website’s URL. That way you can see how your website is doing. A PageSpeed score of 90-100 means that you’re doing great and don’t need our help. But to those who score beneath 90: you can do better! Here’s how:\n\nSign up for 10Web and install our 10Web Manager plugin. We’ll create a copy of your website, optimize the copy, and send it back to you. As you see, the original version of your website will stay in its original form. The changes we’ll make is on the website copy we’ve created. So don’t hesitate making use of this opportunity.\n\nIn a nutshell, it’s the combination of this website speed optimization service and our top-notch infrastructure that make it possible for us to not only guarantee a 90+ PageSpeed score but to also uphold this promise.\n\nIn comparison, SiteGround has a software stack optimized for speed, but lacks the website optimization service that to this day remains a feature that’s unique to 10Web and 10Web only. This, inevitably, makes us the best SiteGround alternative.\n\nOne-Click Automated Migration\n\nIn order to be able to explore the option of a SiteGround alternative, an easy and affordable migration service is of great value.\n\nWe, at 10Web, can fully understand that the decision to change hosts isn’t always easy. There’s really no need for the added burden of a complex and pricey migration process. It would definitely make you think twice about changing hosts and exploring your options.\n\nThat’s why 10Web offers their customers two things:\n\nFree migration\n\nAutomated 1-click migration\n\nThis way you won’t have to put any kind of effort into taking care of the technical aspects of this process. The only thing you have to do is copy and paste your current website’s URL and select a data center location. In a matter of minutes your site will be connected to 10Web. An added bonus is that you won’t have to worry about increased expenditure.\n\nElastic Scaling\n\nScaling, scalability, elasticity or whatever people see fit to call it, refers to a hosting provider’s ability to scale the resources available to you according to your current demand.\n\nThe purpose of scaling is to ensure that a website isn’t negatively affected when it experiences an unexpected surge in traffic.\n\nWhen it comes to scalability, SiteGround could do better. Currently, they have a so-called “CPU seconds per account”, alias a monthly allowance. What it does is it puts a limit on the resources your website is allowed per month.\n\nAs if this wasn’t bad enough, should you happen to exceed this limit regularly, you run the risk of getting your site put on hold until you reach the next month and your monthly allowance resets.\n\n10Web, on the other hand, has great scalability, which makes it a great alternative to SiteGround. With 10Web, there’s no need to worry about potential spikes in traffic, because we will always meet your current demand for resources.\n\nShould your site experience a traffic increase within the range of 2K to 200K visitors, we’ve got you covered. Not only do we ensure that your site doesn’t go down, we also guarantee that it will not lose performance.\n\nAnd don’t worry, just because we’ll meet your demand doesn’t mean that we’ll automatically upgrade your plan without your permission. Those are two different things.\n\nIncreasing the amount of resources available to you means that for extra 10K visitors and for extra 5GB SSD storage use, you’ll be charged an extra $2 at the end of the billing month.\n\nShould you, however, come to the conclusion that you’re having traffic spikes because your business is growing, then feel free to contact us and ask for an upgrade. We’ll automatically adjust your tariff for you.\n\nReal-time Differential Backup\n\nIf there’s one thing we’ve learned in the digital age it’s the importance of a good backup system. Whether it’s seminar papers for your studies, vacation pictures, home videos, work-related documents or website content, you always have to make sure to backup. Otherwise you risk losing valuable data. There’s no way around that!\n\nPeople tend to underestimate this aspect because they overestimate the control they have over technical processes that can lead to system failure, whether because of simple human error or a hacker or third-party code.\n\nOf course, you can always roughly estimate the likelihood of certain incidents occurring.\n\nBut:\n\nLikelihood isn’t a known fact. For that reason you shouldn’t leave the state of your valuable data to chance.\n\nWhen it comes to backups, SiteGround allows its users to keep their data stored for up to 30 days. You have the option of storing your whole website or just certain parts of it, like files, databases or emails.\n\nYou will also have this option with our designated SiteGround alternative, 10Web. But what 10Web offers and SiteGround doesn’t is a real-time differential backup service. By real-time we mean that you have the option of scheduling your backups on an hourly basis.\n\nAnd by differential we mean that only the recent changes made after that last full backup will be saved. Plus, you can always restore data from the last 1000 backup points.\n\nThe offer that our customers can schedule automatic backups goes for all our plans. Your data will be stored safely in AWS S3.\n\nPricing\n\nFor some, choosing the best SiteGround alternative is closely linked to finding a hosting provider that offers a better price-performance ratio. Especially in the hosting industry, this can be a tricky thing.\n\nFrom one side you’ll hear that shared hosting is the best hosting option because it’s the cheapest option there is. From another you’ll hear that dedicated hosting is better because it allows for more liberties, albeit at a much higher cost.\n\nWhile we find that low prices shouldn’t be the only advantage a hosting provider has to offer, we do understand the importance of affordability. That’s why we included it in our list of elements to look for in a hosting provider.\n\nWhen it comes to the pricing structures of the two hosting providers, you’ll find that higher prices don’t necessarily mean higher quality. Let’s have a look.\n\nThe StartUp plan starts at $11.95 per month and includes the following: 1 website, 10GB cloud storage, 10K monthly visits, free WP migrator, free SSL, free CDN, 100% renewable energy match.\n\nNot let’s contrast this with the SiteGround alternative of our choice: 10Web’s Personal plan targets small businesses or blogs and costs $10 a month. This price can go as low as $6, depending on how many websites you manage on 10Web. This is what this plan includes:\n\n1 hosted website, 10GB SSD and 20GB cloud storage, 25K monthly visitors, free automatic migration, free SSL, website builder based on Elementor, 30+ premium widgets, 50+ premium plugins as well as 100% renewable energy match.\n\nSo, as you see, with 10Web, you’ll pay less for more. And this is only a small fraction of what we offer. Again we highly encourage you to take a look and see for yourself if 10Web is truly the most suitable SiteGround alternative for you. That’s what the non-binding free trial, with no credit card requirement is for!\n\nSecurity Services\n\nOf course, you don’t need us to tell you how important security is for running a successful and profitable website. A lack of proper website protection is hands down the easiest and fastest way to lose your good reputation. So let us tell you what the two hosting providers offer.\n\nSiteGround’s security efforts are based on the 4 following elements:\n\nReal-time server health checks,\n\nSmart WAF to protect your website from exploits,\n\nAI anti-bot against malicious traffic,\n\nA 24/7 system administration team.\n\nHere’s what 10Web’s security service has to offer:\n\nBuilt-in login number limitation,\n\nDDoS protection,\n\nVulnerabilities and file change scans,\n\nConstant installation of the newest patches and updates,\n\nFast and full restoration of hacked websites,\n\n24/7 customer support.\n\nAs you can see, your website’s security is a priority for us, which not only makes us a great alternative to SiteGround but also a safe one. We are always thinking about new ways to minimize and hopefully eliminate the risk of a security threat.\n\nAll-in-One Website Builder\n\nNow here’s something that you most probably won’t find elsewhere that coincidentally makes us the ultimate SiteGround alternative: our website builder based on Elementor.\n\nNewcomers to the tech world, listen up, because this one’s for you:\n\nYou can create, customize and change your website via drag-and-drop, with just a few clicks. This way we spare you the excruciating and time-consuming task of writing code.\n\nOn top of this, our 40+ designer-made and mobile-friendly templates will provide you a variety of design options for your site. You don’t have to be a tech expert to have your site look professional.\n\nAnd the cherry on top of this is that we also provide you with 50+ premium plugins, most of which are free. Those plugins will come in handy if you decide that you\n\nneed to take additional security measures,\n\nwant to increase your SEO ranking,\n\nwant to add features such as a comment section, social media signals, email subscription, etc.\n\nUltimately, this will allow you to run your website professionally and at the same time save unnecessary expenditure. By having these high-quality items at your disposal you\n\nwon’t need to hire IT experts to run your site for you, and\n\nwon’t have any additional or hidden costs that you’ll be facing whenever you decide to make use of extension features.\n\nHaving these gems included in our hosting packages especially comes in handy for agencies and freelancers who are making use of our white labeling option. Meaning, they offer 10Web’s services to their clients under their own brand. That way they can offer a wide variety of features that their customers most probably won’t be able to find anywhere else.\n\nStill not sure if we’re the best SiteGround alternative for you? No problem, now let’s see what you think about this:\n\nImage Optimizer\n\nLet’s start this section off by stating the following: in order to professionalize you first need to optimize. Doesn’t make sense to you, does it? Yeah, okay, busted – we were just trying to go for a rhyme.\n\nMoving on from this tragic attempt at comedy, the actual message is that image optimization is a crucial part of ensuring high website performance.\n\nI’m sure most of you can understand how frustrating it can be to visit a website only to wait for a long time for the images to load. This was maybe acceptable in the 90s or early 2000s.\n\nIn the day and age of smartphones and Generation Z, we guarantee you that people are merciless when they’re faced with high latency. And not to state the obvious, but losing visitors can have serious consequences for your business.\n\nThat’s why 10Web as a worthy SiteGround alternative offers an image optimizer that will automatically enhance the images uploaded to your WordPress through up to 90% image compression without quality loss.\n\nWhat does that get you? Easy, 10 times lighter images, resulting in a 3 times faster website.\n\nFor those of you wondering why this section, like the previous one, lacks a comparison with SiteGroud: we hate to break this to you, but SiteGround doesn’t offer this type of service.\n\nSEO Services\n\nAnother feature that SiteGround doesn’t offer is our search engine optimization (SEO) service.\n\nSEO is an important part of running a website for every type of website owner. Whatever website content you’re creating you’ll probably want to share it with a specific group of audience (except for the highly individualistic people out there, who are creating things for the sake of creation or for themselves – but that’s a whole different story).\n\nAs a way of reaching your audience, you can rely on some SEO rules to ensure that your website ranks high on the search engine results page.\n\nThere are a lot of elements that go into building a solid and efficient SEO strategy. Some companies even hire SEO specialists to take care of this task, which should tell you how important it is.\n\nIf you’re not acquainted with the SEO principles, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Check out this article. It will help you create a good SEO strategy.\n\nWe, as a viable SiteGround alternative, offer our customers an SEO service that includes custom metadata, XML Sitemap, canonical URLs, search analytics, Redirects, and so on. In addition to that, we offer URL optimization, which will make sure that your URL has the perfect length.\n\nAll of this will significantly increase your visibility on search engines and subsequently your conversion rate.\n\nNow that we’ve done our part, we can sit back, relax and kindly throw the ball back into your court. Would you consider 10Web the ideal SiteGround alternative or do you have other recommendations? And if you’ve used or are currently using SiteGround’s hosting services, care to share with us your experiences – the good and the bad? Make yourself heard, share your thoughts, and leave a comment!"
