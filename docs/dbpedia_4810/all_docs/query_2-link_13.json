        "text": "Not only is it hard to reach SiteGround by phone, but thereâs also a long list of what they wonât help you with.\n\nHelp with malicious code, databases, and plugin conflicts arenât covered. Theyâll tell you to hire a developer or pay them a fee to fix it.\n\nNexcess surpasses SiteGround's support limitations. Our WordPress experts are available 24/7/365 to help with a wide range of issues.\n\nCPUs power your website, handling everything from file requests to Google crawls to traffic spikes. SiteGround restricts them.\n\nIf your site exceeds its CPU limit, SiteGround may take it down. Unless, of course, you upgrade your plan â¦ immediately.\n\nNexcess doesnât set hard resource limits or hold your site hostage. Your hosting auto-scales to keep costs low as you grow.\n\nSiteGround's discounts come at a high price: up to 600% more than your monthly fee. And a year-long commitment.\n\nIf you renew, full payment is due 15 days before your \"one year\" ends. Upgrading your plan cancels your discount altogether.\n\nAt Nexcess, we value your loyalty. With competitive pricing and flexible contracts, you can expect stable billing for years to come.\n\nItâs hard to turn a profit at SiteGround. Instead of including what WooCommerce needs to thrive, they upsell you â¦ over and over.\n\nThere are no tailored resources, optimizations, or tools. Constant upsells on top of your plugin fees? Not ideal for a growing business.\n\nNexcess can lower your WooCommerce costs by over $155/mo with premium plugins, monitoring tools, and optimized resources out of the box.\n\nAt SiteGround, thereâs no way to know how a plugin update will impact your WordPress site. If something goes wrong, youâre on your own.\n\nYou canât preview visual changes or troubleshoot performance after an update. You canât even stage your site for less than $24.99/mo.\n\nAt Nexcess, every plan includes free staging, visual regression testing, and plugin monitoring to diagnose and solve problems fast.\n\nSiteGround is a secure hosting company. SiteGround infrastructure is supplied by Google Cloud servers, which adhere to industry-standard requirements. They also include a free security plugin for WordPress, but it is not a top-rated solution. Nexcess owns and operates independent infrastructure for enhanced security, and we include the best-rated security plugin on every WordPress plan for free: Solid Security.\n\nSiteGround limits CPU requests to handle server traffic efficiently on their servers, but restricting those requests can cause more problems than you think. Imagine it this way â¦ CPUs are like gasoline for cars â your siteâs engine canât move forward without them. When you try to fill the tank at SiteGround, they only give you a couple of gallons at a time. If you run out of gas, your engine shuts off until you pay them more. You end up spending more time and money getting to your destination, when you could have a web host that gives you a full tank of gas every time you get in the car."
