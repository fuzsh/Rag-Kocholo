Active Agenda is designed to support operational risk management (ORM) in organizations and is optimized for high reliability organizations. It is a browser-based multi-user enabled software. Active Agenda includes approximately one hundred modules covering areas of the operational risk management process. Active Agenda utilizes a custom code generator called \"spec2app\". The \"spec2app\" processor converts specifications written in XML into integrated Active Agenda modules utilizing PHP and MySQL. The code generator enables rapid development of extensions to the core application and simplifies customization, support, and maintenance. Active Agenda was released on Sourceforge in October 2006. The source code release coincided with Penton F31 Media's publication of the project launch article titled \"A Solution (R)evolution. In 2007, Active Agenda was 141 named a \"FAST 50\" by the readers of Fast Company magazine.

It can produce static calendars without any links or calendars with navigation controls, a date picker control, event days and content with event URLs, and linkable days (optionally URL or JavaScript). The layout can be configured using CSS, and JavaScript is not required. The supported dates (on systems using a 32-bit signed integer Unix time_t) are: 1902-2037 (Unix) and 1971-2037 (Windows), when using the default PHP native date functions, and 100-3000 and later, when using the ADOdb Date Library. Active Calendar is an open source project, licensed under the LGPL. jim.'c—a.w i □ •-_X_\" ...

' screenshot2 640x480 Features The calendars created by this class: can be static (without any links) can optionally have navigation controls can optionally have a date picker control can optionally have linkable days (URL or javascript) can optionally have 'event days' with 'event links' and own layout can optionally have 'event content' with 'links' and own layout support different GMT zones for the current date calculation support month and day names, depending on your language can be configured using CSS do not require Javascript to be displayed or navigated (server side generation) can be generated with just 2-3 lines of code Active Calendar is based on the PHP native date functions (default) and supports optionally the ADOdb Date Library [l] Supported dates (on systems using a 32-bit signed integer Unix time_t): Active Calendar • Using PHP native date functions: 1902 - 2037 (UNIX) and 1971 - 2037 (Windows) • Using ADOdb Date Library: 100 - 3000 and later [limited by the computation time of adodb_mktime()] on both UNIX and Windows. To use the ADOdb Date Library just include it in your scripts. The Active Calendar class will use the library functions automatically. Usage Basic methods overview $cal = new activeCalendar ( [ $year, $month, $day, $gmt_zone] ) ; Create first a new object of the class. The parameters $year, $month and $day are optional. If these parameters are not set, the current year, month and day will be passed to the program. The parameter $year should have the form \"yyyy\" e -g- \"2005\" or \"1996\", the parameter $month should have the form \"m\" e.g. \"1\" for January or \"10\" for October and the parameter $day should have the form \"d\" e.g. \"4\" for the 4th month day or \"24\" for the 24th month day. So for the date e.g. 7 January 2005 please set $cal = new activeCalendar(\"2005\",\"l\",\"7\"). The parameter $gmt_zone is optional as well. Use this parameter to set the GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) zone for the current date calculation (e.g. 9 for Osaka Japan, 2 for Athens Greece, - 5 for New York USA). If $gmt_zone is not set, the server local time will be used. $cal->enableMonthNav ( [ $link, $arrowBack, $arrowForw] ) ; Call this method, if you want the generated calendar to have month navigation controls (e.g. \"previous month\" and \"next month\"). The parameter $link is optional. You can use this parameter to set the URL for the calendar links (e.g. \"mycalendar.php\" or \"mycalendar.php?mode=4&item=test\", if you need more complex urls). You should modify the private method mkUrl(), if you want to change the general structure of the generated links. The parameters $arrowBack and $arrowForw are optional as well: they set other month navigation controls, than the ones set in the configuration (an image link can be set too). $cal->enableYearNav ( [ $link, $arrowBack, $arrowForw] ) ; Call this method, if you want the generated calendar to have year navigation controls (e.g. \"previous year\" and \"next year\"). The parameter $link is optional. You can use this parameter to set the URL for the calendar links (e.g. \"mycalendar.php\" or \"mycalendar.php?mode=4&item=test\", if you need more complex urls). You should modify the private method mkUrl(), if you want to change the general structure of the generated links. The parameters $arrowBack and $arrowForw are optional as well: they set other year navigation controls, than the ones set in the configuration (an image link can be set too). $cal->enableDatePicker ( [$startYear, $endYear, $link, $button] ) ; Call this method, if you want the generated month calendar to have a date picker control. The parameters SstartYear and SendYear define the range of the years, that can be selected (e.g. $startYear=2000, $endYear=2010). This range is limited by the private class variables $startYear and $endYear. Please modify them according to your configuration. The parameter $link is optional. You can use this parameter to set the URL for the calendar links (e.g. \"mycalendar.php\" or \"mycalendar.php ?mode=4&item=test\", if you need more complex urls). You should modify the private method mkUrl(), if you want to change the general structure of the generated links. The parameter $button is optional as well: it sets some other value for the date picker submit button, than the one set in the configuration. $cal->enableDayLinks ( [$link, $ JavaScript] ) ; Active Calendar Call this method, if you want the generated calendar to have linkable dates. The parameter $link is optional. You can use this parameter to set the URL for the calendar links (e.g. \"mycalendar.php\" or \"mycalendar.php?mode=4&item=test\", if you need more complex urls). You should modify the private method mkUrl(), if you want to change the general structure of the generated links. The parameter $javaScript is optional as well. You can use this parameter to set a JavaScript function instead of a URL for the calendar links. So if you set $cal->enableDayLinks(false,\"selectDate\"), this link will be created on e.g. 27 May 2007: ..href=\"javascript:selectDate(2007,5,27)\".. The content of the Javascript function 'selectDate' will not be created by the class. You should develop it according to your needs. $cal->setMonthNames ($monthNamesArray) ; Call this method, if you want the class generate different names for the calendar months, than the ones set in the configuration. The parameter $monthNames Array must be an array of 12 month names starting with January. $cal->setDayNames ($dayNamesArray) ; Call this method, if you want the class generate different names for the calendar weekdays, than the ones set in the configuration. The parameter $dayNamesArray must be an array of 7 day names starting with Sunday. $cal->setEvent ($year, $month, $day, [$id, $eventUrl] ) ; Call this method, if you want the class to create an HTML td class=$id on the date specified by the parameters $year, $month, $day. You can configure every 'event date' in your CSS, so that it would have e.g. a different background color. The parameter $id is optional. If you do not set an $id, a default HTML class='event' will be generated. The parameter $eventUrl is optional as well: If you set an $eventUrl, an event specific link (..href='$eventUrl'..) will be generated on the 'event date', even if the method $cal->enableDayLinks($link) was not called. $cal->setEventContent ($year, $month, $day, $content, [ $contentUrl, $id] ) ; Call this method, if you want the class to create a new HTML table within the date specified by the parameters $year, $month, $day. The parameter $content can be a string or an array. If $content is a string, then the new generated table will contain one row with the value of $content. If it is an array, the generated table will contain as many rows as the array length and each row will contain the value of each array item. The parameter $contentUrl is optional: If you set a $contentUrl, an event content specific link (..href='$contentUrl'..) will be generated in the 'event content' table row(s), even if the method $cal->enableDayLinks($link) was not called. The parameter $id is optional as well: if you set an $id, an HTML class='$id' will be generated for each event content (default: 'eventcontent'). $cal->showMonth ( [ $showNoMonthDays ] ) ; This method will generate the HTML string of the month calendar. You can display the calendar by \"print $cal->showMonth()\". This method calls several private class functions, that create each tr tag of the generated table. So if you would like to change the table structure, you could simply modifiy the order, that these private functions are called (mkMonthHead() must remain first and mkMonthFoot() must remain last though). The parameter $showNoMonthDays is optional: if it is set true, days that do not belong to the current month will be displayed in the calendar (default: false). Please note that these days will not contain any events or event contents!. $cal->showYear ( [ $ columns] ) ; This method will generate the HTML string of the year calendar. You can display the calendar by \"print $cal->showYear()\". This method calls several private class functions, that create each tr tag of the generated table. Active Calendar So if you would like to change the table structure, you could simply modify the order, that these private functions are called (mkYearHead() must remain first and mkYearFoot() must remain last though). The parameter $columns is optional: it sets the number of the generated months in each row of the year calendar (default: 4).

Adminer is distributed under Apache license in a form of a single PHP file (currently approx. 160 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub Vrana who (during 2007) decided to develop such tool as an \"light-weight\" alternative to phpMy Admin. Currently (August 2009), the tool is in version 2.0 and so far it exceeded phpMy Admin in some of the features it offers. Also, first webhosting providers started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services. Features • users log in specifying the destination server and providing the user name and password (which is stored during whole session) basic functions (select database, select/edit tables, browse/insert/edit table rows) searching or sorting via multiple columns editing of other database objects: views, triggers, events, stored procedures, processes, mysql variables, user permissions text area for arbitrary SQL commands and storing these commands in command history export of databases and tables (its structures and/or data) as a dump to output or a downloadable attachment user-friendly interface (extensive employment of JavaScript) multiple language support (English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Estonian, Chinese, Czech, Slovak, Russian) SQL syntax highlighting visual database/E-R schema editing XHTML 1.1 validity in UTF-8 provisions against XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, session stealing, ... \"light-weight\" - released in a form of a single file, approx. 160 KiB in size, with support of CSS skins Adminer The small single file is a result of compilation and minification of source codes.

It structures a bibliography using topic tree oriented publication management. Publications may be annotated to briefly outline the publication's relevance. Aigaion is built on the BibTeX format. Main features Aigaion aims at making bibliographic information easily accessible. The following features help the user in accomplishing this. Categorization of publications Aigaion offers different methods for categorizing publications. The main feature that distinguishes Aigaion from most other reference management software is categorization of publications in a (user-created) topic tree. Each publication can be assigned to one or more (sub-)topics. All publications that are assigned to a (sub-)topic can be presented in publication lists. Each user can subscribe to topics in the topic tree and unsubscribe from topics that are irrelevant for the user. The second method for categorizing publications in Aigaion is using one or more keywords to describe a publication. Aigaion offers context sensitive information that helps the user in using consistent keywords. All publications that are assigned to a keyword can be presented in publication lists. Each author and topic display offers a keyword cloud showing the keywords that are assigned to publications of the author or topic. Publication lists can be viewed with different sortings (e.g. sorted on Author, Year, Journal). Aigaion 1 1 Annotation of publications Another feature that distinguishes Aigaion from other reference management software is that one or more annotations can be added to each publication. These annotations can either be privately used by each single user, or can be shared between all users. References to other publications are automatically recognized and replaced by hyperlinks to the respective publication. One or multiple internal or external attachments can be added to each publication. Import and export of publications Aigaion offers the following import and export features: • Import and export of BibTeX and RIS data. • Formatted export to TXT, HTML or RTF in common citation styles (such as APA, Chicago, Harvard, and IEEE). • Export per email. Other features Aigaion is suitable both for individual users and for users groups. It offers the following user management features: • Set individual user rights, from read-only access to administrator access. • Manage user groups. • Easy integration in other websites using single-sign-on mechanisms. Aigaion is platform independent, written in PHP/MySQL. It offers multi-language support and an active group of users contributing to the different supported languages. History Aigaion is mainly written by PhD students who could not find a reference management software that suited their needs. The main features that have been available since the first release in 2005 are the topic tree and the possibilities for annotations. As of the 2.0 release, Aigaion is based on a MVC architecture using the codelgniter PHP framework. Aigaion is widely used at universities and scientific projects.

T21 As Joe Brockmeier wrote : What does a 2.0 release mean, in the context of a clip art library? In this case, it's a couple of things. First it's a recognition of the library's improvements to its hosting framework. The site uses the Aiki Framework, and now sports a new theme and the ability to browse through PNG thumbnail previews. Need to work with the graphics from the site and make changes? Grab the SVG. Need to slap in a bitmap image? Grab the PNG. The goal of Aiki Framework is to make a fast system for developing heavily trafficked communities where developers are used to editing source code, but can not directly because of necessary security precautions in running a web server.

Tsvetkov Stable release 0.0.0.1a /10th Apr 2007 Type Image Manupulation License LGPL Website Asido. info Asido is an open-source PHP (PHP4/PHP5) image processing solution, with \"pluggable\" drivers(adapters) for virtually any environment (either GD2 (php_gd2), ImageMagick via shell, ImageMagick via extension (php_imagick), MagickWand (php_magickwand), etc). Features Asido supports the following features: • pluggable drivers for GD2 (php_gd2), MagickWand (php_magickwand), ImageMagick extension (php_imagick) as well as ImageMagick shell commands • \"hack\" drivers: workarrounds for certain disablities of a particular driver by using some of the other functionality provided by the environment • various resize functionality: proportional resize, resize only by width or height, stretch resize, fit resize, frame resize • watermark images, including tiling watermark and automatic scaling of large watermarks • rotate images • copy images onto one another • crop images • grayscale images • convert images between different filetypes Here are some of the features covered. Fit Resize This type of resize is a proportional resize, but its behaviour is affected by the size (dimensions) of the image. If the image is smaller than the \"resize frame\" (provided by the $width and $height arguments), it will NOT be resized: it will resize only if any of its dimensions are bigger than those of the \"resize frame\". This feature is very handy; it will save you the pixelation effect if you are trying to resize smaller images to fit into larger \"frames\". Frame Resize This is another handy resize feature. It is a kind of compromise between the stretch resize and the proportional resize. This feature will resize the image proportionally using the Fit feature (not the regular proportional resize) and will place it in the center of a canvas, which has $width and $height as its dimensions, and $color as its background. This is very useful, because it offers the ability to fit virtually any image inside any resize frame - and the Asido 14 proportions will not matter: you can fit a landscape inside a square, or a square inside a portrait, etc. The $color argument is used in the same manner as it is used when rotating by custsom angles - to fill the left blank areas. Drivers Currently Asido supports the drivers for the following environments: * GD2 (php_gd2) extension * ImageMagick php_imagick extension * MagickWand php_magickwand extension * ImageMagick shell commands Example Code This example shows how to watermark and resize an image. <?php /** * Set the path to the Asido library */ include (' ./. ./. . / as ido/dev/ class .asido .php ' ) ; /** * Use the GD driver */ asido : : driver ( ' gd ' ) ; /** * Create an Asido_Image object */ $il = asido :: image ( ' the -source -image . jpg ' , ' filename-with-which-you-want-to-save-t he-re suit . png ' ); * Watermark it */ asido : : watermark ( $il , ' put -the -watermark- image -he re . png ' ) ; /** * Resize it proportionally to make it fit inside a 400x400 frame */ asido: : resize ($il, 400, 400, ASIDO_RESIZE_PROPORTIONAL) ; / * * * Save it and overwrite the file if it exists */ $il->save (ASIDO_OVERWRITE_ENABLED) ; Asido 15 ?> External links • Asido project at SourceForge.net • GD(GD2) Image Functions (PHP) [5] , support in PHP • MagickWand for PHP [6] MagickWand For PHP manual • ImageMagick official ImageMagick project homepage References [1] http: [2] http: [3] http [4] http: [5] http: [6] http [7] http //sourceforge.net/users/mrasnika/ //asido. info/ //sourceforge.net/projects/asido/ //www. sourceforge. net //www.php.net/gd // w w w . magick wand, org // w w w . imagemagick. org Associate-O-Matic 16 Associate-O-Matic I • ■ ■ * J ^l ^& ^^^^ associate-o-matk Developer(s) Gyrofly, Inc.

The source of these useful yet distinct features is not just from the minds of developers, but also from the people who use the software . With its mix of technical features and user friendly interface, Beehive is used by a range of audiences, from Linux users to senior citizens and more. Beehive is used by the popular UK technology website The Inquirer.

Since 2000, Claroline development teams have been focusing on the code stability and the development of features in line with the user's needs. The main concern of the developers is not to build up a large number of new features, but to concentrate upon a few elaborated tools concerning the pedagogical approach and the interface offered to the users. Besides, a large worldwide community of users and developers contributes to Claroline's development and diffusion extensively [3] Claroline 35 Partners Initially started in 2000 by the UCL (Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium), Claroline has been developed following teacher's pedagogical experience and needs. Claroline is now financially supported by the Region wallonne for its development through the WIST programme . Within this programme, Claroline associates three Belgian partners : • The CERDECAM, Research and development centre of the ECAM, Brussels • The LENTIC, Research centre on new technologies, innovation and change of the ULg, Liege • The IPM, University pedagogy and multimedia institute from the UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve The Claroline Consortium was born on May 23, 2007 during the second annual conference of Claroline users that was held at the Vigo University, Spain. This international non-profit association mainly aims at federating the Claroline community, coordinating the platform developments and promoting its use . The 5 founder members of the Consortium are : • Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium • Haute Ecole Leonard de Vinci, Belgium • Universidade de Vigo, Spain • Universite du Quebec a Rimouski, Canada • Universidad Catolica del Norte, Chile See also • Learning management system Links • Official website • Claroline Demo and comparison @ Demolabo.com References [1] http://www.claroline.net/ [2] Claroline Wiki (http://www.claroline.net/doc/en/index.php/Main_Page) [3] Claroline Worldwide page (http://www.claroline.net/worldwide.htm) [4] Credits page on Claroline.net (http://www.claroline.net/partnership/credits.html) [5] Consortium page on Claroline.net (http://www.claroline.net/consortium/consortium.html) [6] http://www.claroline.net [7] http://demolabo.com/claroline Comparison of knowledge base management software 36 Comparison of knowledge base management software The following tables compare general and technical information for a number of knowledge management software packages.

It allows easy access to all types of databases, such as MySQL, through the use of PHP objects. Usage demonstration Doctrine follows the active record pattern for working with data, where a class corresponds with a database table. For instance, if a programmer wanted to create a new \"User\" object in a database, he/she would no longer need to write SQL queries, but instead could use the following PHP code: Object-related functionality can be added to the objects themselves, instead of being spread around the application. This can improve the ease of maintenance of the software project. Features One feature of Doctrine is the low level of configuration that is needed to start a project. Doctrine can generate object classes from an existing database, and the programmer can then specify relations and add custom functionality to the generated classes. There is no need to generate or maintain complex XML database schemas, as seen in many other frameworks. Another key feature of Doctrine is the ability to optionally write database queries in an OO (object oriented) SQL dialect called DQL (Doctrine Query Language) inspired by Hibernate's HQL. Alternately, OfrjeivPslationBl Mapping API. The bridge between Bhe relational model and the object model / domain model Doctrine ORM Doctrine DBAL Overview of Doctrine the Doctrine_Query class allows one to construct queries through a fluent interface. These interfaces provide developers with powerful alternatives to SQL which maintain flexibility and still allow for switching of database Doctrine (PHP) 50 back-ends, without requiring any code duplication. Writing queries explicitly however is not always necessary, as Doctrine performs joins and fetches related objects automatically. Small projects can be easily constructed without writing queries. Other notable features of Doctrine are: • support for hierarchical (tree-structured) data; • support for hooks (methods which can validate or modify database input and output) and event listeners to structure business-related logic; • column aggregation inheritance (similar objects can be stored in one database table, with one type-column specifying the subtype of the particular object - the correct subclass is always returned when a query is done); • a caching framework, making use of several backends such as memcached, SQLite or APC; • ACID transactions; • model behaviors (sluggable, timestampable, nested set, internationalization, audit log, search index); • database migrations; • a \"compile\" function to combine many PHP files of the framework into one, to avoid the performance hit usually incurred by including the many PHP files of a framework. History Doctrine was started by Konsta Vesterinen, also known as zYne-. The project's initial commit was made on April 13, 2006 to the svn repository . As the project became more mature, the adoption began to pick up. Before long, the community was active and development was receiving regular contributions, among others from the Google Summer of Code project. m Doctrine 1.0.0 was released on September 1, 2008. Influences Doctrine has been influenced by dozens of projects and many different people. The largest influences have been the Java ORM Hibernate and ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails. Both of these ORM solutions have implemented a fully featured solution in the Java and Ruby languages. The purpose of the Doctrine project is to build an equally powerful solution for the PHP language. Community • There is an active IRC channel where users and developers of Doctrine hang out.

Its main product is a SCORM-compliant open source learning suite used by multinational companies, federal administrations and universities. Dokeos operates on a professional open-source business model based on open code, community development, professional consulting, quality-assurance services, and subscription-based customer support. History Development J 2 ! Dokeos started as a company and a learning management system in early 2004 under the impulse of Thomas De Praetere. The product was build from various existing open source modules including Nuke, PhpBB and Openoffice. In 2004, Dokeos focused on versions of the 1 .5 series, a learning platform with tools to track learners progress and share content between learners. In 2005, 2006 and early 2007, the Dokeos team strengthened with the combined efforts of a strong Belgium-based universitarian community and a team of six developers in the company, and they developed the 1.6.x series. This collaboration was progressively replaced by more client-oriented developments, leading to a professional software. From late 2007 to date (2009), the Dokeos company (with occasional community contribution) developed the 1.8.x series which clearly improved the corporate usefulness of the system, with a layer of web services to connect to external HR, CRM and ERP systems, several modules to connect to open-source CMS (Drupal and Joomla) and an improved reporting system, as well as efficiency-focused features. From 2007 on, the Belgian community, together with a few other development groups from Europe, started work on 131 Dokeos 2.0, or Dokeos LCMS. In late 2007, Dokeos extended with a Latino-American company , which added a considerable coding contribution to the development of versions 1.8.5 and 1.8.6. As of 2009, the Dokeos company is working on the 1.8.x series (with an 1.8.6 released June 2009). Dokeos 53 Statistics and market share From 2006 to 2009, the Dokeos company reached a market of rapidly increasing size from small companies to large international (mostly medical-related) companies , and extended its partners network considerably first in Europe and then worldwide. By May 2010, some 2.300.000 people were registered as Dokeos users in 30 countries and 20 languages Standards The Dokeos code is written in PHP, using MySQL as database backend. It supports SCORM 1.2 import and export. User data can be imported into the system using CSV or XML files. Dokeos can add user info and authenticate through LDAP. For the 1 .6 release, the Dokeos developer team has put efforts into complying with W3C xhtml and CSS standards. In 1.8.x, JavaScript is required (light integration into the visual layer), and using SCORM requires the use of frames in the learning path module. Development The development of Dokeos is an international project to which several universities, schools, and other organisations and individuals contribute. The Dokeos development methodology takes elements from extreme programming, usability theory, and collaborative open source development methodology, like the ideas in the Cathedral and the Bazaar. Specifically, Dokeos is very open. There is a forum, used by Dokeos users for discussion and feedback. The agenda and minutes of all developer meetings are published, and a 'roadmap' is also public. All designs and developer documentation are publicly available on the Dokeos wiki. Everyone who registers can contribute. There are currently 21 developers with CVS write access, other people contribute by sending code through email, forum or wiki. Pedagogical approach and perspective Dokeos implements a mix of instructional design and social/constructivist approaches. It was built corresponding to the traditional instructional design, and its structure is very close to traditional teaching (set of tools clearly marked as content creation tools), but extends this base by providing tools that encourage constructivism (forums, blogs, wikis, chat, file exchange, personal messaging, etc). The instructional design generally improves the simplicity of use by using known teaching strategies and allowing teachers to extend on this known base by adding social tools step by step. Tools SCORM Courses authoring Rapid learning Templates-based document production Tests : multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, matching, open questions, hotspots Interaction : forums, chats, groups Web conferencing (available on Pro and Medical editions) Conversion of PowerPoint and Impress presentations to SCORM courses (available on Pro and Medical editions) Surveys LDAP and OpenID authentication Gradebook Reservations Users sessions Dokeos 54 Adoption of Dokeos • Companies like Alcon Labs, Medtronic or Securitas run Dokeos on a wide scale and the company has some 200 corporate clients • More than 30 languages are supported (with varying quality levels) • The largest known Dokeos installation (Ghent University) currently has 28,696 active users and 3,604 active courses (the courses are not created in batch but the teachers decide when and if they create their course).

Begun in 2000 the project was moved from dotmarketing.org to Sourceforge in October 2001. The project stalled in late 2002 with the administrator not being contactable. Two of the more active developers, Andrew Eddie and Adam Donnison applied for, and were subsequently granted, administration rights to the project. Andrew continued to work on the project until he moved on to Mambo and subsequently Joomla. Adam remains an administrator. dotProject is currently undergoing a major redevelopment using the Zend Framework, with version 3 of dotProject (dP3) the expected target release to be utilising the Zend Framework [5].

It is written in PHP and uses MySQL as database management system. DynPG including all basic modules is free software and is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Features DynPG is used to upload and manage dynamic web content similar to other content management systems. DynPG however differs from other CMS, because it is embedded directly into websites. The software was originally developed to realize designs that are created with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Illustrator or any other graphics software. The layout is created with an editor like Adobe Dreamweaver or Adobe GoLive or even as simple code. After that, code snippets are placed at those points, where dynamically generated content (like articles, galleries, blogs or other dynamic content) shall be generated. It provides a convenient way to extend existing websites with dynamic content. DynPG provides a template engine, but also supports existing CSS layouts. DynPG is open source since 2005. Meanwhile, it is being used in several bigger platforms, like the swiss journal Publisher.ch. Next to other well-known CMS like Mambo, Joomla!, Drupal and TYP03, DynPG finds its place as a straightforward PHP-based open source CMS. Support is provided by a forum and documentation wikis. DynPG is multilingual, supporting German, English and Spanish. The English and Spanish documentation and support are under construction. Also, there are companies, that provide commercial support and professionally continue the development of DynPG. DynPG 59 Video tutorials There are several free (German) video tutorials available on the DynPG homepage.

Old and unmaintained versions also provided an encoder. Every time a PHP script is accessed, PHP usually parses and compiles scripts to bytecode. Once installed, eAccelerator optimizes the compiled bytecode and caches this to shared memory or disk. Upon subsequent accesses to a script, eAccelerator will access cached bytecode if it is available instead of the script being compiled. This avoids the performance overhead of repeated parsing and compilation. eAccelerator also provides functions for use in PHP scripts that allow access to shared memory, automatic web (content) caching, and other related tasks.
