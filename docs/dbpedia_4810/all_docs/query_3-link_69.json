        "text": "WordPress enables users to upload quite a few different kinds of image files. You’ll likely recognize the usual suspects, such as PNG and JPG. Displaying other file types, such as vector graphics, can be more problematic.\n\nFortunately, there are a few ways to incorporate vector files into your website. While not a native feature, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files can be used to display two-dimensional images on WordPress sites. With a little reconfiguring, you’ll be able to optimize some of your logos and other graphics using this file type.\n\nNote: If your site is hosted with WP Engine, our platform natively supports GZIP compression on SVG files. If you’re interested in trying out our fully managed hosting platform, we also offer four months of free WordPress hosting with new annual plans.\n\nIn this article, we’ll learn more about SVG files and why you might want to use them. Then we’ll walk through two ways to enable their use on your website. We’ll also cover some important security precautions you may want to take. Let’s get started!\n\nWhat is an SVG?\n\nAn SVG file is a type of vector image. Vector files are composed differently than more common image file types. For example, a JPG is made up of thousands of pixels. but that is not the case with an SVG file.\n\nVector images are more like a set of written instructions. They don’t contain pixels that form a larger image. Instead, they include a schema-like set of data that creates a two-dimensional image. This means there are some unique benefits to using SVG files.\n\nWhy allow SVG in WordPress?\n\nSVGs have a number of perks. Since they are highly scalable, you can manipulate the size as needed without impacting the quality of the image. As you might know all too well, if you try to scale up a JPG to increase its size, the quality degrades to an unusable level very quickly.\n\nThat’s where SVGs can come in handy. While they aren’t meant for displaying traditional photographs, they are a great choice for business logos, icons, and other simple graphics on your website.\n\nAdditionally, SVG files tend to be significantly smaller than other image types. This means your site won’t get bogged down by graphics. What’s more, SVG files are indexed by Google, and have been for quite some time, so they can be a real boon for your site’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO).\n\nHow to upload an SVG to WordPress\n\nSince WordPress doesn’t include support for SVGs out of the box, you’ll have to work a little harder to include them on your website. In the next few sections, we’ll go over how to add SVG files to your website with a plugin and via a manual process.\n\nMethod 1: Use a plugin\n\nAs with many WordPress tasks, plugins can make enabling SVG support simple. All you have to do is pick the right solution for your needs and configure a few settings.\n\nStep 1: Download the plugin\n\nFirst, you’ll need to download and install an SVG plugin. Some highly reviewed SVG file plugins include Safe SVG, WP SVG, Easy SVG, and Enable SVG, WebP, & ICO.\n\nOnce you’ve installed and activated the plugin of your choice, you’ll have a new menu option in your WordPress dashboard under Settings > [Plugin Name]. There, you will receive instructions on how to style SVG files for your website.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll be able to configure a few important administrative settings. If possible, we recommend restricting SVG uploading privileges to administrators only.\n\nAfter your chosen plugin is configured, you’ll be able to upload SVG files directly to your Media Library. However, there are a few other important items to take care of.\n\nStep 2: Enable GZip support of SVG files on your server\n\nHow you approach this step will depend on your web host and server setup. For example, at WP Engine, GZip is already enabled for a specific list of file types. With that being said, “image/svg+xml” is not one of them.\n\nAdding this type to the list for your website will ensure your SVG files are optimized appropriately and quickly. For everything to run smoothly, you’ll need to include this file type in your .htaccess file.\n\nNote: To increase website performance and match industry trends, WP Engine has deprecated the .htaccess file. If your site is hosted on our platform and you need to use custom .htaccess directives outside of the default WordPress rules (such as redirects, headers, or access rules), you can convert them using the guidance provided in this article.\n\nStep 3: Ensure the plugin is correctly securing files\n\nOne of the downsides to using SVG files, and the primary reason this file type has not yet been incorporated into WordPress core, is that they are prone to security issues. Since SVG files are XML-based, they are vulnerable to External Entity attacks, among other risks.\n\nWhen you configure your SVG plugin, it’s recommended that you limit SVG upload access to administrators only. However, an even more secure approach is to “sanitize” your SVG files before you upload them. This eliminates any of the unnecessary XML code that might leave your site open to attacks.\n\nMany plugins, likeSafe SVG, will sanitize your SVG files for you, but if you prefer to sanitize them manually, you can use a tool like this SVG Sanitizer Test.\n\nHaving your own sanitizer in place is also a good option if you plan to use the next method to manually enable SVGs on your WordPress website.\n\nMethod 2: Manually enable SVG file uploads\n\nIf you prefer getting your hands dirty and doing some coding yourself, you can manually enable your WordPress site to accept SVG files. The following steps outline how that process works.\n\nStep 1: Edit your site’s functions.php file\n\nTo get started, you’ll need to edit your website’s functions.php file. To do this, you can go to Appearance > Edit Themes in your dashboard, and select the functions.php file.\n\nAlternatively, you can access your site’s files using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application such as FileZilla.\n\nEither way, it’s best to create a child theme or switch to a local development environment before doing any major work on your website. This will keep your live site safe from harm while you’re making changes.\n\nStep 2: Add a code snippet\n\nNext, you’ll need to add the following snippet of code to your functions.php file:\n\n// Allow SVG\n\nadd_filter( 'wp_check_filetype_and_ext', function($data, $file, $filename, $mimes) {\n\nglobal $wp_version;\n\nif ( $wp_version !== '4.7.1' ) {\n\nreturn $data;\n\n}\n\n$filetype = wp_check_filetype( $filename, $mimes );\n\nreturn [\n\n'ext' => $filetype['ext'],\n\n'type' => $filetype['type'],\n\n'proper_filename' => $data['proper_filename']\n\n];\n\n}, 10, 4 );\n\nfunction cc_mime_types( $mimes ){\n\n$mimes['svg'] = 'image/svg+xml';\n\nreturn $mimes;\n\n}\n\nadd_filter( 'upload_mimes', 'cc_mime_types' );\n\nfunction fix_svg() {\n\necho '<style type=\"text/css\">\n\n.attachment-266x266, .thumbnail img {\n\nwidth: 100% !important;\n\nheight: auto !important;\n\n}\n\n</style>';\n\n}\n\nadd_action( 'admin_head', 'fix_svg' );\n\nAfter that, you’ll be able to upload SVG images to your Media Library. There, you can view and interact with them just like with other image file types.\n\nStep 3: Secure access and limit SVG upload permissions\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, enabling SVG files does involve certain risks. To keep your site safe, you can set upload permissions for SVGs by creating custom user roles. You can use a plugin such as User Role Editor or WPFront User Role Editor to accomplish this.\n\nThese plugins enable you to customize the access and permission levels for your existing user roles. For example, you can designate which users have permission to upload SVGs, which will help you monitor the security of those files.\n\nStay secure with WP Engine\n\nWordPress does not natively enable the use of SVG files. However, with a little extra site configuration work, you’ll be able to enable and secure the use of SVG files on your site."
