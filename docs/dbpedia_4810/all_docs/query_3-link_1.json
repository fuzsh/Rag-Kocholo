By consistently leveraging branding elements, you create a lasting impression on your audience and establish a strong connection between your brand and email subscribers.\n\nHow to add your custom logo and brand name to use as a header in your campaigns\n\nTo add your brand name & logo to your email marketing campaigns with the SiteGround Email Marketing service, navigate to your Client area > Services > Email Marketing.\n\nOnce you are in the Email Marketing application, head to the Sender Details section from the left sidebar. Select Brand Identity and use the “+ Add Logo” button to browse through your local files and add your logo image.\n\nTo get the best results, make sure your logo image is at least 512 pixels wide and has high resolution. The file should be up to 10 MB in size.\n\nFill in your Brand name and add a Default link to be displayed in your email marketing campaigns.\n\nWhen all is set, remember to hit the Save button to have your custom details saved and added to your email campaigns.\n\nYour custom logo and brand name will be displayed in the header of your email marketing campaigns.\n\nHow to delete or replace the logo image?\n\nIn case you want to Replace the logo with another image file or Remove the current one – click on the three dots menu.\n\nIf you Replace or Remove a logo from your Sender Details section, it will be automatically updated in all draft campaigns and new campaigns you create. However, please note that the logo will not be replaced in campaigns that have already been sent out.\n\nIf you need to use the updated logo in an old campaign, simply Duplicate the old campaign, and the new logo will be added to the duplicated version.\n\nWhy is including a brand name and logo in my email campaigns important?\n\nPlacing your brand name & logo in an email marketing campaign is important for several reasons. Here are the main reasons why it is crucial to incorporate branding elements into your email marketing strategy:\n\nIncrease Brand Awareness: Email branding helps raise brand awareness among your target audience. By consistently including your brand name and logo in your email campaigns, you reinforce brand recognition and make your brand memorable.\n\nBuild Credibility and Trust: Including your brand name and logo in your emails adds a level of professionalism and credibility. A branded email appears more trustworthy to recipients compared to anonymous emails without a recognizable sender or logo.\n\nEnhance Brand Perception: Email branding contributes to shaping a desirable image of your brand in the minds of recipients. A strong brand identity can differentiate your business from competitors and positively influence customer perceptions.\n\nImprove Open Rates and Engagement: A powerful brand presence in your emails can lead to higher open rates and engagement. Well-known brands have an advantage when it comes to grabbing the recipient’s attention. People are more likely to open emails from brands they recognize and trust.\n\nBoost Return on Investment (ROI): A robust brand can significantly improve the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns, leading to a higher ROI. When recipients have a strong affinity for your brand, they are more likely to engage with your emails, consider your offerings, and make purchases.\n\nIn conclusion, including your brand name & logo in your email marketing strategy is vital for increasing brand awareness, building credibility, enhancing brand perception, improving engagement rates, and boosting ROI."
