        "text": "I have two logo related questions:\n\nQuestion One\n\nJust looking for some clarification on Logo set up as I need to update the logo for my site. It appears there are multiple ways of doing it. This is the site logo on left of title and description: https://www.ringwood-dogs.com/\n\nThe logo uses this image on the left of the Site Name and Title. The logo image is: https://www.ringwood-dogs dot com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ringwood_Header_Lab-Logo-325×200.png\n\nI’m about to add an updated logo to the site so wanted to confirm what the best way of doing it / the recommended way.\n\nIt took me a bit of time to refesh how the logo was orignally set up.\n\nI can see in Apearance | Weaver Xtreme | Main Options | Header | Header Image -> that the image height is set to 200px\n\nI can see in Apearance | Weaver Xtreme | Main Options | Header | Site Title/Tagline -> that I’ve adjusted the position to x:35.5% and y:1%\n\nI thought the link to the header image would also be set within the Apearance | Weaver Xtreme | Main Options |….\n\nAfter a bit of head scratching, searching and Googling I eventually found that my exisitng logo was set in: Apearance | Customise | Images | Header Media | Header Image and appears to be linked to this https://www.ringwood-dogs dot com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ringwood_Header_Lab-Logo-325×200.png\n\nOnce I’ve confirmed the best way to update the site logo – I have a follow on question.\n\nQuestion Two\n\nGoing forward we are looking at having slightly differnt logos for the training part of the site, the dog accessies and treats sales part of the site and the home dog boarding part of the site – so lets say 3 diffent versions of the logo.\n\nHow would be the best way for different sections of the website to have slightly differnt logos?\n\nmany thanks\n\nPeter\n\nThe site custom logo image and the header image are two completely different things and they go in different places.\n\nThe header image takes a side wide position at the top of the site with various position options if you have plus.\n\nThe custom site logo image goes with the site title and tagline, it can replace the site title, and it can be added to the Menu bar\n\nRegarding your second question, and assuming we are now speaking of the header image, each page can have a different header image. The way to do that is to select a featured image for the page in question, then use the Featured image option found in the page editing page, to replace the header image with the featured image.\n\n@Weaver thanks for the note – I was sure when I put the logo in first time that it was via the Weaver setup which is why I spent so much time looking for it there – to eventually find that it was located in: Apearance | Customise | Images | Header Media | Header Image\n\n@scrambler I’m going to try your suggestion – regarding my second question, and assuming we are now speaking of the header image,\n\nI’ve set have a test page: https://www.ringwood-dogs.com/testing/\n\nI’ve set a featue image – I cannot see where you now change the options of the feaure image to “replace the header image with the featured image.” Could you please expand for me.\n\nmany thanks\n\nPeter\n\n@scrambler thanks for the detailed instruction which I have followed.\n\nThe existing header image is a 325×200 transparent logo:\n\nhttps://www.ringwood-dogs dot com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ringwood_Header_Lab-Logo-325×200.png\n\nI just made up a dummy logo and made it the same size:\n\nhttps://www.ringwood-dogs dot com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UKDogCharter_325x200.png\n\nI followed you instructons it does set it as a header image but it does not follow the existing logo even though its the same size. it centres it and streches it\n\nThis would have been so cool if it worked.\n\nLooks like I am going to have to revert to a plugin like WPDisplay or similar\n\nHere is my test page: https://www.ringwood-dogs dot com/testing/\n\nMany thansk\n\nI’ve just cleared the cache on SiteGround and my local browser cache and it works on a laptop…. BUT not on a phone (where page gets resized to a phone screen.\n\nI played with removing the “Use actual Image width” but that stretches it to full size. For the test I made my testing (blurry) logo the same size as the actual logo used as a header image: 325×200 in size\n\nWith the main logo which is a header image, the logo resizes when the screen resizes. If I have full screen on a laptop with “Use actual Image width” it looks great. If I resize the browser window as I make it smaller the logo remains the same size and does not scale like the manin logo as we are Keeping the feature image Header image the actual size. Is ther a way around this? If not looks as If I’ll need to look at the plugion options\n\nMany thanks.\n\nPeter"
