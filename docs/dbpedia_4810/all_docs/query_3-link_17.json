I can’t find a place that will let me replace it — there is the option for the large picture on the center of the page. I am trying to return the logo to upper left corner, above the navigation menu.\n\nUsing the Organization theme.\n\nThe blog I need help with is: (visible only to logged in users)\n\nHi Susan,\n\nAfter looking into your account, I found that you deleted the logo image from your Media > Library page two months ago. Make sure to keep images on your blog in your Media > Library. You can re-add this image by going to Appearance > Customize > Theme in your Dashboard. At the top you can re-upload the logo image.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!\n\nThank you so much for your assistance. Unfortunately, I am still stuck!\n\nThe instruction you offered was to “re-add this image by going to Customize > Appearance > Theme in your Dashboard. At the top you can re-upload the logo image.” There is no Customize link on the Dashboard but I did find a Customize link under Appearance > Themes and also under Appearance > Customize. They both lead to the “Customize Your Blog” page. From there, there is a Header link but it only edits the photo gallery on the Home page. I can’t find the option to change the logo in site header. Any suggestions?\n\nI thought it might help to have screenshots: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EJdI6t8r4_Fb4s1D2XemVF3CC56ihTPp3yZPgiv1XQQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nHi Susan,\n\nYes, sorry for the confusion. It was Appearance > Customize > Theme. Click on the empty image at the top and you will be able to upload your logo.\n\nHere is what it should look like:\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!"
