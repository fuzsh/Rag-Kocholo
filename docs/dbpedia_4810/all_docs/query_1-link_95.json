        "text": "Did you encounter the dreaded “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.” error on your WordPress website? 🤔\n\nDon’t worry, it’s a common error that occurs when you are uploading a file type that WordPress does not support. Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this restriction.\n\n👨‍🎓 In this article, we will show you how to upload restricted file types by installing a plugin or making manual modifications on your site.\n\nWe’ll also share a fix specifically for WordPress multisite networks, though most of our fixes are focused on regular WordPress installs.\n\nNo matter which method you choose, it will only take a couple of minutes to set up, and you’ll be able to fix the “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons” error for good.\n\nWhat causes the “Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.” error?\n\nBy default, WordPress only lets you upload a limited selection of file types:\n\nDocument: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .psd\n\nImages: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .ico\n\nVideo: .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2\n\nAudio: .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav\n\nThe restriction exists to prevent hackers from exploiting files on your website. 🔒️\n\nCertain file types like SVG are vulnerable and can be corrupted easily because these file formats were not created with security in mind. So if you upload them to your website, hackers will exploit the files to gain access to your site. That’s why WordPress allows only a handful of file types to be uploaded to a website.\n\nIf you try to upload a restricted file type, it shows you the “sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.” error.\n\nThat said, occasionally, you may have to upload restricted file types despite the risks involved.\n\nIn the next section, we are going to show you how to bypass restrictions and upload any file type you want on your WordPress website. And be sure to check out the final section, where you’ll learn how to keep your WordPress site secure from hackers after enabling the upload of restricted file types. 😎\n\nHow to upload restricted file types on your WordPress website?\n\nYou can upload restricted file types on your WordPress website by adding a code snippet to your core WordPress files or by installing a plugin. If you are running a multisite, then WordPress also gives an option to remove restrictions on file types.\n\nBut before we get down to fixing the problem, take a backup of your entire site. With a backup in place, you can carry out modifications on your website without worry. If anything goes wrong, you can quickly restore your site back to normal.\n\nUse a plugin to change WordPress file upload types\n\nEdit wp-config.php file (Allow all file types)\n\nEdit theme’s functions.php file (Allow specific file types)\n\nChange network settings (Multisite only)\n\nConvert restricted files\n\nUse a plugin to change WordPress file upload types\n\nUsing a plugin is the easiest way to enable the upload of restricted file types.\n\nInstall and activate the free File Upload Types plugin on your WordPress website.\n\nNext, go to Settings → File Upload Types. A list of file types will appear on the screen. Select the ones you want to enable.\n\nThen, hit the Save Settings button and try uploading your file on your site.\n\nIf you don’t see the file type that you need in the list, the plugin also lets you add your own custom file types.\n\nIf you don’t want to install another plugin on your WordPress website then go for the manual methods.\n\nEdit wp-config.php file (Allow all file types)\n\nAnother way to enable restricted file types on WordPress is to edit your site’s wp-config.php file.\n\nHowever, there’s an important caveat for this method:\n\nIf you use it, you will be enabling all file types at once, which might not be a good thing for your situation. If you only need to enable a single file type, we recommend the manual method in the next section, which allows for a more targeted approach.\n\nThe wp-config file is located in your website’s root folder, i.e., the public_html folder. You can access the file by connecting to your server via FTP or via cPanel File Manager if your host offers cPanel.\n\nHere’s how it works using cPanel. The basic idea will be the same for using FTP.\n\nLog in into your hosting account and go to cPanel and select File Manager.\n\nWhen the file manager opens, go to public_html → wp-config.php. Right-click on the file and select Edit.\n\nThen scroll down to the end of the file and insert the following code snippet above the “/* That’s all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */” line:\n\ndefine('ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true);\n\nSave the changes.\n\nNow, open your website and log out and sign back in. You should now be able to upload restricted files to your WordPress website.\n\nEdit theme’s functions.php file (Allow specific file types)\n\nIf you’d prefer the manual route but with a more targeted approach, you can also edit your theme’s functions.php file to specify which file types you want to allow uploading on your website.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a plugin like the free Code Snippets plugin, which provides a simpler way of managing the types of code snippets that you add to the functions.php file.\n\nIf you want to use the functions.php file directly instead of using Code Snippets, it’s essential that you set up a child theme first. Otherwise, your changes will be overwritten the next time you update your theme.\n\nHere’s how it works to edit the functions.php file – but if you’re using Code Snippets, all you need to do is add the same code snippet via the plugin’s interface.\n\nThe functions.php file is located in the wp-content/themes folder inside the folder of your child theme. You can access the file via FTP or cPanel File Manager.\n\nIf using cPanel, log in into your hosting account and go to cPanel and select File Manager.\n\nWhen the file manager opens, go to public_html → wp-content → themes. Then open the child theme that is active on your site and select the functions.php file found inside the folder of the theme. Right-click on the file and select Edit.\n\nScroll to the end of the functions.php file and add the following code snippet:\n\nfunction my_custom_mime_types( $mimes ) { // New allowed mime types. $mimes['svg'] = 'image/svg+xml'; $mimes['svgz'] = 'image/svg+xml'; $mimes['doc'] = 'application/msword'; // Optional. Remove a mime type. unset( $mimes['exe'] ); return $mimes; } add_filter( 'upload_mimes', 'my_custom_mime_types' );\n\nSave these changes before exiting the file.\n\nIn the above code, we informed WordPress to allow uploading of the svg and doc file types. You can modify the code and add your desired file type.\n\nChange network settings (Multisite only)\n\nTo enable the upload of restricted file types in WordPress multisite, you need to open your WordPress dashboard, go to Settings → Network Settings, and scroll down to the Upload file type option.\n\nOn the right of that option, there is an input field. You will need to add the extension of the file you want to upload to your website and then save your settings.
