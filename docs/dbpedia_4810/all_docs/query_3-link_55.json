So, no excuses; your site needs a good favicon. Luckily, setting a favicon in WordPress is very easy. Here, we’ll explain how to change the favicon of your WordPress site!\n\nWe’ve been writing about favicons for years. This article about favicons and branding will tell you what you must think about. Please read it, and make sure your favicon is good and stands out. Plus, we’ve added a preview of your favicon in the search appearance section of Yoast SEO so you can see how Google will show your site in the SERPs.\n\nHow to change your favicon in WordPress\n\nSome things to keep in mind for favicons\n\nKeep in mind that Google has some guidelines for showing your favicons in the search results:\n\nGoogle Search allows only one favicon per website, which is defined by its hostname. Thus, https://www.example.com/ and https://news.example.com/ can each have their own favicons, but https://www.example.com/sub-site, being a subdirectory, shares the main site’s favicon.\n\nFavicon guidelines include:\n\nOnly one favicon per main site and its subdirectories.\n\nFavicons must be accessible to Googlebot and Googlebot-Image.\n\nA favicon should accurately represent your site’s brand.\n\nFavicons should be sized in multiples of 48px square, though SVGs are size-flexible.\n\nKeep your favicon URL consistent.\n\nInappropriate favicons, including explicit or hateful imagery, will be replaced by Google with a default icon.\n\nThat was easy, wasn’t it? So, no more excuses, get to it. Change that favicon on your WordPress site!\n\nRead more: Favicons and your online brand »"
