Plus, if you click on it, it’s like a little map back to the main page!\n\nThe Site Logo is a dynamic widget that displays the site logo. However, the logo can only be replaced or deleted in the Elementor Site Identity Settings or WordPress Customizer. With this widget, you have control over design stuff, like its size, where it sits on the page, and more.\n\nSam is building a website for a design agency. They want the website to reflect the agency’s unique style and showcase their portfolio of stunning designs. As Sam works on the homepage & designs the header, they decide to use the Site Logo widget to add the agency’s logo to the top-left corner of the page.\n\nIn addition, Sam takes advantage of the widget’s customization options to experiment with different logo placements and sizes on various pages, ensuring that the logo complements the content and design of each page."
