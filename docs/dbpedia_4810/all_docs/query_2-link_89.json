        "text": "If you’re an agency or freelancer aiming to boost your revenue by offering web hosting to clients, you have two options.\n\nYou can use your own server and manage all the technical aspects yourself, or you can make your life much easier (and profitable) by signing up with a reseller hosting company who free you from dealing with hosting issues, allowing you to focus on growing your business.\n\nThe challenge lies in choosing the right partner.\n\nThe perfect reseller hosting platform strikes a balance between cost-effectiveness, quality hosting products and comprehensive features.\n\nIn this guide we’ll help you identify what to look for in a reseller hosting partner to guarantee your long-term success.\n\nWhat features should you prioritize in a hosting reseller program?\n\nWhat potential issues should you be aware of when selecting a hosting provider?\n\nHigh-availability platform\n\nIf you’re an agency building and managing websites for clients, your reputation hangs on the reliability and performance of these sites.\n\nHigh-availability hosting ensures that your clients’ websites are always up and running, no matter what.\n\nIf a server has issues, the system is designed to switch to a backup without missing a beat, meaning your clients’ sites stay online, keeping their businesses running smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, does the reseller host offer fully redundant web, database, FTP and mail servers, so your customers’ resources and data is never tied to any one server?\n\nMore than just hosting\n\nHosting files and scripts is just one part of running a website.\n\nDoes the reseller host include essential features (fully integrated in to their platform) such as…?\n\nPurchase/renew domain names\n\nDNS control\n\nDatabase management\n\nSSL Certificates\n\nEmail\n\nCDN\n\nBackups\n\nPHP version control\n\nStaging/cloning\n\nMalware scanning\n\nWAF\n\nEasy website management\n\nIntuitive control panels like our own My20i simplify account management, client billing, and resource allocation, so you spend less time on administrative tasks.\n\nAsk for a demo of the control panel before you commit to purchasing.\n\nWhite label branding and customization\n\nThe platform should let you brand the hosting services with your logo and colours, giving you a professional appearance.\n\nPlus, a good reseller host will give you the tools to create your own bespoke hosting plans.\n\nFor example, at 20i you can choose to create a one-size fits all product, a range of pre-determined plans and even a bespoke plan per customer – the choice is yours.\n\nClient portal and automation\n\nIf you’re planning on giving your customers control of their hosting, domains or email, a user-friendly client portal and automation features streamlines your operations and enhances client satisfaction.\n\nEfficient billing, invoicing, and client management tools are also vital for running your reseller hosting business smoothly.\n\nLook for a platform flexible enough to use different billing platform such as HostShop or WHMCS and an active API to integrate with your systems.\n\nTeam collaboration\n\nSharing an account’s log in with full access to everything, with every one, is incredibly insecure and exposes sensitive information to whoever has access.\n\nLook for a solution that gives you unlimited team members access, each with different permissions and admin rights.\n\nEasy migration\n\nMigrating in clients to your hosting shouldn’t be an extreme sport, or cost you any money for the privilege.\n\nLook for a reseller host that gives you the tools to easily migrate as many clients as you want, at any time and with out any downtime.\n\nEco-friendly\n\nThe internet is responsible for around 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That’s similar to the amount produced by the global airline industry.\n\nBy hosting your clients on a green hosing platform, you can be assured that your websites are stored on servers that avoid contributing to climate change.\n\nExpert customer support\n\nExceptional customer support can significantly contribute to your success as a reseller.\n\nLook for companies that offer 24/7 support and have a solid reputation for customer service.\n\nGreat value for money\n\nCheap does not always mean good value. The pricing structure should enable you to make a fair profit while offering competitive prices to your clients.\n\n20iSitegroundHostGator Monthly Price£69.99£120$59.99 Hosting Accounts50024250 SSD Disk per SiteUnlimited1.67GB0.5GB No. Active Sites*500120\n\n(1GB per 4 accounts) Standard Mailbox Size10GBUses Website\n\nDiskspaceUses Website\n\nDiskspace Unlimited Databases1024 MBUses Website\n\nDiskspaceUses Website\n\nDiskspace\n\n*WordPress site using 1GB RAM\n\nFind out more"
