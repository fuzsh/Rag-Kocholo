More information on SSH keys is available here.\n\nYou can generate an SSH key pair in Mac OS following these steps:\n\nOpen up the Terminal by going to Applications > Utilities > Terminal\n\nIn the terminal, use the following command to start the key generation\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa):\n\nLeave this empty to create the key in the default location, which is /home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa. The public key file will be created in the very same location, and with the same name, but with the .PUB extension.\n\nAfterwards you will be prompted to choose a password. This is the password required to use the private key.\n\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n\nThat completes the key generation. Below is an example of the entire process:\n\nMac_user: ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\n\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):\n\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n\nEnter same passphrase again:\n\nYour identification has been saved in id_rsa.\n\nYour public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.\n\nThe key fingerprint is:\n\n16:8e:e8:f2:1d:c9:b9:cf:43:9a:b3:3c:c1:1f:95:93 Mac_user\n\nThis will create a private key written to /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa and a public key written to /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n\nAfter that you will have to upload the public key in Site Tools > Devs > SSH Keys Manager, go to Import and paste the key. Load the private key in your Terminal using the ssh-add command:"
