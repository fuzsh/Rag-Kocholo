        "text": "When I open the builder I don’t see the elements on the canvas\n\nIf you open the builder and you don’t see the elements in the canvas but they are shown in the structure panel, and if you are using Cloudflare, then this is a known problem caused by a conflict between the Cloudflare Rocket Loader™ / other performance optimization feature and the Bricks builder JavaScript.\n\nMethod 1) Configuration Rules\n\nCreate a configuration rule for builder mode.\n\nLog into the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\nSelect your account and website.\n\nGo to Rules > Configuration Rules.\n\nCreate a new Rule, give it a name, and choose Custom filter expression\n\nField: URI Query String\n\nOperator: contains\n\nValue: bricks=run\n\nConfigure “Then the settings are…”:\n\nAdd Rocket Loader and leave the checkbox empty.\n\nLeave the other settings empty.\n\nSave the rule by clicking “Deploy”.\n\nMethod 2) Disable Rocket Loader\n\nDisable the Rocket Loader™ in the Cloudflare dashboard:\n\nLog into the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\nSelect your account and website.\n\nGo to Speed > Optimization.\n\nScroll down until you find Rocket Loader.\n\nTurn it off.\n\nMethod 3) Disable SiteGround Worker Routes\n\nIf the above 2 methods do not work and you are using SiteGround hosting, please check and disable the Worker created by SiteGround.\n\nLog into the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\nSelect your account and website.\n\nGo to Workers Routes.\n\nIf sg_worker exists or another suspicious worker is defined without your awareness, you can remove it.\n\nCopy/paste elements or styles not working\n\nBricks 1.5.1 uses the Clipboard API to copy and paste elements and styles across different domains.\n\nCopy/paste is only supported for pages served over HTTPS.\n\nUsing Firefox\n\nFirefox is more restrictive regarding reading from this API, which prevents the paste action, and therefore it requires the user to manually grant permission to use the API.\n\nTo do so, please follow these steps in your Firefox browser:\n\nEnter about:config in navigation bar\n\nClick “Accept the Risk and Continue”\n\nSearch clipboard and set dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText and dom.events.testing.asyncClipboard to true\n\nRestart Firefox\n\nInternal server error (500) when trying to edit homepage with Bricks\n\nIf you see a screen similar to the above, showing an internal server error (500) when trying to edit a page with Bricks (often reported as the homepage), you should look at the server logs and adjust the server configuration. This error is most probably caused by a security server configuration that prevents the request to hit WordPress and Bricks.\n\nSome servers do not have the SecResponseBodyLimit defined leading to errors like:\n\nModSecurity: Output filter: Response body too large (over limit of 1048576, total not specified).\n\n(Note: the SecResponseBodyLimit sets the maximum response body size that will be accepted for buffering).\n\nCheck this forum post for possible solutions. If the issue persists, please contact your hosting support for guidance.\n\nFor GoDaddy users, you might need to add this line of code in your .htaccess file (first line)\n\nSubstituteMaxLineLength 10M\n\nMy Blog page is not using the posts archive template\n\nThe Blog page (WordPress Posts Page set in the Settings > Reading) is a special WordPress page, and therefore it is not an archive. If you want to set a Bricks template for the Blog page, you would need to set the template condition Individual and select the Blog page.\n\nI’m using SVG files in Bricks elements but I cannot change their color\n\nThis usually happens when your SVG file contains inline styles which override the styles generated by the Bricks builder. If you want to use these SVG files in combination with the Bricks style’s controls, you need to remove the inline styles from the SVG file before uploading it to the WordPress installation.\n\nCustom Fonts not working on the frontend\n\nIf your custom fonts are not displayed in the frontend, it is probably because your WordPress website is delivered via HTTPS, but your WordPress URLs are still set to HTTP (WordPress Settings » General).\n\nChanging the WordPress URLs from http:// to https:// will fix the problem and your fonts will be displayed correctly from now on.\n\nYouTube background video doesn’t autoplay on mobile\n\nThis restriction is imposed by the YoutTube iFrame Player API and cannot be influenced by us. See https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Mobile_considerations\n\nHowever, Vimeo and local videos (mp4) should work as long as the mobile device is not in low-battery mode.\n\nSlider doesn’t autoplay / Animation Flickering\n\nThis is most likely caused by the reduced motion or animation setting of your operating system.\n\nOn Windows, please make sure that the “Show animations in windows” setting is enabled:\n\nOn macOS, please make sure that the “Reduce motion” setting is NOT enabled:\n\nInvalid Post Type / Custom Post Type 404 Errors\n\nThis problem is probably the most common problem in WordPress: your custom post type returns a 404 error. In most cases, however, the problem can be solved very easily.\n\nRe-save your permalink settings\n\nAll you have to do is go to WordPress » Settings » Permalinks and click on “Save Changes”.\n\nCheck for slug conflicts\n\nThe slug refers to the user-friendly and URL-valid name of a post, page, category, tag, or any content (even images) within your website. It is a part of the URL that identifies a specific piece of content.\n\nLet’s assume you have a “Portfolio” page whose slug is “portfolio”. Now you create a custom post type called “Portfolio”, whose slug is also “portfolio”. If you now try to call up a single post from your portfolio (yoursite.com/portfolio/your-portfolio-post), there will be a 404 error too. To solve this issue, rename either the page slug, or the custom post type slug to something else. Re-save your permalinks again, and everything should work as expected.\n\nBuilder changes not saved\n\nIf you save changes in the builder and everything appears to be saved, but upon refreshing or viewing on the frontend the changes are lost, it could be due to an issue with your database schema.\n\nSpecifically, check the meta_value column in your wp_postmeta table (or your table prefix, e.g., psjw_postmeta). This column should be set to “LONGTEXT” to ensure it can store large amounts of data. If it’s set to a type with a lower storage capacity, such as “TEXT,” it may not save larger data correctly.\n\nFor more details on storage limitations, refer to this resource: Understanding Storage Sizes for MySQL TEXT Data Types.\n\nWordPress defaults to using “LONGTEXT” for the meta_value column, which allows for much larger data storage. See the default schema here: WordPress Database Description.\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n\nCheck your meta_value column type in the wp_postmeta table (or psjw_postmeta).\n\nEnsure it is set to “LONGTEXT.”\n\nYou can change the column type to “LONGTEXT” using the following MySQL command:\n\nALTER TABLE your_prefix_postmeta MODIFY COLUMN meta_value LONGTEXT;\n\nReplace your_prefix_postmeta with your actual table name, e.g., psjw_postmeta.\n\nVerify that other columns in your postmeta table match the default WordPress schema.\n\nIf you are not comfortable making these changes or are using a managed hosting provider, it’s best to get in touch with your hosting provider. They can help address this issue, which might persist across different hosting services due to the migration of the incorrect database schema."
