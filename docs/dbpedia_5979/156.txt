Man on the Moon is a 1999 American biographical comedy-drama film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, starring Jim Carrey. The film was directed by Milo≈° Forman and also features Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti. DeVito worked with Kaufman on the Taxi television series, though DeVito did not appear in the film as his Taxi character. Other members of that show's cast, including Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd, and Jeff Conaway, make cameo appearances in the film, playing themselves. Notably absent was Tony Danza, who at the time of filming was performing in "A View from the Bridge" on Broadway. The film also features Patton Oswalt in a minor role.

The story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the comedy clubs and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as Latka Gravas on the Taxi sitcom, which was popular for viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running feud with wrestler Jerry "The King" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.
