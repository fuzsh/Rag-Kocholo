        "text": "The story of the space race takes a comical detour in Fly Me To The Moon, a new dramedy that sees Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum try to fake the Moon landing.\n\nDirected by You’s Greg Berlanti and produced by Johansson, the Apple TV+ movie tells an intriguing story about America’s die-hard determination to be the first nation to step foot on the surface of the Moon before their Soviet rivals can beat them to the punch.\n\nCombining elements of 1960s period drama with light comedy and an ensemble cast that always delivers, Fly Me To The Moon looks set to tell a story that has all the right ingredients to be a hit.\n\nWhat else do we know about it? Well, consider this story your own mission control and keep scrolling for key details like its release date, trailers, plot and cast.\n\nHow can I watch Fly Me To The Moon?\n\nFly Me To The Moon is out now in UK cinemas, having landed on the big screen on Friday, 12 July. It will later be available to stream on Apple TV+.\n\nIs there a trailer for Fly Me To The Moon?\n\nThe first trailer for Fly Me To The Moon arrived in April. In it, we meet Johansson’s Kelly Jones, the marketing maestro that Nasa calls upon to help secure their space race victory by devising a convincing Plan B.\n\nThe trailer also gives us a glimpse at the film’s humour and romantic underpinning. Watch it below:\n\n​​What is the plot of Fly Me To The Moon?\n\nSet against the Space Race between America and Russia in the 1960s, Fly Me To The Moon sees a group of people tasked with filming a fake Moon landing that could be aired to the general public in case the actual one failed.\n\nWith “Nasa’s historic Apollo 11 Moon landing” in full swing, the movie’s synopsis says that Johansson's character is “brought in to fix Nasa’s public image” and “sparks fly in all directions as marketing maven Kelly Jones (Johansson) wreaks havoc on launch director Cole Davis’s (Tatum) already difficult task.”\n\nWhile the film’s story isn’t officially based on actual events, its plot is certainly prevalent among conspiracy theorists, many of whom believe that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was recruited for just such a job. In fact, Fly Me To The Moon even makes a nod to this rumour during the final moments of its trailer.\n\nWho is in the cast of Fly Me To The Moon?\n\nJohansson stars as Kelly Jones, the marketing expert who Nasa believes can turn audience perception of their operation around. Meanwhile, Tatum plays Cole Davis, a war veteran-turned-Nasa employee who is working on the Moon mission.\n\nOriginally, Tatum’s role was set to be played by Chris Evans back when Ozark filmmaker Jason Bateman was set to helm the project. Unfortunately, when Bateman dropped out, the ensuing delay resulted in Evans bowing out too but thankfully Tatum was able to take his place.\n\nElsewhere, Fly Me To The Moon will feature appearances from Woody Harrelson as Moe Berkus, the Nasa suit who asks Kelly to fake the Moon landing, with Community actor Jim Rash playing Lance Vespertine, the filmmaker charged with shooting the fake footage.\n\nRay Romano will also star, alongside 21 Jump Street’s Joseph Chrest and The Continental’s Colin Woodell."
