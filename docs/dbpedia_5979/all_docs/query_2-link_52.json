        "text": "If you’re going to make another movie about the moon landing, you need a clear purpose, an angle, as journalists say, to differentiate it from the many, many movies that have already been made about the 1960s space race.\n\nThe angle advertised in trailers for “Fly Me to the Moon” is that the movie takes a dark conspiracy theory — that NASA faked the moon landing — and uses it as the foundation for a light, strawberry-lemonade-summer rom-com starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.\n\nThis absurd tonal combination is supposed to differentiate the movie from more recent, earnest takes on the space race, such as “Hidden Figures” (2016), as well as past satirical movies about faking the moon landing, like “Capricorn One” (1978).\n\nSurprisingly, I found that the movie raised some interesting questions — not about the veracity of the moon landing, and definitely not about the romance between Johansson and Tatum’s characters. \"Fly Me to the Moon” shines when it doesn’t try to just tell a story about the moon landing, but instead examines how those stories get constructed, and why.\n\nWhat is 'Fly Me to the Moon' about?\n\nEven though it’s set in 1969, “Fly Me to the Moon” feels very 2024, reflecting our concerns about marketing and truth and whether or not “America” really means something.\n\nThe two main characters in the film each have their own motivation for going to the moon, and the tension between them is what I liked best about the film.\n\nKelly Jones, played wonderfully by Johansson, is a smart, cynical con artist *cough* advertising executive who relies on her femininity to sell products to men. At various points, she pretends to be a pregnant mother and a fluttering Southern belle to get what she wants.\n\nKelly’s worldview is established early on in the film, when her assistant Ruby (Anna Garcia) argues that they should stop advertising for The Dow Chemical Company, which produces Napalm. Kelly responds that the company also makes plastic and Styrofoam, which causes Ruby to choke on the disposable cup she’s drinking out of.\n\nKelly isn’t there to make moral judgements. She’s there to sell things.\n\nWhich, of course, causes some strain when she meets Cole Davis (Channing Tatum), a Korean War veteran turned NASA scientist who wears his sense of honor as tightly as his short-sleeve sweaters. His motivations are pure: God, science and the legacy of the astronauts killed in the Apollo 1 launch.\n\nCole is the director for the upcoming Apollo 11 launch, which is in danger of not happening due to waning public interest and government funding in NASA. Enter Moe Berkus (Woody Harrelson), a mysterious government agent who has two main characteristics: a hatred of Communists and a fondness for cutting his own lemon to go with his Scotch. Moe hires Kelly to reignite passion for the moon.\n\nThe tension between Kelly and Cole is funny and interesting, and Johansson and Tatum seem most at ease getting under each other’s skin.\n\nHer requests for photos and interviews distract him and his engineers and he retaliates by putting her office in a windowless basement. The next day, he walks in to find two of his best scientists installing a picture window and he nearly loses it. It's clear that Cole’s angst is not just about her, but about what she represents: that doing good work is no longer enough. He must also market himself, his work and even the moon itself in order to get the American public to care.\n\n'Let's not forget. We're selling America'\n\nSelling the moon, it turns out, looks a lot like selling underwear: in an attempt to get people invested in the moon launch, Kelly orchestrates brand deals with companies like Fruit of the Loom.\n\nBut, she says, “Let’s not forget. We’re selling America here.”\n\nThere’s a delightful confusion here: what is America, exactly? Is it the products it makes? Is it capitalism or democracy or both? Does it only have meaning in opposition to the Soviets?\n\nThe film gets more meta — at one point, the characters are not sure if they are watching the real moon landing or the faked one.\n\nI certainly did not expect this movie to make me think about the nature of representation and how the idea of America is constructed.\n\nThe cringey romance throughout the movie is barely worth mentioning. Every single date they go on, they talk about work, so when they kiss, it’s like watching two coworkers who suddenly decide to make-out.\n\nThe film does a much better job of raising questions than answering them. The lukewarm final conclusion between Kelly and Cole is exactly what you'd expect from a blockbuster; basically, they both realize that it’s okay to lie sometimes, but you shouldn’t lie too much.\n\nAnd yet, I still enjoyed “Fly Me to the Moon.” It’s an odd film, but it gave me something to think about.\n\n'Fly Me to the Moon' 3.5 stars\n\nGreat ★★★★★ Good ★★★★\n\nFair ★★★ Bad ★★ Bomb ★\n\nDirector: Greg Berlanti\n\nCast: Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Woody Harrelson, Anna Garcia, Ray Romano.\n\nRating: PG-13 for strong language and some smoking.\n\nHow to watch: In theaters Friday, July 12."
