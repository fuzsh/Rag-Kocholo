        "text": "The movie, which was nominated for 10 awards, was completely shut out, not winning a single trophy.\n\nLily Gladstone had been the favourite to win the Best Actress trophy heading into the ceremony but was beaten by her chief competitor Emma Stone.\n\nAdapted from the non-fiction best-seller by David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon tells the real-life story of the 1920s Osage Native American tribe murders - after oil was discovered on their lands.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe epic unfolds across three and a half hours and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone and more.\n\nIf you're wondering where to watch the film, read on for everything you need to know.\n\nWhere to watch Killers of the Flower Moon in the UK\n\nThe film is now available to stream on Apple TV+, with the streamer having added it to its library on 12th January 2024.\n\nThat was significantly later than the original date, with the initial plan having been for only a two-week theatrical window from Friday 6th October before making it available to stream on 20th October.\n\nBut, due in part to a wave of strong early reviews and the theatrical success of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the limited release plan was scrapped, with the film instead opening in cinemas more widely.\n\nIf you don't have Apple TV+, there's still another option to watch – as Killers of the Flower Moon is also available to rent or purchase on digital and on demand on Prime Video at a price of £13.99.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon arrived on Apple TV+ on 12th January 2024.
