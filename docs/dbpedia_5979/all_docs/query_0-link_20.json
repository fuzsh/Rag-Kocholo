        "text": "December 14, 2015\n\n— Forty-three years after he became the last man on the moon, Gene Cernan now has a launch date in movie theaters.\n\nCernan, who as commander of NASA's Apollo 17 mission took the last — or at least most recent — step off the lunar surface on Dec. 14, 1972, recounts his journey in his own words in \"The Last Man on the Moon,\" a new documentary opening on U.S. screens on Feb. 26, 2016.\n\n\"This film is the story of a boy from 'Any Town USA' who grew up in a family of modest means and with a seemingly impossible dream to fly,\" said Cernan, commenting on the film's upcoming release. \"As fate would have it, I lived that dream, becoming a Naval Aviator, which in turn gave me the opportunity to call the moon my home.\"\n\nProduced by Mark Stewart Productions, \"The Last Man on the Moon\" was five years in the making. The documentary features a wealth of rarely-seen archival footage and takes Cernan back to the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, to Arlington National Cemetery, and to his ranch in Texas where \"he has tried to find respite from a past that refuses to let him go.\"\n\n'The Last Man on the Moon' trailer.
