It blends the contemporary space race of the 1960s with a story about a Victorian-era expedition to the Moon.\n\nThe film opens with a multinational lunar expedition sponsored by the United Nations landing on the Moon in 1964. The astronauts quickly make a startling discovery—that a British expedition actually preceded them by 65 years. Through flashbacks, the viewer learns that a group of Victorian adventurers managed to successfully land a flight to the Moon, which they found inhabited by menacing creatures that resemble insects. The UN astronauts, however, find only ruins of the civilization, with no trace of the inhabitants. An explorer from the earlier mission speculates that the creatures died after contracting a common cold from one of his colleagues.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
