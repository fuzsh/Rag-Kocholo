        "text": "This storyline leans into the conspiracy theory that NASA faked the US moon landing in 1969.\n\nThe theory began to spread in 1976 when Bill Kaysing, a writer who briefly worked at a rocket engine company, published a book called \"We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle,\" which claimed that the government faked the moon landing to compete with the USSR.\n\nThough NASA has denied this claim, it has become embedded in pop culture.\n\nGreg Berlanti, the director of the new film, told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday that the movie is really about the importance of the truth.\n\n\"When you see the movie, without giving away the ending, you realize that so much of it is about why the truth is important,\" Berlanti said. \"And so I think I was fine to take on an OG conspiracy theory, knowing that in the end, what we were really trying to say why the truth matters.\"\n\nBerlanti told Entertainment Weekly in May that NASA gave the production team their blessing and allowed them to film at Cape Kennedy in Florida, where Apollo 11 launched in 1969.\n\nHere are the accurate moments in \"Fly Me To The Moon.\"\n\nNeil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins are the few characters in the movie based on real-life figures\n\nThe lead characters in \"Fly Me To The Moon,\" Kelly and Cole, appear to be fictional. However, the movie does feature some real-life figures.\n\nNick Dillenburg, Christian Zuber, and Colin Woodell play Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin: the first humans to land on the moon.\n\nThe movie also features NASA astronauts Ed White, Roger Chaffee, and Gus Grissom. In real life and in the movie, they died in a cabin fire in 1967 during a launch rehearsal test for the Apollo 1 spaceship.\n\nThe final two real-life figures in the movie are former USSR president Nikita Khrushchev and Yuri Gargarin, the first man to travel to space in 1961.\n\nRelated stories\n\nNASA used a public relations campaign promote the space program\n\nKelly didn't exist, but NASA had an extensive public relations campaign to promote the space program in the 1960s.\n\nAt the time, the US was fighting the Vietnam War, dealing with racial tensions during the civil rights movement, and worrying about a potential nuclear war with the USSR.\n\nSo officials had to persuade the public that the space program was worth the money.\n\nAccording to David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek's book, \"Marketing the Moon,\" NASA decided to promote facts about space travel through methods including press releases and educational programs to get the public interested. NASA thought being transparent would win the public over.\n\nTelevision networks did simulate part of the space flight, but the landing was not faked\n\nNASA's PR team helped television stations broadcast live footage of part of Apollo 11's flight.\n\nTelevision networks used models to simulate the rest of the space flight when live footage was unavailable. But there's no evidence to suggests NASA or any network tried to fake the moon landing.\n\nA television camera was mounted on the side of Apollo 11 to capture Armstrong's first steps on the moon, and the rest is history.\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" is out now in theaters."
