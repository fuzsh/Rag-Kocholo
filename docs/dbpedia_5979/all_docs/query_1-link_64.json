        "text": "I remember this moment in history vividly. I was 10 years old. My family and I had gathered around our lone black and white television set to watch the historic moment. A few minutes before the actual landing our TV stopped working! My father briefly attempted to revive it with no success so we galloped to our neighbour's house and explained our dilemma. We ended up watching the moment with them in their home. Had they not been at home, my entire family and I would have most likely been left out of this historic event. I will never forget it and have relayed the story to my children many times. The moon landing is not just part of American - and world - history, it's also very much a part of our family history. On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon.\n\n- KERYN PAUL, OMAHA, NEBRASKA, USA\n\nWe watched the moon landing on a 1968 Bush TV, which was fairly newly bought so we could receive BBC2. At age 11, I had no real appreciation of just how risky and political the moon landing really was. My mum went to bed, but dad shouted up \"500 feet to go\" and she came down to see the final landing. There was a debate about whether the astronauts would do the walk right away or sleep first. So we went to bed at about 0100 or 0200. In the morning, we discovered they had just got on with it. My grandmother lived with us and I remember thinking how much change she had seen since her birth in the 1890s. A few days later our class teacher ran a session on the landing. It was the final week of my final year at primary school and so this was just about the last topic we covered. A few months later a pop record came out, Space Oddity by an unknown singer - David Bowie.\n\n- JACK KIRK, DONCASTER, UK\n\nI clearly remember watching the moon landings when I was five years old in Kuwait. We could not afford a television at the time so we squeezed into a neighbour's apartment with about six other families to watch it. It was the first time I can remember watching TV and the broadcast quality was grainy black and white. I didn't really understand it at the time watching these people bouncing around like balloons on the TV. However, I did sense that it was a moment of great importance. Everybody, including my parents and all our neighbours, were all watching it in a deep concentrated silence. I had never seen them all remain so quiet for so long - a record five minutes or so! It sparked a real spirit of innovation in us, because afterwards my parents said to me that if I study hard I can land on the moon or achieve anything I want. You could say it had a lasting impact, as I went on to become a fully qualified mechanical engineer.\n\n- ANIL MATTHEW, DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\n\nI was nine years old and I watched the landings with my dad in Ireland. We were living in Dublin at the time. For me as a nine-year-old and my dad, who was 30 years older than me, it was an equally important event. Right throughout the landing, I could not ignore this sense of being alive at this moment in time to be able to witness the single biggest achievement in the history of the human race. It was even more miraculous, considering the level of technology they had at their disposal at the time. Years later I even wrote songs about it, and I still enjoy recounting the feeling to people who weren't around or old enough at the time. The only thing that could beat that would be witnessing the first Mars walk. I will consider myself very lucky if my life spans those two landmark events.\n\n- KEVIN SOLAN, RENNES, FRANCE\n\nI was nine years old at the time. My family and I sat glued to our black and white set watching every movement of the spaceship and lunar module. The pictures to us were amazing and everything that happened was just so exciting. We couldn't believe what was happening. So as not to miss a single second my mum, instead of cooking meals, made what seemed to be millions of sandwiches and we lived on them for the duration of the event. I watched a moon landing programme with my 14-year-old daughter recently and she was just as mesmerised as I was all those years ago. When we watched the landings in 1969 I vowed then that I would one day go to Kennedy Space Centre and watch a rocket lift off. Thirty seven years later, we watched a space shuttle launch. Still just as exciting, still just as amazing.\n\n- JUDI MURFITT, HULL, UK"
