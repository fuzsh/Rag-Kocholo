        "text": "By PETER APPLEBOME\n\nEW YORK -- One chilly November night, a crowd of about 250 people who looked as if they had been cryogenically frozen 20 years ago and then unpacked for the occasion, poured into the lunchroom of Midtown West elementary school on West 48th Street in Manhattan.\n\nNeatly arrayed on the lunch tables in front of them were hundreds of half-pint milk cartons and chocolate-chip cookies on bright red paper napkins. There to greet them was a man wearing a wool stadium coat, his shoulders hunched forward and eyes ablaze.\n\nThey cheered. He beamed. And then, as the crowd surged toward him, the man broke into a spasmodic victory dance, his knees pumping and his arms thrust out awkwardly like a pelican learning to disco.\n\nAnd then something strange happened. The director Milos Forman stopped the action with a delighted, \"Perfect, Perfect,\" and the crowd reverted to unfashionably dressed extras recreating one of the routinely bizarre moments in the career of the performer Andy Kaufman, his Carnegie Hall Concert April 26, 1979, when he took everyone in his entire audience of 2,800 people who chose to come along in rented buses for milk and cookies at a nearby school when the show ended.\n\nBut though the filming stopped, the man in the stadium coat seemed not to have noticed. He kept the same hunched-over look, the same expression of benign, bug-eyed ebullience that Kaufman displayed at moments of particular delight in a career that ended in 1984 when he died of cancer at the age of 35. The filming had stopped. But Jim Carrey was still Andy Kaufman.\n\nThat sense of murky, multiple realities apparently never wavered during the three months that Carrey recreated the brief, strange life of Kaufman for the film \"Man on the Moon,\" which is being directed by Forman and is scheduled for release sometime next fall.\n\nAndy Kaufman's life played out like a dada comic's vision as scripted by M.C. Escher, of illusions within deceits and characters willfully blurring the lines between what was real and what was performance. And for the three months of filming, Carrey did the same thing, becoming for weeks Kaufman's foul-smelling, foul-mouthed, lounge lizard, Tony Clifton; taunting Kaufman's real-life wrestling nemesis, Jerry Lawler into belting him in the face on the stage of the David Letterman show much the way he slugged Kaufman, and capturing Kaufman so completely that those who knew him were spooked by the process.\n\nIndeed, as different as they are, Carrey's physical comic style and gift for manic mimicry make him an intriguing choice to play Kaufman. When he speaks of his admiration for Kaufman, it sounds like he is also talking about what he tries to do with his own comedy.\n\n\"It was very important for me to do justice to him,\" Carrey said in a phone interview after the shooting ended. \"He was on such another level. He had a pure need to create. He was like Geppetto. He walked into a room and didn't see people who would like him or not like him, hurt him or help him. He saw the world as his own little puppet show.\"\n\nIn fact, the film begins with a moment that could be a prequel to Carrey's performance last year in \"The Truman Show,\" about a man whose whole life is a television show. \"Man on the Moon\" begins with a Trumanesque moment from Kaufman's childhood -- Andy performing in the basement of his house to imaginary cameras in the walls allegedly broadcasting his antics nationwide on his own television network.\n\n\"Jim called me about coming over to see the audition tape he made,\" said Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-conspirator. \"I didn't know him well, and I was thinking, 'What do I say if it's awful?\" I was thinking of lines like, 'Wow, that's something,' just in case. And when I saw it, I broke down and cried. He got him so right, it was scary. I'm not saying I believe this kind of stuff, but there were people who felt he was channeling Andy. To this day, there are things he did, that I don't know how he could have known about.\"\n\nKaufman, whose public career largely spanned his appearance on the first broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live,\" on Oct. 11, 1975, until his death, seems an unlikely figure to be memorialized in a Hollywood extravaganza. The film's title comes from the R.E.M. song, \"Man on the Moon,\" that Michael Stipe wrote about Kaufman. Courtney Love plays Kaufman's girlfriend, Lynne Margulies; Paul Giamatti portrays Zmuda, and Danny DeVito, who co-produced the movie, is Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro.\n\nThe comic actor perhaps is best remembered for his performance as Latka Gravas, the sweetly muddled immigrant on the television show \"Taxi,\" an appealing but hardly epic role. Those old enough to remember his performances from the 1970s and 1980s, mostly remember stray snippets about his career -- that he was badly injured in a match with a professional wrestler, that he wrestled women, that he could switch on a dime from Latka's befuddled precursor, a hopelessly inept immigrant comedian, to Elvis Presley.\n\nBut to other performers and to a cult of fans, Kaufman remains a singular figure, more performance artist than comic, whose multiple personae, humor without jokes, and wry riffs on his audience's expectations created a comic presence no one else has even approached.\n\n\"Andy wasn't a comedian, he was a behavioral scientist,\" said Carrey, who was so eager to do the role that he worked for about half the $20 million fee he can command and even auditioned to get the part. \"I was hooked the first time I saw him. I think of him as the Neil Armstrong of comedy. He went places no one else had gone. If he was a comedian, he was the only one who didn't need to get a laugh. He didn't care if audiences loved him or hated him as long as he got beneath their veneer and got them emotionally involved.\"\n\nKaufman grew up on his own distant moon in Great Neck, drove a cab after high school and then attended Grahm Junior College in Boston. He was an indifferent student with an artistic sensibility that was one part Fellini, one part children's entertainer and one part the theatrical good-versus-evil world of professional wrestling. Ill-suited for much else, he invented his own brand of comedy.\n\nAt his first club dates, audiences sat in embarrassed silence, not knowing what to make of his bumbling foreign man, groping his way through his utterly inept jokes and impressions. He came on stage and read, \"The Great Gatsby\" in a pretentious English accent as audiences first tittered nervously and then hissed and booed in anger.\n\nHe created apparently unscripted fiascos on live television, strutted like a pig after wrestling women in his guise as the the World's Intergender Wrestling Champion and then offered up snivleling pleas for the audience's forgivenness and affection.\n\nAndy the Good appeared with a gospel singer from Dallas to peform Christian songs, profess his new-found faith in Jesus and apologize for his earlier errant behavior. Andy the Bad sneeringly instructed the populace of Memphis, Tenn., on the proper use of soap and toilet paper, before being sent to the hospital after being slammed head first to the canvas by the wrestler Jerry Lawler.\n\nThe personae played out on so many levels, it was hard for even friends and family to be sure what was real. When Kaufman was Tony Clifton, he drank heavily, though Kaufman did not drink at all, and he smoked, though Kaufman did not smoke. Tony did things sexually that Kaufman would never do.\n\nBut since Tony was portrayed at various times by Kaufman, by Kaufman's brother, Michael, and by Zmuda, audiences and television talk show hosts could never be sure if the Tony Clifton in their presence was Kaufman or not.\n\nZmuda said he once carried on a torrid affair as Tony Clifton with a Las Vegas showgirl who thought she was with Kaufman. For the record, Clifton denied he was Kaufman and threatened to file suit against Kaufman for using his name.\n\nTrue to the spirit of things, even after filming ended, Carrey still referred to both \"Andy\" and \"Tony\" in the third person, as if both were distinct people he'd come to know, like fellow passengers on a particularly interesting cruise.\n\n\"Tony surprised a lot of people,\" he said. \"The first week of filming, Milos came to me and said, 'I don't know how to handle Tony,' He was very upset. He'd gone into Tony's trailer while Tony was being made up, and Tony sliced him to ribbons. But in the end, people developed enormous respect for Tony. His last day on the set was one of the most emotional things I've ever seen. These characters were totally separate, more separate than you could imagine. I'm not saying I had to go insane to do this film, but I know that there were some nights, I went to bed as a character who was insane.\"\n\nCarrey said he still does not know the truth about much of Kaufman's life and art, which is the way everyone wants to keep it.\n\n\"Working with Andy was like working with Harry Houdini,\" said Zmuda. \"There's the magician's code of not giving the secrets away.\"\n\nBut the film is likely to give at least some of them away. Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro, for example, said Kaufman's injury at the hands of Lawler, described at the time as seriously injured cervical vertebrae, which kept Kaufman in a neck brace for months, was simply faked wrestling stagecraft.\n\nZmuda and the writer Bill Zehme are both working on books about Kaufman, to be released about the time of the film; and Kaufman's brother is contemplating a collection of his reflections and Kaufman's own writings, so it is unclear how many of the secrets will survive.\n\n\"He's going to be the hottest dead comedian around,\" said Brian Momchilov, who built an elaborate website devoted to Kaufman.\n\nWhich brings up the ultimate mystery. When reports emerged that Kaufman had cancer, many people, even those close to him, assumed it was an elaborate joke, yet another bit of sleight of hand by a performer who often talked of faking his own death.\n\nZmuda recalls people congratulating Kaufman on yet another brilliant deceit as he was being pushed around in a wheelchair, his hair falling out from chemotherapy. Kaufman's death from lung cancer struck many who knew him as too cruel and too unlikely to be true.\n\n\"I honestly did not believe that Andy had contracted cancer and died,\" said Danny DeVito, one of Kaufman's co-stars on \"Taxi.\" \"Even after he died, I didn't believe it, and a lot of other people felt the same way.\"\n\nEveryone knows it is true. Kaufman died May 16, 1984, and was buried on Long Island in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. But faking his own death would have been so in character, that even those who know he is dead like to keep open the vague notion that maybe it is conceivable he is not.\n\n\"There's something called denial, but 14 1/2 years later, there is still a large group of people who hold out the possibility that he's still alive,\" said Michael Kaufman, who joined his sister Carol and their father Stanley on the set. \"Possibility is a funny word. It's a lot different than probability. In all likelihood, he's gone, but if you ask me if it's possible he's still alive, I'd say it's not out of the realm of possibility. In our family, anything for a joke.\""
