        "text": "Who knew that people have strong feelings about the American flag?\n\nThe Neil Armstrong drama First Man, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival this week (but won’t be released wide until mid-October), has already found itself at the center of a roiling culture-war battle, thanks to its alleged omission of an iconic image: that of the trailblazing astronaut firmly planting the American flag on the moon. The problem? None of the right-wing detractors currently fuming on Twitter have actually seen the film. Oh, and it turns out that the flag was never omitted from the movie in the first place: it can be seen waving on the moon in several shots.\n\nFirst Man is Damien Chazelle’s follow-up to La La Land, and so far it’s received rave early reviews. The outrage began on Friday, after news outlets began aggregating a Telegraph story stating that the film does not depict Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon. According to V.F.’s correspondent at the Venice Film Festival, who has seen the movie, this is technically true; the film does not have a scene specifically showing the flag being planted. It does, however, show the flag on the moon in multiple background shots.\n\nBut thanks to that Telegraph post—cited by publications like Business Insider and the National Review—outrage has spread on the right, fueled by people who seem to believe the flag is absent from the film altogether. People like Florida senator Marco Rubio, who called the supposed decision “total lunacy.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDaily Wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro also clutched his pearls over the movie, writing, “JFK, 1962, on the moon mission: ‘For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.’”\n\n“We literally declared a mission to go to the moon to plant the American flag,” he added. “It wasn't an afterthought. It was the point of the endeavor.”\n\nAnother self-appointed film critic who has not actually seen the movie? Weekly Standard editor at large Bill Kristol, who suggested that people complain to Universal Pictures about the missing flag-planting scene—and tagged the studio’s Twitter handle. He called the decision a “foolish and pernicious falsification of history,” adding, “I imagine it’s not too late to add a scene to the movie.”\n\nIt bears repeating that the film does not eliminate the image of the American flag on the moon. It simply doesn’t make a big set piece out of the flag’s placement—a decision that seems more closely tied to how the film expresses Armstrong’s emotional arc than it is to the film’s feelings about the U.S., its flag, or patriotism. Though that fact may not be able to stop this growing tempest in an American-flag-branded teapot.\n\nHWD Weekly\n\nIn Telluride and Venice, Stars Are Born\n\nEssential Industry and Award News\n\nAnd They're Off\n\nThe 28 Most Intriguing Films of the Fall Festival Season\n\nThe Oscar race is about to begin in Venice, Telluride, and Toronto.\n\nseeing stars\n\nFirst Look: Natalie Portman Is a Bowie-Esque Pop Star in Mysterious Vox Lux\n\nIn a scintillating exclusive teaser for the upcoming film, Portman plays Celeste, a glam-pop supernova.\n\nMovies\n\nAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in Nightbitch\n\n“When people ask me what the movie is about, I’m like, ‘It’s about motherhood and rage,’” says director Marielle Heller in this exclusive first look. “And you either get that or you don’t.”\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nTelevision\n\nCate Blanchett Faces Public Shaming in Disclaimer, Alfonso Cuarón’s Revenge Thriller\n\nThe Roma and Gravity Oscar-winner unveils his unsettling new series, which taps into the ancient human desire for schadenfreude.\n\nHollywood\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Returns to The Avengers, But Not as Iron Man\n\nThe Iron Man star will play iconic villain Doctor Doom in Marvel's next two Avengers movies.\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday.\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nStyle\n\nAs Tensions Continue to Flare Over the War in Gaza, the Upper East Side Is Divided\n\nTalking about the war in Gaza is complicated for Jewish Americans, and in Manhattan’s wealthiest circles, disagreement has created social cloisters."
