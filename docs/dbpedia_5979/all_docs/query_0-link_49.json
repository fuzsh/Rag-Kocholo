        "text": "Tom Hanks co-wrote The Moonwalkers with Christopher Riley, the double BAFTA-nominated writer-director whose work includes many of the most groundbreaking films and television programmes about space for the likes of the BBC, Netflix, and PBS.\n\nThe show tells the stories of the Apollo missions, reflecting their gripping journeys at spectacular scale. Newly filmed interviews between Hanks and astronauts of the current Artemis programme will grant an insight into the return of crewed surface missions to the moon.\n\nHanks himself will provide the voiceover, accompanied by a spectacular original score by Anne Nikitin whose previous work includes the Apple TV+ hit series HIJACK starring Idris Elba and the cult heist movie American Animals starring Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan.\n\nTicket prices\n\nAdults from £25\n\nStudents & Under 18s from £15\n\nUnder 3s go free\n\nYounger children need to be supervised in the space and we ask that parents are considerate of the experience for all our guests.\n\nDates\n\nFrom 6 December 2023 – 13 October 2024\n\nDuration\n\nOne complete show lasts approximately 50 mins. You are welcome to stay for longer than one show.\n\nAudience Suitability\n\nSuitable for all ages. More accessibility information.\n\nThe Visuals of The Moonwalkers\n\nOriginal NASA footage and breath-taking images from Andy Saunders’ Apollo Remastered will transform Lightroom’s vast space into an immersive voyage to the lunar surface, brought to life by co-directors Nick Corrigan and Lysander Ashton of 59 Productions.\n\nOver the course of the Apollo program, the twelve astronauts to set foot on the Moon captured thousands of original photographs on medium-format Hasselblad cameras. For half a century, almost every image of the Moon landings publicly available was produced from a lower-quality copy of these originals.\n\nFor Apollo Remastered Andy Saunders has, for the first time, digitally remastered images from every mission from the original film. Revealing detail that has been lost for half a century, these images offer astounding new insight and a mesmerising retrospective of humankind’s greatest adventure. In Lightroom’s vast space, these images are seen like never before – at a scale that fully immerses the viewer, transporting them to the lunar surface."
