To some, he is a great, intuitive genius like Jerry Lewis, while to others, he is simply a wax face suffering from a hyperactive disorder. Carrey proves his talent and unquestionable virtuosity in the film about the life and art of the eccentric comic Andy Kaufman. Forman gives Carrey room to play while providing a very solid frame. The film shows how Kaufman broke the boundaries of comedy to an extreme extent, evoking as much rage as he did laughter. Though unwilling to compromise with either studio bosses or TV producers, Kaufman is portrayed as a sensitive human being hungry for more than recognition.",

Forman gives Carrey room to play while providing a very solid frame.\n\nThe film shows how Kaufman broke the boundaries of comedy to an extreme extent, evoking as much rage as he did laughter. Though unwilling to compromise with either studio bosses or TV producers, Kaufman is portrayed as a sensitive human being hungry for more than recognition.\n\nMan on the Moon represents a rare Hollywood film. In a sense, it is a self-analysis of the entire field – one in which humanity is of paramount importance. In supporting roles, we can see many of Forman’s trusted faces (i.e. Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli, and Christopher Lloyd) and Kaufman’s colleagues (George Shapiro). The best laughs arise when the comic’s legendary “alter ego,” raunchy nightclub singer Tony Clifton, hits the stage. It is the mystery of his existence that encapsulates the film’s central drama.\n\nLauri Timonen"
