        "text": "BY ADRIAN SMITH\n\nWilliam Blood (Kenneth More) is a man with an incredible immune system and without worries. He spends most of his time working as a human guinea pig for government departments such as the Common Cold and Flu Research Agency. There he frustrates the men in white coats by stubbornly refusing to catch a cold. He never gets ill, and his secret is that he has no emotional attachments. â€œThe minute you get into a relationship with a woman, your guard is down and the coughing will start!â€ News of this remarkable constitution gets to the scientists at N.A.A.R.S.T.I., the National Atomic Research Station and Technological Institute, who are preparing to send the first maned rocket to the moon. They have previously sent up dogs and monkeys, but owing to public complaints about cruelty to animals, they have decided it would be far better to send a human. However, it is far too risky to send one of their trained astronauts. After all, training is expensive. Far better to send William Blood instead in the first rocket, and provided he gets there in one piece, they will then send up the real astronauts. This sounds like a fool-proof plan, but what is not accounted for is a distraction, in the shapely form of stripper Polly (Shirley Anne Field), who has fallen in love with him.\n\nOnce Blood begins his astronaut training he has to face the other jealous astronauts lead by a young Charles Gray, who are furious that they wonâ€™t be the first on the moon after all their preparations. However, he does have the project leader Dr. Davidson (Michael Horden) on his side, and he goes through a rigorous raining regime featuring extreme temperatures and G-force simulators to prepare him for the adventure ahead.\n\nMan in the Moon is a delightful film with a sparkling and witty script written by Bryan Forbes and Michael Relph. Basil Deardenâ€™s direction is inventive and makes use of some excellent location work at RAF Denham alongside impressive sets built at Pinewood Studios. It is a perfect encapsulation of an England on the cusp of great change. Blood, whizzing around in an open-topped Messerschmitt bubble-car, is the epitome of modern man, whilst those in charge at N.A.A.R.S.T.I. he meets are still wearing tweed and smoking pipes. His thinking is progressive, as he has no qualms about seducing a beautiful woman whilst still actively berating the institution of marriage. The Britain of Man in the Moon has one foot in the war years, the other in the Atomic Age, with an endearing performance by Kenneth More at the centre of it all.\n\nIn his forty-year career, Basil Dearden made dozens of film, many of which are now considered classics. With notable hits including Violent Playground (1958), The Blue Lamp (1950) and The League of Gentlemen (1960), he clearly had an affinity for film noir-style crime dramas, and it is perhaps easy to forget that one of his early hits was actually the early Ealing comedy The Goose Steps Out (1942) starring Will Hay. Dearden made many films for Ealing Studios, even contributing to the classic supernatural portmanteau Dead of Night (1945). His last film was the supernatural mystery The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970), frequently cited by Roger Moore as the best film he ever made. Sadly, Dearden died in a car crash shortly after completing the film, the accident occurring in the very spot where months earlier they had shot Roger Mooreâ€™s characterâ€™s car crash for that film.\n\nMan in the Moon is another release in Network Distributingâ€™s â€˜The British Filmâ€™ collection, and as such comes with little bonus material, limited to an original trailer, image gallery and press book. Despite this reservation it is still a superb release. The main reason for watching is to see an excellent transfer from original elements, and like all the films in their collection, Man in the Moon is a forgotten but entertaining gem."
