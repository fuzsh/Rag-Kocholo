        "text": "It takes nearly an hour before the film gets to the fake moon-landing plot you’re being sold in the trailers. The buildup to that story isn’t worth it. What passes as the payoff isn’t worth it, either.\n\nNavigating the plots of this bloated 132-minute film is like herding cats. But there’s only one actual cat in this movie. It’s used for jump scares and comic relief. The kitty also serves as a portent of doom (it’s black) and as the film’s deus ex machina.\n\nI hope the agile animal was paid as well as its costars Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson. They play NASA launch director Cole Davis and advertising expert/con artist Kelly Jones. These potential lovebirds meet in a diner scene that’s so badly written I can’t call it a meet-cute; it’s a meet-ugly. Davis tells Jones she’s on fire, which she misinterprets as meaning she’s hot stuff.\n\nOf course, she really is on fire because, by accident, her book touched the candle on her table. After putting out the flames, Davis leaves quickly, only to return to ramble on about how pretty she looks. Not even Sam Cooke crooning “These Foolish Things” on the soundtrack could make this romantic; Tatum and Johansson are charismatic actors who have zero chemistry together. A brief scene between Jones and a nerdy senator played by Johansson’s husband, Colin Jost, has more heat!\n\nThe screenplay by Rose Gilroy does none of the actors any favors. It’s a hot mess, veering from broad, stereotype-filled comedy to haunting real-life tragedy with no sense of direction. These disparate elements only work if there is a firm handle on the sudden tonal shifts required by the material.\n\nBut it’s clear from the first 10 minutes that director Greg Berlanti lacks the ability to pull everything together. We jump from a re-creation of the Apollo 1 astronauts burning to death to an unfunny scene where Jones, wearing an unconvincing fake pregnancy pillow under her dress, pitches sports cars with seatbelts to board members who are simultaneously terrified and turned on.\n\nJones’s ability to sell the unsellable attracts the attention of Moe Berkus (Harrelson), a shady government agent who never reveals his organizational affiliation. Since NASA is losing public and congressional support for going to the moon, Berkus wants Jones to market the moon to the American people. Jones has a past as shady as Berkus’s methods, so he blackmails her into secretly shooting a fake moon landing; if Apollo 11 fails, the networks will get that footage instead.\n\nInstead of hiring Stanley Kubrick, Jones brings on temperamental commercial director Lance (Jim Rash). Lance is a raging gay stereotype armed with scathing quips about everything. He’s also cruel to the actors playing the astronauts in his simulation. The performance would be less concerning if Lance’s over-the-top mannerisms and actions weren’t played for easy laughs.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones tries to win Davis over with her successful astronaut-based ad campaigns, including one for Tang. You may remember that astronauts drinking Tang was a selling point of that disgusting orange powder. “Fly Me to the Moon” scores some points for mocking the gullibility of the American consumer and how easily we can be taken by a good marketing campaign. But this subplot is quickly abandoned.\n\nDavis wants no part of this chicanery. He’s still grieving Apollo 1, tending a small garden beneath a plaque honoring the men who died, Command Pilot Gus Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee. His colleague Henry (Ray Romano, good in a small role) offers him support and guidance. It feels exploitative to use this tragedy as motivation for a fictional character, but Tatum handles these dramatic scenes well.\n\nStill, “Fly Me to the Moon” misses the chance to focus on Tatum’s true calling. Like George Clooney and Cary Grant before him, he is a handsome bloke who isn’t afraid to make a fool of himself onscreen. In fact, the early scenes of him and Johansson working at NASA have a “Bringing Up Baby” vibe — she’s the force of nature bringing chaos into his orderly, scientific world.\n\nThat’s the perfect recipe for a successful romantic comedy, but this film fails to capitalize on it. Instead, we get one-dimensional characters, familiar space footage we’ve seen a million times before, and a climax that’s just confusing. Everything onscreen is slathered with Daniel Pemberton’s overbearing score.\n\nThe reason romantic comedies fail so often is that they attempt too much. “Fly Me to the Moon” may be the busiest example I’ve ever seen. It’s also one of the worst, despite its eclectic needle drops convincing me that I need to buy its soundtrack album.\n\n★½\n\nFLY ME TO THE MOON\n\nDirected by Greg Berlanti. Written by Rose Gilroy.
