        "text": "Percy Honri as an ukelele-playing moon, which formed part of his 'Concordia' act, a musical show. This film was made as an advertisement for the show and may have been used as an 'entr'acte' film, to cover a costume change. We see Honri's face as a man in the moon with a tiny drawn-on body with fingers for dancing legs and miniature ukele. The moon rises, plays and dances and then sets again.\n\nAnother version of this film was recently found in the Mitchell and Kenyon collection. This was taken from a negative that may have been intended to be processed very dark to hide the tears in the black cloth through which the head appears. Otherwise the two films are very similar.\n\nBryony Dixon"
