        "text": "The award-winning National Theatre of Brent celebrate the extraordinary events of 1969, with a glorious comedy about when Neil Armstrong became the First Man on the Moon.\n\nIn the words of Desmond Olivier Dingle, artistic director and chief executive...\n\nIt seems only yesterday when the moon was just a mysterious light in the unknown depths of the night sky that man could only guess at the purpose of and no one knew anything about whatsoever.\n\nThen, all of a sudden in 1969, something remarkable occurred.\n\nThe famous Space Race began literally out of the blue and the infamous President Nixon, on the run avoiding investigation for dodgy dealing, ordered the US space race to begin with the famous words, \"Let the Space Race begin!\" - or words to that effect.\n\nAnd, as if that weren't enough, besides this historic and - we believe first ever - reconstruction of a historic astronomic event ever done on radio as it almost certainly probably happened, we will also delve controversially into the often stormy on-board relationships of the space men themselves and also - even more controversially perhaps - glimpse into their often stormy domestic lives too, in particular what it meant and how it felt to be Mrs Armstrong and Mrs Aldrin.\n\nDid they support their space men husbands, or were they in fact deeply divided and bitter about it having to stay at home basically and do the laundry and dusting?\n\nThese fascinating and hitherto un-probed events - and many more - will be revealed in this pioneering, historic, spectacular, authentic, yet unashamedly controversial BBC radio drama."
