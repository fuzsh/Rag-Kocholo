        "text": "You could never be sure what Kaufmann truly meant, and what was just one of his eccentric jokes. When Kaufman quit his popular role as the foreign mechanic Latko in “Taxi”,he explained, “I want to create just my own things.” Throughout the film, we watch as Kaufman creates his “own” world out of mystifications and hackneyed jokes not only on the stage, but also in his real life.\n\nKaufman not only loses his audience, he also loses close friends and his girlfriend. During his downward spiral, Kaufman sings children’s songs to audiences looking for coarse jokes. At a college campus show he reads “The Great Gatsby”. He invites his talent agent to a nightclub to watch a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton who is revealed to be his alter- ego.\n\nKaufman would fake his own death or to set the theatre on fire just to make an audience laugh. Right when we think we “get” how his mind works, he baffles us with another shocking stunt or mystification. When Kaufman becomes ill, he goes to the Philippines seeking a miracle cure, but when he finds it he recognizes that he once pulled a similar scam (as performance art). With this knowledge Kaufman loses his last chance to be cured; he however accepts that for once the joke is on him.\n\nThis innovative biography follows Kaufman’s career from its very beginnings; from the nightclubs to the memorable success of his own show at Carnegie Hall. Despite the obscure and politically incorrect nature of his performance art, we watch Kaufman become a star right in front of our eyes. Milos Forman’s film is a tribute to Kaufman’s humour; it makes you laugh but at the same time gives you the creeps."
