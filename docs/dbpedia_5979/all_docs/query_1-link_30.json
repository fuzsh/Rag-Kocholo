The film now includes astronaut Gene Cernan's never-before-heard words to the members of the Artemis Generation, the next people to leave their bootprints on the moon.\n\nThe team behind the multi-award-winning documentary The Last Man on the Moon are delighted to announce a new edition, focused on Apollo 17, one of NASAâs most remarkable missions. This short film celebrates the 50th anniversary of the mission, its crew and those who supported humanityâs most recent journey to the Lunar surface.\n\nThe Last Man on the Moon - APOLLO 17 has extensive new material including commander Gene Cernanâs never-before-heard words to the next US astronauts to leave their footprints on the Moon, which we now know as the Artemis generation.
