        "text": "THE LAST MAN ON THE MOON portrays America's space program during the mid-1960s through 1972, when it was alive, vibrant, and significant. Eugene \"Gene\" Cernan is the remarkable man through whom this story is told. From childhood on his grandparents' farm in Wisconsin without electricity or a tractor, to his glory days as one of the first citizens of the U.S.A. and beyond as one of the world's most well-known spacemen, to 2015 as a reflective, still-vital man in his 80s looking back, Cernan seems a true American hero. Mark Craig and his team use archival NASA footage, photographs (both personal and government-issue), news coverage, as well as the testimony of men and women who were there when events were happening to highlight the man's life as well as the space-obsessed world in which he lived. The most newsworthy events of the era (for example, the tragedy of Apollo 1, Neil Armstrong on the moon) are included along with the affecting personal moments that altered the course of Cernan's journey. As a result, with the present-day Cernan always in focus, the film presents a complete picture of a man, his unique accomplishments, and a country at its scientific best.\n\nGene Cernan's warm, articulate, insightful presence works along with solid direction, editing, and a nicely coherent structure to make this an incisive film about the U.S. space program. The whole world was watching, rooting for its heroes, fascinated by possibility. As the movie progresses, one can't help but be nostalgic for an America at the top of its glory and scientific prowess. At the same time, the story told is faithful to both the risks undertaken and the side effects of the program's intensity for those who served. We see the tragic endings and the wives and kids left behind due to the program's level of commitment. From a perspective spanning decades, Mr. Cernan tells it like it was and like it is. Saddened by the knowledge that it may never happen again, Cernan walks through the rusty, abandoned space center in which he spent his most productive years and has to look away. The Last Man on the Moon is a terrific, must-see movie, especially as an engaging way to introduce kids to the wonders of science and scientific discovery."
