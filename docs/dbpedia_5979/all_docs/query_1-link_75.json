        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nBased on the character created by Doug Moench and Don Perlin, the Disney+ series unfolds the story of this obscure superhero, often considered as the Marvel Comics equivalent to Batman.\n\nMoon Knight was primarily filmed in Hungary, Slovenia, and Jordan. The studio work was done at Pinewood Studios in England and Origo Studios in Budapest, where the production team built large-scale sets.\n\nIn this six-part mini-series, Oscar Isaac (Dune, Star Wars) embraces the chaos becoming the Avatar for Khonshu, the Egyptian god of the Moon. His real-life neighbor, Ethan Hawke, appears as cult leader Arthur Harrow.\n\nGaspard Ulliel, who passed away in January 2022, plays one of the last roles of his life as Anton Mogart / Midnight Man.\n\nWelcome to our -almost- spoiler-free guide to all the filming locations of Moon Knight.\n\nThe Moon Knight city and house\n\nGift shop worker Steven Grant lives in the Brixton area of London.\n\nBut, as the local outlet Hungary Today revealed, the exterior of his flat is located on a small street in Downtown Budapest near Elizabeth Square.\n\nThe Atlantis store on the left is actually a bookstore called Atlantisz.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions ↴)\n\nImage courtesy of Disney Plus and Google Maps\n\nThe Moon Knight Museum\n\nIn the series, Steven works in what apparently looks like The British Museum in London, home to one of the largest collections of Ancient Egypt objects outside that country.\n\nHowever, the exterior was filmed at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest Heroes' Square.\n\nThe Hungarian museum also holds a great Ancient Egyptian art permanent exhibition, which opened in 1939.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney Plus - Map\n\nAccording to the production notes, the entire Egyptian exhibit interior hall was created from scratch on a studio set.\n\nA team of sculptors from Hungary and Italy built all the Egyptian statues and hand-built columns.\n\nThe living statue scene in the first episode, \"The Goldfish Problem\", was filmed in Madách Square, located under the ARCadia Hotel in central Budapest.\n\nSlashfilm noted that this character has a comic book origin, where Marc Spector recruited a homeless man named Bertrand Crawley. Crawley ended up gathering intel for Moon Knight on the streets of New York City.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney Plus and Google Maps\n\nMarc wakes up near a castle somewhere in the Swiss Alps. Although the scene contains a lot of CGI, the fortress is inspired by Eltz Castle near Koblenz in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of Germany.\n\nThis is not the first time that Eltz Castle appears in a Marvel Cinematic Universe production. HYDRA's Castle de Krake from the animated series What If...? was also modeled after this imposing citadel.\n\nBuilt in the 12th century, the spectacular Eltz Castle is a survivor of history, as it has never been destroyed.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney Plus and Mitko Denev - Map\n\nThe village was filmed in the picturesque town of Szentendre on the left bank of the Danube, a few miles away north of Budapest.\n\nSzentendre is a beautiful small city featuring narrow alleys, cobblestone streets, and pastel-colored buildings, that was also a featured location in the Netflix series Shadow and Bone.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney Plus - Map\n\nThe impressive twisty road in the car chase scene with the ice-cream van was filmed near the Bezgovica settlement in Osilnica, southern Slovenia.\n\nThis scenic serpentine road, named Bear’s Guts, is made up of about 20 hairpin turns. The road is famous for being home to the Red Bull No Paws Down, one of the toughest skateboard races in the world.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney - Map\n\nThe set designers dressed a restaurant to look like Soho. As MCU Location Scout pointed out, the red curved bar is the Tróger Gasztró Bisztró located near St. Stephen's Basilica in Budapest.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney - Map\n\nJovial Jay also reported that the Storage facility in the second episode, Summon the Suit, is an old building in the Lágymányos neighborhood of Budapest.\n\nHarrow's cult headquarters were filmed in an old factory in the south of Budapest called Csepel Művek. Apparently, the interior was recorded at the studios.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix - Storage facility / Harrow's cult\n\nThe rooftop chase ends at the Vajdahunyad Castle in Budapest, built in 1896 to celebrate the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathians and Transylvania in 895.\n\nThis replica of Corvin Castle in Romania was also featured in The Witcher series and the 2019 movie with Will Smith Gemini Man.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney - Map\n\nThe desert scenes in the third episode, \"The Friendly Type\", were filmed at Jordan's Wadi Rum Nature Preserve.\n\nConsidered one of the world’s most outstanding desert landscapes, this is a very popular location for filmmakers.\n\nYou've probably seen this dramatic scenery in many other productions including Lawrence of Arabia, Dune, Prometheus, The Martian, Rogue One, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Aladdin.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney - Map\n\nThe scenes taking place in Cairo were filmed on exterior sets in Budapest.\n\nEgyptian cinematographer and actor Karim El-Hakim, who plays Khonshu in the series, said that for him, the realism of the production \"brought Egypt to Budapest\".\n\nOne of the establishing shots shows a view of the Nile River with the 6 October Bridge and the Ramses Hilton. In another, the famous Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hassan and the Al-Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo's historic district are shown.\n\nImage courtesy of Disney - Map\n\nThe Burial Chamber set was built on a massive 47,074 square-foot soundstage at Origo Studios in Budapest.\n\nProduction designer Stefania Cella made extensive use of water reflections and mirrors to symbolically represent the series’ themes of duality and identity.\n\nImage courtesy of Marvel - Map\n\nAs Jovial Jay confirmed, the mansion of Anton Mogart (played by Gaspard Ulliel), was filmed at the Nádasdy Mansion, located near Lake Balaton in the south of Budapest.\n\nThe two Louvre-inspired glass pyramids were built in the garden of this neo-gothic style Hungarian estate built in the 19th century.\n\nImage courtesy of Marvel - Map\n\nThe Sienkiewicz Psychiatric Hospital from the post-credits scene of the series finale, \"Gods and Monsters\", was filmed outside the New Hall H in Hungexpo, the Budapest congress and exhibition center.\n\nThe London skyscraper 30 St Mary Axe (also known as the Gherkin) and the top of the East London Mosque were CGI'd into the scene.\n\nImage courtesy of Marvel - Map\n\nCan you help to improve this article about the filming locations of Moon Knight? To complete and correct this report, any feedback, info, or images that you may have are more than welcome, thank you!\n\nNOTICE: If you’re using this information on your website, please credit and link to this page as a source.\n\n*****\n\n5 comments:\n\n1- Ms. Morris - Mar 31, 2022, 10:58 AM\n\nThe castle looks like Burg Eltz on the Mosel River in Germany - coincidentally my profile pic here. However, I guess it's just CGI'd into the Alpen-type meadow scene, and I guess the closeup of the guys with guns must have been done on a set? Thanks for all the info and links here. I love learning about filming locations.\n\nReply\n\n2- Ra Moon - Mar 31, 2022, 16:07 AM\n\nThanks a lot, updated!\n\n3- Kayo - May 4, 2022, 7:46 AM\n\nWhere is the final shot from? The one with the Gherkin and what appears to be an east London mosque, when SKPTR leaves the hospital in a limo. It seems like this is an impossible shot.\n\nI found out the place they are leaving is Hungexpo fair center in Budapest, where we see the Gherkin and the East London mosque digitally added in the background. I don't know why I looked for that. Here is a link to a pic of Hungexpo where we see the wavy steelworks of the clinic.\n\nReply\n\n4- Ra Moon - May 4, 2022, 16:36 PM\n\nAwesome, you are totally right, thank you!\n\n5- Anonymous - Aug 24, 2022, 10:01 AM\n\nThe mountains that you can see in the \"car chase scene\" were CGI'd as well - the mountains are the Julian Alps (north-western part of Slovenia), and you can see the \"Martuljska skupina\" mountain group in the scene. The Julian Alps were also used in two additional episodes: episode 1 (the village where the character wakes up) and episode 4 (painting in the asylum) - both images are a remake of the view from village Dovje towards village Mojstrana (with Vrata, Kot and Krma valleys) - you can see the real photo here.\n\nRa Moon\n\nAtlas of Wonders is looking for wonderful Filming Locations all around the world.
