        "text": "When audiences saw Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flowers Moon, they may have experienced a brutal piece of American history for the first time. The three-and-a-half-hour drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro is based on a real series of murders in Oklahoma's Osage Nation during the 1920s. For nearly a century, the story was largely suppressed—until journalist David Grann published his book of the same in 2017, which led to a massive uncovering of the region's dark history. \"They suffered one of the most monstrous crimes in American history, yet many people, myself included, weren’t taught about it,\" Grann told The Telegraph in October. \"We’ve effectively exorcised it from our consciousness.\"\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is nominated for 11 Oscars at the upcoming 96th Academy Awards. Lily Gladstone is the current front-runner to win Best Actress. The film is also up for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and many more technical categories. Despite the film's brilliance, it hasn't taken home many trophies so far—especially with Oppenheimer standing in its way. Flower Moon was up for 12 Critics Choice Awards, but the film went home empty-handed. Meanwhile, Gladstone won the film's sole award at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, despite a total of 10 nominations between the two awards shows. Will the tragic historical tale play better with the Academy?\n\nIf you still haven't seen Flower Moon (which is streaming now), the horrible story begins roughly fifty years before the murders began, when the Osage were driven off their land in Kansas—and relocated to an Oklahoma reservation that was unfit for cultivation. To the Osage's surprise, they found that lands were rich with massive oil reserves. This brought enormous riches to the Osage, who maintained \"head rights\" over the area, meaning that the land could only be inherited, not purchased. Soon enough, the revelation led to a criminal conspiracy in Oklahoma's Osage Nation wherein white entrepreneurs would marry into the Osage, then murder their spouses—just to flee with their family's wealth. J. Edgar Hoover, the future director of the FBI, sent the Bureau of Investigation to uncover the conspiracy and expose the masterminds behind the killings\n\nFast-forward nearly 100 years, when Grann researched the historical event for his book. After digging through the Fort Worth archives, he found something even more sinister at play. Grann told The Telegraph that he found a ledger listing deaths that \"defied any natural death rates\" of the time. Grann concluded that this was evidence of a systematic murder of the Osage people. \"I don’t know of a single Osage family which didn’t lose at least one family member because of the head rights,\" Grann added.\n\nThe mastermind at the time was reportedly William Hale, a wealthy rancher who married his nephew, Ernest Burkhart, to an Osage woman named Mollie Burkhart. De Niro plays Hale in Killers of the Flower Moon, and DiCaprio stars as Ernest. DiCaprio was originally set to play investigator Tom White—who worked with Hoover to organize an undercover operation in Oklahoma—but Scorsese rewrote the entire film to have him take on Ernest. “Where’s the heart of the film?” DiCaprio asked Scorsese, with the director responding, \"Well, the heart is with her and Ernest.\"\n\nSo, the two traveled with Gladstone—who plays Mollie in the film—to visit the Osage and gain their approval. \"You deal with Native Americans and Indigenous people, you gotta make sure everything we do, everything we do, is as authentic,\" Scorsese told CBS Sunday Morning.DiCaprio added, \"We did our absolute best to listen to the Osage community.\"\n\nScorsese reportedly hired many Osage to work both in front of and behind the camera, and the crew maintained a healthy relationship with Osage Nation Chief Standing Bear. \"They really worked hard at this and earned our respect,\" Standing Bear said. \"If you're not comfortable with Martin Scorsese, you're not going to be comfortable with anybody!\" DiCaprio also learned to speak a bit of their language for the film, with Gladstone joking that he, \"did an incredible job of doing it the way a white man would say it!\""
