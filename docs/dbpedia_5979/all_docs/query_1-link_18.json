        "text": "Man on the Moon Directed by Miloš Forman Produced by Danny DeVito Written by Scott Alexander\n\nLarry Karaszewski Starring\n\nJim Carrey\n\nDanny DeVito\n\nCourtney Love\n\nPaul Giamatti\n\nMusic by R.E.M. Cinematography Anastas N. Michos Editing by Adam Boome\n\nLynzee Klingman\n\nChristopher Tellefsen Distributed by Universal Pictures Release December 22, 1999 Running time 119 minutes Country United States Language English Budget $82 million Gross revenue $47,434,430\n\nMan on the Moon is a 1999 American biographical comedy-drama film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, starring Jim Carrey. The film was directed by Miloš Forman and also features Danny DeVito, Courtney Love and Paul Giamatti. DeVito worked with Kaufman on the Taxi television series, and other members of that show's cast, including Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Conaway, make cameo appearances in the film, playing themselves. The film also features Patton Oswalt before he became famous.\n\nThe story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the comedy clubs, and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as Latka Gravas on the Taxi sitcom, which was popular for viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running \"feud\" with wrestler Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.\n\nAlthough the film received mixed reviews, Carrey received critical acclaim for his chameleonic performance and won a Golden Globe, his second win in a row after receiving an award for The Truman Show previously. He was nominated in the Musical/Comedy category for Man on the Moon, and remarked in his acceptance speech that he thought the film was a drama at heart, an opinion shared by others, but also a reference to how Kaufman saw himself as a \"song and dance man\".\n\nCast[]\n\nJim Carrey as Andy Kaufman/Tony Clifton\n\nDanny DeVito as George Shapiro\n\nCourtney Love as Lynne Margulies\n\nPaul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda/Tony Clifton\n\nGerry Becker as Stanley Kaufman\n\nLeslie Lyles as Janice Kaufman\n\nGeorge Shapiro as Mr. Besserman\n\nPamela Abdy as Diane Barnett\n\nCash Oshman as Yogi\n\nRichard Belzer as Himself\n\nMelanie Vesey as Carol Kaufman\n\nMichael Kelly as Michael Kaufman\n\nVincent Schiavelli as Maynard Smith\n\nPeter Bonerz as Ed.
