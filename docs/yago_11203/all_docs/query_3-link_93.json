News at the 2024 TIME100 Gala April 25. \"I see her on TV, but I actually see her in person. She looks so nice everyday.\"\n\nAs Kelly explained, the pair never used to catch each other looking so put together in the early hours, because they have a separate vibe at home with their children: Michael, 26, Lola, 22, and Joaquin, 21.\n\n\"At home, we're very different,\" the 53-year-old said. \"We're very relaxedâ€”it's a very casual environment. We always say that when we go to work, we see each other looking really gussied up.\" (For more with Kelly and Mark, tune into E! News tonight, April 25 at 11 p.m.)"
