        "text": "Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, won't rule out running for political office one day, he tells Lee Cowan in an interview to be aired on CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" March 15.\n\nGiffords' political career was cut short in 2011 when she was shot in the head by a gunman who killed six others.\n\nLately, there has been speculation that one or both of them could run for political office.\n\n\"You never say never,\" said Kelly, who has flown four space shuttle missions. \"It's not something I have planned. You know, right circumstances, I might consider it.\"\n\nWhen asked if she will ever run for office again, Giffords replied, \"Maybe.\"\n\nGiffords was just starting her third term in Congress in 2011 when, during a meeting with constituents at a Safeway supermarket parking lot in Tucson, a gunman opened fire. Six people were killed and 12 others were also injured. Giffords was left with a bullet in her brain.\n\nComplete CBSNews.com coverage: Tragedy in Tucson\n\nMan who tackled shooter in Gabrielle Giffords attack dies (03/12/15)\n\nAccused Tucson shooter mentally fit, pleads guilty (08/07/12)\n\nGiffords, a Democrat, resigned from Congress in January 2012. She is still recovering from her injuries, and tells Cowan she's getting \"a little bit better\" every day.\n\nThese days, Giffords and Kelly -- both avid gun owners -- are also working to get laws changed to keep guns away from the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers and others. They both were inspired to act after the December 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n\"We went and visited Newtown and visited a bunch of parents afterwards,\" Kelly tells Cowan. \"And I mean, you talk about tough -- when you meet them, you just feel like, it's kind of an obligation to try to do something about it.\"\n\nCowan also talks with Giffords and Kelly about their life today, about her recovery, and their future.\n\n\"Sunday Morning,\" hosted by Charles Osgood, is broadcast on Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET on CBS. Rand Morrison is the executive producer. For more information go to cbssundaymorning.com.\n\nThe show is also rebroadcast on the Smithsonian Channel Sundays at 2:00 p.m. ET, and on Mondays at 2:00 a.m. ET.\n\nBe sure to follow @CBSSunday on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube."
