        "text": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nIn August 2020, Kelly said that, \"We have consistently... been a step behind. And I think it's a crisis of leadership, and we've got to do better. At the same time, we've got to think of a path to get people back to work, but we've got to do it safely and responsibly.\" He has expressed frustration with the wearing of masks becoming a political, saying that, \"It shouldn't be... I think we need better leadership on this issue.\"\n\nVETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\nKelly believes that, \"There needs to be an increased culture of accountability at the VA: a focus on each individual Veteran, not the paperwork.\" He has also said that, \"Veterans services [should] work for our changing Veteran population. That includes aging and injured Veterans who need prompt, quality health care, and young Veterans who need mental health care.\"\n\nWOMENâ€™S HEALTH\n\nKelly is pro-choice and has affirmed his support for the ruling in Roe v. Wade. In his campaign, he stated that, \"Everyone in this country deserves a decent paid family leave policy.\" He has been endorsed by both NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund."
