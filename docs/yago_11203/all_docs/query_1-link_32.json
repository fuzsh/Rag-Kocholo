        "text": "Astronaut, author and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., appeared to be a top contender as Vice President Kamala Harris' Democratic running mate pick at least as of Monday morning — and if he were yet to be picked, could bring a dramatic life story to the ticket.\n\nHarris is aiming to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump and his vice-presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in the race to take the Oval Office.\n\nKelly enjoyed the triumph of rocketing into space four times as a NASA astronaut — and also suffered gut-wrenching tragedy when his wife, former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head in a 2011 assassination attempt.\n\nJD VANCE'S HOMETOWN OF MIDDLETOWN, OHIO WAS BUILT BY STEEL INDUSTRY: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IT\n\nHe shared details of his life as an author of two books written with Giffords (he's also the author of four astronaut-themed children's books).\n\n\"Whether it was from my time in the Navy and at NASA, serving in the United States Senate, or visiting our troops overseas: I've learned that when your country asks you to serve, you always answer the call,\" Kelly posted to X on Sunday, leading many to think she could be adding him to the ticket.\n\nThe choice of picks appeared to be narrowing down quickly on Monday.\n\nKelly was born in New Jersey in 1964.\n\nHe flew 39 missions as a U.S. Navy aviator during the Gulf War, and served aboard four space shuttle missions, two as commander of the spacecraft.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS IN HER OWN BOOK REVEALS 12 THINGS AMERICANS MUST KNOW ABOUT HER\n\nHe defeated Republican incumbent Martha McSally to win his Senate seat in 2020.\n\nKelly and Giffords married on Nov. 10, 2007. She was nearly murdered little more than three years later, on Jan. 6, 2011, while greeting constituents in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\"Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,\" released at the end of 2011, chronicled their journey together before and then after the tragedy, which ended Giffords’ political career.\n\nAMERICAN CULTURE QUIZ: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW STATE LINES, FELINES AND AMAZING US GRAPEVINES\n\n\"Gabby always loved playing with my wedding ring,\" Kelly writes. \"At almost every meal, she’d slip the ring off my finger and move it from her thumb to her forefinger to her middle finger. It was her little ritual, her way of fidgeting.\"\n\n\"Her eyes remained closed, tubes were everywhere …\"\n\nThat ritual proved the first sign of hope as she lay unconscious five days after she was nearly killed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Suddenly, as she held my hand … she actually pulled the ring off and began to move it around in her fingers, just like always … Her eyes remained closed, tubes were everywhere, but she was somehow able to direct the fingers of her one good hand to rediscover her old pastime.\"\n\nHe added, \"I was more than surprised. I was overwhelmed.\"\n\nJust four months after his wife was nearly murdered, Kelly was \"awaiting the last launch of the space shuttle Endeavour.\"\n\nKelly was the commander of the spacecraft, which proved to be the last mission into space for both the Endeavour and for Kelly.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nKelly and Giffords tackled the experience from a more politically entangled in \"Enough: Our Fight to Keep America Safe from Gun Violence,\" which they co-authored with Harry Jaffe in 2014.\n\nThe book is framed, of course, by the horrific shooting in Tucson, when a man unleashed a torrent of bullets from a handgun.\n\nGiffords survived. But six people were killed and 15 others were wounded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Gabby and I fear the country has veered off course when it comes to one important issue: how we relate to guns,\" the couple wrote in the book.\n\n\"A basic freedom that both Gabby and I wholeheartedly embrace, the right to bear arms, has become radicalized.\""
