        "text": "He is going.\n\nIn the continuing real-life drama that surpasses the most audacious soap opera narrative, the astronaut Mark E. Kelly announced Friday that he would honor his commitment to lead a two-week shuttle mission to the International Space Station — 200 miles up, and orbiting the earth at 17,500 miles an hour — while his wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, continues her gradual, uncertain recovery from the grievous head wound she suffered during last month’s deadly rampage by a gunman in Tucson.\n\nAppearing at a news conference in Houston, his face conveying the twinning of anxiety and resolve, Captain Kelly, of the Navy, laid out the thought process behind his choice: “Considering a bunch of other factors, including what Gabrielle would want me to do, and what her parents and her family and my family would like, I ultimately made the decision that I would like to return and command S.T.S. 134” — Space Transportation System 134, NASA’s official name for the mission.\n\nBut the commander, who in the past has said that his wife can understand him, repeatedly declined to say whether Ms. Giffords helped him to reach his decision, or whether she was even aware of the decision. Instead, more than once, he expressed confidence that he had her support. “I know my wife very well, and I know what she would want,” the commander said. “And that makes the decision easier.”\n\nThat decision marked the latest breathtaking turn in a marriage between two accomplished people that through the intrusion of tragedy has become part of the public domain. They have become the nation’s couple, this wounded congresswoman and this duty-bound astronaut, in ways that transcend their shared commitment to public service — so much so that many turned to the Internet to suggest what was best for this husband and wife.\n\nShould he stay by his wife’s side? Or should he lead the mission he had trained for well more than a year to lead? Is it bullheaded of him to go on such a risky business trip? Or is this what she wants him to do, expects him to do? And how does a two-week trip to space compare to a yearlong tour in Afghanistan by soldiers with complicated domestic situations of their own?\n\nThough a few criticized Captain Kelly’s decision — saying his duty was to be at his wife’s side, not in space — the consensus appeared to be that the astronaut had made the correct and courageous move.\n\nStill, some people questioned the choice. “The truly courageous and strong thing to do is to be an accessible partner to your disabled wife who is now relearning almost every function of her body and intellect,” one reader wrote to The New York Times Web site. “Just sayin’.”\n\nWhen asked about his “just sayin’ ” critics, Captain Kelly said that many people do not know what the Giffords and Kelly families know about Ms. Giffords’s condition, her support system and her admiration for the space mission. “I think if they had more details about those things, you’d probably have less people being critical,” said the astronaut, who wore a blue wristband decorated with a peace sign, a heart sign and the name “Gabby.”\n\nSince the shooting rampage on Jan. 8, which killed 6 people and wounded 13, including Ms. Giffords, the nation has followed the congresswoman’s wrenching journey from the blood-stained pavement in Tucson to a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, as well as that of her husband. The country has also come to know the story of their romance.\n\nMs. Giffords, 40, grew up in Tucson, amid cottonwood trees, while Mr. Kelly, 46, grew up in West Orange, N.J., within sight of the Manhattan cityscape. She rode horses; he fought and competed with his twin brother, Scott, who is also a NASA commander.\n\nThen came the shooting in Tucson, and an awful telephone call to Captain Kelly in Houston, and a brief period when he had to process news reports, quickly retracted, that his wife had died. All of this was less than a month ago.\n\nOn Friday, Captain Kelly recalled sitting at his wife’s bedside in Tucson, discussing her prognosis with her neurosurgeon and her trauma surgeon. “At the time, my thought was that I very likely would be sitting in that same seat maybe two, four, six months later — in that I.C.U., by her bedside,” he said. In other words, he would not be able to command the space-shuttle mission in April.\n\nBut the congresswoman’s condition quickly improved, against strong odds, warranting a transfer to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, where she could begin her rehabilitation. Her days are booked from 8 in the morning until after 6 at night, with a full schedule posted on her private room’s door: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, meals, much-needed rest.\n\nHer daily commitments played a vital role in his decision-making, the astronaut said. He began to weigh the amount of time he could spend with her against what was in the best interests of NASA and his crew.\n\nAfter an evaluation of the situation, NASA officials decided that Captain Kelly would go into space. He is scheduled to lead a six-member crew on a two-week trip to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Endeavour.\n\nIn what will be the second-to-last shuttle flight to the station before the 30-year-old program ends, the crew will be ferrying up a major scientific instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The $1.5 billion, 8-ton device will peer into the cosmos to detect dark matter, the invisible stuff that may act as cosmic glue.\n\nCaptain Kelly acknowledged that space flight is a “risky business” — but so, too, is being a member of Congress. He said he weighed these risks, along with his wife’s daily demands, the support she has, his responsibility to his crew and his country.\n\n“I feel very confident that I made the right decision,” he said.\n\nOthers agree, and have spoken up for Ms. Giffords. For example, Elaine Richardson, a longtime friend of Ms. Giffords who was a bridesmaid at her wedding to Mr. Kelly, said she was thrilled that he decided to go to space.\n\n“Knowing Gabby, she would want him to go up,” Ms. Richardson said. “It’s an important mission for the country and for him personally. And if he decided not to go, 10 years from now they would both realize it was an opportunity missed.”\n\nThis week, then, the astronaut trained for his upcoming journey, while the congresswoman continued on her own. Then, at night, she returned to her private hospital room, where the walls are festooned with get-well cards from children and enlarged photographs of Gabby and Mark, hiking in the Grand Canyon.\n\nFederal Case to Go First\n\nTUCSON — Jared L. Loughner will not face state murder charges in the Tucson shooting rampage until after the federal government finishes its trial against him, the authorities said Friday.\n\nMr. Loughner faces three federal charges of attempted murder in the wounding of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and two of her aides here on Jan. 8; additional federal charges are expected. He has pleaded not guilty."
