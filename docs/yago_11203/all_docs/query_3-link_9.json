        "text": "Mark Kelly (born February 21, 1964, Orange, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American astronaut and politician who served in the U.S. Senate (2020– ), representing Arizona. He is the identical twin brother of astronaut Scott Kelly.\n\nMark Kelly received a bachelor’s degree in marine engineering and transportation from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, in 1986. Scott and Mark became pilots in the U.S. Navy in 1987 and 1989, respectively. Mark flew 39 combat missions during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Both brothers graduated from the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1994. That year Mark also received a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Astronauts and Cosmonauts\n\nMark and Scott Kelly began their astronaut training in August 1996. Mark’s first spaceflight was as pilot of the space shuttle Endeavour on the STS-108 mission (December 5–17, 2001), which carried three astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Mark flew again to the ISS in July 2006 on the 13-day STS-121 mission as pilot of the space shuttle Discovery, which carried a German astronaut to the ISS, increasing its crew from two to three. Mark made two subsequent flights to the ISS as mission commander. On the STS-124 mission (May 31–June 14, 2008) of the space shuttle Discovery, commanded by Mark, the Japanese experiment module Kibo was joined to the ISS.\n\nScott was launched to the ISS on the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-01M on October 8, 2010 and was on board until March 16, 2011. Mark was originally scheduled to arrive at the ISS in February 2011 as commander of the space shuttle Endeavour’s last mission, STS-134, which was to attach the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, an experiment designed to study antimatter, dark matter, and cosmic rays, to the ISS, and the Kelly twins would then have become the first siblings in space at the same time. However, delays in launching an earlier mission pushed STS-134’s launch to May 16, 2011."
