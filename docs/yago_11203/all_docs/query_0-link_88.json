        "text": "ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y — Former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, will give the commencement address at Bard College’s 153rd commencement exercises on Saturday. Giffords also will receive an honorary doctorate of humane letters at the ceremony, scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m. in the Commencement Tent on the college’s Seth Goldfine Memorial Rugby Field. Giffords will receive the degree for her public service, Bard President Leon Botstein said in announcing the honor earlier this spring. “We’re honoring her for her public service and her courage — her extraordinary courage, literally, under fire,” Botstein said at the time. Giffords survived being shot in the head Jan. 8, 2011, during a “Congress on Your Corner” event in Tuscon, Ariz. The man who shot her, Jared Lee Loughner, was sentenced in November 2012 to life in prison for the shooting rampage that killed six people and wounded 13. Botstein will confer 470 undergraduate degrees and 175 graduate degrees at Saturday’s commencement, the college said."
