        "text": "US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has made a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill almost seven months after being shot in the head at a constituency event in Tuscon, Arizona.\n\nShe attended a House of Representatives session to vote on a bill to avoid a federal debt default.\n\nCritically injured on 8 January 2011 when a bullet entered the back of her skull and exited through the front during an attack that left six other people dead, Ms Giffords's recovery has been described as \"remarkable\" by doctors.\n\nBy May, she was able to travel to Florida to see her astronaut husband Mark Kelly launch the shuttle, Endeavour. She underwent surgery for a cranial implant just days later.\n\nAt her appearance in the House of Representatives on 1 August, Ms Giffords was able to move through the chamber with minimal assistance and thanked colleagues as they cheered her return to political life.\n\nMs Giffords was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, near the district she has represented for more than four years.\n\nThe 41-year-old is described as a trailblazer - the youngest woman elected to Arizona's state senate, the first Jewish representative from the state and its third woman to be elected to Congress.\n\nMs Giffords, a Democrat, is proud of her south-western roots, professing her love of trucks and motorcycles, having served as co-chair of the motorcycle caucus on Capitol Hill. She has said one of her dreams is to ride a motorbike to Argentina.\n\nOne of her first acts in Congress was to push for a national day in recognition of cowboys. She is also a gun owner.\n\nA former Fulbright scholar who studied in Mexico, she has a masters degree in urban planning from Cornell University.\n\nConsidered a rising star in the Democratic Party, the New York Times predicted that Ms Giffords would one day run for Arizona's governorship.\n\nRobert Reich, who served as President Bill Clinton's labour secretary in the 1990s, once told the Arizona Republic newspaper that she could run for the highest office in the land.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if she's the first or second female president of the United States. She's of that calibre,\" he said.\n\nMs Giffords was elected to the Arizona legislature in 2000, when she was just 30.\n\nAfter two years in the state House of Representatives, Ms Giffords successfully ran for the state Senate where she served for six years. She resigned in order to run for national office.\n\nShe is well known in her district for holding hundreds of meetings there each year.\n\nShe met her husband - Nasa astronaut Mark Kelly, who has piloted the space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery - on a fellowship programme for young US and Chinese leaders in 2003.\n\nThe couple married in 2007, and her wedding ring is inscribed: \"You're the closest to heaven that I've ever been.\" He flew from his Houston base to be at her hospital bedside after the shooting.\n\nCapt Kelly has a twin brother who has also been an astronaut onboard the International Space Station. He has two children from a previous marriage."
