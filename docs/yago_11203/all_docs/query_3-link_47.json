        "text": "It was quite a reunion this morning on Live with Kelly and Mark. Married co-hosts Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos had a surprise meeting with their All My Children‘s Baby Enzo.\n\nOlivia Daddona (Baby Enzo), was in the audience for Monday’s episode of Live. Ripa told the audience she and Consuelos had “often wondered, what ever happened to Baby Enzo, and where is Baby Enzo, and Baby Enzo is in our audience today.” Ripa’s character Hayley Vaughan Santos and her All My Children husband, Consuelos’ Mateo, had a baby boy in an August 2001 episode, whom they named Lorenzo (aka Enzo).\n\nDaddona explained to Ripa and Consuelos that she had been chosen over her twin brother to play Enzo, because “at the time, he didn’t have enough hair.” She also shared that she is about three days younger than Ripa and Consuelos’ real-life daughter Lola, recalling that her mother would hold Lola off-camera while Ripa was holding her.\n\nRipa asked Daddona if she was still acting, but she said, “No, this is my big break now, I guess!”\n\nYou can watch a video of the exchange between Daddona, Ripa and Consuelos above."
