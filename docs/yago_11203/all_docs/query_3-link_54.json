        "text": "Not surprisingly, Kelly Ripa is hot for Mark Consuelos' summer look.\n\nRight on time as the mercury rises, the 53-year-old was sporting a warm-weather-ready buzz cut on the couple's recent dreamy-looking vacation in Switzerland. And though Ripa snapped many pics during their getaway capturing his hair from different angles, she was happy to support the style's TV debut when they returned to work July 1.\n\n\"Do not adjust your TV screens,\" Consuelos advised at the top of Monday's episode of LIVE With Kelly and Mark. \"Yes, I got my hair cut.\"\n\n\"May I touch?\" his wife of 28 years inquired as she ran her hand over his not-at-all bristly head, both of them beaming.\n\n\"It's like a chinchilla,\" he offered, invoking the softest of squirrel-like rodents.\n\nConsuelos agreed that he'd pick someone out. \"The upper deck never gets any love,\" he noted, pointing upward, \"so maybe...\" Ripa was, of course, onboard.\n\nScanning the higher tier of seats, he quipped, \"That gentleman up there wants to rub my head.\"\n\nAs Ripa continued doing a full pat-down of her husband's close-cropped 'do, she added, \"Look at how I take it all for granted, don't I? I just take it all for granted.\"\n\nConsuelos noted that he's no stranger to the buzz cut, that he does it every few years, but this time he actually broke out the clippers for a TV pilot he shot after being asked to go \"military\"-short for the role.\n\nNot that he's playing someone in the military, he quickly added.\n\nTrying and failing to get more about the part out of him, Ripa told Consuelos, \"This is, I think, why we've been married for so long: You're so cagey about the details that, I am not unconvinced that you are also, like your parents, in the CIA.\""
