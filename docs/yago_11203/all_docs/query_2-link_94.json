        "text": "(VIENNA, VA, March 8, 2016)-1105 Media, Inc. is excited to announce that Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Giffords, former Arizona Congresswoman, and Mark Kelly, retired astronaut and U.S. Navy Captain, will deliver a keynote address at the ACQUIRE Conference & Expo on June 9, 2016 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC.\n\nDistinguished public servants and models of dedication and resilience, Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly represent the very essence of American heroism. Kelly flew 39 combat missions over Iraq and Kuwait during the first Gulf War, spent over 50 days in orbit and served as the commander of Space Shuttle Endeavour on its final flight. The youngest woman ever elected to the Arizona State Senate, Giffords represented her community in the Arizona Legislature from 2000-2005, and then in Congress from 2006-2012, consistently ranking as one of the most centrist legislators in Congress.\n\nOn January 8, 2011, an assassination attempt at an event with constituents in Tucson, Arizona, left Giffords severely wounded, shot in the head from near point blank range. Since then, the couple has inspired individuals around the world with their story of hope and courage in the wake of tragedy, serving as a symbol for the possibility of second chances.\n\n\"There is no more fitting way to kick off this inaugural event than by hearing from Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords, a couple who has inspired millions,\" said Anne A. Armstrong, Chief Content Officer at 1105 Media. \"Kelly and Giffords show by example what determination, a commitment to public service and a belief in mission can accomplish.\"\n\nProduced by the media teams behind the FCW, GCN, Washington Technology, Defense Systems and Federal Soup brands, ACQUIRE is a new two-day conference & EXPO for government, military and contractor professionals looking to deliver on agency missions.
