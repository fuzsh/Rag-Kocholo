An injury prompted her to retire and move to Texas to be near her grandchildren, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n\nPatricia Kelly also was a prison guard and an Essex Park County (New Jersey) police officer.\n\nShe died in April 2012 of lung cancer.\n\n\"She is the only woman in the world who raised twin astronauts. She raised two sons, not just brothers but twins, who flew up into the heavens,” said her husband, Richard Kelly.\n\nMark Kelly's father, Richard, was police chief at Flagler Beach Police Department in Florida\n\nAfter leaving the Army, where he was a paratrooper, Richard Kelly began a career in law enforcement and rose to the rank of captain with the West Orange Police Department, according to his obituary.\n\nPrior to retiring in 1987, he was the police chief in Flagler Beach, Florida.\n\nRichard Kelly died in October 2016 in Texas from complications from a lifetime of tobacco use.\n\nMark Kelly the astronaut, along with identical twin Scott Kelly, the astronaut\n\nIn 1996, Mark Kelly was selected as an astronaut in the same NASA class as his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly. Mark Kelly’s first of four trips into space was as pilot of STS-108 in December 2001, during which he helped deliver equipment, supplies and additional crew members to the International Space Station.\n\nHe flew a second mission in 2006 and a third in 2008.\n\nHis final mission came in 2011, months after Giffords was shot. He and NASA decided to keep him as commander of the team. Three weeks after returning to Earth after commanding Shuttle Endeavour on its final flight, Kelly announced he would retire from NASA later that year, citing his wife’s medical needs.\n\nThe shuttle program ended Aug. 31, 2011.\n\nMark Kelly spent more than 50 days in space — traveling more than 20 million miles.\n\nMark Kelly inducted into Astronaut Hall of Fame\n\nMark Kelly was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2023. He was the second sitting senator to be inducted after John Glenn in 1990.\n\n\"It is really such an honor to be inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame,\" Mark Kelly said at the time.\n\n\"I'm grateful to be born in a country as the son of two police officers to watch the Apollo missions from their living room floor to go on to reach the heights of the world's greatest space program.\"\n\nIdentical twin brother Scott Kelly was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2020. The brothers became the first pair of siblings and the only set of identical twins to hold places in the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"As special as it was to be an astronaut, nothing compares to doing it with your clone,\" Mark Kelly said.\n\n\"The list of human beings who have made a greater contribution to space exploration than my brother Scott is very, very short. It means even more to be joining these ranks with you.\"\n\nMark Kelly, twin brother Scott Kelly, conducted special experiment\n\nIn 2015, identical twin brothers Mark and Scott Kelly participated in the first experiment to assess the longterm effects of space radiation and microgravity on the human body and mind. Scott Kelly was in space, while Mark Kelly was at his Arizona home.\n\nIn addition to taking cognitive tests, the Kelly twins regularly provide samples of blood, saliva and other bodily fluids. And they undergo MRIs and ultrasound tests so researchers can study what protracted time in space does to bone density, cell tissue and other DNA markers.\n\nScientists will use the data to determine how to prepare astronauts for a round trip to Mars that could take as long as three years.\n\nPros, cons of Mark Kelly as vice presidential pick for Kamala Harris\n\nUSA TODAY offered these pros and cons of Mark Kelly as a vice presidential pick.\n\nPros:\n\nKelly won statewide elections for the U.S. Senate seat in Arizona in 2020 in a special election to finish the term of the late Sen. John McCain and for a full term in 2022. He could give Democrats a boost in the crucial battleground state as VP nominee.\n\nHe has a background in military service as a naval aviator and as a former astronaut, giving him a platform to attack former President Donald Trump on claims that Trump has mocked veterans.\n\nKelly is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head during a 2011 mass casualty event at a Tucson grocery store. Their story could prove powerful as gun violence takes center stage in the 2024 election.\n\nOpinion: Kamala Harris doesn't scare Republicans, but Mark Kelly absolutely should\n\nCons:\n\nKelly is relatively unvetted on the national stage and is not well known beyond his state.\n\nHe has served in the U.S. Senate only since 2020 and is among the least-experienced politicians being considered for the VP nomination.\n\nSwing state Arizona would hold a special election to fill his Senate seat if Kelly is picked and Democrats win the White House in November.\n\nContributors: Jamie Groh, FLORIDA TODAY; Ledyard King, Karissa Waddick, Ramon Padilla, USA TODAY"
