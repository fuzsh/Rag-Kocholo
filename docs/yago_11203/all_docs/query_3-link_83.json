        "text": "Married couple Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos faced more social media criticism during their second day hosting “Live” together.\n\n“Gosh I don’t know with them together,” tweeted one viewer. “I am not a fan. Loved Ryan and all his stories, he brought another layer to the show.\n\n“Kelly and Mark look uncomfortable together, it’s hard to watch. Mark as a fill in cohost was fun to watch. This isn’t fun to watch anymore. Need Ryan back.”\n\n“Painful! When does Mark get to finish his own sentences??” noted one less-than-impressed fan. “Annoying, changed the channel. Bye-bye Live!\n\nAnother added, “So I’m sorry but this won’t work. It’s like a morning reality show with a washed up couple. I’m sure the higher up see it. I’m sure there nice people but ya no go.”\n\nThe pair do have their supporters with one fan admonishing the critics.\n\n“Give him time…he’s nervous.”\n\nThe duo received decidedly mixed reviews for their debut show on ABC as permanent co-hosts with Ripa, 52, being accused of talking over and interrupting her husband, also 52.\n\n“I am so happy to see Mark & Kelly this morning….But Kelly could PLEASE LET HIM TALK….!!! OMG…! Let him start and finish a story his way…It’s the only way it’s going work,” another person wrote.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nBut it wasn’t all a barrage of negativity.\n\n“Loving Live with Kelly and Mark, theyre so good together. #KellyAndMark,” gushed one fan.\n\nThe “Riverdale” alum defended the first episode.\n\n“This show today truly felt like home,” the actor told Us Weekly Monday. “I always feel at home with Kelly, but [working] together this morning just felt so right.”\n\nHe added that the couple has “always” felt at “ease” when they are together, and he feels “lucky we get to do that daily” as co-hosts.\n\n“I can’t wait to see where we can go from here,” he added.\n\nRipa, also heaped praise on her husband’s debut, telling the magazine that she thought he did an “amazing” job and “better than (she) ever thought possible. “He’s a natural, and I have a good feeling this is going to be great for a while.”\n\nConsuelos took over from Ryan Seacrest, 48, on the morning talk show after the “American Idol” host announced in February that he would be stepping down after nearly six years and moving back to Los Angeles.\n\nPage Six exclusively reported that ABC had been wooing Consuelos to join the show since last summer when Seacrest began talking about leaving.\n\nRipa and Consuelos tied the knot in May 1996 and share three children: Michael, 25, Lola, 21, and Joaquin, 20."
