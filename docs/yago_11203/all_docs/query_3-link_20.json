        "text": "Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, is rumored to be under consideration to serve as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKelly, a 60-year-old former astronaut and U.S. Navy captain, has represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate since 2020.\n\nKelly was elected to the Senate in a 2020 special election that was held following the death of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain in 2018, defeating incumbent GOP Sen. Martha McSally.\n\nA native of Orange, New Jersey, Kelly graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1986. He later attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, receiving a Master of Science in aeronautical engineering in 1994.\n\nARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE SAYS MARK KELLY WOULD GIVE HARRIS 'JOLT' AS VP\n\nKelly became a naval aviator in 1987 and was assigned to Attack Squadron 115 in Japan. He made two deployments and flew nearly 40 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm.\n\nHe received an array of commendations for his service in the military and retired from the Navy in October 2011. At the time, he wrote in a post on social media, \"From the day I entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment I landed the Space Shuttle Endeavour three weeks ago, it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the United States of America.\"\n\nAlong with his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly, he was selected by NASA to serve as a space shuttle pilot in 1996.\n\nKelly, who took numerous trips beyond Earth’s atmosphere during his illustrious career as an astronaut, has reportedly logged more than 54 days in space.\n\nKelly, an independent turned Democrat in 2018, is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who he married in 2007.\n\nFollowing the attempted assassination attempt of Giffords in 2012, Kelly shied away from public life to assist with his wife’s recovery efforts.\n\nHe is also the author of multiple books, including one he co-authored with Giffords in 2012 titled, \"Enough: Our Fight to Keep America Safe from Gun Violence.\"\n\nHARRIS EDGES CLOSER TO TRUMP IN NEW POLL CONDUCTED AFTER BIDEN'S WITHDRAWAL\n\nIn January 2013, Kelly and Giffords launched a political action committee named Americans for Responsible Solutions. The organization’s mission promoted what it believed to be solutions to gun violence with elected lawmakers and members of the public.\n\nHe won re-election to the Senate in November 2022, when he defeated Republican nominee Blake Masters.\n\nKelly is not the first astronaut to be elected to Congress. Others include John Glenn, Harrison Schmitt and Jack Swigert.\n\nHe is viewed by many political strategists, primarily Democrats, as a safe move for Harris as she considers who will appear alongside her on the November ballot.\n\nThree days after President Biden announced his decision to step aside in the 2024 race for the White House, Kelly fielded questions from reporters in the hallways of the U.S. Capitol, where he was asked whether he would accept the vice presidential nomination.\n\n\"This is not about me. This is about the future of this country,\" Kelly said at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This is a choice between Kamala Harris, who’s an experienced prosecutor, vice president, U.S. senator, [California] attorney general, and a guy who’s a convicted felon,\" Kelly added.\n\nKelly also predicted, following Biden’s drop out, that Harris \"is going to win\" the state of Arizona in the 2024 election."
