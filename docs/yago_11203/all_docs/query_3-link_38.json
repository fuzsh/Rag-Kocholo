        "text": "Mark Kelly and Scott Kelly, in full Mark Edward Kelly and Scott Joseph Kelly, (born February 21, 1964, Orange, New Jersey, U.S.), American astronauts and identical twins.\n\nMark Kelly received a bachelor’s degree in marine engineering and transportation from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, in 1986. Scott Kelly received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York Maritime College at Throggs Neck, New York, the following year. Scott and Mark became pilots in the U.S. Navy in 1987 and 1989, respectively. Mark flew 39 combat missions during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Both brothers graduated from the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1994. That year Mark also received a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Scott received a master’s degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1996.\n\nMark and Scott Kelly began their astronaut training in August 1996. Scott first flew into space as the pilot of the space shuttle Discovery on the STS-103 mission (December 19–27, 1999), which replaced the gyroscopes and computer on the Hubble Space Telescope. Mark’s first spaceflight was as pilot of the space shuttle Endeavour on the STS-108 mission (December 5–17, 2001), which carried three astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Mark flew again to the ISS in July 2006 on the 13-day STS-121 mission as pilot of the space shuttle Discovery, which carried a German astronaut to the ISS, increasing its crew from two to three. Mark and Scott made subsequent flights to the ISS as mission commanders. On the STS-118 mission (August 8–21, 2007) of the space shuttle Endeavour, commanded by Scott, a truss was added to the ISS. On the STS-124 mission (May 31–June 14, 2008) of the space shuttle Discovery, commanded by Mark, the Japanese experiment module Kibo was joined to the ISS.\n\nScott was launched to the ISS on the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-01M on October 8, 2010. He served as a flight engineer on Expedition 25 and became the commander of Expedition 26, which lasted from November 26, 2010, to March 16, 2011. Mark was originally scheduled to arrive at the ISS in February 2011 as commander of the space shuttle Endeavour’s last mission, STS-134, which was to attach the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, an experiment designed to study antimatter, dark matter, and cosmic rays, to the ISS, and the Kelly twins would then have become the first siblings in space at the same time. However, delays in launching an earlier mission pushed STS-134’s launch to May 16, 2011.\n\nMark’s wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, was seriously wounded during an assassination attempt on January 8, 2011. At Mark’s request the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) appointed a backup commander, Rick Sturckow, in the event that Mark would be unable to complete preparing for the mission. However, Giffords recovered from her injuries much more quickly than expected, and she was able to watch Mark launch into space. STS-134 returned to Earth on June 1, and in October Mark left NASA and the U.S. Navy to help Giffords with her recovery. One month later Giffords and Mark published Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope (cowritten with Jeffrey Zaslow). In 2013, in response to the Newtown shootings of 2012, they founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, an organization and political action committee dedicated to reducing gun violence in the United States. In 2019 Mark announced that he was running for a U.S. Senate seat from Arizona\n\nOn March 27, 2015, Scott returned to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-16M as part of a special mission in which he and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko spent 340 days in space, which was the longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. Scott broke the American record for most cumulative time in space, having spent 520 days in orbit on his four flights. A special part of the mission was the twins study, in which Scott was compared with the earthbound Mark to understand the medical effects of long spaceflight, such as astronauts would experience on a yearlong flight to Mars. Scott and Korniyenko returned to Earth on March 2, 2016. The following year Scott published the memoir Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery.\n\nWritten by Erik Gregersen, Senior Editor, Astronomy and Space Exploration, Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nTop Image Credit: Robert Markowitz/NASA"
