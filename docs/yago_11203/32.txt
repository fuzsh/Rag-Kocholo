Astronaut and Navy captain Mark Kelly, the husband of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, spoke to “NBC Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams about his wife’s recovery.

Kelly gave his first TV interview back in January to “ABC World News” anchor Diane Sawyer. With his wife in rehab and making amazing progress, and his next (and last) shuttle mission looming just a few months away, he is giving an update on the situation.

Part one of the interview ran on “Today” this morning, with additional segments slated for this evening’s “Nightly News.”
