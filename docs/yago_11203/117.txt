Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the former chair and ranking Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, and wife of astronaut Mark Kelly, has been shot. CBS/Spaceflight Now reports:

Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, 40, an Arizona Democrat married to veteran astronaut Mark Kelly, was shot in the head during a public meeting outside a Tucson supermarket Saturday. A dozen bystanders also were shot -- and some reportedly killed, including a 9-year-old child -- when a lone gunman allegedly opened fire.

Scheduled to command the shuttle Endeavour in April, Kelly immediately flew to Tucson from Houston, officials said. His twin brother Scott, in orbit commanding the International Space Station, was informed of the shooting by flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center.

"She's in critical condition," said Peter Rhee, a surgeon at the University of Arizona trauma center where 10 gunshot victims were taken. "The neurosurgeons have finished operating on her and I can tell you ... I'm very optimistic about recovery."

He said he was optimistic "because she was following commands. She was shot one time, in the head, through and through. I can't tell you right now, obviously, for forensic purposes what direction (the bullet went). But she was shot through and through on one side of the head. It went through her brain."

Asked if he was optimistic about a full recovery, Rhee said "we cannot tell what kind of recovery, but I'm about as optimistic as it can get in this situation."

...the shooting occurred in front of a Safeway supermarket in Tucson where Giffords was hosting an event called "Congress on Your Corner" intended to let members of the 8th Congressional District to meet their congresswoman.

According to The New York Times, a former emergency room doctor who witnessed the shooting said the gunman approached Giffords from behind, "held a gun about a foot from her head and began firing."

"He must have got off 20 rounds," the witness told the Times. The gunman was tackled by bystanders and later was identified as Jared Laughner. Police said he used a pistol with an extended magazine.

Some initial media reports said Giffords was killed, but other officials later said she was alive, in surgery and in critical condition. By 4 p.m., officials were saying she was expected to survive, which Rhee later confirmed.

Updates: President Obama released a statement and later delivered remarks from The White House:

This morning, in an unspeakable tragedy, a number of Americans were shot in Tuscon, Arizona, at a constituent meeting with Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. And while we are continuing to receive information, we know that some have passed away, and that Representative Giffords is gravely wounded.

We do not yet have all the answers. What we do know is that such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society. I ask all Americans to join me and Michelle in keeping Representative Giffords, the victims of this tragedy, and their families in our prayers.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden issued the following statement:

We at NASA are deeply shocked and saddened by the senseless shooting of Representative Giffords and others at Saturdayâs public event in Tucson. As a long-time supporter of NASA, Representative Giffords not only has made lasting contributions to our country, but is a strong advocate for the nationâs space program and a member of the NASA family.

She also is a personal friend with whom I have had the great honor of working.

We at NASA mourn this tragedy and our thoughts and prayers go out to Congresswoman Giffords, her husband Mark Kelly, their family, and the families and friends of all who perished or were injured in this terrible tragedy.

Scott Kelly shared the following, posted on his Facebook page from onboard the International Space Station:

I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, words of condolences and encouragement for the victims and their families of this horrific event. My sister-in-law, Gabrielle Giffords is a kind, compassionate, brilliant woman, loved by friends and political adversaries alike- a true patriot. What is going on in our country that such a good person can be the subject of such senseless violence? It's a sad day

Monday, Jan. 10, 2011: Statement from U.S. Navy Captain Mark Kelly...

On behalf of Gabby and our entire family, I want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the people of Arizona and this great nation for their unbelievable outpouring of support. Gabby was doing what she loved most â hearing from her constituents â when this tragedy occurred. Serving Southern Arizonans is her passion, and nothing makes her more proud than representing them in Congress.

Like all Americans, we mourn the loss of Gabe Zimmerman, a fine man and beloved member of Gabbyâs team, Judge John M. Roll, Christina Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, and Dorwan Stoddard. We must never forget them, and our prayers are with their families. Our hearts go out to everyone injured yesterday; we hope and pray for their quick recovery. We also extend our thanks and appreciation to all of the first responders, medical personnel, law enforcement, and Arizona citizens who acted swiftly yesterday and continue to assist our community through this tragedy. Many stories of heroism are emerging, and they are a source of strength for us during this difficult time. We are forever grateful.

Many of you have offered help. There is little that we can do but pray for those who are struggling. If you are inspired to make a positive gesture, consider two organizations that Gabby has long valued and supported: Tucsonâs Community Food Bank and the American Red Cross.

Space station commander Scott Kelly spoke from orbit on Monday, Jan. 10, 2011, about the Tucson shooting before leading his crew in a moment of silence.

I would like to take some time this morning to recognize a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the Tucson shooting tragedy. First though, I would like to say a few words.

We have a unique vantage point here aboard the International Space Station. As I look out the window, I see a very beautiful planet that seems very inviting and peaceful. Unfortunately, it is not.

These days we are constantly reminded of the unspeakable acts of violence and damage we can inflict upon one another, not just with our actions, but also with our irresponsible words.

We are better than this. We must do better.

The crew of ISS Expedition 26 and the flight control centers around the world would like to observe a moment of silence in honor of all the victims, which include my sister-in-law Gabrielle Giffords, a caring and dedicated public servant. Please join me and the rest of the ISS Expedition 26 crew in a moment of silence.

Kim, our thoughts are with all of you there in the Tucson community on this tragic day for your city.

News reports are that Mark Kelly has arrived in Tuscon by NASA jet to be with his wife. President Obama just described him as "valiant."

posted 01-09-2011 01:36 AM Well, every minute Rep. Giffords stays alive gives her a better chance at recovery. That being said, now is the time to pray if you feel the need.

I've read some of her bios online and she is quite an interesting person (not somebody you would expect at first glance) and I can see why Mark married her as she seems to be as fun loving as he is. Yet she is also a hard worker at her job like he is.

As for Scott, he will get all the help he can if he needs it. I had a chance to talk with Dan Tani about his on orbit experiences when his mom Rose died in a car accident as part of my book research. NASA astronauts on orbit have their own private lines of communication as needed to discuss any problems with medical professionals and other astronauts. Clay Anderson did some private conferences with Dan after Rose died as at about that same time, Clay's mom lost her battle with cancer (I knew her myself, a great woman). I think the conferences helped out with both of them.

The person that will need the most support at this time though is Mark Kelly. To have a loved one in the hospital after such an incident can do nasty things to one's character. With Mark and Scott both being Navy pilots, I am sure they have had their share of friends lose their lives or get injured in those risky professions. But a loved one is different. So say a few prayers for Mark as well in this time of need.

posted 01-09-2011 11:15 AM Of the 11 wounded brought to the University of Arizona trauma center, one has died (Christina Greene, 9, as already reported), six (including Greene) have undergone surgery and only one -- Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- remains on Sunday in critical condition.

According to her doctors, the bullet that injured Giffords passed laterally through the left hemisphere of her brain. She is in a medically induced coma, but when brought out for tests, she has responded to simple commands (e.g. squeeze a hand, raise a finger). She is on a respirator, so cannot yet try to speak and her eyes are covered.

posted 01-10-2011 01:33 PM Thanks Kim, although for the record a minor correction...

I did go to the same high school as Mark and Scott, but we were a number of years separated (I was in the elementary school across the street when they were high school seniors).

The tragic events of the recent days have certainly kept my thoughts focused on Gabrielle's recovery, and my hope is for Mark and Scott, and their families, to find strength through this challenging time.

I know many among the collectSPACE community share those sentiments.

posted 01-10-2011 03:10 PM As time goes on and Gabrielle continues to recover (the first 72 hours is always the most critical due to brain swelling issues), things will get better. Granted nobody should ever have to go through this, but Mark and Scott are positive upbeat individuals and so is Gabrielle. As such, if she lives through this and gets out of the hospital, she couldn't be among a better group of people to help her out during recovery. albatron
