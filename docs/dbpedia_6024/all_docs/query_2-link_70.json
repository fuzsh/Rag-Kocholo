        "text": "The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\n\nBy Thierry 'Scooter' Nguyen |\n\nGermans show us how to turn a hovel into an empire.\n\nSpiffy:\n\nLooks really nice; maintains traditional Settlers formula.\n\nIffy:\n\nPossibly frustrating to not have direct unit control\n\nThe Settlers has always been a good example of the stereotypical German mindset of focusing on economy and efficiency. Even though Settlers: Rise of the Empire is the sixth title in the franchise, and looks a lot spiffier compared to previous, 2D Settlers titles, it hasn't abandoned its city-building roots. Producer Ronald Kaulbach summarizes the Settlers experience: \"This is a builder game, not an RTS; this is about creation, not destruction. Your ultimate goal is to create a big, bustling city in medieval times.\"\n\nBuild, Not Conquer\n\nKaulbach pointed out that in most other city-builder games, your actual city tends to look more like a random collection of buildings and residents plopped down onto the landscape. In contrast, a fleshed-out, well-executed city in Settlers will look like a true medieval city viewed from up high. It will have defined landmarks and districts and even a circular layout, with a giant wall protecting it. (Kaulbach summarizes the role of the wall as \"outside the wall is where you gather resources while inside is where you process them into city life\"). A good player will have the city grow organically, from a tiny town with just a castle, some food storage, a church, and a couple of houses, to a grand metropolis where even though it fills up your whole screen, you can still find the first church and castle that you placed down all those in-game years before.\n\nAs per previous titles, you don't have direct control of your settlers; how they interact is a combination of selecting targets (such as animals to be hunted or structures to be built) and settlers themselves following natural instincts and cues. Put down a woodcutter shop in town, then click on a forest, and people will naturally start chopping down trees and taking them to the woodcutter to create lumber. Then, when you want to build a new structure, you put down the basic plan, and settlers will automatically figure out to snag excess lumber from the woodcutter and use it to make a new house (or church or grain storage or what-have-you).\n\nTo keep all of these workers fed, some settlers will naturally take it upon themselves to go hunting and to then drop their kills off at either the storage or the butcher, depending on which action makes more sense. Again, it's driven by what buildings you put down, and what your settlers need to do to accomplish the goals you suggest.\n\nAs your city develops, so do the needs of your settlers. Sure, at first, just food and shelter will be enough to content them. But when you get a bustling medieval city up and running, your settlers will want more, such as soap for hygiene and even entertainment. We saw some disgruntled settlers just up and leave their jobs and go on strike; the Ubisoft demonstrator was able to sate the strikers by having his hero come out and sing a rousing ballad, which motivated the strikers to go back to work.\n\nNext: Page 2 >>\n\nPage: 1 2"
