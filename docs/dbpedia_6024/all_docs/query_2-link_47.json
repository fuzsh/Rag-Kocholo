        "meta_description": "Rise of the Empire is a meta-expansion that adds a completely new layer to Imperial Settlers by introducing an open-world campaign setting. From game to game, players' empires will advance, reaching new eras, goals, technologies, discoveries, and provinces. (You don't need to play the campaign in a set group of co-players as each empire can develop at its own pace and represent different stages of advancement.)\n\nThis meta-expansion includes 220 new cards divided into three types: Provinces, Goals &amp; Achievements, and Technologies &amp; Discoveries. In addition Imperial Settlers: Rise of the Empire shortens gameplay from five to four rounds.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher",
