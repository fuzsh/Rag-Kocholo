        "text": "As someone who played the board game before the video game (and who is now hooked on the video game also) this adaption of STS is a must have!!! Not only is it accessible to newer players, it feels just as exciting and terrifying as some of the close calls had when playing the video game. I am also a huge fan of the unlock system for cards not readily accessible upon your first few playthroughs of Acts 1-3 (if playing with 4 people and characters it takes 2 full games from Act 1-3 to unlock the rest of the character cards, colourless cards, and access to Ascensions) and the experience of unlocking these cards is incredibly rewarding! A great solo, duo and group game with so many deck archetypes and paths to take and a seemingly endless amount of playtime to be had. I cannot recommend it enough!!\n\nFirst of all, there are no new cards in this set. The cards that are here are replacement cards for many of the cards found in Wingspan and its various expansions. They feature art (the birds) by fans of the games. If you have all the sets you can just substitute these cards for the standard ones. If you don't have all of the expansions, then some of the cads will, in fact, be new to you."
