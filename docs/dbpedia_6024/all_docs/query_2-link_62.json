        "text": "The world of The Settlers is lush, dynamic, and full of variety: large islands, deserts, dense forests, fertile countryside, mountains and fjords. A world with a rich history, and many a story. A world of several nations, each pursuing its own interests.\n\nBuild your town in this world in a way that it can grow and prosper. Gather resources and manage the food supply. Expand and improve your town by planning it with foresight and building roads and fortifications. Construct buildings to improve its productivity. Hire traveling entertainers and organize a fair to keep your settlers happy. Claim lands and villages, and establish trade relations to expand your kingdom and supply enough produce for your growing population of settlers.\n\nImmerse yourself in your town and allow yourself to be captivated by the lively, realistic world you've created. You can follow the routes of all goods and resources. Watch woodcutters felling trees in the woods and transporting the wood in panniers or by cart to the storehouse. Should the wood from the sawmill be used for more valuable goods, or will you use it to construct buildings? Or follow the master builder as he transports building material by horse and cart on the roads you've built to the outskirts of the town, and then starts to build a wall.\n\nWhat a fantastic world! But will your town stand the test of time? Your settlers have needs and lives of their own. If they have too little to eat, they will fall ill or feel threatened, and your town will come to a standstill. If they are well fed and happy, they will worship you. The seasons and extreme weather conditions will test your skills as a master builder. Have you enough food supplies to see your settlers through the harsh winter? Have you made sure that the woodcutters have not cut down all the trees in the forest, destroying the environment of the wild animals your hunters bring down for food? Other nations and settlements will try to loot your towns or even destroy them once they become rich and prosperous. Put your troops on your town walls to keep a lookout for enemies, or send them out to attack any foes trying to capture the last stone quarry from under your nose. Have you built a town that will collapse after the first heavy storm, or will it outlast the centuries?\n\nIn Campaign mode you can establish an empire with your knights and heroes that encompasses lands and continents. Choosing the right knights to master the diverse challenges of each mission is crucial. Will you go down in history as the greatest ruler of all times ?\n\nIn Freeplay mode you can settle maps at your own pace until the last territory is taken, all villages are connected to your town, and your subjects are all content. You can build large towns with your friends, or compete against them via a LAN or the Internet. And you can do all of this in the most detailed, graphically impressive world of any strategy game that has ever been brought to life on a PC."
