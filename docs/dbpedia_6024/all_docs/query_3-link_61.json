        "text": "The 2007 holiday season was defined as much by its many delays as the games that did make it to market. This year, the industry has done a better job of hitting its deadlines, which translates to wave after wave of high-profile releases as the holiday sales tsunami builds toward December.\n\nOne game pushed out of late 2007 was Ubisoft and Gearbox's Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway. The game has been hit with a number of delays since it was originally pushed to early 2008, most recently bouncing to this week from August. Now with its kit together, the story-driven, squad-based shooter hops from its perfectly good airplane, following the 101st Airborne Division over a 10-day stretch as they attempt to secure an Axis-controlled road behind enemy lines. Hell's Highway will deploy on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Wii gamers will finally have a chance to fire up their own installment in the series, Brother's in Arms: Double Time.\n\nWhile Warner Bros.' summer box-office smash The Dark Knight arrived without a game-adaptation sidekick, its internally owned Traveller's Tales studio will release its homage to the legendary DC Comics hero with Lego Batman. Descending not so much like a thief in the night as a carnie at a state fair, Lego Batman brings the same style of quirky humor to Gotham as Traveller's Tales' Lego Star Wars brought to George Lucas' revered universe. The game will be available for the Xbox 360, PS3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, DS, and PC.\n\nThe casual-gaming crowd has a number of titles to look forward to this week. On the PS3, Sony has released the latest installment in its European studios' popular Buzz! Quiz TV trivia game. On the Wii, unlikely developer Gearbox--responsible for the aforementioned Hell's Highway--will also ship out Samba de Amigo, a maraca-shaking rhythm game that draws its roots from the widely acclaimed Sega Dreamcast title of the same name. Also on the Wii, Nintendo's platformer Wario Land: Shake It! and THQ's vibrant painting game de Blob are out this week.\n\nWith Disgaea 3 hitting the PS3 last month, NIS America will release Disgaea: Hour of Darkness on the DS. NIS' latest revamp of VIZ Media's droll 2003 original grid-based strategy game for the PS2 features a number of game tweaks, including new playable characters and Prinny commentary. In other DS remake news, Nintendo will rerelease the Super NES 2D platformer Kirby Super Star Ultra on its popular portable.\n\nTake-Two may have brought Sid Meier's award-winning Civilization to consoles earlier this year with Revolution, but the publisher isn't yet done with the platform that gave Civ its start. Civilization IV: Colonization for the PC is a spin-off of the 2005 installment, bringing the franchise's signature \"just-one-more-turn\" gameplay to the New World.\n\nCapcom's 8-bit revival Mega Man 9 leaps onto WiiWare and the PlayStation Network this week for $10 (1,000 Wii points). Both Sony's and Nintendo's digital distribution stores will also receive an additional downloadable title, with the PSN getting the Studio Liverpool-developed futuristic racer Wipeout HD ($20) and WiiWare being stocked with Bplus' puzzle shooter Plattchen: Twist 'n' Paint (1,000 Wii points, $10).\n\nWhile there's still no sign of Duke Nukem Forever on new-release lists, 3D Realms will be deliver Duke Nukem 3D to Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade this week. The game will cost 800 Microsoft points ($10).\n\nThis week's new releases are listed below (list taken from retailer information--actual dates may vary).\n\nSEPTEMBER 22, 2008\n\nBaja: Edge of Control (X360, PS3)\n\nBrain Quest Grades 3 & 4 (DS)\n\nBrain Quest Grades 5 & 6 (DS)\n\nde Blob (Wii)\n\nDi-Gata Defenders (DS)\n\nDropCast (DS)\n\nEA Sports '08 Collection (PC)\n\nHell's Kitchen (PC)\n\nKirby Super Star Ultra (DS)\n\nMedal of Honor: 10th Anniversary Edition (PC)\n\nMega Man 9 (WiiWare)\n\nMy Little Pony Pinkie Pie's Party (PC)\n\nNancy Drew: The Hidden Staircase (DS)\n\nPlattchen: Twist 'n' Paint (WiiWare)\n\nSid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization (PC)\n\nSimCity Creator (Wii, DS)\n\nSuper Dodge Ball (Wii VC)\n\nThe Price is Right (PC)\n\nThe Settlers: Rise of an Empire Gold Edition (PC)\n\nVectorman (Wii VC)\n\nWario Land: Shake It!
