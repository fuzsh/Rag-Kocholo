        "text": "Blue Byte was founded in 1988 by Thomas Hertzler and a fellow colleague at the German development company Rainbow Arts. The company's first title was Pro Tennis Tour, a fast action tennis simulation for the Super NES, published by Ubi Soft. In 1991, Blue Byte began to self-publish its titles and finally established an international office in the United States in 1995. Three years later, Blue Byte moved from Chicago, Illinois, to its new facilities in Austin, Texas.\n\nBlue Byte's most popular franchise titles include The Battle Isle and The Settlers series.\n\nThe company was acquired by French publishing house Ubi Soft in February 2001."
