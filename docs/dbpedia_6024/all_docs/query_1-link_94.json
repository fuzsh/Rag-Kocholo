        "text": "Ubisoft recently flew IGN AU to its Ubi Days event in San Fran, where we had a peek at some of the games the company is releasing this year. Nestled quietly between the exploding landscape of Brothers in Arms and the frantic four-player co-op of Haze, we stumbled upon an intriguing gem of a game. It would have been easy to miss The Settlers: Rise of an Empire - for one thing, it didn't have the booming sound system of the games all around it, or seventeen different plasma screens showing off its advanced blood splatter effects. But when we spied the almost fatherly figure of one of the game's developers proudly demonstrating the game to those in the know, we knew there was something special to be seen.\n\nAs novices to The Settlers series, we felt almost embarrassed to admit that we'd only taken a token look at previous games. But after watching the demo guy lovingly demonstrate the intricate world he's helped craft within the game, the latest instalment in The Settlers series shot straight to the top of our \"Relaxing Sunday Afternoon Games to be Enjoyed with a Glass of Merlot and a Slice of Camembert\" list. Unlike almost every other game on the planet, this one looks relaxing and creative rather than stressful and anxious. There was so much charm and charisma in the game's art style and animations that we couldn't help but care about the settlement he built during our demo.\n\nOur city management skills extend about as far as \"build a thousand tanks and rush the enemy player's base\" thanks to our experience with RTS titles, so we thought we'd ask the developers about how they'd recommend players set up their cities in the latest Settler's game. Ubisoft came through with the goods, delivering the game's producer Benedikt Grindel up for an interview, dressed in the dirty rags of one of the game's peasant wenches. If wenches wore skivvies, that is.\n\nIGN AU: Where is the optimal position for establishing a settlement, and have the requirements changed from earlier games?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: In \"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\" you have a given starting location on each map where the player finds a marketplace, storehouse and castle. The player develops one settlement to a city and not - like in earlier games - several smaller settlements. \"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\" focuses on developing a big city with producers inside and gatherers outside the city walls.\n\nIGN AU: What are the best buildings to begin a settlement with? Are there any new building types that players should focus on?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: First of all the player will need resources like wood and stone to create buildings and food to satisfy The Settlers' needs. One strategy for the start could be:\n\nBuild a Woodcutter (wood), a Hunter (meat) and a Butcher that makes sausages out of the hunter's meat.\n\nSometimes, you will find a stone mine on your starting territory. Otherwise send out your knight to look for one.\n\nBuild a grain farm (when the territory is suitable) and a Bakery.\n\nUpgrade Butcher and Bakery and Grain farm to level two.\n\nNow you can concentrate on complying the requirements to promote your knight.\n\nThat means: Get more settlers, upgrade special buildings and gather goods.\n\nOf course, this basic strategy depends largely upon the specific map layout. Sometimes, no animals that can be hunted are in the near area. But you can fish. Or trade.\n\nIGN AU: Is the threat of attack great at the beginning of a settlement, or should players focus more on resources?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: During the campaign the player will find challenging maps where he is confronted with foes early on. But as \"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\" focuses on construction, there are ways to make sure to have enough time to prepare for defence. Combat is a challenge the player meets while creating his city, not the ultimate goal of each map.\n\nIGN AU: What's the best way for the players to keep track of how their settlement is shaping up? Has this system evolved since the last game?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: The Settlers will clearly communicate to you how they are doing and if the settlement is shaping up nicely. They will speak to you, they will gather on the marketplace to protest, they will cheer when you have been promoted. You can also see the status of each building or click on a settler to hear how he feels. We are partly building upon the system we used for \"The Settlers: Heritage of Kings\" and have added some additional layers of feedback.\n\nIGN AU: How can players ensure they've got plenty of room to grow as their settlement expands? Should they sketch out a rough map of what they're planning before beginning?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: It will be important to explore the area close to the starting point. It might help to sketch out a rough map, but as the world is quite clear and you can build on top of trees and small stones, it is easy to understand what your basic options are. One thing that will be important to plan early on is where to place your city wall.\n\nIGN AU: How easy is it for a player to change their mind regarding building placement. For example, will it be easy for them to totally relocate their butcher's district to another area?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: Every building (except castle, marketplace and storehouse) can be deconstructed by giving the command in the building's menu. Some of the resources used for constructing the building will be refunded and the area will be available for free use again. It's very flexible in this matter.\n\nIGN AU: Do you favour using specific regions of the city for specific tasks, or is it better for the player to evenly space everything out?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: It is important to keep in mind that The Settlers have to deliver and get resources to / from the storehouse. So it is useful to keep important buildings near the city centre and to take care that every settler can access a building with goods for fulfilling his needs in a short time. Totally specialized \"quarters\", like a row where all the tanners and weavers are located, are probably not the best way to lay out a city. But then, you have to find out some things for yourself…\n\nIGN AU: What are the coolest new units that affect how players will design their city?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: The most important unit is the knight that the player chooses before starting a mission. Each knight has special abilities that will influence the city's structure. The coolest new unit depends upon each player's personal perception, of course. To me, it is the trader, as with efficient trading at the right time I can speed up the development of the city quite a bit.\n\nIGN AU: How important is the military aspect to the city design?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: The walls are the most important part of city defence. To have a strong city wall that protects your most important buildings early on - with as few gates as possible to be able to protect them better and as many as necessary to have efficient transportation - will ensure that your enemies cannot defeat you easily. Your military units should have easy access to walls and gates. It can be wise to construct military buildings near the city gates, so they are available in a short time. It is also good to have important buildings in the city centre as far away from the outer walls as possible to protect them.\n\nIGN AU: In your opinion, what's the most important thing to remember when designing and building a city?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: Streets. Always think about streets! And keep in mind that there will be additional needs when the city grows. It is wise to plan some space for buildings that satisfy these needs.\n\nIGN AU: Do you have any tips on the most efficient way to gather resources?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: When upgrading a gatherer building, transport will get faster (backpack to pushcart to donkey cart). The player can use this to fasten up the delivery of resources to the storehouse. This is especially important if resources are harvested far away - you really want to speed up your transportation in that situation! If you upgrade your streets to stone streets, the transport will be even faster. At the same time, keep in mind that some resources have to regrow (e.g. wood, wild animal, fish). If you gather these resources too fast, they will disappear and it will take quite some time before they return.\n\nIGN AU: What other major changes have you implemented that make designing the cities easier?\n\nBenedikt Grindel: I think that the one key element that makes designing cities easy and fun is that there are very few clear and simple rules. The combination of these rules is what makes it complex, and the different situations you are facing (different climate zones, different resource situations, etc.) makes it challenging. But due to the simple rules, building a working settlement and then developing it into a bustling medieval city is something everybody will be able to do. The better players will just do it a little bit faster.\n\nThe Settlers: Rise of an Empire hits the PC this October."
