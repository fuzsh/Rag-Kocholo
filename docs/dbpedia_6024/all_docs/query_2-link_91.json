A) because of copyright issues, b) because of streaming c) because if a magazine did it, that would soon be forbidden, and the publisher would jump in and want to do that instead to ensure more profits …\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n22,173\n\nLocation\n\nOld Europe\n\nKordanor\n\nWastelander\n\nJoined\n\nJune 2, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n4,713\n\nAugust 23, 2018\n\n#9\n\nYes, that's how the box of the first game looked like.\n\nOne gaming magazine had audio tracks of the main themes of many games on their magazine's CD, and one of them had The Settler's very first theme …\n\nOf course, no gaming magazine won't do that today.

One example would be Dungeon Keeper.\n\nBut I also remember that Settlers 2 had at least it's intro song as audio track on cd. One of the most amazing tracks of any intro (at least if you like that kind of evangelis style music)\n\nJoined\n\nJun 2, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n4,713\n\nDarkheart\n\nSasqWatch\n\nJoined\n\nFebruary 21, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,202\n\nLocation\n\nBW, Germany\n\nAugust 23, 2018\n\n#10\n\nMe and my buddy played Settlers I to death.
