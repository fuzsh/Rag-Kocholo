        "text": "Although the autopsy is not complete, authorities in Memphis announced yesterday that soul legend Isaac Hayes apparently died of a stroke.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Sheriff’s spokesman Steve Shular said that paperwork filed by Hayes’ family physician, Dr. David Kraus, lists the cause of death as a.\n\nNo official determination has been released by the medical examiner’s office or filed with the Memphis health department, which issues death certificates.\n\nOn Sunday, family members found Hayes laying unconscious on the floor of his Memphis home beside a treadmill that was still running. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital an hour later.\n\nRelatives said Hayes was under a doctor’s care but did not provide further details.\n\nThe family issued the following statement: “We are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from Isaac’s dear friends, colleagues and fans from every corner of the world, and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers. While he was an iconic figure to many, to us he was husband, father and friend. We will ever miss his love, wisdom, humor and the familiar comfort of his voice.”\n\nIsaac Hayes is survived by his wife of three years Adjowa Hayes, and their 2-year-old son Kwadjo Hayes; ten children, Jacqueline Fields, Felecia Hayes Fisher, Veronica Hayes, Vincent Hayes, Melanie Hayes, Nikki McGhee, Heather Hayes, Isaac Hayes III, Darius Caston and Lillian Bryant; 14 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held in Cordova, Tennessee on Monday at Hope Presbyterian Church (8500 Walnut Grove) from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m."
