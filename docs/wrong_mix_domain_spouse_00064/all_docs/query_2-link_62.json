        "text": "Isaac Hayes\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nHelped Invent Stax Sound\n\nStardom With Hot Buttered Soul\n\nCriticism Despite Success\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nIsaac Hayes saw success early in his musical career as a session musician and songwriter at legendary Stax-Volt Records, the birthplace of commercial Memphis soul music. With David Porter, Hayes authored such hits as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Coming” for the famed R&B duo Sam & Dave, as well as a host of others. Though he struggled in his initial efforts as a recording artist, Hayes broke through in 1969 with the influential album Hoi Buttered Soul and ended up taking home an Oscar for the theme song to the blaxploitation film Shaft. Though critics have charted Hayes’s influence through almost every subsequent strain of black music—crediting him for inventing disco and paving the way for deep-voiced crooners like Barry White—many regarded him as a hack impresario, citing his lengthy “progressive soul” jams, his over-the-top concerts, and his claiming the mantle “Black Moses.” After struggling through the 1970s both artistically and financially, Hayes retired from music a few times—returning for short-lived “comeback” recordings—and pursued a film acting career.\n\nHayes was born August 20, 1942, in Covington, Tennessee, on a sharecropper’s farm; orphaned during his infancy, he was raised by his grandparents. He first sang publicly in church at the age of five. “When I graduated from high school I wanted to be a performer,” Hayes told Down Beat “But at that time, in Memphis, there was no market for the kind of music I wanted to do.” His preferred style was pop—as exemplified by the velvety singing of Nat King Cole—but Memphis was a blues/R&B town. Hayes married early and thus chose a steady job over higher education or music; though he recorded a single in 1962, nothing came of it. He worked in a meat packing plant and then eased himself back into music, playing gigs in local clubs with his group, Sir Isaac and the Doo-Dads. He claimed to be a pianist despite limited training on the instrument: “I learned a little about the piano and as time went on more and more chords and so forth,” he told Rolling Stone.\n\nHelped Invent Stax Sound\n\nHis first break came when Floyd Newman, a Stax-Volt house player with whom Hayes had been playing, invited the fledgling keyboardist in to cut an instrumental. The Stax sound was largely created by a core unit called the MGs, featuring keyboardist Booker T. Jones, guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn, and drummer Al Jackson, Jr. Hayes recalled to Down Beat that Jones left to attend school and Hayes was invited to replace him; his first session was for an album by legendary vocalist Otis Redding. Staying on at Stax,\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn August 20, 1942, in Covington, TN; son of Isaac and Eula Hayes; married, c. 1960 (divorced); children: eight.\n\nWorked in meat packing plant; performed in clubs with Sir Isaac and the Doo-Dads, Memphis, TN; worked as house musician and songwriter, Stax-Volt Records, 1964-67; released first solo album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, 1967; released first ABC/Hot Buttered Soul album, Chocolate Chip, 1975; signed to Polydor Records and released New Horizons, 1977; film and television actor and radio host, c. 1976—; appeared in Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Twentieth Century Fox, 1993.\n\nAwards: Academy Award for best song from a motion picture and Grammy awards for best instrumental arrangement and best original score written for a motion picture, 1971, for “Theme From Shaft”; Grammy Award for best pop instrumental performance by an arranger, composer, orchestra and/or choral leader, 1972, for Black Moses; Grammy award nominations, 1978, for composition of Dionne Warwick’s “Déjà Vu” and for best male R&B performer.\n\nAddresses: Booking agent —Headline Talent Inc., 1650 Broadway, Ste. 508, New York, NY 10019.\n\nHayes played piano alongside Jones and put in session work on virtually all of Redding’s recordings.\n\nSomewhat later Hayes hooked up with lyricist David Porter, and the two wrote for a number of Stax artists, most notably Sam & Dave. With “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Coming,” among others, Hayes and Porter helped to define the funky, exuberant style of mid-sixties soul, a style that would challenge the dominance of Stax’s northern competitor, Detroit’s Motown. The Stax sound would profoundly influence not only ensuing generations of R&B, soul, and funk artists, but also rock and roll groups like the Rolling Stones. As influential as these songs were, they were not written in an exacting manner. Hayes, unable to read or write music, would hum his tunes into a tape recorder and find arrangers to chart them out. But the tunes were powerful and authentic; as Time reported, “Into their songs, Hayes and Porter injected the whole experience of the black ghetto.”\n\nAt a Stax office party, Hayes was approached by Al Bell, the company’s vice-president. The two were a bit drunk on champagne, and, according to Hayes’s reminiscences in Down Beat, Bell said: “Come on in the studio, I want to cut something on you.” “I didn’t take him seriously, but I said OK,” Hayes related, “so we went back there and he turned on the machine and I just started going through some things—we hadn’t rehearsed or anything—and out of that came the first LP.” Hayes was assisted in the studio by Dunn and Jackson. The album was called Presenting Isaac Hayes. “It was a simple, powerful record,” wrote Rolling Stone. “It bombed.”\n\nStardom With Hot Buttered Soul\n\nHayes admitted in Down Beat that he “could have done better,” and later Bell gave him the chance to prove it. “Some three years later, in January 1969, AI Bell came to me and said: ‘We have a sales meeting in May, and the quota is 27 LPs, and I need one from you.’ So I said: ‘Wait a minute, man. You need an LP. Can I cut it like I want to cut it?’ And he says, ‘Yeah, man—whatever you want to do. Just give me the LP.’”\n\nThe album in question was Hot Buttered Soul, and it made Isaac Hayes a star. With only four songs, it was a very unusual soul record, but the time was ripe for musical experimentation; Soul went platinum, hitting Number Eight on the pop charts. Exceedingly lush compared to the spartan grooves of the Stax jukebox, the record utilizes strings and backing vocalists to produce an almost symphonic quality. “One of the few weaknesses of Hot Buttered Soul is the tendency of the production to overwhelm the basic funkiness of Hayes’ voice and organ,” noted Rolling Stone. “More frequently, however, his deep sandpaper voice rubs straight into the heart of a song.” Indeed, Hayes’s gravelly pre-song monologues—he called it “rapping” before rap music existed—and deep crooning established a tradition of R&B bedroom patter upon which singer Barry White built an impressive career. Of Hayes’s persona, Vince Aletti of the Village Voice wrote in 1986, “If his image was aggressively macho (shaved head, bared chest, chains) on vinyl, Hayes turned to mush—a sensitive stud oozing sincerity and concern: [blaxploitation hero] Superfly in love. The pose was bogus but benign; the format—extended love talk/extended love song— was killer.”\n\nThe follow-up recordings Isaac Hayes Movement and ... To Be Continued also made it into the Top 20. Hayes struck again in 1971 with the theme to the urban cop thriller Shaft, for which he won an Academy Award and Grammy awards for best instrumental arrangement and best original score written for a motion picture. The song—a tense, funky workout with horns, flute, and strings that also gave the wah-wah guitar sound a preeminent place in ’70s soul—features a call-and-response dialogue between Hayes and several female backup singers. Its lyrics (“Who’s the black private dick who’s a sex machine to all the chicks?”) and sound helped to mold the music of the era. In it are elements from a wide array of musical styles from jazz to R&B to gospel. The “Theme From Shaft ” reached Number One on the pop charts and went platinum. Hayes became a superstar, riding around in limousines and sporting extravagant outfits. “I like luxury, man,” he told Time, “because it’s what I never had.”\n\nCriticism Despite Success\n\nHayes snagged a 1972 Grammy Award for best pop instrumental performance by an arranger, composer, orchestra and/or choral leader in honor of his 1971 effort Black Moses. Both of his 1973 releases, Live at the Sahara Tahoe and Joy, were certified gold. In the meantime, he was performing to huge crowds, presenting what Rolling Stone sarcastically referred to as “beautifully executed lounge music.” But the magazine cited even harsher criticism, noting, “A prominent black music writer privately accuses Ike [Hayes] of perpetrating ‘the ultimate degradation of black music.’” The same article quoted a musician acquaintance of Hayes’s as saying, “Ike’s fried his mind on acid and his music’s never been the same.”\n\nHayes’s records—including the soundtracks to the blaxploitation films Truck Turner and Three Tough Guys, in which he also appeared as an actor—continued to sell reasonably well. Having had a falling out and extended legal wrangling with Stax, which ultimately went bankrupt, he established his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, as an ABC subsidiary. In 1975, he released Chocolate Chip, which was certified gold, and Groove-a-Thon. The next year, he helped make disco a household word with Juicy Fruit. (The title cut from the album is subtitled “Disco Freak.”) Melody Maker noted in its review of Juicy Fruit that Hayes’s “[work] subsequent to ‘Chip’ has been a blend of straight disco grist and ponderous ballads, and his latest is no exception.”\n\nUnfortunately, 1976 also saw Hayes forced to declare bankruptcy, due to both the mishandling of funds by his managers and his own excesses. Relocating to Atlanta, Hayes appeared on the TV show The Rockford Files and, in 1977, signed with Polydor Records. During the late 1970s, he released a flurry of records, including Royal Rappin’s, which he recorded with singer Millie Jackson. Several of his early Stax albums were re-released around this time. He received two Grammy nominations in 1978, and the title track from the 1979 effort Don’t Let Go was certified gold. He also appeared in the 1981 film Escape From New York and hosted a syndicated radio show. Even so, his difficulties continued, and he removed himself from the limelight for the rest of the first half of the 1980s. When he returned with the album U-Turn —with its anti-drug single “Ike’s Rap”—in 1986, he told Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times he’d spent the intervening years in Atlanta and London: “I haven’t been doing that much, just little odds and ends to survive and keep the bills paid.” Hunt called the new album “vintage Hayes dressed up with modern techno-pop touches.”\n\nIn 1991 Jet reported that Hayes planned to collaborate on an album with Barry White. He had in the meantime appeared in more films and seen further evidence of his importance in the development of pop music, as rap, rock, and funk spun variations on his innovations. Though many critics derided his image and impulses, Hayes had emerged as a crucial influence on the American music scene.\n\nSelected discography\n\nOn Stax\n\nPresenting Isaac Hayes, 1967.\n\nHot Buttered Soul, 1969.\n\nIsaac Hayes Movement, 1970.\n\n. . .

Music fans and observers also recalled his outlandish stage shows of the 1970s, in which the bald singer appeared amidst a phalanx of musicians and dancers in a cape, a fur-and-leather shirt, masses of gold jewelry, and black tights. His career had never regained the momentum it had in the 1969–71 period, when Hayes was a top seller for the Stax label. Hayes, however, had always remained an instantly identifiable public figure and, by the late 1990s, it had become clear how greatly he had influenced subsequent generations of African American musicians.\n\nAn Innovative Musical Talent\n\nFrom the beginning of his career, Hayes was an innovator. In contrast with the gospel-derived, highly-charged vocals of his soul compatriots at Stax, Hayes pioneered a cool vocal style; his relaxed baritone was conversational and romantic. The pillow talk of the 1970s and 1980s megastar Barry White was directly inspired by Hayes’s style. The elaborate production and insistent four-beat of recordings such as “Shaft” prefigured the disco movement; Hayes himself had some success during the disco era. Years before the word “rap” had come to denote a musical style, Hayes was referring to the lengthy spoken interludes in his songs and performances as rapping. Modern hip-hop musicians testified to the depth of Hayes’s influence by repeatedly sampling his recordings.\n\nIsaac Hayes was born into poverty on a sharecropper’s farm on August 20, 1942, in Covington, Tennessee. His mother died when he was a baby and he was raised by grandparents, who moved to Memphis when Isaac was seven. Hayes received little formal education and was forced to take jobs picking cotton, pumping gas, and helping out at a junkyard in order to survive. He persevered, however, and eventually graduated from high school. As a high school student, Hayes cultivated an interest in music that had begun when his grandparents encouraged him to sing in church at age five and had grown through the influence of another family member: “I can remember my aunt had a juke joint, and anybody who walked in the door could sing as good as B.\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn August 20, 1942, in Covington, TN; son of Isaac and Euta Hayes; married and divorced; eight children. Education: Graduated from high school in Memphis.\n\nCareer: Soul music vocalist; worked in meat packing plant; performed in Memphis clubs, early 1960s; staff musician and songwriter, Stax Records, 1964–67; co-composer of hits “Soul Man” and “Hold On I’m Comin’” for Sam and Dave; released debut album Presenting Isaac Hayes, 1967; released breakthrough album Hot Buttered Soul, 1969; signed with ABC, 1975; signed with Polydor, 1977; numerous film and television appearances, 1976–; released two albums on Point Blank label, 1995; voice of Chef on television’s South Park, 1996–.\n\nSelected awards: Academy award, Best Song from a Motion Picture, and Grammy awards for Best Instrumental Arrangement and Best Original Score (all for music from Shaft ), 1971; Grammy award, Best Pop Instrumental Performance (for Black Moses ), 1972; two Grammy award nominations, 1978.\n\nAddresses: Record label —PolyGram Records, 810 Seventh Ave., New York, NY 10019.\n\nB. King, Sonny Boy Williamson, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Muddy Waters, or Howlin’ Wolf,” Hayes told Interview magazine. By sheer force of will, he learned to play the piano.\n\nWhile working as a meat packer, Hayes fronted several bands that played in Memphis clubs in the early 1960s. Music became an integral part of his life in 1964 when he met saxophonist Floyd Newman, a member of the Mar-Keys and an early mainstay of Memphis’s soul-music record label, Stax. Hayes was asked to replace the legendary Stax keyboardist Booker T. Jones on a session date, and was soon finding regular work as a Stax session musician. Many of Otis Redding’s classic soul recordings for Stax featured Hayes at the keyboard.\n\nRecorded His First Album\n\nHayes also began to work with a lyricist friend, David Porter, and the pair had several spectacular successes as a songwriting team, most notably with the two big hits scored by the duo of Sam & Dave, “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Coming.” In 1967, Stax vice-president Al Bell invited Hayes to cut an album. The album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, sold poorly, but Hayes continued to refine his skills. When he received another opportunity to record an album in 1969, he was ready.\n\nThe record that launched Isaac Hayes’s career, Hot Buttered Soul, was a groundbreaking work that represented Stax’s effort to respond to the musical experimentation pioneered by Motown during the late 1960s. Featuring elaborate arrangements with strings and backup vocals, the entire album contained only four songs, one of them an 18-minute, 40-second version of Jimmy Webb’s country-pop hit, “By the Time I Get to Phoenix.” Hayes extended songs through the use of introductory monologues, which he called “rapping,” and by playing long instrumental interludes on the organ. The album sold over one million copies and reached number eight on the pop charts. It also marked Stax’s most successful effort to cross over to popular audiences.\n\nLaunched a Successful Solo Career\n\nHot Buttered Soul launched Hayes’s solo career and he became one of the top-grossing concert acts of the early 1970s. Although he became extremely wealthy, he squandered most of his money and was forced to declare bankruptcy on two occasions. The speech-song mixtures from Hot Buttered Soul appeared in his famous Shaft theme, which featured a dialogue between Hayes and his ever-present female backup singers, and offered an unusual arrangement that included a flute and a rhythmic use of wah-wah guitar. The recording of “Shaft” reached number one on the pop charts and earned Hayes both Academy and Grammy awards. He also became the first African American composer to be honored with an Academy award.\n\nEven as his financial troubles mounted and the careers of his fellow Stax artists declined, Hayes forged ahead during the middle and late 1970s. Signing with the ABC label in 1975 and with Polydor in 1977, Hayes made a successful foray into disco with the 1976 album Juicy Fruit and its single “Juicy Fruit (Disco Freak).” He also recorded duet albums with Dionne Warwick (A Man and a Woman, 1977) and fellow proto-rapper Millie Jackson (Royal Rappin’s, 1979). Hayes also realized his long-held dream of becoming an actor, appearing on the television program The Rockford Files and taking roles in several films, including the science-fiction thriller Escape from New York and J’m Gonna Git You Sucka, the Keenen Ivory Wayans parody of the “blaxploitation” film genre.\n\nAfter dropping out of sight for a time in the 1980s, Hayes re-emerged with the albums U-Turn in 1986 and Love Attack in 1988, both on the Columbia label. He released two albums for the Point Blank label in 1995, Branded and the instrumental Raw and Refined, which Interview writer Dimitri Ehrlich remarked “find him burrowing into jazzy, syncopated grooves, gracefully reveling in heightened realms of musicality and mojo.” Interview estimated that Hayes’s recordings had been sampled—digitally quoted—over 50 times by rappers and producers in 1993 alone, and the “gangsta” rap image plainly owed much to Hayes’s grandiose stage productions. Hayes continued his acting career and, in the late 1990s, gained considerable popularity as the voice of Chef, the school-canteen worker on the outrageous animated television series South Park. He also hosted a soul music radio program on New York’s KISS-FM radio station. A figure nearly universally recognized since his Shaft days, Isaac Hayes remained in the limelight.\n\nSelected discography\n\nPresenting Isaac Hayes, Stax, 1967.\n\nHot Buttered Soul, Stax, 1969.\n\nIsaac Hayes Movement, Stax, 1970.\n\nShaft (soundtrack), Stax, 1971.\n\nBlack Moses, Stax, 1971.\n\nTough Guys (soundtrack), Stax, 1973.\n\nChocolate Chip, ABC, 1975.\n\nJuicy Fruit, ABC, 1976.\n\nA Man and a Woman (with Dionne Warwick), Polydor, 1977.\n\nRoyal Rappin’s (with Millie Jackson), Polydor, 1979.\n\nEnterprise—His Greatest Hits, Stax, 1980.\n\nU-Turn, Polydor, 1986.\n\nBranded, Point Blank, 1995.\n\nRaw and Refined, Point Blank, 1995.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Musicians, volume 10, Gale, 1994.\n\nGuralnick, Peter, Sweet Soul Music, Harper & Row, 1986.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, eds., The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul, St. Martin’s, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, March 25, 1995, p. 23.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, June 9, 1995, p. 59.\n\nInterview, May 1995, p. 24.\n\nNewsweek, March 23, 1998; p. 60.\n\nPeople, July 8, 1996, p. 101.\n\n—James M. Manheim\n\nIsaac Hayes\n\n1942–\n\nSinger, composer\n\nMusician Isaac Hayes' greatest fame rests on one composition, Theme from Shaft, which became an iconic soundtrack for the 1970s as the theme song to the Blaxploitation film Shaft, an African American-oriented police drama released in 1971. Music fans and observers also recalled his outlandish stage shows of the 1970s, in which the bald singer appeared amidst a phalanx of musicians and dancers in a cape, a fur-and-leather shirt, masses of gold jewelry, and black tights. His music career flagged after the momentum it had when Hayes was a top seller for the Stax label in the early 1970s. Yet Hayes remained active, seeking out new career opportunities and charitable work. By the late 1990s, Hayes had found celebrity yet again as the voice of Chef on the animated show South Park.

Signing with the ABC label in 1975 and with Polydor in 1977, Hayes made a successful foray into disco with the 1976 album Juicy Fruit and its single \"Juicy Fruit (Disco Freak).\" He also recorded duet albums with Dionne Warwick (A Man and a Woman, 1977) and fellow proto-rapper Millie Jackson (Royal Rappin's, 1979).

Hayes was cast as the voice of Chef, a school cook and \"mentor\" to the show's youthful main characters. Early on Hayes had his doubts that joining the show was a wise career move. \"We started putting episodes in the can, and when the airdate was announced, I started thinking, 'I've ruined my career, man. I'm going to have to run out of town …,'\" Hayes remembered to the San Francisco Chronicle in 2005. \"But when the thing aired, the ratings went through the roof.\" By the early 2000s Hayes had gained considerable popularity as the voice of Chef, finding that he would be greeted at record signings by music fans as well as a number of fans wanting him to sign Chef dolls. \"That's when I realized my fan base had spread from 6 to 96,\" he related to the San Francisco Chronicle. After a decade as the voice of Chef, Hayes abruptly quit the series in the spring of 2006 after an episode that mocked his religion, Scientology. In a statement quoted in the Chicago Defender, Hayes explained his reasoning: \"Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices.\" Hayes's comments provoked skeptics to point out that Hayes had participated in many South Park episodes that mocked other religions over the years. After Hayes left the show, South Park aired an episode in which Chef met with a gruesome demise.\n\nThe split with South Park did not seem to bother Hayes as he turned his attentions to other aspects of his career. He remained committed to his music, and began work on a new album. He continued hosting a soul music radio program; He had a six-year run on New York's KISS-FM radio station in 2002 before moving to Memphis' WRBO Soul Classics in 2000. He reaped rewards from the popularity of his memoir/cookbook, Cooking With Heart & Soul: Making Music in the Kitchen with Family and Friends, as it went into multiple printings after its publication in 2000, and his barbeque sauce brought in profits since its market introduction in 2000. He also held court on stage at his Isaac Hayes-Music-Food-Passion restaurants that he had opened in the early 2000s in Memphis and Chicago. And through his Isaac Hayes Foundation, which he set up in 1999, Hayes offered aid to people, especially children around the globe.
