        "text": "Posted Aug. 13, 2008 – A celebration of the life of powerhouse composer-musician Isaac Hayes will be held on Monday at Hope Presbyterian Church in Cordova, Tenn.\n\n:: AD ::\n\nThe Grammy, Golden Globe and Academy-award-winning artist passed away Sunday in Memphis at the age of 65.\n\n“We are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from Isaac’s dear friends, colleagues and fans from every corner of the world, and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers,” the family issued in a statement late Tuesday. “While he was an iconic figure to many, to us he was husband, father and friend. We will ever miss his love, wisdom, humor and the familiar comfort of his voice.”\n\nBorn into rural poverty to a sharecropper family on Aug. 20, 1942, in Covington, Tenn., but rising to the pinnacle of American music, Hayes paved the way for fellow African-American entertainers, his family said. During his lifetime, he was also recognized as an author, actor and radio personality.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of three years, Adjowa Hayes; their 2-year-old son, Kwadjo Hayes; 10 children, Jacqueline Fields, Felecia Hayes Fisher, Veronica Hayes, Vincent Hayes, Melanie Hayes, Nikki McGhee, Heather Hayes, Isaac Hayes III, Darius Caston and Lillian Bryant; 14 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be sent to the Stax Music Academy and his Stax Records Legacy in Memphis, made out to Soulsville, 926 E. McLemore Avenue, Memphis, TN 38106. Please specify “In memory of Isaac Hayes.”\n\nHope Presbyterian Church, where Monday’s memorial service will be held, is at 850 Walnut Grove. The service will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Condolences may be sent to message@isaachayes.com<mailto:message@isaachayes.com.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
