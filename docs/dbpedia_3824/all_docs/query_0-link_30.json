To these ends, each volume will have its own theme and title and will be planned by one or more members of the Advisory Board in consultation with the editor. Although the volumes have specific themes, the series itself will not be limited to one or even to a few particular areas. Its subjects include any of the sciences, ranging from biology through physics, all aspects of technology, broadly construed, as well as historically-engaged philosophy of science or technology. Taken as a whole, Archimedes will be of interest to historians, philosophers, and scientists, as well as to those in business and industry who seek to understand how science and industry have come to be so strongly linked.\n\nDavid Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics (1898-1918) From Grundlagen der Geometrie to Grundlagen der Physik\n\nby\n\nLEO CORRY Cohn Institute for History and Philosophy of Science, Tel Aviv University, Israel\n\nSpringer-Science+Business Media, B.V.\n\nA C.I.P.

This more focused research started during the academic year 199495, which I spent at the Max-Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte, Berlin, and continued intensely during the following year, at the Dibner Institute for History of Science and Technology at MIT. Later on, it has continued as part of my regular academic activities at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas, Tel-Aviv University. The first, partial results of my research appeared in 1997 as a lengthy article in Archive for History of Exact Sciences: “David Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics (1895-1905)” (Corry 1997a). Over the next few years many works dealing with topics directly and indirectly related to my own focus of interest have been published by several colleagues. Together with some additional articles written by myself, these publications have helped create a very comprehensive picture of the themes that I consider in this book. The recent publication of Vols. 6-8 of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein (CPAE) has added an invaluable tool for all scholars working in this area. With the publication of this book I have tried to bring a balanced and inclusive synthesis of recent, related work, as I see it from my own point of view and from the point of view of my main topic of interest here: Hilbert and the Axiomatization of Physics. I have tried my best to indicate throughout the text those secondary sources on which I have directly relied when dealing with specific issues in the various chapters. Still, in a book of this kind there are many intellectual debts that cannot be acknowledged by means of footnotes, and which I’d like to point out here, while sincerely thanking to all those persons who have helped me in one way or another. Of great significance in the preparation of my work has been the continued cooperation and critical reading I have received from David Rowe at various stages. Likewise, his many publications on the Göttingen mathematical culture continually provided me with a highly reliable source of help and scholarly reference. During\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nmy year at the MPIWG-Berlin, and thereafter, I benefited very much from illuminating discussions on the history of modern physics with Jürgen Renn, Tilman Sauer and John Stachel. On different occasions, many other friends and colleagues have read and criticized diverse parts of my manuscript, provided useful hints and information, or simply answered specific queries I directed at them. Their remarks and suggestions led to many additions, changes and improvements for which I am very thankful: Klaus Bärwinkel, Jed Buchwald, Juan B. Climent, Olivier Darrigol, Michael Eckert, Moritz Epple, José Ferreirós, Albrecht Fölsing, Helene Gispert, Jeremy Gray, Ulf Hashagen, Erwin Hiebert, Tom Hawkins, Michel Janssen, Shaul Katzir, Ole Knudsen, Daniel Levy, Jesper Lützen, Ulrich Majer, Paolo Mancosu, John Norton, Don Osterbrock, Walter Purkert, Jim Ritter, Laura Rodriguez, Richard Staley, Hans-Jürgen Schmidt, George Smith, Arne Schirrmacher, Erhard Scholz, Hans-Joachim Vollrath, Scott Walter. I also acknowledge the significant input received from an anonymous referee in the form of critical remarks to an earlier manuscript of this book. If, in spite of the great help provided by all these learned persons and good friends, my book still contains errors or shortcomings, these should be attributed, as usual, only to me. I have also received invaluable help from several institutions and organizations with which I have been in contact over these years. The Cohn Institute, through the congenial and sustained support of Barbara and Bert Cohn, has always provided a warm academic home from which to pursue my own scholarly interests without losing sight of a broader intellectual picture. I thank all my colleagues at the institute for their continued encouragement and interest, and especially Naomi Diamant for her always efficient and gracious handling of the institute’s office matters, without which we could not even start to function. During my stay at the MPIWG-Berlin and thereafter, the library staff, headed by Urs Schoepfflin, and especially with the help of Urte Brauckmann and Matthias Schwerdt, spared no effort in helping me gather published and unpublished material that proved essential for conducting my work. Lindy Divarci, also at the MPIWGBerlin, has provided me sustained support on editorial matters. The difficult task of inspecting the manuscripts of Hilbert’s courses and the letters in his Nachlass at Göttingen was much alleviated by the kind help of Helmut Rohlfing (Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen - Handschriftenabteilung) and Jürgen Matthes (Bibliothek des Mathematisches Institut). Klaus and Friedrich Mie kindly put at my disposition the Nachlass of their granduncle Gustav Mie, which I was able to track with the help of Professor Helmut Spehl, at Freiburg. Although I do not quote directly from any specific document of that interesting collection, the possibility of examining its contents was very helpful for understanding the spirit of Mie’s work. They also provided me with a portrait of Gustav Mie in their possession, and allowed its publication. I thank them very much for their help and openness. In collecting the pictures that appear in this book and in preparing their electronic versions, I received the important assistance of Barbara Wolff (Albert Einstein Archives, Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem), Helmut Rohlfing and Martin Liebetruth (Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen),\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nHeather Lindsay (American Institue of Physics), and Margrit Prussat (Deutsches Museum, Munich). This book is published in the ARCHIMEDES series mainly due to the active interest taken in it by the editor of the series, Jed Z. Buchwald, an interest for which I am sincerely thankful. I acknowledge the administrative and editorial support provided by Ingrid Krabbenbos and Charles Erkelens at Kluwer, as well as the technical advise of the author support team for preparing the camera ready copy. The English prose of my text has been considerably improved through the sympathetic, and always professional, services of Miriam Greenfield. Difficulties encountered while reading and translating certain, intricate German manuscript passages were alleviated at various occasions through the friendly help of Alexandre Métraux and of Moritz Epple. Of the various primary sources quoted in the book, many have never appeared in print at the time of writing these lines, to the best of my knowledge. Such sources are fully quoted in the German original in the footnotes and in English translation in the main text. Unless otherwise stated in the text, all translations into English (of either published or unpublished texts) are mine. In the case of Einstein’s published works and correspondence I have used translations now available in the English version of the Collected Papers, which I cite accordingly. My final and warmest thanks go to my most faithful fan-club: my dear wife, Efrat, my children Daniel and Avigail, and the other members of the family - mother, brother, sister, and their cohorts. I hope to have stood up to their very high, and perhaps somewhat unfounded, expectations. Tel-Aviv, April 2004\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CREDITS\n\nOriginal manuscripts are quoted in the book by permission of the following institutions: x Nachlass David Hilbert: Niedersaechsische Staatsund Universitätsbibliothek Goettingen, Abteilung Handschriften und Seltene Drucke. x Lecture Notes, David Hilbert: Bibliothek des Mathematisches Institut, Universität Göttingen. x Nachlass Max Born, Nachlass Erich Hückel, Nachlass Ruge – DuBoisReymond, Nachlass Johannes Stark: Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz. Special thanks I owe to Peter Damerow for allowing me to quote from the manuscript of Hilbert’s lectures on axiomatization (Hilbert 1913c), belonging to his private collection. Some of the important letters quoted in the book were recovered only recently for the Hilbert Nachlass in Göttingen, through the important efforts of Klaus Sommer (cf. Sommer 2002). Some of the material published throughout the book had appeared earlier in scattered publications, and it has been brought here with varying degrees of modification, ranging from slight editorial or language changes to total reformulation.

Wir werden wissen.1\n\nIn 1900, at a time when his international prominence as a leading mathematician was just becoming firmly established, David Hilbert (1862-1943) delivered one of the central invited lectures at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Paris. The lecture bore the title “Mathematical Problems”. At this very significant opportunity, Hilbert attempted to “lift the veil” and peer into the development of mathematics in the century that was about to begin. He chose to present a list of twenty-three problems that in his opinion would and should occupy the efforts of mathematicians in the years to come. This famous list has been an object of mathematical and historical interest ever since. Mathematicians of all specialties and in all countries have taken up its challenges. Solving an item from the list came to be considered a significant achievement that could determine the fate of the academic career of any aspiring mathematician. The sixth problem of the list deals with the axiomatization of physics. It was suggested to Hilbert by his own recent research on the foundations of geometry. He thus proposed “to treat in the same manner, by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an important part.” This problem differs from most others on Hilbert’s list in essential ways,2 and its inclusion has been the object of noticeable reaction from mathematicians and historians who have discussed it throughout the years. Thus, in reports occasionally written about the current state of research on the twenty-three problems, the special status of the sixth problem is readily visible: not only has it been hard to decide to what extent the problem was actually solved (or not), but one gets the impression that, of all the problems on the list, this one received the least attention from mathematicians throughout the century and that relatively little effort was directed at solving it.3 In one recent, very detailed account aimed at presenting an up-to-date picture of the developments in twentiethcentury mathematics prompted by the list, the sixth problem receives only very cursory attention, and the general attitude to it is summarized in the sentence: “It would seem that Hilbert overreached here.”4 The name of Hilbert is associated with physics in some other contexts as well. Traditionally, however, a rather cavalier attitude towards his involvement with physical topics in general, very much as with the sixth problem, is evident in 1\n\nHilbert 1930 (“We must know. We will know.”) This issue is discussed in greater detail below in § 2.3.2. 3 Cf. Wightman 1976, Gnedenko 1979. 4 Yandell 2002, 159. 2\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nexisting accounts written by mathematicians, physicists and historians of science alike. A most salient case in point concerns the solution of the Boltzmann equation in kinetic theory of gases in 1912, a period when most of Hilbert’s energies were directed toward his work on the theory of linear integral equations. In his authoritative account of the development of kinetic theory, Stephen G. Brush dedicated one short section to describing Hilbert’s contribution. Brush’s assessment of Hilbert’s motivations is expressed in the following passage: When Hilbert decided to include a chapter on kinetic theory in his treatise on integral equations, it does not appear that he had any particular interest in the physical problems associated with gases. He did not try to make any detailed calculations of gas properties, and did not discuss the basic issues such as the nature of irreversibility and the validity of mechanical interpretations which had exercised the mathematician Ernst Zermelo in his debate with Boltzmann in 1896-97. A few years later, when Hilbert presented his views on the contemporary problems of physics, he did not even mention kinetic theory. We must therefore conclude that he was simply looking for another possible application of his mathematical theories, and when he had succeeded in finding and characterizing a special class of solutions (later called “normal”) ... his interest in the Boltzmann 5 equation and in kinetic theory was exhausted. (Brush 1976, 448)\n\nBrush added that Hilbert did encourage some of his students to work on mathematical problems connected with the theory, and that he seems to have also taught courses on this issue. Yet these qualifications did not change Brush’s overall evaluation of Hilbert’s motivations. Although solving the Boltzmann equation represented a major contribution to the development of this particular physical discipline, Hilbert was nevertheless considered to have had no real interest in the kinetic theory as such. Rather, his solution of the equation was considered an isolated and sporadic, if important, incursion into this field. Another important physical context where Hilbert’s name has been prominently mentioned concerns the formulation of the gravitational field-equations in the general theory of relativity (GTR). On November 20, 1915, Hilbert presented to the Royal Scientific Society in Göttingen his version of the equations, in the framework of what he saw as an axiomatically formulated foundation for the whole of physics. During that same month of November, Einstein had been struggling with the final stages of his own effort to formulate the generally covariant equations that lie at the heart of GTR. His struggle had spanned at least three years of intense effort and included the publication of several previous versions, each of which Einstein eventually found to be inadequate for different reasons. It was only in November of 1915 that he presented three different versions at the weekly meetings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, before attaining his final version, on November 25, that is, five days after Hilbert had presented his own version. Einstein had visited Göttingen in the summer of 1915 to lecture on the progress and the difficulties encountered in his work. Hilbert was then in the audience and Einstein was greatly impressed by him. Earlier accounts of Hilbert’s involvement with problems associated with GTR had in general traced it back to this visit of Einstein or, at the earliest, the years immediately preceding it. As in the case of kinetic theory, this contribution of Hilbert was often seen as a more or less furtive 5\n\nA similar conclusion is implied in Cercignani 1998, 223.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nincursion into physics, aimed at illustrating the power and the scope of validity of the “axiomatic method” and as a test of Hilbert’s mathematical abilities while trying to “jump onto the bandwagon of success” of Einstein’s theory. In biographical accounts of Hilbert, his lively interest in physics has never been overlooked, to be sure, yet it has been presented within rather circumscribed frameworks, be it time-wise or subject-wise. This is the case, for instance, in Constance Reid’s famous book on Hilbert6 as well as in the short account written by Hilbert’s first doctoral student Otto Blumenthal.7 But perhaps the most salient instance of this demarcation appears in the obituary written by Hermann Weyl, one of Hilbert’s most prominent pupils. In a passage that has been quoted repeatedly, Weyl asserted that Hilbert’s work comprised five separate, and clearly discernible main periods: (1) Theory of invariants (1885-1893); (2) Theory of algebraic number fields (1893-1898); (3) Foundations, (a) of geometry (1898-1902), (b) of mathematics in general (1922-1930); (4) Integral equations (1902-1912); (5) Physics (1910-1922).8 Weyl’s account implies that the passage from any of these fields to the next was always clear-cut and irreversible, and a cursory examination of Hilbert’s published works may confirm this impression. But as Weyl himself probably knew better than many, the list of Hilbert’s publications provides only a partial, rather one-sided perspective of his intellectual horizons, and this is particularly the case when it comes to his activities related to physics. The main aim of this book is to present a broader picture of the scope of Hilbert’s involvement with physical issues and to show in detail the extent to which this involvement spanned most of his active scientific life. Hilbert’s interest in physics was an integral part of his mathematical world, and the latter cannot be understood without reference to the former. This is particularly the case concerning the famous “axiomatic approach”, a term that has come to be fully identified with Hilbert’s mathematical achievements and with his pervasive influence on twentiethcentury mathematics. A main claim of this book will be that Hilbert’s axiomatic approach arose from his early involvement not only with the foundations of geometry, but also, to a considerable extent, with the foundations of physics. Moreover, my account is meant to show that a thorough understanding of Hilbert’s conceptions in this regard cannot be attained unless his activities in physics are accorded a very prominent place. Thus, the sixth problem in the 1900 list and the involvement with kinetic theory are seen as a natural outgrowth of the development of Hilbert’s world of ideas, and by no means as sporadic, isolated incursions into unknown territories. Likewise, Hilbert’s dealings with GTR represent one of the most salient milestones in this natural development. Finally, my account will focus on the significant and unique contribution of Hilbert to certain important developments in twentieth-century physics. To get a balanced understanding of the role of physics within Hilbert’s intellectual world, we need to closely examine not only his publications, but also the complex academic network of personal interactions and diverse activities that he 6\n\nReid 1970. Blumenthal 1922. 8 Weyl 1944, 619. 7\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwas continually part of. Especially worthy of attention for this account will be his teaching, first at Königsberg and more important at Göttingen, beginning in 1895. Hilbert directed no less than sixty-eight doctoral dissertations, sixty of them in the relatively short period between 1898 and 1914. As is well known, at the mathematical institute established in Göttingen by Felix Klein, Hilbert became the leader of a unique scientific center that brought together a gallery of world-class researchers in mathematics and physics. One cannot exaggerate the significance of the influence exerted by Hilbert’s thought and personality on all who came out of this institution. Fortunately, we can document with relatively great accuracy the contents of Hilbert’s Göttingen lectures, which illuminate the evolution of his ideas on many issues. More often than not, these lectures were far from systematic and organized presentations of well-known results and established theories. Rather, Hilbert often used his lectures as an open stage where he could explore new ideas and think aloud about the issues that currently occupied his mind. In a lecture held in commemorating his seventieth birthday, Hilbert vividly recalled how these lectures provided important occasions for the free exploration of yet untried ideas. He thus said: The closest conceivable connection between research and teaching became a decisive feature of my mathematical activity. The interchange of scientific ideas, the communication of what one found by himself and the elaboration of what one had heard, was from my early years at Königsberg a pivotal aspect of my scientific work. ... In my lectures, and above all in the seminars, my guiding principle was not to present material in a standard and as smooth as possible way, just to help the student keep clean and ordered notebooks. Above all, I always tried to illuminate the problems and difficulties and to offer a bridge leading to currently open questions. It often happened that in the course of a semester the program of an advanced lecture was completely changed, because I wanted to discuss issues in which I was currently involved as a researcher and which had not yet by any means attained their definite formulation. (Hilbert 1971, 79)\n\nFollowing a tradition initiated by Klein, lecture notes of courses taught at the mathematical institute in Göttingen were made available to all students who wished to consult them at the Lesezimmer. At least since 1902, in every course he taught, Hilbert chose a student to take notes during the lectures. The student was expected to write up these notes coherently, whereupon Hilbert would often revise them, sometimes adding his own corrections and remarks.9 Today the collection of these notes offers an invaluable source for the historian interested in understanding Hilbert’s scientific horizon and his contributions. Of course one must be careful not to identify every detail in the text of the notes with what was actually said in the lectures by Hilbert himself. But having that qualification in mind, it will be seen throughout this book that the list of Hilbert’s lectures during those years present a much more complex picture of Hilbert’s career than Weyl’s periodization suggests. In particular, it will be seen that Hilbert’s concern with the physical sciences was sustained and diverse, a fact that can be unmistakably documented throughout his carrer.\n\n9\n\nSee Born 1978, 81-85, for a retrospective account of his experience as Hilbert’s student.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFigure 1. David Hilbert (1862-1943)\n\n5\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs already said, a main focal point in this account concerns Hilbert’s axiomatic approach. Until recently it had been common to identify Hilbert’s name with the formalist approach to the foundations of mathematics and, by extension, to mathematics at large. Hilbert was seen as having promoted the view of mathematics as an empty formal game, in which inference rules are prescribed in advance, and deductions are drawn, following those rules, from arbitrarily given systems of postulates. Jean Dieudonné (1906-1992), for instance, presented such a view in a widely read expository article, where he explained the essence of Hilbert’s mathematical conceptions by analogy with a game of chess where one does not speak about truths but rather about following correctly a set of stipulated rules. If we translate this into mathematics, he said, we thus obtain the conception of Hilbert: “mathematics becomes a game, whose pieces are graphical signs that are distinguished from one another by their form.”10 But then, if this was indeed Hilbert’s view of mathematics, in what sense could he have intended to apply such a view to physics, as stated in the sixth problem? By clarifying his aims when addressing the question of the axiomatization of physics, I thus intend to clarify, more generally, the actual role Hilbert ascribed to axiomatization in mathematics and in science in general (especially physics), and how he conceived the relation between mathematics and physics. This book comprises nine chapters. Chapter 1 describes the nineteenth-century background to some of the main topics discussed in later sections. I start with a brief description of Hilbert’s early career, and then move on to describe the main trends in the foundations of geometry and the foundations of physics in the last third of the century, as well as the current academic activities in mathematics and physics in Göttingen at the time of Hilbert’s arrival, in 1895. This background allows a clearer understanding of the topics discussed in Chapter 2, which opens with a detailed account of how the axiomatic approach was gradually consolidated over the last decade of the century in Hilbert’s early lectures on geometry and physics. The other sections in this chapter describe the aims and scope of Hilbert’s Grundlagen der Geometrie—which comprises his first full-fledged implementation of the axiomatic approach—and the earliest reactions to this book and the views manifest in it. The main point that I stress here is that in Hilbert’s conception geometry was an empirical, rather than a formal science. Thus I emphasize the analogies that Hilbert drew between geometry and the physical sciences. His axiomatic approach is presented as an endeavor with little connection to the view of mathematical theories as empty formal games, devoid of concrete content. Rather, it appears as the opposite: as a method for enhancing our understanding of the mathematical content of theories and for excluding possible contradictions or superfluous assertions that may appear in them. Thus, the discussion of the 1900 list of problems against the background of the preceding sections is meant as a broad account of the historical context within which the sixth problem is to be understood. At the same time it also helps explain how the ideas behind the sixth problem afforded a starting point for many of Hilbert’s later activities in physics. 10\n\nDieudonné 1962, 551 (italics in the original). This topic is discussed in greater detail in Corry 1997.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nThe main focus of attention in the next three chapters is directed toward the early implementation of the above mentioned ideas in the actual treatment of specific physical theories. Thus, Chapter 3 deals with the period of time between 1900 and 1905. Hilbert was involved then with questions pertaining to the foundations of geometry and arithmetic as well as of physics, always within a strongly empiricist point of view. At the same time, the arrival of his good friend Minkowski in 1902 also marks the start of an intense, joint collaboration around pure mathematical, but also physical questions. The high point of these developments, according to my account, is found in a course taught by Hilbert in 1905 on the axiomatic method. A considerable part of this course was devoted to the axiomatization of physical theories. Thus a detailed examination of the topics discussed in this course presents us with the first elaborate instance of the axiomatization program for physics in action. This is the earliest evidence of the full scope of ideas that Hilbert had in mind when he spoke of the axiomatization of physical theories, and it turns out to be surprisingly broad, detailed and well-informed. Chapter 4 deals with Minkowski’s activities in electrodynamics and the principle of relativity between 1907 and his unexpected death in early 1909. My main claim is that these activities are best understood against the background of Hilbert’s axiomatization program. This account sheds new light on the meaning of Minkowski’s contribution and at the same time brings to the fore a very important, early implementation of the ideas behind Hilbert’s program. In spite of the long-term friendship and the well-known collaboration between Minkowski and Hilbert, the fact that they both played noticeable roles in the history of the special and general theories of relativity respectively has not been stressed, or even mentioned by historians of science. I claim that this fact is far more than a mere coincidence and my analysis is meant to show this in detail. Chapter 5 deals with Hilbert’s physical activities in 1909-1914, which revolved around kinetic theory, radiation theory and the question of the structure of matter. A main issue of interest that is found in the background of all these activities is the major change that affected Hilbert’s views on the foundations of physics leading him away from his earlier, strong support of mechanical reductionism and into an increasingly pure electromagnetic conception of nature. Electromagnetic reductionism was to become the basis of Hilbert’s approach to physics after 1913 and, in particular, it would underlie and actually guide his work on GTR in 1915. The fundamental change that influenced Hilbert’s views has previously received little, if any, attention in existing accounts of his works; however, it is prominently highlighted by evidence found in archival material and particularly in the successive physical courses taught over this period of time. The next three chapters are specifically devoted to Hilbert’s involvement with GTR. In his communication of November 1915 Hilbert presented a unified theory of electromagnetism and gravitation, based on the use of a variational principle and allegedly derived in a fully axiomatic fashion from two principles: the demand of general invariance stemming from Einstein’s work, and “Mie’s axiom of the worldfunction” as a basis for describing the structure of matter. In Chapter 6 I present the background to Hilbert’s theory by describing the two pillars on which it was based: (1) the recent works of Einstein, as part of his efforts to generalize the principle of\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nrelativity to include gravitational phenomena, and (2) the electromagnetic theory of matter devised by Gustav Mie. Chapter 7 describes the events immediately preceding the formulation of the gravitational field equations by both Einstein and Hilbert. It includes a discussion of Einstein’s visit in Göttingen in the summer of 1915, an account of the principles and structure of Hilbert’s theory and its various early versions, a description of the Einstein-Hilbert correspondence over the month of November 1915 and Einstein’s four communications to the Berlin Academy. Using recently found archival material, I have tried to reconstruct a many-sided, balanced version of these events, sorting out the specific contributions made by each person involved. Chapter 8 discusses the developments following the events of November 1915: the reactions of physicists (including Einstein), Hilbert’s lectures in 1916-17 and his second communication on GTR, and the activities of his Göttingen colleagues on related issues. Chapter 9 is in fact an epilogue that ties up the several threads that were introduced and intermittently discussed in various chapters of the book. In the first place I give a very brief overview of the seminal activities in quantum mechanics at Göttingen in the 1920s, and of Hilbert’s direct involvement with them. An axiomatic analysis of the mathematical foundations of the theory, published under the name of Hilbert together with two younger collaborators (Nordheim and Von Neumann), would be the last of Hilbert’s published works on physical issues. Thus this section brings the entire story to a close. In the framework of these activities and most of the other episodes discussed throughout the book, a key concept that arises when trying to characterize the peculiar Göttingen scientific culture, and Hilbert’s work within it, is subsumed under the term “nostrification” (nostrifizierung). Thus, for instance, following the publication of Hilbert’s unified theory, Einstein had complained that his Göttingen colleague had “nostrified” his ideas. In a separate section of the epilogue, I summarize the discussion of this concept as a way to provide additional clarification of some of the events discussed earlier in the book, including the Hilbert-Einstein “priority dispute” surrounding the formulation of the correct field equations. A separate section is devoted to an overview of Hilbert’s conceptions of the nature of geometry and its connections with other empirical sciences. The rise of GTR and the deep impact it had on Hilbert also influenced these conceptions in significant ways which I discuss here. Before the concluding remarks, I give an overview of the historical accounts of the initial stages of GTR and of Hilbert’s contributions to it, as written by his contemporaries. These “participant histories” contributed largely to shaping the conceptions that were dominant for many years to come, which, in some cases, my book is meant to clarify or reinterpret. Legends about Hilbert abound, many of which have been gathered and passed on to us in Constance Reid’s sympathetic portrait of the man and the scientist. One of the most frequently repeated among these legends attributes to Hilbert the claim that “physics is much too hard for physicists”.11 Whether or not Hilbert actually ever made such a claim, he surely thought that physics was at least difficult enough to 11\n\nReid 1970, 127. No first-hand quotation of this claim, however, seems to exist. One possible, contemporary hearsay testimony appears in a letter of Max Abraham to Tullio Levi-Civita, dated August 1, 1917, and quoted in Cattani & De Maria 1989a, 172.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nmerit investing so much of his precious time in its study, and in probably also making a valuable contribution to some of its branches. More important, he thought that mathematics would largely benefit from active interaction with physical disciplines, and that at bottom “the separation of the sciences into professions and faculties is an anthropological one, and it is thus foreign to reality as such. For a natural phenomenon does not ask about itself whether it is the business of a physicist or of a mathematician.”12 It is in this spirit that the account presented in the chapters of this book is to be understood.\n\n12\n\nHilbert 1916-17, 2-3. Cf. also below Ch. 8, note 72.\n\nCHAPTER 1 LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BACKGROUND\n\nYou are the man whom I need as my scientific complement: due to the direction of your work, the power of your mathematical thinking, 1 and the fact that you now stand in the middle of your productive career.\n\nHilbert’s first published, comprehensive presentation of an axiomatized mathematical discipline appeared in June of 1899, in the epoch-making Grundlagen der Geometrie (GdG). Based on a course taught in the winter semester of 1898-99, GdG was published as part of a Festschrift issued in Göttingen to celebrate the inauguration of a monument to honor two of its legendary scientists: Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Wilhelm Weber (1804-1891). Hilbert had been teaching courses on topics related to geometry and its foundations since 1891. Nevertheless, the conception and the results embodied in GdG signified a real innovation that was to make a deep impact on geometry and, indeed, on the whole of mathematics for decades to come. Like most of Hilbert’s early important works, this one had deep roots in central developments of the classical theories that thrived in the nineteenth century. In order to understand those roots and the actual historical significance of GdG, the present chapter is devoted to describing in some detail the relevant background related to those developments. It comprises four main themes, all of them spanning the late nineteenth century: Hilbert’s early career (§ 1.1), foundations of geometry (§ 1.2), foundations of physics (§ 1.3), and mathematics and physics in Göttingen at the time Hilbert arrived there (§ 1.4). This account will also help stress a main thesis of this book, namely, that Hilbert’s urge to axiomatize physical theories, as well as his conception of how this actually should be done, arose simultaneously with the consolidation of his axiomatic treatment of geometry. Certainly to a lesser degree than geometry, but still in significant ways, Hilbert’s increasing interest in physics plays an important role in understanding the early evolution of his thoughts on the axiomatic method. 1.1. HILBERT’S EARLY CAREER In contrast with the remarkable scope and the diversity of his scientific interests, and contrary to the typical careers of contemporary German mathematicians and physicists, the external circumstances of Hilbert’s career were surprisingly static and uneventful. Whereas his brilliant career as a mature mathematician is entirely associated with the flourishing of Göttingen as a world-class center of the exact sciences, almost all of his studies and the early stages of his mathematical work 1\n\nFelix Klein to David Hilbert, December 6, 1894. (Frei (ed.) 1985, 115).\n\n11\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nbetween 1880 and 1895 took place in his native town of Königsberg. All, except for an early semester spent at Heidelberg and a short trip in 1885—after finishing his dissertation— that took him to Leipzig and Paris. It was in Leipzig that he first met Felix Klein (1849-1925), who was already a leading figure in German mathematics. Klein himself encouraged Hilbert to visit Paris where he would meet Charles Hermite (1822-1901), Henri Poincaré (1854-1912), Émile Picard (1856-1941), and others.2 Königsberg had a small university whose name was and has remained strongly associated with the towering figure of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). It also had a very respectable tradition of research and education in mathematics and physics, established during the first half of the nineteenth century by Carl Gustav Jacobi (1804-1851) and Franz Ernst Neumann (1798-1895)During his first years as a student, Hilbert attended the lectures of the distinguished mathematician Heinrich Weber (1842-1913), whose interests covered an astonishing variety of issues ranging from the theory of polynomial equations, to elliptic functions, to mathematical physics.3 Together with the Ordinarius Weber, who directed the mathematical seminar, two other Extraordinarien taught mathematics at the time in Königsberg: Johann Georg Rosenhain (1816-1887) and Louis Saalschütz (1835-1913).4 The congenial environment in Königsberg that Weber found suitable for pursuing his manifold mathematical interests—prior to his departure for Zurich in 1883—was also the environment where Hilbert’s early mathematical outlook was developed. Still, it must be stressed that Weber never developed a true circle of students around him, nor can be Hilbert directly counted as one of them. An interesting collection of Hilbert’s student notebooks has been preserved in his Nachlass at Göttingen. On reading them one gets a distinct impression of Hilbert as a very systematic and meticulous student, attentive to the details of every topic he pursued. Unfortunately the notebooks are undated and clearly they comprise only a small portion of the overall spectrum of courses Hilbert attended. Still, they allow a glimpse into the basics of his mathematical and scientific university education. The notebooks cover some classical, pure mathematical disciplines such as Dedekind’s theory of determinants of algebraic fields, differential equations, double-periodic functions, the hypergeometric series, theory of invariants, and also cylindrical and spherical functions.5 The notebooks of his physics courses include capillarity theory, electricity theory, kinetic theory of gases, potential theory, optics, and mechanics.6 By and large, however, the most detailed and lengthy of the notebooks is the one where Hilbert recorded a course based on the Lehrbuch der Experimentalphysik by Adolph Wüllner (1835-1908).7 Franz Neumann himself had frequently relied on this book in his introductory courses in physics in Königsberg since the 1870s, especially 2\n\nCf. Rowe 2003a. Cf. Corry 2003, §§ 1.2 & 2.2.4; Schappacher & Volkert 1991. DHN 504 contains the notes taken by Hilbert at a rather high-level course on number theory given by Weber in SS 1882. 4 Cf.

Hilbert very carefully wrote down his notes on the four volumes dealing respectively with mechanics and acoustics, the theory of light, the theory of heat, and magnetism and electricity.10 Thus, there can be no doubt that ever since his early days as a student in Königsberg, Hilbert’s scientific horizons encompassed a thorough knowledge of physics as currently taught in German universities. Later on in his own lectures on mechanics in Göttingen, Hilbert would enthusiastically refer to the introduction of Wüllner’s book for its plea to judge the degree of success of any science according to its ability to integrate mathematics.11 When the time came for the doctoral dissertation, Hilbert’s adviser was Ferdinand Lindemann (1852-1939), a former student of Klein, who is remembered today mostly for his proof of the transcendence of S. Lindemann’s mathematical achievements were not outstanding, but he certainly exerted an important influence on Hilbert’s mathematical formation. However, the foremost influence on shaping Hilbert’s intellectual horizon in Königsberg came from his extraordinary relationship with two other young mathematicians: Adolf Hurwitz (1859-1919), first Hilbert’s teacher and later his colleague, and Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909). Before coming in 1884 to Königsberg as extraordinarius, Hurwitz had studied in Leipzig with Klein, and then in Berlin, and in 1882 he habilitated in Göttingen. Hurwitz was thus well aware of the kind of mathematical interests and techniques dominating current research in each of these important centers. He taught for eight years in Königsberg before moving to Zurich. His influence during this time was decisive in shaping Hilbert’s very broad spectrum of mathematical interests, both as a student and as a young researcher.12 Minkowski’s mathematical genius became manifest at a very early age. Still as a high-school student, Minkowski made contact with Weber who immediately became strongly impressed by the young man’s outstanding number-theoretical talents.13 Once Minkowski enrolled the university in 1880 the two had frequent private discussions in which also Hilbert later took part.14 In 1882, Minkowski shared with Henry J.S Smith (1826-1883), a well-known Oxford number theorist, the “Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques” conceded by the Paris Academy for his paper on 8\n\nCf.

However, as Kragh 1999, 10, justly stresses in relation with physics textbooks around 1900: “Textbooks of this period usually rested on a mechanical basis and did not reflect the change in worldview discussed in frontier theoretical physics. This is how textbooks are: They are by nature conservative and cautious in their attitude towards new ideas.” 10 DHN 519. 11 For instance, in Hilbert 1905-06, 10. 12 Cf.

Minkowski then spent three semesters in Berlin before receiving his doctorate in Königsberg in 1885. He moved to Bonn where he got his Habilitation and remained until 1894 as Privatdozent,15 before returning to Königsberg for two more years. In 1895 Hilbert went to Göttingen, and the following year Minkowski moved to Zurich. Only in 1902 did the two friends reunite in Göttingen. Hilbert had been offered a position in Berlin that no other mathematician was likely to refuse. He preferred to use this offer as a threat of leaving Göttingen unless a position would also be arranged for his friend there. Klein thus succeeded in persuading the Prussian educational authorities to create a third chair of mathematics in his university especially for Minkowski.16\n\nFigure 2.

Hilbert 1910, 355.\n\nLATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BACKGROUND\n\n15\n\nThroughout the years, the friendship between Minkowski, Hurwitz, and Hilbert remained strong. While at Bonn, Minkowski visited Königsberg each summer, and the three mathematicians would meet for daily mathematical walks. During the Christmas holidays of 1890 Minkowski stayed at Bonn, and in a letter to Hilbert he described his current interest in physics. In his obituary of Minkowski, Hilbert reported—in an often-quoted passage—that Minkowski apologized for not coming, while adding: I do not know if I need to console you though, since I think that this time you would have found me thoroughly infected with physics. Perhaps I even would have had to pass a quarantine period before you and Hurwitz would have admitted me again, mathematically pure and unapplied, to your joint walks. … In order to have points in common with other mortals, I have surrendered myself to magic—that is to say, physics. I have my practical exercises at the physics institute, and at home I study Thomson, Helmholtz and their consorts. Starting next weekend, I’ll work some days every week in a blue smock in an institute that produces physical 17 instruments; this is a kind of practical training as shameful as you can imagine.\n\nBut Minkowski’s and Hilbert’s interest in physics can certainly be dated even earlier than that. After his arrival in Königsberg in 1884, Lindemann started a sort of colloquium with meetings taking place mainly at his home. Hilbert and Minkowski, together with Hurwitz, were invited to give talks, and, of course, also to listen. Two local physicists, about whom more will be said below, Woldemar Voigt (1850-1919) and Paul Volkmann (1856-1938), also lectured on topics such as optics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics.18 Hydrodynamics may have been a topic of early, common interest to Hilbert and Minkowski: Hilbert taught it back in 1887 at Königsberg,19 whereas Minkowski published an article, while at Bonn in 1888, that was submitted to the Berlin Academy by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894).20 During his Zurich years, Minkowski’s interest in physics remained alive, and so did his contact with Hilbert. From their correspondence we learn that Minkowski dedicated part of his efforts to mathematical physics, and in particular to thermodynamics.21 As will be seen below in Chapter 4, Minkowski’s years at Göttingen were intensively dedicated to physics as well. As a young teacher at Königsberg, Hilbert could not expect to have large audiences of students, a situation that would change dramatically after his move to Göttingen. Still, from the notes of his courses it is evident that he took great pains in preparing them, and that they covered a wide variety of topics, practically without repeating subjects during his nine years of teaching at his Alma Mater. The topics of these courses included: Galois theory, number theory, geometry in all its branches, invariant theory, function theory, potential theory, differential equations and 17\n\nMinkowski to Hilbert, December 20, 1890 (Rüdenberg & Zassenhaus (eds.) 1973, 39-40).

In the present section I want to focus more specifically on his research and published work during this early stage of his career.\n\nFigure 3. Hilbert in 1885\n\nLATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BACKGROUND 1.1.1\n\n17\n\nAlgebraic Invariants\n\nThe first stage of Hilbert’s research career—from 1885 to 1893—was clearly dominated by one discipline, which his dissertation had also dealt with, and which became Hilbert’s first mathematical specialty: the study of algebraic invariants. The theory of algebraic invariants was a most active field of research in the second half of the nineteenth century, having developed in England and in Germany from two different kinds of sources. Gauss’s work on binary quadratic forms, dating from the beginning of the century, contained the earliest observations on algebraic invariant phenomena. But it was only in 1845 that Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) and James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897) published the first works containing actual contributions to this field. Their works elaborated on ideas introduced earlier by George Boole (1815-1864), when studying Lagrange’s work on linear transformations of homogeneous polynomials.22 The second early source of the theory of algebraic invariants came from the geometrical research of Otto Hesse (1811-1874). This research triggered a line of development that led, beginning in 1849, to the first articles of Siegfried Aronhold (1819-1884) on invariants. Aronhold was followed in Germany by Rudolf Alfred Clebsch (1833-1872) and Paul Gordan (1837-1912).23 While the work of Cayley and Sylvester concentrated on developing algorithms for finding individual invariants of particular, given systems of forms, the symbolic techniques for calculating invariants, introduced by Aronhold and adopted by his followers of the German school, were more flexible than those of their British counterparts and allowed operating at a more abstract level.24 The most remarkable success attained through the application of these techniques was the proof of the socalled “finiteness theorem” for binary forms. This proof was published in 1868 by Gordan, the leading authority in the discipline for many years. Gordan proved that given any system of binary forms of arbitrary degree, a finite sub-system of it could be chosen, such that any invariant of the former may be written as a rational combination of forms of the latter. Using the symbolic approach, Gordan was also able to provide—through laborious calculations—“smallest possible systems of groundforms” for the case of binary forms of the fifth and sixth degrees.25 In the years following its publication, various limited generalizations of Gordan’s theorem were proved, and improved proofs of his original theorem were also given.26 At the same time, techniques for calculating invariants were significantly improved. Yet for many years the full generalization of Gordan’s theorem remained an open problem: 22\n\nCf. Crilly 1986; Parshall 1989, 158-162; Parshall & Rowe 1994, 67-68.

Detailed explanations of the basic concepts of invariant theory appear in Crilly 1986; Hilbert 1896; Weyl 1944, 618-624. A classic textbook on the issue is Study 1933. More recent expositions of the theory appear in Dieudonné & Carrell 1971; and Springer 1977. 24 For a detailed account of the differences between the English and the German schools of invariant theory, see Parshall 1989, 176-180. 25 Gordan 1868, 327. 26 Hilbert 1889; Mertens 1886. 23\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nto prove the existence of a finite basis for any system of invariants of any degree and with an arbitrary number of indeterminates. The achievement of such a generalization in 1888 was the first work that brought Hilbert international recognition.27 Hilbert’s doctoral dissertation, as well as his 1885 Inauguraldissertation, had been devoted to the research of invariant properties of particular algebraic forms using the standard methods of the discipline. His attack of the Gordan problem in 1888 involved much more than simply finding a solution for an open problem that was of great interest in this particular discipline of algebra. It implicitly asserted, as well, the legitimacy of a kind of argument theretofore generally avoided in mathematics: an argument of existence based on purely logical, rather than constructive, grounds—a reductio ad absurdum argument for proving existence. Without explicitly mentioning Georg Cantor (1845-1918) and his innovative theory of infinite sets, Hilbert was implicitly adopting the kind of controversial, transcendental assumptions that some contemporaries, especially Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891), received with difficulty and sometimes open hostility.28 Also Hilbert’s use of transfinite, non-constructive arguments in algebra raised strong reactions, at least at the beginning. Indeed, in 1890 Hilbert wrote a paper summarizing his original results and submitted it for publication in the Mathematische Annalen, whose editor was Klein. Klein considered it the most important paper on algebra ever submitted to that journal, but when he sent it to Gordan for refereeing he encountered a completely different attitude. The leading expert accused Hilbert of dealing with “theology” rather than mathematics, and in a letter to Klein dismissed the paper’s whole approach. Hilbert’s strongly assertive reaction must have greatly surprised Klein, coming as it did from a rather unknown, young mathematician. Hilbert made clear to Klein that he was by no means prepared to make the slightest change in his paper and implied that he would rather withdraw it from the Annalen.29 Hilbert enjoyed Klein’s continued support all along, and the paper was, in the final account, published in the journal. Gordan’s initial negative reaction soon changed, if only because already in 1892 Hilbert had produced a constructive proof of his finiteness theorem. In fact, in 1893 Gordan himself published a simplification of Hilbert’s proof,30 and, according to Klein’s account, he even ended up acknowledging that theology may even have some advantages.31 At any rate, it is clear that this early episode was the starting point for Hilbert’s fame in the mathematical community and served as a catalyst for Klein’s resolve to make every effort to have him as his ally at Göttingen. Hilbert’s next important paper, which appeared in 1893, contained the constructive techniques for describing explicitly those bases whose existence he had 27\n\nHilbert’s proof appeared first in Hilbert 1888-89, and in an improved version in Hilbert 1890.

But the paper was also meant as a synthesis of all his achievements in the domain of algebraic invariants and it was regarded as a paper that had reformulated the whole theory within a totally new framework: now the theory was directly subsumed under the theory of fields of algebraic functions, in a similar way as the theory of cyclotomic fields was nothing but a noteworthy example of the theory of fields of algebraic numbers.32 Worthy of special attention is the introductory section in which Hilbert enumerated five elementary, general, and rather abstract, properties satisfied by invariants. This list can be seen, in hindsight, as a kind of early axiomatic analysis of the kind Hilbert would develop fully later on. The first four properties mentioned by Hilbert were the following: (1) The invariants correspond to the transformations associated to a certain continuous group. (2) The invariants satisfy certain partial linear differential equations. (3) Every algebraic, and in particular every rational, function defined on arbitrarily many invariants, which is integral and homogeneous in the coefficients of the ground forms, is itself an invariant. (4) If the product of two integral functions of the coefficients of the ground forms is an 33 invariant, then also each of the factors is itself an invariant.\n\nCondition (3)—Hilbert wrote—expresses the fact that the complete system of invariants determines an algebraically closed domain of functions. Condition (4) implies that the usual factorization properties are valid in the domain of invariants, i.e., that every invariant can be represented in a unique way as a product of irreducible invariants. To these four, Hilbert added a fifth condition: (5) There exist a finite number of invariants, such that all other invariants may be expressed as rational integral combinations of them.\n\nHilbert raised at this point the question of the logical interdependence of these five conditions: which conditions are deducible from which? and which are individually valid for any system of functions? The examples considered in his earlier articles on invariants showed, for instance, that properties (2), (3) and (5) could be satisfied in a system for which (4) is not valid. Hilbert did not try to pursue in detail, neither here nor in later works, any consequences of this short discussion on the elementary mathematical facts that he identified as basic for the theory of invariants. Yet the very conception of the list, and its place at the beginning of this summary article on the results attained in his research, betray his awareness of the potential usefulness of such an analysis. The items chosen for the list and the short discussion following it illuminatingly foretell the kind of approach that Hilbert would wholeheartedly undertake some years later in his work on the foundations of geometry. Indeed, as we will see below, by this time Hilbert had already begun to lecture in Königsberg on the foundations of 32 33\n\nHilbert 1893, 287. Hilbert 1893, 288. Hilbert returned to this list, with a minor change, in the lecture read before the 1893 International Congress of Mathematics in Chicago. Cf. Hilbert 1896, 377.\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ngeometry, and to ponder, within this specific framework, about the possible role of axiomatic considerations as the correct approach to the study of the foundations of geometry. Hilbert himself was the first to assess the historical significance of his own work on invariant theory. In a review article read in his name at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) held in Chicago in 1893, Hilbert mentioned three clearly separated stages that, in his view, mathematical theories usually undergo in the course of their development: the naive, the formal, and the critical. In the case of invariant theory, Hilbert saw the works of Cayley and Sylvester as representing the naive stage, whereas the work of Gordan and of Clebsch represented for him the formal stage. As the only real instance of the critical stage in the theory of invariants, Hilbert counted, unsurprisingly perhaps, his own work.34 Beyond the purely personal aspect of this judgment, and although Hilbert did in no way hint at it, there is a strong and direct connection between this idea of a “critical” stage in the life of a theory and the axiomatic approach that he was soon to become interested in. This connection already surfaces in the list of five “axioms” for invariants mentioned above, but it will become much clearer when we discuss the initial stages of his axiomatic method. For Hilbert, the need to introduce this method arises precisely as a means to analyze already established theories, to criticize their basic assumptions, and to elucidate their logical deductive structure. 1.1.2\n\nAlgebraic Number Fields\n\nIn his 1893 article on invariants Hilbert claimed to have fulfilled all the major tasks of the discipline.35 Though not totally devoid of historical justification, this assessment may be judged today as somewhat exaggerated.36 At any rate, Hilbert took it rather seriously, since, after having announced in a letter to Klein in 1892 that he intended to quit research in invariant theory “for the foreseeable future”37 he moved to the new domain that would attract all of his research efforts between 1893 and 1899: the theory of algebraic number fields. Still, this passage from the first to the second domain of research did not actually signify a complete break with the past, both because he had already lectured on number theory in Königsberg, and, 34\n\nHilbert 1896, 383. Hilbert 1893, 344. 36 For various assessments of Hilbert’s work on invariants see Parshall 1990, 11 ff.; Weyl 1939, 27-29; 1944, 627. 37 Hilbert to Klein, September 14, 1892 (Frei (ed.) 1985, Doc. 71). According to an oft-quoted assertion of Blumenthal (1935, 395), Hilbert wrote a letter in the same spirit to Minkowski in 1892. Such a letter, however, has apparently not been preserved, and in particular it is not included in Rüdenberg & Zassenhaus (eds.) 1973. Hilbert published no further articles on invariants, but he maintained an occasional interest in the topic. DHN 520 registers among Hilbert’s courses in Göttingen only two on invariants: one in 1897 and a second one, somewhat surprisingly, as late as WS 1929-30. From all the 68 dissertations he directed in Göttingen, only two dealt with invariants (cf. HGA Vol. 3, 431). One was completed by Sophus Marxsen in 1900 and the second one was submitted in 1909 by Andreas Speiser (1885-1970) . Occasionally Hilbert also discussed recent research on invariants at the meetings of the GMG. One such presentation is recorded as late as December 3, 1913 (cf. JDMV 22 (1913), 27). 35\n\nLATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BACKGROUND\n\n21\n\nmore importantly, because in his research on invariants he had applied techniques originally developed for dealing with algebraic number fields. In fact, as will be seen in the forthcoming chapters, the algebraic spirit of Hilbert’s early investigations in invariant theory continued to permeate his work in apparently distant fields, including the theory of integral equations. The systematic study of the factorization properties of algebraic numbers began in the early nineteenth century with the work of Gauss on the so-called Gaussian integers. A major milestone in this domain was embodied in the work Edward Ernst Kummer (1810-1893), with the creation of his theory of ideal prime numbers, beginning in 1847. Using this theory, Kummer was able to generalize the unique prime factorization theorem to domains of cyclotomic integers. Full generalizations of his ideas, valid in any domain of algebraic numbers, were independently worked out by Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) and by Kronecker, starting in the 1860s. With their theories of ideals and of divisors respectively, the theory of algebraic numbers reached its nineteenth-century peak. These two mathematicians had approached the same problem from different perspectives. Dedekind’s approach was much more conceptual, while Kronecker’s was more algorithmic.38 When Hilbert began working on the theory of algebraic number fields, the techniques and concepts developed by Dedekind and Kronecker on ideal factorization were not yet commonly known or standardly used by mathematicians at large. This was partly a consequence of the novel, idiosyncratic approaches adopted by each of these mathematicians in their separate works on the subject, and partly a consequence of their intrinsic difficulty. Otto Blumenthal (1876-1944) reported that, while describing the number-theoretical discussions with his friend Hurwitz, Hilbert used to say: “One of us preferred Kronecker’s proof of the unique prime factorization theorem, whereas the other preferred that of Dedekind, and we found both of them horrible (scheußlich).”39 Hilbert may have also had similar conversations with Minkowski, for whom number theory had always been at the center of mathematical interest. Thus, when in 1893 Hilbert and Minkowski were commissioned by the Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung (DMV) to write a systematic and comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in number theory for the needs of the general mathematical audience, this was a clear sign that Hilbert was recognized as an authority in the field, alongside his already respected friend. Since its inception, the DMV undertook, as one of its declared aims, publication of such surveys on various central fields of mathematics.40 In its early years, other published surveys covered the theory of algebraic functions,41 the then emerging field of set theory,42 and the calculus of probabilities.43 According to the initial plan for the survey on number theory, Minkowski would concentrate on the theory of rational integers, whereas Hilbert was expected to summarize the results produced 38\n\nCf. Corry 2003, Ch. 2; Edwards 1975, 1977, 1980, 1987. Cf. Blumenthal 1935, 397. 40 JDMV 1 (1891), 12. 41 Noether & Brill 1892-3. 42 Schoenflies 1900. 43 Czuber 1899. 39\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nby Kummer, Dedekind, and Kronecker for fields of algebraic numbers. However, as Minkowski became increasingly busy working on his own book on the geometry of numbers and eventually decided to abandon the project, at the end it was only Hilbert’s part that appeared in 1897.44 Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, as it came to be known, was not a survey in the usual sense of the term. For one thing, typical of Hilbert’s writings, his survey had nothing of the historical character of other reports published by the DMV. Hilbert produced an impressive and exhaustive systematization of the existing results of the discipline, and, moreover, he also added many important new results of his own. In fact, while he was careful to mention the names of his predecessors in relation to the results discussed, Hilbert completely reformulated these results in his own terms. Minkowski immediately grasped this dimension of Hilbert’s piece and wrote to him: “I am extraordinarily pleased with your report in its terse and yet complete form. It will certainly generally meet with great acclaim, and push the works of Kronecker and Dedekind very much into the background.”45 Still, Hilbert’s presentation was much closer to Dedekind than to Kronecker, in that it followed the “conceptual” approach of the former, rather than the “algorithmic” one of the latter. Since the Zahlbericht became the standard reference text for mathematicians working in algebraic number theory,46 the publication of this survey turned out to be a decisive factor for the subsequent dominance of Dedekind’s perspective over that of Kronecker within the discipline. Hilbert himself was clearly aware of the weight of the “conceptual” approach within his work, and thus, in the introduction he wrote: It is clear that the theory of [cyclotomic] fields represents the highest peak reached on the mountain of today’s knowledge of arithmetic; from it we look out on the wide panorama of the whole explored domain since almost all essential ideas and concepts of field theory, at least in a special setting, find an application in the proof of the higher reciprocity laws. I have tried to avoid Kummer’s elaborate computational machinery, so that here too Riemann’s principle may be realised and the proofs completed not by 47 calculation but purely by idea.\n\nIt was natural for Hilbert to mention Riemann in this context, but characterizing the approach in these terms could apply to the same extent to other representatives of the Göttingen tradition as well. Minkowski, for instance, would later associate such an approach with the name of Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859), by alluding to the well-known “Dirichlet Principle” in analysis. He spoke of “the other 44\n\nMinkowski’s letters to Hilbert during these years contain many references to Minkowski’s work on his planned section of the Zahlbericht and on his own book. Cf.

Interestingly, he also hinted that this connecting thread would extend as well into his next field of research: the foundations of geometry. He thus wrote: The conclusion, if I am not mistaken, is that above all the modern development of pure mathematics takes place under the banner of number: the Dedekind and Kronecker definitions of the fundamental concepts of arithmetic and Cantor’s general construction of the concept of number lead to an arithmetization of function theory and serve to realize the principle that even in function theory a fact can count as proved only when in the last resort it is reduced to relations between rational integers. The arithmetization of geometry is accomplished by the modern investigations in non-Euclidean geometry in which it is a question of a strictly logical construction of the subject and the most direct possible and completely satisfactory introduction of number into geometry. (Hilbert 1998, ix)\n\nThe Zahlbericht was Hilbert’s last lengthy publication before GdG. Together with his other important contributions to algebraic number theory,49 it constituted a synthesis of the discipline, of scope and influence on future developments comparable only to those of Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae about a century before. In this sense one could consider the Zahlbericht as embodying the “critical” stage of this chapter in the history of the theory of numbers, very much as Hilbert had previously seen his contribution in the framework of the theory of invariants. The “conceptual” approach he followed was central in carrying out this task, and at the same time it clearly helped understanding the architectonic essence of the theory. Certainly this work also contributed to consolidating Hilbert’s already growing prominence within the German mathematical community. 1.1.3\n\nDeep Roots in Tradition\n\nThe account of Hilbert’s contribution thus far may suffice to bring to the fore some central traits of his scientific personality and of his early approach to mathematics in general. One feature that is immediately manifest can be summarized by quoting Blumenthal again: In the analysis of mathematical talent one has to differentiate between the ability to create new concepts and generate new types of thought structures and the gift for sensing deeper connections and underlying unity. In Hilbert’s case, his greatness lies in an immensely powerful insight that penetrates into the depths of a question. … Insofar as the creation of new ideas is concerned, I would place Minkowski higher, and of the classical ones, Gauss, Galois, and Riemann. But when it comes to penetrating insight, 50 only a few of the very greatest were the equal of Hilbert. (Blumenthal 1935, 429)\n\n48\n\nCf. Minkowski 1905, 162-163. Of special significance and greatest influence were Hilbert 1898; idem, 1899a. See Hasse 1932. 50 English translation quoted from Rowe 1994, 190. 49\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n“Depth and underlying connections”, then, was a main motto of Hilbert’s overall contribution to mathematics. This passage was written, of course, after Hilbert’s retirement and with his whole career in the background. It is striking, however, that his early works already clearly manifest this ability to visualize the current state of a whole field in mathematics and to completely reorganize the knowledge accumulated in it, by stressing its architectonic principles, while at the same time establishing clear connections with other fields. In addition, the axiomatic approach he had just begun to develop by this time was one important way to give a concrete, even if partial, expression to this peculiar talent. Hilbert’s approach thus implied a strong reliance on existing works, and hence on ideas introduced by his predecessors, rather than primarily on his own innovative ones. Still, one should not assume that Hilbert always found his way to these ideas by thoroughly reading all the existing literature on a given topic. Usually, it would be enough to have an idea roughly conveyed to him either by a colleague or by a casual reading, and Hilbert would then find the way to elaborate the details on his own, and often, in fact, to pursue it well beyond the context within which its originator had conceived it. Hilbert’s attitude is nicely epitomized in another text of Blumenthal, written for the occasion of the master’s sixtieth birthday. While working on his dissertation, Blumenthal came to tell Hilbert about his concern for having found that some of the important results he had achieved had already been published in the literature. To this Hilbert calmly replied: “But why do you know so much literature?”51 More generally, Hilbert’s strong reliance on ideas formerly introduced by others did not make him a particularly historically oriented mathematician. The opposite was rather the case. David Rowe has described this attitude concisely: Hilbert had no need for heroes. In contrast with Klein, he was an utterly ahistorical thinker who measured the quality of a mathematician’s work by the number of earlier investigations it rendered obsolete. The achievements of Kummer and Kronecker are practically unrecognizable in Hilbert’s Zahlbericht. This uncharitable attitude towards one’s forerunners apparently had nothing malicious about it; Hilbert just was not capable of nor interested in seeing things from anything other than his own point of view. (Rowe 1994, 192).\n\nWhether malicious or not, as pointed out here by Rowe, this is an attitude that we will meet again several times later in this book, and will attract our attention. Again, it is remarkable that this attitude is already clearly discernible in his published work in his two early fields of research. These two fields of research are at the core of nineteenth-century algebra, which brings us to two additional, noteworthy characteristics of Hilbert’s work. Hilbert’s greatest talents were probably as an algebraist, and a strong algebraic inclination will also be recognizable in later works, even those works in fields apparently distant from algebra. An illuminating confirmation of this claim can be gleaned from a description of his contributions to algebra, written as late as 1922, by one of his students, Otto Toeplitz (1881-1940).52 After explaining Hilbert’s contribution to the 51 52\n\nBlumenthal 1922, 72. Toeplitz 1922.\n\nLATE NINETEENTH CENTURY BACKGROUND\n\n25\n\ntheory of algebraic invariants, Toeplitz mentioned, as a second contribution of Hilbert to algebra, the algebraic aspects of Hilbert’s research on integral equations and, in particular, those contributions connected with Hilbert’s theory of infinite determinants. Toeplitz even included Hilbert’s current foundational work within his algebraic contributions. On the other hand, Hilbert’s algebra was and remained organically connected to the one that developed throughout the nineteenth century, as opposed to the new, structural algebra that developed beginning in the 1920s. Hilbert never published or directed doctoral students on topics connected with the abstract theories of groups, of ideals, or of fields.53 Hilbert’s axiomatic approach was conceived, and initially developed, over the same period of time when his published research focused strictly on these two early fields, invariants and number theory. The ripening process leading to the publication of GdG was most clearly manifest, above all, in his docent activities in geometry, as will be seen in the next chapter. It is also incipiently visible, however, in the developments described in this section. The remaining sections of the present chapter will help complete the background picture of the complex process leading to the consolidation of Hilbert’s axiomatic approach to geometry and physics. 1.2. FOUNDATIONS OF GEOMETRY Hilbert’s GdG appeared at the culmination of a vigorous trend of research in the foundations of geometry that spanned the last third of the nineteenth century, involving the contributions of mathematicians such as Riemann, Beltrami, Helmholtz, Klein, Lie, Pasch, Veronese, and many others. This trend originated in connection with several domains of enquiry and methodological-epistemological concerns, that—before gradually converging towards each other, and reaching a peek in Hilbert’s work—emerged, developed, and flourished separately over the century. These domains included the intense research activity associated with projective geometry both in its main body of results and in its foundations, the questions sparked by the discovery and publication of non-Euclidean geometries (which raised philosophical concerns to a larger extent than they elicited actual mathematical research), the introduction of the manifold approach to the analysis of space, the question of the arithmetization of the continuum (which arose also as a main foundational question within analysis), and, finally, the gradual re-elaboration of axiomatic techniques and perspectives as a main approach to foundational questions in mathematics. 1.2.1\n\nRiemann\n\nElaborating on ideas originally developed within Gauss’s theory of surfaces, the most prominent, seminal foundational work on geometry at the middle of the nineteenth century was “On the Hypotheses which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry”, presented in 1854 at Göttingen as Habilitationsvortrag by Bernhard 53\n\nCf. Corry 2003, Ch. 3.\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nRiemann (1826-1866) and published posthumously in 1868.54 This year coincided roughly with the time when the works of Janos Bolyai (1802-1860) and Nikolai Lobatchevskii (1792-1856) on non-Euclidean geometry, as well as the related ideas of Gauss, dating from the 1830s, began to be generally known to the mathematical community and beyond. The existence of coherent alternatives to the traditional, Euclidean geometry raised the pressing need to revise the most basic, longstanding beliefs about the essence of geometrical knowledge, and to redefine the relationship between geometry and physical space. This challenge was to be variously addressed by philosophers and mathematicians over the coming decades. Riemann’s article was an early, radical instance of these efforts. Riemann’s article contained many innovative ideas with far-reaching consequences for several branches of mathematics. It proposed to analyze the idea of space by introducing a much more general concept of which the former idea was but a particular case—the concept of a multiply extended magnitude (mehrfach ausgedehnten Größe) or n-manifold, an essentially topological concept. On a given n-manifold one could define different metrics thus yielding different geometries. Thus, for instance, Euclidean space is defined as a 3-dimensional manifold endowed with a very specific metric. A thorough knowledge of any specific metric, and thus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, can be attained by meticulously analyzing the basic assumptions on which the science of geometry is built. Riemann called these assumptions “hypotheses” rather than axioms. By this time the latter term would mean a self-evident truth, whereas for Riemann the truths of Euclidean geometry were not self-evident and thus not necessary, but rather had an empirical character. It is worth quoting from the well-known, opening passages of Riemann’s article, since later on, in the writings of Hilbert we will find echoes not only of its main ideas, but also sometimes of its rhetoric as well. Thus Riemann stated: [A] multiply extended magnitude is capable of different metric relations, and consequently … space is only a particular case of a triply extended magnitude. But hence flows as a necessary consequence that the propositions of geometry cannot be derived from general notions of magnitude, but that the properties which distinguish space from other conceivable triply extended magnitudes are only to be deduced from experience. Thus arises the problem, to discover the simplest matters of fact from which the metric relations of space may be determined; a problem which from the nature of the case is not completely determinate, since there may be several systems of matters of fact which suffice to determine the metric relations of space—the most important system for our present purpose being that which Euclid has laid down as a foundation. These matters of fact are—like all matters of fact—not necessary, but only of empiric"
