He was entirely the sort of wise man and ruler described in Plato’s Republic.”1 With his Erlangen Program, Klein convincingly redefined geometry: geometric properties as invariants of transformation groups. He systematized mathematical theories by recognizing and explaining the interrelations between different disciplines. His visionary programs concerned mathematics and its applications, but also history, philosophy, and pedagogy from kindergarten through higher education. He was extraordinarily engaged, as his admirers would say, in raising awareness for the “eminent cultural significance of mathematics and its applications.”2 In 1892, the famous Austrian theoretical physicist Ludwig Boltzmann extolled Klein’s all-encompassing activity: […] Klein’s work encompasses almost all areas of mathematics. Especially noteworthy are his contributions to the following areas: 1 Algebra and its application to the theory of algebraic forms, number theory, geometry, the resolution of higher equations. 2 General theory of functions, theory of elliptic, Abelian, θ-functions and of Riemann surfaces; 3 Theory of differential equations; 4 Foundations of geometry, curvature and other shape relations of curves and surfaces, also newer geometry and projectivity, the application of geometry to mechanics.3\n\nThe present book deals with Klein’s multifaceted programs and the development of his works. It sheds light on how Klein became a scientist who was able to attract students – male and female alike – to follow his visions. In 1870, Klein became the first German mathematician to seek personal contact with French mathematicians since Plücker, Dirichlet, and Jacobi had done this some decades before. Klein traveled several times to the British Isles, to Italy, to the United States, etc. He was at the center of the first international congresses of mathematicians and was elected the first chairman of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) in 1908. In Germany, Felix Klein steered the fortunes of the German Mathematical Society three times as its chairman and, as a professor emeritus, he was still considered the “foreign minister” of mathematics. In the 1890s, the French mathematician Charles Hermite gushingly 1 2 3\n\nCOURANT 1926, p. 211. [UAG] Math.-Nat. Fak. 25, Valentiner (report from July 19, 1924). Quoted from HÖFLECHNER 1994, pp. 173–74 (Boltzmann to Paul von Groth). – Regarding the context, see Section 6.5.2.\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nreferred to Klein as “a new Joshua in the promised land.”4 Klein became a citizen of the world, explicitly condemning national chauvinism (see Section 8.4). A precocious student, Klein had completed secondary school at the age of sixteen, earned a doctoral degree at the age of nineteen, and completed his postdoctorate (Habilitation) at the age of twenty-one. He was offered his first full professorship at the age of twenty-three, at the University of Erlangen (1872). This was followed by positions at the Polytechnikum in Munich (1875), the University of Leipzig (1880), and the University of Göttingen (as of 1886). More than just focusing on Klein’s professional achievements, this book will also be concerned with Klein as a person. At the age of twenty-six, he married Anna Hegel, the granddaughter of the great philosopher. Her extant letters to Felix Klein document their good relationship and demonstrate that she was often involved in his academic work. Of their four children (one son, three daughters), their son would go on to pursue a technical career. Their youngest daughter studied mathematics, physics, and English in Göttingen and at Bryn Mawr College in the United States. She achieved a distinguished career as a teacher and school principal until 1932; later, she was demoted during the Nazi regime. Klein cultivated a cooperative working style. At the age of twenty, he found his most important partner in the Norwegian Sophus Lie. Klein wanted to work together, not in competition. Nevertheless, he had to deal with opponents, competitors, different views and interests. David Hilbert, who, on the occasion of Klein’s sixtieth birthday in 1909 also invited Henri Poincaré and Gösta MittagLeffler to Göttingen, referred in his speech then to Klein’s opponents and supporters and expressed his own affinity for Klein.5 Klein was not, from the outset, the “Zeus enthroned above the other Olympians,” as Max Born experienced him during his own years as a student (“He was known among us as ‘the Great Felix’,” Born went on, “and he controlled our destinies”).6 We will instead encounter a mathematician who was often plagued by self-doubt and who worried that he might not be able to live up to his own high standards. Early translations of his work and his efforts as the chief editor of the journal Mathematische Annalen brought him fame and influence. With his finger on the pulse of international trends, Klein left a lasting mark on many areas of mathematics, its applications, and organization in Germany. In an astounding number of areas, he was in fact a pioneer.7 At the University of Göttingen, Klein had laid the foundation for a new golden era and had pointed the way ahead, as Hilbert put it (see Appendix 12). This meant that he appointed the best scientists (among them Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, Carl Runge, Ludwig Prandtl, Edmund Landau) to work beside him, that he found new ways to retain them in Göttingen, and that he established new institutes by acquiring funds from industry – inspired by the example of American universities. 4 5 6 7\n\nFor the context of this quotation, see Section 8.2.2 of this book. See TOBIES 2019b, pp. 513–14, Engl. trans. in ROWE 2018a, pp. 198–99. BORN/BORN 1969, p. 16. For a summary of Klein’s pioneering achievements, see Section 10.2.\n\nix\n\nPreface\n\nRight up into old age, Klein was open to new mathematical, scientific, and technical theories. Thus he also identified open problems in the fields of fluid dynamics and statics. In partial collaboration with Emmy Noether, he made significant contributions to the theory of relativity, acknowledged by Albert Einstein. Klein recognized the specific talents of his students with great foresight. He promoted gifted persons regardless of their religion, nationality, and gender. He guided more than fifty doctoral students, including two women (an Englishwoman and an American) as well as further students from abroad, to new results. During his lifetime, he received numerous honors, and his versatility is still widely recognized today. Since the year 2000, the European Mathematical Society has awarded a “Felix Klein Prize” to young scientists for outstanding research in applied mathematics (this award was initiated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics in Kaiserslautern). Since 2003, moreover, the ICMI has presented a “Felix Klein Award” for lifetime achievements in the field of mathematical pedagogy. In Germany, several institutions have been named after him. There is a Felix Klein Lecture Hall and a Felix Klein Colloquium at the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf (Klein’s birthplace) and at the University of Leipzig as well. There is a Felix Klein building at the University of Erlangen and a Felix Klein program at the Technische University in Munich (including a “Felix Klein Teaching Prize”). In Göttingen, there is a secondary school named after Felix Klein, and the meeting room of the Mathematical Institute of the University is adorned by the original Max Liebermann portrait of Klein. The names of the donors who funded this painting are an expression of Klein’s worldwide network, which extended as far as India and Japan.8 After the late Leipzig historian of mathematics Hans Wußing had encouraged me to study the life and work of Felix Klein, it was the American historian of mathematics David E. Rowe who first enabled me – when Germany was still divided – to study the archival materials pertaining to Klein in Göttingen. The mathematician Helmut Neunzert invited me to give lectures at the University of Kaiserslautern with the following words: “We like to use Klein’s arguments to promote the applications of mathematics even today!” A Felix Klein Center was established there in 2008. Robert Fricke, the mathematician and erstwhile rector of the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig, aptly compared Felix Klein (an uncle of Fricke’s wife) to a triptych, the central panel of which should be devoted to Klein the researcher, while the two flanking panels should depict him as an academic teacher and an outstanding organizer.9 The goal of this book is to put this triptych into words and enrich it with a human dimension.

He did not yet have, however, a sufficient understanding of the latter. Klein’s ambition to understand and combine as many research areas as possible led to the further development of mathematical theories and to the establishment of new disciplines. These efforts, along with his “incomparable prophetic vision,”2 provided him with an overview of the disciplines that also enabled him to oversee the edition of the comprehensive Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen [Encyclopedia of the Mathematical Sciences, Including Their Applications] (1898–1935).3 Klein experienced and influenced several transformational processes in the field of mathematics. As a young mathematician, he himself was involved in transforming geometry. He attempted to penetrate into other areas as well. As a middle-aged man, he also promoted the study of set theory, ultimately accepting Hilbert’s axiomatic approach to constructing theories and making significant contributions of his own to the expansion of peripheral areas of mathematics: its applications in branches of theoretical physics and technology, and the history, didactics, and philosophy of mathematics. The period of disciplinary change in the field of geometry had a strong effect on Klein’s mathematical thinking as a young man. Erhard SCHOLZ (1980) has described this process in his history of the concept of manifolds: a retreat from the dominance of Euclidean geometry, the spread of new approaches to the field (nonEuclidean geometries, higher-dimensional geometry), and the synthesis of various research areas. The use of analytic methods had led to differential geometry (a preliminary high point in this regard was Gauss’s work from 1828). On the basis of algebraic methods, Jean-Victor Poncelet’s projective geometry (with synthetic and analytic methods) was further developed into algebraic geometry. Projective algebraic geometry in turn gave rise to the approaches of higher-dimensional geometry. The latter acquired a particular shape with the publication of Hermann 1 2 3\n\n[Oslo] A letter from Felix Klein to Sophus Lie, dated December 25, 1873. CARATHÉODORY 1925, p. 2.

Today, Graßmann’s book is recognized as one of the first attempts to formulate the abstract concept of vector space. Bernhard Riemann initiated a geometric research program whose guiding ideas would have effects beyond the nineteenth century and are still reflected in mathematical disciplines such as topology, geometric function theory, modern differential geometry, and the general theory of relativity, among others. As a young student under Julius Plücker, Felix Klein delved into what was then called “newer geometry” (neuere Geometrie). His orientation was broadened by Alfred Clebsch’s algebraic-geometric school, and he ultimately became an active contributor to these new developments. Hermann Weyl described Klein’s methodology as follows: The most prominent characteristic of his scientific methodology is his passion for mixing and folding things together, thus allowing a wide variety of disciplines to permeate one another. His mathematical brilliance is based on his ability to recognize internal connections and relations between concepts whose foundations are entirely distinct.4\n\nAs a student, Klein experienced the disputes between various mathematical schools and sensed the disadvantage of having a one-sided orientation. He saw that every method can have advantages and disadvantages. Regarding the conflict between analytic and synthetic methods in geometry, he held the following opinion: “A healthy development will use both methods and enjoy the fruits of their interaction.”5 Thus, from early on, he attempted to familiarize himself with a broad range of mathematical branches. The physiologist Carl Ludwig once told Klein that the best way not to be absorbed by a single school of thought was to travel about 600 kilometers away from one’s home and then reexamine the situation from that remove. “One will certainly be astonished,” Ludwig said, “to find that so many seemingly obvious views simply fall away.”6 Klein’s efforts to systematize and synthesize methods and disciplines involved reconceptualizing mathematical patterns of order. He reclassified geometry and function theory, for instance, by the group-theoretical approach to geometry and his principle of level separation (Stufentheorie) within the theory of elliptic functions.7 Klein always tried to see the complete picture and, looking back at his career, he considered himself to have been a “romantic, not a classicist” (according to Wilhelm Ostwald’s distinction between the two).8 Unlike a quietly ruminating classicist, who works on a single field in detail “with classical soberness” and sometimes never finishes this task, Klein numbered himself among the “re-\n\n4 5 6 7 8\n\nWeyl, Obituary of Felix Klein, 1928 ([UBG] Cod.

His creed was as follows: Certainly the keystone of every mathematical structure is to furnish compelling proof for all its assertions. Certainly mathematics condemns itself if it renounces compelling proofs. Yet the secret of the productivity of genius will always lie in posing new questions and divining new theorems that shall disclose valuable results and connections. Without the creation of new points of view, without new goals being set up, mathematics, for all the rigor of its proofs, would soon exhaust itself and begin to stagnate.9\n\nKlein was happy to let others work out the concrete details of his ideas. That said, he was also especially proud when he devised a convincing proof on his own. A clear example of this is his successful proof, first formulated in 1876, of one of Kronecker’s theorems (see Section 4.2.1). Klein’s famous book on the icosahedron would in fact culminate in the proof of this theorem (see 5.5.6).10 This biography will pay special attention to Klein’s manner of posing new questions, his recognition of new connections between fields, and his ability to identify fresh talents and new collaborators to advance many of his ideas. The remainder of this introduction will cast light on the state of research, highlight certain central questions, and describe my methodological approach and use of sources. 1.1 THE STATE OF RESEARCH Klein wrote a short autobiography,11 and his brother Alfred left behind a family chronicle. The twenty-nine volumes of preserved protocols from Klein’s seminars are a unique source that has yet to be analyzed in detail.12 These volumes, which are available online, range from the first seminar that Klein co-taught with Clebsch in the summer of 1872 all the way up to the year 1912. Klein himself was still able and resilient enough to furnish his collected mathematical writings – Gesammelte mathematische Abhandlungen (GMA, 1921–23) – with addenda and commentary; vol. 3 contains an appendix, including (chronological) lists: of his lectures, seminars, supervised doctoral theses, assistants, articles, and books.13 Even when some of his expositions no longer withstand critical scrutiny, they are still valuable sources that reveal his motives, points of departure, and the connections that he made. This is also true of his lecture courses, in which he often classified topics historically. His lectures on the development of mathematics in the nineteenth century (Vorlesungen über die Entwicklung der Mathematik im 19.\n\n9 10 11 12 13\n\nKLEIN 1979 [1926], pp. 254–55. See KLEIN 1884 (the first English edition of this book appeared in 1888). KLEIN 1923a. See CHISLENKO/TSCHINKEL 2007; TOBIES 2014; HELLER 2015; and ECKERT 2019b.

The occasion of Klein’s seventieth birthday was celebrated with the publication of a special issue of the journal Die Naturwissenschaften with contributions from R. Fricke, A. Voss [Voß], W. Wirtinger, A. Schoenflies, C. Carathéodory, A. Sommerfeld, H.E. Timerding, and L. Prandtl. Mostly free of hagiography, this issue reflects the spectrum of Klein’s productivity in an abbreviated form. Obituaries complete the picture. In the mentioned ENCYKLOPÄDIE, which Klein directed, a number of his earlier judgements and scholarly disputes (with Camille Jordan or Lazarus Fuchs,15 for instance) are smoothed over, relativized, or not mentioned at all. Typically, international experts present the state of research at the time. Here, as well as in later works of this sort,16 one finds numerous references to concepts that were either named after or coined by Klein. Without a doubt, Klein used the ENCYKLOPÄDIE to disseminate and classify his own findings. However, his correspondence with Henri Poincaré (see Section 5.5.5) and with Wilhelm Killing (see Section 3.3) are good examples of the facts that Klein strove for historical accuracy in his depictions of mathematical developments and that he never wanted his name to be associated with concepts or ideas originally formulated by others. Of the numerous mathematical concepts conceived by Klein and discussed at length in encyclopedia entries, some of the most significant should be listed here: Klein’s line coordinates (see Section 2.3.3); the Cayley-Klein metric (see Section 2.5.3); Klein’s Erlanger Programm, known in English as the Erlangen Program, which grew from his earlier research (see Sections 2.8.2 and 3.1.1); the problem of Clifford-Klein space forms (Section 3.3); Klein-Riemann surfaces (see Sections 4.2.3 and 5.5.1.2); Klein’s (homogeneous) space;17 Klein’s level theory for classifying the theory of (elliptic) modular functions (see Section 4.2.4.2);18 the Klein bottle (Section 5.5.1.2); Klein’s so-called “four-group” and his Formenproblem (Section 5.5.6); Klein’s fundamental theorems, later known as uniformization theorems (see Section 5.5.4); Klein’s (transcendental) prime form;19 and Klein’s oscillation theorem (see Sections 5.5.1.1 and 6.3.5). 14 There is only an English edition of the first volume, 1979. 15 Regarding a conflict between Klein and Jordan, see especially BRECHENMACHER 2011. On the polemic between Klein and Fuchs, see Section 5.5.5 and Appendix 5 in this book. 16 See NAAS/SCHMIDT 1961/1984; WEISSTEIN 2003, etc. 17 Klein space (Kleinscher Raum) is another name for a homogeneous space. Klein’s Erlangen Program interprets geometry as a theory of certain homogeneous spaces. A topological space X is called homogeneous if there is a topological transformation group G that transitively acts on X. This means that for every points x, y from X there is a transformation g from G such that gx = y. Intuitively, a homogeneous space X looks the same everywhere; observers of any of its points will see the same picture. 18 See the article by Robert Fricke in ENCYKLOPÄDIE, vol. 2.2 (1913). 19 See the article by Franz Meyer on “Invariantentheorie” in ENCYKLOPÄDIE, vol. 1, p. 297 (1899); and by Wilhelm Wirtinger on “Algebraische Funktionen und ihre Integrale” in ibid., vol. 2.2, pp. 115–75 (1901). Klein’s ideas on this topic were first published in his article “Zur Theorie der Abel’schen Functionen,” Math. Ann. 36 (1890), pp. 1–83.\n\n1.1 The State of Research\n\n5\n\nKlein’s work is multifaceted, inspiring, and fascinating, and so it comes as no surprise that a great many (male and female) mathematicians and historians of mathematics, science, technology, and education have written about various aspects of his activity. Thomas Hawkins, an American historian of mathematics, has earned accolades for his studies of Klein’s contributions. HAWKINS (1984) deserves special mention because it places Klein’s Erlangen Program in its proper context and analyzes its reception. I.M. YAGLOM (1988) examines Klein’s role in the evolution of the concept of symmetry. In 2015, Lizhen LI and Athanase PAPADOPOULOS published an anthology of articles devoted to investigating the impact of the Erlangen Program in various branches of physics and mathematics. Peter SLODOWY (1993, Engl. 2019) provides a new edition of Klein’s book on the icosahedron (KLEIN 1884), together with a commentary from a modern perspective. In 1986, Gerd FISCHER published a two-volume collection of mathematical models that were relevant to Klein’s research approach (this book was reprinted in 2018). FISCHER (1985) is an edition of Klein’s Abitur examinations in the field of mathematics. Regarding the topic of mathematical models, contributions by David E. ROWE (2013, 2017, 2019b) and Anja SATTELMACHER’s dissertation (2017) deserve special mention. Recently, too, the Spanish mathematician Roberto RODRÍGUEZ DEL RÍO (2017) has written a book about Klein’s new vision for geometry; his book has already been translated into Italian and French.20 SCHOLZ’s aforementioned dissertation from 1980 is not only an excellent history of the manifold concept from Riemann to Poincaré; it also includes a detailed discussion of Klein’s contributions to this area of study. SCHOLZ’s 1989 Habilitation thesis, which focuses on the group concept, and some of his other studies are likewise relevant to our topic. Regarding the history of the group concept, reference should also be made to the work of Hans WUßING (1969, 1984, 2007). ZIEGLER (1985) analyzes Plückerian line geometry and its further development by Klein and his student Ferdinand Lindemann within the framework of the history of projective geometry and geometric mechanics. More recent studies – BIOESMAT-MARTAGNON (2010) and PLUMP (2014) – have refined Ziegler’s work. In the middle of the 1980s, David E. Rowe, one of the foremost authorities on the mathematics of Felix Klein, began to publish articles on Klein’s work, and at the University of Mainz, he encouraged some students to focus on Klein as well. One noteworthy result of this encouragement is the Habilitation thesis by Moritz EPPLE (1999), which is concerned with knot theory. ROWE (2018a) is a convenient collection of the author’s earlier essays, and ROWE (2019a) offers a clear analysis of the early works of Klein and Sophus Lie and their mutual influence. Thirty years earlier, David E. Rowe had organized an international symposium on the history of mathematics,21 the proceedings of which were published in\n\n20 Unfortunately, it is not very reliable in numerous details. 21 The symposium was held between June 20th and 24th in 1988 at Vassar College (Poughkeepsie, New York). In the published proceedings (ROWE/MCCLEARY 1989), it is falsely stated that the conference took place in 1989.\n\n6\n\n1 Introduction\n\nthree volumes as History of Modern Mathematics. Around that same time, Rowe began to publish his first studies on Klein and Sophus Lie’s early collaborative work in the field of geometry (see ROWE 1989), a topic that Eldar Straume (Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, Trondheim) and Leslie Kay (Virginia Tech) have also been working on for some years. At the symposium in 1988, Jeremy J. Gray gave a talk about algebraic geometry in the nineteenth century. Additional studies by Gray on Lazarus Fuchs and his theory of differential equations (1984), on Poincaré (2013),22 and his recent argument (2019) that Klein helped to create the twentieth-century definition of Galois theory are important to understanding Klein’s mathematical influence. There are also many pertinent works by French historians of mathematics, including Frédéric BRECHENMACHER’s studies of Camille Jordan and related areas, a number of contributions by Hélène Gispert, with whom I co-authored an article in which we compared the mathematical societies in France and Germany (GISPERT/TOBIES 1996). Noteworthy, too, are Catherine GOLDSTEIN’s 2011 study of Charles Hermite, Barnabé CROIZAT’s 2016 doctoral thesis on Gaston Darboux, and several papers by François LÊ – particularly his 2015 study of Alfred Clebsch’s diagonal surface, a topic that held Klein’s interest for many years.23 For her MA thesis at the University of Jena, Tina RICHTER (2015) translated and annotated the correspondence that Darboux addressed to Klein. On the basis of additional sources, it has been possible to study Klein’s relationship with French mathematicians in greater detail (see TOBIES 2016). Konrad JACOBS (1977) published a selection of facsimiles and transcriptions from Klein’s substantial Nachlass, which is carefully archived at the Göttingen State and University Library. Only a small portion of Klein’s vast correspondence has been edited for publication. The letters exchanged by Klein and Hilbert were edited by FREI (1985). TOBIES and ROWE (1990) contains Klein’s correspondence with Adolph Mayer, where the main topic of discussion is the activity of editing the journal Mathematische Annalen. Smaller editions of Klein’s correspondence – between Klein and Otto Stolz (BINDER 1989), Klein and E.S. Fedorov (BURCKHARDT 1972), Klein and A. Gutzmer (TOBIES 1988), Klein and A.A. Markov (TOBIES 2018), Klein and Paul Koebe (TOBIES 2021a) – round out this picture. Umberto Bottazzini has written at length about Riemann’s influence on Italian mathematicians. Together with Jeremy Gray, he analyzed the development of complex function theory (BOTTAZZINI/GRAY 2013). Bottazzini and other Italian historians of mathematics have done much to reveal the close connections that Klein had with the Italian algebraic-geometric school of thought. Of particular interest are two collections of articles, one on mathematicians in Bologna (COEN 2012) and the other on the work of Corrado Segre (CASNATI et al. 2016). Several\n\n22 This biography focuses primarily on Poincaré’s most significant publications; see the review by Scott A. Walter in Historia Mathematica 44 (2017), pp. 425–35. 23 On the occasion of Klein’s 150th birthday, a ceramic model of this surface (1.4 meters wide and 2.5 meters high) was installed at the University of Düsseldorf (see KAENDERS 1999).\n\n1.1 The State of Research\n\n7\n\neditions of correspondence, moreover, document the fact that Klein maintained a close relationship with mathematicians in Italy ever since his first trip there in 1874 (see CREMONA 1992–99, LUCIANO/ROERO 2012, and ISRAEL 2017). I was personally able to examine a collection of Klein’s letters held in Pisa. Since the publication of his dissertation in 1986, Klaus VOLKERT has made several contributions to topics that are relevant to this study (the history of Anschauung, non-Euclidean geometry, etc.). Karen PARSHALL and David E. ROWE’s book from 1994 not only illuminates the prominent role that Klein played in the emergence of the American mathematical research community; it also provides a lucid outline of Klein’s most significant mathematical findings. Reinhard SIEGMUND-SCHULTZE has published a number of books and articles that I have drawn upon, including his work on Richard von Mises, who – recognized by Klein – enhanced the domain of applied mathematics. Ulf HASHAGEN’s thesis on Walther Dyck (2003) and Michael ECKERT’s studies on Arnold Sommerfeld (2013) and Ludwig Prandtl (2017, Engl. 2019a) are also rich and reliable sources for Klein’s biography. There have only been a few assessments of Klein’s political positions. The role of Jewish mathematicians in German-speaking academic culture is the topic of BERGMANN et al. (2012), and the prominence of Jewish mathematicians in Göttingen during Klein’s years there was discussed as early as ROWE (1986). Cordula TOLLMIEN’s detailed analysis (1993) has made it possible to reinterpret the fact that Klein’s signature appears on the nationalistic “Manifesto of the Ninety-Three” from 1914. The older study by Karl-Heinz MANEGOLD (1970) investigated the main aspects of Klein’s activity as an organizer of scientific research. Susann HENSEL et al. (1989) analyzed the anti-mathematical attitude of German engineers in the nineteenth century – an attitude that Klein was ultimately able to overcome. Bernhard vom BROCKE (1991) is an insightful collection of articles on the so-called “Althoff system” that prevailed at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, which would turn increasingly to Klein as a reliable adviser. Several scholars have written about Klein’s contributions to reforming mathematical education. Here I should refer in particular to the pioneering studies by Gert SCHUBRING and the recent translation of Klein’s book series Elementary Mathematics from a Higher Standpoint by Schubring, Martha Menghini, and Anna Baccaglini-Frank in 2016. WEIGAND et al. (2019) brings together a variety of international research approaches; the book arose from a series of panels devoted to the “legacy of Felix Klein” at the 13th International Congress on Mathematical Education, which was held in Hamburg in 2016. Masami ISODA’s contribution in the latter book – along with Harald KÜMMERLE’s excellent doctoral dissertation (2018), published as a book in 2021 – have shed light on the extent to which Klein’s influence reached as far as Japan (see also DAUBEN/SCRIBA 2002). Finally, this book is the culmination of many years of archival research, and it draws upon much of my own earlier work on a broad spectrum of topics (see the Bibliography).\n\n8\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.2 GUIDING QUESTIONS In order for this book to remain readable, I have necessarily had to limit the scope of my presentation. Each of the scholars cited above understandably approached the topic of Klein’s biography from a particular perspective. As I learned as a young historian of mathematics and education, however, a proper assessment of a problem or a scientist should ideally take all sides into account. Even though it would of course be impossible in this biography to write a detailed history of all the disciplines to which Klein contributed, my attempt at an omnivorous approach has enabled me to reach new conclusions about Felix Klein as a mathematician and as a person. My thesis is that Klein’s way of working was characterized, above all, by its continuity. This is counter to the prevailing opinion that his approach changed drastically in 1882 (because of health problems) and in 1895 (when Hilbert joined the faculty in Göttingen). It will be shown that during the early stages of his career, when his research primarily concerned geometry, algebra, function theory, and number theory, Klein had already developed a consistent attitude toward applied mathematics, social issues, educational policy, and scientific administration. Conversely, during his later years, when his focus shifted to so-called peripheral areas of mathematics, Klein did not cease from promoting works of pure mathematics. It will also be necessary to reevaluate Klein’s health-related issues and his political attitude. The aspects that have guided my research for this biography are the following: First: I will examine how and by what means Felix Klein became an internationally recognized mathematician who significantly influenced the development of mathematics, its applications, and education during his lifetime. Second: Klein’s manner of conducting research and leading people was based on cooperation. He brought students and young researchers from numerous countries within his fold. I will show who his most important collaborators were for his research programs and projects during specific periods of his life, and I will also discuss when and why competition happened to arise instead of cooperation. Third: Klein’s lifetime coincided with the German Empire and the beginning of the Weimar Republic. He was briefly a paramedic during the Franco-Prussian War, and he experienced the First World War. He secured financial backing from industry and also from the military in order to build up his teaching and research programs in Göttingen. I intend to discuss the political attitude that underlay his pursuits. In my efforts to ascertain the structural features of Felix Klein’s career, Ludwik Fleck’s concept of the “thought collective” has proven to be especially useful. Fleck’s work is recognized today as a precursor to Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In 1935, and thus long before Kuhn, Fleck – a PolishJewish microbiologist, physician, and theorist of science – analyzed the genesis and structure of research communities, which he referred to as thought collectives.\n\n1.2 Guiding Questions\n\n9\n\nTo characterize the views that prevail within a thought collective (Denkkollektiv), he coined the term “thought style” or “style of thinking” (Denkstil): If we define a “thought collective” as a community of persons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intellectual interaction, we will find by implication that it also provides the special “carrier” for the historical development of any field of thought, as well as for the given stock of knowledge and level of culture. This we have termed a “thought style.”24\n\nFleck referred both to the group-formational and social effect of commonly shared views and concepts and to the special role that such collectives play in introducing young researchers to a given area of study. Group norms experienced in one’s youth can often be formational throughout one’s life. At the same time, acquiring experiences in one area and trying them out in other communities can be points of departure for becoming a member of a special thought collective or for forming a collective on one’s own. According to Fleck, too, each member of such a collective can simultaneously belong to other communities (scientific, political, cultural) and thus introduce varying points of view. At this point, it can be said that one of Klein’s major characteristics was his willingness and ability to form, manage, and lead associations or groups. His work ethic was based on the values of his family and early education. His connection to the internationally networked Plücker and Clebsch allowed him to become a member of a community associated with “newer geometry,” which still had to be formed on the national level. The early deaths of Plücker and Clebsch contributed to the fact that Klein was able to become the head of a thought collective that aimed to carry out Riemann’s agenda in the field of geometry. At the time, Leo Koenigsberger, who was Karl Weierstrass’s first prominent student, sensed that a shift in the predominant style of thinking was taking place: Even we younger mathematicians all felt at the time as though the Riemannian views and methods did not belong to the strict mathematics of Euler, Lagrange, Gauß, Jacobi, Dirichlet, and others – as always seems to be the case when science is penetrated by a great new idea, which at first needs time to be processed in the minds of the living generation. Thus the achievements of the Göttingen school were not appreciated by many of us (or at least not by most of us) as much as their great significance deserved, and we seldom gave this work the place of distinction that science would soon award it.25\n\nKlein remained rooted in this geometric style of thinking, even though he would go on to integrate the methods of other orientations into his concepts. Thus, nearly at the age of sixty, he ultimately accepted the axiomatic style of thinking that, thanks above all to David Hilbert, came to prevail in Germany.26 Although Klein supported Hilbert’s new approach to invariant theory, he was at first not fully on board with the latter’s “abstract” number theory. Surprisingly, sources reveal that Klein’s much-discussed talk on “arithmeticization” (1895) had originally been 24 FLECK 1979 [1935], p. 39. See also TOBIES 2012, pp. 7–8. 25 KOENIGSBERGER 2004 [1919], p. 29 (http://histmath-heidelberg.de/txt/koenigsberger/leben.pdf). 26 In this regard, see also Klein’s notes on Hilbert’s problems (1900) in Section 10.1.\n\n10\n\n1 Introduction\n\ndirected against Hilbert’s new “abstract” approach, something that Klein later, in 1908, himself referred to as subjective (see Sections 6.3.7.3, 8.2.2, 8.3.2). Contrary to Herbert MEHRTENS’s (1990) classification of mathematicians as either modern (Hilbert et al.) or anti-modern (Klein et al.),27 it seems to me as though, in Klein’s case, it is possible to speak of a particular sort of modernity on whose basis new domains such as modern numerical analysis, actuarial mathematics, and financial mathematics were able to develop. These would later give rise to fields such as engineering mathematics and business mathematics.28 In order to establish the necessary institutional and personnel resources for the study of mathematical applications in technical fields, Klein sought and acquired new sources of funding by following the example of the Carl Zeiss Foundation in Jena and that of American universities. Mitchell Ash has underscored, as a scientific-historical concept, the extent which the availability of “financial, […] cognitive, instrumental, personnel, institutional, or rhetorical” resources have influenced the development of science.29 This concept of resources provides a fitting way to understand Klein’s efforts to secure and utilize financial support – from all available sources (the state, industry, the military) – for teaching, research, instruments, and institutes. Conversely, the interest of donors can be seen as an interest in scientific results. At the same time, this need for resources does much to explain Klein’s activity as a non-partisan representative of the University of Göttingen in the Prussian Upper House of Lords (Herrenhaus, the first chamber of the Prussian parliament) as well as his rhetoric and approval of declarations during the First World War (see Sections 8.3.4 and 9.1). Ash’s concept also fits well with Klein’s approach to hiring personnel. Klein always sought out the best candidate for a specific job in question, without regard to gender, nationality, or religious affiliation. This is evidenced by his (hitherto unknown) engagement on behalf of Georg Pick (see 5.5.2.4) and his support for the careers and publications of Max and Emmy Noether, Adolf Hurwitz, Arthur Schoenflies, Georges Brunel, Gino Fano, Irving W. Stringham, and many others. In order to present all of this information in a readable fashion, I have organized this book around the following three points (I to III): I. Arranging the book according to the stages of Klein’s life and career has made it possible to best represent the early-established diversity of his activity. Chapter 2 thus examines the formative communities of which he was a part. The latter include his childhood family and school years, which formed the basis of his prodigious work ethic. This period was followed by his time as a university student (in Bonn, Göttingen, Berlin, and Paris), when he met influential teachers (Plücker, Clebsch) who opened up opportunities for him to join international communities of intellectuals and who made it easier for him to find collaborative partners. Klein’s time as a Privatdozent in Göttingen, where he was part of 27 For a critical view of this classification, see also ROWE 1997 and BAIR et al. 2017. 28 See NEUNZERT/PRÄTZEL-WOLTERS 2015 and FRAUNHOFER ITWM 2018. 29 ASH 2002, p. 32. See also ASH 2016.\n\n1.2 Guiding Questions\n\n11\n\nClebsch’s tight community, ultimately had the effect that, as the youngest member of Clebsch’s circle, he was able to carry on, with the greatest intensity, the latter’s program of bringing together disciplines and people, and that he was even able to promote the careers of older members of the group. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are devoted to Klein’s activity as a full professor at the University of Erlangen (1872–75), at the Polytechnikum in Munich (1875–80; the latter institution was designated a Technische Hochschule in 1877), and at the University of Leipzig (1880–86). In 1886, Klein transferred to the University of Göttingen, and his range of activity there is treated in four chapters (6 through 9), which warrant summaries of their own. Chapter 6 covers the years 1886 to 1892. These years in Göttingen were made difficult by the fact that Klein had been hired against the wishes of the two professors of mathematics who were already on the faculty there, H.A. Schwarz and E. Schering (see Section 5.8.2 and Appendix 4) – a fact that long went unrecognized. Klein cultivated contacts within the overall framework of the university, within the national framework of mathematicians, and abroad. In Göttingen, he concentrated on his academic work and sent memoranda with wide-reaching aims to the Prussian Ministry of Culture. It was not until 1892, when Schwarz accepted a new position in Berlin and Klein rejected an invitation to move to the University of Munich, that Klein was able to realize many of his goals. Chapter 7 concerns the years 1892 to 1895. Supported by Heinrich Weber and oriented toward foreign – particularly American – examples (Klein’s first trip to the United States was in 1893), Klein was able to form the basis for his success in the coming years. During this brief period, his most significant accomplishments included hiring, for the first time, mathematical assistants at Göttingen; founding the Göttingen Mathematical Society; establishing contact with secondary-school teachers and industrial leaders; supporting the right of women to study at the university level; creating an official course of study for actuarial mathematics; beginning the ENCYKLOPÄDIE project; and, finally, hiring Hilbert in April of 1895. Chapter 8, which treats the period from 1895 to 1913, examines the fruits of Klein’s previously determined course of action and illuminates the interrelated nature of his projects. During this time, he completed his monograph on automorphic functions (FRICKE/KLEIN) and worked on a book about the spinning top theory (KLEIN/SOMMERFELD; Klein’s interest in this topic can be dated back to his second stay in Paris in 1887). Within the framework of his intensively managed program for mathematical physics and mechanics (an idea he formulated as early as 1881; see Section 5.5), Klein became a significant originator of ideas for young researchers (see Section 8.2.4). He was able to forge alliances between Göttingen scientists and industrialists, and he was also able to convince the latter that it was in their interest to provide financial support. Moreover, this support was meant to assist not only research but also educational reform, which Klein coordinated and promoted both nationally and internationally. It should become clear from this chapter that Klein’s practical committee work (regionally, nationally, and internationally) was closely interrelated both to his research-oriented teaching and to his theoretical work on book projects such as\n\n12\n\n1 Introduction\n\nthe ENCYKLOPÄDIE, the Abhandlungen über den mathematischen Unterricht (KLEIN 1909–16), and Kultur der Gegenwart (KLEIN 1912–14). Klein’s early idea to prepare an (ultimately unrealized) final volume for the ENCYKLOPÄDIE meant that he devoted considerable energy to intensively studying the history, philosophy, psychology, and didactics of mathematics (see Section 8.3). Chapter 9 concerns Klein’s time as an emeritus professor (1913–25), a period that also includes the years of the First World War. After a respite spent in a sanatorium, he continued to manage committees, teaching, and editorial projects. He made substantial contributions to the general theory of relativity and he remained, in the words of Abraham Fraenkel, the “foreign minister” (Außenminister) of German mathematics.30 It should be stressed that Klein’s term as a representative of the University of Göttingen in the Prussian parliament, 1908–18 (see Sections 8.3.4 and 9.1.2), where he focused on educational policy, and his immediate action after the November Revolution of 1918 can be seen as a remarkable example of continuity across periods of political upheaval. The extent of these activities, which concerned research funding, issues of hiring, and new educational reforms, will be discussed at length here for the first time. Chapter 10 will revisit the guiding questions of this book and summarize the many pioneering aspects of Klein’s work. The Appendix of this book contains a selection of important primary sources. In order to help the reader work through the book, I decided to make the Index of Names more comprehensive than is customarily the case. There, in addition to including biographical dates, I have also indicated whether a given person conducted doctoral research under Klein, contributed to the ENCYKLOPÄDIE, or became member of the German Mathematical Society (DMV). II. At the beginning of each chapter, I provide a brief overview of Klein’s activity during the timeframe under discussion, with respect to how this activity related to research topics, teaching, committees, or to new local, national, and international processes. References in the book to previous or later developments are meant to facilitate the recognition of broader contexts and continuities. III. Topics that remained relevant across extended periods of time are discussed at greater length upon their first mention. Topics of this sort include, for instance, the members of Clebsch’s intellectual community (Section 2.4.1); the role of the journal Mathematische Annalen and Klein’s position on its editorial board (Section 2.4.2); the members of Klein’s family (Section 3.6); Klein’s advisory position for the B.G. Teubner publishing house and his influence over its publications (Section 5.6); Klein’s work for and within the German Mathematical Society (Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung, DMV; Section 6.4.4); the ENCYKLOPÄDIE project, which began as an idea proposed by Franz Meyer (Section 7.8); and other innovations that I discuss in Chapter 7. This approach made it possible for me to concentrate, in Chapters 8 and 9, on the new activities that Klein began to undertake during his later years. 30 FRAENKEL 2016 [1967], p. 138.\n\n1.3 Editorial Remarks\n\n13\n\n1.3 EDITORIAL REMARKS This section provides an overview of my treatment of sources, my citation style, and other editorial issues. On the basis of TOBIES (1981a), the late Emil Fellmann asked me in 1982 to prepare a comprehensive biography devoted to Felix Klein for his series Vita Mathematica. Due to the political and territorial divide in Germany, however, I was unable to accomplish this at the time, mainly because I had yet to study Klein’s comprehensive Nachlass in Göttingen. In 1985, David E. Rowe made it possible for me, for the first time, to spend four weeks examining this archive. Since then, a number of additional works have been published. Our edition of Klein’s correspondence (TOBIES/ROWE 1990), for instance, was the result of fruitful collaboration. In the summer of 2015, Annika Denkert of Springer Spektrum in Heidelberg invited me to write a biography of Felix Klein for her Portfolio series (TOBIES 2019). At that point, I asked David E. Rowe if he might be willing to co-author such a book with me, but his other obligations regrettably prevented him from doing so. In the present book, I have made an effort to allow Felix Klein to speak for himself as often as possible. One of my primary aims has been to examine overlooked or infrequently analyzed sources in order to discover the reasoning behind Klein’s decisions, to expose the origins of his approaches, and to present the arguments and opinions of his contemporaries. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to study and analyze numerous primary sources. These include countless letters by and to Klein, for the latter documents possess the highest degree of authenticity. It was Klein’s custom to write and save drafts of his most important letters. Typically, these drafts differ little from the letters that he ultimately sent, as a quick comparison of his correspondence with the Prussian Ministry of Culture shows [StA Berlin]. The drafts of his letters are archived in Klein’s Nachlass in Göttingen [UBG]. In October of 1878, however, Klein burned all of his previous correspondence in an “impetuous act of foolishness,” as he explained to Max Noether in 1899.31 In order to assess matters before this time, therefore, the letters to his correspondence partners that survive elsewhere (Oslo, Paris, Pisa, St. Petersburg, etc.) are especially important. Beyond this, documents preserved in additional Nachlässe (Ferdinand Lindemann’s, Robert Fricke’s, among others), the private estate of Meinolf Hillebrand’s family (Hillebrand was one of Klein’s great-grandsons), and materials housed at Klein’s Gymnasium in Düsseldorf have been extremely valuable. Another excellent source is the unedited correspondence between Klein and Adolf Hurwitz; this entire collection of letters is archived in Göttingen. Revealing, too, is the correspondence between H.A. Schwarz and Karl Weierstrass [BBAW], for the two had much to say about Klein. An overview of the primary sources that I have consulted can be found in the list of archives at the beginning of this book’s bibliography. 31 [UBG] Cod. MS. F. Klein 12: 651 (a letter from Klein to M. Noether dated March 1, 1899).\n\n14\n\n1 Introduction\n\nAbbreviated references in my footnotes are spelled out in full in the bibliography. Citations in [square] brackets refer to archival sources, while the names of authors in SMALL CAPITALS refer to works of scholarship. Certain secondary sources, which are relevant only to a specific context, have been cited in full in the footnotes and not added to the bibliography. The transliteration of Cyrillic names is not always consistent, for the simple reason that they appear in different forms in different sources. Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank the editors at the Birkhäuser/Springer publishing house in Basel/Cham (Switzerland) – Thomas Hempfling, Sarah Goob, Sabrina Hoecklin, and Martin Mattmüller – for including this book in the series Vita Mathematica. The editor of this series, Martin Mattmüller, read the entire manuscript diligently, and the author is deeply grateful for his helpful advice. I would like to continue by emphasizing that I am deeply indebted to the directors and staff of the numerous archives whose sources I have already been able to use for the German version of this biography. Special thanks go to Mrs. Bärbel Mund, Head of the Manuscript Department at the University Library of Göttingen, for her ongoing support. I am also indebted to numerous colleagues who read the original German edition of this book and have since shared and discussed additional insights with me in a wide variety of settings: at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences (Leipzig), the Polish Mathematical Society and at the Institute of the History of Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, and the Mathematical Institute of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, at meetings of the German Mathematical Society and the Austrian Mathematical Society, at the Kepler Symposium hosted by the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, at the Toeplitz Colloquium organized by the University of Bonn, at a lecture held at the Felix Klein Center in Kaiserslautern (organized by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics) – among other places. This book could not have been written without the help and collaboration of my international colleagues. David E. Rowe deserves special thanks for his early support and for providing numerous valuable references for the English edition. For many years of fruitful cooperation and for his many fundamental contributions to this book, I owe special thanks to Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze (Kristiansand, Norway). As far back as 1992, the mathematician Tito M. Tonietti (Pisa) enabled me to have access to the archives at the Scuola Normale. Christa Binder (Vienna) kindly made her transcriptions of the correspondence between Klein and Otto Stolz available to me. I sincerely thank Frédéric Brechenmacher for sending me his publications as well as letters from Felix Klein to Camille Jordan. For their collaboration on several projects, my gratitude extends to Hélène Gispert, MarieJosé Durand-Richard, and Dominique Tournès. Marie-José Durand-Richard also went above and beyond to ensure that I could acquire copies of Klein’s letters held in the Darboux Nachlass in Paris. An effort to assist Eldar Straume (Trond-\n\n1.3 Editorial Remarks\n\n15\n\nheim, Norway) and Leslie Kay (Virginia Tech) with their project of editing Klein’s letters to Sophus Lie provided me with an occasion to study archival material in Oslo, and I have to thank Eldar Straume for kindly inviting me (after my work in Olso) to deliver a lecture in Trondheim, and also Reinhard SiegmundSchultze, who invited me to Kristiansand. Without the help of Sergei S. Demidov in Moscow, my work at the archive of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg would have been far less successful. Danuta Ciesielska (Warsaw/Kraków) generously made her analyses of the work of Polish mathematicians in Göttingen available to me, and she supported my research by inviting me to give lectures. Martina Bečvářová (Prague), who has published important works on Czech mathematicians, brought many new ideas to my attention at a workshop on “Women and Mathematics” hosted by the Oberwolfach Institute for Mathematics. I had the pleasure of organizing the latter event with Nicola Oswald (Wuppertal) and Tinne Hoff Kjeldsen (Denmark). I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Elisabeth Mühlhausen (Göttingen) and Cordula Tollmien (Hann. Münden) for their valuable collaboration in this field of research. Harald Kümmerle (Halle) familiarized me with his latest results on Japanese mathematicians who studied with Felix Klein. I would like to thank Michael Rahnfeld (Weddingstedt) and Henning Heller (Vienna) for comments on the effects of Klein’s work on aspects of the philosophy of mathematics. In this context, I would like to mention that Henning Heller completed his undergraduate thesis “Beiträge Felix Kleins zur Gruppen- und Invariantentheorie” [Felix Klein’s Contributions to Group and Invariant Theory] with me at the University of Jena in 2015, holds a master’s degree from the University of Bristol, and is currently working on Klein’s mathematics and philosophy at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary spirit at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena (at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science and the Ernst Haeckel House) deserves to be acknowledged here because it formed an important basis for my work. As I mentioned above, several colleagues have read the German version of this book in detail and have provided me with valuable references and feedback. I have made every effort to ensure that their insights have been included in the English translation. In this regard, my gratitude is also due to Reinhard Bölling (Potsdam), Peter Bussemer (Gera), Günter Dörfel (Dresden), Michael Fothe (Jena), Rita Meyer-Spasche (Munich), Rainer Schimming (Potsdam), and Gert Schubring (Rio de Janeiro). Finally, it remains for me to thank the translator himself, Valentine A. Pakis, for his constructive, reliable, and excellent work. The translator would like to acknowledge his great debt to Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze and Martin Mattmüller, who each read the draft in full and made invaluable corrections throughout. He would also like to thank Lizhen Li (University of Michigan) and Li Peng (Higher Education Press, Beijing) for making materials available to him that were out of his reach. Although I have relied on many people while writing this book, it goes without saying that I alone am responsible for any remaining errors or inaccuracies.\n\n16\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFigure 3: An excerpt of a letter from Felix Klein to Sophus Lie dated April 1, 1872 [Oslo] (Regarding the context, see Section 2.8.3.4)\n\n2 FORMATIVE GROUPS This chapter will examine the people and communities that shaped Felix Klein’s views, work ethic, manners of behavior, and style of thinking. The following groups will be discussed: – his family; – his classmates and teachers in Düsseldorf; – his intellectual community while studying in Bonn under Julius Plücker; – the algebraic-geometric school led by Alfred Clebsch; – his circle of friends in Berlin and Paris; and – the circle of Privatdozenten in Göttingen (not only mathematicians). 2.1 THE KLEIN–KAYSER FAMILY A strong work ethic and certain other factors were instilled in Klein from an early age. Both his father’s and his mother’s side of the family played a role in this, as both Felix Klein and his brother Alfred agreed. 2.1.1 A Royalist and Frugal Westphalian Upbringing A stubborn will, unrelenting diligence, a sober sense of reality, absolute reliability, and wellconsidered frugality – these are the traditional characteristics of this rugged German clan, which were also purely embodied in my father.1\n\nHis family (Kleine, Kleinen) stemmed from the Sauerland area of Westphalia.2 His ancestors included farmers and representatives of the region’s small-scale iron industry. His great-grandfather, the farmer Friedrich Peter Kleine (b. 11/11/1731), married Catharina Margarethe Schürfeld on July 27, 1776. Their first-born son, Johann Peter Friedrich Klein (b. 9/18/1777, d. 11/22/1858), was married to Maria Catharina Hammerschmidt (b. 3/31/1787, d. 10/6/1871), the daughter of a timber merchant. Her father could not write, but he was excellent at making calculations in his head. Felix Klein’s grandfather Peter Klein established a blacksmith shop that produced miner’s lamps and other small devices out of iron. These grandparents led a very simple and frugal life: a bucket in the yard was used for washing themselves. The family acquired a modest degree of prosperity through hard work: they used their small savings to purchase plots of forest, which they 1 2\n\nKLEIN 1923a, p. 12 (Felix Klein’s autobiography).

Of their six children, the eldest was Felix Klein’s father: Peter Caspar Klein, who was born on August 11, 1809 in Voerde and died on January 26, 1889 in Düsseldorf. His old-fashioned Prussian-Protestant disposition was, as Felix Klein described it in 1923, “in stark contrast to the more light-hearted and joyful manner of Rhinelanders.”3 Alfred Klein (1910) characterized his father as a “robust Westphalian, industrious, brusque, an organizational and financial talent, a man of independent mind and character, firm in his convictions, hard on himself and others.”\n\nFigure 4: Felix Klein at the age of two (unknown illustrator) [Hillebrand].\n\nBecause Caspar Klein had been frail as a child, he was spared from having to lead the hard life of a farmer or craftsman. At the age of fifteen, he was hired as a clerk at the mayor’s office on Enneper Straße (Enneper Street). The office’s jurisdiction included the districts of Haspe, Voerde (where Felix Klein’s grandparents lived), Vorhalle, Waldbauer, and Westerbauer. Enneper Straße, which extended for two miles along the Ennepe river, had been built as a military road by the Prussian government at the end of the eighteenth century. It was lined with numerous ironrelated production facilities. For the sake of serving his mandatory military service, Caspar Klein went to Düsseldorf, where he was active from 1829 to 1831 as a brigade clerk, sergeant and additionally worked for the “Royal Government.” After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the city of Düsseldorf had become the seat of government for the Rhineland Province of the Prussian Kingdom. Here, Felix Klein’s father worked as a civil servant and climbed the ranks to become a presidential secretary. In 1845, moreover, he took on an ancillary position as an inspector for the Jägerhof and Benrath Palaces. As a close confidante of two noble government presidents – Adolph Theodor Freiherr von Spiegel-Borlinghausen und zu Peckelsheim (in office from 1837 to November 1849) and Karl Friedrich\n\n3\n\nKLEIN 1923a (autobiography), p. 12.\n\n2.1 The Klein–Kayser Family\n\n19\n\nLeo Freiherr von Massenbach (from 1850 to 1866) – Caspar Klein remained faithful to the royal house. During the German revolutions of 1848–1849, he sat in fear with his family on packed suitcases. The family survived unscathed and, on August 7, 1850, Caspar Klein was awarded for his loyalty by being made a Knight of the Fourth Class of the Order of the Red Eagle.4 At the end of 1853, Caspar Klein was promoted to provincial treasurer (Landrentmeister), which was the highest financial office at the Royal Treasury in Düsseldorf. On Felix Klein’s Abitur diploma, his father’s profession is listed as provincial treasurer and government councilor. In 1889, Caspar Klein left behind a fortune of approximately 700,000 Mark, “which he had amassed through strict diligence, great frugality, and financial savviness.”5 He was able to support his son Felix when the latter had financial difficulties in Munich during the 1870s (see Section 4.4). Already in the 1860s, Caspar Klein made it possible for Felix, who was interested in science and technology, to tour factories, but he adhered to the principle that his sons should orient themselves, from an early age, toward career goals and toward earning their own income. In 1871, while he was a Privatdozent in Göttingen, Felix Klein still had to comply with his family’s strict principle of frugality. In a letter to the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, he complained about this rigid, unbending regime as follows: Dear Lie! Today I have to relate some sad news to you. I will not be able to come to Norway in the fall. My previous calculation has been spoiled by a letter that I received from home yesterday. I had devised a plan whereby I would have been able to make the trip if only the yearly sum that I receive from home would have been made available to me in advance. My father, however, rejected this idea categorically; I should become accustomed, “as though I were a civil servant,” to receiving regular quarterly payments. “I could take great trips as soon as I had greater means at my disposal.” I had to restrain myself with all my might so as to avoid starting a long conflict, so little do my parents understand me and my disposition. These people – and yet I must say that, relatively, my parents do not do this to the greatest extent – appraise the value of life according to the money that one earns and saves! And they have no notion whatsoever of how beautiful it is to live for an idea; they simply don’t believe me when I tell them that science is undertaken for its own sake […].6\n\nAs one can see, Felix Klein’s assessment here applies to both of his parents. On September 10, 1844, at the age of thirty-five, his father had married Sophie Kayser, who was ten years his junior, but he only did so after he had managed to save a sum of 2,000 Reichsthaler.7\n\n4 5 6 7\n\nHis son Felix would receive this same honor in the year 1889 (see Section 6.3.7.1).

On the status of Privatdozenten (lecturers), see Section 2.8. [Hillebrand] Alfred Klein (1910), p. 4. From 1821 to 1871, a special Reichsthaler (=30 silver pennies) was valid in Prussia.\n\n20\n\n2 Formative Groups\n\n2.1.2 Talent in School and Wide Interests as Gifts from His Mother’s Side My mother likewise came from people who had moved away from the industry of Aachen. She was more cheerful and had more flexible opinions than my father. Her multifaceted interests were therefore the main source of intellectual life in the house. Admittedly, this greater degree of activity was tied to an inclination toward nervous exhaustion, which, as a feature inherited from my maternal background, often affected me later in life.8\n\nFelix Klein remained very close to his mother and was known to have sent her a letter every Sunday.9 His opinion of his mother was shared by his brother Alfred, who wrote, “My mother represented what was good and genial in the house; she had strong pedagogical and speculative-scientific interests and a great memory for historical dates.” In addition, Alfred Klein underscored the intellectual activity of both parents and their “rationalistic way of thinking about religious issues.”10 The Kayser family tree can be traced back to the Reformation. In the Free Imperial City of Aachen, the ancestral home of the Kayser family, there was a long period of “religious unrest” during the decades of the Reformation. Merchants and educated citizen were among the first to convert to Protestantism, and they fled from the city in increasing numbers. The Kaysers, a family of fabric manufacturers, left for Thuringia. In addition to innkeepers and farmers, Sophie Kayser’s ancestors also included church dignitaries, surgeons, pharmacists, an estate manager, a civil servant, a wine merchant, and an instrument manufacturer. One ancestor (Privy Councilor of Commerce C.G. Jaeger) left behind a career as a dye manufacturer and indigo dealer to become a banker; upon his death in 1852, 1/32 of his estate (12,500 Reichsthaler) was inherited by Sophie Kayser. Felix Klein’s maternal grandfather, Christian Gottfried Kayser (b. 10/30/ 1791), followed the family tradition and became a wool and fabric merchant. On March 24, 1817, he married Eleonore Schleicher (b. 3/10/1793, d. 5/22/1875), who hailed from Stolberg. This couple’s four children were Felix Klein’s mother Sophie (b. 4/22/1819 in Aachen), Mathilde (married name: Fischer), and Alfred and Ivan, who both followed their father’s example and became fabric manufacturers and wool merchants.11 By Caspar Klein’s side, Sophie Kayser developed into a very frugal wife. The household budget had to be managed with embarrassing precision. According to Felix Klein’s brother Alfred, “Mother would have to calculate precisely whether she could afford to buy a single bread roll; any spending beyond the budget was unthinkable.”12 8 9\n\nKLEIN 1923a, p. 12. This is according to an obituary for Felix Klein that was written by F. Lindemann and printed in the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten on July 9, 1925. 10 [Hillebrand] Alfred Klein (1910) 11 Alfred Klein’s family chronicle (1910, 1918) does not relate when his mother’s siblings were born and died. 12 [Hillebran"
