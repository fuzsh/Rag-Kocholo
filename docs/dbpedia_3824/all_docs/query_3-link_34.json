        "text": "Helmholtz (1887) has been acknowledged as one of the forefathers of measurement theory. However, his conception of measurement differs from the modern, representational conception in several aspects. Firstly, Helmholtz does not clearly distinguish numbers from numerals, and uses considerations regarding numerals to support an empiricist philosophy of arithmetic. Secondly, his analysis of measurement entails something more than a study of conditions for using numbers in modelling measurement situations, because it presupposes that mathematical structures are common to subjective experiences and objective ones. I suggest that Helmholtz’s supposition rests upon a Kantian line of argument that can be summarized as follows: additive principles can be formulated independently of the entities to be measured, and, nevertheless, they are necessary for judgments about quantities to be generally valid. That is to say, mathematical structures have a constitutive function in Kant’s sense. Helmholtz therefore needs formal conditions of measurement. At the same time, his inquiry has an empirical aspect because mathematical structures are supposed to have a constitutive function only relative to scientific theories and their advancements. For the same reason, Helmholtz maintains that the extension of the laws of addition to all known physical processes should proceed progressively and independently of supposedly external limits such as incommensurable quantities."
