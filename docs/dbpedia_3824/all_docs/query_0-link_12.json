        "text": "Thales of Miletus, engineer (c. 624-546 BC)\n\nFirst sage of Greece, he founded classical geometry and natural philosophy. Alchemists have claimed him as one of their own. The theorem of Thales (one of two) is about two triangles with parallel sides: The pyramid's shadow is to the pyramid what a man's shadow is to the man [wow].\n\nElectricity | Earliest Mathematics | Eclipse | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | Facebook Fans\n\nAnaximander of Miletus (610-546 BC)\n\nFirst Greek scholar to write about Nature. A student and/or friend of Thales, he succeeded him as head of his Milesian school. Anaximander founded astronomy and cosmology (cf. apeiron). He introduced into Greece the gnomon, the sundial and cartography. Pythagoras was one of his pupils.\n\nPhilosophers | Ancient history | IEP | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia | NNDB | Rovelli (2023-06-06)\n\nPythagoras of Samos (c.569-c.495 BC)\n\nSon of Mnesarchus of Tyre. Founded in Croton (c.530 BC) the cult of the Phythagoreans (comprising akousmatikoi and mathematikoi) who proved the Pythagorean Theorem (which was known to the Chaldeans 1000 years earlier). Hippasus's discovery of irrational numbers disturbed them.\n\nPupil of Pherecydes | Monochord | Tetractys | Constant of Pythagoras | McT | W | SEP | WP | NNDB\n\nHeraclitus of Ephesus (c. 535-475 BC)\n\nNo man ever steps into the same river twice.\n\nHe founded metaphysics and argued that nothing remains still, which led him to a Mach-like principle of Relativity. Dubbed the weeping philosopher (while Democritus is the laughing philosopher). He called Pythagoras a fraud.\n\n\"Much learning does not teach understanding\" | IEP | Stanford | Wikipedia | NNDB\n\nParmenides of Elea (c. 515-450 BC)\n\nExistence is timeless; change is impossible.\n\nParmenides upheld the extreme view of static monism. He spent some time as a member of the Pythagorean community at Croton. Zeno was his eromenos. At age 65, Parmenides went to Athens and met a youthful Socrates (469-399 BC).\n\nBibliography | IEP | Stanford | Wikipedia | NNDB\n\nEmpedocles of Acragas (c. 492-432 BC)\n\nInventor of rhetoric and borderline charlatan. His arbitrary explanation of reality with 4 elements (Earth, Air, Fire and Water) and 2 forces (Love and Strife) dominated Western thought for over two millenia. Several of his intuitions were correct, though, including the finiteness of the speed of light.\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | IEP | Stanford | NNDB\n\nZeno of Elea (c. 490-425 BC)\n\nIn the most famous of his provocative paradoxes, Zeno asks how swift-footed Achilles could overcome a tortoise, since Achilles must first reach the initial position of the tortoise... By the time he gets there, the animal is elsewhere and Achilles is left with a similar challenge, ad infinitum.\n\nTortoise coordinates (GR) | Zeno's arrow | Quantum Zeno effect | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Stanford | Weisstein\n\nPhilolaus of Croton (c.470 - c.385 BC)\n\nHe put Pythagoreanism in writing (including numerology ). He is credited with the first astronomical system where the Earth wasn't at the center of the Universe. After a second fire destroyed the Pythagorean campus at Croton (c. 454 BC) Philolaus fled to Lucania and Thebes. He taught Archytas.\n\nMicrotonal music | Britannica | Wikipedia | Weisstein | Stanford\n\nHippias of Elis (c. 460 - fl. 399 BC)\n\nA sophist whom Plato despised (he portrays him as vain and arrogant, with a wide but shallow knowledge). Hippias devised the first transcendental curve, known as quadratrix or trisectrix because the quadrature of the circle and the trisection of an angle would be trivial if its use was allowed.\n\nQuadratrix of Hippias | Natural Law | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Britannica\n\nDemocritus of Abdera (c. 460-370 BC)\n\nThe atomists' school in Abdera was founded by his teacher Leucippus, himself a student of Zeno and a proponent of the law of causality. Democritus argued that all was made of indivisible atoms moving in the void. One of his followers, the alchemist Bolus of Mendes, also signed \"Democritus\".\n\nPseudo-Democritus alchemical corpus (still?) | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Stanford | Weisstein | NNDB | video\n\nHippocrates of Cos, physician (c. 450-377 BC)\n\nRevolutionary founder of Western medicine. An asclepiad, said to be a direct descendant (17 or 19 generations) of the legendary Aesclepius, Hippocrates studied philosophy under Democritus and learned rudiments of medicine from his father, Heraclides, and from Herodicus of Selymbria.\n\nThe 4 Humors of Hippocrates | Wikipedia | IEP | NNDB\n\nArchytas of Tarentum (428-347 BC)\n\nMathematician, statesman, staunch Pythagorean. Student of Philolaus and teacher of Eudoxus. Invented the pulley and the screw. Archytas considered surfaces generated by rotating curves and could double the cube by intersecting three of those (defining the Archytas curve in the process).\n\nSteam-powered flying pigeon | Harmonic mean | Math Men | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia\n\nPlato (427-347 BC)\n\nOn a land once owned by someone called Akademos, Plato created the first institution of higher learning, in 387 BC. His Academia lasted 915 years (Justinian closed it in 529). Initiation to Geometry was an entrance requirement. The aim was to teach or discover ideal laws behind appearances.\n\nTheory of Forms (or Ideas) | Metempsychosis | SEP | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nEudoxus of Cnidus (408-355 BC)\n\nHis definition of the comparison between ratios of (possibly irrational) numbers appears in the fifth book of Euclid. It inspired Dedekind's definition of real numbers (1872). Eudoxus invented the method of exhaustion built upon by Archimedes. He was the first Greek scholar to map the stars.\n\nGeometric series | Spheres of Eudoxus by J.L.E Dreyer | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nXenocrates of Chalcedon (396-314 BC)\n\nIn 338 BC, he was (narrowly) elected third rector of the Academia (suceeding Plato's nephew Speusippus of Athens). Unlike other atomists, he envisioned the ultimate constituents of matter as lines; not corpuscules. Xenocrates may thus be construed as the first string theorist...\n\nBody, mind and spirit | Forgotten philosopher | Britannica | SEP | MacTutor | Wikipedia | NNDB\n\nAristotle of Stagira, logician (384-322 BC)\n\nHe shunned mathematics entirely in his natural philosophy which was lightly based on crude observations. The lack of discussion of his dogma for two millenia greatly hindered the development of natural Science, especially when some Aristotelian misconceptions became part of Church doctrine.\n\nClassical elements | Plenism | Aristotelian mechanics | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Stanford | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nEpicurus of Samos, materialist (341-270 BC)\n\nFollowing Democritus, he believed only matter existed, consisting of atoms and void. Unlike Pythagoras or Plato he didn't believe in an immortal soul and argued that death shouldn't be feared. His philosophy and physics (causality and conservation laws) inspired Lucretius and Newton.\n\nEpicureanism (c.307 BC) | Garden of Epicurus | Swerve & free will | Wikipedia | Stanford | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nEuclid of Alexandria (c. 325-265 BC)\n\nFather of axiomatic geometry and author of The Elements (the most enduring textbook in the history of mathematics). His presentation of the mathematics of his times would become the centerpiece of mathematical teaching for more than 2000 years. Euclid shunned neusis constructions.\n\nEuclid's theorem (c.300 BC) | Platonic solids | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nAristarchus of Samos (c. 310-230 BC)\n\nCopernicus credited him for the idea that Earth rotates on its own axis and revolves around the Sun. From rough angular measurements, he estimated the distance to the Sun. As he couldn't detect the parallax of stars, he declared them to be extremely distant (which Archimedes wouldn't accept).\n\nHead of Aristotle's Peripatic School (c. 287 BC) | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nCtesibius of Alexandria (c. 310-222 BC)\n\nStarting out as a barber, he became an engineer and founded the school of mathematics at the Library of Alexandria (he may have served as its first head librarian). He invented a suction pump, a compressed-air catapult, a water organ and the regulated water-clock (fed by an overflowing vessel).\n\nKtesibios | Antikythera Mechanism (c. 70 BC) | Ktesibios Award (MCA, 2000) | Britannica | Wikipedia\n\nPhilo of Byzantium, engineer (c. 280-220 BC)\n\nAlso known as Philo Mechanicus, he was an engineer who journeyed to Rhodes and Alexandria. He is credited for inventing the escapement, the water mill and the gimbal suspension (described by Cardano). Philon constructed the Delian constant by intersecting a circle and an hyperbola.\n\nMechanike syntaxis (c. 250 BC) | Poliorcetica | McTutor | Wikipedia\n\nArchimedes of Syracuse (c. 287-212 BC)\n\nA native and resident of Syracuse, Archimedes studied in Alexandria and maintained relations with Alexandrian scholars. Although he became famous for designing war machines, this early physicist was, above all, an outstanding mathematician. The 14 Archimedean solids are uniform.\n\nLever | Spiral | Parabola | Sand Reckoner | \"The Method\" | Historical Tidbits | McT | WP | W | FB | NNDB\n\nEratosthenes of Cyrene (276-194 BC)\n\nEratosthenes headed the Library of Alexandria after Apollonius of Rhodes. In number theory, he is remembered for the Sieve of Eratosthenes. He also came up with the first accurate measurement of the circumference of the Earth.\n\nArmillary sphere | MacTutor | Weisstein | NNDB | Facebook | Carl Sagan (video) | NNDB\n\nApollonius of Perga (262-190 BC)\n\nApollonius named and studied the conic sections. He found that a circle consists of all points M whose distances to two foci (I,J) are in a fixed ratio (e.g., 2/3). He said that planets revolve around the Sun and that the Earth itself might as well be thought of as moving, like planets do.\n\nNO PORTRAIT | Circles of Apollonius | Polarity | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | FB\n\nHipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190-126 BC)\n\nHipparch founded trigonometry (table of chords, spherical coordinates) and discovered the precession of the equinoxes (130 BC). The nova of 134 BC inspired him to compile a catalog of 1080 stars. His lunar and solar models were accurate enough to predict eclipses.\n\nMagnitude of Stars | Astrolabe | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nTitus Lucretius Carus, didactic poet (99-55 BC)\n\nThe only extant work of Lucretius is the didactic poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things) where the basic Epicurean tenets are expressed in a surprisingly modern way. It's especially so about atomism, randomness and free-will. Rutherford's motto is a quote from Lucretius.\n\nEpicureanism | Three-age system | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nSeneca, stoic philosopher (c.4 BC-65 AD)\n\nLucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger served as Nero's tutor and an advisor early in his reign. He retired from public life in 62. He reflected on comets, meteors, meteorological optics, thunder and the colors produced by glass corners. Forced to commit suicide as a suspect in a plot against Nero.\n\nNaturales quaestiones (c. AD 65) | Epistolae Morales | Stoicism | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nHero of Alexandria, physicist (c. AD 10-75)\n\nInfluenced by Ctesibius. Some of his works were meant to be lecture notes: Pneumatica (fluids & steam) Metrica (methods and formulas for areas and volumes, lost until 1896) Mechanica (statics & simple machines) Catoptrica (mirrors). Hero still thought light-rays came from the eyes.\n\nHeron's formula (Metrica, c. AD 50) | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nPliny the Elder, encyclopedist (AD 23-79)\n\nGaius Plinius Secundus was a public official who wrote a lot. The 37 books of Historia Naturalis (AD 77) present, in an anthropocentric way, everything the Romans knew about the natural world. In this, Pliny cites nearly 4000 authors (his \"Ostanes\" need not be the one who cited Miriam).\n\nHistoria Naturalis (Bill Thayer) = The Natural History (Bostock & Riley) | Wikipedia | Weisstein | NNDB\n\nMary the Jewess, alchemist (1st century AD)\n\nEarliest female experimentalist on record (signing Miriam the prophetess, sister of Moses). The tribikos still and the eponymous balneum Mariae may be due to her. F. Hoefer credits her for muriatic acid. The oldest extant alchemical texts (by Zosimos of Panopolis) quote her as a past master.\n\nOpus Mulierum | Axiom of Maria | Chrysopoeia (1964) by Leonora Carrington | Jewish encyclopedia | Wikipedia\n\nDioscorides, pharmacologist (c. AD 40-90)\n\nPedanius Dioscorides was the Greek author of the first major pharmacopeia (which never went out of print and remained authoritative for over 1500 years). The 5 volumes of De Materia Medica (AD 70) present about 600 plants.\n\nDe Materia Medica | Greek Medicine | Wikipedia | Weisstein\n\nNicomachus of Gérasa (c. AD 60-120)\n\nA leading member of the late Pythagorean School. His Introduction to Arithmetic (Arithmetike eisagoge, c. AD 100) was the standard arithmetic text for more than 1000 years but it contains no proofs and has several elementary mistakes in it. He knew only 4 perfect numbers (6, 28, 496 and 8128).\n\nManual of Harmonics (Harmonicum Eincheiridion) | Theorem of Nicomachus | McT | Wikipedia\n\nMenelaus of Alexandria (c. AD 70-135)\n\nA resident of Rome who spent his youth in Alexandria, he recognized geodesics on a curved surface as analogs to straight lines on a plane. Shunning arcs of parallels, he defined spherical triangles as consisting of arcs of great circles. This was a turning point in spherical trigonometry.\n\nSphaerica (c. AD 100) | Menelaus' theorem | Britannica | MacTutor | Wikipedia\n\nPtolemy of Alexandria (c. AD 87-165)\n\nClaudius Ptolemaeus was a Roman citizen who wrote in Greek (his first name may have been Tiberius). His Almagest dominated astronomy for centuries. Ptolemy's theorem says that a tetragon is cyclic iff the product of its diagonals is the sum of the pairwise products of facing sides.\n\nPtolemy's theorem | Ptolemy's inequality | Almagest (c. AD 150) | McT | WP | W | NNDB\n\nGalen of Pergamos, physician (AD 129-217)\n\nA Roman citizen of Greek ethnicity, he started out as physician to the gladiators. He was so prolific (10 million words) that his surviving works (30%) represent nearly half of the extant literature from ancient Greece. His thinking dominated medicine for more than a thousand years.\n\nPlague of Galen (first pandemic, AD 165-180, Smallpox?) | Britannica | Wikipedia | NNDB | IEP\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (c. AD 170-230)\n\nLeading commentator of Aristotle, he revived Aristotelian ideas. Appointed to an endowed chair in Athens during the co-reign of Septimius Severus and Caracalla (AD 198-209). He first described the dark band, named after him, between the brignt primary rainbow and the dim secondary rainbow.\n\nDistillation | Alexander's dark band (c. AD 200) | Stanford | Britannica | Wikipedia\n\nDiophantus of Alexandria (c. AD 200-284)\n\nA Diophantine problem is to find an integer satisfying a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, or several such equations simultaneously. Diophantus himself never considered irrational numbers or nonpositive ones. His age at death was reportedly x = x/6 + x/12 + x/7 + 5 + x/2 + 4.\n\nProblems from Arithmetica by Tinka Davis (MS Thesis, 2010) | Wikipedia | MacTutor | NNDB\n\nLiu Hui, Chinese mathematician (AD 225-295)\n\nPossibly the best mathematician of ancient China, he was a descendant of Liu Yi, Marquis of Zixiang, and lived in the state of Cao Wei (one of the feuding Three Kingdoms). He expanded the Jiuzhang Suanshu with his own commentaries and an appendix which became an official surveying manual.\n\nCommentary (AD 263) added to the Jiuzhang Suanshu | Haidao Suanjing | Pi | WP | McT | Britannica\n\nPappus of Alexandria (c. AD 290-350)\n\nThe theorem of Pappus (generalized by Pascal in 1639) is a fundamental theorem of projective geometry. The name is also used for the two centroid theorems published by Paul Guldin (1577-1643) in Centrobaryca (1635) pertaining to the surface area and the volume of a solid of revolution.\n\nPappus graph | Area theorem | Wikipedia | MacTutor | Britannica | Wikipedia\n\nHypatia, neoplatonist martyr (c. AD 360-415)\n\nDaughter of the mathematician Theon (c. 335-405) last librarian of Alexandria, who raised her like a boy. Her teaching of science was seen as pagan. She was ambushed and skinned alive by a mob of Christian fanatics. Hypatia's murder marks the beginning of the Dark Ages in the West.\n\nWikipedia | MacTutor | Freebase | NNDB\n\nAryabhata the Elder (AD 476-550)\n\nAryabhata ushered Indian science into a golden age centered on Kusumapura and Ujjain. His Aryabhatiya (499) summarized Indian astronomy in 118 verses, 33 of which cover arithmetic, quadratic equations, spherical and planar trigonometry, continued fractions and power series...\n\nAryabhata satellite (ISRO, 1975) | Universität Klagenfurt | Britannica | Wikipedia | MacTutor\n\nJohn Philoponus, (c.490-c.570)\n\nIoannis Grammaticus was one of the last to hold the chair of philosophy in Alexandria. Controversial in his time, he was the only writer in late antiquity to point out that the duration of a body's free fall doesn't depend on its weight (contra Aristotelem ). Galileo would give him credit for that.\n\nDe aeternitate mundi contra Aristotelem | SEP | Theory of Impetus | Encyclopedia | Wikipedia\n\nBrahmagupta Bhillamalacarya (AD 598-668)\n\nBrahmagupta (the \"teacher from Bhillamal\") was the first to treat 0 like any other number. Like Diophantus before him, he pioneered the use of symbols in equations. He failed to specify that his celebrated formula for the area of a quadrilateral is only valid for cyclic quadrilaterals.\n\nBrahmagupta's formula (c. 620) | Identity | Brahmagupta's theorem | Rational quadrilaterals | WP | McT\n\nGeber, experimental chemist (c. AD 721-815)\n\nAbu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan al Azdi was born in Tus (Persia) but the Arabs claim him as one of their own. Geber (or Jabir) made remarkable scientific advances in practical chemistry but also produced eponymous gibberish on occult alchemy.\n\nkhemeia | retort | Wikipedia | Jabir | Chemical Heritage Foundation | al Shindagah\n\nAl-Khwarizmi, Algorismus (c. AD 783, fl.847)\n\nAl-jabr (transposition from one side of an equation to the other) is the technique which gave algebra its name. The term is from the title of the masterpiece published around 810 by Abu Abdallah Muhammed bin Musa al Khwarizmi.

His mathematical legacy includes chaos theory and contributions to topology.\n\nMacTutor | Wikipedia | Weisstein | Bruce Medal 1911 | Fans\n\nNikola Tesla (1856-1943)\n\nHe was originally trained as a mechanical engineer. At least 272 patents were awarded to Tesla in 25 countries. His work is the basis of modern alternating current (AC) electric power distribution. In 1960, the SI unit of magnetic induction (magnetic flux density) was named after him.\n\nVisions | Master of Lightning | Tesla coil | Teslamania | Weisstein | WP | NNDB\n\nEmile Picard, mathematician (1856-1941)\n\nPicard's little theorem (1879) says that any nonconstant entire function takes any value infinitely often, with at most one exception (dubbed lacunary). His great theorem says that, about an essential singularity, an analytic function takes every value infinitely often, with one possible exception.\n\nPhD 1877 | Painlevé transcendents (1889) | Picard-Lindelhöf theorem | Britannica | Weisstein | McT | WP\n\nJoseph John Thomson, physicist (1856-1940)\n\nJ. J. Thomson found the first evidence for isotopes and (re)discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, as constituent of cathode rays. Thomson won a Nobel (1906). So did his son and seven of his research assistants: Bragg, Wilson, Rutherford, Barkla, Richardson, Born and Bohr.\n\nM.A. 1883 | Electron (1897) | Problem (1904) | Britannica | Weisstein | WP | NNDB\n\nHeinrich Hertz (1857-1894)\n\nIn 1887, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz discovered the photoelectric effect, whose explanation by Einstein, in 1905, would establish the existence of photons. In 1888, he made the first transmission of a signal by radio waves. The SI unit of frequency (symbol Hz) was named after him, in 1960.\n\nFounder of contact mechanics (1882) | Uncle of Gustav Hertz (Nobel 1925) | WP | NNDB\n\nMax Planck, physicist (1858-1947)\n\nPlanck combined the formulas of Wien (UV) and Rayleigh (IR) into a unified expression for the blackbody spectrum. On Dec. 14, 1900, he justified it by proposing that exchanges of energy only occur in discrete lumps, dubbed quanta.\n\nPh.D. 1879 | Nobel 1918 | Wikipedia | MacTutor | FB | NNDB\n\nGiuseppe Peano, logician (1858-1932)\n\nIn 1880, Peano joined the staff at Turin where he succeeded Angelo Genocchi (1817-1889) to the chair of Calculus, in 1890. Peano defined the integers axiomatically (1889) and found a space-filling curve (1890). He invented symbolic logic (1895) and devised a new natural language (1903).\n\nPeano axioms (1889) | Formulario (1895-1908) | Latino sine flexione (1903) | Britannica | WP | McT | NNDB\n\nOtto Ludwig Hölder (1859-1937)\n\nLike his mentor Paul du Bois-Reymond (a student of Kummer) Otto Hölder argued against formalism in foundational mathematics, as championed by Cantor, Hilbert or Robert Grassmann, of whom he was most critical (1892). His intuitionism resembled Poincaré's (not Brouwer's).\n\nSc.D. 1882 | Jordan-Hölder theorem | Hölder mean | Hölder condition | Hölder's inequality (1884) | WP | McT\n\nDavid Hilbert, mathematician (1862-1943)\n\nOne of the most powerful mathematicians ever, David Hilbert gave a famous list of 23 unsolved problems in 1900. Quantum Theory is based on the complex normed vector spaces which are named after him. In 1931, Gödel shattered the dream Hilbert had voiced in 1930 (\"we will know\").\n\nHilbert's List (1900) | Hilbert's radio address (1930) | WP | McT | FB | NNDB\n\nAgnes Pockels, physicist (1862-1935)\n\nBarred from higher education as a woman, she accessed scientific litterature through her younger brother Friedrich (PhD 1889) and was helped by Rayleigh once she sent him her research on surface tension. Her homemade apparatus paved the way for the Langmuir-Blodgett trough.\n\nDr. h. c. 1932 | Surface science | Surface tension (Nature, 46, 437) 1891 | Wikipedia | Video | APS\n\nMaurice d'Ocagne (1862-1938)\n\nPolytechnicien (X1880). He held the chair of Professor of Geometry (1912-1937) at Polytechnique, preceeding Gaston Julia. Credited for the (lost) science of nomography (1884) in spite of the key rôles of Charles Lallemand (1857-1938; X1874) and Rodolphe Soreau (1865-1935; X1885).\n\nA.k.a. Philibert du Plessis | Playwright as Pierre Delix | d'Ocagne's identity | 2015 (French) | McT | WP\n\nHermann Minkowski (1864-1909)\n\nPioneering convex geometry, he proved an early version of the separation theorem (of Hahn-Banach) and called A+B the set of all sums with one addend in A and the other in B. His name was given to the Lp triangular inequality (1896) and to the relativistic scalar product in spacetime (1908).\n\nBrunn-Minkowski | Hasse-Minkowski |"
