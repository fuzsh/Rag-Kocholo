        "text": "most of all, Paris, where Lapicque was losing credit for his studies on chronaxie. Parisian neurophysiologist, Alfred Fessard (1900-1982) was the key figure in establishing a new school of neurophysiology in the lines of Edgar Adrian’s Department in Cambridge, which he joined in the late thirties. Fessard was initially a student of Henri Piéron involved in experimental psychology. He made parallel oscillographic studies of elementary activities in various animal and plant preparations. Since E-J Marey, French physiology paid much interest to the study of electric fish Torpedo. The continuous research in this field, up to the sixties, highlights how Fessard’s school joined international science and established scientific collaborations with foreign scientists. From early work with plant physiologist Daniel Auger, establishing the theory of chronaxie in Torpedo’s electric organ, Fessard isolated unitary potentials and studied their synchronisation. In 1939, Fessard invited David Nachm...\n\nThis article examines the science of electrophysiology developed by Emil du Bois-Reymond in Berlin in the 1840s. In it I recount his major findings, the most significant being his proof of the electrical nature of nerve signals. Du Bois-Reymond also went on to detect this same 'negative variation', or action current, in live human subjects. In 1850 he travelled to Paris to defend this startling claim. The essay concludes with a discussion of why his demonstration failed to convince his hosts at the French Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"[Finkelstein] shows convincingly why writing a biography of du Bois-Reymond is a worthwhile undertaking, not only by exploring the potentials of the biography genre but also due to the immense richness of his choice of subject: Few scientists had such extensive academic connections (mentors, colleagues, and students), held such a range of influential academic offices, led such a full and exemplarily bourgeois private life, lived in so many different European countries and commented so publicly on such a range of different issues, including science, politics, literature and art, and philosophy. Du Bois-Reymond had it all, and, for this reason, his life offers an unparalleled window into the cultural, scientific, and political life of nineteenth-century Europe.\"\n\nWe provide a historic outlook on the development of the concept of bioelectricity, with emphasis on the neuromuscular junction as a model that revolutionized our thinking of the nerve, nervous, and muscle tissue excitability. We abridge some crucial experiments in defining the electrical excitability of biological cells. We also provide an insight into developments of tools and methods, which gradually yielded a contemporary &quot;palette&quot; of electrophysiology approaches, including the patch clamp. Pioneering steps in this journey, ranging from Galvani&#39;s experiments using the Leyden jar to those of Neher and Sakmann using a gigaseal patch-clamp approach, are pictorially illustrated. This chapter is meant to be a perspective to the following sections in this volume dedicated to patch-clamp methods and protocols."
