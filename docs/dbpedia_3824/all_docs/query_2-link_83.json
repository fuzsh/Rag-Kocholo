This work is a key text in the history of the experimental life sciences. But it not only contains new findings about the functioning of muscles and its nerves. Du Bois-Reymond practiced an art of experimentation in which aesthetics of mechanical craftsmanship allied itself with the science of physiology. Experimentation, as du Bois-Reymond understood it, was simultaneously an epistemic and an aesthetic practice. The goal of his science was thus producing both knowledge and aesthetic success.

Biologies 329 (2006).\n\nThe du Bois sign.\n\nPubMed\n\nVoelpel, James H; Muehlberger, Thomas\n\n2011-03-01\n\nAccording to the current literature, the term \"du Bois sign\" characterizes the condition of a shortened fifth finger as a symptom of congenital syphilis, Down syndrome, dyscrania, and encephalic malformation. Modern medical dictionaries and text books attribute the eponym to the French gynecologist Paul Dubois (1795-1871). Yet, a literature analysis revealed incorrect references to the person and unclear definitions of the term. Our findings showed that the origin of the term is based on observations made by the Swiss dermatologist Charles du Bois (1874-1947) in connection with congenital syphilis. In addition, a further eponymical fifth finger sign is closely associated with the du Bois sign. In conclusion, the du Bois sign has only limited diagnostic value and is frequently occurring in the normal healthy population.\n\nNew European Learners?

His 1797 publication was a landmark for establishing the concept of animal electricity. Almost half a century later, von Humboldt became the mentor of the young du Bois-Reymond. With the help of von Humboldt's promotion, du Bois-Reymond demonstrated convincingly that animal tissue has the intrinsic capacity to generate electrical activity, and thus laid the ground for modern electrophysiology.\n\nW.E.B.

My lecture is based on ideas derived from my new book, The Scholar Denied: W.E.B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology. In this essay I make three arguments. First, W.E.B. Du Bois and his Atlanta School of Sociology pioneered scientific sociology in the United States. Second, Du Bois pioneered a public sociology that creatively combined sociology and activism. Finally, Du Bois pioneered a politically engaged social science relevant for contemporary political struggles including the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement.

Several relicts, such as important industrial buildings or sites, are spread over a large area and are still dominating the current landscape. Some of these remnants are preserved as monuments, representing the industrial, cultural and ecological transition of the region during the last two centuries. Since 2012, UNESCO recognized the importance of four of the best preserved 19th and 20th century coal mining sites and classified them as World Heritage (\"Major Mining Sites of Wallonia\", Le Grand-Hornu, Bois-du- Luc, Le Bois du Cazier and Blegny Mine). The four recognised mining sites together form a strip of about 170 km long, containing important examples of the so-called 'neo classical architecture' from the early periods of the industrial era in continental Europe. Motivated by this recognition and by the huge touristic and educational potential of the sites, a partnership between the Walloon government and Ghent University was organized. In this first stage, the collaboration focuses on the site of Bois-du-Luc in the municipality of La LouviÃ¨re, containing a large series of dwellings, several equipments built between 1853 and 1923 by the SociÃ©tÃ© des Charbonnages du Bois-du-Luc, workshops and heaps. Consisting of numerous buildings dating back to the period between 1838 and 1923, this site is one of Europe's oldest collieries. The collaboration between the Walloon government and Ghent University - Department of Geography fits in the hands-on training which students in land surveying and geomatics receive during their Bachelor studies. For the students it is very interesting that their practical exercises are not limited to the university campus, but that they are involved in a real measurement campaign. The project consists of a series of intensive land surveying campaigns, resulting in highly detailed and accurate\n\nFormulation, caracterisation, modelisation et prevision du comportement thermomecanique des pieces plastiques et composites de fibres de bois : Application aux engrenages =\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMijiyawa, Faycal\n\nCette etude permet d'adapter des materiaux composites thermoplastiques a fibres de bois aux engrenages, de fabriquer de nouvelles generations d'engrenages et de predire le comportement thermique de ces engrenages.

This paper takes this development as an occasion to reflect on how social thought works with (and against) nineteenth-century intellectual traditions in its efforts to understand history on a macro scale. Karl Jaspers, who initially formulated the axial age thesis in The Origin and Goal of History , revised the Hegelian account of world history by broadening the scope of the narrative to encompass all civilizations participating in the events of the first millennium BCE that saw the rise of major philosophical and religious traditions. However, his account, like the earlier philosophical accounts he seeks to improve upon, privileges cognitive developments over material practices and social interactions, and as such offers little to those seeking to make sense of how cultural patterns interact with others and spread. Here another social theorist engaging with Hegel, W. E. B. Du Bois, provides a helpful contrast. His account of the development of double-consciousness in \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings,\" the opening chapter of The Souls of Black Folk , helps us to understand experiences of encounter and the perduring historical effects they may have. Du Bois' relational theory reminds us of the importance of unpacking abstractions and understanding processes in terms of social interactions.\n\n[The history of the concept of vital force].\n\nPubMed\n\nLohff, B\n\n1981-12-01\n\nThis article deals with the term \"Lebenskraft - vital force' from the terminological point of view (life vs. force), as well as from the historical one-(1774-1848), also considering the place this term occupies in colloquial speech. This term, however, first introduced into medicine by Kasimir Medicus in 1774, cannot be defined in a philosophical sense. Historically though, it can be proved that four different starting positions have caused the different ways of interpreting this \"vital force'. Alongside the physical interpretations, i.e. the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile, there were some reflections on the chemical mode of action (chemical dynamism, J.Chr. Reil). Another aspect developed from the irritability concept (G.R. Treviranus); furthermore a special interpretation resulted from the microcosmos-macrocosmos-analogy (Fr.L. Augustin). Thus these different positions had influenced the investigations carried out in the fields of biochemistry, neuro-physiology and comparative anatomy. Since the investigations of Emil Du Bois-Reymond and his articles on \"Lebenskraft' the term and the hypothesis of vital force was no longer of scientific importance. The term lived on in colloquial speech and thus became a characteristic of the difference between a scientific and non scientific approach to life.\n\nOf Victorianism, Civilizationism, and Progressivism: The Educational Ideas of Anna Julia Cooper and W.E.B.

Elisabeth Caland and the physio-aesthetics of piano playing].\n\nPubMed\n\nHerrgott, Gerhard\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe issue of how it is possible to play the piano without striking it was raised by Chopin: one must 'caresser' and not 'frapper' the piano. In her teachings on the art of piano playing, Elisabeth Caland (1862-1929) attempts to articulate a scientifically grounded solution to this complex (kin-)aesthetic problem. The solution turns on her intuitively discovered 'lowering of the shoulderblades' which was documented in 1904, through X-rays, by the Berlin physiologist RenÃ© du Bois-Reymond, and recorded as a way of coordinating movement which had been unknown to physiology up to that time. Caland's physio-aesthetic of piano playing, which she worked out on the basis of du Bois-Reymond's observations, turns on the ideal of 'floating sound' put forward by her teacher Ludwig Deppe, and on Ferruccio Busoni's technique of piano playing. Her method makes essential use of what Feldenkrais would later call the 'sixth sense' (i.e. proprioceptive perception); in fact, it represents the first modern kinaesthetically based conception of piano playing. Caland's doctrine of touch was ahead of its time and it virtually disappeared from discussions of piano technique after 1930. But it has become accessible again through reprints of her most important writings: Deppe's doctrine of piano playing (1897), Sources of power in piano playing (1904), and Artistic piano playing (1910).\n\nModelization des consequences possibles de la future demande bioenergetique mondiale pour le bois et les forest en France\n\nTreesearch\n\nJoseph Buongiorno; Ronald Raunikar; Shushuai Zhu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLÃ¢ÂÂarticle prÃÂ©sente une exploration, menÃÂ©e au moyen dÃ¢ÂÂun modÃÂ¨le mondial de la filiÃÂ¨re-bois, de lÃ¢ÂÂeffet sur la filiÃÂ¨re-bois franÃÂ§aise des modifications actuelles et prÃÂ©visibles de la demande mondiale en ÃÂ©nergie issue de la biomasse.

Among the notable are Charles Bell's (1774-1842) and FranÃ§ois Magendie's (1783-1855) identification of sensory and motor pathways, Thomas Henry Huxley's (1825-1895) elaboration of evolutionary theory in the context of comparative neuroanatomy, and Emile Du Bois-Reymond's (1818-1896) and Hermann von Helmholtz's (1821-1894) work in experimental neurophysiology and on the concept of nervous energy. In Germany, the idea that the nervous system consisted of two elements, one that generated nervous energy and another that conducted it throughout the body, had wide currency in mid-nineteenth century. In France, Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (1757-1808), physician, philosopher, and one of the founders of modern psychophysiology, argued that the brain is the part of the body in which electricity is stored. In his Rapports du Physique et du Moral de l'Homme, published between 1796 and 1802 (translated into German under the title VerhÃ¤ltnis der Seele zum KÃ¶rper (1808)), Cabanis proposed new ideas on brain function, on the brain's own sensibility, on the concept of will, and on the chemical basis of nervous activity. In the Rapports Cabanis proposed a theory of how brain and nerves relate to thought and behavior. Foreshadowing later developments in neuropsychology, he suggested that different parts of the nervous system have separate functions. Despite the fact that Cabanis had many interesting ideas about brain function, he has been largely ignored by historians of neuroscience; e. g., he is mentioned briefly in Clark and Jacyna (1989), in only two footnotes in Neuburger (1897/1981), and not at all in Finger (1994). Cabanis's far-reaching theory of how the brain works helped shape understanding of the general notion of nervous energy in nineteenth-century European neuroscience.\n\nW. E. B.

With his worldview and wishing to learn more, he studied electric eels in South America just as the new century began, again using his body as a scientific instrument in many of his experiments. As had been the case in the past and for many of the same reasons, some of his findings with the electric eel (and soon after, Italian torpedoes) seemed to argue against biological electricity. But he no longer used galvanic terminology when describing his electric fish experiments. The fact that he now wrote about animal electricity rather than a different \"galvanic\" force owed much to Alessandro Volta, who had come forth with his \"pile\" (battery) for multipling the physical and perceptable effects of otherwise weak electricity in 1800, while Humboldt was deep in South America. Humboldt probably read about and saw voltaic batteries in the United States in 1804, but the time he spent with Volta in 1805 was probably more significant in his conversion from a galvanic to an electrical framework for understanding nerve and muscle physiology. Although he did not continue his animal electricity research program after this time, Humboldt retained his worldview of a unified nature and continued to believe in intrinsic animal electricity. He also served as a patron to some of the most important figures in the new field of electrophysiology (e.g., Hermann Helmholtz and Emil du Bois-Reymond), helping to take the research that he had participated in to the next level.\n\n[Freud's letters to Emil und Mira Oberholzer (1912-1936)].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchrÃ¶ter, Michael\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe 36 letters edited in this contribution touch on Emil O.'s analysis with Freud, on referrals of patients, small favors and Emil O.'s presidency of the Swiss psychoanalytical society (SGPsa) 1919-1928.

Emile facilitates student programming and model-building with software-realized scaffolding (SRS). Emile integrates a range of SRS and provides mechanisms to fade (or diminish) most scaffolding. By fading Emile's SRS, students can adapt support to their individual needs. Programming in Emile involves graphic and text elements (as compared with more traditional text-based programming). For example, students create graphical objects which can be dragged on the screen, and when dropped, fall as if in a gravitational field. Emile supports a simplified, HyperCard-like mixed media programming framework. Scaffolding is defined as support which enables student performance (called the immediate benefit of scaffolding) and which facilitates student learning (called the lasting benefit of scaffolding). Scaffolding provides this support through three methods: Modeling, coaching, and eliciting articulation. For example, Emile has tools to structure the programming task (modeling), menus identify the next step in the programming and model-building process (coaching), and prompts for student plans and predictions (eliciting articulation). Five students used Emile in a summer workshop (45 hours total) focusing on creating kinematics simulations and multimedia demonstrations. Evaluation of Emile's scaffolding addressed use of scaffolding and the expected immediate and lasting benefits. Emile created records of student interactions (log files) which were analyzed to determine how students used Emile's SRS and how they faded that scaffolding. Student projects and articulations about those projects were analyzed to assess success of student's model-building and programming activities. Clinical interviews were conducted before and after the workshop to determine students' conceptualizations of kinematics and\n\nThe Moral Education of Emile.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJohn, G.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAnalyzes the educational philosophy in Rousseau's \"Emile\" and its influence on the secularization of French moral education during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Following this perspective, the germ cells of 19th century institutes of experimental physiology were particularly found in the metropolises of Paris, Leipzig or Berlin. Only the major cities sat the revolutionary trends and within this general process, the scientific trends were no exceptions - the provincial research universities simply followed the central ones in their normal science endeavours. Due to this interpretation, the development of the scientific community was pre-formatted as the interplay of innovation (the city) and reception (the periphery). Isidor Rosenthal (1836-1915) was born in Labischin (District of Bromberg/Posen) in 1836 and got his medical training in Berlin. Like not many other experimental physiologists, he can be used as a historiographical testing probe, to follow the conditions of knowledge transfer from center to periphery: After his studies at the Friedrich Wilhelms University and the completion of his dissertation in 1859, Rosenthal entered the newly founded Physiological Institute in Berlin as the first Research Associate of Emil DuBois-Reymond (1818-1896). Rosenthal worked here particularly on the problem of \"direct and indirect muscle irritation\" in frogs. These neurophysiological investigations led to his growing scientific renown. In 1872, Rosenthal became offered a first professorship in physiology at the Friedrich Alexander University in Bavaria, as one of only few Jewish scientists (and even before Wilhelm Wundt, 1832-1920). But his life and work proved not only exceptional because of his scientific achievements, but also due to his deep rootedness in cultural life--both during his time in Berlin and in Erlangen. By applying a comparative and microhistorical approach in this article, the working conditions of this\n\nVersatile Photocatalytic Systems for H2 Generation in Water Based on an Efficient DuBois-Type Nickel Catalyst\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe generation of renewable H2 through an efficient photochemical route requires photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from a light harvester to an efficient electrocatalyst in water. Here, we report on a molecular H2 evolution catalyst (NiP) with a DuBois-type [Ni(P2Râ²N2Râ³)2]2+ core (P2Râ²N2Râ³ = bis(1,5-Râ²-diphospha-3,7-Râ³-diazacyclooctane), which contains an outer coordination sphere with phosphonic acid groups. The latter functionality allows for good solubility in water and immobilization on metal oxide semiconductors. Electrochemical studies confirm that NiP is a highly active electrocatalyst in aqueous electrolyte solution (overpotential of approximately 200 mV at pH 4.5 with a Faradaic yield of 85 Â± 4%). Photocatalytic experiments and investigations on the ET kinetics were carried out in combination with a phosphonated Ru(II) tris(bipyridine) dye (RuP) in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. Time-resolved luminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy studies confirmed that directed ET from RuP to NiP occurs efficiently in all systems on the nano- to microsecond time scale, through three distinct routes: reductive quenching of RuP in solution or on the surface of ZrO2 (âon particleâ system) or oxidative quenching of RuP when the compounds were immobilized on TiO2 (âthrough particleâ system). Our studies show that NiP can be used in a purely aqueous solution and on a semiconductor surface with a high degree of versatility. A high TOF of 460 Â± 60 hâ1 with a TON of 723 Â± 171 for photocatalytic H2 generation with a molecular Ni catalyst in water and a photon-to-H2 quantum yield of approximately 10% were achieved for the homogeneous system.

This paper shows that what was primarily at stake for these authors was a concern about the irreducibility of life and the mind to physics, and that their theories can be regarded primarily as reactions to the law of conservation of energy, which was used among others by Helmholtz and Du Bois-Reymond as an argument against the possibility of vital and mental causes in physiology. In light of this development, Maxwell, Stewart, Cournot and Boussinesq showed that it was still possible to argue for the irreducibility of life and the mind to physics, through an appeal to instability or indeterminism in physics: if the body is an unstable or physically indeterministic system, an immaterial principle can act through triggering or directing motions in the body, without violating the laws of physics.\n\nBois Forte Indoor Air Quality Program\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThe Bois Forte Indoor Air Quality Program acted swiftly and aggressively to tackle mold and moisture problems in its community membersâ homes after several residents became ill as a result of environmental exposures.\n\nRousseau's \"Emile\", or the Fear of Passions\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTrohler, Daniel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNotwithstanding the general accepted understanding that Rousseau is the master of modern education reflecting the progress by enlightenment this articles suggests that Rousseau's \"Emile\" is--as most of Rousseau's other writings are, too--testimony to a brilliant and passionate writer expressing thoughts about his concern how to deal withâ¦\n\nDense Medium Ore Concentrates of Bois-Noirs; MINERAIS DES BOIS NOIRS CONCENTRES DE MILIEU DENSE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLe Bris, J.; Leduc, M.\n\n1959-01-01\n\nThe chemical treatment of uranium concentrates of BoisNoirs ore obtained by heavy medium are discussed.

For him, virtual reality functioned as a bottomless container in which he was no longer a victim of bullying but rather a god. When the boundlessness of cyberspace encounters a \"black hole\" in the psyche, any fantasies can be put into virtual realization and actions. By recounting his wickedness, violence, destructiveness, and perversion, Emile could start restoring his self boundaries and create his own autobiographical narrative. Unable to sustain the pain of mourning his envelope of invulnerability and omnipotence, however, he prematurely terminated analysis.

To obtain thin stillage, corn was fermented using laboratory methods. UF experiments were conducted in batch mode under constant temperature and flow rate conditions. Two regenerated cellulose membranes (10 and 100Â kDa molecular weight cutoffs) were evaluated with the objective of retaining solids as well as maximizing permeate flux. Optimum pressures for 10 and 100Â kDa membranes were 207 and 69Â kPa, respectively. Total solids, ash, and neutral detergent fiber contents of input TS streams of dry grind and E-Mill processes were similar; however, fat and protein contents were different (pâ<â0.05). Retentate obtained from conventional thin stillage fractionation had higher mean total solids contents (27.6% to 27.8%) compared to E-Mill (22.2% to 23.4%). Total solids in retentate streams were found similar to those from commercial evaporators used in industry (25% to 35% total solids). Fat contents of retentate streams ranged from 16.3% to 17.5% for the conventional process. A 2% increment in fat concentration was observed in the E-Mill retentate stream.

D. A.\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThis thesis follows the career of the law of energy conservation in German science and culture between 1847 and 1914. There is an interesting contrast between the initial reception of Hermann Helmholtzâ 1847 treatise âÃber die Erhaltung der Kraftâ, which was rejected by the editor of the Annalen der Physik, and its later status as a classic of science. âEnergyâ was the shared concept of the disciplines. It was used by physiologists, physicists, psychologists, sociologists and philosophers. Moreover, the law of energy conservation also made a huge cultural impact. The period around 1900 has justly been called an energetic era. Why did the law of energy conservation become such a universal success? The obvious way to explain this success would be to say: because it is true, and subsequently comment upon its great scientific value. This thesis adopts a different perspective. It adopts Wittgensteinâs definition of meaning as use in language. Consequently, the meaning of the law is only referred to in relation to the way in which it was put to use in communicative practice. From this perspective it is immediately evident that the understanding of the law of energy conservation was subject to considerable change. Helmholtz initially conceptualized the law in terms of atoms and forces; Gustav Kirchhoff and Ernst Mach, rejected atoms and forces as hypothetical entities and they preferred to use the more mundane concept of work instead; Wilhelm Ostwald, finally, thought of energy as an immaterial substance. This thesis meticulously follows the changes in use and understanding to which the law was subject as it penetrated German science and culture. Communication and interests, rather than natural essences, are the central explanatory concepts of the thesis. From 1847 onwards Helmholtz and Du Bois-Reymond actively sought to spread the law of energy conservation among their colleagues and the general public. They told their fellow physiologists, for example, that\n\nHistorical Perspectives on Biographies for Children as Content for Multicultural Education.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMorgan, Harry\n\nBooker T.

The methods used are hydrochemical modeling, stable-isotope analysis, and chemical analysis of surface water and groundwater. Sampling during high- and low-water periods determined the spatial distribution of the water chemistry, whereas monthly sampling over three years provided a basis for understanding seasonal variability. The physico-chemical parameters of the groundwater have spatial and seasonal variations. The groundwater chemical composition of the Rhone alluvial aquifer indicates a mixing of weakly mineralized Rhone River water and SO4-rich water entering from the south side of the valley. Temporal changes in groundwater chemistry and in groundwater levels reflect the seasonal variations of the different contributors to groundwater recharge. The Rhone River recharges the alluvial aquifer only during the summer high-water period. RÃ©sumÃ©.

Emphysema can be associated with IPF as described in the Â«Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysemaÂ» syndrome. The primary endpoint of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the impact of the association of IPF and emphysema on lung function tests parameters (FVC, TLC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and DLCO). The secondary endpoint was to assess the impact of the associated radiological emphysema on lung function parameters used in the du Bois prognostic score recently developed by Ron du Bois etÂ al. We retrospectively reviewed the medical files of 98 patients with lung fibrosis who were followed in our University Hospital with access to pharmacological studies and lung transplantation from 1981 to 2011. Fifty six patients were considered for analysis. The collected data included gender, age, smoking history and respiratory hospitalizations. We also analysed their pulmonary functional parameters along with radiological characteristics, in particular the presence of emphysema which was assessed on thoracic high resolution CT scan. The du Bois score was retrospectively calculated from these data. TLC and FVC at diagnosis were significantly higher in the IPF-E group compared to the IPF group (respectively 86.6Â Â±Â 17.2% pv versus 72.0Â Â±Â 15.0% pv; p: 0.004 and 86.8Â Â±Â 18.4% pv versus 72.6Â Â±Â 20.6% pv; p: 0.020). The [Formula: see text] used in the calculation of the du Bois prognostic score was significantly higher in the IPF-E group. By cons, [Formula: see text] was not statistically different between the two groups. Radiological emphysema associated with IPF had an impact on pulmonary function tests. Despite this difference, the du Bois score was not statistically different between these two groups. Nevertheless, after one year of follow up, the patients with emphysema were in a subclass with a lower mortality rate than those without emphysema.

The Nobel Prize is today widely considered as the most prestigious international symbol of scientific excellence, but it still is an exciting research question how it gained such prestige. Drawing on files from the Emil von Behring Archive in Marburg, Germany, and the Archive of the Nobel Assembly for Physiology or Medicine in Stockholm this essay aims at shedding light on why the first Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1901 was awarded the German immunologist Emil von Behring, and how this decision was viewed at that time. This study is part of a research project that explores mechanisms leading to scientific recognition by using the example of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

For each gender, 135 subjects were drawn. The sampling was stratified in five stature heights and three body weights according to a previous survey. The 3D body surface shape was measured using an innovated 3D body scanner and a high resolution hand/foot scanner, the total body surface area (BSA) and segmental body surface area (SBSA) were computed based on the summation of every tiny triangular area of triangular meshes of the scanned surface; and the accuracy of BSA measurement is below 1%. The results of BSA and sixteen SBSAs were tabulated in fifteen strata for the Male, the Female and the Total (two genders combined). The %SBSA data was also used to revise new Lund and Browder Charts. The comparison of BSA shows that the BSA of this study is comparable with the Du Bois and Du Bois' but smaller than that of Tikuisis et al. The difference might be attributed to body size difference between the samples. The comparison of SBSA shows that the differences of SBSA between this study and the Lund and Browder Chart range between 0.00% and 2.30%. A new BSA estimation formula, BSA=71.3989 x H(.7437) x W(.4040), was obtained. An accuracy test showed that this formula has smaller estimation error than that of the Du Bois and Du Bois'; and significantly better than other BSA estimation formulae.\n\nMathematical Physics in the Style of Gabriel LamÃ© and the Treatise of Emile Mathieu\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbin, Ãvelyne; Guitart, RenÃ©\n\nThe Treatise of Mathematical Physics of Emile Mathieu, published from 1873 to 1890, provided an exposition of the specific French \"Mathematical Physics\" inherited from LamÃ©, himself an heir of Poisson, Fourier, and Laplace.

From his studies on the effects of electricity on frogs, the scientist of Bologna derived the hypothesis that animal tissues are endowed with an intrinsic electricity that is involved in fundamental physiological processes such as nerve conduction and muscle contraction. Galvani's work swept away from life sciences mysterious fluids and elusive entities like \"animal spirits\" and led to the foundation of a new science, electrophysiology. Two centuries of research work have demonstrated how insightful was Galvani's conception of animal electricity. Nevertheless, the scholar of Bologna is still largely misrepresented in the history of science, because the importance of his researches seems to be limited to the fact that they opened the paths to the studies of the physicist Alessandro Volta, which culminated in 1800 with the invention of the electric battery. Volta strongly opposed Galvani's theories on animal electricity. The matter of the scientific controversy between Galvani and Volta is examined here in the light of two centuries of electrophysiological studies leading to the modern understanding of electrical excitability in nerve and muscle. By surveying the work of scientists such as Nobili, Matteucci, du Bois-Reymond, von Helmholtz, Bernstein, Hermann, Lucas, Adrian, Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz, the real matter of the debate raised by Galvani's discoveries is here reconsidered. In addition, a revolutionary phase of the 18th century science that opened the way for the development of modern neurosciences is reevaluated.\n\nLatin American Special Economic Zones and Their Impacts on Regional Security\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-06-01\n\n25 Emile Durkheim and W.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identity and biological properties, group 16SrXII encompasses several species, including 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense', 'Candidatus Phytoplasma japonicum' and 'Candidatus Phytoplasma fragariae'. Other group 16SrXII phytoplasma strains are associated with stolbur disease in wild and cultivated herbaceous and woody plants and with bois noir disease in grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.). Such latter strains have been informally proposed to represent a separate species, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma solani', but a formal description of this taxon has not previously been published. In the present work, stolbur disease strain STOL11 (STOL) was distinguished from reference strains of previously described species of the 'Candidatus Phytoplasma' genus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and a unique signature sequence in the 16S rRNA gene. Other stolbur- and bois noir-associated ('Ca. Phytoplasma solani') strains shared >99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with strain STOL11 and contained the signature sequence. 'Ca. Phytoplasma solani' is the only phytoplasma known to be transmitted by Hyalesthes obsoletus. Insect vectorship and molecular characteristics are consistent with the concept that diverse 'Ca. Phytoplasma solani' strains share common properties and represent an ecologically distinct gene pool. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, tuf, secY and rplV-rpsC gene sequences supported this view and yielded congruent trees in which 'Ca. Phytoplasma solani' strains formed, within the group 16SrXII clade, a monophyletic subclade that was most closely related to, but distinct from, that of 'Ca.

He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of the Jagiellonian University with the title of Doctor of Medical Science. He worked at the Faculty of Medicine, first in the Institute of Descriptive Anatomy and later as Professor of Biology and Embryology in the Department of Biology and Embryology, which he founded and led for many years. After early research on the development and histogenesis of muscles, professor Godlewski's scientific interests focused on regeneration and mechanisms regulating the process of fertilization, as well as early embryo development, blastulation and gastrulation. He was also interested in the origin of the primary differentiating cells in regenerates. He postulated the importance of epithelial tissue in this process and was the first to point out the change in the function, organization and role of the cells under the influence of external stimuli. Investigating fertilization and early development, he focused on the cooperation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the regulation of the early stages of development. Godlewski was also the author of the theory of migration of the inherited substances from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and, after their processing, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. His works were never fragmentary, but always synthetical attempts at explaining important issues relating to the mechanisms of development. In 1936 Professor Godlewski was awarded the title of Member of the Pontifica Accademia delle Scienze. Apart from doing research and teaching, Emil Godlewski devoted a lot of time to social issues, especially those connected to medicine. When Poland regained independence after World War I, he actively participated in the reopening of the Jagiellonian University.\n\nVolatile composition of some Brazilian fruits: umbu-caja (Spondias citherea), camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia), AraÃ§a-boi (Eugenia stipitata), and CupuaÃ§u (Theobroma grandiflorum).\n\nPubMed\n\nFranco, M R; Shibamoto, T\n\n2000-04-01\n\nTwenty-one volatile compounds were identified for the first time by GC-MS in umbu-caja and in camu-camu, plus 30 volatile compounds were identified in araÃ§a-boi samples.

In a recent article, James M. DuBois is concerned that academic critiques of current death criteria create unnecessary doubt about the moral acceptability of organ donation, which may affect the public's willingness to donate. Thus he calls for a closing of the debate on current death criteria and for journal editors to publish only critiques that \"substantially engage and advance the debate.\" We argue that such positions as DuBois' are a threat to responsible scholarship in medical ethics, especially scholarship that opposes popular stances, because it erodes academic freedom and the necessity of debate on an issue that is literally a matter of life and death, no matter what side a person defends.\n\nA comparison of linear respiratory system models based on parameter estimates from PRN forced oscillation data.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiong, B; Grainger, J; Goldman, M; Nazeran, H\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe forced oscillation technique offers some advantages over spirometry for assessing pulmonary function.

In particular, the data can be used to obtain parameter estimates for electric circuit-based models of the respiratory system, which can in turn aid the detection and diagnosis of various diseases/pathologies. In this study, we compare the least-squares error performance of the RIC, extended RIC, augmented RIC, augmented RIC+I(p), DuBois, Nagels and Mead models in fitting 3 sets of impedance data. These data were obtained by pseudorandom noise forced oscillation of healthy subjects, mild asthmatics and more severe asthmatics.

He was one of the most diligent French authors in the nineteenth century and had a huge knowledge of modern and ancient languages, medicine, science, history, and philosophy. Apart from the dictionary, his most impressive work was the edition and translation of the complete collection of the Hippocratic writings (1839-61). The translation was meant to serve as a textbook for French doctors, but the rapid development in medicine made it obsolete in that respect before it was completed. Instead it is now a philological and historical monument. LittrÃ© also published a large number of books and articles on positivism, history, politics, philology, and medicine. He was politically active as supporter of the French republic during the periods of monarchy and was elected lifelong senator of the French National Assembly after the 1870-71 war. He was elected member of the French Academy in spite of intense opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. He was an atheist, but was baptised on his deathbed by his wife.
