The document summarizes several fundamental theorems in mathematics across different fields, including:\n\n1) The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization. \n\n2) Pythagoras' theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\n3) The fundamental theorem of calculus, which relates derivatives and integrals and allows one to compute definite integrals using antiderivatives. \n\n4) The fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every polynomial of degree n has n complex roots, counted with multiplicity.",
