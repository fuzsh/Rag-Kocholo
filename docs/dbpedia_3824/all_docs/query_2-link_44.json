        "text": "Education\n\nPh.D. University of Illinois, Chicago\n\nResearch\n\nAreas of Specialization or Competence\n\nLogic\n\nHistory and Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nPhilosophy of Science\n\nPhilosophy of Physics\n\nIn his paper Recent Work On The Principles of Mathematics, which appeared in 1901, Bertrand Russell reported that the three central problems of traditional mathematical philosophy--the nature of the infinite, the nature of the infinitesimal, and the nature of the continuum--had all been “completely solved” [1901, p. 89]. Indeed, as Russell went on to add: “The solutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to leave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty” [1901, p. 89].\n\nAccording to Russell, the structure of the infinite and the continuum were completely revealed by Cantor and Dedekind, and the concept of an infinitesimal had been found to be incoherent and was “banish[ed] from mathematics” through the work of Weierstrass and others [1901, pp. 88, 90]. These themes were reiterated in Russell’s often reprinted Mathematics and the Metaphysician [1918], and further developed in both editions of Russell’s The Principles of Mathematics [1903; 1937], the works which perhaps more than any other helped to promulgate these ideas among historians and philosophers of mathematics.\n\nHaving been persuaded that infinitesimals had indeed been “banished” from mathematics and that the problems of the infinite and the continuum had been completely solved, Russell and most other analytic philosophers of mathematics after him turned their attention to finding a secure foundation for the newly developed theories of the infinite and the continuum and for mathematics, more generally.\n\nMore than twenty years ago, however, I started to realize that the historical picture painted by Russell and others was not only historically inaccurate, but that the work done by Dedekind, while revolutionary, only revealed a glimpse of a far richer theory of continua that not only allows for infinitesimals but leads to a vast generalization of portions Cantor’s theory of the infinite, a generalization that also provides a setting for Abraham Robinson’s infinitesimal approach to analysis [1961; 1966] as well as for the profound and all too often overlooked non-Cantorian theories of the infinite (and infinitesimal) pioneered by Giuseppe Veronese [1891; 1894], Tullio Levi-Civita [1892; 1898], David Hilbert [1899] and Hans Hahn [1907] in connection with their work on non-Archimedean ordered algebraic and geometric systems and by Paul du Bois-Reymond (cf. [1870-71;1875; 1877; 1882]), Otto Stolz [1883; 1885], Felix Hausdorff [1907; 1909] and G. H. Hardy [1910; 1912] in connection with their work on the rate of growth of real functions. Central to the theory is J.H. Conway’s theory of surreal numbers [1976; 2001], and the present author’s amplifications and generalizations thereof and other contributions thereto.\n\nSince that time, the bulk of my research has been devoted to developing the theory, rewriting the related history, and working out the implications of this work for the philosophy of geometry, the philosophy of number, the philosophy of the infinite and the infinitesimal, the theory of measurement and the philosophy of space and time.\n\nAwards\n\nOhio University Presidential Research Scholar in Arts and Humanities (2002-2007)\n\nNational Science Foundation Scholars Award (# SBR-0724700) (2007-11)\n\nNational Science Foundation Scholars Award (#SBR-9602154)(1996-99)\n\nNational Science Foundation Scholars Award (#SBR-9223839)(1993-95)\n\nOhio University Professional Development Award (Fall 1999)\n\nOhio University Professional Development Award (Spring 1998)\n\nOhio University Professional Development Award (Fall 1996)\n\nHonors\n\nAssociate of Center for Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh (1999-)\n\nFellowships\n\nVisiting Fellow, Center for the Philosophy of Science (Winter, 2002), University of Pittsburgh.\n\nResearch Fellow, Center for the Philosophy and History of Science (1992-1993), Boston University, Boston, MA.\n\nPublications\n\nArticles\n\n“The Absolute Arithmetic Continuum and the Unification of All Numbers Great and Small”, The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic 18 (1) 2012, pp. 1-45.
