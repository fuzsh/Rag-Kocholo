        "text": "General relativity\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation and to understand the background to the theory we have to look at how theories of gravitation developed. Aristotle‘s notion of the motion of bodies impeded understanding of gravitation for a long time. He believed that force could only be applied by contact; force at a distance being impossible, and a constant force was required to maintain a body in uniform motion.\n\nCopernicus‘s view of the solar system was important as it allowed sensible consideration of gravitation. Kepler‘s laws of planetary motion and Galileo‘s understanding of the motion and falling bodies set the scene for Newton‘s theory of gravity which was presented in the Principia in 1687. Newton‘s law of gravitation is expressed by\n\nF = G M1M2/d2\n\nwhere F is the force between the bodies of masses M1, M2 and d is the distance between them. G is the universal gravitational constant.\n\nAfter receiving their definitive analytic form from Euler, Newton‘s axioms of motion were reworked by Lagrange, Hamilton, and Jacobi into very powerful and general methods, which employed new analytic quantities, such as potential, related to force but remote from everyday experience. Newton‘s universal gravitation was considered proved correct, thanks to the work of Clairaut and Laplace. Laplace looked at the stability of the solar system in Traité du Mécanique Céleste in 1799. In fact the so-called three-body problem was extensively studied in the 19th Century and was not properly understood until much later. The study of the gravitational potential allowed variations in gravitation caused by irregularities in the shape of the earth to be studied both practically and theoretically. Poisson used the gravitational potential approach to give an equation which, unlike Newton‘s, could be solved under rather general conditions.\n\nNewton‘s theory of gravitation was highly successful. There was little reason to question it except for one weakness which was to explain how each of the two bodies knew the other was there. Some profound remarks about gravitation were made by Maxwell in 1864. His major work A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field (1864) was written\n\n… to explain the electromagnetic action between distant bodies without assuming the existence of forces capable of acting directly at sensible distances.\n\nAt the end of the work Maxwell comments on gravitation.\n\nAfter tracing to the action of the surrounding medium both the magnetic and the electric attractions and repulsions, and finding them to depend on the inverse square of the distance, we are naturally led to inquire whether the attraction of gravitation, which follows the same law of the distance, is not also traceable to the action of a surrounding medium.\n\nHowever Maxwell notes that there is a paradox caused by the attraction of like bodies. The energy of the medium must be decreased by the presence of the bodies and Maxwell said\n\nAs I am unable to understand in what way a medium can possess such properties, I cannot go further in this direction in searching for the cause of gravitation.\n\nIn 1900 Lorentz conjectured that gravitation could be attributed to actions which propagate with the velocity of light. Poincaré, in a paper in July 1905 (submitted days before Einstein‘s special relativity paper), suggested that all forces should transform according the Lorentz transformations. In this case he notes that Newton‘s law of gravitation is not valid and proposed gravitational waves which propagated with the velocity of light.\n\nIn 1907, two years after proposing the special theory of relativity, Einsteinwas preparing a review of special relativity when he suddenly wondered how Newtonian gravitation would have to be modified to fit in with special relativity. At this point there occurred to Einstein, described by him as the happiest thought of my life , namely that an observer who is falling from the roof of a house experiences no gravitational field. He proposed the Equivalence Principle as a consequence:-\n\n… we shall therefore assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and the corresponding acceleration of the reference frame. This assumption extends the principle of relativity to the case of uniformly accelerated motion of the reference frame.\n\nAfter the major step of the equivalence principle in 1907, Einstein published nothing further on gravitation until 1911. Then he realised that the bending of light in a gravitational field, which he knew in 1907 was a consequence of the equivalence principle, could be checked with astronomical observations. He had only thought in 1907 in terms of terrestrial observations where there seemed little chance of experimental verification. Also discussed at this time is the gravitational redshift, light leaving a massive body will be shifted towards the red by the energy loss of escaping the gravitational field.\n\nEinstein published further papers on gravitation in 1912. In these he realised that the Lorentz transformations will not apply in this more general setting. Einstein also realised that the gravitational field equations were bound to be non-linear and the equivalence principle appeared to only hold locally.\n\nThis work by Einstein prompted others to produce gravitational theories. Work by Nordström, Abraham and Mie was all a consequence of Einstein‘s, so far failed, attempts to find a satisfactory theory. However Einstein realised his problems.\n\nIf all accelerated systems are equivalent, then Euclidean geometry cannot hold in all of them.\n\nEinstein then remembered that he had studied Gauss‘s theory of surfaces as a student and suddenly realised that the foundations of geometry have physical significance. He consulted his friend Grossmann who was able to tell Einstein of the important developments of Riemann, Ricci (Ricci-Curbastro) and Levi-Civita. Einstein wrote\n\n… in all my life I have not laboured nearly so hard, and I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now.\n\nIn 1913 Einstein and Grossmann published a joint paper where the tensor calculus of Ricci and Levi-Civita is employed to make further advances. Grossmann gave Einstein the Riemann–Christoffel tensor which, together with the Ricci tensor which can be derived from it, were to become the major tools in the future theory. Progress was being made in that gravitation was described for the first time by the metric tensor but still the theory was not right. When Planck visited Einstein in 1913 and Einstein told him the present state of his theories Planck said\n\nAs an older friend I must advise you against it for in the first place you will not succeed, and even if you succeed no one will believe you.\n\nPlanck was wrong, but only just, for when Einstein was to succeed with his theory it was not readily accepted. It was the second half of 1915 that saw Einstein finally put the theory in place. Before that however he had written a paper in October 1914 nearly half of which is a treatise on tensor analysis and differential geometry. This paper led to a correspondence between Einstein and Levi-Civita in which Levi-Civita pointed out technical errors in Einstein‘s work on tensors. Einstein was delighted to be able to exchange ideas with Levi-Civita whom he found much more sympathetic to his ideas on relativity than his other colleagues.\n\nAt the end of June 1915 Einstein spent a week at Göttingen where he lectured for six 2 hour sessions on his (incorrect) October 1914 version of general relativity. Hilbert and Klein attended his lectures and Einsteincommented after leaving Göttingen\n\nTo my great joy, I succeeded in convincing Hilbert and Kleincompletely.\n\nThe final steps to the theory of general relativity were taken by Einstein and Hilbert at almost the same time. Both had recognised flaws in Einstein‘s October 1914 work and a correspondence between the two men took place in November 1915. How much they learnt from each other is hard to measure but the fact that they both discovered the same final form of the gravitational field equations within days of each other must indicate that their exchange of ideas was helpful.\n\nOn the 18th November he made a discovery about which he wrote For a few days I was beside myself with joyous excitement . The problem involved the advance of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. Le Verrier, in 1859, had noted that the perihelion (the point where the planet is closest to the sun) advanced by 38″ per century more than could be accounted for from other causes. Many possible solutions were proposed, Venus was 10% heavier than was thought, there was another planet inside Mercury’s orbit, the sun was more oblate than observed, Mercury had a moon and, really the only one not ruled out by experiment, that Newton‘s inverse square law was incorrect. This last possibility would replace the 1/d2 by 1/dp, where p = 2+ε for some very small number ε. By 1882 the advance was more accurately known, 43” per century. From 1911 Einstein had realised the importance of astronomical observations to his theories and he had worked with Freundlich to make measurements of Mercury’s orbit required to confirm the general theory of relativity. Freundlich confirmed 43″ per century in a paper of 1913. Einsteinapplied his theory of gravitation and discovered that the advance of 43″ per century was exactly accounted for without any need to postulate invisible moons or any other special hypothesis. Of course Einstein‘s 18 November paper still does not have the correct field equations but this did not affect the particular calculation regarding Mercury. Freundlich attempted other tests of general relativity based on gravitational redshift, but they were inconclusive.\n\nAlso in the 18 November paper Einstein discovered that the bending of light was out by a factor of 2 in his 1911 work, giving 1.74″. In fact after many failed attempts (due to cloud, war, incompetence etc.) to measure the deflection, two British expeditions in 1919 were to confirm Einstein‘s prediction by obtaining 1.98″ ± 0.30″ and 1.61″ ± 0.30″.\n\nOn 25 November Einstein submitted his paper The field equations of gravitation which give the correct field equations for general relativity. The calculation of bending of light and the advance of Mercury’s perihelion remained as he had calculated it one week earlier.\n\nFive days before Einstein submitted his 25 November paper Hilbert had submitted a paper The foundations of physics which also contained the correct field equations for gravitation. Hilbert‘s paper contains some important contributions to relativity not found in Einstein‘s work. Hilbert applied the variational principle to gravitation and attributed one of the main theorem’s concerning identities that arise to Emmy Noether who was in Göttingen in 1915. No proof of the theorem is given. Hilbert‘s paper contains the hope that his work will lead to the unification of gravitation and electromagnetism.\n\nIn fact Emmy Noether‘s theorem was published with a proof in 1918 in a paper which she wrote under her own name. This theorem has become a vital tool in theoretical physics. A special case of Emmy Noether‘s theorem was written down by Weyl in 1917 when he derived from it identities which, it was later realised, had been independently discovered by Ricci in 1889 and by Bianchi (a pupil of Klein) in 1902.\n\nImmediately after Einstein‘s 1915 paper giving the correct field equations, Karl Schwarzschild found in 1916 a mathematical solution to the equations which corresponds to the gravitational field of a massive compact object. At the time this was purely theoretical work but, of course, work on neutron stars, pulsars and black holes relied entirely on Schwarzschild‘s solutions and has made this part of the most important work going on in astronomy today.\n\nEinstein had reached the final version of general relativity after a slow road with progress but many errors along the way. In December 1915 he said of himself\n\nThat fellow Einstein suits his convenience. Every year he retracts what he wrote the year before.\n\nMost of Einstein‘s colleagues were at a loss to understand the quick succession of papers, each correcting, modifying and extending what had been done earlier. In December 1915 Ehrenfest wrote to Lorentz referring to the theory of November 25, 1915. Ehrenfest and Lorentz corresponded about the general theory of relativity for two months as they tried to understand it. Eventually Lorentz understood the theory and wrote to Ehrenfest saying I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant results . Ehrenfest responded\n\nYour remark “I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant results” has a similar meaning for me as when one Freemason recognises another by a secret sign.\n\nIn March 1916 Einstein completed an article explaining general relativity in terms more easily understood. The article was well received and he then wrote another article on relativity which was widely read and went through over 20 printings.\n\nToday relativity plays a role in many areas, cosmology, the big bang theory etc. and now has been checked by experiment to a high degree of accuracy.\n\nA history of Quantum Mechanics\n\nIt is hard to realise that the electron was only discovered a little over 100 years ago in 1897. That it was not expected is illustrated by a remark made by J J Thomson, the discoverer of the electron. He said\n\nI was told long afterwards by a distinguished physicist who had been present at my lecture that he thought I had been pulling their leg.\n\nThe neutron was not discovered until 1932 so it is against this background that we trace the beginnings of quantum theory back to 1859.\n\nIn 1859 Gustav Kirchhoff proved a theorem about blackbody radiation. A blackbody is an object that absorbs all the energy that falls upon it and, because it reflects no light, it would appear black to an observer. A blackbody is also a perfect emitter and Kirchhoff proved that the energy emitted Edepends only on the temperature T and the frequency v of the emitted energy, i.e.\n\nE = J(T,v).\n\nHe challenged physicists to find the function J.\n\nIn 1879 Josef Stefan proposed, on experimental grounds, that the total energy emitted by a hot body was proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. In the generality stated by Stefan this is false. The same conclusion was reached in 1884 by Ludwig Boltzmann for blackbody radiation, this time from theoretical considerations using thermodynamics and Maxwell‘s electromagnetic theory. The result, now known as the Stefan–Boltzmann law, does not fully answer Kirchhoff‘s challenge since it does not answer the question for specific wavelengths.\n\nIn 1896 Wilhelm Wien proposed a solution to the Kirchhoff challenge. However although his solution matches experimental observations closely for small values of the wavelength, it was shown to break down in the far infrared by Rubens and Kurlbaum.\n\nKirchhoff, who had been at Heidelberg, moved to Berlin. Boltzmann was offered his chair in Heidelberg but turned it down. The chair was then offered to Hertz who also declined the offer, so it was offered again, this time to Planck and he accepted.\n\nRubens visited Planck in October 1900 and explained his results to him. Within a few hours of Rubens leaving Planck‘s house Planck had guessed the correct formula for Kirchhoff‘s J function. This guess fitted experimental evidence at all wavelengths very well but Planck was not satisfied with this and tried to give a theoretical derivation of the formula. To do this he made the unprecedented step of assuming that the total energy is made up of indistinguishable energy elements – quanta of energy. He wrote\n\nExperience will prove whether this hypothesis is realised in nature\n\nPlanck himself gave credit to Boltzmann for his statistical method but Planck‘s approach was fundamentally different. However theory had now deviated from experiment and was based on a hypothesis with no experimental basis. Planck won the 1918 Nobel Prize for Physics for this work.\n\nIn 1901 Ricci and Levi-Civita published Absolute differential calculus. It had been Christoffel‘s discovery of ‘covariant differentiation’ in 1869 which let Ricci extend the theory of tensor analysis to Riemannian space of ndimensions. The Ricci and Levi-Civita definitions were thought to give the most general formulation of a tensor. This work was not done with quantum theory in mind but, as so often happens, the mathematics necessary to embody a physical theory had appeared at precisely the right moment.\n\nIn 1905 Einstein examined the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is the release of electrons from certain metals or semiconductors by the action of light. The electromagnetic theory of light gives results at odds with experimental evidence. Einstein proposed a quantum theory of light to solve the difficulty and then he realised that Planck‘s theory made implicit use of the light quantum hypothesis. By 1906 Einstein had correctly guessed that energy changes occur in a quantum material oscillator in changes in jumps which are multiples of v where is Planck‘s reduced constant and v is the frequency. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1922, for this work on the photoelectric effect.\n\nIn 1913 Niels Bohr wrote a revolutionary paper on the hydrogen atom. He discovered the major laws of the spectral lines. This work earned Bohr the 1922 Nobel Prize for Physics. Arthur Compton derived relativistic kinematics for the scattering of a photon (a light quantum) off an electron at rest in 1923.\n\nHowever there were concepts in the new quantum theory which gave major worries to many leading physicists. Einstein, in particular, worried about the element of ‘chance’ which had entered physics. In fact Rutherford had introduced spontaneous effect when discussing radio-active decay in 1900. In 1924 Einstein wrote:-\n\nThere are therefore now two theories of light, both indispensable, and – as one must admit today despite twenty years of tremendous effort on the part of theoretical physicists – without any logical connection.\n\nIn the same year, 1924, Bohr, Kramers and Slater made important theoretical proposals regarding the interaction of light and matter which rejected the photon. Although the proposals were the wrong way forward they stimulated important experimental work. Bohr addressed certain paradoxes in his work.\n\n(i) How can energy be conserved when some energy changes are continuous and some are discontinuous, i.e. change by quantum amounts.\n\n(ii) How does the electron know when to emit radiation.\n\nEinstein had been puzzled by paradox (ii) and Pauli quickly told Bohr that he did not believe his theory. Further experimental work soon ended any resistance to belief in the electron. Other ways had to be found to resolve the paradoxes.\n\nUp to this stage quantum theory was set up in Euclidean space and used Cartesian tensors of linear and angular momentum. However quantum theory was about to enter a new era.\n\nThe year 1924 saw the publication of another fundamental paper. It was written by Satyendra Nath Bose and rejected by a referee for publication. Bose then sent the manuscript to Einstein who immediately saw the importance of Bose‘s work and arranged for its publication. Bose proposed different states for the photon. He also proposed that there is no conservation of the number of photons. Instead of statistical independence of particles, Bose put particles into cells and talked about statistical independence of cells. Time has shown that Bose was right on all these points.\n\nWork was going on at almost the same time as Bose‘s which was also of fundamental importance. The doctoral thesis of Louis de Broglie was presented which extended the particle-wave duality for light to all particles, in particular to electrons. Schrödinger in 1926 published a paper giving his equation for the hydrogen atom and heralded the birth of wave mechanics. Schrödingerintroduced operators associated with each dynamical variable.\n\nThe year 1926 saw the complete solution of the derivation of Planck‘s law after 26 years. It was solved by Dirac. Also in 1926 Born abandoned the causality of traditional physics. Speaking of collisions Born wrote\n\nOne does not get an answer to the question, What is the state after collision? but only to the question, How probable is a given effect of the collision? From the standpoint of our quantum mechanics, there is no quantity which causally fixes the effect of a collision in an individual event.\n\nHeisenberg wrote his first paper on quantum mechanics in 1925 and 2 years later stated his uncertainty principle. It states that the process of measuring the position x of a particle disturbs the particle’s momentum p, so that\n\nDx Dp ≥ = h/2π\n\nwhere Dx is the uncertainty of the position and Dp is the uncertainty of the momentum. Here h is Planck‘s constant and is usually called the ‘reduced Planck‘s constant’. Heisenberg states that\n\nthe nonvalidity of rigorous causality is necessary and not just consistently possible.\n\nHeisenberg‘s work used matrix methods made possible by the work of Cayley on matrices 50 years earlier. In fact ‘rival’ matrix mechanics deriving from Heisenberg‘s work and wave mechanics resulting from Schrödinger‘s work now entered the arena. These were not properly shown to be equivalent until the necessary mathematics was developed by Riesz about 25 years later.\n\nAlso in 1927 Bohr stated that space-time coordinates and causality are complementary. Pauli realised that spin, one of the states proposed by Bose, corresponded to a new kind of tensor, one not covered by the Ricci and Levi-Civita work of 1901. However the mathematics of this had been anticipated by Eli Cartan who introduced a ‘spinor’ as part of a much more general investigation in 1913.\n\nDirac, in 1928, gave the first solution of the problem of expressing quantum theory in a form which was invariant under the Lorentz group of transformations of special relativity. He expressed d’Alembert‘s wave equation in terms of operator algebra.\n\nThe uncertainty principle was not accepted by everyone. Its most outspoken opponent was Einstein. He devised a challenge to Niels Bohr which he made at a conference which they both attended in 1930. Einstein suggested a box filled with radiation with a clock fitted in one side. The clock is designed to open a shutter and allow one photon to escape. Weigh the box again some time later and the photon energy and its time of escape can both be measured with arbitrary accuracy. Of course this is not meant to be an actual experiment, only a ‘thought experiment’.\n\nNiels Bohr is reported to have spent an unhappy evening, and Einstein a happy one, after this challenge by Einstein to the uncertainty principle. However Niels Bohr had the final triumph, for the next day he had the solution. The mass is measured by hanging a compensation weight under the box. This is turn imparts a momentum to the box and there is an error in measuring the position. Time, according to relativity, is not absolute and the error in the position of the box translates into an error in measuring the time.\n\nAlthough Einstein was never happy with the uncertainty principle, he was forced, rather grudgingly, to accept it after Bohr‘s explanation.\n\nIn 1932 von Neumann put quantum theory on a firm theoretical basis. Some of the earlier work had lacked mathematical rigour, but von Neumann put the whole theory into the setting of operator algebra.\n\nOrbits and gravitation\n\nAlthough the motions of the planets were discussed by the Greeks they believed that the planets revolved round the Earth so are of little interest to us in this article although the method of epicycles is an early application of Fourier series.\n\nThe first to propose a system of planetary paths which would set the scene for major advances was Copernicus who in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (1543), argued that the planets and the Earth moved round the Sun. Although a major breakthrough, Copernicus proposed circular paths for the planets and accurate astronomical observations soon began to show that his proposal was not strictly accurate.\n\nYou can see a diagram from De revolutionibus orbium coelestium showing Copernicus’s solar system.\n\nIn 1600 Kepler became assistant to Tycho Brahe who was making accurate observations of the planets. After Brahe died in 1601 Kepler continued the work, calculating planetary paths to unprecedented accuracy.\n\nKepler showed that a planet moves round the Sun in an elliptical path which has the Sun in one of its two foci. He also showed that a line joining the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the planet describes its path. Both these laws were first formulated for the planet Mars, and published in Astronomia Nova (1609).\n\nYou can see a diagram from Astronomia Nova showing Kepler’s elliptical path for Mars.\n\nHowever scientists certainly did not accept Kepler‘s first two laws with enthusiasm. The first was given a cool reception and was certainly thought to require further work to confirm it. The second of Kepler‘s laws suffered an even worse fate in being essentially ignored by scientists for around 80 years.\n\nKepler‘s third law, that the squares of the periods of planets are proportional to the cubes of the mean radii of their paths, appeared in Harmonice mundi(1619) and, perhaps surprisingly in view of the above comments, was widely accepted right from the time of its publication.\n\nIn 1679 Hooke wrote a letter to Newton. In the letter he explained how he considered planetary motion to be the result of a central force continuously diverting the planet from its path in a straight line. Newton did not answer this directly but explained his own idea that the rotation of the Earth could be proved from the fact that an object dropped from the top of a tower should have a greater tangential velocity than one dropped near the foot of the tower.\n\nNewton provided a sketch of the path that the particle would follow, quite incorrectly showing it spiral towards the centre of the Earth. Hooke replied that his theory of planetary motion would lead to the path of the particle being an ellipse so that the particle, were it not for the fact that the Earth was in the way, would return to its original position after traversing the ellipse.\n\nNewton, not one to like being corrected, had to admit that his original sketch was incorrect but he “corrected” Hooke‘s sketch on the assumption that gravity was constant. Hooke replied to Newton that his own theory involved an inverse square law for gravitational attraction. Many years later Hookewas to claim priority for proposing the inverse square law of gravitation and used this letter to Newton to support his claim.\n\nIt is worth emphasising that there is a major step to be made from an inverse square law of force to explain planetary motion and a universal law of gravitation. Certainly the motion of the Moon round the Earth was not seen to necessarily be part of the same laws which govern the motion of the planets round the Sun.\n\nFifty years after these events Newton was to record his own recollections of these events which, although interesting, do not really agree with the known historical facts! [I preserve Newton‘s old English.]\n\nIn the same year I began to think of gravity extending to ye orb of the Moon and (having found out how to estimate the force with wch globe revolving within a sphere presses the surface of a sphere) from Kepler’s rule of the periodical times of the Planets being in sesquialternate proportion to their distances from the centres of their Orbs, I deduced that the forces wch keep the Planets in their Orbs must reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about wch they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth, and found them answer pretty nearly. All this was in the two plague years of 1665–1666…\n\nIn 1684 Wren, Hooke and Halley discussed, at the Royal Society, whether the elliptical shape of planetary orbits was a consequence of an inverse square law of force depending on the distance from the Sun. Halley wrote that\n\nMr Hook said that he had it, but that he would conceale it for some time so that others, triing and failing might know how to value it, when he should make it publick.\n\nLater in the same year in August, Halley visited Newton in Cambridge and asked him what orbit a body would follow under an inverse square law of force\n\nSr Isaac replied immediately that it would be an Ellipsis, the Doctor struck with joy and amasement asked him how he knew it, why, said he I have calculated it, whereupon Dr Halley asked him for his calculation without any farther delay, Sr Isaac looked among his papers but could not find it, but he promised him to renew it, and then to send it him.\n\nDespite the claims by Newton in the above quote, he had in fact proved this result in 1680 as a direct result of the letters from Hooke. Newton indeed reworked his proof and sent a nine page paper De motu corporum in gyrum(On the motion of bodies in an orbit) to Halley. It did not state the law of universal gravitation nor Newton‘s three laws of motion. All this was to develop over the next couple of years to become the basis for the Principia.\n\nHalley was largely responsible for ensuring that the Principia was published. He received Newton‘s complete manuscript by April of 1687 but there were many problems not the least being that Newton tried to prevent the publication of the Book III when Hooke claimed priority with the inverse square law of force.\n\nIn the Principia the problem of two attracting bodies with an inverse square law of force is completely solved (in Propositions 1-17, 57-60 in Book I). Newton argues that an inverse square law must give produce elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic orbits.\n\nA bright comet had appeared on 14 November 1680. It remained visible until 5 December 1680 when it moved too close to the Sun to be observed. It reappeared two weeks later moving away from the Sun along almost the same path along which it had approached. Newton found good agreement between its orbit and a parabola. He uses the orbit of this comet, and comets in general, to support his inverse square law of gravitation in the Principia.\n\nYou can see a diagram of the orbit of the comet of 1680 from the Principia.\n\nIn the Principia Newton also deduced Kepler‘s third law. He looked briefly (in Propositions 65 and 66) at the problem of three bodies. However Newtonlater said that an exact solution for three bodies\n\nexceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind.\n\nIt is important at this stage to examine the problems which now arose. Newton had completely solved the theoretical problem of the motion of two point masses under an inverse square law of attraction. For more than two point masses only approximations to the motion of the bodies could be found and this line of research led to a large effort by mathematicians to develop methods to attack this three body problem. However, the problem of the actual motion of the planets and moons in the solar system was highly complicated by other considerations.\n\nEven if the Earth – Moon system were considered as a two body problem, theoretically solved in the Principia, the orbits would not be simple ellipses. Neither the Earth nor the Moon is a perfect sphere so does not behave as a point mass. This was to lead to the development of mechanics of rigid bodies, but even this would not give a completely accurate picture of the two body problem since tidal forces mean that neither the Earth nor Moon is rigid.\n\nThe observational data used by Newton in the Principia was provided by the Royal Greenwich Observatory. However modern scholars such as Richard Westfall claim that Newton sometimes adjusted his calculations to fit his theories. Certainly the observational evidence could not be used to prove the inverse square law of gravitation. Many problems relating observation to theory existed at the time of the Principia and more would arise.\n\nHalley used Newton‘s method and found almost parabolic orbits for a number of comets. When he computed the orbits for three comets which had appeared in 1537, 1607 and one Halley observed himself in 1682, he found that the characteristics of the orbits were almost identical. Halley deduced they were the same comet and later was able to identify it with one which had appeared in 1456 and 1378. He computed an elliptical orbit for the comet and he noticed that Jupiter and Saturn were perturbing the orbit slightly between each return of the comet. Taking the perturbations into account Halley predicted the comet would return and reach perihelion (the point nearest the Sun) on 13 April 1759. He gave an error of one month on either side of this date. The comet was actually first seen again in December 1758 reaching perihelion on 12 March 1759.\n\nIn 1713 a second edition of the Principia, edited by Roger Cotes, appeared. Cotes wrote a preface defending the theory of gravitation given in the Principia. Cotes was himself to provide the next mathematical steps by finding the derivatives of the trigonometric functions, results published after his death.\n\nEuler developed methods of integrating linear differential equations in 1739 and made known Cotes‘ work on trigonometric functions. He drew up lunar tables in 1744, clearly already studying gravitational attraction in the Earth, Moon, Sun system. Clairaut and d’Alembert were also studying perturbations of the Moon and, in 1747, Clairaut proposed adding a 1/r4 term to the gravitational law to explain the observed motion of the perihelion, the point in the orbit of the Moon where it is closest to the Earth.\n\nHowever by the end of 1748 Clairaut had discovered that a more accurate application of the inverse square law came close to explaining the orbit. He published his version in 1752 and, two years later, d’Alembert published his calculations going to more terms in his approximation than Clairaut. In fact this work was of importance in having Newton‘s inverse square law of force accepted in Continental Europe.\n\nThe Earth’s axis of rotation precesses, that is the direction of the axis of rotation itself rotates in a circle with a period of about 26000 years. Precession is caused by the gravitational attraction of the Sun on the equatorial bulge of the Earth, the bulge being predicted by Newton. Cassinimade a measurement of an arc of longitude in 1712 but obtained a result which wrongly suggested that the Earth was elongated at the poles. In 1736 Maupertuis obtained the correct result verifying Newton‘s predictions. However, this illustrates the problems encountered by mathematicians at this time with basic data about bodies in the solar system, even the Earth, being highly inaccurate.\n\nThere is a small periodic effect called nutation superimposed on precession caused by the motion of the perihelion of the Moon. This superimposed effect has a period of 18.6 years and was first observed by Bradley in 1730 but not announced until 18 years later when he had observed the full cycle. D’Alembert quickly showed that Bradley’s observed period was deducible from the inverse square law and Euler further clarified this with further work on the mechanics of rigid bodies during the 1750’s.\n\nThe problem of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had troubled astronomers and mathematicians from Kepler‘s first theory of elliptical orbits. The Paris Académie des Sciences offered Prizes for work on this topic in 1748, 1750 and 1752. In 1748 Euler‘s studies of the perturbation of Saturn’s orbit won him the Prize. His work for the 1752 Prize, however, contains many mathematical errors and was not published until 17 years later. It did contain significant ideas, however, which were independently discovered since Euler‘s work was not known.\n\nLagrange won the Académie des Sciences Prize in 1764 for a work on the libration of the Moon. This is a periodic movement in the axis the Moon pointing towards the Earth which allows, over a period of time, more than 50% of the surface of the Moon to be seen. He also won the Académie des Sciences of 1766 for work on the orbits of the moons of Jupiter where he gave a mathematical analysis to explain an observed inequality in the sequence of eclipses of the moons.\n\nEuler, from 1760 onwards, seems to be the first to study the general problem of three bodies under mutual gravitation (rather than looking at bodies in the solar system) although at first he only considered the restricted three body problem when one of the bodies has negligible mass. When one body has negligible mass it is assumed that the motions of the other two can be solved as a two body problem, the body of negligible mass having no effect on the other two. Then the problem is to determine the motion of the third body attracted to the other two bodies which orbit each other. Even in this form the problem does not lead to exact solutions. Euler, however, found a particular solution with all three bodies in a straight line.\n\nThe first comet to have an elliptical orbit calculated which was far from a parabola was observed by Messier in 1769. The elliptical orbit was computed by Lexell who correctly realised that the small elliptical orbit had been produced by perturbations by Jupiter. The comet made no reappearance and again Lexell correctly deduced that Jupiter had changed the orbit so much that it was thrown far away from the Sun.\n\nThe Académie des Sciences Prize of 1772 for work on the orbit of the Moon was jointly won by Lagrange and Euler. Lagrange submitted Essai sur le problème des trois corps in which he showed that Euler‘s restricted three body solution held for the general three body problem. He also found another solution where the three bodies were at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Lagrange considers his solutions do not apply to the solar system but we now know the both the Earth and Jupiter have asteroids sharing their orbits in the equilateral triangle solution configuration discovered by Lagrange. For Jupiter these bodies are called Trojan planets, the first to be discovered being Achilles in 1908. The Trojan planets move 60 in front and 60 behind Jupiter at what are now called the Lagrangian points.\n\nYou can see the known asteroids. This picture shows the positions of nearly 6000 asteroids whose orbits are now known. The effect of the Lagrangian points is readily seen. Jupiter is the outermost planet depicted in the picture.\n\nHowever all this work on the orbits of bodies in the solar system failed to keep pace with observations which always seemed one step ahead, giving further and yet further problems for the theorists to explain. Laplace, from 1774 onwards, became an important contributor to the attempt of the theoreticians to explain the observations of the observers.\n\nLagrange introduced the method of variation of the arbitrary constants in a paper in 1776 stating that the method was of interest in celestial mechanics and, in special cases, had been already been used by Euler, Laplace and himself. Lagrange published further major papers in 1783 and 1784 on the theory of perturbations of orbits using methods of variations of the arbitrary constants and, in 1785, applied his theory to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nAn important development occurred on 13 March 1781 when the astronomer William Herschel (father of John Herschel) observing in his private observatory in Bath, England found\n\n… a curious either nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\n\nAlmost immediately it was realised that it was a planet and within a year of its discovery it was shown to have an almost circular orbit. The name Uranus was eventually adopted although William Herschel himself proposed Georgium Sidus (perhaps in the hope of more funds from King George!) while in France it was known as Herschel until the middle of the following century.\n\nLaplace read a memoir to the Académie des Sciences on 23 November 1785 in which he gave a theoretical explanation of all the remaining major discrepancies between theory and observation of all the planets and their moons excluding Uranus. He also addressed the question of the stability of the solar system for the first time. This work was to culminate in the publication of Mécanique céleste (1799) in which, among many other important results, he claimed to prove the stability of the solar system.\n\nThe remaining observations not explained by theory at the end of the 18 Century concerned the motion of the Moon. Laplace‘s work of 1787, that of Adams of 1854 and later Delaunay‘s work described below eventually provided solutions. Observations of Uranus in the early years of the 19th Century showed there were problems with its orbit and by 1830 Uranus had departed by 15″ from the best fitting ellipse.\n\nThe next body to be discovered in the solar system was the minor planet Ceres, discovered in 1801. In 1766 J D Titus and in 1772 J E Bode had noted that\n\n(1+4)/10, (3+4)/10, (6+4)/10, (12+4)/10, (24+4)/10, (48+4)/10, (96+4)/10\n\ngave the distances of the 6 known planets from the Sun (taking the Earth’s distance to be 1) except there was no planet at distance 2.8. The discovery of Uranus at distance 19.2 was close to the next term of the sequence 19.6.\n\nA search was made for a planet at distance 2.8 and on 1 January 1801 G Piazzi discovered such a body. On 11 February Piazzi fell ill and ended his observations. The new planet, unobserved by other astronomers, passed behind the Sun and was lost. However Gauss in a brilliant piece of work was able to compute an orbit from the small number of observations. In fact Gauss‘ s method requires only 3 observations and is still essentially that used today in calculating orbits. Ceres, so named by Piazzi, was found to be where Gauss predicted by Olbers. Its distance from the Sun fitted exactly the 2.8 prediction of the Titus-Bode law.\n\nJohann Encke, a student of Gauss, computed (using Gauss‘s method) an elliptical orbit for the comet of 1818. It had the shortest known period of 3.3 years. The period showed a periodic decrease which Encke could not explain by perturbations by other planets.\n\nWork on the general three body problem during the 19th Century had begun to take two distinct lines. One was the developing of highly complicated methods of approximating the motions of the bodies. The other line was to produce a sophisticated theory to transform and integrate the equations of motion. The first of these lines was celestial mechanics while the second was rational or analytic mechanics. Both the theory of perturbations and the theory of variations of the arbitrary constants were of major mathematical significance as well as contributing greatly to the understanding of planetary orbits.\n\nPapers published by Hamilton in 1834 and 1835 made major contributions to the mechanics of orbiting bodies. as did the significant paper published by Jacobi in 1843 where he reduced the problem of two actual planets orbiting a sun to the motion of two theoretical point masses. As a first approximation the theoretical point masses orbited the centre of gravity of the original system in ellipses. He then used a method, first discovered by Lagrange, to compute the perturbations. Bertrand extended Jacobi‘s work in 1852.\n\nIn 1836 Liouville studied planetary theory, the three body problem and the motion of the minor planets Ceres and Vesta. Many mathematicians around this period devoted much of their time to these problems. Liouville made a number of very important mathematical discoveries while working on the theory of perturbations including the discovery of Liouville‘s theorem “when a bounded domain in phase space evolves according to Hamilton’s equations its volume is conserved”.\n\nBy around 1840 irregularities in the orbit of Uranus prompted many scientists to seek reasons them. Alexis Bouvard (a collector of planetary data) proposed that a planet might explain the irregularities and he wrote to the English Astronomer Royal Airy proposing this idea. Bessel also proposed this solution to the problem but died before completing his calculations. Delaunay, famed for his work on the orbit of the Moon, investigated the perturbations in a paper of 1842. Arago urged Le Verrier to work on the problem and on 1 June 1846 Le Verrier showed that the irregularities could be explained by an unknown planet and he determined the coordinates at which the planet would be found. The astronomer Galle in Berlin found the new planet on 26 September remarkably close to the position predicted by Le Verrier. The observations were confirmed on 29 September 1846 at the Paris observatory.\n\nThis was a remarkable achievement for Newton‘s theory of gravitation and of celestial mechanics. Le Verrier‘s personal triumph however was somewhat diminished when, on 15 October, a letter was published from the English astronomer Challis claiming that John Couch Adams of Cambridge University had made similar calculations to those of Le Verrier which he had completed in September 1845. His predicted position for the new planet had been almost as accurate as Le Verrier‘s but the English astronomers had been much less industrious in their search. John Herschel and Airy also supported Adams‘ claim. In fact Challis had, after a long delay, begun to search for the new planet on 29 July 1846. He observed it on 4 August but did not compare his observations with those of the previous night so only realised he had observed the planet after its discovery in Berlin about 7 weeks later. Aragowas unimpressed by Adams‘ priority claims\n\nMr Adams does not have the right to appear in the history of the discovery of the planet Le Verrier either with a detailed citation or even with the faintest allusion. In the eyes of all impartial men, this discovery will remain one of the most magnificent triumphs of theoretical astronomy, one of the glories of the Académie and one of the most beautiful distinctions of our country.\n\nThe success of the mathematical analysis of both Le Verrier and Adams was somewhat fortunate. The orbits which they predicted were different and both not particularly good except around the 1840’s. An argument over the naming of the new planet was, however, unfortunate. Arago was given the task of selecting a name by Le Verrier and Le Verrier made his wishes known in an unsubtle way by writing a paper on Herschel’s planet, insisting that Uranus should be named after its discoverer. Encke, Gauss‘s student referred to above, suggested Neptune as a name. However Arago said\n\nI commit myself never to call the new planet by any other name than Le Verrier. In this way, I think I will give an impeachable token of my love for science and follow the inspiration of a legitimate national sentiment.\n\nThe argument over a name led to Le Verrier resigning from the Bureau des Longitude and eventually Arago lost his battle over the name which became accepted as Neptune.\n\nDelaunay, mentioned above for his work on the perturbations of Uranus, worked for 20 years on lunar theory. He treated it as a restricted three body problem and used transformations to produce infinite series solutions for the longitude, latitude and parallax for the Moon. The beginnings of his theory was published in 1847 and he had refined the theory until it was published in 2 volumes in 1860 and 1867 and was extremely accurate, its only drawback being the slow convergence of the infinite series.\n\nDelaunay detected discrepancies between the observed motion of the Moon and his predictions. Le Verrier claimed that Delaunay‘s methods were in error but Delaunay claimed that the discrepancies were due to unknown factors. In 1865 Delaunay suggested that the discrepancies arose from a slowing of the Earth’s rotation due to tidal friction, an explanation which is today believed to be correct.\n\nLe Verrier had published an account of his theory of Mercury in 1859. He pointed out that there was a discrepancy of 38″ per century between the predicted motion of the perihelion (the point of closest approach of the planet to the Sun) which was 527″ per century and the observed value of 565″ per century. In fact the actual discrepancy was 43″ per century and this was pointed out by later by Simon Newcomb. Le Verrier was convinced that a planet or ring of material lay inside the orbit of Mercury but being close to the Sun had not been observed.\n\nLe Verrier‘s search proved in vain and by 1896 Tisserand had concluded that no such perturbing body existed. Newcomb explained the discrepancy in the motion of the perihelion by assuming a minute departure from an inverse square law of gravitation. This was the first time that Newton‘s theory had been questioned for a long time. In fact this discrepancy in the motion of the perihelion of Mercury was to provide the proof that Newtonian theory had to give way to Einstein‘s theory of relativity. More details relating to the advance of Mercury’s perihelion are contained in the article on general relativity.\n\nG W Hill published an account of his lunar theory in 1878. Earlier approaches started with an elliptic orbit of the Moon round the Earth, assuming the Sun had no effect, then perturbing the orbit to take account of the gravitation of the Sun. Hill, on the other hand, started with circular orbits for the Sun and Moon about the Earth and went on to examine the perturbations caused by assuming elliptic orbits.\n\nThe final major step forward in the study of the three body problem which we shall consider was that of Poincaré. Bruns proved in 1887 that apart from the 10 classical integrals, 6 for the centre of gravity, 3 for angular momentum and one for energy, no others could exist. In 1889 Poincaré proved that for the restricted three body problem no integrals exist apart from the Jacobian. In 1890 Poincaré proved his famous recurrence theorem, namely that in any small region of phase space trajectories exist which pass through the region infinitely often. Poincaré published 3 volumes of Les méthods nouvelle de la mécanique celeste between 1892 and 1899. He discussed convergence and uniform convergence of the series solutions discussed by earlier mathematicians and proved them not to be uniformly convergent. The stability proofs of Lagrange and Laplace became inconclusive after this result.\n\nPoincaré introduced further topological methods in 1912 for the theory of stability of orbits in the three body problem. It fact Poincaré essentially invented topology in his attempt to answer stability questions in the three body problem. He conjectured that there are infinitely many periodic solutions of the restricted problem, the conjecture being later proved by Birkhoff. The stability of the orbits in the three body problem was also investigated by Levi-Civita, Birkhoff and others.\n\nSpecial relativity\n\nThe classical laws of physics were formulated by Newton in the Principia in 1687. According to this theory the motion of a particle has to be described relative to an inertial frame in which the particle, not subjected to external forces, will move at a constant velocity in a straight line. Two inertial frames are related in that they move in a fixed direction at a constant speed with respect to each other. Time in the frames differs by a constant and all times can be described relative to an absolute time. This 17th Century theory was not challenged until the 19th Century when electric and magnetic phenomena were studied theoretically.\n\nIt had long been known that sound required a medium to travel through and it was quite natural to postulate a medium for the transmission of light. Such a medium was called the ether and many 19th Century scientists postulated an ether with various properties. Cauchy, Stokes, Thomson and Planck all postulated ethers with differing properties and by the end of the 19thCentury light, heat, electricity and magnetism all had their respective ethers.\n\nA knowledge that the electromagnetic field was spread with a velocity essentially the same as the speed of light caused Maxwell to postulate that light itself was an electromagnetic phenomenon. Maxwell wrote an article on Ether for the 1878 edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica. He proposed the existence of a single ether and the article tells of a failed attempt by Maxwellto measure the effect of the ether drag on the earth’s motion. He also proposed an astronomical determination of the ether drag by measuring the velocity of light using Jupiter’s moons at different positions relative to the earth.\n\nPrompted by Maxwell‘s ideas, Michelson began his own terrestrial experiments and in 1881 he reported\n\nThe result of the hypothesis of a stationary ether is shown to be incorrect, and the necessary conclusion follows that the hypothesis is erroneous.\n\nLorentz wrote a paper in 1886 where he criticised Michelson’s experiment and really was not worried by the experimental result which he dismissed being doubtful of its accuracy. Michelson was persuaded by Thomson and others to repeat the experiment and he did so with Morley, again reporting that no effect had been found in 1887. It appeared that the velocity of light was independent of the velocity of the observer. [Michelson and Morley were to refine their experiment and repeat it many times up to 1929.]\n\nAlso in 1887 Voigt first wrote down the transformations\n\nx‘ = x – vt, y‘ = y/g, z‘ = z/g, t‘ = t – vx/c2\n\nand showed that certain equations were invariant under these transformations. These transformations, with a different scale factor, are now known as the Lorentz equations and the group of Lorentztransformations gives the geometry of special relativity. All this was unknown to Voigt who was writing on the Doppler shift when he wrote down the transformations.\n\nVoigt corresponded with Lorentz about the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 and 1888 but Lorentz does not seem to have learnt of the transformations at that stage. Lorentz however was now greatly worried by the new Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887.\n\nIn 1889 a short paper was published by the Irish physicist George FitzGeraldin Science. The paper The ether and the earth’s atmosphere takes up less than half a page and is non-technical. FitzGerald pointed out that the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment could be explained only if\n\n… the length of material bodies changes, according as they are moving through the ether or across it, by an amount depending on the square of the ratio of their velocities to that of light.\n\nLorentz was unaware of FitzGerald‘s paper and in 1892 he proposed an almost identical contraction in a paper which now took the Michelson-Morley experiment very seriously. When it was pointed out to Lorentz in 1894 that FitzGerald had published a similar theory he wrote to FitzGeraldwho replied that he had sent an article to Science but I do not know if they ever published it . He was glad to know that Lorentz agreed with him for I have been rather laughed at for my view over here . Lorentz took every opportunity after this to acknowledge that FitzGerald had proposed the idea first. Only FitzGerald, who did not know if his paper had been published, believed that Lorentz had published first!\n\nLarmor wrote an article in 1898 Ether and matter in which he wrote down the Lorentz transformations (still not written down by Lorentz) and showed that the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction was a consequence.\n\nLorentz wrote down the transformations, now named after him, in a paper of 1899, being the third person to write them down. He, like Larmor, showed that the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction was a consequence of the Lorentztransformations.\n\nThe most amazing article relating to special relativity to be published before 1900 was a paper of Poincaré La mesure du temps which appeared in 1898. In this paper Poincaré says\n\n… we have no direct intuition about the equality of two time intervals.\n\nThe simultaneity of two events or the order of their succession, as well as the equality of two time intervals, must be defined in such a way that the statements of the natural laws be as simple as possible.\n\nBy 1900 the concept of the ether as a material substance was being questioned. Paul Drude wrote\n\nThe conception of an ether absolutely at rest is the most simple and the most natural – at least if the ether is conceived to be not a substance but merely space endowed with certain physical properties.\n\nPoincaré, in his opening address to the Paris Congress in 1900, asked Does the ether really exist? In 1904 Poincaré came very close to the theory of special relativity in an address to the International Congress of Arts and Science in St Louis. He pointed out that observers in different frames will have clocks which will\n\n… mark what on may call the local time. … as demanded by the relativity principle the observer cannot know whether he is at rest or in absolute motion.\n\nThe year that special relativity finally came into existence was 1905. June of 1905 was a good month for papers on relativity, on the 5th June Poincarécommunicated an important work Sur la dynamique de l’electron while Einstein‘s first paper on relativity was received on 30th June. Poincaré stated that It seems that this impossibility of demonstrating absolute motion is a general law of nature. After naming the Lorentz transformations after Lorentz, Poincaré shows that these transformations, together with the rotations, form a group.\n\nEinstein‘s paper is remarkable for the different approach it takes. It is not presented as an attempt to explain experimental results, it is presented because of its beauty and simplicity. In the introduction Einstein says\n\n… the introduction of a light-ether will prove to be superfluous since, according to the view to be developed here, neither will a space in absolute rest endowed with special properties be introduced nor will a velocity vector be associated with a point of empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.\n\nInertial frames are introduced which, by definition, are in uniform motion with respect to each other. The whole theory is based on two postulates:-\n\n1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.\n\n2. In any inertial frame, the velocity of light c is the same whether the light is emitted by a body at rest or by a body in uniform motion.\n\nEinstein now deduced the Lorentz transformations from his two postulates and, like Poincaré proves the group property. Then the FitzGerald–Lorentzcontraction is deduced. Also in the paper Einstein mentions the clock paradox. Einstein called it a theorem that if two synchronous clocks C1 and C2 start at a point A and C2 leaves A moving along a closed curve to return to A then C2will run slow compared with C1. He notes that no paradox results since C2 experiences acceleration while C1 does not.\n\nIn September 1905 Einstein published a short but important paper in which he proved the famous formula\n\nE = mc2.\n\nThe first paper on special relativity, other than by Einstein, was written in 1908 by Planck. It was largely due to the fact that relativity was taken up by someone as important as Planck that it became so rapidly accepted. At the time Einstein wrote the 1905 paper he was still a technical expert third class at the Bern patent office. Also in 1908 Minkowski published an important paper on relativity, presenting the Maxwell–Lorentz equations in tensor form. He also showed that the Newtonian theory of gravitation was not consistent with relativity.\n\nThe main contributors to special relativity were undoubtedly Lorentz, Poincaré and, of course, the founder of the theory Einstein. It is therefore interesting to see their respective reactions to the final formulation of the theory. Einstein, although he spent many years thinking about how to formulate the theory, once he had found the two postulates they were immediately natural to him. Einstein was always reluctant to acknowledge that the steps which others were taking due to the Michelson-Morley experiment had any influence on his thinking.\n\nPoincaré‘s reaction to Einstein‘s 1905 paper was rather strange. When Poincaré lectured in Göttingen in 1909 on relativity he did not mention Einstein at all. He presented relativity with three postulates, the third being the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction. It is impossible to believe that someone as brilliant as Poincaré had failed to understand Einstein‘s paper. In fact Poincaré never wrote a paper on relativity in which he mentioned Einstein. Einstein himself behaved in a similar fashion and Poincaré is only mentioned once in Einstein‘s papers. Lorentz, however, was praised by both Einstein and Poincaré and often cited in their work.\n\nLorentz himself poses a puzzle. Although he clearly understood Einstein‘s papers, he did not ever seem to accept their conclusions. He gave a lecture in 1913 when he remarked how rapidly relativity had been accepted. He for one was less sure.\n\nAs far as this lecturer is concerned he finds a certain satisfaction in the older interpretation according to which the ether possesses at least some substantiality, space and time can be sharply separated, and simultaneity without further specification can be spoken of. Finally it should be noted that the daring assertion that one can never observe velocities larger than the velocity of light contains a hypothetical restriction of what is accessible to us, a restriction which cannot be accepted without some reservation.\n\nDespite Lorentz‘s caution the special theory of relativity was quickly accepted. In 1912 Lorentz and Einstein were jointly proposed for a Nobel prize for their work on special relativity. The recommendation is by Wien, the 1911 winner, and states\n\n… While Lorentz must be considered as the first to have found the mathematical content of the relativity principle, Einsteinsucceeded in reducing it to a simple principle. One should therefore assess the merits of both investigators as being comparable…\n\nEinstein never received a Nobel prize for relativity. The committee was at first cautious and waited for experimental confirmation. By the time such confirmation was available Einstein had moved on to further momentous work.\n\nTopology and Scottish mathematical physics\n\nThe Scottish mathematical physicists referred to in the title are Thomson, Maxwell and Tait. These three became involved in topological concepts, in particular knot theory, because it entered their physical considerations in a natural way. In 1847 Listing published Vorstudien zur Topologie and then Riemann published important papers on complex analysis in 1851 and 1857 which investigated connectivity and Riemann surfaces. The Scottish mathematical physicists did not know of these papers until much later but Helmholtz, whose paper of 1858 directly influenced them, built much on Riemann‘s ideas.\n\nIn 1858 Helmholtz published his important paper in Crelle’s Journal on the motion of a perfect fluid. Helmholtz‘s paper Uber Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen, welche den Wirbelbewegungen entsprechenbegan by decomposing the motion of a perfect fluid into translation, rotation and deformation. It was this aspect which first interested Tait who saw that by using Hamilton‘s quaternions he could express the fluid velocity as a “vector function”. However the ideas in the paper which eventually led the Scottish mathematical physicists to topological considerations concerned vortex lines and vortex tubes. Helmholtz defined vortex lines as lines coinciding with the local direction of the axis of rotation of the fluid, and vortex tubes as bundles of vortex lines through an infinitesimal element of area. Helmholtz showed that the vortex tubes had to close up and also that the particles in a vortex tube at any given instant would remain in the tube indefinitely so no matter how much the tube was distorted it would retain its shape.\n\nHelmholtz was aware of the topological ideas in his paper, particularly the fact that the region outside a vortex tube was multiply connected which led him to consider many-valued potential functions. He described his theoretical conclusions regarding two circular vortex rings with a common axis of symmetry in the following way:-\n\nIf they both have the same direction of rotation they will proceed in the same sense, and the ring in front will enlarge itself and move slower, while the second one will shrink and move faster, if the velocities of translation are not too different, the second will finally reach the first and pass through it. Then the same game will be repeated with the other ring, so the ring will pass alternately one through the other.\n\nAs we have mentioned Tait‘s first interest in Helmholtz‘ paper was because he saw applications of quaternions there. It was not until 1867 that Taitverified Helmholtz‘ theoretical claims regarding two circular vortex rings with experiments with smoke rings. He used two boxes each with a rubber diaphragm which shot out white smoke rings when the diaphragm was struck. Thomson wrote to Helmholtz on 22 January 1867:-\n\n… a few days ago Tait showed me in Edinburgh a magnificent way of producing [vortex rings]. We sometimes can make one ring shoot through another, illustrating perfectly your description; when one ring passes near another, each is much disturbed, and is seen to be in a state of violent vibration for a few seconds, till it settles again into its circular form. … The vibrations make a beautiful subject for mathematical work.\n\nThese experiments were to have a major influence on Thomson who saw the permanence of form as a possible explanation for atoms and therefore explain the way that the different elements could be built. It is remarkable that Thomson was able to develop his ideas quickly enough that he could publish On vortex atoms in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh still in 1867. In this paper he wrote:-\n\nLeucretius’s atom does not explain any of the properties of matter without attributing them to the atom itself … The possibility of founding a theory of elastic solids and liquids on the dynamics of closely packed vortex atoms may be reasonably anticipated.\n\nAlthough was now know that Thomson was completely wrong, there is much in the way of correct reasoning in the quote we have just given. It was an idea which also led to interesting mathematical questions. As he wrote in the same paper:-\n\nA full mathematical investigation of the mutual action between two vortex rings of any given velocities passing one another in any two lines, so directed that they never come nearer to one one another than a large multiple of the diameter of either, is a perfect mathematical problem; and the novelty of the circumstances contemplated presents difficulties of an exciting character. Its solution will be the proposed new kinetic theory of gases.\n\nThomson, as most scientists of his time, viewed space as being filled with a perfect fluid, the aether. The vortex atoms were then knotted tubes of aether which, by Helmholtz‘s theory, retained their form despite being distorted. This stability of vortices explained the stability of atoms. The vortex atoms, being built from the aether, required no special material. The different elements were accounted for by atoms composed of different knots or links and oscillations of the knots would, Thomson believed, explain the spectral lines which were characteristic of the different elements.\n\nTait began to think about knots and Thomson‘s second paper on vortex atoms, which appeared in 1869, included diagram of knots and links drawn by Tait. Long before this, however, Maxwell had entered the discussions which went on in letters exchanged by the three Scottish mathematical physicists. He was interested in knots because of electromagnetic considerations and in a letter to Tait written on the 4 December 1867 he rediscovered an integral formula counting the linking number of two closed curves which Gauss had discovered, but had not published, in 1833. Maxwellalso gave equations in three dimensions which represented knotted curves.\n\nHowever just when their work was proceeding rapidly, a major problem arose. Bertrand claimed that Helmholtz‘s 1858 paper, on which the idea of vortex atoms was based, was wrong. Maxwell was already intrigued by the problems and was not convinced that Bertrand‘s objections dealt a serious blow to Helmholtz‘s paper. In September 1868 Maxwell wrote several manuscripts which study knots and links. He set out the basic problem of the classification of knots and links as follows:-\n\nLet any system of closed curves in space be given and let them be supposed capable of having their forms changed in any continuous manner, provided that no two curves or branches of a curve ever pass through the same point of space, we propose to investigate the necessary relations between the positions of the curves and the degree of complication of the different curves of the system.\n\nMaxwell considered two-dimensional projections of links and devised a way of coding the diagrams to indicate which curve was above and which below at crossings on the projections.\n\nHe then looked at ways of modifying the diagrams without changing the link or knot. For a region bounded by one arc Maxwell noted that the region could be eliminated by uncoiling the curve. For regions bounded by two arcs, he noted that there were two cases, one where the arcs could be separated and the region eliminated, the other where this could not be done without making changes in other parts of the diagram. For regions bounded by three arcs Maxwell noted that again there were two cases:-\n\nIn the first case any one curve can be moved past the intersection of the other two without disturbing them. In the second case this cannot be done and the intersection of two curves is a bar to the motion of the third in that direction.\n\nAlthough his approach contained no mathematical rigour, still it is interesting to note that at this early stage Maxwell had defined the “Reidemeistermoves” which would be shown to be the fundamental moves in modifying knots in the 1920s.\n\nIn a a second manuscript Maxwell considered a region of space bounded by one external surface of genus n and m internal surfaces of genus n1, n, …, nmand showed that the region possessed N = n+n1+n+ …+ nm cycles and was (N+1)-ly connected. Now in modern terminology Maxwell was claiming that the first Betti number of the region was N. Again we should note that Maxwell did not give precise mathematical definitions of the concepts he was dealing with so no rigorous proof was possible. It is reasonable to ask how he then found the correct answer. The reason was that Maxwell, and for that matter Thomson too, reached their correct results using correct physical understanding, rather than mathematical intuition.\n\nThese manuscripts by Maxwell were not published at the time they were written despite Tait asking him to submit his ideas on knot theory to the Royal Society of Edinburgh for publication. However, more than 100 years after they were written these manuscripts were published . There are three manuscripts on knots and some time between the second, which Maxwell wrote in October 1868, and the third, which he wrote on 29 December 1868, he had read Listing‘s 1847 paper Vorstudien zur Topologie for in the third manuscript he lists Listing‘s main results. In February 1869 Maxwell presented an account of Listing‘s topological ideas to the London Mathematical Society.\n\nIn 1869 Thomson tried to clarify the topological ideas that he was using. The problem really came down to the fact that, perhaps not surprisingly, he had confused what we know today are two different concepts. He wrote:-\n\nI shall call a finite portion of space n-ply continuous when its bounding surface is such that there are n irreconcilable paths between any two points on it.\n\nHe explains that two irreconcilable paths between points P and Q are paths which cannot be smoothly transformed into each other by paths which remain within the portion of space considered. This definition does not really work although one can see Thomson struggling to reach a definition of homotopy. He does not compose his paths, however, a vital ingredient in the definition of homotopy. In the proofs he gave in the paper Thomson does not even try to use his definition but rather resorts to arguments involving virtual barriers which would stop fluid flowing. Again his topology is driven by physical ideas of fluid flow but this notion, similar to the idea of a “cutting surface” which Riemann had introduced and Helmholtz had used, relates to our present day idea of homology, not homotopy.\n\nBy 1876 Thomson had made little progress with his ideas of vortex atoms. There were many problems in his way and indeed by this stage he had not succeeded in mathematically describing how two vortex rings would interact if they did not have a common axis of symmetry much more the way that knotted vortices would interact. Also there was no insight into vortex atoms through lists of knots which, in Thomson‘s theory, would explain the chemical elements. Tait decided to embark on a classification of plane closed curves in 1876, writing in a report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science:-\n\nThe development of this subject promises absolutely endless work – but work of a very interesting and useful kind – because it is intimately connected with the theory of knots, which (especially as applied in Sir W Thomson‘s Theory of Vortex Atoms) is likely soon to become an important branch of mathematics.\n\nNow by looking at plane closed curves Tait was considering alternating knots, namely those which when traversing the projection in 2-dimensional space the crossings go alternately over and under. Choosing a starting point and a direction to traverse the path, he labelled the first, third, fifth etc. points by A, B, C etc. A knot with n crossings A, B, C, … would then be described by the sequence of crossings of length 2n where each of A, B, C, … occurred exactly twice when the knot was traversed. Tait called the sequence the “scheme of the knot”.\n\nA knot with scheme ACBDCADB.\n\nThere were then two basic problems to solve. Firstly which sequences of the above type correspond to a knot, and secondly how could it be determined when two knots described by such sequences were the same. However there were some other problems, for example although a sequence of length 10, say, might represent a knot it might be one with less than 5 crossings. It might be a knot which could be reduced to one with fewer crossings. For example if the projection contained a crossing which divided the curve into two parts which did not intersect, then this was a nugatory crossing which could be removed by a twist.\n\nExample of a nugatory crossing.\n\nTait conjectured that an alternating diagram without nugatory crossings would contain the minimum number of crossings. This became known as Tait‘s first conjecture. He gave a “proof” which showed that only nugatory crossings allowed the number of crossings to be reduced. However this is not good enough for there might be a sequence of moves which first increase the number of crossings, then further moves reduce to a fewer number of crossings than were there originally. If we interpret Tait in a form that he seems to have used the conjecture, namely that two alternating diagrams without nugatory crossings representing the same prime knot are related by a sequence of twists, then we get what has been called Tait‘s second conjecture. This was not finally proved until 1993.\n\nWithout any rigorous theory, which would have been well beyond nineteenth century mathematics, Tait began to classify knots using his mathematical and geometrical intuition. He knew that what was really required was a knot invariant, that is something which would be independent of the way that the knot was represented in two dimensions. First he looked for numerical invariants and considered the minimal number of crossings that a given knot might have in a two dimensional representation. This would lead him to Tait‘s first conjecture for alternating knots.\n\nAnother idea which seemed promising to Tait was the “beknottedness” which he defined as follows. Travel round the knot diagram and immediately after each crossing throw a copper coin to the left and a silver coin to the right if the crossing was above, or throw a silver coin to the left and a copper coin to the right if the crossing was below.\n\nThis led to:\n\nTait then defined “beknottedness” (now known as the twist number) as the excess of silver crossings over copper ones. If only diagrams without nugatory crossings were considered then Tait believed that this was a knot invariant. In fact it is not, but for alternating knots, it is an invariant and this fact is a consequence of Tait‘s second conjecture (a theorem since 1993). He tried other more obviously physical ideas such as considering the knot as a circuit and looking at the work done by a magnetic particle carried by a current in the knot. He tried another idea which at first looked very promising to him, namely the minimal number of crossings which required to be changed for under to over (or visa-versa) to unknot the knot. His first thought was that this would be half the beknottedness. He soon saw that this was not so. Seeing that the two concepts were distinct Tait changed his definitions and called the minimal number of crossings which required to be changed to unknot the diagram the beknottedness and he called the minimal number of crossings the knottiness.\n\nListing had introduced polynomials in to variables associated with a knot. These were produced by marking the four corners of a crossing l or r (for left of right) according to a rule which again related to over of under crossings. These polynomials were not invariants, however. Tait tried a similar idea where he marked the regions of the graph l or r and then connected r regions with a multiple bond of the order of the number of crossings on the boundary between the two regions. He was inspired to do this by analogy with chemical representations invented by his colleague (and brother-in-law) Alexander Crum Brown.\n\nBy 1877 Tait had classified all knots with seven crossings but he stopped there. He returned to the topic of knots in his address to the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1883:-\n\nWe find that it becomes a mere question of skilled labour to draw all the possible knots having any assigned number of crossings. The requisite labour increases with extreme rapidity as the number of crossings is increased. … I have not been able to find time to carry out this process further than the knots with seven crossings. … It is greatly desired that someone, with the requisite leisure, should try to extend this list, if possible up to 11 …\n\nKirkman read the text of Tait‘s address and began to work on classifying knots with more than seven crossings. He sent Tait his results on knot projections with up to nine crossings in May 1884 but he had not looked at the problem of deciding which of the projections led to equivalent knots. Taitworked on this side of the problem and, considering only alternating knots, solved the equivalence problems within a few weeks. Tait seemed to know how to tell whether two knots were equivalent without rigorous methods. He states this quite clearly in the paper he wrote tabulating the knots where he says that his methods have:-\n\n… the disadvantage of being to a greater or less extent tentative. Not that the rules laid down … leave any room for mere guessing, but they are too complex to be always completely kept in view. Thus we cannot be absolutely certain that by means of such processes we have obtained all the essentially different forms which the definition we employ comprehends.\n\nDespite the problems Tait knew exactly what he was doing for, remarkably, his tables are correct. When Kirkman sent him all knot projections with 10 crossings in January 1885 again Tait found all in equivalent knots. The tables were printed in September 1885 and again they are completely correct. By then he had received from Kirkman 1581 knot projections with 11 crossings and this time Tait felt that he did not have the time to solve the equivalence problem for these. However by this time an American mathematician and engineer Charles N Little had sent Tait knot tables which he had calculated and Little began to extend the tables to knots other than alternating ones, and to knots with eleven crossings.\n\nLight through the ages: Ancient Greece to Maxwell\n\nThe study of light has been a major topic in the study of mathematics and physics from ancient Greek times up to the present day. This study has on occasion been highly mathematical in nature while at other times it has more relevance to other scientific disciplines. In this article we take a broad look at the topic, although we will emphasis its more mathematical aspects.\n\nThe early Greek ideas on natural philosophy, and in particular on the nature of light, would influence the world for two thousand years. Empedocles, in the fifth century BC, postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. Now of course if this were true one could see at night, so Empedocles knew that things were somewhat more complicated than this and postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.\n\nNot everyone believed that sight was explained by a beam coming from the eye. Lucretius wrote in On the nature of the Universe (55 BC):-\n\nThe light and heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.\n\nDespite this remarkably accurate view, Lucretius’s views were not generally accepted and sight was still seen as emanating from the eye.\n\nLong before Lucretius, Euclid had made a mathematical study of light. He wrote Optica in about 300 BC in which he studied the properties of light which he postulated travelled in straight lines. He described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He did question sight being the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how if one closes ones eyes, then opens them at night one sees the stars immediately. Of course if the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem. In about 60 AD Heron made the interesting observation that when light is reflected by a mirror it travels along the path of least length. Ptolemy, about 80 years after Heron, studied light in his astronomical work. Through accurate measurements of positions of stars, he realised that light is refracted by the atmosphere.\n\nThe biggest breakthrough in ancient times was made by al-Haytham around 1000 AD. He argued that sight is due only to light entering the eye from an outside source and there is no beam from the eye itself. He gave a number of arguments to support this claim, the most persuasive being the camera obscura, or pinhole camera. Here light passes through a pinhole shining on a screen where an inverted image is observed. Anyone visiting Edinburgh in Scotland should go to see the camera obscura there near the top of the Royal Mile and marvel at just how effective the camera obscura is in this enjoyable tourist attraction.\n\nNow al-Haytham argued quite correctly that we see objects because the sun’s rays of light, which he believed to be streams of tiny particles travelling in straight lines, are reflected from objects into our eyes. He understood that light must travel at a large but finite velocity, and that refraction is caused by the velocity being different in different substances. He also studied spherical and parabolic mirrors, and understood how refraction by a lens will allow images to be focused and magnification to take place. He understood mathematically why a spherical mirror produces aberration.\n\nEuropean scholars who followed al-Haytham did not know of his work. It was not widely available in Europe until the final quarter of the 16th century. However, without making major advances on the Greeks, some Europeans did make some improvements. Grosseteste, in about 1220, stressed the significance of the properties of light to natural philosophy and in turn advocated using geometry to study light. He put forward theories of colour, however, which have little merit. Roger Bacon, about 50 years later, continued to follow his teacher Grosseteste in believing in the importance of the study of light and he did come up with some correct conclusions deduced from experiments carried out in a very scientific way. He believed that the velocity of light is finite, studied convex lenses and advocated their use to correct defective eyesight. About the same time at Roger Bacon was working on optics in England, Witelo was studying mirrors and refraction of light and wrote up his findings in Perspectiva which was a standard text on optics for several centuries.\n\nFollowing this there was improved understanding of using a lens, and by 1590 Zacharius Jensen even used compound lenses in a microscope. The first person to make a significant step forward after the time of al-Haytham, however, was Kepler at the beginning of the 17th century. Kepler worked on optics, and came up with the first correct mathematical theory of the camera obscura. He also gave the first correct explanation of how the human eye works, with an upside-down image formed on the retina. He correctly explained shortsight and longsight. He gave the important result that the intensity of light observed from a source varies inversely with the square of the distance of the observer from the source. He was wrong, however, in arguing that the velocity of light is infinite. He published his results were published in Supplements to Witelo, on the optical part of astronomy (1604). In fact an important discovery had been made earlier by Thomas Harriotwhen he discovered the sine law of refraction of light in 1601, but he did not publish the result.\n\nKepler‘s work was a nice piece of mathematics, but people did not believe that the eye created an upside-down image on the retina. The argument that we do not observe the world upside-down seemed convincing. Only about five years after the publication of Kepler‘s work, Galileo constructed a telescope, following ideas of Hans Lippershey from the Netherlands who had constructed one in the previous year. Galileo turned his telescope on Jupiter in 1610 and observed its four major moons. Thomas Harriot in England observed the moons of Jupiter in the same year. In 1611 Kepler published Dioptrice which was another important work on optics. It described how one could put lenses together to give what today is called a telephoto lens. It also described total internal reflection but failed to give the correct law of refraction of light, Harriot‘s result being unknown to Kepler (or anyone else) although the two had corresponded.\n\nWillebrord Snell discovered the sine law of refraction of light in 1621 but, like Harriot, he did not publish the result. The first to publish the law was Descartes in 1637. In was contained in La Dioptrique published as a supplement to Discours de la méthod pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher la vérité dans les sciences. Descartes and Fermat carried on a discussion after this publication (see [47] for details) and Fermat initially assumed that they had reached a different law since they had started from different assumptions. Fermat proposed that light follows the path which takes the shortest time, enabling Snell‘s law of refraction to be deduced mathematically. Other contributions around this time by Descartes was his belief in the mathematical argument by Kepler which showed that the image formed on the retina of the eye should be upside-down. He conducted an experiment with the eye of a dead ox, scraping away the retina and seeing that indeed the image was upside-down. Some of Descartes‘ claims were fallacious such as his belief that the velocity of light is infinite. He stated, rather foolishly, that he staked his philosophy on that fact.\n\nIn 1647 Cavalieri published an important contribution to optics when he gave the relationship between the curvature of a thin lens and its focal length. Inspired by Kepler‘s discoveries on light, James Gregory had begun to work on lenses and in Optica Promota (1663) he described the first practical reflecting telescope now called the Gregorian telescope. In fact Gregorymade a fundamental discovery about light a few years later while in St Andrews. He discovered diffraction by letting light pass through a feather but he was not the first to investigate this phenomenon as Grimaldi had studied it a few years earlier. Here is Gregory‘s description:-\n\nLet in the sun’s rays by a small hole to a darkened house, and at the hole place a feather (the more delicate and white the better for this purpose), and it shall direct to a white wall or paper opposite to it a number of small circles and ovals (if I mistake them not) whereof one is somewhat white (to wit, the middle which is opposite the sun) and all the rest severally coloured. I would gladly hear Mr Newton‘s thoughts of it.\n\nThe reference to Newton brings us to the person who revolutionised thinking on light. We now looking at the last third of the 17th century, a period where major theories on light would be put forward. These resulted from the contributions of Huygens, Hooke and Newton and two opposing theories were supported. In the 1660s Gassendi had put forward the particle theory, suggesting that light was composed of a stream of tiny particles, while Descartes suggested that space was filled with ‘plenum’ which transmitted pressure from a light source onto the eye. The wave theory by Huygens and Hooke was a development of Descartes‘ ideas where now they proposed that light be a wave through the plenum, while Newton supported the theory that light rays were composed of tiny particles. Let us first examine Newton‘s major contribution.\n\nWhen Newton experimented with passing light through a triangular glass prism in around 1666 it was well known that a spectrum of colours was produced. There was a standard explanation of this, namely that the pure while light was somehow corrupted in passing through the glass. The further it had to travel in the glass the more it was corrupted, hence the different colours that emerged. Newton carried out a very simple experiment. He placed a second triangular prism in the path of the coloured beams of light emerging from the first triangular prism, but he put the second prism the other way up that is standing on its point. The coloured rays of light entered this second prism and a single ray of white light emerged.\n\nNow having passed through the two prisms the light had passed through a longer distance of glass than if it had just passed through one, and it should have been further corrupted, but it was not. The true explanation was clear to Newton. The white light was not pure as believed, it was composed of light of the different colours which combined to give white light. Now Newtonused his understanding of colours to design telescopes which had as little chromatic aberration as possible. He now understood what caused chromatic aberration, the coloured fringes seen round objects viewed through a telescope. It was an almost necessary consequence of using lenses. To avoid the problem Newton designed a reflecting telescope.\n\nIn 1672 Newton published his theory of colour in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and in it he gave experimental evidence that light is composed of minute particles. A few years earlier another member of the Royal Society, Robert Hooke, had published a wave theory of light and his own theory of colours. He reacted to Newton‘s paper by claiming that what was original in the paper was wrong and what was correct in the paper was stolen from him. Nakajima discusses the Newton–Hooke controversy of 1672:-\n\nIt has not been sufficiently emphasized that there existed two kinds of modification theory of colours, Aristotle‘s modification theory and theDescartes–Hooke modification theory. This seems to have caused some confusion in the interpretation of the optical controversy between Newton and Hooke in1672. [We] present a new interpretation of the optical controversy of 1672.\n\nThe effect of the argument was to prevent Newton publishing his complete theory of light until after the death of Hooke in 1703. We should point out, however, that Newton‘s views did undergo changes between 1672 and the publication of Opticks in 1704. These are examined carefully .\n\nNow Hooke was not the only person to argue against Newton’s theory of light. Huygens was developing his wave theory of light at this time and by 1678 he had it worked out in all its mathematical details although he did not publish his Treatise on light until 1690. Like Newton, an interest in telescopes had prompted Huygens to try to understand the nature of light. He proposed a wave theory, but of course a wave has to travel through a medium so Huygens‘ model included an all pervading aether which carries the wave. This is similar to the way that sound waves travel. Sound waves travel in air and if a bell is placed in a vacuum then nothing is heard. Similarly, it was believed, light waves needed the aether through which to travel. It was a beautifully worked out theory and explained most of the observed phenomena of light such as reflection, refraction, diffraction etc.\n\nAfter Hooke‘s death, Newton published Opticks in 1704. It discussed the theory of light and colour and dealt with investigations of the colours of thin sheets, ‘Newton‘s rings’, and the diffraction of light. To explain some of his observations Newton had to argue that the corpuscles of light created waves in the aether. However, the work strongly argued for a corpuscular theory of light, with the most telling argument being that light travels in straight lines yet waves are seen to bend into a region of shadow. There was a possible way to distinguish between Newton‘s corpuscular theory and Huygens‘ wave theory. In the former theory it was necessary for light to travel faster in a more dense medium, while in the latter theory light needed to travel more slowly.\n\nIn fact the speed of light had been calculated by Römer a couple of years before Huygens had completed working out of his wave theory. In 1676 Römer used data from the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons to get the first reasonable value for the speed of light. He realised that the reason the time between eclipses of Jupiter’s moons by the planet was shorter when the Earth on the same side of the sun as Jupiter and became longer when Earth and Jupiter moved towards opposite sides of the sun was due to the time taken for light to cross the increased distance. He calculated the speed as 225,000 km per second, rather than the correct value of 299,792 km per second, but it was a remarkable achievement and a definite proof that the velocity of light is finite. However distinguishing between the wave theory and the corpuscular theory with experiments on the velocity were quite impossible at this time. It would not be until 1850 that Foucault showed that light travelled more slowly in water than in air showing that Newton was wrong.\n\nDuring the 18th century most opinion sided with Newton. He had been right on so many things that it was generally assumed that he must be right about light being corpuscular. Not everyone in the 18th century agreed, however, and when Euler published his work on optics Nova theoria lucis et colorum in 1746 it argued strongly for a wave theory of light. Diffraction was the hardest phenomenon to explain with a corpuscular theory, and Euler used it to support his wave theory. He argued strongly for an analogy between light and sound and consequently for the aether which carried light waves as air carries sound waves. The sun, said Euler, is “a bell ringing out light”. Euler‘s theory was in fact the second version of his wave theory of light and details of both theories are considered in [24].\n\nLittle progress had been made between Newton‘s Opticks of 1704 and Euler‘s optical work. Perhaps the most significant was James Bradley’s calculation of the velocity of light in 1727. This was still an astronomical method, but Bradley used observations of the aberration of light from stars. This is the apparent slight change in the positions of stars caused by the yearly motion of the Earth. It is worth noting that Bradley’s work provided first direct evidence that the Earth revolves around the sun.\n\nEuler‘s support of the wave theory did little to change the general belief in the corpuscular theory. Hakfoort studies the work of Nicolas Béguelin of 1772:-\n\nBeguelin compared the Newtonian emission theory of light and the wave theory of Leonhard Euler. Whereas others opted for one of the two theories by invoking arguments or authorities, Beguelin made a systematic search for experiments which he hoped would settle the dispute. Two of these experiments were most original. The first, which Beguelin himself performed, concerned light rays grazing a glass surface. For several reasons it did not have the impact it deserved. The second one was a thought experiment which was meant to illustrate a major tenet of the wave theory, that is, the analogy between light and sound. … neither of them brought the debate to an end.\n\nHowever Thomas Young produced a major piece of evidence in favour of the wave theory when he carried out experiments on the interference of light between 1797 and 1799 in Cambridge. Young placed a screen with two pin holes in it in front of a point source of light. He published his results in 1801, describing the pattern of dark and light bands seen on the screen behind the holes. He produced these interference patterns also using two slits and he explained the results using a wave theory. In fact he went further than this, explaining Newton‘s results in terms of his wave theory. The different colours of light, said Young, are different wavelengths of light. He related the amount of refraction of light, or diffraction of light, to its wavelength. According to Young, diffraction fringes occur as a result of interference between the incident wave and a wave arising from the edge of a diffracting aperture or body. He even calculated the wavelengths of the different colours using Newton‘s own experimental data. His explanation of interference, from his own words of 1807, is as follows :-\n\nThe middle of the pattern is always light, and the bright stripes on each side are at such distances that the light coming to them from one of the apertures must have passed through a longer space than that which comes from the other by an interval which is equal to the breadth of one, two, three, or more of the supposed wavelengths, while the intervening dark spaces correspond to a difference of half a supposed wavelength, of one and a half, of two and a half, or more.\n\nThis description is absolutely correct but it was difficult for people to accept. There is something very definitely counterintuitive in claiming that two rays of light could, under certain conditions, add to give darkness. We should note that Young made other notable discoveries about light, in particular he realised that colour vision was due to the "
