        "text": "By contrasting selected works of contemporary art with recent scientific develop- ments, it is possible to demonstrate that art today not only serves to comment on science, but also represents a form of research and knowledge production in its own right, though one belonging to a radically different epistemological tra- dition. Moving beyond the postulated dichotomy of the objective sciences and the subjective arts, contemporary art shows us that art is no longer limited to the production of beautiful artefacts, but has established its role as a legitimate form of knowledge production in its own right. The engagement of art with science ranges from artists’ iconological handling of scientific imaging to research projects executed as artistic endeavours by artists working in the laboratory. In the last two decades we have seen a number of ar- tists leave the traditional artistic playground to work instead in scientific contexts such as the laboratories of molecular biologists. Such artistic interventions in ge- netics and biological forms have made possible new means of artistic expression and art forms, like ‘Transgenic Art’ and ‘Bio-Art’. The use of technologies from the field of current research in the life science by artists ranges from tissue enginee- ring to stemcell technologies and even transgenic animals, a phenomenon that raises ethical questions with regard to both scientific and artistic endeavours. Visual illustrations have always been used in the natural sciences to make visible scientific relationships, to visualize theories, or to graphically capture the results of scientific experiments. Today the visualizations in modern Life Sciences range from advanced image technologies that offer evermore detailed views of the mi- crostructures of the organic world, to imagebased computer simulations that are no longer based upon a physical-biological reference system and that open up a new biotheoretical space, to representations become life, such as transgenetic animals and clones.\n\nThe connections between biological sciences, art and printed images are of great interest to the author. She reflects on the historical relevance of visual representations for science. She argues that the connection between art and science seems to have diminished during the twentieth century. However, this connection is currently growing stronger again through digital media and new imaging methods. Scientific illustrations have fuelled art, while visual modeling tools have assisted scientific research. As a print media artist, she explores the relationship between art and science in her studio practice and will present this historical connection with examples related to evolution, microbiology and her own work. Art and science share a common source, which leads to scrutiny and enquiry. Science sets out to reveal and explain our reality, whereas art comments and makes connections that don’t need to be tested by rigorous protocols. Art and science should each be evaluated on their own merit. Allowing room for both in the quest to understand our world will lead to an enriched experience.\n\nContemporary visual epistemic practices in the biological sciences raise new questions of how to transform an iconic data measurements into images, and how the process of an imaging technique may change the material it is ‘depicting’. This case-oriented study investigates microscopic imagery, which is used by system and synthetic biologists alike. The core argument is developed around the analysis of two recent methods, developed between 2003 and 2006: localization microscopy and photo-induced cell death. Far from functioning merely as illustrations of work done by other means, images can be determined as tools for discovery in their own right and as objects of investigation. Both methods deploy different constellations of intended and unintended interactions between visual appearance and underlying biological materiality. To characterize these new ways of interaction, the article introduces the notions of ‘operational images’ and ‘operational agency’. Despite all their novelty, operational images are still subject to conventions of seeing and depicting: Phenomena emerging with the new method of localization microscopy have to be designed according to image traditions of older, conventional fluorescence microscopy to function properly as devices for communication between physicists and biologists. The article emerged from a laboratory study based on interviews conducted with researchers from the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) at Bioquant, Heidelberg, in 2011.\n\nPopular media, art and science are intricately interlinked in contemporary visual culture. This book analyses the scientific imaginary that is the result of the profound effects of science upon the imagination, and conversely, of the imagination in and upon science. As scientific developments in genetics, information technology and cybernetics open up new possibilities of intervention in human lives, cultural theorists have explored the notion of the posthuman. The Scientific Imaginary in Visual Culture analyses figurations of the ›posthuman‹ in history and philosophy, as well as in its utopian and dystopian forms in art and popular culture. The authors thus address the blurring boundaries between art and science in diverse media like science fiction film, futurist art, video art and the new phenomenon of bio-art. In their evaluations of the scientific imaginary in visual culture, the authors engage critically with current scientific and technological concerns."
