        "text": "Guillaume: ‘I’ve known Boris for a really long time, here in Amsterdam. He belongs to a group of artists in the graffiti scene that really brought it to its own level — super special how he did it.’\n\nEdson: ‘In fact, he and Parra are ongoing legends. They’ve done a lot of things that people have imitated since.’\n\nGuillaume: ‘The same goes for Rich Medina. We’ve known him since the nineties.’\n\nEdson: ‘Rich owned a shop already in the 90s. He’s a proper centipede: a multi-tasker! Even back then he had a lot of knowledge as a DJ; he was the first to come up with that Fela Kuti shit.’\n\nGuillaume: ‘And then he came with his lectures. That blew me away. When people are that close to you, you sometimes take what they’re doing for granted. But his way of thinking really excites me.’\n\nEdson: ‘Initially Rich was doubting about his lectures. So I said to him: ‘Just talk your talk and turn your records. You’ve gotta do this.’ And then they hired him as a curator at Cornell University, the most important black university with an incredible library for hip-hop history. That lecture shit is crazy.’"
