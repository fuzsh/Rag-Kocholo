        "text": "Science Quotes by Emil DuBois-Reymond (3 quotes)\n\nEvery ambitious scholar, especially one who has already attained achievements equal to yours, is Humboldt’s son; we are all his family.\n\n— Emil DuBois-Reymond\n\nFundamentally, as is readily seen, there exists neither force nor matter. Both are abstractions of things, such as they are, looked at from different standpoints. They complete and presuppose each other. Isolated they are meaningless. … Matter is not a go-cart, to and from which force, like a horse, can be now harnessed, now loosed. A particle of iron is and remains exactly the same thing, whether it shoot through space as a meteoric stone, dash along on the tire of an engine-wheel, or roll in a blood-corpuscle through the veins of a poet. … Its properties are eternal, unchangeable, untransferable.\n\n— Emil DuBois-Reymond\n\nThe history of science is the real history of mankind.\n\n— Emil DuBois-Reymond"
