Changing countries doubles perspectives, I found. Much of my scientific work had and still has a comparative component. From the beginning of my career, and after finishing my study of educational science and sociology, I was interested in the social and cultural conditions of learning—an interest that inevitably focuses on underprivileged groups of learners and their living conditions (and my favorite book of my own work is still the one which I wrote in 1974, together with Burkhardt Söil, describing the school and life world of working class kids and their parents in a working class neighborhood in former West Berlin). Since the beginning of the 1980s, I am involved in various European networks and activities which aim to promote European unification and exchange. I think that one of the most exiting developments in contemporary societies is indeed the paradoxical relationality between growth of risks as well as chances for young people and I am concerned about the uneven spread of both, in Europe and elsewhere in the world. I regard myself as one of these 'lifelong learners' who we all will have to become and to be, never mind our age. I am a realist about the impact of scientific writing, so I do not think that my writings will change the world. But I strongly believe in cooperation and teamwork among scientists and together with my colleagues I work at 'bridge building' across countries and between people. Finally: I have learned a lot from my son who is now a young adult in a (post-)modern world, more than he could possibly imagine.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS"
