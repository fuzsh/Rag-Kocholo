        "text": "Rudolf Hermann, wind tunnels and aerodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLundquist, Charles A.; Coleman, Anne M.\n\n2008-04-01\n\nRudolf Hermann was born on December 15, 1904 in Leipzig, Germany. He studied at the University of Leipzig and at the Aachen Institute of Technology. His involvement with wind tunnels began in 1934 when Professor Carl Wieselsberger engaged him to work at Aachen on the development of a supersonic wind tunnel. On January 6, 1936, Dr. Wernher von Braun visited Dr. Hermann to arrange for use of the Aachen supersonic wind tunnel for Army problems. On April 1, 1937, Dr. Hermann became Director of the Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the Army installation at Peenemunde. Results from the Aachen and Peenemunde wind tunnels were crucial in achieving aerodynamic stability for the A-4 rocket, later designated as the V-2. Plans to build a Mach 10 'hypersonic' wind tunnel facility at Kochel were accelerated after the Allied air raid on Peenemunde on August 17, 1943. Dr. Hermann was director of the new facility. Ignoring destruction orders from Hitler as WWII approached an end in Europe, Dr. Hermann and his associates hid documents and preserved wind tunnel components that were acquired by the advancing American forces. Dr. Hermann became a consultant to the Air Force at its Wright Field in November 1945. In 1951, he was named professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. In 1962, Dr. Hermann became the first Director of the Research Institute at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), a position he held until he retired in 1970.\n\n27 CFR 9.71 - Hermann.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n...

But Hermann had an equally important second career in scientific administration: advising the UK Government on the Thames Barrier, as Director General of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO; now the European Space Agency (ESA)), as Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government on Defence and then on Energy, as Chairman of the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), and finally as Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was knighted in 1973. He continued his research on gravitational radiation throughout his administrative career and published his 16th paper in the series on gravitational waves in 2004. Hermann will be remembered not only for his contributions to science and administration, but for his outstanding communication skills and as a charismatic, warm, and stimulating person.\n\nHermann the Dalmatian as Astronomer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDadic, Z.\n\nHermann the Dalmatian was the subject of great controversy for philosophers, and here his work and translations are considered. As far as Hermann's work are concerned his prime interest for astronomy and astrology is stressed. Astrological \"predictions\" interested him primarely as predictions of events which are related to global questions, i.e. predicting the future course of events in the universe or destiny of nation as a whole, rather then the destiny of indivinduals. On the other hand it is also evident that Hremann with his knowledge of the Eastern, Arabic scientific tradition and the European spiritual tradition, become one of the most important scientists of his times. Hermann archieved a fruitful syntesis between the two traditions and opened new concepts in science. So he stands as a basic figure at the turning point of European science and the scientific endeavours from the 12th to the 15th century.\n\nWortschatzliste und Synonyme: Hermann Hesse, \"Siddhartha\" (Vocabulary List and Synonyms for Hermann Hesse's \"Siddhartha\").\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSchwartzburg, John A.\n\nThis vocabulary and synonym list for Hermann Hesse's \"Siddhartha\" (presently on the German Advanced Placement Program required reading list) is keyed to the Dunham and Wensinger edition published by the Macmillan Company.

(English Title: Hermann Oberth in Italy: \"Kid stuff\")\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBalestrieri, R.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAfter the Second World War, Italy sought to equip itself with surface-to-air missiles: first with its own projects, then acquiring equipment already developed by the USA. The LAGO Project of the Marina Militare was born for defensive purposes: it was defined with Hermann Oberth in 1950 and was developed in La Spezia from 1951 to 1953.\n\nThe 'chemistry of space': the sources of Hermann Grassmann's scientific achievements.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetsche, Hans-Joachim\n\n2014-10-01\n\nAlbert Lewis's article (Annals of Science, 1977) analysing the influence of Friedrich Schleiermacher on Hermann Grassmann, stimulated many different studies on the founder of n-dimensional outer algebra. Following a brief outline of the various, sometimes diverging, analyses of Grassmann's creative thinking, new research is presented which confirms Lewis's original contribution and widens it considerably. It will be shown that: i. Grassmann, although a self-taught mathematician, was at the centre of a hitherto understated intellectual trend, which was defining for Germany. Initiated by Pestalozzi's concept of elementary mathematical education and culminating in the modern mathematics of the late 19th Century, it was reflected in the contributions of Grassmann, Riemann, Jacobi and Eisenstein. ii. Hermann Grassmann, his father Justus, and his brother Robert were all demonstrably influenced by Schleiermacher's dialectic; however the two brothers responded to it in very different ways. iii. Whilst the more philosophical parts of Hermann's 1844 Extension Theory are characterised by the influence of Schleiermacher and also by the mathematical knowledge of his father, the entire development of this work is the unfolding of a single idea based on the father's interpretation of combinatorial multiplication as a 'chemical conjunction', which was developed largely dialectically by Hermann.\n\nHermann Paul and General Linguistic Theory\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKoerner, E.

The IRS distinguishes between the recruiting and the retention of physicians and perimts incentives beyond reasonable compensation in the former but not the latter circumstance. This new agreement, while not legally precedential, nevertheless provides guidance for healthcare organizations seeking safe harbor protection.\n\nHermann Mooser, Typhus, Warsaw 1941.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindenmann, Jean\n\n2002-01-01\n\nHermann Mooser (1891-1971), a Swiss rickettsiologist, sent his friend Peyton Rous (1879-1970) of the Rockefeller Institute (New York) a telegram on November 3, 1941, asking for financial help for the manufacture of typhus vaccine in Zurich for the Warsaw Ghetto. His explanatory letter from November 4 reached Rous too late to have any influence on the negative decision (by the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Red Cross) in this matter. Contrary to Weindling's affirmation Mooser was neither in Warsaw in 1941, nor was he a member of the Swiss Sanitary Missions to the eastern front.\n\nHermann Oppenheim's observations about music in aphasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraziano, Amy B; Pech, Anja; Hou, Craig; Johnson, Julene K\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHermann Oppenheim was influential in many areas of neurology, but his ideas about music are relatively unknown. In 1888, he published a paper that outlined how the assessment of music skills in patients with aphasia could lead to a better understanding of aphasia and language. Oppenheim conducted the first comprehensive music assessment as part of a neurologic examination and presented the first case series of music in aphasia. His paper was widely cited and had significant influence over the next 30 years. Although largely unrecognized as such, Oppenheim was an important historical figure in the study of music and neurology.\n\nHabitat assessment, Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJacobson, Robert B.; Laustrup, Mark S.; Reuter, Joanna M.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis report documents methods and results of aquatic habitat assessment in the Missouri River near Hermann, Missouri. The assessment is intended to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variability of aquatic habitat, including habitats thought to be critical for the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). Physical aquatic habitat - depth, velocity, and substrate - was assessed around 9 wing dikes and adjacent to the U.S. Route 19 bridge, at discharges varying from 44,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 146, 000 cfs during August 2000-May, 2001. For the river as a whole, velocities are bi-modally distributed with distinct peaks relating to navigation channel and wing-dike environments. Velocities predictably showed an increasing trend with increasing discharge. Substrate within wing dikes was dominated by mud at low discharges, whereas the navigation channel had patches of transporting sand, rippled sand, and coarse sand. Discharges that overtopped the wing dikes (about 93,000 cfs, March 2001) were associated with increases of patchy sand, rippled sand, and coarse sand within the wing dikes. When flows were substantially over the wing dikes (146,000 cfs, May 2001) substrates within most wing dikes showed substantial reorganization and coarsening. The habitat assessment provides a geospatial database that can be used to query wing dikes for distributions of depth, velocity, and substrate for comparison with fish samples collected by US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists (Grady and others, 2001). In addition, the assessment documented spatial and temporal variation in habitat within the Hermann reach and over a range of discharges. Measurable geomorphic change--alteration of substrate conditions plus substantial erosion and deposition--was associated with flows equaled or exceeded 12-40% of the time (40-140 days per year). Documented geomorphic change associated with high-frequency flows underscores the natural temporal variability of physical\n\nHermann Hankel's \"On the general theory of motion of fluids\". An essay including an English translation of the complete Preisschrift from 1861\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVillone, Barbara; Rampf, Cornelius\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe present is a companion paper to \"A contemporary look at Hermann Hankel's 1861 pioneering work on Lagrangian fluid dynamics\" by Frisch, Grimberg and Villone [Eur. Phys. J. H 42, 537-556 (2017)]. Here we present the English translation of the 1861 prize manuscript from GÃ¶ttingen University \"Zur allgemeinen Theorie der Bewegung der FlÃ¼ssigkeiten\" (On the general theory of the motion of the fluids) of Hermann Hankel (1839-1873), which was originally submitted in Latin and then translated into German by the Author for publication. We also provide the English translation of two important reports on the manuscript, one written by Bernhard Riemann and the other by Wilhelm Eduard Weber during the assessment process for the prize. Finally, we give a short biography of Hermann Hankel with his complete bibliography.\n\nThe Hermann Weyl Prize - Laudatio for Guilio Chiribella\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\ndel Olmo, M. A.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe Hermann Weyl Prize was created in 2000 by the Standing Committee of the International Group Theory Colloquium. The purpose of the Weyl Prize is to provide recognition for young scientists (younger than 35) who have performed original work of significant scientific quality in the area of understanding physics through symmetries. The Hermann Weyl Prize consists of a certificate citing the accomplishments of the recipient, prize money of $500 and an allowance towards the attendance of the bi-annual International Group Theory Colloquium at which the award is presented. The previous winners of the award were: Edward Frenkel (2002), Nikita A Nekrasov (2004), Boyko Bakalov (2006) and Mohammad M Sheikh-Jabbari (2008). The Selection Committee of the Weyl Prize 2010 consisted of S T Ali (Concordia University), E Corrigan (Durham Univeristy), P Kulish (St Petersburg Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences), R Mosseri (CNRS Paris) and M A del Olmo (University of Valladolid, chairman). This committee has made the following announcement: The Weyl Prize for the year 2010 was awarded to Dr Giulio Chiribella, in recognition of his pioneering work on the application of group theoretical methods in Quantum Information Theory. In particular, for providing a general solution to the problem of optimal estimation of symmertry transformations based on the notion of quantum entanglement between representation and multiplicity spaces, for the derivation of optimal protocols for the alignment of quantum reference frames, for the characterization of extreme quantum measurements in finite dimensions, for the proof of equivalence between asymptotic cloning and state estimation and for the proof of the optimality of measure-and-reprepare for quantum learning of unitary transformations.

Initially, these isolates were characterized as representing Campylobacterfetus subsp. fetus by multiplex PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Further whole- genome characterization revealed considerable differences compared to other Campylobacter species. A polyphasic study was then undertaken to determine the exact taxonomic position of the isolates. The three strains were characterized by conventional phenotypic tests and whole genome sequencing. We generated robust phylogenies that showed a distinct clade containing only these strains using the 16S rRNA and atpA genes and a set of 40 universal proteins. Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates their designation as representing a novel species and this was further confirmed using whole- genome average nucleotide identity within the genus Campylobacter (~80â%). Compared to most Campylobacter species, these strains hydrolysed hippurate, and grew well at 25âÂ°C but not at 42âÂ°C. Phenotypic and genetic analyses demonstrate that the three Campylobacter strains isolated from the western Hermann's tortoise represent a novel species within the genus Campylobacter, for which the name Campylobactergeochelonis sp. nov. is proposed, with RC20T (=DSM 102159T=LMG 29375T) as the type strain.\n\nThe Receding Animal: Theorizing Anxiety and Attachment in Psychoanalysis from Freud to Imre Hermann.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarinelli, Lydia; Mayer, Andreas\n\n2016-03-01\n\nArgument Animals played an important role in the formation of psychoanalysis as a theoretical and therapeutic enterprise. They are at the core of texts such as Freud's famous case histories of Little Hans, the Rat Man, or the Wolf Man. The infantile anxiety triggered by animals provided the essential link between the psychology of individual neuroses and the ambivalent status of the \"totem\" animal in so-called primitive societies in Freud's attempt to construct an anthropological basis for the Oedipus complex in Totem and Taboo. In the following, we attempt to track the status of animals as objects of indirect observation as they appear in Freud's classical texts, and in later revisionist accounts such as Otto Rank's Trauma of Birth and Imre Hermann's work on the clinging instinct. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Freudian conception of patients' animal phobias is substantially revised within Hermann's original psychoanalytic theory of instincts which draws heavily upon ethological observations of primates. Although such a reformulation remains grounded in the idea of \"archaic\" animal models for human development, it allows to a certain extent to empiricize the speculative elements of Freud's later instinct theory (notably the death instinct) and to come to a more embodied account of psychoanalytic practice.\n\nHermann Carl Vogel's report on a tour to England, Scotland and Ireland in the year 1875. (German Title: Hermann Carl Vogels Bericht Ã¼ber eine Reise nach England, Schottland und Irland im Jahr 1875)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVogel, Hermann Carl; GuÃmann, Ernst-August; Dick, Wolfgang R.\n\nIn the summer of 1875 Hermann Carl Vogel made a tour to Great Britain with regard to the founded but not yet erected Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam. A report on this tour written by him is published here for the first time. It contains Vogel's impressions of observatories and other institutions in London (including Greenwich and Kew), Gateshead near Newcastle on Tyne, Edinburgh, Dun Echt near Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, Birr Castle near Parsonstown, and Oxford.\n\nSome notes on \"Leaves of Memory\", the autobiography of Hermann Kobold\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVollmer, R.; Vollmer, H.; Duerbeck, H. W.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWe briefly describe the life of the astronomer Hermann Kobold, who lived from 1858 to 1942. He worked at the observatories of O'Gyalla, Strasbourg and Kiel, and was also involved in the observations and reductions of the German Venus transit project, 1874/82. His autobiography spans the time between his youth and his leave from Strasbourg in 1902. The subsequent time as observer and professor in Kiel and long-time editor of the Astronomische Nachrichten is not covered. The autobiography \"Blaetter der Erinnerung\" (Leaves of memeory), presented in the subsequent article, was written in his late age when he was already blind, using a special device. We also present some photographs of Kobold and his contemporaries, taken in Gottingen, O'Gyalla, Aiken (South Carolina), and Strasbourg.\n\nSex-specific ecophysiological responses to environmental fluctuations of free-ranging Hermann's tortoises: implication for conservation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSibeaux, AdÃ©laÃ¯de; Michel, Catherine Louise; Bonnet, Xavier; Caron, SÃ©bastien; FourniÃ¨re, KÃ©vin; Gagno, Stephane; Ballouard, Jean-Marie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPhysiological parameters provide indicators to evaluate how organisms respond to conservation actions. For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises ( Testudo hermanni hermanni ), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.\n\nBody condition and habitat use by Hermann's tortoises in burnt and intact habitats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLecq, S.; Ballouard, J.-M.; Caron, S.; Livoreil, B.; Seynaeve, V.; Matthieu, L.-A.; Bonnet, X.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn Mediterranean regions, fires threaten terrestrial tortoises. Nevertheless, varying proportions of adults survive fire; these surviving individuals can play a central role for population recovery. The regions devastated by fire often include important habitat of Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), so assessing the ability of survivors to persist is essential for conserving the species. Body-condition indices provide an integrative estimate of how well individuals cope with environmental variations and impacts, including fires. Between 2002 and 2009, we monitored Hermann's tortoises in intact and burnt habitats in southeastern France. In summer 2003, a strong fire ravaged half of the surveyed zone, providing an opportunity to compare body condition of tortoises between intact and burnt areas over time. Six years later, the impact of fire on vegetation was still marked; large trees were abundant in the intact area, whereas open shrub vegetation prevailed in the burnt area. In both areas, the mean body condition of tortoises fluctuated over time; however, there were no differences between the two areas. A radio-tracking experiment demonstrated that individuals from each area were residents, and not vagrants commuting between areas. We also assessed changes in body condition and microhabitat use in radio-tracked individuals. We found no significant differences between the tortoises living in the burnt and intact areas, despite subtle differences in habitat use. In conclusion: (i)â surviving tortoises in an area ravaged by fire can maintain their body condition like individuals living in an intact area, and thus, individuals from burnt areas should not be translocated to supposedly better areas; and (ii)â depopulated burnt areas are likely to be appropriate for population-augmentation programmes.

This article aims to contribute to recent efforts to overcome the gaps in the historiography of contemporary psychology, which are the result of an empiricist bias. To this end, we present an analysis of the way in which Hermann von Helmholtz's theory of perception resonates with Johann Gottlieb Fichte's Ego-doctrine. It will be argued that this indebtedness is particularly clear when focusing on the foundation of the differential awareness of subject and object in perception. In doing so, the widespread reception of Helmholtz's work as proto-positivist or strictly empiricist is challenged, in favor of the claim that important elements of his theorizing can only be understood properly against the background of Fichte's Ego-doctrine.

Hermann Weyl's contribution to neutrino physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis paper focuses on Hermann Weyl's two-component theory and frames it within the early development of different theories of spinors and the history of the discovery of parity violation in weak interactions. In order to show the implications of Weyl's theory, the paper discusses the case study of Ettore Majorana's symmetric theory of electron and positron (1937), as well as its role in inspiring Case's formulation of parity violation for massive neutrinos in 1957. In doing so, this paper clarifies the relevance of Weyl's and Majorana's theories for the foundations of neutrino physics and emphasizes which conceptual aspects of Weyl's approach led to Lee's and Yang's works on neutrino physics and to the solution of the theta-tau puzzle in 1957. This contribution thus sheds a light on the alleged \"re-discovery\" of Weyl's and Majorana's theories in 1957, by showing that this did not happen all of a sudden. On the contrary, the scientific community was well versed in applying these theories in the 1950s on the ground of previous studies that involved important actors in both Europe and United States.\n\n[\"With paper, pencil, and slide rule.\" Cancer specialist Hermann Druckrey in internment camp Hammelburg (1946-1947)].\n\nPubMed\n\nWunderlich, Volker\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAfter World War II, Hermann Druckrey and Karl KÃ¼pfmÃ¼ller spent many months in allied internment camps in Germany. In camp Hammelburg, the scholars formed a research collaboration which resulted in two very important publications. Druckrey informed Adolf Butenandt about the co-operation in personal letters which have recently become accessible. Through this new source, the origins of the Druckrey-KÃ¼pfmÃ¼ller papers of 1948-1949 have been confirmed and some further details have been added.\n\n[Scientific theoretical founding of medicine as a natural science by Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894)].\n\nPubMed\n\nNeumann, J N\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIn this study an attempt will be made to discuss the epistemological problems in the theory and practice of modern technical medicine in the writings of Hermann von Helmholz. An inquiry into the relationship between von Helmholtz' thinking and the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant is followed by the characteristics of von Helmholtz' philosophy of science which he himself called \"empirical theory\". The question of medicine as a science finally leads to the main problem of medical epistemology, viz., the relationship between theoretical knowledge and practice in medicine. In this context the anthropological dimension is brought into consideration.\n\nWhy is the World four-dimensional? Hermann Weylâs 1955 argument and the topology of causation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper approaches the question of space dimensionality by discussing a neglected argument proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1955. In Why is the World Four-Dimensional? (1955), Weyl offered a different argument from the one generally attributed to him and presented in Raum-Zeit-Materie. In the first sections of the paper, this new argument and its features are spelled-out, and in the last section, I shall develop some useful remarks on the concept of topology of causation that can still inform our reflection on the dimensionality of the world.\n\nThe Hermann-Hering grid illusion demonstrates disruption of lateral inhibition processing in diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavies, Nigel P; Morland, Antony B\n\n2002-02-01\n\nThe Hermann-Hering grid illusion consists of dark illusory spots perceived at the intersections of horizontal and vertical white bars viewed against a dark background. The dark spots originate from lateral inhibition processing. This illusion was used to investigate the hypothesis that lateral inhibition may be disrupted in diabetes mellitus. A computer monitor based psychophysical test was developed to measure the threshold of perception of the illusion for different bar widths. The contrast threshold for illusion perception at seven bar widths (range 0.09 degrees to 0.60 degrees) was measured using a randomly interleaved double staircase. Convolution of Hermann-Hering grids with difference of Gaussian receptive fields was used to generate model sensitivity functions. The method of least squares was used to fit these to the experimental data. 14 diabetic patients and 12 control subjects of similar ages performed the test. The sensitivity to the illusion was significantly reduced in the diabetic group for bar widths 0.22 degrees, 0.28 degrees, and 0.35 degrees (p = 0.01). The mean centre:surround ratio for the controls was 1:9.1 (SD 1.6) with a mean correlation coefficient of R(2) = 0.80 (SD 0.16). In the diabetic group, two subjects were unable to perceive the illusion. The mean centre:surround ratio for the 12 remaining diabetic patients was 1:8.6 (SD 2.1). However, the correlation coefficients were poor with a mean of R(2) = 0.54 (SD 0.27), p = 0.04 in comparison with the control group. A difference of Gaussian receptive field model fits the experimental data well for the controls but does not fit the data obtained for the diabetics. This indicates dysfunction of the lateral inhibition processes in the post-receptoral pathway.\n\n[\"... mein Recht muss mir werden!\" Hermann Bahr's tragicomedy Der Querulant (1914)].\n\nPubMed\n\nGaderer, Rupert\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, people who became notorious for their excessive engagement in legal proceedings started being labeled as \"querulents\" or \"paranoid litigants\". The term \"querulents\" first appeared in the General Order of the Court for the Prussian States (Allgemeine Gerichtsardnung fÃ¼r die Preussischen Staaten) from July 6, 1793. From there on, the spectrum of juridical measures undertaken against the so-labeled litigators included classifying these persons as ineligible for legal action and psychiatric hospitalization. The paper discusses to what extent Hermann Bahr rearranges psychiatric and legal knowledge about this special type of the complainer in his tragi- comedy Der Querulant, premiered in 1914. This concerns, first, the theatricality of the body and speech, secondly, the use of cultural techniques of writing and, thirdly, conflict- ing notions of justice. Therefore, the paper analyzes the aesthetic function of querulous behavior in the dramatic structure of the play from the point of view of both media theory and literary theory.\n\nMemorial Hermann: high reliability from board to bedside.\n\nPubMed\n\nShabot, M Michael; Monroe, Douglas; Inurria, Juan; Garbade, Debbi; France, Anne-Claire\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn 2006 the Memorial Hermann Health System (MHHS), which includes 12 hospitals, began applying principles embraced by high reliability organizations (HROs). Three factors support its HRO journey: (1) aligned organizational structure with transparent management systems and compressed reporting processes; (2) Robust Process Improvement (RPI) with high-reliability interventions; and (3) cultural establishment, sustainment, and evolution. The Quality and Safety strategic plan contains three domains, each with a specific set of measures that provide goals for performance: (1) \"Clinical Excellence;\" (2) \"Do No Harm;\" and (3) \"Saving Lives,\" as measured by the Serious Safety Event rate. MHHS uses a uniform approach to performance improvement--RPI, which includes Six Sigma, Lean, and change management, to solve difficult safety and quality problems. The 9 acute care hospitals provide multiple opportunities to integrate high-reliability interventions and best practices across MHHS. For example, MHHS partnered with the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare in its inaugural project to establish reliable hand hygiene behaviors, which improved MHHS's average hand hygiene compliance rate from 44% to 92% currently. Soon after compliance exceeded 85% at all 12 hospitals, the average rate of central line-associated bloodstream and ventilator-associated pneumonias decreased to essentially zero. MHHS's size and diversity require a disciplined approach to performance improvement and systemwide achievement of measurable success. The most significant cultural change at MHHS has been the expectation for 100% compliance with evidence-based quality measures and 0% incidence of patient harm.\n\n[Fatal diseases and \"imaginary\" suffering. \"Hypochondria\" and \"consumption\" in the correspondence between Jean Paul and Johann Bernhard Hermann, with a perspective on Jean Paul's literature and aesthetics].\n\nPubMed\n\nMeier, Monika\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe German writerJean Paul (Johann Paul Friedrich Richter, 1763-1825) and his friendJohann Bernhard Hermann (1761-1790) became acquainted with the thoughts of late Enlightenment at the University of Leipzig. They particularly appreciated the anthropology of Ernst Platner, who taught philosophy and aesthetics as well as medicine. Their confidential correspondence contains reflections on their respective situation and well being. Both write about feeling ill and label their illness \"hypochondria\". In the course of the correspondence Jean Paul's understanding of hypochondria evolves from an illness of the entrails as he follows Hermann, who supports the modern concept of hypochondria as an illness of the nerves. Two important themes from this correspondence recur in Jean Paul's novels and tales: firstly, his way of expressing comfort is related to his aesthetics, and secondly, the satirical way of portraying at least certain aspects of illness as imaginary reappears in his first successful novel \"The Invisible Lodge\" (1793).\n\nHermann Karsten, pioneer of geologic mapping in northwestern South America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAalto, K. R.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the late 19th century, a regional map of Nueva Granada (present-day Colombia, Panama and parts of Venezuela and Ecuador) was published by German botanist and geologist Hermann Karsten (1817-1908). Karsten's work was incorporated by AgustÃ­n Codazzi (1793-1859), an Italian who emigrated to Venezuela and Colombia to serve as a government cartographer and geographer, in his popular Atlas geogrÃ¡fico e histÃ³rico de la Republica de Colombia (1889). Geologic mapping and most observations provided in this 1889 atlas were taken from Karsten's GÃ©ologie de l'ancienne Colombie bolivarienne: VÃ©nÃ©zuela, Nouvelle-Grenade et Ecuador (1886), as cited by Manual Paz and/or Felipe PÃ©rez, who edited this edition of the atlas. Karsten defined four epochs in Earth history: Primera - without life - primary crystalline rocks, Segunda - with only marine life - chiefly sedimentary rocks, Tercera - with terrestrial quadrupeds and fresh water life forms life - chiefly sedimentary rocks, and Cuarta - mankind appears, includes diluvial (glacigenic) and post-diluvial terranes. He noted that Colombia is composed of chiefly of Quaternary, Tertiary and Cretaceous plutonic, volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and that Earth's internal heat (calor central) accounted, by escape of inner gases, for volcanism, seismicity and uplift of mountains. Karsten's regional mapping and interpretation thus constitutes the primary source and ultimate pioneering geologic research.\n\nIntroduction to the special issue Hermann Weyl and the philosophy of the 'New Physics'\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Bianchi, Silvia; Catren, Gabriel\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis Special Issue Hermann Weyl and the Philosophy of the 'New Physics' has two main objectives: first, to shed fresh light on the relevance of Weyl's work for modern physics and, second, to evaluate the importance of Weyl's work and ideas for contemporary philosophy of physics. Regarding the first objective, this Special Issue emphasizes aspects of Weyl's work (e.g. his work on spinors in n dimensions) whose importance has recently been emerging in research fields across both mathematical and experimental physics, as well as in the history and philosophy of physics. Regarding the second objective, this Special Issue addresses the relevance of Weyl's ideas regarding important open problems in the philosophy of physics, such as the problem of characterizing scientific objectivity and the problem of providing a satisfactory interpretation of fundamental symmetries in gauge theories and quantum mechanics. In this Introduction, we sketch the state of the art in Weyl studies and we summarize the content of the contributions to the present volume.\n\nHermann Cohen's Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode: The history of an unsuccessful book.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiovanelli, Marco\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis paper offers an introduction to Hermann Cohen's Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode (1883), and recounts the history of its controversial reception by Cohen's early sympathizers, who would become the so-called 'Marburg school' of Neo-Kantianism, as well as the reactions it provoked outside this group. By dissecting the ambiguous attitudes of the best-known representatives of the school (Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer), as well as those of several minor figures (August Stadler, Kurd Lasswitz, Dimitry Gawronsky, etc.), this paper shows that Das Princip der Infinitesimal-Methode is a unicum in the history of philosophy: it represents a strange case of an unsuccessful book's enduring influence. The \"puzzle of Cohen's Infinitesimalmethode,\" as we will call it, can be solved by looking beyond the scholarly results of the book, and instead focusing on the style of philosophy it exemplified. Moreover, the paper shows that Cohen never supported, but instead explicitly opposed, the doctrine of the centrality of the 'concept of function', with which Marburg Neo-Kantianism is usually associated.

Phys. J. H 42, 557-609 (2017)]. Here we give a critical assessment of Hankel's work, which covers many important aspects of fluid dynamics considered from a Lagrangian-coordinates point of view: variational formulation in the spirit of Hamilton for elastic (barotropic) fluids, transport (we would now say Lie transport) of vorticity, the Lagrangian significance of Clebsch variables, etc. Hankel's work is also put in the perspective of previous and future work. Hence, the action spans about two centuries: from Lagrange's 1760-1761 Turin paper on variational approaches to mechanics and fluid mechanics problems to Arnold's 1966 founding paper on the geometrical/variational formulation of incompressible flow. The 22-year-old Hankel - who was to die 12 years later â emerges as a highly innovative master of mathematical fluid dynamics, fully deserving Riemann's assessment that his Preisschrift contains \"all manner of good things.\"\n\nHermann Wilhelm Abich im Kaukasus: Zum zweihundertsten Geburtstag\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeibold, Ilse; Seibold, Eugen\n\n2006-11-01\n\nHermann Abich was born in 1806 in Berlin and died in 1886 in Graz. He grew up in a wealthy family which had friendly relations with famous scientists like Alexander von Humboldt, Leopold von Buch or Carl Ritter. After his studies in Heidelberg and Berlin he turned to extended fieldwork at the volcanoes of Italy. In 1833 1834 he published excellent petrological/chemical results and got soon a good scientific reputation. Thus he was nominated as Professor for Geology and Mineralogy of the prestigious Russian University in Dorpat (now Tartu, Esthonia) in 1842. In 1844 he was sent to Armenia by the Russian authorities. For the next three decades his fieldwork with about 190 publications was concentrated on the Great and Lesser Caucasus. This was a period of Russian expansion to the South with long-lasting regional fights. But he enjoyed the support of powerful governors. He was an indefatigable and enthusiastic explorer and a precise observer and designer. His interests covered many fields: morphology, glaciology, structural geology, volcanology with Thermal Springs, mineral resources from hydrocarbons, coal, salt to ores, stratigraphy and paleontology as a base for geological maps. But he also gave advice for practical problems, and he was active in meteorology, botany and archaeology. Alltogether he became âthe Father of Caucasus Geologyâ. The following sketch stresses only on three aspects of his activities. He was one of the first pioneers in hydrocarbon exploration, especially around the anticlines with the mud volcanoes near Baku. In many respects, however, his fundamental ideas were erronous. He explained the structure of the Great Caucasus by the traditional theories of Leopold von Buch and Elie de Beaumont. The Caucasus anticline âwas elevated by forces acting from beneathâ. Following them he tried to discover regularities in the strike of mountain chains. Similarily he treated volcanism like Alexander von Humboldt and Leopold von Buch with their two\n\nExcerpt from Medicinische Psychologie oder Physiologie der Seele by Dr Rudolph Hermann Lotze.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerrios, G E\n\n2005-03-01\n\nHermann Lotze (1817-81) is a neglected figure in the history of psychiatry although it has been claimed that his early views were influential, for example, on the young Griesinger. Trained as a physician, psychologist and philosopher he saw better than many the impending epistemological crisis that was to affect disciplines such as psychology and medical psychology as they were being taken over by the natural sciences. The problem he endeavoured to resolve was double-headed. On the one hand, Lotze believed that the mechanisms proposed by physiology and other relevant natural sciences were essential to the explanation of human behaviour provided that its meaning and context were respected; on the other, he wanted to do away with the mysterious (metaphysical) explanations such as 'vital force' which in his time were still popular in biology. The solutions he eventually offered can understandably be seen as a weak compromise and one which statisfied no one. Materialists Ã outrance such as Vogt, BÃ¼chner, Lange and Ribot though he was too 'metaphysical'; spiritualist philosophers believed that he had surrendered too much to biology. It is likely that Lotze remained, in fact, a metaphysician as can be ascertained by studying his concept of Seele (soul, mind) into which he packed enough furniture to make many believe that he was an idealist thinker. This paper discusses some of these issues and justifies the choice of classic text, namely, Lotze's illuminating Introduction to his book Medicinische Psychologie oder Physiologie der Seele.\n\nHematologic and plasma biochemical changes associated with fenbendazole administration in Hermann's tortoises (testudo hermanni).\n\nPubMed\n\nNeiffer, Donald L; Lydick, Dianna; Burks, Kyle; Doherty, Donna\n\n2005-12-01\n\nToxicosis associated with benzimidazole anthelmintics has been reported with increasing frequency in zoologic collections. Clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and gross and histologic lesions are primarily the result of damage to the gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems. Profound leukopenia, especially granulocytopenia, is the most common and severe clinicopathologic change associated with benzimidazole administration. Death usually occurs from overwhelming systemic bacterial and/or fungal infections secondary to severe immunosuppression. In this 125-day study, six male Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) were treated orally with two 5-day courses of fenbendazole 2 wk apart at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Serial blood samples were used to assess hematologic and plasma biochemical changes before, during, and following the treatment period. Although the tortoises remained healthy, blood sampling indicated an extended heteropenia with transient hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and equivocal hyperproteinemia/hyperglobulinemia, which were considered to be in response to fenbendazole administration. Changes in several other clinicopathologic parameters appeared to correlate with fenbendazole administration. The hematologic and biochemical changes seen in the healthy animals in this study should be considered when treating compromised tortoises with fenbendazole. Hematologic and plasma biochemical status of tortoises/reptiles should be determined before treatment and monitored during the treatment period. The risk of mortality of an individual from nematode infection should be assessed relative to the potential for metabolic alteration and secondary septicemia following damage to hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems by fenbendazole.\n\n[Story of three SS dentists during World War II: Pr Hugo Blaschke, Dr Hermann Pook and Dr Willy Frank].\n\nPubMed\n\nRiaud, Xavier\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThis story of three SS dentists shows very clearly that the medical code of ethics, under a totalitarian regime, ends where ideology begins. Professor Hugo Blaschke provided dental care to the most eminent Nazi leaders, but he also was the senior SS dentist. He was in charge of dental care in the Waffen-SS, and therefore, he had responsibility for the stocks of dental gold collected from the mouths of those who died in the concentration camps, in order to make dentures for his soldiers. Dr Hermann Pook was the dentist in charge of all the other dentists practising in the concentration camps. He was responsible for gathering statistics on the dental care provided for prisoners in the camps. His instructions were very clear: \"No conservation or restorative treatment. Only extractions, and with no anaesthesia!\" He was also in charge of gathering the gold that was collected in the camps, for the financial department of the SS. Dr Willy Frank, an Auschwitz dentist, took part in the selection of some of the convoys for the gas chambers. His participation in the collection of gold from the mouths of the dead was also established. These three men were sentenced to prison for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.\n\nIN MEMORIAM: Hermann Anton Haus, 1925 2003\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2004-08-01\n\nPhotograph Hermann Anton Haus, an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was to have been a Keynote Speaker at the Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics Conference, from which the papers in this special issue derive. Sadly, on May 21, 2003 - less than two weeks before the conference - Professor Haus succumbed to a heart attack after arriving home in Lexington, Massachusetts, from his regular, 15-mile commute by bicycle from MIT. He was 77. Throughout his lengthy and illustrious career, Professor Haus had repeatedly and very successfully addressed problems of fluctuations and noise, with special focus on the fundamental issues that arise in quantum optics. To honour Professor Haus' legacy to our technical community, this special issue of Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics is dedicated to his memory. Professor Haus was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in the former Yugoslavia, on 8 August 1925. After attending the Technische Hochschule, Graz, and the Technische Hochschule, Wien, in Austria, he received his Bachelor of Science degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York in 1949. In 1951, he graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and came to MIT, where he earned his Doctorate of Science and joined the faculty in 1954. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1958, to Professor in 1962, and to Elihu Thomson Professor in 1973. In 1986, he was conferred the honour of Institute Professor. Professor Haus had a lifelong fascination with noise. While still an undergraduate at Union College, he became aware of Norbert Wiener's theories of statistical phenomena - the new mathematics needed to understand and quantify the random fluctuations we refer to as noise. So it was that noise theory formed the core of Professor Haus' research during the 1950s: noise in electron beams, noise in microwave amplifiers, and noise in amplifier cascades.

The topics discussed in this issue extend from fundamental physics to applications of noise and fluctuational methods from quantum to classical systems, and include: bullet Quantum measurement bullet Quantum squeezing bullet Solitons and fibres bullet Gravitational wave inferometers bullet Fluorescence phenomena bullet Cavity QED bullet Photon statistics bullet Noise in lasers and laser systems bullet Quantum computing and information bullet Quantum lithography bullet Teleportation. This Special Issue is published in connection with the SPIE International Symposium on Fluctuations and Noise, held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on 1-4 June 2003. The symposium contained six parallel conferences, and the papers in this Special Issue are connected to the conference entitled `Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics'. This was the first in a series of symposia organized with the support of the SPIE that have greatly contributed to progress in this area. The co-founders of the symposium series were Laszlo B Kish (Texas A&M University) and Derek Abbott (The University of Adelaide). The Chairs of the `Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics' conference were Derek Abbott, Jeffrey H Shapiro and Yoshihisa Yamamoto. The practical aspects of the organization were ably handled by Kristi Kelso and Marilyn Gorsuch of the SPIE, USA. Sadly, less than two weeks before the conference, Hermann A Haus passed away. Hermann Haus was a founding father of the field of noise in optics and quantum optics. He submitted three papers to the conference and was very excited to attend; as can be seen in the collection of papers, he was certainly present in spirit. In honour of his creativity and pioneering work in this field, we have\n\nDynamical systems defined on infinite dimensional lie algebras of the ''current algebra'' or ''Kac-Moody'' type\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHermann, Robert\n\n1982-07-01\n\nRecent work by Morrison, Marsden, and Weinstein has drawn attention to the possibility of utilizing the cosymplectic structure of the dual of the Lie algebra of certain infinite dimensional Lie groups to study hydrodynamical and plasma systems. This paper treats certain models arising in elementary particle physics, considered by Lee, Weinberg, and Zumino; Sugawara; Bardacki, Halpern, and Frishman; Hermann; and Dolan. The lie algebras involved are associated with the ''current algebras'' of Gell-Mann. This class of Lie algebras contains certain of the algebras that are called ''Kac-Moody algebras'' in the recent mathematics and mathematical physics literature.\n\nPigment characterization of important golden age panel paintings of the 17th century\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPiÄta, Ewa; Proniewicz, Edyta; Szmelter-Fausek, BoÅ¼ena; Olszewska-Åwietlik, Justyna; Proniewicz, Leonard M.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nSamples were obtained from two world-famous 17th century panel paintings of the GdaÅsk school of panting: 'Seven Acts of Charity' (1607, in St. Mary's Church in GdaÅsk, Poland) by Anton MÃ¶ller and 'Angelic Concert' (1611, in Diocesan Museum in Pelplin, Poland) by Hermann Han. Micro-Raman spectroscopy (MRS), optical microscopy (OM), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy studies of the samples were performed to characterize the pigments present in the individual painting layers (a rich palette of white, black, blue, red, and yellow pigments) and the pictorial techniques used by the artists.\n\nWeyl's search for a difference between 'physical' and 'mathematical' automorphisms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScholz, Erhard\n\n2018-02-01\n\nDuring his whole scientific life Hermann Weyl was fascinated by the interrelation of physical and mathematical theories. From the mid 1920s onward he reflected also on the typical difference between the two epistemic fields and tried to identify it by comparing their respective automorphism structures. In a talk given at the end of the 1940s (ETH, Hs 91a:31) he gave the most detailed and coherent discussion of his thoughts on this topic. This paper presents his arguments in the talk and puts it in the context of the later development of gauge theories.\n\nVendian cyanobacterial communities as a preservation factor of fossil eucaryotic algal remains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeonov, M. V.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA new fossil complex of organic micro-organisms from Upper Vendian deposits of Mezen syneclise is described. This complex consists of cyanobacterial mat fragments represented by taxa Leiotrichoides tipicus Hermannn, 1974 and Palaeolyngbya aff. catenata Hermann, 1974. On the surface of this communities were found remains of cord-like thalli Eoholynia mosquensis Gnilovskaya, 1975. They may be referred to the eucaryotic algae with parenchimatous type of tallus structure. The phytoleims of megascopic probably eucaryotic algae were also found jointly with organic biofilms. Their type of preservation was determinated by this burial with the organic biofilms produced by cyanobacterial communities.\n\nHistorical Examples of Misrepresentation, Innovation, and Morality in Physical Science and Technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuchwald, Jed\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe pressures of publication, the desire to be first in innovation, and moral convictions have long been at work in the history of science and technology. Historians think and argue best through stories, so I've chosen three examples that exemplify one or more of these aspects. The first involves the discovery of electric waves by Heinrich Hertz in 1888; the second concerns the controlled production of electromagnetic radiation by Marconi and Fleming in the early 1900s; our final case involves a bitter controversy between the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz and the astronomer Friedrich ZÃ¶llner in the 1890s.\n\nTaxonomic status and morphological variation of Hydrodynastes bicinctusÂ (Hermann, 1804) (Serpentes: Dipsadidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nMurta-Fonseca, Roberta A; Franco, Francisco L; Fernandes, Daniel Silva\n\n2016-08-26\n\nHydrodynastes bicinctus was described with no type material or locality and it has two subspecies currently recognized that are not taxonomically well defined. We tested the validity of the two subspecies through meristic, morphometric, and color pattern characters. Two apparently distinct color patterns of H. bicinctus were noticed, one from the Cerrado open formations and the other from the Amazon rainforest. These aforementioned patterns, however, exhibited a high degree of geographic overlap and many specimens showed a blended pattern. Based on these results we propose synonymizing H. bicinctus schultzi with the nominal taxon. Furthermore, we designate a neotype for the species, present data on geographic distribution, and provide morphological descriptions of the hemipenis, cephalic glands, and skull.\n\nFrom \"Teamchef Arminius\" to \"Hermann Junior\": Glocalised Discourses about a National Foundation Myth\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMusolff, Andreas\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIf for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the \"Battle of the Teutoburg Forest\", fought in 9 CE between Roman armies and Germanic tribes, was predominantly a reference point for nationalist and chauvinist discourses in Germany, the first decade of the twenty-first century has seen attempts to link public remembrance withâ¦\n\nBlending the liberal arts and nursing: Creating a portrait for the 21st century.\n\nPubMed\n\nKooken, Wendy Carter; Kerr, NoÃ«l\n\nThe liberal arts and sciences serve as a core part of the educational discipline in nursing curriculum and are believed to undergird abilities for critical-thinking, creativity, and holistic care (Hermann, 2004; McKie, 2012). Over time, science has taken on a more central role in nursing education, despite the acknowledged importance and contributions of liberal arts. The humanities are an essential part of liberal arts education and generally include disciplines such as history, literature, religion, philosophy, architecture, or fine arts (e.g., music, painting, sculpture, drama, or film) (Hermann, 2004). Nursing students identify that liberal arts improve their skills to communicate, think globally, navigate diversity, make decisions, and improve their human selves (McKie, 2012), therefore the purposeful inclusion of liberal arts and humanities into nursing pedagogy should be assured. Schools of nursing seated within liberal arts universities are in a position to take advantage of campus environments that seek to improve student knowledge, skills, abilities, and values (Scott, 2014). When caring for patients with complex medical, psychosocial, spiritual, and economic concerns, the ability to differentiate between what is true among a myriad of competing issues, and to identify solutions to these problems, are critical skills (Scott, 2014). This manuscript describes one type of focused effort by school of nursing (SON) faculty to integrate the humanities on a small, liberal arts campus into the nursing curriculum. The desire to do this led to a large, interdisciplinary project intended to enhance campus, community, faculty, and student opportunities to understand and ponder the complexities involved in caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

This paper presents a case study of the Memorial Hermann ACO (MHACO), launched in response to the Medicare Shared Savings Program, with goals to align physician and hospital incentives, practice evidence-based medicine, develop care coordination, and increase efficiency. Building blocks included an affiliated primary care network, a clinical integration program (involving shared electronic medical record platforms and quality data reporting), and significant investments in information technology. Presented is the approach taken to form MHACO; the management structure, technology developed, and a 2-year experience. Incorporated in July 2012, the MHACO involved 22 000 Medicare patients. In 2015, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released data showing a composite quality score between 80 and 85 (from a maximum 100) and nearly $53 million in total savings (or 11% of expected expenditure), making MHACO one of the most successful nationally.1 In fewer than 5 years, almost 500 ACOs have developed, and by some estimates, a quarter of Medicare patients are currently enrolled in an ACO. Although ACOs to date have focused on primary care, the future will increasingly involve specialists. At Memorial Hermann, neurosurgeons took an early role in forming collaborative partnerships with the hospital, and started programs that served as precursors to the ACO model. This paper ends with an overview of ACO development, likely changes going forward, and a discussion of the role of specialists in general, and of neurosurgeons in particular.

Expressions for cross sections in jl coupling are given. Comparison with the Ar two-photon cross section of Pindzola and Kelly, calculated using the many-body theory, the dipole-length approximation, and LS coupling shows a disagreement of as much as a factor of 2. The disagreement appears to arise from distortion introduced by shifting the Green's-function resonances to experimentalmoreÂ Â» values.Â«Â less\n\n[Transportation networks and means in the development of scientific expeditions in Argentina (1850-1910)].\n\nPubMed\n\nFarro, MÃ¡ximo E\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe article explores the relation between the advance of transportation technology and the development of scientific expeditions between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Argentina. Expansion of the railway network on a national scale impacted the development of the earth sciences by facilitating access to distant places by scientific institutions located in CÃ³rdoba, Buenos Aires, and La Plata and also by simplifying the movement of equipment, scientific collections, and personnel. Hermann Burmeister's expedition (1857-60), expeditions by scientists from the Academia Nacional de Ciencias de CÃ³rdoba, and archeological digs in the northwestern provinces, organized by scientific institutions headquartered in Buenos Aires and La Plata, serve as examples.\n\nTrigeminal Neuralgia and Multiple Sclerosis: A Historical Perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurkholder, David B; Koehler, Peter J; Boes, Christopher J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) was first described in Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten fÃ¼r Ãrzte und Studirende in 1894 by Hermann Oppenheim, including a pathologic description of trigeminal root entry zone demyelination. Early English-language translations in 1900 and 1904 did not so explicitly state this association compared with the German editions. The 1911 English-language translation described a more direct association. Other later descriptions were clinical with few pathologic reports, often referencing Oppenheim but citing the 1905 German or 1911 English editions of Lehrbuch. This discrepancy in part may be due to the translation differences of the original text.\n\nResonant Mode Interaction in Rayleigh-Benard Convection: Hexagon Case\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoroz, Vadim\n\n2002-11-01\n\nResonant interaction of the \"main\" convection mode (q) with the first harmonic (q=sqrt(3)*q) is studied in the regime where both modes are (close to being) linearly unstable. The bifurcations and the resulting family of solutions are classified using symmetry group analysis; dependence of coefficients in amplitude equations on the fluid properties is analyzed. Main focus is made on the bifurcation from hex pattern with wavevector q*sqrt(3) to hex pattern q. Particular experimental conditions under which the bifurcation could be observed (as well as existence of other instabilities which could preempt it) are stated.

K. F. Zoellner began writing on \"experimental proofs\" of a fourth spatial dimension, and of the existence of spirits, in 1878. His arguments caused strong controversy, with rebuttal essays by Wilhelm Wundt and others. The author argues that Zoellner's case that these matters are experimental questions rested on arguments which Hermann von Helmholtz, inveighing against rationalist views of space and space perception, had recently published. Zoellner's use of Helmholtz's arguments to advance and defend his spiritist views occasioned strong criticism of Helmholtz, affected careers and reputations of scholars in Berlin and Leipzig, and caused enduring controversy over the credibility of Helmholtz's empiricist theory of space perception.\n\nNumber and measure: Hermann von Helmholtz at the crossroads of mathematics, physics, and psychology.\n\nPubMed\n\nDarrigol, Olivier\n\n2003-09-01\n\nIn 1887 Helmholtz discussed the foundations of measurement in science as a last contribution to his philosophy of knowledge. This essay borrowed from earlier debates on the foundations of mathematics (Grassmann/Du Bois), on the possibility of quantitative psychology (Fechner/Kries, Wundt/Zeller), and on the meaning of temperature measurement (Maxwell,Mach.). Late nineteenth-century scrutinisers of the foundations of mathematics (Dedekind, Cantor, Frege, Russell) made little of Helmholtz's essay. Yet it inspired two mathematicians with an eye on physics (PoincarÃ© and HÃ¶lder), and a few philosopher-physicists (Mach, Duhem,Campbell). The aim of the present paper is to situate Helmholtz's contribution in this complex array of nineteenth-century philosophies of number, quantity, and measurement. 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nVon Neumann's impossibility proof: Mathematics in the service of rhetorics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDieks, Dennis\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAccording to what has become a standard history of quantum mechanics, in 1932 von Neumann persuaded the physics community that hidden variables are impossible as a matter of principle, after which leading proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation put the situation to good use by arguing that the completeness of quantum mechanics was undeniable. This state of affairs lasted, so the story continues, until Bell in 1966 exposed von Neumann's proof as obviously wrong. The realization that von Neumann's proof was fallacious then rehabilitated hidden variables and made serious foundational research possible again. It is often added in recent accounts that von Neumann's error had been spotted almost immediately by Grete Hermann, but that her discovery was of no effect due to the dominant Copenhagen Zeitgeist. We shall attempt to tell a story that is more historically accurate and less ideologically charged. Most importantly, von Neumann never claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden variables tout court, but argued that hidden-variable theories must possess a structure that deviates fundamentally from that of quantum mechanics. Both Hermann and Bell appear to have missed this point; moreover, both raised unjustified technical objections to the proof. Von Neumann's argument was basically that hidden-variables schemes must violate the ;quantum principle; that physical quantities are to be represented by operators in a Hilbert space. As a consequence, hidden-variables schemes, though possible in principle, necessarily exhibit a certain kind of contextuality. As we shall illustrate, early reactions to Bohm's theory are in agreement with this account. Leading physicists pointed out that Bohm's theory has the strange feature that pre-existing particle properties do not generally reveal themselves in measurements, in accordance with von Neumann's result. They did not conclude that the ;impossible was done; and that von Neumann had been shown wrong.\n\nUsing the Two-Burn Escape Maneuver for Fast Transfers in the Solar System and Beyond\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdams, Robert B.; Richardson, Georgia A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe two-burn maneuver to escape the gravitational pull of a central body is described. The maneuver, originally suggested by Hermann Oberth, improves efficiency considerably for a wide range of missions of interest in space exploration and scientific investigation. A clear delineation of when the maneuver is more effective is given, as are methods to extract the most advantage when using the maneuver. Some examples are given of how this maneuver can enable exploration of the outer solar system, near interstellar space, and crewed missions to Mars and beyond. The maneuver has the potential to halve the required infrastructure associated with a crewed mission to Mars and achieve increased solar escape velocities with existing spacecraft technologies.\n\n[Between the European past and the American future: two papers about Brazil in the 1930s].\n\nPubMed\n\nLisboa, Karen Macknow\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe article examines the idea of Europe conceived by Stefan Zweig and Hermann Ullmann in the similarly titled books about Brazil written in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the political context between the great wars marked by the rise of Nazism, the question is posed regarding to what extent Europe continues to serve as a model of civilization and what the critical dimension is that is expressed in concepts reversing the roles of Europe and Brazil. One detects a partial rupture with dichotomous and hierarchical viewpoints about the relationship between the Old World and the New World, and new forms of relationship between these regions within the worldwide context are suggested.\n\nObservability, Visualizability and the Question of Metaphysical Neutrality\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolff, Johanna\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTheories in fundamental physics are unlikely to be ontologically neutral, yet they may nonetheless fail to offer decisive empirical support for or against particular metaphysical positions. I illustrate this point by close examination of a particular objection raised by Wolfgang Pauli against Hermann Weyl. The exchange reveals that both parties to the dispute appeal to broader epistemological principles to defend their preferred metaphysical starting points. I suggest that this should make us hesitant to assume that in deriving metaphysical conclusions from physical theories we place our metaphysical theories on a purely empirical foundation. The metaphysics within a particular physical theory may well be the result of a priori assumptions in the background, not particular empirical findings.\n\nBook Review:\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErnst, Frederick J.\n\n2007-06-01\n\nShortly after Einstein published his general theory of relativity, the spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum field equations was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild, while Hermann Weyl showed that from any axisymmetric solution Ï of the Laplace equation âÂ²Ï = 0 (satisfying appropriate boundary conditions) the metric tensor of a static axisymmetric vacuum spacetime can be constructed. In particular, the Schwarzschild solution corresponds to a rather trivial solution of Laplace's equation expressed in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates.

After a short survey of falconry in the past, this article will discuss the original treatises and the history of their analysis since the 19th century. In this context it will deal with the research of the following scholars: Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, Anton von Perger, Ernst von Dombrowski, Hermann Werth, Christoph von Biedermann and--most importantly--Kurt Lindner. The appendix contains the editio princeps of the German MÃ¼nchener Rezeptar I from the codex unicus, MÃ¼nchen, UniversitÃ¤tsbibliothek, 80 Cod. ms. 354, fol. 31r-33r (dating from the 15th century).\n\n\"Cosmomorphistic geometry\" in the unconscious geometry of Johannes Kepler\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdam, Adolf\n\nSome mathematical aspects of the Music theory by Johannes Kepler are discussed, paying a special attention to the book \"De harmonice mundi\". Other scientists interested in Music theory are mentioned throughout the paper: The Pythagorean school, Klaudios Ptolemaios, Leonard Euler, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian von Goldbach, Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholz, Karl Friedrich Gauss. The relation with the ancient chinese schools of cosmography has been discussed: From the the Pythagorean to the ancient Chinese schools of cosmography we find arithmo-geometrical applications of numbers which are emblematic, hold meaning or represent the essence of things, the author writes. It was Johannes Kepler who taught us this \"transconstructive method\" of forming classical and ancient begginings of structuralistic thinking into a system from which deductions can readily be made.\n\nWhich symmetry? Noether, Weyl, and conservation of electric charge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrading, Katherine A.\n\nIn 1918, Emmy Noether published a (now famous) theorem establishing a general connection between continuous 'global' symmetries and conserved quantities. In fact, Noether's paper contains two theorems, and the second of these deals with 'local' symmetries; prima facie, this second theorem has nothing to do with conserved quantities. In the same year, Hermann Weyl independently made the first attempt to derive conservation of electric charge from a postulated gauge symmetry. In the light of Noether's work, it is puzzling that Weyl's argument uses local gauge symmetry. This paper explores the relationships between Weyl's work, Noether's two theorems, and the modern connection between gauge symmetry and conservation of electric charge. This includes showing that Weyl's connection is essentially an application of Noether's second theorem, with a novel twist.\n\nGeometrical optical illusionists.\n\nPubMed\n\nWade, Nicholas J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGeometrical optical illusions were given this title by Oppel in 1855. Variants on such small distortions of visual space were illustrated thereafter, many of which bear the names of those who first described them. Some original forms of the geometrical optical illusions are shown together with 'perceptual portraits' of those who described them. These include: Roget, Chevreul, Fick, ZÃ¶llner, Poggendorff, Hering, Kundt, Delboeuf Mach, Helmholtz, Hermann, von Bezold, MÃ¼ller-Lyer, Lipps, ThiÃ©ry, Wundt, MÃ¼nsterberg, Ebbinghaus, Titchener, Ponzo, Luckiesh, Sander, Ehrenstein, Gregory, Heard, White, Shepard, and. Lingelbach. The illusions are grouped under the headings of orientation, size, the combination of size and orientation, and contrast. Early theories of illusions, before geometrical optical illusions were so named, are mentioned briefly.\n\nKant and the development of the human and cultural sciences.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakkreel, Rudolf A\n\n2008-12-01\n\nStarting with Kant's doubts about psychology as a natural science capable of explaining human behavior, several alternative attempts to conceive of human life, culture and history are examined. Kant proposes an anthropology that will be a commonly useful human science rather than a universally valid natural science. This anthropology relates to philosophy as a mode of world-cognition. Special attention is given to how Kant's theory of right can help define our appropriate place in a communal world. The different ways in which Wilhelm Dilthey and Hermann Cohen respond to Kant's idea of legitimate appropriation are also considered. The various tasks that descriptive elucidation, explanation, reflective understanding, characterization and interpretation can perform for the human and cultural sciences are examined throughout the essay.\n\nHermann von Helmholtz's empirico-transcendentalism reconsidered: construction and constitution in Helmholtz's psychology of the object.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Kock, Liesbet\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis paper aims at contributing to the ongoing efforts to get a firmer grasp of the systematic significance of the entanglement of idealism and empiricism in Helmholtz's work. Contrary to existing analyses, however, the focal point of the present exposition is Helmholtz's attempt to articulate a psychological account of objectification. Helmholtz's motive, as well as his solution to the problem of the object are outlined, and interpreted against the background of his scientific practice on the one hand, and that of empiricist and (transcendental) idealist analyses of experience on the other. The specifically psychological angle taken, not only prompts us to consider figures who have hitherto been treated as having only minor import for Helmholtz interpretation (most importantly J.S. Mill and J.G. Fichte), it furthermore sheds new light on some central tenets of the latter's psychological stance that have hitherto remained underappreciated. For one thing, this analysis reveals an explicit voluntarist tendency in Helmholtz's psychological theory. In conclusion, it is argued that the systematic significance of Helmholtz's empirico-transcendentalism with respect to questions of the mind is best understood as an attempt to found his empirical theory of perception in a second order, normative account of epistemic subjectivity.\n\nLinear systems with structure group and their feedback invariants\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMartin, C.; Hermann, R.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA general method described by Hermann and Martin (1976) for the study of the feedback invariants of linear systems is considered. It is shown that this method, which makes use of ideas of topology and algebraic geometry, is very useful in the investigation of feedback problems for which the classical methods are not suitable. The transfer function as a curve in the Grassmanian is examined. The general concepts studied in the context of specific systems and applications are organized in terms of the theory of Lie groups and algebraic geometry. Attention is given to linear systems which have a structure group, linear mechanical systems, and feedback invariants. The investigation shows that Lie group techniques are powerful and useful tools for analysis of the feedback structure of linear systems.\n\nHelmholtz and the psychophysiology of time.\n\nPubMed\n\nDebru, C\n\n2001-09-01\n\nAfter having measured the velocity of the nervous impulse in the 1850s, Helmholtz began doing research on the temporal dimensions of visual perception. Experiments dealing with the velocity of propagation in nerves (as well as with aspects of perception) were carried out occasionally for some fifteen years until their final publication in 1871. Although the temporal dimension of perception seems to have interested Helmholtz less than problems of geometry and space, his experiments on the time of perception were technically rather subtle and seminal, especially compared with experiments performed by his contemporaries, such as Sigmund Exner, William James, Rudolf Hermann Lotze, Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Volkmann, and Wilhelm Wundt. Helmholtz's conception of the temporal aspects of perception reflects the continuity that holds between psychophysiological research and the Kantian philosophical background.\n\nLandslides Cause Tsunami Waves: Insights From AysÃ©n Fjord, Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLastras, Galderic; Amblas, David; Calafat, Antoni M.; Canals, Miquel; Frigola, Jaime; Hermanns, Reginald L.; Lafuerza, Sara; Longva, Oddvar; Micallef, Aaron; SepÃºlveda, Sergio A.; Vargas, Gabriel; Batist, Marc De; Daele, Maarten Van; Azpiroz, MarÃ­a.; BascuÃ±Ã¡n, Ignacio; Duhart, Paul; Iglesias, Olaia; Kempf, Philipp; Rayo, Xavier\n\n2013-08-01\n\nOn 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the AysÃ©n fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5Â°S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement wavesâtsunami-like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water bodyâwithin the fjord [Naranjo et al., 2009; SepÃºlveda and Serey, 2009; Hermanns et al., 2013]. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences.\n\nDetermination of contact angle from the maximum height of enlarged drops on solid surfaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBehroozi, F.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nMeasurement of the liquid/solid contact angle provides useful information on the wetting properties of fluids. In 1870, the German physicist Georg Hermann Quincke (1834-1924) published the functional relation between the maximum height of an enlarged drop and its contact angle. Quincke's relation offered an alternative to the direct measurement of contact angle, which in practice suffers from several experimental uncertainties. In this paper, we review Quincke's original derivation and show that it is based on a hidden assumption. We then present a new derivation that exposes this assumption and clarifies the conditions under which Quincke's relation is valid. To explore Quincke's relation experimentally, we measure the maximum height of enlarged water drops on several substrates and calculate the contact angle in each case. Our results are in good agreement with contact angles measured directly from droplet images.\n\nThe Mistaken Birth and Adoption of LNT: An Abridged Version\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCalabrese, Edward J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe historical foundations of cancer risk assessment were based on the discovery of X-ray-induced gene mutations by Hermann J. Muller, its transformation into the linear nonthreshold (LNT) single-hit theory, the recommendation of the model by the US National Academy of Sciences, Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation I, Genetics Panel in 1956, and subsequent widespread adoption by regulatory agencies worldwide. This article summarizes substantial recent historical revelations of this history, which profoundly challenge the standard and widely acceptable history of cancer risk assessment, showing multiple significant scientific errors and incorrect interpretations, mixed with deliberate misrepresentation of the scientific record by leading ideologically motivated radiation geneticists. These novel historical findings demonstrate that the scientific foundations of the LNT single-hit model were seriously flawed and should not have been adopted for cancer risk assessment.

Einstein & Cie. (co-owned by Albert Einstein's father Hermann) had to be closed in the summer of 1894. While Albert's parents emigrated to Italy to build a new existence, he remained in Munich to complete his studies at the Gymnasium. Left behind, however, he had a difficult time with what he considered the rigid educational practices at the Munich Luitpold-Gymnasium and quit without a diploma. The present article discusses Einstein's richly winding path to the Aargau Cantonal School (Switzerland), especially its history and educational philosophy during the time of his stay in Aarau. There, Einstein met some outstanding teachers, who could serve him as models of scholars and human beings. In spite of Einstein's distinct independence of mind, these personalities may well have had a significant influence on the alignment of his inner compass.\n\nSediment and Hydraulic Measurements with Computed Bed Load on the Missouri River, Sioux City to Hermann, 2014\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-05-01\n\nall sites were surveyed three times, separated by at least 4 weeks (or 20% flow difference) between surveys .

Recent findings from the observation of distant supernovae revealed that the rate of expansion of our universe is accelerating, which may be well explained by sticking a positive cosmological constant into the Einstein field equations for general relativity. By solving the Newman-Penrose equations (which are equivalent to the Einstein field equations), we generalize this notion of Bondi mass-energy and thereby provide a firm theoretical description of how an isolated gravitating system loses energy as it radiates gravitational waves, in a universe that expands at an accelerated rate. This is in line with the observational front of LIGOâs first announcement in February 2016 that gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black hole system have been detected.\n\nComment on atomic independent-particle models\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDoda, D.D.; Gravey, R.H.; Green, A.E.S.\n\n1975-08-01\n\nThe Hartree-Fock-Slater (HFS) independent-particle model in the form developed by Hermann and Skillman (HS) and the Green, Sellin, and Zachor (GSZ) analytic independent-particle model are being used for many types of applications of atomic theory to avoid cumbersome, albeit more rigorous, many-body calculations. The single-electron eigenvalues obtained with these models are examined and it is found that the GSZ model is capable of yielding energy eigenvalues for valence electrons which are substantially closer to experimental values than are the results of HS-HFS calculations. With the aid of an analytic representation of the equivalent HS-HFS screening function, the difficulty with thismoreÂ Â» model is identified as a weakness of the potential in the neighborhood of the valence shell. Accurate representations of valence states are important in most atomic applications of the independent-particle model.

In Einstein's view, a realistic microscopic model of rods and clocks was needed to account for the very existence of measuring devices of identical construction that always measure the same unit of time and the same unit of length. It will be shown that the empirical meaningfulness of both relativity theories depends on what, following Max Born, one might call the 'principle of the physical identity of the units of measure'. In an attempt to justify the validity of such a principle, Einstein was forced by different interlocutors, in particular Hermann Weyl and Wolfgang Pauli, to deal with the genuine epistemological, rather than the physical question of whether a theory should be required to describe the material devices needed for its own verification.\n\nFirst Flight of a Liquid Propellant Rocket\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2010-01-04\n\nDr. Robert H.

A biographical sketch].\n\nPubMed\n\nMay, Ulrike\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOn the basis of mostly unpublished sources, the author reconstructs the life of the Hungarian writer Viktor von Dirsztay (1884?-1935) who was personally acquainted with many expressionist artists and writers, e. g. with Karl Kraus, Oskar Kokoschka, Herwarth Walden, Walter Hasenclever, Hermann Broch and Arthur Schnitzler. This association puts Freud into closer proximity with the cultural avantgarde of his times than previously realized. Between 1910 and 1920 Dirsztay underwent several phases of analysis with Freud; then he was treated by Theodor Reik. The overall length of his analysis with Freud is almost unparalleled. The article discusses whether and in which way Dirsztay's writings might have been influenced by his analyses and how Freud and Reik might have drawn upon their experiences with this patient. It is argued that likely references can be discovered in both authors' theories of masochism. There is an intriguing late remark of Dirsztay's that he was \"ruined by analysis\".\n\nWalter Hohmann's contributions towards space flight: an appreciation on the occasion of the centenary of his birthday\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchulz, Werner\n\n1980-11-01\n\nIn 1923 Hermann Oberth published his book \"Die Rakete zu den PlanetenrÃ¤umen\" (The Rocket into Planetary Space), in 1924 Max Valier's book \"Der Vorstoss in den Weltenraum\" (The Advance into Space) appeared while in the U.S.A. already in 1919 Robert H. Goddard reported on his rocket experiments. Altogether different from the publications just mentioned was a book entitled \"Die Erreichbarkeit der HimmelskÃ¶rper\" (The Attainability of Celestial Bodies) published in 1925. Its author was Dr.-Ing. Walter Hohmann, born 18 March 1880, civil engineer for the city authorities of Essen, who had already made, during World War I, calculations as to the amount of fuel, initial mass and flight time necessary for flights from the Earth to other planets. The transfer trajectories investigated by Hohmann and today attributed with his name have a great practical significance for space flight onto the present. In the lecture a critical appreciation of Hohmann's work is given.\n\nImportance of Eugenio Beltrami's hydroelectrodynamics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFilipponi, G.\n\n1985-07-01\n\nAs part of a continuing project of bringing the works of Bernhard Riemann and his collaborators directly before the scientific community, we are happy to present translations of two papers by Eugenio Beltrami that were key in the development of hydrodynamics. We have also translated a short portion of Beltrami's attack upon the electrodynamics of James Clerk Maxwell. The first paper develops the work of Hermann Helmholtz (translated in IJFE (Helmholtz 1978)) into a generative treatment of vortices. As the note by Dan Wells in this issue illustrates in connection with his own work, Beltrami's method has proven critical tomoreÂ Â» the treatment of the development of vortices in plasmas, providing a crucial tool for studying what was otherwise dismissed as turbulence. In his introduction to the translations, Dr. Giuseppe Filipponi develops the connection between the discoveries of Beltrami and the Italian tradition of research in hydrodynamics begun by Leonardo da Vinci.Â«Â less\n\nEmpirical correlation between hydrophobic free energy and aqueous cavity surface area\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nReynolds, J.A.; Gilbert, D.B.; Tanford, C.\n\n1974-08-01\n\nThe unitary free energy of transfer of a hydrocarbon molecule from a hydrocarbon solvent to an aqueous medium is a measure of the hydrophobic interaction in the aqueous medium. We have reexamined available data on this phenomenon and have confirmed that the free energy for saturated hydrocarbons is proportional to the surface area of the cavity created by the solute in the aqueous solution, with the same proportionality constant for linear, branched, and cyclic hydrocarbon molecules. The numerical value of the proportionality constant is uncertain because absolute and self-consistent area measurements are not available. We estimate that it falls betweenmoreÂ Â» 20 and 25 cal/mole per Angstrom/sup 2/ at 25/sup 0/ (for areas measured at the distance of closest approach of water molecules), which is significantly less than the figure of 33 cal/mole per Angstrom/sup 2/ that has been assigned to the same parameter by Hermann.Â«Â less\n\nEMTP; A powerful tool for analyzing power system transients\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLong, W.; Cotcher, D.; Ruiu, D.\n\n1990-07-01\n\nThis paper reports on the electromagnetic transients program (EMTP), a general purpose computer program for simulating high-speed transient effects in electric power systems. The program features an extremely wide variety of modeling capabilities encompassing electromagnetic and electromechanical oscillations ranging in duration from microseconds to seconds. Examples of its use include switching and lightning surge analysis, insulation coordination, shaft torsional oscillations, ferroresonance, and HVDC converter control and operation. In the late 1960s Hermann Dommel developed the EMTP at Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which considered the program to be the digital computer replacement for the transient network analyzer. The program initially comprisedmoreÂ Â» about 5000 lines of code, and was useful primarily for transmission line switching studies. As more uses for the program became apparent, BPA coordinated many improvements to the program. As the program grew in versatility and in size, it likewise became more unwieldy and difficult to use. One had to be an EMTP aficionado to take advantage of its capabilities.Â«Â less\n\nAttention in western Nevada: Preliminary results from earthquake and explosion sources\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHough, S.E.; Anderson, J.G.; Patton, H.J.\n\n1989-02-01\n\nWe present preliminary results from a study of the attenuation of regional seismic waves at frequencies between 1 and 15 Hz and distances up to 250 km in Western Nevada. Following the methods of Anderson and Hough (1984) and Hough et al. (1988), we parameterize the asymptote of the high frequency acceleration spectrum by the two-parameter model. We relate the model parameters to a two-layer model for Q/sub i/ and Q/sub d/, the freuqency-independent and the frequency dependent components of the quality factor. We compare our results to previously published Q studies in the Basin and Range and find thatmoreÂ Â» our estimate of total Q, Q/sub t/, in the shallow crust is consistent with shear wave Q at close distances with previous estimates of coda Q (Singh and Hermann, 1983) and LgQ (Chavez and Priestley, 1986), suggesting that both coda Q and LgQ are insensitive to near-surface contributions to attenuation.Â«Â less\n\nWas Muller's 1946 Nobel Prize research for radiation-induced gene mutations peer-reviewed?\n\nPubMed\n\nCalabrese, Edward J\n\n2018-06-06\n\nThis historical analysis indicates that it is highly unlikely that the Nobel Prize winning research of Hermann J. Muller was peer-reviewed. The published paper of Muller lacked a research methods section, cited no references, and failed to acknowledge and discuss the work of Gager and Blakeslee (PNAS 13:75-79, 1927) that claimed to have induced gene mutation via ionizing radiation six months prior to Muller's non-data Science paper (Muller, Science 66(1699):84-87, 1927a). Despite being well acclimated into the scientific world of peer-review, Muller choose to avoid the peer-review process on his most significant publication. It appears that Muller's actions were strongly influenced by his desire to claim primacy for the discovery of gene mutation. The actions of Muller have important ethical lessons and implications today, when self-interest trumps one's obligations to society and the scientific culture that supports the quest for new knowledge and discovery.\n\n[A pharmaceutical of the century will be 100.
