My research supports the opposite interpretation. The initiator of the controversy, Emil du Bois-Reymond, was a physiologist who worked his whole life against the forces of obscurantism, whether they came from the Catholic and Conservative Right or from the scientistic and millenarian Left. Du Bois-Reymondâ€™s agnosticism toward the ultimate nature of mind and matter must therefore be seen as an endorsement, and not a rejection, of his faith in reason.\n\nSept. 11 (Thurs.) - Welcome Back Pizza Party.
