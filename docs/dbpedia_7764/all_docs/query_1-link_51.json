The journey on the motorway between Albenga and Finale Ligure took two hours yesterday 30 June, in the late afternoon, with an interminable queue in many sections [...]\n\nRead more\n\nItalian fishermen at the mercy of Libya's abuse\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – Gaddafi in defiance of all international norms extended the territorial waters from 12 to 74 miles from the coast. What continues to happen to persecuted Italian fishermen in Libya should arouse a tremor of indignation. The Libyan dictator Gaddafi in contempt of every international norm extended [...]\n\nRead more\n\nNapoleon was great, but liberalism is something else\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – I disagree with Alessandro Barbero, Napoleon had nothing to do with the triumph of liberalism in Europe. We are now used to reading the strangest and most contradictory opinions on liberalism and only those who are not familiar with liberal culture can be surprised by this. In fact, not […]\n\nRead more\n\nMichela Murgia's undeserved attack on Gen. Son\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – The Murgia takes it out on the men in uniform who are engaged in a job on which everyone's life depends.

She received that prize which, in my opinion, began to decline with […]\n\nRead more\n\nThe vulgar Mattioli (La Stampa) on Giorgia Meloni\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – The vulgar joke of the well-known music critic against Giorgia Meloni, mare and against her daughter Ginevra. The vulgar joke against Giorgia Meloni seen as a mare and against her daughter Ginevra written in “La Stampa” by Alberto Mattioli, a journalist who loves opera, but certainly not […]\n\nRead more\n\nThe flawed liberalism of Giuseppe Bedeschi's book\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – The book would be interesting if it weren't incomplete, nothing new, it repeats well-known things, but clearly. Giuseppe Bedeschi delights in drawing up lists of liberal personalities with very personal criteria and once again in the book “The masters of liberalism in republican Italy”, published […]\n\nRead more\n\nThe objective today is only one: to prevent the boat from sinking\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – Mattarella's speech is destined to go down in history because it laid the foundations for saving the nation. The speech by the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella last night is destined to go down in history because he laid the foundations to save the nation. […]\n\nRead more\n\nCostanzo Preve, complex and refined intellectual\n\nby PIER FRANCO QUAGLIENI – It is never a positive thing that historical issues are brought to court rather than remaining in the books. The teacher Donatella Di Cesare, collaborator of the \"Espresso\", of the \"Manifesto\" and of the \"Lettura\", was acquitted of the accusation of having defamed the philosopher Costanzo Preve because she had […]\n\nRead more"
