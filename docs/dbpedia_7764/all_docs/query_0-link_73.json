For her second, she wanted to create a programme with a cohesive narrative arc - a journey, but one that the listener can take in their own time and their own way. For it, she has assembled a group of musicians who both share in her concept but also bring to the project their own varied musical personalities to complement Héloïse's own distinctive voice. Rightly described by Héloïse as 'amazing people', her collaborators - Colin Alexander, Julian Azkoul, Max Baillie, Kit Downes, Ruth Gibson and Marianne Schofield - stitch their individual contributions into close-ups in colours just as vibrant as Héloïse's own.\n\n31 MAY 2024\n\nPaul Lewis plays Schubert - Piano Sonatas, Wanderer Fantasie, Moments Musicaux, Impromptus, Drei Klavierstucke\n\nHarmonia Mundi HMX2904091.96 (6 CDs)\n\nRelease: 31 May 2024\n\nPoet and virtuoso, Paul Lewis is one of the leading Schubertians of his generation. This boxed set assembling the Viennese composer's major mature works for solo piano - the late sonatas, Impromptus, Wanderer-Fantasie, Moments musicaux, etc - is set to become one of the milestones of the modern discography.\n\nVienna: Joyful Apocalypse\n\nAurélien Pontier\n\nWarner Classics 5054197633546\n\nRelease: 31 May 2024\n\nThe French pianist Aurélien Pontier conceived Vienna: Joyful Apocalypse as 'a tribute to Vienna at the turn of the 20th century'. The album opens with waltzes from Johann Strauss II's operetta Die Fledermaus, virtuoso versions of the composer's Pizzicato Polka and the most famous Viennese waltz of all, The Blue Danube. More waltzes feature from Viennese native Franz Schubert and the great violinist Fritz Kreisler, as well as composers born further afield - Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Godowsky. The album concludes with the 'Adagietto' from Mahler's Symphony No 5 (arranged by Pontier himself), Schoenberg's Klavierstücke and Ravel's La Valse.\n\n24 MAY 2024\n\nBrahms & Contemporaries, Vol 1\n\nKaleidoscope Chamber Collective\n\nChandos CHAN 20297\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nThe Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective's new series juxtaposes piano quartets by Brahms with ones by his lesser-known contemporaries. Here the group couples Brahms's epic A major Quartet with the Piano Quartet of Luise Adolpha Le Beau, a student of Clara Schumann, Lachner, and Rheinberger. Her extensive output covers all genres: the Piano Quartet was composed around 1884 and performed in the Leipzig Gewandhaus that year to great critical acclaim.\n\nSamuel Wesley: Sacred Choral Music\n\nChoir of Holy Sepulchre: The National Musician's Church / Toby Ward\n\nDelphian DCD34268\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley (1810-1876) was one of the foremost composers and organists of his time. Taking advantage of new developments in instrument building, Wesley was able to push the boundaries of English church music in a new direction, encompassing a more operatic style at a time when church membership was flourishing in Victorian England. In this recording - the first to have been made using an organ similar in design to his own - Wesley's music is brought to life by the young professional singers of The Holy Sepulchre under conductor Toby Ward.\n\nMy Peace I Give You\n\nPoor Clare Sisters Arundel\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nThe highest-charting nuns ever, the Poor Clares of Arundel are answering the prayers of eagerly waiting fans, by announcing their return with a second album My Peace I Give You. They captured the hearts of millions of listeners in 2020 with their uplifting debut album 'Light for the World', which soared to No 5 in the UK Official Album Chart, infusing Latin hymns and medieval texts with a unique 21st Century production. The sisters are now gearing up to bring music from the thirteenth century back to the mainstream pop chart once again.\n\nHow are the Mighty Fallen: Choral Music by Giovanni Bononcini\n\nChoir of the Queen's College, Oxford / Owen Rees, Academy of Ancient Music, Rowan Pierce, Esther Lay, Helen Charlston, Guy Cutting, Giles Underwood\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD905\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nSeveral high-profile artists and two ensembles team up to record music by the Italian baroque composer, Giovanni Bononcini. This album contains the first recordings of Ave maris stella, Laudate pueri and the original version of Te Deum. The eighteenth century sources of these works were specially edited for the recordings. Owen Rees directs the Choir of the Queen's College, Oxford. He appears on this album alongside celebrated soprano Rowan Pierce and mezzo Helen Charlston, together with other star soloists and the Academy of Ancient Music.\n\nSimeon ten Holt: Canto Ostinato for Solo Harp\n\nGwyneth Wentink\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD907\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nHaving first heard it in 2011 on the piano, Gwyneth Wentink presents a new solo harp arrangement of Simeon ten Holt's Canto Ostinato, arranged by Jeroen van Veen. Gwyneth Wentink is an internationally acclaimed Dutch harpist, straddling many genres and roles. She established Foundation Harp, a performance platform, in 1999.\n\nBeauty for Ashes\n\nThe Elysian Singers of London\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD797 (digital only)\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nRenaissance\n\nMatteo Myderwyk\n\nWarner Classics 505419791214 (digital only)\n\nRelease: 24 May 2024\n\nRenaissance is a re-imagining of Matteo Myderwyk's most intimate piano compositions. Many of Myderwyk's compositions have been recorded on an upright, occasionally with a synthesizer as accompaniment; this new album presents six of those compositions on a concert grand piano for the first time, alongside three new original tracks.\n\n17 MAY 2024\n\nShostakovich: Symphony No 13 'Babiy Yar'; Arvo Pärt: De profundis\n\nAlbert Dohmen, bass-baritone; Estonian National Male Choir; BBC Philharmonic / John Storgårds\n\nChandos CHSA 5335 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nJohn Storgårds' acclaimed series of Shostakovich symphonies continues with this recording of Symphony No 13 Babiy Yar. The BBC Philharmonic is joined by the bass-baritone Albert Dohmen and the Estonian National Male Choir, who also feature in the orchestral version of Arvo Pärt's De profundis.\n\nGranados; Albeniz\n\nPeter Donohoe, piano\n\nChandos CHAN 20293\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nThe British virtuoso Peter Donohoe performs two great monuments of Spanish piano music: Book I of Granados's Goyescas and Books I and II of Albéniz's Iberia. His extraordinary facility and innate musicianship produce dazzling and breathtaking readings of these twin peaks of the repertoire.\n\nGabriel Fauré: La Bonne Chanson - L'Horizon chimérique - Ballade - Mélodies\n\nStéphane Degout, baritone; Alain Planès, piano (Pleyel 'Grand Patron', 1892)\n\nHarmonia Mundi HMM902382\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nThe genre of the mélodie accompanied Fauré like a kind of personal journal. This music voluptuously - and sometimes vehemently - encompasses the meanderings of the soul: dreams, nostalgia, reflections or mirages ... Stéphane Degout and Alain Planès take advantage of the iridescent tones of an 1892 Pleyel in their interpretation of some of his finest song cycles, including the testamentary L'Horizon chimérique.\n\nSeasons Interrupted: Schubert, Piazzolla, Lintinen\n\nTrey Lee, English Chamber Orchestra\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD791\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nInternationally celebrated cellist, Trey Lee, presents an album exploring the impacts of climate change on the environment and society, recorded with the English Chamber Orchestra. It includes two world premiere recordings of Schubert and Piazzolla arrangements by Trey himself, alongside a contemporary cello concerto by Kirmo Lintinen. Trey Lee was born in Hong Kong but is now based in Berlin. He appears as soloist with prestigious orchestras across the globe, and is a member of the Canadian piano quintet Ensemble Made in Canada.\n\nSophia Jani: Six Pieces for Solo Violin\n\nTeresa Allgaier, violin\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nThis is an enchanting piece of work with elements of minimalism, but characterised by its calmness. The entire album is very poised and each piece focuses on a particular technical aspect of the violin. Both Sophia and Teresa wanted to figure out exactly what two women in the 21st century could offer to the history of the violin. It definitely feels like both artists are emerging as distinct voices in the contemporary classical world.\n\nBruckner: Symphony No 5\n\nRotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra / Lahav Shani\n\nWarner Classics 5054197792014\n\nRelease: 17 May 2024\n\nFollowing on from Lahav Shani's critically acclaimed recording of Bruckner's Symphony No 7 with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra in 2023, the Israeli conductor has recorded Bruckner's monumental Symphony No 5. Shani first encountered Bruckner's music as a young double bass player in Israel and has felt a deep connection to the composer's music ever since: 'His music has a sense not only of looking back and encompassing the history of music, but also very much looking forward and seeing the future [...] he wrote music that conveys such deep human emotion.'\n\n10 MAY 2024\n\nHaydn: The Complete Piano Trios, Vol 3\n\nTrio Gaspard\n\nChandos CHAN 20279\n\nRelease: 10 May 2024\n\nTrio Gaspard's revelatory series of Haydn's piano trios continues. Like the previous volumes, the repertoire is selected to work as a stand-alone recital, and includes a first recording - this time Revêtements by Kit Armstrong.\n\n3 MAY 2024\n\nVirtuoso Harpsichord Music\n\nMelody Lin, harpsichord\n\nCRD Records CRD 3546\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nHarpsichordist, fortepianist and modern pianist Melody Lin enjoys an active musical career in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Lin holds a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Historical Performance Practices and Keyboard Studies from Claremont Graduate University, where she studied harpsichord with Robert Zappulla, and modern piano and fortepiano with Jenny Soonjin Kim. Lin has had the pleasure to work with many renowned artists, and has participated both domestically and internationally in music festivals. Lin is currently a member of the Music Teachers Association of California. 'In November 1973, the music press was ablaze with announcements about the 'first new major British classical record label to hit the market for many years' and the 'hush-hush recording sessions' that had been in progress to mark its launch. These sessions included bringing harpsichordist Trevor Pinnock to listeners worldwide with his debut album Trevor Pinnock at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Released to critical acclaim, this album cemented the direction of the eagerly awaited new label, CRD Records: to champion new artists and to celebrate the full gamut of listening experiences offered through classical repertoire. Fifty years on musical tastes have expanded and the harpsichord often gets overlooked, undeservedly so. The harpsichord is an instrument that takes no prisoners; it demands precision and craft, musical sensitivity and more. In Melody Lin's performances, the rewards are great: as listeners, we are treated to the translation of black dots to bursts of exuberant colour, from elegance to joy to thunderous expressions of foreboding. If the music were to be represented in film, we would move from calm, pastoral scenes to mountainous terrain. This is in fact riveting cinema.' - Emma and Tom Pauncefort - CRD Directors\n\nTippett: A Child of our Time\n\nSoloists, BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus / Andrew Davis\n\nChandos CHSA 5341 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nAndrew Davis leads the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in this powerful new recording of Tippett's pacifist oratorio, with soloists Pumeza Matshikiza, Sarah Connolly, Joshua Stewart and Ashley Riches.\n\nJohn Williams in Tokyo\n\nSaito Kinen Orchestra / John Williams\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nAmerican composer John Williams returned to Japan for the first time in thirty years to conduct the Saito Kinen Orchestra in a performance of some of his most iconic scores - from Harry Potter to Star Wars. Invited personally by the legendary conductor and lifelong friend Seiji Ozawa, the new album John Williams in Tokyo captures the magic of this once in a lifetime event.\n\nGeorge Lloyd: A Litany; A Symphonic Mass\n\nJeremy White (bass), Janice Watson, soprano; Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra; Brighton Festival Chorus; Guildford Choral Society; Lazlo Heltay, choir conductor; Philharmonia Orchestra / George Lloyd\n\nLyrita SRCD 2419\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nThe Trustees of Lyrita Nimbus Arts (LNA) have reached an exclusive agreement with The George Lloyd Society (GLS) to take over the sale and hire of all George Lloyd's scores held by the Society as well as the commercial exploitation of the collection of recordings made by the Society in the 1990s and conducted by the composer. 'I just write what I have to write' - the artistic credo of George Lloyd conveys the directness and emotional honesty of his music, which is distinctive and written with integrity. He was fortunate enough to discover his individual and versatile musical voice at an early age. The deceptively artless quality of his scores stems from a thorough grounding in composition techniques. He wrote in a traditional idiom enriched by a close study of selected models, Verdi and Berlioz chief among them. There is a remarkable consistency to his output, most of which was created spontaneously and without the incentive of a commission. Conceived on a grand scale, Lloyd's late choral works build fruitfully upon his previous experience in other genres. They share with his operas an innate lyricism, natural affinity with the human voice and feeling for the long line, while their structural balance, intensive working out of motifs and rich orchestral palette owes a significant debt to his prolific symphonic output.\n\nGeorge Lloyd: Requiem; Psalm 130\n\nStephen Wallace, counter tenor; Jeffrey Makinson, organ; The Exon Singers / Matthew Owens\n\nLyrita SRCD 420\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nLloyd produced the final score of his Requiem a month before his death. It is inscribed 'to the memory of Diana Princess of Wales'. Compassionate, reassuring and even, at times, joyful, this is a conscious leave-taking on the part of the composer. His compact and cogent setting of Psalm 130 constitutes, arguably, his most fluently effective use of a cappella choral writing.\n\nChamber Music of Kenneth V Jones\n\nSoloists from the London Mozart Players\n\nLyrita SRCD 434\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nPrincipal cellist of the Mozart Players Sebastian Comberti writes, 'My first encounter with Kenneth V Jones was in 2016 when our family moved to the village of Bishop stone in the Sussex Downs. Over the course of several months, I was able to learn more of Kenneth's musical life. As soon as he mentioned having once written a string quartet, it was decided to programme the work during the following Season of Seaford Music Society, of which Kenneth was a long-standing member and whose programming I had recently taken on. Such was the warmth of the reception upon hearing the work that it was decided to explore more of Kenneth's chamber music output, and thus the idea for this CD was born. We have Kenneth to thank for the fact that the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music made the decision, at his suggestion, to include contemporary compositions in their graded examination syllabuses. Several of the short character pieces that Kenneth wrote for the ABRSM remain in the syllabus to this day, and a selection of these is included on this recording. It gave me huge pleasure to be able to present to Kenneth the first edit of the current CD, just a few days before his death in December 2020. He was absolutely thrilled.'\n\nElgar Symphony No 1 in A Flat & Symphony No 2 in E Flat\n\nHallé Orchestra / Mark Elder\n\nHallé CDHLD 7564\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nAmong the first releases on the Hallé recording label, established in 2003, were Elgar's Symphonies Nos 1 and 2. This recording revisits those works nearly twenty years later, and mark the culmination of Sir Mark Elder's tenure as Music Director. The First Symphony was premiered in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in 1908 by the Hallé and its Music Director, Hans Richter to whom the symphony is dedicated. It is a work of astonishing musical and structural mastery which was greeted with worldwide acclaim, receiving one hundred performances in its first year. The musical material demonstrates Elgar's skill at melody and transformation and presents a wide emotional range. By contrast the Second Symphony, with its deeply personal 'pilgrimage of a soul', initially received a more muted reception. However, it came into its own after the end of the first world war when the tone of remembrance and tribute possibly reflected the national mood, in what is now considered to be one of Elgar's finest works. The digital release of the symphonies is accompanied by a bonus track featuring Colin Matthews' arrangement of Elgar's part song The Prince of Sleep (1925). Matthews presented the arrangement to Mark Elder as a gift to mark the conductor's 70th birthday in 2017, and as a tribute to Elder's 'many splendid Elgar performances'. It also reflects what Matthews has described as 'a remarkable privilege to have been an observer of the Hallé's development over more than twenty years, watching it become, under Mark, one of the finest orchestras not just in the UK but in the world.'\n\nD F E Auber: La Part Du Diable\n\nCDO 1133\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nThis work began in the later part of D. F. E. Auber's creative life. His work at this stage seems to be unusually touched by emotions of the heart, by passion and the expression of a true sensibility. He produced works remarkable enough to keep himself at the front rank of public esteem, a position he had held from the very beginning of his career. Synopsis: The aristocratic theology student Rafaël d'Estungia has fallen in love with the dressmaker Casilda. In a series of unfortunate events he is disinherited, rejected by the military, and his lover goes missing. Rafaël believes there is no other way to overcome his misfortunes and tries to summon the devil. When he does not appear, Rafaël tries to end his life. Carlos, a singer, and witness to the unfolding events of Rafael's life, decides to provide hope to Rafaël by pretending to be Asmodeus (the devil). Carlos, sings to the King at the request of the Queen in a time of depression. For this act he is appointed Court Master of Music with his protégé Rafaël. Rafaël discovers Cassilda has been appointed lady-in-waiting by the Queen, and decides to take his chance to win her affection and kisses her. As punishment for his behaviour with Cassilda, the King has Rafaël arrested and sentenced to death. Trying to save Rafaël, Carlos lies and tells the King that Cassilda and Rafaél are already married. Using his influence with the Queen, he asks her to lie and say she was present at the wedding. Rafaël learns that he is the sole heir to the fortune of the Duque d'Estuńiga, with an inheritance of 600,000 ducats making him one of the richest noblemen in Spain. The King learns that Rafaël and Cassilda are not married and wants to punish them both. However, Carlos distracts the King by providing evidence of the secret plans that the Grand Inquisitor had made by revealing letters, this appeases the King. Carlos tells Rafaél he is no devil and Rafaël finally gets his happy ever after with Casilda.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach: The Complete Works for Keyboard, Vol 9: Köthen 1717-1723 - The Happy Years\n\nBenjamin Alard, harpsichord\n\nHarmonia Mundi HMM902472.73 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\n'The happy years': an expression that is particularly apt for J. S. Bach's period in Cöthen. Freed from the obligations that held him back in Weimar and not yet caught up in the Leipzig treadmill, Prince Leopold's protégé produced masterpieces of such flamboyance that Benjamin Alard could not resist the pleasure of inviting some of his dear musician friends to join him around the splendid three-manual harpsichord by Hass.\n\nMichael John Trotta: Requiem\n\nTenebrae / Nigel Short\n\nHampton Roads / Classical Music Productions 4764980712\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nGrounded in tradition, while incorporating a present-day harmonic language, Trotta's Requiem for choir and organ features two Gregorian Chant motives interwoven throughout with lush harmonies and soaring melodies, exquisitely sung by Tenebrae. Originally commissioned by a consortium of choirs, Trotta sought to honour the Requiem tradition whilst bringing it to new listeners, whether in the liturgical setting or concert hall. Fuelled by a passion for combining tradition and innovation, American composer Michael John Trotta (born 1978) creates music that resonates with modern audiences around the world. In addition to a significant output of music for unaccompanied choir, he has written nine choral-orchestral works on a larger scale. His most recent work, 'Requiem,' was recorded by Tenebrae Choir (Nigel Short, conductor). His select concert and sacred music is distributed by Excelcia Music. With a zeal for removing barriers to new music and artistic excellence, Trotta has created and funded a new initiative that distributes grants to choir directors and scholarships to future choral directors. Released during Death and Dying Awareness Matters Week (6 - 12 May 2024), streaming revenue from the album during this period will go to Hospice UK.\n\nYuja Wang - The Vienna Recital\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nGrammy-nominated Yuja Wang demonstrates her incredible range of interpretation with this eclectic program from her highly acclaimed 2022 Vienna recital. The star pianist displays fiery virtuosity in little-known compositions by György Ligeti and Nikolai Kapustin, as well as mature musicality in masterpieces by Beethoven and Alexander Scriabin.\n\nTaneyev and Schumann Piano Quintets\n\nPeter Donohoe, Sacconi Quartet\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD775\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nPeter Donohoe and the Sacconi Quartet join forces on this album for two masterpieces of the piano quintet genre. They were among the last UK musicians to tour Russia before the pandemic and subsequent invasion of Ukraine. The cover art was drawn by Schumann himself during his visit to Moscow in 1844. A joint winner of the 1982 International Tchaikovsky Competition, Peter Donohoe has been one of the UK's most revered musicians for decades. The Sacconi Quartet is famed for its imaginative approach to programming and captivating performances.\n\nBeethoven\n\nViktoria Mullova, Alasdair Beatson\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD794\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nFor their second joint album on Signum, violinist Viktoria Mullova and pianist Alasdair Beatson perform Beethoven's sonatas nos. 6, 1 and 8. As in previous recordings, Mullova plays a gut-strung violin and Beatson plays a copy of an 1805 Walter fortepiano. The consequent sound is much closer to what Beethoven intended, lending authenticity to the recording. Viktoria Mullova is a Russian-born British violinist known for her Bach recordings and innovative interpretations of jazz compositions. Adept on modern and historical instruments, pianist Alasdair Beatson is renowned as both artist and teacher.\n\nFour Hands\n\nAlexandre Tharaud & guests\n\nErato 5054197933523\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\n'This was something I'd had in mind for a long time ... to put together an album for the sheer pleasure of it, in collaboration with dear friends and paying tribute to the wonders of the piano duet repertoire.' - Alexandre Tharaud. Four Hands consists of 22 tracks, with French pianist Alexandre Tharaud sharing the keyboard with a different performer on each. The repertoire ranges from Bach to Glass through composers such as Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Grieg, Rachmaninov, Ravel and Piazzolla. The pianists featured on the album include the late Nicholas Angelich, Martin James Bartlett, Mariam Batsashvili, Bertrand Chamayou, David Fray, Bruce Liu, Víkingur Ólafsson, Beatrice Rana and others. Three tracks feature soloists typically known for their skills on other instruments: cellist Gautier Capuçon, countertenor Philippe Jaroussky and the Paris-born singer-songwriter Juliette Noureddine.\n\nWonder Women\n\nChristina Pluhar, L'Arpeggiata feat. Céline Scheen, Luciana Mancini, Benedetta Mazzucato, Vincenzo Capezzuto\n\nErato 5054197959165\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nWonder Women, the latest recording project from Christina Pluhar and her ensemble L'Arpeggiata, pays homage to Italian female composers of the seventeenth century, and female characters portrayed in the traditional music of Italy and Latin America. The programme includes works by Francesca Caccini (arguably the best-known female composer of the Baroque age), Barbara Strozzi, Antonia Bembo and Isabella Leonarda, as well as male composers Maurizio Cazzati and Andrea Falconieri. The album also features traditional songs from Italy and Mexico, arranged by Pluhar herself.\n\nMozart Stories\n\nEmmanuel Pahud, Éric Le Sage\n\nWarner Classics 5054197893520\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nFlautist Emmanuel Pahud joins forces with pianist Éric Le Sage to perform transcriptions of several of Mozart's Violin Sonatas, now regarded as beloved additions to the flute repertoire. The programme includes Mozart's Sonata in B flat major K. 378 (1779), Sonata in G major K. 379 (1781), Sonata in E minor K. 304 (1778) and Sonata in C major K. 296 (1778). This album is of particular personal significance to Pahud, who stated: 'Mozart is the reason why I became a musician'.\n\nMeditation 333 - RIOPY\n\nWarner Classics 505419799241 (digital only - 3 tracks)\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nContinuing pianist-composer RIOPY's series of piano music designed for healing and peace, this album consists of three meticulously crafted piano tracks - Meditation 3, Twilight Meditation and Meditation 33. Part music, part audio tools, each track is connected by a single repetitive structure, designed to guide listeners through a deep personal meditation.\n\nFranck: Symphony in D minor; Debussy: Trois Nocturnes\n\nMünchner Philharmoniker / Sergiu Celibidache\n\nMunich Philharmonic MPHIL0027\n\nRelease: 3 May 2024\n\nIn these remastered concert recordings from 1991 and 1983, legendary conductor Sergiu Celibidache conducts the Munich Philharmonic in César Franck's Symphony in D minor and Claude Debussy's Nocturnes.\n\n1 MAY 2024\n\nMartucci Collection\n\nOrchestra Sinfonica di Roma, Francesco La Vecchia, Quartetto Noferini, Luca Braga, Lucia Pittau, Roberto Trainini, Massimiliano Ferrati, Alberto Miodini, Chiarastella Onorati, Luisa Prayer\n\nBrilliant Classics 96920 (10 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nThe most comprehensive collection ever released of Giuseppe Martucci's music, in stylish modern recordings by native Italian musicians. An Italian Brahms is an unlikely idea, but it encapsulates a superficial acquaintance with the music of Giuseppe Martucci (1856-1909). Any listener curious to take a deeper dive into the richly Romantic melodies and impassioned large-scale structures of Martucci will find no better place to start than this survey of his major works in every instrumental genre. Martucci grew up in Naples as the son of a military bandmaster, and this background seems to have instilled in him a creative impulse to swim against the operatic tide of native composers, and focus his energies on writing instrumental music. He was an accomplished pianist, received with great enthusiasm on tours of France, Germany and England, and the tremendous sweep of his Piano Concerto loses nothing by comparison with far more familiar examples. Brought to life here by Alberto Miodini, the piano music, too, is intensely wrought, but it never loses a pre-eminence of melody which was Martucci's heritage. In 1888 he conducted the Italian premiere of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde; his song-cycle La canzone dei Ricordi, written a year earlier, is the closest he came to translating the opera's chromatic eroticism into his own music, and this box affords the opportunity to hear the piece in both its orchestral and piano versions; no less enlightening than (for example) the distinct versions of the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss. CD10 collects Martucci's other songs for soprano, such as the remarkable Pagine sparse of 1888. Other highlights of the set include Martucci's deep investment in chamber music, resulting in piano trios, violin and cello sonatas, and a magnificently brooding Piano Quintet, again in the Brahmsian mould.\n\nSimeon Ten Holt: Canto Ostinato [Deluxe Edition]\n\nAart Bergwerff, organ; Eric Vloeimans, trumpet\n\nBrilliant Classics 97409\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nA new and strikingly effective arrangement of a modern minimalist classic. Canto Ostinato is a familiar landmark of modern Dutch art music. Known affectionately and simply as the Canto, it receives many performances each year in a plethora of arrangements, whether with the two or four pianos which Simeon ten Holt had in mind when he wrote the work in 1976, or performed by soloists and ensembles. This flexibility is inherent in the form of the piece. Ten Holt supplies a sequence of 106 rhythmic cells which may be repeated one or many more times, thus potentially creating a duration of one or many more hours. The simple and repetitive patterns blur the listener's sense of time, which becomes space: space for the performers, space for creation, but also space for the listeners, space for imagination. At the invitation of Orgelpark Amsterdam, the organist Aart Bergwerff has been giving annual performances of Canto Ostinato, always in a new instrumentation, in company with different musicians. This groundbreaking version for trumpet and organ arose as the result of a chance meeting backstage between Bergwerff and the trumpeter Eric Vloeimans. The recording captures a concert given in October 2023 at the Orgelpark, presenting Canto Ostinato as a kind of monody for trumpet and organ, like a long-spun solo with basso continuo. Bergwerff and Vloeimans had known each other as students at the conservatoire in Rotterdam, and so this artistic partnership was a renewal of friendship as well as a synthesis of common musical values. Relying as it does on the stamina of a solo trumpeter, this version of Canto Ostinato is necessarily shorter than most of the canonic versions, but it illuminates the piece with a fresh perspective, more melodically focused than keyboard-centric instrumentations, and evolving more rapidly through Ten Holt's cycle of harmonic change.\n\nJohann Wilhelm Hertel: Oboe Concertos\n\nKatarzyna Pilipiuk, baroque oboe; Ensemble Il Vento\n\nBrilliant Classics 97097\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nJohann Wilhelm Hertel (1727-1789) is one of the lesser-known composers of the late baroque and early classical era. Born in Eisenach in 1727, as a young man he travelled to the north of Germany with his father, who was a viola da gamba virtuoso engaged as a Kapellmeister at the court of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Already as a young man Johann Wilhelm showed a remarkable talent for music. He excelled on the harpsichord and violin, but his father wanted him to additionally study law. However, a trip to Berlin and contact with Berlin court musicians Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Franz Benda pushed the young Johann Wilhelm to devote his life primarily to music. In particular he studied the harpsichord with Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, the violin with Franz Benda and composition with Karl Heinrich Graun. He spent his life in the service of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz and -Schwerin courts, and he was also music director in Stralsund. It was during this time that he had many opportunities to meet authorities from both the musical and scientific worlds. His oboes concertos are exemplary compositions of these times. The autographs, which are preserved in the Library of the Royal Conservatoire of Brussels (Sig No B-Bc-5562 and B-Bc-5563), together contain ten oboe concertos in various keys. Nine of them are collected (and numbered by librarians) in Sig No B-Bc-5562 ,and one is separately placed as B-Bc-5563. As there is no catalogue of Hertel's works, the numbers given for the concertos are taken from the manuscript Sig No B-Bc-5562. Some of the pieces are dated 1749 (Concertos Nos 3 and 9) and others 1756 (Concerto No 2). All the concertos were prepared for this recording by Katarzyna Pilipiuk, copying with a focus on accuracy; only minor mistakes were corrected so as to give the most faithful transmission of the composer's ideas. The material is very clear, with all the pieces noted by the composer in score form. All of them have signs of stylistic inspiration from the works of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, in particular Concerto No 5, which is an excellent work in the Empfindsamer Stil.\n\nJosef Mysliveček: Complete Keyboard Works\n\nMarius Bartoccini, fortepiano\n\nBrilliant Classics 95864 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nThe new focus on Bohemian classicism in the second half of the eighteenth century, manifested in recent recordings and articles in professional journals, has amply demonstrated the calibre of these composers and the quality of their music. Among them, Josef Mysliveček (1737-1781) enjoyed considerable fame during his lifetime. He was known to such important figures as the soprano Caterina Gabrielli and was a friend of Mozart's, who esteemed him. Mysliveček's like many of his contemporaries strove for musical success and economic independence through opera composition, a career that was high-profile but also challenging in the late eighteenth century. And he did not consider the fortepiano to be as important a vehicle of expression, unlike Mozart, as can be seen in his meagre solo keyboard output. The Six Divertimenti are single-movement compositions, and while probably intended as didactic, they are not sterile exercises for amateurs but exquisite pieces that satisfy the most discerning palates. The Six Sonatas are short but brilliant pieces, based on the galant style transmuted into a pre-classicism very akin to the Mannheim school, with energetic first movements with a symphonic flavour alternating with elegant and delicate minuets. Given the small number of Mysliveček's compositions for solo fortepiano, it was decided to include two additional, rare pieces worthy of this monograph: two of his Wind Octets Op 1 in a contemporary solo keyboard transcription by Václav Vincenc Mašek. Mysliveček's writing features remarkable counterpoint, compressed by Mašek into an exemplary arrangement. This recording is intended as the first on historical instruments. (There is already a box by Clare Hammond on modern piano with the Divertimenti for fortepiano, the six Sonatas and the Concertos for fortepiano and orchestra.) The arranged Octets (most likely never previously performed, let alone recorded) are offered as world premieres.\n\nAlfredo Franco: Music for Guitar\n\nCristiano Porqueddu, guitar\n\nBrilliant Classics 96481 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nBorn in Torino in 1967, Alfredo Franco was involved in non-classical music in his youth before taking up the classical guitar. He then undertook advanced studies in the historical and critical fields in the Department for Art, Music and Theatre of the University of Turin. He would later abandon concert activity as a performer and focus instead on composition. His now prolific classical guitar output has been well received by important interpreters such as Cristiano Porqueddu and increasingly programmed on the stage and in the studio. This triple-disc set constitutes a broad cross-section of Franco's solo guitar music. Porqueddu has offered brief comments on some of the many, varied compositions that will be new to many listeners. A Bleached September Sky: multiple short episodes evoking sudden premonitions. A Night's Tale features a rapid, edgy central section set between a dreamlike beginning and end. Alphabetical Portraits conceptually depicts seven composers by associating the letters in their surnames with notes of the chromatic scale. Inezie deliziose is a collection of miniature album leaves heralding the frivolity of an imaginary past. Fantasia No 7 contrapuntally pays homage to Renaissance vihuelists. Il flauto nel bosco - Omaggio a Grazia Deledda: a sonatina based on the Nobel Prize-winning Sardinian author's renowned collection of short stories. La regina delle tenebre - Su un racconto di Grazia Deledda is inspired by an eponymous short story, again by the Sardinian author. La guitarra callada - Homage to Frederic Mompou seeks to convey the Catalan composer's atmospheres. Quaderno di aprile is a minimalist diary, composed almost compulsively along a few days in April. Mirando un cuadro de Goya is one possible interpretation of the painter's Pavo muerto. Microsuite is designed to provide an introduction to contemporary musical languages. Petite Suite mécanique honours three guitarists from different eras: Robert de Visée, Miguel Llobet and Leo Brouwer. Sette aforismi: short, sparse studies on timbre and colour. Sonatina autunnale sits somewhere between Manuel Ponce and Alfredo Casella. Sonatina estiva pays tribute to Carlo Carrà and his paintings of seaside shacks. Tarreghiana: a theme and variations based on Tárrega's famous Prelude in A minor. Wintergarten is a farewell stroll in a Schumannesque winter garden, evoking chorales and with variations.\n\nLouis Massonneau: 3 Duos Concertante Op 9\n\nDylan Baraldi, violin; Demian Baraldi, cello\n\nBrilliant Classics 96758\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nAttractive Classical-era duets for violin and cello in world-premiere recordings by a young Italian pair of brothers. Despite his French name, Louis Massonneau was a German composer, born in Kassel in 1766 and dying at the venerable age of eighty-two in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in 1848. His father was chef to the Landgrave Friedrich II of Hessen-Kassel, and Louis received his musical training at the hands of the court musicians in Kassel, soon becoming a violinist in the court orchestra. The Landgrave died when Massonneau was nineteen, and the orchestra disbanded, requiring him to seek his fortune elsewhere. This he did in a series of posts, as a concertmaster of court and theatre orchestras in Göttingen, Frankfurt, Altona, Dessau, Hamburg and finally Mecklenburg, where he settled for good and retired in 1837. Composing all the while, Massonneau left behind a fairly substantial catalogue. Almost completely unknown apart from a trio of oboe quartets, it includes three symphonies, twelve symphonies and six violin concertos, doubtless written with his own talents in mind. These three Duos Concertante probably date from Massonneau's time in Altona, when he came to know the cellist Martin Calmus. Required to perform duets for the entertainment of those attending 'Musical Academies', Massonneau doubtless found a dearth of such repertoire, and wrote it afresh. Calmus himself must have been an accomplished cellist, because both parts demonstrate a virtuosity and experimental spirit shared with the better-known music of their contemporary Boccherini. Each duo is cast in three movements, skilfully varied in form from the others, in which lyrical expression is tempered by a touch of irony. Haydnesque touches of major-minor ambiguity lend dramatic tension to the first duo, while a more balletic spirit and Mozartian melodic charm brings a quasi-operatic character to the second. No 3 is the most innovative in its rapid conversational interplay between violin and cello and unconventional range of timbre. Demian and Dylan Baraldi have made this recording with the cooperation of the Edition Massonneau, and authoritative booklet notes from the Edition illuminate the composer's life and work.\n\nNicolas Vallet: Lute Music\n\nYavor Genov, lute\n\nBrilliant Classics 96925\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nThe lute master Nicolas Vallet (c 1583-c 1642) lived and worked in a borderland between musical categories. The first three decades of his life were spent in France, then his musical career and published compositions unfolded in Amsterdam. Widely acknowledged as a lute and dance teacher in the Netherlands, he also won fame as one of the most important and prolific authors of sacred music for his instrument, making lute settings of the Calvinist psalms from the Genevan Psalter. Vallet lived when the lute was undergoing significant changes in terms of tuning, right hand technique and predominant genres, with the impulse for some of these changes coming from his French compatriots. Yet he demonstrates that the older Renaissance approaches towards both composition and performance are still relevant. An impressive part of his repertoire comprises contrapuntal preludes and fantasias following the manner of the masters of previous generations, in which various thematic motives and complex abstract forms are woven into the polyphonic texture. At the same time his lute collections include vast variety of dances, some of which were just entering the performance practice of the time, such as the Sarabande and Bourée. The volume Regia Pietas is entirely dedicated to Protestant (Calvinist) sacred music intabulated for lute solo. Most of the psalms are arranged in two parts. Vallet's main approaches to these chants is to either develop them as a set of variations or provide them a contrapuntal treatment. This shows that Vallet's output covers the three instrumental genres of the Renaissance: free abstract pieces (preludes and fantasias), dances and settings of vocal pieces. For this recording a ten-course lute is used, strung in gut at 415 Hz. This type of gut stringing considerably affects the overall sound of the lute, its resonance and sonority, hopefully bringing the lute a bit closer to what one might imagine as an 'original' sound of the time.\n\nBach à la française\n\nOlivier Penin, organ\n\nBrilliant Classics 97279\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nVirtuoso transcriptions for many of J S Bach's best-known instrumental pieces, performed on the superb Cavaille-Coll instrument at Sainte-Clotilde in Paris by its prodigiously gifted titular organist. Born in 1981, Olivier Penin began playing the piano at the age of five and in 1987 he joined the Schola Cantorum in Caen. In 2004, at the age of twenty-three, he was appointed to the tribune of the great organ of the basilica of Sainte-Clotilde in Paris. This was a remarkable achievement for so youthful a musician, and Penin has become one of France's most illustrious organists, filling the shoes of such distinguished titulaires as César Franck, Gabriel Pierné and Charles Tournemire and Jean Langlais. Sainte-Clotilde seems to have attracted so distinguished a lineage of composer-organists in part because of the versatility of the instrument installed there by Cavaillé-Coll in 1859. Frank remarked: 'If you only knew how I love this instrument ... it is so supple beneath my fingers and so obedient to all my thoughts!' While they bear only a tangential relationship to the North-German organs known by Bach, being much more highly coloured, the Cavaillé-Coll instruments have a clarity of articulation and power that measures up to the composer's music in its own magnificent way. This is especially well illustrated in the art of transcription which Olivier Penin both practises himself and celebrates with this recital. He includes his own versions of the Air ('on a G string') from the Third Orchestral Suite, and the Sicilienne from the E flat major Flute Sonata, alongside classics of the repertoire, beginning with Marcel Dupré's dazzling distillation of the Sinfonia from BWV 29 (itself an orchestral version by Bach of the Preludio in E from the Third Violin Sonata. Virgil Fox's Gothically gloomy elaboration of Komm, süsser Tod closes out the recital, which has as its centrepiece a similarly monumental version of the D minor Chaconne (again originally for solo violin) by Henri Messerer.\n\nGeorge Benjamin: Complete Piano Works\n\nErik Bertsch, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10287\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nThe only collected survey of George Benjamin's piano music on record, from a Dutch pianist who specialises in new music and has worked closely with the composer. Benjamin (born 1960) was an accomplished pianist as well as composer from his early years, and it seems natural in retrospect that his first published work should be the Piano Sonata he composed in 1977-8, as a prodigious student of Olivier Messiaen and Yvonne Loriod. Certain harmonic touches may mark the sonata out as the work of 'a Messiaen pupil' but the unsettled, leaping gestural sense of the piece is particular to Benjamin. So much of Benjamin's later music is fascinatingly prefigured here, including a sense of timing for a gradual accumulation of tension ('stormy eruptions' and 'savage violence' in the composer's words) that marks out his first major orchestral score, Ringed by the Flat Horizon. Underlying that sense of timing is a feeling for dramatic gesture which has found its natural expression in a series of operas written during the last twenty years. Dedicated to Loriod, Sortilèges (1981) makes clear its French heritage in the notes as well as the title, while the three subsequent Studies for piano, composed over the next four years, find Benjamin working out intricate rhythmic problems and their solutions. Even the Relativity Rag takes a quirky, sideways look at its superficially familiar material. The next piano pieces had to wait until 2001, and the Shadowlines which Benjamin wrote for Pierre-Laurent Aimard. This set of six canonic preludes takes Benjamin's inclination to distill and pare back to a new level, while the piano writing itself is richer and more unselfconsciously informed by the heritage of piano literature. Finally, there are the Piano Figures of 2004, written for students of the piano and accordingly pitched at a technically lower level than the other pieces, but no less preoccupied with the rhythmic games and sudden swerves of thought that are hallmarks of his most complex music. All these pieces have been recorded, but never by the same pianist, making Erik Bertsch's new collection unique, and indispensable for any collector of new music.\n\nBeethoven: Con alcune licenze - Hammerklavier Sonata Op 106; Piano Sonata Op 110; Grosse Fuge Op 133 (piano solo version)\n\nAndrea Molteni, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10309\n\nRelease: 1 May 2024\n\nNew recordings of late Beethoven at his most heroic and visionary. With his 'Hammerklavier' Sonata of 1818, the composer challenged pianists and listeners alike to assimilate a work unprecedented in its length and complexity. Motivically linked by a descending third through the eventful course of its four movements, the Sonata opens with a precipitous Allegro. A mordant Scherzo then introduces a long and spiritually engaged slow movement, before the mighty finale hurtles towards its epic conclusion through a densely wrought fugue. In each aspect, then, the Sonata outlines blueprints for what would become known as Beethoven's late style, whether expressed in solo, chamber, orchestral or vocal music. The most celebrated single result of that late style is the Grosse Fuge which Beethoven wrote as the finale to his String Quartet Op 131. Persuaded by his publisher to substitute it for a less arduous conclusion, Beethoven left this mighty fugue to stand on its own, and so it has stood ever since, as a ferocious yet rewarding exercise of concentration and contrapuntal art. Molteni presents it in a nineteenth century arrangement made by Louis Winkler which has attracted surprisingly few recordings. At the centre of Molteni's recital, the Sonata Op 110 offers salutary contrast. Here too are examples of heroism, rustic humour and melancholy, but distilled to an essence of vitality.\n\n26 APRIL 2024\n\nKevin Puts: The Hours\n\nJoyce DiDonato, Renée Fleming, Kelli O'Hara, The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra & Chorus / Yannick Nézet-Seguin\n\nErato\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\n'Even though it deals with death head-on, the piece is life-affirming and tells a timeless story. The characters' struggles are shared universally ... hopefully, everybody can find a part of themselves in the story.' - Joyce DiDonato. Based on both the award-winning 2002 film directed by Stephen Daldry and the original novel by Michael Cunningham, Kevin Puts' The Hours interweaves characters and events from three different periods of the twentieth century. Premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 2022 with Joyce DiDonato, Renée Fleming and Kelli O'Hara as its stars, the production returns to The Met with the same cast in May 2024.\n\nGluck: Orfeo ed Euridice\n\nJakub Józef Orliński, Elsa Dreisig, Fatma Said, Il Giardino d'Amore, Stefan Plewniak\n\nErato\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nOrfeo has quickly become one of Jakub Józef Orliński's signature roles; now, he releases his own recording of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, the culmination of a long-held dream. To bring his interpretation to life, the Polish countertenor acted as producer, casting director and joint artistic director - his first involvement with an opera production on a directorial level. Recorded in Orliński's native city, Warsaw, this recording was conducted by Stefan Plewniak with Il Giardino d'Amore, featuring an all-star cast with Elsa Dreisig as Euridice and Fatma Said as Amore.\n\nBrindley Sherratt: Fear No More\n\nBrindley Sherratt, bass; Julius Drake, piano\n\nDelphian Records DCD34313\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nBrindley Sherratt's pre-eminence as an operatic bass is the result of two daring career shifts. Initially trained as a trumpeter, he gave up his first instrument as a student to become a singer. Yet even then, it was only in his mid-thirties that he left the professional security of a position in the BBC Singers to explore the world of opera. Now, the voyage of discovery continues as Sherratt turns to the intimate medium of the song recital. With the superb pianist Julius Drake as collaborator, in Fear No More Sherratt draws on all of his accumulated technical and expressive wisdom to traverse death-haunted songs by Schubert, Mussorgsky and Richard Strauss before arriving at a final group of five twentieth-century English songs in which consolation and acceptance are the keynotes.\n\nCantabile: Anthems for Viola\n\nJordan Bak, viola; Richard Uttley, piano\n\nDelphian Records DCD34317\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe Jamaican-American violist Jordan Bak has already achieved international acclaim for his radiant stage presence, dynamic interpretations and fearless power. In his Delphian debut, joined by the outstanding pianist Richard Uttley, he offers powerful readings of two substantial twentieth-century works - Arnold Bax's Sonata for Viola and Piano and Benjamin Britten's Lachrymae: Reflections on a song of John Dowland, written respectively for Lionel Tertis and William Primrose - and sets them alongside more recent music for solo viola by Jonathan Harvey and Bright Sheng. The viola's capacity for deeply felt, wordless song is further explored in Augusta Read Thomas's Song without Words, receiving its premiere recording in a version specially composed for Bak and Uttley.\n\nJeff Beal: The New York Études\n\nPlatoon PLAT22759\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nA celebrated multi-Emmy award composer of music for film and stage, Jeff Beal has honed an instantly recognisable musical voice. From his student years learning to improvise on the trumpet, to discovering the endless possibilities in harmonic colour and chord spacing on the piano, Beal's music is rooted in intuition and the ritual of practice. The New York Études, ten new works for solo piano, were composed in the months after Beal relocated to New York City in 2021. Meditative, rich and complex, each piece reveals a master's understanding of voice leading and harmony. Beal hopes that these works will become a part of other pianists' repertoire. The album was recorded in his home in Manhattan. It has long been recognised that regular piano playing sharpens motor skills and boosts cognitive function. There are a host of benefits reaped from time spent at the piano - and recent studies have shown that in Multiple Sclerosis sufferers, regular piano playing can improve hand function, limb co-ordination and agility. Beal was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2007 and says 'The practice of making music is of utmost importance in my daily life. When I received my diagnosis, I researched ways that I might strengthen my brain. Learning about music's impact on neuroplasticity, or the rewiring of the brain around areas of damage, gave me the impetus I needed to spend more time at the piano. These compositions are an organic result of this.' The majority of Beal's MS lesions were displayed on the corpus callosum - an area often hyper-developed in musicians, as it connects the right and left hemisphere. His quality of life is directly linked to cognitive function and his daily practice has become essential for sustaining brain health. Beal adds 'An added benefit I discovered while composing and practicing the Études was the sense of calm and focus I experienced. I've become keenly aware of the importance of wellness rituals for all of us that promote good mental, spiritual, and physical health.' These ten piano pieces give a personal reintroduction to Beal's compositional artistry, and offer a new window into the music of a composer, whose dedication to his craft shows in every creative decision.\n\nFenella Humphreys: Prism\n\nRubicon RCD1127\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nFenella brings a unique programme called 'Prism' which focuses on unaccompanied violin pieces of new works written by young British composers: Michael Small, Bethan Morgan-Williams & Cheryl Frances-Hoad. Among these fresher works, Fenella also brings more iconic works by influential contemporary composers from the UK and the USA: Caroline Shaw, Jessie Montgomery, George Walker and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. One of the highlights of the album is Fenella's new arrangement of J S Bach's Toccata and Fugue BWV 565. 'This album grew out of a longing to keep performing music that I was gifted, arranged or first discovered during the spring of 2020.' - Fenella Humphreys\n\nTchaikovsky: String Quartets Vol 1\n\nDudok Quartet Amsterdam\n\nRubicon RCD1103\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nRubicon Classics presents the first volume of Tchaikovsky's string quartets with the Dudok Quartet Amsterdam. The Quartet is well known for their beautiful vintage instruments and their fondness of nineteenth century music, which is why they have selected two chamber works by Tchaikovsky. String Quartet No 1 in D which has Tchaikovsky's famous Andante Cantabile & String Quartet No 2 in F. Tchaikovsky referred to this work as one of his best as it encapsulates his essence so simply and easily, the reason being - he wrote it in one sitting. Bringing the album to a close is a special arrangement of 'Lensky's Aria' from 'Eugene Onegin', written by the quartet's cellist David Faber.\n\nA Breaking Sky\n\nCharlie Grey and Joseph Peach\n\nBraw Sailin'\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe duo's innovative approach to music-making, marked by their distinctive visual interpretations and intuitive improvisation, sets A Breaking Sky apart as a truly immersive and evocative listening experience, combining both the rich traditions of folk with elements of instrumental and contemporary classical music. Forgoing pre-arranged compositions in favour of free improvisation, the Glasgow-based duo sought to capture the essence of their creative process in its purest form with this record - resulting in an unparalleled level of originality, authenticity and raw emotion. Central to the album's sonic identity is the recording setting of Ardkinglas House on the shores of Loch Fyne in Argyll, renowned for its exquisite acoustics and vintage pianos. The decision to record entirely live, with Charlie and Joseph performing in the same room, lends an intimate and spontaneous quality to the music, further enhanced by the analogue mixing process overseen by acclaimed engineer and co-producer Mattie Foulds.\n\nJan Martin Smordal: My Favorite Thing\n\nLAWO LWC1276\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nBetween 2015-2017, Smordal composed three works under the name 'My Favorite Thing', consisting of music for the percussion trio Pinquins (MFT 1), Ensemble neoN (MFT 2), and the Broadcasting Orchestra (MFT 3). Based on interviews with all participating performers, Smordal has interpreted\n\nthe performers' formative encounters with music from childhood. The works consist of direct quotations, abstracted reflections and free retellings. Smordal has long been concerned with mechanisms behind herd behaviour, reflex movements, self-standing patterns and spontaneous social dynamics. Thoughts about such phenomena, and concretizing and interpreting such phenomena as sound and flow, have been the springboard for much of his work over the past ten years. On this release you can hear an early example of this, where an individual's short-term memory forms an entire swarm, 'Flock of me' played by Yumi Murakami. The disc also contains another early work 'less-sense'. The piece was written for and performed by Silje Aker Johnsen, Kristine Tjogersen and Ane Marthe Sorlien Holen. Through a text fragment by Augustine, the I-person tries to remove his former self, gradually by unraveling his own note. Jan Martin Smordal (born 1978) is a composer and performer. He is also a member and co-founder of Ensemble neoN, an award- winning new music collective that initiates and implements projects internationally. Smrdal is an established composer with works for orchestra and chamber ensembles, in addition to installations, choral works and improvisations in various forms. He is co-recipient of a number of Spellemannprize, and in 2022 received Arne Nordheim's Composer's Prize.\n\nAurora - Works for Cello and Piano by Jerzy Gablenz\n\nPawel Czarakcziew, cello; Piotr Kowal, piano\n\nDux Recording Producers DUX2046\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nWith this album, the Czarakcziew/Kowal Duo pay tribute to the forgotten Cracow composer Jerzy Gablenz, who, endowed with an outstanding compositional talent, also partly devoted himself to running a family business and studying law. Despite this, Gablenz still managed to write, among others, an opera, symphonic poems, a piano concerto and above all 86 songs, which were his favourite form of expression. Three of them, in the duo's original arrangement, are featured on this album, together with a monumental cello sonata. Gablenz uses a post-romantic style, full of momentum and mood changes. One can find here echoes of the oeuvre of his professors, Zelenski and Nowowiejski, but also of Rachmaninoff. The extensive form and dense texture are a challenge for performers, but also an incentive to regularly present this work on stage. The Czarakcziew/Kowal Duo is co-created by artists associated with the Cracow Academy of Music, winners of international competitions, actively performing both solo and chamber music. They specialize in searching for outstanding but unknown twentieth and 21st century music.\n\nMonk of Salzburg: Nicodemus Passion - A medieval adaptation\n\nDuo Enssle-Lamprecht, Susanne Ansorg\n\nAUDAX ADX11212\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe fascinating and elusive figure of the Monk of Salzburg, whose actual name we will probably never know, has been enriched by a further work - a Passion setting that can be linked to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus and which the Enssle-Lamprecht duo sensually and poetically bring to life with their incomparable virtuosity and an astonishing arsenal of medieval instruments.\n\nFreedom - George Frideric Handel: Oratorio Arias\n\nLa Sfera Armoniosa, Oscar Verhaar, Mike Fentross\n\nChallenge Classics CC72973\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe debut album by young countertenor Oscar Verhaar showcases eight arias drawn from Handel's English oratorios.Freedom is a dominant theme in the English oratorios of Georg Friedrich Handel\n\nThese grand works are mostly based on biblical stories that deal with resistance, suppression, captivity and, finally, freedom. In his oeuvre we find impressive slave choruses and many arias about (the lack of) freedom, eight of which are presented on this album.As a versatile early music singer, countertenor Oscar Veraar has been performing major works by composers such as Bach and Handel next to lesser-known music from the Middle Ages to the eighteenth century. His interest in performance practice also leads him to do much of the required musicological research for these works. In this recording he can benefit from the invaluable support of an experienced orchestra like La Sfera Armoniosa, conducted by Mike Fentross.\n\nClori 1662 - Music from 400 Years ago\n\nEnsemble Del Passato\n\nDux Recording Producers DUX1667\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nEnsemble Del Passato is distinguished by its passion for early music and the subtle sound of voice, lute and guitars. The musicians search for forgotten old prints and manuscripts to creatively but faithfully recreate their probable forms and sounds. This debut album from Ensemble del Passato is the fruit of research on songs that today remain in the shadow of larger, late Baroque forms. The album features works by Italian composers - Biagio Marini, Carlo Milanuzzi and Giovanni Stefani. They share a simplified tablature notation, the so-called alfabeto, which facilitated their performance. They are influenced by, among others, sung dances of Iberian origin based on folk lyrics. There are also compositions modelled on court dances, more harmonically and poetically refined. The texts use the then popular love motifs. Despite the lack of virtuoso passages, the pieces are a charming testimony to the shape of the European musical culture from four centuries ago.\n\nBenjamin Oliver: Too Many Sweets\n\nHannah Williams, Riot Ensemble, Yshani Perinpanayagam, Cliodna Shanahan, Dorothy Chan, Ensemble Saxologie\n\nBirmingham Record Company BRC024\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThis portrait album showcasing the work of composer Benjamin Oliver is filled to the brim with filthy crooked grooves and shameless flirtations with the nearest triad, with Oliver enlisting the help of chipmusic composer Blake Troise (aka PROTODOME) and his troupe of little beeping synths as a means to explore his love for all things human alongside his intrigue for the non-sentient. There is a strong jazz influence on the record, not only in the sound but also infused in Oliver's ideology. His desire to explore the feel and sound of individual players and voices as keenly as the instrumentation itself is at the heart of his practice. This music is precise, deeply technical, with a strong invitation for performer interpretation. Oliver's relationship with 1-bit synthesisers, contemporary AI lyric generation and everything in between continues to evolve; having begun the journey with players and synths more in opposition, he is now looking to the machine as a direct collaborator. Both approaches lead to highly inventive and unique works. Keyboard instruments feature heavily. Pianist Yshani Perinpanayagam performs Drip Feeder (recently selected for the British section of the ISCM); Cliodna Shanahan plays on the London Sinfonietta commissioned A- Listers; and New York based (toy) pianist Dorothy Chan features on the title track Too Many Sweets (when Dorothy met Blake). Oliver's strong links with the Montreal contemporary music scene are represented by Ensemble Saxologie in their recording of new saxophone quartet Avalanche. The heart of album is British soul sensation Hannah Williams performing Oliver's AI-informed song cycle Love Letters, alongside a quartet of UK new music royalty from Riot Ensemble. Benjamin Oliver is a composer, conductor and jazz pianist. His music has been performed by leading musicians including lutenist Elizabeth Kenny, Ensemble Paramirabo and London Sinfonietta, broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as well as recorded and released by labels including Linn and Prima Facie. Oliver is Associate Professor in Composition at the University of Southampton.\n\nScott McLaughlin: we are environments for each other\n\nMira Benjamin, Zubin Kanga, Scott McLaughlin\n\nHuddersfield Contemporary Records HCR33\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nDeveloped over ten years of collaborative work between Scott McLaughlin, violinist Mira Benjamin and pianist Zubin Kanga, 'we are environments for each other' takes the listener on a journey of shifting textural layers, evolving harmonic structures, and slow musical contemplation. Here violin and piano eschew conventional chamber music idioms to conjure fluctuating, sustained drones. This record continues McLaughlin's long standing work with the idea of 'material indeterminacy', using the way an instrument responds in the hands of a performer to guide musical forms. In these pieces, music exists not as sequences of predetermined sounds but as sets of possibilities; areas of exploration for the performers to carefully unfold. Each recording on this record is just one possible realisation of the work, tightly bounded within an agreed soundworld, but with the possibility to take a different direction in the moment of any performance. In the opening track, we are environments for each other [trio], the instruments are no longer texturally distinct, as the electric violin becomes part of a feedback system that resonates the strings of the piano, merging together in a manner that is at once a single entangled thing, and two competing inputs to a complex system. In the endless mobility of listening, the specially devised technique of 'drone-bowing' takes the re-tuned violin into a world of harmonics and noise, surrounded by ethereal electronic textures. Finally, in the unknown there is already a script for transcendence a recognisable piano sound acts as a bell-like refrain, although the piano's strings are mostly excited by an EBow, rather than by striking the keyboard, eliciting sustained, slowly-shifting textures. 'we are environments for each other' is a record that showcases McLaughlin's use of material indeterminacy to elicit compellingly original musical relationships, an exploration of sounds on the edge, of becoming nothing or more-than-one-thing.\n\nC P E Bach and C F Abel: Sonatas for Viola da Gamba & Fortepiano\n\nRebeka Ruso; Sebastian Wienand\n\nChristophorus CHE02322\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe era of the viola da gamba had already largely come to an end with Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's early classical period, but the composer nevertheless dedicated three wonderful sonatas to this instrument. The fortepiano, which is used for the accompaniment (and also appears as the obbligato instrument in the Sonata in G minor), was only at the beginning of its great development. Bach's sonatas are complemented by two works by his contemporary Carl Friedrich Abel, who is regarded as the last virtuoso of the viola da gamba. The combination of viola da gamba and fortepiano offers a marvellous charm and does justice to the rich nuances of this music between the baroque and classical periods. The sensitive interpretation by Rebeka Ruso and Sebastian Wienand further enhances the appeal of this remarkable music.\n\nLa suave melodia\n\nMichael Oman; Austrian Baroque Company\n\nFra Bernardo FB2401574\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nFounded in 2003 by Austrian recorder player Michael Oman, the Austrian Baroque Company is one of the country's leading early music ensembles. In its founding year, the ensemble recorded instrumental music from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries from the Mediterranean region for the ORF label. On the occasion of the ensemble's twentieth anniversary, the highly acclaimed recording will be re-released on Fra Bernardo.\n\nLiszt: Unrivalled, Volume 2\n\nMichael Kaykov, piano\n\nOdradek Records ODRCD455\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nAmerican pianist and academic Michael Kaykov follows his first Odradek release, Liszt: Unrivalled, with Unrivalled Volume 2, an album devoted to the composer's extraordinary late piano works. Underestimated at the time, Liszt's late piano works are increasingly recognised as masterpieces of innovation, pushing the boundaries of tonality and style with a radical daring that paved the way for modernism. Each work on this album is an illustration of these remarkable developments. Highlights include the Csardas macabre which features empty sequences of fifths, almost minimalist rhythmic repetitions and chromatic undulations of pared- back melodic lines. The Impromptu, S 191 lives up to the spontaneity of its name, while the last four of the nineteen Hungarian Rhapsodies were composed some thirty years after the first fifteen and have a completely different character, epitomising Liszt's ascetic late style. The Funeral Prelude and Funeral March are pervaded with chromaticism, dissonant harmonies, augmented intervals and tonal ambiguity, while brevity and simplicity characterise the Mephisto Polka. The Bagatelle sans tonalite, with its extreme chromaticism and dissolution of functional harmony, heralds a new musical epoch beyond the Romantic era with which Liszt is most often associated. Michael Kaykov approaches this magnificent repertoire with sensitivity, nuance and breath-taking skill.\n\nLibertad - The Will to Freedom\n\nMaria Cecilia Munoz, Tiffany Butt\n\nArs Produktion ARS38338 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nWhen selecting the works for this recording, Tiffany Butt and Maria Cecilia Munoz looked at different eras to understand the impact that oppression and lack of freedom had on the creative process. They were not so much interested in what people were unable to do due to restrictive situations and adverse circumstances, but above all in what they achieved despite these circumstances. During their research, they came across impressive artistic personalities who have left behind music of great value.\n\nJoel-Francois Durand: Geister\n\nKairos Records KAI0022200\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThis double album with compositions from the last two decades offers an insight into the diverse musical soundscape of Joel-Francois Durand. From Mirror Land (2005) to Geister, schwebende Geister... (2020), Durand's work shows a unique development characterised by his use of microtonality. The poetic dialogues of the Fernando Pessoa-inspired Quatuor a cordes No 2: Cantar de Amigo (2020) and Durand's ongoing exploration of microtonal spaces in La descente de l'ange (2022) reveal a dynamic and transformative universe of this extraordinary composer. Performers on this recording: Szilard Benes, Mivos Quartet, Olivia De Prato, Ensemble Dal Niente, Michael Lewanski, Victor Lowrie Tafoya, Quatuor Bozzini, Constance Volk and Katherine Jimoh.\n\nWind Quintets - Francaix, Hindemith, Ibert, Taffanel\n\nSyrinx Quintet\n\nMDG MDG10223162\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThe individual instruments merge with a rarely heard homogeneity to create an\n\nensemble sound that is unrivalled. When the composer Jean Francaix heard this recording he congratulated them with a handwritten letter: 'The recording of my quintet is excellent. In a way, you have captured my musical thoughts exactly in photographic form: There can be no greater compliment from an author. Not to mention your technique, which is marvellous.' A speciality of the Syrinx Quintet was their absolute fusion of sounds and extreme virtuosity. In the final movement of the Francaix quintet it is almost impossible to discern whether the clarinet or the flute is leading the virtuoso alternation of the ornaments. Similarly, the horn and bassoon sometimes form an almost indistinguishable tonal unity.\n\nProkofiev: Piano Sonatas, Vol II\n\nDavid Jalbert, piano\n\nATMA Classique ACD22462\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nCanadian pianist David Jalbert returns with the much-anticipated second volume (Nos\n\n5 to 7) of Prokofiev's complete piano sonatas. Released in 2021, Volume I\n\nreceived widespread critical acclaim. A virtuoso with a warm, elegant style and a wide-ranging repertoire, pianist David Jalbert has established himself among the elite of a new generation of classical musicians. Named by the CBC among the fifteen best Canadian pianists of all time, Jalbert performs regularly as a soloist and recitalist around the world. As a soloist, Jalbert has performed with Yannick Nezet-Seguin, Skitch Henderson, Bramwell Tovey and others. An accomplished chamber musician, he has collaborated with such artists as Nicola Benedetti, Rachel Barton Pine, Bomsori and Jean-Philippe Collard. A national and international prize-winner, David Jalbert has won six Opus Awards, was nominated five times at the Juno Awards and was the 2007 laureate of the prestigious Virginia Parker Prize awarded by the Canada Council for the Arts.\n\nHistoires de guitares III\n\nDavid Jacques, guitar\n\nATMA Classique ACD22868\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nGuitarist David Jacques returns with the third volume of 'Histoires de guitares' (Guitar Stories), featuring sixteen historical guitars from his private collection, most of them built by the best nineteenth century luthiers. Each guitar is featured in repertoire that suits the instrument's character, and each has a unique story to tell. In the early 1800s, the fruitful collaboration between composers and guitar-makers greatly enabled the instrument's evolution, thanks to a variety of models, materials, and techniques. The guitar was considered the most fashionable instrument of the time, a must-have in nineteenth century music halls and European courts. The rare guitars from Jacques' private collection hail among other cities from Strasbourg, Moscow, Paris, Mirecourt, Cadix and Quebec - the major cities where the finest guitars were crafted for outstanding musicians. Guitarist and lutenist David Jacques has a PhD in early music performance from the Universite de Montreal. His discography consists of fifty-plus recordings on the XXI-21, ATMA Classique, Oz and Analekta labels, several of which have been nominated for ADISQ, Juno, Opus and ECHO Klassik prizes.\n\nSibelius 2 & 5\n\nOrchestre Metropolitain de Montreal / Yannick Nezet-Seguin\n\nATMA Classique ACD22453\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nRecorded at Maison symphonique de Montreal, this new release is part of ATMA Classique's complete cycle of Sibelius symphonies launched in 2019 with Symphony No 1. The two symphonies on this recording are among the best-loved works of Jean Sibelius. Symphony No 2 marks the conclusion of his first stylistic phase. Like many other Finnish patriotic artists around the turn of the century, Sibelius identified as a national Romantic. Symphony No 5, on the other hand, established the foundations of what would become Sibelius' mature style, in which he pushed concentration and austerity to extreme limits. The popularity of these two works has never faltered since they were premiered in Helsinki more than a century ago. Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the Orchestre Metropolitain since 2000, Yannick Nezet-Seguin signed a 'lifelong' commitment with the Orchestre in September 2019.\n\nIn Evening Light: Vasks, Schubert\n\nSebastian Bohren, Sergei Bolkhovets, Munchener Kammerorchester\n\nAvie AV2662\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nSebastian Bohren's first recording of 'In Evening Light', the second violin concerto by Peteris Vasks, comes twenty-five years after the celebrated Latvian composer's first, 'Distant Light', one of the most successful, oft-performed and recorded concertos by a living a composer. 'In Evening Light' - a three-movement, 38-minute work - is beautiful and contemplative, evoking a twilit world immersed in muted colours and permeated with deep shadows and dramatic contrasts. The album ends as it begins, with another atmospheric Vasks work. 'Lonely Angel' is an homage to his late mother who lived through practically the whole of the twentieth century. The composer explains: 'This piece is the vision of an angel flying alone above humankind, filled with grief at how cruel and aggressive we are to each other. Like a guardian angel he touches the earth with his wings and in that way offers us comfort and healing.' Sandwiched in between is the contrasting, classical era Rondo in B minor by Franz Schubert, arranged for violin and strings. Preceding Vasks' works by nearly two centuries, Schubert similarly revels in exploring ambience and spaciousness.\n\nRequiem - Brahms; Mozart; Cherubini\n\nKammerchor Stuttgart, Hofkapelle Stuttgart, Barockorchester Stuttgart, Klassische Philharmonie Stuttgart / Frieder Bernius\n\nCARUS CAR83054 (Box set)\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThree key works of the requiem literature are brought together here: Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem Opus 45, Mozart's Requiem KV 626 and the Requiem in C minor by Luigi Cherubini, which was composed in 1817 for the church funeral service for Louis XVI, who was executed during the French Revolution in 1793. The Stuttgart Chamber Choir, the Hofkapelle Stuttgart, the Klassische Philharmonie Stuttgart and the Stuttgart Baroque Orchestra will perform under the direction of Frieder Bernius. The soloists are Julia Borchert, Vasiljka Jezovsek, Claudia Schubert, Marcus Ullmann and Michael Volle.\n\nWide as Heaven: A Century of Song by Black American Composers\n\nJames Martin, Lynn Raley\n\nNew World NW80845\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nThis collection of songs represents one hundred years of music produced by American composers and poets of colour. 'Some identify(ied) as African- American, some Black, some men, some women, and some insisted they were beyond classification, adamant that their work speak for itself. Unfortunately, too many of these voices have been stifled from inclusion in our American story thus far. But the time is right, and the fruit is ripe for the picking. The harvest has come in, and the first fruits of the fields yield a bounty of beauty so remarkable that silence is no longer an option. In fact, it is annihilated. Where once the famed halls of old lived on solely in black and white, they are now alive and brimming in technicolor, vividly representative of truth and creative vision - Heaven. The songs collected here are a mere sampling of the finest of those neglected voices. Most are from our published archives. Some have been recorded from transcriptions of sound recordings. Are they \"art\" songs? Are they popular songs? Is it jazz, Bebop, or blues? Is it \"classical\" music? It is music, in all cases. Music to be enjoyed and reflected upon. Performed with integrity and informed enthusiasm by all who would approach it. Resist the urge to classify and segregate. Enjoy the creativity and savor the sounds of words and music dancing together as one in each singular work of art.' - James Martin\n\n19 APRIL 2024\n\nMagnolia\n\nAleksander Dębicz\n\nWarner Classics\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nPolish pianist-composer Aleksander Dębicz releases his sixth album, Magnolia, consisting of eleven original compositions featuring guest soloists such as Jakub Józef Orliński, Łukasz Kuropaczewsk, Marcin Zdunik, Michał Ża and Konrad Gołd. Using modern post-production techniques as an integral part of his compositional approach (eg using multi-layering to turn Jakub Józef Orliński's solo voice into a full vocal ensemble), Dębicz explores the full potential of his roles as pianist, composer and producer.\n\nChristopher Cerrone: Beaufort Scales\n\nLorelei Ensemble\n\nCold Blue Music\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nThis highly anticipated album presents Cerrone's lush, alluring music for treble voices and electronics, a piece that carries with it a cautionary tale for our era of accelerating climate change. The primary text for this album is drawn from the Beaufort Wind Force Scale (a measure of wind speed, originally as it related to observed sea conditions) created by Francis Beaufort in 1805. Interspersed among the thirteen sung movements are narrated interludes featuring four texts taken from the writings of Herman Melville, F Scott Fitzgerald, Anne Carson, and the King James Bible. Each of these comments on the state of weather at a particular point in time, serving as a pause and a moment to reflect upon the surrounding movements.\n\nStephen Dodgson (1924-2013) Mirage. Piano Music by Stephen Dodgson\n\nOsman Tack, piano\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD 0684\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nFeaturing twenty-four first recordings, Mirage is the third volume in a series marking the tenth anniversary of Dodgson's death in 2013, and celebrates a composer of 'urbane and civilised' music, as Robert Matthew-Walker describes it in his informative booklet notes. The recital spans seven decades from 1956's Eight Fanciful Pieces - 'a judiciously varied suite ... bound by the directness of utterance that so distinguished Dodgson's music' - to the Six Bagatelles composed between 1998 and 2005 when 'his inspiration burned brightly in his eighties'. Also included are the 'vastly impressive' Piano Sonata No 7 (Dodgson's last) from 2003; the 'significant' Three Impromptus (1962, revised 1985), and the varied, impressionistic Four Moods of the Wind Suite (1968). A bonus track, the Rondo in A flat from 1953, will be available for downloading on digital platforms. Osma Tack is a former Chandos Young Musician of the Year who has performed throughout the UK and internationally as a soloist, accompanist and chamber musician (having won the Pro-Corda Festival competition).\n\nFranz Schmidt (1874-1939) The Book with Seven Seals; Symphony No 4\n\nJulius Patzak, tenor (John); Otto Wiener, bass (Voice of the Lord); Hanny Steffek, soprano; Hertha Töpper, alto; Erich Majkut, tenor; Frederick Guthrie, bass (solo quartet); Franz Illenberger, organ; Graz Cathedral Choir; Munich Philharmonic Orchestra / Anton Lippe; Vienna Symphony Orchestra / Rudolf Moralt\n\nSOMM Recordings ARIADNE 5026-2 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nSOMM Recordings honours Franz Schmidt, one of the great symphonic composers of the twentieth century, on the 150th anniversary of his birth with this double-disc set featuring two of his masterworks. Revered in his day in his native Austria as the nation's leading composer and an elite teacher, cellist and pianist, his name will not be known to many. This is due, at least in part, to a perceived association with the Third Reich (against which there is ample evidence). This first release on CD of two premiere recordings, meticulously produced and restored by Lani Spahr, showcases Schmidt's unique harmonic language, exceptional contrapuntal skill and mastery of form, qualities which prompted Hans Pfitzner to call Schmidt's Symphony No 4 'nearer perfection than Bruckner, more honest than Richard Strauss and more original than Reger'. Born in Pressburg (Bratislava) in 1874, Schmidt's teachers (piano) included his mother (herself a student of Liszt), Rudolf Mader, Ludwig Burger and Theodor Leschetizky; (cello) Karl Udel and Ferdinand Hellmesberger; and (theory) Felicián Moczik and Robert Fuchs. He was, for a time, principal cellist in the Vienna Philharmonic under Mahler. While his symphonic output is clearly in the structural mould of Schubert, Brahms and Bruckner, his harmonic language, while showing influences of Strauss, Mahler and early Schoenberg, is clearly his own. A near fatal heart attack in the years following the success of his Fourth Symphony prompted the composer to put his efforts into a major religious work. His setting of eight chapters of the last book of the New Testament in Martin Luther's German became The Book with Seven Seals (From the Revelation of St John the Divine), not through-composed but constructed of clearly defined sections in the great nineteenth-century oratorio tradition. The success of this summum opus and his stature in Austria drew the attention of the Nazis, who commissioned Schmidt to write a cantata on partisan texts (which he abandoned, only for it to be completed by a student and nevertheless performed under Schmidt's name). With the fading of this unfortunate association a growing number of prominent conductors - Järvis, Welser-Möst, Luisi, Bychkov - have begun to revive performances of his music in our time.\n\nThe Songs of Thomas Pitfield\n\nJames Gilchrist, tenor; Nathan Williamson, piano\n\nDivine Art DDX 21119\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nAn album of songs by Thomas Pitfield, a remarkable English composer, artist, craftsman and poet whose catalogue boasts over 150 songs from a lifetime of creativity and dedication. This carefully chosen selection of songs is elegantly presented in a volume adorned with his own captivating artwork. The collection stands as a testament to Pitfield's legacy with evocative interpretations of his songs. A new book, 'Endless Fascination: The Life and Work of Thomas Pitfield, Composer, Artist, Craftsman, Poet', edited by Rosemary Firman and John Turner, will be published by Forsyths, Manchester, UK in May 2024.\n\nThe Kreutzer Effect: Edward Cowie\n\nThe Kreutzer Quartet\n\nMétier MEX 77103\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nConsidered one of the most influential composers inspired by the natural world, Edward Cowie's collaboration with the exceptional Kreutzer String Quartet spans nearly a decade. Now, Cowie presents his seventh string quartet 'Western Australia', specially crafted for the Kreutzer Quartet, accompanied by four solo portrait pieces dedicated to each member. From the ethereal heights of Clifton Harrison's viola to the intricate melodies inspired by the habits of owls for Neil Heyde's cello, Cowie's compositions reflect a profound reverence for both the human animal and the natural world.\n\n12 Preludes & Fugues for Solo Piano: David Johnson\n\nChristopher Guild, piano\n\nDivine Art DDX 21124\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nDavid Charles Johnson was a Scottish composer and a scholar of eighteenth-century Scottish music, his research focusing on the music and social life of lowland Scotland during the eighteenth century. Johnson's 12 Preludes and Fugues are among the few significant pieces he composed for the piano. Written in the early to mid 1990s these compositions are notable for their unique blend of sound, reminiscent of twentieth century composers like Hindemith or Prokofiev, while incorporating elements such as quotations from Bach and references to Hugh MacDiarmid's work. They also feature direct quotations of popular tunes like 'Johnny Cope' and 'The Animals Went Marching Two by Two', infused with a distinct Scottish flavour. The Preludes and Fugues are performed by Scottish pianist Christopher Guild.\n\nLes ombres du Fantôme: Robert Sholl & Justin Paterson\n\nRobert Sholl, organ; Anna McCready, soprano; Andy Visser, saxophone and bass clarinet; Justin Paterson, electronics\n\nMétier MEX 77105\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\n'Les ombres du Fantôme' presents a captivating exploration of Gaston Leroux's timeless novel Le Fantôme de l'Opéra (1910) through fourteen evocative improvisations, composed (planned and formulated) by Robert Sholl and Justin Paterson. Recorded in July 2021 using the majestic organs of Coventry and Arundel Cathedrals, accompanied by soprano voice and saxophone/bass clarinet, these improvisations delve deep into the narrative, themes, characters, and events of Leroux's masterpiece. Robert Sholl is a distinguished educator and scholar and Justin Paterson is a respected teacher of Music Production.\n\nWind Concertos by Roger Reynolds\n\nJacqueline Leclair, oboe; Kerstin Thiele, flute; Esbjerg Ensemble / Mathias Reumert\n\nEkkozone Records Ekkozone04\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nWith three upcoming albums, Ekkozone Records celebrates the work of the trailblazing American composer Roger Reynolds and his collaboration with Danish musician and producer Mathias Reumert. The first album in the series, Wind Concertos, features the first recording of Reynolds' oboe concerto, JOURNEY, combined with his landmark electroacoustic flute concerto, Transfigured Wind III. JOURNEY was written for the pre-eminent modern oboist Jacqueline Leclair, who is featured as soloist on the recording.\n\nThe Italian Album\n\nVerita Baroque Ensemble\n\nEPR-CLASSIC EPRC0058\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nThe tracks on this album, including the first recording of a commissioned work by Nicola Canzano, were recorded in four different baroque castles. This baroque repertoire is played on historical instruments and recorded in the halls for which it was originally composed, creating an authentic atmosphere. The album is an innovative collaboration with scientists, engineers, filmmakers and marketers using innovative recording and mixing techniques. The album was made in 360* and mixed to create a rich immersive sound experience. Following their debut album, The German Album, the ensemble presents the second album of the series: The Italian Album. Featuring a repertoire of baroque compositions by Corelli, Vivaldi, Albinoni and Galuppi, Verita invites listeners on a captivating journey through time. The album is once again concluded by a specially commissioned neo-baroque piece from one of their composers in residence, Nicola Canzano.\n\nPolish Sounds Vol 2 - Works for Wind Orchestra by Grzegorz Duchnowski\n\nWarsaw Wind Orchestra / Miroslaw Kordowski\n\nDux Recording Producers DUX1968\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nGrzegorz Duchnowski dedicates his compositional output largely to wind instruments, in various configurations, making an important contribution to the Polish repertoire for wind orchestras. Wind orchestras have a rich tradition in Poland, and the pieces contain many references to Polish folk music; patriotic tones can be found here too. However, there are also numerous harmonies, sounds and rhythms reminiscent of jazz big bands or even heroic motifs from film music. It is light music, colourful, full of different moods, in which wind instruments perfectly harmonize with the extensive percussion section. The musicians, also associated with the Sinfonia Varsovia orchestra and other leading Warsaw ensembles, present an incredible cooperation, a wide range of dynamics, colours and articulation, thus showing the full potential of this unusual instrumentation.\n\nSchutz - A German in Venice\n\nDavid de Winter, tenor; The Brook Street Band\n\nFirst Hand Records FHR145\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nOne of the key German composers before Bach with more than five hundred surviving individual pieces, Heinrich Schutz wrote mainly church music, and is credited with bringing the Italian style to Germany and continuing its evolution from the Renaissance into the early Baroque. Although he lived most of his long life in Germany, in his twenties Schutz made two visits to Venice. The first was between 1609 and 1613 when he was taught by Giovanni Gabrieli; and the second in the late 1620s to meet and possibly study under Monteverdi. The two trips greatly influenced Schutz's music as he absorbed and began to combine the ornate and theatrical Venetian style with the more understated Lutheran tradition in which he grew up. This album explores his solo cantatas alongside examples of the brilliant and virtuosic Venetian style instrumental music.\n\nC F Abel: The Drexel Manuscript\n\nKrzysztof Firlus\n\nDux Recording Producers DUX2027\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nThe album contains a compilation of works by Carl Friedrich Abel, a composer living in the times of the Bach family, forgotten for two centuries. His manuscripts, saved by the Drexel family - English philanthropists, culture lovers and artists - include both musically excellent and complex compositions. The richness of the dynamic and articulation contrasts sometimes brings to mind Mozart's early symphonies, but sometimes it also takes the listener back to the world of sound solutions from before the Baroque era. The composer used the potential of the viola da gamba to the fullest. Krzysztof Firlus is a versatile musician, gambist and double bassist, a virtuoso working as a chamber musician with the best ensembles; he is also associated with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra. He plays a contemporary copy of the violone (provided with an additional seventh string) with an unusual virtuoso flair and a seductive musical narrative, thanks to which the compositions intended for a solo instrument seem to be played by a larger ensemble, and the music keeps the listener in suspense all the time.\n\nJohn Zorn - The Hermetic Organ Volume 12 - The Bosch Requiem\n\nTzadik CDTZA9307\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nRecorded at the Grote Kerk in Den Bosch as part of Zorn's seventieth birthday celebration at November Music in Den Bosch, this exciting performance pays tribute to one of Zorn's seminal influences - the fifteenth century painter Hieronymus Bosch. Performing on two different organs simultaneously, running from one to the other, this is one of the most bizarre installments in the entire Hermetic Organ series. The CD begins with a rare private performance of Zorn alone in the church exploring and stretching the organ's capabilities. For the evening performance, A Pilgrimage Through Hell, Zorn's dear friend and colleague of over thirty years, John Medeski, joins as his organ assistant, and the two of them literally pull out all the stops!\n\nMichael Zev Gordon: The Impermanence of Things\n\nNMC Recordings NMCD277\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nMichael Zev Gordon is a composer whose music is deeply engaged with the subjects of memory and loss. These themes are central to the three large-scale works which comprise this new portrait album, named The Impermanence of Things. The album opens with a seven-movement orchestral work performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jukka Pekka Saraste, which explores our awareness of the passing of time. Time pushes on, time pulls back, before seeming to stand still completely as we journey towards the end of the work. The final movement shares its name with the overall title Bohortha which is a tiny village lying at the end of a remote Cornish peninsula, an evocative symbol of open-endedness. If Bohortha consists of many small, contrasting fragments, the Violin Concerto is constructed more conventionally, with both the work's structure and expressive character being influenced by early exploratory sessions with the soloist, Carolin Widmann. Gordon has commented that he was inspired by 'just how many nuances of singing she could bring to her instrument: intense and open, strained and fragile'. Lyrical melodies collide with dissonant clusters in this recording by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales conducted by Catherine Larsen-Maguire. Conventions are again turned on their head in The Impermanence of Things for piano (Huw Watkins), ensemble (London Sinfonietta) and electronics. Rather than playing the traditional soloist role, the piano instead acts as a linchpin, around which thirteen short movements revolve. Throughout the work, a constant tension between forward and backward, reveals an ultimate yearning for stillness in the present.\n\nBach: Goldberg Variations\n\nWalter Feybli, guitar\n\nArs Produktion ARS38650\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nIn his arrangement of the Goldberg Variations, guitarist Walter Feybli has endeavoured to stay as close as possible to the original and to combine the pieces harmoniously. He has deliberately chosen those variations whose character is reminiscent of suite movements and which sound as natural on the guitar as if they were originally intended to be played on the piano.\n\nMozart: Horn Concertos\n\nSibylle Mahni, horn; Brandenburger Symphoniker / Andreas Spering\n\nProspero Classical PROSP0083\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his horn concertos for Joseph Leitgeb (1732-1811), a good friend of the family who was often the target of Mozart's crude humour. They were written during his time as a freelance composer in Vienna and today form an essential part of the concert repertoire for horn. Here they are interpreted by Sibylle Mahni, Professor of Horn at the Hanns Eisler School of Music Berlin, and the Brandenburg Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Andreas Spering in a rousing, emotional and, above all, 'historically informed' performance.\n\nProyecto Clarin - 17th Century Spanish Music for Trumpet & Organ\n\nHenry Moderlak; Joan Boronat Sanz; Clara Brunet; Ute Hartwich; Olivier Mourauld; Reto Baumann\n\nProspero Classical PROSP0080\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\ntrumpeter Henry Moderlak has put together an extraordinary and particularly appealing album. He is accompanied on the 'Queen of Instruments' by Joan Boronat Sanz. In some of the pieces, the trumpet line-up is extended by three more baroque trumpets and magnificently complemented by timpani.\n\nElisabeth Harnik: someone will remember us\n\nBruno Strobl, PHACE, Ensemble Kontrapunkte, Ensemble Zeitfluss, Edo Micic, Judith Ramerstorfer, Trio EIS, Mathilde Hoursiangou, Ensemble NeuRaum, Jaap Blonk, Cantando Admont, Cordula Burgi, Nacho de Paz\n\nKairos Records KAI0022026\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\n'Since the nineties, Elisabeth Harnik's work as an artist has been characterised by two aspects: improvisation and composition. For Harnik, these two activities, which are usually treated as entirely separate entities in music, are two sides of the same coin. This already becomes evident in her improvisational playing, in which she frequently works with piano preparations and extended playing techniques. Exploring, juxtaposing, merging and fusing sounds, she marks out different paths through the soundscape. In doing so, starting from a feminist perspective, she establishes new lines of tradition, often dedicating her works to female artists who represent role models or milestones in her creative work.' - Susanne Kogler\n\nIja Mia - Music of the Sephardic Diaspora\n\nEast of the River, directed by Nina Stern and Daphna Mor\n\nAvie AV2665\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nDirected by Daphna Mor and Nina Stern, this album is inspired by love and commemoration of the musicians' collective cultural backgrounds - Nina's Venetian Jewish ancestry and Daphna's Ladino heritage. Spanning a vast range of Sephardic folk and traditional musics - stories and dances, prayers and anthems - Ija Mia is by turns haunting, soulful and exuberant. Daphna and Nina's cosmopolitan collaborators include an astonishing assortment of musicians including renowned Armenian-American oud player Ara Dinkjian, Silk Road percussionist Shane Shanahan, the phenomenal Israeli bassist Tal Mashiach and Palestinian multi-instrumentalist Zafer Tawil on qanun, violin and percussion.\n\nDolente Partita: Madonne e Maddalena - works by Monteverdi and his contemporaries\n\nPia Davila; Bernhard Reichel; Ensemble Musica getutscht\n\nCoviello Classics COV92310\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\nSoprano Pia Davila and the ensemble Musica getutscht under the direction of Bernhard Reichel show how Claudio Monteverdi and his contemporaries transferred the modern dramatic style from secular opera to sacred music during the Counter-Reformation. For example, they told the Passion of Christ in a completely new way - namely from the personal perspective of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Both lament the painful parting from Jesus, not only as their savior, but above all as their son and lover.\n\nSea of Stars\n\nLauren Scott\n\nAvie AV2675\n\nRelease: 19 April 2024\n\n'Scintillating ... the act of light hitting a many faceted object, sparks flying or the execution of something with panache and brilliance.
