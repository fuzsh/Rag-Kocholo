Through this we argue that augmenting linguistic analysis with philosophical perspectives develops and supports CDA scholarship more broadly by accommodating the shifting complexity of social problems of ideologically driven inequality that are inbuilt through, in our case, social policy texts. In discussing philosophical-methodological issues, the paper argues for the need to continually adapt CDA to the particular data so as to remain sensitive to and avoid hegemonic tendencies in analysis. Through adopting the principles of a working methodology, we discuss a micro-meso-macro CDA framework that draws on the analytical concepts of movement, metaphorical superfluidity, thematic condensation, and surrealism to conceive of a research approach capable of examining and comprehending evolving discourses of political economies. The most immediate benefit of this framework is its capacity to illustrate how forms of valuations perpetuated by and through policy discourse are the motivational locus of meaning making insofar as they strongly inform the moral underpinning the ideology of economic growth.\n\nThis paper examines the way the metaphor of diversity provides a moral basis for inequality in Singapore’s meritocratic education system.

Based upon a collection of policy texts from 2002 to 2012, our analysis illustrates that the metaphor of diversity in policy texts provides ways for systemic discrimination within the education system and that this inequality is given legitimacy as necessary through various moral discourses. The paper employs a critical discourse analysis that draws upon the relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values to highlight the ways in which an argument for inequality permeates policy from within a frame of meritocracy, and to analyse how changes associated with new modes of value determination serve to legitimize inequality.\n\n1. The article questions and challenges the official meritocratic principle of ‘equal opportunities’ (Wong, 2000) in Singapore's education system. Drawing on Foucault's and Nietzsche's philosophical perspectives, there is an explicit illustration through an in-depth analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in policy report/speech.\n\n2. Discourse builds in/tangible structures in society and greatly determines the possibilities of the now. As such, I am also arguing that it would be more difficult to 'help' any 'community' if the structural discrimination which has been deeply embedded, is not made explicit through national policies, and by this I mean an explicit illustration through an in-depth policy analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in Singapore's education policies. It may be through this that discriminatory structures could be substantially challenged.\n\nAn initial analysis of the original 1979 policy on primary school streaming which I conducted illustrates how dichotomous (arbitrary) categorization of pupils, i.e. 'slow' and 'fast' learners legitimates and sustains increasing institutional/structural access (over the years terms like 'talents' have been employed in policy discourse), of who gets privileged knowledge access. Through this, I also ask then to what ends do forms of 'categorization' or conventional designation entail? By this, given that categorization legitimizes structural access, my question is, what is 'Malay/Muslim community' and how is this categorization necessary?\n\n3. Even though the analysis in the article was based on Singapore's education system, it provides possible ways of understanding how inequality is continuously being inbuilt through policies on the basis of the ideology that economic growth is the (only) way forward. A way to critique this ideology is to expose its underlying assumptions. I believe the findings have much resonance with the widening inequality across many developed nations, as Singapore's policies have parallels with that of the U.K., U.S., and international organizations such as the World Bank.\n\n4. Economically considered, the transliteration of meritocratic discourse into the metaphor of diversity pinpoints how the appeal of development for all necessarily also demands the advance of inequity for the sake of the whole, i.e. advancing the 'growth with inequity' principle.\n\n5. The analysis highlights that value judgments are continually at work in the policy discourse and that despite the strong discourse of meritocracy that the Singapore education system promotes, it is argued that it is in the interests of the Singapore people that 'talents' should get privileged access to knowledge as it is through this that more 'opportunities' for the rest of the population are created. The findings demonstrate that although the underlying assumptions of this 'logic' that has been constructed in policies are unsubstantiated, the logic is continuously legitimated through forms of e/valuations.\n\nThis article has been featured in websites such as: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150428105815.htm\n\nhttp://www.eurasiareview.com/28042015-what-is-value-of-inequality-within-singapores-education-system/\n\nThe following review explores Intercultural Information Ethics (IIE) in terms of comparative philosophy, supporting IIE as the most relevant and significant development of the field of Information Ethics (IE).

The focus of the review is threefold. First, it will review the core presumption of the field of IIE, that being the demand for an inter- mission in the pursuit of a founding philosophy for IE in order to first address the philosophical biases of IE by western philosophy. Second, a history of the various philosophical streams of IIE will be outlined, including its literature and pioneering contributors. Lastly, a new synthesis of comparative philosophies in IIE will be offered, looking towards a future evolution of the field. Examining the interchange between contemporary information ethicists regarding the discipline of IIE, the review first outlines the previously established presumptions of the field of IIE that posit the need for an IE as grounded in western sensibilities. The author then addresses the implications of the foregoing presumption from several non-western viewpoints, arguing that IIE does in fact find roots in non-western philosophies as established in the concluding synthesis of western and eastern philosophical traditions.\n\nIn this paper I put forward and substantiate a possible defensive move on behalf of the relativist about predicates of personal taste that can be used to block a recent contextualist argument raised against the view: the ‘argument from... more\n\nIn this paper I put forward and substantiate a possible defensive move on behalf of the relativist about predicates of personal taste that can be used to block a recent contextualist argument raised against the view: the ‘argument from binding’ proposed in Schaffer (2011). The move consists in adopting Recanati’s (2002, 2004) ‘variadic functions’ apparatus and applying it to predicates of personal taste like ‘tasty’ and experiencer phrases like ‘for John’. I substantiate the account in a basic relativistic framework and reply to several objections to the variadic functions approach in general and to its application to the expressions at hand.\n\nDebates about the semantics and pragmatics of predicates of personal taste (PPT) have largely centered on contextualist and relativist proposals.

In this paper, I argue in favor of an alternative, absolutist analysis of PPT. Theorists such as Max Kölbel and Peter Lasersohn have argued that we should dismiss absolutism (also called realism or invariantism) due to its inability to accommodate the possibility of faultless disagreement involving PPT. My aim in the paper is to show how the absolutist can in fact accommodate this possibility by drawing on an account of faultless disagreement that improves upon a recent proposal due to Karl Schafer. In amending Schafer's proposal, I put forward an empirically-informed view of our beliefs regarding matters of personal taste, as well as an account of our assertions concerning such matters. I also argue that absolutists should take disagreement about these matters to be conative, rather than doxastic, in nature. The anticipated result is an independently compelling account of faultless disagreement about matters of personal taste that fits naturally with absolutism.\n\nWe define \"absolute truth\", like \"absolutely a priori truth\" of H.

Putnam, as a proposition (statement) which is true in every epistemically possible world, namely, true no matter how the world turns out (epistemically) to be. We have yet to know whether there are such absolute truth(s) or not. In this paper, we try to propose, only as a program of course, an argument for the existence of an absolute truth. Our argument utilizes the logical structure of \"the modal ontological argument\" for the existence of God. Using this logical structure, we can enable what cannot have been done by any types of so called \"refutation of relativism\": to deduce the necessity (or actuality) of the existence of the absolute truth from the possibility of the existence of the absolute truth.\n\nSusan Haack, “Professor Twardowski and the Relativist Menace,” Filozofia Nauki, XIX.4(76), 2011: 25-33.

Twardoski’s arguments that there are no relative truths fail. First: not only are these arguments not exhaustive, but they also rely on unjustified assumptions about truth-bearers and about the individuation of judgments and concepts. Second: they are covertly based on the false assumption that relativism is a single, simple thesis; when in fact (as I showed in 1996 in “Reflections on Relativism”) it is a whole, unruly family of theses—some but not all of which are indefensible. Moreover, third: while an adequate epistemology does indeed require a robust concept of truth, what “robust” means here is not simply “non-relative”: while, as I showed in 1993 in Evidence and Inquiry, conceptions of truth as relative to community, culture, theory, etc., will impede epistemology, Tarski’s conception of truth as relative to language would not; and sometimes, as in the hands of a Stich or a Rorty, non-relativist conceptions will be as serious an impediment as (some) relativist conceptions.\n\nKey words: truth, truths, truth-bearers, relativism, epistemology, Twardowski\n\nIf God’s omniscience entails knowing all things, including those that did not occur yet, how is it possible that humans act freely?

This very much discussed old question had a sudden revival with Nelson Pike’s paper fifty years ago. In this paper we provide an analysis of the argument for “theological fatalism” under the light of some assumptions about the structure of time and the semantics of tensed sentences.\n\nWe present, in particular, Prior-Thomason semantics for indeterminist time (second section). This semantics motivates the distinction between time of evaluation and perspective which, we argue, is required for the definition of an appropriate truth-predicate in the context of tensed discourse. Third section shows how the previous language and semantics can be used to formalise the argument for theological fatalism. The argument turns out to be valid and we argue that the only way left for a compatibilist solution makes essential use of the distinction between time of evaluation and perspective which was independently motivated in the previous section. We included an appendix with precise definitions and some examples. The first section explains the argument for theological fatalism.\n\nABSTRACT: Two decades ago, there was a great flurry of work on the subject of truth, which subsequently set much of the agenda for future debates.

Interest in the subject of truth remains unabated at all levels of inquiry, both within philosophy and from without, in both academic and popular guises. But while truth continues to be of focal interest, it seems that there have been remarkably fewer new directions since then. New Waves in Truth offers eighteen new and original research papers on truth and other alethic phenomena by twenty of the most promising young scholars working on truth today. Contributions to the volume span truth ascriptions, deflationism, realism and the correspondence theory, the value of truth, and kinds of truth and truth-apt discourse. The research programs of the contributors are beginning to reset that agenda, and each is positioned to make new waves throughout the subject."
