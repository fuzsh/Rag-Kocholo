This paper is a continuation of that endeavor. The word 'Buddhadhamma' is multivalent. It means the state of nature, the laws of nature, and the teaching and practice of the Buddha as an exposition of the laws of nature especially in relation to the problem of human suffering. The purpose of my endeavor is correspondingly multivalent. I have found that taking Buddhadhamma seriously as a foundation for a theory of language and the human situation in general leads to a deep understanding of language and the human situation in general. And it leads to insight into the role of language in the cause and the cure of the problem of human suffering, and insight into a radically different view of the state of nature. I have elaborated the Buddhist theory of language and its implications in previous publications. I have argued to frame a point of view that is different from and at odds with most of the academic research on Buddhism. I do not take the point of view of Buddhology, which begins with the premises of conventional sociology or anthropology or psychology and studies Buddhism as a cultural, social, psychological historical phenomenon. It takes Buddhism as an object of study from a presupposed point of view that is essentially antithetical to Buddhism. I take Buddhism as a point of view from which to engage in a scientific study of conventional society, including sociology, anthropology and psychology, as well as linguistics. I take a simple‐minded scientific‐empirical point of view wherein I take the Buddhist point of view as a scientific framework and try to figure out if or how or how much it helps to understand and explain the world, especially language and the human situation. The essence of the Buddha's teaching is that normal conventional human life is played out in a realm of chronic suffering, that this suffering is caused by our persistence in holding beliefs contrary to the laws of nature, i.e. false beliefs, and that it is possible to escape from this realm of suffering by realizing truth and releasing our habitual investment in falsity. I have argued that language is integral to the machinery of this habitual persistence in holding to false beliefs, and thus integral to the persistence of human suffering. Further, I have argued that language itself, its pragmatics, its semantics, its formal structure, is a function of the dynamics of truth and falsity. Therefore, in order to understand Buddhadhamma, to understand the Buddhist theory of language, to understand the role of language in the dynamics of this chronic human suffering, and thus to escape from it, we must delve into the nature of truth and falsity as the fundamental ground of Buddhadhamma and the Buddhist theory of language. Looking at it from another angle, even if one were to put aside my framing of the study of truth and falsity in term of language and the suffering endemic to the human condition, it seems obvious on the level of ordinary everyday life that it is important to understand the nature of truth and falsity. It is obvious that if we build on false premises, whatever we build will fail. For example, if we invest our money in a fraudulent business enterprise, we will suffer the loss of our money. If we invest our time and energy in a false personal relationship, we will suffer one way or another. On the basis of these kinds or ordinary examples we can assume everyone knows that it is important to sort out truth and falsity. And what is more, everyone actually tries to sort out truth and falsity almost constantly in everyday life. As we listen to others talk, we are constantly checking for consistency and coherence, comparing what the speaker is saying with what he had previously said, with what we know to be true, with other standards of verisimilitude, in order to try to detect falsity and sort out truth. Therefore it is important as a practical matter even from a common sense point of view, to become skillful in sorting out truth and falsity. And thus, simply on the basis of ordinary everyday practicality, it is important to understand the nature of truth and falsity. So the purpose of this paper is to present some basic observations on the nature of truth and falsity, to frame the beginning of a systematic exploration of the nature of truth and falsity."
