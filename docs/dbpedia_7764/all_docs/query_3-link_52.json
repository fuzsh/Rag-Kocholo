        "text": "Wines from Alsace are labeled by grape, not place, which makes them unique among top quality AOC (appellation origine controllée) French wines. The French label all other top-quality AOC wines by place name—where the grapes grown—Chablis, Bordeaux, Sancerre, Pouilly-Fuissé—to name just four of the hundreds of names. Alsace, by contrast, uses varietal labeling, grape names—Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Noir—nomenclature that we Americans are familiar with and understand.\n\nThis labeling, along with the high quality of the wines, should make Alsace wines extremely popular in the U.S. Retailers, however, tell me that these wines, inexplicably, do not fly off the shelves. Consumers wonder whether the wines will be sweet or dry, which is a reasonable question since many Alsace wines come in both styles. The traditional, tall, sloped green bottle doesn’t help because some consumers mistake them for German wines, which have a reputation for sweetness. The bottle shape, unsurprisingly, is a matter of economics. Historically, German and Alsace wines were shipped via boat on the Rhine, which meant the bottle did not need to be as sturdy as those shipped over land. As a result, these bottles didn’t need a punt (the depression in the base) that strengthens them, allowing them to be packed more tightly.\n\nI attended a tasting of Alsace wines in New York this past spring that included a stunning array of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir wines, two varieties that are often overlooked. Accounting for only about 12 percent of the region’s plantings, it’s easy to see why Pinot Noir is overlooked. Much of what is planted goes into sparkling Crémant d’Alsace Rosé, which must be made exclusively from that variety. So, it’s not surprising there’s not a lot of it on retailers’ shelves. While I found, predictably, many stunning examples of racy Riesling, Alsace’s most important grape, it was Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir that surprised me the most. And, I might add, at very good prices. These two varieties reinforce my advice to consumers: It is time to overcome any apprehension about Alsace wines and step up for Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir.\n\nAlthough the wines are labeled by variety, growers in Alsace, like growers all over France, know that some sites have the potential to produce better wines than others. In the 1970s, French wine regulators finally got around to identifying 51 top sites in Alsace based on terroir and awarded them Grand Cru status. These sites have the potential to produce even more noteworthy wines but represent only about three percent of Alsace production. But let me assure you, there are plenty of non-Grand Cru wines from Alsace worthy of your attention. Moreover, consumers will not see Grand Cru on any bottle of Pinot Blanc and on only a rare Pinot Noir grown in just three vineyards, Kirchberg de Barr, Hengst, and most recently, Vorbourg (and even then starting only with the 2022 vintage). Only Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris, and Muscat can carry the Grand Cru moniker. Other varieties are thought not to be “noble” enough. The initial exclusion of Pinot Noir was, as so many things are, all about politics, not about quality. Antoine Schutz from Domaine Ruhlmann-Schutz explains that to get the Burgundians to accept a Grand Cru classification system in Alsace, they had to agree not to allow any Pinot Noir to carry that designation!\n\nThe soils in Alsace are varied due to the pre-historic collapse of a land mass that extended from the Vosges mountains through Germany’s Black Forest. The resulting vineyards and the jumble of soils that include limestone and granite lie on the slopes of the Vosges mountains and cascade down to the Rhine River Valley and explain why a variety of styles of wine exist.\n\nPinot Noir grown on granite “helps with acidity,” according to Marine Claude, from Domaine Kirrenbourg, whose fragrant and exciting 2021 Cuvée Mathieu is striking evidence that Alsace can produce stellar Pinot Noir. She explains that the acidity imparted by the granite soil helps offset the loss due to climate change. She continues, “Heat (from climate change) gives us the maturity we lacked. Thanks to global warming we can make better wine.” She emphasizes that, “We want to produce according to our terroir. The point is not to look like Burgundy.” Her explanation squares with my experience. Decades ago, Pinot Noir from Alsace was—more often than not—light and conspicuously lacking in density. Now, growers get good ripeness and complexity while preserving Pinot Noir’s delicate aromas and finesse.\n\nLike Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc has seen a transformation recently from light and innocuous wines to ones with good density and vivacity. It’s not clear to me whether the change is a result of a warming climate or modifications growers are making. In any case, Pinot Blanc has gone from a wine to ignore to a wine to embrace.\n\nPinot Blanc, a less aromatic variety compared to Riesling or Gewürztraminer, typically still has a delicate and alluring floral aspect. While light and fresh, the best have subtle nuances of stone fruit buttressed by lively acidity. Wines labeled Pinot Blanc can contain a related grape, Auxerrois, which growers like because it ripens early, which means it avoids being ruined by fall rains. In the blend, it adds substance while moderating Pinot Blanc’s acidity.\n\nOn to recommendations.\n\nThere’s a bounty of good Pinot Blanc wines from the marvelous 2022 vintage. Domaine Barmès-Buecher’s vibrant (certified biodynamic) 2022 Pinot Blanc “Rosenberg” exemplifies the balance of subtle pear-like flavors with enlivening, but not screeching, acidity. It could easily serve double duty as a stand-alone aperitif or to accompany grilled fish (91 points, $36).\n\nDomaine Josmeyer’s cheery 2022 Pinot Blanc “Mise du Printemps,” also a certified biodynamic wine, may be lighter in weight but not in enjoyment and will certainly cut through summer’s heat and humidity. (92 pts., $27). Josmeyer, always one of my favorite producers, also bottled a stunning 2020 Auxerrois “H” Vieilles Vignes whose weight and stone-y complexity reflects its bottle age and inclusion of grapes from old vines (93 pts., $50).\n\nLéon Beyer’s floral and fresh 2022 Pinot Blanc, planted on a clay limestone soil, delivers a touch of attractive bitterness in its lengthy finish. It’s a serious wine that makes you reconsider any preconceived notions of innocuous Pinot Blanc (93 pts., $26).\n\nMeyer Fonné opts to include Auxerrois and a touch of Pinot Gris is their pretty and packed 2022 Pinot Blanc. Weighing in at less than 13 percent stated alcohol, it delivers amazing depth without heaviness, all supported and amplified by cutting acidity. It punches far above its price (93 pts., $25).\n\nSpeaking of punching above price, Domaine Specht’s elegant 2022 Pinot Blanc dances on the palate, delivering a bright mouthful of minerals and subtle stone fruits at a modest 12 percent stated alcohol. Fine as an aperitif, it has sufficient weight to hold up to all but the most flavorful seafood (92 pts., $19).\n\nTurning to Pinot Noir:\n\nAlthough the Pinot Noir grapes came from Grand Cru vineyards, the stunning 2021 Domaine Kirrenbourg “Cuvée Mathieu,” won’t carry that accolade on the label until the 2022 vintage because of the aforementioned regulations. Grand Cru may not be on the label, but it’s certainly in the bottle of this fragrant and layered beauty. This biodynamic beauty combines power and finesse (95 pts., $68).\n\nTrimbach, one the region’s best and most well-known producers, unsurprisingly, excels with their stylish 2021 Pinot Noir Réserve. They achieve a seamless and harmonious mix of bright red fruit accented by savory notes, all enrobed in fine tannins. This light and elegant Pinot Noir would be a good choice for grilled salmon this summer (92 pts., $32).\n\nFrom vines that are between 35 and 50 years old and planted on granite soil, Domaine Hurst fashion a lush 2022 Pinot Noir “Vieilles Vignes.” Subtle savory elements offset the ripe red and black fruit flavors in this biodynamically made wine. A suave texture means you can enjoy this mid-weight this summer (92 pts., $34).\n\nDomaine Barmès-Buecher’s lively 2022 Pinot Noir Réserve is the real deal. Fragrant with an impeccable combination of bright red fruit and spicy savory nuances, the biodynamically-made wine sings. Aging on the lees for about a year in old (10-15 year) oak barrels enhances its appeal without introducing any interfering woody notes (94 pts., $42).\n\nThe finesse-filled 2020 Pinot Noir Réserve from Meyer Fonné shows how a couple of years of bottle age enriches Alsace Pinot Noir. A delicate, but not vapid, impression of red cherries melds with earthy elements in this well-balanced beauty. A suave texture permits enjoyment without further aging (92 pts., $34).\n\nIf you run across the enticingly fragrant 2021 Pinot Noir “Les Jardins” from Domaine Ostertag, grab it. An array of bright red fruit mingles with savory spices. Succulent but not heavy, it captures the oft too elusive “flavor without weight” of great Pinot Noir. Its silky texture allows you to serve it with grilled salmon this summer or a hearty roast chicken and mushroom sauce this fall (95 pts., $42).\n\nMade from organic grapes and weighing in at a modest 12 percent stated alcohol, the lithe Domaines Schlumberger 2021 Pinot Noir “Les Princes Abbés” dances on the palate. Like the head of Janus, it displays both the aromatic red fruitiness and leafy nuances, the hallmark of fine Pinot Noir (92 pts., $28).\n\nAfter 30 years, the still fresh 1993 Pinot Noir “F” from Domaine Paul Blanck shows how well Alsace Pinot Noir can develop. Subtle, but alluring, savory notes predominate in this gracefully framed wine. A touch of fine tannins provides just the right amount of structure to this long and herb-laden wine without intruding (94 pts., price n/a).\n\n* * *\n\nE-mail me your thoughts about Alsace wines in general or Alsace Pinot Blanc and Alsace Pinot Noir in specific at [email protected] and follow me on Twitter and Instagram @MichaelApstein\n\nAugust 14, 2024\n\nMy friends say that I hate rosé. I don’t. I just think there are many far more interesting alternatives. (Here, we’re talking about still wine, not rosé Champagne, which is heavenly.) Most rosé is innocuous. “I’ll have a glass of rosé,” has replaced “I’ll have a glass of Chardonnay” as shorthand for “I want a glass of wine—I don’t need to know anything else about it.” That’s its problem for me. When I drink wine, I want complexity. I want a little intrigue or surprise. I want to think about what I’m putting in my mouth. Sure, I want a zippy wine that refreshes, especially in the heat of summer. Chilling light reds and many vibrant whites provide both refreshment and character, something I find lacking in most rosé wines. So, having just spent 10-days on a family vacation in Provence where we drank not a drop of rosé, allows me to offer alternatives to enjoy this summer. All of them are refreshing and bright. None are heavy or ponderous.\n\nMy suggestions below can serve as aperitif-type wines that can be enjoyed by themselves but have enough pizzaz to stand up to and cut through even hearty summertime fare.\n\nLet’s start with the whites.\n\nIn my decades of drinking white wine, there has been no bigger change in character—for the better—than the white wines from the Rhône Valley. They’ve become far livelier. Certainly, that’s true for wines from the well-known Côtes du Rhône appellation. But that’s also true for two appellations that often fly under readers’ radar, the Luberon and the Ventoux, that are included under the Rhône Valley umbrella, despite being located geographically in Provence. In addition, look for whites from Costières de Nîmes and the relatively new appellation, Duché d’Uzès.\n\nUnexpectedly, given climate change, the white wines from these Rhône appellations have gotten brighter and fresher, aspects that balance their alluring stone fruit and aromatic nuances. I don’t know whether producers have modified their blends, slightly increasing the proportion of varieties that contribute acidity or whether in response to warming climate they are harvesting earlier, which is another way to preserve acidity. Or maybe something else is at work. In any case, look for wines from these appellations for summertime drinking.\n\nThe blend of grapes that may be included in these Rhône Valley wines can be staggering—this is not a one-horse show—and helps explain the allure of the wines. I’ve listed the blends in the wines I single out below, so that readers can appreciate the diversity of grapes that growers use. And note how many come from organic grapes or vineyards that are farmed biodynamically, a real trend in the Rhône.\n\nAdditionally, for those who want to drink interesting wines this summer without breaking the bank (and who among us doesn’t?) look to the Rhône Valley. None of the recommended wines should cost more than $25 retail.\n\nAs you’ll see, some of the wines I’ve recommended are not yet be available in the U.S. In those instances, I’ve listed what winesearcher.com calls a “worldwide” price just to give consumers an idea of what the wines might cost in the U.S. Even those that are imported may not be in national distribution, so they may be available only in limited markets. If you cannot find these wines, search WRO’s database by appellation for other recommendations, or ask your retailer for other wines from these appellations.\n\nThere’s a trio of appellations—Côte du Rhône, Côtes du Rhone-Villages, and Côtes du Rhône-Villages appended with a named village—that offer particularly good value. There are about 20 villages, two of which are Visan and Saint Maurice, that have the potential of making more distinctive wines. They are entitled to link their name to the Côtes du Rhone-Villages appellation. Over time, some of these villages will be “promoted” to Cru status on a level with Gigondas, Vacqueryas, and Châteauneuf du Pape, as authorities realize the elevated quality of the wines. That means that many of them, such as Domaine La Florane’s Visan or their Saint Maurice, punch above their weight class already. The really good news is that the price of these wines has not caught up with their quality—yet.\n\nDomaine La Florane’s energetic 2023 Côtes du Rhône-Villages Visan “À Fleur” is a perfect example. This mid-weight lively white—a blend of biodynamically-farmed Marsanne, Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Bourboulenc, Picpoul and Clairette—refreshes as a stand-alone aperitif while having sufficient oomph to cut through hearty Mediterranean fare on the table. A delicate and alluring hint of bitterness in the finish reinforces its stature. (94 points, $19 for the 2022)\n\nThe vibrant 2023 white Côtes du Rhône “La Solitude” from Famille Lançon, who makes delicious and noteworthy Châteauneuf du Pape, delivers subtle stone fruit richness buttressed by wonderfully refreshing acidity. It has good weight without being heavy. A blend of Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, and Clairette (93 pts., $18)\n\nThough most wines labeled Côtes du Rhône hail from the southern part of the Rhône Valley, some, such as one from Stephane Ogier, a top Côte Rôtie producer, can come from the northern part of the Valley, near his Côte Rôtie base. Ogier’s vibrant white 2022 “Le Temps est Venu” delivers minerals, a hint of stone fruit flavors, and riveting acidity. (93 pts., NA in U.S., Worldwide price $12)\n\nI couldn’t believe the price of the bright and fresh 2022 Mas des Bressades’ “Tradition” bottling from the Costières de Nîmes, a small appellation on the west side of the Rhône River. The blend of the usual suspects—Roussanne, Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, and Viognier—delivers unusual depth, impeccably balanced, by uplifting vibrancy. Stock up! (93 pts., $13)\n\nThe Duché d’Uzès appellation, barely a decade old, also lies on the western bank of the Rhône, about an hour west of Avignon. It mandates the usual array of Mediterranean grapes for its reds and whites. Organically grown Viognier and Grenache Blanc imbue the floral and fresh 2021 Domaine Deleuze-Rochetin’s “Harmattan” with impeccable balance. It delivers depth without heaviness. (91 pts., NA in U.S., Worldwide price $13)\n\nDomaine de la Citadelle’s 2021 lively white, “Les Arètems,” from the Luberon and made with organic grapes, delivers nuances of stone fruit while remaining fresh and zippy even with a few years of age under its belt. A blend of Clairette, Rolle, Roussane, and Marsanne. (90 pts., NA in U.S., Worldwide price $17)\n\nDomaine de la Pousterle’s charming 2020 “Cuvée Isabelle” from the Luberon uses Grenache Blanc and Vermentino (a.k.a. Rolle) from their oldest vines to make a racy white with delicate stone fruit character amplified by an uplifting hint of bitter almonds in finish. (90 pts., $24)\n\nNow, on to the reds.\n\nDo not overlook light red wines for summer’s drinking pleasure. Many red wines should not be fully chilled because lowering the temperature can accentuate the tannins, making them bitter. So, for summertime drinking, avoid the sturdy Syrah-based wines from the north, such as Hermitage and Côte Rôtie. Save those for the chill of fall or the snows of winter. Embrace chillable reds, those with mild or no tannins, which is precisely why reds sporting the Côtes du Rhône appellation fit the bill. Herbal notes complement their fruitiness without a dense tannic structure. Good acidity keeps them fresh and lively. In a word, they’re perfect for chilling this summer to accompany most anything coming off the grill.\n\nDomaine de la Mordorée, a fully organic and biodynamically farmed estate located in Lirac (another appellation on the Rhône’s western bank) makes a fabulous array of wines. Their splendid and racy Côtes du Rhône 2021, a blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Cinsault, is a delight to drink now. Fresh and spicy, it has a healthy dose of what I like to call, “not just fruit” character that actually amplifies its fresh strawberry-like flavors. (94 pts., $23)\n\nI was so taken with Domaine La Florane’s white Côte du Rhône-Villages Visan (above) that I ordered their wines whenever I saw them on a wine list. Domaine La Florane’s mid-weight 2022 Côte du Rhône-Villages Saint Maurice is a good choice for chilling because of its mild tannic structure, even though as a named village higher on the hierarchy of appellations. Though slightly more substantial than those labeled simply Côtes du Rhône, its marvelous balance of red fruit and spice without a trace of heaviness makes it easy to love. It would be an excellent match for grilled leg of lamb or other hearty grilled meats this summer. (93 pts., $25)\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Chapoutier, a leading and top producer in the Rhône Valley, makes a delicious Côtes du Rhône, labeled “Belleruche.” The supple and chillable 2021 charms you immediately with the right balance of bright red fruit and pepper-like spice. (91pts., $16)\n\nI am very familiar with the fine wines from Les Vignerons d’Estézargues, a small cooperative (10 members at last count) because we rented a house a stone’s throw from their winery for many summers. Their buoyant 2022 Côtes du Rhône, bottled under their Tarapas label, is a delight slightly chilled. A spicy blend of organically grown Grenache, Syrah, Carignan makes it the perfect “pizza wine.” (91 pts., $20)\n\nDomaine La Florane’s lively 2022 Côtes du Rhône “À Fleur” 2022, a light red blend of usual Rhône red grapes—Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, and Carignan—farmed biodynamically, marries bright brambly fruit and mild tannins. Slightly chilled, it’s a perfect choice for this summer’s BBQs. (90 pts., $20)\n\nAnother fine cooperative, Vignerons Laudun Chuslan, bottles an attractive Côtes du Rhône labeled “Enfant Terrible.” With its mild tannins, the bright and zesty 2022 is great chilled. Its price will make many friends. (88 pts., $14)\n\nExpand your summer drinking habits. Trust me, any of these will be more satisfying than most rosés.\n\n* * *\n\nE-mail me at [email protected] and tell me what wines you drink in the summer.

How could it not? With myriad growing plots differing by soil, exposure, and elevation, the Barolo DOCG produces hundreds of different wines, all from the same grape, Nebbiolo. The problem lies in demonstrating the idea of terroir to the average consumer. Here’s the issue. You can open and compare a Barolo made by Vietti from Nebbiolo grown in Serralunga to one made by Mascarello from Nebbiolo in Castiglione Faletto. They will be dramatically different. But is the difference due to the terroir—the difference between the two communes of Serralunga and Castiglione Faletto—or due to the difference in producer’s style and technique? The challenge in identifying terroir, then, is finding and comparing wines made from grapes grown in different sites but made by the same producer. It’s more difficult to do in Barolo, compared to Burgundy, but it can be done, as shown by Stefano Gagliardo, from Poderi Gianni Gagliardo.\n\nEven before Burgundy (or Bourgogne as it is in the native French) received UNESCO World Heritage Site status for its patchwork of vineyards, it was the poster child for terroir. The traditional way Burgundy wines were marketed, by négociants, explains why it was, and remains, the paradigm of terroir. The major négociants, such as Maison Louis Jadot, Maison Louis Latour, and Maison Joseph Drouhin, to name just three, make wines from scores of vineyards and villages from throughout Burgundy. Importantly, they use the same basic winemaking philosophy and techniques for each of the wines. So, the average consumer can descend into their cellars, taste 10 or 20 wines from throughout the entire region, from Santenay in the south to Marsannay in the north and more specifically from vineyards within each village, and immediately see the dramatic differences the sites bring to the wines because the winemaking is a constant. Contrast that to the situation in Barolo. Most of the production there comes from small growers who make and market 3 or 4 wines from individual plots, usually near their wineries and homes, not from throughout the entire region.\n\nPoderi Gianni Gagliardo is different because the house holds vineyards throughout the entire Barolo DOCG, from Monvigliero in Verduno in the very north to Mosconi and Castelletto in Monforte d’ Alba in the extreme south, to Fossati, which spans both Barolo itself and La Morra in the west, to Lazzarito in Serralunga d’Alba in the far eastern section of the DOCG. Stefano emphasizes that the winemaking, barrel treatment and aging is the same from all his wines so that the differences you taste are due to the specifics of the site—the terroir. Tasting through a selection of Gagliardo’s 2020 shows that terroir is alive and well in Barolo.\n\nBy way of advance warning, the wines are stunning, making it hard to pick among them! Do you want to enjoy the relatively delicate Monvigliero now or cellar the more strapping Lazzarito? One of the reasons the wines are so impressive is likely because Stefano bottles only a portion of the wine from the individual crus. He notes, with a smile, “There’s always a special corner” in each cru. He blends the rest into their classic Barolo.\n\nFirst a word about the 2020 vintage in Barolo. It was, unsurprisingly these days, hot, but unlike many hot years, the wines still reflect their origins. The site differences are still clearly etched, not blurred by over-ripe grapes. Some growers attribute the seeming paradox of heat and transparency to the lack of heat spikes during the growing season. Others felt that the lack of water stress usually present in scorching years allowed the grapes to mature continuously without the stopping and starting caused by stress of drought.\n\nWhatever the reasons, Gagliardo’s 2020s are fresh and lively, reflecting their origins in a crystal-clear fashion. For the most part, the Mosconi and Lazzarito excepted, they are forward and amazingly easy to taste, even at this youthful stage, with suave tannins and bright acidity. Don’t let their approachability dissuade you from cellaring them because I’m sure they will take on additional complexity with bottle age thanks to their flawless balance.\n\nStefano and his team regularly travel to Roussillon in France to learn how growers there deal with heat and drought. He explains that changes in the vineyard and in the cellar can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Altering the cover crop between the rows of vines can actually lower the temperature of the vines. Stefano emphasizes that it is critically important to protect the grapes whose tannins can become bitter with exposure to heat and especially to light. So, they will spray the grapes with a white powdery mixture of clay and water that acts like sunscreen. He’s using less aging in the cellar because the grapes are typically riper when they arrive.\n\nWhile Gagliardo’s floral 2020 Barolo from the Monvigliero cru is the most delicate of their cru bottlings, it still delivers substantial weight. A beguiling and distinct mineral-y component balances and enhances its floral nature. Suave tannins lend support without intruding. It’s quite delicious now! ( 93 pts., $220)\n\nStefano emphasizes that the Fossati cru, spanning both the communes of Barolo and La Morra, is a cool site where Nebbiolo never gets overripe. Their stunning 2020 delivers dark red fruit nuances mixed with an appealing floral character. Subtle tarry elements and firm, fine tannins explain why its profile is more substantial than their Monvigliero. Still, it’s a refined wine with great finesse, which makes this beauty enjoyable even at this youthful stage. (96 pts., $180)\n\nThe Castelletto and Mosconi crus, both located in Monforte d’Alba, couldn’t be more different. They are the bookends to the style of that village. Stefano explains that Castelletto lies on the border with Serralunga and that its soil is akin to that of Serralunga, but its exposure, cooler east-facing instead of warmer south/southwest facing, is not. The soil imparts power while the exposure adds restraint and elegance. The breathtaking 2020 Castelletto is truly an iron fist in a velvet glove with a floral start culminating in a panoply of minerals. The tannins in the Castelletto provide a touch more structure compared to those found in Fossati yet are perfectly integrated making the Castelletto agreeable now. (96 pts.; $180)\n\nGagliardo’s muscular 2020 Barolo from what Stefano describes as the warmer Mosconi cru packs the power and weight for which Monforte is known. Although the measured tannins of Castelletto and Mosconi are the same, according to Stefano, their imprints on the wines are strikingly different, giving the Mosconi bottling a far more structured and youthful profile. With time in the glass, the tarry aspect of its minerality emerges. Unlike the Castelletto, this wonderfully youthful Barolo needs far more bottle age to reveal itself. (96 pts., $220)\n\nThe Lazzarito Cru is one of Barolo’s most revered. Both Ian D’Agata and Michele Longo, two experts on Italian wine in general and Barolo in particular, rank it among their top ten Barolo sites. (Barolo fans should not miss their comprehensive and authoritative book, Barolo Terroir: Grapes, Crus, People, Places, 2022.) Stefano explains that he focuses on elegance, not power in all of his wine. Of the 12 owners of Lazzarito, he aims to make his, from his Vigna Preve site that sits high on a ridge, the most elegant and the least powerful of them all. That said, Gagliardo’s majestic 2020 packs plenty of power with an enthralling interplay of tarry minerality intertwined with flowery elements. It’s tightly wound, befitting a young great wine, with exceptionally fine and smooth tannins, which seem to be Gagliardo’s signature. This impeccably balanced youthful Lazzarito has a fine future. I suggest cellaring it for at least a decade. (96 pts., $220)\n\nPoderi Gianni Gagliardo, one of the DOCG’s top producers, shows that the concept of terroir thrives in Barolo. Open their wines and you, too, will find it.\n\n* * *\n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nE-mail me your thoughts about terroir in general or Barolo in particular at [email protected] and follow me on Twitter and Instagram @MichaelApstein.\n\nTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of Trefiano – Tenuta di Capezzana’s stunning take on Carmignano Riserva – a vertical tasting of a handful of vintages ranging from 1988 to 2019 (the current release) was held in Florence this February.\n\nIn preparation for the tasting, I opened a bottle of the 2015 from my own cellar, so I have included my impression of that below, along with the wines from the tasting. Spoiler alert: Trefiano, like other great wines, takes at least a decade to reveal its considerable charms and stature.\n\nCarmignano, the original ‘Super Tuscan’, is the only DOCG that has always required blending Sangiovese with Cabernet, with Sangiovese comprising at least 50% of the blend. Cabernet — either Franc or Sauvignon — must comprise at least 10% but no more than 20%. Today, most producers favour Cabernet Sauvignon over Cabernet Franc.\n\nAlthough Carmignano falls within the greater Chianti area and the same grapes can be used for the wines, Carmignano typically displays more structure, minerality, and savoury features, along with a panoply of red and dark fruit flavours.\n\nOf the 20 or so producers in this small, 116-hectare DOCG, Tenuta di Capezzana – owned by the Contini Bonacossi family – is at the top of the heap. Filippo Contini Bonacossi, who describes his role at the estate as, ‘a little bit of everything,’ explains that their location in front of the Apennines affords them rain in late August, which he says, ‘is precious for elegant wines,’ adding that their ‘microclimate of wind and rain is crucial.’ He emphasises the water-holding ability of the clay in the soil, which has been especially helpful in the last few dry vintages.\n\nWinemakers use their best grapes for Carmignano Riserva, which must be aged for three years before release – a year longer than for Carmignano. With more structure and wood influence, Riservas need more bottle aging to show their grandeur, making them good candidates for the cellar.\n\nVilla di Trefiano\n\nThe grapes for Capezzana’s Trefiano Carmignano Riserva come from a small five-hectare site that surrounds the villa of the same name, built in the 16th century by Florentine aristocrat, Giovanni di Pandolfo Rucellai.\n\nThe Contini Bonacossi family acquired Villa di Trefiano and its vines shortly after purchasing Tenuta di Capezzana in the 1920s. The site includes three distinct parcels: two larger ones, Le Croci and Pietraia; and a smaller one named after the villa itself. Here, all three varieties used for Trefiano are grown: Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo.\n\nFilippo points to the need to continue working on softening Sangiovese’s tannins, whose firmness can be accentuated when the grape is stressed by heat and dryness. He explains that the Cabernet Sauvignon vines originally came from Château Lafite-Rothschild and are a massale selection. With a broad smile he says: ‘Plants know how to evolve, better than we! They have a memory.’\n\nHector Contini Bonacossi, whose mother, Benedetta, is the estate’s winemaker, notes that their Canaiolo is a unique biotype, Canaiolo Rossa Raspo, named because the stalks (raspo, in Italian) are red. It adds colour, and its lower acidity balances and enhances the cherry-like fruitiness of Sangiovese, and they believe it adds elegance to the wine.\n\nHe describes the site as having a, ‘chaotic soil composition, which enhances the different notes in the glass,’ while Beatrice Contini Bonacossi, the commercial face and ambassador of the estate, underlines the uniqueness of the site by describing it as a ‘microclimate within a microclimate.’\n\nTrefiano in the cellar\n\nSince 2008, Trefiano has been farmed organically, and the entire Capezzana estate received organic certification in 2015. Since the varieties ripen at different times, they are fermented separately, always using native yeasts, before being blended.\n\nThe blend is consistent from year to year: 80% Sangiovese, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo each contributing 10%. Ageing occurs in 350-litre tonneaux, equally split between new and one-year-old wood, for around 18 months, depending on the vintage. The average production ranges from 6,000 to 12,000 bottles.\n\nCapezzana opts to bottle Trefiano only in the best years, which means, since its introduction in 1979, they’ve bottled it 28 times – roughly once every three years on average.\n\nAt the tasting\n\nOne of the best lessons learnt from a vertical tasting is to see when the wines enter their window of drinkability, which, of course, is personal and different for everybody. For me, the 2008 Trefiano was drinking beautifully. For many of the others at the tasting it was the 2012 – it’s personal preference.\n\nIn 2019, Beatrice told me that Trefiano was her brother Vittorio’s idea. He had died tragically a year earlier at only 66. To honour him, ‘Vittorio Contini Bonacossi’ appears on the label above ‘Trefiano’. His daughter, Serena told me: ‘The soul of my father is in this wine.’\n\nA taste of Trefiano:\n\nWines are listed oldest to youngest\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 1988\n\nDrinking Window: 2024 – 2026\n\nHaunting and engaging aromas from this brick-hued wine predict greatness – and it doesn’t disappoint! A wondrous and seamless combination of leafy notes of evolution with fresh and dried fruits emerge. A mature wine, to be sure, but a fresh and lively one that actually expands as it sits in the glass. Suave and warming, its silky tannins and bright acidity provide structure to this graceful beauty without a hint of astringency. Glossy, warming and exceptionally long, it’s an extraordinary wine that’s still going strong at 35 years of age (and just 12.8% alcohol). Points: 98\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 1998\n\nDrinking Window: 2024 – 2030\n\nBenedetta took over from her father as winemaker starting with the 1998 vintage. Reflective of a warmer vintage, weighing in at 14.4 % alcohol, this riper and plummier 1998 Trefiano displays fewer savoury and more fruity notes compared to the 1988. Mature nuances are apparent, however, adding complexity, and the texture has the hallmark Capezzana glossiness. Bright and enlivening acidity provides welcome energy and keeps the wine in balance. Points: 91\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 2008\n\nDrinking Window: 2024 – 2040\n\nSubtle smoky notes add allure to the robust and energetic 2008. Youthfully vigorous, it is easy to savour now because the well-integrated, fine tannins give it a silky texture. Hints of both red and black fruits combine with mineral nuances in this bold beauty. Harmonious, lip-smacking acidity amplifies the finish and keeps you coming back for another sip. Points: 96\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 2012\n\nDrinking Window: 2026 – 2045\n\nAt a decade-plus of age, the still-youthful 2012 displays both charm and stature. Its succulent fruit profile dominates at this stage, but the underlying mineral and savoury components emerge as it sits in the glass. Remarkably suave tannins provide structure to this weighty wine without being intrusive. As with the 2008, enlivening acidity on the finish amplifies the wine’s beauty. Points: 94\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 2015\n\nDrinking Window: 2027 – 2045\n\nSavoury notes that emanate from the glass, along with its bricky colour, suggest maturity, but the 2015’s youthfulness is still apparent on the palate. An appealing tarriness complements its cherry-like fruitiness and adds complexity. A hint of bitterness on the finish adds to the appeal of this still-developing wine. Points: 93\n\nCapezzana, Trefiano, Carmignano, Riserva, Tuscany 2019\n\nDrinking Window: 2029 – 2050\n\nFabulous fruity aromatics of red cherries leap from the glass and belie the wine’s tightly coiled structure – but the elegance cannot be hidden, shining through its youthful frame, which supports its concentration. Impeccably balanced, the stunning 2019 has power without going overboard. The 14.5% alcohol is perfectly integrated and not out of place, and its harmony predicts a spectacular development of this quintessential ‘iron fist in a velvet glove’. Points: 96\n\nTasting through hundreds of Chianti Classico wines from the 2020, 2021, and 2022 vintages over two days reminded me why Chianti Classico is, justifiably, so popular around the world. The setting for the tastings was the venerable — and quite enormous — train station in Florence where every year the Consorzio Vino Chianti Classico (the organization that represents producers) presents some 700-plus samples of Chianti Classico spanning several recent vintages and all quality levels. The three vintages — all currently on the market — or in the case of the 2022s, soon to be — are wonderfully individuated and provide something for everyone. The riper 2020s in general reflect the warmer growing season and are fleshier. The sleek 2021s, a product of a year with cooler summer nights that allowed grapes to hold their acidity, are racy, while the charming 2022s, with their youthful vigor and angularity, fall somewhere in-between.\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 Chianti Classico, as a pair of vintages, remind me of the 2015 and 2016 with the former being lusher and the latter fresher and edgier. Drinking — as opposed to tasting — Chianti Classico in restaurants in Florence confirmed just how well they are suited for food.\n\nChianti Classico has three quality tiers, Annata (literally, the year), Riserva, and Gran Selezione, which help the consumer answer the oft asked — and sadly oft unanswered — question: When might the wine be ready to drink?\n\nThe label of the Annata wines will not feature the word Annata, but merely the vintage. These wines have flavor that belies their weight. Although ready to drink upon release, there’s no rush to drink them immediately. I’m still enjoying many Annata from the stellar 2016 vintage. These lively mid-weight reds combine fruitiness and savory notes balanced by mild tannins and bright acidity. Producers generally understand that these wines are not trying to be “important,” so they don’t oversize them, or imbue them with intrusive tannins or oaky flavors from winemaking manipulations.\n\nChianti Classico Riservas are more serious and will always sport Riserva on the label. Winemakers typically select their best grapes for Riservas, which by law, must be aged for an additional year (two compared to one for Annata) before release. As such, the wines destined for the Riserva category, must have more “oomph” to withstand additional barrel aging without being thrown out of balance by the wood influences. They typically need a few years in the bottle to show their complexity and stature.\n\nConsidering that over 300 hundred years ago, Grand Duke Cosimo III de’ Medici shined a spotlight on what is now Chianti Classico with his 1716 bando (proclamation) identifying and codifying the area as a high-quality wine region, (kind of a forerunner of the DOC [Denominazione Origine Controllata] classification), Gran Selezione is a relatively new category, only about a decade old. It was created to highlight the top wines of Chianti Classico. To be labeled Gran Selezione, the wines must come from the producers’ own grapes — no purchased grapes allowed — and must be aged for 30 months, as opposed to two years for the Riservas. Sangiovese must comprise a larger proportion of the blend, 90 percent compared to 80 percent for Riserva and Annata. The label of Gran Selezione will be allowed to identify one of the recently delimited 11 subregions of Chianti Classico (UGAs, Unità Geografica Aggiuntive, literally additional geographic unit) from which the grapes came. Wines in the Gran Selezione category should enrobe all the power and charms of Riservas in a silky, suave texture. Think cashmere rather than lambswool. The Gran Selezione are typically more elegant and complex, with more subtleties, but not necessarily more power than the Riservas. That said, like Riservas, Gran Selezione need additional bottle aging to blossom, so they too are good candidates for cellaring.\n\nRemember, Chianti Classico is itself a sub-zone of the greater Chianti region, which encompasses a large area surrounding Florence and Siena in Tuscany. It’s the most widely recognized sub-zone thanks to the Galo Nero or Black Rooster logo that appears on the neck of each bottle. (For completeness, the other seven are Chianti Rùfina, Chianti Colli Senesi, Chianti Colli Fiorentini, Chianti Montalbano, Chianti Colli Aretini, Chianti Montespertoli, and Chianti Colline Pisane.)\n\nA word about UGAs. The push in Chianti Classico, as with all fine wine regions, is towards greater specificity in identifying the source of grapes. Enter the UGAs, eleven sub-regions within Chianti Classico whose basic environment—terroir, to use the French concept — imparts a uniqueness or identity to the wines. Or so the theory goes.\n\nThe problem in Chianti Classico is that, apart from Lamole and Montefioralle, each UGA is large and has an enormous diversity of soil, elevation, and exposures that makes it difficult to define the character of each. Add to that, the tremendous impact of the producers’ style of winemaking can overwhelm the distinctiveness of a UGA, even if there is one. That said, the UGAs, in general, can give consumers additional information about the style of the wines — racier wines from the cooler, higher altitude Lamole are different from the riper ones coming from sun-drenched Panzano. For completeness and because consumers will start to see the names on labels, the eleven UGAs are: San Casciano, Greve, Montefioralle, San Donato in Poggio, Panzano, Lamole, Radda, Castellina, Gaiole, Vagliagli, and Castelnuovo Berardenga.\n\nIronically, although the Consorzio of Chianti Classico is adamant, as they should be, about emphasizing the Classico portion of the name and reminding even journalists who should know better, not to abbreviate Chianti Classico to Chianti, even many restaurants in Florence don’t make the distinction. On more than one restaurant’s wine list Chianti Classico, Chianti Rufina, and just plain Chianti were all lumped together. So, Reader, my advice is to learn about the sub-zones and UGAs, but most importantly remember my mantra: producer, producer, producer.\n\nThat said, here are some specific recommendations:\n\nFrom the 2020 vintage, I Fabbri’s fresh and lively “Terra di Lamole” delivers a firmer style of Chianti Classico with an impeccable balance of dark cherry-like fruitiness and minerality. (92 points; $28). In the same vein, the incredibly long 2020 Chianti Classico from Azienda Storica Castellinuzza, owned by the Cinuzzi family since the 1400s, conveys a touch of fresh red cherry-like notes to accompany its firm stoney texture. (91 Points; $25). The suave 2020 from Badia a Coltibuono is ideal with a simply grilled steak. (91 Points; $24).\n\nThese two widely available Chianti Classico Riservas from the 2020 vintage are entering their drinking window. The gorgeous Principe Corsini-Villa Le Corti, “Cortevecchia” Chianti Classico Riserva combines a bit of fruitiness, herbal nuances and minerality into a mid-weight and graceful frame. (94 Points; $36). The denser and more robust Querciabella 2020 Chianti Classico Riserva impresses with suave tannins and a long and refined finish (94 Points, $48).\n\nNow let’s turn to the 2021 Annata. Bright acidity balances the riper style coming from the 2021 Castello di Radda Chianti Classico. A captivating earthy savory aspect just expands its appeal (93 Points; $25).\n\nFattoria le Masse’s sleek and poised 2021 Chianti Classico, made exclusively from Sangiovese, shows the stature of that grape in the right hands. Elegant and refined, le Masse’s needs a few years to unwind, so find a space in your cellar for this annata (95 Points; $45).\n\nFontodi excelled with two 2021s. Their savory Chianti Classico conveys a dark cherry-like power without heaviness (93 Points, $45), while Fontodi’s spellbinding Chianti Classico Filetta di Lamole — certainly one of the standouts of the vintage — provides a multidimensional excitement coupled with finesse. It reminds us that a great wine need not be heavy and overwhelming (96 Points; $41).\n\nThe ever-consistent Isole e Olena produced an alluring 2021 Chianti Classico redolent of darker fruit and a captivating hint of tar (94 Points, $35). Although all these 2021s will improve with time in the bottle, especially le Masse’s, they still provide enormous enjoyment now.\n\nSimilarly, I was struck by how beautifully the 2021 Chianti Classico Riservas were showing. They, like the 2021 Annata releases, will improve with more bottle age, but they deliver plenty of pleasure now.\n\nAs always, the gorgeous aromatics of the harmonious 2021 Castellare de Castellina Chianti Classico Riserva predicted delights to follow. And they did. Savory, fruity, and nuanced, it is the epitome of a Riserva (94 Points; $34). As an aside, I’ve already seen the more straightforward 2022 Castellare de Castellina Annata on retailer’s shelves. Bright and balanced, it’s a delight for current drinking (92 Points, $26).\n\nWith fine tannins, the lush and suave 2021 Castello di Volpaia Chianti Classico Riserva would be a joy to match with a grilled steak this summer (93 Points, $46).\n\nAnd don’t overlook the graceful 2021 Riecine Chianti Classico Riserva lest you miss this mid-weight marvel of spice and fruit wrapped in fine unobtrusive tannins (93 Points, $50).\n\nA quartet of 2019 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione shows the heights that wines from this DOCG can reach. Despite of, or perhaps because of, its mid-weight size, the 2019 I Fabbri Chianti Classico Gran Selezione commands a presence. It’s delicious now (95 Points, $59).\n\nThe suave and stunning 2019 Gran Selezione of Lamole di Lamole comes from the single vineyard, Vigneto di Campolungo and is another mid-weight beauty that wows you with grace and refinement rather than shear power (95 Points, $50).\n\nThe captivating 2019 Gran Selezione from Monteraponi dazzles with a darker fruit profile and a hint of minerals wrapped in glossy tannins (96 Points; price n/a).\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, Querciabella’s 2019 Gran Selezione bursts from the glass, combining power and refinement (96 Points; $260 for the 2018).\n\nThe above recommendations represent only a smattering of the hundreds of notable Chianti Classico from these three vintages. I could have easily listed a hundred more. So, my advice is to dive in and explore for yourself the differences between the lusher 2020s and the racier 2021s and then see how they compare to the 2022s when they become more available. And answer the question for yourself: Do the Riserva and Gran Selezione give you more enjoyment than the Annata, considering their higher price?\n\nA recent advertisement from one of New York’s top wine retailers, Flatiron Wines & Spirits, reminds readers of the ridiculously affordable pricing for Chianti Classico: Principe Corsini-Villa Le Corti 2016 or 2021, both gorgeous vintages, for all of $24 each.\n\nAnd at Gordon’s Wines and Liquors outside of Boston, Volpaia’s racy and sleek 2021 Chianti Classico goes for $20 — with no sales tax!\n\n* * *\n\nE-mail me your thoughts about Chianti Classico at [email protected] and follow me on Twitter and Instagram @MichaelApstein.\n\nLet me get straight to the point. The 2019 vintage for Brunello di Montalcino is fabulous! I make this assessment after tasting 35-plus examples of the recently bottled and released wines in New York City in November. There wasn’t a loser in the bunch. Sure, I preferred some over others, but overall, the consistency and quality were outstanding. The high stated alcohols, some even up to 16 percent, might make you think the wines would be heavy and hot. Surprisingly, they are not. By and large, the alcohol does not show in these wines. The 2019 Brunellos are a balanced delight of dark fruit and minerals with needed, but unobtrusive, structure. I would rank the vintage on a par with 2010 and 2016, two other spectacular vintages. So, if you missed Brunellos from those years, now is your chance to make up for it.\n\nIndeed, if I were younger and buying young red wines to cellar, the 2019 Brunello would be high on my list. Mind you, the 2019 Brunellos, like other great wines, will need cellaring to allow their beauty and complexity to shine. I just had a bottle of the 2010 Il Poggione Brunello with a lamb ragu pasta. At 13 years of age, it’s barely entering its drinking window. The rather riper character of the 2019s suggests they may be enjoyable sooner, but I’d still plan on giving them a decade before pulling their corks.\n\nThe weather during the growing season and harvest makes or breaks a vintage. And the weather in the Montalcino in 2019 was perfect, according to Mark Guillaudeu, MS, who led a seminar in New York in November on behalf of the Consorzio di Montalcino, the organization that represents the growers and producers of that DOCG. Producers to whom I have spoken uniformly echo Guillaudeu’s description that it was “an easy vintage for winemakers.” Lots of rain in May provided ample water for the vines throughout the growing season. Normally disease accompanies wet weather, though luckily, May of 2019 was cool, so mildew and other humidity-enhanced problems did not take hold.\n\nA dry summer without heat spikes allowed for slow and even ripening. The harvest took place under mostly sunny skies with only occasional light rain, so waterlogging the grapes just before harvest was not a problem. Guillaudeu felt that the evenness of the heat was responsible for the smooth tannins. Whatever the explanation, the 2019 Brunello wines, as a group, displayed a glossy, suave texture, making them easy to taste even at this young age.\n\nWithout question, Brunello di Montalcino is one of Italy’s greatest wines. Regulators, realizing its stature, bestowed the first DOCG designation on Brunello di Montalcino in 1980. It, and Rosso di Montalcino, its made-to-be-drunk-earlier baby brother, are the only DOCGs that require the exclusive use of Sangiovese. Regulations also require five years of aging, two of which must be in barrel, before release, which explains why the 2019s will be hitting the market early in 2024.\n\nDespite its small area—only about 5,000 acres under vine—roughly one-tenth the size of Napa Valley’s plantings, the heterogeneity of the region is enormous, which makes describing a style of Brunello difficult. A hill rising some 1,500 feet above sea level dominates the DOCG area, so the elevation of the vineyards is one element that creates diversity. Add to that, the different exposures created by all sides of the hill. And third, the geologic mix of the soils is extraordinary. The reason for the diversity of soils is beyond the scope of this article, but in her timeless book Kerin O’Keefe, a leading expert on Brunello, explains it succinctly, “the celebrated hill was formed in different geologic eras” (Kerin O’Keefe, Brunello di Montalcino, University of California Press, 2012). So, like other of the world’s truly great wine areas, Brunello is not one wine, but many wines—a key to why it’s such an exciting DOCG.\n\nSome experts broadly refer to the character of the wines from the four slopes of the hill while others, such as O’Keefe, describe seven subzones. She argues that defining subzones is “crucial to the future of Brunello,” but admits that realistically it’s likely not going to happen any time soon—simply because many producers feel it would only create more confusion and a marketing nightmare. While I find the generalizations regarding the slope and subzones helpful, the gorilla in the room remains the style imparted by the individual producer. So, while everyone pretty much agrees that the southern part of Montalcino, with its more Mediterranean climate, is home to riper grapes and richer wines, vast differences between producers can trump that generalization. For example, Col d’Orcia and Castello Banfi are located less than three miles from one another in the southern Sant’Angelo Scalo zone, but Col d’Orcia’s elegant profile is far different from the richer and more powerful Brunello wines coming from Banfi.\n\nThe baby gorilla in the room is knowing the origin of the grapes. A producer may well own vineyards in zones apart from the location of its home and winery and blend the grapes. Tenute Silvio Nardi, one of my favorite producers, is located in the cool, frost-prone northwest slope of the DOCG, but one of their most important vineyards, Vigneto Manachiara, lies far away in the south while another one, Vigneto Poggio Doria, does, in fact, lie in the northwest. In addition to making stunning single vineyard Brunellos from each of these vineyards, their regular or main production Brunello bottling is a blend from at least those two zones. So, knowing Nardi’s location does not really tell you anything about the style of their basic Brunello. Tasting Nardi’s two single vineyard Brunello side-by-side does, however, show the dramatic and important differences between the zones.\n\nSimilarly, Val di Suga’s three single vineyard Brunello, made from its 125-plus acres of vineyards spread over three distinct zones, provides an equally convincing argument for identifying zones. Val di Suga’s vineyards are divided roughly in thirds: In the north where their winery and prized Vigna del Lago lies, in the southwest side, the location of its equally prized Vigna Spuntali, and in the southeast part, where their third esteemed vineyard, Poggio al Granchio is located. The contrast between the richer Spuntali, the tightly wound Vigna del Lago, and the minerally Poggio al Granchio is illuminating and proves, once again, the importance of zones when speaking of Brunello.\n\nIn this instance, the consumer would be correct in identifying Val di Suga’s fragrant, elegant, and firm style and assume it’s a function of the estate’s location north of Montalcino. But that assumption would be incorrect because Val di Suga’s basic Brunello (which is not really “basic” at all) comes from a blend of grapes from diverse locales. So, in this instance, the location of the estate predicts the style of the wine, but for the wrong reasons. It’s Val di Suga’s talent in winemaking and blending—not the location of the vineyards—that accounts for its style.\n\nSo, my advice (unsurprisingly to those who know me) is producer, producer, producer. With the 2019 Brunello, select your favorite producers and buy as much as your budget allows. Here are a dozen or so, in no particular order, that caught my eye. Where prices are not available for the 2019 vintage, I have listed the most recent price from Wine-Searcher just to give readers an approximation.\n\nThe fragrant Cortonesi “La Mannella” (which, by the way, is the name of the estate, not a single vineyard) is what you’d predict from a northern locale, elegant and perfumed with supporting by not intrusive tannins. (95 pts., $50 for the 2018.)\n\nThe similarly perfumed Piaggone, a single vineyard bottling from, Salicutti, delivers great savory elements that accent its dark fruit quality. (95 pts., $110 for the 2018.)\n\nArgiano, whose vineyards hail from warmer, southern Montalcino, shows the riper, plusher side of the DOCG without going over the top. Amazing elegance for its size. (95 pts., $78.)\n\nCol d’Orcia, though located barely 3 miles from Argiano, delivers a vastly differently styled Brunello and, once again, reinforces my mantra of producer, producer, producer. Their elegant and stylish 2019 displays a presence without shouting. (95 pts., $60.) Speaking of Col d’Orcia, their spectacular 2016 single vineyard Brunello Riserva, Poggio al Vento, was included in the recent New York tasting. I’ve had this wine several times in the past and this tasting just reinforced my impression. It’s fabulous! My advice—buy it if you can find it and afford it. (97 pts., $180.) It still needs at least a decade more of cellaring.\n\nThe floral and gorgeous Canalicchio di Sopra wows with its elegance and impresses with its stature. (96 pts., $116 for the 2018.) Even more stunning is their single vineyard, Vigna Montosoli, from one of Montalcino’s most revered sites. It shows more power without losing any finesse. (97 pts., $201 for the 2018.)\n\nSimilarly, Silvio Nardi’s striking single vineyard, Poggio Doria, dazzles with its silky suave texture and power. (97 pts., $170 for the 2017.)\n\nThe floral and fleshy Il Poggione, from the area’s southeastern sector, is powerful yet not overdone. (94 pts., $80.)\n\nThe stunning 2019 trio from Val di Suga, the lush Spuntali, (93 pts., $113 for the 2018), the floral Vigna del Lago (93 pts., $103 for the 2018), and the firm and elegant Poggio al Granchio (93 pts., $92 for the 2018), are a perfect way to explore the zones of Brunello.\n\nBright enlivening acidity and firm tannins offset the richer profile of La Gerla nicely. (93 pts., $75 for the 2018.)\n\nFrom a high altitude, 1,400 feet above sea level, the roughly 5-acre Vignavecchia vineyard is San Polo’s flagship Brunello. Perfumed and classically proportioned with firm, not hard, tannins, the Vignavecchia displays a riveting complexity. (95 pts., $303 for the 2016.)\n\nSo, there you have it. In short, lay down the 2019 Brunellos if you have the funds to buy them and space to cellar them.\n\n* * *\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nEmail me your thoughts about Brunello di Montalcino at [email protected] and follow me on Twitter and Instagram @MichaelApstein\n\nLong-regarded as one of Burgundy’s more muscular appellations, the 2022 vintage from Domaine Parent reveal Pommard’s more refined and sensuous side.\n\nThe wines of Pommard have long suffered from a less-exalted reputation compared to the more delicate wines of neighbouring Volnay, just to the south.\n\nThey are often considered burly and chunky compared to the lacey wines of Volnay. The different character, which indeed is a powerful and persuasive argument for terroir, comes, in large measure, from Pommard’s position lower on the slope where more iron-tinged clay, which imparts power to the wine, has accumulated over the millennia compared to the more limestone rich soil higher up on the slope of Volnay.\n\nBut, if you are one of those who feels that the wines of Pommard should take a backseat to those of Volnay, then I suggest you try Domaine Parent’s dazzling array of 2022s, or any year for that matter, because the combination of power and elegance that Anne Parent imbues in the wines will convert you immediately.\n\nTwelve generations\n\nThough Domaine Parent was created in 1803, the family’s presence in Burgundy dates to the 17th century, making sisters Anne and Catherine Parent the 12th generation of the family involved in wine.\n\nAnne and Catherine took over from their father Jacques, who ran the domaine from 1947 until 1988. Anne is responsible for the viticulture and winemaking, while Catherine runs the commercial side of the operation.\n\nThe domaine comprises 10 hectare (about 25 acres) mostly in Pommard along with two important Corton Grand Cru parcels from which she makes a stunning white Corton and an equally impressive red Corton Renardes.\n\nAnne buys grapes, often from family members, and makes wines, technically as a négociant, and bottles them under the ‘Jacques Parent et Cie label’ (Jacques started the négociant side of the business in the mid-1970s.)\n\nThe meticulousness that Anne puts into the domaine wines is readily apparent in these négociant bottlings. To explore just how well Anne’s négociant bottlings evolve, I recently pulled a bottle of the 1990 Pommard Les Rugiens from my cellar.\n\nParent does not own any vines in Rugiens but obtains grapes from friends who do. The suave 1990, at 34 years, has developed magnificently, with silky tannins enrobing an iron-tinged core of dark fruit. Vibrant and fresh, it combines power and elegance. To paraphrase Robert Frost, it has miles to go before it sleeps.\n\nConsistent terroir expression\n\nA hallmark of Parent’s wines, be they domaine or négociant – in addition to their superb quality – is their consistency and dazzling transparency. Having only two winemakers, Jacques and Anne Parent, for the last 70 years helps explain the consistency.\n\nTo learn about the subtle and not so subtle variations of terroir within Pommard, just taste Parent’s array. Each reflects the locale, the distinctiveness of the vineyard, from village wine to premier cru. Despite decades of lobbying, the authorities have yet to promote Les Epenots or Les Rugiens (the two generally accepted top premier crus) to grand cru.\n\nWhen the sisters took over, Anne embraced organic viticulture, attaining Ecocert organic certification over a decade ago, in 2013.\n\nShe employs biodynamic practices, such as ploughing the premier and grand cru vineyards with horses and bottling the wines according to the lunar calendar, and is awaiting Demeter certification.\n\nThe grapes are harvested entirely by hand. Once back at the winery in the center of Pommard, the grapes pass over a vibrating sorting table and then a stationary sorting table where the eyes of four to six workers remove the less healthy grapes.\n\nAnne has no stricture formula for destemming, explaining that It depends on the vintage and the particular site. Fermentation, always done with native yeast, varies from 10 to 20 days, again depending on vintage and site.\n\nBarrel-ageing at Domaine Parent is, similarly, non-formulaic, but always occurs in French oak, of which 25% to 40% are new, except for the grand cru bottling, which can see from 80% to 100% new oak.\n\nAnne uses the traditional 228-litre Burgundy barrel (in French, la pièce) for ageing most of her wines, but she is experimenting with larger, 600-litre barrels. She intends to experiment with amphora in the future but is sceptical. Still, as she says” ‘I want to see what all the buzz is about.’\n\nDuring the many years I’ve tasted in Parent’s cellars, I’ve always been amazed at the seamless integration of what sounds like a lot of new oak for the grand cru bottlings. It reminds me of something another winemaker once told me, ‘the wine is not over-oaked, it’s under-fruited!’\n\nThe ‘easy’ 2022s\n\nThe 2022 growing season, like 2018, 2019, and 2020, was hot and dry. Unusually heavy rain in June helps explains why the wines turned out so splendidly and have been widely acclaimed.\n\nThe rain replenished the water table, which allowed the vines and grapes to avoid stress, and prevented the grapes from becoming over-ripe. Unusually for such a hot year, the sugars and tannins ripened simultaneously.\n\nAnd, unlike the previous hot and dry years, the wines are balanced and fresh with normal or even low levels of alcohol. One suspects that Pommard’s clay soil with its water-retaining ability, may have contributed to the success of Parent’s wines in 2022.\n\nAnne is positively ecstatic about her 2022s, exclaiming: ‘The more I taste them, the more I like them.’\n\nShe was especially impressed – as was I – by the purity of fruit and the suaveness of the tannins. The harvest at Domaine Parent began on 31 August, earlier than usual, to preserve acidity, which judging from the wines, worked.\n\nAnne explains that: ‘Winemaking was easy in 2022 without any problems during fermentation.’ She continues: ‘In 2020, if you waited for phenolic maturity (maturity of the tannins) you could wind up with high alcohols.’\n\nFortunately, in 2022 the tannins were ripe at a lower level of potential alcohol (based on sugar ripeness), therefore, Anne didn’t need to include as many whole bunches – which she believes imparts delicacy by moderating the alcohol.\n\nHence, although the measured acidity is lower in the 2022s compared to the 2020s, the wines still taste vibrant and fresh because the alcohols are lower and the tannins riper.\n\nAs the tasting notes show, Parent’s 2022 Pommard are gorgeous – floral, elegant, and powerful. They combine gracefulness with the innate power of Pommard. They will evolve magnificently to express the magic of Burgundy, that is, if you can keep your corkscrew away from them.\n\nAttention consumers without cellars, many of the 2022s can be enjoyed young, within the first few years of bottling, because of their charm and youthful fruitiness.\n\nI suspect they will continue to display youthful seductiveness for a couple of years but they do have the requisite balance and structure to reward long term ageing.\n\nDrinking state of back vintages\n\nParent’s 2021s, another fine vintage showing great vibrancy because of the overall cooler temperatures – what I call a pre-climate change vintage – are lovely to drink now, and, like the 2022s, are likely to close down for a decade or so.\n\nThe riper and more structured 2020s will need more bottle age, perhaps another five or six years, before their allure will re-emerge.\n\nMeanwhile, Anne describes her 2019s as ‘charming, easy to drink, and sexy’. The bolder 2018s, however, like the 2020s, will benefit from another four or five years of bottle age, while the enchanting 2017s, from a lighter vintage, are delightful for current consumption.\n\nHappily, for consumers, a variety of older vintages of Parent’s Pommard are still available. The 2018 to 2020 vintages of Croix Blanche for around £60 a bottle, the 2020 Pommard Premier Cru Les Argillères and 2019 Pommard Premier Cru Les Chanlins for £90 apiece, and 2020 and 2017 Pommard Premier Cru Les Chaponnières for roughly £100 per bottle.\n\nTo confirm my impression that Domaine Parent’s Pommard evolve harmoniously over time, I retreated to my cellar to taste – and then drink – two older Les Epenots after returning from Burgundy in November when I tasted their 2022s.\n\nThe still youthful 2012 Les Epenots has just started to show the complexity of maturity along with a graceful elegance, while the vibrant 1985 conveyed a near magical combination of sweet black fruit, clean savoury mushroom-like nuances, all enrobed with silky fine tannins. A show-stopping wine.\n\nDomaine Parent: 2022 wines\n\nDomaine Parent, Corton Grand Cru, Burgundy, France, 2022\n\nEven at this youthful stage, the 2022 Corton Blanc packs power.

Parent’s vines are in Le Rognet et Corton section in the…\n\nPoints: 95\n\nJacques Parent et Cie, Monthélie, Burgundy, France, 2022\n\nShowing the importance of appellation, this négociant bottling from two distinct parcels in the village is a distinct step up from the Parent’s Bourgogne Blanc. Ripe melon-like fruit, a hint of creaminess and, and good acidity explains why Anne says this is a wine to ‘just enjoy’.\n\nPoints: 92\n\nJacques Parent et Cie, Bourgogne, Burgundy, France, 2022\n\nA négociant bottling, this is a charming, fruity expression of Burgundy meant to be enjoyed now.

It hits far above its weight and class. The Sélection Pomone comes from 50+ year-old vines that lie just outside of the Pommard village appellation. Anne ages it in 600-litre barrels.

Though big, it’s not a boisterous wine. Its breeding shows in its balance. Beaune Epenottes borders Pommard which might explain why wines from this vineyard often have a Pommard-like heft to them….\n\nPoints: 92\n\nLet me cut directly to the chase, or rather, the bottom line: Buy as much of the 2022 Burgundies—both red and white—as your budget allows. I give this advice after having been astonished by the results of my annual tasting trip to Burgundy in November. My prejudice was that the wines were going to be heavy and flabby because 2022 was another hot, dry year. But my tastings proved my prejudice wrong. (Data usually does that to prejudice.) In general, the wines are concentrated without going overboard and, importantly, and surprisingly given the heat of the vintage, balanced by freshness.\n\nLaurent Delaunay, who is the current president of the BIVB, the organization that represents growers and producers describes the wines as “nuanced and transparent.” Though you might expect that assessment from a person in his position, my tastings with both venerable négociants and small growers confirm that the appellation and vineyard boundaries are nicely etched. The reds display Burgundian charm while the whites display a balance of luscious fruit and minerality. The suaveness of the reds and the lusciousness of the whites reminded me of the 1985 vintage.\n\nWhat explains why the wines are so charming and delectable, especially since 2022 was another hot and dry year, conditions that do not favor the delicate Pinot Noir? The conventional wisdom is that that kind of growing season leads to over ripe grapes with low acidity, which translates into ripe, alcoholic wines that lack freshness and life. This was clearly not the case with the 2022s. Yes, in general, the wines are ripe. But they are balanced by a lively freshness without a trace of heat from high levels of alcohol.\n\nFrom talking to producers and other experts, I sense a combination of factors led to the success of the vintage. Frédéric Barnier, the very talented and straight-talking winemaker at Maison Louis Jadot, says that, paradoxically, June made the vintage. (The traditional wisdom is that September’s weather makes the vintage.) Though the year was dry overall, massive rains over a few days in June restored the ground water and allowed the vines to survive the remaining dry summer, preventing the grapes from shriveling or being over-ripe. Frédéric also says that he believes that the large volume of grapes slowed and reduced overall ripening. He notes that the level of acidity in the reds was similar to that in 2021, while in the whites it was lower. He does not consider 2022 a “fresh” (high acid) vintage, but the wines do taste fresh and lively, which he attributes to only moderate ripeness and moderate levels of alcohol, rarely exceeding 13.5 percent.\n\nLaurent Delaunay echoes Barnier, emphasizing the importance of yield. “A smaller crop would have resulted in jammy wines.” He believes that in 2021, the small crop saved that bad-weather vintage—a larger crop could not have ripened adequately in such a cool growing season.\n\nJasper Morris MW, one of the world’s great experts on Burgundy and someone with enormous experience with its wines, thinks that something else besides crop size was going on in 2022. He reminds us that 2018 was also a large crop, but the volume did not prevent the wines from being heavy. He believes that more and more growers are learning to pick a touch earlier to capture acidity. Indeed, all the growers with whom I tasted remarked on how they started the harvest earlier than usual.\n\nVéronique Drouhin, winemaker at her family’s Maison Joseph Drouhin, told me that, in addition to harvesting earlier—Drouhin started harvest on August 22—they are making adjustments in the vineyard and in the winery to mitigate the effects of climate change. After tasting Drouhin’s fresh and lively 2022s, they seemed to have worked!\n\nMy advice is that since you won’t be able to taste many bottled wines before you buy—many, if not most, will have been sold in advance before they are bottled—buy from producers who you’ve liked in the past. And seek out wines from lower pedigree appellations, such as Bourgogne Blanc or Bourgogne Rouge, where prices remain reasonable, from top producers. And remember off-the-beaten-track villages, such as Marsannay in the Côte de Nuits and Saint Romain in the Côte de Beaune. For whites, head to the Mâconnais where value abounds.\n\nMuch of what I tasted in November were barrel samples, that is, unfinished wines. Even though producers create representative samples to taste, the wines will still change and evolve before bottling. Sure, the wine continues to evolve even after bottling—that’s one of the wonders of wine—but far more gradually. Before bottling the evolution and changes can occur much more rapidly and can be enormous. Which is why I generally avoid recommending specific wines based on tasting barrel samples. Thus, in the notes below, you’ll notice generalizations in addition to specifics when I tasted bottled wines.\n\nLet me start with the Mâconnais because that’s where the value for whites lies. Wines with point scores have been bottled. Prices are listed for those wines available on the U.S. retail market at press time, according to winesearcher.com.\n\nWith the 2022 vintage, the label will change from Domaine Roger Lassarat to Lassarat et Fils because the reins have been handed to Roger’s son, Pierre-Henri, who wants to emphasize the family’s name. Though all the vineyards, except for a sliver of Sur La Roche, are farmed organically, official certification will not arrive until the 2023 vintage. As always, Lassarat’s 2022s are vibrant, balanced, and focused. Lassarat bottles two easy-to-recommend St. Véran. The “fruity and easy,” as Pierre-Henri describes it, “Plaisir” bottling (91 pts, $30), made from young, less than 25- year-old vines, and the invigorating and more substantial “Prestige” bottling (92 pts), a blend of five plots whose vines average 40 years of age. Their minerally and refined 2022 Mâcon-Vergisson “La Roche,” (93 pts, $30) from a vineyard at the top of the village and just across the road from the Pouilly-Fuissé boundary, has more character than most wines from Mâcon. Lassarat’s stunning 2022 Pouilly-Fuissé, “Terroir” (94 pts, $40), a blend of three plots, two from Vergisson and one in Solutré, shows why that appellation has such appeal. Frankly, I suggest buying any of Lassarat’s 2022s that you can find. You will not be disappointed.\n\nDomaine Mathias in Chaintré, an organic, family-run estate of just over 30-acres in Macon, Pouilly-Fuissé and Pouilly-Vinzelles, made commendable wines in 2022. Gilles, who runs the domine with his son, Thibault, explains that he finds naturally lower yields with organic farming. Uplifting saline-acidity amplified the charm of their bright and balanced 2022 Mâcon-Chaintré, “Château du Chaintré.” (91 pts, $25). Their subtly creamy 2022 Pouilly-Vinzelles, “Les Longeays,” is a step up and confirms the stature of that appellation. (92 pts). Even more exciting is the complexity that 50 to 60-year-old vines impart to their finesse-filled 2022 Pouilly-Fuissé, “Vieilles Vignes.” (93 pts).\n\nThe label, Domaine Ste. Barbe/Jean-Marie Chaland, takes a little explaining, but the wines do not—they are uniformly stunning. Here’s another domaine where you should buy whatever you can find and whatever your budget allows. Jean-Marie Chaland runs the Domaine Ste. Barbe, which explains why both names are on the label. Plenty of acidity supports their easy-to drink fruity 2022 Macon-Villages “Les Tilles” (91 pts, $20). As Jean-Maire exclaims with a smile, “we don’t need to think all the time.” Jean-Marie’s stellar 2022 Viré-Clessé show why those two villages deserve their own appellation. The saline-like acidity amplifies the charms of the finesse-filled 2022 Viré-Clessé “Vieilles Vignes” that comes from 50-year-old vines (92 pts, $20), while the Viré-Clessé “Chazelles” displays a touch more ripeness without sacrificing any elegance (94 pts, $24). As you can see, the wines are a bargain.\n\nMoving to the Côte d’Or, Domaine Michel Bouzereau, led by Jean-Baptiste, is another “can’t miss” producer. He started harvest earlier than usual and was thrilled with the results because of the precision and freshness of the wines. He explains that there’s “plenty of flesh to go with the energy.” No disagreement on my part. As with past vintages, their 2022s wines are simply marvelous. You just can’t go wrong with any of the wines from this producer, one of Meursault’s best. I can recommend only one specific wine, their vibrant and deep 2022 Bourgogne Côte d’Or, because all the others were still in barrel or had just been racked. However, judging from my past experience with their wines and how the other wines were showing, I have no doubt that their 2022s will be exemplary when bottled. My advice: buy what you can find and can afford.\n\nBouzereau has used the new appellation, Bourgogne Côte d’Or, which indicates that all the grapes came from the Côte d’Or, the heart of Burgundy, as opposed to anywhere else in the region. Sixty percent of the grapes for this marvelous Bourgogne Blanc came from Meursault and the remainder from Puligny-Montrachet, but obviously, from outside of those village appellations. You wouldn’t know it from tasting the wine. Crisp and riveting, it delivers a marvelous and seamless combination of minerals and subtle fruitiness. Tasted blind, it would be easy to mistake it for a village Meursault, except, of course, for the price (93 pts, $37). Michel Bouzereau’s equally compelling and suavely textured 2022 Bourgogne Rouge Côte d’Or (93 pts, $38) is a good reminder that wines with a down-market pedigree from a top producer is where to find value in Burgundy.\n\nMy visit and tasting at Domaine Jean Pascal et Fils, a 35-acre family-run estate based in Puligny-Montrachet was motivated by their stunning 2020 Bourgogne Côte d’Or Blanc, a case of which lies in my cellar. Alexandra, the daughter-in-law of the recently deceased Jean Pascal, like others, started the harvest early, August 22, to capture acidity. It worked. Their racy 2022 Bourgogne Côte d’Or Blanc, like the 2020, is stunning for a Bourgogne Blanc and is just another example of the importance of buying wines with lesser pedigrees from top producers (92 pts, $32). A big step up in depth, complexity and price, Pascal’s 2022 rich and vibrant Meursault out-performs its village appellation (94 pts, $66). Their striking 2022 Puligny-Montrachet 1er Cru Les Chalumaux combines weight and a captivating floral element with vibrancy (95 pts, $92 for the 2020). Pascal’s entire range is easy to recommend.\n\nDomaine Méo-Camuzet, like other top growers, has a négociant business to supplement their production. None of the wines at Méo-Camuzet were bottled when I tasted there in November, but the range was splendid. Though the label of the bottled wines will eventually distinguish the domaine from the négociant wines, it’s difficult to see the distinction when tasting barrel samples of the two. The same consistency and high-quality is evident in both. What also struck me was the vibrancy and energy of Méo-Camuzet’s 2022s. My advice, buy what you can afford. In my experience, Méo-Camuzet’s wines develop magnificently with bottle age.\n\nThe advantage of tasting at Burgundy’s top négociants is the ability to sample a wide range of wines from throughout Burgundy as opposed to a grower’s range, which is typically narrower and limited to their home territory. Additionally, tasting with Véronique Drouhin (winemaker at the family run firm of Maison Joseph Drouhin) and Frédéric Barnier (winemaker at Maison Louis Jadot) allows an assessment of how individual producer styles—elegant and lacey for Drouhin; sturdier and more robust for Jadot, fare in a particular vintage. Spoiler alert: Both styles succeeded marvelously in 2022. None of the wines at either house had been bottled when I tasted, so I cannot give specific recommendations. That said, Drouhin and Jadot each produced a spectacular array of 2022s, reflecting their respective styles, but also allowing the origins of the grapes to speak clearly, reinforcing the success and transparency of the vintage. I’ve long been a fan of both houses, have great experience tasting their wines young and watching how they develop with cellaring. Though differently styled, of course, Drouhin’s and Jadot’s 2022s are sensational young wines. I recommend them enthusiastically. I repeat my opening advice: buy as much of the 2022s as your budget allows from producers you like.\n\n* * *\n\nE-mail me your thoughts about Burgundy at [email protected] and follow me on Twitter and Instagram @MichaelApstein\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nIn recent memory, prices for Burgundy have seemed to defy gravity—they always rise. The prices at this year’s recently completed Hospices de Beaune auction, the 163rd, actually fell, demonstrating that gravity does exist there. The average price per barrel was €30,839 ($33,642), down 14 percent compared to 2022, but consumers may not notice any difference anytime soon because of the complexity of the market. Still, it’s good news because the 2023 vintage was even larger than the generous and superb 2022, so cellars are full, which at least sets the stage for possible price reductions. That said, the priciest barrel, a grand cru, Bâtard-Montrachet Cuvée Dames de Flandres, went for €350,000 ($381,500), up 14 percent compared to last year.\n\nThe Hospices de Beaune auction is no ordinary wine auction. This auction catalogue lists no special bottles, no extravagant vacations, no winemakers’ dinners. The locals call it Vente des Vins (sale of wines) because that what’s sold: barely finished-fermenting, unfinished wine still in barrel from the just completed harvest. Until 2005, bidding was limited to local négociants, such as Albert Bichot, Louis Jadot, or Robert Drouhin, to name just three, who would perform the élevage (literally, raising or finishing) the wine, bottle, and sell it via the usual commercial channels roughly two years after the auction. Now, however, Sotheby’s runs the auction and individuals can bid—in person, via the internet, or via telephone. Winning bidders take delivery of the wine in barrel, called une piece in Burgundy, which contains 228 liters or about 300 bottles. An individual whose bid is successful will have arranged, in advance, with a local négociant to raise, bottle, and ship the wine. At least one négociant, Albert Bichot, allows individuals to buy one-quarter or one-half a barrel by putting customers together. (https://hospices-beaune.com/en/buy-wine-auction/faq-how-to-buy-barrel-hospices-beaune-auction-albert-bichot/).\n\nIn addition to obtaining a top-notch Burgundy, an additional incentive for individuals to bid is to see their name on the label. The label of the bottled wine contains the emblem of the Hospices de Beaune, the appellation and name of the cuvée, the négociant who raised the wine, and the name of the individual who purchased it.\n\nThe Ventes de Vins weekend, highlighted by the auction on the third Sunday in November, is, in a word, a blast, both for wine geeks as well as people who just like to party. Wine enthusiasts will arrive a week or two in advance and arrange tastings. Then, on Friday night, the charming town of Beaune (population 20,000) hosts an enormous outdoor party. Lights, street performers, marching bands, and an influx of 40,000 merry makers transform the normally sleepy town. Locals will greet you with, “bon Ventes de Vins,” much as we would say, “good afternoon.” Pop-up food stands offering foie gras, frogs’ legs, oysters, and oeufs en murette, the uniquely Burgundian dish of eggs and bacon poached in red wine or sauced with Époisses, surround the Place Carnot and adjacent streets. Wine, of course, flows everywhere. It’s a family affair with parents pushing kids in strollers and dogs hoping for—and usually finding—dropped morsels. At times the streets are so densely packed, it’s difficult to move. Saturday features a cork-pulling contest as well as the traditional half-marathon through the vineyards that starts, oddly enough, at two in the afternoon, “to give runners time to have a decent lunch,” as one resident explained to me. This year multiple art exhibits in Beaune and Pommard featuring local artists drew crowds.\n\nThe origin of the wines is as unique as the auction itself. The Hospices de Beaune (hospital of Beaune) owns about 150-acres of vineyards, most of which are classified as grand or premier cru, that have been donated to it over the centuries, making it one of the largest landowners and one of the most important producers in Burgundy. So, along with a Chief of Medicine and Chief of Surgery, the hospital has a full-time winemaker, who supervises 20-plus winegrowers that tend the vineyards. (As a physician myself, I’d love to attend those staff meetings!)\n\nAt this year’s auction, the 754 barrels sold raised about €23.3 million ($25.4 million). A special barrel, Pièce des Présidents, which contained a Grand Cru, Mazis-Chambertin, Cuvée Madeleine Collignon, fetched €350,000 ($381,500), which will be donated to two charities, Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (FRM) and the Initiative de Recherche pour une Longévité en Bonne Santé (IRLB), both of which are dedicated to research into improving life expectancy and maintaining good health. The remaining roughly €23 million goes to the Hospices de Beaune to finance major new structural projects in 2024, including construction of a new hospital building, upgrading hospital equipment with cutting edge technology, and modernizing the winery.\n\nThe barrel itself for the Pièce des Présidents came from a 200-plus year-old oak tree, the majority of which was used as the new spire in the rebuilding of Notre Dame de Paris that was destroyed in 2019. Enough remained after the spire was in place to be used to make the special barrel.\n\nAlthough most of the buyers hailed from Europe—Albert Bichot alone purchased 156 barrels, accounting for fully one-third of the sales—the sale attracted buyers from all over Asia, including Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and China, according to Matthew Floris, press officer for Sotheby’s.\n\nLudivine Griveau, the current winemaker and first female to hold that position, was very pleased with the quality of the 2023s. From Hospices de Beaune vineyards, she produced 51 cuvées (bottlings) in 2023. She explained that variable weather during the growing season resulted in uneven ripening of the grapes. So, she and her team had to make a severe selection to eliminate diseased, unripe, or over-ripe ones. She estimated that she discarded 10 to 15 percent of the crop that made it to the winery and added that the harvesters could have discarded twice that amount in the vineyard. As a result, fewer barrels were up for sale at the 2023 auction (754 barrels, 475 of red and 179 or white) compared to 802 in 2022, despite a larger harvest.\n\nTo me, though the reds of 2023 were more difficult to taste because of their structure compared to the suave 2022s, they had purity of fruit, enlivening acidity, and balance. It appears Griveau’s severe selection paid off. If other producers did as well—and it’s far too early to tell—the 2023 vintage could be notable for both quantity and quality.\n\nFor details concerning the 2024 Hospices de Beaune auction, always held on the third Sunday in November, contact Sotheby’s by emailing [email protected] or [email protected].\n\nThe wine world lost a giant last month. Miljenko “Mike” Grgich, the man who thrust California wine onto the world’s stage, died at age 100 at his home in Calistoga in the Napa Valley.\n\nGrgich, more than anyone, is responsible for California’s reputation as a place that could make great wine when his 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay took first place at a wine competition that pitted France’s best white Burgundies against upstarts from California. And he did it unintentionally—more about that later.\n\nThe late Steven Spurrier, an Englishman who owned a wine shop in Paris, organized the competition in 1976 (now dubbed “The Judgement of Paris”) in celebration of America’s bicentennial.\n\nJust consider the array of white Burgundies that Chateau Montelena upended: Domaine Roulot’s 1973 Meursault Charmes, (whose current release sells for $1,307 a bottle, according to winesercher.com), Drouhin’s 1973 famed Beaune Clos des Mouches Blanc ($289), Domaine Leflaive’s 1972 Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles ($1,043), and a 1973 Bâtard Montrachet, Grand Cru, from Ramonet Prudhon. For comparison, the current release price of Chateau Montelena is $75.\n\nThe all-French judges (except for Spurrier and his American associate, Patricia Gallagher) were no novices. All were luminaries of the French food and wine establishment and included Jean-Claude Vrinat, owner of the then three-star Michelin restaurant, Taillevent; Odette Kahn, the editor of La Revue du vin de France, France’s most important wine guide; Christian Vannequé, the sommelier at La Tour d’Argent, another Michelin three-star restaurant at the time; and Aubert de Villaine, the co-owner, and, at the time, the director of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, (the fabled “DRC,”) Burgundy’s most revered estate.\n\nThe late James Barret, a lawyer and businessman, hired Grgich to be winemaker at Napa Valley’s Chateau Montelena shortly after he purchased it in 1972. The story goes that Barret wanted to make a great red wine. After all, Montelena was in Napa Valley, where Cabernet was king. Grgich explained that a red wine project would take years to generate sales because of the time needed to plant the vines and then age the wine. So, for cash flow, they settled on making Chardonnay to start. What a serendipitous start! Though the Napa Valley received acclaim when Montelena won, 70 percent of the grapes for that award-winning Chardonnay came from the Sonoma Valley, according to Dan Berger, the legendary California-based wine writer.\n\nMiljenko Grgich was born on April 1, 1923, in Desne, Yugoslavia, in what is now Croatia. The youngest of eleven, Grgich spent his childhood among the vines which his parents, who were farmers, cultivated in addition to vegetables and livestock. His parents died while he was still a young boy, so an older sister raised him.\n\nHe studied viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb, but had his studies interrupted by the arrival of the Yugoslav Communists. Living in Zagreb in 1949 was not easy. He recalls carrying a mattress he made from cornhusks to give to his sister, so she didn’t have sleep on the cement floor of the cell where the ruling Communists had imprisoned her. Eager to escape the Communists, Grgich left university before graduating after he received a United Nations-sponsored fellowship and visa to emigrate to Germany. From Germany he made his way to Canada after the U.S. declined his application for a visa. He sailed to Canada where he was supposed to cut trees in the Yukon. Luck struck when he missed the train to the Yukon and wound up instead in Vancouver where he heard about the “paradise” of the Napa Valley. He placed an ad in a California newspaper where Lee Stewart, owner and winemaker of Souverain Cellars, read it and offered him a job and—more importantly—sponsored his immigration application.\n\nOne of his big breaks came when the fabled Russian-born California winemaker, André Tchelistcheff, hired him as a chemist to analyze wine at Beaulieu Vineyards. After BV, the legendary Robert Mondavi hired Grgich as winemaker where he made Mondavi’s famous 1969 Cabernet Sauvignon, which was selected as California’s best Cabernet at a prestigious tasting organizer by Robert Balzer of the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn 1977, Grgich went into partnership with Austin Hills of Hills Brothers Coffee and Hills’ sister, Mary Lee Strebl. Paul Landeros, an independent viticulturist who worked for both Hills and Chateau Montelena put the two together. He knew Hills, who already owned vineyards, was looking for a winemaker. They broke ground on July 4, 1977. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIn addition to the awards Grgich Hills Estate wines have received, Mike Grgich is justifiably proud of his other accomplishments. Thanks to his viticultural training in Zagreb, Grgich almost immediately noticed upon arriving in the Napa Valley the similarity between Zinfandel and Croatia’s Plavic Mali grape. He helped convince Carole Meredith to research Zinfandel’s origins and was thrilled when his visual acumen was confirmed by DNA testing, which showed Plavic Mali and Zinfandel arose from a common ancestor.\n\nWith the demise of Communism and the independence of Croatia, Grgich told me a decade ago that a new era for Croatian wines was on the horizon. He went on to make wine from the Croatian local grapes, Posic and Plavic Mali, on the Dalmatian coast. In addition to his enological expertise, Grgich contributed heavily to mine-clearing projects in his homeland. He was especially proud for having been recognized with two plaques in Croatia—one for wine and one for mine-clearing.\n\nWhen I last met with Grgich, he had just turned 90, and was still vigorous. Though slightly stooped and walking with a cane, he met the Napa Valley wine train that stops in front of his winery. Wearing his signature beret, he would usher people into his tasting room, encouraging them to taste…and also to buy.\n\nSome assumed his beret was to remind people that his wine beat the French whites at the Paris tasting. But his beret-wearing preceded that event by decades and reflects his parsimony. He needed to take multiple trams to school in Zagreb, where, according to Grgich, it rains as much as it does in Vancouver. On one such trip he left his umbrella behind. Too poor to buy another one, he bought a beret instead, which he figured he would never lose since it would either be on his head or folded in his pocket. His original beret is on display today, along with the cardboard suitcase that accompanied him from his home in Croatia to the Napa Valley, in the Smithsonian Museum of American History. There Grgich is honored along with another icon of Americana, Julia Child.\n\nDespite his extraordinary success, Grgich was always a modest man, quick to thank everyone who has ever helped him. He always remembered how, in the mid 1990s, Robert Mondavi invited him back to discuss the monumental 1969 Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon when Mondavi was hosting a famous vertical Cabernet tasting. Grgich was embarrassed that Bob, who knew everything about that 1969 Cabernet—and all the others—had invited him back even though he had worked with Mondavi for a mere four years. “That, Grgich told me, “was the kind of person Robert Mondavi was—he was a generous man.”\n\nGrgich always saw the positive, “I failed at many things, but succeeded at more…I don’t talk about my mistakes.” He eventually had a falling out—to put it mildly—with Jim Barrett, the principal owner of Chateau Montelena, who barely acknowledged Grgich’s role in the Paris tasting. But when asked about it, Grgich always took the high road, “I’m thankful he gave me a job and the opportunity to make great wine.”\n\nWinemakers would be wise to follow Grgich’s winemaking philosophy: “Let the grapes speak. You need to preserve what’s in the grape. What’s made by God is always better than what’s made by man.” He continued, “You can measure acidity and sugar. You can’t measure aromas or complexity. You must taste.” He recounted once coming home to lunch just when harvest was about to start and not eating what his wife had just prepared. She was hurt. He explained, “I’ve just been tasting pounds of grapes.”\n\nHe often pointed out that in the current environment, “The winemaker wants to speak.” As he explained, drawing on his Croatian background, in English, “I” is written with a capital letter and “you” is lower case. In the Croatian language, it’s the opposite. “In California, the ‘I,’ the winemaker, dominates and wants to prove something. Sometimes the something is good, sometimes not. Winemakers today need to rely on their ‘feelings’ and not just the computer,” Grgich insisted. “Feelings are superior to computers when making wine.” He concluded, “Wines that are balanced—t"
