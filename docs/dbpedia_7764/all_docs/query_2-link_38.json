        "text": "Both Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud are very much children of the Enlightenment in certain manners. As such, they each sometimes display a qualified but firm optimism about history inevitably making progress in specific desirable directions. For instance, Freud predicts that continuing scientific and technological advances eventually will drive religiosity from human societies once and for all. Marx likewise forecasts the withering away of religions. Moreover, he treats this predicted process as symptomatic of even more fundamental socioeconomic developments, namely, his (in)famous anticipations of subsequent transitions to socialism and communism. However, the past century of human history obviously has not been kind to any sort of Enlightenment-style progress narratives, Marx's and Freud's included. My intervention on this occasion takes inspiration especially from Jacques Lacan's sober reckoning with a \"triumph of religion\" defying Freud's expectations of relentlessly broadening and deepening secularization. I argue that socio-political phenomena of the past several decades bear witness to religious superstructures having infused themselves into economic superstructures.\n\nSpecial Issue of Critical Discourse Studies. 2018, VOL. 15, NO. 4, 321–324. This year marks the 200th birthday of Karl Marx, one of the most influential thinkers of the social sciences and humanities. We take this anniversary as an opportunity to explore the various relations between Marx(ism) and Discourse Studies. From its beginnings, particularly in France, discourse analysis and theory have been heavily influenced by Marxist analyses of the social. Simultaneously, over the course of the past few decades, discourse theories and analyses have helped shape contemporary Marxism and provided much needed critiques of orthodox Marxist economism and Marxism’s neglection of phenomena traditionally counted as belonging to the ‘superstructure’. This Special Issue was born out of the desire to collectively reflect on these relations and discuss the relevance of Marxian concepts and ideas for Discourse Studies today.\n\nDrawing on the work of Marx, Adorno, and contemporary critical theorists, this paper surveys the status of ideology critique with special attention to its function as a kind of 'disenchantment' with the present social order. Rather than tracking disenchantment at the level of the concept, we highlight how the fundamental contradictions of that order warrant disenchantment as the appropriate critical attitude in the face of increasingly pervasive 'socially necessary semblance' (i.e., ideology). Instead of describing a kind of affective or political pessimism, disenchantment should, for the critical theorist, prompt a disillusionment, an occasion to dispel notions of the political present which serve not human ends but only their own reproduction through mystification. • Disenchantment Redux: Marx, the Frankfurt School, and the Critique of Ideology Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain, not in order that [humankind] shall bear the chain without caprice or consolation but so that [they] will cast off the chain and pluck the living flower.-Karl Marx, \"Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,\" 1843 'Disenchantment' has, for many, described the decisive problematization of such notions as social totality and ideology. In this paper, we will argue that this 'disenchantment' with ideology in the history of philosophy has not exhausted the concept's critical force. Rather, we argue that disenchantment in the form of ideology critique retains the normative force to critique the historical conditions that have produced that very category. We claim, however, that the concept of 'disenchantment' itself can also operate ideologically in such a way that undermines the critical potential of the concept; its ideological appearance is perhaps the most common use of the term today. Contrary to these more recent uses and misreadings of the term, the concept of disenchantment is not antithetical to the notion of social totality. Further, it is precisely this obfuscation of social contradiction as a totality that allows the concept to function ideologically. Drawing on the work of Marx, Adorno, and contemporary critical theorists, we aim to survey the status of ideology critique with special attention to its function as a kind of 'disenchantment' with the present social order. In other words, rather than tracking disenchantment at the level of the concept, we will demonstrate that fundamental contradictions of that order warrant disenchantment."
