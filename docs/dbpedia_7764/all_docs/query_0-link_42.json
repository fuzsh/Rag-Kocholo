        "text": "#mentalmonday I am still reflecting on a conversation I had at #minexchange2024 and it was about how this person did not understand the push for empowerment and advocacy for females in the industry- her reasoning was that she must have been lucky with bosses and mentors and just wanted everyone to be able to work. I have heard that exact phrase from shifters I work with when they fight back on Diversity training, and it wasn't too long ago I was in the same boat. For the beginning part of my career I did not think I experienced inequality in my treatment, I did not think I was seeing any microaggressions that could possibly be attributed to anything other than my ability to do the work. But once I learned that the jabs about not allowing me to get dirty, being surprised I was actually capable of doing manual labor, being talked over in meetings and demeaned in emails- those are the microaggressions females in the US face today, and it is exhausting having the walls up to fight those every single day. In other parts of the world I know it is much worse still. Anytime you have to mask either against microaggressions or in an attempt to hide a neurodivergent trait you already start the day using more energy than everyone else. In an extreme example of why advocacy and standing up for those around you even if you yourself are not effected is the poem \"First They Came\" by Pastor Martin Niemöller. I was reintroduced to this poem this weekend and the power of it has stuck with me. If you have not read this poem, this is a historic lesson about what happens when we turn a blind eye to the struggles of those around us. \"First they came for the Communists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Communist Then they came for the Socialists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist Then they came for the trade unionists And I did not speak out Because I was not a trade unionist Then they came for the Jews And I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew Then they came for me And there was no one left To speak out for me\" Source: https://lnkd.in/ewB9AHzV #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness\n\nInteresting developments are afoot in the world. The pro-Israel community is always up against it because the world is inherently antisemitic. This pervasive reality doesn’t begin with media networks; it began many centuries ago and is part of what I call generational antisemitism. It is so deeply ingrained as to be acceptable in our modern cultural zeitgeist. It is passed down from father to son, mother to daughter. Why bring this up? Isn’t it a simple cop-out used by Jews and their supporters? Isn’t it the same as playing the racism card every time a black person or a person of color doesn’t get their way? No, it’s not the same. Quite the contrary: our media is highly sympathetic to people of color. They go to the extreme to be politically correct so as not to offend anyone of color. The media often intentionally neglect to mention details of ethnicity or race when people of color commit unlawful acts. The same cannot be said of the media’s treatment of Israel and the pro-Israel community. Every single day, our news channels are bombarded with extremely one-sided commentary on the war with the terrorist group Hamas. Israel is always portrayed as the villain, a ruthless occupying force massacring helpless women and children. This blatant antisemitism is the express domain of editorial boards with an agenda to misinform. It slots right into the liberal playbook. This slanted coverage is designed to fit the woke apologist culture of modern times. Painting Israel as a nation of white supremacists brutalizing brown Palestinians certainly fits the bill. Except it’s all bullshit. That’s not the reality at all. That’s not the truth at all. But you wouldn’t know it because you’ve probably never been to the region. Israel is a multicultural, pluralistic society of Bedouins, Ethiopians, Indians, Asians, Europeans, Americans, South Africans, and every other shade of Jew and non-Jew alike. How quickly the world forgets that Hamas terrorists – the brown people – perpetrated the most heinous, savage, ruthless massacre in recent history. They targeted a specific religious group with the intent to commit genocide. Were they not stopped dead in their tracks, that genocide would have numbered tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of truly innocent people. I’m calling you out, world media, and all your acolytes for your blatant hypocrisy, myopic focus, and hateful narratives. Israel is fighting for all the people of Israel against terrorism – it has nothing to do with domination of another nation. You try living alongside a terrorist infrastructure comprising hundreds of miles of terror tunnels laden with RPGs, C4, AK-47s, anti-tank missiles, and intent to massacre at any given opportunity. Take your media bias and shove it. This is where we speak the truth – Israel was attacked. Israel is a victim. Israel is the Jewish Homeland and the Homeland of all Christian & Muslim Israelis. #standwithisrael #destroyhamas\n\nUrgent Plea for Humanity: A Child's Cry in the Shadows Important Note: Sensitive content appreciation warning LinkedIn this is not graphic that it is against any policy but have a placed caveat warning: sensitive content warning Dear World Leaders, Presidents, and Corporate CEOs,World Health Organization World Economic Forum The Royal Hashemite Court United Nations Human Rights Watch UNICEF Grappling with the profound question: What if this innocent child were your son, grandson, or someone you knew intimately? Would your silence persist, or would you take decisive action? Imagine if this child hailed from the USA, Ukraine, Europe, or the United Kingdom—would your response differ? I implore you not to look away, not to remain silent in the face of such injustice. As leaders, you wield significant influence over policies and actions. Yet, the world watches as conflicts persist, affecting the lives of countless innocent beings. I ask you to reflect on your responsibilities, transcending borders and biases. Where are the voices of animal activists, champions of human rights, and advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion? The same platforms that resonate with impassioned pleas for justice on earmarked days fall eerily silent when confronted with the harsh reality of indiscriminate violence. This child deserves a life free from the shackles of discrimination and Islamophobia. The plea is simple: cease the firing, be it bullets or individuals, and champion the cause of peace and understanding. I implore you to be genuine leaders, not just in title but in action. Let your legacy be one of compassion, empathy, and the unwavering commitment to creating a world where every child, regardless of their origin or background, can embrace the promise of a brighter future. #ceasefirenow\n\nIsrael is not above international humanitarians Laws. Forced Deportation Civils Palestinians from North to South GAZA is a War Crime; you didn't need more proof it is in live on TV Channels. Where is the International Court of Justice for this war crime? Joe Biden, Macron, Rishi Sunak, Sholtz, Justin Trudeau; are allied with the War Criminal Netanyahu; They are all War Criminals. They did not want to ask for immediate Ceasefire, because more than 10000 innocent Civils Palestinians killed by the Zionist Colonialist Israeli army is not enough; they want more killing. They will have remorse of conscience. Are you human beings? I don't believe it anymore. Call for a Ceasefire Now not tomorrow. Stop the extermination of Palestinian civilians The President of the United States and the Government of the United States are giving a lot of tax money from the American Citizens to Israel to pay for the American weapons and bombs that will be dropped on Palestinian civilians (Baby, Wife and Old Mens) without the knowledge of American citizens. USA is complicit with Netanyahu in exterminating the Palestinian civilian's population and War Crimes. Israel is not above the international Laws. STOP this War Now. Call Now for an immediate ceasefire. Israel is a terrorist state with the support and the agreement of USA and occidental Governments\n\nWW it does not matter if you have 2 followers or if you have 100,000 followers, if you have been silent on genocide, and you message me to thank me for my work, or if you message me to ask if I can use my platform to help you find a job, you will be checked because: 1. Racism: Your life and the safety of your family is not worth more than the safety and lives of brown, Black, and Indigenous Peoples, especially those being genocided. If you think your safety and comfort should be centered and valued at a higher rate, that’s racism. 2. Excuses: Our instructions from Palestinians are clear: bear witness and share their story. We are not accepting any excuses for your silence on genocide. Abdicating accountability by stating English is your second-language, especially while writing and communicating with clarity, does not hold water. 3. Receipts: We are checking receipts. If you have been doing performative nonsense like EDI work and you think you can lean on the last 10 years to defend your silence on the genocides (there are multiple, pick one), we see you and your support for colonialism and genocide. This is about here and now, and it is not too late to start.

We came to Germany and the series of horrific xenophobic attacks in the early 90s (Rostock Lichtenhagen, Solingen, etc.) are still intensely on my memory. But, at the same time, the strong reaction by the broad society in response to these events is in very good memory to me too. In the decades thereafter, the influence of German culture, history, literature, science, and last but not least good people of Germany made me someone that is proud to be a German. I see my migration background as a feature not a bug. Unfortunately, in the last 5 to 8 years we saw a continuous rise of authoritarianism which is ridden with racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, xenophobia, and misogyny. This is not only in Germany the case, but across the world. I must admit that these developments build a big feeling of helplessness, frustration and depression at times. I think that is the case for many people. That is the source of power for authoritarians, when they let the others feel helpless. When I read the investigative report by CORRECTIV about the fascistic takeover plans and deportations of millions, I was very much devastated and had also the strong feeling that once again there will may come a time when I have to flee, this time from Germany. Fortunately, the strong reactions of the last week throughout Germany turned on the light again in my head. I was at the protest last Sunday in Berlin and standing in the harsh cold weather together with thousands of other human beings was a huge ingestion of empowerment. I see small hints of a pro-democratic and pro-humanitarian movement at the horizon. It is very important that single individuals and the private society take a stand. But, in order to really grow this movement, it is inevitable that companies and those at the top of the companies take a stand for democracy. That is why I was truly happy to see our MDs take a stand and it makes me proud to be a part of Diconium. #niewiederistjetzt #gegenrechts #ganzklarfuerdemokratie Source of the image below: https://lnkd.in/d8_EN7Mh\n\nWhen I was 7 I asked Santa for a bookshelf, which I still have today. Never did I imagine one day I’d be putting a book I wrote there. It doesn’t feel like the right time to announce the publication of mine and Lina AbiRafeh’s book, given the atrocities unfolding in plain sight and the utter failure of both humanity and the institutions we are supposed to uphold and believe in. But is there ever a right time when we’re talking about human rights violations? We wrote this over a year ago and it is truly a sadness that these words and stories remain as relevant as ever. Undeniably, all struggles against oppression are connected, and the words of my friend and fierce feminist, Muna Nassar, resonate: \"All Palestinians are resisting because it is a constant, everyday thing. You are resisting even just by existing.\" Nobody should have to be resilient. Nobody should have to recover and rebuild, whether that is from rights being stripped away, unimaginable atrocities, or grave injustices – occurrences all too common in this region – because it implies something was taken away or lost, that something has to be gained back. And yet, with this book, we document a region that is ignited and overflowing with passion, determination, creativity, resistance and hope. Resistance that is challenging old processes and systems. Righteous rage that is being channeled to seek the change needed. In this book, we write about feminists—particularly young feminists—from the Arab region who are fighting tirelessly for their rights and are leading movements around the region pushing for change. Unfortunately, all too often the quest for change – and certainly for feminist change – rests on unstable ground. So, the revolution continues. Yalla.
