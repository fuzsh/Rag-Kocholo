        "text": "The Unforgiven is a 1960 American western film filmed in Durango, Mexico. It was directed by John Huston and has the unusual casting of Audrey Hepburn.\n\nMagnum Photos Agency photographer Inge Morath had met director John Huston while she was living in London, Morath worked on several of his films.\n\nThe Unforgiven, uncommonly for its time, spotlights the issue of racism against Native Americans and people believed to have Native American blood in the Old West.\n\nAside from this the film is most notable for its behind-the-scenes problems. Production was suspended for several months in 1959 after Hepburn broke her back when she fell off a horse while rehearsing a scene. Although she eventually recovered, the accident was blamed for a subsequent miscarriage Hepburn suffered.\n\nWhile photographing the making of The Unforgiven, Inge Morath accompanied Huston and his friends duck hunting on a mountain lake outside Durango. Photographing the excursion, Morath saw through her telephoto lens that actor Audie Murphy and his companion had capsized their boat 350 feet from shore. She could see that Murphy, stunned, was nearly drowning. A skilled swimmer, Morath stripped to her underwear and hauled the two men ashore by her bra strap while the hunt continued uninterrupted\n\nAudrey Hepburn during the production of The Unforgiven, Durango, Mexico, 1959.

In 1953, she joined the Magnum Photos Agency, founded by top photographers in Paris, and became a full photographer with them in 1955. Along with Eve Arnold, she was among the first women members. Magnum remains to this day a predominantly male organization.\n\nMorath’s work was motivated by a fundamental humanism, shaped as much by her experience of war as by its lingering shadow over post-war Europe. In Morath’s mature work, she documents the endurance of the human spirit under situations of extreme duress, as well as its manifestations of ecstasy and joy.\n\nIn 1955, she published her first collection of photographs, a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime. Morath was also the third and last wife of playwright Arthur Miller; their daughter is screenwriter/director Rebecca Miller.\n\nSelf-Portrait by Inge Morath, Jerusalem, 1958 via\n\nInge Morath, Portrait of Anais Nin, 1959 © Inge Morath © The Inge Morath Foundation via\n\nInge Morath, Gloria Vanderbilt New York, 1956 © Fotosammlung WestLicht, Wien via\n\nJayne Mansfield in bed in Beverly Hills, Inge Morath 1959 via\n\nAudrey Hepburn during the production of The Unforgiven, Durango, Mexico by Inge Morath 1959 via\n\nMarilyn Monroe on the set of the Misfits by Inge Morath, 1960s via"
