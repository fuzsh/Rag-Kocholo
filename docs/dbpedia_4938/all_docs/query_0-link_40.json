        "text": "INGE MORATH, the photographer who has died aged 78, was one of the finest photo-journalists of her generation; she worked for the international photo-agency Magnum for nearly 50 years, and was also noted for the books she produced in collaboration with her husband, the playwright Arthur Miller.\n\nHer photographs ranged from posed portraits of celebrities to snatched images of anonymous passers-by. Often they celebrated the human capacity for pleasure - Bedouin women dancing in the desert, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China climbing like children over a statue of Buddha. Sometimes they would focus on some joyful absurdity, such as her Encounter on Times Square (1957), in which a llama's head protrudes from a car window.\n\nIngeborg Morath was born on May 27 1923 at Graz, Austria. As the daughter of the science professor Edgar Morath, \"Inge\" was a member of the Austrian haute bourgeoisie but, when she was a child, the family moved to Germany.\n\nLife under the Third Reich was far from comfortable for the anti-Nazi Moraths, however, and Inge herself was to run into trouble with the authorities. While studying at the University of Berlin, she refused to join the National Socialist student organisation. Her educational privileges were consequently withdrawn, and she was forced to assemble aeroplane parts at Tempelhof airport, Berlin, at a time when it was being bombed daily. Her fellow-workers were Ukranian women, employed there because no one would miss them if they were blown up. On one occasion, after the factory had been subjected to a particularly heavy attack, Inge Morath ran through the streets of Berlin holding a bouquet of lilac above her head.\n\n\"During the war, you had to keep your mouth shut a lot of the time,\" she once told an interviewer. \"So you learnt to observe more closely. Goethe put it wonderfully when he said that we are born seeing, but we are required to look.\" It was this capacity for observation that informed her photography; she believed that, when you take a picture, \"you trust your eye, and cannot help but bare your soul\". What she saw during the war, however, did not move her to record more such conflicts: \"Everyone was dead or half dead. I walked by dead horses, women with dead babies in their arms. I can't photograph war for this reason.\"\n\nEscape from Tempelhof eventually came after an air-raid blasted open the factory gate. Inge Morath took the opportunity to walk out, and made her way to Austria, where her family was living once more. Once in Salzburg, she discovered her mother ensconced in the family home and found work as a translator and journalist working for the United States Information Service. She continued her journalistic career at the end of the war, editing the literary monthly, Der Optimist, from 1945 to 1952.\n\nThe bravery and initiative which Inge Morath showed during those war years were attributes which she would demonstrate all her life. She certainly displayed them while photographing the making of the film The Unforgiven (1960), shot by John Huston in the Mexican back country and starring Audie Murphy, the Second World War hero turned movie actor.\n\nAccompanying Huston and some friends duck shooting one afternoon, Inge Morath noticed a commotion further out in the lake. It proved to be Murphy, thrashing about in the water having apparently fallen out of a boat. She immediately removed her clothes and swam into the cold waters of the lake wearing just her underwear. Finding Murphy in the last stages of exhaustion, she calmly hauled the war hero ashore by her bra strap, while the duck shooting continued overhead.\n\nInge Morath was fluent in half a dozen languages and possessed a working knowledge of many others, including Romanian. Indeed, her ability so impressed the German chancellor Konrad Adenauer when she interviewed him on one occasion that he tried to hire her as his chief secretary. It was an offer she had no difficulty in refusing.\n\nShe had first turned to photography while living in London after the war with her first husband, the British journalist Lionel Birch. She studied under Simon Guttman, the eccentric art editor of Picture Post; but instead of being taught the practicalities of photography, she found herself being made to perform secretarial chores, and tasks such as heating Guttman's shaving water.\n\nWhen Inge Morath finally protested, Guttman replied: \"But I dictate all my letters to you. Everything I know about photography - how to approach a subject, how to build a story - is in those letters.\" Unorthodox as this training was, it was one which she later claimed to value.\n\nBy the mid-1950s Inge Morath was divorced and working at the offices of the photographic agency Magnum in Paris. It was the heyday of Henri Cartier-Bresson, for whom she worked as researcher and assistant; Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir were frequenting the cafes of the Left Bank. And it was in Paris that Inge Morath saw a performance of The Crucible, her first experience of the work of Arthur Miller, who would one day become her husband.\n\nIt was not until she made her first trip to New York in 1956, however, that the full significance of the play's anti-McCarthyite message struck home. Coming through American customs, Inge Morath was detained because she carrying in her baggage a book which, though about movie stars and called Stardust in Hollywood, had been published by the Left Bookshop.\n\nAfter rigorous questioning about her political sympathies, she was eventually released. As she left the airport she encountered a woman handing out leaflets ordering people to report any suspicious, un-American activities to the FBI.\n\nInge Morath first met Miller in the Nevada desert in 1960 during the shooting of The Misfits, the film he wrote for Marilyn Monroe. She arrived with Henri Cartier-Bresson to photograph the proceedings, and her picture of Monroe from that time - caught in an unguarded moment as Monroe walked dreamily beneath some trees - was one of the few unexploitative images of the screen goddess.\n\nAlthough the Miller-Monroe marriage was crumbling fast, Miller and Inge Morath did not become friendly until later, when they met again in New York. Her attitude to marriage was equivocal. Her own parents had converted from Catholicism to Protestantism to facilitate any possible divorce in the future, and she already had one failed marriage behind her; Miller, meanwhile, had two.\n\nHer decision to marry Miller in 1962 - the year after he and Monroe were divorced - proved a sound one. Miller later described the years he spent with her as \"the best\" of his life; and Timebends, his autobiography published in 1987, was dedicated to her.\n\nInge Morath and Miller travelled extensively together, often collaborating on photographic books (with Miller supplying the text) of which In Russia, published in 1969, was the first. Their visit to China in 1978, which produced Chinese Encounters (1979), took advantage of the fact that, for the first time in more than 30 years, the Chinese felt free to talk to foreigners.\n\nIn 1991 she published Russian Journal, a 25-year record of friends and people she met before, during and after the years of the Brezhnev repression.\n\nInge Morath was an assiduous worker - she was on top of a tall crane taking photographs in Brooklyn Navy Yard only four hours before going into labour with her daughter."
