        "text": "These issues are over and above the requirements of Health and Safety for a studio.\n\nRisk Assessment of the location, items to take into consideration – Visit the location before the shot and identify potential risks, access to the location, how where and when will equipment be required during the shot, will transport be required?\n\nWill you be working where road traffic could cause you a problem, or you cause a problem to road traffic?\n\nIs there a safe and secure place to leave equipment?\n\nIf the model is required to change clothes, is there a safe secure and private place that this can be done?\n\nWill you be working where pedestrians could cause you a problem, or you cause a problem to pedestrians?\n\nDo you require pedestrians to be removed from the location?\n\nDo you need a permit to photograph?\n\nDo you require additional props? If so could any of the props be considered ‘dangerous’?\n\nIs the location a known area for crime?\n\nDo you need assistants to hold items and to be an extra pair of eyes and ears while the photographer and model(s) concentrate on the shoot?\n\nIs the time of day going to cause problems for access or increased risk from any of the above identified potential risks? Day time or night time\n\nWill there be electric power points available? If power is available attention will be required to ensure the trailing leads are not going to cause a trip hazard or sharp objects will not cut the cables. The power sockets are not overloaded with more equipment that is permitted to draw too much power.\n\nHow did I create the series of pictures?\n\nI created all of my pictures using a digital SLR camera. The photographs were taken in RAW format, I used the available light, not flash, ISO-400, exposure 1/60 second, F-Stops varied between f/5.6 – f/3.5, the focal length varied quite a lot depending how close or far away I was from the subject. The RAW format gave me the opportunity to edit the pictures using Photoshop. Once I opened the pictures in Photoshop I changed the brightness and contrast of the pictures so that they all had similar lighting levels, this was adjusted individually by my judgement. This made the pictures stand out in the photograph.\n\nWhat worked well?\n\nI believe this has worked well this is because I have concentrated on the construction of one item in the exhibition, the series of photographs tell the story of how it was created. The large number of photographs I took shows the development of the art installation and when viewed in the flick book, the pages can be flicked through quickly to show speeded up how the manikin was built, dressed and the application of paint made. The viewer can decide what the message of the art installation is about in just the same way as if they had viewed the manikin at the exhibition.\n\nThere is additional movement created because I have taken some of the shots from different positions and viewpoints. The flick book provides a documentary of the display plus where it fitted in the wider exhibition.\n\nI also believe this final piece has worked well because I have managed to create a new and different way to display my work. This makes the pictures more interactive to look at making you more involved in the pictures as an observer.\n\nHow can I improve the picture?\n\nI can improve my final piece by making sure that the glue doesn’t get on the front of the pictures or squeeze out of the side so that pages do not unintentionally get stuck together. I can also improve my final piece by making sure that the photographs on each page is straight and aligned with the previous and next pages in the book. I would use next time a slightly larger book so that it is easier to flick through the images.\n\nDid I have to change any of my original ideas?\n\nThis was one of my original ideas that I stuck with. I did not change any of my original ideas for my final piece, this is because I was happy with the end results and the pictures I ended up with. I also believe that my original idea was effective and it interacted with the viewer.\n\nDid it fit in with the original theme?\n\nI believe the final piece provides a documentary of the exhibition as a story of the End of Year show. I also had to experiment thinking of several ideas that I could develop and decide once I had reviewed all my photographs which set of images and presentation format would best represent the show.\n\nBarbican – Art Gallery: Strange and Familiar: Britain as Revealed by International Photographers, 16 March 2016 – 19 June 2016\n\nThe exhibition was curated by British photographer Martin Parr, Strange and Familiar considers how international photographers from the 1930s onwards have captured the social, cultural and political identity of the UK. Exhibition includes photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson, Rineke Dijkstra, Robert Frank and Garry Winogrand, Raymond Depardon, Jim Dow, Akihiko Okamura, Frank Habicht, Bruce Davidson, Candida Hofer, Henri Cartier-Bresson.\n\nParr has selected photographs by international photographer’s images that represent Britain. They are a mix from old to new images, everyday views that typify the UK from the 1930s to the present day. Petrol pumps, to people playing football at local community match, high street shops, people on the peace march of the 1960s. The common appear unusual as things have changed over time. The exhibition is not only a collection of interesting photographs, they are a documentary of social history and political and cultural events. Over time life styles and occupations have changed.\n\nDetails of the photographers and the list of thier photographs exhibited 17922strangefamiliarwalltexts\n\nNewspaper reviews and reports about the exhibition\n\nTwo very different nations in one: Britain as seen by foreign photographers – review.

From the series UK77: Digging my Way to London, 1977\n\nhttp://www.shinro-ohtake.com/\n\nThe aim of a portrait is to capture and create a representation of a person, the face and its expression is predominant. A portrait is intended to capture the character or essence of a person, their personality as well as their likeness, a portrait can even tell a story about an individual. A portrait often shows a person looking directly out and at the viewer with the intention to connect and engage the subject with the viewer.\n\nA search on the internet for images of photographic portraits finds mostly images of head shots or head and should shots. There are even less that are photographs from the waist up.\n\nWhat I consider makes a good portrait.\n\nThe portrait of the person is the main subject, recognisable, and not too artistic, because then it ceases to be a portrait but becomes a photographic composition with a person. Portrait photography in my opinion is very different from informal candid photograph snaps of people doing things or attending events.\n\nMy intention with portrait photography is to create a good likeness, with something that the portrait sitter recognises about themselves and others recognise as that person. I hope that my portraits also say something about the individual, their character and mood at the time of sitting, have an artistic and creative element, but not too manufactured.\n\nHistory of Portraits\n\nThe portrait has been around since man has been able to draw and paint. The portrait has been a method to remember people, what they look like. Through the ages portrait paintings became popular with the rich and famous, royalty, nobility, religious leaders or military leaders. Portraits were a means of immortalising themselves and a method to demonstrate their wealth power or importance, to others. Painting remained a skilled trade, and not something anyone could practice as a hobby. Only the rich could afford portraits by well established artists that produced paintings of quality likeness.\n\nWith the introduction of photography individual and family portraits were possible and affordable by many. The time taken to produce photographic portraits compared to paintings was considerably less. Photographic portraits was available for the majority of people. The high quality image and the relatively small size pictures also made portraits something that could be easily carried around or sent in a letter. The photographic medium made portraiture a popular subject and many photographic studios, shops business were set up. Many families had their portraits taken at to special times remember significant or occasions such as, religious festivities, birthdays, weddings, social events.\n\nThe First World War popularised portrait photography and many portrait studio businesses started up. They offered service men portrait photographs that would be given to wives, sweethearts and families as a keep sake, and the wives, sweethearts and families had their portraits taken to send to their ‘boys’. Also when troops were overseas photographic businesses set up to take portraits of the soldiers to send back to show how well they were getting on.\n\nAs photography developed, equipment became smaller, portable and more affordable more people could take their own photographs on holidays the formal family portrait photographs became less popular, the candid shots of family members having fun took over.\n\nPortrait photography is still considered an important role in business and education. Schools regularly employ the services of photographic companies to take portraits of children for their school records and as a means of raising school funds. Businesses use portrait photographs for publicity material, press releases and photographic ID.\n\nThe government uses portrait photographs for photographic identity for passports, driving licences, and disabled car badges etc. These photographs are very prescriptive and have rules that have to be followed, they are designed for identification purposes, not artistic interpretation or quality.\n\nFamous portrait photographers:\n\nRichard Avedon (1923-2004), American photographer, born and lived in New York. http://www.avedonfoundation.org/ Plain white sometimes grey background studio portraits. High contrast that shows the subjects facial features, wrinkles and freckles. Some of the portraits the subjects are holding or carrying items such as a butcher wearing blood stained apron and cleaver, soldiers carrying guns. The majority are solo portraits of people Avedon though interesting to photograph, some of the subjects were famous and influential people such as Andy Warhol, Ronald Reagan. There portraits that have more than one person such as Duke & Duchess of Windsor (Edward & Mrs Simpson).\n\nI like the style of clear backgrounds the sharp focusing in on the subject, for the individuals that I don’t recognise I wonder and want to know the story behind the photograph, why that person?\n\nDavid Bailey (1938- ), http://www.davidbaileyphotography.com/ English photographer famous for photographing the swinging 60s, celebrities and pop stars of the 1960s and 1970s. These works were mostly black and white photographs with white backgrounds. His more recent portrait works are mostly colour, with backgrounds that set a scene or attempt to tell a story about the subject. The stark white backgrounds, B+W photos with high contrast are similar in style as Avedon.\n\nhttp://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp05044&role=art&wPage=0\n\nBert Stern.

I set my camera up on a tripod for stability and so I could focus the area I was planning to be posing when the camera took the photograph. I had the assistance of someone else to press the shutter release.\n\nHow do these photographs represent me?\n\nI have chosen these 4 photographs for my quadriptych to represent. They were taken in the summer because they describe me well. They all have a quality of innocence.\n\nI love the warmth of the summer. The large photograph of me I am looking skywards, I have a questioning expression on my face, I am wondering what I should be doing or day dreaming.\n\nThe top right picture I am looking away, not making eye contact, this represents my reserved nature and shyness. I look to be higher up in the tree to signify my head in the clouds.\n\nThe middle right picture I have my head down signifying I am trying hard, I always put the effort in, even if I do not fully understand what I am trying to do.\n\nThe bottom right picture I am not in full frame, this represents the fact that I do not always see the full picture or understand, even when I am looking straight at something.\n\nWhat worked well?\n\nThe sense of light and summer, the pale tones. The use of a large f/stop aperture to give a shallow depth of field so the distant backgrounds are out of sharp focus. This means you focus on the face more. The fact the 4 photographs were taken at the same time so that the lighting, surroundings and clothes did not change.\n\nThe composition of 4 photographs, 1 portrait and 3 landscape looks good, it gives a balance grouping, and better than trying to put the 4next to each other in a row. I like the fact that I am looking up at myself in the large photo, and looking down on myself from the middle photo.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nThe photographs look slight pale and over exposed. I could have tried a slower ISO light sensitivity. Also the focus is not as sharp as I would like when examined close-up. This was probably due tome trying to focus the camera where I thought I would be posing, then I would try and stand where I had pre-focused.\n\nThe framing of the bottom photograph, part of my face is out of frame, this cuts off my mouth and part of the right side of my face.\n\nThe Genius of Photography, a BBC documentary series from 2006. The programs are about the history and social impact of photography.\n\nThe program record the early development of photography by Fox Talbot in 1834 and Louis Daguerre in 1839. Bothindependently invented photographic process that enabled the creation of an image without having to draw or paint.\n\nPhotography was discovered at a time where industrialisation and mechanisation was taking off, scientific discoveries and inventions were increasing rapidly. Photography had is role in all of these helping scientific understanding such as movement by a series of photographs by Eadweard Muybridge who took a series of photographs to show how horses (1879), animals and people move.\n\nPhotography as a form of capturing and documenting details and recording architecture, nature, people and places, industrial buildings.\n\nThe role of photography has been used to carefully record and catalogue pure documents, just the facts, no artistic interpritation or emotional involvement, pure observation, so that things can be compared. This is called Typology, it has been used in industrial photography .\n\nAugust Sander attempted human typology, he was an obsessive collector of photographs of people, he had 7 types of photographs, he took for farmers: the farmer, children with mother, person at work, head person, members of family at sport. His style of framing was consistant so that a baker could be comapred with grocer or a farmer.\n\nHow photography has been used to for documenting events, social, political, acts of war and acts of peace and natural disasters or acts of aggression or terrorism, travel and touristic sites of interest. A vehicle for propaganda.\n\nIt has become a major method of capturing and spreading news event stories with photojournalism.\n\nPhotography used to record facts and evidence used in criminal cases from such things as war crimes to forensic evidence.\n\nIt has become democratising as photography moved from the elitist specialist individual, professional or keen amateur to the mass population being able to own a camera and take pictures. This came about by the mass production of cheap cameras and roll film invented by George Eastman who created the “Kodak” company.\n\nThe importance people put on photographs to keep memories of members of families and friends, holidays and parties and great moments in history that are recorded not just by the professional by many people.\n\nThe series explores photography that developed into an art form from the eraly days of photography. It discusses some of the creative and inventive photographers such as Man Ray and his experimental darkroom techniques, the photograms he created and how it became part of the Dada and surrealist art movement. The development process solarisation that Man Ray created.\n\nThe programs discusses how photographers have been inspired by artists, the places and views, style and composition. Photographers have created similar works, and how in doing so tell different stories within their pictures, “transforming what it describes” What is included in a picture and what is left out, capturing a moment in time. photographers such as Andre Kertesz\n\nThe socialist political movement of Russia, the role of photography was declared to replace the subjective nature of art and painting. The photograph was the harsh reality. The photographer Alaxander Rodechenko was a new society socialist photographer using small light weight Leica cameras and easy to use and frame pictures through a viewfinder. Rodenchenko created montages combining several images together to make compositions to represent ideas and in his case for propaganda.\n\nEugène Atget a French photographer recorded and documented the streets, business and buildings of Paris from 1897 until his death in 1927. He wanted to create a record of Paris and how it changed over time, as buildings were torn down and replaced. Atget used old photographic equipment and processes that were popular in the 1850s, Atget did not learn or adopt modern developments in photography. For this reason the 1000’s of photographs he took all have the same qualties and style.\n\nWalker Evans an American photographer was a prodergy of Atget. He was influenced by his style to catalogue and capture carefully images of America. In 1930s he was commisened by the US government FSA to take propoganda documentary photographs to support resettlement of Americans following the dust bowel disaster\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/photography/genius/\n\nEpisode 1 – Fixing the shadows.

I set all the opacity to around 50% (Layers > Opacity 50%). I varied the opacity so that no one image over powered the others.\n\nI selected a layer and increased the opacity so that the image layer becomes more dominent and visible above the other images. I saved the merged layered composition.\n\nI reset the dominent image opacity back to the previous level, selected the next image and increased the opacity so that it became more dominent and showed more, saved the modified layered composition as a new image.\n\nI then repeated the process so that I had in total 4 compositions that looked different although they were made up of the same images.\n\nWhat do these pictures make you think of?\n\n3 of the 4 pictures remind me of fear and punishment. The person standing in the middle wearing a blind fold looks like they are about to be punished . This is reinforced by the faint images of someone about to have their hair chopped.\n\nWhat worked well?\n\nI believe this worked well because I have managed to show and display destruction through the series of pictures. Different elements are more visible by the change in opacity of the mergerd images.\n\nWhat didn’t work so well?\n\nThe 4th image bottom right image, there is not a large spalsh of red that can been seen in the other 3 images. The last image all there is also a lot of elements are showing making it difficult to focus on any one thing.\n\nDo these pictures fit in with your theme?\n\nThese pictures fit in with my theme of the self and destroy, this is because I have slowly made the pictures harder to see through the photos"
