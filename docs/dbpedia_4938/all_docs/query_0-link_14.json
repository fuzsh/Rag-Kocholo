        "text": "About 100th Birthday of Inge Morath\n\nInge Morath, one of the most renowned Austrian photographers, would have celebrated her 100th birthday on 27 May.\n\nShe was born in Graz in 1923 and grew up in Germany. She studied languages and journalism in Berlin, and after the war she worked as a journalist and translator in Salzburg and Vienna. She wrote articles on pictures by the photographer Ernst Haas for the Magnum photo agency, and in the 1950s she began taking photographs herself and became one of the first female photographers to work for the Magnum agency.\n\nOn the set of the film \"Misfits\" she met the American writer Arthur Miller, who was still married to the leading actress Marilyn Monroe at the time. Her marriage to Miller, which took place in 1962, lasted until her death in 2002 in New York. Inge Morath is best known for her portraits of well-known contemporary celebrities, but she also travelled extensively and created photographic travelogues and pictorial reports of everyday scenes."
