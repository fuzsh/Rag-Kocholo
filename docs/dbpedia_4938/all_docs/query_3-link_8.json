        "text": "Street Photography is one of the most challenging and exciting genres of photography. Sometimes when we see a photo, it gets into our mind and remains eternal for life. This could be moments of sorrow and pain, a disaster happening in the world, usual human interaction in our society, or even a moment of everyday life.\n\nHaving awareness of photography history and the famous actors of that history will definitely make you a better photographer. If you are trying to capture perfect photographs, knowing the masters of photography will show you what makes a photograph perfect.\n\nIn this article, we will introduce some of impressive master women photographers in this genre.\n\nStay with us.\n\nBerenice Abbott\n\nBerenice Alice Abbott (July 17, 1898 – December 9, 1991) was an American photographer. Abbott’s work often focused more on cityscapes, social documentary and street photography. Her introduction to photography came when she made contact with the famed Surrealist Man Ray, who hired her as a darkroom assistant in 1923. It was in 1925 at the Man Ray Studio that Abbott first saw photographs by Eugène Atget.\n\nIn 1929, Abbot began documenting the city in the manner of her of one of her major influences Eugène Atget. The impact of Atget’s photographs on Abbott was immediate: “There was a sudden flash of recognition – the shock of realism unadorned.” Abbott was part of the straight photography movement which stressed the importance of photographs being unmanipulated in both subject matter and developing processes. Today, Abbott’s photographs are held in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, among others.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“The challenge for me has first been to see things as they are, whether a portrait, a city street, or a bouncing ball. In a word, I have tried to be objective. What I mean by objectivity is not the objectivity of a machine, but of a sensible human being with the mystery of personal selection at the heart of it. The second challenge has been to impose order onto the things seen and to supply the visual context and the intellectual framework – that to me is the art of photography.”\n\nDiane Arbus\n\nDiane Arbus (March 14, 1923, July 26, 1971). She is one of the most original and influential artists of the twentieth century. She studied photography with Berenice Abbott, Alexey Brodovitch, and Lisette Model and had her first published photographs appear in Esquire in 1960. In 1963 and 1966 she was awarded John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships and was one of three photographers whose work was the focus of New Documents, John Szarkowski’s legendary exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1967. Arbus’s depictions of couples, children, female impersonators, nudists, New York City pedestrians, suburban families, circus performers, and celebrities, among others, span the breadth of the postwar American social sphere and constitute a diverse and singularly compelling portrait of humanity.\n\nQuote:\n\n“Freaks was a thing I photographed a lot. It was one of the first things I photographed, and it had a terrific kind of excitement for me. I just used to adore them. I still do adore some of them.”\n\nDorothea Lange\n\nDorothea Lange (May 26, 1895 – October 11, 1965) was an American documentary photographer and photojournalist. Lange’s photography focused more on capturing the struggles and realities of everyday life, often inrural settings or migrant camps, rather than the urban environments commonly associated with street photography. She studied photography at Columbia University in New York City under Clarence H. White, a member of the Photo-Secession group. She photographed endow her work with unforgettable power.\n\nFSA director Roy Stryker considered her most famous portrait, Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California (1936), to be the iconic representation of the agency’s agenda. The work now hangs in the Library of Congress. In 1940, Lange became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in photography. In 1953–54 she worked with Edward Steichen on “The Family of Man,” an exhibition organized by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. Steichen included several of her photographs in the show. Over the next 10 years she traveled the world, photographically documenting countries throughout Asia, notably South Asia, the Middle East, and South America. She produced other work, including the images of home and family life published in American Country Woman (1964).\n\nQuote:\n\n“The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.”\n\nEsther Bubley\n\nEsther Bubley (February 16, 1921 – March 16, 1998) was an American photographer. Bubley’s photography often included street scenes and urban settings. Her work captured the broader spectrum of human experience, encompassing both public and private moments in diverse environments. Having developed an interest in photography in high school, Bubley received her big break in 1942, when she was hired as a darkroom assistant for Roy Stryker, the famed head of the photographic unit of the Office of War Information (OWI) in Washington, D.C. With Stryker’s guidance, Bubley embarked on her first assignments documenting wartime in the nation’s capital.\n\nShe worked for several agencies of the American government and her work also featured in several news and photographic magazines. She was also a “people photographer” with an uncanny ability to achieve intimacy withher subjects. In 1955, Steichen included her work in his monumental The Family of Man exhibition. Bubley was a superb photographer, capable of creating striking modernist patterns in black and white and color under technically challenging conditions.\n\nQuote:\n\n“Put me down with people, and it’s just overwhelming,”\n\nEvelyn Hofer\n\nEvelyn Hofer (January 21, 1922 – November 2, 2009) was a German-American documentary photographer. Hofer’s work has influenced such photographers as Thomas Struth, Joel Sternfeld, Adam Bartos, Rineke Dijkstra, Judith Joy Ross, and Alex Soth. A street photographer of a different stripe, Hofer’s street pictures convey the artist’s concern with sociological connections and offer a pointed look at society and its conditions. Her trades-people and toffs, her families and social groups are more than just intimate portraits – they epitomize the possibilities and restrictions of the human condition. Hofer’s studies covered everything from photographic technique to art theory. She didn’t just learn composition and the underlying theories of aesthetics, she also learned the chemistry involved in producing prints. Beginning in the early 1960s she became one of the first fine art photographers to adopt the use of color film and the complicated dye transfer printing process as a regular practice.\n\nThroughout her long career, Hofer continued to shoot in both color and black and white – determining which was the more apt for the picture at hand.In the middle 1950s Hofer’s career took an important turn when the writer Mary McCarthy asked her to provide the photographs for The Stones of Florence, a literary exploration of the history and culture of that city. Over the next forty years Hofer collaborated with writers including V.S. Pritchett and Jan (James) Morris to produce books on Spain, Dublin, New York City, London, Paris, Switzerland, and Washington, D.C. in which she mixed portraits and land or cityscape. Hofer’s goal was to go beyond documentary photography to create a subjective interpretation of the world, conveying both the spirit of the time and a timeless message.\n\nQuote:\n\n“One reason I like to work with a big camera is that I don’t like to spy on people…I respect them and I want them to respect what we are doing together.”\n\nHelen Levitt\n\nHelen Levitt (August 31, 1913 – March 29, 2009) was an American photographer and cinematographer. She was particularly noted for her iconic street photography around New York City and most well known for taking pictures of children playing in the streets. She began photography when she was eighteen and attended many classes and events hosted by Manhattan Film and Photography League. Inspired by earlier masters such as Walker Evans and Henri Cartier-Bresson, she took her 35-milimeter camera to the streets, intimately capturing the daily activities of women, children, and minority communities. She became intrigued with the transitory chalk drawings that were part of the New York children’s street culture of the time. She began to photograph these chalk drawings, as well as the children who made them for her own creative assignment.\n\nShe also explored the uncanny elements of the everyday, often capturing people in strange poses alongside surreal juxtapositions of people, places, and things. The New York Times described her images as “fleeting moments of surpassing lyricism, mystery, and quiet drama.” Levitt was one of the early pioneers of colour street photography and one of the first photographers to exhibit her colour work in 1974. In 1959 and 1960, she received two grants from the Guggenheim Foundation for her pioneering work in color photography.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“It would be mistaken to suppose that any of the best photography is come at by intellection; it is like all art, essentially the result of an intuitive process, drawing on all that the artist is rather than on anything he thinks, far less theorizes about.\n\n“I go where there’s a lot of activity. Children used to be outside. Now the streets are empty. People are indoors looking at television or something.”\n\nVivian Maier\n\nVivian Dorothy Maier (February 1, 1926 – April 21, 2009) was an American street photographer whose work was discovered and recognized after her death. She is often referred to as the Mary Poppins of Street Photography on account of the fact that she spent most of her career working as a nanny. She also produced a number of self-portraits (black-and-white and color) which have given the world a picture of an otherwise unknown, intensely private figure. During her lifetime, Maier’s photographs were unknown and unpublished; many of her negatives were never developed.\n\nA Chicago collector, John Maloof, acquired some of Maier’s photos in 2007, while two other Chicago-based collectors, Ron Slattery and Randy Prow, also found some of Maier’s prints and negatives in her boxes and suitcases around the same time. Photographer Mary Ellen Mark has compared her work to that of Helen Levitt , Robert Frank, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus. Joel Meyerowitz, also a street photographer, has said that Maier’s work was “suffused with the kind of human understanding, warmth and playfulness that proves she was ‘a real shooter’.”\n\nQuotes:\n\n“I’m a sort of spy.”"
