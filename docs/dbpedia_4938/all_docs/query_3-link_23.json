        "text": "The New York Public Library has acquired by gift, and through the generosity of his family, Arthur Miller’s collection of his published plays, books, translations, anthologies, and other publications relating to his work in various editions, comprising 692 volumes in total. Along with editions of his writings in English, the acquisition includes an extensive collection of translations into many European languages, plus Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and others. Several are inscribed with his name and other occasional annotations. Miller’s collection also contains essays, theatrical analysis and commentary, audio cassettes, magazines, and other ephemera, spanning the years 1928 – 2012. Also represented are a small number of works by other authors, among which four scripts by playwright Harold Pinter are of particular note.\n\nThe books will be added to the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, which contains some 35,000 printed volumes, pamphlets, and broadsides, and 2,000 linear feet of literary archives and manuscripts, representing the work of more than 400 authors. The Berg has long collected books from the libraries of significant authors and literary figures, such as Vladimir Nabokov, Jack Kerouac, Lady Gregory, and Kenneth Koch. Other highlights of the acquisition include:\n\nPersonalized copies of Miller’s novels – including a 1951 edition of An Enemy of the People, inscribed to Marilyn Monroe, and a 2001 edition of On Politics and the Art of Acting to Inge Morath.\n\nExtensive translations of Miller’s work, including nine translations of The Crucible (Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish).\n\n“Death of a Salesman in Scandinavia” – a box of newspaper clippings, theatre programmes, and other ephemera primarily related to a touring production 1949-1950.\n\nCape Cod Theatre Project in Falmouth, MA, will debut four in-development scripts this summer through July weekend readings. There will still be discussion afterwards, and separate chats with playwrights and directors. On July 23 and 25 2020: Kevin Artigue’s based-on-history “I, My Ruination” is set in the 1950s, when director Elia Kazan faces a second visit to the House Un-American Activities Committee and is visited by playwright Arthur Miller. Featuring Paul Giamatti as Kazan and Corey Stoll as Miller! Also with Nina Arianda, Arian Moayed, and Pedro Pascal. Shows and talkbacks will be streamed online at 7 p.m. Thursdays and Saturdays. The series is a benefit for CCTP so admission is by suggested donation: $25 per play, $100 for a full pass. Information and access for all: capecodtheatreproject.org. Seems to have sold out fast at the $25 rate but it looks like some passes for I, Ruination still available for a $50 donation at Vendini.\n\nA rather bizarre recent pop-culture reference to Miller is a scene in the Hulu series Devs, where an attempt is made to harness quantum computer power to spy on historical events–they go from watching Jesus dying on the cross to a scene one of them calls “The celebrity sex tape to end all celebrity sex tapes.” And they have a blurry scene of Miller and Monroe making love!!!\n\nTwo of the most intense and complicated relationships of Arthur Miller’s life were his friendship with Elia Kazan and his love for Marilyn Monroe. Miller discussed these himself in Timebends, and many commentators have sought additional information and perspectives on how these three lives intersected and evolved. Richard A. Schwartz, an emeritus professor at Florida International University, explores these relationships through the lens and insights that only literature can provide. In his newly published novel, Collaborators, he, “strives to remain historically accurate while imagining the characters’ interior lives as they attract and repel one another while negotiating their way through turbulent times.” The book is available on Amazon in both a paperback and a Kindle edition.\n\nJohn Proctor is the Villain by Kimberly Belflower, inspired by The Crucible was presented as a rolling world premiere in the Alliance Theatre’s 2020-21 season of their Classic Remix Project, on Hertz Stage, 1280 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta, GA. Call 404-733-5000 or check their website for updates. Several other theaters have since picked this up including a production at Wake Forest University Theatre 4-23 Feb. 2022: Call the Theatre Box Office at (336) 758-5295 or purchase online at theatre.wfu.edu, and Studio Theatre 27 April-5 June 2022, in the Mead Theatre, 1501 14th St NW, Washington, DC. Directed by Marti Lyons, with set design by Luciana Stecconi (see above for cast). Call 202.332.3300 or check their website for more information. Huntington Theatre in Boston also offered an excellent production with their own cast in Feb. 2024 that had a near sell-out run.\n\nThe inaugural audio production for Sioux Empire Community Theatre presents Death of a Jazz Man, an apparently witty and hilarious retelling of the theatre classic Death of a Salesman. The entire 26 minute recording (2020) was done remotely, with members of the community theatre taking on all the roles of production and performance. With Jeff Gould, Emily Wilson, Robin Byrne, Jesse Jensen, Jordan Deffenbaugh, and music by Ryan Reiffenberger. Check the website to donate or their FaceBook page to hear the show.\n\nSalesman之死: The (Almost!)
