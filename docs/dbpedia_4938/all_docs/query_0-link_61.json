        "text": "Janna Ireland’s photographic practice is primarily concerned with the themes of family, home, and the expression of Black identity in American culture. In 2016, she began photographing structures designed by legendary Black architect Paul R. Williams.\n\nWhen visual artists make an image, they have to bring the inside outside by giving thoughts, fears, dreams, and life stories visible form. In this exhibition, each artwork has external signs telling about an inner world, whether real, fictional, or in-between.\n\nDrawing from the rich holdings of prints and 19th-early 20th century photographs in SBMA’s permanent collection, Copper Plate to Collotype makes visible the vibrant exchange between the two media.\n\nSince photography’s invention in 1839, photographers have attempted to reveal nothing less than the span of human experience. Spontaneously or deliberately composed, the photographs here demonstrate the camera’s all but unique ability to reflect, question, affirm, and sometimes revel in what it means to be present within a human form.\n\nThe first museum exhibition solely devoted to the photographs of renowned American abstract artist, Ellsworth Kelly (1923–2015), who used the camera to perceptively register his unique and acute perceptions of the everyday world.\n\nShowcasing masterpieces of Chinese painting spanning 500 years, this exhibition marks the first showing of works traveling from China to the U.S. since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nDrawing from the Santa Barbara Museum of Art’s permanent collection, this exhibition presents an illustrative selection of works by artists who have applied the framework of Conceptual art to the medium of photography.\n\nWith more than 90 works, this exhibition features many of the most beautiful and accomplished drawings created by the extraordinarily gifted, self-taught artist James Castle\n\nEarthenware. Stoneware. Kitchenware. Homeware. From ancient pottery for cooking and storage to modern decorative objects adorning the home, ceramics have a long, important history in domestic settings. This exhibition adds a contemporary twist to the association, with objects that signal an irreverent or even zany approach to the medium.\n\nThis exhibition compares and contrasts the visions of Lyonel Feininger and his son Andreas Feininger—two artists who depicted similar elements of their different worlds in entirely different media, but with the same effect of uniquely contributing to the advance of 20th-century Modernism and its forms and ideas.\n\nFeaturing works from the turn of the last century by Fernand Khnopff, Alfred Kubin, Odilon Redon, and Félicien Rops, as well as the Italian surrealist Giorgio Manzu and his Russian contemporaries, Ossip Zadkine and Alexander Archipenko, this exhibition dwells on the dark side of humanity through a host of cruel but unforgettable imagery.\n\nFeaturing nearly 80 photographs by Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Kwame Brathwaite, Nell Campbell, Awol Erizku, Janna Ireland, Aaron Siskind, and Hiroshi Sugimoto, among many artists, A Time of Gifts celebrates donors whose gifts of art and funds have allowed SBMA to add over 600 photographs to the collection since 2016.\n\nThrough opacity, portraiture can most fully and authentically represent the shadowy parts of a person, those hard-to-explain aspects that cannot otherwise be depicted in conventional ways.\n\nThis comprehensive presentation includes twenty-five artworks, including six recent acquisitions by SBMA, loans from the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, the Art Institute of Chicago, and a private collector.\n\nThis exhibition features the work of 19th-century photographers who sought to capture Europe’s Greco-Roman legacy, both in the countries of its origin and in modern monuments that adapted the visual style and aura of antiquity for reasons of political power and aesthetic legitimacy.\n\nLike the US dollar, air travel, and space satellites, abstract art encircled the globe or at least the capitalist West during the middle of the 20th century.\n\nA riveting array of media works by Petra Cortright, Diana Thater and Wu Chi-Tsung (many in SBMA’s collection) represent how the contemporary experience of the natural world has been shaped and influenced by current media technologies.\n\nFeaturing the work of 13 artists, this exhibition reveals an intriguing range of profound meanings that architecture can express when imaginatively captured by the photographic lens.\n\nJoining painting, sculpture, and film elements, contemporary artists have pushed the boundaries of photography into new terrain, melding materials and photography to construct painterly or sculptural objects, or constructing tableaux meant to be photographed and then later dismantled.\n\nFrom the spontaneous and joyous to the posed and quiet, renowned photographer Santi Visalli’s portraits all relay a storia, an Italian word meaning tale, story, and history. This select exhibition features 29 perceptive portraits of well-known figures in the 1960s and 70s worlds of film, literature, art, music, and popular culture.\n\nThis exhibition of 25 photographs from SBMA’s collection features the human face as its captivating subject. Artists include Kwame Brathwaite, Tseng Kwong-Chi, Genevieve Gaignard and Trude Fleischmann, whose work engages photography’s unique ability to suggest narrative, biography and psychology via the photographic portrait.\n\nOne of the few women members of the renowned Magnum agency in early-1950s Paris, Austrian-born Inge Morath became a leading international photographer in the second half of the 20th century. This exhibition features 15 classic Morath images of people and places from a 1977 portfolio and her iconic vision of a llama in a Times Square car.\n\nIn celebration of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art’s 75th Anniversary in 2016, this installation highlights some of the most celebrated works of art from SBMA’s permanent collection, as well as several of the most exciting gifts and acquisitions in the areas of modern and contemporary art, photography, and the arts of Asia.\n\nThe first solo U.S. museum exhibition of Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima’s art in over two decades, this captivating immersive presentation of four light-based works embodies this internationally renowned artist’s career-long philosophy: Keep Changing, Connect with Everything, Continue Forever.\n\nDrawing primarily from SBMA's permanent collection and supplemented by loans from area collections, this exhibition explores a diverse range of artistic representations of the cosmos roughly coinciding with the 'Space Age' of the last sixty years.\n\nThis exciting exhibition offers viewers an experience of color photographs by emerging and established artists, presenting with around 30 works a select traversal through the history of color photography from its origins as an accepted artistic tool in the 1960s and 70s, up to today’s most conceptually-driven practices.\n\nIlluminating the hidden peculiarities of everyday life, this installation of 13 photographs by Manuel Álvarez Bravo reveals how this internationally renowned photographer embraced European Cubism and Surrealism while maintaining a focus on Mexican subject matter such as religious rituals, agricultural scenes, and cityscapes.\n\nThe malleable interior of traditional Japanese houses could be redecorated to suit particular purposes — at times adorning with glistening screens and objects of color and gold. This exhibition explores the aesthetics of these public and private interiors by featuring folding screens, scrolls, and examples of lacquerware.\n\nIn this installation of paintings, drawn exclusively from the permanent collection, a range of European and American artists employ various motifs in order to capture the picturesque effects of snowfall.\n\nThe tumultuous period between the two World Wars is the backdrop for this intimately scaled and timely exhibition, which explores the little known relationship between modern art and totalitarianism in the work of the French Fauves, Maurice de Vlaminck (1876-1958) and André Derain (1880-1954).\n\nInspired by several large drawings in the Santa Barbara Museum of Art’s permanent collection, this exhibition demonstrates a variety of experimental practices during the 1970s and represents images and issues relevant to contemporary art and culture.\n\nBefore the invention of photography, painted portraits were the most coveted means of commemorating important members of society. This exhibition, drawn exclusively from the permanent collection, explores American, British and French portraitists from the Colonial period through the Industrial Revolution.\n\nAssembling striking works from the Santa Barbara Museum of Art’s distinguished collection, this exhibition reveals how photographic portraiture blossomed in the later six decades of the 19th century.\n\nDrawn entirely from the Santa Barbara Museum of Art’s distinguished and growing collection, this extensive exhibition of over 100 photographs by approximately a dozen artists reveals unusual facets of the work of well-known artists, as well as new-to-the-collection photographs that will be on view for the very first time in the SBMA’s galleries.\n\nBritish artist Yinka Shonibare's grand photograph The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (Asia) (2008) provided the inspiration for this installation of photographs that conjure up scenes of unease and the uncanny, which—despite our best efforts to rationally dispel them—can seem to surround us every day.\n\nYou Are Going On A Trip brings together a selection of highlights from the Museum’s wide-ranging collection of Modern and Contemporary prints.\n\nA landmark in the history of video art, Christian Marclay’s Telephones (1995) is an expertly edited sequence of black-and-white and color film clips featuring people dialing, answering, talking, listening on, and finally hanging up an assortment of telephones, all from the pre-smart phone era.\n\nJapanese paper stencils, or katagami, are the pattern-bearing tools used in a resist-dyeing textile process known as katazome. Despite their utilitarian role, katagami, with their striking patterns, have long captivated Western collectors and artists.\n\nDavid Wiesner (b. 1956) is one of the most highly acclaimed picture book artists in the world. Winner of the prestigious Caldecott Medal for Tuesday in 1992, The Three Pigs in 2002, and Flotsam in 2007, Wiesner is only the second person in the history of the award to have received it three times.\n\nInspired by an affirmation of the classical, employing the space that traditionally houses SBMA’s Wright Ludington/Lansdowne Collection of Greco-Roman antiquities (currently on view at the Getty Center), and extending the celebration of SBMA’s 75th anniversary, Judith Shea’s iconic Mid-Life Venus was recently installed in Ludington Cour\n\nA diverse selection of works on paper by contemporary artists who rose to prominence in emerging Los Angeles galleries in the early 1990s through the mid-2000s. Featuring Ingrid Calame, David Korty, Aaron Morse, Jon Pylypchuk, Dario Robleto, Thomas Scheibitz, Jeni Spota, and others.\n\nCurated by art historian Peyton Skipwith and drawn entirely from the permanent collection of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, this selection of some 50 paintings, drawings, and sculptures presents an overview of British art from around 1890 through 1945.\n\nIn this unique presentation, artist Jan Tichy (b. 1974, Czech, resides in Chicago) has devised a special installation in direct response to the Museum’s current position in its 75-year history―on the brink of a transformative renovation, with the vibration and sound of concrete demolition palpable.\n\nThis exhibition celebrates the complexity of South Asian representation and iconography by examining the relationship between aesthetic expression and the devotional practice, or puja, in the three native religions of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nCommissioned by SBMA and presented in the Museum’s historic Ludington Court, this installation represents the most recent work in a series of oversize, inflatable sculptures by the artist based on the figure of the 12th-century Buddha at Gal Vihara in Sri Lanka.\n\nThis exhibition, drawn from the permanent collection of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, highlights works by Latin American photographers, or artists who have adopted it as home, so that those from outside the region may look into the lives of Latin America.\n\nThis site-specific installation reveals the artist’s ongoing investigation into what he calls object prosthetics – the reconstruction of broken remains using a variety of conceptual and technological methods.\n\nUsing distinctive materials including Day-Glo acrylics and Roll-a-Tex, Peter Halley’s paintings present variations of geometric forms that he and others have designated as prisons, cells, and conduits.\n\nA selection of etchings by Venetian-born printmaker Giovanni Battista Piranesi reveal the architecture of his ambitious imagination – evoking its spectacular sublimity – and elicit awe in and passion for the architectural traditions of Rome.\n\nFeaturing paintings from The Armand Hammer Foundation that complement works from the Museum’s collection, this exhibition presents a representative overview of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism with a nod to the schools of Barbizon and Romanticism that prepared the way.\n\nVisions of Modernity, presented in a series of rotations, explores the creative process of printmaking in the first half of the 20th century in Japan.\n\nTwelve photomontages by Bauhaus artist Herbert Bayer grapple with memory and the dilemmas posed by individuality and national identity to recover some of the wonder – and dread – of the rapidly shifting dynamics of modern German history.\n\nOrganized by guest curator Joyce Tsai and Chief Curator and Asst. Director Eik Kahng, this is the first monographic exhibition of Bauhaus artist László Moholy-Nagy to explore how the practice of painting served as the means for the artist to imagine generative relationships of art and technology.\n\nOn view in this exhibition, one of the best collections of Italian painting in the world, with 50 works spanning 500 years of Italian art history, offers a unique opportunity to learn firsthand what made the Italian Renaissance a gold standard for artistic excellence.\n\nThis exhibition examines the lesser known yet foundational role of drawing in the artist’s work, which she continued to develop over the next eight decades.\n\nThis exhibition of over sixty images, largely drawn from the permanent collection, continues the exploration of the intersections of art and science, begun in 1967 when the Santa Barbara Museum of Art presented Once Invisible.\n\nSpanning the period from the late 1960s to the present day, this exhibition presents the work of an artist who radically combined site-specific earthworks with the medium of drawing. Michelle Stuart has become internationally known for a rich and diverse body of work engendered by her lifelong interest in the natural world and the cosmos.\n\nThis exhibition is the first comprehensive exploration of this vital aspect of the renowned sculptor’s creative process.\n\nPortraits of Jesus Christ, His mother and His saints invoke the presence of God, to whom every Christian prayer is addressed. Before the Reformation, such images were habitually used by believers all over Europe, both in church and in private.\n\nThis important and beautiful international loan exhibition, organized by SBMA Deputy Director and Chief Curator, Eik Kahng, marks the first presentation of the celebrated French artist Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) in the United States in over a decade, and the first major monographic show devoted to the Romantic artist on the West Coast.\n\nThis exhibition looks at the powerful relationship between color and memory by considering photographs and the ways in which their unique color palettes evoke specific moments of the historical past.\n\nThis exhibition features the work of artists who bring 21st-century urgency to 19th-century principles of virtue through work and craftsmanship.\n\nThis exhibition presents a selection of early modern paintings that celebrate the topography of California. By the end of the 19th century, landscape painting had become the primary vehicle for depicting national identity in American art.\n\nThis exhibition of more than 50 photographs and photographic montages, drawn from the artist’s studio and the Menil collection and spanning the period 1962 to the present, traces the fascinating and wide-ranging evolution of the career of New York- and New Mexico-based Danny Lyon.\n\nShowcasing the Museum’s significant collection of 20th-century Latin American art, this exhibition examines the multifaceted art produced in Latin America during this dynamic 60-year period.\n\nBetween the 1830s and the end of the First World War, American art came into its own.\n\nOri Gersht depicts scenes of natural beauty that perceptively disguise and reveal a history of violence.\n\nIn a sweeping career of nearly 50 years, and an impressive array of grand narrative paintings, Charles Garabedian (born 1923) has recreated the epic poetry that he has long admired."
