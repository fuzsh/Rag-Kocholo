        "text": "(1923 – 2002) was an Austrian-born photographer. In 1953, she joined the Magnum Photos Agency, founded by top photographers in Paris, and became a full photographer with them in 1955. Along with Eve Arnold, she was among the first women members. Magnum remains to this day a predominantly male organization.\n\nMorath’s work was motivated by a fundamental humanism, shaped as much by her experience of war as by its lingering shadow over post-war Europe. In Morath’s mature work, she documents the endurance of the human spirit under situations of extreme duress, as well as its manifestations of ecstasy and joy.\n\nIn 1955, she published her first collection of photographs, a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime. Morath was also the third and last wife of playwright Arthur Miller; their daughter is screenwriter/director Rebecca Miller.\n\nSelf-Portrait by Inge Morath, Jerusalem, 1958 via\n\nInge Morath, Portrait of Anais Nin, 1959 © Inge Morath © The Inge Morath Foundation via\n\nInge Morath, Gloria Vanderbilt New York, 1956 © Fotosammlung WestLicht, Wien via\n\nJayne Mansfield in bed in Beverly Hills, Inge Morath 1959 via\n\nAudrey Hepburn during the production of The Unforgiven, Durango, Mexico by Inge Morath 1959 via"
