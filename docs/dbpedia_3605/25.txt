The green forests, the griffon vultures, the blue lakes, the horses... our farm "Živa" (named after the ancient Slavic goddess of fertility) is located in Amzići village, on the edges of Uvac natural reserve, on the slopes of Zlatar mountain. We enjoy these natural treasures every day, on foot or from a horses back. Come and join us for a ride! There is a place for everyone...

Whether you are a rider or a non-rider, a single traveler or a group, we can design an immersive, natural experience just for you!

There are many things to do in and around our village besides horse riding!

From sharing our experience of moving away from the city and enjoying endless hikes to griffon vulture observation and visits to historical sites - there is something for everyone!
