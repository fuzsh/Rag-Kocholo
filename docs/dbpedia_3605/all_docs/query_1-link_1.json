        "text": "The presentation of the Education charter in 2003 in Portugal as an instrument for future planning of school network represented the beginning of a different phase in public Education policies, seen as a necessary step towards the modernization of the primary school network. More than a decade later, at the start of a new cycle in public Education policies, a second phase of the reorganization of the public-school network began, with the revision of the Education charters. This paper aims to carry out a comparative analysis of these two periods, based on a qualitative research conducted in 34 municipalities in Central Portugal, featuring different realities, to identify the main differences and similarities and to determine the influence of territorial and human factors on the solutions adopted. It seems possible to conclude that new municipal actions have emerged that prioritize planning aimed at local specificities, in contrast to the previous approach, focused on compliance with ...\n\nObjects of study aims to comprehend the integration of new man- agerial strategies in the administrative reform of public school, the imple- mentation of the NPM principles allowing the improvement of the quality of the piloting process and of pragmatic action-oriented mechanisms. This article studies the level of operationalization and the streamling of public administration management practices, while trying to identify constraints and assessing improvement plans. Theoretical Frame: The foundations of the study make it possible to balance the theoretical, empirical and scien- tific aspects of NPM. On a theoretical level, it offers a scope of analysis of new public management practices. We will also consider the doctrinal ap- proaches and principles in close relation to the school setting. Recommended Methodology: Our research methodology is an exploratory descriptive study, the data collection instruments are mainly the documentary study, the anal- ysis of management practices of ...\n\nThis article is the result of an investigation [1] that evaluated the school effectiveness in the municipal schools of Duque de Caxias that obtained the highest Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) in 2009 through the analysis of the factors that are directly associated to the effectiveness in schools, such as organization, school management, and pedagogical emphasis. Two schools were surveyed, intentionally chosen, because the purpose of the work was to map the effective strategies of educational management in schools with higher performance. The data are originated from quantitative and qualitative researches that were carried out in 2011 and 2012 in these schools. The results showed that the school effectiveness is due to the committed work of the team, the active role of the manager, the involvement of the family in school, the differentiated teaching methodologies, and the participatory planning. [1] Research carried out with funding of FAPERJ-Public notice APq1.\n\nPurpose-The purpose of this paper is to measure the efficiency performance of public sector-funded schools in Spain. Design/methodology/approach-Using school-level data from Program for International Student Assessment 2012, cross-sectional models were estimated using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Technical efficiencies of public sector-funded schools (public schools and centros concertados), and their determinants were estimated using a one-step maximum likelihood procedure. SFA models include both a stochastic error term and a term that can be characterized as inefficiency; the non-negative technical inefficiency effects are assumed to be a function of school characteristics. Findings-The results show that greater school autonomy and school responsibility for resource allocation are associated with efficiency improvement. Subsidized private schools (called centros concertados) were more efficient than public schools. The former are free of bureaucratic constraints that encumber public schools, and they are able to control many more decisions at the school level (e.g. they select their own teachers). Originality/value-This paper shows the value of school autonomy for educational performance. The author defines school autonomy as the operational empowerment of the principals and teachers. Therefore, the government could grant greater autonomy to public schools (school-based management), since school autonomy is a driver of efficiency. Further, teachers' morale is also an environmental driver of efficiency. Schools tend to be more efficient when teachers work with enthusiasm or value academic achievement. And this is more likely to occur in private schools, even though teachers are hired (they are not civil servants) and have a lower salary than public school teachers. The lack of motivation of many teachers in public schools may be in the absence of incentivesthere is no possibility of promotion and everyone is guaranteed a wage increase every three years-and in the bureaucratization of the public school system.\n\nThis article presents results of a doctoral thesis framed in the Portuguese educational policy of School Clusters (SC). Since 2010, the SC represents a new regulatory model of school organization that brings together multiple schools, at all levels of compulsory education and located in geographic proximity. Specifically, this research approaches this policy enactment in an SC located in Lisbon. The theoretical and methodological approach of the study is based on the contributions that Erhard Friedberg developed within the framework of the sociology of organizations. The publication is divided in two sections. First, the article introduces the SC policy and research carried out for this article. Then, the second section addresses Friedberg’s core conceptual categories. His concept of Concrete Action System allows analyzing through which actors and how the action is organized in the fictitiously named SC Margin. It is intended to show the potential that the sociology of organizations..."
