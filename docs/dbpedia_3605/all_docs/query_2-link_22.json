We enjoy these natural treasures every day, on foot or from a horses back. Come and join us for a ride! There is a place for everyone...\n\nWhether you are a rider or a non-rider, a single traveler or a group, we can design an immersive, natural experience just for you!\n\nThere are many things to do in and around our village besides horse riding!\n\nFrom sharing our experience of moving away from the city and enjoying endless hikes to griffon vulture observation and visits to historical sites - there is something for everyone!"
