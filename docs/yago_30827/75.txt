Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (German: Viktoria Adelheid Helene Luise Marie Friederike; 31 December 1885 – 3 October 1970) was Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as the consort of Duke Charles Edward from their marriage on 11 October 1905 until his abdication on 14 November 1918.

Victoria Adelaide's marriage to Charles Edward was arranged by German emperor, Wilhelm II. She was chosen for her perceived political loyalty to the Imperial German government and her symbolic significance as a German wife for the British-born duke. She was seen as unpretentious and gained popularity among the people of the Duchy. After his forced abdication in 1918, Charles Edward became an enthusiastic supporter of Nazism. Sources differ on how enthusiastically Victoria Adelaide supported these beliefs.
