        "text": "THREE PAGES FOR WOMEN\n\nNORWAY celebrated last Thursday the\n\nmarriage of its Crown Prince to a com-\n\nmoner. Although Prince Harold's choice\n\nof bride aroused some controversy and\n\ncriticism, most Norwegians approve the\n\nmatch.\n\nLove defeats\n\nFrom a Special Correspondent\n\nin Oslo\n\nTO be, or not to be a kingdom? From time to time Norwe-\n\ngians ask themselves this question, and it was raised again\n\nbefore the marriage last Thursday of Crown Prince Harald to\n\na commoner, Miss Sonja Haraldsen.\n\nAlthough the bride is\n\nattractive, charming and\n\nwell educated, opposition\n\nto the match has been\n\nso strong from some con-\n\nservative quarters that\n\nten years have elapsed\n\nbetween the 31-year-old\n\ncouple's first meeting\n\nand the celebration of\n\ntheir marriage.\n\nThere are older Nor-\n\nwegians who are so\n\nproud of the strong links\n\nthat their royal family\n\nhas with the other royal\n\nfamilies of Europe that\n\nthey believe Crown\n\nPrince Harald should\n\nhave given up his claim\n\nto the throne rather than\n\nmarry a commoner.\n\nnone Help\n\nOne elderly woman, on\n\nhearing from an approv-\n\ning hairdresser the news\n\nof the engagement, was\n\nso indignant that she\n\nflounced out of the salon,\n\ncurlers and all, and was\n\nnever seen ther again.\n\nSuch diehard conserva-\n\ntism is matched only by\n\nthose Norwegians who,\n\nwhile approving of Har-\n\nald's choice of a Nor-\n\nwegian girl in preference\n\nto some foreign princess,\n\nthink that the name\n\n\"Sonja\" is too Russian\n\nand should be changed.\n\nIt is surprising that there\n\nshould be such an old\n\nfashioned royalist element\n\nin Norway. All aristocratic\n\ntitles were abolished as\n\nlong ago as 1818 and the\n\npresent royal family has\n\nbeen on the Norwegian\n\nthrone only since 1905,\n\nwhen Norway achieved\n\nfull independence after\n\ncenturies of domination\n\nfirst by Denmark and then\n\nby Sweden.\n\nPrince Carl, son of\n\nOpposition overcome: Crown Prince Harald of Norway and Crown Princess Sonfa, for merly Miss Sonfa Haraldsen, wave to cheering crowds as they drive'from Oslo Cathedral to the royal castle after their wedding last Thursday. Help\n\nOpposition overcome: Crown Prince Harald of Norway and Crown Princess Sonja, for-\n\nmerly Miss Sonja Haraldsen, wave to cheering crowds as they drive'from Oslo Cathedral\n\nto the royal castle after their wedding last Thursday.\n\nCrown Princc Frederick\n\nof Denmark, was asked to\n\nbecome king of the newly\n\nindependent Norway. He\n\nagreed on condition that\n\nthe people showed their\n\napproval of this choice by\n\nreferendum. They voted\n\nfor him by 259,563 votes\n\nto 69,264.\n\nPrincess May (later\n\nQueen Mary of England)\n\nwrote to an aunt of this\n\nroyal election, \"The whole\n\nthing seems curious, but\n\nwe live in very modern\n\ntimes\".\n\nPrince Carl changed his\n\nname to King Haakon\n\nVII and embarked on a\n\nreign which was to last 50\n\nyears. Because the present\n\nNorwegian royal family is\n\nidentified with Norway's\n\nachievement of independ-\n\nence, Norwegians mostly\n\nhave regarded their mon-\n\narchy in a favourable light.\n\nIt was, however, during\n\nWorld War II that\n\nKing Haakon became the\n\nsymboJ of national unity.\n\nAfter fleeing to England\n\nwith the rightful Norwe-\n\ngian government, he said\n\nhe would rather \"renounce\n\nthe throne of Norway for\n\nhimself and his house\"\n\nthan give his approval to\n\nthe appointment of Viktin\n\nQuisling as Prime Minister\n\nof Norway under the Ger-\n\nman Occupation.\n\nThe people of Norway\n\nhad had no voice in such\n\nan appointment, he said.\n\nThe $34.25 million which\n\nhe and his Government\n\ntook with them from the\n\nNorwegian Treasury went\n\ntowards opposing the\n\nGermans.\n\nAs in the rest of Scandi-\n\nnavia, there are some\n\npeople who feel that mon-\n\narchy is an anachronism\n\nin a modern democracyâ€”\n\nbut they seem to be in a\n\nminority. With the other\n\nScandinavian countries,\n\nthe Norwegians share a\n\ntradition of democratic\n\nmonarchy which stretches\n\nback 10 centuries to when\n\nthe Viking kings and free-\n\nmen first worked out to-\n\ngether their respective\n\nroles in the State.\n\nThe socialist Working\n\nParty expressed cool ap-\n\nproval of the concept of"
