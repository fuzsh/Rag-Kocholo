        "text": "THERE are no people in the\n\nworld more loyal than the\n\nDanes.\n\nDenmark's King Christian was one\n\nof the best-loved monarchs of his\n\ntory.\n\nBut it's Denmark, too, that claims,\n\nmost unwillingly, the princess whom\n\nnobody loves.'\n\nJust recently she returned from\n\nexile to visit the bedside of her dying\n\nhusband, Prince Harald, brother of\n\nKing Christian, and also of King\n\nHaakon, of Norway.\n\nThere was no warmth, no wel-\n\ncome for her on her return; nothing\n\nbut cold, polite formality;\n\nThe atmosphere was strangely dif-\n\nferent from that which first wel-\n\ncomed her to Denmark, the gay,\n\nmerry German-born Helena, Prin-\n\ncess of Sonderburg-Glucksburg.\n\nIt was different, too, from that\n\nin which she had moved in the early\n\nyears of her marriage; and in which\n\nshe had brought up her children\n\nthe Princes Oluf and Gorm, the Prin\n\ncesses Feodora, Carolina Matilda, and\n\nAlexandrina Louisa.\n\nHatred didn't touch her through\n\nout World War I, when Denmark\n\npreserved an uneasy neutrality.\n\nBut when Nazi planes first flew\n\nover Copenhagen, she was lunching .\n\non the terrace with a group of\n\nfriends. She looked up and said:\n\n\"Aren't our planes wonderful?''\n\nA Danish officer reproved her. He\n\nsaid: \"Madame,, please remember\n\nthat you are now a Danish princess,''.\n\nand left the party.\n\nShe entertained . the Nazi con-\n\nquerors. She was the one rift in the\n\nlute of the Danish ruling family.\n\nPrincess Helena will never be wel-\n\ncomed back to Denmark."
