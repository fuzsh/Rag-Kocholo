The eldest daughter of Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his wife Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, she was born at Gut Grünholz in Schleswig-Holstein and grew up at Glücksburg Castle. In 1905, Princess Victoria Adelaide married Charles Edward, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Albany, the only son of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont and a grandson of Queen Victoria. The couple had five children, including Princess Sibylla of Sweden, and were the Reigning Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, spending the winter and spring in Gotha and the summer and autumn in Coburg, until 1918, after which they retained much of their wealth and property, including Veste Coburg and Schloss Callenberg in Coburg, Reinhardsbrunn Castle in Gotha and Schloss Greinburg in Austria, though their British Dukedom had been lost in 1917. While the Duke grew in the ranks of the Nazi Party, the Duchess was not as keen, and even defied him by supporting the German Evangelical Church Confederation against the antisemitic German Christians. After the Second World War, the Duke was imprisoned and charged with crimes against humanity, and later heavily fined, also losing much of their property in Germany, and passing away in reduced circumstances in 1954. The Duchess, who had stayed with her husband through all these hardships, moved to Schloss Greinburg in Austria, where she passed away on this day in 1970.\n\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha Turquoise Tiara | Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Diamond Tiara | Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Emerald Necklace Tiara\n\nHistory of Royal Women"
