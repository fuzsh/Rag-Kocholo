        "text": "After writing my blog about Victoria, I received the request to tell more about her children. Are they married? Did they have children? With pleasure, I will tell you more about the nine children of Victoria & Albert.\n\n1) Victoria, Princess Royal\n\nVictoria Adelaide Mary Louisa (London, 21 November 1840 – Kronberg im Taunus, 5 August 1901), was the oldest child of Victoria and Albert. After the birth of her brother in 1841, she received the title Princess Royal of the United Kingdom. Her nickname in the family was Vicky.\n\nVicky already met her future husband, Prince Frederick William of Prussia, at eleven during the World Exhibition that took place in London. They became engaged in 1855 when Frederik paid a visit to Balmoral Castle. Vicky was only fourteen years old at the time, while her husband was twenty-four years old. They eventually married on January 25, 1858. It was a love marriage, but it also had clear political advantages. The couple had 9 children:\n\nWilhelm II, German Emperor (1859-1941)\n\nCharlotte, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (1860-1919)\n\nPrince Henry of Prussia (1862-1929)\n\nPrince Sigismund of Prussia (1864-1866)\n\nViktoria, Princess Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe (1866-1929)\n\nPrince Waldemar of Prussia (1868-1879)\n\nSophia, Queen of the Hellenes (1870-1932)\n\nMargaret, Landgravine of Hesse (1872-1954)\n\nOn January 18, 1871, the German Empire was founded in the castle of Versailles and Frederick and Victoria were then given the title German Crown Prince and Crown Princess. When on March 9, 1888 Frederick’s father died, they became emperor and empress. Unfortunately their government would be short-lived, because Frederik suffered from throat cancer. After only 99 days, he died on 15 June 1888. Their son Wilhelm II succeeded him. After the death of her husband, Victoria became better known as Empress Frederik (in German: Kaiserin Friedrich).\n\nVictoria was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1899. On August 5, 1901, seven months after her mother, former Empress Victoria died at the age of 60. She was buried in the Royal Friedenskirche in Potsdam on August 13, 1901. Next to Victoria is her beloved husband.\n\nI have beautiful and interesting things in my bookcase about Vicky:\n\nAn Uncommon Woman\n\ndoor Hannah Pakula.\n\nRead more about her in my blog: Vicky, Victoria’s eldest daugther\n\n2) Albert Edward (King Edward VII)\n\nAlbert Edward (London, 9 November 1841 – 6 May 1910) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May 1910. He was baptized as Albert Eduard but in the family he was better known as Bertie.\n\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert did their utmost to give their eldest son a good education and a good education, but unfortunately Eduard was not a good scholar. But he did have many other talents, such as charm and conviviality. During his study Eduard got a reputation as a playboy. His father was very angry about this and visited him, already seriously ill, in Cambridge. Two weeks later, on December 14, 1961, Prince Albert died. Queen Victoria was inconsolable and blamed Edward for the death of his father.\n\nEduard married Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863, the eldest daughter of Prince Christiaan of Denmark and Princess Louise in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. They had 6 children:\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (1864-1892)\n\nKing George V (1865-1936)\n\nLouise, Princess Royal (1867-1931)\n\nPrincess Victoria (1868-1935)\n\nMaud, Queen of Norway (1869-1938)\n\nPrince Alexander John (1871-1871)\n\nEdward had many mistresses during his marriage. Spicy detail: one of the great-grandchildren of Alice Keppel, one of Bertie’s best-known mistresses, Camilla Parker Bowles, was first the mistress and since 2005 the wife of Prince Charles (a descendant of King Edward VII).\n\nEdward really wanted to help his mother with government affairs, but Victoria did not allow this until 1898; she did not trust him. Unfairly, afterwards, because she owes her title of ‘Empress of India’ partly to him, after his trip in 1875 to the British colony of India.\n\nPicture – Four generations of British Kings and Queen. From left to right: Future King George V, Queen Victoria with future King Edward VIII on her lap and future King Edward VII.\n\nUpon the death of his mother on 22 January 1901, Edward finally became King. He was 59 years old … He took his duties seriously. Through the marriages of his brothers and sisters he had a large network within the European royal houses and other high circles. Eduard VII and Alexandra were crowned at Westminster Abbey on August 9, 1902. In spite of everything, he knew how to win the heart of the British through his style.\n\nUnfortunately, his government was short-lived. Edward smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars every day. He was also much too heavy. In March 1910, the king’s condition became poor and he was admitted to the hospital. He died on May 6, 1910. His second son succeeded him as King George V.\n\n3) Princess Alice\n\nAlice Maud Mary (London, April 25, 1843 – Darmstadt, December 14, 1878) is mostly known for being Queen Victoria’s daughter and the mother of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna . She was also the great-grandmother of Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAlice did not have much contact with her parents and was raised by nannies and private teachers. She had a good relationship with her brothers and sisters. When her father got typhoid fever in December 1861, 18-year-old Alice took care of him during the last weeks of his life.\n\nThe family was still in mourning, when Alice married on July 1, 1862 in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight with Grand Duke Louis IV of Hessen-Darmstadt. It was not a happy marriage: Alice and Louis had no common ground and had few conversations.\n\nThe princess became friends during the Prussian-Austrian War with the famous Florence Nightingale, when she founded the Alice-Frauenverein (also called Women Union). On June 13, 1877, Prince Louis succeeded his uncle as Grand Duke of Hesse and on the Rhine, giving Princess Alice the title of Grand Duchess. Princess Alice was a carrier of hemophilia, to which one of her sons died and of which several daughters (think of Tsarina Alexandra) were also carriers. She had a total of seven children with Louis:\n\nVictoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven (1863-1950)\n\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia (1864-1918)\n\nPrincess Irene (1866-1953)\n\nErnest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse (1868-1937)\n\nPrince Friedrich (1870-1873)\n\nAlix, Empress of Russia (1872-1918)\n\nPrincess Marie (1874-1878)\n\nIn November 1878, Alice’s eldest daughter, Victoria, contracted diphtheria. A few days later, Alix and May were also sick and within a short time everybody, except Elisabeth. Princess Alice spent all her time taking care of her husband and children. Princess Marie died on November 16th. Alice hid the truth about her death in order to restore their health quicker. The children eventually recovered, but Alice was very weakened by everything and contracted diphtheria herself. She died at the age of 35 on 14 December. She was buried with the English flag on her coffin in the Grand Duke mausoleum at Rosenhöhe near Darmstadt.\n\nRead more about her in my blog – Alice, Victoria’s second daugther:\n\n4) Alfred, duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nAlfred Ernest Albert (Windsor Castle, August 6, 1844 – Rosenau at Coburg, July 30, 1900), Duke of Edinburgh, was from 1893 to 1900 Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His nickname in the family was Affie.\n\nAlfred was appointed in 1852 as the heir to the throne of his childless uncle Ernest II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1856 he joined the Royal Navy according to his own wishes.\n\nAlfred became captain in 1867 and started on January 24 with a world tour on the frigate HMS Galatea. He was the first member of the British royal family to visit Australia and was received with enthusiasm. In Sydney, however, he was shot with a revolver in the back by Irishman Henry James O’Farrell during a picnic. Fortunately, his wound healed. In 1869, he visited India and Hong Kong.\n\nHe married on January 23, 1874, in the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II. It was not a happy marriage, and Mary was too arrogant in the higher London circles. The couple had six children:\n\nAlfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1874-1899)\n\nMarie, Queen of Romania (1874-1938)\n\nGrand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia (1876-1936)\n\nAlexandra, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1878-1942)\n\nPrincess Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera (1884-1966)\n\nWhen Duke Ernest II died childless on 2 August 1893, the double-duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha passed on to Alfred. Life in Coburg was hard for him. Like his sister, Empress Vicky, he was seen as a “foreigner” and mistrustful or downright hostile. Despite thisand his poor German, he eventually managed to win the love of his people.\n\nAfter the suicide attempt and death of Alfred’s only son and successor Alfred in 1899, he separated from his wife. To ease his suffering, he began to drink. On July 30, 1900, shortly before his fifty-sixth birthday, he died of throat cancer and was buried next to his son in the ducal mausoleum in Coburg.\n\n5) Princess Helena\n\nHelena Augusta Victoria (Buckingham Palace, London, 25 May 1846 – Schomberg House, London, 9 June 1923) was called Lenchen within her family.\n\nDuring a visit to Coburg in September 1865, Helena met Christian, the son of Duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and his wife, Countess Lovisa-Sophie Daneskjold-Samsöe. The two fell in love and became engaged in December of that year. Queen Victoria gave permission for the marriage on condition that the couple would live in England. Christian and Helena married on 5 July 1866 in the private chapel of Windsor Castle. Six children were born from the marriage:\n\nPrince Christian Victor (1867-1900)\n\nAlbert, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1869-1931)\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (1870-1948)\n\nPrincess Marie Louise (1872-1956)\n\nPrince Harald (1876-1876)\n\nHelena was the most active member of the royal family, she was busy carrying out many tasks of the family, she had an extensive program of royal obligations at a time when it was not expected that the royal family often appeared in public. Together with her younger sister Beatrice, she later became an unofficial secretary of the Queen. Helena died in London. She was buried next to her husband at the Royal Cemetery in Windsor Great Park.\n\nRead more about her in my blog – Helena, Victoria’s third daugther:\n\n6) Princess Louise\n\nLouise Caroline Alberta, Duchess of Argyll (London, 18 March 1848 -3 December 1939), married John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Marquis of Lorne and later Duke of Argyll.\n\nWhen Princess Louise had reached the age of marriage, her mother went searching for of a suitable husband. After several princes had passed, it was finally decided that Princess Louise would marry a member of the British nobility. The choice fell on John Douglas Sutharland Campbell, Marquis of Lorne and heir for the title ‘Duke of Argyll’. They married on 21 March 1871 in the St. George’s Chapel of Windsor Castle.\n\nIn 1878, Princess Louise’s husband was offered the post of Governor General of Canada; on November 14, the couple left for Canada. Princess Louise was very popular with the Canadians, who named Lake Louise and the province of Alberta after the princess.\n\nIn February 1880, Princess Louise was seriously injured in an accident cause by her sleigh to capsize. The princess then left Canada to recover from her injuries in England. Her husband also returned in 1883. On 4 April 1900 the 8th Duke of Argyll died, making Louise and John the 9th Duke and Duchess of Argyll.\n\nIn 1914, Louise’s husband died of pneumonia, which made her a widow. She herself died in 1939 at Kensington Palace. The Duke and Duchess of Argyll had no children.\n\nRead more about her in my blog – Louise, Victoria’s fourth daugther:\n\n7) Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn\n\nArthur William Patrick Albert (London, 1 May 1850 – Bagshot Park, Surrey, 16 January 1942), Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Count of Sussex, was governor-general of Canada from 1911 to 1916.\n\nArthur became interested in the army at a young age and in 1866 he joined the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Arthur had a long career in the British army and served in South Africa, Canada, Ireland, Egypt and India. In April 1893 he was promoted to general. Arthur had hoped he could follow Duke George of Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. Arthur was promoted to field marshal in June 1902. He then served in several important positions, as Commander-in-Chief of Ireland (1900-1904), Inspector-General of the Armed Forces (1904-1907) and as Governor-General of Canada (1911-1916).\n\nOn March 13, 1879, Arthur married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Frederick Charles. The wedding was performed in the St. George’s Chapel of Windsor Castle. From this marriage three children were born:\n\nMargaret, Crown Princess of Sweden (1882-1920)\n\nPrince Arthur of Connaught (1883-1938)\n\nPrincess Patricia of Connaught (1886-1974)\n\nIn 1899, Prince Arthur became first in the line of succession to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Prince Arthur, however, decided to renounce his rights for himself and his sons. In 1911, the British government appointed Arthur as governor-general of Canada. Arthur traveled to Canada with his wife and youngest daughter, Princess Patricia. They lived in Rideau Hall in Ottawa, which was partially renovated by them. His wife and Princess Patricia became very popular in Canadian society.\n\nIn 1914 the First World War broke out, where Canada took up arms against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Arthur stayed with his family in Canada at the beginning of the war, where he still held his position as governor general. On 19 March 1914 he performed the opening to the public at the Royal Ontario Museum. Louise Margaret worked for the Red Cross and was the patroness of a regiment of the Canadian army. Their daughter Patricia borrowed her name for a new regiment: “Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry”. After the war, Arthur had a stained-glass window in the St. Bartolomeus’ Church next to Rideau Hall, where the family often went.\n\nWhen his term as governor general was over and the family returned to England, Arthur went into service again to fight for remainder of the war. Louise Margaret, who became ill in Canada, died in March 1917. In 1928 Arthur retired from public life. He died fourteen years later at Bagshot Park at the age of 91.\n\n8) Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany\n\nLeopold George Duncan Albert (Buckingham Palace (London), April 7, 1853 – Cannes, March 28, 1884), was later appointed Duke of Albany, Count of Clarence and Baron of Arklow. Like many descendants of Queen Victoria,\n\nhe was suffering from haemophilia.\n\nLeopold’s disease imposed a lot of restrictions on him. He eventually became the patron of art and literature: in 1878 he became chairman of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1879 vice-chairman of the Royal Society of Arts. In 1876 he became the private secretary of the Queen, which he remained until his death.\n\nBecause of his illness, Leopold was struggling to find a wife. In the end, his mother offered a solution: she arranged a meeting with Princess Helena Frederika, the daughter of Prince George Victor of Waldeck-Pyrmont. Helena was a younger sister of Emma, ​​the later queen of the Netherlands, wife of William III and mother of Wilhelmina. They married on 27 April 1882 in the St.George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. The couple had two children:\n\nPrincess Alice, Countess of Athlone (1883-1981)\n\nCharles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1884-1954)\n\nA common characteristic of haemophilia is joint pain and Leopold was also suffered from this. The cold climate of England did not make it better, so his doctor advised him to go to Cannes. In Cannes he slipped and fell, and he died the next morning. He was buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel in Windsor. His wife Helena, after his death, gave birth to their son, Prince Charles, who succeeded his father from his birth as Duke of Albany.\n\n9) Princess Beatrice\n\nBeatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Buckingham Palace, London, April 14, 1857 – Brantridge Park, West Sussex, October 26, 1944) is the great-grandmother of the former Spanish king Juan Carlos.\n\nThe youth of Beatrice was mainly dominated by the early death of her father on December 14, 1861. Because the older sisters of Beatrice were married, she remained the unmarried daughter at court for a long time. She became the confidant of Queen Victoria. Beatrice was called Baby by her mother. She was raised by the queen with the idea of ​​always staying with her mother and not marrying. But soon Beatrice drew her own track.\n\nPrincess Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg. Beatrice and Henry tried to convince Victoria for a year to agree on their marriage. She finaly agreed. They wed on July 23, 1885 at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight. They were allowed to marry the queen on the condition that the newly married couple would stay in the United Kingdom and move in with the queen. The couple had 4 children:\n\nAlexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke (1886-1960)\n\nVictoria Eugenie, Queen of Spain (1887-1969)\n\nLord Leopold Mountbatten (1889-1922)\n\nPrince Maurice of Battenberg (1891-1914)\n\nBeatrice also had to continue her duties as an unofficial secretary. After only ten years of marriage Prince Henry died of malaria, sustained during a war in the former kingdom of Ashanti. Beatrice stayed with the queen until she died on January 22, 1901. Then Beatrice spent the next thirty years editing Victoria’s diaries. She died at the age of eighty-seven on October 26, 1944. She survived all her brothers and sisters and some of her children, cousins ​​and nieces."
