        "text": "One thing I noticed scrolling down my twitter feed today was that it seems to be a few people that have died in history today. So here we go this isn’t a conclusive list but one I have tried to put together of different people I have seen…..oh and it also takes the blog out of Europe for the first time to..\n\nEmperor Tsuchimikado of Japan, was born 3rd January 1196 and died 6th November 1231. He was the 83rd emperor of Japan reigning between 1198 till 1210.\n\nUlrich, Duke of Wuttemberg was born 8th February 1487 and died 6th November 1550. He succeeded Eberhard II as Duke in 1498, being declared of age in 1503.\n\nHenry Frederick Stuart, Prince of Wales was born 19th February 1594 and died 6th November 1612 and was the the elder son of James I and VI of England and Scotland and Anne of Denmark. He died at the age of 18 of a typhoid fever with his younger brother Charles becoming the heir to the thrones of England and Scotland.\n\nGustavus Aldolphus of Sweden, was born 9th December 1594 and died 6th November 1632 at the Battle of Lutzen. He reigned as King of Sweden between 1611 and 1632. he also became known as ‘The Golden King’ and ‘The Lion of the North’ leading Swden to be a great power during his reign.\n\nWilliam II, Prince of Orange lived between 27th May 1626 and 6th November 1650. He was sovereign Prince of Orange and stateholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands from 1647 till his death in 1650 of small pox.\n\nJohn IV of Portugal was born 18th March 1603 and died 6th November 1656. He was King of Portugal from 1640 till his death, and also nicknamed John the Restorer.\n\nCharles X of France, born 9th October 1757 till 6th November 1836. He reigned as King of France and of Navarre from 1824 till 1830. His rule ended due to the July Revolution which resulted in his abdication and the election of Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans.\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Wales was born 7th January 1796 and died 6th November 1817 at just the age of 21. She was the only daughter of George IV of Great Britain.\n\nEmperor Khai Dinh was born Nguyen Phuc Buu Dao on the 8th October 1885 and died 6th November 1925, He was the 12th Emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty in Vietnam.\n\n‘Remember remember the fifth of November, for Gunpowder, treason and plot.’\n\nWe all remember today as the day that Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators tried to blow up King James in the Houses of Parliament, but to some it is of note for other reasons. Keeping with the Eastern European theme of my last post I have decided to look at someone else whose history is marked on this day.\n\nCasimir III the Great was born 30th April 1310 and died 5th November 1370. He was the last of the Piast dynasty to be King of Poland reigning between 1333 and 1370. Born in Kowal, he was the son of King Wladyslaw I the Elbow-high and Duchess Hedwig of Kalisz.\n\nHe founded Poland’s first university, at Krakow in 1364. He was a skilful diplomat also and through his diplomacy he annexed lands from western Russia and eastern Germany. Casimir was the second king of the reunited Greater and Lower Poland following in his father’s footsteps. Ciasimir continued to use his diplomacy skills for his father adding both the important regions Red Russia and Masovia to the country. On the completion of the annexations it brought Poland to the next level of respect within Central Europe earing its place amongst the more powerful nations. After his elder brother died in 1312 he was regarded as heir and prepared for kingship by Jaroslaw the future archbishop of Gniezno. He became king in 1333 on his father’s death. His sister Elisabeth was married to King Charles Robert of Hungary in 1320 and figured within Casimir’s diplomatic relations with Hungary who he treated as a strong ally. Within the treaties Casimir dropped Poland’s claims on Silesia and East Pomerania. In exchange for this the King of Bohemia dropped his claims on Poland all together whilst he managed obtain the Teutonic Orders withdrawl from Kujawy and Dobrzyn.\n\nBy his death in 1370 Casimir had managed to increase his lands from 50,000 square miles to about 90,000 square miles. He was renowned throughout Europe. In 1364 a congress was held in Krakow and was attended by the Kings of Hungary, Bohemia, Denmark and Cyprus as well as many other local princes.\n\nHe married four times –\n\nHe married first Aldona of Lithuania in 1325. She was the daughter of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas and Jewna. They had two daughters Elisabeth of Poland (who married Boguslaw V, Duke of Pomerania) and Cunigunde of Poland (who married Louis VI the Roman). Aldona dies on 26th May 1339. His second wife was Adelheid of Hesse, they married on 29th September 1341. She was the daughter of Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse and Elizabeth of Messien. It was said to be a loveless marriage and Casimir soon started to live away from his wife. The marriage lasted till 1356. Casimir then married his mistress Christina. Christina was the widow of a wealthy merchant called Miklusz Rokiczani. Casimir met Christina at the court of Bohemia in Prague where she was a lady in waiting after Miklusz death. Casimir persuaded the abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Tyniec to marry them in secret. The secret didn’t remain that way for long and on hearing the news Queen Adelaide renounced it as bigamous and returned to Hesse without permission. Casimir ignored the complaints of Pope Innocent VI and continued to live with Christina until he once again declared himself as divorced in 1363/1364. In 1365 Casimir married his fourth wife Hedwig of Zagan the daughter of Henry V of Iron, Duke of Zagari and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children, Anna of Poland, Countess of Celje (who married William of Celje and Ulrich, Duke of Teck), Kunigunde of Poland and Hedwig of Poland. The marriage was considered bigamous again as Adelaide and possibly Christine surviving still. The legitimacy of the three children was disputed, although later legitimised by different Popes. Casimir also had three other illegitimate sons with his mistress Cudka.\n\nPart of Casimir’s legacy is the fact that even though he had no legal heir there was no attempt to split Poland back up, restoring the former duchies and principalities. His governance had given confidence in the monarchy for it to be able to continue. On his death 642 years ago today the crown of Poland then passed on to his nephew King Louis I Hungary.\n\nI have struggled recently with time and tiredness because of my condition Myasthenia Gravis that has meant that I haven’t been awake enough to concentrate to write. Still I feel quite tired during the day especially after work and have really struggled. Most weekend days where the opportunity presents itself I have a sleep in the afternoon just to get by, but I won’t be beaten and here I am coming up a little modern than the recent postings.\n\nSomething I am finding regarding this blog is that it has so much scope that at times I am overwhelmed by the amount of different ways and paths that I can try and follow. At times I wish I had specific period that I really loved and could get my teeth in but I love them all. I think at the moment then this is going to continue to be a mishmash of different periods, different dynasties, and different countries as I continue to pick away at things that spring to my attention at the time.\n\nSo here we are at Queen Victoria, and her nine children that I want to go through and list where they married into within Europe. I think this generation and the next really some up my original thoughts regarding the monarchy within Europe and how it so easily and quickly becomes interlinked. Especially amount Victoria’s children and reading further down you can see how we can go from Queen of Great Britain to heads of many different European countries within fifty years.\n\nFirst we have Victoria, the Princess Royal (21/11/1840-5/08/1901), she married Frederick the Crown Prince of Germany and Prussia, and they later went on to become Emperor and Empress of Germany and King and Queen of Prussia. They had four sons and four daughters who included Wilhelm II, Germany Emperor and King of Prussia and also Sophia the Queen of Greece.\n\nAlbert Edward the Prince of Wales (9/11/1841-6/5/1910) who went on to become King Edward VII of Great Britain and Ireland married Princess Alexandria of Denmark. They had three sons and three daughters, who included the future King George V and Maud the future Queen of Norway.\n\nPrincess Alice, (25/4/1843-14/12/1878) married Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine. Within their seven children was Alexandra, Empress of Russia.\n\nPrince Alfred, (6/8/1844-31/7/1900) Duke of Saxe-Colburg and Gotha, Duke of Edinburgh married Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and one of their daughters went on to become Marie, Queen of Romania.\n\nPrincess Helena, (25/5/1846-9/6/1923) married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.\n\nPrincess Louise, (18/3/1848-3/12/1939) married John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Marquis of Lorne and 9th Duke of Argyll. He later went on to become the Governor-General of Canada.\n\nPrince Arthur, (1/5/1850-16/1/1942) Duke of Connaught and Strathearn also later Governor-General of Canada married Princess Louisa of Prussia.\n\nPrince Leopold, (7/4/1853-28/3/1884) Duke of Albany married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, (14/4/1857-26/10/1944) married Prince Henry of Battenberg, one of their daughters went on to become Victoria Eugenie, Queen of Spain.\n\nAnd that I believe is only scratching the surface. From what has taken me as quick as thirty minutes to quickly look into I have found that within two generations we have at least, from one person the future royalty within many different states of Germany, Greece, Norway, Romania and Spain. This just backs up my original thought when I very first started writing this blog earlier this year and has now set the flame alight to continue to find out exactly how intertwined the royal families of Europe were.\n\nPrince Albert, Queen Victoria and their nine children, 1857. Left to right: Alice, Arthur, The Prince Consort, The Prince of Wales, Leopold, Louise, Queen Victoria with Beatrice, Alfred, Victoria and Helena\n\nPreviously I have tried to look through the Holy Roman Empire and try and get an understanding to the system of Electoral Emperors and the system throughout central Europe. To gain a true feeling and to broaden my knowledge I have often try to distinguish where to start and to look at to try and work out how this complex kingdom came about and worked its way together.\n\nPreviously this has led me through time to Otto I (November 23, 912 – May 7, 973) and the beginning of the Ottonian dynasty, but still even this far back Otto doesn’t give me the beginning as I wish to look at it. So pushing even further back I have picked out a name that flashes with lights to me Charlemagne (c. 742 – January 28, 814). A complex character with four wives, numerous concubines and over ten children I still felt that I was not getting a true beginning as I was looking for. So I kept pushing back until I reached the middle of the 5th Century and now I believe a starting point at where I can start to try and look at the building of a nation that monopolized central Europe for over a thousand years.\n\nIn 476 the collapse of the Western Roman Empire was complete. A barbarian was now termed ‘King of Italy’. Flavius Odovacer ‘Odoacer’ a Scirian (Eastern European Germanic tribe) was to become the first of a new generation of Kings and be the lynch pin between the old and the new Empires.\n\nThe believed first mention of Odoacer is from a fragment of a chronicle preserved in the Decem Libri Historiarum of Gregory of Tours. Part of his work recalls the battles of King Childeric I of the Franks, Aegidius, Count Paul and ‘Adovacrius’ or ‘Odavacrius’. It is believed the fragment tells the story of Aegidius’ victory over the Visgoths with occurred in 463 if this is so then the ‘Odavacrius is believed to be the same as Odoacer the later King of Italy. The first definite mention of Odoacer is by Eugippius in his Life of Saint Serverinus. This records how a group of barbarians stopped to their respect to the holy man on their way to Italy. As Odoacer left Serverinus made one final comment that would come to fruit, ‘Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.’ Which is what he did.\n\nThere are many different theories on Odoacer’s exact links with the Roman army. By 470 it is believed that he was an officer and John of Antioch states that he was on the side of Ricimer at the beginning of his battle with Anthemius in 472. While Procopious goes as far to say that he was actually part of the bodyguard for the Emperor. Jordanes contradicts Odoacer’s loyalty to the Roman army by calling him the ‘leader of Sciri, the Heruli and allies of various races’ that invaded Italy. I suppose the question is which came first. Maybe he was a invading commander who was brought round onto the side of the Roman way of thinking and because of this was then given office within the Army. The invading army thought would tie in with Eugippius story of Serverinus as well.\n\nIn 475 he was appointed head of the Germanic foederati (section of troops from the Scrian and Herulic tribes based in Italy) by Orestes the Magister militum of Emperor Julius Nepos. Orestes revolted and looked to gain power himself, driving Nepos from Italy before the end of year and appointing his own son Romulus Augustus as the new Emperor. At this point the foedrati were becoming restless with service in Rome and wished for better things. They petitioned Orestes for rewards with grants of land for their service. Orestes refused and the foederati turned to Odoacer for leadership. Osrestes was murdered outside Ravenna by Paulus his brother, leaving the door open for Odoacer. Odoacer and the Germanic foederati and a large section of the Roman army marched on Ravenna in 476 and Odoacer forced Romulus to abdicate on the 4th September. The army then declared Odoacer ‘rex Italiae’ King of Italy.\n\nThe senate of Rome backed Odoacer and even though the Senate first appointed Zeno (Eastern Emperor at the time) as Emperor reuniting the two sides of the vast Empire once more it seemed that the power was with Odoacer. This is further backed up with Zeno appointing Odoacer as Partician. Zeno suggested that Odoacer invited Julius Nepos back from Dalmatia to become Emperor once more, but Odoacer did not take this piece of advice. This leads me to believe that Zeno only truly acted as an advisor to Odoacer and he had the final say on matters of state.\n\nOdoacer acted quickly to try and establish his power base and extend his control over Italy. He managed to persuade the Vandal King Gaiseric to cede Sicily to him in c.September/October 476 and on the death of Julius Nepos (May, 480) the former Emperor who had ran to Dalmatia, Odoacer quickly pushed his control and own rule her also.\n\nIn 487 Odoacer led an army against the Rugians of Noricum taking their King Feletheus into captivity. Feletheus’ son Fredericus fled back to Noricum Odoacer sent his brother Onoulphus against him. The Rugiuns then fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths while Onolphus settled the remaining Romans back into Italy for their own safety. The abandoned province was then settled by the Lombards by 493.\n\nIn 489 Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the Julian Alps and into Italy. Within a space of a week Odoacer was taking refuge within Ravenna after being defeated twice. Theodoric went to Mediolanum where part of Odoacer’s army and chief general Tufa surrendered. The following summer the Visigothic King Alaric II sent military aid to Theodoric and the two clashed again at the Adda River. Once more this led to defeat for Odoacer. Odoacer then retreated once more to Ravenna where Theodoric now laid siege. Odoacer was losing hope and he led a unsuccessful push from Ravenna on the night 9/10 July 491. Odoacer then went back to Ravenna where the siege continued till 25th February 493 when John, Bishop of Ravenna negotiated a truce where both Odoacer and Theodoric ruled together.\n\nTheodoric entered Ravenna on the 5th March 493 and within ten days of the truce Odoacer was dead killed by Theodoric whilst feasting together. Odoacer’s wife Sunigilda was stoned to death and his brother was shot by archers while taking refuge in a church. His son Thela was exiled to Gaul, but on later after trying to re-enter Italy Theodoric had him killed also.\n\nSo the first barbarian King of Italy was dead. The Roman Emperors as we know them had eneded, the Lombards had entered Italy. Odoacer reign and time I beleive is as important as a changing point as that of Charlemagne or Otto I and he definatly deserves to be mentioned along side them as important a figure in the future and making of Europe.\n\nWhen you think of England and you think of all the different accents and dialects there are within the few hundred miles that separate the English channel and Hadrian’s Wall, it may be more easier to picture how fragmented the land once was. England wasn’t always England. The joining of the last fragmentation brought Northumbria in with Wessex, East Anglia and Mercia uniting them all as England.\n\nNorthumbria it’s self was not always as one and was a make up of smaller kingdoms.\n\nOne of these was Deira. According to Simeon of Durham (died after 1129) it lay on the east coast of what would become England between the Humber and the Tyne. Although the land north of the Tees was wasteland and useless. It’s capital would of been Ebrauc which is now modern day York.\n\nThe first known King of Deira was Aella who died in 588. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he became king the same year as Ceawlin of Wessex (560) on the death of Ida of Bernicia, and ruled 30 years. However, the Chronicle records in the year 588 that Aella died, and was succeeded by Aethelric. Possibly this is the reason Florence of Worcester offered the date Aella came to the throne as 559, which would closer align the dates of his death and reign.\n\nNot much is actually known of Aella but his geneology is disputed by two different sources.\n\nAccording to the manuscripts of Matthew Parker a 16th Century Archbishop of Canterbury, Aella was the son of Yffe, the son of Uxfrea, the son of Wilgisl, the son of Westerfalca, the son of Sæfugl, the son of Sæbald, the son of Segegeat, the son of Swebdæg, the son of Sigegar, the son of Wædæg, the son of Woden\n\nAlthough in the Historia Brittonum it is stated that Aella was the son of Iffi, grandson of Giulgis, great grandson of Sguerthing and great-great grandson of Soemil who “first separated Deira from Bernicia”.\n\nAnother mention of Aella, appears in the Gautreks Saga where he was visited by a peasant hero.\n\nOne of Aella’s sons was Edwin of Northumbria who went on to become King of both Bernicia and Deira which joined together to become Northumbria. Edwin was later venerated as a Saint. Aella’s daughter was Acha who married Aethelfrith of Bernicia.\n\nHe was succeeded by Aethelric (d.c604) although there is some ambiguity regarding this. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle states that Aethelric succeeded Aella in 588. Bebe states that Deira was invaded by Aethelfrith in about 604. The exact details are unclear and it is stated that Edwin is exciled which would lead to believe that Deira was conquered by Aethelfrith and Aethelric’s fate is unknown. Aethelfrith then ruled both Deira and Bernicia together until his death in battle when then Edwin and the Deria line was restored.\n\nWhen Edward the Confessor died, the nation of England was thrust into turmoil. Double promises of succession and foreign upstarts laying claim to the throne that now had no head to sit on. Each claim had its own merits and down falls but would lead to two battles that would shape the future of England forever. England would have four Kings within the year 1066, and each of them with a story to tell.\n\nThe first of these Kings, Edward the Confessor did not last very long. He died at Westminster Palace on 4th or 5th of January leaving empty the throne with no children to sit on it. The Normans claimed that in 1064 Edward is meant to have sent his actual successor Harold to see William, Duke of Normandy to confirm to William that he would follow him onto the throne. This is evidenced in the account of William of Poitiers just after the Battle of Hastings. William states that an envoy was sent by Harold to William stating that on his deathbed Edward had promised him the throne and that he would become the next King of England. William never disputed this claim but always believed that the previous promise overruled the later one. Some say that Edward actually entrusted the Kingdom to Harold before he died.\n\nThe Witenagemot or Witan convened the next day and declared Harold as the successor to Edward and he was crowned most probably at Westminster Abbey on the 6th January 1066. On hearing of this William began plans for the invasion of England with a mass fleet being built of 700 hundred ships. A standoff then took place for the next seven months with unfavourable winds not allowing William to sail and Harold with the English army encamped on the Isle of Wight. Provisions were nearing empty and Harold disbanded the army and set off back to London. On the 8th of September the same day as Harold left the Isle of Wight, another claimant to the throne landed at the foot of the Tyne.\n\nHarald Hardrada was the King of Norway and stuck his claim from Cnut. He was joined by Harold’s brother and the ex Earl of Nothumbria Tostig. It is stated that Edwards’s predecessor Harthacnut as the King of England, had stated that the crown would pass down the House of Denmark line instead of moving back to the House of Wessex. Magnus I of Norway didn’t follow this through but with persuasion from Tostig the fallen brother Harald believed he had a claim to stake. Harald invaded England with about 300 ships and 15,000 men. The major and decisive battle took place at Stamford Bridge on the 25th September 1066.\n\nAfter Harald had landed at the Tyne Harold raced north making the journey from London to Yorkshire in three days. With the speed at which Harold was traveling the invading Norwegian army was taken by surprise not knowing about the oncoming army came into view. It is said that with the surprise the Viking army were ill equipped and there armour had been left aboard their ships. The battle raged on the Viking side of the river once the Anglo-Saxon had removed the danger on the bridge. Sheild walls were formed and the fighting became close quarter. With the Norwegians having no armour they were at a disadvantage and their army began to fragment. The Anglo-Saxon then drove home this advantage and went on to win the battle. Harald was killed during the battle and Harold accepted the truce of his sons Olaf and Paul Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkneyto which they pledged never to attack England again. The battle is quite often stated as being the end of the era of Viking raiding in the British Isles, although there were a further two campaigns in the next couple of decades, notably those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069-70 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102.\n\nHarold was not allowed to rest on his victory for long. Three days after the battle on the 28th September 1066 William landed on the south coast of England. Harold and his battle weary army had to turn round and race back the road they had come to fight, to try and repulse the second invasion of the year. The tale of the crown in 1066 had taken another twist.\n\nThe Battle of Hastings took place on the 14th October 1066. The Anglo-Saxon spirit was broken during the battle when Harold was shot through the eye with an arrow. This scene has been made famous by the Bayeux Tapestry. After numerous attacks and counter attacks the causalities caused by William’s army led to the Saxon shield wall being filled with untrained and poorly weaponed troops. Small chinks were being made into the shield wall when William and a group of knights made a breakthrough this is where the attack against Harold himself is believed to come from. To many of the Anglo Saxon nobles had died Hastings to rally the remaining of the troops around and it looked like William would become the next King of England.\n\nEdgar the Atheling was the great grandson of Aethelred the Unready. Aged only 15 at the time of the Battle of Hastings this did not stop the Witan meeting the day after the battle in London and proclaiming him King. Edgar although was never actually officially crowned. England had now its third King of the year. As William then closed in on London in December Edgar’s supporters began to slowly dwindle In December of 1066 the remaining members of the Witan took Edgar out to William submitting to him at Berkhamsted quietly forgetting about the previous proclamation of Edgar as King.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror sent troops into London to begin to construct a castle. He was crowned England’s fourth King of the year on Christmas Day at Westminster Abbey 1066. His Kingship would be littered with revolts as he slowly put down the different rebellions of the Anglo Saxons, but his tenure would be the beginning of the House of Normandy that would revolutionise England. The death of the House of Wessex would end two hundred and fifty year history of the House of Wessex as it grew from the southern parts of England into uniting the whole nation as one.\n\n1066 was defiantly not a quiet year in the making on England and would be one that every inhabitant of England would go on not to forget.\n\nIf Rollo could be called the ‘Father of Royal Europe’, then you would have to look at his great granddaughter Emma of Normandy as the first prominent woman of modern monarchy. If being Queen of England, Denmark and Norway through two different marriages and at different times throughout her life was not good enough she was also mother to a King of England, a King of England and Denmark and a Holy Roman Empress. Emma is also the link to the English throne that gave William ‘the Conqueror’ (her great nephew) his claim to the title of King.\n\nEmma (b.985) was the daughter of Richard the Fearless, Duke of Normandy and his mistress Gunmora. Her parents went on and later married this then legitimised the birth.\n\nIn 1000-01 Normandy gave shelter to a Viking Army that threatened England and it is believed that Aethelred King at the time may have attempted an invasion to try and surpass the threat. This then could of led to the alliance between England and Normandy with the marriage of Emma to Aethelred in 1002. She then had three children with Aethelred, Edward the Confessor (future King of England), Alfred Aetheling, and Goda (future Countess of Boulogne). In 1013 Emma and her children were sent to Normandy to escape the invasion on Sweyn where they were shortly joined by Aethelred.\n\nWhen Sweyn died they returned to England where Aetheling was restored as King of England. On his death Edmund Ironside from his first marriage to Aelfgifu of York became the next King of England. Within the matter of months at the Battle of Ashingdon on 18th October 1016 this was all to change as Edmund signed a treaty with Sweyn’s son Cnut giving up all of England except for Wessex. Edmund died soon after this on 30th November. Cnut then seized control of Wessex as well and the crown of England moved back into the hands of the House of Denmark.\n\nIn what could have been a marriage of convenience and to guarantee the safety of her sons following Cnut’s campaign to rid himself of all other possible threats, Emma became again the second wife to the second wife to the King of England once more. Cnut went on to become King of Denmark and also the Norway and some of the Swedes.\n\nOn Cnut’s death in 1035 the throne of England jumped around a little between the next generation first it went to Harold his son to Aelfgifu of Northampton his first wife. Then to Harthacnut , Emma’s first son with Cnut. Harthacnut suddenly died in 1042 aged only roughly 23-24. Upon his death Edward Emma’s son to Aethelered was made King and the house of Wessex was restored once more to the throne of England. Emma thou during his reign was cast aside setting her support for Magnus the Noble who was son of the dethroned Olaf, King of Norway. It was believed that she had no love for the children from her first marriage and that is why her support went behind Magnus.\n\nEmma died in Winchester, Hampshire on 6th March 1052. Her life twisted between three different branches of the throne of England. England, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Normandy she clearly shows already how intertwined the thrones of Europe where becoming at such an early age."
