        "text": "British Monarchs\n\nQueen Anne - Charles III\n\nThere have been 13 British monarchs since the political union of the Kingdom of England & the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707. England & Scotland had been in personal union since 24 March 1603. On 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain & the Kingdom of Ireland merged, which resulted in the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Ireland, which became the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland on the secession of southern Ireland in the 1920s.\n\nQueen Anne became monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the political union of the Kingdom of England & the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707. She had ruled England, Scotland, & the Kingdom of Ireland since 8 March 1702. She continued as queen of Great Britain & Ireland until her death. Her total reign lasted 12 years and 147 days.\n\nDuring the reign of Queen Anne, Parliament settled the rules of succession in the Act of Settlement 1701, defining Sophia of Hanover (granddaughter of James VI and I) & her non-Catholic descendants as the future royal heirs. The Crown passed from Queen Anne to Sophia's son King George I as Sophia had already died. Queen Anne & King George I were second cousins as both were great-grandchildren of James VI & I.\n\nReign: Queen of England, Scotland & Ireland - 8 March 1702 – 1 May 1707.
