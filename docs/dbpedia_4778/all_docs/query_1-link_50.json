        "text": "Email Subject Line Hacks to get 35%+ open rate, ‚ÄúGuaranteed‚Äù These are not your bookish Tips.. Welcome to day 27 of 30-day learning challenge I‚Äôm not going to talk around the bush. Follow the simple method and get results. Tip 1: Your subject line should be less than 45 characters or more than 25 words.. -> Nothing in between works best.. Tip 2: Talk about the result or conclusion they‚Äôll get after reading the email. Tip 3: Obviously! use name Tip 4: Make spelling errors in the subject line (If you want) Tip 5: Add ‚ÄúFwd:‚Äù or ‚ÄúRe:‚Äù before the subject line Tip 6: Don‚Äôt use uppercase letters (Strict warning) Tip 7: Use one or two words in the subject line (works best) Tip 8: Use a number (but don‚Äôt use 7 tips or 7 secrets etc) E.g: -> Fwd: $10000 revenue generated yesterday -> Re: project completed -> john are you ready -> confidential -> missing The idea is to not sound like marketers. Marketers are bombarded with marketing tricks And everyone is doing the same old tricks.. This is why consumer's brain is resistant to marketing gimmicks.. Sound lazy and more human in your subject line.. Not getting results with your current email campaign Let me give you a drive. Connect on DM\n\nHere's a simple method for learning something new or solving a problem. Assume you need to educate someone else about what you‚Äôre learning or the problem you‚Äôre solving and write a report on it with sources. Here are four ways this has benefitted me: - I‚Äôve grasped concepts better by expressing what I learned in my own words. - I had something to refer to in the future when I forgot aspects of what I‚Äôd learned. - I‚Äôve often needed to educate someone else on what I learned and had something to do that with. - I had sources backing up what I wrote if someone had questions. I recently did this to understand a complex email marketing issue, share my findings, and help with a solution. What helps you learn something new or solve problems you‚Äôre working on?\n\nTesting email subject line variants lies at the heart of learning which messages elicit greatest engagement over time. For small business owners, newsletter opens represent a vital touchpoint for ongoing relationships beyond one-time sales. Optimizing subject lines through A/B testing builds subscriber value across longer lifecycles. For example, a small bakery offering cooking classes wants existing customers to sign up for an upcoming bread making workshop. They create two nearly identical promotional emails that feature the same body content. The only difference is the subject line varied between ‚ÄúOur Breadmaking Class‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn to Bake Artisan Bread.‚Äù Sending this controlled experiment to randomly divided subscriber lists reveals through open rate data which prompt entices more clicks driving sign ups. Words matter immensely in gateway messaging indexed by overwhelmed inboxes. Recipients make split second decisions on deletes based on fleeting impressions. Owners may believe one catchy subject grabs attention over another attempt. But absent objective data, relying on guesses wastes huge potential. Iteratively testing fresh subject line options quantifies which framing actually captures subscriber interest best for driving actions like opens, clicks and sign ups implementing tactical adjustments. Optimizing subject line wording presents low-hanging fruit for widest possible reach to website traffic, social followers or email subscribers. Structured A/B testing beats planning sessions focused on debating opinions. When small businesses embrace relentless experimentation, over time the quantified customer response speaks for itself by highlighting paths to higher performance.\n\nBeSci in the Wild : Part 5 : Back with a Bang! This time with my favorite combo of Besci x Marketing! ‚ú® This has to be the quickest I've ever engaged with an email, even when it settled in my SPAM section, which is saying something. In a landscape where marketers and consumer-centric companies relentlessly focus on click rates, open rates, and ensuring successful email delivery, strategies like these stand out. ü§î What makes this approach truly ingenious? (viewed from a Behavioral Scientist's perspective, of course): a. They start with the line \"Prove us Wrong\" : It naturally appeals to the natural instinct of humans to prove someone wrong. Growing up in competitive environments, being right was the only way we can move forward, and achieve anything. Learning took a backseat here (this might be a discussion for another time) however, the email marketer capitalizes on this human fallacy, not only understanding it, but skillfully using it to their advantage. b. It challenges the norm by urging recipients to do something counterintuitive. In a sea of subscribed email newsletters groping for eyeballs, trying to entice readers to open and consume their content, this email takes a bold approach by asking the reader NOT to open it. This naturally triggers rebels like me to do the exact opposite. This post concludes my five-part series on discovering behavioral science in everyday scenarios. However, it by no means marks the end of my curiosity and fascination with observing these subtle intricacies in the world around me! Interested in knowing which newsletter this is?

The BIGGEST Mistakes business owners make: FAIL to Educate Most founders/coaches/businesses/product owners FAIL to educate their customers. We are living in an age where people love FREE education before they buy. They don't love or hate your product. They just need more education on it. Find time to nurture their attention. And that‚Äôs exactly what a ‚Äúfree educational‚Äù email course is targeted to do. Three Biggest Secrets of how EECs help businesses: 1. Guarantee content distribution Social media algorithms change daily. How do you confirm that all your followers/audiences see the content you are posting? EECs guarantee that your content is delivered to your audience‚Äôs inboxes, daily and consistently. Thus, helps you own your fans and there is your opportunity to convert your followers into revenue-generating assets. 2. EECs serve as an automation engine and work while you sleep. EECs are your virtual and automated sales engine that works non-stop, 24x7. You curate content once and rinse/repeat in your customer‚Äôs inbox. 3. EECs convert your existing fan following into revenue. Already have an existing following? That‚Äôs an ideal scenario to convert your fan base to your email list, so you can educate/nurture them more with specific CTAs (Call to Action) emails and generate revenue. Still have questions? Please drop in the comments or DM me. I would love to \"educate\" you on the topic. aartianand.me\n\nThe biggest mistake coaches & consultants make that decreases their opt-in rate. Not nurturing their email list. As a coach or consultant, you must educate your subscribers. Educational email courses are the best way to nurture your list, while increasing your opt-in rates. 95% of people are beginners and are unaware of things. Your job is to educate them. A 5-day educational email course does the perfect job for this. Create an educational email course asap. P.S. If you don't know how to create educational email courses, DM me 'TEACH' and I'll show you how to do it.\n\nUnlock the pathway to financial success by implementing my proven 5-step blueprint to elevate your monthly income from $3-4K. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 1: Strategic Mind-mapping & Research - Acquire a solid understanding of cold-emailing fundamentals. - Dedicate a committed 4 hours per day to hone your skills. - Approach the numbers realistically and maintain a commitment to honesty. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Skill Refinement through Practice + Trial & Error - Utilize the *GMASS* chrome extension for effective email campaigns. - Launch your first cold email campaign through Gmail. - Import a prospect list for 25 emails per day. - Develop and schedule an email sequence for a week. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Monitor & Evaluate - Regularly track the progress of your email campaign. - Record metrics such as opens, clicks, spams, and bounces. - Allow the sequence to conclude before drawing conclusions. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Iterative Learning - Replicate the process with 5 Gmail accounts. - Execute 15 targeted and personalized email campaigns. - Document your daily progress in numerical terms.
