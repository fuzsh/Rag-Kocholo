        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - The couple walked into Duffy's Deli on Whitesburg Drive and eased up to the counter looking at the menu board while trying to decide what to eat. They asked what was good.\n\n\"Well, it's all good, but we're closed folks. We're out of everything,\" said the woman behind the counter. \"But we do have some of our Famous White Chili left,\" she said. \"I can heat some up or pack it to go.\"\n\nIt will be the last order at Duffy's Deli.\n\nLinda Ledbetter, who owns Duffy's Deli with her husband Terry Ledbetter, has been taking orders, making orders and anything else since 1992, writes down the order. Linda calls back to Terry in the now-empty kitchen to prepare a to-go order of White Chili.\n\nOn Friday, even the coke machine was just spitting carbonated water. There were no clean glasses and friends were helping clear the tables.\n\nThe cupboard was bare. There was nothing left in the kitchen except a few gallons of Duffy's Famous White Chili.\n\nDuffy Boles, a Huntsville High School graduate and Alabama football player from 1973 to 1975, opened Duffy's Deli when he returned to Huntsville in 1976. Boles became a running back coach at Huntsville High School. Duffy moved his deli into the former Beauregard's men's clothing store in a house on Whitesburg Drive.\n\nThe house was originally built in 1931 by the Betty Scollard family for one thousand dollars, Linda Ledbetter explains while sitting at one of the small wooden tables in the deli.\n\nWhen Terry and Linda Ledbetter bought Duffy's in 1992, they kept the favorites on the menu, like the Famous White Chili and sandwiches including the Duffyburger, the Dagwood and the Polish Rueben. The Ledbetters added a few things, including a tortilla soup recipe they found in Texas, to the menu in 1995.\n\nFriday was the last day for Duffy's Deli and it seemed everyone wanted to taste their favorite menu item or share a memory.\n\nThe \"Liar's Table,\" where local coaches and businessmen would jaw over local sports, was covered in newspapers and surrounded with laughter.\n\nEverything was for sale, from the kitchen equipment to the old tables, and people were snapping up mementos to remember the Huntsville gustatory icon by. Terry Ledbetter even gave away the glowing menu board with the last day's special to a customer. (The last special? Roast beef-swiss sub, and a soup or salad.)\n\nAlso sitting at the table and taking it all in was Eddie Hyter. Hyter graduated from Huntsville High School in 1985. After graduating, Hyter walked down the road to Duffy's Deli and asked Duffy Boles for a job.\n\nBoles hired Hyter and he has been working there ever since. Hyter, also a manager on the Panthers football team, isn't sure what he'll do now that Duffy's is closed.\n\n\"It's the only job I've ever known,\" said Hyter.\n\nFriends and family from all over came to wish the Ledbetters well and mourn the loss of a favorite lunch spot. The Watson family, owners of Stanlieo's Sub Villa, another favorite Huntsville lunch spot, showed up to be with the Ledbetters well. By the end of the day, Alice and Connie Watson were bussing tables and delivering orders while Glenn chatted at the Liar's Table.\n\nThe old house will be demolished to make way for a new restaurant from Huntsville celebrity chef James Boyce. Boyce, who owns Cotton Row and two other popular downtown restaurants, said he and his wife plan to build a two-story \"fast casual\" eatery on the Duffy's property.\n\nFriday afternoon at Duffy's Deli there were no glasses, the Coke machine was out and they were out of chips. Linda Ledbetter gave Alice Watson a long hug. Ledbetter then sat down in chair.\n\nShe watched as Terry gave away a few more items off the walls.\n\nWhen asked how she was doing, Linda Ledbetter replied, exhausted, \"It's five o'clock somewhere.\""
