        "text": "Yes, grants are available for new electric cars, and can be up to €5000. You can get a grant of up to €5,000 for battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV). It was announced in Irelands Budget 2023 that there will be a gradual reduction in the grant from July 2023. Once an electric car is registered, another grant cannot be given, therefore a grant doesn't apply on used cars.\n\nYou may be able to get a grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) if you buy a battery-powered electric vehicle (BEV) that meets specific standards.\n\nThe grant for BEVs only applies to new cars with a full price of between €14,000 and €60,000.\n\nSince 1 January 2022, the grant of €2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) ha\n\nElectric Vehicles can be charged in many different ways. Just like a diesel or petrol car, in order for it to move, it needs to have fuel in it.\n\nThere are different ways to charge an EV:\n\n1. AC (Alternating Current)\n\nThe quickest solution is to plug it in to a special device that you have at home. With a charger like this, almost all EV's will require a minimum of 7KW. Each hour, this will add between 40 to 50 kilometers of range.\n\n2. Domestic Socket\n\nThis is the slowest way to charge your vehicle, however, this method is not recommended. It only adds about 10 to 15km of range every hour.\n\n3. DC(Direct Current)\n\nYou may see these labeled as 'high-power chargers', 'fast chargers' or 'rapid chargers', and by using a DC, it is the fast way to charge your car. These devices are considerably better at charging your automobile quickly.\n\nSimilar to the fuel tank in a combustion engine vehicle, the energy we utilize to power our electric vehicles is stored in the battery. Typically, we charge the battery using electricity from the grid. On the roofs, meanwhile, some people have solar panels.\n\nThere is a wide range of battery sizes. When talking about the size of the battery, the amount of energy that can be stored in the battery is how the size is described, and not its actual size. For instance, the usable battery capacity of a base-model Volkswagen iD.4 is 52 kWh. This indicates that the battery has a 52kWh capacity.\n\nThere is nothing daunting about driving an EV. It is smooth, sleek, silent, and calm for all occupants. However, because the vehicle is super silent, it was difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to listen out for when the cars were driving at a slow pace. Regulations came in to place that meant that all new electric cars sold after the 1st of July, 2021, must make a noise when travelling at low speeds.\n\nElectric cars drive exactly like automatic cars, there are no gears, no clutch, just a park, drive, reverse and neutral button.\n\nWhen driving petrol or diesel cars, you have to build up power when you press your foot onto the accelerator. However, there is no waiting time, instead you get a surge of power, as the energy goes straight to the wheels."
