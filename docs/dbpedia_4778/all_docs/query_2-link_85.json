        "text": "2.1. Data collection\n\nDonor whole blood samples were separated into components via centrifugation at 3180g for 8 minutes. Blood supernatant (plasma and white blood cells) were removed and discarded. The remaining red blood cell pellet was resuspended and washed three times in a five-fold dilution of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco) with 0.2% Pluronic solution (F127, MilliporeSigma). Finally, the washed RBC pellet was resuspended in HBSS + 0.2% Pluronic at 1% hematocrit for infusion into the microfluidic ratchet sorting device.\n\nThe manufacture of the microfluidic devices has been described previously [2,3]. Briefly, a master mold was manufactured using photolithographic microfabrication and was used to fabricate a secondary master polyurethane mold [4]. From the secondary master molds, single-use microfluidic devices were fabricated using PDMS silicone (Sylgard-184, Ellsworth Adhesives). After the PDMS mold devices cured, they were punched with 0.5- and 3.0-mm hole punches to create the inlets and outlets, respectively. The 0.5-mm inlets were washed with deionized water for 15 seconds to remove any remaining PDMS debris. A thin PDMS layer (RTV 615, Momentive Performance Materials LLC) was produced by spinning uncured PDMS on a 100 mm silicon wafer. After curing, the thin PDMS layer was bonded to the molded PDMS device to seal its microstructures using air plasma. The resulting sealed microstructure molded device was bonded to a glass slide (Corning) using air plasma to allow for microscopy imaging.\n\nThe microfluidic device operates using microscale funnel constrictions to measure cell deformability. The operation of the microfluidic device has been described and validated previously [5,6]. Four pressurized fluidic inputs operate the microfluidic ratchet sorting. Three of these inputs push HBSS + 0.2% Pluronic buffer fluid: first, a horizontal crossflow moves the RBC sample towards the outlets, and a coupled oscillating up-down pressure system squeezes cells through progressively smaller tapered constrictions and declogs other cells unable to pass through. Cells that squeeze through a minimum constriction size of 2.50 µm wide travel to outlet 5, 2.25 µm to outlet 4, 2.00 µm to outlet 3, and 1.75 µm to outlet 2. The fourth and final pressurized input pushes the 1% hematocrit sample into the microfluidic matrix sorting region. Running the device for 60-90 minutes will sort >30,000 cells into the outlets.\n\nAfter cell sorting, cells were extracted from the microfluidic device and transferred into an imaging well plate. Each deformability outlet sample was split in two, producing two wells for imaging, allowing us to account for potential well-specific imaging bias (e.g., cell location shading bias). Full well image scans were conducted in brightfield using a Nikon CFI S Plan Fluor ELWD 40 × objective and a Nikon DS-Qi2 CMOS camera on a Nikon Ti-2E inverted microscope with NIS Elements software. A description of the raw data is found in the “Data description” section.\n\n2.2. Data cleaning\n\nThe raw images were cleaned in several ways. First, the images were manually audited to remove images captured outside the microwell or that were out of focus. The remaining images after this manual audit are included in the referenced data repository for this work [7]. To make these images useful for deep learning classification, a computer vision algorithm was used to extract single-cell images of size 60 × 60 pixels. The code used to segment the cells can be found here [8]. After single cell segmentation, each image was manually reviewed to remove those with no cells, partial cells, multiple cells, or those that were out of focus. The resulting cleaned dataset was further processed. Images from well 1 and well 2 from each outlet for a specified donor were combined to increase the variations within the deformability class. From this, we split the images 80/20 from each outlet to produce separate sets for training and testing. Since most cells (∼80%) were sorted to outlets 3 and 4, we decided to split the deformability groups into deformable (outlets 2 and 3) and rigid (outlets 4 and 5) classes. After train-test splitting and combining the outlets, we introduced further image variation using an image augmentation protocol to rotate single-cell images by a random integer multiple of 90°. This method produced 10,000 images for training and 2,000 images for testing for each deformability class. This augmentation approach is presented in our Github repository [8].\n\n2.3. Analysis\n\nThe balanced datasets were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for binary deformability classification for each donor. Our CNN model design can be found here [1] and was influenced by the AlexNet model architecture [9] and other deep learning architecture used in our lab [10]. The model was implemented in Python 3.7 using the Keras library in TensorFlow. For feature extraction, the model used a series of 4 convolutional layers (sequential kernel sizes of 7 × 7, 5 × 5, 3 × 3, and 3 × 3) and 3 max pooling layers. Each convolutional layer was followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. Then, the 3 fully connected layers were followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, and 20% dropout. The output layer used a SoftMax error function for backpropagation during training. We used a binary cross-entropy loss function and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. The implementation of this model can be found here [8].\n\nThe model was trained and validated using five-fold cross validation. We iteratively determined optimal donor-specific learning rates and number of epochs, ranging from 0.0001 to 0.1 and 25 to 80, respectively. A stochastic gradient descent operator was reliable across the 10 donors and was used with decay 10−6 and Nesterov momentum 0.9. A batch-size of 32 was held for all donors.\n\nAfter training and testing, the model's performance was assessed in multiple ways. First, we conducted saliency maps to assess whether the model was learning and classifying deformability based on relevant cell morphological features. Second, performance evaluations including confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC were performed. Finally, the deep-learning derived donor deformability score was compared to the microfluidic-derived score [1].\n\nThis dataset provides a comprehensive group of images at varying deformability levels for 10 donors who are diverse in terms of age, sex, and blood type. By further refining and developing deep learning platforms to assess red blood cell deformability, there is potential to alleviate the technical and equipment burdens associated with cell deformability measurement. Ultimately, this capability could enable blood banks to routinely assess RBC deformability in order to assess the quality of donated red blood cell units."
