        "text": "Hi Zoom Engineers,\n\nSome more examples, here I am showing a few screen shots.\n\nFirst image, the host is streaming video content - Left screen using v 1.7.7 and right screen v 1.7.8\n\nSecond image, the host stops streaming video content - Left screen using v 1.7.7 and right screen v 1.7.8\n\nI am seeing the exact same issue with 1.7.9 (as an aside please allow an option to disable captcha, users will already be authenticated).\n\nWhen I inspect the the screen via Chrome’s Dev tools, I can see a difference in the Canvas with ID: sv-active-video\n\nIn v 1.7.7 - the width has been calculated.\n\nin v 1.7.8 - the width has not been calculated.\n\nFor v 1.7.7 the video stream is very stable and always works.\n\nFor 1.7.8, very unstable, i.e. works 1 times out of 10.\n\nNow, the time it works with 1.7.8, the width attribute for the Canvas ID sv-active-video is calculated. And, the cases where it is not working, this attribute is never calculated. Therefore, the method / approach to how this is calculated would be where I could review the code.\n\nSo, some suggestions:"
