        "text": "Diamond from Antwerp, Belgium\n\nEach year (often twice per year), George Duffy takes a trip to Antwerp, Belgium, where he searches for the world's most perfect diamonds.He brings them back to his store in Dickson City and works with his customers to create the most unique, exquisite settings for them.\n\nAbout The Owner, George Duffy\n\nGeorge Duffy always had a love for the jewelry business. At 11 years old, George started working in his fatherâ€™s jewelry store in Scranton, cleaning showcases and vacuuming the floors. It was at this time that he learned how to engrave. When he was 12, George was polishing rings and learning the birthstone for every month. By the time he turned 18, he was soldering chains, sizing rings, and helping his dad with jewelry repairs for 13 other jewelry stores.\n\nIn 1990, George began running a second store for his father and taught himself how to design and create his own jewelry by using carving wax and lost wax casting. Within 10 years, George opened up his own store, Duffy's Goldsmiths, in Olyphant. In 2008, George purchased his current building on Main Street in Dickson City and changed the name to George & Company Diamond Jewelers.\n\nLearn More"
