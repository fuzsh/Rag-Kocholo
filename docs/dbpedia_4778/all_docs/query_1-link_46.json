In 1967, 5.6 acres were used for the WNEB Broadcast Tower.\n\nFun for the Kids\n\nIf baseball isn't your kids' favorite activity, they'll be sure to find something to enjoy at the playground. Parents can find a shady bench to sit and watch the little ones swing, slide, climb, run around and much more!\n\nThe Duffy Field playground is dedicated to the loving memory of Harold \"Mickey\" Bailin through the generosity of Maurice and Ben Bailin.\n\nAlso Check Out\n\nView some of the other parks in this district. Get out and explore!"
