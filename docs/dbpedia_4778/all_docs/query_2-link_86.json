        "text": "Wow my mind is blown at the pace realistic models are being generated through the help of AI. The videos below are simulation. For anyone curious how it‚Äôs achieved check out Johnathan‚Äôs post below. Abstract from Yunzhi Yan‚Äôs Arxiv paper copied below: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúThis paper aim to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes from monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision in tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS (1066√ó1600 resolution) within half an hour of training.‚Äù HALF HOUR of training. Wow.\n\nFollowing on from our post earlier in the week, fusing CG processes with AI using our backplates, but retaining the fidelity and 32bit dynamics of our hi-res 360 HDRI maps. This image shows the versatility of AI generated backplates from a single Domeble location, offering alternative perspectives on a scene, whilst retaining the integration with the matched and dedicated 360 HDRI map from the same scene. #ai #porsche #spiderRS #realnotreal #aiphotography #aiautomotivephotography #CGbackplates #360hdri #aicars#aiphotoreal #vred #photoshop #automotiveCGI\n\nüó∫#30daymapchallengeüåé Day 5: Analog Has Brendon Edwards cheated or been clever with todays map theme? Using Dall-E-3 to 'generate a photorealistic cartographic depiction of the UK, with each region represented by intricately designed pocket watches. Utilise a DSLR camera with a 35mm lens at a 45-degree angle, ensuring a uniform lighting setup with a softbox light to capture the refined details and create a visually engaging and technically nuanced map.' Can't fight the future, we think it looks great but if you think cheat then don't worry we have another submission to balance it out. #maps #AI #dalle3\n\nNext round: Runway just announced Gen-3: Alpha. Here's what you need to know: Gen-3 Alpha is part of their series of building 'General World Models'. \"We believe the next major advancement in AI will come from systems that understand the visual world and its dynamics\". This includes: - Fine-grained temporal control - Photorealistic Humans - Wide range of cinematic styles - Consistent characters This will bring forth a new tidal wave of short films, trailers and commercials. They continue: \"Gen-3 Alpha will power Runway's Text to Video, Image to Video and Text to Image tools, existing control modes such as Motion Brush, Advanced Camera Controls, Director Mode as well as upcoming tools for more fine-grained control over structure, style, and motion\". Unlimited creative direction at our fingertips. I've edited the video with SFX from Envato, to experience the visuals in perspective. Things are getting very interesting. Follow me if you want to learn how to create video with AI #AI #video #Runway #ArmsRace #CreativeDirection\n\nI created a quick, short video in After Effects using Element 3D so I could use this to drive the movement of the final video from Runway. Using an image from Midjourney as the style prompt and controlling the influence in the advance settings resulted in a more controlled final Ai video. #runway #runwayml #adobeaftereffects #aivideo"
