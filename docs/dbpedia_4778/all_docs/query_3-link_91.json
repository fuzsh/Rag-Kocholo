        "text": "Since the introduction of the Audi e-tron around four years ago and sales of 150,000 units, Audi has been following a systematic electric roadmap. Its electric portfolio now comprises eight models. By 2026, it will have more than 20. At that point, Audi will only be releasing fully electric models on the global market. “With our corporate strategy ‘Vorsprung 2030’, we’ve set a fixed date for our withdrawal from combustion engines and clearly decided that Audi will be a fully electric brand within 11 years,” said Markus Duesmann, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG. “The new Audi Q8 e-tron, with its improved efficiency and range and refined design, is another important component in our electric portfolio to get people excited about electromobility with emotional models that are suitable for everyday use.” Audi Board Member for Technical Development Oliver Hoffmann also focused on the customer benefits enhanced by these refinements. “In the new Q8 e-tron, we were able to significantly increase both battery capacity and charging performance. This allowed us to achieve an optimal balance between energy density and charging capacity, as well as to increase efficiency,” Hoffmann said. “On top of that, we improved the motors, progressive steering, and chassis control systems – and thus the dynamic driving characteristics that are typical of Audi in all versions of the Q8 e-tron.”\n\nBy calling this model the Q8, Audi is making a clear statement that the Audi Q8 e-tron is the top model among its electric SUVs and crossovers. The Audi Q8 e-tron and Q8 Sportback e-tron are immediately identifiable as fully electric models at first glance. This is thanks to the new front and rear designs that systematically carry Audi’s electric design language forward. As a prestigious electric SUV model from Audi, the Q8 e-tron ushers in the new corporate identity with a two-dimensional design of the logo on the exterior. The model lettering with an Audi logo on the B-pillar is new as well.\n\nFor both body shapes, three drivetrain variants with electric all-wheel drive can be selected. With their two motors, the base models of the Audi Q8 50 e-tron* and the Audi Q8 50 Sportback e-tron* generate 250 kW in boost mode and 664 Nm of torque, and they get a range of up to 491 km (SUV) and up to 505 km (Sportback), in accordance with the WLTP.\n\nWith their two motors, the Audi Q8 55 e-tron* and Audi Q8 55 Sportback e-tron* generate 300 kW in boost mode and 664 Nm of torque. Their ranges are up to 582 km for the SUV and up to 600 km for the Sportback, in accordance with the WLTP. Their top speed, and that of the Q8 50 e-tron* is limited to 200 km/h.\n\nThe top-end Audi SQ8 e-tron*and Audi SQ8 Sportback e-tron*are powered by three motors. Their boost performance amounts to 370 kW and 973 Nm of torque. The range of the S models is up to 494 km for the SUV and up to 513 km for the Sportback. Their top speed is limited to 210 km/h.\n\nTwo battery sizes can be selected. The battery of the Q8 50 e-tron has a storage capacity of 89 net kilowatt-hours (95 gross kWh), while the more powerful versions of the Q8 55 e-tron and SQ8 e-tron have 106 net kWh (114 gross kWh). Thanks to an adjustment to the battery management system, the battery capacity usable for customers has increased as well. At a high-powered charging station, the Audi Q8 50 e-tron reaches a maximum charging performance of 150 kW. With the Q8 55 e-tron and SQ8 e-tron, the maximum charging performance increases to up to 170 kW. The big battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent during a roughly 31-minute charging stop – under ideal conditions, this corresponds to a range of up to 420 kilometres1. At an AC charging station or wallbox, the Audi Q8 e-tron charges at up to 11 kW. Audi offers an optional AC charging performance of up to 22 kW.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, the Audi Q8 50 e-tron can completely charge in around nine hours and 15 minutes (22kW: around four hours and 45 minutes) using alternating current. The big battery’s numbers are around 11 hours and 30 minutes at 11 kW and six hours at 22 kW. The Audi Q8 e-tron comes standard with the Plug & Charge function. At compatible charging stations, the vehicle authorises itself when inserting the charging cable and activates the charging point. Billing happens automatically. The new charging service Audi charging, which is set to launch in 2023 and will in the future replace the existing e-tron Charging Service, will allow for convenient access to around 400,000 public charging points across Europe. The e-tron route planner provides reliable support when searching for charging points along your route.\n\nLike all luxury-class Audi models, the Q8 e-tron uses the MMI touch response operating system. Its two large high-resolution displays – the top one with a 10.1-inch diagonal and the bottom one with an 8.6-inch diagonal – replace nearly all conventional switches and knobs. Beyond operation with the two touch displays, a lot of features can be activated through natural voice control. The digital display and operating concept in the Audi Q8 e-tron is rounded out by the standard Audi virtual cockpit with full HD resolution. Specific graphics depict all the important aspects of electric driving, from charging performance to range. On request, a heads-up display can be added. The Audi Q8 e-tron will come standard with MMI Navigation plus. Its media center supports the high-speed data transmission standard LTE Advanced, and it has an integrated WiFi hotspot for the passengers’ mobile devices. The navigation system intelligently recommends destinations based on previously traveled routes.\n\nThe Audi Q8 e-tron will be certified as net-carbon-neutral2 for customers in Europe and the USA. Audi also uses recycled materials for some components in the Audi Q8 e-tron. These materials, treated through a recycling process, reduce the amount of resources used and ensure a closed, efficient and sustainable material loop. In the interior of the Audi Q8 e-tron, Audi uses recycled materials for insulation and damping, as well as for carpeting. The decorative inlay above the display, called the Tech Layer, is available with a new anthracite-coloured technical material that’s partially composed of recycled PET bottles. With the S line equipment package, the sport seats are upholstered in synthetic leather and the microfiber material Dinamica is an optional upgrade. Dinamica is made from up to 45 percent polyester fibres that are manufactured from recycled PET bottles, used textiles and fiber residue.\n\nIn contrast to previous microfiber quality, the production of Dinamica is also solvent-free – another contribution to environmental protection.\n\nFurthermore, some safety-related components that partially comprise mixed automotive plastic waste treated through a chemical recycling process are used for the first time – specifically, the plastic covers for the seatbelt buckles. As part of the PlasticLoop project, Audi worked with the plastics manufacturer LyondellBasell to establish a process in which chemical recycling will be used for the first time to reuse mixed automotive plastic waste in the series production of the Audi Q8 e-tron.\n\nMarket launch in spring 2023\n\nThe new Audi Q8 e-tron and Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron will be available to order starting in mid-November, and will arrive to the Irish market in Spring 2023, with a starting price from €86,400."
