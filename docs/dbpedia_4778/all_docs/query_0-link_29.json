Bruder is a shareholder at the firm and the chair of its Regulatory and Government Affairs Group. With almost 30 years of experience as both a litigator and lobbyist, she has an extensive network of contacts and the knowledge necessary to develop strategies with clients and influence decision-makers in federal, state and local government.\n\n“Kathy’s knowledge of the inner workings of the government at the federal, state and local levels is immense and has been for three decades,” Saxton & Stump CEO James W. Saxton said. “She is a fixture at the Capitol building and has worked with hundreds of the state’s lawmakers. Kathy truly deserves and has earned her place on this list. She’s invaluable to the firm’s government relations goals and we couldn’t think of anyone better to lead this group or be recognized by CPBJ.”\n\nBruder was part of the Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov.

Shapiro, Bruder was appointed to the Civil Procedural Rules Committee of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and most recently chaired the committee from 2022 to 2023. The former deputy chief of staff for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, Bruder served as the governor’s liaison for all state-wide management personnel positions and was the governor’s lead contact for numerous state agencies such as transportation, state funding programs, policy, legislative and press initiatives. Bruder also previously served longtime Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed as a cabinet member in the roles of deputy solicitor, labor attorney and director of human resources.\n\nIn 2023, the Central Penn Business Journal named her to its “Women of Influence” list and its Lobbyist Power List. In 2022, City and State PA named Bruder to its “Top 50 Pennsylvania Lobbyists” list. Bruder serves as the treasurer/secretary and board member for Harrisburg-based Joshua Group, the nonprofit organization that provides support for at-risk youth in Harrisburg.\n\nSaxton & Stump’s strategic growth outlook\n\nWith 200 professionals, including 107 attorneys, Saxton & Stump’s innovative model continues to attract highly talented and experienced attorneys, driving the growth of the law firm and its affiliate companies nationwide.\n\nSaxton & Stump provides solutions for complex legal issues and partners with clients to create a roadmap for their success.
