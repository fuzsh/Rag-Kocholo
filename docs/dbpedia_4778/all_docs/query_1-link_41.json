        "text": "Printed on Albrecht Dürer - 210 gsm\n\nHahnemühle Albrecht Dürer is a genuine mould-made paper made from 50% cotton and 50% α-cellulose fibres. The traditional mould-made art paper is refined with a coating specially developed for FineArt applications. The white FineArt inkjet paper does not contain optical brighteners and has a classic, strikingly defined watercolour structure that adds an artistic touch to art reproductions in particular. Combined with the matt premium inkjet coating, this produces impressive FineArt prints boasting vivid colours, deep black and optimum reproduction of detail. The acid- and lignin-free Albrecht Dürer FineArt inkjet paper meets the most exacting requirements for age resistance."
