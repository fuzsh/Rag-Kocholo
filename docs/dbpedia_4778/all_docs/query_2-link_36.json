        "text": "Today is Women‚Äôs Equality Day in the U.S., a day that commemorates the 1920 adoption of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote, and calling attention to women‚Äôs continuing efforts toward equality around the world. With that in mind, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the amazing women at Carnival Cruise Line. Your contributions are shaping the future of our organization. This year, we proudly highlight trailblazing women‚Äîsome being the first in their roles, and others with incredible stories of growth and success at Carnival over the years. Their spirit and dedication to our values are paving the way for future leaders at Carnival. Read their stories below. I also want to thank our senior shipboard officers and shoreside leaders for their strong support and guidance. Your mentorship is helping to create a better and more inclusive future for everyone. Let‚Äôs keep uplifting and inspiring each other! #womensequalityday\n\nHonored to be included among an amazing list of women of a certain age in this years Forbes list of 50 over 50! Thanks to everyone across our team of 50,000 Carnival Cruise Line employees who make it happen every day and thanks to the many mentors, friends and family for their years of support!üõ≥Ô∏èüõ≥Ô∏èüëçüéâ\n\nThe next total solar eclipse will take place on Aug. 12, 2026 and we just announced our first ever eclipse cruise on Carnival Legend featuring stops in Spain, Portugal and France departing from Dover, England on August 9, 2026. The cruise will provide our guests with a prime viewing vantage point for this rare celestial occurrence while the ship is at sea. In addition to seeing the eclipse, guests will also visit: Le Havre (Paris), France; St. Peter Port, Guernsey; Vigo, Spain; Lisbon and Leix√µes (Porto), Portugal; Le Verdon (Bordeaux), France; and Zeebrugge (Brussels), Belgium. As I always say, it's never too early to plan your next vacation, especially a special one like this! #solareclipse2026 https://lnkd.in/ezusPFGM\n\nWe just announced that Ben Clement, our current SVP of New Builds, Refurbishments and Product Development, will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Maritime & New Builds, effective January 2025. He will move into his role when Lars L., currently our Chief Operations officer, transitions to Carnival Corporation as the company‚Äôs new Chief Maritime Officer. Ben is a 28-year veteran at Carnival Cruise Line and I have worked closely with him during my nearly 10 years at Carnival on all of our New Builds and Refurbishments. He has continually pushed us to think about ship design, features, venues and products in ways that have helped redefine Carnival, grow guest loyalty and build a vibrant customer base that has propelled our growth. I'm thrilled that he is taking on this expanded role. Congratulations, Ben!\n\nFollowing our exciting visit to Manila, Philippines, Bettina Deynes, SHRM-SCP (she/her/hers), Richard Brearley and I stopped in Bali, Indonesia to show our support for our Indonesian team members who represent the largest onboard population. We employ more than 12,000 Indonesians! We met with officials and team members, along with a visit to Carnival Splendor while she was in port and on her way to Singapore! We also celebrated the retirement of one of our long-term Indonesian team members who has been with Carnival for 34 years!\n\nCreating unique experiences for our guests is what will make Celebration Key so special! We just revealed Pearl Cove Beach Club, an exclusive retreat that will offer a premium experience for guests 18 and older. We also opened reservations for our variety of Daybeds, Cabanas and Super Villas for the ultimate pool or beach day! We can't wait for the destination's debut next summer! https://lnkd.in/efXTJJii\n\nA highlight from my first trip to the Philippines - spending the day with our partners at the Philippines Merchant Marine Academy, the country's oldest state-run maritime school, where I spoke at their commencement ceremony, signed a memorandum of agreement and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for our new PMMA/Carnival Cruise Line Training Center! Our collaboration with PMMA establishes a training center that will increase the number of competent and highly skilled cruise ship personnel for Carnival vessels. We continue to partner with PMMA by providing scholarships for deserving and qualified students and we have established a cadetship program for cadets to become officers and engineers. Richard Brearley Bettina Deynes, SHRM-SCP (she/her/hers) Watch the commencement here: https://lnkd.in/ev5cEsf5\n\nOn my first ever visit to the Philippines, I talked with ANC Market Edge (their national news channel, similar to Bloomberg) about the growth and success of Carnival Cruise Line. We also spoke about the importance of our Filipino team - the seafarer profession is a top career in the Philippines and we proudly employ more than 12,000 Filipinos. We are committed to helping Filipinos navigate their way to fulfilling careers in the global cruise industry through partnerships with local maritime and hotel schools. https://lnkd.in/e3GZR6-k\n\nWe are so excited with today's news of three new ships on order for Carnival Cruise Line! The agreement with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri provides for the design, engineering, and construction of a new class of vessel that will be liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered and will be delivered in the summers of 2029, 2031 and 2033, respectively. We are proud to be known as America‚Äôs cruise line with tremendous guest loyalty and an outstanding team that has enabled us to deliver memorable vacations to more than 100 million guests. For this next generation ship, we are focused on creating innovative guest experiences that will take Carnival Cruise Line into the future with new FUN features and excitement that we know our guests will LOVE. https://lnkd.in/gSV8H7Az"
