Computer-Controlled Cutting¶\n\nGroup Assignment:\n\ndo your lab’s safety training\n\ncharacterize your lasercutter’s focus, power, speed, rate,kerf, joint clearance and types\n\nIndividual Assignment:\n\ncut something on the vinylcutter\n\ndesign, lasercut, and document a parametric construction kit, accounting for the lasercutter kerf, which can be assembled in multiple ways, and for extra credit include elements that aren’t flat\n\nDownload Design Files¶\n\nFusion360 Design File\n\nSticker Design File\n\nGroup Work Reflection¶\n\nFor the group work assignment, we were tasked with characterizing our laser cutter’s focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, joint clearance and types. I worked with Angelina Yang and Richard Shan. The main thing I learned from our group work is to evenly distribute roles; I ended up not doing as much as Angelina or Richard because we did not discuss who would do what parts of the project. Additionally, I learned that documentation needs to be clear. Even the most accomplished engineers, with too ambiguous wording, are hard to understand.\n\nSee our group work here: Group Work Page\n\nVinyl Cutting¶\n\nTo create my sticker, I first found a design I liked online and then downloaded it. The picture had a background to it, so I uploaded the image to removebg, clicked remove background, and downloaded the new file. I then imported the image into Silhouette Studios. I then resized the image to make it bigger so when I trace it I can easily see details. I opened the trace tab, clicked “Select Trace Area,” and positioned the trace area so that all of the image was inside. I then fiddled around with the settings to find the trace that best captures the image (keep in mind that the trace lines will be cut out from the vinyl). I decided on the following settings:\n\nTrace Quality: medium\n\nTrace Preview: outline\n\nThreshold: 20%\n\nDespeckle Threshold: 0%\n\nHigh Pass (Off): 0%\n\nLow Pass (Off): 0%\n\nScale: 10\n\nTrace Style: Trace\n\nI then clicked “Trace.” Once the image is traced, it will remain in the document so I pulled it to the side and deleted it. I was then left with the trace outline (in red).\n\nNext I scaled the trace outline so that the width was 3.5 inches.\n\nTip: A trick Teddy Warner taught me is to make a small box in the corner of your design. Then, when you separate the design to cut only what you want to for each color, keep the box in all the designs (copy the design, remove unwanted cut lines, cut, paste the design back and repeat). The box will stay in the same place so you can use transfer tape and line up the boxes as you assemble your sticker’s layers and it will stay aligned properly. You can then remove the box once your sticker is all put together.\n\nNext I grouped the trace outline and the box together. I then saved the design, named it, and exported it to my computer’s downloads. I uploaded the file to my Google Drive so that I can access it on the PC connected to our lab’s vinyl cutter.\n\nOn the PC connected to our lab’s vinyl cutter, I opened my file. Next I ungrouped the design, copied it to clipboard, and deleted the lines I did not want cut for the corresponding color (referencing the image my trace is based on). I then retrieved a cut mat, a weeding tool, scissors, and three pieces of vinyl: pink for the brain, black for the stick-man outline, and white for the background. Note it’s often easier to use the same type of vinyl as the settings will be consistent for all colors of vinyl you are using.\n\nI then aligned the black vinyl in the upper left corner of the cut mat and used the squeegee to adhere it to the mat and ensure no air bubbles are between the vinyl and cut mat. Next, I lined the cut mat with the blue line on the vinyl cutter and hit “Load.”\n\nThe “Send” tab settings are as follows:\n\nMaterial: Vinyl matte\n\nAction: Manual blade, 1mm\n\nTool: cut\n\nBlade depth: 1\n\nPasses: 1\n\nForce: 10\n\nSpeed: 5\n\nI then hit “send” on the computer and the vinyl cutting starts! Once the job was complete, I hit “Unload.”\n\nI followed the same steps as above for the pink vinyl, however, I changed the material setting on the “Send” tab to “vinyl glossy.”\n\nI did not cut the white vinyl on the laser cutter as I do not need to make any precise cuts with it as it is only the background for my sticker. Instead, I took scissors and cut an outline around the design once the pink and black vinyl cuts were transferred onto the white background.\n\nTo remove the unwanted black and pink sticker parts, I used a weeding tool.\n\nBlack vinyl after weeding:\n\nI then used transfer tape to transfer the pink part of the brain onto the white vinyl and then the black vinyl ontop of the pink (lining up the squares as I mentioned before). Once lined up, I removed the squares I used to help line the vinyl pieces. I then trimmed the white vinyl with scissors to outline the stickman.\n\nFinal Sticker:\n\nLaser Cutting¶\n\nLaser Cutting Process (adapted from Griffin Orsinger):\n\nPlace material to cut into the bed of the machine\n\nClose the laser cutter lid\n\nSlightly lower the bed using the manual bed control button\n\nMove the head of the laser to where your material is\n\nSelect autofocus\n\nUpload your design to Corel Draw on the PC connected to the laser cutter\n\nChange the lines you want to cut to hairline\n\nPress ‘Ctrl+P’ to cut your design\n\nClick “OK”\n\nChange the material settings in the Epilog software\n\nMove your image to where you want it to cut\n\nClick “print”\n\nPress the play button on the laser cutter\n\nAfter the cut is finished…\n\nCheck to see if your parts have been fully cut\n\nIf they have not, re-run the job without moving the material. If the parts are fully cut, carefully remove them from the bed\n\nThe Parametric Process¶\n\nA parametric design is a design where you can scale the design and it will work for all sizes. To accomplish this, I created parameters for my Fusion360 design.\n\nTo create parameters I in Fusion360 I typed “s” to open the search tab and typed “change parameters” and hit “eneter.” This then took me to the parameters menu. In the top left corner of the menu I hit the plus sign. The add user parameters menu then opened up in which I typed the name of my parameter, specified the parameter’s units, and entered my desired measurement value as the expression.\n\nFor kerf, I realized I needed to account for it in my other parameters. I went into my TabLength, TabWidth, SideLength, and Diameter parameters and put “+ Kerf” after the value I entered in the expression section.\n\nWhen dimensioning my design, instead of typing a numerical value, I typed the name of the parameter I wanted to use.\n\nParametric Design¶\n\nFor my parametric design kit I needed to make a kit that can be assembled in multiple ways. First, I consulted the joint types picture provided to us by Neil.\n\nI decided I wanted to use chanfer joints and to see what I could make using only semi-circles.\n\nFor the semi-circle, I created a center point circle with diameter dimensioned as the “Diameter” parameter. I followed the same process as before for creating a tab. I then used the circular pattern tool with quantity 6 to equally distribute the tabs around the circle. Again, I used the trim tool to remove the outermost line and create tabs that indents into the circle. I then put a line with diameter dimensioned “Diameter” down the center to create the semi-circle.\n\nNext, I used the chamfer tool to create chamfer joints out of the press-fit joints currently on the design. For the circle, using the chamfer or filet tool did not work. For now, I decided to print my current design and see if it even worked before editing the design more.\n\nI exported the file as a .dxf and imported it to my Google Drive. On the PC connected to our Lab’s Epilog Fusion M2 laser cutter, I opened my file in Corel Draw. After ensuring my lines were black, hairline, and to scale, I clicked “Print” under the file dropdown. In the print menu I then clicked “Preferences” and changed my settings to the following:\n\nJob Type: Vector\n\nResolution: 300 DPI\n\nPiece size:\n\nHorizontal = 32 in\n\nVertical = 20 in\n\nVector Settings:\n\nSpeed = 15%\n\nPower = 100%\n\nFrequency = 25%\n\nI then clicked “OK,” “Apply,” and “Send.”\n\nAfter putting cardboard in the printer bed and focusing the laser cutter, I clicked “Go” on the laser cutter.\n\nOnce cut, I removed the pieces from the bed.\n\nImage of Final Kit Pieces:\n\nParametric Design Kit¶\n\nWith the 12 semi-circles, I found multiple ways to assemble different shapes. Some of my favorite ways are shown below:\n\nCrown:\n\nPokemon:\n\nProblems Encountered¶\n\nIn my first parametric design kit iteration, my “TabWidth” dimension was too big. I then adjusted it to be the size of the cardboard thickness, 0.15 in (note the settings I listed earlier are the updated, correct settings that I used in my final working designs). Furthermore, the pieces were really big so I scaled my design down in Corel Draw so that I could more economically make my kit.\n\nReflection¶\n\nThrough this week, I encountered many problems. I really had to dig deep to not become discourage and, instead of feeling embarassed by my mistakes, I had to ask for help. And when asking for help, I had to make sure I was asking them to explain how to do certain things instead of asking them to do it for me. And again, I learned how valuable my fab-academy peers are to my success, growth, and sanity through this process :)\n\nReferences¶\n\nGriffin Orsinger 2023 Fab Acdemy\n\nAdam Stone 2023 Fab Academy\n\nWay Ken Article\n\nJoint Types image from Neil\n\nRyan Kim 2023 Fab Academy\n\nJed Smith 2023 Fab Academy\n\nAlana Duffy Digial Portfolio: EDMI: Thinking Out of the Box\n\nTeddy Warner 2021 Fab Academy"
