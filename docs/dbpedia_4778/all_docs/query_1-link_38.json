        "text": "Family Mini Sessions\n\nMy popular family mini sessions are a great (and inexpensive!) way of capturing some great family memories all year round. This package is just £35 and includes a professional quality 12 x 8\" print and access to an online proof gallery of your images.\n\nAll my family mini sessions are location shoots - sometimes at locations that I know will result in some great images, or sometimes at a location of your choice - somewhere that's special to you and your family, or just somewhere you enjoy going. We're really lucky in Sussex to have some amazing places to use as a backdrop to your session - from the beautiful coast and beaches to the amazing South Downs.\n\nEach mini session lasts around half an hour and all are welcome - parents, children, brothers & sisters, aunts & uncles, grandparents and dogs - the more the merrier! My photography is a blend of unobtrusive, photo-journalistic style photography and portrait and group posed photographs; both can say a lot about your family or friendships and sometimes the best photos come when you are least expecting it! My shoots tend to be a mix of fun, nose blowing, mud, piggy backs and tantrum breaks. And that's just the grown-ups!\n\nAt the end of the shoot I'll process the images into an online gallery of proof images and email you the link. You'll then be able to choose one of these images to be professionally printed (12x8\") as part of the package. If you wanted to purchase more prints then you can thorough your online portfolio (the prices depend on size and finish, but start at £3.46 for individual prints (6x4) or if you want to download hi resolution digital images (which you will have unlimited printing rights to) then these start at £4.29 per image. If you wanted to buy more digital images then I'm able to offer a discounted price depending on the number of images you wanted to buy.\n\nPurchased digital images can be downloaded directly from your portfolio - so there's no waiting for them to arrive in a the post and you can get them onto social media straight away!\n\nI sometimes get asked what people should wear for photo shoots. Though it's aimed more at the photographer than the subject, this is a really good article which will mean your images will look the best they can be.\n\nBooking a family mini session couldn't be easier - either contact me through this site, FaceBook or text / whatsapp / phone - my contact number is here.\n\nIf you have any questions please get in touch!"
