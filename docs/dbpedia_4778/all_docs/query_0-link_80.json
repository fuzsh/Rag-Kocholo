        "text": "BLACKSBURG, Va. (WDBJ) - Virginia Tech has a new Women’s basketball coach, according to Virginia Tech.\n\nMegan Duffy was named the eighth head women’s basketball coach at Virginia Tech, Director of Athletics Whit Babcock announced Wednesday morning. Duffy, who guided Marquette University to the NCAA tournament back-to-back years (2023, 2024), spent five years in Milwaukee where she accumulated a 110-46 record that included a 64-30 mark in BIG EAST play.\n\nDuffy replaces Coach Kenny Brooks, who has accepted the head coaching job at Kentucky.\n\nThe university says Babcock and Duffy agreed to terms on a six-year contract to lead the Hokies.\n\n“I am thrilled to welcome Coach Duffy and her husband Kevin to Virginia Tech,” Babcock said. “An accomplished player and coach, Megan has a relentless work ethic and a demonstrated ability to develop talent and build successful programs.\n\n“She is a proven winner and committed to continuing our women’s basketball program’s momentum. I am confident Hokie Nation will embrace and support Megan as we enter the next chapter of Virginia Tech women’s basketball,” Bacock said.\n\nAccording to Virginia Tech, Duffy’s head coaching career spans seven seasons, five at Marquette and two at Miami (Ohio) and features six seasons of 20 or more wins – leading to an impressive career record of 154-66 (.700). Each year she has guided her club to at least a winning percentage of .600 in league play and she has reached the postseason in every year except for 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nThrough five seasons at the helm at Marquette, Duffy owned the best winning percentage of any coach in that program’s history at 70.5% (110-46). During Duffy’s tenure, the Golden Eagles made four postseason appearances, including three trips to the NCAA tournament, and earned a pair of runner-up finishes in both the regular season and BIG EAST conference tournament.\n\nThe university says Marquette had a notable beginning to the 2023-24 season with the best start in program history at 12-0. The Golden Eagles were one of 10 teams in the country to go undefeated in nonconference play, including winning the Fort Meyers Tip-Off with two wins over Power Five foes – defeating Boston College and Arkansas. She also guided MU to a win over Illinois and her squad earned a ranked victory over No. 20 Creighton.\n\n“I am ecstatic to join Virginia Tech Athletics as the leader of the women’s program,” Duffy said. “The opportunity to continue the winning tradition with Hokie Nation and to be a part of the passionate, savvy Blacksburg community makes this a dream job for me.”"
