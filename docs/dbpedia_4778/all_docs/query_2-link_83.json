        "text": "Throughout the state this month, high school football players are getting kicked off the practice field for the usual reasons.\n\nPoor grades. Bad work habits. Eligibility issues.\n\nBut this one has to be a first:\n\nBig feet.\n\nThis is the plight facing Connor Duffy. He is a likable 6-foot-8 junior at Kingsway\n\nRegional High in South Jersey — a \"gentle giant,\" to use the words of his mother — who is expected to use his 300-pound frame to anchor the offensive line this season.\n\nThe kid everyone calls Bubba is hopeful he might be good enough to earn a college\n\nscholarship in a few years, maybe even to his favorite team, the Texas Longhorns.\n\nJust one problem.\n\nActually, two.\n\nHis size-22 feet. His mother, Gretchen Duffy, cannot find cleats that fit his humongous hoofs, and it isn’t like she hasn’t been looking. She’s been trying to find a pair all summer.\n\n“There’s got to be somebody out there who has cleats his size,” she said Wednesday. “He’s already rolled his ankle once and had to miss a couple days of practice because he’s not getting good traction.”\n\nAll her son can do is wait and worry. It is almost remarkable to think about it, really. This is 2010, a time when you can order up almost any obscure piece of sports equipment imaginable and have it shipped to your house before the end of the next business day.\n\nGretchen Duffy called the customer service hotlines for Nike, Eastbay, Adidas, Under Armor and New Balance. Then she called their corporate offices, too, without a single returned call.\n\nShe took her story to the local media. The Gloucester County Times did a two-page spread, complete with photos. The local radio station picked it up, then three local TV stations.\n\n“It’s a little weird,” Connor said. “I didn’t realize I’d get this much attention for having big feet.”\n\nIt was just the start. From there, it went national. ProFootball.com, one of the most popular NFL web sites, made a plea for help. So did MaxPreps.com, a national site dedicated to high school sports.\n\nAbout the only thing left is a spot with Regis and Kelly or a “Dateline” investigation. “Not only am I amazed at the attention,” Gretchen Duffy said, “I think it’s great. It’s very nice to see the enormous response we’ve gotten from people we’ve never met.”\n\nAnd still ...\n\n“No cleats yet.”\n\nSurprisingly, this is the first time the family has had trouble getting footwear for Bubba, whose nickname was a perfect fit from birth. He weighed 10 pounds, 10 ounces and measured 23 inches when he came into the world, leading his mother to crack, “He came out a toddler.”\n\nHe wore a man’s size 10 by the time he was in sixth grade. His freshman season at Kingsway (he sat out last season), he wore size 18 cleats. Now, they are size 22. At this rate, if he makes the NFL, he’ll actually be able to buy something to cover his feet at the sporting good store.\n\nCanoes.\n\nConnor has relied on special-order shoes from Eastbay and the good will of strangers. His mother had a connection to the Philadelphia 76ers, and 7-0 center Jason Smith donated a pair of his sneakers. They are relegated to the closet now. They’re just size 19s.\n\nThe family is holding out hope that maybe a pro team will help again. The Eagles offered to bring him in for a special fitting, but they’re still waiting to hear back. The Giants, through spokesman Pat Hanlon, said the team would also reach out and offer their help.\n\nGretchen Duffy wants to “pay it forward” and start a website dedicated to trading and acquiring massive footwear of all kinds in hopes that nobody else will have to go through with this again.\n\nOf course, there is the worry that it’ll be Connor going through this again. “I’m supposed to be 7-2,” he said, before adding the ultimate understatement: “I just hope my feet stop growing.”\n\nSteve Politi: spoliti@starledger.com; twitter.com/NJ_StevePoliti."
