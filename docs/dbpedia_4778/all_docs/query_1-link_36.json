His images movingly convey the soul of his subjects and of the places in which they live.\"—Sally Mann\n\n\"From my first encounter with Timothy Duffy’s photographs in the early 1990s, what has struck me to my core is how his subjects speak through their eyes to your senses, using a timeless human language. That feeling never stops once you’ve seen the images. This collection is the finest of the fine.\"—Taj Mahal\n\n\"Beautiful, powerful, and unique photograph work.\"—Eric Lutz, Saint Louis Art Museum\n\n\"With gut-wrenching honesty and compassion, Timothy Duffy transcends himself in work that reveals his deep relationship to his subjects and their worlds. The collection of tintypes in Blue Muse deserves to be heralded as one of the great contributions to the history of photography.\"—Steven Albahari, Publisher, 21st Editions"
