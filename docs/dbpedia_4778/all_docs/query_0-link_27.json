        "text": "Duffy has said if he doesn’t know what he wants to do in a week or so he could take some official visits in the fall but my guess is he’ll announce before his season.\n\nNow, will I be shocked if he delays until after the season? Not at all, I think this is a close race and Duffy has gone back and forth on a leader multiple times. Saying that, he has now been to all of his top three schools multiple times and has a good feel for the school and the staff in place.\n\nEarly playing time is a big deal here so if he does delay his decision, I think it will be to watch the quarterback play of his top teams — especially at Arizona State, where Jayden Daniels could jump to the NFL after a big season — to see how the depth chart could shake out for the fall of 2022.\n\nDuffy was set to announce for ASU before delaying his decision so moving it back definitely didn’t help the Sun Devils. The ASU staff, led by Chris Hawkins, Prentice Gill and Zak Hill, has been on Duffy longer then anyone and has done a great job recruiting him over the last two years.\n\nWe actually thought Duffy might commit to ASU back in December of 2020 but he decided to drop a top 15 at the time. I do think the Sun Devils staff still feels confident they can close on him but the longer his decision drags out, you always have to wonder if there’s something holding him back from committing and will only benefit the other teams on his short list.\n\nAlthough the Noles have a commitment from Nicco Marchiol, who committed back in January, that won’t play a role in Duffy’s decision. Florida State’s plan was to always take two quarterbacks and Duffy has no issue coming in and competing with Marchiol.\n\nThe Florida State staff has always had Duffy as its top QB target and one of the biggest priority recruits this entire recruiting cycle. They have done a very good job selling him that he’ll have a legitimate shot to compete for the starting job as soon as the spring.\n\nDuffy is a supremely confident kid and and likes his chances competing with Marchiol as well as just about anyone in the ’22 class.\n\nA member of Duffy's final five, but one we knew was on the outside looking in, was Penn State. The Nittany Lions already have two quarterbacks committed in Beau Pribula and Drew Allar. Even prior to Allar’s commitment, the Penn State staff hadn’t been talking with Duffy as much as his other schools.\n\nDuffy did visit Happy Valley back in December and had high interest at that time. Once Allar committed however, Penn State was set at the quarterback position and broke off communication with all remaining signal callers.\n\nAnother 'final five' team that had a lot of work to do, the Mountaineers did reach out to Duffy recently and have yet to take a quarterback in the 2022 class. But it's probably a little too late to be a real factor in his recruitment.\n\nIf Duffy delays his decision and decides to take a few official visits, all bets are off. But for now, this one looks like a battle between Arizona State, Florida State and Michigan State.\n\nGetting less buzz than the Sun Devils and the Seminoles, the Spartans have quietly remained in this race and have done a great job recruiting Duffy. He just visited over the weekend for the spring game and said he loved everything about his time in East Lansing.\n\nHead coach Mel Tucker is personally involved in his recruitment and that has played a big role for Duffy. We’ve also mentioned several times how important early playing time is for him is and at Michigan State, Duffy said the depth chart sets up better for him there than anywhere else.\n\nThe Spartans probably still trail Arizona State and Florida State but it's a close race and Michigan State has definitely given Duffy a lot to think about."
