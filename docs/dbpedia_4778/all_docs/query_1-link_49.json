        "text": "Logo vs Photo is one thing I had struggled with for a long time. Are you wondering what would be the best profile picture to have? It’s the first thing people see, (photo or logo) when they go onto your social media channels.\n\nHave a bit of character!\n\nSo, when I started out first I had a Bitmoji character (that’s her above) and I thought she was great, smiling and cute. Then a friend of mine said: “I should replace her, as people will expect her at meetings, training and events, and not me”. I thought OK and decided I should go and get a professional photo done, as I am not great at selfies!\n\nBut just before I changed from my Bitmoji, I had toyed with the idea of replacing her with my logo instead of a photo of me, (again another way for me to avoid getting a photo taken). Logos do work in profile pictures. Lots of businesses use a logo, but I always feel if you use a logo, you need to have a human element in your cover/banner picture to show there are people behind the business as well. So in the end, I decided to bite the bullet and get the photo done.\n\nLogo or No Logo for Profile Picture?\n\nAs I went for the photo shoot, my friend’s comment (about a photo of me in my profile) kept popping up in my head. I realised it was the right choice for me to have a photo in my profile, so that people know it’s me. So I decided my cover/banner picture would show an element of what I do and have my logo in that. You might prefer your logo in your profile and that’s fine too, but do make the most of your cover picture. I got the balance for me, with photo and logo both on view and what I do.\n\nPhoto Call!\n\nI got the headshot done (see above) and I was happy to have a photo that I felt I looked well in. Having a good quality image in your profile is so important. I added it to all my social media channels and website.\n\nTalking of photos, I got caught on camera unexpectedly when I was at an event this week. I’ll be honest, I’m not one for having my photo taken too often even on holidays. Who else is not a fan of getting photos taken? Anyway, to avoid the camera, I’m the one who offers to take everyone else’s photos! I am always thinking my double chin will stand out!\n\nThe photographer at the event, who I have to credit (Marie-Clare Byard of Now Media) did take a nice photo of me (see photo below). She has now made me think “I should make more of an effort and not shy away from the camera”. We all know the saying “People buy from people” and having a good quality and relevant photo of yourself is really important. I got some really nice comments on the “unexpected” photo, so I have decided to use it as a profile picture on all my social media channels.\n\nAgain if you go for your logo instead, it’s really important to have a high quality image so it’s recognisable. Use the same profile logo image across all your social media channels for brand consistency. Well, think of any well known brand that use a logo, they are consistent and their logo is on all their social media channels."
