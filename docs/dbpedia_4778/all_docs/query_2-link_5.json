        "text": "Please see our other website at CoatsofArms.uk for more coats of arms image downloads and design choice.\n\nThe coats of arms or shield images shown on this website are smaller website images, but the image you will receive will be much clearer and of a much higher quality (600dpi). These PNG files have a transparent background which can be printed onto your own background in very high quality to at least A3 (420 x 297 mm or 16.5 x 11.75 inches) in size without any noticeable loss of quality.\n\nYou can also save these PNG (.png) image files into any other preferred format including .jpg (or .jpeg), .tiff, .gif, etc., using a range of image and photo viewers (i.e. Preview on a Mac and Windows Paint) and popular graphics software such as Photoshop, GIMP and similar, or by using a free online image converter. Please see our Help page for download and printing help.\n\nOur Terms of Service page provides information regarding download links and order processing.\n\nThe coats of arms (family crest) and shield images from us are:\n\nFully authentic, as recorded in ancient heraldry documents such as Burke’s General Armory and Riestap’s Armorial Général, amongst others.\n\nNormally the oldest known coat of arms most associated with the surname.\n\nCreated in very high quality as a transparent PNG file. Other sites normally sell as a JPG with a white background, so your own background won’t show through, often at much higher prices.\n\nCarefully checked and rechecked to ensure the details and quality are of our usual high standard.\n\nUnique to us – we create these images ourselves and can create coats of arms images from scratch, normally at no additional cost.\n\nIn addition, you can order any specific coat of arms (or family crest) or country of origin when ordering. Some coats of arms were registered (or granted) in specific countries or areas and there are often more than one coat of arms registered for the same surname. So if there’s one in particular you would like, please let us know when ordering or contact us with the details.\n\nCoats of Arms Image Uses\n\nThe coats of arms (family crest) images you can order from us can be used in many different ways and you are free to use any way you see fit. However, the images must not be resold or shared (made available free or for sale anywhere else) and should not be used for commercial use (specifically, not for use on product images or marketing), so personal use only. Use on business cards and letterheads is permitted. Please contact us to check if you are unsure.\n\nSome great ideas for these coats of arms images:\n\nPrint onto your own paper and backgrounds (including family tree sheets).\n\nDisplay as a digital image.\n\nDisplay as a larger image on a flag or banner – please specify the PNG (or JPG) image size (pixel height) and DPI requirement when ordering from this order page.\n\nUse as the image for customised coasters and place mats.\n\nApply to ceramic and other surfaces (i.e. mugs, drinking glasses and tankards, tiles, plaques, etc.) using waterslide decal transfers and sublimation printing.\n\nIron onto fabrics (t-shirts, cushion covers, white aprons, etc.) with iron-on transfer paper.\n\nDisplay on a house number plaque.\n\nPrint onto printable cross stitch material for that unique gift.\n\nUse as the image for a personalised jigsaw puzzle.\n\nPrint onto blank printable greeting cards for that special personalised greeting card."
