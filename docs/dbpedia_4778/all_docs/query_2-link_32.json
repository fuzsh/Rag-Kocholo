        "text": "Assistant Professor of English\n\nSAAJ Program Director\n\nHumanities and Teacher Education, Seaver College\n\nCAC 106\n\nBiography\n\nChad Iwertz Duffy received his PhD in rhetoric, composition, and literacy from The Ohio State University and is assistant professor of English in the Humanities and Teacher Education division and incoming director of the Social Action and Justice Colloquium. Prior to joining the faculty at Pepperdine, he was assistant professor of English at Bowling Green State University, where he taught in the rhetoric and writing studies doctoral program and mentored student research in digital media theory and production, disability justice, and rhetorical history.\n\nIwertz Duffy's research is located at the intersection of disability studies and digital media composition: design and framing of access/ibility in civic technologies, epistemology of communication access, and digital embodiment and mētis (the rhetorical practice of embodied intelligence and cunning). He has led and collaborated on research funded through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nHis in-process monograph project under contract with University of Michigan Press, Inventing Access: Rhetorical Creation and the Emergent Methodologies of Speech-to-Text Writers, explores how professional speech-to-text writers across the United States and Canada use emergent technologies and dynamic, world-building approaches to rhetorically invent communication access through writing. His recent work can be found in Computers and Composition, Peitho, and the forthcoming anthologies Amplifying Soundwriting: Theory and Practice in Rhetoric and Writing and Methods for Emerging Researchers in Rhetoric and Composition, the latter of which he is also co-editing with Drs. Erin Bahl and Christa Teston.\n\nEducation\n\nPhD, The Ohio State University, 2019\n\nResearch\n\nAwards\n\nPresentations\n\nGrants\n\nIwertz, C., Price, M., & Patrus, R. (2018). In E. Brewer & L.
