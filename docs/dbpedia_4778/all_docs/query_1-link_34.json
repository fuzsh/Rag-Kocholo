        "text": "Print type\n\nAt Rockarchive we carefully select the best print-type to optimise each individual photograph. We have chosen to print this image as a giclée fine art print produced in our London studio.\n\nA giclée print is the most popular way of producing great quality collectable prints in the digital age. It is produced is by scanning an original negative. The image is then outputed onto the chosen paper using specialist inks to make a beautiful archival print.\n\nPaper type\n\nFuji Baryte 310gsm gloss paper\n\n'A series' print paper sizes\n\nOur prints are available in a variety of sizes. Please see below for specific measurements for the 'A series' of paper sizes.\n\nA3 (11.7\" x 16.5\" inches) (29.7 cm x 42.0 cm)\n\nA2 (16.5\" x 23.4\" inches) (42.0 cm x 59.4 cm)\n\nA1 (23.4\" x 33.1\" inches) (59.4 cm x 84.1 cm)\n\nA0 (33.1\" x 46.8\" inches) (84.1 cm x 118.9 cm)\n\nPlease note all our sizes refer to the paper size of the print produced not the image size unless otherwise stated.\n\nDelivery\n\nDelivery charges are added during the checkout process and calculated on a 'by country' basis.\n\nWe aim to dispatch all our prints as soon as possible. If we have the requested print in stock we will arrange to post within a few days. However, in some cases we may require a photographer to sign or send us a print, it will take a little longer to be delivered. In these instances we will notify the customer of when they are likely to receive a print.\n\nIt you have any queries regarding delivery charges or need a print delivered by a specific date, please let us know and we will do our best to sort this out.\n\nVAT\n\nVAT (Value Added Tax) is a tax added to prints and other goods that are delivered to the UK.\n\nPrints delivered to countries outside of the UK do not have VAT charged to them.\n\nOur prices are displayed excluding VAT, so for orders outside of the UK the price shown is the price that will be charged. For UK orders VAT is added during checkout.\n\nThe current UK rate of VAT is 20%. Import charges may apply to orders delivered outside of the EU. Books are exempt from being charged VAT.\n\nIf you have any queries regading VAT please email info@rockarchive.com\n\nFraming\n\nA great print deserves a great frame. At Rockarchive we would be delighted to advise you on how best to select the right frame for your print. Please just let us know when you place your order or contact us once you have received your print and we will discuss the various options with you.\n\nIf you live in London we can arrange to get your print framed for you. Once the print is framed you can either collect it from our London Rockarchive Studio, in Kentish Town or we can arrange for it to be delivered to your London address (at an extra charge).\n\nIf you live elsewhere in the UK, we can arrange to get smaller sized prints framed and shipped to you. However due to postage regulations acrylic (eg perspex) rather than glass needs to be used in the frame.\n\nIf you live outside of the UK, we are sorry we are unable to ship framed prints to you.\n\nFor all framing enquiries please contact us at info@rockarchive.com or call us on +44 (0) 20 7267 4716"
