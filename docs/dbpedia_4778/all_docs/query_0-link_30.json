        "text": "The first day of the national conference of science educators CONASTA71 and it was an absolute thrill to see so many distinguished and dedicated teachers, communicators, and organisations all engaging and sharing best practice. I might have gone a bit silly with the number of selfies but I was just so thrilled to see so many old friends and brilliant new initiatives…! Wonderful to see Lyn Beazley from The Australian Academy of Science, Dr Catherine Wheller and Emily Groves of the National Youth Science Forum (NYSF), Graham Stock of Australian Academy of Technological Sciences & Engineering, Jackie Bondell and many of her colleagues representing the Centres of Excellence including EQUUS, COMBS ASTRO 3D - ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions, ARC Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics, OzGrav Also loved seeing Snowy Hydro Limited’s educational arm the Snowy Stem Academy and hearing about its efforts reaching thousands… Some really exciting projects are coming out of Quantal Bioscience including zoo of poo(?!) citizen science project this #NatSciWeek analysing the microbiome of zoo animals to improve their health. Can’t wait to see how the rest of #CONASTA71 goes after this start!"
