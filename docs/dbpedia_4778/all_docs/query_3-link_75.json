        "text": "I don't often post long winded texts to give my opinion but this time, this topic really tugs at my heart strings and I felt the need to share. After reading article after article about alternative protein companies' not so positive news in the last few days, I feel like it's more important than ever as founders to re-evaluate how we are building our companies. Is it based on transparency, honesty, and hard work? Or is it all fairy dust, broken promises, and unachievable expectations? I have the feeling many founders are hiding behind the statement that 'cellular agriculture is capital intensive' and are raising millions of dollars to build large 'impressive' teams and to buy flashy large scale bioreactors without having done the hard work of optimizing their process at small scale. I get it, small scale work is not sexy and it's harder than ever to convince investors to invest in foundational research. We not only have to re-invent the food system but also the funding system if we want this technology to succeed in the long-term. One of the many reasons it's hard to convince funders to invest is because of overinflated expectations. It's important to be optimistic and show results to be taken seriously by the public and by the large funders. But it's even more important not to burn the public and the large funders with 'white' lies. The science is not ready to scale for most companies and you know what? That's more than normal! We are building something new and important and it's supposed to take time and be scrappy at first. There is no good way to build a startup but I truly believe that hiring the right people with the jack of all trades mentality and re-evaluating where money is being spent is the key to success. You want to go fast? Then you better be fast while covering all of your bases. Make your process more efficient right now, before you scale. Work on your unit economics right now, before you scale. Most important of all, build a strong business case. Right now, before you scale. We are building businesses, not cool science projects. Be humble about it, build value for your customers, and then you can (try to) change the world. We are not being careful as an industry right now. We are creating a deceitful monster and burning bridges with customers/corporates/investors who gave us the benefit of the doubt and their trust will not be given again lightly. I am begging you, please embrace the scrappy mindset, drop the inflated ego, and go back to the foundation.\n\nLessons learned in 35 meetings with investors at SuperReturn and AESIS investor conferences -Serial entrepreneur (~55 years old) on what he did differently the 6th time: spent $20k on market research before starting the company. He said it saved them millions building the wrong product, and in 3 years, they have reached $7m in annual revenue. The market research included words that turn potential customers off, the underserved people, and many qualitative factors related to their buying decisions. -Most impact investors can‚Äôt fund primary agriculture because it‚Äôs too much of an ESG risk. The farms could employ children, e.g., 17-year-olds, and that‚Äôs child labor. Sorry, farmers are too poor to be helped, it seems. Farming is considered a category A ESG risk. -When I mentioned Series A to one investor, he had an allergic reaction: ‚ÄúThe moment I hear Series A and Series B, I know the company is overpriced.‚Äù It is essential to distinguish between VCs that invest in Series X funding rounds priced at some multiple of revenue and PEs that target ‚ÄúSMEs‚Äù with slow, steady growth priced at 5-10x EBITDA. -Need an exit. Some investors say they are only investing in companies with a clear exit opportunity, which usually means potential strategic acquirers are already waiting in the wings.

Rather than battling for smaller shares of existing industries, visionary entrepreneurs look to uncharted waters - following a \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" to create new demand. Pioneered by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, the Blue Ocean Strategy framework helps organizations move beyond cutthroat Red Oceans of head-to-head competition. It identifies \"four actions\" to systematically reduce factors customers now take for granted, elevate those they underestimate, and launch totally new factors to generate major leaps in value for buyers. This opens lucrative Blue Oceans of \"untainted\" new markets rather than fighting over declining resources. To apply Blue Ocean Strategy, companies must undertake rigorous comparative analysis as well as creative thinking to envision entirely new industry benchmarks. It requires challenging assumptions and embracing uncertainties. But for pioneers willing to leave safe harbors behind, the payoff of Blue Oceans is commanding new frontiers of demand and profitability. With continuous ideation and strategic re-envisioning, even mature firms can renew growth through Blue Ocean ventures. Success depends on a systemic, value-innovation mindset rather than incremental improvements alone. Are you ready to take the leap into uncharted waters? The rewards of pioneering a Blue Ocean could set your venture sailing towards an uncontested market space all its own."
