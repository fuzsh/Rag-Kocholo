        "text": "PixelStar empowers users all over the world to feature their content on one of the largest digital billboards, claim their 15 seconds of fame, and take over Times Square!\n\nSo what would you do with your 15 seconds? Download the TSX app to upload your own PixelStar video directly from your mobile device. As long as you keep the Community Guidelines in mind, the creative possibilities are limitless.\n\nRead through the following guide to ensure the best possible outcome. Read through the following guide to ensure your content is featured at its best.\n\nContent\n\nAll uploaded content undergoes a moderation process to ensure it meets the standards of safety, inclusion, and authenticity upheld by the TSX community. Please refer to the quick guide below for some of the most commonly asked moderation questions.\n\nAccepted\n\nâ Your own original photo or video\n\nâ Social media handles\n\nâ Social media profile links\n\nRejected\n\nâ Advertising\n\nâ All other website links / URLs\n\nâ QR codes\n\nâ Phone numbers\n\nâ Political or religious messaging\n\nâ Copyrighted content\n\nTo learn more, read the full Community Guidelines.\n\nLength\n\nPixelStar features are a fixed length of 15-seconds. You may upload a single photo, or short video. If your video is longer than 15-seconds, you will have the opportunity to trim in-app. Videos under 15 seconds will not be accepted.\n\nFormat/Aspect Ratio\n\nPixelStar features display on the TSX Screen in a square aspect ratio. This ensures an optimal viewing experience for the crowd in Duffy Square.\n\nYour feature also plays on the left side of the screen, facing 47th street, which offers a narrower viewable area (2200 x 3480px).\n\nAs part of the content upload process, you will be able to crop and preview your content in-app. On the preview screen please take note of the placement of the TSX stage (bottom center) and feature number (top right), and be sure to leave a generous margin between these areas and any text, or other important detail.\n\nCreative Tools\n\nYou can now add text, or a text design to your content directly from the app. After you trim and crop your content, you will see a preview of your Takeover on the TSX Screen. From there, tap the âEditorâ button with the magic wand.\n\nSound/Audio\n\nThe audio track from your upload will be automatically muted. In the future, we plan to offer functionality to add background tracks and other audio. Stay tuned for updates.\n\nResolution\n\nThe quality and clarity of your content on the big screen is dependent on your capture settings.. The physical dimensions of a Takeover are 3480x3480px (just over 91 feet) therefore we recommend the following settings:\n\nVideo: 4K and 60fps when possible\n\nPhoto: JPEG/H.264\n\nFor more information about your mobile deviceâs shooting settings, visit the manufacturerâs support documentation.\n\nFile Size\n\nFiles over 100MB cannot be processed. Please download the latest version of the app to get an automatic notification if your file is too large.\n\nBest Practices for Large Displays\n\nPixelStar is an opportunity for you to express your unique creativity. With that in mind, there are a few best practices that will help you create the most impactful content.\n\nSimplicity\n\nContent with a clear point of focus, and minimal background is recommended. Avoid content with a lot going on in the background or other visual clutter.\n\nContrast\n\nEnsure your content has strong tonal contrast so it is legible from far distances, in a variety of lighting situations.\n\nBrightness\n\nContent with large areas of full white is overwhelming on large displays. If you are creating content that is graphic or animated in nature, avoid the use of pure white.\n\nMovement\n\nRapid movements and camera shake become amplified on large displays. Avoid content that is fast moving, unstable, or shaky.\n\nText\n\nIf you are creating content that includes any text elements, please keep in mind that the average viewing distance of the TSX screen is 160 feet. Also keep in mind adequate text/background contrast and adherence to the Community Guidelines.\n\nâ\n\nInspiration\n\nMarriage proposals\n\nTo surprise loved one for birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, etc.\n\nTo elevate social content\n\nTo elevate a charitable cause\n\nPlease note: urls, including QR codes, and phone numbers are NOT permitted. No advertising of any kind is permitted. You may include a social media profile link, or handle if desired.\n\nâ"
