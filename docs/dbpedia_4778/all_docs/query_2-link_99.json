        "text": "Brian Duffy began his career as a fashion artist for Harper’s Bazaar. Once exposed to photography, he began his career as a photo assistant. He soon went on to shoot for British Vogue from 1957 to 1963. He also shot several album covers and sessions for musician David Bowie.\n\nHere he worked along with two other photographers David Bailey and Terence Donovan. They were responsible for capturing what came to be known as the “Swinging London” of the 1960s. Many consider them responsible for capturing an era and redefining the aesthetics of fashion photography. Their style is recognized as “documentary” fashion photography.\n\nBefore 1960, a fashion photographer was tall, thin and camp. But we three are different: short, fat and heterosexual!.\n\nIn the 1970’s, Duffy disappeared from view. He also burned all of his negatives. In the documentary below produced by , the filmmakers catch up with the artist to discuss his work and why he destroyed it.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyRPfevrb1k\n\n______"
