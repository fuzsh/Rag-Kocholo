Corbin Burnes turned in 4 2/3 innings, striking out six while allowing two runs on three hits.

Traded from Boston to the Dodgers last February, the 35-year-old Price pitched in spring exhibitions for LA before deciding to go home.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File)NEW YORK – The Mets made a late addition to their starting rotation, agreeing to a $20 million, two-year contract with right-hander Taijuan Walker. Mets manager Luis Rojas cautioned the deal was not yet final but already was viewing the addition as a boost. The Mets have won just two World Series titles, in 1969 and 1986, and last won a pennant in 2015.\n\nNationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021, that Strasburg is in preparation mode not in rehabilitation mode at spring training after having surgery in 2020. So the familiar feel of February spring training has pitchers eager to unleash fastballs, spin a few breaking balls and get ready for the 162-game long haul. “Spring training is 50 days long,” Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais said. But young pitchers — many of whom didn't throw many innings last season — will have to be watched closely. He practiced on the first day of spring training Wednesday but an MRI later revealed the break.\n\nThe San Diego Padres are adding yet another pitcher to their rotation, agreeing to bring right-hander Musgrove to his hometown in a trade with the Pirates, according to a person familiar with the deal. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane, file)SAN DIEGO – The San Diego Padres brought right-hander Joe Musgrove to his hometown team Tuesday, adding yet another starting pitcher in a seven-player trade involving the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets. As part of the agreement, the Padres will send left-hander Joey Lucchesi to New York, and the Pirates will receive catcher Endy Rodríguez from the Mets. Musgrove won a World Series ring with Houston in 2017 before being sent to the Pirates in the trade that sent Gerrit Cole to the Astros in January 2018. Musgrove was the winning pitcher in Game 5 of the World Series against the Dodgers.\n\nIn this screen grab taken from video, Major League baseball player Francisco Lindor answers questions during a virtual press conference introducing him as the New York Mets new shortstop, Monday, Jan. 11, 2021, in New York. (New York Mets via AP)NEW YORK – Francisco Lindor smiled widely for a full 40 minutes, enthralled to join a New York Mets team bulking up under new owner Steven Cohen. I’m not against it,” Lindor said in a news conference from Florida, wearing his new team’s royal blue cap. But the Indians did not think they could afford a multiyear contract with the 27-year-old, so they chose to make the trade. If Lindor agrees to a long-term deal, it likely would become the largest in Mets' history, surpassing the $138 million, eight-year agreement of captain David Wright that covered 2013-20.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians have agreed to trade four-time All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor and pitcher Carlos Carrasco to the New York Mets, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press on Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021. \"They did not come cheaply,” Mets president Sandy Alderson said of Lindor and Carrasco . One of his next big-ticket items figures to be signing Lindor to a long-term contract, something the Indians couldn't do. Carrasco is signed at $12 million in each of the next two seasons, part of a deal that includes a $14 million team option for 2023 with a $3 million buyout. New York also signed injured right-hander Noah Syndergaard to a $9.7 million, one-year deal.\n\nGausman and Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman accepted $18.9 million qualifying offers Wednesday, Nov. 11, receiving one-year deals to stay with their teams rather than test what they could get in free agency. Qualifying offers began after the 2012 season, and only 10 of 96 offers have been accepted. Stroman was acquired by the Mets from Toronto in July 2019 for left-hander Anthony Kay and minor league right-hander Simeon Woods Richardson. Gausman has a 50-66 record and 4.26 ERA in nine seasons with Baltimore, Atlanta and San Francisco. Tomlin gets a $1 million salary next season, and the deal includes a $1.25 million club option with a $250,000 buyout.\n\nSpringer, New York Yankees second baseman DJ LeMahieu and Philadelphia catcher J.T. Realmuto were among just six free agents who received $18.9 million qualifying offers on Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020, from their former teams. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)NEW YORK – Houston outfielder George Springer, New York Yankees second baseman DJ LeMahieu and Philadelphia catcher J.T. Realmuto were among just six free agents who received $18.9 million qualifying offers on Sunday from their former teams. Arizona exercised a $4.25 million option on pitcher Merrill Kelly rather than pay a $500,000 buyout, and Baltiore exercised a $3.5 million option on shortstop José Iglesias rather than pay a $500,000 buyout.\n\nWashington Nationals starting pitcher Max Scherzer (31) throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2020. Porcello (1-1) went seven innings, allowing one run and five hits and retiring the last 10 batters he faced. Scherzer threw 99 pitches on opening day against the Yankees, then an MLB season-high 112 in his next start. WHAT A STEALIn his Mets debut, CF Billy Hamilton stole his first base of 2020 and 300th of his career. Nationals: After Thursday's fifth day off in a week, they start a three-game series Friday against visiting Baltimore.\n\nNew York Mets' Yoenis Cespedes, right, celebrates his solo home run during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Atlanta Braves at Citi Field, Friday, July 24, 2020, in New York. Rules changes for this shortened season delayed by the coronavirus provided a DH in NL games for the first time giving the Mets a perfect slot for Cspedes as he gets back in the swing of things. Edwin Daz, who lost his job as closer during a miserable 2019 season, struck out two in a hitless ninth for the save. Braves All-Star starter Mike Soroka, who won his previous two matchups with deGrom, allowed four hits in six outstanding innings. Coming off consecutive Cy Young Awards, deGrom fanned eight and permitted only a broken-bat single and a walk.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers' Mookie Betts lines out to center field during the fourth inning of an exhibition baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks Sunday, July 19, 2020, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)LOS ANGELES Mookie Betts and the Los Angeles Dodgers struck baseball's first big-money deal since the coronavirus pandemic decimated the sport's economics, a $365 million, 12-year contract on Wednesday through 2032 that removes the top offensive player from next offseason's free-agent class. Betts had agreed to a $27 million, one-year deal with the Red Sox, a salary that has been reduced to $10 million in prorated pay because of the shortened season. His deal is baseball's second-largest in total dollars behind the $426.5 million, 12-year contract for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout covering 2019-30. Betts' average salary of $30.42 million trails Gerrit Cole ($36 million), Trout ($35.5 million), Stephen Strasburg and Anthony Rendon ($35 million each), Zack Greinke ($34.4 million), Justin Verlander $31.3 million), and new teammates Price and Clayton Kershaw ($31 million each).\n\nNew York Mets starting pitcher Jacob deGrom (48) winds up while delivering a pitch during a simulated game, part of the Mets summer training camp workout at Citi Field, Thursday, July 9, 2020, in New York. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)CHICAGO Opening day is next week, and there is concern for New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom and Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo because of back issues. The Mets sent deGrom for an MRI on Wednesday after the right-hander pitched just one inning in a summer camp appearance due to back tightness. Rizzo and deGrom are considered day to day. If deGrom is unable to go on opening day against Atlanta on July 24, Marcus Stroman or Steven Matz could get the ball.\n\n(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)NEW YORK Jeremy Jeffress, Jordan Montgomery, Kevin Plawecki could be playing for free this season, earning salaries lower than what they already received as advances. MLB appears likely to announce a decision after Manfred confers with the 30 controlling owners. The union would claim MLB failed to schedule the longest season possible and ask for money damages. The average salary, stagnated around $4.4 million since 2016, is likely to fall sharply this winter. $40 million is an awful lot of money, but the tax on that is going to be extraordinary.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
