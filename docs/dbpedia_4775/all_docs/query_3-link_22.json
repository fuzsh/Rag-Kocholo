        "text": "Luis Cruz Azaceta (born April 5, 1942) is a Cuban-American painter.\n\nAzateca has been painting and drawing since the late 1970s. In usually large-format works executed with expressive colors, Cruz Azaceta has dealt with themes of urban violence, personal isolation in a large and overcrowded city, the conditions created by mismanaged government, the abuses and oppression of dictatorships, and in a number of works done in the late 1980s, the ravages of AIDS."
