        "text": "Philadelphia lead the East 4 standings, while Cruz Azul hope to advance over Charlotte FC by taking a positive result. Each group's top two teams qualify for the Round of 32.\n\nThis World Cup-style tournament features 47 clubs â 18 from LIGA MX and 29 from MLS â pausing their domestic season for the month-long competition. The winner is crowned champion, and the top three finishers qualify for the 2025 Concacaf Champions Cup.\n\nThe Union have fallen short of expectations in MLS, uncharacteristically sitting 10th in the Eastern Conference table entering the Leagues Cup break.\n\nBut the tides might be turning, as Philly won their last two league matches before starting their Leagues Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Charlotte to put them atop East 4.\n\nHungarian standout DÃ¡niel Gazdag remains the centerpiece of Philadelphia's attack, with 14g/2a in 21 MLS appearances this season. Israeli forward Tai Baribo is coming into his own, tallying four times in his last three league games and scoring the decisive goal in Philly's opening win over Charlotte.\n\nCruz Azul started their Leagues Cup campaign with a 0-0 draw at Charlotte FC before falling 4-2 on penalty kicks. Now, any win over Philadelphia sends them through to the Round of 32 and eliminates Charlotte.\n\nCruz Azul are integrating former Atlanta United striker Giorgos Giakoumakis, who was transferred to the LIGA MX side for reportedly $10 million in June. They also boast former LA Galaxy winger Uriel Antuna.\n\nLed by head coach Martin Anselmi, Cruz Azul have only conceded once in their last five matches across all competitions.\n\nSix other MLS teams face LIGA MX opposition on Sunday.\n\nAtlanta vs. Santos Laguna: It's an elimination game, with the winner advancing to the Round of 32. Santos Laguna were played off the pitch by D.C. United in a 3-0 loss and will look to bounce back.\n\nOrlando vs. San Luis: Orlando defeated CF MontrÃ©al, 4-1, to begin Leagues Cup. Now, they'll look to win their group against San Luis.\n\nPachuca vs. Toronto: After taking two points from their Leagues Cup opener, Toronto welcome the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winners to BMO Field.\n\nSt. Louis vs. JuÃ¡rez: JuÃ¡rez are riding high after a 2-0 win over FC Dallas. Meanwhile, St. Louis are looking to build off a 2-1 victory vs. FC Dallas where new signings Marcel Hartel and Cedric Teuchert both scored.\n\nChivas vs. LA: All eyes are on Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez, who returns to Dignity Health Sports Park with Chivas to face the Galaxy."
