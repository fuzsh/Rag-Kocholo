        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. (Aug. 8, 2024) â Orlando Pride midfielder Ally Lemos has been named to the 21-player roster that will represent the United Statesâ U-20 national team at the 2024 FIFA U-20 Womenâs World Cup in Colombia, with the tournament running from Aug. 31-Sept. 22. Lemos, who was selected by the Pride No. 9 overall in the 2024 NWSL Draft, is one of eight NWSL players on the roster, the most ever for a U.S. team in a FIFA U-20 Womenâs World Cup.\n\nThe USA will open the FIFA U-20 Womenâs World Cup on Sunday, Sept. 1 (4 p.m. ET) against reigning FIFA U-20 Womenâs World Cup champions Spain, will face Morocco on Wednesday, Sept. 4 (9 p.m. ET) and will finish the group stage vs. Paraguay on Saturday, Sept. 7 (7 p.m. ET). The U.S. will play its first two group games at Pascual Guerrero Stadium in Cali and its third at El Techo Stadium in the capital of BogotÃ¡.\n\nIn her rookie season, Lemos has appeared in 14 matches for the Pride across all competitions and made her debut in the Prideâs season opening match against Racing Louisville coming on as a substitute. She made her first professional start on May 5, in the return match against Racing Louisville, playing 87 minutes and helping the Pride earn a 1-0 victory at home."
