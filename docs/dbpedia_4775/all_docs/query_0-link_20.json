        "text": "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—The rosters for Major League Baseball’s annual international amateur showcase are stacked with most of the top players in the 2018 class.\n\nThe event, which is Wednesday and Thursday at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo, typically has not included Cuban players. This year, the showcase includes two big arms from Cuba—righthanders Osiel Rodriguez and Sandy Gaston—who will be eligible to sign on July 2.\n\nCuban outfielder Julio Pablo Martinez, the top international player subject to the bonus pools, won’t be there, since he turns 22 in April. He’s not yet a free agent, so he could figure into either the current 2017-18 signing period or the upcoming 2018-19 class.\n\nThe rosters are mostly players from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, but the showcase will also include prospects from Brazil, Curacao, Mexico, Colombia and Panama.\n\nThese are 12 of the key players to watch at the showcase, with the full rosters below. All of the highlighted players are 16, unless noted otherwise.\n\nOsiel Rodriguez, rhp, Cuba\n\nRodriguez dazzled at the Nations Baseball Showcase in San Pedro de Macoris in November, reaching 96 mph and flashing a sharp, above-average curveball, all shortly before his 16th birthday later that month. Before he left Cuba, Rodriguez led the country’s 15U national league in ERA (0.39) in 2016, with 127 strikeouts and 27 walks in 69 innings.\n\nSandy Gaston, rhp, Cuba\n\nGaston and Rodriguez are the two players who will be of the most interest to scouts at the showcase. Multiple scouts said they have seen Gaston touch the upper 90s, which is uncanny velocity for a 16-year-old. He has battled with his control at times, but he has shown enormous arm strength for his age. It’s not clear where Gaston will end up yet, though the Marlins have shown interest.\n\nOrelvis Martinez, ss, Dominican Republic\n\nMartinez is expected to be the highest paid player this year, with a bonus likely to push past $3 million. He’s 6-foot-1, 190 pounds with good bat speed, generating power with ease from right-center field over to his pull side. Martinez is a shortstop for now, though he projects to be a strong, physical player who would profile well at third base.\n\nNoelvi Marte, ss, Dominican Republic\n\nMarte, who is linked to the Mariners, is one of the top offensive threats in the class. He has performed well in games, showing a sound sense of the strike zone and big power, though a position switch could be in his future.\n\nMisael Urbina, of, Venezuela\n\nUrbina, 15, is one of the better athletes in the class, a righthanded hitter with plus speed and good range in center field. The Twins are connected to Urbina.\n\nFrancisco Alvarez, c, Venezuela\n\nAlvarez has a stout build, and while some scouts think he will need to improve his defense to stay behind the plate, he has one of the best track records of hitting and hitting for power in games in Venezuela. The Mets are linked to Alvarez.\n\nMarco Luciano, ss, Dominican Republic\n\nLuciano is a premium prospect with a sound swing, good bat speed and plus power, driving the ball out of the park to all fields with ease during batting practice. He has taken it to the games as well, hitting opposite-field home runs against live pitching and pulling one over the fence in MLB’s Dominican national showcase in November. The Giants are tied to Luciano.\n\nDiego Cartaya, c, Venezuela\n\nCartaya looked as good as advertised at MLB’s Venezuelan national showcase in Cartagena, Colombia last month, when he went 2-for-4 and drew three walks. Arguably the best Venezuelan prospect this year and one of the top overall 2018 prospects, Cartaya has a short swing, good plate discipline and strong defensive tools as well. The Dodgers are the favorites to sign him.\n\nGabriel Rodriguez, ss, Venezuela\n\nRodriguez, who turns 15 on Thursday, is one of the most advanced hitters from Venezuela. He has a simple swing from the right side and a long track record of hitting well in games, including at the COPABE 15U Pan American Championships last year. Rodriguez lacks speed and he could slide over to third base. Rodriguez is linked to the Indians.\n\nAlvin Guzman, of, Dominican Republic\n\nThe Diamondbacks are the frontrunners to sign Guzman, who sticks out for the high physical upside in his athletic 6-foot-1, 165-pound frame. He has shown good defensive instincts, a plus arm and good bat speed from the right side.\n\nJose Rodriguez, c, Venezuela\n\nWhile Rodriguez will have to improve his defense to remain at catcher, scouts highest on him see an offensive-minded catcher with an advanced bat from the right side of the plate. The Rangers are connected to Rodriguez.\n\nEduardo Lopez, of, Dominican Republic\n\nLopez, 15, is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, and while he’s not physically imposing, he’s one of the most polished players in the Dominican Republic. He has a short, easy stroke from both sides, with feel for the barrel and the strike zone, and while he’s not a burner, he has shown good defensive instincts. Lopez is linked to the Red Sox.\n\nCatchers\n\nFrancisco Alvarez, Venezuela\n\nDiego Cartaya, Venezuela\n\nAntonio Gomez, Venezuela\n\nAgustin Ramirez, Dominican Republic\n\nJose Rodriguez, Venezuela\n\nFernando Villalobos, Mexico\n\nInfielders\n\nJose Bonilla, Dominican Republic\n\nWarming Bernabel, Dominican Republic\n\nMarco Luciano, Dominican Republic\n\nNoelvi Marte, Dominican Republic\n\nOrelvis Martinez, Dominican Republic\n\nAdinso Reyes, Dominican Republic\n\nJunior Sanquintin, Dominican Republic\n\nAlexeis Azuaje, Venezuela\n\nMiguel Droz, Venezuela\n\nEduardo Garcia, Venezuela\n\nBranlyn Jaraba, Colombia\n\nRainer Polonius, Curacao\n\nRyson Polonius, Curacao\n\nGabriel Rodriguez, Venezuela\n\nOutfielders\n\nJose de la Cruz, Dominican Republic\n\nEduarqui Fernandez, Dominican Republic\n\nAlvin Guzman, Dominican Republic\n\nEduardo Lopez, Dominican Republic\n\nJose Lopez, Dominican Republic\n\nFreddy Valdez, Dominican Republic\n\nDeivis Alvis, Venezuela\n\nGabriel Martinez, Venezuela\n\nLuis Matos, Venezuela\n\nMisael Urbina, Venezuela\n\nEduardo Vaughan, Panama"
