        "text": "In a very surreal moment, Boston Red Sox legendary slugger David “Big Papi” Ortiz was slated to be honored today by the state senate – but not in Massachusetts.\n\nThe New York State Senate.\n\nNew York, as in where the Yankees, the archrivals of Ortiz and the Red Sox, play baseball.\n\nIt’s part of a recognition of the 20th anniversary of the 2004 World Series Championship Red Sox, the very same Red Sox that came from behind in the American League Championship Series to defeat the Yankees.\n\nThe resolution to honor Ortiz was sponsored by Sen. Luis R. Sepulveda of 32nd State District. In his resolution, Sen. Sepulveda wrote that he not only wanted to recognize Ortiz for his contributions to the Red Sox, helping them to three World Series titles en route to the Hall of Fame, but also for his philanthropic work as well.\n\n“In New York, Ortiz's philanthropic efforts have significantly impacted the community, particularly through the David Ortiz Children's Fund, which collaborates with prestigious hospitals like Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital – both of which serve numerous New York families; these collaborations provide critical cardiac services to children from both the Dominican Republic and New York State,” the resolution reads.\n\nIt also mentions how Ortiz’s “philanthropic reach in New York includes participation in high-profile events like the Maestro Cares Gala, which supports disadvantaged children in Latin America and the U.S., the Derek Jeter Celebrity Invitational, and the CC Sabathia PitCCh In Foundation Charity Softball Game at Yankee Stadium, events that significantly benefit youth programs and enhance the lives of inner-city youth in New York.”\n\n“These activities not only underscore his commitment to philanthropy but also solidify his connection to New York State, leveraging his celebrity status to raise awareness and substantial funds for various causes, thus directly benefiting children and communities across the state,” it reads.\n\nIn his career, Ortiz had a batting average of .303 against the Yankees and a .567 slugging percentage, with 53 home runs and 171 runs batted in.\n\nDespite being one of the biggest thorns in Yankee pitchers’ sides, the resolution goes on to refer to Ortiz as a “beloved figure in New York.”"
