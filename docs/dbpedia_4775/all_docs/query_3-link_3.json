        "text": "Watch Luis F. Cruz share his experience of responding to resistors.\n\nLuis F. Cruz, PhD, is a sought-after presenter, coach, thought leader, and accomplished author in the field of education. His over 30 years of practical experience as a teacher and an administrator at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, coupled with his ability to effectively communicate research-based approaches focused on the need to ensure high levels of learning for all students, has earned him acknowledgment and praise from an array of education communities around the country.\n\nBorn to immigrant parents from South America, Dr. Cruz blends his experience as an English Learner raised in a low-income community in Los Angeles with his professional experience and insight to advocate the need for public school educators to acknowledge that there is a disconnect between our inherited and antiquated public school system and the diverse student population we aim to serve today. He, therefore, advocates that public school educators learn and commit to redesigning a school system never designed to ensure high levels of learning for all the students in schools and classrooms across our country.\n\nIn addition to being an accomplished and highly desired keynote speaker, Dr. Cruz has established a skilled and effective manner for helping audiences, both small and large, learn about the Professional Learning Community at Work® and Response to Intervention at Work™ processes, transformational leadership, school culture, the role of a guiding coalition, and creating environments conducive to the success of students learning English as an additional language—to name a few of the themes for which he is contacted.\n\nDr. Cruz is the best-selling author of Time for Change: Four Essential Skills for Transformational School and District Leaders, which he co-authored with Dr. Anthony Muhammad, and is currently working on several books focused on strengthening multitiered systems of support for student intervention and enhancing learning outcomes for emergent bilingual students.\n\nPLC at Work®\n\nPLC at Work® experts have proven success in leading the PLC at Work process in a school or district. Work with them to implement a focus on learning, build a collaborative culture, and create a results orientation that leads to sustained, substantive school improvement.\n\nLearn more\n\nRTI at Work™\n\nRTI at Work experts focus on learning for all students and will empower you to build your own timely, targeted, and systematic intervention program. Work with them to implement a results-driven program that provides targeted instruction at all tiers of intervention.\n\nLearn more\n\nTransforming School Culture\n\nTransforming School Culture experts will help you examine the assumptions, beliefs, expectations, and habits that comprise your school’s culture, to ensure a productive and functional environment. Work with our experts to develop the ability to properly respond to challenges and adversity.\n\nLearn more"
