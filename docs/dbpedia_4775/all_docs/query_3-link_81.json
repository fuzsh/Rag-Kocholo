        "text": "A Santa Maria man has been charged with murder and other felonies in connection with a fatal assault at a mini-storage facility over the weekend.\n\nCarlos Israel Loyola, 30, is accused of killing Jesus Luis Cruz Martinez, 35, of Santa Maria. (The victim’s name also has been listed at Jesus Luis Martinez Cruz.)\n\nAt approximately 7:40 p.m. Sunday, Santa Maria police officers responded to a self-storage complex on the 1900 block of North Preisker Lane in north Santa Maria for a reported assault, according to Lt. Daniel Rios.\n\nOfficers found Martinez unconscious and suffering from serious head trauma, Rios said.\n\nThey provided aid until Santa Maria Fire Department and American Medical Response ambulance personnel arrived.\n\nMartinez was transported to Marian Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nOfficers learned that the alleged assailant had stolen the victim’s car and fled the area after the attack.\n\nPolice found Loyola driving the victim’s vehicle in an unincorporated area in San Luis Obispo County — near the Highway 101/Highway 166 interchange north of the crime scene.\n\nLoyola attempted to evade officers but collided with a marked police car, rendering the vehicle inoperable, Rios added. No one was injured during the crash.\n\nSanta Maria officers safely took Loyola into custody less than 30 minutes after the initial call for service.\n\nThe criminal complaint filed in Santa Maria Superior Court includes three felony charges — murder, evading a peace officer with wanton disregard, and taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent.\n\nLoyola also faces a special circumstance, or sentencing enhancement, that the killing occurred during a robbery.\n\nUnder a special circumstance case, if convicted the defendant could be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nHowever, the District Attorney’s Office does not intend to seek the death penalty in this case, Deputy District Attorney Lindsey Bittner said.\n\nDuring Loyola’s arraignment hearing on Tuesday, he did not enter a plea, and the case was continued to Aug. 6 in Department 6.\n\nLoyola remained in custody without bail Wednesday at the Northern Branch Jail ."
