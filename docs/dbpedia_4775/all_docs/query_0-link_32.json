        "text": "Contributed by Richard Cuicchi\n\nAs we anxiously wait for the 2022 MLB season to kick into gear, we have to look back at the history of the game to get our baseball “fix”. We need only to go back to last season to recall several of the games in which family ties played a role. Throughout the majors in 2021, there were fifteen pairs of brothers, four pairs of cousins, and three sets of brothers-in-law. Following are some of their game highlights.\n\nThe most unique occasion of brothers playing on the same team occurred on August 12, when Austin and Andrew Romine were batterymates for the Chicago Cubs against the Milwaukee Brewers. There have been prior situations in baseball history where brothers have been pitcher and catcher in the same game. But what makes this one unique is Andrew, normally an infielder, was brought into pitch for the Cubs in a blowout game with his brother behind the plate. They were the first brother duo to appear as batterymates since 1962 when Larry and Norm Sherry played for the Dodgers.\n\nAustin, who had just been activated by the Cubs before the game, came in as catcher after a pinch-hit appearance. Andrew, who started the game at shortstop, went to the mound in the ninth inning with the Brewers leading, 16-3. Andrew wasn’t able to shut the Brewers down as he gave up a solo home run to Luis Urias. However, he did manage to strike out Jackie Bradley Jr. to end the inning. It wasn’t the first time Andrew took a turn on the mound. He had seven previous appearances as pitcher, including a game on September 30, 2017, in which he played all nine positions.\n\nWho does a mother root for when one of her sons bats against his brother in a game? That’s the situation the mother of Bradley and Kyle Zimmer experienced when they played against each other on September 27. Cleveland Indians outfielder Bradley got the best of Kyle, who had just entered the game as a reliever for Kansas City, by hitting a solo home run in the bottom of the eighth inning. It was Bradley’s eighth homer of the season. The last time a brother homered off his brother was Joe Niekro, who hit his only major-league home run off his brother Phil on May 29, 1976.\n\nMexican-born brothers Luis and Ramon Urias posted highlights on the same day on April 13, when each hit their first home run of the season. However, both of their home runs came in losing causes, as Ramon’s Orioles lost to the Seattle Mariners, 4-3, and Luis’s Milwaukee Brewers lost to the Cubs, 3-2.\n\nAaron and Austin Nola had only faced each other in a practice game while playing for LSU until they squared off on August 21 for the first time in the majors. Aaron, the Philadelphia Phillies ace pitcher, was in his seventh season, while Austin was in his third as a catcher with San Diego. Aaron had a perfect game going through six innings that included striking out Austin and inducing him into a pop fly out. Aaron lost his perfect game and no-hitter in the seventh inning, including a walk to Austin, but pitched into the eighth inning until being relieved. The Phillies wound up losing the game in the tenth inning, 4-3.\n\nBrothers Jordan and Justus Sheffield opposed each other as pitchers for the first time in a spring training game on March 4. Jordan was in his first major-league season with the Colorado Rockies, while Justus was in his fourth major-league season and third with the Seattle Mariners. Jordan is a righty, while Justus throws from the left side. They have yet to pitch against each other in a regular season game. While both were in the minor leagues in 2019, they were on opposing teams for a series but were not in the game at the same time.\n\nWhen the Cleveland Indians acquired Josh Naylor in 2020, it set up the possibility he and his brother Bo will be teammates. They went to the Indians’ spring training camp together in 2021, but Bo wound up going to Double-A Akron for the regular season, while Josh played a full season with the Indians. The brothers had played on the same team only once in their careers, which occurred in a youth league.\n\nBrothers Jake and Joe McCarthy have yet to play in the majors at the same time, but they did see action with Triple-A teams that opposed each other on July 1. Jake played for Reno against Joe’s Sacramento team. Jake got one hit, while Joe went hitless. In a later game in the series between the two teams, both players had RBI-doubles. Joe had made his major-league debut with the San Francisco Giants in 2020, but did not appear in the majors last season, while Jake wound up making his debut with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2021.\n\nRafael Devers and his cousin Jose Devers played against each other for the first time. Jose made his major-league debut with the Marlins in 2021, while Rafael was in his fifth season with the Red Sox. On May 28, the two teams faced each other, but it was an uneventful game for both players who went hitless in Boston’s 5-2 win. The cousins had grown up together in the Dominican Republic.\n\nWhen the Cincinnati Reds called up Delino Deshields Jr. last September, he joined his father Delino Deshields Sr., the first-base coach for the team. It was the first time they had ever shared a dugout. They had previously been on opposing teams in 2019 and 2020.\n\nOther major-league brother pairs who played against each other in the same game numerous times in 2021, as well as in earlier years, included Corey (Dodgers) and Kyle (Mariners) Seager and Yuli (Astros) and Lourdes Jr. (Blue Jays) Gurriel.\n\nOther major-league cousins who played on opposing teams in 2021, as well as in earlier years, included John Andreoli (Padres) and Daniel Bard (Rockies).\n\nContributed by Richard Cuicchi\n\nPlaying wiffle ball in the backyard with a brother was an experience familiar to a lot of us. Playing on the same team with a brother in Little League, Babe Ruth, or high school baseball is something we might have also experienced. But what about brothers playing with or against each other in the major leagues? Not too many can say they know what that’s like.\n\nBut it happens every once in a while. Some of the occurrences go relatively unnoticed. Others like the Alou brothers (Felipe, Matty, and Jesus) attracted significant attention in September 1963 when the trio of Dominican players started in the outfield together in a game for the San Francisco Giants. Their improbable feat is often the subject of baseball trivia question\n\nThis year’s major-league season saw several instances of brothers playing on opposite sides of the diamond and one in which the brothers teamed up as batterymates.\n\nBrothers Jordan and Justus Sheffield pitched in the same game during Spring Training in March. Justus started for the Seattle Mariners, while Jordan entered the game in the fourth inning in relief for the Colorado Rockies. It was the second time they had crossed paths in a professional game as opponents, the first in a minor-league series in 2019. The brothers roomed together during spring training camp.\n\nBrothers Corey (Dodgers) and Kyle Seager (Mariners) have opposed each other as major leaguers several times. On April 19 this season, Corey homered in a 4-3 loss to the Mariners. On May 11, Kyle homered in a 6-4 loss to the Dodgers. Even though Kyle is the older of the two, his nickname is “Corey’s Brother.”\n\nYuli and Lourdes Gurriel are Cuban-born major-leaguers whose father Lourdes Sr. was a baseball star for the Cuban National team in the 1980s and 1990s. The brothers played against each other in a series between Houston and Toronto on May 7-9. Houston’s Yuli outshined his brother with a 4-for-4 performance in one of the games. Yuli wound up leading the National League in batting this season with a .319 average.\n\nVeteran major-league brothers Andrew and Austin Romine became the first brother batterymates since brother Norm (catcher) and Larry Sherry (pitcher) played together on June 28, 1962. Andrew, normally an infielder, was brought in to pitch for the Chicago Cubs in a blowout game against the Milwaukee Brewers on August 12. His catcher was his brother Austin. With the Brewers already holding a 16-3 lead Andrew pitched the final inning of the game, yielding a home run and a single and striking out one batter.\n\nOn August 21, Aaron Nola and his brother Austin played against each for the first time since both were playing in a spring practice game as teammates at LSU. Aaron, who pitches for the Philadelphia Phillies, faced Austin with the San Diego Padres in three at-bats. Austin struck out, flied out, and walked against his brother, who had a perfect game through the first 6 1/3 innings. The Padres wound up inning, 4-3, in 10 innings.\n\nOn September 27, Cleveland’s Bradley Zimmer got bragging rights when he a 408-foot home run off his brother Kyle who was pitching in relief for the Kansas City Royals. The Indians won, 8-3. The brothers, who were both first-round draft picks, had faced each other three times previously this season. It was the first time a brother homered against his brother since 1976. (See Niekro brothers below.)\n\nBelow is a sampling of other games in baseball’s long history where MLB brothers played with or against each other.\n\nAlex Gaston of the Boston Red Sox broke up his brother Milt’s no-hitter in 1926, hitting the first pitch of the ninth inning for a single.\n\nThe St. Louis Browns’ Rick Ferrell almost broke up kid brother Wes’s no-hitter on April 29, 1931; but the official scorer ruled Rick’s 8th inning at-bat an error and Wes claimed his no-hitter. On July 19, 1933, the brothers homered in the same inning for opposing teams. Rick hit his off Wes, only one of 28 total home runs in an 18-year career.\n\nMort and Walker Cooper were the pitcher-catcher combo for six seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals and one with the New York Giants. During 1942 through 1944 with the Cardinals, each of the brothers made the all-star team and helped their team win three National League pennants and two World Series championships.\n\nClete and Ken Boyer played against each for the first time in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series between the Yankees and Cardinals. In Game 7, Clete (Yankees) and Ken (Yankees) each hit home runs in the Cardinals’ win.\n\nBrothers George and Ken Brett played against each other for the first time in an exhibition game on March 27, 1976. George, playing for the Kansas City Royals, hit a home run off Ken of the New York Yankees. In 20 regular-season plate appearances against his brother, George never homered once.\n\nJoe Niekro (Astros) hit the only major-league home run of his 22-year career against his brother Phil on May 29, 1976. Joe’s seventh-inning home run against his older brother tied the game, with the Astros ultimately defeating the Braves, 4-3. Joe got the winning decision, giving up only four hits and one earned run in eight innings. Phil recorded the loss.\n\nContributed by Richard Cuicchi\n\nCOVID-19 put a damper on most things this year, including the 2020 MLB season. The changes that came about because of the pandemic even had an impact on the number of family relationships in the majors and minors this year and next year as well. It affected players, managers, coaches, scouts, and front-office personnel of all the big league organizations.\n\nWe had an abbreviated spring training, with players barely have gotten in game-ready condition when they were sent home in mid-March. Then we had a truncated regular season that lasted 60 games in a little more than two months. We didn’t have a minor league season from which big-league teams could draw needed players throughout the season. Instead it was replaced by each major-league team having a taxi or reserve squad of 60 players at their disposal during the season. The draft class was the smallest in history because MLB limited the selections to five rounds. Although not COVID-related, MLB also announced its plan to reduce the number of minor-league affiliates by 25 percent in 2021.\n\nConsequently, fewer players were able to break into major league rosters coming out of spring training, since there wasn’t sufficient time for them to hone and demonstrate their skills. There were fewer call-ups to big-league rosters because of the limited pool of available players to draw from. In fact, the shortened season saw the fewest prospects promoted since 1878. There were fewer number of amateur players drafted, which will impact the population of major and minor league rosters in the future. Players with baseball in their bloodlines were impacted by all of these factors.\n\nThe duties of player development and minor-league field and front office personnel were dramatically curtailed, although most organizations continued to pay their salaries, albeit reduced, for parts of the season. There will be 25 percent fewer affiliated players in the minors next season, although independent leagues may fill some of the gap. Many of those jobs and roster spots, including those held by staff and players with baseball relatives, will be eliminated in 2021 because of the negative financial impact of COVID this season.\n\nDespite all of these factors, baseball’s bloodlines weren’t completely put on hold this season. Here are some highlights of baseball’s relatives in 2020 in several categories.\n\nOpponents\n\nBrothers Hunter and Braden Bishop met on the field for the first time in their lives in an early spring training game this year. Hunter was a first-round pick of San Francisco in 2019, while Braden, who is five years older, is in his second major-league season for the Seattle Mariners. They had a memorable moment together in the game when Hunter fielded an overthrow from the Giants catcher while Braden stole second and then made his way to third on the overthrow. For a brief moment, Hunter thought about trying to throw out his brother at third base, but then realized he didn’t have a shot on the play.\n\nDavid Bell was in his second season as manager of the Cincinnati Reds in 2020. His brother Mike was named the bench coach for the Minnesota Twins under manager Rocco Baldelli for 2020, setting up the occasion for them to be in opposing dugouts for a three-game series starting on September 25. The Twins won two of the games, helping them earn the Central Division title.\n\nOn August 14, cousins Franmil Reyes and Ivan Nova faced each other for the third time in a major-league game. The Indians’ Reyes got the best of Detroit’s Nova with a two-run home run and an RBI single, as the Indians won, 10-5.\n\nBrothers Corey and Kyle Seager are six years apart in age and never had a chance growing up to play on the same baseball diamond. On August 17, their respective teams (Dodgers and Mariners) faced each other, with both of them homering in the game won by Los Angeles, 11-9. The two brothers were productive that day, combining for five hits, four runs scored, and five RBIs.\n\nWhen outfielder Kyle Zimmer was called up by the Kansas City Royals on July 25, it set up the possibility that he could face his brother Bradley, who pitched for the Cleveland Indians. They both appeared in the same game on July 26 but wound up not opposing each other. They’ll have to wait until the 2021 season.\n\nTeammates\n\nJosh Naylor was traded by San Diego to the Cleveland Indians at the trade deadline on August 31. Naylor’s brother Bo currently plays in the Indians farm system, so they could find themselves as teammates for the Tribe down the road. The Naylor brothers are natives of Canada, and both were Number 1 draft picks by their respective teams.\n\nIn Toronto’s first game of the 2020 season on July 24, the first four batters in their lineup, who also made up the entire infield, were sons of former major-leaguers. Shortstop Bo Bichette, son of Dante Bichette, led off for the Blue Jays. Second baseman Cavan Biggio, son of Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, batted second. First baseman Vlad Guerrero Jr., son of Hall of Famer Valdimir Guerrero Sr., was in the third spot, while third baseman Travis Shaw, son of Jeff Shaw, batted cleanup. Each of the players got at least one hit in the game, with Biggio hitting a home run.\n\nExtending the multi-generation families\n\nThree-generation major-leaguers are a rarity, with the Boones, Bells, Hairstons, and Stephensons as the only ones in baseball history. The next candidate for a three-generation family would likely be accomplished by Trei Cruz, son of Jose Cruz Jr, and grandson of Jose Cruz Sr. Trei was drafted in the third round out of Rice University by the Detroit Tigers. He had previously been drafted out of high school in 2017 by the Washington Nationals.\n\nThe Boone family could become the first four-generation family, since Jake Boone signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Washington Nationals during the summer. Jake, who played three seasons as shortstop at Princeton University, is the son of Bret Boone, nephew of Aaron Boone, the grandson of Bob Boone, and the great grandson of Ray Boone.\n\nMLB Debuts\n\nSons of former professional players who made their MLB debuts this year include:\n\nDaulton Varsho, July 30, Diamondbacks outfielder/catcher, son of Gary Varsho (1988-1995)\n\nBrandon Leibrandt, August 23, Phillies pitcher, son of Charlie Leibrandt (1979-1993)\n\nKe’Bryan Hayes, September 1, Pirates third baseman, son of Charlie Hayes (1988-2001)\n\nDerek Hill, September 4, Tigers outfielder, son of Glenallen Hill (1989-2001)\n\nDaz Cameron, September 9, Tigers outfielder, son of Mike Cameron (1995-2011)\n\nMickey Moniak, September 16, Phillies outfielder, grandson of Bill Moniak (minor leaguer, 1958-1963)\n\nRyan Weathers, October 10, Padres pitcher, son of David Weathers (1991-2009)\n\nLatest MLB manager with family ties\n\nLuis Rojas made his major-league debut as manager of the New York Mets, joining Aaron Boone, David Bell, and Terry Francona as current managers with major-league fathers. Rojas is the son of Felipe Alou, who managed the Expos and Giants during 1992 through 2006.\n\nFamily Ties Overseas\n\nOn September 17 in South Korea, Preston Tucker hit two home runs in his Kia team’s win over Samsung in the Korean Baseball Organization league. Nearly 12 hours later and over 7,000 miles apart, his brother Kyle homered for the Houston Astros in their defeat of the Texas Rangers, 2-1. That’s probably the first time brothers hit homers on the same day on two continents.\n\nMel Rojas Jr, son of former major-league pitcher Mel Rojas Sr., is currently leading the Korean Baseball Organization in all the Triple Crown categories. The 30-year-old was a former third-round pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2010, but he never played at the big-league level.\n\nDrafted players\n\nIn addition to Trei Cruz, some of the players drafted in 2020 with major-league ties include:\n\nTyler Soderstrom was drafted by the Oakland A’s in the first round. He is the son of Steve Soderstrom who was also a first-rounder of the 1993 draft by San Francisco. They are the tenth father-son duo to be first-round draftees.\n\nCarson Tucker was drafted in the first round by the Cleveland Indians. His brother Cole Tucker, currently a Pirates shortstop, was also a first-round pick. They are the ninth set of brothers as first-round picks.\n\nBryce Jarvis was a first-round pick of the Diamondbacks, while his father Keith Jarvis was a 12-year starter.\n\nPlayers not drafted\n\nSome of the draft-eligible amateur players with family ties were victims of the smaller draft class and didn’t get selected. In normal years, some of those players would likely have been drafted in the later rounds. A few of the more recognizable names include:\n\nPeyton Glavine, son of Tom Glavine\n\nDante Girardi, son of Joe Girardi\n\nMarquis Grissom Jr., son of Marquis Grissom Sr.\n\nCasey Dykstra, son of Lenny Dykstra\n\nRyan Berardino, grandson of Dwight Evans and Dick Berardino\n\nDarren Baker, son of Dusty Baker\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFormer Chicago White Sox pitcher Richard Dotson (1979-1990) was surprised this year to find out through DNA testing that his biological father was former major-league pitcher Turk Farrell (1956-1969). Dotson’s deceased mother had never spoken of her relationship with Farrell.\n\nWashington Nationals ace Max Scherzer struck out Toronto’s Vlad Guerrero Jr. on July 29. Scherzer also struck out Vlad’s father ten years earlier.\n\nContributed by Richard Cuicchi\n\nThis is the second of a series of reviews that will take a look at family relationships in each of the thirty major league organizations.\n\nBaseball has more family relationships than any other professional sport. They existed in the earliest days of the sport in the 1870s, and they are abundant in today’s game, perhaps more so than ever before. Baseball has been called a “generational” sport for several reasons. One of them is that multiple generations of families have been active in the game–grandfathers, fathers, sons, and brothers. And now even some great-grandsons are starting to show up on rosters. Uncles, nephews, cousins and in-laws are part of the extended family of baseball relatives, too.\n\nBaseball bloodlines aren’t limited to just the players. Family trees with a baseball background have commonly included managers, coaches, scouts, owners, executives, front office personnel, umpires, and broadcasters, as well.\n\nDodgers history is filled with examples of players and non-players that had relatives in baseball. Some of the more noteworthy ones include:\n\nNorm and Larry Sherry formed one of the few brother batterymates in major league baseball history. Norm was a backup catcher for the Dodgers during 1959 – 1962. Larry was one of the Dodgers’ primary relief pitchers during the same timeframe. In their first game together on May 7, 1960, Norm hit his first major league home run to give the winning decision to his Larry.\n\nAl Campanis was the general manager of the Dodgers from 1968 to 1987, after having briefly played with Brooklyn in 1943. His son, Jim Campanis, got his major league start as a catcher with the Dodgers in 1966, but was later traded by his father to the Kansas City Royals.\n\nMaury Wills was the speedster shortstop of the Dodgers, who made major league history by breaking Ty Cobb’s record for most stolen bases (101) in 1962. Wills’ son, Bump, had a six-year major league career with the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs and finished in the Top 10 in stolen bases in five seasons.\n\nWalter O’Malley owned the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1950 to 1979, during which time they won eleven National League pennants and four World Series titles. His son, Peter O’Malley became co-owner of the Dodgers with his sister Theresa O’Malley Seidler upon Walter’s death. Peter’s and Theresa’s sons later became part-owners of the San Diego Padres.\n\nFast forwarding to more recent times, here are some highlights of baseball relatives in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization during 2016.\n\nCorey Seager is one of the hottest young players in all of baseball. The 22-year-old shortstop turned in a National League Rookie of the Year performance in 2016, while also finishing 3rd in the MVP Award voting. He is the second of three Seager brothers to reach the majors. Brother Kyle is a six-year veteran with the Seattle Mariners. The third baseman had the best season of his career in 2016, posting 30 HR, 99 RBI and hitting .278. He was selected to the All-Star team in 2014. Brother Justin completed his fourth year in the Mariners organization, but has yet to have a break-through season.\n\nJoc Pederson is another big part of the Dodgers’ future, completing his second full season with 25 HR and 68 RBI. His father, Stu, had a “cup of coffee” (eight games) with the Dodgers in 1985 among his twelve professional seasons in the Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays organizations. Joc’s brother, Tyger, was also drafted by the Dodgers, but has spent most of his three pro seasons in the independent leagues.\n\nAdrian Gonzalez, a career .290 hitter, has been the most consistent position player for the Dodgers in their last four seasons winning the NL West Division. In each of his last eleven major-league seasons, he has played 156 or more games. He is a five-time all-star selection. His brother, Edgar, played two seasons for the San Diego Padres in 2008 and 2009, when he was a teammate of Adrian. Altogether, Edgar put in 15 pro seasons that included time in Mexico and Japan.\n\nCarl Crawford was once one of the bright, young stars with the Tampa Bay Rays, but his four seasons with the Dodgers have largely been a major disappointment. Injuries have been a big factor in limiting his playing time. With the Rays, the speedy outfielder led the American League in stolen bases for four seasons and was selected for the All-Star Game in four seasons. His cousin, J. P. Crawford, is a shortstop who is currently the top prospect in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. Carl’s uncle, Jack Crawford, played in the California Angels farm system during 1981-1983.\n\nScott Van Slyke has primarily played as a reserve outfielder in his five seasons with the Dodgers. He had his best season in 2014 with 11 HR and 29 RBI, while posting a .910 OPS. His father is Andy Van Slyke, who played thirteen major-league seasons, primarily with the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates. Andy’s career includes three All-Star Game selections and five Gold Glove Awards. Scott has two brothers who also played professionally. Eric spent one season in the rookie league with the Kansas City Royals organization, before two seasons in the independent leagues. Brother A. J. was an outfielder/first baseman for four seasons in the Cardinals organization.\n\nCharlie Culberson spent parts of the 2016 season on the Dodgers’ major league roster, after playing for the San Francisco Giants and Colorado Rockies in 2012-2014. The infielder hit .299 in 34 Dodgers games. He represents the third generation of his family to play pro baseball. His grandfather, Leon, a six-year major leaguer primarily with the Boston Red Sox, was a member of the 1946 American League championship team. His father, Charles, was drafted by the Giants 1984 and spent five seasons in the minors with the Giants and Kansas City Royals organizations. Charlie’s great uncle, James, spent one minor-league season in the New York Giants organization.\n\nKenley Jansen, initially a catcher when he started out in pro baseball, was one of the top closers in the National League in 2016. The 6’ 5”, 270-pound Curacao-born pitcher recorded a 1.83 ERA and 47 saves, while putting up a 0.670 WHIP and almost 14 strikeouts per nine innings. Although eligible for free agency at the end of last season, Jansen re-signed with the Dodgers to keep their bullpen intact. Kenley’s brother, Ardley, was an outfielder in the Atlanta Braves organization for seven seasons, but never made a major-league roster.\n\nLouis Coleman was a mainstay in the Dodgers’ bullpen last year, appearing in 61 games, mostly in middle relief. He was signed as a free agent by the Dodgers after spending five seasons on the Kansas City Royals major-league roster. Louis is the brother-in-law of Nathan Adcock, who was a former teammate in the Royals organization. Adcock last appeared in the majors in 2015 with the Cincinnati Reds as a relief pitcher.\n\nSeveral other Dodgers players, who briefly appeared on their major-league roster during 2016, had relatives that played in the major leagues: Will Venable (son of major leaguer Max Venable), Austin Barnes (nephew of major leaguer Mike Gallego), and Brock Stewart (son of minor leaguer Jeffrey Stewart and brother of minor leaguer Luke Stewart).\n\nThe Dodgers’ pipeline of baseball relatives includes several top minor league prospects whose relatives were former major-league players: Adam Law will be seeking to become one of the few three-generation players in baseball history to all appear in the major leagues, following father Vance Law and grandfather Vern Law); Cody Bellinger is a promising slugger whose father is former major leaguer Clay Bellinger; Lenix Osuna is the son of former major leaguer Antonio Osuna and cousin of current major leaguer Roberto Osuna).\n\nOff the field, the 2016 Dodgers had their share of baseball relatives, too.\n\nTheir broadcast booth was filled with a number of former Dodgers players who had relatives in pro baseball: Nomar Garciaparra (brother of Michael Garciaparra, currently a scout in the St. Louis Cardinals organization); Manny Mota (father of five sons who played pro baseball, including two in the majors); Orel Hershiser (father of Jordan Hershiser, a former minor leaguer, and brother of former Dodgers minor leaguer Gordie Hershiser); Fernando Valenzuela (father of Fernando Valenzuela Jr., a former minor leaguer). Additionally, Jaime Jarrin is the long-time Spanish broadcaster for the Dodgers. His son, Jorge, also shares the microphone as a Dodgers broadcaster, while his grandson, Stefan, played briefly as a Dodgers minor leaguer.\n\nBob Geren is currently the bench coach for the Dodgers. He has two sons, Bobby and Brett, who were drafted by the Oakland A’s organization, but never signed contracts to play professionally.\n\nBrian Stephenson is a scout in the Dodgers organization, after having pitched for seven league seasons in the Chicago Cubs and Dodgers minor league systems. His father, Jerry, was a major league pitcher during 1963-1970, ending his career in the Dodgers organization. His grandfather, Joe, was a major league catcher who played briefly during 1943-1947 and went on to a scouting position with the Boston Red Sox.\n\nNick Francona works in the Dodgers front office in player development. Drafted in the 40th round by the Boston Red Sox in 2004, he didn’t sign to play for them, instead serving in the Marine Corps in Afghanistan. He is the son of Terry Francona, the current manager of the Cleveland Indians and previous skipper of the Red Sox where his teams captured two World Series titles. Nick’s grandfather, Tito, played in the majors for nine different teams from 1956 to 1970. An outfielder/first baseman, Tito hit .363 for the Indians in 1959.\n\nBaseball’s Relatives Website\n\nThe entire list of 2016 active major and minor league players and non-players can be retrieved at:\n\nhttps://baseballrelatives.wordpress.com/2016-family-ties/"
