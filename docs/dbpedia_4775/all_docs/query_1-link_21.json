        "text": "The New York Yankees announced that they have signed infielder Luis Cruz to a major league contract. Cruz, 29, elected free agency on Tuesday after refusing an outright assignment from the Los Angeles Dodgers, who designated him for assignment last Friday.\n\nCruz will share time at shortstop with Alberto Gonzalez, and was 0-for-3 with an error in his debut on Wednesday night. To make room on the 25-man roster, the Yankees placed Jayson Nix on the 15-day disabled list.\n\nAfter spending eight years in the minors, Cruz appeared in 56 major league games with the Pirates (2008-2009) and Brewers (2010) before spending the 2011 season with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate. In November 2011, he signed a minor league deal with the Dodgers and was called up to the bigs in July after a successful 74 games with Triple-A Albuquerque. He instantly became a fan favorite in Los Angeles, and hit .297 with 6 HR and 40 RBI in 78 games with the Dodgers.\n\nCruz's 2013 season has not been nearly as successful, as he hit only .127 with 1 HR and 6 RBI in 45 games. The Dodgers decided to cut ties last week, and the Yankees picked him up in hopes that he can return to the type of player he was in 2012."
