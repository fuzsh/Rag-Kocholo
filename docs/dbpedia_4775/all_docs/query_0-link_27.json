        "text": "If infielder/outfielder Wenceel Perez makes his Major League debut for the Detroit Tigers this summer, the special day will come about eight years after he initially signed with the organization out of the Dominican Republic.\n\nAnd if Perez is like most prospects, it will come about a decade after he unofficially agreed to sign with the Tigers.\n\nThe road from international prospect to big-leaguer is incredibly long.\n\nIf you’re seeking instant gratification, the international market might not be your cup of tea. It will be years before any judgment -- good or bad -- can be made about the Tigers’ class of 2024, which was announced this week.\n\nHow the system works\n\nPlayers from the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada are subject to the annual amateur draft. Players from just about everywhere else go through the international signing process beginning at the age of 16. The overwhelming majority of players signed are from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, although many countries are represented.\n\nThe international signing period runs from Jan. 15-Dec. 15. Most of the high-profile prospects sign in a flurry at the start of the period (although the deals have often been agreed to years in advance).\n\nNowadays there’s a “hard cap” on international spending. That is, teams may only spend a certain amount -- usually about $5 or $6 million -- on signing bonuses and can’t go over. Previously, teams could pay a tax to exceed their bonus pool -- and many free-spending clubs did so.\n\nThe league has sought an international draft to bring order to a somewhat chaotic international signing process but hasn’t been able to reach an agreement with the players’ union in negotiations during the last two collective bargaining agreements.\n\nUntil then, it’s a messy, highly imperfect system, but one that can reap rich rewards for some teams.\n\nHere’s a look back at some notable names from the last dozen signing periods.\n\n2023 signing period\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: Switch-hitting catcher Enrique Jimenez, a native of Barcelona, Venezuela, was the highest-rated prospect. He signed for a reported $1.25 million. The Tigers also signed Venezuelan shortstop Maikol Orozco (No. 44) and Dominican outfielder Cristian Perez (No. 48).\n\nAround the league: The San Diego Padres spent $5.6 million on catcher Ethan Salas and likely have no regrets. Incredibly, the 17-year-old has already reached Double-A.\n\n2022 signing period\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: The Tigers signed Venezuelan shortstops Javier Osorio ($2.2 million) and Samuel Gil ($1.2 million), both of whom were consensus top-25 prospects.\n\nAround the league: The Nationals paid out the top bonus of the cycle to Cuban outfielder Cristian Vaquero. The Yankees nabbed Dominican shortstop Roderick Arias.\n\n2021 signing period\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signing: The Tigers signed Dominican shortstop Cristian Santana for a franchise-record $2.95 million and Venezuelan shortstop Abel Bastidas for $1.175 million. They were teammates at Class A Lakeland in 2023.\n\nAround the league: Cuban outfielder Yoelkis Céspedes ($2.05 million, White Sox) was considered one of the most advanced hitters, but he’s run into strikeout trouble in Double-A and his progress has stalled. Dominican shortstop Armando Cruz fetched $3.9 million from the Nationals. Astros outfielder/second baseman Pedro Leon ($4 million) just repeated Triple-A. He has tantalizing speed but must cut down on strikeouts.\n\n2019-2020\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signing: Outfielder Roberto Campos ($2.85 million bonus) represented the Tigers’ biggest investment on the international market in years. A native of Cuba, Campos had been largely out of sight since moving to the Dominican Republic. Because he didn’t heavily participate in the normal prospect circuit, he was off the radar and considered a surprisingly rich signing. He spent 2023 at Class A (advanced) West Michigan.\n\nAround the league: Two Dominicans got the richest overall deals. Outfielder Jasson Dominguez ($5.1 million) went to the Yankees and shortstop Robert Puason ($5.1 million) to the Athletics.\n\nDominguez made his much-anticipated Major League debut in 2023. Most think he’ll be a solid regular, but will be a star?\n\nThe best prospect in this class might end up being another Dominican outfielder, Emmanuel Rodriguez, who went to the Twins for $2.5 million.\n\nNotable: Two top-50 prospects -- Dominican infielder Junior Caminero and Venezuelan catcher Jeferson Querto -- were relative bargains, signing with Cleveland ($225,000) and Milwaukee ($200,000), respectively.\n\nThe Rays got Caminero for virtually nothing in a trade.\n\nThe Rockies picked up two nice prospects in Dominican infielder Adael Amador ($1.5 million) and Cuban outfielder Yanquiel Fernandez ($295,000).\n\n2018-2019\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: Dominicans Jose De La Cruz ($1.8 million) and Adinso Reyes ($1.45 million). Both have yet to advance beyond Lakeland and have largely fallen off the prospect radar.\n\nAround the league: Victor Victor Mesa (a package deal with his younger brother, Victor Jr.) received $5.25 million from the Marlins, although he was a considerably older Cuban player and thus not the best comp for the typical teenage signee. He’s struggled mightily at the upper levels of the minor leagues.\n\nNotable: Dominican shortstop Marco Luciano ($2.6 million, Giants) and Venezuelan catcher Diego Cartaya ($2.5 million, Dodgers) also scored big deals. Both have become top prospects. Luciano is likely to be the Giants’ everyday shortstop in 2024.\n\nThe Rangers signed Luisangel Acuna, younger brother of Ronald, for $425,000. He was traded to the Mets in the Max Scherzer deal.\n\n2017-2018\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: The Tigers signed Venezuelan shortstops Alvaro Gonzalez ($1 million) and Carlos Irigoyen ($550,000). Gonzalez remains in the system. Irigoyen was released last year.\n\nAround the league: Dominican shortstop Wander Franco ($3.8 million, Rays) was long the consensus No. 1 overall prospect in baseball and he looked to be a franchise-changing star. His career is now on hold amid a police investigation in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe second-best prospect in the class, Venezuelan catcher Daniel Flores, tragically passed away at the age of 17 just two weeks after being diagnosed with testicular cancer.\n\nThe Mariners landed Dominican outfielder Julio Rodriguez ($1.75 million) and later signed him to a long-term deal to anchor the franchise. He’s been in the top 10 in MVP voting in each of his first two seasons.\n\nNotable: The Astros signed pitcher Luis Garcia for almost nothing out of Venezuela. He was a huge part of the club’s rotation for two seasons until undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2023.\n\nInfielder Eddys Leonard, who the Tigers acquired last August, signed with the Dodgers for $200,000 in this cycle.\n\n2016-2017\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signing: The Tigers signed Dominican shortstop Wenceel Perez ($550,000), who was added to the 40-man roster this winter after a breakout campaign in 2022 and followed it up with a solid full season in Toledo in 2023. Perez has played all over the field and could find his way to Detroit as a utility man.\n\nAround the league: Venezuelan infielder Kevin Maitan originally signed with Atlanta ($4.25 million), but was given free agency amid the Braves’ international signing scandal. He moved over to the Angels ($2.2 million) but never advanced beyond Double-A and was released last year.\n\nNotable: The Padres blew through their spending cap, signing Cuban left-handed pitcher Adrian Morejon ($11 million) and Dominican shortstop Luis Almanzar ($4 million). The Padres paid a hefty penalty for their spendthrift ways; nowadays there’s a hard international cap and signings like this wouldn’t be possible.\n\nThe Tigers also signed right-handed pitcher Keider Montero ($40,000) out of Venezuela in this cycle.\n\n2015-2016\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: The Tigers didn’t have a large spending pool this year and chose to be judicious. The two most expensive signees were Dominican catcher Gresuan Silverio ($300,000) and Dominican outfielder Juan Ramirez ($185,000). Silverio was released in 2022; Ramirez’s claim to fame is being the player to be named later in the Justin Verlander deal.\n\nAround the league: The Dodgers paid a whopping $16 million for Cuban right-handed pitcher Yadier Alvarez, who struggled with a variety of issues and never made the big leagues.\n\nThe Twins went big for Dominican shortstop Wander Javier ($4 million), who struggled to hit. and retired in 2023.\n\nAmong big spenders, the Blue Jays fared the best, signing outfielder Vladimir Guerrero Jr. out of the Dominican Republic for $3.9 million. He’s done OK so far.\n\nNotable: The Washington Nationals got star outfielder Juan Soto out of the Dominican Republic for $1.5 million. Infielder Fernando Tatis Jr. signed for $700,000 with the White Sox, who then traded him to the Padres. Both Soto and Tatis are elite, franchise players.\n\nAndres Gimenez, who blossomed into a top-tier infielder for the Guardians, signed with the Mets for $1.2 million out of Venezuela.\n\nFormer Tigers pitcher Rony Garcia signed with the Yankees for a relatively modest sum in this cycle. Tigers utility man Andy Ibanez signed with the Rangers for $1.6 million.\n\nFormer Tigers third baseman Isaac Paredes signed with the Cubs out of Mexico for $800,000.\n\n2014-2015\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signing: They signed Dominican outfielder Julio Martinez for $600,000. He was released in 2019 without climbing beyond short-season Class A.\n\nAround the league: Three Dominican hitters went for around $3 million each: Dermis Garcia, Adrian Rondon and Gilbert Lara. Only one (Garcia) reached the big leagues for a cup of coffee.\n\nNotable: Onetime Tigers pitching prospect Franklin Perez signed with the Houston Astros for about $1 million during this cycle. He was acquired in the Justin Verlander trade and has since retired due to injuries.\n\nThe Padres signed current Indians closer Emmanuel Clase for a modest $125,000.\n\nThe steal of the season belongs to the Braves, who signed Ronald Acuna Jr. for about $100,000.\n\n2013-2014\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: Another year without much spending or much success. The Tigers signed Venezuelan catcher Elys Escobar ($350,000) and Dominican infielder Hector Martinez ($400,000).\n\nAround the league: The Cubs nabbed Eloy Jimenez ($2.8 million) and Gleyber Torres ($1.7 million) in the same class. Not too shabby. Both made the big leagues with other clubs, of course.\n\nThe Red Sox did well by signing Rafael Devers for $1.5 million. The Yankees gave roughly the same amount to Leonardo Molina, who didn’t fare as well.\n\nRemember Marcos Diplan, who was very briefly a Tiger? He signed with the Rangers for $1.3 million.\n\nNotable: Former Tigers infielder Willi Castro signed with the Cleveland Indians for $825,000 during this cycle.\n\nThe Braves got Ozzie Albies ($350,000) out of Curacao.\n\nThe Twins did well too, getting Luis Arraez for just $40,000.\n\n2012-2013\n\nTigers’ big-ticket signings: This should be a class for the Tigers’ to celebrate. Alas, the top player was traded away fairly quickly. Willy Adames ($420,000) has become a very good everyday shortstop, first for the Rays and now the Brewers. He’ll be a free agent after this season, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if the Tigers were among the teams interested in his services.\n\nAround the league: The Rangers led the way by signing Jairo Beras for $4.5 million. After struggling at the plate, he tried his hand at pitching. That didn’t go well, either.\n\nAmong the other big signings this year: Taiwanese shortstop Tzu-Wei Lin ($2.05 million, Red Sox); Dominican shortstop Amed Rosario ($1.75 million, Mets); Venezuelan left-handed pitcher Jose Castillo ($1.55 million, Rays); and Dominican right-hander Juan Carlos Paniagua ($1.5 million, Cubs). All but Paniagua reached the big leagues.\n\nNotable: Former Tigers prospect Sergio Alcantara signed with the Diamondbacks for $700,000 during this cycle. He was later acquired in the J.D. Martinez trade.\n\nThe Tigers also signed left-handed pitcher Gregory Soto and outfielder Jose Azocar for modest sums during this signing period. Soto is a two-time All-Star, now with the Philadelphia Phillies; Azocar has played in the big leagues for the Padres."
