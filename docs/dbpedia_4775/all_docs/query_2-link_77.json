        "text": "Just before gametime of the winner-take-all Canada-USA matchup, and I thought I would only have one thing to be livid about, except I now have three: the announcement of the disciplinary action to be taken after the Mexico-Canada brawl, the issues of relegation being unsettled, and the lineup put out by Joe Torre and Team USA.\n\nStarting with the Mexico-Canada brawl, if you haven’t seen any of it, I have you covered here, and if this were to happen in any regular season game, you know there would be fines and suspensions abound. However, as JJ Coop from Baseball America wrote, there will be no suspensions beyond the ejections that happened last night. Luis Cruz gets off free, Team Mexico pitcher Arnold Leon, who took the orders, gets to continue on not understanding the tiebreakers, and Cale Iorg, who threw a water bottle into the stands after it hit his pitching coach, will see the field. This is just a snapshot of whom should be punished, yet here we are. I believe guys like Cruz and Team Mexico outfielder Eduardo Arredondo, who plays exclusively in the Mexican professional league and not in MLB, should at least have been suspended for one round of WBC play, whether they had plans on playing again or not. Same for Cale Iorg, who should have just focused on finding out who threw the water bottle, instead of potentially hitting an innocent bystander. The WBC had a chance to levy some suspensions, and in reading Coop’s article, I understand how tough it’d be to replace some of those players, but giving everybody a free pass doesn’t set it up well for brawls in the future, because what’s going to stop anybody from holding back the fists?\n\nMore Coop articles, because the World Baseball Classic has no idea how 2017 is going to work in terms of relegation. What that “relegation” means, is that in 2009, teams with the worst record from their pools would have to qualify for the round of 16 by playing other teams in a separate Pool of four teams. Canada, Spain, Brazil, and Chinese Taipei all had to go through it for this tournament, and with China beating Brazil, and Australia finishing 0-3 in their Pools, you’d think those two teams would have to go through that again, but hold that thought, because the WBC might want to change the rules if that means teams like Venezuela and the USA have to go through that round facing much weaker competition. While sometimes change is good, making a change because your players are going to have to do extra work is ridiculous. If the US or Venezuela has to play extra games to qualify, I don’t care, although I’m sure their ticket sales department cares, especially if those teams don’t make it.\n\nLastly, today’s lineup that got rolled out is plus one Shane Victorino, but minus one big bat in Giancarlo Stanton because Joe Torre has made promises to MLB managers to make sure players get their playing time. I can understand his predicament, and you do want to honor a promise made to other friends and baseball partners, but it just makes this game look like what @TrippingOlney called “a glorified Spring Training game.” In an elimination game, you should be able to put your best on the field, but it’s a shame that the USA can’t do that.\n\nI’m very much into the WBC, I watch a lot of the games, I want it to be a bigger thing, but when these things happen, how can I defend it to people trying to get into it? I can’t. The people running the show are not realizing the full potential of the product they have in front of them, and it’s making the event suffer, holding it back from moving forward and further globalizing the game it’s trying to market.\n\nMLB.tv is being horrible in allowing me to re-watch today’s Mexico-Canada broadcast, so I have to rely on articles from Deadspin and MLBAM embedded video clips, which is fine, but the original broadcast on MLB Network had the best views, in my opinion. To give you some background on this game, this matchup was getting a little chippy early, more through actions than in words until the 9th inning. Team Canada catcher Chris Robinson had a couple of aggressive slides into 2nd base to break up a double play, the second of which he had his right spike pretty high up in the air. Karim Garcia from Team Mexico had a collision with Craig Robinson at the plate, but to be fair to Mr. Garcia, Robinson was very much in his running lane. Fast forward to the 9th inning, and Craig Robinson, who was clearly on Mexico’s good side, laid down a bunt hit.\n\nUPDATE: HERE’S THE EMBEDDED VIDEO OF THE FIGHT:\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nWhat you’ll notice is Mexico 3B Luis Cruz takes exception to this move, and makes what appears to be an order to the pitcher to hit the next batter in the ribs.\n\nThe full video of the bunt + ordering is below.\n\nThen it begins to go down with the pitch\n\nthen the benches clear\n\nthen we find someone to dance with\n\nthen Larry Walker calms down Alfredo Aceves, whom he said he thought he could “see Satan in his eyes”\n\nwhich makes me wonder what’s in Sergio Romo‘s eyes\n\nThat’s scarier than any look my wife has ever given me, I’ll tell you that much. Credit Larry Walker with trying to keep some peace, as apparently he told Adrian Gonzalez to stay back because “you’re too important to this game to get hurt in this.”\n\nYou’ll notice that someone threw a water bottle that hit the Canadian pitching coach\n\n…and Cale Iorg threw it back in the direction he thought it came from, which might not have been where it actually came from\n\nProbably not going to help his cause going forward.\n\nThe Canadian coach commented on what he thought was the reason for the brawl was:\n\nMy take:\n\nYes, I was too lazy to repeat what I put in a tweet. Really though, is it so hard to be grown ups? I know I’m probably in the minority on at least this part, but just because one thing happened to you doesn’t mean you have to sink to their level and possibly make things worse. No suspensions have been announced yet, and there is a possibility it could affect the regular season playing time of some major leaguers that were involved in this incident.\n\nItaly 2-0, Mexico 1-1, USA 0-1, Canada 0-1. Tomorrow, it’ll be Italia and the US while Mexico and Canada will square off. As of right now, the run differential is Italy +11, Mexico +2, USA -3, and Canada -10. That’s only important if there’s the three-way tie for first I think there will be — yes, I think the US will beat Italy tomorrow behind an excellent Ryan Vogelsong and the US will take care of a weaker Canada squad.\n\nMexico came at R.A. Dickey, whose knuckleball was spinning more than he probably wanted it do, thus making it not dance as much as it has in the past regular seasons, resulting in Mexico mashing. Yovani Gallardo was fooling the USA batters, and saw themselves just going out 1-2-3 for the first third of the game. The bullpen of Mexico barely budged, giving up a couple of dead ducks, and Sergio Romo goes 13 pitches and Mexico pretty much avoided elimination.\n\nAdrian Gonzalez this WBC has been nothing short of amazing, posting a near 90% OBP, including a monster 2-R HR to RCF to put Mexico on top 4-0. The Los Angeles Dodgers with Gonzalez and Luis Cruz played a part in all five runs for Mexico tonight, which should make Dodger fans very pleased. Mexico will play Canada tomorrow at 11:30AM PST.\n\nWhile Joe Torre‘s lineup construction was a talking point amongst twitter folk tonight, there is still enough power and contact within the lineup to do damage in a nine-inning game. If the US can mercy Canada like Italy did, and can IF they can punish Italy, which I’m not positive they can, this loss tonight will just be a learning moment for this team. Ultimately, I think the USA will still pull it out because of the talent they have on that roster, though they should consider tomorrow a “must-win” as they go in to face Pool D leader Italy at 6PM PST."
