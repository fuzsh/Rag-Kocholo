        "text": "By Bill Center\n\nThe Padres have a number of top pitching prospects closing in on the Major League rotation such as Chris Paddack, Logan Allen and Cal Quantrill.\n\nBut the secret to any farm system is depth — having prospects across the field.\n\nSo this Padres On Deck report focuses on three teenaged pitchers getting their starts in the lower echelons of the system — Luis Patiño, Joey Cantillo and Omar Cruz.\n\nA closer look at the trio by where they are in the system:\n\n— Luis Patiño is already ranked the Padres’ №12 prospect by MLB Pipeline although he will be 19 throughout the 2019 season. The 6-foot, 190-pound right-hander is a native of Colombia and signed with the Padres as a member of the 2016 international class.\n\nPatiño spent the entire 2018 season as one of the youngest pitchers in the Midwest League with Single-A Fort Wayne. In fact, Patiño was four years younger than the average age of a Midwest League player.\n\nPatiño, who came to the Arizona Rookie League midway through the summer of 2017 from the Dominican Summer League, began the 2018 season in extended spring training.\n\nHe made 17 starts with Fort Wayne and finished with a 2.16 earned run average, a 1.07 WHIP and a .220 opponents’ batting average. He allowed 25 runs (20 earned) on 65 hits and 24 walks with 98 strikeouts in 83 1/3 innings. That’s a 4.1-to-1 strikeout to walk ratio while averaging 10.6 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nIn 2017, Patiño had a 2.25 ERA, a 1.09 WHIP and a .208 opponents’ batting average in his debut professional season split between the Dominican Republic and Arizona, where he made nine appearances (eight starts) with a 2.48 ERA.\n\n— Joey Cantillo, who turned 19 last Dec. 18, finished the 2018 season with a start at Fort Wayne after making 11 appearances (nine starts) in the Arizona Rookie League. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound left-hander was the Padres16th-round pick in the 2017 Draft out of Kailua (Hawaii) High.\n\nCantillo made his professional debut in the summer of 2017 with seven appearances in the Arizona Rookie League with a 4.50 ERA over eight innings.\n\nThis past summer, Cantillo gave up 18 runs (11 earned) on 33 hits and 12 walks with 58 strikeouts in 45 1/3 innings in Arizona. He had a 2.18 ERA, a 0.99 WHIP and a .198 opponents’ batting average with a 4.8-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio while averaging 11.5 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\n— Omar Cruz will turn 20 on Jan. 26. The 6-foot, 170-pound left-hander is a native of Sonora, Mexico, and was a member of the Padres’ 2017 international signing class. He made his professional debut in the Arizona Rookie League last summer.\n\nCruz split the 2018 season almost evenly between Arizona and Short-Season Single-A Tri-City of the Northwest League. Overall in an almost even split, Cruz made a combined 11 appearances (10 starts) in his debut season with a 1.91 ERA, a 1.32 WHIP and a .221 opponents’ batting average.\n\nIn a combined 42 1/3 innings, Cruz allowed 13 runs (nine earned) on 34 hits and 22 walks with 59 strikeouts in 42 1/3 innings — for an average of 12 ½ strikeouts per nine innings."
