        "text": "Following the official roster reveals, Olympics.com brings you the full list of team rosters for the upcoming 2023 World Baseball Classic (WBC) that takes place from 8–21 March 2023.\n\nEach team submitted a Final Roster of 30 players, including at least 14 pitchers and two catchers per team. Additionally, teams were allowed to name 10 pitchers to a Designated Pitcher Pool, and pitchers on this list may be called up to each team's 30-man active Final Roster to replace a fellow Designated Pitcher Pool pitcher at any point between rounds during the tournament. As such, some team rosters listed below include more than 30 names.\n\nThese rosters are correct as of 15 February 2023 and may not reflect later changes, such as injury withdrawals, replacements from the Designated Pitcher Pool, or other team transactions. Positions are listed according to how they are recorded on the MLB.com World Baseball Classic rosters, and not necessarily the players' regular positions.\n\nWorld Baseball Classic 2023: Full schedule and how to watch live\n\nPool A (Taichung)\n\nChinese Taipei\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 14th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: Second round, 8th place (2013)\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Chang Yu-cheng (aka Yu Chang in the MLB; free agent)\n\nChinese Taipei is the host federation for Pool A, with games in Taichung.

The Netherlands team is the most successful European side in WBC history, having reached the semi-finals twice. Xander Bogaerts – who has just signed a mega-deal with the San Diego Padres – is the team's biggest name on the hitting front.\n\nManager: Hensley Meulens\n\nPitchers: Mike Bolsenbroek, Dennis Burgersdijk, Jiorgeny Casimiri, Tom de Blok, Aaron de Groot, Jaydenn Estanista, Dylan Farley, Wendell Floranus, Arij Fransen, Lars Huijer, Ryan Huntington, Kenley Jansen, Jair Jurrjens, Antwone Kelly, Kevin Kelly, Shairon Martis, Eric Méndez, Scott Prins, Pedro Strop, J.C.

As WBC rules allow teams to select players whose parents were born in a country, multiple Italian-American MLB players have been called up to the squad, including the Angels' David Fletcher, whose mother is Italian.\n\nManager: Mike Piazza\n\nPitchers: Vincenzo Aiello, Glenn Albanese Jr, Alex Bassani, Joe Biagini, Matteo Bocchi, Ryan Castellani, Tiago da Silva, Alessandro Ercolani, Nick Fanti, Matt Festa, Sam Gaviglio, Matt Harvey, Joe LaSorsa, Braxton Lorenzini, Joey Marciano, Brian Marconi, Vinny Nittoli, Andre Pallante, Jeffrey Pasantino, Nicolo Pinazzi, Claudio Scotti, Mitchell Stumpo, Vin Timpanelli, Michele Vassalotti, Stephen Woods Jr\n\nCatchers: Vito Friscia, Alberto Mineo, Dominic Miroglio, Brett Sullivan\n\nInfielders: David Fletcher, Robel García, Nicky Lopez, Miles Mastrobuoni, Vinnie Pasquantino, John Valente\n\nOutfielders: Ben DeLuzio, Dominic Fletcher, Sal Frelick\n\nPanama\n\nThird WBC appearance (team missed 2013 and 2017)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2009 (first round, 15th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: First round, 14th place (2006)\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Jaime Barría (Los Angeles Angels), Christian Bethancourt (Tampa Bay Rays)\n\nTeam Panama is the fifth seed in Pool A, having won the WBC Qualifier held on home soil in Panama City last October. It's the team's first appearance in the WBC in 14 years, and they will hope to avoid finishing last in the pool.\n\nManager: Luis Ortiz\n\nPitchers: Harold Araúz, Alberto Baldonado, Jaime Barría, Miguel Cienfuegos, Randall Delgado, Paolo Espino, Steven Fuentes, James González, Severino González, Javy Guerra, Alberto Guerrero, Matt Hardy, Justin Lawrence, Carlos Luna, Humberto Mejía, Andy Otero, Wilfredo Pereira, Davis Romero\n\nCatchers: Erasmo Caballero, Iván Herrera\n\nInfielders: Jonathan Araúz, Christian Bethancourt, José Caballero, Gerald Chin, Allen Córdoba, Edgar Muñoz, Rubén Tejada, Joshwan Wright\n\nOutfielders: Luis Castillo, L.J. Jones, Rodrigo Orozco, José Ramos, Jahdiel Santamaría, Jhonny Santos\n\nPool B (Tokyo)\n\nJapan – Team Samurai Japan WBC roster 2023\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (semi-finals, bronze medallist)\n\nBest WBC performance: Champions (2006, 2009)\n\nCurrent MLB players on roster: Ohtani Shohei (Los Angeles Angels), Darvish Yu (San Diego Padres), Suzuki Seiya (Chicago Cubs), Lars Nootbar (St Louis Cardinals), Yoshida Masataka (Boston Red Sox)\n\nAs usual, Pool B host Japan is one of the strongest teams at the WBC – and the only team to have won the title twice. In addition to five Major Leaguers on its 2023 roster, the remainder of the Japanese team plays in its domestic Nippon Professional Baseball League, and includes players considered to have bright MLB future potential too. Notably, the 'Samurai Japan' includes an American-born player for the first time in Lars Nootbaar, whose mother is Japanese.\n\nOhtani Shohei: Countdown to the 2023 World Baseball Classic – latest updates on Japan and Angels superstar\n\nManager: Kuriyama Hideki\n\nTwo-way player: Ohtani Shohei\n\nPitchers: Darvish Yu, Kuribayashi Ryoji, Imanaga Shota, Itoh Hiromi, Matsui Yuki, Miyagi Hiroya, Ota Taisei, Sasaki Roki, Takahashi Hiroto, Takahashi Keiji, Togo Shosei, Udagawa Yuki, Yamamoto Yoshinobu, Yuasa Atsuki\n\nCatchers: Kai Takuya, Nakamura Yuhei, Ohshiro Takumi\n\nInfielders: Genda Sosuke, Maki Shugo, Murakami Munetaka, Nakano Takumu, Okamoto Kazuma, Shuto Ukyo, Suzuki Seiya, Yamada Tetsuto, Yamakawa Hotaka\n\nOutfielders: Ondo Kensuke, Lars Nootbaar (aka Enokida Tatsuji in Japanese), Yoshida Masataka\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 10th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: Silver medallist (2009)\n\nCurrent MLB players on roster: Tommy Edman (St Louis Cardinals), Kim Ha-seong (San Diego Padres)\n\nThere is more history being made here, as for the first time in a WBC, South Korea has also joined Japan in naming an American-born player with heritage to its roster. Nootbar's MLB teammate Tommy Edman, whose mother is of Korean descent, is one of two Major Leaguers on the South Korean team. As with Japan, South Korea's strong domestic baseball scene means every other player on the roster plays in the KBO League.\n\nManager: Lee Kang-chul\n\nPitchers: Go woo-suk, Gwak Been, Jeong Cheol-won, Jung Woo-young, Kim Kwang-hyun, Kim Won-jung, Kim Yun-sik, Ko Young-pyo, Koo Chang-mo, Lee Eui-lee, Lee Yong-chan, Park Se-woong, So Hyeong-jun, Won Tae-in, Yang Hyeon-jong\n\nCatchers: Lee Ji-young, Yang Eui-ji\n\nInfielders: Choi Jeong, Tommy Edman, Kang Baek-ho, Kim Ha-seong, Kim Hye-seong, Oh Ji-hwan, Park Byung-ho\n\nOutfielders: Choi Ji-hoon, Kim Hyun-soo, Lee Jung-hoo, Na Sung-bum, Park Hae-min, Park Kun-woo\n\nAustralia\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 9th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: First round, 9th place (2017)\n\nCurrent MLB players on roster: Aaron Whitefield (Los Angeles Angels)\n\nThe Australian roster includes the oldest player participating in the 2023 WBC, 45-year-old pitcher Chris Oxspring. However, Aussie baseball's biggest current star, Liam Hendriks of the Chicago White Sox, was ruled out indefinitely over the winter after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer.\n\nManager: David Nilsson\n\nPitchers: Tim Atherton, Matt Beattie, Liam Doolan, Kyle Glogoski, Josh Guyer, Sam Holland, Jon Kennedy, Tim Kennelly, Steve Kent, Daniel McGrath, Mitch Neunborn, Jack O'Loughlin, Chris Oxspring, Warwick Saupold, Will Sherriff, Josh Tols, Blake Townsend, Todd van Steensel, Luke Wilkins, Coen Wynne\n\nCatchers: Ryan Battaglia, Alex Hall, Jordan McArdle, Robbie Perkins\n\nInfielders: Jake Bowey, Jarryd Dale, Darryl George, Robbie Glendinning, Liam Spence, Logan Wade, Rixon Wingrove\n\nOutfielders: Ulrich Bojarski, Andrew Campbell, Aaron Whitefield\n\nPeople's Republic of China\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 16th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: First round, 11th place (2009)\n\nNo MLB players (or players with MLB experience) on 2023 roster\n\nWhile the Chinese team does not include any MLB players, there are three foreign-based players in the side: Angels minor leaguer Alan Zhang Carter, KBO League pitcher Ju Kwon (Zhu Quan), and the Japanese-born former NPB outfielder Masago Yusuke.\n\nManager: Dean Treanor\n\nPitchers: Alan Carter, Gong Hai-cheng, Ju Kwon (aka Zhu Quan), Lin Qiang, Qi Xin, Su Changlong, Sun Hailong, Wang Weiyi, Wang Xiang, Wang Yuchen, Yi Jian, Zhang Hao, Zhao Fuyang, Zheng Chaoqun\n\nCatchers: Chen Chen (not to be confused with the infielder), Li Ning, Li Yifan, Lu Yun\n\nInfielders: Cao Jie, Ray Chang, Chen Chen (not to be confused with the catcher), Luan Chenchen, Kou Yongkang, Yang Jin\n\nOutfielders: Han Xiao, Liang Pei, Liang Rongji, Luo Jinjun, Lyu Yuheng, Masago Yusuke\n\nCzechia (Czech Republic)\n\nDebut WBC appearance\n\n2023 WBC Qualifier performance: Runner-up in Qualifier 1, 3–1 record\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Eric Sogard (free agent)\n\nThe Czech team will make its WBC debut this year after clinching a surprise second place in the first WBC Qualifier back in September, beating hosts Germany and former WBC participants Spain along the way. Nine-year MLB veteran Eric Sogard – whose mother is Czech – is the only player on the team with Major League experience.\n\nManager: Pavel Chadim\n\nPitchers: Jeff Barto, Filip Čapka, Tomáš Duffek, Lukáš Ercoli, Lukáš Hlouch, Michal Kovala, David Mergans, Marek Minařík, Jan Novák, Daniel Padyšák, Ondřej Satoria, Martin Schneider, Jan Tomek, Boris Večerka, Marek Krejčiřík, Jake Rabinowitz\n\nCatchers: Martin Červenka, Daniel Vavruša\n\nInfielders: Willie Escala, Jakub Hajtmar, Jakub Kubica, Vojtěch Menšík, Milan Prokop, Filip Smola, Eric Sogard, Petr Zýma\n\nOutfielders: Marek Chlup, Arnošt Dubový, Jakub Grepl, Marek Krejcirik, Matěj Menšík, Martin Mužík\n\nPool C (Phoenix)\n\nUnited States of America – Team USA WBC roster 2023\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (Defending champions)\n\nBest WBC performance: Champions (2017)\n\nEvery player on the Team USA roster in 2023 plays in the Major Leagues, the only team for which this is the case. (The Dominican Republic roster in Pool D also only features MLB players, but includes two current free agents.)\n\nSuperstar Mike Trout captains Team USA, which can also count on one of the game's legendary hitters Ken Griffey Jr on the coaching staff. Team USA is the defending champion team, having won the title in 2017. Aside from Trout, major names on the roster include three-time National League Cy Young Award (best pitcher award) winner Clayton Kershaw, reigning National League Most Valuable Player award winner Paul Goldschmidt, and 2018 American League MVP Mookie Betts.\n\nManager: Mark DeRosa\n\nPitchers: Jason Adam, Daniel Bard, David Bednar, Kyle Freeland, Kendall Graveman, Merrill Kelly, Clayton Kershaw, Lance Lynn, Miles Mikolas, Adam Ottavino, Ryan Pressly, Brooks Raley, Brady Singer, Adam Wainwright, Devin Williams\n\nCatchers: Kyle Higashioka, J.T. Realmuto, Will Smith\n\nInfielders: Pete Alonso, Tim Anderson, Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt, Trea Turner, Bobby Witt Jr\n\nOutfielders: Mookie Betts, Jeff McNeil, Cedric Mullins, Kyle Schwarber, Mike Trout, Kyle Tucker\n\nMexico\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 13th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: Second round, 6th place (2006)\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Giovanny Gallegos (St Louis Cardinals), Patrick Sandoval (Los Angeles Angels), Julio Urías (Los Angeles Dodgers), José Urquidy (Houston Astros), Taijuan Walker (Philadelphia Phillies), Alejandro Kirk (Toronto Blue Jays), Randy Arozarena (Tampa Bay Rays), Alex Verdugo (Boston Red Sox)\n\nTeam Mexico will look to make it to the semis for the first time in their WBC history with a team comprised of mostly U.S.-based players. The squad is a mixture of Mexican League (and MLB) players and American MLB players of Mexican descent, as well as 2021 American League Rookie of the Year award winner Randy Arozarena, who was born in Cuba but is a naturalised Mexican citizen.\n\nManager: Benji Gil\n\nPitchers: Erubiel Armenta, Javier Assad, Manny Barreda, Victor Castaneda, Luis Cessa, Jesús Cruz, Giovanny Gallegos, Felipe González, Adrián Martínez, Óliver Pérez, Roel Ramírez, Alan Rangel, Gerardo Reyes, Wilmer Rios, JoJo Romero, Jake Sánchez, Patrick Sandoval, Julio Urías, José Urquidy, César Vargas, Taijuan Walker, Samuel Zazueta\n\nCatchers: Austin Barnes, Alejandro Kirk\n\nInfielders: Jonathan Aranda, Joey Meneses, Isaac Paredes, Rowdy Tellez, Alan Trejo, Luis Urías, Roberto Valenzuela\n\nOutfielders: Randy Arozarena, José Cardona, Jarren Duran, Alek Thomas, Alex Verdugo\n\nColombia\n\nSecond WBC appearance (team missed 2006, 2009, 2013)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 11th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: First round, 11th place (2017)\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Nabil Crismatt (San Diego Padres), José Quintana (New York Mets), Gio Urshela (Los Angeles Angels), Harold Ramírez (Tampa Bay Rays)\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Colombia only made its WBC debut in 2017, making this the team's second outing at a WBC tournament. Former Major Leaguer Jolbert Cabrera is the team's manager this year, and among his coaches are World Series champions Orlando Cabrera and Édgar Rentería.\n\nManager: Jolbert Cabrera\n\nPitchers: Elkin Alcalá, Adrián Almeida, Danis Correa, Nabil Crismatt, William Cuevas, Luis De Ávila, Luis Escobar, Santiago Flórez, Rubén Galindo, Pedro García, Río Gómez, Yapson Gómez, Tayron Guerrero, Jasier Herrera, Jeffry Niño, Carlos Ocampo, José Quintana, Jhon Romero, Reiver Sanmartín, Julio Teherán, José Torres, Ezequiel Zabaleta, Guillermo Zúñiga\n\nCatchers: Jorge Alfaro, Gustavo Campero, Elías Díaz, Meibrys Viloria\n\nInfielders: Jordan Díaz, Dayán Frías, Evan Mendoza, Fabián Pertuz, Adrián Sánchez, Donovan Solano, Giovanny Urshela\n\nOutfielders: Oscar Mercado, Tito Polo, Harold Ramírez\n\nCanada\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (first round, 15th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: First round, 9th place (2006)\n\nNotable MLB players on roster: Nick Pivetta (Boston Red Sox), Cal Quantrill, Bo Naylor (both Cleveland Guardians), Freddie Freeman (Los Angeles Dodgers), Abraham Toro (Milwaukee Brewers), Tyler O'Neill (St Louis Cardinals)\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Canada has never made it past the first round at a WBC. Its 2023 ballclub is once more made up of a mixture of current and former Major Leaguers as well as a clutch of Minor League players, and is led by 2020 National League MVP Freddie Freeman.\n\nManager: Ernie Whitt\n\nPitchers: Andrew Albers, Philippe Aumont, John Axford, Matt Brash, Mitch Bratt, Trevor Brigden, Indigo Diaz, R.J. Freure, Adam Loewen, Scott Mathieson, Nick Pivetta, Cal Quantrill, Evan Rutckyj, Noah Skirrow, Cade Smith, Curtis Taylor, Rob Zastryzny\n\nCatchers: Kellin Deglan, Bo Naylor, Andy Yerzy\n\nInfielders: Freddie Freeman, Edouard Julien, Otto López, Damiano Palmegiani, Abraham Toro, Jared Young\n\nOutfielders: Owen Caissie, Denzel Clarke, Tyler O'Neill, Jacob Robson\n\nGreat Britain\n\nDebut WBC appearance\n\n2023 WBC Qualifier performance: Winner of Qualifier 1, 3–0 record\n\nCurrent MLB players on roster: Ian Gibaut (Cincinnati Reds), Trayce Thompson (Los Angeles Dodgers)\n\nTeam GB will make their WBC debut in 2023 after winning their qualifying tournament in September. Their team is formed by a backbone of mostly American- and Bahamian-born players of British descent, and includes MLB.com's 49th-ranked prospect in all of the Minor Leagues, Harry Ford. Also on the team is Trayce Thompson, the Dodgers outfielder who is the younger brother of 2016 basketball Olympic champion Klay. However, the team's biggest star Jazz Chisholm – recently named cover athlete of the MLB The Show video game for 2023 – misses out as he is working his way back from an injury.\n\nManager: Drew Spencer\n\nPitchers: Donovan Benoit, Malik Binns, Richard Brereton, Daniel Cooper, Jake Esch, Chavez Fernander, Ian Gibaut, Gunnar Groen, Joseph King, Ryan Long, McKenzie Mills, Akeel Morris, Branden Noriega, Cam Opp, Michael Petersen, Chris Reed, Michael Roth, Andre Scrubb, Jack Seppings, Matteo Sollecito, Graham Spraker, Tahnaj Thomas, Tyler Viza, Alex Webb, Vance Worley\n\nCatchers: Ural Forbes, Harry Ford\n\nInfielders: Lucius Fox, B.J. Murray, Nick Ward, Justin Wylie\n\nOutfielders: Alex Crosby, D'Shawn Knowles, Matt Koperniak, Andernee Seymour, Darnell Sweeney, Trayce Thompson, Chavez Young\n\nPool D (Miami)\n\nThis year's Pool D group is considered the toughest among the four first-round pools, with three teams – Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic – selecting nearly all their players from the MLB, and only two spots on offer in the quarter-finals.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (silver medallist)\n\nBest WBC performance: Silver medallist (2013, 2017)\n\nMost of the Puerto Rican roster has MLB experience, with the exception of a few prospects. Much of the lineup are everyday starters in the MLB.\n\nLosing finalists at the last two tournaments, Team PR looks to finally go one better and clinch the championship in 2023. This year, they are managed by legendary catcher Yadier Molina, who has just retired after a 19-year MLB career. However, the team's star power was reduced by the withdrawal of Carlos Correa for family (parental) reasons. Notably, Marcus Stroman – who represented and won the championship with Team USA in 2017 – has switched to Puerto Rico.\n\nManager: Yadier Molina\n\nPitchers: Jordan Bermudez, José Berríos, Alex Claudio, Fernando Cruz, José De León, Alexis Díaz, Edwin Díaz (not to be confused with the infielder), José Espada, Dominic Hamel, Jorge López, Anthony Maldonado, Jovani Morán, Nicholas Padilla, Emilio Pagán, Luis Queñones, Yacksel Ríos, Dereck Rodríguez, Héctor Santiago, Marcus Stroman, Duane Underwood Jr\n\nCatchers: Martín Maldonado, MJ Melendez, Christian Vázquez\n\nInfielders: Javier Báez, Edwin Díaz (not to be confused with the pitcher), Enrique Hernández, Francisco Lindor, Vimael Machín, José Miranda, Emmanuel Rivera, Neftalí Soto\n\nOutfielders: Henry Ramos, Eddie Rosario, Nelson Velázquez\n\nVenezuela\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (Second round, 8th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: Semi-finals, bronze medallist (2009)\n\nMost of the Venezuelan roster has MLB experience. Much of the lineup are everyday starters in the MLB.\n\nThe 2017 American League MVP José Altuve, 2018 National League Rookie of the Year award winner Ronald Acuña Jr and 2015 World Series MVP Salvador Pérez are among the stand-out names on Team Venezuela this year, although nearly the entire team plays or has played in the MLB. The newest member of MLB's 3,000-hit club and likely future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera is also on the team.\n\nManager: Omar López\n\nPitchers: José Alvarado, Silvino Bracho, Endrys Briceño, Max Castillo, Jhoulys Chacín, Enmanuel De Jesús, Edwin Escobar, Luis García, Norwith Gudiño, Carlos Hernández, Darwinzon Hernández, Elieser Herneandez, Pablo López, Jesús Luzardo, Jhonathan Díaz, Andrés Machado, Germán Márquez, Martín Pérez, José Quijada, Eduwardo Rodríguez, José Ruiz, Ranger Suárez, Anthony Vizcaya\n\nCatchers: Robinson Chirinos, Omar Narváez, Salvador Pérez\n\nInfielders: José Altuve, Luis Arráez, Eduardo Escobar, Andrés Giménez, Luis Rengifo, Miguel Rojas, Eugenio Suárez, Gleyber Torres\n\nOutfielders: Ronald Acuña Jr, David Peralta, Anthony Santander\n\nDesignated Hitter: Miguel Cabrera\n\nDominican Republic\n\nFifth WBC appearance (team has participated in every edition)\n\nLast WBC appearance: 2017 (Second round, 5th place)\n\nBest WBC performance: Champions (2013)\n\nThe entire Dominican Republic roster, with the exception of two free agents (Gary Sánchez and Robinson Canó), currently plays in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe third of the three heavyweights in Pool D is the DR team, which can count a wealth of MLB riches to call on including the current National League Cy Young Award winner Sandy Alcántara, reigning American League Rookie of the Year Julio Rodríguez (who was also part of the DR's bronze-medal team at the Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020 in 2021), and multiple All-Stars including Rafael Devers, Manny Machado, and Juan Soto.
