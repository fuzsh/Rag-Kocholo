        "text": "Barbarroja Chad Billingsley\n\nJaime Jarrin has nicknamed Chad Billingsley Barbarroja because his beard is coming out red. Jaime said during one of his transmission that he told Billingsley that he calls him that. Billz said he likes it.\n\nThere is a Barbarroja beer in Argentina.\n\nBillingsley record with the beard is is 5-0 in his last five games with a 1.56 ERA\n\nEl Cochito Luis Cruz\n\nJaime Jarrin and Pepe Yniguez report that El Cochito Cruz talks to his dad every day about how he is doing. His dad watches him on the internet. He tells him “you did this right, you should open this way, you did this wrong. Cochito cruz Sr. used to play in the Mexican League. As I edit this Cochito Cruz just hit a homerun!\n\nThe Nickname: Cochito\n\nThe nickname “Cochito” refers to “el Cochinito” which means a little pig. Luis Cruz Sr. was known by that last name so his son inherited the nickname.\n\nBack to Back to Back Homeruns\n\nCongratulatios to the guys that hit the back to back to back Hanley Ramirez, Loney and CochitoCruz. If someone had told you that there were four homeruns in the Dodger game you would have figured that Kemp and Ethier were included in there but no. There were four hits in the game and all four were homeruns.\n\nThe Baseball Reliquary and “Not Exactly Cooperstown”\n\nWatching the game and later I am heading to the the Pasadena Library for the screening of “Not Exactly Cooperstown” Tom Hoffarth has a Q&A with the filmmaker Jon Leonoudakis hhttp://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_21347428/sunday-q-tom-hoffarth-filmmaker-happy-reliquary-is\n\nJon is a Giant fan but I don’t hold that against him but I want to see what he has to say about Melky. Oh yeah, fans are encouraged to show up dressed in their baseball gear. I think I will dress as Hilda Chester. Still looking for my bag that says “Hilda is Here!”\n\nGet away game for the Dodgers with the Braves then home to play three with the Giants. Go Dodgers!\n\nHow sweet it is to sweep the Giants!\n\nI was at a memorial for a friend and co-worker that passed away after a long battle with cancer. We honored her by getting together at one of her favorite places to get a bite to eat and a margarita. A large group of us had a nice brunch there. I checked the MLB At Bat twice and I smiled. The rest of the game I heard it on my way home.\n\nKershaw blanked out the Giants 4-0!\n\nPer Dodger Historian Mark Langill, Last time Dodgers had consecutive road shutouts vs. Giants was 1957 at New York Polo Grounds by Brooklyn’s Don Drysdale (7/1) and Sal Maglie (7/2).\n\nWish I had that coy of the 1957 year book.\n\nI See you Luis “Cochito” Cruz! Congratulations on extending your hitting streak to 12. Felicidades!\n\nSweet Sweep so the broom is back!\n\nDodgers return to Dodger Stadium tied with the Giants for first place!\n\nAlso very happy because in soccer, Honduras defeating Spain in the Olympics! What an upset! I was not expecting this!\n\nHonduras now will face Japan.\n\nCheers to my friend Ms M, a courageous woman with lots of friends. Cheers to the Dodgers for the sweep and cheers for Honduras for the upset win against Spain."
