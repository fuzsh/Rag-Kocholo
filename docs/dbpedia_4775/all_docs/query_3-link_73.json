        "text": "Not only does Luis Cruz’s choices substantially affect Paul’s development in Tangerine, but he impacts Paul’s personality and choices too. To explain, one of the countless choices Luis chooses is to talk to Erik about punching his younger brother: “Erik and his group had gathered up their gear and were preparing to leave. Luis stood in their path, like the brave sheriff of a town full of cowards” (Bloor 211). When Luis decides to stand up to Erik, Paul is influenced to be undaunted by his elder brother. Continuing, Luis also improves Paul’s life by showing him his family’s tangerine nursery: “He said, ‘Look around you. This is a nursery’” (Bloor 164). As Paul journeys through the nursery, he becomes passionate about the trees and loves the\n\nOne decision that caused Paul to be less afraid of Erik is on pages 262-263. On these pages the author says, “He turned and threw the bat into the Land Cruiser. He got in, and Arthur got in, and they drove quickly away.” (Pg 262-263) This makes Paul less afraid of him because he was able to stand up to Erik and Arthur alone without getting hurt by either one of them. This also caused Paul not to be afraid of Erik because it proved to Paul that Erik wasn't so perfect and put together as he thought. Another reason why Paul is not afraid of Erik at the end of the book is on page 284. On page 284 the author states that, “I stood up straight and faced them all, like I had seen Luis do. “I saw- I heard Erik Fisher tell him to do it.”” (Pg. 284) This shows that Paul is less afraid of Erik because he was willing to expose Erik in front of everyone, and tell the complete truth without being afraid that Erik would hurt him in anyway. Erik Fisher causes Paul Fisher to be less afraid of him by losing control and not denying the truth about the bad things he had\n\nHe said to his parents, “let me ask you one thing, mom. When you got home from the hospital that day did you see the white paint on Eric’s hands?” Then she said yes, and he got told that they did know the reason of being blind was from the paint that Eric had sprayed into his eyes. Paul was furious and he will now forever pay for what Eric has done to him. Paul then developed and had the courage to tell everyone that Eric was the one to kill Luis and steal all of the things from the houses.\n\nTo begin with, Bloor uses flashback to convey the theme of growth by giving the reader a look into Paul’s past, and then letting them regard the contrast between Paul before and Paul near the end of the book. For instance, on page 168, Paul describes his flashback, “ Suddenly I felt the hot breath of a predator on my neck. I screamed in terror. Erik laughed and ran over to Mom and Dad. He had snuck up on me from behind, from somewhere back around ten o’clock.” On page 261, Paul describes his encounter with his brother and Arthur, “ I understood that I was supposed to be terrified by this spectacle - these two demonic creatures on this dark, lonely road. But for once in my life, I wasn’t.” After what Erik and Castor did to Paul’s eyes, he was permanently scarred and terrified of his brother. During Paul’s time in Tangerine, he learns from his friends that he has brothers to back him up, and on page 229, Paul’s conversation with Luis, ““I’m just telling you this so you’ll know. You seem kinda scared of Erik and Arthur Bauer.” “Yeah. I am. Who wouldn’t be?” Luis answered simply, “I wouldn’t be. They’re punks.” He pointed one ropelike finger at me. “And you shouldn’t be, either.”” tells Paul that Erik and Arthur are only\n\n“I saw you face down Erik and those other guys, and I also saw Arthur Bauer Hit you with a blackjack’’, Page 227. Erik and Arthur had had chosen to hit Luis because Luis was getting back at them for hitting his brother , a 7th Grader and then Arthur him back. This Affected Paul by Luis later dying of a blood clot to his head and Paul was deeply sad and later found out that Erik and Arthur are\n\nAs a result of this Paul feels secondary to Eric because Eric gets more attention from Mom and Dad. In page 289 it said,”When we moved to Houston, when Erik was eleven, he realized football was the star attraction.” From this evidence, we see that Paul feels less important to his family. Additionally, we can see that Paul is being ignored, almost to the point where he is abandoned. This helps Paul build his character because he tumbles down, losing more than his\n\nOne of the cruelest things Erik did in the book was damage Paul’s eyesight. Because of what Erik did, it ruined Paul’s child/teen hood. He couldn’t play on the Lake Windsor soccer team, he got called mean names, and he was seen as “handicapped” by people including his mom. This just shows how much of a sick person Erik is. Erik may be cruel, but Paul is very compassionate. He enjoys helping people. In the story, Paul helped Luis Cruz with his tangerine business. Even though Paul didn’t have to, he chose to fight the freeze and try to save the tangerines with Luis and his family. Paul may have gotten sick and had problems during the freeze, but he fought through it to be with his friends. Based on that, you know that Paul is a true\n\nAfterward, Paul reveals to the police that Erik and Arthur were involved in the death of Luis Cruz. On page 211 of Tangerine it states, “Arthur reached Luis, turned, and whipped the blackjack around with a loud whack against the side of Luis’s head.” Paul’s close friend Luis was smacked across the head with a blackjack by Erik and this caused Luis to have an aneurysm. Luis was smacked on the head because Erik had hit Tino, Luis’ brother in the face with a blackjack, so Luis got involved, and confronted Erik and Arthur. Paul is devastated because the aneurysm sadly caused Luis’ death. Luis was very helpful to Paul and seeing him dead made Paul despondent. Also pages 244-245 states, “Luis Cruz is dead...I raised my hand and got Ms. Polland’s attention. I said, “I gotta go. I’m sick again.” Luis’ death made Paul sick to his stomach because first, they were close friends because he was kind of like an older brother to Paul. Also, Paul knows that Arthur and Erik are involved in the\n\nAfter a fight Paul takes part in at Lake Windsor High, he runs to his neighborhood. Unfortunately, he is cornered by Erik and Arthur, who attempt to intimidate him. Paul narrates, “I understood that I was supposed to be terrified by this spectacle… But for once in my life, I wasn't. I stepped forward and faced them, just as I had seen Luis do… ‘I'm not afraid of you, Erik. Come on’” (Bloor 260-261). Since Erik chooses to confront Paul, Paul finally does not run away or get worried about what the outcome would be if he talked back to Erik and finds the courage to fight him off. He realizes that his opponent is just a punk trying to ruin his life, and drag him into his careless problems. Furthermore, as Paul faces Erik, he recognizes his same procedure full of pitiful remarks and, \"When they finally spoke, it wasn't terrifying, it was lame… Erik stared at me with growing fury, with growing hatred, moving the bat in a tight circle” (Bloor 261, 252). Erik conveys his choice to frighten Paul, making Paul see that Erik was not as terrifying as Paul made him up to be. Paul perceives how terrifying Erik’s true self actually is, as a result of Erik’s choice to confront"
