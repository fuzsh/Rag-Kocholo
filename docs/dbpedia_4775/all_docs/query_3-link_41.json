        "meta_description": "George Adams Gallery is a contemporary art gallery in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York, founded in 1952.\r\n\r\nFrom its inception, the gallery has introduced and promoted a diverse range of artists, most notably from the San Francisco Bay Area and Latin America, while mounting regular exhibitions of 20th Century European master drawings by such artists as Max Beckmann, Lovis Corinth, James Ensor, Alberto Giacometti, and Henri Matisse, among others. The rich history of the gallery includes the careers of artists such as Jeremy Anderson, Robert Barnes, William Beckman, Mel Chin, Robert Colescott, Joseph Cornell, Manny Farber, Paul Georges, Paul Granlund, Theodore Halkin, Robert Hudson, June Leaf, Arthur Liepzig, Maryan, James McGarrell, Willard Midgette, Philip Pearlstein, James Surls, James Valerio, and Sandy Winters. Beginning with Roberto Matta in the 1950s, the gallery played an important role in introducing contemporary Latin American art to American audiences. Subsequently the gallery gave first solo exhibitions in the United States for artists Luis Cruz Azaceta (1979), Jose Bedia (1991), Rosana Palazyan (1998), and Yoan Capote (2004), as well as exhibitions of works by Carlos Alfonzo, Luis Benedit, Juan Francisco Elso, and Arnaldo Roche-Rabell.\r\n\r\nToday, the George Adams Gallery represents the estates of Robert Arneson (1930-1992), Jack Beal (1931-2013), Elmer Bischoff (1916-1991), Joan Brown (1938-1990) and Gregory Gillespie (1936-2000), while regularly exhibiting the work of contemporary artists such as Luis Cruz Azaceta, Chris Ballantyne, Enrique Chagoya, Diane Edison, Amer Kobaslija, Andrew Lenaghan, Tony May, Peter Saul, Katherine Sherwood, William T. Wiley, and other emerging and under-recognized artists. With its long association with art from the San Francisco Bay Area, the gallery’s program continues to champion art from the region through research and historical exhibitions of work by artists both from its roster and beyond.",

        "text": "Luis Cruz Azaceta is included in the group exhibition Radical Conventions at the Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami, FL.\n\nThis exhibition presents a selection of Cuban American artists, whose works from the 1980s in particular move beyond the context of exile and displacement, considering cultural and personal influences such as sexuality, gender, religion, class, and political positioning. Included in the exhibition is Azaceta’s 1981 City Painter of Hearts, an amalgamation of the artist’s personal and social ideals. In the painting, the city’s skyline - a biomorphic, living thing - is set ablaze and overrun with turmoil. In the lower right corner, the artist continues to paint despite the violence around him.\n\nAbout the painting, curator Susana Torruella Leval explained that “like Picasso’s periodic recapitulations, [it] sums up Azaceta’s previous years’ work… In front of the impeccably neutral foreground, a dog chases a cat who chases a mouse who chases a bone. Meanwhile, the master of transformations paints at his easel, oblivious to the apocalyptic bloody debris around him; coyly hiding his sex, he paints a perfect red heart onto a miniature blue canvas. He understands his role; painting reveals a caring heart.”\n\nSee this work in Radical Conventions: Cuban American Art from the 1980s at the Lowe Art Museum through June 12, 2022."
