        "text": "The 2024 fantasy baseball season's trade deadline is finally behind us and all of the rosters are pretty much set for the rest of the way. The action continues to come in fast and furious on a daily basis. Listed below are my rankings for the remainder of the 2024 season, designed specifically with ESPN roto-style leagues in mind. These should help you evaluate moves in rotisserie leagues from now until the end of the 2024 season.\n\nNote: Although Shohei Ohtani will retain SP eligibility for the upcoming season, reports state that, following September elbow surgery, he is not likely to pitch in 2024. As a result, we have decided not to include him in our SP ranks. He continues to be ranked as a DH. If he does pitch again in 2025 (even after potentially not doing so in 2024), we will allow him to retain his SP eligibility.\n\nLooking for points league rankings?
