        "text": "Milestones\n\n- Ramiro Enrique has scored in five consecutive matches in all competitions for Orlando City. If Enrique scores on Sunday against AtlÃ©tico San Luis, he will become the first player in the history of the club to score a goal in six straight games.\n\n- MartÃ­n Ojeda has a chance to extend his current club record streak of seven games in a row with a goal contribution against San Luis, as well.\n\n- Facundo Torresâ next start will be his 100th for Orlando City. El Cuervoâs next goal will be his 40th for the club, making him the second player to reach the 40-goal mark after Cyle Larin. With 23 assists, Torres is one behind Chris Mueller for third in club history and three back of Nani for second.\n\n- NicolÃ¡s Lodeiroâs next assist will tie the clubâs single season record of 12, set by Torres in 2022 and Mauricio Pereyra in 2023.\n\nStats & Storylines\n\n- Orlando City went right back to piling up goals in Fridayâs Leagues Cup opener against CF MontrÃ©al, going 3-0 up at halftime and ending up with a 4-1 victory. The Lions have scored 14 goals in their past four home games and 24 goals in their past eight matches overall.\n\n- City has scored at least four goals in three of their past four home games, winning all three. The Lions are unbeaten in four at home for the first time since 2023.\n\n- Orlando City only needs to avoid defeat of five goals or more in order to advance to the knockout rounds of Leagues Cup. The Lions will win the group with any result, and thanks to their +3 goal differential following the MontrÃ©al game, even with a one-goal loss against AtlÃ©tico San Luis will see Orlando top the table.\n\n- MartÃ­n Ojeda has three goals and four assists over his past seven games, all starts, leading Orlando City to a 5-1-1 record in that span. Orlando City has won ten of Ojedaâs 19 starts in all competitions this season while winning just twice in the 11 games in which he was not in the XI.\n\n- Facundo Torres has seven goals and five assists in nine games since June 19, contributing to nearly half (12/26) of the clubâs overall goal tally in that span. Torres has multiple goal contributions in five of his past nine appearances.\n\n- Duncan McGuire and the United States Olympic team were eliminated in the quarterfinals on Friday morning, falling 4-0 to Morocco. McGuire will travel back to the United States to rejoin Orlando City.\n\nMeet the opponent: AtlÃ©tico San Luis\n\n- Orlando City faces a team from Liga MX not named Tigres or Santos Laguna for the first time this weekend, welcoming in AtlÃ©tico San Luis from San Luis PotosÃ­ in central Mexico. The Lions have played six games against Liga MX teams, four against Tigres (0-1-3) and two against Santos Laguna (1-1-0).\n\n- AtlÃ©tico San Luis is a relatively new club, founded in May 2013 by San Luis PotosÃ­ businessman Jacobo PayÃ¡n. The club played a few nondescript seasons in the second â and did not even field a team in 2016-17 â before Spanish giants AtlÃ©tico Madrid acquired a 50% stake in the club in spring 2017 to boost the clubâs fortunes. San Luis swiftly advanced up the standings and gained promotion to Liga MX in May 2019, just before promotion and relegation in Mexican soccer was suspended indefinitely.\n\n- San Luisâ best Liga MX season came in the 2023 Apertura, when the team finished in seventh place and advanced to the semifinals of the liguilla, the Mexican leagueâs playoffs. AtlÃ©tico beat Club LÃ©on in the play-in round and took out second-seeded Monterrey in the quarterfinals before falling to eventual champions Club AmÃ©rica in the semis.\n\n- The 2024 Clausura this past spring was less kind to San Luis, as it finished in 13th place and did not qualify for the postseason.\n\n- San Luis is off to a decent start to the 2024 Apertura, sitting at 1-1-2 through four games with a big win over Club AmÃ©rica under its belt. Former Portland Timbers forward Franck Boli has two goals in four games to begin the year after contributing 4 G/2 A in 12 appearances during the 2024 Clausura."
