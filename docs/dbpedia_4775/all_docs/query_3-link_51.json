        "text": "By Deborah George\n\nAs this remarkable school year comes to a close, the RamPage thought it appropriate to interview Luis Cruz, the Valedictorian for the Graduating Class of 2021. Below, Luis discusses his 4 years at MCSM, how he balanced academia with his social life, and gives advice to fellow graduating classmates and underclassmen.\n\nQ: What is your favorite memory of MCSM?\n\nLuis: My favorite MCSM memory would have to be the Frost Valley trip we had for ASR in sophomore year. Spending the weekend with my ASR classmates was a precious experience, and we all grew close like a family.\n\nQ: What was your favorite class/subject?\n\nLuis: My favorite class would definitely have to be AP Bio. Mr. Moshos was an amazing teacher, and I learned so many interesting concepts while having many laughs.\n\nQ: What class was the hardest?\n\nLuis: Calc BC was probably the hardest class I took. I typically didn’t need to study much for previous math classes, but this year I found myself studying calculus for hours on end. The remote setting combined with the fact that I never took Calc AB surely made this subject even more challenging to learn.\n\nQ: What activities/clubs/programs/internships were you involved in?\n\nLuis:\n\nAdvanced Science Research (ASR)\n\nCEYE Lloyd Sherman Scholars\n\nBridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics (BEAM)\n\nJohns Hopkins CTY Scholars\n\nQ: Which college do you plan on attending and what major do you plan on taking?\n\nLuis: I’ll be attending Columbia University, and majoring in biology on the pre-med Track.\n\nQ: What has been the highlight of your time in high school?\n\nLuis: [The] highlight of my high school years has been my progressive growth, and seeing how much I’ve changed physically and mentally since freshman year.\n\nQ: Which year of high school was your favorite?\n\nLuis: My favorite year of high school would have to be junior year. Most of my fondest memories come from classes like AP Bio and APUSH when we still were learning in-person.\n\nQ: In your 4 years of high school, what challenged you the most?\n\nLuis: The most challenging thing in my 4 years of high school was surely college applications. This year was exceptionally difficult because we were all remote, so we couldn’t just go into the school’s college office to seek guidance. Despite some virtual assistance I received from outside programs, I felt like I was on my own.\n\nQ: Who/what has given you the motivation to excel in high school?\n\nLuis: My parents were definitely big motivators of mine, as they held me to high standards, and pushed me to do my best.\n\nQ: How have you changed since freshman year?\n\nLuis: Freshman me wouldn’t be able to recognize who I am now. I definitely changed in terms of physical appearance. Now I feel more confident and mature than I was before. I was severely antisocial in my first two years at MCSM, but meeting new friends and giving ASR presentations has helped me find my inner voice.\n\nQ: How did you balance school life, social life, and extracurricular activities, especially during the pandemic?\n\nLuis: I always prioritized school over everything else, including social life and activities. To be honest, I didn’t have much of a social life outside of school to begin with, so after school I had more time to study or participate in programs. It was only during the pandemic that I began to have a social life as I began to spend more time online with friends. School was still my top priority, but the virtual setting allowed more free time that I used to balance out my schedule.\n\nQ: Due to the pandemic, did you have any worries about the college process/school life?\n\nLuis: I greatly doubted my ability to submit a college application at first, as I felt like I was on my own. Having to write so many essays, and filling out financial information was very overwhelming, especially without anyone to help me out in person. Online classes also worried me, as I was afraid that I wouldn’t learn well enough in a remote environment to get the grades I desired.\n\nQ: How were you able to overcome the obstacles that the pandemic created?\n\nLuis: I dealt with the obstacles of the pandemic by doing what I’ve always done: adapt and overcome. I spent many long nights working on college essays, but I was able to push through and get applications done on my own. Many times when I didn’t get the hang of a lesson or I needed to study for an exam, I looked up YouTube videos and binge-watched various ones until I understood.\n\nQ: Who/what will you miss the most after graduating from MCSM?\n\nLuis: I’ll definitely miss my previous teachers, my ASR family, and the friend groups I hang out with.\n\nQ: Looking back, what advice would you give to your younger self?\n\nLuis: I’d tell myself the following: Stand taller, smile, and don’t be afraid to talk to others.\n\nQ: What are your expectations for next year?\n\nLuis: Next year, I expect to enter Columbia University as a college freshman. I hope to enroll in classes related to my major and participate in a research lab for the first time. I also hope to participate in clubs, programs, and internships related to pre-Med.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?\n\nLuis: In 10 years, I see myself graduating from med school and becoming a medical professional, ready to provide quality care to my community.\n\nQ: Any advice for the Senior Class of 2021?\n\nLuis: You are all equally intelligent and talented in your own ways. So go show off your talents wherever you go, and use them to bring positive change to the world.\n\nQ: Any advice for the underclassmen?"
