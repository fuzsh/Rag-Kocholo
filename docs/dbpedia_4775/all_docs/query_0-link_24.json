        "text": "11/6 UPDATE #2:\n\nRHP Yovanny Cruz, LHP Stephen Gonsalves, RHP Carlos Guzman, RHP Ben Hecht, C-INF P. J. Higgins, LHP Brailyn Marquez, RHP Nick Neidert, OF Yonathan Perlaza, and RHP Samuel Reyes were declared MLB Rule 9 minor league free agents at 5 PM (Eastern) on Monday.\n\nAlso, RHP Nick Burdi (who has Article XX-D rights because he has accrued more than three years of MLB Service Time in jhis career) elected free-agency Monday afternoon after being outrighted, but before he was declared an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA.\n\nAll of the second contract players are signed for 2024.\n\nRHP Eduarniel Nunez was eligible to be a minor league 6YFA post-2023, but he has signed a 2024 minor league successor contract, so he will be eligible for selection in the Rule 5 Draft next month.\n\nIn addition, LHP Jose Aquino, RHP Anthony Mendez, and RHP Gleiber Morales have been released. Aquino was eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft; Mendez and Morales were not.\n\n11/6 UPDATE #1:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of INF Luis Vazquez from AAA Iowa. Otherwise he would have been declared an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA at 5 PM (Eastern) today.\n\nAlso, the Toronto Blue Jays have purchased the contract of minor league LHP Brendon Little (Cubs 2017 1st round draft pick - SCF Manatee-Sarasota) from the Cubs and selected him to their MLB 40-man roster. Like Vazquez, B. Little otherwise would have been declared an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA at 5 PM (Eastern) today.\n\n11/4 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released OF Bryan Altuve, RHP Derek Casey, RHP (ex-OF) Raino Coran, LHP Scott Kobos, RHP Michael McAvene, C Malcom Quintero, RHP Tomy Sanchez, C Jake Washer, and RHP Jarod Wright.\n\nCasey, Kobos, McAvene, Quintero, and Washer were eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft; the other four were not.\n\n10/13 UPDATE:\n\n1B-3B Edwin Rios has elected free-agency.\n\nRios was sent outright to AAA Iowa on July 30th, and as an Article XX-D player (that's any player who has accrued at least three years but less than five years of MLB Service Time and/or has been outrighted previously in his career), Rios had the right to elect free-agency after being outrighted, terminate his contract, and forfeit the balance of his $1M 2023 salary (a player has 48 hours to decide if he is outrighted during Spring Training or during the MLB regular season, otherwise he has 72 hours to decide), or accept the outright assignment, keep the contract in force, continue to get paid, and defer his election of free-agency until a window beginning on the day after the conclusion of the MLB regular season and extending through October 15th (Rios chose to accept the outright assignment, continue to get paid, and defer free agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season).\n\nNote that this is the only type of free-agency that still requires a player to affirmatively elect free-agency. In the case of Article XX-B MLB free-agency, MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA and second contract free-agency, and an MLB non-tender, the player doesn't have to do anything. In those types of free-agency, the player is automatically declared a free-agent. Only Article XX-D requires the player to make a choice.\n\nMost Article XX-D players who accept an outright assignment and defer the election of free agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season will elect free agency ASAP, on the day after the final day of the MLB regular season, but Rios waited until almost the very last day. This might indicate that Rios was hoping to negotiate a 2024 minor league successor contract. However, as an outrighted player, the very least Rios could get paid in 2024 on a minor league successor contract was $800K, because an outrighted player's salary must be at least 80% of what he was paid the previous season. Now that he is a free-agent, there is no such restriction.\n\nBTW, if Rios had not elected free-agency by October 15th, he would have been automatically declared an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA on the 5th day after the final game of the World Series, unless he was selected to an MLB 40-man roster or signed a 2024 minor league successor contract in the meantime.\n\n10/1 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contracts of RHP Tyler Duffey and RHP Shane Greene from AAA Iowa.\n\nUnless the player signs a 2024 MLB contract in the meantime, both Duffey and Greene will be automatically declared MLB Article XX-B free-agents at 9 AM on the day after the final game of the World Series.\n\n9/12 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHP Edwin Uceta.\n\nHe was claimed off waivers from the Mets on August 18th, and then was sent outright to AAA Iowa on 8/26.\n\nHe was eligible to be an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023.\n\n9/10 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHP Seth Roberson.\n\nHe was acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays in the Adrian Sampson / Manuel Rodriguez trade at the 2023 MLB Trade Deadline and was eligible to be an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023.\n\n9/8 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have sent RHP Seth Greene outright to AAA Iowa.\n\nGreene signed an Article XIX-A 45-day waiver prior to having his contract selected and being added to the Cubs MLB 40-man roster on 9/1, so he cannot elect free-agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season.\n\n9/6 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of LHP Luke Little from AAA Iowa.\n\nBecause he was eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft and had his contract selected and was added to an MLB 40-man roster after August 15th, L. Little has Draft-Excluded Player status (cannot be outrighted to the minors anytime after the Rule 5 Draft up until twenty days prior to MLB Opening Day).\n\n9/1 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of RHP Shane Greene from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\n8/30 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released LHRP Richard Bleier.\n\n8/26 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have sent RHRP Edwin Uceta outright to AAA Iowa (so Uceta is now eligible to be an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023 if he does not sign a 2024 minor league successor contract or get added back to the Cubs MLB Reserve List by 5 PM Eastern on the 5th day after the final game of the 2023 World Series).\n\nAlso, the Cubs have released RHRP Danis Correa and RHRP Gregori Montano (Correa was eligible to be an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023 and Montano was eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft).\n\n8/22 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released 2023 second contract LHRP Jack Aldrich (previously released by KC).\n\n8/17 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed LHRP Richard Bleier to a minor league contract and he has been assigned to AAA Iowa.\n\nBleier has two minor league options remaining and he has the right to elect free-agency if outrighted after being added to the 40. However, Bleier also has Article XIX-A rights, so if he is added to the 40, he cannot be sent to the minors (by optional or outright assignment) without his consent.\n\n8/8 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released C-1B Miguel Fabrizio.\n\n8/7 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released C-1B Dom Nunez.\n\n8/1 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have traded minor league RHPs Manuel Rodriguez and Adrian Sampson (plus ISBP space) to the Tampa Bay Rays for minor league RHP Josh Roberson.\n\nSampson is a 2023 outrighted Article XX-D minor league player so he was eligible to file for free-agency beginning on the day after the conclusion of the MLB regular season up through 10/15, and both M. Rodriguez and Roberson are eligible to be a Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023 World Series, unless the player is added to an MLB 40-man roster or signs a 2024 minor league successor contract prior to 5 PM (Eastern) on the 5th day after the final game of the 2023 World Series.\n\n7/31 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have traded minor league LHP DJ Herz and INF Kevin Made to the Washington Nationals for 3B-1B Jeimer Candelario.\n\nBoth Herz and Made are first-time Rule 5 Draft-eligible post-2023.\n\n7/30 UPDATE:\n\n1B-3B Edwin Rios has been sent outright to AAA Iowa. Rios has Article XX-D rights (he accrued more than three years but less than five years of MLB Service Time) so he has the right to elect free-agency after being outrighted. (He has 48 hours to decide whether to accept the outright assignment and defer free-agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season, or decline the outright assignment and elect free-agency immediately, in which case he would forfeit the balance of his 2023 salary).\n\n7/27 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released 1B-C Lizardo Ruiz.\n\n7/24 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed second-contract minor league FA RHP Brayan Diaz to a minor league contract and he has been assigned to DSL Cubs Red.\n\nB. Diaz was originally signed by the Seattle Mariners in 2021, and was released this past January.\n\nIn addition, RHP Adrian Sampson has been sent outright to AAA Iowa. Sampson has Article XX-D rights so he has the right to elect free-agency after being outrighted. (He has 48 hours to decide whether to accept the outright assignment and defer free-agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season, or decline the outright assignment and elect free-agency immediately, in which case he would forfeit the balance of his 2023 salary).\n\nAlso, INF Sergio Alcantara has been released.\n\n7/19 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHRP Elian Almanzar (2019 22nd round - Florence-Darlington Tech) and OF D. J. Artis (2018 7th round - Liberty University).\n\nBoth player would have been eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft. (They were also eligible in 2022).\n\n7/18 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released OF Zach Davis. He was eligible to be a minor league 6YFA post-2023. (He also had been eligible for minor league free-agency post-2022, but he signed a 2023 minor league successor contract prior to hitting free-agency).\n\nOne of the fastest players in the organization since being drafted out of Texas Tech in 2016, Davis learned to switch hit early in his pro career to take better advantage of his plus-plus speed, but he has no power and never was able to master the art of hitting. He also has a well below-average arm in the OF.\n\n7/16 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have purchased the contract of minor league (and ex-Cubs) C-INF P. J. Higgins from the Arizona Diamondbacks, and he has been assigned to AAA Iowa.\n\nAs is typical for these types of transactions, the D'backs were probably paid an amount equivalent to the MLB waiver price ($50,000), even though Higgins was on a minor league reserve list.\n\n7/15 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHRP Rowan Wick.\n\nWick had been sent outright to the minors in March, and as Article XX-D player, he had the right to elect free-agency immediately (in which case his contract would have been immediately terminated and he would have received no termination pay), or accept the outright assignment and defer free-agency until the after the conclusion of the MLB regular season (presuming he had not been added back to MLB 40-man roster in the meantime). He accepted the outright assignment.\n\nAlso, because he was an outrighted player, Wick could not have been traded after the MLB Trade Deadline on 8/1 (same goes for David Bote and Manuel Rodriguez, BTW).\n\n7/6 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released LHP Didier Vargas and RHP (ex-OF) Welington Santana.\n\nVargas was eligible to be a Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023 and W. Santana was signed by the Cubs as a second contract player (previously released by BAL) last month.\n\n7/4 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of RHRP Daniel Palencia from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nAlso, 1B Bryce Ball has been released.\n\nPalencia was acquired from the Oakland A's for LHRP Andrew Chafin and Ball was acquired from the Atlanta Braves for OF Joc Pederson (both in July 2021).\n\n7/1 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released AAA Iowa RHRP Jordan Holloway.\n\nHolloway had a July 1st opt-out in his contract that he elected to exercise after the Cubs failed to add him to their MLB 40-man roster or trade him to a club that would add him to their MLB 40-man roster.\n\n6/27 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of INF-OF Jared Young from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nYoung has three minor league options available, and he can elect free-agency if he is outrighted.\n\n6/26 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA RHRP Shane Greene to a minor league contract.\n\nGreene has been temporarily assigned to the ACL Cubs in Mesa while he gets himself into game shape. However, by rule a player with his service time cannot remain on an ACL roster after June 30th.\n\n6/19 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have re-signed FA RHRP Tyler Duffey to a minor league contract.\n\nDuffey opted out of his previous 2023 minor league contract on 6/1, but he apparently could not find a deal he liked once he got onto the open market. He likely has another opt-out (probably 8/1) in his new contract.\n\nDuffey has been temporarily assigned to the ACL Cubs in Mesa while he gets himself back into game shape. However, by rule a player with his service time cannot remain on an ACL roster after June 30th.\n\nDuffey is out of minor league options should he be added to the MLB 40-man roster at some point in 2023, and he has the right to elect free-agency if outrighted after being added to the 40. However, Duffey has also Article XIX-A rights, so if he is added to the 40, he cannot be sent to the minors without his consent.\n\n6/16 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released INF Yeison Santana. He was one of five players acquired by the Cubs from the San Diego Padres for Yu Darvish in December 2020.\n\n6/13 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of LHRP Anthony Kay from AAA Iowa and he been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nKay has one minor league option available, and he has the right to elect free-agency if he is outrighted.\n\n6/4 UPDATE:\n\nAfter signing two second contract free agents for their DSL squads on Saturday -- RHP (ex-1B) Francis Reynoso and RHP Jeral Vizcaino -- the Cubs signed a third second-contract free-agent on Sunday, RHP (ex-OF) Welington Santana (ex-BAL).\n\nIf he is signed beyond 2023, W. Santana will be eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft (he signed with the Orioles as an 18 year old in 2019).\n\nSo the Cubs now have 65 players assigned to their International Reserve List (five slots are open), plus two players are on the Restricted List and three are on the 60-day IL.\n\n6/3 UPDATE #2:\n\nThe Cubs have signed two second contract minor league free-agents, RHP (ex-1B) 1B Francis Reynoso (ex-STL) and RHP Jeral Vizcaino (ex-MIL), and they will play in the DSL (Reynoso was assigned to DSL Cubs Blue, and Vizcaino was assigned to DSL Cubs Red).\n\nNormally a player cannot play in the DSL once he has played in a U. S. minor league (Reynoso played for the FCL Cardinals last season), but that restriction does not apply to second contract players.\n\nA \"second contract player\" is a player who does not yet qualify to be a MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA but who has been previously released or non-tendered in his career (even if the player re-signs with the same team after being released or non-tendered, and even if he has been released or non-tendered more than once).\n\nA second contract player can be signed for just one year, or (with mutual consent of the player and the club) for as many years as the player has left before he accrues seven seasons of minor league service and becomes eligible to be a Rule 9 minor league 6YFA.\n\nAlso, if he is signed beyond 2023, Reynoso will be eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft (he signed with the Cardinals as a 16 year old in 2019), but if J. Vizcaino is signed beyond 2023, he will not be eligible for selection in the Rule 5 Draft until post-2025 (he was signed by the Brewers as a 19-year old in June 2022).\n\n6/3 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released AAA Iowa RHRP Tyler Duffey.\n\nJust like Vince Nittoli (see 6/2 UPDATE), Duffey had a June 1st opt-out in his contract that he elected to exercise after the Cubs failed to add him to their MLB 40-man roster or trade him to a club that would add him to their MLB 40-man roster.\n\n6/2 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have traded AAA Iowa RHRP Vinny Nittoli to the New York Mets for cash considerations (probably $50,000).\n\nNittoli had an opt-out clause in his contract that required the Cubs to either add him to their MLB 40-man roster by June 1st, trade him to a club that will add him to their 40-man roster immediately, or grant him his unconditional release.\n\n5/23 UPDATE:\n\nRHRP Bradford Deppermann (Cubs 2019 7th round draft pick - U. of North Florida) has retired.\n\n5/19 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of OF Mike Tauchman from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nTauchman is out of minor league options, and he has the right to elect free-agency if he is outrighted to the minors.\n\n5/18 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released catcher Tim Susnara.\n\n5/15 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of RHRP Nick Burdi from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\n5/9 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHP Bailey Reid and INF Josue Huma.\n\n5/5 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of 1B Matt Mervis from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nAlso, catcher Ronnier Quintero has been released.\n\nIn addition, LHP Ryan Borucki (Designated for Assignment on 5/2) has been sent outright to AAA Iowa. Borucki has Article XX-D rights so he has the right to elect free-agency after being outrighted. (He has 48 hours to decide whether to accept the outright assignment and defer free-agency until after the conclusion of the MLB regular season, or decline the outright assignment and elect free-agency immediately, in which case he would forfeit the balance of his 2023 salary).\n\n5/4 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released LHP Roenis Elias so that he can sign with SSG Landers (KBO).\n\n4/30 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of LHRP Ryan Borucki from AAA Iowa and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\nBorucki is out of minor league options, and he has the right to elect free-agency if he is outrighted to the minors.\n\n4/29 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHRP Curtis Taylor.\n\n4/25 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released RHP Peyton Remy.\n\n4/18 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released second contract players RHP Kyle Johnson (previously released by NYY), RHP Stanley Guzman (previously released by TEX), and RHP Abel Moya (previously released by LAD.\n\n4/12 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released LHP Eric Stout.\n\n3/30 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of RHP Mark Leiter Jr and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\n3/29 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed free-agent LHP Jack Aldrich (ex-KC) to a 2023 minor league contract and he has been assigned to Myrtle Beach.\n\nAlso, the Cubs have released OF Ben DeLuzio.\n\n3/28 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have selected the contract of C Luis Torrens and he has been added to the MLB Reserve List (40-man roster).\n\n3/27 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs traded INF Zach McKinstry (who was on the Cubs MLB 40-man roster) to the Detroit Tigers for minor league RHP Carlos Guzman.\n\nGuzman has been assigned to AA Tennessee.\n\nAlso, Guzman is eligible to be a post-2023 MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA if he is not selected to an MLB 40-man roster or signs a 2024 minor league successor contract by 5 PM (Eastern) on the 5th day after the final game of the 2023 World Series.\n\n3/26 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have reclaimed RHP Chris Clarke (selected by the Seattle Mariners in the Major League Phase of the 2022 MLB Rule 5 Draft) and he has been assigned back to the AAA Iowa reserve list.\n\n3/24 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have released INF Christian Donahue, RHP Trey Lang, LHP Andricson Salvador, and INF Esmarly Tatis. (C Fredy Montenegro was also released, but he was not Rule 5 Draft eligible).\n\n3/23 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have sold the contract of minor league INF Esteban Quiroz to the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n1/31 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA RHP Curtis Taylor to a 2023 minor league contract.\n\n1/30 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA RHPs Tyler Duffey, Jordan Holloway, and Mark Leiter Jr to 2023 minor league contracts.\n\nAll three are out of minor league options should they be added to the MLB 40-man roster at some point in 2023, and all three also have the right to elect free-agency if outrighted after being added to the 40.\n\nHowever, Duffey has Article XIX-A rights, so once he is added to the 40, he cannot be sent to the minors without his consent.\n\n1/24 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have sent RHP Manuel Rodriguez and LHP Anthony Kay outright to AAA Iowa. Both were Designated for Assignment last week.\n\nNeither pitcher has the right to elect free-agency if outrighted, but both will be an MLB Rule 9 minor league 6YFA post-2023 if the player does not sign a 2024 minor league successor contract or is added back to the MLB 40-man roster in the meantime.\n\n1/20 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA catcher Luis Torrens to a 2023 minor league contract.\n\nTorrens is out of minor league options if he is added to the MLB 40-man roster at some point in 2023, and he has the right to elect free agency if he were to be outrighted after being added to the 40.\n\n1/13 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA OF Mike Tauchman to a 2023 minor league contract. He played in the KBO in 2022. Tauchman has Article XX-D player status, so he can elect free-agency if he is added to the 40 at some point in 2023 and then is subsequently sent outright to the minors. He is also out of minor league options, should he be added to the 40.\n\n1/12 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA RHRP Vinny Nittoli to a 2023 minor league contract. He was released by the Phillies yesterday after being Designated for Assignment last week. Nittoli has Article XX-D player status, so he can elect free-agency if he is added to the 40 at some point in the future and then is subsequently outrighted back to the minors.\n\n1/6 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA RHSP Nick Neidert to a 2023 minor league contract. He was non-tendered by the Miami Marlins in November.\n\n1/4 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed signed FA LHRP Ryan Borucki to a 2023 minor league contract. Borucki is out of minor league options should he be added to the 40 at some point in 2023. He also has the right to elect free-agency if he is added to the 40 and then is subsequently outrighted back to the minors.\n\n1/2 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA C Dom Nunez to a 2023 minor league contract. He was non-tendered by the San Francisco Giants in November.\n\nAlso, the Cubs have re-signed LHRP Brad Wieck (2022 TJS) to a 2023 minor league contract with a 2024 addendum. Wieck is out of minor league options if he is added back to the 40-man roster at any point during the next two seasons. He also has the right to elect free-agency if he is added to the 40 and then is subsequently outrighted back to the minors. Although he is not eligible to be a minor league FA until post-2024, he will be eligible for selection in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft if he is not added back to the 40 or released in the meantime.\n\n12/20 UPDATE:\n\nThe Cubs have signed FA LHP Roenis Elias to a 2023 minor league contract.
