Montreal has a 0-0-1 record against LIGA MX clubs in this tournament, having defeated UNAM 2(4)-2(2) on penalties last year.\n\nBased in San Luis PotosÃ­, central Mexico, the team was founded in 2013. In 2017, Spanish club AtlÃ©tico de Madrid became the club's majority shareholder. San Luis won promotion to the Mexican top flight in 2019. The club plays its home games at the Estadio Alfonso Lastras and is currently in 10th place in the Apertura 2024 with a 1-2-1 record."
