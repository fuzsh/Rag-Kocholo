        "text": "SEATTLE — Nelson Cruz seemed confident Monday that his sore left wrist wouldn’t land him on the injured list. But as the days of the week piled up and Cruz remained out of the lineup, the Twins finally made a move, placing him on the 10-day injured list.\n\nThe move is retroactive to May 14.\n\nCruz had pain in his left wrist in 2016 while with the Mariners. The IL stint means the Twins’ designated hitter will not play this weekend against his former team. He is the second Twin to land on the IL this week, joining catcher Mitch Garver, who suffered a high ankle sprain on Wednesday.\n\nThe Twins called up 22-year-old infielder Luis Arraez to make his major league debut. Arraez has played in just three games above the Double-A level, having just been called up to Triple-A Rochester this week after Nick Gordon landed on the injured list himself.\n\nWhile in Pensacola, Arraez slashed .342/.415/.397 in 38 games. He went 5 for 14 in his brief time in Rochester. Listed as the team’s No. 17 prospect per MLBPipeline, Arraez is a .331 lifetime minor league hitter, signing with the Twins out of Venezuela in late 2013.\n\nDuring his time in big league camp this spring, Arraez made an impression on manager Rocco Baldelli, who said he had the “unique baseball player gene” in him and played with the mind of someone with far more experience.\n\n“He has very nice feel for what he’s doing with the bat in his hands,” Baldelli said. “…You watch him in the field, you watch him hold runners, he’s got a great baseball mind. He plays with really good energy.\n\n“He knows what he’s doing, regardless of age or experience. He has a really good feel. He looks like a big leaguer out on the field as he’s playing.”\n\nAnd now, he is."
