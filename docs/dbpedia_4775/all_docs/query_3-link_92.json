        "text": "With nine matchdays down and 44 matches played, the picture of the Knockout Round bracket is coming into clearer focus. Some clubs are sitting pretty with their Group first place spot secured while others will have to wait until the bitter end of the Group Stage play for their Leagues Cup fate to be sealed.\n\nOn August 6, one game stands alone: New England vs. Nashville at Gillette Stadium. And Nashville really needs to hit it out of the park if they want to repeat their 2023 Leagues Cup performance and make it to the Final. Only a win by 2+ goals will see them through to the Knockout Round. Anything less, itâll be New England and Mazatlan. The placements do come down to the wire: the Rev will take #1 and Mazatlan #2 in most cases, except if Nashville win by just 1 goal, in which case Mazatlan takes the top spot and New England the second. If Nashville wins by exactly 2 goals, Mazatlan also takes the first, but if they win by 3 or more, the tickets will swap and Nashville will sit atop Group East 5.\n\nTickets for all matches â including LIGA MX hub venues â are available on LeaguesCup.com/tickets and are also available to fans via the hosting MLS club, if applicable. MLS club season ticket holders should contact their club representative for more information or visit LeaguesCup.com and follow @LeaguesCup on social. For every ticket purchased, two meals will be donated as part of the United Against Hunger program."
