Boston won in overtime 2-1, on a Pasternak goal that he scored after corralling a crazy bounce off the boards. Sometimes tightly fought games end in a crazy bounce.\n\nOh right, not why I’m here...\n\nDiamondbacks crushed by Padres in nightmarish stretch: ‘We’re pretty frustrated’\n\nhttps://arizonasports.com/story/3547238/diamondbacks-crushed-by-padres-in-nightmarish-stretch-were-pretty-frustrated/\n\nSloppy DBacks blasted by Padres in latest ugly loss\n\n“This has been a pretty terrible little stretch for us,” Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll said. “I think everyone is doing their best to not get too tied up into their results and just make sure that we’re focusing on taking away the things that we can from it, learning from it and moving forward.”\n\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/mlb/diamondbacks/2024/05/04/offense-absent-again-as-diamondbacks-take-double-digit-loss/73575025007/\n\nOn rough road, D-backs keep eyes forward\n\n“Not our finest hour, for sure,” Lovullo said. “It’s obvious right now that we are grinding, things aren’t going well and we just aren’t getting the job done. The past 2 1/2 hours or whatever, what I watched was unsatisfactory. That was not the Diamondbacks’ style of baseball in a lot of different areas.”\n\nhttps://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/brandon-pfaadt-dbacks-seek-turnaround\n\nDiamondbacks prospect Deyvison De Los Santos showing improvement after MLB chance\n\n“I think it was a great experience for him, I think he learned what it was going to take for him to succeed at the higher level. He’s put his mind to that. So I give him all the credit in the world he came back and was willing to do the work.”\n\nhttps://arizonasports.com/story/3547215/diamondbacks-prospect-deyvison-de-los-santos-showing-improvement-after-mlb-chance/\n\nOther Baseball\n\nHow Orioles’ Gunnar Henderson became an early MVP candidate\n\n“I want to ultimately be one of the best players to play the game,” Henderson said. “I feel like that’s how I’ve carried myself.”\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/40069432/gunnar-henderson-mvp-candidate-baltimore-orioles\n\nYankees slugger Aaron Judge ejected for first time in career\n\nWelcome to the ump show...\n\n“Very surprising, especially in a 5-3 game, late in the game,” Judge said. “Battling a 3-2 count and kind of walking away saying my piece. I’ve said a lot worse. ... I usually try not to make a scene in situations like that. So a little surprised [that] walking away that happened.”\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/40083117/yankees-slugger-aaron-judge-ejected-first-career\n\nPablo López strikes out 8 in 6 innings as Twins beat Red Sox 3-1 for 12th straight victory\n\nhttps://sports.yahoo.com/pablo-l-pez-strikes-8-210640107.html\n\nPhillies Place Trea Turner On 10-Day Injured List\n\nhttps://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2024/05/phillies-place-trea-turner-on-10-day-injured-list.html\n\nMarlins President Peter Bendix Discusses Luis Arraez Trade\n\nThe club’s top baseball ops official indicated to Andy Slater of Fox Sports 640 that he “doesn’t know what to expect” when asked whether or not 2022 All Star Jazz Chisholm Jr. who is just 26 years old and is under team control through the end of the 2026 season, would remain in the organization through the end of the season.\n\nhttps://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2024/05/marlins-president-peter-bendix-discusses-luis-arraez-trade.html\n\nRooker’s McGwire turn sparks 10-run third, 6th straight win\n\nAnd Big Mac had “help!”\n\nhttps://www.mlb.com/athletics/news/brent-rooker-homers-twice-in-athletics-10-run-third-inning\n\nAnything Goes\n\nThis day in history:\n\nI’ve been wanting to post this for a couple of weeks as soon as I saw Sunday was 5/5. Essentially an Austrian Wehrmacht, an SS person and American personnel teamed up to defend the castle against an SS Division that was sent to liquidate the French VIPs that had been imprisoned there.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Castle_Itter\n\nThe history channel page doesnt even mention it, but here you go\n\nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/day/may-5\n\nThis day in baseball:\n\nhttps://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/May_5\n\nPaul Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, didn’t have a funeral or headstone. When he was close to death, Tibbets decided he didn’t want a funeral or a headstone as he worried it would become a place for protesting nuclear armament. Instead, he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over the English Channel.\n\nIn 1710, Native American leaders traveled to Britain to visit Queen Anne. The four Mohawk Kings from one of the Iroquois Confederacy’s Five Nations and the Algonquian peoples were treated with high honor as diplomats. Transported through the streets of London in Royal Carriages, they were personally met by the Queen herself at the Court of St. James Palace."
