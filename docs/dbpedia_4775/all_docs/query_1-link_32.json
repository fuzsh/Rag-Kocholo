He was a down-ballot MVP candidate last season who’s heading into free agency, as well as a former MVP and Rookie of the Year. He would have been labeled a unicorn back in the day, given his ability to play Gold Glove-level defense in centerfield and at first base, except that Shohei Ohtani has now redefined what unicorn means in baseball. Bellinger is only 28, and probably still has some prime years left. Normally, this kind of guy would get a fanbase all hopped up on goofballs with the news of his signing.
