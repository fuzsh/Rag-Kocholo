        "text": "DALLAS (March 23, 2024) — Coming out of Thursday’s dramatic come-from-behind semifinal victory against Jamaica, the United States Men’s National Team has earned its third-straight berth in the Concacaf Nations League Final, in which they will square off against perennial rivals Mexico at AT&T Stadium on Sunday.\n\nUSMNT vs. Mexico: Starting XI & Lineup Notes\n\nMatch Hub: Lineups & Live Score\n\nThe opening whistle blows at 9:15 p.m. ET, with broadcast coverage available on Paramount+ and Univision. Alongside broadcast coverage, fans will also be able to follow the match via Facebook, Twitter @USMNT, Instagram @USMNT and the official U.S. Soccer App.\n\nDETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB/COUNTRY; CAPS/GOALS)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): 22-Drake Callender (Inter Miami; 0/0), 18-Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City/WAL; 9/0), 1-Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 38/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (8): 2-Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 32/2), 23-Kristoffer Lund (Palermo/ITA; 3/0), 16-Mark McKenzie (Genk/BEL; 13/0), 13-Tim Ream (Fulham/ENG; 55/1), 3-Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 15/1), 5-Antonee Robinson (Fulham/ENG; 40/4), 12-Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 29/3), 19-Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/GER; 9/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (5): 4-Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 37/1), 15-Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 10/0), 8-Weston McKennie (Juventus/ITA; 50/11), 6-Yunus Musah (AC Milan/ITA; 34/0), 7-Gio Reyna (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 25/7)\n\nFORWARDS (7): 11-Brenden Aaronson (Union Berlin/GER; 39/8), 20-Folarin Balogun (Monaco/FRA; 9/3), 17-Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 9/0), 9-Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 23/10), 10-Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/ITA; 65/28), 21-Tim Weah (Juventus/ITA; 36/5), 14-Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 8/4)\n\nGOING FOR THREE\n\nSunday’s Final represents an opportunity for the USMNT to remain the only team to have lifted the CNL championship, having captured the title in the first two editions of the competition held in 2021 and 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Christian Pulisic’s brace and Ricardo Pepi’s goal off the bench helped the USA to a 3-0 win against Mexico in the CNL Semifinal, before Chris Richards and Folarin Balogun each scored their first international goals off Gio Reyna assists to give the USA a 2-0 win against Canada in the Final. Goalkeeper Matt Turner kept back-to-back clean sheets in the two matches.\n\nIn the inaugural championship match in 2021 against Mexico, following dramatic goals from Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic, substitute goalkeeper Ethan Horvath made the extra time penalty stop on Andres Guardado to ensure the USA’s 3-2 win.\n\nSURVIVE AND ADVANCE\n\nThe U.S. arrives at Sunday’s Nations League Final on the back of a rollercoaster semifinal match against Jamaica on Thursday.\n\nThe Reggae Boyz jumped out to a very early lead, putting together a sequence off of a throw-in that saw Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s end line cross put away on a Greg Leigh header inside the match’s opening minute.\n\nThe U.S. dominated possession over the course of the next 94 minutes, while attempting 20 shots, but were routinely foiled by a stout Jamaican defensive setup. At last, in the final sequence of regular time, Haji Wright earned the U.S. a corner kick that Christian Pulisic arrived to take. Pulisic’s ball into the box found the head of defender Miles Robinson, who nodded it backwards, deflecting off the head of Jamaican forward Cory Burke and into the back of the net to equalize at the 90+5 minute mark and send the match to extra time.\n\nSeven minutes into the first period, Gio Reyna and Haji Wright would combine for the first of two extra time goals that would secure the U.S. its advancement to the Final. In the 97th minute, Reyna picked up a loose ball near midfield and deftly picked out Wright, who was making a central run into the box. Reyna’s well-weighted pass found Wright in stride, allowing the striker to take a touch and put a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Andre Blake.\n\nThen, in the 109th minute, Wright once again found himself on the end of a Reyna through-ball, and once again picked up the pass running into the left side of the box. Wright’s first touch was heavy, but he managed to collect with his back to goal, turn, and put a shot into the right side of the net to give the U.S. a 3-1 lead they would not relinquish.\n\nHOW THEY GOT HERE\n\nIt took a shootout win against Honduras last fall for Mexico to arrive at this week’s CNL final four in Texas. In the first leg of the quarterfinals back in November, Honduras blanked Mexico 2-0 in Tegucigalpa. Four days later in Mexico City, El Tri leveled the series with a 2-0 win behind goals by Luis Chavez and Edson Alvarez. Level on aggregate, Mexico won the ensuing shootout, 4-2.\n\nMexico had played one game between their CNL quarterfinal series last fall and this week’s Finals, a 3-2 friendly loss to Colombia at the LA Coliseum on Dec. 16, 2023. In that match, Omar Govea and Guillermo Martinez gave El Tri a two-goal advantage, but Colombia rallied behind a trio of second half goals from defender Andres Reyes, Robert Martinez, and Andre Gomez.\n\nThis past Thursday, El Tri confidently dispatched Panama in their semifinal meeting with Panama, coming away with a 3-0 victory at AT&T Stadium courtesy of goals from Edson Alvarez, Julian Quinones, and Orbelín Pineda.\n\nVS. MEXICO\n\nMexico leads the all-time series, 36-23-17. The Americans, however, enter the match with a six-game unbeaten streak (4-0-2) against their archrivals, having last been bested by Mexico in a 3-0 result in East Rutherford, N.J. on Sept. 6, 2019.\n\nThey started their streak with a 3-2 extra time win in the CNL final at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colo. on June 6, 2021, in a match that was decided by a pair of penalty kicks. Christian Pulisic converted his spot kick in the 110th minute. Goalkeeper Ethan Horvath, who came off the bench in the second half to replace the injured Zack Steffen, denied Andres Guardado's penalty kick four minutes into stoppage time in the second extra time.\n\nMost recently, the two teams went toe-to-toe in last year’s Nations League semifinals, a commanding 3-0 victory for the U.S. on June 15, 2023 at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium. Pulisic scored on either side of halftime in the 37th and 46th minutes, and Ricardo Pepi secured the U.S. a spot in the final with a 78th minute goal.\n\nAT AT&T STADIUM\n\nThe USMNT will hope its good fortunes at AT&T Stadium continues Sunday. Historically, the team has fared well in tournament competition at the venue, with another chapter written in Thursday night’s win against Jamaica. Previously, AT&T Stadium has hosted a trio of U.S. victories in Concacaf Gold Cup play – all of which were en route to tournament titles.\n\nThose matches include a Gold Cup knockout-round match against Jamaica in 2021, in which Matthew Hoppe’s 83rd minute header proved decisive in 1-0 shutout win played on July 25 of that year.\n\nIn 2017, it was Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey providing second half goals to defeat Costa Rica 2-0 in a 2017 Gold Cup Semifinal, and - prior to that – Landon Donovan’s pair of goals and assist led the U.S. to a 3-1 semifinal victory over Honduras in the 2013 semifinals.\n\nABOUT THE CONCACAF NATIONS LEAGUE\n\nCreated to maximize the quality, quantity and frequency of competitive matches for all of Concacaf’s 41 Member Associations, the 2023-24 Concacaf Nations League, which commenced last September, has a revamped format to include more direct elimination matches that will qualify teams to continental summer competitions.\n\nThe 2023-24 CNL continues to be played in a three-League format (A, B, and C), with the region’s 41 men’s senior national teams distributed into the Leagues according to the results of the 2022-23 CNL.\n\nThe USA competed in League A, which was expanded to include 16 teams (up from 12) and a new quarterfinal round has been created to deliver more direct elimination matches.\n\nROSTER NOTES\n\nThe 23 players represent clubs in nine different countries: England (7), Italy (5), Netherlands (3), Germany (2), USA (2), Belgium (1), France (1), Spain (1), Wales (1).\n\nChristian Pulisic (65) is the leading cap-winner, followed by Tim Ream (55), Weston McKennie (50), Antonee Robinson (40), Matt Turner (38), Tyler Adams (37), and Tim Weah (36).\n\nIn total, 20 of the 23 players have been part of one of the Nations League-winning squads, with eight taking part in both championship runs in 2021 and 2023: Brenden Aaronson, Sergiño Dest, Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Tim Weah.\n\nOther 2023 CNL winners: Folarin Balogun, Drake Callender, Johnny Cardoso, Ricardo Pepi, Chris Richards, Miles Robinson, Joe Scally, and Matt Turner.\n\nOther 2021 CNL winners: Tyler Adams, Ethan Horvath, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream and Josh Sargent.\n\nPlayers on the roster have contributed eight of the team’s nine goals in previous CNL Finals tournaments: Christian Pulisic (3), Folarin Balogun, Weston McKennie, Ricardo Pepi, Gio Reyna, and Chris Richards (1 each).\n\nDefender Sergiño Dest – who served a suspension in the semifinal against Jamaica after receiving a red card in the USA’s last CNL contest at Trinidad and Tobago on Nov. 20, 2023 – will be eligible for selection on Sunday.\n\nWith three goals against Jamaica, the USMNT has now scored 137 goals in 71 matches under Gregg Berhalter, moving him past Bob Bradley (134 goals / 80 GP) for the third highest goal total among USMNT managers. He trails Bruce Arena (243 goals / 148 GP) and Jurgen Klinsmann (178 goals / 98 GP).\n\nThursday's game was the USMNT's fifth comeback win under Gregg Berhalter (Nov. 16, 2020 vs. Panama, June 6, 2021 vs. Mexico (CNL), Sept. 8, 2021 vs. Honduras (WCQ), Oct. 13, 2021 vs. Costa Rica (WCQ), March 21, 2024 vs. Jamaica (CNL)). That ties him for second most behind Jurgen Klinsmann and Bob Bradley (nine each).\n\nWith the team's next win, Gregg Berhalter (42 wins / 71 GP) will tie Bob Bradley (43 / 80 GP) for third most victories among USMNT head coaches.\n\nWith the team's next win in official competition, Gregg Berhalter (27 wins in 41 matches) will tie Jurgen Klinsmann (28 wins in 47 matches) for third in wins among USMNT matches in competitive matches. They trail Bruce Arena (47 wins / 83 matches), Bob Bradley (30 wins / 48 matches).\n\nUSA-MEXICO NOTES\n\nThe USA trails Mexico in the all-time series with a 23-36-17 record against El Trí, but holds a 18-9-8 advantage since 2000.\n\nThe USMNT is currently unbeaten in six straight matches against Mexico (4-0-2). That streak matches the team’s longest unbeaten run against Mexico, in which they went six straight without defeat (3-0-3) from 2011 to 2015.\n\nBoth goal scorers from last year’s 3-0 semifinal win against Mexico are on the roster. Christian Pulisic scored goals in both halves in that match, before Ricardo Pepi put away a late third.\n\nAll three goal scorers from the 2021 CNL Final win against Mexico are additionally on the roster. Gio Reyna put home a first-half equalizer in that match, before Weston McKennie’s late header sent the match to extra time, and Pulisic scored what would stand as the game-winning goal, beating Guillermo Ochoa from the penalty spot.\n\nWith career four goals against El Tri, Pulisic is tied with Aldo “Buff” Donelli as the USMNT’s third-leading scorer all-time in this fixture. They trail only Landon Donovan (6) and Michael Bradley (5).\n\nThis will be the 15th meeting in a knockout match for the United States and Mexico, with both sides each advancing seven times. Three of the last five knockout meetings between the two teams have gone to extra time – the 2015 Concacaf Cup, 2021 Nations League Final and 2021 Gold Cup Final.\n\nMEXICO OF LATE\n\nMexico’s only match of 2024 so far was their 3-0 win against Panama on Thursday night in the Nations League Semifinals. Prior to that, they took part in a 3-2 friendly loss to Colombia at the LA Coliseum on Dec. 16, 2023.\n\nAT THE HELM\n\nA former Mexican international midfielder, Jaime Lozano was named head coach on Aug. 10, 2023, after guiding El Tri to the Concacaf Gold Cup title as interim coach. He had taken over the reins on a temporary basis, replacing the fired Diego Cocca, after Mexico finished third in the 2023 CNL.\n\nLozano, 45, played for UNAM Pumas, Celaya, Tigres UANL, Cruz Azul and Morelia in a professional career that spanned from 1998-2013. He represented Mexico 34 times from 2000-07, scoring 12 goals.\n\nLozano started his coaching career with the UNAM Academy in 2014, joining its Queretaro counterparts the next year, becoming the senior side's assistant coach in 2016, and head coach a year later. Mexico is so far 8-3-3 under Lozano.\n\nMEXICO ROSTER BY POSITION (Club; Caps/Goals)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Luis Malagon (Club America; 4/0), Guillermo Ochoa (Salernitana/ITA; 149/0), Julio Gonzalez (Pumas; 0/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (8): Johan Vasquez (Genoa/ITA; 21/1), Jesus Gallardo (Monterrey; 97/2), Cesar Montes (Almeria/ESP; 43/1), Gerardo Arteaga (Monterrey; 21/0), Julian Araujo (Las Palmas/ESP; 13/0), Jorge Sanchez (FC Porto; POR; 40/1), Jesus Orozco (Guadalajara; 3/0), Erick Aguirre (Monterrey; 15/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Edson Alvarez (West Ham United/ENG; 75/5), Luis Chavez (Dinamo Moscow/RUS; 29/4), Roberto Alvarado (Guadalajara; 43/5), Luis Romo (Monterrey; 43/3), Orbelín Pineda (AEK Athens/GRE; 67/10), Erick Sanchez (Pachuca; 26/3), Carlos Rodriguez (Cruz Azul; 48/0)\n\nFORWARDS (5): Henry Martín (Club America; 42/9), Julian Quinones (Club America; 3/1), Santiago Gimenez (Feyenoord/NED; 24/4), Hirving Lozano (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 69/18), Uriel Antuna (Cruz Azul; 58/13)\n\nROSTER NOTES"
