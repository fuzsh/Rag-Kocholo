Luis Cruz's 13 doubles and 24 RBI combination isn't something that happens much with so few plate appearances, he is the only LA Dodger do ever do that in less than 150 plate appearances (Rick Dempsey did it in 1988 in 198 PA, he had 30 RBI).\n\nDodgers announced this morning that Scott Elbert has been activated, which makes sense given the Braves lineup. Per Ken Gurnick, Elian Herrera was optioned to open up the roster spot. This does mean that at least for today, the Dodgers will have 13 pitchers on the active roster.\n\nStarting Lineups\n\nBraves went for their lefty lineup today against Billingsley, Chad's split are fairly even, in fact, right-handed hitter Martin Prado has had the best time hitting against Chad, he his 5 for 11 with a double.\n\nDodgers Braves LF Victorino (S) CF Bourne (L) 2B Ellis LF Prado CF Kemp RF Heyward (L) SS Ramirez 1B Freeman (L) RF Ethier (L) 2B Uggla 1B Rivera 3B Francisco (L) 3B Cruz\n\nC McCann (L) C Ellis SS Janish P Billingsley\n\nP Minor (L)\n\nGame Time: 10:35 a.m.\n\nTV: KCAL"
