Shortly before the 2010-11 NBA season, then-Dallas Mavericks guard Jason Terry had the Larry O’Brien championship trophy tattooed on his bicep as motivation. It worked, with the Mavs beating the Miami Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals to capture the franchise’s first-ever title.

After a disappointing 2011-12 season, Terry signed with the Boston Celtics. With the new team came another new tattoo, this one featuring the Celtics’ famous leprechaun spinning the trophy on his finger.

This time, he wasn’t so lucky. Not only did the Celtics lose to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 playoffs, but Terry had the worst statistical season of his career.

Now, he’s a Brooklyn Net.

And with another team is apparently coming another tattoo:

At least this one, to our knowledge, doesn’t involve the championship trophy. This year’s Nets are a more realistic title contender than last year’s Celtics, but they still have the Heat, the Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers to compete with to get there. It’ll be interesting to see how Terry’s new tattoo looks — whether it’s subtle or outrageous. Knowing Terry, probably the latter.
