        "text": "Just noticed that the Bucks picked up Jason Terry via FA. Jason turn s 39 next month and may not play that much but he is an excellent mentor in the locker room and on the bench to assist Jason Kidd and his coaching staff.\n\nJason Terry is one of the NBA’s best ever 3 point shooters and will give the Bucks that option as well as helping the younger guys with their range. Given the Bucks insane length they can maybe hide Terry on defence and use his shooting to help them spread play.\n\nwhere I feel the value that a player brings off the court is just as important and the value he brings on the court. I always thought he was a vocal, even as a role player.\n\nGood \"team culture\" signing if you have the room, but realistically how long can they keep him for: 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?\n\nI fully agree with Chewy, if John Terry does retire after this year then he could easily stay on the staff as a assistant. The guy has been in the league since 1999 and has a ton of experienceto remain in the league that long he must be a wll respected pro.\n\nEven if he didn’t play as such, he could still stay on the roster as 15th man if there wasn’t a coaching vacancy for him, the Bucks ghave decent cap space so could pay him vets minimum just to have him as a mentor and be in the locker room. Effectively use him as a link between players and coaching staff.\n\nA lot will depend on what Jason’s ambitions are for when his playing career ends, does he want to get on the coaching ladder, he might get assistant offers in the NBA, could be a shooting coach, take a leading job at a college or an assistant role at a bigger college etc or does he want to do media work, business interests, enjoy the fruits of his career etc.\n\nTo me, I absolutely love this fit for Jason Terry in Milwaukee. As it was mentioned above, I think that this is a good fit both on and off the court. On the court, he allows a lot of spacing next to a lot of players who aren’t good shooters. Off of the court, he is a great leader and can be a great mentor for a locker room that is young and trying to take that next step in developing and get back to the playoffs.\n\nUltimately, I think that this is the best spot to launch the Jet’s post-playing career in coaching. There were reports in the early part of the offseason that Jason Terry was interviewing for the vacant UAB head coaching vacancy. Obviously he didn’t end up getting that job, so he had a decision to make that would help impact his future in coaching.\n\nJason Terry was teammates with Jason Kidd on that 2011 Dallas Mavericks team that won the NBA championship over that heavily favored Heat squad that featured LeBron, D-Wade, and Chris Bosh. He was one of the best role players in the entire playoffs and was (in my mind) the best offensive player not named Dirk Nowitzki that played for Dallas in that Finals series. Having a guy that is truly battle-tested and an intriguing basketball mind can only be good for these young Bucks. Terry can easily transition to coaching after this season as an assistant in the NBA. There’s no better head coach to learn under than one of the best point guards in the history of the game, as well as a former teammate that you had success at the highest level with.\n\nThis is a great fit for all parties."
