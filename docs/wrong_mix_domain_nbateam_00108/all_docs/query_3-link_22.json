        "text": "Jonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nMatt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nJoseph Treutlein\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nEric Weiss\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: Exceptionally talented offensive player who can play multiple positions. Has very good athleticism and size for a point guard, and is even able to slide over and play some shooting guard. Is still on the skinny side, but it hasnt hindered him from becoming a very effective combo guard. A great talent on the perimeter. Has a natural feel for the game. The all-time leader in steals for the Arizona Wildcats. Won an NCAA Championship with Arizona in 1997. Probably wont get a whole lot better than he is right now skill wise, but could put up big numbers on a less talented team.\n\nOffense: Very aggressive guard who can really light it up when given the green light. Has a sweet stroke, and can knock down shots from anywhere. Always looks smooth when shooting. Doesnt take long to set his feet and pull the trigger. Lights out when left open. Pretty good with a hand in his face as well. Good ball handler. Likes to pull up for jumpers when attacking right. Takes the ball to the rim when driving left. Prefers going right. Displays a very good crossover when the defense recovers. Doesnt go to the line very often. Seldom turns the ball over, but has seen his ball-handling role decrease year by year. Solid passer. Doesnt do anything fancy, but sets up his teammates well within the offense. Very efficient scoring guard. Not afraid to take responsibilities.\n\nDefense: A very talented defensive guard. Has the size, length, and lateral quickness combination necessary to guard both point guards and shooting guards effectively. This allows him to stay on the floor with most anyone next to him. Very good at moving his feet to deny penetration. Will jump into passing lanes and take bad passes the other way for easy transition baskets. Sneaks down into the paint to grab rebounds so he can push the break from time to time. Can get beaten by players who are considerably bigger and strong on the perimeter. Gives a good effort for a player that is so offensive minded."
