        "text": "BOSTON (AP) â€” The Boston Celtics have signed free agent guard Jason Terry.\n\nThe deal was reported earlier this month during a signing moratorium, then held up while the Celtics tried to work out a sign-and-trade agreement with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nInstead, Boston will use its mid-level exemption to sign the 2009 NBA Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 guard averaged 15.1 points per game for the Mavericks last year. He was second in the league with 138 made 3-pointers last season and is fourth in NBA history on the career list with 1,788.\n\nTerry is seen as a replacement for Ray Allen, who signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat."
