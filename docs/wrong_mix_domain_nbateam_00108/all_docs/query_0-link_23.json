        "text": "After elbowing Jason Terry in the face on Friday night, New York Knicks guard J.R. Smith has been suspended for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals. The Knicks currently lead the Boston Celtics 3-0 in the series.\n\nSmith, who took home Sixth Man of the Year honors earlier in the week, elbowed Terry after he swiped at the ball. Smith thought it was a foul, and when no whistle was blown, he retaliated with a pretty obvious blow to Terry's face. The officials ejected Smith from the game with a flagrant two foul.\n\nHere is a GIF of the play:\n\nThrough the first three games of the series, Smith is averaging 16.3 points while playing a little more than 30 minutes per game. Even with Smith unable to play on Sunday, the Knicks may still have enough firepower to sweep the series. They have won the past two games by a combined 30 points, and the veteran-laden Celtics have struggled to score throughout.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Russell Westbrook's injury turns playoffs upside down\n\n• Boston's beaten down and beat up\n\n• The best GIFs from Friday night\n\n• With Kahn out, Wolves can move forward\n\n• LeBron's mad he didn't win DPOY"
