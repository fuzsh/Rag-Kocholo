        "text": "The Jet loves tattoos. He’s got a Larry O’Brien trophy on his left biceps from his title with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nJason Terry even got a Lucky the Leprechaun tattoo when he joined the Boston Celtics. They were at the tail end of their second Big Three era and were hoping he could provide the spark to carry them to one last title.\n\nThat small ember burned out in the first round against Carmelo Anthony, J.R. Smith and the New York Knicks in 2012. It became apparent that Boston was at the end of the road with their old Hall of Famers in Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce. Rajon Rondo was looking like a potential MVP candidate, but there were too many issues both physically and personality-wise for this to work.\n\nSo Danny Ainge did one of the boldest moves in modern NBA history and traded away everybody. First it was the three aforementioned vets, shipped off to Brooklyn for the notorious trade package that has resulted in, essentially, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving and James Young (one of these things is not like the other).\n\nTerry went off to Brooklyn as they fizzled out pretty quickly and has bounced around the league ever since, being the vocal OG in each locker room. Now with the Bucks, Terry reflected on how bold a rebuild the Celtics pulled off in an interview with the Sporting News’ Sean Deveney.\n\n“The second thing was Danny Ainge,” Terry said. “For him to stick his neck out there and trade two franchise pieces and sacrifice for the future, that took a lot. That was not an easy decision for them.”\n\nAinge continued to shock and awe this summer when he gutted half of the Celtics’ core to build around Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving, a move that has paid early dividends even with Hayward out of the year.\n\n“That was the big thing,” Terry said. “Coming back again last summer, trading Avery Bradley and Isaiah Thomas, two guys that got them to the Eastern Conference finals, that took a lot of guts. But Danny knows what he is doing, he has been around this league a long time, not only as a player, but as a coach and in the front office now. He has had so much success, because he has an eye for talent.\n\n“Now you have him putting the right pieces together within a great system, with a good coach, with this fan base — you are going to have a great Celtics team here.”\n\nThe good coach was the first thing Terry marveled about in his interview. Brad Stevens is one of the rare superstar coaches in this league, ironic considering his measured demeanor and lack of panache. But it is these exact qualities, with a combination of cultural principles and game plan proficiency, that have endeared him to players, coaches, executives and everyone in between.\n\n“The first thing I was impressed with was the coaching,” Terry said. “When you get a guy who comes from college, it doesn’t, in our league, usually take effect very well. When you get a guy coming from college, one, he has to have respect in the locker room. Two, he has to implement a system that can carry over. For him, he has done an outstanding job with the personnel he has been given.”\n\nThe personnel is getting better and so is the team. They have an open roster spot that will come in play sometime down the road. If Terry somehow ends up a free agent, he may make a call or two to check in on his old team."
