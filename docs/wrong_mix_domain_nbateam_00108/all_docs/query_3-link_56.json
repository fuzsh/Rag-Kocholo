He had a tenured NBA career for a reason, and to have him bring that skillset and work ethic to the table is invaluable for our team and staff.”\n\nTerry was a first-round pick (10th overall) by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1999 NBA Draft. The Seattle native played in 1,534 career NBA games, earning the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2009. Terry spent eight seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, helping lead the team to their first NBA Championship in 2011.\n\n“It’s great to begin my front office career here,” said Terry. “The Dallas area has been home to me and my family for many years and the Mavericks franchise has always been family. To get to work with this organization in this capacity is exciting. I look forward to getting started.”\n\nTerry most recently suited up with the Milwaukee Bucks 2016-18 and has played in the NBA Playoffs 13 of the last 14 years. He also ranks fifth all-time in made three-pointers in league history.\n\n“To have someone with that kind of NBA experience, who wants to be involved and wants to help build and lead this team will be great for both our players and coaches,” said Al Whitley, Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Legends."
