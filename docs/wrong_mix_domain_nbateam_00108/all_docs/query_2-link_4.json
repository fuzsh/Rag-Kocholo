Iâ€™ve had some unique opportunities like this past year at the [NCAA] Division I level, interviewing for the Alabama-Birmingham job, which was a great experience and something I look forward to in the future.\n\nA veteran who has shot 37.9 percent from three-point range during his career while making a living coming off the bench for the past nine seasons represents a solid depth addition for the Bucks' backcourt."
