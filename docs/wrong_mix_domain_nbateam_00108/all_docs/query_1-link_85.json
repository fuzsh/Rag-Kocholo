        "text": "NEW YORK — Nobody is laughing quite as much at the Knicks' roster right now.\n\nDoc Rivers never did.\n\nThe Knicks' strategy of loading up on older players was risky and frequently mocked, but not by people who believe veterans make a difference in the postseason.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good strategy actually, just because of now,\" Rivers said.\n\nRivers' Boston Celtics have long been not only one of the best teams in the NBA but also one of the oldest. Now, they look at a Knicks team that has more old guys. And that experience paid off down the stretch Saturday, helping the Knicks pull out an 85-78 victory in the opener of their playoff series.\n\nGame 2 is Tuesday, when the Knicks will again count on their veterans to try for a 2-0 lead.\n\nA roster so old that for most of the season it included two players who were alive when the Knicks won their last title 40 years ago has given coach Mike Woodson just what he wanted: defense, leadership, and an Atlantic Division title.\n\n\"I couldn't be more pleased as a coach based on the guys we have fielded,\" Woodson said. \"Only time will tell. We've got to just continue our journey and take it one game at a time and see where we go with it.\"\n\nRivers noted before the series how strange it was for the Celtics to be facing a team with players older than they have. Boston is largely young beyond Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry, while Woodson can go to his bench and grab one player older than the last.\n\nJason Kidd, who turned 40 in March, played key minutes Saturday. Even though 40-year-old Kurt Thomas and 38-year-old Rasheed Wallace are no longer around after season-ending foot injuries, 35-year-old Kenyon Martin is there in a key backup role, and Marcus Camby, 39, waits if the Knicks need him.\n\nWith starting guard Pablo Prigioni out with a sprained ankle and All-Star center Tyson Chandler struggling in his return from a bulging disk, Kidd and Martin both played the entire fourth quarter Saturday, when the Knicks outscored the Celtics, 18-8. Martin had five points, including the basket that essentially put away the game with 40 seconds left, and three rebounds in the period. Kidd had three rebounds and three steals, disrupting Boston's offense so badly that the Celtics committed eight turnovers in the period.\n\n\"I know what Kenyon can do on the defensive end. J-Kidd, he was just spectacular,\" said Knicks All-Star Carmelo Anthony, recalling a play where Kidd dived on the floor to gain possession and set up Raymond Felton's trip to the foul line.\n\n\"Plays like that, J-Kidd, we expect J-Kidd to make those. K-Mart, on the defensive end, we really don't have to double-team a lot of people when he's down there on the post. We can stay home, we can play our schemes, we can do our schemes. He's playing unbelievable right now.\"\n\nThe Celtics could use a player like Kidd, instead of having to go against him.\n\n(Knicks lead series 1-0; x - if necessary) Saturday, April 20: Knicks 85, Boston 78 Tuesday, April 23: Boston at Knicks, 8 p.m. Friday, April 26: Knicks at Boston, 8 p.m. Sunday, April 28: Knicks at Boston, 1 p.m. x-Wednesday, May 1: Boston at Knicks, TBA x-Friday, May 3: Knicks at Boston, TBA x-Sunday, May 5: Boston at Knicks, TBA\n\nknicks vs. celtics"
