        "text": "The 13-year veteran hopes he and the Mavericks are on the same page in regards to that extension. “I don’t think it’s been talked about officially, but they know where I’m at with it,” Terry said Monday. “I’ve never been in my entire career a restricted free agent and now it’s time to be a staple of this organization. “Being here as long as I have, I think I’ve earned it. And we’ll see what happens.”\n\nTerry, a 34-year-old who is in the final season of his contract, said he doesn’t get involved with teammates to the point where he tells them what type of deal they should accept. “I never speak on another player’s money, and it’s not even about that,” Terry said. “It’s just letting him know how much we want him to be a part of this team this year.”\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks will raise their banner on opening day, but they won’t get to flash any championship bling in front of their Christmas Day opponent and NBA Finals victim, the Miami Heat. Mavs owner Mark Cuban has not had the 2010-11 championship rings designed because he wants to get input from Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry and Jason Kidd as to how the rings should look, Cuban confirmed Thursday night.\n\nTerry said Thursday he was preparing to listen to pitches from Chinese teams to play there if the NBA season was canceled, at least partly because his brother already is playing in that part of the world. “I’m very glad,” Terry said about not being tied to an international team. “I’m not going to lie to you. There was a point when they said the season would be canceled when I started fishing around to see if it was a possibility. “And my brother actually just went to Japan two weeks ago. So that in itself – OK, got some family over there – might be something to look at.”\n\nOklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant, who made one trip to Baylor during his lone season with the Texas Longhorns is returning with his pals LaMarcus Aldridge, Josh Howard, John Wall, Jason Terry, Tracy McGrady and others for what’s being called the Celebrity All-Star Basketball Game, according to a release sent out by the Baylor Bears basketball media relations office. The game is scheduled for Dec. 1 at the Ferrell Center, the home of the Big 12’s Bears. The release was distributed on the same day the NBPA walked away from the owners’ latest proposal, leaving the state of the 2011-12 season in limbo."
