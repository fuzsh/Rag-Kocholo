        "text": "Before we get to a video of Boston Celtics shooting guard Jason Terry making 17 straight jump shots after practice Friday, I have a quick story to illustrate the great accuracy of the NBA's best shooters.\n\nDuring two of my years at Skidmore College, the New York Knicks held training camp at my school. Because I played on the basketball team (or, to be more factual, because I held a roster spot on the basketball team), I was allowed to be a ball boy at their practices.\n\nThe experience was cool -- Jerome James asked one of my buddies to make him a sandwich midway through one of the practices; Stephon Marbury's \"Starbury\" shoe broke during another, and he asked me to borrow my sneakers because the Knicks didn't have a backup pair for him (sadly, my shoes were too big); and one Mardy Collins dunk I got to witness was very awesome.\n\nBut the particular story I want to share involves Allan Houston and a free throw line. After one of their practices, the Knicks were tasked with making 10 straight foul shots before they could leave the gym. Most of the players struggled slightly, which was natural -- even for the world's best shooters, making 10 straight free throws isn't easy. But Houston -- who by then was washed-up, and who would get cut before the Knicks played their first regular season game -- stood at one basket, and he began drilling shots.\n\nAs I remember a few years later (read: my memory might be slightly hazy), he made a couple before people started to notice. Once his teammates collectively realized something like, \"wait, this is Allan Houston, and he's probably going to make us look bad by hitting 10 straight and leaving practice before anyone else,\" they began screaming to try to break his concentration. When that didn't work, they quickly escalated their attempts at executing a BASEketball-esque psyche-out. Houston's teammates approached him and waved their arms to try disrupting him. They shouted in his ear. They started throwing balls at Houston.\n\nNone of it worked. He hit his 10 straight and walked off the court to ice his knees."
