        "text": "Jason Terry’s rookie season in the NBA was 1999-2000 with the Atlanta Hawks, the last year I lived in the ATL and covered the Hawks before moving to Manhattan. That Hawks team went 28-54, and I was able to spend a lot of time that season chatting with JT. So, here are several things you should know but that you probably didn’t think you needed to know about Dallas’s indispensable guard.\n\nTerry grew up in Seattle in a single-parent home, the second-oldest of ten kids. \"Getting food was a race,\" he told me. His Mom often worked late, leaving the kids home alone. One evening, his brother was jumping on the bed and he flipped off and \"cracked his head open.\" Jason and his older sister took him to the hospital by bus.\n\nWhen Jason Terry was in the third grade, his P.E. teacher was Slick Watts, the former steals and assists leader for the Seattle SuperSonics, and wearer of perhaps the jauntiest headband in NBA history. \"Actually, it was probably the easiest gym class I ever had,\" Terry said. \"All we did was play basketball. It was in third grade. That’s all we did the whole day.\" Watts is also the reason Terry wears a headband during every game.\n\nThe first time Jason Terry drove a car was when he was 14 years old. His mother was in labor in the passenger seat. \"I didn’t even have a permit,\" Jason remembered. \"She’s kicking me, going, ’Come on, pick it up! What are you doing?’ She was having the baby right there!\"\n\nGrowing up, Jason Terry’s favorite sport was football. His cousin, Ron Milus, played at University of Washington, and Terry would often visit the locker room and collect sweatbands and gloves. He hoped to pursue a career in football until he was in ninth grade, until one day his mom came home and caught him wearing his football pads around the house. This incident ended Terry’s football career.\n\nBefore Terry’s senior season in high school, he called a press conference to announce his college selection. \"I put a Washington hat on, said I was going to Washington. Then, the next week, Lute Olson called me up. Arizona! Let me check this out. So I went down there, and Damon Stoudamire was my host. It was ninety degrees in October! I fell in love with it, man.\"\n\nJason Terry’s first game for Arizona was in New York City against Georgetown and Allen Iverson: \"Oh, he beat me bad with this crossover! The announcer on the TV even said, ’Oh, he better pick his jockstrap up!’ And I’m playing the tape for my boys... But I did score my first college basket on a lay-up.\"\n\n\"Best Jason Terry story?\" Josh Pastner asked me. When I spoke to him, Pastner was an assistant at Arizona; today he’s the head coach at Memphis. \"I’m the all-time leading rebounder for Jason Terry. Right before his senior year, I told him he’s got to get his butt in gear; he met me every day during the offseason, at 7 a.m. in McKale Center, that whole offseason.\"\n\n\"A lot of guys shoot 600 jumpers a day, but how many guys make six or seven hundred?\" Terry asked. \"I started out, man, it took like three hours! I was like, ’Damn, Josh! You sure this is going to help my game?’ And he was like, ’You see Mike Bibby. You see Dickerson? This is what they did.’ So I’m just trusting him, not really knowing. And man, my shot was going everywhere; he’s running all over the place. Then, like a month later, we were in and out in an hour.\"\n\nTerry won a national championship as a junior at Arizona, and after his senior season he was drafted tenth overall by the Atlanta Hawks. When he was at Arizona, he would sleep in his game uniform every night before games. \"They cut that out in the NBA,\" he said. Once he joined the NBA, he began wearing a pair of shorts from the opposing team the night before each game. He also developed a habit of eating chicken before every game. Plus he plays while wearing five pairs of socks, layered from the bottom up in extending lengths. The socks that go all the way to his knees, the outermost layer, are a tribute to his father.\n\nSince reaching the NBA, Terry has adopted the nickname \"JET,\" even emulating an airplane after making big buckets. It’s catchy. It’s also his initials: Jason Eugene Terry.\n\nAfter his rookie season, Terry decided he needed to learn the mid-range jumper, a shot that has basically carried him through today. \"My uncle put me in contact with George Gervin,\" Terry said. \"Even though he’s 6-foot-7, he taught me fundamentals. Footwork was a big key. Life on my jump shot, that was another one. I spent a week out there, working out twice a day. We shot 400 makes per session. No threes, just all mid-range jumpers.\"\n\nBefore the 2010-11 season started, Mavs guard DeShawn Stevenson hosted a get-together for his teammates. Stevenson made available his personal tattoo artist. Terry took advantage of opportunity to get the NBA championship trophy tattooed on the inside of his right bicep. \"Everybody laughed and they thought it was a joke at the time,\" Terry told ESPNDallas. \"When they actually saw me get it, they were like, ’This boy is serious.’ And our whole talk and conversation was about right now, about us getting to this point and winning it all.\"\n\n—Lang Whitaker\n\nWhitaker, editor-at-large of SLAM Magazine, _is the author of _In The Time Of Bobby Cox: The Atlanta Braves, Their Manager, My Couch, Two Decades and Me.
