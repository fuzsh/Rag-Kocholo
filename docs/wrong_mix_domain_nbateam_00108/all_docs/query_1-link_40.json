        "text": "It is not even the start of the NBA season and the Brooklyn Nets and New York Knicks are already at each other’s head. With the Nets acquiring Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Jason Terry, and Andrei Kirilenko this Knicks and Nets rivalry is just heating up. These two teams cannot even wait until the start of the NBA preseason to start running their mouth.\n\nIt all started with Nets new comer Paul Pierce. In an interview Pierce was reported saying: “I think the hate for the Knicks has grown a little. Everybody knows how much I disliked the Knicks when I was with the Celtics, but I think it’s grown to another level. I think it’s time for the Nets to start running this city.” These were big words from Pierce that ended up putting a fire in some of the Knicks players.\n\nBecause of Pierce remarks, it leads to JR Smith having to come back and respond to Pierce comments. In an interview Smith\n\nresponded saying that “I just look at him as a bitter person just getting out of Boston. He doesn’t really know what New York is all about. He’s been playing in Boston his whole career. … He just knows, just know that his words have consequences and he’s going to have to pay for them.” In addition to that Smith later guarantee that the New York Knicks will win the NBA Championship this upcoming season.\n\nWith Smith saying that he is 100% positive that the Knicks are going to win the NBA Championship this season it just spark more flames in this coming season between the two teams, causing more players to enter this war of words. This caused another Nets newcomer, Jason Terry, to get in the mix. Terry responded to Smith by saying “Maybe the Rucker Park Championship. I don’t know, not the NBA championship. I don’t see how they could guarantee that, at all.” This is important because this is a big blow to the Knicks because Rucker Park championship is for street ball.\n\nAll I know I can’t wait for the NBA season, especially with this match up. Although the Knicks and Nets won’t have their first meeting of the season until December 5 you can tell that this war of words will continue through the season. Both teams made improvement in their roster so they can reach that ultimate goal of winning an NBA Championship. This NBA season should be a great one, and I cannot wait until it starts because the Eastern Conference is heating up."
