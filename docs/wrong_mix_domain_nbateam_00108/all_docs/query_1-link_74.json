        "text": "American basketball player (born 1996)\n\nJalen Marquis Brunson[1] (born August 31, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was drafted with the 33rd overall selection of the 2018 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks and played his first four seasons in the NBA with them. He played college basketball for Villanova University, where he was the National Player of the Year as a junior and won two national championships.\n\nBrunson participated in the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit. He led Stevenson to the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 4A championship. He won Illinois Mr. Basketball and earned the MVP of the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. Brunson was a role player for the championship season of the 2015–16 Villanova Wildcats and the National Player of the Year and a Consensus first-team 2018 All-American for the championship season of the 2017–18 Wildcats.\n\nBrunson played four years for the Dallas Mavericks. After helping the Mavericks reach the Western Conference finals, he signed with the New York Knicks as a free agent in 2022. With the Knicks, he became an NBA All-Star and received an All-NBA Team selection for the first time in 2024. He set the NBA record for most three point shots made in a half without a miss (8) and tied the NBA record for most three point shots made in a single-game without a miss (9).\n\nBorn in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Brunson was raised in southern New Jersey until sixth grade. He is the son of Rick and Sandra Brunson.[2] He has a sister Erica (born c. 2001).[3] His parents met at Temple University where Rick played for the basketball team and Sandra played volleyball.[2] Rick went on to spend nine seasons in the NBA.[3] The family first settled in Cherry Hill, New Jersey but moved seven times before settling in Lincolnshire, Illinois in 2010 where Jalen played his high school career for Stevenson High School.[2] As a youth, he spent time in NBA locker rooms such as when his father played for the Knicks where his future head coach Tom Thibodeau was serving as an assistant coach.[4]\n\nAs a freshman, Brunson was an All–Lake County honorable mention selection in 2012,[5] as Stevenson finished the season with a 17–11 record.[6] During his sophomore season, Stevenson started the season 10–4 before going on a 19-game winning streak.[7] That year, Brunson led Stevenson to the March 16, 2013, IHSA Class 4A championship game against Jabari Parker and Kendrick Nunn's three-time defending state champion Simeon Career Academy, where he got the Simeon backcourt in foul trouble in the first half before being held to one point in the second half of a 58–40 loss. Stevenson finished the season 29–5.[8] Following the season, the Associated Press named him to the Class 4A All-state second team as the only sophomore on the first or second team.[9] Brunson averaged 21.5 points that season.[10]\n\nOn February 21, 2014, junior Brunson scored 57 points in a double overtime victory over Lake Forest High School. The performance gave him both the school single-game and career scoring records.[11][12] On March 21, Brunson set the IHSA playoff single game scoring record against the Jahlil Okafor–led Whitney Young High School by scoring 56 points in a 75–68 state playoff semi-final loss.[13] In the game, still images of a movement by Brunson appeared to be an obscene gesture, but video of the gesture were deemed to be inconclusive and an initial suspension for the subsequent consolation game was overturned.[14][15] Brunson averaged 26.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.9 steals for a Stevenson team that finished the season with a 32–2 record.[10][16] Two members of his high school team were National Football League athletes' offspring: Matt Morrissey and Cameron Green.[11] Brunson was named Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Illinois as a junior.[17] Following the season, Associated Press named him as the only non-senior on the Class 4A All-state first team that also included Okafor, Cliff Alexander, Tyler Ulis and Sean O'Mara.[18] He finished fourth in the 2014 Illinois Mr. Basketball voting.[19] In April 2014, Illinois, Purdue, Kansas and Villanova had in-home visits.[20] On May 3, 2014, he announced the eight schools that he was considering playing college basketball for: UConn, Michigan State, Illinois, Kansas, Purdue, Villanova, Michigan and Temple.[21] That summer he was the number one rated point guard according to ESPN,[2] although the class had a notable shortage of elite pure point guards.[22] On June 25—the day after Jalen won a gold medal at the 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship—Rick Brunson received an offer as an on-bench assistant coach from Temple.[23] The Temple offer fell through when Rick Brunson was arrested on various charges on July 25, and Temple fell out of the running for Jalen's services.[24][25] Brunson participated in the July 9–11 LeBron James Skills Academy.[26] On August 5, he announced official visits to Illinois on August 29–31, Villanova on September 4–6 and then Temple from September 11–13 and on August 9, he announced official visits to Michigan State from September 19–21 and Purdue on September 26–28.[27]\n\nOn September 8, Brunson announced that he would be curtailing his recruitment and making his decision between Illinois and Villanova on September 10.[28] On that date, Brunson committed to Villanova.[25][29][30] At the time of his decision, he was ranked as the number one point guard in the national class of 2015 by Scout.com.[24] Stevenson was a preseason top-10 team in the MaxPreps national high school rankings.[31] A lot was expected of Brunson's team after losing to teams led by Parker and Okafor in the IHSA tournament final four in 2013 and 2014 even though no team from Lake County has ever won a state basketball championship.[10] The team rattled off 11 straight victories to start the season before losing 88–81 to Chaminade Prep and its star Jayson Tatum in the Cancer Research Classic in Wheeling, WV, despite 48 points from Brunson.[32][33][34] On January 17, Brunson and Stevenson faced Derryck Thornton, Jr. and Findlay Prep at the Hoophall Classic. At the time, Brunson was the number 3 ranked point guard in the class of 2015 and Thornton was the number 2 ranked point guard in the class of 2016 for the number 1 team in the country according to USA Today.[35] Findlay, who was led by Arizona signee Allonzo Trier's 27 points, held Brunson to 26 in the second loss of the season for Stevenson,[36] who had been 15–1.[37] On January 28, he was named to the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game roster,[38] becoming the second player from Lake County to earn such recognition.[39] On February 2, he was named to the 11-man Team USA for the Nike Hoop Summit.[40] On February 21, Stevenson lost to Simeon as Brunson posted 25 points on 9–24 shooting, ending a 22-game in-state streak in a game that featured the top two teams in the state.[41] The Simeon frontline featured three Big Ten Conference signees: D. J. Williams (Illinois), Ed Morrow (Nebraska) and Isaiah Moss (Iowa).[42] On March 5, he was named to the Jordan Brand Classic roster.[43]\n\nOn March 17, Brunson helped Stevenson qualify for a third consecutive appearance in the IHSA final four with a victory over Riverside Brookfield High School. In the game, Brunson became the Lake County career scoring record holder.[44][45] On March 19, Brunson received the highest vote total for the Illinois Class 4A Associated Press All-state team.[46] On March 20, he repeated as Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year.[47] Brunson led Stevenson to the IHSA final four for a third consecutive time, but he led the team to the first state championship by a Lake county school with an IHSA Class 4A title-game record 30 points in a 57–40 victory over Normal Community High School. Brunson was 9-for-15 from the field and 9-for-9 from the free throw line.[48][49] 2015 was Lake county's ninth consecutive year with a team reaching the IHSA final four; Stevenson became the first school in the large school division and the third school overall to win IHSA football and basketball state championships in the same year.[50] The win got him out of the shadow of IHSA final four losses to Parker- and Okafor-led teams.[51] Following the season, he won Illinois Mr. Basketball with 552 points and 99 of the 132 first place votes, ahead of fellow Jordan Brand All-American selection Charles Matthews, who had 157 points.[39] Brunson finished his senior season with averages of 23.3 points, 5.2 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game and with shooting percentages of 38% on three-point shots and 83% on free throws.[39] At the March 30 POWERADE Jam Fest associated with the McDonald's All-American game, Brunson won the skills competition over finalists Carlton Bragg and Isaiah Briscoe, and was a finalist for the three-point shooting contest.[52][53] Brunson was a first-team Parade All-American,[54] as well as a third-team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selection.[55] In the April 11 Nike Hoops Summit, Brunson had 12 points and seven assists in a 103–101 loss.[56][57][58] In the April 17 Jordan Brand Classic, Brunson had a game-high three steals.[59] He finished his high school career ranked No. 16 in the ESPN 100 and as the #2-point guard behind Isaiah Briscoe.[60]\n\nBrunson, like his father, is a left-handed basketball player.[16] In what was regarded as a weak point guard class, Brunson was the only point guard that was ranked in the top 25 players at the conclusion of the class of 2015's junior season.[61] In addition to high ratings by the recruiting services, Brunson's peers voted him to be the best passer in high school basketball prior to his senior season.[62]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Jalen Brunson\n\nPG Lincolnshire, IL Stevenson (IL) 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) 190 lb (86 kg) Sep 10, 2014 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: N/A ESPN: ESPN grade: 90 Overall recruiting rankings: Scout: 16, 1 (IL), 1 (PG) Rivals: 15, 5 (G) ESPN: 16, 1 (IL), 2 (PG)\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.

It was his first career NBA Player of the Week award.[160] On January 18, Brunson scored 32 points in a 116–105 loss against the Washington Wizards. He scored 25-plus points in eight straight games, the longest streak by a Knicks guard since Dick Barnett in 1965.

He joined Walt Frazier and Patrick Ewing as the only players in Knicks history to put up at least 30 points and 10 assists in a playoff game.[170] New York would go on to lose to Miami in six games despite Brunson tying his playoff career-high of 41 points in a 96–92 Game 6 loss.[171]\n\nOn November 20, 2023, Brunson earned his second NBA Player of the week award as the Knicks went 3–1 while he averaged 28.5 points and 6.5 assists, including back-to-back 32-point performances.[172] On November 30, Brunson put up 42 points, six rebounds and eight assists in a 118–112 win over the Detroit Pistons.[173] He also tied the record for the most 40-point games by a point guard (5, Frazier, Stephon Marbury) in Knicks history.[174]\n\nOn December 15, he posted a then career-high 50 points on 17–23 shooting, including 9–9 three point shooting, as well as 9 assists, 6 rebounds and 5 steals in a comeback win against the Phoenix Suns.[175] He became the ninth player to score 50 points as a Knick.[176] His 9–9 game tied an NBA record for perfect three point performances that was initially set by New York Knick Latrell Sprewell who went 9–9 on February 4, 2003,[177] and twice tied by Ben Gordon for the Bulls on April 14, 2006 and for the Pistons on March 21, 2012.[178][179][180] It was the first 50-point performance in NBA history without a missed three-point shot (minimum 8 attempts),[181][a] helping snap a 13-game losing streak by the Knicks against teams with Kevin Durant.[184] Brunson was 12–12 (8–8 on threes) in the second half from the field, becoming the first NBA player to shoot 8–8 on three point shots in an NBA half.[185] The previous record of 7-for-7 had been held by many players. It had been achieved at least three times each of the prior two NBA seasons.[186] Prior to the 2021–22 NBA season, 5 players had gone 7–7 in an NBA half (all before 2015, first by Raef LaFrentz).[187] Brunson had a 7–7 (5–5 on threes) 3rd quarter.[175] On February 10, 2017, Carmelo Anthony went 5-5 on three point shots (8–8 from the field) in a quarter and 6-6 in a half for the Knicks.[188] His 35 point second half was the first time an NBA player had scored over 30 points in a half without missing from the field, while taking at least 10 field goal attempts and 5 three point attempts.[189][190] The performance marked the first time an NBA player had posted 50 points, five rebounds, five assists, five steals and five three-pointers.[190] Brunson was the sixth player and first since Anthony Davis to record 50 points, five assists, five steals on October 16, 2016 as well as the first player since Michael Jordan on March 18, 1988 to record at least 50 points, nine assists, five rebounds and five steals.[176]\n\nOn January 1, 2024, in new teammate OG Anunoby's debut with the Knicks, Brunson posted a career-high 14 assists against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[191] On January 3, he followed that up with 13 assists against the Chicago Bulls, marking his first pair of games with back-to-back double digit assist totals that season.[192] For the week of January 1—7, he was awarded his second NBA Player of the week award of the season and third of his career as he led the Knicks to a 4–0 record for the week.[193] Later in the month, Brunson posted five consecutive 30-point games.[194] Brunson's January was the 2nd highest single-month plus-minus (256) in NBA history (to Scottie Pippen's 272 in November 1996).[195] On February 1, Brunson was named as reserve for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game for the first time in his career.[196] On March 14, he scored 45 points against the Portland Trail Blazers.[197] On March 16, Brunson scored 42 points against the Sacramento Kings, becoming the fourth Knick to score 40 or more in back-to-back games, joining Anthony, Patrick Ewing and Bernard King.[198] On March 18, Brunson earned NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week recognition for averaging 35.7 points during a 3–0 week for the Knicks.[199] On March 29, Brunson put up a career-high 61 points in a 130–126 overtime loss to the San Antonio Spurs.[200] The performance was one point shy of the Knicks franchise record by Carmelo Anthony set on January 24, 2014.[201] Brunson was awarded with player of the month for March. He averaged 28.8 points and 5.8 assists per game during the month.[202] On April 7 and April 9, Brunson posted 43 points against Milwaukee and 45 against Chicago, respectively, for another back-to-back 40+ pair of games.[203][204] Then, Brunson scored 39 points despite sitting out the fourth quarter against Boston on April 11.[205] This effort made Brunson the third Knick to have posted 5 consecutive 35+-point games (King: 5, 1984–85; Anthony: 6, 2012–13).[206] By finishing the season with 7 consecutive 30-point games,[207] he tied the Knicks franchise single-season 30-point games record with his 36th (Richie Guerin, 1961-62; Ewing, 1989-90). The April 14 season finale 40-point performance against the Bulls also tied him with Ewing for second on the Knicks single-season 40-point game list with 11 (behind King, 13).[208] On April 15, Brunson earned Eastern Conference Player of the Week for averaging 38.5 points, 7.5 assists and 3.5 rebounds and shooting 50 percent on three-point shots, while leading the Knicks to a 4–0 record and a number two playoff seeding.[209] Brunson finished 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting and was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[210][211][212]\n\nIn Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Brunson scored 47 points in a 97–92 victory. The tally was a career single-game playoff-high and a Knicks single-game playoff-record. King had twice scored 46 during the 1984 NBA playoffs. With 10 assists, he became the first Knick to score 40 points during an assist-points playoff double double.[213][214] He also became the first Knick with consecutive 30-point assist-points playoff double-doubles and his 24-point second half established the Knick career record with seven 20+-point playoff halves.[206] In that series, he became the second NBA player (and the first since Oscar Robertson in the 1973 NBA playoffs) to have three 35+-point/10+-assist games in an NBA playoff series.[215] He became the first player to close out an NBA playoff series with 3 consecutive 40+-point games since Michael Jordan did so with The Shot in the 1989 NBA playoffs.[216] Brunson opened the second round of the playoffs against the Indiana Pacers with 43 points and 6 assists, becoming the 4th player in NBA history and first since Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals to score 40+ in four consecutive playoff games and the first ever to do so with 5+ assists in each of the four playoff games. He also became the first Knick to post five consecutive 30+ point/5+ assist games.[217][218] In Game 5, he scored 44 points in the game, including 28 in the first half to set a Knicks record for points scored in a playoff half.[219] In Game 7, Brunson fractured his left hand, as the Knicks were eliminated in seven games; shortly after, he underwent surgery to repair his broken hand.[220][221]\n\nBrunson is known for having elite footwork, but not elite athleticism.[222] Brunson describes himself as a \"hustle player\".[223] Brunson draws a high number of offensive fouls. This includes charging fouls as well as non-charging fouls such as \"illegal screens, pushoffs and other forms of induction\". This is a result of a style of play that evolved out of necessity due his being equipped with strength and agility, but not the height, length or verticality to differentiate himself off the ground.[224]\n\nOn May 5, 2014, USA Basketball announced the 21 athletes (including Brunson) invited to try out from June 10 to 19 for the 12-member USA national team for the June 20–24, 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship.[225] Eventually, 24 players tried out for the team and the roster was cut to 15 on June 12.[226] Brunson made the final 12-man roster that was announced on June 15.[227] In the opening game, Brunson surpassed Stephon Marbury's 12 assists against Brazil in the 1994 FIBA Americas U18 Championship by recording 13 against Uruguay to set a new USA Basketball U18 single-game assist record.[228][229] The United States claimed a gold medal in the tournament.[230] On August 16, Brunson was named to the Nike Global Challenge USA All-Tournament team along with Stephen Zimmerman, D. J. Hogg, Malik Monk, Jaylen Brown and Bam Adebayo.[231][232] Brunson led the Midwest team to a third-place finish in the eight-team tournament.[28]\n\nOn June 18, 2015, Brunson was announced as a member of the 12-man 2015 USA Basketball Men's U19 World Cup Team for the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Cup.[233] Brunson earned MVP of the tournament, after leading the team with 5.6 assists and 2.1 steals for the tournament. He posted a game-high 30 points in the semi-finals against Greece,[234] and he tallied a team-high 14 points including six in overtime as well as seven assists, five rebounds and a steal in the gold medal game against Croatia. Brunson tied teammate Harry Giles, with a 14.0 average for the tournament.[235][236] He dominated in the final two games.[237] Based on this performance, he was recognized as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, on December 21.[238]\n\nBrunson was one of the first commitments to Team USA for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, according to a June 4, 2023 tweet from Marc Stein,[239] that was referenced by CBS Sports.[240] The roster was finalized by July 3,[241] with a relatively inexperienced squad.[242] Team USA finished fourth in the tournament but finished high enough (top 2 in the Americas) to secure a 2024 Olympic Games invitation.[243]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2018–19 Dallas 73 38 21.8 .467 .348 .725 2.3 3.2 .5 .1 9.3 2019–20 Dallas 57 16 17.9 .466 .358 .813 2.4 3.3 .4 .1 8.2 2020–21 Dallas 68 12 25.0 .523 .405 .795 3.4 3.5 .5 .0 12.6 2021–22 Dallas 79 61 31.9 .502 .373 .840 3.9 4.8 .8 .0 16.3 2022–23 New York 68 68 35.0 .491 .416 .829 3.5 6.2 .9 .2 24.0 2023–24 New York 77 77 35.4 .479 .401 .847 3.6 6.7 .9 .2 28.7 Career 422 272 28.3 .489 .391 .824 3.2 4.7 .7 .1 16.9 All-Star 1 0 17.3 .417 .222 — 4.0 5.0 1.0 .0 12.0\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2021 Dallas 7 0 16.3 .455 .462 .749 2.6 1.4 .0 .0 8.0 2022 Dallas 18 18 35.0 .466 .347 .800 4.6 3.7 .8 .1 21.6 2023 New York 11 11 40.3 .474 .325 .912 4.9 5.6 1.5 .1 27.8 2024 New York 13 13 39.8 .444 .310 .775 3.3 7.5 .8 .2 32.4 Career 49 42 34.8 .459 .333 .814 4.0 4.8 .8 .1 23.9\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2015–16 Villanova 40 39 24.0 .452 .383 .774 1.8 2.5 .7 .0 9.6 2016–17 Villanova 36 36 31.1 .541 .378 .876 2.6 4.1 .9 .0 14.7 2017–18 Villanova 40 40 31.8 .521 .408 .802 3.1 4.6 .9 .0 18.9 Career 116 115 28.9 .510 .393 .820 2.5 3.7 .8 .0 14.4\n\nMost single-game three-point shots without a miss (9, tied)\n\nMost single-half three-point shots without a miss (8)\n\nConsecutive playoff games with 40+ points/5+ assists (4)\n\nSingle-season 30-point games (36, tied)\n\nSingle-season 30-point point/assist double-doubles (6)\n\nSingle-game playoff points (47, April 28, 2024)\n\nSingle-half playoff points (28, May 14, 2024)\n\nCareer playoff 20-point halves (12 through 2024 playoffs)\n\nFirst playoff 40-point point/assist double-double (April 28, 2024)\n\nConsecutive playoff 30-point point/assist double-doubles (2, April 25 & 28, 2024)\n\nConsecutive playoff 30-point/5-assist games (5)\n\nConsecutive 20-point playoff games (20)\n\nOn September 21, 2022, Brunson announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend Ali Marks, whom he met in high school.
