Veteran shooting guard Jason Terry has found a new team for the 2016-17 campaign.

The Milwaukee Bucks announced they signed Terry on Monday.

General manager John Hammond spoke about the signing:

Jason is a true professional who understands what it takes to be successful in this league. He’ll be an invaluable resource for our young group as we continue to develop into a championship-caliber team on and off the court, and he’s still one of the best shooters in the game who can help stretch the floor for us. We’re thrilled to welcome him to Milwaukee.

"They are a young team on the cusp of doing great things, and the Bucks have a great coach in Jason Kidd," Terry told Marc Berman of Fox 26 on Friday.

On Thursday, Marc Stein of ESPN.com reported the Bucks were "in advanced discussions to sign Jason Terry to bolster their backcourt and add a veteran presence."

Terry had been in search of a new team since he told Justin Termine of SiriusXM NBA Radio on July 20 that the Houston Rockets would not bring him back after his second season with the team. While Terry appeared in 72 contests for Houston in 2015-16, he started only seven and averaged 5.9 points per game.

Terry, who will be 39 years old during the 2016-17 campaign, has played for the Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets and Rockets since entering the league as the No. 10 overall pick in 1999. He has scored 14.3 points per game in his career behind 37.9 percent shooting from three-point range.

However, he hasn’t been the same offensive force in the later seasons of his career as he was for the Hawks and Mavericks during his prime.

While he isn’t the same player he once was, the 2008-09 Sixth Man of the Year gives the Bucks a playoff-tested veteran. He has 115 postseason games on his resume and helped the Mavericks capture the 2010-11 NBA title against LeBron James and the Miami Heat.

He has recorded a solid 15 points per night in those playoff contests and was especially impressive alongside Dirk Nowitzki in 2010-11, posting 17.5 points per game behind 44.2 percent shooting from three-point range in the 2011 postseason and tallying 27 points in Dallas’ Game 6 NBA Finals-clinching victory over Miami behind a blistering 11-of-16 from the field.

If nothing else, Terry can provide experience and leadership for a squad that will be looking to make a deep postseason run in 2016-17. If he can mentor some of the younger players such as Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who are both 21, and draw on his playoff success, this would be a successful signing for Milwaukee.

Before the Rockets told Terry they would not bring him back, he did say, “I want to play two more years and then jump immediately into coaching or management,” per Matt Martinez of the Star-Telegram.
