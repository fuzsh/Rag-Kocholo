BOSTON - Jason Terry scored Boston's last nine points and the Celtics weathered a strong comeback by the New York Knicks, avoiding a sweep with a 97-90 overtime win on Sunday.

Paul Pierce led the Celtics with 29 points as they forced a fifth game in the series, but it was Terry who provided the finishing touches.

In Game 3, he had been elbowed by J.R. Smith, and the NBA suspended the Knicks guard for Sunday's game.

New York had tied the game 84-84 after trailing by 20 points early in the third quarter.

SPURS 103, LAKERS 82

In Los Angeles, Tony Parker scored 23 points, and San Antonio completed afirst-round sweep of the injury-plagued Lakers

Tim Duncan had 11 points and six rebounds for the second-seeded Spurs, who will face the winner of Denver's series with Golden State in the second round. They'll get plenty of rest after flattening the Lakers, who finished without three regular starters in their first opening-round exit since 2007.

HEAT 88, BUCKS 77

In Milwaukee, LeBron James scored 30, Ray Allen had another big game against his old team and Miami advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals after closing out a sweep of the Bucks.

It's the first time the Heat have swept a playoff series since James and Chris Bosh joined Dwyane Wade in Miami three years ago.

Wade sat out the game with three bone bruises on his right knee.

The Heat will face the winner of the Brooklyn Nets-Chicago Bulls series.
