        "text": "A lot of us saw our favorite NFL quarterback retire this week. And among the \"us\" is an NFL quarterback.\n\nI chatted a while Wednesday with Philip Rivers, the San Diego Chargers quarterback, Decatur native, former Athens High star -- and new father. Recently, wife Tiffany gave birth to Philip Gunner Rivers, giving Philip some male company in a household that also includes three daughters.\n\nBrett Favre was Philip's favorite quarterback. Here's what he had to say about Favre:\n\n\"I don't know if I know any more more than anybody else knows other than seeing him, you see all the clips, all the sound bites, you think, 'Is he having all that much fun?' I've watched him in a preseason game and a regular season game. This year, we played them in Green Bay. You can't help but watch the guy. I'm obviously pulling for our defense, but you watch him. It's every play, every game. That's truly him.\n\n\"As long as I've watched the NFL, I've been watching Brett Favre. I was eight or nine when he started playing and I wasn't watching the NFL much befofre that. It'll be different without him being out there.\n\n\"As a quarterback, I looked up to a bunch of guys, (Dan) Marino and a bunch of guys, but (Favre) is probably my all-time favorite. If somebody said you've got to pick one, he'd be the guy. For a bunch of reasons. Just his whole ability to make a play like he's in the back yard. He has so much fun doing it.\n\n\"I think, too, the fact he played in (275) straight games tells a lot about him. He's going to be out there. He's going to find a way to play. He's had a lot of things personal, with his dad (dying) and all that. He's going to be out there.\""
