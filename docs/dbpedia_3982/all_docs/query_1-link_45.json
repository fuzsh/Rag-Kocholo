        "text": "When Philip Rivers got a call from the Chargers office last January that a 7-year-old boy in an L.A. hospital was terminally ill and wanted to meet the Chargers quarterback, he dropped everything, got in his car and drove there.\n\nOne of the Chargers front office staff said that is just the kind of guy he is.\n\nFamily and kids are paramount to the father of six as evidenced by his multifaceted Rivers of Hope Foundation. It matches foster children to potential parents through its Heart Gallery of photos, grants a foster kid’s wish, say, for a musical instrument, prom dress or class ring, through its Something Special Fund, and recognizes foster children’s birthdays. Rivers also runs a football camp, sponsors a 5K Fun Run and partnered with Quentin Jammer to build an athletic field serving foster teens.\n\nQ: In 2010, you and your wife Tiffany started Rivers of Hope. Why?\n\nA: We were on a drive home from Disneyland with the kids and we felt it was God calling us to help those kids that don’t have all those things (our kids have) through no fault of their own. I didn’t know then the vast number of foster children in San Diego. But, as you get to meet some of these kids and see a 6-year-old who has gone from group home to group home and a 10-year-old who has had to change school every three or four months, you realize, if you can help just one child, it’s worth it. That’s how it came about.\n\nQ: Have your efforts paid off? How many kids have you gotten adopted?\n\nA: It’s been way beyond. It’s hard to quantify exactly, but it’s well into the double digits. Under Heart Gallery on our website, it’s heartwarming to click the link and find “family found” under a child’s photo. It’s the ultimate goal to give these kids that forever family. But there are so many other things, like “Something Special” and the “Birthday Club” that let them know someone loves them, and it gives them hope. It’s truly a community effort.\n\nQ: Did any one thing in your own life trigger this commitment?\n\nA: No, it was all things I took for granted: mom and dad tucking me in, sitting around the supper table together, playing in the yard. I thought that’s what every kid does, but that’s not the case.\n\nQ: You meet so many children who need homes, have you been so moved that you wanted to adopt one of them?\n\nA: Not so much to point of real consideration but after a photo shoot or a ballgame or visit to SeaWorld, many times I’ve come home and said I really want him, or I want her. So, in that respect, we’ve talked about it, and that’s an option.\n\nQ: You and your wife have six children. Do you plan to have more?\n\nA: God willing. We will if God gives them to us.\n\nQ: When Make-a-Wish Foundation asked you to visit the 7-year-old boy in Los Angeles, did you hesitate?\n\nA: They didn’t know if he was going to live a couple more days. There was no decision to be made. I just drove up. To think, one of his last wishes is to meet me, of all things. We sat and talked. We played catch from two feet away in a chair. It was impactful for me just to see him smile for a day, he’d been through so much. … A couple of months later he passed away.\n\nQ: As a sports figure, do you feel an obligation to give back?\n\nA: I do. But I see it as a privilege. It’s a short window of time when you are in the news and have the platform. It’s a responsibility I take very seriously.\n\nQ: How do you feel about being thrust into the spotlight off the field?\n\nA: It’s always humbling that people are so excited to see you. I really am just a regular guy. I was just changing a dirty diaper and doing all the things everybody else does. I’m really a homebody. I’m not out and about a ton, but I try my hardest to be approachable. I know that one time may be the only meeting people have an interaction with you, and it’s something they’ll always remember.\n\nQ: What’s next for Rivers of Hope? Are other projects on your plate?\n\nA: I have a vision of one day having housing for kids that age out of the system. They don’t have a home. They don’t have anywhere to go. They don’t know how to get a place. They don’t know how to set up bank account. We need to figure out how to set it up.\n\nQ: Who are your greatest mentors?\n\nA: Probably my mom and dad. My dad was my high school football coach. So I learned a great deal of character traits you want to have: discipline, hard work, passion, commitment, how to treat people, how to lead. All these things I learned from watching him coach. My mom was there as well every step of the way and had a huge impact.\n\nQ: Tell me about your wife?\n\nA: Tiffany is my best buddy. We met when I was in eighth grade and she was in seventh. We were at a ball field and I remember pointing her out to my mom and my phrase was, “That’s a good girl.” We were married when I was 19 and she was 18. She’s the unsung hero behind the scenes in every area of my life.\n\nQ: Do you have a guiding philosophy?\n\nA: Faith, family and football. Although I have a passion for football, it comes in third. My dad always said if you’re going to do something, do it all the way, do it right. If you’re going to mow the grass, keep the lines straight, dump the bag. … If you’re going to make the bed, tuck in the corners. That really applies to every facet of your life. Do it right.\n\nQ: Who do you most admire in the philanthropic arena?"
