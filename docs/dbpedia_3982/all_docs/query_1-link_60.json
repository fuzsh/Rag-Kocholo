        "text": "Philip Rivers, the eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback for the Chargers, ranks sixth all-time in passing touchdowns. The fourth overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft, Rivers has thrown for over 4,000 pass yards in 10 of the last 11 seasons. With only three losing seasons in 14 years as a starting QB, the 6-foot-5, 228-pound Rivers is considered among the best QBs to never win a Super Bowl. Born in Decatur, Alabama in 1981, the loquacious, southern-accented Rivers – who’s been known to wear rattlesnake boots and a bolo tie – is one of the most indestructible football players ever, having started over 200 consecutive games."
