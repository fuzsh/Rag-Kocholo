        "text": "Philip Rivers can finally field his own football team using just his children, all 10 of them.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback and his wife, Tiffany Rivers, recently welcomed child No. 10 on Oct. 30, a baby boy named Andrew Joseph Rivers. Rivers isn't quite caught up to Antonio Cromartie, who has 14 kids, but he's close to earning the title for the NFL's best-swimming sperm.\n\nLet's meet the woman responsible for carrying all these babies throughout the years.\n\nPhilip Met Tiffany in Middle School\n\nRELATED: Antonio Cromartie Has Enough Kids to Field a Football Team\n\nRivers and his wife, Tiffany, married in 2001 after his freshman year at North Carolina State University, a few years before he turned professional.\n\nThey were more than high school sweethearts, having reportedly met all the way back in middle school when she went by Tiffany Goodwin. He's from Decatur, Ala., and attended Decatur High School. What's far more impressive is that the Rivers' clan is made up of 12 people.\n\nIn other words, Philip and Tiffany have had 10 children together.\n\n\"We've had one pretty much every two years and now this is the longest gap,\" Rivers told AL.com in July 2023. \"We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy. Even our girls wanted a boy.\"\n\nAndrew Rivers was born in October, making this clan a complete football team.\n\nRivers is currently a high school football coach at St. Michael Catholic in Fairhope, Ala., where his oldest son, Gunner Rivers, is the starting quarterback. Gunner has lots to live up to considering his father played 17 seasons, being named to eight Pro Bowls and becoming the Chargers' all-time passing leader, posting 59,271 yards across 228 games.\n\nGunner will also have plenty of family members rooting for him.\n\nThe Rivers Family is Mostly Girls\n\nOf their 10 children, seven are girls; Halle, Caroline, Grace, Sarah, Rebecca, Clare and their ninth child, Anna. Additionally, Philip and Tiffany Rivers have three sons; Gunner, Peter and now Andrew. Imagine being on school pick-up duty for that family.\n\nThe couple was still in college when they brought their first child into the world. Halle was born in 2002 and the couple didn't slow down.\n\nThe Rivers family is extremely close-knit, and was even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThey lived in San Diego before a stop in Indianapolis and now Alabama. The Rivers' are a practicing Catholic family, something the former NC State star and NFL quarterback values dearly.\n\n\"He always wants to be with us,\" then-10-year-old Gunner told Chargers.com in 2019. \"Whenever he's home, he plays with us and he's with us all the time. Wherever we go out - we go all kinds of places - random people just come up and ask for his autograph and for pictures. It's cool. But he's always there for us. But when he's home, we like to throw the football in the yard. We like to putt on the putting green, watch football and do things like that.\"\n\nTiffany Rivers operates a swimwear line called Hermoza, which was co-founded with Marisa De Lecce. Philip and Tiffany also founded Rivers of Hope, a foundation aiming to find orphanages for children under the age of 12.\n\nRivers, who ranks sixth in NFL history for touchdown passes thrown, never made it to the Super Bowl. His career playing AFC and NFC opponents may be done, but at least he can field his own Rivers offense."
