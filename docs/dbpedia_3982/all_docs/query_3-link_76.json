        "text": "You guys. Do you remember the post I did about Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers‚Äô baby #8, due soon? I ended by saying if anyone knows Philip or his wife Tiffany and wanted to pass on the post, I would be delighted? Well our lovely reader skimac was actually able to pass it on to them, and Tiffany wrote back.\n\nTiffany wrote back!!!!!!\n\n((Trying not to squeal with excitement.))\n\n(Maybe I squealed just a little. üôÇ )\n\nI‚Äôm still blown away that (1) she read the post and (2) took the time (very near her due date!) to respond and (3) her response was just so beautiful! I know you‚Äôll all love it! It was left here as a comment by a friend of her mother-in-law‚Äôs, but I wanted to post it so you‚Äôd all have a chance to read it:\n\nHalle Elizabeth- Philip and I just loved the name Halle and when I was in mass while pregnant with her I noticed the song we were singing had Hallelujah in it and I took it as a sign üôÇ\n\nElizabeth is Philips mom‚Äôs middle name and two of my favorite saints. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and St Elizabeth Anne Seton. Although at the time I think we were just naming her after her grandmother üôÇ\n\nCaroline Leigh- we loved the name and her god mother‚Äôs name is Leigh Anne\n\nGrace Marilyn- because I was in awe of Gods grace and his love for me. Marilyn- after Mary and my mom‚Äôs middle name\n\nPhilip Gunner- Philip obviously after his dad üôÇ and Gunner is Philips mom‚Äôs maiden name. Her parents had 9 children and passed down the Catholic faith in a very Protestant part of the world.\n\nSarah Katherine- Philip picked Sarah, he loved the name and I love Old Testament names üôÇ Katherine after my grandmother and st Katherine Drexel\n\nPeter Michael- Peter is my brothers name, but we most of all love it because we both have a heart for the Protestants coming home to our faith and Peter symbolizes that for us‚Ä¶ The rock\n\nMichael- Philips middle name and the name of the one who has done much battle for us and all God‚Äôs children (St Michael the archangel )\n\nRebecca Marie- another Old Testament name we both loved. Marie after our mother Mary.\n\nWe are awaiting our next blessing, and plan on naming her Clare Magdalene (or Magdalen) not sure about the spelling, maybe you could help me decide üôÇ\n\nWith all the opinions we have here in our house now, we finally came up with one everyone likes. And will name her after St Clare of Assisi. Magdalene because it reminds me again of God‚Äôs grace and no matter how far we fall from God he is always our Father and wants us home! Plus love that fact that she (Mary Magdalene) was at the cross.\n\nThanks for writing such a nice blog post about Philip üôÇ and you never know we may have to talk about some of your name suggestions- we have been known to change names last minute!!\n\nIn Christ,\n\nTiffany\n\nHow exquisitely beautiful are the reasons behind all these choices?! I love each and every one of them. I had my husband read it, and he ‚Äî a convert himself ‚Äî was so impressed by how Tiffany said they ‚Äúboth have a heart for the Protestants coming home to our faith.‚Äù Along that same line, I also loved the use of Philip‚Äôs mom‚Äôs maiden name, Gunner, because her ‚Äúparents had 9 children and passed down the Catholic faith in a very Protestant part of the world.‚Äù Beautiful.\n\nAnd now I think I‚Äôve used up my quota of how many times I can say ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in one post!\n\nI just have to point out one more thing ‚Äî ‚ÄúHalle‚Äù is contained within ‚ÄúHallelujah‚Äù!! I put that right up there in Master Class naming, I am very impressed with that! And like my sister-in-law said when she read it, now I have a new name to suggest!\n\n(Also, I was totally way off about the Scandinavian influence I thought was revealed by Halle and Gunner. I love the real reasons so much more!)\n\nPlease say a prayer for Tiffany and her baby girl as the birth nears, asking especially for St. Anne‚Äôs intercession! I‚Äôll be sure to post when I find out that the baby‚Äôs been born, and in the meantime ‚Äî what would you suggest regarding the spelling of Magdalene or Magdalen? (My response, which I‚Äôd posted as a comment, was: ‚Äúthis is one instance where I don‚Äôt have much of a preference; I quite like both Magdalene and Magdalen. Mayyybe I‚Äôd tip toward Magdalene, just because that‚Äôs what I see most often when St. Mary Magdalene is written out, but really, I think either spelling quite obviously points out which saint they‚Äôre referring to.‚Äù)\n\nUpdated to add: I forgot to say! The choice of name for their new baby isn‚Äôt one I suggested (though I did reference Magdalene in my suggestion of Lena), but I love love love their plan of Clare Magdalen(e) for their new little one ‚Äî saintly, elegant, just wonderful!"
