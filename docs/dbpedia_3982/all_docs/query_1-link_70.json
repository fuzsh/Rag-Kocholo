        "text": "Former Los Angeles (San Diego) Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers had himself a very solid NFL career. He was loved by the Chargers fans and helped take the team to new heights during his time with the Bolts.\n\nRivers spent all but one year of his career with the Chargers and set all sorts of records during it. He was an eight-time Pro-Bowler in his career and holds countless Chargers franchise records.\n\nHe was the passing leader in the NFL in 2010, the passing rating leader in 2008, and the NFL completion percentage leader in 2013 among other accomplishments. But none compare to his most recent accomplishment that he did during his retirement.\n\nRivers and his wife recently announced that they were welcoming their 10th child into the world. It has long been a running joke that Rivers could field an offense with the amount of kids that he has, and now he technically can do so.\n\nThe new babyâ€™s name is Tiffany, and they are overjoyed about having her. Rivers spoke about his new daughter, and you could tell how happy he was.\n\n\"It's awesome. Tiffany is awesome,\" Rivers said. \"It doesn't matter if it's the first child or the 10th child. It's an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.\"\n\nPer Francisco Rosa of Bleacher Report\n\nSince retiring, Rivers has spent time working as the head coach for St. Michael Catholic High School in Alabama. His oldest son, Gunner, is the starting quarterback there.\n\nHe hasn't been able to stay away from the game of football, and rightfully so. It's been his passion his entire life, and it's great to see him still a part of the game."
