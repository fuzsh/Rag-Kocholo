        "text": "COSTA MESA — Philip Rivers didn’t agree Wednesday that he’s having a poor season or that he’s on the decline because his 38th birthday is coming up.\n\nRivers isn’t in denial of his recent poor play. He just wanted to minimize the sample size, and provide reminders of season highs, like the dominant victory against the Green Bay Packers and the overtime winning-drive versus the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nInstead of calling it a tough season, Rivers referred to it as a tough two-game stretch with a combined seven interceptions in losses to the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n“It’s been a tough two-game stretch, I would not say a tough year of turnovers,” Rivers told reporters at his weekly news conference. “A tough two-game stretch. Really, unlike any two games I can remember having back-to-back.”\n\nThe last sentence of that quote is why talk of Rivers’ demise continues to build with every interception and loss this season. Rivers is making mistakes he’s never made in his decorated 16-year career, and admitting to it. His 14 interceptions this season rank second worst in the NFL behind Tampa Bay’s Jameis Winston with 20, and his 85.5 quarterback rating ranks 25th in the league.\n\nAfter the loss to the Raiders, Rivers couldn’t believe he overthrew wide receiver Keenan Allen on a in-route that led to an interception on the opening drive.\n\n“I really don’t know that I’ve ever missed that throw like that, ever,” Rivers said on Nov. 14.\n\nNow, it’s gone from a bad throw to a bad two-game stretch. Rivers is known for taking high-risk, high-reward chances down the field, but he’s never thrown seven or more interceptions in a two-game span until this month.\n\nBut Rivers won’t entertain the idea that he’s on the decline because of recent poor play and age. Rivers, who turns 38 on Dec. 8, is aware of the criticism, but he doesn’t pay attention to it.\n\n“I don’t necessarily try to seek it out, but I’m also not naive to it or ignore it completely,” Rivers said about the doubters. “I understand it. I know it comes with it. It’s not one of those things that I’m looking for extra motivation or, ‘I’ll show them,’ or, ‘I can’t believe they think that.’ I get it. If I was in that locker room, I’d be upset with me, too, for some of those things. That just comes with it. That comes with the position. I understand that.\n\n“Again, I’m disappointed that I haven’t made some of the plays that I need to. I’ve also made some plays that helped us be in these games, too. It goes both ways. I’m not trying to sell that I’ve played well. I have not played well. The turnovers are unacceptable, but there’s no lost confidence, no lost belief in myself. I don’t even entertain (that).”\n\nWith Rivers throwing interceptions at a high rate, Chargers coach Anthony Lynn continues to be asked about a potential quarterback change if Rivers doesn’t improve.\n\n“I don’t plan on having to make that decision,” Lynn said about benching Rivers. “I plan on us going and playing our tails off this weekend and getting back in that win column.\n\n“It’s not just one guy why we’re 4-7. Philip understands that we can’t keep turning the ball over. He understands that. … Everybody is being evaluated. Hell, if we don’t win enough games, I’m going to be (evaluated) — you’d be looking at another head coach here. It is what it is.”\n\nRivers said he laughs at talk about his decline. He’s third in the league in passing yards with 3,169 and has moved the offense behind an offensive line decimated by injuries.\n\nBut Rivers’ biggest issues have come in the red zone and with the game on the line. He has a league-leading four red-zone interceptions and a 73.8 passer rating in the fourth quarter, No. 28 in the NFL.\n\nThere are valid arguments on both sides of the recent Rivers conversations. But the Chargers’ long-time quarterback will agree to disagree with those who suggest he’s lost his touch.\n\nFor now, Rivers won’t discuss his future until after the season. He’s focused on finishing the final five games of the regular-season on a high note, but not because he wants to prove the naysayers wrong.\n\n“You saying it makes me laugh, really,” Rivers said about a potential decline. “If we finish that drive in Kansas City, the narrative is probably flipped and I played the same game.”"
