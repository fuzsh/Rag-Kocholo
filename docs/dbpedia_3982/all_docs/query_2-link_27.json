        "text": "Former NFL star quarterback Philip Rivers and wife Tiffany will welcome their 10th child in October.\n\nRivers, who retired from pro football in 2021 after 17 seasons, is now a high school football coach at St. Michael Catholic in Fairhope, Ala.\n\nRivers told AL.com at a 7-on-7 event in Daphne on Wednesday that the couple is expecting a boy this fall. Their other nine children range in age from 4 to 21.\n\n“We’ve had one pretty much every two years and now this is the longest gap,” Rivers said. “We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy. Even our girls wanted a boy.”\n\nThe Rivers currently have seven girls and two boys. Philip’s oldest son, Gunner, will be the starting quarterback for St. Michael this season.\n\nRivers said his mother comes from a family of nine children and her father also comes from a family of nine.\n\n“We thought we would be the third generation of nine, but we decided to go double digits – or I should say we didn’t decide it. God decided,” he said.\n\nRivers said the couple doesn’t have a name picked out yet.\n\n“We are still kind of figuring that out,” he said. “We have plenty of opinions. That is what we’ve got right now.”\n\nRivers will open his third season as the coach at St. Michael next month. The Cardinals will play a jamboree game at Spanish Fort on Aug. 17 and then open the season at Gulf Shores on Aug. 24. Rivers is 11-8 in his first two seasons as a head coach. His dad, Steve, also was a longtime high school coach.\n\nSt. Michael had won just five games total since starting football in 2017 until Rivers took over.\n\nRivers passed for more than 63,000 yards in his NFL career, which ranks sixth in NFL history. The eight-time pro bowl selection earned more than $243 million in a career that started with the Chargers in 2004 and finished with one season as the Colts QB in 2020.\n\nHe said his entire family was “excited and ultimately just thankful” to welcome another child.\n\n“I think what tells the story for us is the reaction of the other children, and how excited they are,” he said. “They are fired up.”"
