        "text": "The NFLPA grades each team based on surveys that are sent out to all the players and the Los Angeles Chargers scored a failing grade in a category that sent social media ablaze.\n\nFamily and Childcare.\n\nSome teams provide childcare free and onsite but not the Chargers. They provide it offsite and charge $75 for the first kid and $50 for each additional child.\n\nUpon seeing the failing grade, fans took a stroll down memory lane. Philip Rivers played 17 NFL seasons, mostly with the Chargers, and has 10 children.\n\nPerhaps the Chargers started charging because of the Rivers family?\n\nCheck out some of the jokes from football fans:\n\nFortunately, Rivers is retired and doesn't need to pay his employer for this insane amount per game in childcare and maybe the organization will rethink how they treat their players' families after seeing these results."
