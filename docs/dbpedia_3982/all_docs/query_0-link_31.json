        "text": "Philip River is a former quarterback in the National Football League for 17 years and he primarily played for the Chargers franchise, formerly in San Diego and now in Los Angeles. Despite not winning a Super Bowl in his career, he is one of the most accomplished football players there is — both in college and the pros. He led the NFL in passing stats for multiple years and he was named to the Pro Bowl 8 times. He is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks that have never played in the Super Bowl. In this article, we will be talking about Philip Rivers’ net worth in 2022.\n\nNet Worth$80 millionAge40Salary$25 million (2020-2021 season)SponsorsAdvoCare, Bose, Papa John's, DirecTVSportAmerican Football\n\nPhilip Rivers’net worth in 2022 (estimate): $80 million\n\nPhilip Rivers’ net worth in 2022 is estimated to be at $80 million. This is agreed upon by multiple reputable sources such as Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nPhilip Michael Rivers was born on December 8, 1981, in Decatur, Alabama. His father, Steve, was the head coach of the football team of Decatur High School, while his mother, Joan, was a teacher.\n\nWhen he was in 5th grade, he had a project wherein he had to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations. He submitted a poster where he pasted his face over a Minnesota Vikings player that was on the cover of Sports Illustrated.\n\nHe started wearing his famous No. 17 jersey when he was in 9th grade to honor his father who wore the same number when he was in high school. He then transferred to Athens High School where he played football and his dad was also the head coach of the team.\n\nBy the time he was a senior, Philip Rivers had already established his status as the best prep passer in the state. He played for the Golden Eagles from 1996 to 1999 and he led the team to a 40-9 record during his stay. In his senior year, he passed for 2,023 yards and 15 touchdowns and he was named to the first-team 5A all-state as well as the Alabama Sports Writer Association’s 5A Back of the Year.\n\nTo honor his greatness during his high school playing years, the city of Athens renamed the street running by Athens High School as the Philip Rivers Drive.\n\nAfter high school, Philip Rivers received multiple offers to play college ball. He was recruited by Auburn and Alabama but both schools did not project him as a starting quarterback. Instead, he joined North Carolina State University.\n\nIn his freshman year, Rivers passed for 397 yards and 3 touchdowns in a double-overtime win against Arkansas State. He led the team to an 8-4 record and he finished the season with 3,054 passing yards and 25 touchdowns. Philip Rivers was named the 2000 ACC Rookie of the Year.\n\nRivers continued to be a focal point of NC State’s offense in the following years. In his senior year, he finished the season with 4,491 passing yards and 34 touchdowns in 12 games en route to being named the 2003 ACC Player of the Year and the 2004 ACC Athlete of the Year.\n\nHe started 51 straight games and had totals of 1,087 completions in 1,710 attempts for 13,484 yards and 95 touchdowns, as well as 96 rushing yards for 17 touchdowns in his four-year career with NC State. His No. 17 NC State Wolfpack jersey was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State.\n\nIn the 2004 NFL Draft, Philip Rivers was selected with the 4th overall pick by the New York Giants. However, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers for the 1st overall pick of the same draft, Eli Manning. Rivers was one of the 17 quarterbacks taken in that year’s draft, along with Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger. Their draft class is often compared to the 1983 NFL Draft which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks Jim Kelly, Dan Marino, and John Elway.\n\nPhilip Rivers signed a six-year $40.5 million contract with the Chargers. The deal included a $7.65 million signing bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, he only played a total of 2 games in his first 2 seasons in the NFL as Drew Brees was ahead of him on the depth chart — Brees had a career year in 2004 and was named to the Pro Bowl and was awarded the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.\n\nIn 2006, the Chargers did not re-sign Brees and instead named Rivers as their starting quarterback. Expectations were high for him as Manning and Roethlisberger shined as starters in their respective teams.\n\nHe exceeded expectations as he led the Chargers to an incredible 14-2 record as he had 284 completions in 460 attempts for a 61.7 completion rate and 3,388 yards to go along with 22 touchdowns. His performance earned him a Pro Bowl selection. Unfortunately, they lost to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.\n\nThe following year, the Chargers finished with 11 wins and 5 losses but they advanced to the AFC Championship Game to face the Patriots. They lost the game but Rivers received high praises from his teammates and the press as he played the entire game with a torn ACL, and it was ranked among the NFL’s Top 10 Gutsiest Performances.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, Rivers signed a six-year $91.8 million extension, with a $19.5 million signing bonus, with the Chargers. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,710 and he was named the quarterback of the 2010 NFL Alumni Player of the Year award, as well as the Associated Press 2010 MVP.\n\nBefore the 2015 season, he signed another contract extension, this time for $83.25 million for four years with a $22.5 million signing bonus. In 2017, the Chargers franchise moved to Los Angeles. On February 10, 2020, Philip Rivers and the Los Angeles Chargers mutually agreed that he would not be re-signed during free agency.\n\nOn March 21, 2020, he signed a one-year $25 million deal to join the Indianapolis Colts. He became their starting quarterback and he led the Colts to an 11-5 record that season. Unfortunately, they lost to the Buffalo Bills in the wildcard round.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Philip Rivers announced that he is retiring from the NFL after 17 fruitful seasons. He said that he plans to become the head coach of St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama.\n\n“It’s just time,” Rivers told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “It’s just right.”\n\n“What has helped me come to this (decision) is the growing desire to coach high school football,” he said. “That’s what I’ve always wanted to do. It’s been growing. I can’t wait.”\n\nPhilip Rivers’ Career Achievements:\n\n2008 NFL Passing Rate Leader\n\n2008 NFL Passing Touchdowns Co-Leader\n\n2010 NFL Passing Yards Leader\n\n2013 NFL Comeback Player of the Year\n\n8x Pro Bowl Selection\n\nMember of the San Diego Chargers 50thAnniversary Team\n\nHe finished his career with 244 games played, 5,277 completions in 8,134 attempts, 63,440 passing yards, and 421 touchdowns.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, he earned a total of $243,944,322 in his 17-year career in the NFL.\n\nIn 2017, after the Chargers moved to Los Angeles, Philip Rivers was seen driving around a customized, specially-designed SUV and it was described as “its own living room”. It is reported that the vehicle cost him at least $200,000, plus additional fees for his hired driver.\n\nAs for his high school football coaching career, he won his first game as a head coach on August 26, 2021, when he led the St. Michael Catholic Cardinals to a dominant 49-0 victory.\n\nIt is a shame that he wasn’t able to win a Super Bowl in his long career. Nevertheless, Philip Rivers will undoubtedly go down as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. He will surely be a first-ballot Hall of Famer once he is eligible to be inducted.\n\nWith all of that being said, were you surprised about Philip Rivers’ net worth in 2022?"
