        "text": "Philip Rivers is a former All-Pro NFL quarterback. After being drafted in 2004 Rivers spent 14 seasons with the San Diego and Los Angeles Chargers. Rivers has made a name for himself as a five-time Pro-Bowl selection. He currently holds the records for most consecutive games with 400 yards passing and most touchdowns between a single quarterback and tight end with Antonio Gates.\n\nHis career passer rating is the fourth-best among NFL quarterbacks, with over 1500 passing attempts. He is currently ranked fourth for all-time consecutive starts by a quarterback in NFL history. While playing at North Carolina State University, Rivers set a NCAA record with 51 consecutive starts.\n\nAfter the departure of Drew Brees to the New Orleans Saints in 2006, Rivers came off of the bench to lead the Chargers to a 14-2 record. In 2007, the Chargers made their first playoff appearance since 1994, eventually making it to the AFC Championship game. Rivers has a total of 17 quarterback comebacks. He was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2013."
