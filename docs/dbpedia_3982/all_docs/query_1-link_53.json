        "text": "The San Diego Chargers QB turns 34 years old today! The man of many facial expressions signed a 4-year $84 million contract extension in the offseason to stay a Charger for his whole career.\n\nDespite the Chargers terrible 3-9 record, Rivers has had one of his best seasons of his career. He’s second in the NFL in passing yards with 3,713, tops in completions with 337 and fourth in yards per game with 309.\n\nHe’s broken numerous club and NFL records this season. On September 20 against the Cincinatti Bengals, Rivers threw his 255th career TD, passing Dan Fouts as the franchise leader in touchdown passes. A month later on October 18, Rivers set franchise records for passing yards (503), completions (43), and attempts (65) in a game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nHe’s a 5-time Pro Bowler, the 2013 Comeback Player of the Year, and he played the 2007 AFC Championship game without an ACL. He’s tough as nails and should be in the Hall of Fame one day.\n\nTo say Rivers is a family man is an understatment. He and his wife Tiffany welcomed their 8th kid, 6th daughter, on October 29.\n\nHow does that make you feel Philip?\n\nThank you Rivers for always wearing your heart on your sleeve, never backing down and always fighting for the San Diego Chargers. Happy Birthday!"
