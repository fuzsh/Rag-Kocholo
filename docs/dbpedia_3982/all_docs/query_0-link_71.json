        "text": "Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was putting in the work on Monday afternoon, sweating under the Lower Alabama sunshine in heavy air that was awaiting the birth of a Gulf disturbance.\n\nRivers grew up in Alabama and was an All-State quarterback at Athens High School, but after 15 NFL seasons in Southern California, a July afternoon in the other LA was a hot blast from the past.\n\nRivers held the first day of his quarterbacks and wide receivers camp at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope on Monday. He worked with 10- through 12-year-old youngsters. At 3:30 p.m. CDT Tuesday, he'll repeat the camp with 13- through 15-year-olds on the field.\n\n\"It's funny because this is all I knew growing up,\" Rivers said of the weather. \"It's about the same heat -- maybe not quite as hot in north Alabama. But being gone for so long, I found myself complaining about the heat: 'Golly, it's hot out here.' But this is all they know, too, so they're used to it. They'd be playing somewhere this afternoon I'm sure, too.\"\n\nRivers didn't know if an eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback or the chance to play football in July was the real attraction on Monday.\n\n\"Some of these kids, they may not know me or care,\" Rivers said, \"but I know if I was in Decatur, Alabama, and somebody came in and had a camp, I'd have been like, 'This is awesome. I want to go.'\"\n\nRivers said his objectives for the campers were a good experience and maybe a nugget or two of football knowledge.\n\n\"I don't teach them how to play quarterback in three hours,\" Rivers said, \"and there's a lot of different ways to teach somebody how to play quarterback. My way's not the only way, but it's the way I know. But I think maybe they learn a little bit about quarterback. Maybe they just have a good time. I think a three-hour camp, if it was in my hometown when I was 10, 11 and 12, I'd have been all over it. …\n\n\"If I had three hours and we had some organized drills and then we're going to play a little kind of a touch game that we've tweaked -- it's not real football, we call it Rivers' rules, kind of fastbreak basketball with a football, have a little fun. I was talking to my dad (Steve Rivers, a former high school coach) about it. I was like, 'We can't do drills for three hours.' He goes, 'No, I'd let them play. Have a little fun. Have a good experience.' And again, maybe they hear one thing about football, maybe they need a pat on the back, maybe they wanted to catch a pass, I don't know, but it's something that you can hopefully put a smile on their face for three hours.\"\n\nOne thing the campers will take away from the camp is the Latin phrase \"nunc coepi.\" It was printed on the back of every camper's T-shirt.\n\n\"I think in its exact terms is 'Now I begin,'\" Rivers said. \"We've kind of made it 'Now we begin.' We adopted that out at our team a few years ago, and if you ask any of my children what's Dad's favorite phrase, that would be it. It's because it's a never-ending beginning. You're always beginning again. You begin again, again and again, whether you have a good play or a bad play, good test grade or bad test grade.\n\n\"We kind of apply it to everything. Shoot, nunc coepi, that's kind of another way of saying, 'Let's go.' Begin again. I was trying to think of something different, and maybe they'll have to go google it. They can investigate it a little bit, and there's some good stuff there.\"\n\nSt. Michael played its first full season of varsity football in 2018. The Fairhope school seems a long way from home for Rivers, but he said he was happy to bring some attention to Baldwin County's only Catholic high school.\n\n\"Obviously, St. Michael's a young school that's just getting started,\" Rivers said. \"But I know a few people in the area, and then this particular school, not only athletically what I believe they're trying to grow to, but it really aligns with what I believe in spiritually and academically. It's a young school and again I know some people in the area and it's kind of worked out to be able to be here and give a little time. A couple of hours for me and I have as much fun as anybody out here, I think. Hopefully, they learn a little something, have a little fun and, hopefully, again help the school. …\n\n\"This young school again really lines up with everything our family believes in in all three of those areas I mentioned. It's like, 'Shoot, I can give three hours.' We spend a lot of time on the Gulf this time of year, so it makes it easy to get over here before training camp.\n\n\"I'm already getting the itch to go to camp.\"\n\nYoungsters 13- through 15-year-olds can register online for Tuesday’s camp. The cost is $20.\n\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE"
