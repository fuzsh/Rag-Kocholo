        "text": "Let’s face it last summer was a bust due to a national pandemic. However, THIS SUMMER is going to be so much fun, I can feel it.\n\nI was out over the weekend, and the bartender said, “Summer in Tuscaloosa is when you experience the true Tuscaloosa and locals.” I’m here for it because, as the Tik Tok videos go, “the streets are calling are calling my name.”\n\nIf you have been following me, you already know I am always down for a new adventure. Last-minute road trips are my thing. I always keep two pop chairs, a beach umbrella, sunscreen, a change of clothes, and water in my Prius because you never know when an adventure will strike.\n\nHere are some most-loved places in Tuscaloosa that you should revisit or, for some, try for the very first time.\n\nLet’s talk food and drinks\n\nA must is grabbing a coffee and a sweet treat at Babe’s Doughnuts.\n\nBreakfast at the Historic Waysider Café is a mandatory Tuscaloosa rite of passage.\n\nLooking for a great spot for lunch, be sure to check out Central Mesa. The brisket quesadilla is the go-to for me.\n\nDinner at Dreamland BBQ is enjoying a part of Tuscaloosa history.\n\nGrab a craft beer from Black Warrior Brewing Company. Sit outside and check out the locals.\n\nHop over to R&R Cigars and take in some Tuscaloosa vibes.\n\nAn evening cocktail at Session Cocktails is a great way to end the day.\n\nExploring the Tuscaloosa Outdoors\n\nEnjoy the views while taking a stroll at the Riverwalk\n\nThe Farmer’s Market at Tuscaloosa River Market is great for picking up fresh fruits, vegetables, and people watching.\n\nLook ahead at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater concert schedule. I believe it’s one of the best outdoor venues in the state.\n\nGrab lunch and head to Capitol Park for a relaxing afternoon.\n\nPaddleboard at Lake Nicol Park with Tuscaloosa Paddleboards\n\nExplore the campus of the University of Alabama. Be sure to take a picture by Tuska.\n\nGolfing at Ol’ Colony Golf Complex is always a fun outing.\n\nEnjoy time spent at Tuscaloosa Attractions\n\nFootball fan or not, the Paul W. Bryant Museum is a wonderful experience.\n\nChildren’s Hands-On Museum has tons to offer all ages.\n\nAlabama Museum of Natural History is filled with amazement.\n\nThe Old Tavern Museum is packed with history.\n\nGain some knowledge from Murphy-Collins House and African-American Museum.\n\nCheck out the beauty of the Jemison-Van de Graaff Mansion.\n\nI hope you enjoy experiencing Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with these most loved places."
