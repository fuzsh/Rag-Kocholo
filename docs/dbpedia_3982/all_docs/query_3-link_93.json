        "text": "Philip Rivers has not ruled out coming back to the NFL\n\nThe retired, former Indianapolis Colts QB, now High school football coach, Philip Rivers has “not ruled out” coming back to the NFL.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nThe recently-retired QB told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that he hasn’t shut the door on returning to the NFL. Which seems to be of ironic timing in light of his former team, the Colts, losing starting quarterback Carson Wentz to a foot injury for up to 12 weeks. He currently sits fifth all-time with 63,440 yards passing and 421 touchdown passes. For deeper SuperFlex dynasty leagues it could be worth stashing him in case this where to flourish into something more. Whether you do so or not, this is one to keep an eye on."
