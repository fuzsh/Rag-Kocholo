        "text": "At 37 years old, Philip Rivers is coming off one of his best seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, leading the team to a 12-4 record, as well as an appearance in the AFC Divisional round. While the team eventually lost to the New England Patriots, 41-28, it's clear the Rivers can still play high-level football. Rivers is entering the last year of his contract, a 4 year $83.5 million deal he signed back in 2015.\n\nWhen the contract was signed, team owner Tom Telesco said he wanted Rivers to be a member of the Chargers for the rest of his career, according to ESPN. Now, Telesco is echoing that same sentiment now that Rivers will be looking for a new contract.\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\n\"I can tell you he's not going anywhere, so he's going to be here,\" Telesco said. \"We'll talk at the right point, as far as the moves we need to make in the offseason, the resources we have and how it all fits in. But yeah, he's not going anywhere.\"\n\nDespite his age, Rivers believes he still has some good years left and that he can still lead the team to some good seasons. He even wants to be with the team when they open their new stadium in 2020.\n\n\"I certainly feel that's something I want to be a part of and hopefully be helping us still winning football games,\" Rivers explained."
