        "text": "Pumpkin Carving Contests are the absolute best, aren't they? It really lets the creativity in your mind shine. It's times like this during the spooky season I wish I had the artistic ability.\n\nI always remember drawing the face, pulling out the seeds, and wondering what the orange goop on my hands was...I miss those family times when I was younger.\n\nThe reason we bring this up is UA recently held a contest of the pumpkin carving variety and the top 3 certainly brought the creativity. Time to look at all three and appreciate the style.\n\nComing in 3rd we have:\n\nI mean, how can you not love a Big Al Pumpkin? He's even got a little bowtie and floppy ears! Major points for that.\n\nBut moving on, what could beat Big Al? Coming in 2nd is:\n\nAll we can about this one is WOW. The detail on this is insane.

Alright, enough talk, here's the winner:\n\nThis is...MAJESTIC. Paul speaks to me on an artistic and spiritual level. The little smile he has certainly breathes the aura of a winner. There is no debate here, this is was the correct call for first place.\n\nNow if I could only get my pumpkin decorating skills up..."
