        "text": "Personal Life\n\nPhillp Rivers was born on 8th December, 1981 in Decatur, Alabama. Rivers is the only child of Steve and Joan Phillips. Rivers grew up around football as a kid with his father being the head coach of he local Decatur High football team. During his high school football career at Athens High School, Rivers played in every single game and was never on the bench. This speaks volumes of his early talent as a young quarterback.\n\nRivers is currently married to Tiffany Rivers (2001) whom is his high school sweetheart.\n\nCollege Career\n\nRivers attended North Carolina State between 2000-2003 and his college career was nothing short of amazing. During his freshman year, he led the team as their quarterback to an 8-4 record. The 2000 season for NC State ended in a win at the Tangerine Bowl. His season stats this year ended with 25 touchdowns, 3,054 passing yards, and Freshman of the Year in the ACC.\n\nIn 2003, Rivers dominated the ACC and recorded his best season of stats in college. With 34 touchdowns and 4,491 passing yards, he became the most productive quarterback in the ACC. In 4 seasons, Rivers led his team to 3 Tangerine Bowl’s and NC State beat Kansas this year 56-26. Every single year Rivers won a bowl MVP award. This year Rivers was also awarded ACC Player of the Year award, and ACC Athlete of the Year.\n\nNFL Draft\n\nRivers’ collegiate career caught the eyes of many scouts giving him a great chance for being drafted amongst the pool of talented quarterbacks in 2004. At his combine session, Rivers recorded a 40 time of 5.08 seconds and a 33” vertical jump.\n\nDuring the 2004 draft, Rivers was projected to be a quick first-round draft pick due to his astounding college career. In a strategic move, the New York Giants and San Diego Chargers negotiated with each other for Rivers, Eli Manning, and a firs-round draft pick.\n\nNFL Career\n\nAs Rivers became a first-round draft pick for the Chargers, as a rookie he signed a substantial contract. His first contract included a six-year, $40.5 million salary and $14.5 million in signing bonuses. During his first two years, Rivers only played a total of four games as Drew Brees was the starting quarterback at the time. Honing his skills through practice, Rivers eventually became the leader of the team.\n\nIn 2006, Rivers became the starting quarterback and wasted no time making his presence known. Rivers recorded stats of 3,388 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and a 92.0 rating. During his first game as a starter against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rivers led the NFL with a 133.9 rating after completing 8 passes and one touchdown.\n\nIn 2007, Rivers led is team to the AFC Championship game and was a big deal for the Chargers overall. The last time the Chargers won a playoff game prior to this year was in 1994. Although they ended up losing to the Patriots in the 2007 AFC Championship game, this cemented Rivers as a franchise player.\n\nFrom 2006 forward, Rivers has played and started in every single game of the regular season. Each year Rivers recorded 3,100+ passing yards, 20+ touchdowns, and nothing less than an 82.4 quarterback rating. Feel free to checkout Rivers highlights from his 2015-2016 season.\n\nSocial Media\n\nRivers is a pretty reserved individual outside of football field, as he does not currently have any official accounts on Twitter, Instagram, or any social media outlet."
