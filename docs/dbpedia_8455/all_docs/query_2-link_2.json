        "text": "TEHRAN – The Zarangush canyon in Iran’s western Ilam province is considered as one of the least-known tourist attractions of the region.\n\nThe two-kilometer canyon hosts a river which flows during rain seasons.\n\nBeing over 500 meters high, it has 12 historical and natural sites, which make the canyon a significant national treasure.\n\nA few years ago, following a heavy flood in the canyon, pottery vessels from the Islamic Golden Age were discovered."
