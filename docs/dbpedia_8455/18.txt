TEHRAN – The Zarangush canyon in Iran’s western Ilam province is considered as one of the least-known tourist attractions of the region.

The two-kilometer canyon hosts a river which flows during rain seasons.

Being over 500 meters high, it has 12 historical and natural sites, which make the canyon a significant national treasure.

A few years ago, following a heavy flood in the canyon, pottery vessels from the Islamic Golden Age were discovered.
