        "text": "Blaise Pascal has been viewed as a major modern philosopher but today is being increasingly ignored. One of my passions is philosophy and I was shocked to discover that the famous Pascal was totally ignored in the popular “Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers” (2010) and “The Story of Philosophy” by Bryan Magee (1998) and “The Oxford Companion to Philosophy” (1995). However, he does merit a four page entry by RH Popkin (Emeritus Philosophy Professor, Washington University-St. Louis, MO) in “Great Thinkers of the Western World” (1992) and a substantial write-up in Wikipedia. Even a Google search on the word Pascal first lists the scientific unit of pressure named in his honour. This essay will examine this major omission of Pascal from the ranks of the principal philosophers of Western Europe. We shall show that he annoyed too many powerful people both then and later, so it was easier to omit him than confront his radical, independent philosophical/religious thinking, while acknowledging his major mathematical achievements and minor scientific research."
