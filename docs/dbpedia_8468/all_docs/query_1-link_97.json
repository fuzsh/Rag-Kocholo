        "text": "This is the first Ryan Holiday book I read. It will fall under the genre of self-improvement. A lot of reference to stoic and buddhist philosophy very neatly packaged into bite sized wisdom you can chew easily. The good thing about this book is it's easy flow and numerous examples. A lot of Marcus Aurelius, Confucius, Seneca, Epictetus, and anecdotes of Tiger Woods, J.F Kennedy, Churchill, Anne Frank, Michael Jordan make it a pleasure to read. Particularly liked how he painted Kennedy as a grey figure.\n\nIt simplifies and condenses a lot of important wisdom that you can easily grasp without going in depth into Zen / Taoism / Buddhism or Stoicism. This can also be something that the serious reader may find vexing. It sometimes over simplifies and seem shallow. For example - it does not delve deeper into the Stoic philosophy.\n\nThe way I see it, this can be a great first read that can trigger your journey to go in depth, if that is what you desire. If not - read on. You will gain some great insight.\n\nIt is arranged in three main sections - Mind, Body and Soul which he expands upon.\n\nHow I stumbled upon this book\n\nStumbled upon Jim Carrey's speech at the Golden Globe Awards 2016. This led me to some of his interviews and a Netflix video where he has completely reinvented himself. Did not know he paints so well. So following that trail led me to Mr Holiday.\n\nIf you are getting impatient with this meandering - be STILL, because it is the key. :)\n\n“You will never feel okay by way of external accomplishments. Enough comes from the inside. It comes from stepping off the train. From seeing what you already have, what you’ve always had.”\n\nThis is the speech, by the way I was talking about.\n\nNow, let's get back to some quotes from the book I found interesting. The reason I am sharing this is for people who will not read the book but can get the highlights. If you are intrigued and want to give it a read then you can skip the excerpts.\n\nSome excerpts I liked –\n\n“All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”\n\n“We do not live in this moment. We, in fact, try desperately to get out of it—by thinking, doing, talking, worrying, remembering, hoping, whatever. We pay thousands of dollars to have a device in our pocket to ensure that we are never bored. We sign up for endless activities and obligations, chase money and accomplishments, all with the naïve belief that at the end of it will be happiness.”\n\n“We want to learn to see the world like an artist: While other people are oblivious to what surrounds them, the artist really sees. Their mind, fully engaged, notices the way a bird flies or the way a stranger holds their fork or a mother looks at her child. They have no thoughts of the morrow. All they are thinking about is how to capture and communicate this experience. An artist is present. And from this stillness comes brilliance.”\n\n“A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”\n\n“If you wish to improve,” Epictetus once said, “be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.”\n\n“There is ego in trying to appear the most informed person in the room, the one with all the gossip, who knows every single thing that’s happening in everyone’s life.”\n\n“Marcus Aurelius says, “Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’”\n\n“The way you feel when you awake early in the morning and your mind is fresh and as yet unsoiled by the noise of the outside world—that’s space worth protecting.”\n\n“Your job, after you have emptied your mind, is to slow down and think. To really think, on a regular basis.\n\nThink about what’s important to you.\n\nThink about what’s actually going on.\n\nThink about what might be hidden from view.\n\nThink about what the rest of the chessboard looks like.\n\nThink about what the meaning of life really is.”\n\n“People who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read.”\n\n“Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”\n\n“Many of us carry wounds from our childhood. Maybe someone didn’t treat us right. Or we experienced something terrible. Or our parents were just a little too busy or a little too critical or a little too stuck dealing with their own issues to be what we needed.”\n\n“How much better and less scary life is when we don’t have to see it from the perspective of a scared, vulnerable child? How much lighter will our load be if we’re not adding extra baggage on top?”\n\n“Take the time to think about the pain you carry from your early experiences. Think about the “age” of the emotional reactions you have when you are hurt or betrayed or unexpectedly challenged in some way. That’s your inner child. They need a hug from you. They need you to say, “Hey, buddy. It’s okay. I know you’re hurt, but I am going to take care of you.”\n\n“To have an impulse and to resist it, to sit with it and examine it, to let it pass by like a bad smell—this is how we develop spiritual strength. This is how we become who we want to be in this world.”\n\n“What do we want more of in life? That’s the question. It’s not accomplishments. It’s not popularity. It’s moments when we feel like we are enough.\"\n\n“The Japanese have a concept, shinrin yoku—forest bathing—which is a form of therapy that uses nature as a treatment for mental and spiritual issues. ”\n\n“Don’t let the beauty of life escape you. See the world as the temple that it is. Let every experience be churchlike. Marvel at the fact that any of this exists—that you exist. Even when we are killing each other in pointless wars, even when we are killing ourselves with pointless work, we can stop and bathe in the beauty that surrounds us, always.”\n\n“Again, when nearly all the wise people of history agree, we should pause and reflect. It’s next to impossible to find an ancient philosophical school that does not talk about a higher power (or higher powers). Not because they had “evidence” of its existence, but because they knew how powerful faith and belief were, how essential they were to the achievement of stillness and inner peace.”\n\n“Anyone who’s traveled long enough knows this. It’s eventually clear we carry with us on the road more baggage than just our suitcase and our backpacks.”\n\n“Despair and restlessness go together.\n\nThe problem is that you can’t flee despair. You can’t escape, with your body, problems that exist in your mind and soul. You can’t run away from your choices—you can only fix them with better choices.”\n\n“ In Greek, “leisure” is rendered as scholé—that is, school. Leisure historically meant simply freedom from the work needed to survive, freedom for intellectual or creative pursuits. It was learning and study and the pursuit of higher things.”\n\n“The best car is not the one that turns the most heads, but the one you have to worry about the least.”\n\n“When we not only automate and routinize the trivial parts of life, but also make automatic good and virtuous decisions, we free up resources to do important and meaningful exploration. We buy room for peace and stillness, and thus make good work and good thoughts accessible and inevitable.\n\nTo make that possible, you must go now and get your house in order. Get your day scheduled. Limit the interruptions. Limit the number of choices you need to make.”"
