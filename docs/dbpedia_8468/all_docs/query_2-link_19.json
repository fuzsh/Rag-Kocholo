        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe second rule of Descartes’ “provisional moral code” stressed the obligation of mastering oneself rather than fortune. Of Stoic inspiration ( The Manual of Epictetus), the Cartesian rule carefully delimitates what is and what is not in man’s power. In addition, the rule calls for the distinction expressed in the fourth Metaphysical Meditation between the intellect and the will and for the necessity to temper the will’s natural tendency to overcome its inherent borders. In the Preface of his Principles of Philosophy , Descartes views philosophy as a form of therapy that can treat illnesses of the mind, just as medicine treats illnesses of the body. Philosophy is thus charged with leading us to the “true health of the mind,” by cultivating a “true and sound judgment”. This Cartesian moral code that seems to provide a minimal balance between concrete action and man’s will is violently criticized by Blaise Pascal in the Conversation with Mr. de Sacy , where the principles of Stoic morality are called “principles of a diabolic pride [that] lead him to other errors”. The provisional moral code is discredited by Pascal because, in his opinion, human will cannot be limited – as Descartes thought – because it is infinite: “Self-will will never be satisfied, though it should have command of all it would”.\n\nKeywords: Moralityreasonfree willrationalityDescartesPascal\n\nDescartes’ tree of knowledge and the undetermined place of morals\n\nIn the Letter-Preface addressed to Abbot Picot, which opens the Principles of Philosophy , René\n\nDescartes describes the substantial unit of philosophy using the famous image of the tree: the roots\n\nrepresent metaphysics, the trunk stands for physics and the three branches are medicine, mechanics and\n\nmorals (Descartes, 1988: 186). Descartes describes morals as the ultimate level of wisdom ( sagesse ),\n\nwhich presupposes the other sciences: “By the science of Morals, I understand the highest and most\n\nperfect which, presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last degree of wisdom”\n\n(Descartes, 1901: 8b). Hence, morals are the last in the chronological order of knowledge, but the first\n\nin terms of importance, because they are the true purpose of the whole of philosophy. Nonetheless, the\n\nseductive image of the tree of knowledge cannot occult several fundamental questions concerning\n\nmostly the relation between the root and the three separate branches of philosophy. Hence, Martin\n\nHeidegger justly wonders in what type of soil the tree deepens its roots, what is the vital element\n\nsupporting and feeding it and mostly what lies buried in the essence of metaphysics as root of the entire\n\nknowledge: “What lies buried and is active in the essence of metaphysics?” (Heidegger, 2013: 6).\n\nHeidegger’s questions cannot be considered tendentious, insofar as the relationship per se between\n\nthe roots, the trunk and the tree is not proven (but only stated ), and the common element of all parts is\n\nsupposed to be the same (without being defined as such), making its way up from the ground, through\n\nthe root and to the last branch. Furthermore, while the image features three “principal” branches that\n\nseem to be equally important, the last branch (morals) that presupposes an entire knowledge of the\n\nother sciences actually appears to be above them. Under these circumstances, considering the dilemma\n\nof moral stance in relation to medicine and mechanics, we get to “a structural incompleteness of\n\nphilosophy” (Vaquero, 2009: 472), which turns the unit of philosophy – posited by Descartes – into a\n\nproblem more than into a given or a constituted object (Vaquero, 2009: 472). Consequently, the\n\ntopologically undetermined situation of the Cartesian moral code signals the precariousness of its\n\nmetaphysical foundation . Can a “perfect” moral code as expression of the highest wisdom, be deduced\n\nrationally from metaphysical principles? If so, does it mean that we can find an answer to the\n\nHeideggerian question “What lies buried and is active in the essence of metaphysics?”\n\nInitial place: the self as certitude and its probable morals\n\nIn Discourse on the Method (1637), Descartes elaborates a provisory code of morals, composed of\n\nthree maxims (Descartes, 2007: 11-2). The anteriority of the Discourse in relation to Meditationes de\n\nprima philosophia (1641) can maybe explain why Descartes decided to write a “provisory”, not a\n\n“definitive” code of morals. At the same time, however, the maxims of this code of morals are required\n\nmeant to represent the roots of knowledge. The same reason that seeks a firm and unshakeable\n\nfoundation and that requires – in the first maxim of the method – avoiding “extremes” demands from\n\nthe philosopher to act, in morals-related issues, without waiting for absolute certitude : “So as not to be\n\nindecisive in my actions during the time when reason obliged me to be so in my judgments” (Descartes,\n\n2007:11).\n\nIt is odd how the same reason can formulate two different types of constraint: in the order of\n\nknowledge, reason requires absolute certitude, while in the order of action it requires overcoming\n\nindecision. A judgement may be postponed indefinitely, if the knowledge it is based on does not prove\n\nto be sufficiently clear and distinct to eliminate all grounds for doubt: “…and to include in my\n\njudgments only what presented itself to my mind so vividly and so clearly that I had no basis for calling\n\nit in question” (Descartes, 2007: 8). Neamwhile, an action cannot be delayed: “And similarly, since in\n\neveryday life we often have to act without delay, it is a most certain truth that when we can’t pick out\n\nthe truest opinions we should follow the most probable ones” (Descartes, 2007: 12). Hence, we note\n\nthat there is no perfect superposition between the order of knowledge and the order of action.\n\nNonetheless, how can we accept this paradoxical thesis, considering the lines written in the Letter-\n\nPreface of the Principles ? If metaphysics is the root of all human sciences – including morals – and if\n\nthe same sap of reason feeds the root and the branches, why can the principles of morals be provisory ,\n\nwhile the root can only accept firm and unshakeable principles? This is not a contradiction that\n\nundermines the unity of science and the relation between sciences within the tree of knowledge?\n\nTwo answers may be provided to this question. The first answer considers the chronology of\n\nCartesian writings. In 1637, the Discourse invoked only a “provisory” code of morals because\n\nmetaphysics would only later – in 1641 ( Meditations ) – find a firm foundation: the self . The provisory\n\ncode of morals does not require yet, unlike metaphysics, a firm and unshakable foundation on which to\n\nbuild the entire moral code. It requires an ethical situation that combines conservatism with removal\n\nfrom extremes („to obey the laws and customs of my country, holding constantly to the religion in\n\nwhich by God’s grace I had been instructed from my childhood … on the basis of the most moderate\n\nand least extreme opinions” (Descartes, 2007: 11).\n\nThe second answer considers the different role ascribed to the self in the two Cartesian writings. It is\n\nas true that the self would become in Meditations the central point of knowledge, as it is that in the\n\nDiscourse such claim was still rejected. Furthermore, the first maxim of the provisory code of morals\n\nexplicitly deprives the self from providing grounds for morals, by replacing one’s own opinions with\n\nthose of other persons: “…the opinions commonly accepted in practice by the most sensible of the\n\npeople with whom I would have to live” (Descartes, 2007: 11).\n\nWithin the Discourse , the self – not yet the first principle of any knowledge – accepts to ascribe the\n\nrole of moral guide to another instance. To avoid remaining undetermined for an indefinite period and\n\nto enable moral actions, ipseity acknowledges its limits and accepts submission to alterity. The\n\ntheoretical possibility and practical effectiveness of morals are acquired only by paying the price of\n\n“chasing away” the self from the decision-making core of morals, where principles are established. A\n\nmoral action cannot be possible unless the self willingly stops deciding in matters of morals criteria, by\n\ngranting this privilege to others.\n\nWhat the self can and cannot do\n\nIn his commentaries on the Discourse , Etienne Gilson (Gilson, 1987: 248-9) underscored the Stoic\n\ninspiration of the third maxim (“Try always to master myself rather than fortune, and change my\n\ndesires rather than changing how things stand in the world” (Descartes, 2007: 12)). The self yet to\n\nacquire clear knowledge can however operate a Stoic distinction, between the things within man’s\n\npower and those exceeding his power:\n\n“This involved getting the habit of believing that nothing lies entirely within our power except\n\nour thoughts, so that after we have done our best in dealing with matters external to us,\n\nwhatever we fail to achieve is absolutely impossible so far as we are concerned” (Descartes,\n\n2007: 12).\n\nHow is it possible for an action considered morally good to occur, even in the absence of clear and\n\ndistinct knowledge of things? Furthermore, how is it possible to judge whether a thing is within man’s\n\npower or not? The commentary made by Pierre-Sylvain Régis (Regis, 1691: 7:44) explains this\n\nseeming contradiction within the Cartesian text by stating that man’s intellect and will accomplish\n\ndifferent functions: “…l’action de l’esprit par laquelle nous jugeons qu’une chose est bonne ou\n\nmauvaise est une fonction qui appartient à la volonte, et l’action que nous connaissons que nous avons\n\njuge ainsi est une fonction qui appartient à l’entendement”. Nonetheless, it is known that intellect and\n\nwill must co-operate and that the will must “stretch” almost naturally to meet the powers of the\n\nintellect, to the end of preventing the will from making wrong choices.\n\nHence, in the letter to Mersenne, dated May 1637 (initial dating: April 27, 1637), Descartes posits\n\nthat a correct judgement is required for an action to be morally good:\n\n“You reject my statement that In order to act well it is sufficient to judge well; yet it seems to\n\nme that the common scholastic doctrine is that The will doesn’t tend towards evil except when\n\nevil is presented to it by the intellect as some kind of good—which generates the slogan\n\nWhoever sins does so în ignorance—so that if the intellect never represented anything to the\n\nwill as good without its actually being so, the will could never choose wrongly. But the\n\nintellect often represents different things to the will at the same time, and that is the source of I\n\nsee and praise the better, but I follow the worse. This applies only to weak minds, as I said in\n\nthe Discourse on the Method” (Descartes, 2013: 41).\n\nThe key to a good action of will is actually a correct knowledge of things by the intellect. Whereas\n\nthey play different roles, the two faculties ( juger – will; connaître – intellect) cannot be exerted\n\nindependently: the intellect must represent to the will things that are– not only seem– really good. The\n\nongoing tension governing the will – that has to make choices considering the limits prescribed by the\n\nintellect – cannot and should not disappear, because it is the most visible sign of a provisory – namely\n\nimperfect – code of morals. A disappearance of the tension experienced by the will would entail that\n\nhuman intellect would have reached a level of knowledge similar to divine knowledge (Gabaude, 1970:\n\n223). Such hypothesis is excluded, precisely because human intellect will never reach the level of\n\ndivine intellect, given that humans will never get to know things adequately (Adam & Tannery, 1983:\n\nVII, 367). Nonetheless, while knowledge will never be fully appropriate, the will must act as though\n\nthe intellect would provide the highest and firmest knowledge. This is the meaning ascribed to the\n\nsecond maxim of the provisory code of morals (Descartes, 2007: 11-2).\n\nDescartes uses a suggestive example to this end: he compares the process of taking a moral decision\n\nto the decision of travellers who, having lost their way in a forest, must not wander from side to side or\n\nremain in one place. They proceed constantly without changing the direction, because this guarantees\n\nthey will come to some place (preferable to the middle of a forest). The provisory character of this code\n\nmust be maintained as long as there is no better code of morals and the common meaning of the three\n\nmaxims is to overcome the possible sceptical objection that we cannot act if we do not hold a perfect\n\nknowledge of things. However, the provisory character of the code is visible mostly by adopting a Stoic\n\nview of the world (the third maxim) positing that only our own thoughts are absolutely in our power\n\nand that, to be contented, it is sufficient for man not to desire anything that he could not obtain.\n\nHowever, is this view free of dangers? Is the first maxim – that advises the self to stop prescribing\n\nits own moral criteria and to adopt those of others – compatible with the third maxim (supporting that\n\nthe self should assume its own thoughts in their capacity of unique things in its power)? Can the self\n\ngive up easily and willingly (the first maxim) to the only thing in its power (the third maxim), namely\n\nits own thoughts?\n\nHuman wisdom and its limits\n\nThe provisory code of morals was going to become definitive, by defining wisdom ( sagesse ) not\n\nonly as prudence . This definition (Adam & Tannery, 1983: IX, 10) shows clearly that, after 1645,\n\nDescartes views wisdom as a “perfect” knowledge that comprises all things knowable to man. On the\n\nother hand, there is an apparent difference between 1637 ( Discourse ) and 1645, when Descartes wrote\n\nto Princess Elizabeth the letter from August 4. The three maxims of the provisory code of morals\n\nbecome the three rules of strictly human wisdom (Armogathe, 2002: 17), primed as early as 1639,\n\nwhose key is to “love life without fearing death” ( aimer la vie sans craindre la mort ), as Descartes\n\nwrote to Mersenne. It is worth highlighting the Stoic distinction between what is in man’s power and\n\nwhat it is not and its replacement with another, which posits to ignore the goods that man does not\n\npossess (Adam & Tannery, 1983: IV, 265-6).\n\nThis third maxim within the Letter to Elisabeth is no longer grounded on a Stoic-inspired moral code,\n\nbut only on the power of reason, which can prescribe to people the conduct to follow. Unlike the\n\nDiscourse , where the first maxim decentres the self in order to provide a moral code (by instituting the\n\nobligation of leading himself by the moderate opinions of the wisest men), the first maxim of 1645 posits\n\nthat reason alone should decide what man must and must not do (Adam & Tannery, 1983: IV, 265).\n\nThe purpose of wisdom ( sagesse ) is to acquire autonomy (Adam & Tannery, 1983: IV, 265). On the\n\nother hand, beyond the ethical dimension of the feeling of “contentment”, it also has a theological\n\ndimension. Thus, Descartes redefines the classical concept of beatitudo (that described the state of\n\nhappiness reached by man while contemplating God) by considering it a “parfait contentement d’esprit\n\net une satisfaction intérieure” (Adam & Tannery, 1983: IV, 266). Such a redefinition of the relationship\n\nbetween man and God – which formerly implied reaching moral autonomy only by exerting reason and\n\nby seeking refuge in an inner satisfaction that closed the possible interrogation regarding the downsides\n\nof reason itself – could not remain outside Pascal’s analysis.\n\nPascalian critique of the Cartesian self. The limits of philosophy\n\nWhen he criticizes Descartes, Blaise Pascal does so elegantly, using both a “compliment at the same\n\ntime honest and perfidious” (Bouchilloux, 1995: 245) and an “ambiguous praise” (Bouchilloux, 1995:\n\n76). He chooses to proceed this way because he acknowledges the role and importance of the self as\n\nprinciple of a new metaphysics and – starting from it – even of a new physics (Pascal, 1909: 60).\n\nHowever, Pascal is highly persuaded that Descartes is “ inutile et incertain ” (Lafuma, 1962: §887),\n\nbecause philosophical judgments are “ inutile(s) pour le salut ” (Lafuma, 1962: §110). Hence, Pascal\n\nshifts the matter of philosophical wisdom ( sagesse ) utility toward the soteriological dimension (aiming\n\nto Christian salvation). However, this shift is actually a “destitution” (Marion, 1986: 325-42) of\n\nphilosophical claims, in the name of the theory of the three different ontological orders ( ordres ): of the\n\nbodies, of the souls and of something that is loved. Pascal pinpoints that all philosophers – without\n\nexception – are guilty of giving in to one of the three concupiscences of man (Lafuma, 1962: §919),\n\nnamely libidosentiendi , libido dominandi , libido sciendi. In “Conversation of Pascal with M. de Saci\n\non Epictetus and Montaigne”, Pascal features the two philosophers as two extremes of any human\n\nphilosophy, namely “diabolical pride” and “skepticism”. However, the critique to Stoicism targets all\n\nof philosophy, because no philosopher – not even those who assimilate man to an animal – manages to\n\nresist to all three concupiscences. Therefore, the critique to Epictetus also targets Descartes directly,\n\nbecause the Cartesian provisory code of morals has a Stoic inspiration, while Pascal rejects (using a\n\ntheological argument) the reasons’ claims of determining what is and what is not in our power:\n\n“These principles of a diabolic pride lead him to other errors, as that the soul is a portion of\n\nthe divine substance” (Pascal, 1909: 5).\n\nHowever, the most devastating critique to Descartes does not concern the Stoic dimension of his\n\n1637 provisory code of morals, but the very pretension of the self of being the fundament of the 1645\n\ndefinitive moral code.\n\nPascal believes that the self of man affected by the Fall has an unfair ( injuste ) nature, because it\n\nalways wishes to be the centre of all:\n\n“In a word, the Self has two qualities: it is unjust in itself since it makes itself the centre of\n\neverything; it is inconvenient to others since it would enslave them; for each Self is the enemy,\n\nand would like to be the tyrant of all others” (Eliot, 1959: §455).\n\nThis critique of the self that attempts to be the “centre” is a constant of Pascalian thinking (see also\n\nthe paragraph §100). What Descartes called the metaphysical force of the self becomes for Pascal its\n\noriginal sin, and this negative trait of the self cannot be diminished or impaired, but it must be\n\neradicated definitively.\n\nTo this end, the self must be decentred , chased away from itself , removed as philosophical instance\n\nand replaced by another, represented by Jesus Christ: “The nature of self-love and of this human Ego is\n\nto love self only and consider self only” (Eliot, 1959: §449).\n\nThe role of the movement made to set away the self from the central place that it wishes to occupy is\n\nnot merely therapeutic (aiming to cure the self from the original selfishness) but also metaphysical.\n\nThus, the self must ultimately hate itself:\n\n“We must love God only and hate self only” (Eliot, 1959: §476),\n\n“Now we are full of lust. Therefore we are full of evil; therefore we ought to hate ourselves and\n\nall that excited us to attach ourselves to any other object than God only” (Eliot, 1959: §479).\n\nThe self-hatred of the self has the role not only of preparing it for religious conversion, but mostly of\n\ntearing out the very roots of the metaphysical claim of deciding on its own , using only reason (see the\n\nletter to Elizabeth, dated August 4, 1645) over moral code and its criteria.\n\nThe autonomy claim of reason not only helps the self understand the potential errors, but it forbids\n\nregretting them (even when they are proven), as Descartes states explicitly:\n\n“We can rid ourselves of that opinion by bearing in mind that since we have always followed\n\nthe advice of our reason we have left undone nothing that was in our power, and that sickness\n\nand misfortune are as natural to man as prosperity and health” (Benett, 2009: 19);\n\nUltimately, any philosophy that does not acknowledge God as centre of the self only produces\n\n“superbes agitations de notre raison” (Lafuma, 1962: §131).\n\nAs for Heidegger’s question concerning what lies buried in the essence of metaphysics, Pascal had\n\nalready provided a trenchant answer to it: “abîme d'orgueil” (Lafuma, 1962: §919).\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis article was funded by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0998: Models of Producing and Disseminating Knowledge in Early Modern Europe: the Cartesian Framework.\n\nReferences\n\nDescartes, R.
