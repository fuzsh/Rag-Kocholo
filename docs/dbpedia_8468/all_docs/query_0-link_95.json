        "text": "Christian Thinker Speaks Across the Ages, to All\n\nPascal is incredible. His aphorisms describe the humans of the past, present and far-flung future (if there is one, and the multiculturalism thanatists don't scotch it). Wickham is a classy reader. No matter your beliefs, you'll probably like this philosopher, who gets to the point. And he's Pascal of Pascal's Wager!\n\nExcellent Audiobook!\n\nHere is yet another great audiobook production by Naxon. The translation from the French language into English, which was used in this audiobook is truly exceptional. Also, Peter Wickham having read the text, was the crowning achievement; indeed it was superlative!\n\nI found in listening to this audiobook, that Blaise Pascal had a great deal of insight, which thanks to the excellent English translation, was made available to me. It is always of interest to me, to observe the differences between our thinking, and that of those who lived centuries before us! It is becoming more and more clear to me, that men in earlier times reasoned differently, but in a nuanced way. Put differently; we work with that which we have.\n\nImportant Reading for Christians\n\nThis book has affected my thinking more than anything I have read in a long time. It is very well worth the time it takes to read it once and there are some parts which merit repeated reading and deep meditation.\n\nIt is not just intelligent and interesting. It is spiritually formative. It will help to solidify the faith of the faithful.\n\nThe quality of the narration of this audio book is good enough . . ."
