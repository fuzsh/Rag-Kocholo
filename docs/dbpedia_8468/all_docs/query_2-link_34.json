        "text": "“I have only made this letter longer because I have not had the time to make it shorter.\"\n\n(Letter 16, 1657)”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, The Provincial Letters\n\n“People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, De l'art de persuader\n\n“The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of... We know the truth not only by the reason, but by the heart.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, Pensées\n\n“Curiosity is only vanity. We usually only want to know something so that we can talk about it.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, Pensées\n\n“I lay it down as a fact that if all men knew what others say of them, there would not be four friends in the world.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal\n\n“All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal\n\n“We are generally the better persuaded by the reasons we discover ourselves than by those given to us by others.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, Pensees\n\n“If we submit everything to reason our religion will be left with nothing mysterious or supernatural. If we offend the principles of reason our religion will be absurd and ridiculous . . . There are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.”\n\n― Blaise Pascal, Pensées"
