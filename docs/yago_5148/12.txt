Early life

Hennessy, born in Edmonton, Alberta, comes from a family of eclectic backgrounds. Her father, John Hennessy, a meat salesman and a sales/marketing executive, led a nomadic life due to the nature of his job, resulting in frequent relocations for the family. After her mother, Maxine, a secretary, left the family in 1982, Hennessy was raised partly by her paternal grandmother, Eleanor, in Kitchener, Ontario. She has a younger brother, John Paul "J.P." Hennessy, Jr., and an identical twin sister, Jacqueline, a reputed magazine writer and TV show host in Canada.

Her mixed heritage includes Irish, French, Swedish, and Italian from her father's side, and primarily Ukrainian Roma along with Austrian from her mother's side. Hennessy spent her school years at Stanley Park Senior Public School and graduated from Grand River Collegiate Institute, both located in Kitchener, Ontario. She honed her street performance skills by busking in the Toronto subway.

Career

Hennessy kickstarted her acting career alongside her sister in 1988, playing twin call girls in Dead Ringers. She had a brief stint on Broadway in the musical Buddy â€“ The Buddy Holly Story in 1990 and stepped into the realm of sci-fi in 1993, playing Dr. Marie Lazarus in RoboCop 3.

Her big break came later that year when she joined the cast of the hit NBC crime drama Law & Order as assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid. She mesmerized audiences in this role for three seasons until her departure in 1996.

In addition to her on-screen appearances, Hennessy has also shown a knack for behind-the-scenes work. In 2000, she co-wrote, produced, and co-directed an independent film mockumentary titled The Acting Class. She continued to grace screens big and small, starring in films like Nuremberg, Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot, Exit Wounds, and a popular TV show Crossing Jordan. For her accomplishments in acting, she was awarded a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in 2007.

Beyond acting, Hennessy has demonstrated her musical prowess by recording the album Ghost in My Head, released in June 2009. She performed as a guest of the Indigo Girls on Mountain Stage and at the 2010 edition of Lilith Fair.

In the following years, she continued to appear in numerous TV shows and films, including Madam Secretary, the Michael Weatherly series Bull, and the series Yellowstone.
