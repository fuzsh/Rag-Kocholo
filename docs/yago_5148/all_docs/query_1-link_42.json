        "text": "Robert:\n\nMy viewpoints on who I would have become the next ADA when it is time to\n\nreplace Elisabeth Rohm have to do with two big reasons:\n\n1. While shows on the WB may not get the best numbers, as I've noted many times\n\nhow their shows have a considerable fan loyalty not seen even by the most\n\npopular shows on the \"big four\" networks. This is why when this NG discussed\n\nwho might have been a replacement for Angie Harmon (which turned out to be\n\nElisabeth Rohm), one of who I mentioned was Jamie Luner, who was on the WB\n\nseries Savannah (a series that ended WAY too early because of from what I\n\nremember philosophical changes at The WB several years ago), with many of her\n\nfans from there following her to Melrose Place (where she was on for the final\n\ntwo seasons of that show), and then on to NBC for the final season of Profiler\n\n(which only ended when it did because of NBC's ill-fated attempt with the XFL\n\non Saturday nights in 2001, as NBC didn't have a suitable time slot available\n\nfor \"Profiler\"). Ms. Luner I think would actually have been a better choice as\n\nthe ADA when we were looking for a replacement for Angie Harmon in my opinion,\n\nand anyone who saw her on \"Profiler\" that last season would know she would have\n\nbeen great as Jack's assistant. She is ALSO someone I'd love to see eventually\n\ntake over the role from Elisabeth Rohm if Dick Wolf is smart enough to make\n\nsuch a move when the time comes.\n\n2. In the case of \"Charmed\" in particular, the numbers don't tell the whole\n\nstory with that show. Even though that show's numbers have been down\n\nconsiderably the last season (which is why many of us have thought this will be\n\nthe last season of \"Charmed\"), that has been because it had to last season air\n\ndirectly opposite \"Crime Scene Investigation\" (aka CSI, now the most-watched\n\nshow on television) on CBS as well as the comedy pairing of \"Will & Grace\" and\n\n\"Just Shoot Me\" on NBC. This is actually something many \"Charmed\" fans refuse\n\nto accept, as most of them think the tank in ratings last season had everything\n\nto do with Shannen Doherty leaving when it was not.\n\nEven though \"Charmed's\" numbers are very low (though there are a surprising\n\nnumber of fans of \"Law & Order\" who also are fans of \"Charmed\"), if you ever\n\nwent to the Charmed Newsgroup (alt.tv.charmed) or other boards related to the\n\nWB show, you would find a far greater number of fans posting about \"Charmed\"\n\nthan you ever see concerning \"Law & Order\" (in fact, a search on AOL concerning\n\n\"Charmed\" found nearly 465,000 sites concerning \"Charmed\", whereas if you look\n\nfor the TV Show \"Law & Order\", that number drops considerably, on the search I\n\ndid in the low four figures, but if you include the two spinoffs that number\n\nprobably grows some (you have to do \"L & O\" the TV Show because you otherwise\n\nfind it mixed in with various Police sites). You would have a better\n\nunderstanding why I've felt that when \"Charmed\" ends my first choice to take\n\nover as the ADA would be Holly Marie Combs, though she is FAR from the only WB\n\nactor I think would be a great choice to take over as the ADA.\n\nAnother is Ms. Combs' sometimes co-star on \"Charmed\", Dorian Gregory (who\n\ncurrently co-hosts \"The Other Half\" with Dick Clark and Danny Bonaduce among\n\nothers in daytime syndication). He is another who would bring \"Charmed\" fans to\n\n\"L & O\" that I have previously mentioned, and would be a great choice if they\n\ndecided to ever go back to having a male ADA. He happens to be black, and that\n\nin itself would help in this case as it would set up a potentially very similar\n\nsituation to the early seasons of \"L & O\" with Ben Stone (Michael Moriarity)\n\nand Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks) that I think would make for some great\n\nsub-storylines. We've never seen Jack McCoy with a male assistant, let alone\n\nsomeone who is black, and I wonder how Jack would be working in that dynamic\n\nafter a long string of female assistants.\n\nAnother more obvious choice would be Shannen Doherty, except others who post in\n\nthe Charmed newsgroups and elsewhere have noted she probably doesn't want to do\n\nanother series full-time for now (that's why I've always mentioned her in a\n\nguest role, most likely as a defense attorney on her first major murder case),\n\nthough I think being as prestigeous a series as \"L & O\" is, it might be one of\n\nthe only exceptions. If Ms. Doherty did join the cast as Jack's assistant (or\n\nin another role), whatever I've said about Ms. Combs bringing fans over to \"L &\n\nO\" from \"Charmed\" would be AT LEAST double if not more so."
