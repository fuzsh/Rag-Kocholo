        "text": "Performing Arts is a new subject which has been added to the national primary school curriculum since the introduction of the Nine Year Schooling Project, in Mauritius. This new subject is used as an interactive tool to contribute to the social and psychological development of the children. During the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, more than 60 students have been studying Performing Arts as an elective module at Mauritius Institute of Educations Bachelor Education for Primary teachers, under the lead of the lecturer Mr. Per Skjöldebrand. The students, some with over 30 years experience as teachers, are Headmasters, language teachers, general purpose teachers etc, etc. One of the major ideas behind the module is for students to implement exercises and activities at their schools. 14 topics have been covered under 3 units: 1.The foundation 2. Required skills 3. Creating and developing compositions At the very end of this course we saw a possibility to conclude their reflections and to formulate some guidelines and strong propositions to the local, school level and the structural educational level. The purpose of this report is to develop and facilitate the new and significant important subject: Performing Arts, Drama in education in Mauritius.\n\nThe article addresses the question of whether in using a school performance as a tool in ELT it is possible to achieve true artistic effects through it. It analyses the problem from the point of view of focusing on the value of the outcome rather than just the process of implementing theatre in ELT. The issues are discussed according to Bruner’s criteria (1971) of artistic experience and Wenzel’s conditions (2001) for authenticity in speaking in an ELT classroom. Furthermore, the notion of cognitive appeal is put forward as a key feature in achieving a shift in students’ attitude towards performing, which may in turn result in achieving a truly artistic effect.\n\nThis study investigated the lives of three active music teacher performers and how their performing experience impacted pedagogy and perceived student learning in the classroom. At the time of data collection, one participant was a full-time elementary school music teacher, and the other two participants were full-time secondary school music teachers. Philosophically, this study intended to discover the central meaning underlying the life experiences of each participant as they relate to pedagogy and perceived student learning (phenomenology). Methodologically, qualitative data (typical of phenomenological inquiry) were collected through both interviews and a focus group session. Furthermore, a traditional thematic exploration of the data was employed. Findings indicate that pedagogy and perceived student learning are positively impacted through the theme of respect and negatively impacted through the themes of fatigue and job dissatisfaction. Such themes invite all educators within the performing arts to reexamine and reflect upon the intricate relationship between performing and teaching. Keywords: phenomenology, music teacher performers, pedagogy, perceived student learning\n\nIn this case study, the habits of a 17-year-old home-schooled female student who was engaged in a private acting class that took place in an urban community theater were explored. I investigated several issues relating to this student studying acting. The research questions focused on what relationship(s), if any, existed between the student studying acting and her schoolwork. Specifically, I investigated what role(s), if any, did the acting class content play in the student’s academic performance in speaking, listening, writing, personal performance and identity. Data included teacher, parent, and student interviews triangulated with classroom observations and student artifacts. This student experienced, learned, and implemented acting and drama techniques in her daily life and perceived a gain in self-esteem and increasing expressiveness in other aspects of her life. Additional findings suggested that students who are home-schooled may benefit from social interaction and drama exp...\n\nThis report resulted from a number of meetings in the context of The Performative Arts and Pedagogy Project – Towards the Development of an International Glossary (for further details click here). Representatives from five different countries (Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Switzerland) have contributed to the project, engaging in an interdisciplinary and intercultural exchange that aims at an increased awareness of (culture-)specific concepts and associated terminologies that are applied in Performative Arts and Pedagogy contexts.\n\nhas reinforced the importance of curriculum transformation in the changing South African landscape. This is due to the visible disequilibrium and insufficiency of the skills required by the industry in the previous curriculum. Therefore, The TUT Performing Arts Programme had to establish a new curriculum (artistic creativity, problem-solving, and business skills for performing arts) to accommodate the industry demand and to ensure that performers are relevant to the contemporary Performing Arts industry. This paper seeks to explore how students and lecturers experience the changes within the new curriculum at TUT as well as their perception of the significance of the transformed curriculum. A qualitative research methodology was used in this study, whereby methods such as interviews were conducted with Performing Arts students and graduates, lecturers, and employers in the industry. The research sought to establish how curriculum transformation is supported by the changed curriculum. The findings of this study demonstrate that the new curriculum will empower performers with balanced skill sets that enable them to become more marketable. The study also found that the new curriculum would provide sufficient entrepreneurial skills for performers to establish their businesses confidently. The paper concludes that TUT's new curriculum will accommodate the demands of a fluctuating 21st-century arts industry. 1\n\nThe chapter is focused on the mode of playing that features prominently in the performing arts. Inspired by Italo Calvino’s ideas on the future of literature in the form of memos, they try to imagine in a similar way how classrooms might become enacted differently in the future by writing memos on features such as inventiveness, thirdness, playfulness, experimentalism, nimbleness and asceticism/athleticism. Remembering some innovative opera and dance performances in the Brussels art scene, they reflect upon how these artistic companies are engaging with experimentation and how this is mirrored in approaches to art education. Considering the creative bravura of the performing arts and their educational practices, the authors urge us to experiment with how management education can be done with similar danger and daring, giving some inspiration to ‘swim along with them’ by turning to some illustrative practices from three Master’s courses."
