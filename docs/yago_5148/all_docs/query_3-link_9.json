        "text": "This was our last week of inputs for Integrated Arts in Education. We began in the music workshop by learning to play the ukulele and how this can be used in the classroom. As stated previously in my blog posts i have had no experience with musical instruments before and therefore really struggled to see how I could use the ukulele in the classroom to teach children. However, I have now learned that songs can be played using only C, F and G has made me feel more confident in that I would be able to teach the basic skills of the ukulele to primary school children, and I will try to create opportunity for this in the future, along with other instruments and concepts in music as “the intention is to also build children’s confidence in these areas as they progress” (Bloomfield and Childs, 2002). This not only develops my own confidence but can develop children’s confidence, which is a key concept within the arts and it should be developed in children whenever possible (McAullife, 2007). Learning some kind of instrument in school is a fantastic skill for children and the ukulele is one of the instruments that can be taught to young people. It is a very good choice to introduce to children due to the fact that it is small and is relatively cheap for a school to purchase a set, when compared to other options. The size is one of the best benefits of the ukulele with very young children being able to hold it properly without too much difficulty.\n\nWe were given time to practise with a couple of songs made up of just a few chords. By showing children that this is possible, they build confidence and have a sense of achievement. Furthermore, the four chords concept can be shown in the video below, as a future educator I would love to be able to re-create something like this in my classroom:\n\nFollowing on from this, in the dance workshop today we built our confidence and sense of achievement by bringing together our dance routines we created last week using the theme of Christmas. Today we brought them together and added in moves at the start and the end of the routine as well as a travelling move to allow each group to get on the stage to perform. After we rehearsed the routine two or three times we filmed the routine and performed it as a sense of achievement. Therefore, as a cohort we were able to look back at our performance and watch the finish product. Again, this boosted my confidence as I was really impressed with the overall performance and how creative it looked from the outside. Craft (2007) believes that the sense of ownership encourages people to take responsiblity for and strive to further develop the skills and knowledge they have gained during an experience.\n\nOverall, I have extremely enjoyed the Integrated Arts module and I have found it highly stimulating. As a prospective teacher I have a real passion for the arts and would love to be able to share my skills in the arts with learners. My goal is to develop a classroom where pupils have the confidence, creative skills and imagination to gain a sense of achievement from a piece of work.\n\nReferences\n\nBloomfield, A. and Childs, J.

We looked our role as as a creative dance teacher and how we should promote dance in a school. Our role as a teacher is to believe in the validity of children’s creativity, as Education Scotland (2013) states that children suggests creativity is about exploring the uniqueness of individuals and being able to express ideas freely. As a future educator, I strongly agree with these children and I am determined to encourage creativity within my classroom through Dance and the arts education. During the lecture we also considered Smith-Autard’s (2002) Midway Model for Dance in Schools. By examining the model it showed that the process and product of dance is equal and as educators we must be able to understanding the the meaning of expressive dance but should also have fun while doing so. We then discussed that the 10 basic skills of dance would be an excellent way for children to begin to create a dance with and then use their imagination and creativity to come up with an efficient routine.\n\nDuring this mornings lecture on creative dance we discussed the benefits of dance and what the teachers role is while combining this with Theresa Cone’s reading. Within school and out with school I have had a lot of experience in Dance though participating in dance and teaching it. Therefore, many of the benefits dance can bring is something I have always been aware of such as being a way people can exercise and keep fit. Through this module it has allowed me to forget the misconception of dance being classes as a sport and to value dance as another creative process in the arts programme that children can use to express their feelings and emotions. Gilbert (2005) states that many people believe dance is something that should be taught by P.E teachers. However, after this lecture, I completely disagree with this statement as a teacher I should have the ability to give children the skills and knowledge required to make a ‘creative dance’.\n\nFollowing on from this, we participated in a dance workshop where we had to work in groups and create a dance with the chosen theme of christmas. With regards to this, we had to plan the dance based on a model created by Cone (2009). We had to consider the title of the dance, the characters, a storyline, the level of age group performing it and any props and costumes that were needed. My group and I decided to make the dance about elves preparing toys on Christmas Eve however Jack Frost then appears and freezes all the elves to try and ruin Christmas. But Santa came a long and saved the day at the end of the dance. We created the dance using the 10 Basic skills of dance as well as adding different conventions such as cannon and freezing. Therefore, in order to create this dance and stick to the story line we had to think about various different scenarios such as facial expressions, movements and reactions of the different characters. This suggests that the process of creative dance is extremely important as it takes a lot of work to try and get the balance of all these features right. Moving forward, it is clear that the product of the dance is equally important as they must be able to pull all of these strings together to get a successful outcome. Next week, we will perform and video our products to the rest of our cohort.\n\nWe then had our drama input where we took part in various different drama lessons lead by our colleagues. This week my group and I led our session that was based on the children’s story book ‘Prince Cinders’ by Babette Cole. I extremely enjoyed this input as my colleagues were really engaged throughout our lesson and it went much better than we were expecting it to. Following from last week micro-teaching, my group and I tried to take on board the crit that was given and ensure we were doing our best to make it an enjoyable learning experience. At all times I made sure everyone was paying attention and ensured my voice was loud enough so that everyone in the room was able to hear me. I made sure that my group and I adhered to the timings we had set giving our colleagues enough time to have discussions. Overall, the lesson went extremely well and gave us practise of general teaching skills as well as teaching he subject of drama. By analysing each character in the book we used this to form the process of the drama and valued the feedback of each our our colleagues as the product.\n\nTodays inputs has allowed myself to value the process and the product of drama and dance with the Integrated arts programme and show how equally important they are. In order to value the effectiveness of the process we should be able to look back at the final product and evaluate them (QCA, 2004).\n\nReferences\n\nCone, T.

London: A & C Black Publishers Ltd.\n\nToday in the Integrated Arts module I had music first where we were learning to make a beat when creating or playing a piece of music. We were given a set of beaters and asked to play the beats that the lecturer gave on our knees or on the floor. We had a discussion about the different musical notes however, to make it easier for us the notes were first expressed as a symbol. For instance, a square represented a crochet as this only has one beat and square has one syllable as well as a circle which represented two quavers as this has two beats the same as the two syllables in the word circle. This would be an excellent way for children and young people to start learning music instead of trying to teach them the various different notes. This is a simpler strategy that can be used and can build children’s self-esteem within music which is a very important part of the arts(Education Scotland, 2013). Furthermore, we then listened and played the beats of the symbols to the music provided. Julie explained that this part of a series of lessons would be for first level learners where the number of notes in the music was small. However, we then went on to look at the second level where the number of notes in a piece of music increased, the various different note names and how we could remember these for example, ‘Every Good Boy Deserves Football’ for the notes EGBDF. As a class we played along with the music following the notes. Our lecturer then discussed that these lessons would be done over a period of time and we learned all this in just one short input even though a lot of us were getting confused and muddling the notes up. Sir Ken Robinson(2006) discusses that you must be prepared to be wrong and if you don’t prepare to be wrong than the outcome will never be as good and nothing original will be made. I feel this is extremely important when it comes to music as it can take a long time to get use to the notes and the pieces of music. However, we learned this in a short space of time where as children will be learning this over a period of time in school which will hopefully encourage and inspire them to become interested in music.\n\nWithin this input my group and I discussed the opportunities this can bring to children. By removing the conventional notation and replacing this with shapes this is removing a barrier to the children’s learning. Children and young people may find this an easier way to get use to the type of music without getting confused about the notes, in turn this will increase their confidence and allow them to develop in the subject of music.\n\nThis lead on to my second input of today, Visual art. In todays session we reflected on our time at placement and our experiences we have had of the arts in our school. Reflection is a very important process within the arts as it gives children new awareness, knowledge and challenges , which can lead to more effective practice within arts education (Burnard, 2006). It was clear that some people in the group had experienced very little of the arts lessons and others had many examples of lessons they had experienced. I found this input very beneficial as a future educator, it gave me loads of creative and fun ideas I would like to try in my classroom. For example, using real life situations and scenes as a stimulus to an art lesson and providing learners with various materials to do so. One particular example I loved was using an art lesson to teach children about the events of the Titanic; giving children the materials to produce different parts of the ship. This led onto the impact of myth within the arts as this is a mystery than children can explore and use their imagination and thought process to create a piece of art work. We spoke about fire fox and how this is what makes the Northern lights, this gave me an idea for an arts lesson that will allow children to be creative.\n\nWe then went on to discuss the Finland project, where primary schools in Finland use natural resources such as sand and snow in their art lessons. I loved this idea of using materials that were already provided to us to give children a very memorable way of learning. This idea was to prevent the costs of arts and remove the barrier of arts relying on resources within the school for it to work. This way of learning in the arts also promotes sustainability and outdoor learning, an exciting opportunity for children to develop their creative thoughts. Cindy Foley(2014) discusses in her TED Talk video that allowing children to play and explore with materials generates the best idea which is a central part of creativity. This then triggered discussion within my group about the various different learning opportunities and lessons this could open up to. Going out in the snow or going to the beach can also provide a literacy lesson opportunity by considering sensory experiances to then return to the classroom and write a review on the beach or the snowy environment and how the five different senses will encourage people to go to this place. This shows that an art lesson can lead into various different areas within the curriculum.\n\nIn conclusion, from todays inputs it is clear that removing barriers can better a learning opportunity within the arts. As well as this, the cost of materials should not let down arts education, as I have said previously natural materials can create just as good as a response as ones that cost money. In music, we can use beaters and tables or the floor to create sound and in visual art we can use outdoors to flourish our creativity. Both of these inputs have also worked on the skill of team work. Education Scotland (2013) suggested that most children love working in a group as they can share thoughts and ideas. Therefore, by allowing a group of young people to come together and work as one, they will have the ability to create an imaginative piece of art.\n\nReferences\n\nEducation Scotland (2013) Creativity Across Learning 3-18.

The pupils were in primary 6/7 and are part of a string orchestra that has been an on going project since they were in primary 4. Each pupil had been given a specific string instrument to learn and practice with over the course of the years as a class to come together as a whole orchestra and perform at various locations. With this in mind, the pupils don’t actually have the chance to perform individually as this is a full class project that has been made to include everyone, the pupils perform and rehearse as a class. This is a link to a short video clip about the Greenmill String Project:\n\nGreenmail String Project\n\nThis video highlights the numerous benefits this project has on the children of Greenmill Primary School. In todays workshop it was clear what some of these benefits are which led on to a discussion. I particularly noticed that the pupils were very well behaved and engaged in their learning as well as the delivery of teaching. The video explains that improvements have been made in behaviour and general inclusion within the class which is a huge benefit to the learning environment. As well as this the video discusses that the children have worked with various adults and taught them how to play instruments. This gives the children a sense of achievement and increases their confidence. This was apparent today as we became the learners and the pupils became the professionals by showing and teaching us how to play their instrument. Harris (2016) argues that children are somewhat responsible of leading us towards a more creative and interactive ways in education. I agree with this as each child today had the ability to teach students how to play an instrument using their own warm up games and activities throughout the lesson, encouraging our creative side as teachers to shine. Therefore, I feel that as the child’s confidence grows throughout this project the more confident they will get which will increase their creativity.\n\nFollowing on from this, the second workshop I had today was Drama. Where we were encouraged to be confident and flourish our creativity further. Today we had to participate in lessons created by two other groups of my fellow students as part of a micro-teaching lesson. My group and I are carrying out our lesson next week and therefore, after todays lessons I must take on board their weaknesses to try and lead an effective lesson. Todays lessons used different drama conventions to describe well known story books and to explore various different parts of the story. During each lesson many of the recent drama conventions we have previously learned was used to engage the learning and create a better understanding of the story. Booth(1985) explains that when children read they can relate to feelings and attitudes and general experiences they’ve had in life however, when children do interactive drama this helps children develop in a different way. Drama is a way of learning in a different context and giving children a new and deeper understanding of a story. This also gives children who lack ability in literacy and reading the chance to learn and understand a story through drama. Looking back at my time at school, a lot of people lacked confidence when it came to drama and didn’t like the idea of having an audience watch them perform. However, drama would not teach anything to anyone if children don’t make the effort to perform (Ackroyd-Pilkington, 2001). To prevent children from being shy they could perform in groups to each other rather than performing in front of a whole class. As Grainger (2003, p.p 44) says “drama is the art form of social encounters.”\n\nOverall, todays workshops of music and drama has allowed me to generate ideas for future teaching and bring out my creative side. At school, I was not the best at drama and music and felt like these subjects were my weakest. Now that I have had the chance to perform in each I feel a lot more confident and relaxed in these areas. As a future educator, I would love to able to share these feelings towards music and drama to my learners.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris, A. (2016) Creativity and Education.

Neelands (2000) believes that drama conventions used in classrooms not only provides children with different experiences of form but can be used to provides them with knowledge on various other areas of the curriculum. We started todays workshop by bringing in the theme of Halloween as we felt this would be an appropriate topic given it is Halloween today. However, this is a workshop that could have been done the exact same with a different topic for example, Remembrance day.\n\nWe began by revisiting the convention of teacher in role where the lecturer acted as teacher in role. We listened to a story about Holmwood house, a house that is now up for sale as it has been abandoned. There had been many accusations about this house and the many incidents that appeared to have happened. The villagers(students) were asked if they could stay in the house for one night to see if these incidents were true and was promised a sum of money if they did. However, only 3 of the villagers said they would stay in the house with the rest of the villagers too frightened to attend. This sort of situation could happen in a primary class setting where only a couple of children would agree to attend it is then myself, as the teacher, job to question why the other children don’t want to stay at the house. Drama is a subject that has no right outcome, the drama can be taken in so many directions depending on the children’s reaction to the story. I feel that this has made me feel a lot more at ease when teaching and talking about drama as the children potentially create their own drama with my assistance. We then decided as a group that everyone should go to the house to stay. In groups, we were then asked to create part of a drama about a person entering the house using slow motion. This convention is used to emphasise part of the drama, such as the person entering the house and being faced with zombies ready to chase them. Children would be really engaged with this convention as children love to exaggerate and be imaginative especially when it comes to being able to make up their own part of the drama.\n\nWe then moved on to the conventions flashback and flash forward. These conventions mean exactly what they say. We had to act out drama using narration to explain what the incidents actually were and prove that people weren’t just making up rumours about the house. After this, in groups we then carried out another drama about what happened when people went to the house many years later. The use of narration allows the audience(children) to know exactly what is happening in the drama and to give the children some understanding and time to reflect. Before performing our drama, we discussed how it felt waiting on other groups performing. Many people said they felt nervous however, I would say that I felt quite at ease watching other people perform as I knew everyone in the class was feeling the same way. I feel this is very important to address in the classroom, as some children can become quite anxious and worried when others are performing. They might feel not good enough however, as a teacher, I would reassure the learners that everyone is in the same position and although drama is fun it is also a serious subject.\n\nWe then questioned if we were given enough time to prepare our drama before we were asked to perform. I feel that communicating and having learning conversations with children is essential to know exactly how they are feeling. As a teacher, it is my responsibility to question the learners about their experience and also ask if they need more time to plan and prepare when it comes drama. Communicating is key when it comes to creativity and choice, as some children will need more time than others to create a drama and to get the best out their learning experience.\n\nThis led to our final discussion in the drama workshop. We looked at another convention, Forum Theatre, however we didn’t actually get time to carry this out. Forum Theatre is a convenion created by Augusto Boal to teach people how to change the world around them. This convention is used in drama where the audience(children) stops the performance and suggests different ways/actions that can be carried out in an attempt to change the outcome of the drama. In a classroom setting, I feel that this convention would give children the idea that they can make change in anything they do. Change is something that a lot of children don’t like however, I feel that this is a way to teach children that in some cases change can work out for the better rather than the worst. Children can take advantage of the freedom they have with this convention and consider the consequences the drama has already entailed (Heath and Gilbert, 2015).\n\nAfter the drama workshop, we then had music. We began by focusing on the use of the voice and how this can impact teaching within a classroom setting. The use of the voice as a teacher is extremely important, we discussed that the voice is used for almost everything and it is essential that we should look after our voice. We went over the best possible ways to take care of your voice and things to avoid, such as shouting. As a teacher, to be able to get the learners attention can often prove difficult however, I now aware of things I can do to get their attention without shouting such as getting them to respond to a clap rhythm.\n\nOur lecturer showed us different starter exercises and warm-up games that can be used in class to warm up our voices before the teaching day begins or before singing. We discussed the importance of warming up our muscles before singing so that we don’t damage our voice. I loved the Penguin song, a song that can be used as a vocal warm-up or as a warm-up game to settle a class. This song is a fun way way of to warm-up our voices and muscles as well as develop the children’s co-ordination and right and lefts. As I looked round the class I could tell every one of my peers was engaged in the song and learned the lyrics so quickly by following Julie’s role. Therefore, if adults enjoyed this song, it is more than likely that children will quickly become engaged in the song and settle them for a day of learning.\n\nWe also completed some breathing exercises, such as taking a breath for four seconds, holding it for four seconds then releasing the breath for 20 seconds ensuring all of the air was released from our lungs. This led to discussion about our lungs and how they function when breathing. I feel that this could be used in the classroom to highlight to learners how our organs work and the importance of our lungs. Following o from this, we completed several fun exercises to warm up our face and voice, such as pretending to chew a large piece of toffee. I feel that children would be really imaginative and enjoy these exercise, creating a fun but beneficial lesson for the full class to participate in.\n\nLastly, within the music workshop we discussed graphic scores. Before this workshop I had never heard of graphic scores or how they worked. I found this concept extremely interesting and thought of many ways I could use this across the curriculum. Graphic scores consist of using sounds to relate to a chosen theme. The sounds could be made through different instruments, the children’s voices and sound effects. We first of all made a graphic score with the whole class contributing, we related this graphic score to the theme of fireworks. We began by thinking of words that represented sounds then plotted them on the grid depending on where we wanted them to go. We then thought about how many beats we wanted each instrument to play and changed the dynamics to create a dramatic ending. I chose the tambourine to represent the sound ‘Bang’. As Julie pointed along the grid, the person with the instrument that represented the sound would play. I found that this activity encouraged creativity and would give children the sense of freedom to choose how they would like their sound to be represented. We were then given the chance to create our own graphic score relating to our choice of theme, which of course had to be christmas. We picked our sounds and instruments and performed our graphic score in front of the class.\n\nThis activity not only triggered an idea for a music lesson but also allowed me to think of different areas of the curriculum I could use this activity for. This lesson could be part of a sequnce for example, when studying a certain topic this would be the perfect music lesson that could easily relate to the topic of study. My group and I also discussed that graphic scores can be used as part of a maths lesson. The grid can be used to introduce grid referencing to a class to give children the knowledge and understanding of position and locations on a grid using a fun, creative activity.\n\nOverall, I feel that todays inputs provide a perfect opportunity for IDL. Learners who lack confidence in subjects like maths or literacy can learn through other areas of the curriculum they enjoy such as music and drama. Marshall(2014) discusses that by teaching with an integrated approach, children can relate their knowledge and learning experiences to previous knowledge that has been already learned.\n\nReferences\n\nHeath, S. and Gilbert, L.

We discussed how drama can connect with other areas of the curriculum for example, literacy, from last weeks in put the children could create and write an invite to the dragon asking how to attend our party. Drama could also link up with an art lesson as learners could draw a picture of what they think the dragon looks like or paint a picture of the path up to the dragons house we walked through in last weeks input. An important tip I received from today was to always allow time for pupils to think. Our lecturer explained that we must wait long enough to allow learners brains to process the question being asked. “Silence can be powerful…thinking about films.” (Ball, 2003). I love this quote as it shows that even though silence can be awkward at times, it also creates a sense of power and allows us to question ‘what comes next?’. We also discussed that if there still was no response to the question we, as teachers have asked what could we do to solve the problem? It was suggested that we could rephrase the question or in some cases just pick a person to answer. I found the tip extremely useful as I would have always panicked if no one answered a question I asked.\n\nFollowing on from this, we were introduced to five new concepts, namely: vox pop, role on the wall, thought tracking, voice in head and mime. The lecturer began by explaining the situation between two characters. He explained that the brother winds the sister up a lot and the sister is fed up of him annoying her. We then had to create a role on the wall. In groups we were given two pieces of paper and had to draw outlines of the character. We then had to write words around the outside of each character describing how the character felt. This concept allows learners to think about how others would feel and try to look at things from the opposing view. The lecturer then read out the story ‘The tunnel’ about the boy and the girl. He then stopped and asked us to mime and use voice in head to tell part of the story. Myself and my partner, had to act as the girl and boy and had to mime part of the story then say what we thought of each other. I liked this concept as it allowed us to hear what each other was thinking. I feel that children would enjoy this part of drama as they could relate with some of the topics and share how they really feel. Following on from this, we spoke about thought tunnel, which is very similar to voice in head however, thought tracking only one person says something and the other person must respond. We then listened to the rest of the story and reconsidered the role on the wall sheets. We discussed how our views have changed on the characters by the end of the story and wrote these words down the paper. I feel that this would be something to do in a classroom setting as it allows learners to see that everyone has a story to tell and that everyone can change. It also allows learners to realise that you should never judge someone too quick. We never actually demonstrated VOX pop but we had a discussion about it. The teacher would usually act as a reporter of the drama and interview the children about how they feel. This concept would allow children to really open up about their emotions and in some cases reveal their feelings not just the characters.\n\nBefore we finished up the drama workshop, we had to act out in groups using any of the 10 conventions we learned from the past two inputs a part of the story that no one had heard. I feel that this would allow learners to create their own part of the story and creates a sense of freedom when it comes to drama. This would prevent drama from being structured and allow children and their creative minds to make something that they can relate to on a personal level. Craft(2013) argues that too much structure can restrict children’s self determination and lock them out their creative process.\n\nThe second input today was Dance, where we began by playing starter games incorporating the theme of halloween. One of the games we played was zombie Tig, when we were tug we had to do a zombie action until someone froze us. We then completed a warm up dance to the songs ‘Thriller’ and ‘Time Warp’ which are popular songs. Using well known songs in school would allow children to relax and get their adrenaline going as they already know the songs and some of their famous dance moves.\n\nWe then went over the dance we completed last week to refresh our memory. Afterwards, we stood in a circle and had to come up with a dance move for numbers 0-9. We then returned to our groups and completed several maths calculations and whatever answer we got this would make the order of the dance with the moves we just came up with. Involving other parts of the curriculum into dance would benefit the children who are maybe the least confident in dance but good at maths for example. The lecturer also explained that a group member could write down their mobile number and this would give a different order of the moves however, this might not work in a primary setting as some children don’t have mobile phones.\n\nIn addition to this, each group was given a symbol and asked to create a dance move that relates to the symbol. My group had a cat symbol and came up with a roaring arm action as if the cat was striking. Each symbol related to halloween however, this could be used with any topics that a class is studying. We then added all of these moves together and danced to a halloween themed song. By allowing children to come up with their own dance moves, gives them control over their own learning and gives opportunities of control and power (Harris, 2016). We then incorporated all of the moves we came up with to the dance we made last week to have a full class dance. This would allow each child the chance to perform and be seen on the stage instead of hiding at the back. The dance had little teacher input and therefore, learners would feel extremely proud of the dance they had made up.\n\nOverall, todays inputs of dance and drama have allowed my creativity to flourish through various themes like halloween and story books. In order to be creative we need to be able to adapt to our settings and have an open mind, I feel that dance and drama gives children the freedom to do so (Harris, 2016).\n\nReferences\n\nCraft, A (2007) Creativity and possibility in the Early Years [Online] Available: https://www.tactic.org.uk/pdfs/reflection-craft.pdf [Accessed 28 September 2017]\n\nHarris, A. (2016) Creativity and Education. [Online] London: Palgrave Macmillan. Available: UWS Library. [Accessed 22 October 2017]\n\nIn todays input, I had the music workshop first where we considered the theatrical side of music and its importance in children’s education. We began by discussing the benefits music can have on children by giving them new skills and improving their education. Music can act as a way of bringing people together to form common interests. We touched on the various different aspects of music such as the instruments, notes, technology and listening. These aspects are all completely different and we spoke about how each aspect can have a different effect on a piece of music. Music is a way that children can share interests through and a way many children will relax and rely on. Anne Harris (2016) argues that learners are capable of leading us towards a more creative and interactive learning in education and I feel that music is an opportunity for that. Many children are so passionate about music and how they have so much freedom to create a piece of work so unique to them.\n\nSecondly, we looked at how music can help develop skills not only in music but across the full curriculum. We looked at a paper in the International Journal of Music Education(2010) by Hallam. This paper highlights various topics that music can impact upon namely: literacy, numeracy, creativity, general attainment, social and personal development, intellectual development and perceptual and language skills. In groups we took one of these topics each to study, my group discussed how literacy is impacted by music. I discovered that it has been proven that music helps with phonological awareness and basic reading skills. Therefore, children who are involved or have a musical back ground are more likely to have better reading and phonological skills. You can discriminate reading patterns by sounding out syllables through stamping and clapping which is a relation with music. A study also suggest, learning to play the piano increases verbal sequencing and increases vocabulary, I found this fact extremely interesting as I would never have thought playing a musical instrument can increase your vocabulary. As well as this, we discovered that playing music can benefit children with dyslexia as it can improve general perception language skills, timing and verbal memory. Therefore it is clear that music has the ability to change and benefit peoples literacy skills especially those with a learning disability like Dyslexia.\n\nIn addition to this, in our groups we came up with a unique lesson plan that involves music and literacy. As we have just studied how music can benefit reading skills we decided to base our lesson plan on reading and different levels of reading groups to do this. We came up with the idea of the children creating a short piece of music based on their class reading book, the music must involve the beginning, middle and end of their book. The children would use the app ‘Garage band’ to complete this task which is involving technology into the lesson as well.\n\nMusic Lesson Plan\n\nThe next workshop we had today was Dance. This was the first input we had on Dance and we began by passing a sheet of paper round the class and writing down our feelings towards teaching dance. The word I wrote was ‘excited’ as dance has been a huge part of my life and I would love to be able to pass the passion I have for dance onto pupils in my classroom. However, most of my peers were extremely nervous when it came to dance and I then realised that this might be how pupils feel when they are first asked to dance. We began by playing some ‘ice breaker’ challenges to try and release any awkwardness and nerves that my group had. One game was a follow the leader type where the person at the front started a dance move according to the type of music being played and the rest of the class had to follow. Another game we played was a Scottish themed version of Tig, I found this game beneficial as it could be changed to suit any topic that the children are studying in the classroom. The final game we played we had to sit in a circle and each person had to go into the middle of the circle and say their name while holding a pose. Some people became very anxious as the game and we then discussed how we could prevent children from being shy and worried when doing dance. We came up with going up in groups instead of individually, or in some cases if they are worried about dance moves give them a move to do. These starter games would allow children to become more comfortable in a dance setting.\n\nIt is vital to stretch our muscles before completing any type of dancing to save any injuries and to allow children to learn about the different parts of our body. Befo re we stretched, we had to consider the different types of bones, muscles and organs and where they are in our body.\n\nWe then explored the 10 essential dance skills that we, as teachers should be able to do: reach, balance, turn, kick, jump, hop, gesture, slide and roll. These ten basic skills are put in place to allow primary teachers to adapt to different levels and teach children the basic dance moves. In groups, we moved round each dance skill and came up with a movement for each. Once we had been round them all we added all of the moves together and created our own dance. This could be done in a classroom and all the individual group dances could be added together and could be shown at assembly for example.\n\nDance is a subject that people can find daunting, however by using these ten skills those with less confidence has the ability to come up with a dance that can reflect their own feelings and thoughts. Smith(2009) suggests that arts in school can close the attainment gap. ‘Y dance’ is programme that is now put in place in loads of schools that encourages children to take part in dance as well as closing the attainment gap of those from areas of deprivation(Scottish Youth dance, 2017). Therefore, it is clear that dance has been made part of the curriculum to benefit children as much as possible.\n\n“One of the most powerful experiences that dance education can offer children is the opportunity to create a dance that reflects their own ideas” (Cone, 2009, p.81)\n\nDance allows children to express their emotions in a different form without having to verbally explain how they feel. I am glad the dance is now part of the curriculum, as a future educator, I will discover a lot more about children’s back ground by their creativity in dance.\n\nIn todays inputs, music and dance, I feel that I now have understanding of how various different subjects can link up within the curriculum. I now have loads of different lesson ideas that I can use in the classroom as well as new ideas.\n\nReferences\n\nCraft, A (2007) Creativity and possibility in the Early Years [Online] Available: https://www.tactic.org.uk/pdfs/reflection-craft.pdf [Accessed: 8 October 2017]\n\nCone, T (2009) Following Their Lead: Supporting Children’s Ideas for Creating Dances, Journal of Dance Education [Online] Vol.9(3), pp.81-89.

We were asked to expand our prints from last week by photocopying one of our prints to a smaller size on an A4 sized piece of paper. We then filled in the rest of the blank paper around the painting by drawing and adding colour if you wanted to. This activity allowed me to go wild with my creativity and imagination as there was no certain outcome that the drawing should look like, every other students drawing was different from my own. I feel that this activity would give pupils a sense of freedom in the classroom as there is no expectations for them to follow. Tolerance of outcome is extremely important when completely this task as every child’s painting will be unique and as a teacher I will encourage learners to be unique as often as possible. When I looked around the class every one of my peers was completely engaged with this task. Csiksgentmihalyi (1997) discusses that a creative individual must be full of energy and up for any activity to be able to concentrate and be enthusiastic. I feel that this activity was the perfect way to allow pupils of all ability to engage in and produce a creative piece of art. Children would be able to use any materials or colours they would like which would encourage children’s creative side to really shine. We also discussed how important it was to give children time to complete their work without rushing it or leaving it unfinished. Time constraints in primary schools are so common as there is so much to do in such little time. This is the number one prohibitor of creativity in schools and teachers must allow time for the arts(Harris, 2016). We were given as much time as we needed to complete our drawing and for us to be happy with it. Unfortunately, I never got any pictures of this activity.\n\nFollowing on from this activity, we had the opportunity to look at children’s colouring books. We discussed the fact that appreciation for colouring in is no longer there and there is no meaning for children to sit down and colour in different shapes and objects. The first book I looked was a book for boys as supposedly boys are not as creative and interested in art than girls. I found this extremely interesting as I had never acknowledged this fact until now. I then looked at this book which provides a starting point where the children can draw from reflecting on a starting point of their creativity. Children would be able to use their imagination as well as having the satisfaction of creating something new from the starting point. The book forces the child’s creativity and imaginative thinking by providing a sentence at the top of the page to instruct them on what to draw. I feel that this book will develop children’s confidence when it comes to art as it gives them some guidance but still encourages them to be creative.\n\nDuring this workshop, we also watched a video clip of ‘Room 13’ which explained that children use this ‘room’ as a place to go and view different pieces of art which will provide ideas for children to create art.\n\nThe second workshop we had was music where we were introduced to the app Garage Band. At first I thought this app was quite complicated to work but after a few minutes of looking around I was totally engrossed with the app and how it worked. We were told to create our own eight-bar piece of music using three different instruments. We explored the various different sounds that the instruments made and changed the volume depending on our preference. I used the electric piano, grand and tambouring.\n\nI feel that this sort of activity would really engage children in music and allow their creativity to shine by exploring the various different sounds the app can make. This app will also give children confidence as it is a simple way to create your own effective piece of music using technology as a guide line instead of basic musical instruments. Technology is often seen as a bad thing in education, Anne Harris (2016) explains that technology can do the thinking for people which creates a barrier to creativity. However, I feel this app would benefit many children in classes who find music as their weakest subject. This app can be used in other areas of the curriculum that tie in with music for example, using this app to show how they feel through a creative piece of music or telling a story through a piece of music.\n\nTo conclude, I found todays workshops extremely beneficial as the one thing they both had in common was developing a child’s confidence in creativity. I feel that as a teacher, I must have the ability to bring the best out in every child and be able to increase children’s confidence in struggling areas as much as possible to inspire them to be creative.\n\nReference\n\nCsikszentmihalyi, M. (1996) Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention. New York: Harper Collins.\n\nHarris, A. (2016) Creativity and Education. London: Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nIn todays lecture, we discussed the painting the Windows in the West and using this as a stimulus as Inspiration for Creation. This allows learners to look at real-life situations and be inspired by the work to go away and create their own.\n\nAfter studying the painting of the Windows in the West in our visual arts workshop we were given an A5 polestyrine sheet and asked to draw a part of the painting on the sheets ensuring that we covered the whole area. After completing this we used paint rollers to paint the sheet of polystyrene then has to transfer the painting onto a piece of A5 paper to make a print. We completed this another four times using the same colour of paint however with different coloured paper each time to show the different effects the back ground colour can do to the painting. We then had the chance to add any more drawings on our polystyrene sheet and pop out random sections. Finally, we used different coloured paint to go over the sheet of polystyrene and print this different colour of paint onto our original copy for an amazing effect and contrast of colours. The following pictures follow this process:\n\nUsing this painting as a stimulus as Inspiration for creation proved that everyones creativity is different. At the end of the process we looked around at each other paintings and realised that every single persons outcome was different. Therefore this shows that everyone looks at things differently and we all see different perspectives. Anna Craft (2007) discusses the idea of ‘possibility thinking’ which means that by giving children a stimulus to work from were are allowing them to think for themselves and create there own piece of work from this. I would definitely use this lesson in my future classroom as I feel that learners are able to express their own thoughts and creativity after examining the painting and processing the different ways in which they can build on their own imagination from this activity. In addition to this, the use of prints allows learners to adapt their work. At the beginning of the task I actually turned over my polystyrene to start again as I was not happy with what I drew in the first place. This was a massive learning curve for me as I realised there and then that nothing can be perfect and art is simply a way of doing. I then turned my piece back over and used what I originally had. However, prints allow children to change or swap colours to improve their work and increase their satisfaction with their work instead of starting from the beginning. Lehrer(2012) speaks about redraft as something that is essential when creating something that you’ve never done before. I agree with this, coming from someone that would constantly change their drawings or rub out their work in art in school.\n\nToday was our first day drama input where we used the story of a dragon as a stimulus as inspiration for Creation. We began the input by discussing our thoughts and our experiences of drama whether it be in school or out-with school. Unfortunately, I did not have much experience of drama at school and therefore, I was a little apprehensive about doing drama and of course teaching it in the future. However, this input has calmed my nerves a lot and has allowed me to see the many benefits of teaching drama at school. Drama allows people to be someone else and gives you the chance to see what life can be like in another persons shoes. I love this idea as learners would be able to feel and see certain views and problems people address in life in another light. As a future educator, I would like to have the ability to teach learners that everyone has a different story to tell and not everyone has the same opinions and I feel that drama is a subject that would teach this. I feel this quote sums up arts learning as a whole but after todays session I now see the huge advantage that drama can bring to learners in school:\n\n“Arts learning can also improve motivation, concentration, confidence, and teamwork. ” (Smith, 2009, n.p)\n\nAll four of these factors can be developed in not only a drama lesson but any Arts lesson. Using a stimulus for creation through drama will give learners the ability to think for themselves without a teacher firing long, boring facts at them.\n\nDuring our drama input today we covered four useful teaching points in drama: teacher in role, freeze frames, improvisation and thought tunnel. We began by taking on the role being villagers who were being traumatised and upset by a dragon that was flying lowly one their village and breathing fire, destroying many of their homes. One tip for teaching drama is to always ensure that the drama is child-friendly. Our lecturer began to explain that this was a social problem between relationships that we needed to fix. Teresa Grainger(2003) believes that drama can not only solve but create social problems and I agree with this. This allows learners to stop and gain an understanding of peoples backgrounds before judging them, for example why the dragon was blowing fire at the villagers. Andrew, began by calling a meeting with the villagers by acting as the mayor using teacher in role. Teacher in role is used when a drama is being introduced and the teacher must act as a character to show the learner the drama. At the meeting we discussed what we were going to do to save the village and stop the dragon from destroying it. In groups we used freeze frame to come up with a tribal dance to warn off the dragon. A freeze frame is when the group poses in a certain position and one person would step out and discuss what was going on. Unfortunately this technique did not work and another meeting was called. We then found out where the dragon lived and agreed that we should go and talk to the dragon to allow it to give us an explanation. We used another technique, improvisation, to act out us climbing up the mountain over rivers, through long grass to get to its house. When we arrived we used hot seating to question the dragon why she was flying so low and breathing fire on our village. We then discovered that the dragon in fact was not deliberately destroying our homes, it was lonely and loved to fly down and watch the villagers. The dragon explained that it got too excited and breathed fire. Finally, we discussed how we could help the dragon and agreed that we should invite the dragon down into the village and made an agreement with the dragon not to get to excited and breathe fire. Looking at this lesson, children will gain the message that you must not judge a person until you know their whole story and that you can give people help and advice if you just ask. I found this input extremely fun and interesting because I could control what we done to the dragon the lesson was not in control by the teacher. As a teacher, in drama I should always give learners the chance to ask questions and question them into what they think is best. Anna Craft(2007) argues that possible thinking is how creativity is brought out the most in children. This lesson allowed children to value their own message instead of teachers putting information in their heads and getting misunderstandings or confusions.\n\nThought tunnel is the last technique we used where children can stand in two lines facing each other and the character of the drama must walk down the middle. Each child must either say a word or sentence about their thoughts and feelings towards the character. This was my favourite technique, from a teachers point of view this shows if the learners have understood the message behind the lesson.\n\nOverall, my opinion on drama has completely changed after this lesson and I feel that I now have the ability to teach drama confidently in the future. I also love that drama is a subject that requires learners to work together and share thoughts and feelings with each other (Craft, 2007). I look forward to the next drama input to build my understanding more. When implementing an integrated arts programme, using stimulus’s can be very helpful for children’s learning as it allows them to develop their understanding of the arts and build on their own work.\n\nReferences\n\nAnna Craft (2007) Creativity and possibility in the Early Years(online) Available at: www.tactyc.org.uk/pdfs/reflection-craft.pdf [Accessed: 8 October 2017]\n\nSmith, F. (2009). Why Arts Education Is Crucial, and Who’s Doing It Best.

I found this particular input extremely interesting however, also very nerve racking because painting and drawing in art as well as playing musical instruments were aspects I found extremely challenging at school.\n\nIn the music workshop, we learned and discussed the use of Figure Notes as an alternative to conventional music notes. I did not have much experience of music in primary school or secondary school and therefore, I have never been able to read conventional notation of music. At school, I always felt nervous in a music classroom as I knew some of my peers played musical instruments and could read music really well. However, after believing that I would never be able to read any form of music this input has changed my views on music completely. Figure Notes are symbols that represent a music note, for example the colour yellow represents the note ‘C’ and a yellow coloured triangle would represent a high note. Other easy to understand symbols are used to show how long a note is, or if there is a pause in a song. My group and I played the following songs when experimenting with Figure notes:\n\nWe also discussed a few benefits of why we think Figure Notes would be a great solution to music teaching in the classroom:\n\nThe vast majority of students within my class was able to pick up the way in which Figure Notes work in a matter of minutes. I think this is a very effective teaching aid and a simple way to allow learners to develop their music skills, as it removes barriers which many young people struggle to over come. In addition to this, Figure Notes can allow learners to be creative and use their imagination to make their own music and sounds. During the input we removed the B and F keys(see picture) from our glockenspiels to show that we could create a tune that would play in tune along with a piano. As we played the glockenspiel the lecturer played the piano, therefore we created our own piece of music that fitted in exactly with the song. I found this part of the input extremely beneficial as I could use this technique in a classroom to give learners a confidence boost when it comes to music. (Hallam, 2010) believes that to be able to enhance creativity, music lessons need to be based around a creative activity and I feel this input has demonstrated this completely.\n\nFollowing on from this, it is evident that Figure Notes bring out the creative side of people through music. I think that it is a great idea that should be used in classrooms around the world to support learners with music. I agree with Cindy Foley(2014) who discusses in her TED Talk video that children should be able to develop their own ideas and imagination in a classroom. As a future educator, I must have the ability to allow children to be creative in every area of their learning whether it be through literacy or numeracy or a well structured music lesson.\n\nThrough visual art, this workshop again focused on creativity and how creative we can be when it comes to making art. In this art lesson we explored some of the alternative approaches which room 13 favours, I will speak more about that later. At first I was a bit hesitant as I was asked to paint in a way I have never painted before. Firstly, we were provided with various different materials, including a piece of willow which would be used as the base of the paint brush we were to make. I then used materials such as thread, feathers, foam shapes, a button and tape to stick all this together like shown below.\n\nI felt very confident with my paint brush as I was the one who created it using various shapes and textures for many different outcomes, I loved the feeing of unknowingness when it came to this task. The lecturer then described a painting aloud to the class and each person was to recreate what they imagined the painting to look like. I was allowed to choose any size, colour or texture of paper as well as being provided with three primary colours and white. We had to use these colours to experiment and mix to find the colour we required. Finally, using our hand made paint brushes we had to paint the picture that was described to us. As there was no right or wrong answer, as a result everyone created a unique, personal piece of art. Overall, this activity is something I would love to use in a classroom as it would give pupils a sense of freedom and individuality with their work, something I personally find crucial. I also found that tolerance or mess and tolerance of outcome is huge when dealing with this activity.\n\nAs I touched on earlier, today we looked at Room 13, which is a network of student organisation art studios where young people and professional artists exchange different skills and experiences.\n\n“on its own merits, free of prejudice or condescension” (Gibb, 2012, p.240)\n\nIn this organisation, there is no restriction on age and therefore every piece of work is judged by the quote above. The person involved is there to offer advice and support to those who need or ask for it. The organisation offers students advice and techniques to support their work rather than influencing it as this would destroy all creative aspects. Overall, I feel that todays inputs has gives me a real sense of the Arts in education, where no one is wrong everyone is just simply unique.\n\nReferences\n\nGibb, C. (2012).

International Journal of Music Education.\n\nAfter todays input I am becoming more intrigued in the Arts and beginning to develop a lot more knowledge and understanding that I will be able to put to practice as a teacher. Today we discussed in both, the lecture and workshops Childhood Development in the arts. I found this topic extremely interesting as I am now aware of the various stages children go through during an expressive arts programme. Before this lecture, I read a chapter of Fleming(2012) ‘The Arts in Education: an introduction to aesthetics, theory and pedagogy’ to give me some insight into this topic and summarise the teaching of the arts. I believe this chapter as a whole discussed the Arts as a benefit to the development of children.\n\nFollowing on from this, in the lecture we were shown how many artists have used visual representations of their text to show the meaning behind it. We were then given a page from the chapter I had previously read, and asked to annotate in visual representations of what we thought the most important part of that page was. Many of my peers drew one whole drawing to describe their page however, I felt that by doing numerous doodles on the page I could understand it more. For example, I drew a brain to represent ‘creativity and imagination’ that Fleming discussed as one of the most important aims of the arts education and a thinking bubble to show that art requires thinking skills. Unfortunately I never managed to get a picture of this. I found this task a fun way of understanding a piece of text using visual arts. I will definitely be willing to use this in a classroom as I feel pupils that struggle with literacy can use visual arts as a strength to develop their contextual understanding of a piece of writing. To summarise this, Fleming(2012) says:\n\n“You approach from one side and you know your way about; you approach the same place from the other side and you no longer know your way about”\n\nI love this quote as it has taught me that the Arts can be explored in different ways from different directions and everything doesn’t need to be the same as how other people see it, it is ok to be different. As a teacher when teaching the Arts I need to restrain from pointing my finger and directing the learners towards what I think is best and allow them to follow their own imagination and creativity to bring out the best in each individual learner.\n\nWe also discussed during the lecture about how important is it to expose children to expressive arts in the classroom. The Arts have been said to help children learn to say what cannot be said, make good judgements about qualitative relationships and to teach children that problems can have more than one solution (Eisner, 2002). The document below, “10 Lessons the Arts teach”, by Elliot Eisner (2002) not only provides insight into the importance of the arts but also, emphasizes the value of the Expressive Arts in allowing for the development of creativity in the classroom together with the importance of allowing for a creative process towards developing the individual learner.\n\nThis leads onto the workshop, where we looked at pupils artwork which were arranged according to their age and stage. We considered their skills, techniques, understanding, choices, thought process and materials used. At early level, more informally known as the ‘scribbling stage’ where children make whole- arm movements which can result in ripping the paper and appear to some as scribbles that has little of no meaning at all (McAuliffe, 2007). Although learners at this stage are usually a lot younger and therefore, they can describe they own drawing even though it may not look anything like that to us. As a teacher, McAuliffe (2007) suggests that questions should always be asked with awareness and ensure you listen to their response. Therefore, I have learned that I must encourage pupils in their creativity and value their work.\n\nAs pictured above, this child has used their own understandings of Art to create what they picture as a rain forest. This pupil has used oil based pastels and various different colours to complete the task. The teacher supplied the pupils with A3 size black paper to allow every colour the learner uses to be seen. I love this piece of work as it shows the learner knows that the grass would be on the bottom of the paper and the rain falling from the sky at the top of the paper, showing the interest in location of shapes.\n\nIn the first level, children are beginning to feel more pressured into ensuring what they do is the same as others and decide to question what is correct, in some cases copying can occur. The pictures below both demonstrate that the learners creativity and imagination is still their as they have not thought about perspectives. The picture on the left has been stated on the back by the class teacher that this is a piece of reflection. The learner has shown clearly that the trees would reflect down on the lake however, has not quite used the same colours to demonstrate this proving that their is still imagination and creativity occurring. I also noticed the various hair styles and different body shapes the figures have on the picture to the right, showing that the learner is beginning to add more features to people. At this stage children begin to feel dissatisfied with their work and can end up spending too much time trying to make it better (McAuliffe, 2007).\n\nLastly, I looked at art work created by second level pupils. I instantly noticed the amount of detail, time and effort put into each piece of work. However, it came to my attention that many of the pieces of art were copies of famous artists work proving the point that the higher the stage they are at the more self conscious learners are becoming over their own work and making copying other artists as they think this is ‘correct’.\n\nTaking this point into consideration, I strongly feel that as future educators it is our duty to allow creativity to flourish. Bloomfield and Childs agreed by stating teachers should nurture the creative self of a child, to facilitate their ideas and to help manifest the genius of their expression (Bloomfield & Childs, 2002).\n\nReferences\n\nEisner, E.

(2002) Teaching Integrated Arts in the Primary School. London: David Fulton Publishers.\n\nToday’s lecture and inputs explored in detail the use of music and visual arts to convey a message or tell a story. In the lecture, we focussed on how children may use mark making and sound making to create a story that is personal to them. One significant part we touched upon was that children tend to draw better with pen as children may never be satisfied with their drawing and use rubbers to constantly to rub out their work if they use pencil. By encouraging creativity and adopting good, healthy attitudes children will be able to express arts in many ways from mark making to delivering a detailed, imaginative piece of writing.\n\nI agree with Fleming (2012) beliefs that in schools the main priority of the arts is to give children self- expression and creativity: the children must be able to create and make art through their own imagination and free expression rather than copying the work of others. During one of the seminars we discussed the idea that you must be prepared to fail in order to achieve. I agree with this statement as not everyone follows the same paths and must be prepared for the worst at all times. After all if everyone copied the work of others no one would be unique. Following on from this, everyone has their own preconceptions and opinions that visual arts and music can bring. Although people are very alike and have similarities we may share the same preconceptions of art and music. In todays music seminar, we were given the opportunity to listen to a piece of music and then had to work together in groups to create a story board which suited the music best. After creating our story board we had the chance to share our ideas with each other. It then came to my attention that each group had a lot of similarities for example, each group had some sort of chase happening with ups and downs and finishing with a happy ending. However, everyone had different characters which made it their own, unique piece of work. I then considered the use of this activity in a classroom environment, I feel that this activity would prove to learners that when it comes to art, no answer is the wrong answer. In turn, this would increase children’s confidence and allow them to take interest in another subject if their weakness is maths and literacy. We used music to inspire us to think creatively through arts and literacy. Fleming (2012) states:\n\n“It is worth recognising that different art forms and even different works frequently have different intentions and effects; they can enthral, move, enlighten, inform, inspire, amuse, challenge, entertain or provoke.” p.19\n\nI feel that this justifies my previous statement that music and visual arts can be used to acknowledge peoples differences and tell a story in a way that everyone or only some will understand the true meaning of.\n\nFurthermore, after studying the Tallis Habits Pedagogy Wheel the arts have became more clear through the heading of persistent. Tolerating uncertainty as well as sticking with difficulty and daring to be different are all sub-headings that todays lecture and seminar were focused around. These ideas have bettered my understanding of the arts and I will continue to use this resource throughout this module.\n\nIn conclusion, my understanding of visual art and music was very poor at the beginning however, after following up on readings and participating in todays workshops I now understand that visual art and music can be used to tell and create stories through imagination and creativity.\n\nReferences\n\nFleming, M (2012) The Arts in Education: An introduction to aesthetics, theory and pedagogy.
