        "text": "Notoriously private couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes were spotted spending a day with their two daughters at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the couple was seen with their girls, Esmerelda, 9, and Amada, 8, at both the individual dressage Grand Prix freestyle at the Chateau de Versailles and at the Bercy Arena for the women’s gymnastics uneven bars final on Sunday.\n\nThe last time Gosling, 43, and Mendes, 50, were spotted together was when they stepped out for a romantic dinner date in Los Angeles in September 2019.\n\nThe longtime boyfriend and girlfriend dined at an Asian restaurant and enjoyed each other's company for two hours. They seemed happier than ever as they left the restaurant holding hands.\n\nAs we previously reported, the Barbie star and the Hitch actress have been together since 2012. They met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011.\n\nHowever, Mendes retired from acting almost a decade ago to focus on raising their girls. In an interview with People in May, she explained: “I was older and I knew that my kids are going to be little once, and whatever I do or don't do right now is going to affect them the rest of their life.”\n\nShe added: “Your career comes and goes but kids, yeah, that was easy for me. They're just formative years. I wanted to be there for all of it.”\n\nIn an interview in April with Men's Health, The Fall Guy star also shared he takes breaks from the industry to spend time with his wife and children.\n\nNever miss a story – sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news. All free.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing. As RadarOnline.com previously reported, his new action comedy, The Fall Guy, faced backlash before it even hit theaters due to a \"joke\" about Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's tumultuous relationship.\n\nThe scene that sparked controversy featured Emily Blunt and Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham, who portray a director and movie producer.\n\nThe two women walk into an actor's trailer, which has been completely trashed. As the pair marvel at the destruction, Waddingham jokes: “It’s like Amber and Johnny were just in here.”"
