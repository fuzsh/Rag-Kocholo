Amazing.\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#14\n\nJill Hennessy is not only beautiful but she was the strongest actress out of all of them. Carrie Lowell didn't make that much of an impression on me although I did enjoy the harsh quitting and seperation (not romantic) between McCoy and her (did they ever apologize and stay friends?). Angie Harmon is surprisingly good for a model but I thought her character was looser and crazier than McCoy, so it didn't seem an appropriate duo. The blonde is a blonde. I also didn't like the fact that Adam Schiff left. <BR><BR>It was sad that Jill went, but her time on the show was excellent. She was the grounding force behind crazy ol Jack McCoy (that guy is great).\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#15\n\nI'm going with Angie Harmon on this although my real fav is Diane Neal as Casey Novak on SVU.\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#16\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>Originally posted by Coleman:<br>I'm going with Angie Harmon on this although my real fav is Diane Neal as Casey Novak on SVU. <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br><br>I'd pick Jill over Angie, but I agree with you about Diane Neal.

That was an excellent character. But, I voted Angie Harmon. She took it over the edge with her tough stance on crime. She was hardcore.<BR><BR>Paul Robinette always looked like he had constipation. He just didn't step up with a strong personality. Jamie Ross was cool. Her disapproval of Jack McCoy made for an interesting dynamic, But both Hennessy and Harmon were better.<BR><BR>Serena, I think has gotten shafted. She came in during the dark era of Diane Wiest as DA. Everything was bad about those seasons. The dialog was too PC. Serena's character suffered for it and still suffers for it. She is too liberal for my tastes. I'm more of a \"get the rope\" kind of person like Angie Harmon's character.<BR><BR>Best DA is definitely Adam Schiff. The new DA, Arthur Branch is pretty cool. He's very political, using his public office in different ways than Schiff, who used back channel connections more. This ads an interesting element. But the era with Diane Wiest as interim DA... that does not exist. Not only was she horrible, but the general writing for those debates amongst DA, EADA, and ADA were wooden and namby pamby. They lost their passion and just seemed to be spiting out all the common angles of each issue.<BR><BR>With Schiff and Branch, the debates are more passionate and characterized by other factors, such as political motivations, public impression, conviction count.\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#20\n\nBest second chair on Law and Order?<br><br>It's official - the Lounge is completely out of thread topics. -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif --<br><br>- Jim\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#21\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>Originally posted by Picasso:<br><blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>unfortunatelly he's not longer on the show because the actor who played Schiff died. <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br><br>???<br><br>The IMDB and \"deadoraliveinfo.com\" both disagree with you.
