        "text": "Acting class brings back limited theater to MMU\n\nBy Brooklyn Miller/staff writer/May 9, 2024\n\nEver since 2019, formal theater has not been offered at Mount Mercy, but thanks to one professor, the dramatic arts made a limited comeback this spring.\n\n“The intention of the class is to give you a taste of the dramatic arts, not make you feel like an expert,” said Dr. David Klope, associate professor of communication.\n\nTheater is a tradition on The Hill that has fallen away in recent years, Klope said. Kathi Pudzuvelis, associate professor of speech and drama, retired in May 2012 after spending 37 years with Mount Mercy. She produced many drama programs–plays and musicals–during her time here.\n\nAfter Pudzuvelis retired, MMU continued to provide a theater experience, producing plays using adjunct faculty, but participation declined. Improv Club continues, but formal theatrical productions have not been seen on The Hill in recent years.\n\n“My favorite part about theater is to be able to portray stories that inspire the audience,” said Klope.\n\nThis spring semester, the class Introduction to Dramatic Arts was offered for the second time. The class consists of lectures, scripting, acting, stage design and directing. Klope has a background with college theater at other institutions and was the advisor for the drama club. Klope is retiring in two years and says he will advocate for dramatic arts and hopes after he leaves that someone will make the effort to continue drama at MMU.\n\n“I would recommend it to people who want the experience, and taking it with friends would be fun,” said Cortney Parkison, freshman, nursing.\n\nThe reason Parkison wanted to take this class was she needed to fulfill her fine arts domain and thought it seemed interesting. Her favorite part is creating a script because she has no limitations.\n\nFor their final, students had to create a script for their group to perform and perform each other’s script. After taking the class Parkison now has a better knowledge and understanding of the production behind movies and Broadway shows.\n\nMMU meets new service dog\n\nBy Jenna Welty/Campus Editor/March 1, 2024\n\nStudents, staff, and faculty met Sammi, a black lab currently training to be a service dog, at Mustangs Unleashed’s “Puppy Pawty” on Feb. 21 in the UC.\n\nClub members Conner Allender, junior criminal justice and psychology major, and Autumn Puffer, senior criminal justice and political science major, were both eager for Sammi to meet people on campus and for their cause to gain traction.\n\n“We just want people to come see her, get to know her a little bit, and her to get to know campus, as well, and know that there’s going to be a dog on campus, which is really exciting,” Allender said.\n\nThe event was a meet and greet between those who attended and Sammi. A long line formed for people to pet her, grab a snack and a flyer and ask questions.\n\n“It’s kind of hard to get a lot of people interested because we didn’t have a dog for a while, so this line right now that I’m seeing makes me really happy because that means people are interested, and Sammi is like the cutest thing, so she’s definitely bringing in a lot of people,” Puffer said.\n\nAs the president of Mustangs Unleashed, Allender is Sammi’s primary handler on campus. She looks forward to promoting the purpose of service dogs, especially in collaboration with Iowa Service Dogs, which specializes in service dogs for veterans and first responders with mobility issues and PTSD.\n\n“I just really love the mission and the purpose of doing it,” Allender said. “I thought it’d be really neat to have a club, and I’m sure there are tons of students on campus that really love dogs, so why not bring it to campus for students that can have the opportunity to learn or work with a dog and just educate the public a little more.”\n\nPuffer has learned more herself since joining the club, including how to interact with service dogs.\n\n“I think Sammi will do a good job helping people know what it’s like and not just think that it’s serious all of the time,” Puffer said.\n\nThough Sammi will not be attending classes now, she is currently training and knows basic commands and will be out and about by next fall semester.\n\nAt the Feb. 21 event, Sammi was a bit excited, at one point nipping at (but not biting) a student’s finger, causing Allender to remind attendees on how to pet the dog.\n\n“It was best to hold her in the back and try to avoid her mouth otherwise Samy will hurt you,” Allender said.\n\nEditor’s Note: Staff writer Kev Nelson contributed to this story.\n\nRebecca Yarros’ Fourth Wing series is a must read\n\nOpinion-Book Review/By Brooklyn Miller/Staff Writer/March 1, 2024\n\nFourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros is the first book in a fairly new series, and it is the perfect read if you are in a reading slump.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book. I read it for the first time last year around this time while I was traveling. It is a book that I couldn’t put down until I finished it. In November, the second book in this series, Iron Flame, came out, and I read it immediately and loved it as well. Both books made me feel many different emotions and kept me hooked the whole time, which is something I struggle with when searching for a book to read.\n\nThe book begins with us meeting the main character, Violet Sorrengail, and her mother, who are arguing over which war college quadrant she should enter. Her mother is the commanding general and is pressuring her to join the dragon riders instead of the scribes. According to Violet’s mother, joining the scribes would be a disgrace to their family since her siblings are also dragon riders.\n\nViolet is undersized, and everyone around her, including herself, knows she will struggle when trying to bond with a dragon.\n\nThe school is called Basgiath War College, and while they are there, all the cadets are cutthroat and would do anything to get rid of Violet for their own success. Since she is her mother’s daughter, that is another reason people would try to get rid of her. For example, Xaden Riorson. Xaden is the most powerful leader in the Riders Quadrant and has it out for her.\n\nThe genre of the book is fantasy, with some action and romance involved. It has a good balance to it, which is important for me when it comes to fantasy books because some can be over-the-top when it comes to the plot.\n\nI would suggest this book, especially if you are in a reading slump because it is one of those books that will get you out of one. The only unfortunate part of this book series is that it is currently unfinished.\n\nViolet will form many friendships, enemies, and possibly lovers. She will have to learn how to navigate the school and make it to graduation since the only other option is death. After this book, you can read more in the second book, Iron Flame. It is an ongoing series, and it’s assumed there are going to be five books.\n\nClose to home:\n\nTom Castle’s son escapes Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\nBy Alea Hoof/ Opinion Editor/Oct. 31\n\nThe majority of Americans are aware of the conflict that has been occurring thousands of miles across the globe in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. Many of us have not been affected by this war or encountered anyone affected by it, but this was not the case for Tom Castle, provost and vice president for academic affairs of Mount Mercy.\n\nCastle’s son was in Israel when Hamas raided that country, and Tom Castle got a message from him.\n\n“It was unusual for him to send a message at 5 a.m. on Saturday morning to say there’s trouble,” said Tom Castle.\n\nSince 2022, Tom Castle’s son, Ben Castle, has been doing post-grad work in Israel near the Gaza Strip as a math researcher. The Castles were aware of the troubles that could come with doing work in a Middle Eastern country but were not prepared for it to occur at all, nor at such an unexpected and fast rate.\n\nBen and his family were pretty used to receiving alerts from their phones of missiles near Gaza, but this time, it was different.\n\n“Missile alarms were routine,” said Ben Castle. “They went off every few months, so we grew to think of them as more of a nuisance, but the constant rumbling made this experience much different. Typically, the Israeli defense system, The Iron Dome, shoots the missiles out of the sky. In this case, there were so many missiles at once, several made it to their targets, including two in Be’er Sheva where we lived.”\n\nThe Castle family was in and out of shelter for almost a week. During this time, Tom and his wife were not able to keep in touch with their son and his family. The most they could do was pray that their son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren made it back to the United States safely.\n\n“It was incredibly scary because we didn’t know what was happening, and to have your child say we were being bombed, you’re totally helpless because there’s no way we can get to him,” said Tom Castle. “He told us we heard explosions, and we questioned whether we would ever see him again. One of our grandchildren was born in Israel, and we haven’t met him yet, so we thought, what if we never get to meet this grandchild?”\n\nA couple of people that Ben became close with while in Israel were also affected. His fellow math researcher was from Israel but was forced to stop the program and called to the frontlines. His other close friend was their son’s daycare teacher, who was pregnant.\n\n“She went into labor in the bomb shelter while there were people in the streets with machine guns,” said Tom Castle. “When she got to the hospital, she found her husband, who had been shot by Hamas, and he survived. They were reunited in the emergency room and were able to be together when the baby was born.”\n\nBen Castle searched desperately for flights that would take them out of Israel. After a few failed attempts, he was finally able to find an emergency flight to Athens, Greece. The Castles traveled from Greece to Bulgaria, Switzerland and finally Chicago.\n\nThe scariest part for Ben was the car ride to the airport to depart from Israel.\n\n“He said it’s one of those things where you’re so close, but the cab also went within 15 miles of Gaza, and the driver didn’t speak English,” said Tom Castle. “He didn’t have any reason to believe that anything was wrong, but he tracked on his GPS the direction they were headed because he didn’t want to be misdirected right into Gaza.”\n\nThe Castles finally returned home safely after a weeklong journey of searching for hope and a way to see their families in the U.S. again. Although they arrived with no home, no car, and no job, just suitcases, they are grateful to be in the arms of their loved ones again.\n\nRudd, as dean, seeks to uplift students\n\nBy Alea Hoof/Opinion Editor/Oct. 31\n\nThe Mount Mercy Mustangs welcomed Dr. Danielle Rudd to the position of dean of students at the beginning of the ‘23-’24 academic year.\n\nRudd may be new to the position, but she is not an unfamiliar face on campus. Recently serving as the associate professor of biology, Danielle Rudd is looking forward to the new door of opportunities she has been granted on campus to assist and advocate for students.\n\n“In my previous position, I did a really good job at getting to know students on a personal level, and that is part of the reason I wanted to take this job,” said Rudd.\n\nMaking connections with the Mustangs since 2016, Rudd has always made it her priority to build relationships with students. She believes she has better opportunities to connect with students while listening to their voices to make changes for the betterment of their education and college experience.\n\nRudd has lived in Iowa for much of her life, but she was born in Korea and moved to the United States as a baby. Being an immigrant, Rudd empathizes with the community of international students at MMU on their transition of lifestyle and environment.\n\n“I think that when international students come to Mount Mercy from their homes, the transition is not as easy as it could be,” said Rudd.\n\nRudd plans to implement a process that caters to international students to make a smoother transition, assisting them in the adversity that they will face.\n\nWhen she is not advocating for students on the hill, she uses some of her time baking foods and orchestrating various crafts.\n\n“I like to knit, crochet, sew, and I have a cricket,” said Rudd. “A cricket is a craft machine that can cut stuff in the shape you want, so I make t-shirts, and I make stickers. I like to bake as well and decorate cookies and cakes.”\n\nShe once had the idea of opening an Etsy shop online to sell her creations to others but dedicates much of her time to other obligations. Instead, once in a while, Rudd will make crafts for her close friends to have.\n\n“I like stuff like this. I enjoy getting to talk to you and asking what kind of music you like, where your family is from and other things,” said Rudd.\n\nOutside of school-related issues, she enjoys talking with students about their hobbies and interests. Rudd plans to prioritize the voices of students and provide them with more opportunities to voice their opinions to help them from a systemic point of view.\n\nI’m a Barbie Girl in a semi Barbie world\n\nMovie Review/By Emily Monlux/Staff Writer/Oct. 9, 2023\n\n“It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we’re always doing it wrong.”\n\nSo says Gloria, portrayed by America Ferrera, in the movie “Barbie.” That movie, directed by Greta Gerwig, has received incredible praise from many for its feminist message and portrayal of a strong and independent Barbie.\n\nHowever, I have a different view. I think the movie goes too far in pushing an unhealthy view of feminism. That’s because the movie was very one-sided.\n\nThe film is full of lectures about the importance of female empowerment and the need to challenge traditional gender roles.\n\nI, as a woman raising a young woman, believe that, yes, these messages are important. They were, unfortunately, delivered in a poorly constructed way.\n\nFor example, the movie’s Barbie is a perfect specimen of womanhood. She is intelligent, beautiful, and successful in every area of her life. This is not realistic or obtainable for most women and could actually paint a negative view.\n\nIn the movie, Gloria’s tween daughter Sasha (Arianna Greenblatt) takes Barbie to task for making girls feel bad about themselves, and Sasha has a point. Barbie’s perfection sends the message that feminism is about being successful and having it all, and in the end, that message does more harm than good for any struggling woman (and name a woman who doesn’t sometimes struggle) who is unable to achieve in every area.\n\nI mean, come on, it’s really hard to have everything together all the time.\n\nAnother problem I see in the movie is the way the men are viewed. The Kens are portrayed as incompetent and unsupportive. This portrayal of men is not only unrealistic but could also be harmful. It can perpetuate the stereotype that men are useless and that women are better off without them.\n\nDuring the movie, I thought, “The way they are showing men, I guess they should just live underground.” I got that message way more than I felt comfortable with.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. “Barbie” wasn’t all bad in my eyes.\n\nIt has positive aspects, such as its strong female lead and its positive message about self-love. And Gloria’s speech on being a woman? That was killer and spot on.\n\n“I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us.” Me, too. Preach it, Gloria. That speech is so powerful that I would still encourage anyone to go see “Barbie” just to hear it.\n\nHowever, I feel the movie also has serious flaws, such as its preachy tone, its unrealistic portrayal of feminism, and its negative portrayal of men.\n\nI think the movie makers were trying to bring empowerment to women. Which is a beautiful thing, and I’m all for it. However, it is important to find the balance between feminism and empowerment because feminism is not just about empowering women. It is also about creating a more just and equitable society for all people.\n\nIt is also important to remember that feminism is not a one-size-fits-all movement. There are many ways to be a feminist. What works for one woman may not work for another. It is important to respect the diversity within the feminist movement. I hope for equality, not superiority.\n\n“Barbie” had the potential to be a fun and empowering movie for girls of all ages but could have been improved by making its feminist message more subtle and less one-sided. The movie could also have been improved by portraying a more realistic and diverse view of feminism. Additionally, the movie could be improved by giving the male characters more depth and development.\n\nIs “Barbie” worth seeing? Sure. But it would be Kenough for me to like it more if it were a little more even-handed. It is, as Gloria says, sometimes impossible to be a woman. It’s also hard to be a man. I would like to have seen more of that on the screen.\n\nJewelry takes first at student art show\n\nBy Karlie Lee/ Staff Writer/ Oct. 9, 2023\n\nJewelry, collages, photography and more student art from the past year were on display at the first art show in the gallery on Sept. 14.\n\nA variety of class work showcasing different styles was in this first show of eight throughout the school year.\n\nBrianna Riedel, senior fine arts major, had a few pieces in the art show. Three of her pieces centered around the theme of her mother, including Mother Nature, Mother Mary and Mother Goose. She also created a ceramic piece that was made by a special firing called a raku firing, where they let clay air dry and then fired it in a trashcan.\n\n“I would recommend anyone to come check on how we do it if they are interested,” said Riedel.\n\nWinners were announced later in the show.\n\nBrandon Regan won first place for a jewelry piece. Second place was Brianna Riedel, third was Grace Byers, and the two honorable mentions were Liz Solorio and Brandi Regan.\n\nJohn Thomas Richard, professor of art & design, hopes many students will attend future showings and see their peers’ artwork.\n\nThe next show is the faculty show that showcases artwork from the current Art & Design Faculty. This exhibit is displayed from Oct.2-27.\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Editor-in-Chief/Sept. 19\n\nBean bags and coffee may not be the first things you think of when you consider the Academic Center for Excellence—but the center is positioning itself as a helpful study center for all students.\n\nThe purpose of ACE has always been to meet student needs, which tend to change over time, and because of this, ACE has experienced many transitions in the past few years. The most recent and prominent change happened at the end of last year when Barb Miller, previous director of ACE, stepped down. Since then, ACE’s leadership team has been working hard to strengthen their resources available to students and create a more welcoming environment.\n\n“We remain dynamic and flexible. I think it’s fair to say that brainstorming and pivoting are two of our superpowers!” said Ben Thiel, writing specialist.\n\nThiel has been a part of the coMMUnity since August 2013 and has been in the education field for 36 years. Over this time, he has taken on a variety of roles, including English, special education, and Christian education at the high school level and English, religion, and leadership courses at the college level.\n\nAlong with Thiel, the leadership team consists of Skylar Hop, academic support specialist assistant; Kelly Ward, manager of ACE and access & disability services coordinator; and Sandy Osbon, administrative assistant.\n\nLast spring, a survey was sent out to students and through this, the ACE team was able to review this and find areas where improvement was needed. The Peer Educator program was one of these areas where change happened. Many peer educators have a multifaceted role, and now, they are able to be promoted in all areas of skill rather than just focusing on one. ACE’s existence online is being strengthened as well; there is a new ACE SharePoint site where students can access writing and study skill resources and even information for multilingual students.\n\nUpdates have been made to the physical environment, too. Students can now find a private space dedicated to the Writing Center, a “coffee corner,” and bean bag chairs.\n\n“I recognize and value the knowledge that anytime there is a change in leadership, there is an opportunity to reflect on current programs and services,” said Ward.\n\nWard has a passion for helping students develop their academic skills for life-long learning and has proven this in her 30 years as an educator and in her fourth year at MMU.\n\n“Throughout the history of ACE, the primary focus has always remained the students. Whether a student is coming into study, to meet with their Peer Academic Coach, or just to exchange friendly hellos with the staff, the spirit of ACE remains one of caring and support,” she said.\n\nLiberal arts are vital to our culture\n\nBy Landen Freeman/Staff Writer/Sept. 18, 2023\n\nAccording to Dr. Belkis Suárez, associate professor of Spanish at MMU and speaker at the first Fall Faculty Series event on Sept. 5, although our culture values the economic impact of a college education, its importance is much deeper than that.\n\nIn her speech titled “Present-Day Tensions of the Liberal Arts and Their Consequences,” Dr. Suárez said that the purpose of higher education should be to rigorously develop the student’s intellectual and personal abilities and their understanding of the context in which those abilities will contribute to our society.\n\nShe argues this is best achieved through a liberal arts education.\n\nTraditionally, a liberal arts education encompasses a broad range of topics spanning from STEM to the humanities, with the intent of producing graduates well-versed in a variety of subjects. In contrast, a professional education allows students to focus on the skills particular to an industry–such as pharmacy or law.\n\nShe believes many students pursuing a professional education that excludes a liberal arts education are missing out.\n\n“In professional education, we see more of this profession formation or citizenship approach, not both,” Suárez said.\n\nShe explained that with a liberal arts education, students can be well-prepared for employment and become well-rounded members of society.\n\nToday, as Suárez pointed out, there is pressure on higher education to emphasize professional preparation. While enrollment in humanities is declining, enrollment in fields like computer science knowledge is currently booming.\n\nIn reaction, Suárez noted many institutions are beginning to cut humanities programs, such as English, history and art, to “modernize” their curriculum and fit industry demand. There is also pressure on students to choose what they consider lucrative fields to pay their large student loan debt–a product of ever-rising tuition.\n\nIn comments at the end of her speech, Suárez agreed that students face family pressure to choose fields of study where they can do well financially. At some universities, this can make the humanities seem like “antiquities of the past.”\n\nDr. Suárez pointed out that while generations in the 20th century held high confidence in higher education, increasing tuition and the subsequent student-debt crisis have undermined that confidence today.\n\nSuárez argues that a liberal arts education still has value. She called attention to the fact that industry, which is the driving force behind a professional curriculum, changes all the time. The liberal arts, according to Dr. Suárez, “exist for their own benefit, have intrinsic value, and are not subordinate to other forces.”\n\nShe also promoted the idea that a liberal arts education cultivates creativity and collaboration. To better educate today’s students, Suárez says universities should connect the humanities, STEM, and industry fields.\n\nTo illustrate the value of liberal arts, Suárez introduced a recent Mount Mercy alumnus.\n\nJacob Waltersdorf, class of 2021, majored in international studies with a concentration in political science and a minor in Spanish. Waltersdorf started his career with Alliant Energy in a seasonal Customer Support Associate role.\n\nHe noticed that many Spanish-speaking clients needed more help in their native language and saw this as an opportunity to advocate for the people he was serving. He proposed that the customer support team have a new emphasis on bilingual customer support. As a result, Waltersdorf is now a team lead in Customer Support Services, overseeing the bilingual associate initiatives.\n\nHe credits his liberal arts background for his ability to recognize a need and use it to help others and himself be successful.\n\nThe Fall Faculty Series is an annual tradition at Mount Mercy, where the faculty picks a theme and hosts a series of public presentations on it. It will continue on Oct. 10, when Dr. Xander Toftness, assistant professor of psychology, will deliver a presentation on “AI in Education: A New Chapter in Learning?” The series takes place through Dec. 5. All presentations are at 6 p.m. in the Flaherty Community Room, Basile Hall.\n\nIowa joins sad trend: anti-LGBTQ+ laws\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Editor-in-Chief/May 4, 2023\n\nThe attack on the LGBTQ+ community is nothing new. However, there has recently been a wave of discriminatory acts being committed against the youth of this community, including anti-LGBTQ+ bills, and bills to ban books in schools that discuss these issues.\n\nIn March, Gov. Kim Reynolds passed two bills aimed at transgender youth. Senate File 482 prohibits people from using a school restroom or changing room that does not match their sex assigned at birth and requires students to have parental consent to request use of a single occupancy or faculty restroom. If a school does not comply, people could file a complaint with the school or even the attorney general, who could possibly take legal action.\n\nTrans youth are also faced with the struggle of not being allowed access to gender-affirming healthcare. Senate File 538 prohibits doctors in Iowa from providing transgender patients who are minors with puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and gender-affirming surgeries. Those who are already receiving GAC will be given six months to come off medications.\n\nReynolds claims she is passing these kinds of bills with Iowan children’s safety in mind, but they are actually causing more harm to the mental well-being of trans youth. The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ youth, has data that shows that just the introduction of these bills has negatively impacted the mental health of 85 percent of trans youth; 75 percent of LGBTQ+ youth said anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes and violence against LGBTQ+ spaces gives them stress or anxiety.\n\nAnother bill, Senate File 496, has been proposed by Reynolds, which would create a statewide list where books that have been removed from school libraries would be placed. “Gender Queer” is one of the books already removed from Iowa schools. This bill would prohibit instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation through sixth grade. Parents would be notified if their child asks to use different pronouns in school, and it would add parents to the state’s education licensing board.\n\nNot only is this happening on a state level, but on a national level, as well. As of April 3, at least 400 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced across the U.S.\n\nFlashback: Memories of the MMU Times\n\nSecurity, board rep issues raised at McAuley Auditorium meeting\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Editor-in-Chief/May 4, 2023\n\n1993: 30 years ago\n\nStudents express security concerns\n\nThe administration-student panel was held in McAuley Auditorium on March 18, where many questions were answered, such as: will security be student-staffed and why isn’t there student, faculty and staff representation on the Mount Mercy Board of Trustees?\n\nA change in security was proposed for the 93-94 school year. This would include staffing security with students from the upper division of the criminal justice program. However, students were concerned about how these student security officers would handle dangerous situations and work at night while going to class during the day.\n\n2003: 20 years ago\n\nHanson named Times editor\n\nLatisha Hanson, junior communications major with minors in English and writing, has been named the editor of the Mount Mercy Times for the 2003-04 school year.\n\n“It will be a great learning experience, and it will look great on my resume,” she said.\n\nHanson became a writer for the Times in the fall when she took a journalism class and continued as a work study in the spring.\n\n2013: 10 years ago\n\nGraduating Times staff members include marketing coordinator, journalist, grad student, disc jockey\n\nFour of the Mount Mercy Times’ staff will be graduating this year: Ben Wood, editor-in-chief; Brittany Hubler, campus editor; Jenny Valliere, multimedia producer; and Jun Endo, sports editor.\n\nWood, a public relations and communications major, will be attending UNI for his master’s degree in student affairs. He enjoyed building relationships with the other staff members the most during his time on the newspaper.\n\nA public relations major, Hubler has already obtained a job as a search engine marketing coordinator with Google Ad Words. She says most employers were impressed with her experience on the Times’ staff while interviewing.\n\nValliere will be working as an overnight DJ and web content developer for Z102.9 and believes the Times has prepared her for this role.\n\nEndo, journalism major, has an internship lined up at the Cedar Rapids Gazette for the summer. He credits the Times for being able to improve his writing and other skills that will help him pursue his future career.\n\nStudents from Japan note food, friendliness\n\nBy Grady Smith/Staff Writer/May 4, 2023\n\nLeft to right, Takumi Semba, Mashio Takamura, Yuhei Matsushita. (Times photo by Grady Smith)\n\nMount Mercy is home to a number of international students, and to those who come from Japan, the differences between home and the Hill stand out.\n\n“The difference in scale between Japan and America: America is huge,” said Takumi Semba, junior, about his initial impression of America.\n\nSize stood out to another student, too.\n\n“I was surprised by the size of the buildings,” said Mashio Takamura, sophomore.\n\nAlthough the population of Japan is very large, the land itself is extremely small. It is approximately the same size as California.\n\nThree students from Japan all noted that American people greet others with friendliness most of the time.\n\n“The people in the United States are so friendly. Every single time I see them, they ask me, ‘Hi, how are you?’ I love it actually,” said Yuhei Matsushita, senior.\n\nMeeting new people hasn’t been difficult for these students.\n\n“People are so friendly, we can make a friend so easily,” said Semba.\n\n“Everyone is always smiling,” said Takamura.\n\nCompliments are among the favorite greetings the students receive. They are a great way to start conversation between strangers.\n\n“I was in New York, and a random person tells me, ‘Hey, I like your shoes, or something.’ I like that culture,” said Matsushita.\n\nThis appears to be a common theme among these students as they appreciate people’s kindliness.\n\nCulture shocks are a huge part of moving abroad as you experience things you would not have before.\n\n“People eat something at Walmart before they pay for it. It is really crazy for me, as in Japan, I never see that; it was a shock,” explained Matsushita.\n\nEven bathrooms in America are different than in Japan. Bathrooms in Japan tend to be more private.\n\n“Toilets in the United States have so much space under the door, it is different. I was surprised by that,” said Semba.\n\nThe difference in food between America and Japan is wide. The Japanese diet consists mainly of seafood including sushi, whereas red meat is the main diet in America, so this change is a significant one to process.\n\n“Here we can’t get Japanese food. I think they (incoming Japanese students) need to prepare for that,” said Matsushita. “I can’t eat sushi in the United States as there is no culture here for eating seafood.”\n\nAdvice each of the students have for Japanese students coming to America is:\n\n• “Learn English!” said Takamura.\n\n• “I recommend talking to a lot of people (in English). You can learn more,” said Semba.\n\nSpeaker cites evidence to believe in Jesus\n\nBy Elaina Sanders/Assistant Editor/April 20, 2023\n\nThe Aquinas Lecture April 13 featured the Rev. James Brent, OP, speaking on The Rationality of Faith. Brent responded to the centuries-old doubt on if Christianity has sufficient evidence for believing in Jesus.\n\nBefore a full audience in the lecture hall, Donnelly 300, Brent described the premises of the evidentialist views: “First, it is wrong to believe anything without sufficient evidence. Second, Christian belief lacks sufficient proof, including up to God or just specifically Christian beliefs.” This leads to the conclusion that it is irrational to hold Christian beliefs because there is not sufficient evidence.\n\nBrent refuted this point of view. He noted that we can believe things without sufficient evidence. We can believe via “leap” even if it’s not self-evident. He used the example of proving the world is older than five minutes as a case where we are willing to make such a leap.\n\nBrent also stated that Christianity has evidence, noting the Catholic perspective that ongoing evidence of Jesus includes with the saints, the empty tomb, and that God himself revealed this evidence.\n\n“Faith is more than a feeling,” he said, in a paraphrase of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Brent continues with, “faith is not a subjective perspective; faith is a kind of commitment to truth but is different than the essence of disciplines like math.”\n\nSome evidence is based on the credibility of the witnesses via their testimony, which is how Christians view the Gospels. He said the Gospels aren’t just human writings, but Christians believe they are, in effect, witness testimony from God, who does not lie.\n\n“So how do you know it’s God who is telling you?” Brent asked. He cited three factors. First, hearing the testimony of the apostles. Second, confirmation signs supporting events the report. Third, the reason for believing is the instinct of the Holy Spirit which causes faith in the testimony.\n\nBrent also said there is plenty of evidence for miracles within the church that were done in the name of Jesus.\n\n“The testimony of the Apostles is credible. It is reasonable following the voice of conscience bidding one to believe it and give it a simple assent for what it claims to be the word of God,” Brent said.\n\nFlashback: Memories from the MMU Times\n\nDiversity statement signed: a response to hate incidents across U.S. campuses\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Editor-in-chief/March 30, 2023\n\n20 years ago: 2003\n\nHousing and enrollment numbers may be decreasing.\n\nIt is a possibility that the economy and war on Iraq are causes for the low freshman class and low housing for this year.\n\n“Families couldn’t afford to send their children to Mount Mercy, but I’m seeing a lot of transfer students, who I have recruited from last year, signed up for next year,” said Margaret Jackson, Dean of Admissions.\n\nAccording to Jackson and Dr. Robert Pearce, president of Mount Mercy College, the next academic school year looks promising. Dr. Pearce believes there are three distinct populations at Mount Mercy: traditional freshman, transfers, and non-traditional students, and each of these appear solid for the upcoming year.\n\n10 years ago: 2013\n\nMMU summer courses offer convenience and variety.\n\nMount Mercy will be offering many summer classes to undergraduate students which will provide them with convenience, flexibility, and savings through discounted tuition rates.\n\nThe Think Summer! Survey of Summer Preferences proved that students have a high interest in taking summer classes—47.5% of the 181 responses said they would definitely enroll in a summer course.\n\n“Summer courses are a great opportunity for students to take just one or two classes at a time. It also helps students get minors out of the way and better prepare for the future,” said Janet Handler, vice provost of academic affairs.\n\n5 years ago: 2018\n\nIn response to hate incidents, diversity statement signed.\n\nStudents and faculty of Mount Mercy that are on the Diversity, Equality, and Inclusivity Committee (DEIC) have released a statement describing the university’s commitment to diversity.\n\n“Several incidents that have happened have prompted us to really kind of state Mount Mercy’s position,” said Sister Linda Bechen, vice president of mission and ministry.\n\nPresident Laurie Hamen emphasized Mount Mercy’s Catholic tradition of compassion in all things. Across the country, campuses are fighting against intolerance which can come in many forms such as slurs or small forms of bias.\n\nCreed III: Does this mark the end of a franchise or beginning of a new one?\n\nBy Gloria Osei Tutu/Assistant Editor/March 30, 2023\n\nCreed III is a real LA story of generational anger and pain in Black communities. Specifically, the film frames the fight between Adonis and Dame as the Battle of Los Angeles.\n\nFor some of the most disenfranchised, boxing is often an outlet for survival and a window to make their legacy.\n\nThe Creed wing of the Rocky franchise has always been about a legacy where an underdog fights through the ladder to be the champion. Creed III was no different as Adonis’ childhood friend and former boxing prodigy Damien, played by Jonathan Majors, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison.\n\nThe former friends engage in a face-off as he tries to prove that he deserves a shot at making his legacy.\n\nFor a directorial debut, Michael B. Jordan did a great job with this movie. This is reflected in the film as Creed III opens with a flashback to Adonis’ childhood and his friendship with Dame Anderson. This is the young boxing phenom that’s more like a brother to Adonis.\n\nThis is why I think Creed III is finally showcasing the passing of the torch. The first two films were about finding a place in relation to other men’s legacies. Here, Adonis is presented with questions from his past that need answering, but none of them have anything to do with his father or Rocky Balboa.\n\nThe Creed III storyline was quite different because Major’s ability to alternate between a well-intentioned old friend and an insidious new rival brought a fresh twist in making him one of the most original antagonists in the franchise. The chemistry between him and Major, built on old bonds and pain, serves as the backbone of Creed III.\n\nEvery good movie has its pros and cons. The only cons I have with this movie is that, unlike the other two films where Thompson Bianca played an active role, in Creed III, she is relegated to the background just like Adrian in the last Rocky movie, which is unfortunate.\n\nCreed III seems like it marks the end of the Rocky franchise, especially with the absence of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). However, with the introduction of young actress Mila Davis Kent, we could see the franchise shifting again. We started with Rocky, moved on to Adonis Creed, and now they are laying the groundwork for Creed’s daughter. This could mean a lot, considering the rise of mixed martial arts (MMA) and female wrestling fighters becoming more popular.\n\nFlashback: Memories of the MMU Times\n\nWriters opine on guns, Black Panther movie\n\nCompiled by Delcie Sanache/Sports Editor/Feb. 16, 2023\n\n15 years ago: 2008 Governor grabs our dollars\n\nGov. Chet Culver has decided to not increase the budget of the Iowa Tuition Grant by the recommended amount of $5 million by Iowa’s private colleges and universities.\n\nThe Iowa Tuition Grant was established in 1969 in order for college students to be able to afford their education. The average award amount at Mount Mercy is $3287. Financial Aid Counselor Bethany Rinderknecht said approximately 770 of Mount Mercy’s students are receiving the grant, which is 55% of the student population.\n\n“I have worked in Financial Aid for over eight years and have seen the total award for students decreased,” said Rinderknecht.\n\n10 years ago: 2013\n\nGun control: Protection or potential danger\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are one of the most lethal weapons in history. However, they can also be used to provide protection. A bill was recently presented by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has listed over 150 guns that she thinks should be banned.\n\nThe unfortunate Newton school shooting has brought this bill to light even more. Shortly after this shooting, another took place where a man fired 30 rounds in a restaurant and movie theater.\n\nIf guns were banned, who is to say that someone wouldn’t come up with a new, more dangerous type of weapon? Providing a more detailed background check or taking multiple tests that can prove someone is stable enough to buy a gun may be a better option than banning guns altogether.\n\nPeople are dying every day whether due to a gunshot or another weapon, suicide, or natural causes; death is unavoidable. However, that does not mean a life should be taken by someone with a gun.\n\n5 years ago: 2018 Finally, Marvel provides a new black superhero\n\nHollywood has come a long way in the past few decades. In 1986, a movie was released that focused on a white, male college student who disguised himself as a Black man in order to receive a scholarship to Stanford.\n\nFor many years, black face was used to portray Black actors. This was seen in the movie, Short Circuit 2 (1988) and in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a Japanese character was depicted by a white actor. Marvel’s Black Panther is groundbreaking during this time where we have seen and continue to see a gross representation of people of color in the Hollywood industry.\n\nA common misconception people have about Africa is that it is a place of destitution and war. However, Black Panther depicts Africa and Black people as fierce and beautiful and includes a predominantly Black cast.\n\nTake time to hear the wisdom of the Sisters of Mercy\n\n“Faith on the Hill” by Vanessa Milliman/columnist/Feb. 16, 2023\n\nIn my freshman year, I worked in a care center in my hometown. Just hearing this, you might assume that I was on the nursing care team. However, I was on the dietary staff.\n\nIn my time there, I gained several sets of adoptive grandparents. I grew to love them as they loved me in return. I would spend time with them at meals and during the early morning hours. I treasured this time; maybe it is because I am a morning person, or maybe it is because I love the small interactions as an introvert.\n\nI would tiptoe into work and start getting the kitchen ready for breakfast. Simple meal prep was first. Setting tables came next, followed by coffee. The quiet start to the day provided comfort to those waking up.\n\nMaking the first pot of coffee was a joy. It served as the conversation starter for several of my adoptive grandparents. Several of my residents were up before the sun. I greeted them as they came from their rooms. These small interactions were enough to bring a smile to their faces. They wanted to share their joy of life and their wisdom with others.\n\nI have heard a quote and it rings true here: “The wise man wears out the door of those wiser than himself.” We have our own treasure of wisdom here on campus. The Sacred Heart convent is filled with women who have dedicated their lives to building the lives of others.\n\nFor most of us, we come to the Hill and hear stories of Catherine McAuley and the work of the Sisters of Mercy. We all watch the same video showing us how Catherine changed the world. Then we hear stories of the work that the sisters have done in our community: this university, Mercy hospital, the Catherine McAuley Center, and so much more.\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy may not be as active and visible as they once were, but they are not gone. They are living here on campus and wanting to be a part of the community still. Some of them are still residing in the Sacred Heart convent at the bottom of the Hill behind the Busse Library. Their mobility does not allow them to come up the Hill to us.\n\nI went to Mass with them before break, and they wanted me to bring others to come visit. They want to see MMU’s students. They want to hear the amazing things that you are doing inside and outside the classroom.\n\nI encourage you to take time semester to visit them. Reach out to schedule a time to talk and listen to them. They love to hear how their students are doing. Their abundant wisdom is waiting to be shared. Growth in knowledge is foundational to college, growing in experience is another pillar. The Sisters have both. Go visit them. Talk to them. Learn from and rejoice in their stories. Show them love.\n\nVictim of child abuse speaks about experience\n\nBy Annie Barkalow/Editor-in-Chief/Jan. 26, 2023\n\nThe student was born four weeks early with meth detected in her system. At age 10, she was being physically abused by her stepfather. At age 17, she moved out and lived with friends, torn between the guilt of leaving behind siblings and the need to escape a toxic situation.\n\nAbout 20 people came together in Flaherty Community Room Tuesday, Jan. 17 to hear a criminal justice major and transfer student, who wishes to remain unnamed, speak about her experience growing up in an abusive home.\n\nTitled “Overcoming Obstacles,” the lecture began with a PowerPoint presentation with the definition of child abuse, the effects thereof, warning signs and statistics. According to statistics, physical abuse is the most common abuse directed toward children.\n\nThe student said the trouble began at the age of 10 when her mother married a man who resented the student’s many physical ailments and frequent trips to the Mayo Clinic, saying she took time away from his wife and used that as an excuse to physically abuse her. The mom did not step in and though DHS was called many times, the student was too afraid to say what really happened.\n\nIt took seven years for DHS to remove her and her siblings from her mother’s care, who at that point battled drug addiction and eventually faced jail time. During that time, the student moved around a lot and went to three different schools while helping care for her siblings.\n\n“I had to face a lot of hardships, but I did not give up when things got rough,” said the student.\n\nWhen asked what kind of support victims of abuse need or what teachers could have done differently, the answer was simple: check in.\n\n“The DHS system is very broken,” said the student, wishing that teachers would have stepped in sooner.\n\nEditor’s note: the Times’ policy is to name sources, but given the nature of the topic, the Times decided to honor the speaker’s wishes and withhold her name.\n\nSeries director says attendance is rising\n\nBy Annie Barkalow/Editor-in-Chief/Jan. 18, 2023\n\nArtificial intelligence, social media and World War II photography were popular subjects for this year’s Fall Faculty Series, held Sept.-Nov. in the Flaherty Community Room.\n\nThe series featured an interdisciplinary mix from the departments of biology, chemistry, sociology, religion and philosophy, nursing and mathematics.\n\nThe topic this year, “Humans and Technology,” featured six different lectures given by faculty and staff and was open to both the campus and community and focused on the relationship between people and technology, with topics ranging from the evolution of technology to World War II photography to current influences in artificial intelligence in health care.\n\nJoe Hendryx, director of the series, said although the series took a hit during the pandemic, attendance is getting better each year, with an average of about 20 people per session this year.\n\nTo date, most audience members have been faculty, staff and students, and Hendryx has been brainstorming ways to bring in more members of the community.\n\nA popular lecture was “Scrolling is Unpaid Labor,” given by assistant professor of religious studies Travis Lacy, and highlighted how exploitive social media is and how it narrows our view of the world, rather than broadens it.\n\n“It was a powerful and fun insight into how social media affects us,” said Hendryx, noting that Lacy took a “deep dive” into the subject.\n\nHendryx said there is a running list of topics for next year that faculty will vote on, saying that he tries to find topics that are both educational and engaging.\n\nProf speaks on media scrolling\n\nBy Matthew Murphy/Staff Writer/Jan. 18, 2023\n\nStick around long enough in any public place, and you’ll see people using their phones to fill in the gap of slow times—standing in line, waiting for the doctor, eating a meal—and sometimes using it just to hide behind an awkward moment. Chances are, there’s more scrolling than actual reading going on.\n\n“Scrolling is Unpaid Labor” was the topic of the sixth and final Fall Faculty Series, “Humans and Technology.”\n\nAssistant professor of religious studies, Travis Lacy, challenged the crowd gathered in the Flaherty Community Room on Nov. 15 to think critically about what they are accomplishing when scrolling, and whether or not the scrolling has purpose.\n\nAccording to Lacy, individuals are using social media for many important reasons but most choose not to use it as a resource, and there should be purpose when scrolling.\n\nAdvertisements are one example of using social media with a purpose.\n\n“We see 4,000 to 10,000 advertisements each day which serve a purpose,” said Lacy, “advertisements are a huge money maker.”\n\nAdvertisements play a huge role in today’s society to make sure people show interest in their company or see what is going on in today’s world, and these advertisements are used to grab our attention in order to achieve their objective.\n\nDuring the lecture, Lacy also spoke about our relationship with time, and not to waste it being unproductive or just killing time. “It is bad for us to take the narrower way out,” he said.\n\nA poem that was quoted was “Choose Something Like a Star.” Choose something that will have a purpose in what you are looking for, and don’t take the easy way out of activities when just scrolling through your social media feed.\n\nStudents build nearly 200 critters at M2AP board event\n\nBy Becky Lenton/Staff Writer/ Jan. 16, 2023\n\nBuild-a-Critter returned for another year, bringing students to the upper deck of Hennessy almost two hours before the event started on Nov. 10.\n\nM2AP Board Social Media Executive, Haley Hartshorne said, “This is one of the biggest events on campus, with roughly 200 critters…it allows so many students the opportunity to get involved.”\n\nStudents joined the line at 5:40 p.m. despite the event starting at 8:00 p.m. This year’s critters ranged from axolotls, to koalas, to dragons, with a wide variety for the students to pick, but the favorite was the sea turtle.\n\nM2AP Board will be hosting a variety of events before the end of the semester, including their Stress Buster series, helping students to unwind from the pressures of finals week.\n\nMMU Professor reflects on Iowa’s midterm election results\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Sports Editor/Jan. 16, 2023\n\nIowa’s 2022 midterm election is over, and Mount Mercy’s assistant professor of English, Joe Hendryx, found himself disappointed with the results.\n\n“The Iowa midterm results were not surprising to a lot of us, although the nationwide fizzling out of the highly anticipated ‘red wave’ was a little surprising. I think this speaks to the fact that the national popularity of progressive issues is obscured by both Democratic and Republican politicians and by the news media. The media needs to stop predicting outcomes and discussing electability and instead make a concerted effort to holistically represent what is at stake in these elections and to critically interrogate disinformation,” he said.\n\nKim Reynolds (R) beat out Deidre DeJear (D) for governor, Chuck Grassley (R) beat out Michael Franken (D) for senator, and the Republican party won all four House seats.\n\nHendryx recognized fault in the Democratic Party during this election.\n\n“The Democratic Party needs to give actual support to more progressive candidates who are running on policies that are popular with the majority of Americans—universal health-care, student debt forgiveness, marijuana legalization, abortion access. The Democrats need to stop ‘reaching across the aisle’ to appeal to a party that has spent years claiming they are fundamentally illegitimate. As a party, the Democrats cling to the center even though this continues to fail,” he said.\n\nHe believes that moving forward, there are many key issues needing to be addressed both in Iowa and nationwide.\n\n“Abortion rights: they have been supported by the majority of Americans for decades, and we are seeing this with the nationwide backlash against the overturning of Roe v. Wade. LGBTQ+ protection and empowerment: I remember how exciting it was in 2009 when Iowa was one of the first stated to legalize same-sex marriage. I’m extremely disappointed that this momentum has not carried forward and instead we have seen a surge of bigoted rhetoric and harmful policies aimed at these historically marginalized identities,” he said.\n\nWho are the missing sisters?\n\nBy Joselyn Hildebrand/Feature Editor/Jan. 16, 2023\n\nThe Nov. 16 Hot Lunch Hot Topics hosted monthly by SGA in the J.E.D.I. room featured the epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW), titled “Who are the missing sisters?”\n\nNovember is Native American Heritage Month. The lunch event focused on the impact of law enforcement, U.S. colonization, inter-generational trauma, and poor media coverage of cases.\n\n“There are so many (cases) that we don’t even know of and can’t track, many don’t ever come forward,” sophomore Houston Hamlett said.\n\nAttendees were provided with an informational packet including statistics relevant to each issue. One of the most disturbing facts: Over 95% of cases involving MMIW are never covered by national or international media. Less than one-fifth of the cases covered by the media are talked about more than once, according to Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nRed Dress Day is one of the ways to bring awareness to the issue nationally. Recognized on May 5, it is the National Day of Awareness for MMIW. Communities are encouraged to wear red to draw attention to the crimes committed against MMIW.\n\nIt has been nearly eight years since a Native woman went missing from freshman Delcie Sanache’s home settlement in Iowa, Meskwaki. She said her family always wears red on Red Dress Day.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff brainstormed ideas about how to bring more awareness to this issue. Some of the ideas mentioned included an on-campus powwow, bringing Native American small local business to campus, and a walk near Red Dress Day\n\nVisiting writer hosts memoir writing workshop\n\nBy Catherine Kratoska/Opinion Editor/Jan. 16, 2023\n\nThis fall’s Visiting Writer Series brought author Mary Helen Stefaniak to campus on Nov. 16 at 2 p.m. in the Flaherty Community room in Basile Hall.\n\nStefaniak, professor emerita of English and creative writing at Creighton University, started with a workshop on the “six-minute memoir,” based off of her most recent book, The Six-Minute Memoir: Fifty-Five Short Essays on Life. The essays in her book were written over the course of over 20 years for the magazine Iowa Source, which Stefaniak performed over Iowa Public Radio. Each essay would take about six minutes to perform on the radio.\n\nAt the end of the workshop Stefaniak provided prompts to help writers come up with their own six-minute essays and attendees were encouraged to share their writing. This was followed by a reading by Stefaniak and a question-and-answer session about her books and her writing career.\n\nAt the 3:30 p.m. reading, Stefaniak read from both Six-Minute Memoir and her most recent novel, The World of Pondside. Her novel takes place in an Iowa nursing home and follows the residents and staff as they try to solve the fatal drowning of middle-aged resident Robert Kallman. While Kallman was in the final stages of ALS, he created a virtual reality game for the other residents with the help of Foster Kresowick, a young man who works in the kitchen of the nursing home. After his drowning, the game disappears, which leads the intergenerational cast of characters to investigate their friend’s death, and what happened to their beloved game.\n\nBetrayal, heartbreak, resilience and pride: a Native story\n\nProfessor recounts national Native American history, population drop in reflection event\n\nBy Annie Barkalow/Editor-in-Chief/Jan. 16, 2023\n\nThe story of Native Americans is one of betrayal, heartbreak, resilience, defiance, pride and joy. For the Sioux, there is no direct translation for the word love—instead, they say “I will suffer for you.” And much suffering have they endured.\n\nOn Nov. 9, about 35 people gathered in the Flaherty Community Room to listen to visiting assistant professor of sociology, Sonja Lee Bock, talk about Native American history. Bock is a registered member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota. Titled “My Native Story: Past, Present, and Future,” the lecture gave a brief history of Natives in North America and a look at current Native issues, movements, and successes.\n\nBeginning with the history of early contact, Bock put the number of Natives at 60 million in the United States prior to colonialism, compared with the current 6.79 million. Many Native populations were wiped out when European Puritans brought diseases with them. Later, children were taken away to Indian residential schools to assimilate. 4,130 confirmed children died while at these schools from sickness, starvation, neglect and acts of cruelty. They were forced to give up their language, culture, clothing and cut their hair.\n\n“In our culture, our hair is very important to men and women. Cutting hair represents death,” said Bock.\n\nDespite the brutal treatment they were shown by colonizers, Natives have historically shown up for combat duty in every war before the U.S. was even a nation. In World War I, 13,000 Natives served without being given citizenship. So, why do they defend a colonized country?\n\n“It’s still our land. We still have to protect our land,” said Bock.\n\nToday, Natives are still fighting for their rights, whether it’s challenging broken treaties from the past, the water protectors at Standing Rock fighting to keep a pipeline off the land, or accounting for the 5,712 missing and murdered Indigenous women. There are bright spots, however.\n\nRepresentation is increasing—currently, there are six Natives in Congress, and many are working to teach the younger generation their language of origin. Bock briefly went over her family history and emphasized that despite the hardships, being Native American is a joyful experience, and nothing has been able to dim the vibrancy of their culture.\n\nWakanda Forever a cinematic masterpiece, but misrepresents African culture\n\nBy Gloria Osei Tutu/Feature Writer/Dec.7, 2022\n\nA truly remarkable feat of cinema, Black Panther Wakanda Forever demonstrates the power of grief. The movie managed to advance the thematically rich thought experiment of Wakanda without its beloved hero T’Challa, the late actor Chadwick Boseman. While director Ryan Coogler deserves a lot of credit for pulling diverse cultures together in this movie, he failed to do the African culture justice while making a nice movie.\n\nThe movie starts with the voice of Shuri praying for Bast to heal her brother T’Challa, who eventually dies. Her mother Ramonda enters to report her brother is with the ancestors now. T’challa’s illness was never specified in this film out of respect to the late Chadwick Boseman, who died in August 2020 after a private battle with colon cancer. His death prompted a rewrite of the script. The writers did a great job avoiding exploiting Boseman’s death as the main plot point. T’challa’s death isn’t really the point, it’s about mourning, so by using the word illness we are able to relate to the ways we have lost loved ones, just as we lost Chadwick.\n\nThe first Wakanda movie was centered around T’Challa, and it was supposed to be this imaginary place of African descent where these Warriors would protect the people. From the beginning of the movie where we heard Shuri’s voice praying for Bast to heal her brother, to the end of the movie, it was all a feminist show. The movie portrayed strong black African women with a weak set of feminine African men. As an African, this is not a clear picture of African men. African men are strong, protective, and leaders of their tribes, not feminine men. The disturbing picture painted by this movie is a black community without men. All through the movie, I kept asking myself, where are our African men? In the movie it was said that “the man (T’Challa) is gone” but he was not the only man in the community.\n\nIn general, it was a nice movie but it did not represent the true African culture. It is just the way some people want it to be which, in my opinion, is wrong. I think there should have been a replacement for T’challa instead of giving the power to the women.\n\nMental health awareness promoted at soccer games\n\nGreen color worn as sign\n\nDelcie Sanache/Sports Editor/Nov.10\n\nThe Bandana Project, STANG, and the men’s and women’s soccer teams came together recently to support mental health awareness for student athletes.\n\nOn Oct. 25, the organizations and soccer teams encouraged students and soccer game attendees to wear green in order to raise awareness for mental health, especially for athletes. Even though the weather was not optimal, students, faculty, and families still showed up in their green attire.\n\n“I, myself, struggle with mental health, and I know it’s something that’s not easy to do. So, you know, if I can support other people, that also helps me,” Angelica Contreras, freshman on the competitive cheer team, said.\n\nWhen asked how the stigma that mental health is not as important as physical health impacts athletes, Kya Zimmerly, freshman,said, “I think it affects them a lot because when people say that, I think athletes are more likely to try to push themselves to do better, and then they have people telling them, ‘Oh, it’s just nothing to worry about.’ So, I think they just push themselves too far, and it’s something that I think coaches and teams, in general, should have a conversation about.”\n\nRhonda Martin, assistant to the athletic director, attended this game, presenting her green attire as well. She has personally witnessed the stigma surrounding mental health affecting students and athletes at Mount Mercy.\n\n“I know a lot of them are afraid to go to counseling even when they need it because it’s right there where everyone can see them walking out. They shouldn’t be afraid because mental illness is a real thing and tonot acknowledge it is worse than going and getting help,” she said.\n\nMartin also explained how MMU athletics support receiving help for mental health, “Right now, we have a new program that all of the athletes are doing where it’s an online course in mental health…and we also do bystander training and talk about mental health and where they can get help.”\n\nFree counseling services are available to anyone on the 2nd floor of the UC and at the Olson Marriage & Family Therapy Clinic at the Mount Mercy University Graduate Center.\n\nPay or Nay: Should interns be compensated for their labor?\n\nBy Jenna Welty/Campus Editor/Nov. 9\n\nInternships provide valuable work experience that prepares students for their careers after graduation, but payment for this labor is not a guarantee.\n\nRecently, the White House announced they would begin paying their interns. The organization Pay Our Interns had been advocating for this action previously and is currently working on establishing the implementation of paid internships across the country. They argue that paying interns will result in a “more equitable workforce (and) more diverse leadership.”\n\nThrough the payment of interns, more students are given the opportunity to succeed or participate.\n\nIn the example of internships at the White House, living in Washington D.C. is costly, and giving some type of compensation lessens the blow and allows more people to participate realistically.\n\nProviding a wage for labor seems like a basic requirement, but some say interns are being “paid” with experience and any opportunities that may arise after their service. Students also receive school credit for their internships, which some people also view as a type of “payment.”\n\nHowever, working for free outside of class is not a feasible prospect for the average college student. Time is money, especially when years and years are required to pay off student loans.\n\nLeave free labor to volunteer work and pay interns for the work they execute.\n\nAI in healthcare making strides\n\nBy Delcie Sanache/Sports Editor/Oct. 26\n\nOn Oct. 4, the third Fall Faculty Series presentation took place. Melodie Jolly’s “The A.I. Doctor Will See You Now”: A Look at the Current Influences and Future Projections of A.I. in Healthcare discussed the current use of artificial intelligence in the healthcare field and how it could be applied in the future.\n\nJolly, assistant professor of Nursing, began her presentation by asking the audience an important question, what is artificial intelligence? According to her, “It is a software program, but not just any software program. It’s not something you find on your computer. It is something that is able to learn. It’s able to analyze. It’s able to predict. It’s able to help us.”\n\nShe says that as humans, we give them the supplies they need to succeed, and we are getting closer to having AI systems advanced enough to where they work like a human’s biological system. However, even the current AI system’s capabilities are “remarkable.”\n\nIt is vital for a healthcare professional to know what is wrong with their patient in order to properly treat them and to avoid a misdiagnosis; this is where AI comes into play. Jolly says that there have been numerous amounts of research over how well physicians were able to look at a 12-lead EKG and tell if someone is having a heart attack.\n\n“That’s critical. We have a saying in healthcare: time is tissue. If I am spending more time trying to figure out if you do or do not have a heart attack going on right that second, that could cost you valuable time which means you are going to be losing more and more tissue,” Jolly said.\n\nThe research she presented showed that on average, only 55-67% of physicians can detect if someone is having a heart attack which means there is still a considerable amount of heart attacks going unnoticed. Physicians still in their residency were usually represented in the lower percentages while cardiologists made up the higher percentages. One physician even had an accuracy rating of 93%. After reflecting on this research, Jolly said, “We’re not consistent here. That kind of scares me.”\n\nThese studies also provided different AI systems with EKG readings that were confirmed by a physician to belong to someone having a heart attack. While looking at these, the AI systems had an astounding accuracy reading of 81-95%.\n\nAnother use of AI could be in diagnosing pediatric leukemia patients. A specific type of leukemia, acute lymphocytic, typically presents in children as the common cold. Because of this, many cases are misdiagnosed, and when the children come back to the physician later, the leukemia is already much more advanced.\n\n“We need early detection,” Jolly emphasized, “We have an AI system that all we have to do is take some blood, feed it to the AI system, and they’re able to pick up and detect the specific white blood cell that is affected…and with 97-98% accuracy, be able to say yes you do have this cancer,”\n\nTowards the end of her presentation, Jolly discussed a third use for AI systems: finding connections between certain medications and their side effects and how to eliminate these reactions. She says one of her biggest difficulties as a nurse is when her patients come to her with horrible side effects from medication and she doesn’t know why or how to fix it.\n\nJolly informed the audience of her reaction to this research, “Now we can know, and I’m excited for that, very excited for that.”\n\nMount Mercy welcomes new faculty members to campus this Fall\n\nBy Kevenson Nelson/Staff Writer/Sept. 28, 2022\n\nMount Mercy University has recently welcomed five new faculty members to campus: Sonja Bock, visiting assistant professor; Natasha Clark, assistant professor; Jack Frank, assistant professor of music/director of bands; Rebecca Louison, assistant professor of psychology; and Tammy Pickart, assistant professor of nursing.\n\nSonja Bock, visiting assistant professor, has her B.A. from Buena Vista University and her M.A. in Sociology from the University of Northern Iowa. She was asked to join the faculty and was glad to do so. She thinks that the campus is beautiful, and the students are amazing.\n\nRebecca Louison, assistant professor, is somewhat new to the full-time faculty this fall–last year, she was an adjunct faculty on campus. She has also been part of the MMU community since 2013. She received her B.S. in Psychology from Mount Mercy in 2015, her M.A. in Marriage and Family Therapy in 2019, and she is currently all but dissertation (ABD) for her doctorate in Marriage and Family Therapy in the neuroscience track. So, she has strong roots at Mount Mercy, and it has always been her goal to come back and teach.\n\nShe came to campus as a nontraditional student, navigating going back to school after already starting a family. She was uncertain about what she wanted to do with her life and even where she wanted to go after school. After meeting with Dr. Drew, who was her advisor at the time and currently a valued colleague and mentor, she knew this was going to be a great decision. The faculty, staff admission, and student body are approachable, compassionate, and welcoming.\n\nLouison not only teaches, but is also active in research, and is a therapist as well. She brings a clinical perspective to the faculty with diverse experience.\n\nTammy Pickart, assistant professor of nursing, has been in nursing education since 2009. She started her educational career teaching at a local high school, the health science academy, or the certified nursing assistant (CAN) program. She took a break from teaching to pursue her M.A. in nursing education. In 2016, she began a full-time nursing faculty at Kirkwood Community College, teaching the Associate Degree in Nursing (AND) program. She has been pursuing her doctorate in Nursing Education and has always wanted to teach at a university. Tammy is a 2005 graduate from Mount Mercy with her B.A. in nursing and enjoyed her time here at MMU as a student. She was thrilled when this position became available and even more excited when she was offered a faculty position. She chose to come to Mount Mercy because of the teaching atmosphere, dedication to student success, positive community influence, and beautiful campus.\n\nSGA describes spending plan at first assembly\n\nBy Rebecca Lenton/Staff Writer/Sept.13, 2022\n\nThe major theme of the discussion at the Student Government’s first General Assembly Aug. 29 was “For the Students, By the Students,” a funding program that allows students to fill out an additional funds request form, requesting money for an event, merchandise or any other type of purchase that benefits the student or university.\n\n“I am super excited for all our clubs and organizations to host their own events and to see students back on campus enjoying them,” said Student Government Association president Tiara Muñoz.\n\nThe General Assembly also gave clubs a chance for clubs to understand budgeting and advertisement for the year ahead. Clubs and organizations had a further opportunity to reach out to different representatives, which allowed the Student Government Association to understand how to better support them.\n\nConversations also took place regarding two brand new committees that are being formed on campus for both policies of freedom of expression and LGBTQ.\n\nThe General Assembly met on Sept. 12 as well and will again on Oct. 3 at 3:30.\n\nMount Mercy Welcome Week This Year Breaks the Norm\n\nBy Kevin Fiedler/staff writer/Sept. 11, 2022\n\nDuring this year’s welcome week for Mount Mercy’s incoming freshman, which occurred Aug. 20-23, there was an event to unofficially break the world record of most people down a slip n’ slide in one hour.\n\nStarting off welcome week, the incoming freshman were put into groups and attended a picnic. This event was different from last year because it was held indoors due to weather conditions. At the end of the night, a plaza party was held which consisted of corn hole, s’mores, spike ball, and Connect Four.\n\nOn the second day, the new students had an adventure day.\n\n“Adventure Day this year went a lot different from previous years. Due to the lack of transportation the students couldn’t go hiking or take a visit to Lost Island. However, we did have a choice to go mini golfing or visit capital spare time entertainment,” Grace Kelly, Mustang welcome leader, said. An outdoor movie ended the night, playing “Grown Ups.”\n\nThe third day consisted of Mount Mercy’s campus traditions and some entertainment. Everyone got together and planted a class tree on the north side of the chapel. After that they went into the tunnels and signed their names on the walls. To end their day, they went to Im On Ice to go ice skating.\n\nOn the last day, while student attending various events, Dr. Nate Klein, vice president of student success, set up the slip n’ slide in order to unofficially break the world record for most people down a slip n’ slide in an hour. Mount Mercy students managed to break the record by sending 789 people down the slide.\n\n“It was so exciting to see students coming together for some simple fun to kick off the year,” Klein said. “I heard many students say it’s the most fun they’ve had during their time on the Hill which made it all worthwhile. A special thanks to our facilities department for helping us get it set up and making sure the slide that got a bit muddy toward the end is back to green space for us all to enjoy!”\n\nGrad student began career in pandemic, loves teaching\n\nBy Annie Barkalow/managing editor/March 31, 2022\n\nIt’s 8:30 a.m. and Ms. Thul’s fourth grade class is just getting started.\n\nTwinkle lights surround the blackboard and a sign on the door says, “our classroom respects others.” Brightly- colored paper stars decorate a cabinet with students’ goals for the year written in crayon, stating things like “I want to make more friends,” or “I want to get better at fractions.” The atmosphere is somewhat subdued, and you get the sense that the kids are still waking up, although that doesn’t stop some of them from fidgeting in their seats or whispering to their neighbor.\n\nOne student walks up to Ms. Thul and compares heights, and she laughs.\n\n“They like to constantly remind me of how much taller most people are than me,” she says.\n\nKatie Thul is a graduate student at MMU studying teacher leadership with aspirations of becoming an instructional coach or principal, and currently teaches at Francis Marion Intermediate (FMI) in Marion. She graduated from University of Iowa in 2020 with a degree in elementary ed with a reading endorsement right after the pandemic hit, and it’s been a bumpy ride ever since.\n\n“I just felt so defeated and so lost and just so sad,” says Thul, recalling how she felt after graduation with lock downs in full swing. Up until she worked at FMI, she had never taught a full day of school, since the pandemic shut everything down.\n\nFor Thul, the key to pushing through and being successful are passion and having supportive staff. When she began teaching at FMI, principal Mike Murphy and instructional coach Steph Roberts were a source of encouragement, even stepping in to co-teach several times until she was comfortable with it.\n\n“Having at least one person that you know you can walk in and say whatever is on your mind is so important as a teacher,” says Thul. “Even if it’s at your school, if it’s at home, by having one person that you can just spill to, because you do wear so many hats and you hear so many things, you see so many things…(it’s) a lot to carry, so having somebody to get that all of that out too is really important.”\n\nOne positive aspect of teaching during the pandemic as a new teacher was the ability to quickly adapt. “I had so much momentum and motivation because it was brand-new…walking into hybrid was the only way of teaching I knew because I had never done anything else,” she says.\n\nLike other places, teacher shortages have been a problem at FMI. When a teacher is out sick with COVID-19, it sometimes means other school personnel pick up the slack, since qualified substitutes are currently difficult to obtain. Thul remembers a couple of weeks that were “nuts” when many teachers were sick and other teachers taught more than one classroom.\n\n“There’s definitely harder days where I’m like, ‘Can I do this?’ ‘Am I going to get through?’” she says, though she notes that the feeling mainly stems from negative student behaviors. Behaviors, she says, are the biggest challenge in teaching right now, noting that a lot of the disrespect and misbehaving stem from trauma in the home.\n\n“It’s easier for me to not take it personally, because I know (they’re) not mad at me, it’s not me (they) don’t like, it’s the situation (they’re in) or feeling,” she says. “When I go home, I’m worrying about them…when I know they’re going to situations that stink. Honestly, I think that’s the hardest part, knowing (about) their lives outside of academics and not being able to do a bunch about it besides love them while they’re here.”\n\nFor new education graduates, Thul says it’s important to remind yourself of the bigger picture. “It’s the profession that teaches all professions,” she says, “you are so valued…even if you can’t see it right now, you’re making a difference. You’re making an impact and it’s going to be worth it.\n\n“I don’t know what else I would do…now that I’ve done it, I know that this is what I’m supposed to be doing, because I love it and I love the kids.”\n\nWar in Europe FAQ’s\n\nBy Gwen Johnson/opinion editor/March 3, 2022\n\nWar has come again to Europe, with Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, and independent nation to its south. To help Mustangs get some context on this historic tragedy, the Times has prepared this explanation of the conflict.\n\nQ: What is the historical context of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and when did the most recent conflict between the two nations begin?\n\nA: Ukraine has been an independent nation since 1991. The BBC says that “president Putin has frequently accused Ukraine of being taken over by extremists, ever since its pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in 2014 after months of protests against his rule.”\n\n2014 was also the year that Russia illegally annexed Crimea, breaking a treaty that said it would respect the country’s borders in exchange for its denuclearization.\n\nThe BBC also says that “late in 2021, Russia began deploying big numbers of troops close to Ukraine’s borders, while repeatedly denying it was going to attack. Then Mr. Putin scrapped a 2015 peace deal for the east and recognized areas under rebel control as independent.”\n\nAccording to NPR, “Putin himself has long said that he believes Ukrainians and Russians to be a single people, unified by language, culture and religion. In July 2021, he wrote a long essay about the ‘historical unity’ between the two nations.”\n\nQ: How is NATO involved in the Russia/Ukraine conflict?\n\nA: For context, NATO was formed after World War II to represent Western interests in Europe. Any European country can join, but Vladmir Putin believes that allowing Ukraine to join would break a promise from the 90s that NATO would not expand. This was brought up in early stages of negotiation at the time, but not formally offered in later stages. Putin sees the expansion of NATO to include Ukraine, the second-largest piece of the former USSR, as a threat to Russia.\n\nQ: What has President Biden said about the conflict so far?\n\nA: President Biden has called the conflict a “needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.” He has also announced economic sanctions against Russian banks.\n\nQ: Why is the conflict in Ukraine important to Iowans?\n\nA: This conflict means that prices for energy, food and raw materials could increase, and related supply chains could be further disrupted. It also means that we need to be extra mindful of the existence of disinformation and make doubly sure to verify that any information we share on the internet is reliable.\n\nFacebook’s parent company caught two small scale Russian disinformation campaigns in their early stages. There were about 40 Facebook and Instagram accounts involved in the first, posting from Russia and Ukraine and calling the latter a failed state. The accounts were posing as independent media outlets.\n\nAccording to NPR, “The focus of the efforts appeared to be driving traffic to the network’s own websites, Meta said, and the network posted across social media, including on Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and Russian social networks VK and Odnoklassniki. On Facebook and Instagram, it accumulated fewer than 5,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram. The company did not say how many people interacted with or saw its posts.”\n\nQ: Is there any chance this could signal the start of World War III, and what would that mean?\n\nA: There are 30 members of NATO, and we are obligated to defend them should Russia attack. This is stated by Article 5 of that treaty. The unclear element is cyberattacks. It would be a clear violation of Article 5 if traditional fighting spilled over into a neighboring NATO country, but if a cyberattack did something like cut power in one of those places, it may also count. This is not quite as clear since the tactic is so new.\n\nIt was recently announced that Ukrainian and Russian officials will meet for peace talks, but the announcement did not specify when.\n\nQ: Are we vulnerable to and likely to see Russian cyberattacks?\n\nA: NPR has reported that “various federal agencies, including the Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security, have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators.”\n\nFinal note: The Times advises you to get your news from multiple reliable sources and remember that all Mount Mercy students have access to the New York Times, which has live updates of the situation in Ukraine. In addition to the BBC, information in this story came from NPR’s special series “Ukraine invasion—explained.”\n\nRetired GE Executive to Deliver Knapp Lecture\n\nBy Vanessa Gaul/staff writer/March 3, 2022\n\nA distinguished businessman will be present at several events on campus in early March as part of the Knapp lecture series.\n\nOn Thursday, March 3, the business department is hosting Mr. John G. Rice, retired vice chairman of GE, at three events. The first event will entail a meeting with undergraduate students in Flaherty from 2:30-3:30 p.m., which is hosted by three business clubs: Enactus, Investments, and SHRM. Then, Rice will be meeting with graduate students at the Graduate Center from 3:30-4:30 p.m. To close the event, Rice will address students and the community at-large “Lessons I’ve Learned” at 7 p.m. in the UC.\n\nRice has been president & CEO of GE Technology Infrastructure, GE Energy and GE Transportation at different times throughout his career. His career began in 1978 where he held several leadership positions in the United States, Canada, and Singapore.\n\nRice holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, and is a life trustee there. He currently serves on several boards such as Baker Hughes, the Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and he is also on the President’s Council of the Hazelton Betty Ford Foundation. Additionally, Rice serves as a senior advisor for the G-100 companies and is a senior professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech.\n\nThroughout his life, Rice has been immersed in the business world and has valuable knowledge and advice to share. These events will teach others about business and how to be successful in the field.\n\nJoy is the Root of God’s Unconditional Love for All\n\nBy Vanessa Milliman/staff writer/March 3, 2022\n\nWhat does it mean to seek joy? How will we know when we have found it? Seek God in all things, and you will find God in all things. Seek joy in all things, and you will find joy in all things. The joy in Christ is sustainable for all eternity. While it is often associated with being happy, joy surpasses our emotions. External forces have no effect. This joy is the foundation of our lives. We were created by love, out of love, and for love. Joy has been defined as “the experience of knowing you are unconditionally loved.” Loved. Unconditionally.\n\nHow can we be joyful when we are suffering? Look at suffering from God’s perspective. He sees the bigger picture and knows the meaning of suffering. As humans, we only see one piece of the puzzle. Joy comes with the understanding that love continues even when we are suffering. We are not limited by requirements, conditions, or circumstances. Loved. Unconditionally.\n\nThink back to when you woke up this morning. I probably groaned as my alarm clock chirped away. I should have found joy in knowing that God gave me the gift of another day. One day can have so many moments of joy. Assuming you get eight hours of sleep, you have 16 hours for knowing that you are unconditionally loved. For college students, we get even more hours in the day to know that we are loved. Unconditionally.\n\nThe joys of everyday life can be overlooked easily. We are busy with our “to-do” lists and what are calendar dictates us to do next. The innocence of a child provides insight into where they find their joy. Children find joy in the simplest tasks. They can be bouncing a ball and find so much joy in it. A child wants an action to be repeated over and over again. My younger siblings loved peek-a-boo. Each time they reacted like it was the first time. They found joy in those moments and must have known they were loved. Unconditionally.\n\nWe can have this childlike joy in our lives as well. The boring tasks can bring joy if we look for it. My goal for the next couple of weeks is to find joy in brushing my teeth. Brushing my teeth can become the most mundane of tasks. It takes time that I would rather be doing something else (anything else to be honest). I can turn this into a moment of joy. I can acknowledge that I am taking care of myself by doing this. I can use this time to be in the moment, to be present. I can simply contemplate how I am loved. Unconditionally.\n\nBy Annie Barkalow/managing editor/March 3, 2022\n\nIn years past, the Times has taken several first-place awards at the Iowa College Media Association (ICMA) awards, and this year was no different–with the exception that a first first was awarded to a Mount Mercy University student. Senior Jada Veasey, Times editor-in-chief, won the “Pat Pisarik Student Journalist of the Year” award, a first-time honor for MMU and the Times. What makes this journalism award even more remarkable is that Veasey is not a journalism student herself, but a nursing major.\n\n“(She) is basically the most outstanding student journalist in the state of Iowa,” said Joe Sheller, professor of communications and adviser to the Times. “The judges cited Veasey’s leadership in covering the pandemic as a factor in her win. Along with a certificate of recognition, the award also comes with a $500 stipend.\n\nThe Student Journalist of the Year award is named after Pat Pisarik, a journalism professor at Loras College and founding member of ICMA, who “passionately embraced the role of the press as unbiased contributors to democracy and as a voice for the marginalized.”\n\nVeasey, who is passionate about writing, politics, and current events, has been involved with the Times since she was a freshman. She began as a staff writer and work study student, became opinion editor her sophomore and junior years, and editor-in-chief her senior year. She found out she was a finalist for the award at the end of January.\n\n“I was so excited. I didn’t think there was any way I’d win, I was just excited to be named a finalist,” said Veasey. When her name was called as the winner, Veasey was back home hanging out with her mom. “My mom and I screamed in our living room!” she said.\n\nVeasey’s professors say having a student like Jada is what makes their job “so rewarding.”\n\n“Jada is perhaps one of the most caring and conscientious students I have ever had an opportunity to teach,” said Audrey Sheller, assistant professor of nursing. “Knowing that Jada is soon to enter the profession of nursing makes me feel so honored and blessed to have been able to teach her. She is going to do such amazing things in this world both in the profession of nursing and far beyond!”\n\nWhile Jada loves nursing, she said working for the Times has been “something special” and one of her favorite parts of college.\n\n“Getting to learn from Joe (Sheller) and from other editors has been so awesome. I’m going to miss the late nights in the office once I graduate,” she said.\n\nAs editor-in-chief, one of Veasey’s main goals has been to brainstorm how to keep it running once she is gone. “Historically, we’ve had a way bigger staff and had lots of underclassmen who could step up after people graduate. Right now, all but two members of our staff are graduating either in May or next December. I’m just trying to find some Mustangs who love writing and love journalism and want to keep this awesome publication afloat in the coming years. Student journalism is so important and if the Times disappears, I think students are going to realize they don’t have an easy avenue to voice their thoughts on campus,” she said.\n\nOther awards that were given out:\n\nFirst place, investigative reporting, Annie Barkalow.\n\nFirst place, staff editorial, Jada Veasey, Gwen Johnson, and Veronica Jons.\n\nFirst place, front page, Veronica Jons and Jada Veasey.\n\nFirst place, blog, “Anne with an E,” Annie Barkalow.\n\nSecond place, blog, “The Girl in the Chair,” Gwen Johnson.\n\nSecond place, headline writing, Veronica Jons and Jada Veasey.\n\nVeronica Jons is an MMU alumni who graduated last spring and was former editor-in-chief of the Times. Annie Barkalow is a junior and the current managing editor, and Gwen Johnson is a senior and the Times’ opinion editor.\n\nDriven by Love\n\nBy Jenna Welty/staff writer/March 3, 2022\n\nLove was the primary message weaving the words of prized poet Danez Smith’s performance and Q&A for the Visiting Writer Series celebrating Black History Month.\n\n“It’s always about love,” Smith said. “Poems are just little containers of humanness; proof that we were here, and we felt.”\n\nOn Feb. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Betty Cherry Heritage Hall, students and faculty members gathered to hear and ask questions about Smith’s diverse voice and these words of endearment. A student also presented the poet with a gift at the conclusion of the event.\n\nMary Vermillion, the director of the visiting writer program and professor of English, introduced Smith to the audience, praising their literary accomplishments and defining their poetry as “urgent and relevant.”\n\nAfter suggesting the game of Twister as an addition to the night’s plans, Smith began with a performance of their 2016 poem, “My President.” They continued by reciting a multitude of their accomplished poems, including their most famous, “Dinosaurs in the Hood.”\n\nDetailing the idea of making a movie where “Jurassic Park meets Friday meets The Pursuit of Happyness,” the latter is a “love poem towards childhood innocence.”\n\n“Besides, the only reason I want to make this is for that first scene anyway: the little black boy on the bus with a toy dinosaur, his eyes wide and endless his dreams possible, pulsing, and right there,” Smith read aloud.\n\nThe crowd exhibited mixed emotions. They laughed with Smith in the humorous moments and sat quietly during the serious ones. Often, these occurred back-to-back as Smith’s voice fluttered and boomed across the room, drawing the audience in, and their body language mimicking the words they spoke.\n\nTheir eyes were wide with the boy on the bus. They held an imaginary wine glass and raised their hand at the bus stop in “My President.”\n\nThe Q&A brought additional insight to the audience, from questions about the publishing process to dealing with wariness about putting out one’s own voice. But Smith assured that there is “no way to control people’s takeaways.”\n\n“It’s a moment of releasing,” Smith said. “When you are coming from a place that is trying to transcribe and amplify love, you get it right.”\n\nTo show appreciation for these answers, the performance, and workshop, Smith was presented with a framed poster of one of their poems designed by Teodora Simovic, junior, graphic design major.\n\n“It was definitely an honor to do this and be part of this event,” Simovic said. “All the work that was done behind the scenes and the final poster turned out to be great, and I’m really glad that they liked it too.”\n\nThe words of Smith’s poem entitled “Summer, Somewhere” were encapsulated in the poster, acting as a reminder to broaden perspectives, learn about social issues, and admire the love present in one’s life. As one line in the poem poignantly asks, “do you know what it’s like to live someplace that loves you back?”\n\nAs New SGA Officers Begin Terms, ‘Hot Lunch, Hot Topics’ Start\n\nBy Autumn Puffer/Feb. 17, 2022\n\nWith the new year came new SGA executives and cabinet members. At the Jan. 10 general assembly, former SGA President Emma Lantz started the inauguration, passing her responsibilities to now President Tiara Muñoz.\n\nThe new Executive team is listed as follows:\n\nPresident – Tiara Muñoz (Junior Criminal Justice/Psych major)\n\nVice President – Fernanda Hermosillo-Arrieta (Junior Bio/BioChem major)\n\nTreasurer – Alison Taylor (Sophomore Accounting major)\n\nSecretary – Zoey Paone (Sophomore Criminal Justice/English major)\n\nThe new Cabinet includes:\n\nActivities Coordinator – Houston Hamlett (Freshman Social Work major)\n\nCoordinator of Clubs – Nathalie Primbs (Freshman Computer Science/Business major)\n\nDirector of Public Relations – Autumn Puffer (Freshman Criminal Justice/Political Science major)\n\nAdministrative Assistant – Amelia Frimml (Freshman Secondary Education major)\n\nLeave it on the Floor Friday has also been revamped. It is now “Hot Lunch Hot Topics Wednesday” and will be hosted on the third Wednesday of each month in the University Center Commons from12-1 p.m. The first ever HLHTW event was hosted Feb. 16, and the discussion question was: “what’s the difference between non-racist and anti-racist?” Next month, the question will be focused on Mount Mercy’s critical concern of women.\n\nSGA is happy to announce the construction for the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) room has officially started. This project has been in the making for two years, and once completed will provide a safe space for minority and historically underrepresented students. Progress will be posted weekly on MMU’s DEI Instagram, @mmu_dei.\n\nAlong with an at-large position, SGA is looking for student representatives to fulfill seats on Senate. Each Senate seat would represent a different group of students, including international, transfer, commuter, and non-traditional students. These representatives would attend one meeting a month and give a voice to the students they oversee.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for one of these positions, please contact SGA at sga@mtmercy.edu for more information.\n\nTo keep up with SGA, make sure to follow @mountmercysga on Instagram and “Mount Mercy University Student Government Association” on Facebook.\n\nWeek a Chance to Say Thanks to MMU Donors\n\nBy Grace Ries/news editor/Feb. 17, 2022\n\nFrom Jan. 31 to Feb. 4, Mount Mercy students, faculty, and staff had the opportunity to write thank you letters to all the donors that support Mount Mercy University during an event called Thank-a-Thon Week.\n\n“The purpose was to share that most everything at Mount Mercy is made possible through support of donors and alumni, and to come together as a community to show our gratitude for those who support Mount Mercy with monetary donations,” Janey Jill Piersall, MMU development and alumni coordinator, said.\n\nThere are over 2,000 donors each year that support MMU and throughout Thank-a-Thon week, Development and Alumni Relations received over 400 thank you cards.\n\nFreshman Dylanne Schrock was one of the students who help with the event, and she was able to talk to other students and help them appreciate the donors of Mount Mercy through writing letters and getting to know more about what the purpose was.\n\n“I loved participating in the Thank-a-Thon. It was a great opportunity to make new connections with other students at Mount Mercy and also volunteer for a great cause. Everyone was so kind and willing to participate and help write out thank you cards. Without the help of the volunteers and the participants, this event would not have been as great as it was,” Schrock said.\n\nThe event was coordinated by Development and Alumni Relations. Piersall partnered with Janya Witzany, a student employee in the office and a MMU women’s softball player, to make it all a reality with the guidance from others in the office.\n\n“The week wouldn’t have been possible or as successful without help and support from so many other campus partners, including: Financial Aid, the Events team, the Volunteer & Service coordinator, Athletics, Student Services, the Registrar’s office, the professors who invited us into their classes and/or encouraged participation, and the volunteers who helped us staff the Thank-a-Thon tables – our department’s staff, graduate admissions staff and the women’s soccer team,” Piersall said.\n\nPiersall and Schrock were both so thankful and found this to be important to do again in the following years.\n\n“Thank-a-thon is important to MMU so we can acknowledge our amazing donors,” Schrock said. “Getting people involved to write personal letters is so important because it shows that we really are grateful for our amazing donors. Giving personal thanks keeps our donors around!”\n\nBy Jenna Welty/staff writer/Feb. 17, 2022\n\nAn accomplished performer and author, Danez Smith, will visit campus for a poetry workshop, reading, and Q&A Feb. 23 in BettyCherry Heritage Hall. Smith will give an expressive performance as well as sign books during their time on campus as part of the Visiting Writer Series.\n\n“Smith’s poetry has won tons of awards,” said Mary Vermillion, the director of the visiting writer program and professor of English. “They were a finalist for the National Book Award!”\n\nNot only is Smith’s work esteemed, but they havebeen “a successful poet both on the stage and the page.” With a performance accompanying their workshop, students will see the impact of Smith’s writing firsthand. Smith will give a workshop at 2 p"
