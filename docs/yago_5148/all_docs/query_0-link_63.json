        "text": "Pop quiz: What do Jill Hennessy and Caroline Rhea have in common? Hint: they're not both made of delicious maple syrup. They are both Canadians who headed south to try to make it in the entertainment biz. And succeeded, big time.\n\nJill scored with her role as DA Claire Kincaid in what some might call the glory days of 'Law & Order', later tracked down criminals on 'Crossing Jordan' and is now minding Dustin Hoffman's horses on HBO's 'Luck'. And Caroline, of course, is the razorsharp standup comic who found fame in 'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch' and was hand-picked by Rosie O'Donnell to take over her talk show.\n\nMore importantly, Jill and Caroline are returning to their Canadian roots, appearing in 'Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town'. The CBC TV-movie re-imagines Stephen Leacock's classic book about life in small-town Canada, with bits of the author's life. And while our comedians are world-famous today (much obliged, Russell Peters), Leacock's book actually turns 100 this year. Yep, our comedians have been making people laugh for a century, folks.\n\nSunshine Sketches is also the first major project that Jill and Caroline have worked on together. Ah, humour, good acting and community-building - how Canadian can you get?"
