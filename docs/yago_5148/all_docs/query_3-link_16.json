        "text": "Film Premiere to Highlight Teaching Symposium\n\nThe premiere of a new three-part film series titled \"Only\" a Teacher, by independent filmmaker Claudia Levin, will provide the backdrop for \"The State of Teaching in America,\" a two-day education symposium at Smith on Friday and Saturday, November 3 and 4. The symposium, which will be held in Wright auditorium, is a collaboration among Levin, the Department of Education and Child Study and the Project on Women and Social Change, of which Levin is a research associate. \"The State of Teaching in America\" will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, information and opinions by some of the leading figures in educational research and reform.\n\n\"Only\" a Teacher, which is scheduled to be broadcast on PBS next year, examines the changing role of the American teacher from the mid-1800s to the present. The three-part series will be distributed with an accompanying textbook published by McGraw-Hill.\n\nEach episode of \"Only\" a Teacher presents a story that involves present-day educational practices and issues, then explores the story's historical context. Episode one, \"A Teacher Affects Eternity,\" to be shown on November 4 at 10 a.m., examines the mid-1800s when free public schooling was spreading across the nation and women began filling the ranks of teachers. Episode two, \"Those Who Can . . . Teach,\" to be screened on November 3 at 7 p.m., traces the early development of school bureaucracies, the rise of teachers' unions, and America's ambivalence toward a profession practiced mostly by women. The third episode, \"Educating to End Inequity,\" which will be shown November 4 at 1:30 p.m., surveys issues of school reform and considers their relationship to social change from the late 19th century to the present.\n\nPanel discussions will follow the screening of each episode during the symposium, bringing together teachers and scholars to discuss teacher training, professional recognition, working conditions, unions, and the teacher's role in the struggle for social change.\n\nAlso, two keynote addresses will be delivered. Theodore Sizer, chair of the Coalition of Essential Schools and professor emeritus of education at Brown University, will give the first, \"A Happy Place to Work,\" on November 3, at 4 p.m. Sonia Nieto, professor of language, literacy and culture in the School of Education at UMass, and a leading scholar of multicultural education, will talk on \"What Keeps Teachers Going?\" on November 4 at 11 a.m. A reception in Wright common room will conclude each day's schedule.\n\nLevin says that she first became interested in filmmaking because she saw it as a way to promote education. She was inspired to make \"Only\" a Teacher, she says, after reading Woman's True Profession, by Nancy Hoffman, a book about teachers. \"The accounts in that book were so compelling and exciting,\" recalls Levin. \"The more I researched, the more I realized that while we look to our schools to influence our society, we never talk about teachers. Only now, in the year 2000, are we beginning a national dialogue on the subject.\"\n\nLevin, who has produced numerous films for public television and museums, says she is grateful for the support she has received from Smith and its Project on Women and Social Change. She credits her production team for making her film series a reality.\n\n\"Only\" a Teacher was also sponsored by the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Katherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the William and Flora Hewitt Association. The project has also received support from the state humanities councils of Massachusetts, South Carolina, North Carolina, New York and California.\n\nFor more information on \"The State of Teaching in America\" or \"Only\" a Teacher, or for the symposium schedule, consult www.onlyateacher.com, or call extension 3557.\n\nCromwell Day to Feature Music, Poetry, Discussion\n\nThis year's Otelia Cromwell Day events, which will take place from Sunday, October 29, through Friday, November 3, will build upon a series of articles that ran in the New York Times during the summer under the title \"How Race Is Lived in America.\" The series focused in detail on more than a dozen situations and relationships that characterized the condition of modern race relations. Extending the concept addressed in the New York Times series, the Otelia Cromwell Day planning committee has adopted the title \"How Race Is Lived in American Institutions.\"\n\n\"While the project revealed much about individual encounters with race in America, it lent very little insight into the historical circumstances that give rise to present day race relations,\" say committee cochairs Brenda Allen, director of institutional diversity, and Ann Ferguson, assistant professor of Afro-American studies, of the New York Times series. \"Race is not only lived in our everyday personal lives, but also lived and manifested in cultural, social and political institutions. Therefore, this year's planning committee wanted to address how racism in American institutions serves as the context in which race is lived in America.\"\n\nToward that end, the committee has planned events that address two different aspects of institutional racism: the possible debt owed to racial minorities for past exploitation; and institutional racism as it exists in today's publishing industry.\n\n\"Because many argue that the only real discussion of racism is occurring within popular culture, specifically music and the arts,\" say Allen and Ferguson, this year's events will include two concerts, one of blues and another of gospel, plus a spoken-word performance.\n\nPhiladelphia's renowned Gabriel Hardeman Delegation will kick off the symposium on October 29, at 2 p.m. in Helen Hills Hills Chapel. On November 1, a poetry slam and open microphone, featuring Queen Godis, will take place at 8 p.m. in the Mendenhall CPA, room t-100. The blues concert, featuring guitarist/singer/songwriter Deborah Coleman and harmonica legend Carey Bell, will take place on November 2, Otelia Cromwell Day, at 7 p.m. in John M. Greene Hall.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 2, a panel discussion, \"Reparations: The Case for Compensations for Past Injuries to Racial and Ethnic Minorities in the United States,\" will take place from 1:10 to 3:15 p.m. in Sweeney Auditorium, Sage. The panel will be chaired by Ferguson with participation by Ronald Walters, of the University of Maryland, and Phillip A. Klinker, of Hamilton College. Following the panel, at 3:30 p.m., a panel, titled \"Dark Matter: Adventures in Publishing,\" will be chaired by Andrea Hairston, associate professor of theater. Panel members will include Sheree Renée Thomas, editor of Dark Matter, a compilation of speculative fiction from writers of the African diaspora, and contributors to the publication, with responses by Meridians senior editor Kum-Kum Bhavnani. On November 3, at 4:30 p.m., the symposium will close with readings from Dark Matter and a panel moderated by Hairston.\n\nOtelia Cromwell Day events are sponsored by the Office of Institutional Diversity.\n\nHelpful Hints for Parking Etiquette\n\nIn the wake of new alternate side of the street parking regulations on streets near the Quad enacted by the Northampton City Council, some students and staff have opted to park on streets on the other side of Elm Street. City Councilor Frances Volkmann and neighbors have noted that, on Franklin Street, cars are parked \"pretty much bumper to bumper and most of these cars are left parked for days, in a couple of cases, weeks.\"\n\nThis would not be of such concern were it not for a difficult and unusual situation taking place in a cluster of houses near the Elm Street end of Franklin. In three of these households there are people in relatively late stages of cancer who rely on service providers and family for many of their needs. Volkmann reports that \"the ways in which the cars are parked make it difficult for cars to enter or exit the narrow driveways that front onto the narrow street. Franklin has been effectively made into a one-way street in this area. The obstacles that the residents face in getting to hospitals and doctors, getting Hospice help, and so on, are making an already difficult situation really awful for them.\n\n\"Obviously, those who are parking on Franklin don't know what is going on there. I'm sure that most of them would try to take into account the needs of the people who live there if they knew or thought about it.\"\n\nVolkmann suggests that adhering to the following set of guidelines would mitigate not only the circumstances on Franklin Street but the general parking crunch in the neighborhoods surrounding the college.\n\nGuidelines for Considerate Parking\n\n1. Don't park close to driveways. People can't see to back out if cars are too close. There is a city ordinance that requires cars to be backed off at least three feet on either side of driveways. But five or eight feet would be even better.\n\n2. Don't block the path from a house to the street. Residents need to use their paths, and visitors and service providers need them as well.\n\n3. Don't take up the last space in front of a house. There are many places to park in the neighborhoods near the college. Often, choosing a place a few houses down the block will work just as well for the person who needs to park and will make life very much easier for the residents of the houses on the street.\n\n4. Don't use the streets in front of people's houses for long-term parking. There is an ordinance that enables the city to ticket and tow cars left on the street for more than three days as \"abandoned vehicles.\" The city does not choose to enforce this ordinance except under extreme circumstances. But the streets in front of people's houses are not meant to be long-term parking lots. In addition, in snow emergencies cars left on the streets will be ticketed and towed. Space is available in downtown lots at modest rates (call 587-1267).\n\n5. Don't trash the neighborhood, with either litter or noise. Unless your car is registered in Massachusetts and you're insured and paying excise taxes in Northampton, you are a guest here. If you park and act in ways that are considerate and thoughtful of the people who live in college neighborhoods both they and you will benefit.\n\nSmith Students Subject of New Comedy Film\n\nIn a new, independent film, The Acting Class, two naïve Smith students (an anomaly?), try to locate a renowned acting guru who presides over a decidedly odd acting class and, through a series of hilarious interviews with his students, uncover the truth about the supposed genius.\n\nThe Acting Class -- one of more than 50 films to be screened at this year's Northampton Film Festival, which runs from Wednesday through Sunday, November 1-5 -- was directed by filmmakers Jill Hennessy (Law and Order, I Shot Andy Warhol) and Smith alumna Elizabeth Holder '92. The film will be shown on November 4 at 3 p.m. in Wright auditorium. Last year, the two teamed to make a film titled The Weekend Getaway, which was featured at the 1999 Northampton Film Festival.\n\nThe Acting Class stars Hennessy and includes guest appearances by Hennessy's costars from Law and Order Chris Noth, Ben Bratt and Jerry Orbach, as well as Alec Baldwin. Smith alumna Jody Booth '92 is also a member of the film's cast.\n\n\"In the spirit of films like Living in Oblivion, Waiting for Guffman, and This is Spinal Tap, The Acting Class is a vivid comedy feature about an exceptionally dysfunctional acting class,\" according to a description of the film on the festival's Web site.\n\nHolder, who has directed a documentary titled The Smith College Class of 196625 Years Later, says \"Jill and I play Smith College students in the film [The Acting Class], so there are some good Smith references and jokes that will be appreciated in Northampton.\" Holder has also worked on numerous feature films, including John Waters' Hairspray.\n\nThe Northampton Film Festival showcases innovative, independent films and videos -- shorts, feature films, narratives, documentaries, animated and experimental works -- by American filmmakers. Screenings on November 4 and 5 will take place in Smith's Stoddard and Wright auditoriums, as well as at the Academy of Music and the Northampton Center for the Arts. Related events will take place in museums, performance spaces, restaurants and cafés in Northampton. For more information on The Acting Class and the film festival, consult www.nohofilm.org.\n\nTips For Your Retirement\n\nThe Department of Human Resources will host renowned retirement consultant, bestselling author and speaker Ellen Hoffman on Friday, October 27, for two Training and Development workshops which will offer advice on how to best save for retirement.\n\n\"Retirement 101: Bankroll Your Future -- How to Get the Most from the Government for Your Retirement Years\" will take place from 12:30 to 2 p.m. The session, while focusing on Medicare, Social Security, taxation of retirement savings, and how to save while paying for elder and child care as well as education, will provide the latest information on deciphering government regulations and how legislative developments might affect retirement planning.\n\n\"Nine Strategies for Catching Up on Your Retirement Savings\" will take place from 2:30 to 4 p.m. It will use entertaining vignettes to provide practical suggestions for increasing savings, regardless of present circumstances.\n\nBoth sessions will be held in Neilson Browsing Room.

Woolf's piece, titled Reluctance, which takes as its lyric the poem of the same title by Robert Frost, was composed for the Syrinx Ensemble, a local group of classical musicians, which promotes the music of Latin American and New England composers. The piece was dedicated to the ensemble's founding members Catalina Arrubla, a Smith alumna, and Camilo Rojas.\n\nWoolf's Reluctance derives its musical strains from the shape and context of Frost's moving poetry, she says, which she interprets to address humans' difficulty in confronting change in life and the omnipresent conflict between following the heart and adhering to the mind. The last stanza sums up her inspiration for composing the piece: \"Ah, when to the heart of man/Was it ever less than a treason/To go with the drift of things,/To yield with a grace to reason/And bow and accept the end/Of a love or a season.\"\n\nAlso on the program will be Duet for Oboe and Viola, a composition by Alvin Etler, a former professor of music at Smith. Others works included on the program will be by Argentinian composer Eduardo Ginastera, Colombian composer Pedro Eli Gutierrez, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Johann Sebastian Bach and W. A. Mozart.\n\nWhenever possible, the Syrinx Ensemble includes composers of some of the pieces it performs in its concerts, says oboist Arrubla, who will help perform Woolf's Reluctance. The composers will often address the audience about their pieces and the process of their creation, as Woolf will do in the upcoming concert.\n\nWoolf, who has won several awards for past compositions, has a long association with the Syrinx Ensemble, says Arrubla, and the group has premiered her past compositions as well. Reluctance is scored for oboe, bassoon and soprano.\n\nScoreBoard\n\nSoccer\n\nOctober 17: Smith 1, Springfield 2 (OT)\n\nOctober 19: Smith 5, Beloit 0\n\nOctober 21: Smith 3, US Coast Guard 1\n\nVolleyball\n\nOctober 17: Smith 3, WPI 0\n\nOctober 20-21: Hall of Fame Invitational:\n\nSmith 0, U.

ACE-DHH is a national organization for faculty in 72 teacher preparation programs that train teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing across the United States. As coordinator, Marvelli will be responsible for developing an extended network of colleagues throughout the Northeast to share instructional interests, to provide support for the infusion of technology into their classroom teaching and assignments, and to help them acquire additional technological expertise through regional faculty development forums and virtual interactions. Marvelli, a former member of the Clarke School for the Deaf faculty, will serve as the grant's regional coordinator for three years.\n\nAn editorial titled \"The Picker Engineering Program at Smith College: Building a New Educational Paradigm and Bridging the Gender Gap,\" written by Malgorzata Pfabé, Sophia Smith Professor of Physics, and Nalini Easwar, associate professor of physics, for the American Journal of Physics, was requested by the University of Memphis English department to be included in the book Genres in Writing: Research and Synthesis Across the Disciplines, to be published next year. The book will be used in college-level composition courses.\n\nFormer Trustee John T. Connor died in Boston on Saturday, October 7. Connor, who was 85, served as commerce secretary under Lyndon B. Johnson. He was a member of the Smith College Board of Trustees from 1978 to 1983.\n\nSources of further information, if any, are indicated in parentheses.
