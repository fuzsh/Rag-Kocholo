        "text": "Post by domenicaflor on\n\nI am not a super fan of CJ, but I have been watching the new eps since it is now on after LOCI on Sundays. I started this thread in case anyone else wanted to comment on it.\n\nJill Hennessy is a decent actress, but the character of Jordan can be so annoying sometimes. I'm glad they toned down some of her family drama; it was getting altogether too much.\n\nI used to enjoy Lily, but it seems they toned her way down now that she no longer dates Garrett? Oh well. Maybe she will have a stronger role this new season.\n\nBug and Nigel are always fun to watch.\n\nTruth be told, I think Miguel Ferrer is kinda cute, so I have ulterior motives for watching Garrett Macy besides the forensics. ;D\n\nI find it a good show when nothing else interesting is on.\n\nAnyone else?\n\nD.\n\nPost by NikkiGreen on\n\nI've watched CJ from the beginning. The supporting cast has always been great. I wish they'd bring back some of the old time Nigel and Bug \"stuff\" though.\n\nMiguel Ferrer was great in both last night's episode and the one shown on Friday.\n\nI know NBC stated that they didn't want to confuse new viewers by continuing on with the cliffhanger from last season, but I hope they don't make us wait too long to resolve Jordan's family story. There's also the continuity issue. Garrett was no longer with the annoying DA by the season's end.\n\nFrom \" Dead or Alive\"\n\nDet. Cruz: \"I grow on people.\"\n\nJordan: \"So does fungus.\" ;D\n\nPost by Metella on\n\nFerrer has a \"weekend stand\" kinda appeal to me. His voice is pretty manly too.\n\nNigel is like my alter ego, eh? I would like to be a Nigel if I were male & had computer skills. Too bad I don't have any lab co-workers like Nig; the one guy who THINKS he has computer skills crashed the hard drive of the fluometer & cost a grad student a year's worth of data on her PHD. not a happy day for either of them. Back ups!!!! Back up the DATA baby.\n\nanyway, for some reason, although I am totally not on board Jodan's ridiculous family turmoil, I do like the show enough to watch it if my butt is on the couch when it is on; I think I may have seen over half of them.\n\nPost by trisha on\n\nSo I guess I'm the only one who can't stand this show, hu?\n\nI call it \"Crossing Absurdity\" because why in the hell would an ME be out solving crimes? It's even more ridiculous than CSI's solving crimes. Also, that whole storyline about Jordan's family falls over the cliff of massive melodrama. I don't like melodrama- the soap gets in my eyes.\n\nWhat was it Briscoe said about CSI's? \"The problem with CSI's is they all think they're detectives.\"\n\nI would just love to hear what he would say if he met Jordan.\n\nPost by janetcatbird on\n\nI dunno, I've saw a few episodes when it first came on and though I didn't dis-like it, I don't make a point to watch. I was kind of interested to see another side of Jill Henessy.\n\nThe other day I saw her give an interview on the \"Today Show\", just talking about coming back after a new baby. Apparently she brings Marco (her little boy) on the set and leaves him behind the cameras, and he is just spoiled rotten by the cast and crew. Wonder what Kathryn Erbe's doing with Carson? I'll be cast babysitter!!\n\nPost by jaquetta on\n\nI watched CJ when it first aired. Jill Hennessey seems to be acting Jordan so much more than Claire Kincaid, but I've read that JC is much more her personality than CK. Caught the tail end of the season last year and have watched it intermittantly this year - talk about continuity issues - although now I'm getting hooked on it on the A&E reruns.\n\nCrossing Absurdity is right. But it's entertaining.\n\nPost by NikkiGreen on\n\nFrom the False-Heart Judges thread:\n\nObserver2 said:\n\nI’ve seen the Mothership’s version of the sniper killings, and also – only because I’ll watch almost anything with Henry Winkler in it – I happened to catch Crossing Jordan’s version (any CJ fans out there? Is their boss really leaving? Is Winkler going to be a regular?).\n\nI'm a CJ fan, Observer. You caught a good episode.\n\nI loved Henry Winkler in that; he sure lit a few fires! I'm sure he'll be there at the beginning of next season, but, I don't think he'll become a regular. Garrett is getting his job back. It may take more than just the season opener though.\n\nwww.msnbc.msn.com/id/7713140/\n\nPost by Observer2 on\n\nThanks, Nikki. I don’t think I’ll ever be a fan, but I did like this episode better than the few others I’ve watched – intensely emotional without drowning in soap. I thought the resolution to the storyline involving the boss was well done, and found myself hoping they would find a way to bring him back. Whether they can do it without breaking internal reality, considering how they’ve established Winkler’s character, is another story... But if I remember, I’ll watch at least the season opener, just to see if they’re keeping it within character.\n\nPost by NicoleMarie on\n\nHellooooo! A Crossing Jordan thread!\n\nI'm a big fan of this show too. It's funny to see the mixed opinions and to see people like the same things I do and don't. LOL!!\n\nI'm with Trisha, I hate the sometimes melodramatics of the show. I usually just tape of those shows and never rewatch them. hehe! I'm with Dom too, Miguel is kinda cute! He's s actually my favorite character. As for the finale, I taped it and need to find it! hehe! I'm not with Observer though, I don't like Henry Winkler. I love Macy and would not be happy if he left or was pushed aside for Winkler's character.\n\nI used to dislike Lilly in the first few seasons. I like her more this season. She's not as whiny or butting in people's business. I loved her when Bug and Sidney got into it. Was hilarious. And yes, she and Garret quit dating.\n\nI love Nigel! I love his accent. Sometimes I want to slap Bug because he's so selfish. He is my least favorite of the bunch.\n\nThey've put the \"Who killed Jordan's mother\" on the back burner. I hope it stays there or gets resolved quickly.\n\nMy quote CJ quote (I forgot which show but it's in season 1):\n\nMax (Holding up a rolling pin, thinking he hears a burglar at the back door, then sees it's Jordan): Jordan!!! You scared the hell out of me!!\n\nJordan: What were you gonna do, BAKE ME?!\n\nLMAO!!!\n\nPost by NikkiGreen on\n\nArija Bareikis...five episodes in Season 3.\n\nI think the who killed Jordan's mother storyline is pretty much over. We know, she knows. The only thing really left is if James is still alive or did he die?\n\nI think that Bug & Nigel are great together.\n\nThere's only been a few times where I'd have liked to smack Lily, but generally I've always liked her."
