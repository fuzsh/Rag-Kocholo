        "text": "I was sorry to hear that actor Miguel Ferrer passed away on January 19th at the much too young age of 61.\n\nBorn on February 7, 1955, Miguel Ferrer was the son of actor / director Jose Ferrer and singer Rosemary Clooney. Ferrer’s original aspiration was to work as a musician, but in 1975 his friend Bill Mumy offered him a part in an episode of the TV series Sunshine. Ferrer caught the acting bug, and remained in the profession for the rest of his life.\n\nOne of Ferrer’s early roles was a 1981 episode of Magnum P.I. Ferrer played, in a flashback, a young Navy ensign stationed in Hawaii shortly before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, with his father Jose Ferrer then playing the same character in the present day. I always thought that was such a wonderful casting decision.\n\nThe role that really put Ferrer on the map was playing sleazy corporate executive Bob Morton in the dystopian sci-fi movie Robocop (1987). In interviews, Ferrer always acknowledged that he was grateful to that movie for really getting him noticed, enabling him to subsequently have a successful career as an actor.\n\nFerrer was often cast as villainous or quirky characters. He was seldom seen in starring roles, but he worked regularly, a ubiquitous presence in both movies and television for three decades. Notably, in the early 1990s Ferrer portrayed cynical FBI agent Albert Rosenfeld in David Lynch’s cult classic TV series Twin Peaks, and he also appeared in the 1994 TV miniseries adapting the Stephen King novel The Stand.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 Ferrer appeared on Crossing Jordan, playing Dr. Garret Macy, the mentor and boss to loose cannon Medical Examiner Jordan Cavanaugh, portrayed by Jill Hennessey. Crossing Jordan was a series that I watched regularly, and I loved the chemistry between Ferrer and Hennessy. Macy was something of a brooding, low-key figure who had the unenviable task of reigning in and covering for the headstrong, anti-authoritarian Jordan. Macy, a divorcee and recovering alcoholic with a teenage daughter, had a lot of baggage, and Ferrer brought the character to life in a very affecting performance.\n\nInterviewed in 2009 by the A.V. Club, Ferrer had positive memories of working on Crossing Jordan:\n\n“It was great. I loved that. Six years on the same show, working on the same lot. Got to go home and see my kids every night. They weren’t always awake, but I saw them. I loved that there were no out-of-control egos on the set. I loved working with the same people for six years. You develop a sure hand, and you learn how one works and likes to work. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. We had a ball.”\n\nFerrer, along with longtime friend Bill Mumy, was a science fiction and superhero fan. The two of them collaborated on a few comic book projects in the late 1980s. They co-wrote the six issue miniseries Comet Man, published by Marvel Comics in 1987. A dark, bizarre blending of superheroes, sci-fi, and horror, Comet Man was eerily illustrated by future superstar Batman artist Kelley Jones, inked by Gerry Talaoc, and featured striking covers by Bill Sienkiewicz. Ferrer, Mumy and Jones re-teamed in 1990 to wrap up the Comet Man storyline in a four part serial that ran in Marvel Comics Presents. A decade later writer Peter David, who was friends with Ferrer and Mumy, used Comet Man during his acclaimed run on Captain Marvel.\n\nPaired with talented artist Steve Leialoha, Ferrer and Mumy created the very odd superhero parody Trypto the Acid Dog, which debuted in a 1988 comic published by Renegade Press. Additional Trypto stories by Ferrer, Mumy & Leialoha came out in the 1990s via Atomeka Press and Dark Horse. Recently commenting on their collaboration, Leialoha revealed that the visual for Trypto was based on Ferrer’s own dog Davey.\n\nGiven how wonderfully bizarre Ferrer’s comic book work was, I’ve always thought it was a bit of a shame that he didn’t write more. Of course, this was around the time his acting career was really taking off, so I certainly understand why he chose to focus on that.\n\nSome of Ferrer’s roles were actually comic book related. He played Vice President Rodriguez in Iron Man 3 (2013). Miguel did a great deal of voiceover work, much of it for animated series based on comic books. Among the shows he voice-acted on were Superman: The Animated Series, The Batman, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Young Justice, the latter of which had him in the recurring role of immortal conqueror Vandal Savage. One of Ferrer’s last roles was voicing Deathstroke in the direct-to-DVD animated adaptation of Teen Titans: The Judas Contract.\n\nIn addition to being a talented actor and writer, Ferrer had a reputation for being a genuinely nice guy. In interviews he always came across as down-to-earth and laid back. In recent days Bill Mumy, Kelly Jones, Steve Leialoha and Peter David have all reflected on his passing; each of them described him as a good friend possessed of a wonderful sense of humor. It sounds like Ferrer will be very much missed by those who were fortunate enough to know him.\n\nAs the release of The Force Awakens approaches, I’ve been reviewing various entries in the vast Star Wars Expanded Universe. Today I’m looking at a recent piece of Star Wars lore, the first season of the animated TV series Rebels, originally broadcast between October 2014 and March 2015. I picked up the season one DVD last month.\n\nSet a decade and a half after the events of the prequels, Rebels chronicles the exploits of a small cell of the Rebel Alliance operating out of a freighter starship known as the Ghost in the vicinity of the planet Lothal:\n\nEzra Bridges – The fifteen year old is the figure through whom the audience is introduced to the crew of the Ghost. Ezra’s parents conducted underground anti-Imperial broadcasts on Lothal. They were arrested when Ezra was only eight years old. Spending the next several years as a homeless thief, Ezra comes to the attention of the Ghost crew when he makes off with a supply shipment which they themselves had only just stolen from the Empire. At first motivated solely by survival and self-interest, Ezra joins the Rebels after they risk their lives to rescue him from the Empire.\n\nKanan Jarrus – The leader of the Ghost crew is a former Jedi Padawan who survived the destruction of the Jedi Order during Order 66. Spending the next 15 years in hiding, he became a smuggler and guerilla fighter, keeping his Jedi abilities hidden. Kanan finally unsheathes his lightsaber in a battle to liberate Wookies who have been captured by Imperial slavers. After years of running from his past, Kanan reluctantly re-embraces his Jedi heritage when he realizes that Ezra is a Force sensitive, and he takes on the boy as his apprentice.\n\nHera Syndulla – The Twi’lek owner of the Ghost and an extremely skilled pilot, Hera is the den mother of the group. She has a close friendship with Kanan, and it’s implied that there is a mutual attraction between the two. The level-headed Hera serves as the link between the Rebel cell and the larger Alliance, communicating with a mysterious contact known only as “Fulcrum.”\n\nSabine Wren – A sarcastic teenage explosive expert and graffiti artist, Sabine is from the planet Mandalore. She was previously enrolled in the Imperial Academy, until an experience there completely embittered her towards the Empire. As a result she developed an aversion to blindly following orders. Ezra has a crush on Sabine, but she has declined to acknowledge it, preferring to remain friends.\n\nGarazeb “Zeb” Orrelios – The large, hairy Zeb is one of the last of the Lasat, an alien race who were brutally invaded by the Empire. Seeking to avenge his people, Zeb became involved in the Rebellion. Something of a grumpy hothead, Zeb is less than enthusiastic about Ezra joining the crew, although they eventually develop a grudging mutual respect.\n\nChopper – A beat-up old astromech droid, C1-10P aka Chopper helps keep the Ghost running. Possessing an irritable, mischievous personality, the droid expresses himself through grunts and beeps.\n\nOver the course of the first season, the writers do a good job introducing the main characters, spotlighting each of them throughout the 15 episodes. By the time I was finished watching the DVD set, I really did not have a favorite, having grown to like all of them.\n\nProbably the best character development was in the deep friendship that grows between Ezra and Kanan. They become not just student and teacher, but also a surrogate family, with Kanan becoming a father figure and role model for the reckless orphan. Teaching Ezra to use the Force and become a Jedi is just as much a learning experience for the teenager as it is for Kanan. Both of them need to discover patience and understanding. It is a different relationship than that of Luke and Yoda, as can be seen by this amusing exchange from “Rise of the Old Masters”…\n\nKanan: Enough jokes. Focus!\n\nEzra: I’m trying!\n\nKanan: Do, or no not. There is no try.\n\nEzra: What does that even mean? How can I do something if I don’t try to do it?\n\nKanan: Well, see… Actually, that one always confused me, too. But Master Yoda sure used to say it a lot.\n\nThat was one of my favorite bits from the first season!\n\nRebels appears to be geared to a slightly younger audience than the Star Wars movies. There is more of an emphasis on comedy and slapstick, although at times it can also be pretty intense and serious.\n\nSome of the humor derives from the fact that the Empire comes across as pretty damn incompetent. Yes, there’s that old joke that Imperial Stormtroopers cannot shoot straight. But if you actually watch the movies, most of the time they are incredibly dangerous adversaries who mow down their enemies left and right. It’s only when they encounter major characters such as Han, Luke or Leia that they are utterly incapable of hitting the broad side of a Jawa sandcrawler. And such is the case with Rebels, where the Ghost crew constantly runs circles around the Empire. You almost get the impression that it’s only sheer force of numbers that’s allowing the Emperor to maintain control of the galaxy!\n\nThere are exceptions, such as Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau, who is dangerously competent, but who is constantly frustrated by the bumbling antics of his troops. Likewise the utterly ruthless Grand Moff Tarkin arrives on Lothal late in the season to take charge of operations, and he seems to spend half the time uttering exclamations of exasperation at the people serving under him.\n\nThe closest thing to a “big bad” for season one is the Imperial Inquisitor, a Force-adept disciple of Darth Vader who utilizes a double bladed lightsaber capable of whirling like a propeller. The arrogant, mocking Inquisitor spends much of the season in pursuit of Kanan and Ezra. The design and personality of the Inquisitor is somewhere between Vader and his Sith predecessor Darth Maul. He is definitely a formidable adversary.\n\nSeveral actors from the movies reprise their roles. As always, Anthony Daniels is on hand to voice C-3PO. James Earl Jones returns for his iconic vocalization of Darth Vader, as do Frank Oz as Yoda and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Callrissian.\n\nLando appears in the episode “Idiot’s Array.” Zeb loses Chopper to Lando in a game of Sabacc, much to the droid’s indignation. To get Chopper back, the Ghost crew agrees to help Lando smuggle cargo through the Imperial blockade of Lothal. And, no, the cargo is not a case of Colt 45 (which was my first guess) but so-called “mining equipment,” namely a very odd animal that is a cross between a pig and a puffer fish. This is a few years before Lando became the semi-respectable administrator of Cloud City, back when he was still a smooth-talking gambler and con artist. Williams does a good job recreating the part.\n\n“Idiot’s Array” is one of the most offbeat and comedic installments of the entire season. Actually, it’s a great episode, genuinely funny and entertaining. And it actually works out well, coming right before the final four episode arc of the season, a very intense and serious storyline.\n\nSeason one draws to a dramatic conclusion with “Fire Across the Galaxy.” The crew infiltrates Tarkin’s star destroyer to rescue Kanan. This leads to a final, riveting showdown between Kanan and the Inquisitor.\n\n“Fire Across the Galaxy” also reveals the identity of Fulcrum; she is none other than Ahsoka Tano, former Jedi and fan favorite from The Clone Wars animated series. It was a pleasant surprise to learn that Ahsoka survived the Jedi Purge and was working alongside Senator Bail Organa to organize the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAs “Fire Across the Galaxy” came to a close, I found myself very much looking forward to season two. The first year had done a great job at developing the main characters, and I am interested in seeing Ahsoka becoming a regular. Also, with the arrival of Darth Vader on Lothal in the final scene, the possibility of Ahsoka encountering her former master and learning of his turn to the Dark Side appears to be in the cards.\n\nBy the way, in watching Rebels season one, I came to realize just how crucial the visual designs of Ralph McQuarrie, the music of John Williams and the sound designs of Ben Burtt all are in recapturing the feel, the atmosphere of the Star Wars universe in an animated series. All of these have been utilized by the makers of Rebels, and it just would not be the same in the absence of any of them.\n\nI cancelled cable TV service a while back, but I can always get Rebels season two through iTunes. It’s definitely something I’d rather not have to wait for the DVD release. It’s an entertaining, well-written series that does a great job of exploring the period between the prequels and the original trilogy.\n\nEnglish actor Olaf Pooley, who was born on March 13, 1914, passed away on July 14th at the grand old age of 101. Pooley’s best-known role was undoubtedly his 1970 appearance in the Doctor Who serial “Inferno” which starred Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor. At the time of his death Pooley was the oldest still-living actor to have appeared on Doctor Who.\n\nIn the seven-episode “Inferno” Pooley portrayed the monomaniacal Professor Stahlman, a scientist obsessed with drilling through the Earth’s crust in his quest to locate a new source of energy. As the story unfolds, Stahlman’s project instead unearths a green mutagenic slime that regressed humans into savage animals, and the drilling threatens to wipe out all life on the planet.\n\nDoctor Who: The Book of Lists succinctly describes Stahlman as “arrogant, confrontational and pretty single-minded even before he gets turned into a hairy monster.” Indeed, Pooley played the Professor as a thoroughly-unpleasant individual, a villain viewers absolutely love to hate. Pooley was so convincing in this performance that whenever I saw him in other roles or being interviewed I was always a bit taken aback at how affable he actually was!\n\nIt has been reported that Pooley was less-than-enamored with his heavy make-up in the later episodes of “Inferno.” One would think that most guest actors working on Doctor Who would be going in knowing that there was an above-average chance that they would end up playing some sort of grotesque monster. Having said that, I don’t blame Pooley for being apprehensive about being made up to look like something across between an ape and a werewolf!\n\nWith its journey sideways into a parallel universe where Britain is a fascist police state and its ominous end-of-the-world scenario, “Inferno” is a favorite among Doctor Who fans including myself. It’s been included on several Top Ten and Top Twenty Stories lists over the years.\n\nOf course, Doctor Who was but one entry on Pooley’s resume. In a lengthy career that spanned from the 1940s to the beginning of the 21st Century, he worked in theater, television and movies on both sides of the Atlantic. In an interview conducted just last month Pooley related working alongside such noted actors as Michael Gough, Noel Coward and a young Anthony Hopkins. He also wrote several plays and screenplays.\n\nMoving to the United States in the 1980s, Pooley made a number of appearances on American television. Notably, he was a scientist in the 1985 pilot episode of MacGuyver, and he made guest appearances on popular series Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law and Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman.\n\nAt the age of 86, one of Pooley’s last roles before retirement was in the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Blink of an Eye” which aired in January 2000. This made him one of only a handful of actors to have appeared in both Doctor Who and the Star Trek franchise.\n\nPooley had a lifelong love of art. He studied at the Architectural Academy in Bedford Square. It was after being convinced that it would be difficult making a living as an artist that Pooley went into acting. Yes, his second choice for a career was one that had only slightly better prospects for financial security! Pooley really must have been a creative person with a passion for expressing himself to have gone that route. Fortunately this worked out quite well for him.\n\nIn his last years Pooley was still involved in the art world. Having retired from acting and living in Los Angeles, he once again immersed himself in painting, spending the final decade and a half of his life creating many pieces in his Santa Monica studio.\n\nOn March 13, 2014, his one hundredth birthday, he was briefly interviewed by ABC 7 Los Angeles about both his work as an artist and his acting…\n\nI find it amazing and wonderful that Pooley was active right until the end of his life. Imagine retiring from a job that you enjoyed and then spending your remaining years actively engaged in a hobby that is a deep passion for you. On top of that, to live to be over a century old and still be in fairly good health & retain your mental faculties? We should all be so lucky!\n\nActress Christine Cavanaugh passed away on December 22, 2014 at the much too young age of 51. Cavanaugh’s career as an actress spanned from 1988 to 2001. She appeared in a handful of live television shows & movies during this time. The majority of her work, however, was as a voice actress. In this capacity, Cavanaugh gave a number of wonderful performances over the years, portraying several famous characters.\n\nHer most prominent performance was probably in the 1995 movie Babe. She voiced the title character, the sweet and innocent Australian piglet Babe who becomes a sheep-herder.\n\nCavanaugh worked on a number of animated series throughout the 1990s, among the Darkwing Duck, Sonic the Hedgehog, The Powerpuff Girls and The Wild Thornberries. Her two most significant roles were on Rugrats and Dexter’s Laboratory.\n\nI always found Rugrats to be a bizarre but funny show. It is one of those series that was very much for all ages. Young kids enjoyed it for the cute & goofy humor, while adults appreciated it for the comically skewed perceptions of the world as seen through the toddler characters’ eyes.\n\nCavanaugh was the voice of Chuckie Finster, the nervous orange-haired two-year-old with glasses. Her delivery of Chuckie’s dialogue was both poignant and humorous. Chuckie always reminded me a bit of myself, so he was something of a favorite character. Cavanaugh portrayed Chuckie on the Rugrats television series from 1991 to 2001, as well as in the two animated films The Rugrats Movie (1998) and Rugrats in Paris (2000), the latter of which featured a central role for the character.\n\nThe other animated voice role for which Cavanaugh was known was Dexter, the main character from Genndy Tartakovsky’s series Dexter’s Laboratory. Cavanaugh voiced the diminutive boy genius from 1995 to 2001, bringing to life the character with an iconic performance. She gifted Dexter with humorous self-involvement, as well as an almost tangible frustration at having to co-exist with his annoying older sister Dee Dee, who kept invading his secret lab, mucking about with his ambitious experiments. I’ve always enjoyed Dexter’s Laboratory. It was another offbeat but humorous series that appealed to viewers of all ages.\n\nCauvanaugh’s vocals as Dexter were also featured on the 1998 soundtrack album Dexter’s Laboratory: The Musical Time Machine which compiled several songs from the series. Among these was “Breathe in the Good Sunshine” from the episode “Just an Old-Fashioned Lab Song,” with Cavanaugh performing alongside singer-songwriter Paul Williams.\n\nCavanaugh retired from acting in 2001. She moved back to her native Utah in order to spend more time with her family.\n\nUntil I read about Cavanaugh passing away late last month, I had not actually realized who she was, and the same actress had voiced Babe, Chuckie and Dexter. Voice acting is often low-profile work, and is really not appreciated anywhere near as much as acting in front of the camera. But it definitely requires real talent. Bereft of the use of facial expressions and body language, the actor must rely solely on their voice to bring a character to life, to convey emotion, to deliver performances that must be humorous and dramatic, broad and subtle.\n\nChristine Cavanaugh was certainly capable of all that. She brought to life a trio of iconic fictional characters with her wonderful abilities, delighting millions of fans, young and old.\n\nI sometimes feel rather ambivalent about the Batman television series that ran from 1966 to 1968. Along with the Super Friends cartoons, when I was a kid it provided my first exposure to many of the characters in the DC Comics universe. I enjoyed watching reruns of the show when I was growing up in the early 1980s.\n\nA decade later, when I was a teenager, I had a rather different view of show. By that time, I was reading the actual Batman comic books, along with many other titles. And it drove me nuts that people would often assume that I was immature for reading comics, that they were nothing but silly, campy stories meant for kids… i.e. exactly like the old TV show starring Adam West and Burt Ward.\n\nAlong with many other comic book readers, I would protest that comic books could be serious and adult. I’d wave around my copies of Batman: Year One and Watchmen to demonstrate that comics were intelligent and deep, not at all like that old TV show. This persisted for years.\n\nAnd then one day I looked around and realized that everything had turned 180 degrees on me: comic books were too damn serious! Everyone was trying to mimic Frank Miller and Alan Moore, churning out grim & gritty nonsense, reiterating for the zillionth time the now utterly trite question “What if super-heroes existed in the real world?” At that point I threw up my hands in frustration and actually started asking “Why can’t comic books be fun again?!?”\n\nIt seems that I’m not the only one to have realized that the pendulum had swung much too far in the opposite direction, taking us from campy to clinically depressing. I think this is a significant factor in explaining the huge success of the Batman ’66 comic book. Written by Jeff Parker, with interiors by a number of artists and covers by Mike Allred, Batman ’66 is set in the television series continuity. This brings us to Batman ’66: The Lost Episode, plotted by Harlan Ellison, scripted by Len Wein, penciled by Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez, and inked by Joe Prado, with a cover by Alex Ross.\n\nBack in the mid-1960s when the first season of the Batman television show was in pre-production, prolific science fiction author Harlan Ellison was invited to write an episode. He submitted a synopsis entitled “The Two-Way Crimes of Two-Face,” which would have brought the duality-obsessed Harvey Dent into the TV show. For one reason or another, the episode was never made. The synopsis then spent the next several decades in Ellison’s files. Finally Ellison dug it out, dusted it off, and included it in Brain Movies: The Original Teleplays of Harlan Ellison Volume 5, published in 2013. Then, as recounted by Len Wein, Ellison got in touch with DC Comics to suggest the use of his synopsis for the Batman ’66 book. That got the ball rolling, eventually leading to The Lost Episode special.\n\nLen Wein is probably best known for co-creating Wolverine and Swamp Thing, but he has many credits to his name, including a number of Batman stories that were published in the 1970s and 80s. He’s also a longtime friend of Ellison, which made him the ideal choice to adapt the synopsis into a full-length comic book script.\n\nIt is interesting to compare Wein’s script to the original treatment by Ellison, which is included in The Lost Episode. Ellison obviously conceived the major points of the plot, which Wein fleshed out. Wein also added certain details. Ellison’s synopsis has Two-Face working alone. In keeping with the character’s double motif, Wein gave Two-Face a pair of henchmen named Deuce and Twain. Not only does it suit the character, but it also fits with the TV series. As I recall, every single bad guy on the show had at least a few henchmen on hand to do the heavy lifting and run interference when Batman and Robin inevitably crashed their criminal capers.\n\nI do think there was at least one point that worked better in Ellison’s original outline. But on the whole Wein does a very good job translating Ellison’s synopsis into a 30 page comic book script.\n\nWein did a superb job of capturing the tone of the television show’s scripts. Reading “The Two-Way Crimes of Two-Face,” I really could “hear” in my head Adam West and Burt Ward speaking Batman and Robin’s dialogue. Wein also utilized television producer William Dozier’s omniscient voiceover narration, including the obligatory mention of “stately Wayne Manor.” And there was a healthy heaping of animated alliteration from our compelling cast of characters.\n\nThe only thing that was missing was the cliffhanger! As I was reading, I kept expecting that any minute Two-Face and his goons would gain the upper hand on the Dynamic Duo, and that the next instant Batman and Robin would then find themselves about to meet a gristly end in the jaws of some overly-complicated deathtrap. That was always how the first episode ended! I’m guessing that Ellison must have composed his story synopsis before the two-episode structure with its requisite cliffhanger was established.\n\nPenciling “The Two-Way Crimes of Two-Face” is the legendary Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez. Now this was when my interest in this project was really piqued. As I’ve written before, I am a huge fan of Garcia-Lopez. He is an absolutely amazing artist. Regrettably it has been quite some time since he has worked on any significant projects for DC, focusing instead on licensing art and style guides. Most of the published work he’s done recently has been variant covers, and those editions were inevitably rare & expensive. I recently found out he contributed on a couple of issues of All-Star Western which flew under my radar, so I have to search them out. So the promise of a brand-new, full-length story penciled by Garcia-Lopez was definitely enticing.\n\nI am not especially familiar with Joe Prado, although I know he’s done quite a bit of work for DC over the last several years. He has a very modern, slick inking style. Prado utilizes quite a bit of hatching in his embellishment. This makes for a distinctive collaboration with Garcia-Lopez, whose style is definitely more traditional.\n\nPerhaps it was done to pad out the size of the book, but The Lost Episode also contains all 30 pages of Garcia-Lopez’s uninked pencils. While perhaps not an essential element, I certainly regard this as a unique opportunity. In my blog post Thinking About Inking: The Role of Comic Book Inkers, one of my major points was that it is often difficult for the casual reader to look at a published comic book and discern what the work of the penciler is and what that of the inker is. The Lost Episode provides us with the chance to view the pencils side-by-side with the inked artwork, enabling us to understand what Garcia-Lopez and Prado each contributed. It also allows us to see how much of a role the excellent coloring by Alex Sinclair played in establishing the tone and atmosphere of the story.\n\nGarcia-Lopez did illustrate a variant cover for The Lost Episode, although that edition was, inevitably, rarer and more expensive. At least his uninked pencils for that alternate cover are published inside.\n\nThe standard cover is painted by Alex Ross. I’ve observed in the past that, while Ross is an amazing artist, when it comes to rendering costumed characters sometimes his paintings are a bit too realistic. If the Batman television series demonstrated one thing, it is that in real life people can end up looking rather preposterous when dressed up in spandex outfits (the exception, of course, being Julie Newmar, who always looked purrfect as Catwoman). There are times when Ross has created paintings of superheroes that are so photorealistic that it just takes me out of my suspension of disbelief because I feel like I am looking at an actual person wearing a silly costume. I guess this relates to the whole idea of how a lot of the elements that look fantastic on the pages of comic books end up appearing silly when translated too literally into three-dimensional reality.\n\nHaving said all that, Ross is the ideal artist to be creating covers for Batman ’66. In this case, since this is a comic book based on a television series (which, yes, in turn was based on a comic book) photorealism is the name of the game. He definitely captures the likenesses and body language of Adam West and Burt Ward, something he has also done successfully on his recent covers for the Batman ’66 Meets the Green Hornet miniseries. Ross’ conception of Two-Face is both horrific and tragic, a portrait of brooding, melancholy madness that is obsessively fixated on the duality in life. He even frames the composition in an off-kilter angle, evoking the tilted “Dutch angle” camera shots the television show utilized for scenes set in the villains’ lairs. All told, his cover is extremely striking and dramatic.\n\nI do think the ten dollar cover price for Batman ’66: The Lost Episode was a little too high. Still, all in all, it was a very good book and I am glad I purchased it.\n\nIn hindsight, yeah, the Batman television series was pretty cool. I’m glad that all of the rights issues were finally worked out, enabling it to at last be released on DVD. And I’m also happy that we have the Batman ’66 comic book series. It definitely makes for a nice change of pace from the oppressively grim pall of the New 52 Bat-books.\n\nNow if only DC Comics would give Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez an ongoing book to illustrate. How about a miniseries at the very least? Come on, DC, just think about it!\n\nAfter hearing of the recent untimely death of British comedian Rik Mayall last month at the age of 56, Michele and I re-watched the television series that he was most associated with: The Young Ones. Originally running for two six-episode seasons in 1982 and 1984 on the BBC, The Young Ones became an influential cult classic. Michele likes to say that it is her all time favorite television series. She first saw it when it aired here in the States in 1985 on MTV. Myself, I caught a few of the episodes in the mid-1990s when it was on Comedy Central. While I enjoyed them somewhat back then, watching the series in its entirety on DVD definitely gave me a real appreciation for it.\n\nThe Young Ones was co-written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer, with additional material by Alexi Sayle. It featured the bizarre, nonsensical, and grotesquely over-the-top misadventures of four university students from Scumbag College who were rooming together in North London:\n\nRick (played by Rik Mayall) was a would-be anarchist revolutionary who would go on endlessly about the evils of Margaret Thatcher and the oppression of the people, while treating everyone else about him with disdain. He regarded himself as “the people’s poet,” the so-called “voice of a generation,” although in reality he was a self-important egotist who was full of crap.\n\nVyvyan (Adrian Edmondson) was a loud, psychotic, alcoholic punk metal-head who considered Rick “a complete bastard.” Despite being an ultra-violent imbecile, Vyvyan was studying medicine at Scumbag College. I suppose the blood & guts appealed to him.\n\nNeil (Nigel Planer) was a perpetually depressed hippy pacifist who had constant verbal & physical abuse heaped upon him, and who was always expected by the other three to cook dinner, even if they were too broke to buy groceries. Neil alternated between preaching the virtues of such causes as vegetarianism & environmentalism, and moping about bemoaning the fact that everyone hated him.\n\nMike (Christopher Ryan) was a suave con artist who was always scheming to make money. On several occasions referring to himself as “the cool person,” Mike believed he was a real ladies’ man, although on various instances he was spotted sleeping with an inflatable sex doll.\n\nRounding out the regular cast was Alexi Sayle, who portrayed a variety of characters, including the various members of the Balowski Family. Sayle’s performances were often a satire on British societal stereotypes, with him sending up the popular image of the working class, or merely rambling on in a stream of consciousness manner, via some cleverly nonsensical monologues.\n\nThere were appearances on The Young Ones by a number of talented actors and comedians. Some of them were already established at that time, and others were up-and-coming. Among the various guest stars to appear on the show were Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Robbie Coltrane, Stephen Frost, Terry Jones, Patrick Newell, Helen Lederer, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson.\n\nEach of the episodes featured a musical performance, which was always worked into the plot somehow or another, even it was just that week’s band just standing around the living room or out in the street while the action unfolded about them. Some of the musical guests were definitely on the obscure side, such as Amazulu and Rip Rig + Panic. Others were better known, as in Motorhead, The Damned, Dexy’s Midnight Runners and Madness (who appeared twice). There was one episode, “Flood,” that instead of music had a lion tamer performing in Mike’s room, and that incongruous appearance ended up being a key aspect to the resolution of the plot, such as it was.\n\nOf course, that was the thing about The Young Ones. The episodes did not have much in the way of straightforward plots, but were rather more like a series of jokes and gags that were somewhat loosely strung together. There were also a number of random asides tossed in that had little or nothing to do with the rest of the episode.\n\nThe humor ranged from sophisticated and intellectual to crass, vulgar, gross, tacky and utterly lowbrow. Copious amounts of cartoonish violence were regularly inflicted upon the characters. The Young Ones was the sort of anarchic mish-mash of comedic insanity that could have easily collapsed into an incomprehensible, unfunny heap. But the talent, energy, and enthusiasm of the performers and writers instead resulted in a set of a dozen episodes which were hysterical and laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nThe series often broke the fourth wall, with characters directly addressing the audience to deliver jokes or monologues. The most extended example of this was in the episode “Sick.” Halfway through the episode the quartet are alarmed to learn that Neil’s parents will be coming to visit, and they desperately start attempting to clean up the house, hoping to look at least somewhat more respectable. The audience’s expectation is that Neil’s middle class parents are going to be upset that he is living with a trio of disreputable individuals in a shithole of a building. Instead, we quickly find out that they are furious Neil is starring in such a shameful, trashy television show as The Young Ones, with his father critically commenting “It’s a waste of a licensing fee! Pardon my French, but why can’t you be in one of those decent situation comedies that your mother likes?”\n\nRe-watching The Young Ones, Michele began to suspect that it could have been a major influence on Seth McFarlane’s Family Guy. She has a good point there, and I would not be surprised to learn that she’s correct.\n\nOur favorite episode of The Young Ones is undoubtedly “Bambi.” I really enjoyed that one even back when I first saw it in the mid-90s. Seeing it again on DVD, it was hilarious. The housemates attempt to wash their laundry for the first time in over three years, leading to the anthropomorphic machine at the launderette to violently spit out the load, loudly proclaiming “No way!” Vyvyan then utters one of my favorite lines of dialogue from the series: “This calls for a very special blend of psychology and extreme violence.” Fooling a lecherous washing machine into thinking they have actress Felicity Kendall’s underwear, the four of them stuff their clothes into it, only to belatedly realize that they don’t have any money to put into it. Returning home, they vow to never wash their clothes again and become the dirtiest students in the whole world. When Mike comments “Hey, now there’s a challenge,” Neil suddenly remembers that the four of them have been selected to represent Scumbag College on the television game show University Challenge. Cue a mad dash to the railway station, with Motorhead providing incidental music. I won’t say any more about the episode. Trust me, if you haven’t seen the it, it’s well worth watching.\n\nIt might seem odd, at least to an American audience, that The Young Ones was so influential while only lasting a mere 12 episodes. But actually I think the British method of producing television, with shorter seasons, is a good one. I really think that too many American shows stretch their resources thin making 24 episodes a year. The end result is that you usually end up with several really good installments, a number of merely average ones, and at least a few stinkers. But if you have half that number, or less, the writers can really focus their energy on crafting several high-quality scripts, the various members of the production team can better allocate their time & resources into filming them, and the actors aren’t overworked. Looking at the run of The Young Ones, not a single one of the episodes is a dud.\n\nIt certainly is a shame that co-star and co-writer Rik Mayall died so young. Michelle posted a nice tribute to Mayall on her own blog. Looking at his work on The Young Ones, as well as other projects he was involved with over the years, it is apparent that he was extremely talented. Mayall had a genuine gift for comedy, delivering lines in just the right way, offering up the most insane facial expressions, and excelling in dynamically bizarre physical comedy. Yeah, I would go so far as to say that he was a genius.\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with The Young Ones, check it out. There are plenty of clips from the series posted on the internet, as well as the actors’ appearances in the 1980s reprising their roles elsewhere. For all twelve episodes, plus some informative extras, The Young Ones: Extra Stoopid Edition DVD set came out in 2007 and is still available.\n\nBritish actress Kate O’Mara passed away on March 30th at the age of 74. Because of her strikingly aristocratic good looks and air of cultivation, O’Mara was quite often cast as strong, ruthless, icy women. Her best known role is probably portraying Joan Collins’ sister on Dynasty in the mid-1980s. Now I’ve never really seen that series, outside of the odd episode,but from what little I know about it, with its hellaciously bitchy catfights, O’Mara was probably right at home on that show.\n\nIn the world of sci-fi, though, O’Mara is most famous for portraying the renegade Time Lord known as the Rani on Doctor Who. The creation of writers Pip & Jane Baker, unlike most of the Doctor’s foes, the Rani wasn’t out to conquer the world or anything like that; all she wanted was to be left in peace to conduct her scientific researches. The problem, though, was that the Rani was completely lacking in any kind of morality or empathy for other beings. She looked upon the universe as one vast laboratory, its inhabitants mere test subjects for her experiments. O’Mara played the part perfectly. She was a brilliant adversary for Colin Baker’s Sixth Doctor, with his crusading zeal against tyranny & injustice. “The Mark of the Rani,” broadcast in 1985, is one of the strongest stories from Baker’s all-too-short tenure as the Sixth Doctor on television.\n\nThe only real drawback to the serial is that Pip & Jane Baker were told to incorporate the Doctor’s arch-nemesis the Master into their script. The result is that O’Mara ends up spending more of her screen time engaged in petty squabbling with Anthony Ainley than she does dramatically sparring with Colin Baker.\n\nUnfortunately the Rani’s next appearance two years later was in “Time and the Rani,” which usually ranks pretty damn low on fan polls. It’s a hastily thrown together production that literally tosses Sylvester McCoy into the role of the Seventh Doctor, giving him no time to find his feet. To be honest, it’s one of those rare examples of Doctor Who that you would probably never want to show to any non-fans, because it would leave them wondering what the hell was wrong with you for liking the series. To O’Mara’s credit, she is one of the few positive aspects of “Time and the Rani,” even if she’s forced to spend part of it masquerading as Bonnie Langford… no, just don’t ask.\n\nO’Mara’s last televised appearance as the Rani was in 1993 in the infamous charity special “Dimensions in Time,” which was basically a case of cramming as many surviving Doctor Who actors as possible into the space of 15 minutes, filmed on a shoestring budget, while simultaneously tying in with popular British soap opera EastEnders. I’ve never actually seen “Dimensions in Time,” but its reputation precedes it.\n\nI think is really says something about O’Mara’s abilities as an actress that even though two of the Rani’s three televised appearances are quite awful, the character nevertheless left an indelible impression on the series’ fans. Certainly it’s a regrettable that the Rani was never brought back in a better-written story, either on television or in the Big Finish audios. She did have one opportunity to reprise the role, in the audio drama The Rani Reaps the Whirlwind, released in 2000 by BBV.\n\nOf course, Kate O’Mara’s career was certainly not limited to just Dynasty and Doctor Who. In 1970 she appeared in two of Hammer Studios’ horror films, The Horror of Frankenstein and The Vampire Lovers. In the later of those two, she famously fell under the erotic vampire seduction of Ingrid Pitt.\n\nO’Mara was an incredibly prolific actress on British television from the mid-1960s onwards. She made three separate appearances in the Roger Moore series The Saint. In the Jason King episode “A Kiss for a Beautiful Killer,” O’Mara memorably played a fiery Latin American revolutionary who is inevitably attracted to Peter Wyngarde’s secret agent turned bon vivant novelist. In the mid-1970s O’Mara was a regular on The Brothers, portraying air freight manager Jane Maxwell, who crossed swords with corporate raider Paul Merroney, played by a young Colin Baker himself.\n\nAmong O’Mara’s most recent television roles, her most prominent was on Jennifer Saunders & Joanna Lumley’s hit comedy Absolutely Fabulous. O’Mara portrayed Patsy Stone’s even more unpleasant sister Jackie. I always thought that was brilliant casting.\n\nIt seems that, like many actors & actresses who are often cast as villains, in real life O’Mara was seemingly a pleasant individual. In an interview last October, she commented…\n\n“I’m actually quite a nice person. It’s to do with the way I look, an uncompromising sort of face, brusque delivery and voice, and I think the combination of all that.”\n\nO’Mara also expressed an interest in returning to the role of the Rani…\n\n“I’m a much older woman and there’s a huge population of older people who, if they’re watching television, they can’t watch Hollyoaks. If you put a much older woman in Doctor Who, they can identify with it. I think it’s quite an interesting concept and if you remember things like Grimm’s Fairytales, the older woman is often the villainess, often the terrifying figure – why I do not know, but often she is. I think it’s an idea to be exploited.”\n\nIt is unfortunate O’Mara never had the opportunity to once again portray the iconic character she brought to life. However, she definitely leaves behind a legacy of dramatic, larger-than-life performances.\n\nThe second half of Criminal Minds season eight wrapped up a few weeks ago, and it was definitely one hell of a ride. The various subplots set up in early episodes all came to a head, beginning in the mid-season opener “Zugzwang.” Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) had, over a period of months, been developing a relationship over the phone with Maeve (Beth Riesgraf), a geneticist who was in seclusion due to her being menaced by a stalker. Just when it seemed that Maeve was in the clear, and she could finally meet Reid, the stalker finally surfaces in the persona of a very loony Michelle Trachtenberg. Maeve is kidnapped, and is soon the tragic victim of a murder/suicide, killed right in front of a horrified Reid. As a viewer, it was a real kick in the gut. The socially awkward BAU agent finally found his soul mate only to have her cruelly taken away like that. Maeve’s death would continue to haunt Reid for the remainder of the season.\n\nDerek Morgan (Shemar Moore) also went through the emotional wringer, as his past came back to haunt him. In the episode “Restoration,” the BAU is investigating a series of brutal beatings in Chicago, and they soon realize that the UnSub is a past victim of Carl Buford, a sexual predator who molested dozens of teenage boys, including a young Morgan. The BAU is forced to turn to the imprisoned Buford to get his help in narrowing down the suspect list, bringing Morgan face to face with his childhood tormentor. That’s the interesting thing about Morgan. On the surface, he appears to be this confident, happy, handsome guy who has it all. But underneath all that there is this painful past which has led him to join the FBI in order to aid other people who have been victimized.\n\nAnother member of the BAU with layers is Jennifer “JJ” Jareau (A.J. Cook), the BAU’s former communications liaison turned profiler. JJ often comes across as having a very laid-back, casual demeanor. But she is also a mother to a young son, Henry, a role equally important to her. In the previous season, we saw hell hath no fury like a mother scorned, as she engaged in a vicious hand to hand fight with Tricia Helfer’s serial killer bank robber in order to keep Henry safe. This season, another case hit home for JJ’s maternal instincts. In “Nanny Dearest,” we learn that the BAU has been attempting to solve a case for several years. Each year, a nanny and the child in her care are abducted by an UnSub. The child is typically returned unharmed within 24 hours, but inevitably the tortured & drowned body of the nanny is found disposed of in Los Angeles on the exact same day of the year. Hoping to prevent a new killing, the BAU fly out to LA, only to learn the latest abduction has occurred ahead of schedule, except this time the child has yet to be recovered. JJ is reminded of her son, who due to the work schedule of herself and her husband, is often left with a nanny. Following a number of leads, JJ and Morgan finally locate the UnSub, and a determined JJ kills the murderer in a tense shoot-out.\n\nBy far the biggest plotline of Season Eight was the emergence of the Replicator. In the first half of the season, the BAU was being stalked by a mysterious figure, an individual who then began committing copycat killings of various cases the team had recently solved. As the second half of the season progresses, the Replicator steps up his game, actively taunting the members of the BAU, as well as manipulating another individual into carrying out some of the killings.\n\nAs I mentioned in my write-up of the first half of the season, I was wondering if there might be some connection between the Replicator and A) the person stalking Maeve or B) the fumbled FBI investigation that nearly ended the career of Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) twelve years ago. Well, I was wrong about the first connection, although the Replicator did take advantage of Maeve’s abduction to offer his first taunt of “Zugzwang” to Reid. However, I was totally on target on the second point.\n\nAfter nearly a year of build-up, I was hoping that the reveal of the Replicator wouldn’t be a let-down. Criminal Minds definitely came up with pitch-perfect casting, as the BAU’s arch-foe is revealed to be portrayed by none other than Mark Hamill. And if you thought he was creepy as the voice of the Joker on Batman: the Animated Series, here as the Replicator he is downright scary.\n\nWho is the Replicator? He is FBI agent John Curtis, and a dozen years previously his career suffered a major setback as, along with Alex Blake, the blame for a botched investigation into a series of anthrax attacks was shifted onto him by Assistant Director Erin Strauss (Jayne Atkinson). Curtis blamed Strauss for delivering this near fatal blow to his career, he was jealous of Blake for rebuilding her position in the FBI when he was unable to do so, and he resented the BAU for offering Blake a place on their team, something he felt he deserved much more than her. All that set off his obsessive stalking of the BAU, and the replication of their cases, with the end goal of first humiliating and then killing them.\n\nThe character who Curtis directs much of his ire towards, Erin Strauss, is an interesting one. Early on, Strauss was an ambitious, ruthless figure who often maintained an adversarial attitude towards the BAU. As the series progressed, Strauss gradually mellowed, becoming more of an ally. When it became apparent that Strauss was suffering from alcoholism, the members of the BAU helped her to both enter recovery and to save her career. So the Strauss who the Replicator confronts is a very different woman from the person who threw Curtis and Blake to the wolves back in 2001.\n\nUnfortunately, the vengeful Curtis takes Strauss prisoner and forces her at gunpoint to drink, destroying her hard-won sobriety. Having taken her dignity, the Replicator then murders Strauss. Hardest hit by this is David Rossi (Joe Mantegna). Over the past year or so, there had been a number of hints that Rossi and Strauss had become involved, and it is confirmed here, as Rossi mourns and rages at the death of a woman he has come to care for.\n\nThe final episode of Season Eight really was riveting. As events hurtled towards the confrontation between the BAU and the Replicator, I was wondering if the finale would actually end in a cliffhanger. I also was seriously worried just how the BAU was going to outwit the Replicator, who all along was shown to be several steps of them. I was a bit worried that there’d be some sort of cop-out, that he would conveniently make some sort of silly mistake at the last minute. Fortunately that is not the case.\n\nThe Replicator very nearly does succeed in trapping most of the team in a room with a bomb rapidly counting down to zero. However, he does make two slight miscalculations. Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangness) manages to reboot her crashed computer network quicker than anticipated, enabling her to jam the countdown. Rossi, who was earlier poisoned by the Replicator, also recovers sooner than expected, and the delay caused by Garcia gives him time to get the rest of the BAU out of the locked room. A fleeing Curtis leads a pursuing Rossi back into the booby-trapped room, determined to take at least one of the BAU out with him. In an act of poetic justice, though, Rossi has used Strauss’ one year anniversary coin from Alcoholics Anonymous to wedge open the lock. Rossi makes his exit, leaving the Replicator to be blown up… probably. Because, y’know, we do not actually see a body.\n\nWith the Replicator presumed dead, the members of the BAU gather at Rossi’s house to hold an informal memorial service, remembering the fallen Strauss, who in the end they counted as a loyal friend and colleague.\n\nI thought the second half of season eight was quite good. Despite the fact that the Replicator storyline was a major feature of the season, it did not dominate events, and we did get plenty of stand-alone episodes. The mystery was resolved quite satisfactorily. And I’m actually glad that Jeanne Tripplehorn will be returning in season nine. At first, I wasn’t sure about Alex Blake, but in the end I warmed up to her character.\n\nThe last couple of months, Michele and I have been watching a lot of television. It seems like we’re paying a small fortune to Time Warner for cable, so we figure we might as well take advantage of that, instead of buying even more DVDs. Out of what we’ve been watching, a pretty good portion of the viewing material has been reruns on the cable channel Me TV, aka Memorable Entertainment Television.\n\nThis whole thing started in late December of last year. Actor Jack Klugman had just passed away, and there was a 24 hour marathon of The Odd Couple on some channel or another. For those who aren’t familiar with it, The Odd Couple is based on a play by Neil Simon. The premise of the series is that neat, fussy photographer Felix Unger, played by Tony Randall, is kicked out by his wife, who has finally gotten completely fed up of his anal retentive behaviors. He moves in with his old friend Oscar Madison, played by Klugman, a sloppy, grumpy newspaper sports writer who several years before was divorced by his own wife. The opening narration asks “Can two divorced men share an apartment without driving each other crazy?” And the answer to that is usually a resounding “NO!” Felix and Oscar are complete polar opposites, and the comedy of the show derives from how the two of them react in completely different ways when they get thrust into a variety of bizarre and oddball situations. Most of the time Oscar is convinced that nosy, neat freak Felix is ruining his life, and badly wants him out of the apartment. But underneath his grumpy exterior, Oscar is a decent guy, and inevitably he ends up letting Felix stay because he can’t bear to see his pal get cast out, no matter how much they aggrivate each other.\n\nAnyway, after watching a few hours of this marathon of The Odd Couple around the holidays, Michele, who used to watch it when she was growing up, became totally hooked on it again. She had me do a search on the DVR to see if any channels were repeating it. That’s how we found Me TV, which airs it every weekday night at 10:00 PM. So now it’s set to record every episode. And, yeah, after watching it for a week or so, I ended up becoming a fan, as well.\n\nWe soon discovered that there is a lot of other cool stuff on Me TV. There is Dick Van Dyke and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. I used to watch both of those in high school when they were rerun on Nick at Nite. There’s “Sunday Night Noir” with shows like The Fuguitive. I’ve also taped a couple of episodes of Irwin Allen’s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea on the DVR, but I haven’t had a chance to actually view them yet.\n\nFor fans of more spooky fare, there are Rod Serling’s two famous anthology series, The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery. Obviously I’ve seen endless reruns of The Twilight Zone in syndication. But Night Gallery pops up much less often on television, so even though it wasn’t nearly as good as its predecessor, I’m enjoying being able to see many of the shows for the first time. Serling was certainly a brilliant writer, and he did such an amazing job of seamlessly working social commentary into sci-fi and horror material.\n\nMichele and I were reflecting that some of the best material we’re currently watching on television originally aired decades ago. I’m not going to go so far as to say that everything that’s on the networks nowadays is crap. And certainly there was plenty of awful stuff on in the 1960s and 70s. But I really do have to wonder how many shows that are currently on the main channels will be considered classics thirty or forty years from now."
