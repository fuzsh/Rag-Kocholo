        "text": "Songs of survival and hope will be on the bill at The Wellmont Theater, 5 Seymour St., this Saturday night: WFUV presents Indigo Girls. Singer/songwriter/actress Jill Hennessy (\"Law & Order;\" \"Madam Secretary\") opens for them.\n\nIndigo Girls' Emily Saliers and Amy Ray talked to Brian Aberback for The Record this past summer about their new CD, \"One Lost Day,\" describing it as a \"musical travelogue.\"\n\n\"We have traveled so much and have had so many lessons learned in different places,\" Saliers said.\n\n\"One Lost Day,\" their 14th studio album and the first in four years, also includes songs about faith, racism and activism.\n\nThe Montclair Times spoke to Jill Hennessy when she came to town a few weeks ago to play with Light of Day North Jersey WinterFest at Outpost in the Burbs, a benefit concert for the Light of Day Foundation, which raises money for Parkinson's disease.\n\nHennessy said that she was a musician in Canada, where she grew up, before she became an actress, busking \"to pay rent, and hopefully go to acting classes. It was hard to afford more than a month at a different acting studio. I was playing 'The River' on the street, doing 'Thunder Road,' tons of Tracy Chapman, and Indigo Girls.\"\n\nWith music, she said, \"I get to tell my own story. It doesn't matter what I look like, or how I dress.\"\n\n- Gwen Orel"
