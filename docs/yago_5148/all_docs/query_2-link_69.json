The competition is split between three host countries with Costa Rica staging League A and Trinidad and Tobago and Aruba hosting League B and C, respectively.\n\nTuesday's win improved Canada's record at the U-15 tournament to 18-4-2.\n\nCanada lost 4-1 to the U.S. in the League A final at the last CONCACAF U-15 Championship in 2022 in Tampa, Fla. The Americans also won in 2016 and 2018.\n\nCanada won the tournament in 2014, beating Haiti on penalties in the final, and also finished runner-up in 2016. It failed to reach the semifinals in 2018.\n\nCanadians who have played in the U-15 tournament include Olympic champions Julia Grosso (2014), Jordyn Huitema (2014 and 2016) and Jayde Riviere (2016).\n\nThe current Canadian team is coached by Tina Cook.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 6, 2024.\n\nThe Canadian Press"
