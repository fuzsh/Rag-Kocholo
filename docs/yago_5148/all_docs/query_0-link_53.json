        "text": "Jill Hennessy performs in Whippany Sunday\n\nFor six seasons, Jill Hennessy starred in the TV series “Crossing Jordan,” in which she played Jordan Cavanaugh, medical examiner.\n\nOff-screen, Hennessy deserves a different M.E. title: music enthusiast.\n\nBefore she earned attention as an actress, Hennessy busked on corners along Yonge Street in Toronto. Even today, on the set of a show, she brings her guitar.\n\nShe speaks warmly of her respect for such musicians as Bob Dylan, Richard Thompson, Tom Waits, and particularly Bruce Springsteen.\n\n“Music was the first thing I did, and it’s closest to my heart,” says Hennessy. “Acting and music are both storytelling in the end.”\n\nHennessy’s musicals taste became apparent on the “Crossing Jordan” soundtrack CD in 2003. Working with veteran producers T. Bone Burnett and Craig Street, she delivered effective covers of songs by Dylan and Waits.\n\nHer own songwriting was showcased on her debut, “Ghost in My Head,” in 2009. She recently released “I Do,” her second CD of original material.\n\nHennessy will perform at the Ukrainian American Cultural Center in Whippany this Sunday, Feb. 28, as part of the Splatter Concert series.\n\nThe fact that she is singing at a Ukrainian center is appropriate. One new song, “Edmonton,” is about her maternal grandmother, who was born to Ukrainian immigrants.\n\n“My grandmother was a powerhouse force of nature,” says Hennessy. “She grew up in a Ukrainian camp outside of Edmonton, not speaking any English.” The family later moved to Edmonton, where they had to deal with intolerance and prejudice.\n\n“My memory of my grandmother was being warm but tough,” Hennessy says. “I’ve wanted to write a song about her, and about immigrants having the courage to face the unknown.”\n\nMany of the songs on “I Do,” like those on “Ghost in My Head,” are based on personal experience, according to Hennessy.\n\n“The new songs follow on the heels of the earlier ones,” she says. “Instead of writing about being a kid, I wrote about having kids. The songs reframe things.”\n\nThe songs on “I Do” also represent an effort to expand her sonic vocabulary. “I wanted to focus more on percussion,” Hennessy says. “On ‘Ghost in My Head,’ only about four songs had drums. This time, there are drums all over the place.”\n\nHennessy’s career as a musician began when she heard a trio of street musicians harmonizing to Eagles songs. “I jumped in and joined them,” she says. Money from busking and waitressing sustained her as she sought acting jobs.\n\nThe inspiration to write songs herself came from many sources, but she saves special praise for the example of Bruce Springsteen. She was captivated not only by his lyrics, but by the anecdotes and monologues he would use to introduce songs in concert.\n\n“He’s one of our greatest storytellers,” Hennessy says. “But he writes about all kinds of people. That’s what makes him so universal.”\n\nShe made her film debut in 1988 in the thriller “Dead Ringers” with her identical twin sister, Jacqueline (who is now a writer and TV host in Canada).\n\nJill Hennessy later appeared on Broadway in the musical “Buddy.” She later was cast in “Law and Order” as assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid, a role she played until 1996. That was followed by “Crossing Jordan” from 2001 to 2007.\n\nShe has also appeared in several films, including “The Acting Class,” a mockumentary that she wrote and co-directed.\n\nCurrently, Hennessy is appearing on the series “Madam Secretary.” Also in the cast is Keith Carradine, another actor who has won respect as a songwriter and musician. “We both bring our guitars to the set,” Hennessy says.\n\nIn concert, Hennessy will concentrate on her original songs, but she expects to include a smattering of covers. “I love to surprise people,” she says. “But you can bet I’ll probably play something by Springsteen.”\n\nJILL HENNESSY\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Sunday.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWHERE: Ukrainian American\n\nCultural Center, 60 N. Jefferson Road, Whippany\n\nTICKETS: $25 in advance, $29 day of show, $5 for ages 13 to 17, free for ages 12 and under."
