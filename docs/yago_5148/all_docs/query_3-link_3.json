Most recently seen in NBC's mini series event Heroes Reborn (2015) as Phoebe, a troubled girl with extraordinary and dangerous abilities. The child of two actors, Brian Paul and Deborah Tennant, Aislinn has been part of the industry from an early age. Favorite childhood memories are framed by projects she worked on as a child, particularly the Lifetime series Wild Card (2003). Though Aislinn loved working as an actor while still getting to grow up in Toronto, she decided to make a change, for a short while, when she was asked to relocate to Los Angeles to shoot the HBO series Tell Me You Love Me (2007). What was a fun childhood pastime became a lifelong passion while working on this challenging show. Fueled by her experience she returned to Toronto and immediately joined the cast of Degrassi while also attending an arts high school full time as a dance major. After 7 seasons and more than 200 episodes, it was time for Aislinn to say goodbye to Degrassi. Shortly after wrapping she guest starred on hit shows Haven (2010) and Reign (2013) and even did a guest voice on Adult Swim's smash hit Rick and Morty (2013). After spending some time in Los Angeles, she returned to Toronto once more to shoot Heroes Reborn. When Aislinn is not on set or continuing academic pursuits she works closely with the charity Free The Children.\n\nAna was born in Toronto, Canada on January 31st 1996.

She joined her parents, Roy (a car dealer) and Patty (a former Secondary School teacher) and four older brothers -Rob, Brett, and twins Todd and Bram.\n\nAshley's four brothers, all very athletic, played hockey in the winters and baseball in the summers, meaning she basically grew up in arenas and baseball parks.\n\nAshley never actually walked -she danced, so when she was two and a half she started Baby Ballet -and she fell in love.

The next four years were an exciting adventure, collaborating with Shaftesbury Productions on this incredibly successful show. \"Life with Derek\" was ultimately sold to Disney and shown in over 100 countries around the world, breaking records on many networks.\n\nThe success of this show led to a movie called \"Vacation with Derek\"which opened to the highest ratings ever recorded by Family Channel and earned her second Gemini nomination for Best Actress.
