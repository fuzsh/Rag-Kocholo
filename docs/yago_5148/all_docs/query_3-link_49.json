For example, for the word “blue” we might think of happiness under a brightly colored sky, or feeling sad. “Silver” may bring to mind the light of a silvery moon or flatware. Attendees should try to interpret their thoughts or feelings about the assigned word in photographs that they will bring to class (on a thumb drive) to share and discuss. (Note: This course will not address how to use your camera.)\n\nDan Feighery is a retired Air Force officer who has attended photography courses at Northern Virginia Community College and George Mason. He founded the OLLI Photography Club and has taught OLLI photography classes.\n\nF102 Understanding Opera, Part 2\n\nMondays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Glenn Winters\n\nThis course, recommended for beginners and aficionados alike, concludes the survey of Virginia Opera’s main stage productions for the 2013-2014 season at George Mason. Operas to be discussed include Richard Strauss’s whimsical comedy Ariadne auf Naxos and George Bizet’s classic tragedy Carmen. Students will receive comprehensive musical and dramatic analyses of each work, accompanied by audio and video excerpts.\n\nGlenn Winters has been Virginia Opera’s community outreach musical director since 2004 and addresses thousands of Virginians each year for the adult education program Operation Opera. He is the author of The Opera Zoo: Singers, Composers and Other Primates andhas composed two operas commissioned by Virginia Opera. Winters holds a DM degree from Northwestern University.\n\nF103 The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Cults in Rome\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nInstructor: Stephanie Grimes\n\nAncient Rome is often perceived as the quintessential ancestor of Western society. Its history spans centuries of expansion and the conquering and cultivation of foreign lands. An aspect often overlooked in Rome’s history is how its society adapted to foreign cultures and concepts, specifically religion. This course will examine religious cults, both foreign and native to the Romans, and how Roman society incorporated other religions and practices into its established belief system through art, burial practices and literature. Each class will focus on a specific religious cult, its origin, beliefs and practices. The class will be presented with a number of archaeological and art examples to illustrate how Rome accepted, and at times reinterpreted, the cult’s beliefs. The overarching question throughout the course will be: What aspects of a religious cult were adopted throughout the Roman Empire and into modern Western society?\n\nStephanie Grimes recently received her MA in art history at George Mason. She specializes in classical art and archaeology with an emphasis on Roman expansion into Hellenized eastern territories. Stephanie has participated in numerous archaeological digs and site visits across the Mediterranean in Macedonia, Greece, Italy and Spain.\n\nF104 Bedside Singing\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nMessiah United Methodist Church, 6215 Rolling Road, Springfield, Room 203\n\nCoordinator: Maury Crallé 571-216-2900\n\nThis class is intended to develop a style of quiet, a cappella group singing that could be used to bring comfort at the bedside of an ill person. The class will meet each week but will not perform outside the classroom during this term. Participants should have previously sung in a group. Sheet music will be provided from two different songbooks, Angels Hovering Around and Canaanland Classics, which will be used to develop an initial common repertoire. In this way, whoever might be available on the day of an actual performance will know the songs and can fit into an ad hoc bedside group. We will practice with Dr. Robert Rudolph, a trained musical director. This course is not for beginners.\n\nMaury Crallé, a former hospice volunteer, has sung in barbershop groups and church choirs for several years.\n\nF105 Watercolor Painting\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Leonard Justinian\n\nClass Limit: 15\n\nThis class will provide an opportunity for watercolor painters at all levels to develop fresh skills while learning new watercolor techniques. Materials required include: #1, #6 and/or #8 round watercolor brushes; a paint palette for mixing colors; watercolor paper, 140 lb. cold press (Arches is best but you can use less expensive paper); a kneaded eraser; a Staedtler white plastic eraser; tubes of watercolor paint in white, charcoal black, cadmium yellow (medium), cadmium red (medium) and ultramarine blue, or a starter set of watercolors.\n\nLeonard Justinian has been painting for more than 60 years. Among other honors, he has received the coveted Grumbacher Award. He teaches watercolor painting in his Fairfax City studio and is also seen on Fairfax Public Access Cable TV, Cox Cable Channel 10 and Verizon FiOS Channel 10.\n\nR106 The Ongoing Pleasures of Music\n\nMondays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Gloria Sussman\n\nThis music listening course has continued to live up to its promising title. We explore with pleasure the many facets of classical music with the help of DVDs and YouTube. You may sample the wide variety of last term’s musical offerings by searching for Gloria Sussman on YouTube.\n\nGloria Sussman has been teaching at OLLI since 2000 and continues to provide entertaining programs for OLLI at Reston.\n\nL107 Drawing\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Sigrid Blalock\n\nThis class will include basic techniques: gesture, contour and drawings to show weight and volume. Subjects will include figures in motion, still-life objects, portraits and landscapes. Materials needed: drawing pencils #2H, 2B, HB; drawing pens with permanent black ink; 3-4 fine-line markers in red, green, blue and black; one pad white drawing paper 9”x 12”; one pad white Bristol board, 9”x 12”; kneaded rubber and white plastic erasers and a plastic sheet to cover work space.\n\nSigrid Blalock, an instructor of drawing and painting, has degrees from Syracuse University and American University. Her teaching experience includes several years with OLLI and the Smithsonian Associates.\n\n200 Economics & Finance\n\nF201 Tax Preparation Simplified\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nCoordinator: Leo Brennan\n\nThis series of lectures is intended to ease the preparation of your income tax returns.\n\n● Jan. 21: A Review of Federal Tax Laws with an Emphasis on Senior-related Issues. Thomas Loftus is the tax training specialist for AARP Tax-Aide, Virginia. He will focus on the preparation of federal income tax returns.\n\n● Jan. 28: A Review of Virginia Tax Laws for Senior Consideration. Thomas Loftus will build on the previous lecture, describing the requirements of Virginia tax laws in preparing federal and state tax returns, and using the content and organization of your “shoebox” to help prepare your returns.\n\n● Feb. 4: A Chat with a Tax Preparer. John Woods, Derek Cundill and Barry DeMaio, experienced tax preparers, will lead a panel discussion on issues, experiences and expenses involved in using tax preparation services. This discussion will include planning suggestions for working with a tax preparer and the code of ethics required of preparers when assisting customers.\n\n● Feb. 11: What You Always Wanted to Know about Your Taxes but Were Afraid to Ask. Linda de Marlor, who teaches tax law to real estate and educational institutions, will give a short presentation on issues that affect most seniors and then open the session to questions on real estate, legal and financial issues. Linda, who has appeared on hundreds of TV and radio shows, is returning to OLLI for her eighth season.\n\nF202 The Tom Crooker Investment Forum\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nModerator: Al Smuzynski\n\nThe Investment Forum, which meets weekly throughout the year, addresses investment topics of particular interest to retirees. A weekly agenda is distributed and each session begins with an open discussion of recent events in the economy and financial markets and their impact on investment decisions. Member presentations typically include such topics as recent market indicators, stocks, bonds, funds (mutual, exchange-traded and closed-end), REITS, options, commodities, master limited partnerships, sectors, allocations and investment strategies. We use analyses and data from the financial press. The forum website http://www.olligmu.org/~finforum/ includes agendas and articles of interest submitted by members.\n\nAl Smuzynski, a retired bank regulator and an advocate of affordable housing, currently serves on the boards of Virginia Community Capital and Community Capital Bank of Virginia.\n\nF203 Retired with Questions\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nCoordinator: Leo Brennan\n\nAs seniors look through the kaleidoscope of life, we find our world constantly changing. That said, we hunger to know what others are doing in similar situations. This open forum, an outgrowth of Investment Forum and other OLLI classes, is designed to address the concerns of seniors regarding a wide range of retirement issues. We will assemble a panel of experienced investors, including: Al Smuzynski, Investment Forum moderator; Lou Coglianese, Investment Forum member; Mike May, seniors’ financial planner and Helen Flynn, seniors’ real estate expert, to provide answers to member questions through friendly discussions. Topics to be discussed may include: making your money last, annuities, fixed income, asset allocations, management of IRAs, staying in your home, downsizing and moving to a new location.\n\n● Jan. 23: Class members will identify their areas of concern.\n\n● Jan. 30–Feb. 13: Panel members will address member concerns.\n\nL204 Aging on Your Own Terms\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nModerator: Megan Descutner\n\nThe playbook for aging on your own terms provides valuable information and resources for seniors about health, legal and money matters and living options that can help you make decisions that will affect the rest of your life. Megan Descutner, a geriatric care manager for Golden Pond ElderCare Strategies, will moderate a panel of experts that includes: Steve Simmons, MD of DocTalkers; Valerie Geiger of The Geiger Firm; Susan Ballenger, director of marketing and admissions for Spring Arbor of Leesburg; Anne Blackstone, a physical therapist and coordinator of the Inova Loudoun Hospital Outpatient Clinic and Kate DeWitt, professional daily money manager for Mom Personal Money Matters. The presenters will use case studies based on actual situations and questions will be welcomed. The fourth session, to be presented by Dr. Simmons, will focus on the health conditions that most often contribute to the need for assistance and services, including what you need to know about dealing with dementia.\n\n300 History & International Studies\n\nF301 How a Few Overlooked Technologies Changed History\n\nMondays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: William Reader\n\nThis course will deliver a brief historical overview of a few generally overlooked or taken-for-granted technologies, such as eyeglasses, clocks, typewriters, air conditioning and contraceptive pills, and show how they changed history. There will also be a surprise technology or two.\n\nWilliam Reader has a PhD in American social history from the University of Massachusetts. He retired in February 2008 after 37 years with the federal government and has since taught a number of history-based OLLI courses.\n\nF302 Civil War Potpourri: Part II\n\nMondays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Patrick McGinty\n\nThis class will focus on irregular warfare and terrorism before and during the Civil War. We will begin by examining prewar events in “Bleeding Kansas,” followed by John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry. Our wartime discussion will center on William Quantrill, “Bloody Bill” Anderson and the massacres at Fort Pillow and Sand Creek. We will pause briefly to ask the question: What were the rules of warfare at this time? (The answer may surprise you.) We then switch our focus to political assassinations (both successful and unsuccessful), chemical and biological warfare, arson and sabotage. This course differs significantly from the Civil War Potpourri course offered during the fall 2012 term; therefore, attendance at the previous course is not required for this one.\n\nPatrick McGinty, an OLLI member, is a retired naval officer with an MA and PhD from Georgetown University. He taught history courses for University of Maryland University College from 1989 to 2007, where his primary areas of concentration were the histories of terrorism, violence and substance abuse in America.\n\nF303 Russia Study Group\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nModerator: Gordon Canyock\n\nClass limit: 30\n\nRussia continues to play a major role in international affairs, often as a thorn in the side of its neighbors and the U.S. This enigmatic nation wields considerable economic power in Europe and Central Asia and retains a huge nuclear arsenal. This seminar will examine various aspects of contemporary Russia, including the rise of a disaffected urban middle class, Putin’s appeals to traditional Russian nationalism, its foreign policy goals and the prospects for the modernization and reform of both its economy and its military. Each week short articles or website references will be emailed to the class in order to prepare for discussions that will follow brief lectures.\n\nGordon Canyock is a long-time OLLI member with an MA in Soviet Area Studies from the University of Kansas. He served as the commandant of the U.S. Army Russian Institute and as military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. He later worked in Russia for the State Department as a special assistant for humanitarian aid.\n\nF304 National Park Ranger Potpourri VI\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nJewish Community Center\n\nCoordinators: Michael T. Kelly, Emmett Fenlon\n\nIt’s back for Round 6! Due to the level of interest raised by the “potpourri” concept during the 2009-2013 winter terms, the National Park Service proudly offers four new “mystery” topics. We hope to explore fascinating stories and personalities that most people rarely, if ever, associate with either Washington, D.C. or the repertoire of National Mall park rangers. If you desire to learn more about obscure local connections to our national heritage, then join us for a fascinating journey of discovery.\n\nNational Park Service rangers have participated with OLLI in over 75 thematic courses, special events and trips since 2001.\n\nF305 W.W. II: German Battleships and Birth of the Atomic Age\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 22–Feb. 5\n\nThree sessions\n\nInstructor: Alan McKie\n\n● Jan. 22: The Graf Spee. One of Hitler’s secret weapons, prowling the South Atlantic at the outbreak of World War II, this technically advanced “pocket battleship” wreaked havoc with ships supplying Great Britain with much-needed food from South America. It took eight British battle groups, including three battleships, two battle cruisers and four aircraft carriers—plus a large measure of intrigue—to put her out of action. Recently uncovered evidence tells us why her captain chose not to fight his way out of Montevideo harbor.\n\n● Jan. 29: The Bismarck and Tirpitz. Unable to challenge Great Britain’s navy with a high-seas fleet, Germany built several battleships to ravage British merchant shipping in the North Atlantic. The Bismarck was sunk on its first foray but its sister ship, the Tirpitz, tied up large numbers of British warships desperately needed elsewhere. The many attempts to sink the Tirpitz in the fjords of Norway are a story of determination and frustration lasting more than three years.\n\n● Feb. 5: The Birth of the Atomic Age. The conquest of Tinian Island by Allied Forces in W.W. II led to the construction of the largest airfield in the world to serve as a base for B-29s to bomb Japan into submission. The fateful flight of the Enola Gay from Tinian in August 1945 to drop the first of the only two atomic bombs used in wartime has produced a continuing controversy surrounding the public display of this particular aircraft. It has also provided new insights into the debate regarding the morality of using atomic weapons.\n\nAlan McKie retired from federal service as a senior executive in 1994. Since then he has served as a volunteer research and tour docent at the National Museum of the U.S. Navy, located at the Washington Navy Yard.\n\nF306 On the Road to Wounded Knee\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Ephriam D. Dickson III\n\nDuring the 19th century, American expansion westward collided with the Lakota (or Sioux) nation, the most powerful society on the northern Great Plains. Discover how events, from Lewis and Clark to the Bozeman Trail War, and from the Little Bighorn to the Wounded Knee Massacre, have shaped Lakota society today.\n\nEphriam D. Dickson III taught OLLI classes at the University of Utah for five years. He recently moved to Northern Virginia to join the project team for the new National Museum of the U.S. Army to be located at Fort Belvoir.\n\nF307 A Clash of Empires: Europe and the New World\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: John C. Carter\n\nThe discovery and settlement of Virginia and the New World by Europeans was nothing less than an invasion of a land occupied by existing native empires. England, France and Spain justified their conquest of the “barbaric” Indian peoples based on their claim that they sought to bring them to civility and Christianity. It was more than a clash of cultures, however. It was war, based on European economic and political goals in which the indigenous people were viewed as merely obstacles, like the mountains and the forests that needed to be overcome. The Indians, however, fought back against the invaders while skillfully maneuvering themselves into alliances with European powers in an effort to preserve their own empires. We will follow the progress of Indian-European relations up to 1850.\n\nJohn C. Carter graduated from Ferrum College and the University of Tennessee and earned master’s degrees at George Mason in history and psychology. He worked for over 35 years in university administration, retiring recently from Christopher Newport University.\n\nR308 The Battle of Britain\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Feb. 6–Feb. 13\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Douglas Hottel\n\nMost scholars, armchair historians and the general public have agreed that the outcome of the 1940 Anglo-German air war over England, France and the English Channel prevented a German invasion and occupation of Britain. But facts have merged with legend to blur the reality of the struggle for air supremacy. This two-session program will include a review of the larger strategic context, air combat tactics, emerging technologies and key decisions that determined the outcome in Britain’s favor. To present a 1940 perspective of the desperate struggle the presentation will include film, graphic displays, extracts from interviews of surviving air crews on both sides and the experiences of ordinary British citizens.\n\nDouglas Hottel, an OLLI member since 2010, is a retired naval intelligence officer and Department of Defense analyst and operations manager. He has a BA in history and political science from Bethany College, an MA in international studies from the Catholic University of America and an MA in national security and strategic studies from the U.S. Naval War College.\n\nL309 Engineers of Victory in World War II, Part 2\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nInstructor: Mark Weinstein\n\nThis is Part 2 of an earlier course. Part 1 covered the management and technology efforts that began in 1940 and made the U.S. the Arsenal of Democracy. Part 1 concluded with the development and organization of a new field, operational research, which provided the new weapons and technologies that would counter the early success of Germany’s U-boats. Part 2 picks up with the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, where Churchill and Roosevelt proclaimed the grand design for the invasion of Europe and the eventual campaign against Japan. What followed for the next year and a half were the most massive planning and supply operations in history as the U.S. sought to overcome the formidable and technologically advanced defenses of Germany and Japan.\n\n● Jan. 22: Winning Command of the Air. The Battle of Britain, the bombing of the German heartland and the development of the long-range escort fighter.\n\n● Jan. 29: Stopping a Blitzkrieg. The use of armor and special weapons.\n\n● Feb. 5: Seizing an Enemy-held Shore. The planning, special crafts, artificial harbors, ingenious fuel pipelines and technologically supported deception.\n\n● Feb. 12: Defeating the Tyranny of Distance in the Pacific. U.S. Naval command and control, amphibious landing craft, the B-29 and the story of the Seabees.\n\nMark Weinstein, a six-year OLLI member, is a retired electrical engineer and a docent at both Smithsonian Air and Space Museums.\n\nL310 Civil War Naval Actions and the Rules of War\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Keith Young\n\nDuring the Civil War there were several significant joint operations by the Union army and navy, two on the Gulf Coast and one on the Atlantic seaboard. These successful operations demonstrated a need for improving this type of warfare while showing its potential. The Civil War also laid the foundation for the first comprehensive codification of the laws of war. Dr. Francis Lieber, working with a board of four Union generals, brought order to the largely unwritten set of rules for warfare that had evolved over several centuries of political usage and custom. The following topics will be covered:\n\n● Jan. 23: The Fall of New Orleans. The early surrender of the South’s largest and wealthiest city in 1862.\n\n● Jan. 30: The Battle of Mobile Bay. A Union victory sealing the major port of Mobile in 1864.\n\n● Feb. 6: Fort Fisher and Wilmington. The last major stronghold of the Confederacy to fall, 1864-1865.\n\n● Feb. 13: General Order No. 100. Dr. Francis Lieber and the codification of the rules of war.\n\nKeith Young, a retired naval officer with an interest in military history, lectures on many Civil War and World War II topics.\n\n400 Literature, Theater, & Writing\n\nF401 Readers’ Theater\n\nMondays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nCoordinator: Russell Stone\n\nClass limit: 28\n\nOLLI’s unique brand of Readers’ Theater is great fun for the hams among us! If the idea of acting appeals to you, come and give it a try. Scripts are usually short skits, acts or scenes from longer plays. Parts are handed out each week for the following week. Occasionally a longer script needs a designated director. We do not memorize parts; instead we rehearse them before class with our fellow actors. Rehearsals often take place between OLLI classes, but also can be done by phone if there are just two characters. Props or costumes are not required, but the actors often dress for the part in some way––perhaps with a hat or scarf.

Workshop members should bring an original poem in draft or revised form to each session.

We will carefully examine three of his seminal works, known collectively as “The African Trilogy,” which show Nigerian society caught between tribal tradition and the demands of a rapidly changing society. Things Fall Apart (1958) is the story of the Igbo leader Okonkwo, who struggles to adjust to the changes caused by British colonization and Christianity in the 1890s. In No Longer at Ease (1960), Obi Okonkwo, Okonkwo’s grandson who has been educated in England, returns to Lagos only to clash with the ruling elite, to which he believes he now belongs. Arrow of God (1964) is set in the 1920s and focuses on the conflict of chief priest Ezuelu with the British, eager to get on with their role as civilizers and missionaries after World War I. The first class will present Chinua Achebe as a writer, poet, professor and critic. The three short novels then will be read for class discussion in their order of publication. These novels are available individually or in a single volume. The instructor will use the Everyman Library compilation (ISBN 978-0-307-59270-5).\n\nBarbara Nelson, an OLLI member, taught for over 30 years at the secondary level, the last 20 at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

In Japan and elsewhere it has attracted many anxious to explore its short, direct expression and apparent ease of preparation. But there is a vast depth beneath the tip of this Oriental iceberg that we will explore with examples from Basho through Jack Kerouac to the present day. We will also visit haiku’s usually raucous sister, senryu, that laughs at the ironies of the human comedy. We will conclude with an opportunity to compose in both verse forms. This class is a reprise of one first taught in February 2009 at OLLI (but far better).\n\nMike McNamara is a retired U.S. Army colonel with degrees in English literature from Rutgers University and the University of Kansas.

Then we will discuss this ancient epic that tells of heroes and dramatic fights against monsters, a great flood and a journey to the underworld. In the second session we will look at some interesting parallels between parts of the story of Gilgamesh and parts of Genesis. We will compare the way the harlot transforms Enkidu from half-animal and half-human to entirely human through her sexuality and the way Adam and Eve are transformed into fully human beings by eating the apple. Then we will look at the flood story in Gilgamesh and note its remarkable similarities to the flood story in Genesis. Conclusions may be drawn and are always welcome.\n\nDiane Thompson received her PhD in Comparative Literature at the City University of New York in 1981 and has been teaching English and world literature at Northern Virginia Community College ever since.\n\nL413 Books!

Means\n\nThe past few decades have seen many new titles of fiction and nonfiction emerging from the South Asian subcontinent of India and Pakistan. Besides Nobel winners like Tagore, Naipal and Rushdie, many other works have been honored with high international praise: The God of Small Things, The Interpreter of Maladies and The Song of the Road top the list. Translated for English readers, these stories are set in the exotic worlds of Bengal, Kerala, Punjab and Mumbai. This course asks why these new, imaginative works are capturing Western readers and how these writers brought enlightening motifs and themes to the Western psyche. Join this geographic hopscotch around the Indian subcontinent as we discover its inventive new literary stars through lecture, media and class discussion. A list of suggested readings can be found on the OLLI DocStore.\n\nPatty Z.

Campbell assumed the editorship of Astounding. He and the authors he discovered and mentored shaped the stories and themes of modern science fiction. In this course we will first examine Campbell’s impact on the genre and also some key stories published in the 1930s and 1940s. Subsequent sessions will each focus on the works and influence of the Big Three science fiction authors who dominated the mid-century: Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nAgatha Taormina, an OLLI member, received a doctor of arts degree from Carnegie-Mellon University, where her dissertation discussed the function of archetypes in science fiction.

Was he a Cynic philosopher, Marxist, revolutionary zealot, protofeminist, prophet, son of God, magician or God? Over the past 2,000 years, all these titles, and many more, have been applied to the carpenter’s son from Nazareth. In this fast-paced, academically-based course, we will attempt to reveal the authentic Jesus of history by examining what modern historians have to say about this enigmatic 1st century Palestinian Jew. Topics for discussion will include sources for the historical Jesus and the critical methods historians use to evaluate these sources. We will also examine what historians have written about the major chapters in the life of Jesus. Ample time will be available before, during and after class for in-depth questions. Owning a copy of the New Testament is useful, but not mandatory.\n\nJack Dalby, president of White Oak Communications, is an OLLI member who has taught classes on the historical Jesus, St. Paul and early Christianity. He holds a BS in communication arts from James Madison University and has taken graduate classes with the George Mason History Department.\n\nF602 Jewish and Christian Religious Philosophers\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: John Rybicki\n\nThis is a videoconference transmission of course L606.\n\nF603 The Evolution of the Haggadah and the Passover Seder\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 21–Jan. 28\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Gilah Goldsmith\n\n● Jan. 21: The History of the Passover Haggadah. The haggadah, the manual for conducting the annual Passover ritual known as the seder, has existed in one written form or another since the middle of the 9th century CE. Over 5,000 editions have been published. It is a peculiar collection of prayers, songs, tall tales, Biblical quotations and rabbinic speculation designed to enable each participant to experience the Exodus from Egypt. We will explore what the many iterations of the haggadah can tell us about the social, intellectual and religious life of the Jewish people across history and cultures.\n\n● Jan. 28: The Evolution of the Passover Seder. In any given year, more American Jews participate in a Passover seder than engage in any other Jewish ritual or observance. Over more than 2,000 years, the ritual meal has evolved from an animal sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem to a communal meal. While retaining its ancient structure, the seder has been repeatedly adapted to reflect the concerns of Jewish people and communities. We will examine how the seder has evolved with emphasis on the historical context of that evolution, including the religious, political and social concerns that continue to motivate it.\n\nGilah Goldsmith, a graduate of Harvard University and George Washington University Law School, is a retired government attorney who has led the weekly Torah study group at Beth El Hebrew Congregation for the past 20 years. She has a collection of approximately 300 haggadahs, ranging from a facsimile of a medieval manuscript to modern pamphlets.\n\nF604 Topics in Religion\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Steven C. Goldman\n\n● The Theology of Les Miserables. Sacrifice, forgiveness, the refusal of forgiveness, repentance, redemption, law, justice, grace, mercy, pride, greed, humility, perfected love. These are some of the grand themes of the human condition that are explored in Victor Hugo’s classic 19th century novel Les Miserables. In two sessions we will examine how Les Miserables presents a romantic, sublime theology that challenges us to introspection regarding our own ethical standards and interpersonal relationships.\n\n● Slavery, the Bible and Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address. In his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln highlighted the irony that both North and South used the same Bible to declare their cause to be just. Who had the better case based on Biblical texts? How did Abraham Lincoln read the Bible and how did it influence his understanding of slavery and the Civil War? In this session, we will explore the answers to these questions and see how Lincoln crafted an elegant argument regarding the hand of God in human history.\n\n● Does the New Testament Teach that God Is a Trinity? Almost all Christian denominations believe that God is a Trinity composed of three co-equal persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Is it possible to be a Christian without believing that God is a Trinity, or is this a fundamental article of faith? In this session we will explore what the New Testament says about this doctrine.\n\nSteven C. Goldman is a member of OLLI’s Board of Directors and also serves as chair of OLLI’s Religious Studies Program Planning Group. He has taught numerous courses on alternative understandings of Biblical doctrines.\n\nR605 Basics of Islam\n\nMondays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Farhanahz Ellis\n\nIslam is a faith we hear about on an almost daily basis, but what do we really know about it?\n\n● What are the basics of Islam and what do they have in common with other faiths?\n\n● What is the shared origin of the Quran, Islam’s holy book, with other holy books?\n\n● Who are the Sunnis, who are the Shias and what are the differences between them?\n\n● What is the reality behind Islam’s treatment of women, and why are there so many misconceptions?\n\nFarhanahz Ellis is the interfaith and outreach director for the All Dulles Area Muslims Society and serves as a Muslim chaplain at George Mason.\n\nL606 Jewish and Christian Religious Philosophers\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: John Rybicki\n\nThis class will focus on an investigation of key philosophers and philosophies in developmental Judaism and Christianity, with an emphasis on methodologies, similarities and divergent views. We will pair Jewish and Christian philosophers: Philo of Alexandria and John the Evangelist (both 1st century), and Maimonides (12th century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th century). Topics will include the nature and attributes of God and how He is made known, creation, scripture, wisdom and the purpose and inherent capabilities of humankind. These religious thinkers have had a profound effect on the development of specific traditions that exist to this day.\n\nJohn Rybicki, OLLI’s longtime instructor in religious studies, presents lively, informative lectures that encourage participation.\n\n650 Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nF651 Tribal Cultures of Afghanistan and Central Asia\n\nMondays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Johnnie Hicks\n\nClass Limit: 30\n\nTribal cultures are the world’s oldest form of society, yet the least understood in the modern world. There are large tribal groups who still practice their cultures and traditions throughout the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and other places around the world. This class will focus on the tribal cultures of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the five other “stans” of Central Asia. Class topics include:\n\n● Understanding the Nature of Tribal Cultures.\n\n● The “Stans” of Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\n● Tribal Groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n● The Pashtun (Afghan) Tribes and Political Implications for the Region.\n\nJohnnie Hicks has traveled to several regions of the world, including Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she encountered many different tribal groups.

Now it’s OLLI’s turn. Join fellow trivia lovers for fun and games as we form teams of two to six players to compete in answering questions that will challenge your brain cells. For example, which plains state claims to be the birthplace of Cliff Notes and the Reuben sandwich? All you have to bring to class is a good attitude, a willingness to have fun and a pencil with a good eraser! All levels of knowledge are welcome.\n\nBruce Mercer, an OLLI member, enjoys learning new things, especially those obscure tidbits that spark a quest for new knowledge. He has used some of these nuggets to create trivia questions that are sure to please and stump you.\n\nR653 Genealogy: 1850–1920\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: Ken Maniha\n\nThis course will concentrate on researching ancestors who migrated to America between 1850 and 1920, including Germans, Poles, Irish, Italians, East Europeans and Russians. The sessions will focus on specific genealogical problems in researching ancestors from this group. We will discuss the use of passenger manifests, census enumerations, naturalization records, military records and other ways to trace immigrants back to their origins.\n\nKen Maniha has a PhD in sociology from the University of Michigan, has credentials as a professional genealogist and belongs to the Association of Professional Genealogists. He has been working in genealogy for 30 years, first as a hobby and now as a full-time professional.\n\nR654 The CIA and the 1954 Guatemalan Coup\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: Richard Melanson\n\nClass Limit: 35\n\nThis discussion class will examine the CIA’s role in the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala, in 1954. After briefly reviewing the record of U.S. foreign policy in Central America since the construction of the Panama Canal, we will assess the role of the United Fruit Company in this regime change and the legacy of the 1953 Iranian coup in persuading the Eisenhower administration to oust Arbenz. We will use as the required text Bitter Fruit: The Story of the American Coup in Guatemala (revised and expanded edition, 2005) by Stephen Schlesinger and Stephen Kinzer (ISBN 0-674-01930-X). For the first class students should read chapters 1-4.\n\nRichard Melanson is an OLLI member who has taught international relations and American foreign policy at UCLA, Kenyon College, Brown University and the National War College during a 38-year academic career. He holds a PhD in international relations from The Johns Hopkins University.\n\nR655 OLLIgopoly: Trivia for Fun\n\nWednesdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center, Lake Anne\n\nInstructor: Bruce Mercer\n\nThis is a reprise of F652 at Tallwood with different questions, different teams and different winners.\n\nSee F652 for instructor information.\n\nR656 Is America a Christian Nation?\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Stephen Ruth\n\nAn article by George Mason’s Robinson Professor Hugh Heclo posed this question and presented many approaches to answering it. This course reviews the Heclo perspective and also examines the history of the United States in the context of our Christian roots. There are 2,500 different Christian denominations represented in America. We will discuss U.S. Christianity from the perspectives of preachers from William Bradford and Jonathan Edwards to Billy Graham; and presidents, from George Washington to Barack Obama. If time permits, we will also take a brief look at public policy issues like religious freedom, slavery, civil rights, the concept of a “just war,” the role of women, obligations to the poor, church-state relationships, homosexuality, abortion, taxation, voting rights and scripture-based legislation. Both Old and New Testaments will be emphasized and attendees from any belief system are welcome.\n\nStephen Ruth is a professor of public policy at George Mason, specializing in technology issues associated with globalization, and is director of the International Center for Applied Studies in Information Technology, a grant-supported research center. His new book, One Year Trip through the Bible: A Layman’s Fresh View of the Complete Old and New Testaments, examines 73 books of the Hebrew Tanakh and the New Testament.\n\nR657 A Century of Genocide\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Paul Murad\n\nGenocide has no morality, memory, conscience or culture; it exercises hatred against a minority. Genocide killed Armenians. Ukrainians died under Stalin. The Holocaust killed Jews, Poles and gypsies. The killing fields of Indochina are filled with slaughtered Cambodians. The Rwandan genocide killed 125,000 people in a single weekend. Serbs massacred Bosnians and the Sudanese butchered Africans in Darfur. Clearly genocide does not discriminate based upon religion; it swallowed whole Christian Armenians, European Jews, Cambodian Buddhists and Bosnian Moslems. Genocide knows no color; it devours whites, yellows or blacks. Genocide is mindless; it devours the educated and uneducated. It thrives on ignorance and, if it is not recognized for what it really is, it will continue to propagate. Who will be the next victims? Will they be the Turkish and Iraqi Kurds who want their own nation, or is Africa ready to shed more blood and tears?\n\nPaul Murad is a scientist, engineer and former paratrooper who later worked for the Department of Defense. He is especially aware of the importance of stopping needless conflicts that often trigger genocides. Both he and presenter George Pick have studied the causes and results of genocides.\n\n700 Current Events\n\nF701 What’s in the Daily News?\n\nMondays, 9:30–11:00, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nNote time\n\nModerators: Peter Van Ryzin, Dorsey Chescavage\n\nClass Limit: 36\n\nDo you have an opinion on what’s happening in the world today?

If so, join other news junkies each week to discuss, debate and, yes, sometimes disagree as to the significance and meaning of events both great and small. All views are welcomed in a spirit of give-and-take.\n\nPeter Van Ryzin, an addicted news junky and OLLI member, was a career Marine who served two combat tours in Vietnam before retiring as a colonel in 1990.\n\nDorsey Chescavage, an OLLI member, retired from the Jefferson Consulting Group, where she was a registered lobbyist specializing in military and veterans’ health care.\n\nF702 Why Congress Isn’t Working\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 22–Jan. 29\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: David Heymsfeld\n\nSince 2008, the United States Congress has been torn by partisan strife, leaving it gridlocked and rarely able to pass legislation on important issues. A mock headline in The Onion says it all: “Congress Fiercely Divided Over Completely Blank Bill That Says and Does Nothing” (July 25, 2013). It wasn’t always this way. The Congresses of the 1960s through 1980s passed major legislation, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and landmark laws on the environment, education and civil rights. In this course we will focus on the causes of the gridlock that began to develop in the 1990s. We will also look at what roles different groups, such as the media, lobbyists, congressional staff and the president, play in the legislative process. As a long-term congressional staffer, the instructor was a firsthand witness to the decline of congressional effectiveness. The course will include examples and observations based on his personal experience.\n\nDavid Heymsfeld, an OLLI member, served on the professional staff of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for 35 years, including 14 years as director of the Democratic professional staff.\n\nF703 Politics in the 2014 Midterm Elections\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Helen Desfosses\n\nWhile the president does not run in midterm elections, all 435 members of the House of Representatives do, as well as dozens of senators. This course will investigate what history tells us should happen in 2014 (the party out of power should get stronger), as well as what is likely to happen. (Yes, the instructor will stick her neck out and make some predictions.) The course will assess influential issues and the political forces that will play a significant role, including the Tea Party, discontented progressives, new money and social media. We will also examine what the 2014 elections will mean for President Obama’s agenda and for the prospects of his would-be successors. Finally, we will explore whether our country’s unending partisan warfare and resulting policy paralysis will be relieved or exacerbated by the 2014 midterm election results.\n\nHelen Desfosses’ fascination with politics has been shaped by many years as a professor of public policy, serving as an elected official and working as an international consultant on legislative development and public engagement. She has a BA from Mount Holyoke College, an MA from Harvard University and a PhD from Boston University.\n\nR704 All the News That’s Fit to Print\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nModerator: Dick Kennedy\n\nThis is a chance to discuss news and current events with other seniors who are trying to understand our changing world. More than ever we need to question information that comes to us from TV, radio, the Internet, magazines, bumper stickers and newspapers. How should we filter these sources? We will examine and discuss some of the hot topics of the day in world and national news, science, business, sports and entertainment. All viewpoints and opinions are respected, needed and welcomed. As Walter Cronkite once said, “In a democracy agreement is not required, but participation is.”\n\nDick Kennedy is an OLLI member and a retiree from the Senior Executive Service at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He enjoys analyzing the news from multiple sources and engaging in good discussions with colleagues.\n\nR705 Challenges in Journalism Today\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center, Lake Anne\n\nCoordinator: Jennifer Disano\n\nJournalism is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the collection and editing of news for presentation through the media.” In today’s fast-paced, information-hungry world there are many different types of media used to share news, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print, social networks and Internet blogs. This course will be a series of lectures with speakers representing various media addressing the challenges of journalism in the Washington D.C. area.\n\n800 Science, Technology & Health\n\nF801 CORONA, GAMBIT and HEXAGON\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Feb. 4–Feb. 11\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Garrett Cochran\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed the development of a remarkable trio of photographic satellites that played a critical role in keeping the Cold War cold. These systems and the technologies for exploiting their outputs represent the combined efforts of more than 20 U.S. corporations and a dozen government organizations. Details of one system were made public in 1995. In late 2012, the intelligence community declassified information on the other two. So now the story can be told.\n\nGarrett Cochran, a longtime OLLI member, spent most of his professional career at the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was deeply involved in the activities he will be discussing.\n\nF802 Sustainable Living\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nCoordinator: Jennifer Disano\n\n● Jan. 21: Solar and Super-Insulated Homes. Rich and Marian Taschler, whose home has twice been included on the Department of Energy’s Solar Home Tours, are celebrating 30 years of “pocket change” utility bills. They are self-taught do-it-yourselfers who will present their success story, with the primary focus on installing super insulation that cost them only $300. They also designed and installed their own solar hot water system.\n\n● Jan. 28: Permaculture. Danielle Wyman from the Mason Sustainability Institute will discuss the benefits of practicing permaculture (or permanent/perennial agriculture) in Northern Virginia. Permaculture principles include such areas as edible forest gardening, biodiversity, food production, earth works, natural building and many more. Join Danielle as she covers the basics of permaculture and takes you on a virtual tour of several student-led permaculture gardens on the Mason campus. You will also receive a sneak preview of material that will be covered in the 2014 Permaculture Design Certification course at Mason.\n\n● Feb. 4: Electric Cars: Past, Present and Future. Jeffrey Jacobs, Dennis Dineen and Bruce Lawton from the Electric Vehicle Association of D.C. will discuss the pros and cons of electric vehicles. Most people aren’t aware that electric cars were more common than petroleum-based models 100 years ago. A lot has changed since then, from the EV1 to the Tesla Roadster, Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Volt. Electric cars are here to stay, helping the environment, ensuring national security and saving drivers lots of cash.\n\n● Feb. 11: Biofuels. Jill Hamilton, president and founder of Sustainable Energy Strategies, Inc., will provide an overview of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. The discussion will include their current use in our fuel supply, their benefits and common misconceptions about them.\n\nF803 iPad for Beginners\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nInstructor: Stan Schretter\n\nSo you just got an iPad or think you want to get one. Join Stan for an introduction to the iPad and how it can affect your life. No experience or even an iPad is necessary, but if you have one please bring it to the class.\n\nStan Schretter, an OLLI member, is an avid amateur photographer and has taught courses at OLLI for many years.\n\nF804 Beginner Chen-Style Tai Chi\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:05, Jan. 23–Feb. 13\n\nNote time\n\nInstructor: Jerry Cheng\n\nClass Limit: 20\n\nTai chi, a form of martial arts that has been practiced for centuries, is meditation in motion that emphasizes balance, posture and concentration. This beginning class will focus on chen-style tai chi, which promotes health and fitness, strengthens the immune system, can relieve neck and back pain, corrects digestive problems, aids emotional and psychological well-being, relieves stress and builds character. Please wear loose clothing and plan to work in stocking feet or soft, flexible shoes.\n\nJerry Cheng was born in China and started his martial arts training when he was six. He studied under several famous Chinese martial arts masters, including grandmaster Sha GuoZheng, and won four gold medals at the 1997 Atlanta International Martial Arts Championship. He taught tai chi at the University of Georgia for six years and the University of Texas for three years.\n\nR805 History of Life on Earth, Part II\n\nMondays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 20–Feb. 10\n\nInstructor: Steve Greenhouse\n\nThis course is a follow-on to Part I, which concluded with the end of the Cretaceous Period 65 million years ago. It saw the mass extinction of dinosaurs (except birds) but opened a niche in which mammals could thrive. Small arboreal creatures evolved into primates, then hominids and finally Homo, the genus of which we (Homo sapiens) are the only living species. We will trace these evolutionary transitions and discuss the characteristics and migrations of early humans, who became tool makers and hunter-gatherers and learned to talk and think. Course materials include PowerPoint slides supplemented (time permitting) by the Great Courses DVDs, “Major Transitions in Evolution.” A guest lecturer, Dr. Briana Pobiner from the Museum of Natural History’s Human Origins Program, will present one of the four sessions.\n\nSteve Greenhouse is a retired electrical engineer who worked in the space communications field for 35 years. He has long been fascinated by paleontology and especially paleoanthropology–the evolution of humans.\n\nR806 iPad: Part 3 Tuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: Stan Schretter\n\nThis is the third of an ongoing series of short iPad classes in Reston. So far we have explored an overview of iPad apps and how the iPad can be used to support photography and photographers. This class will look at how the iPad can become your file cabinet of information. We will explore using iPad apps to find the information you want, as well as transferring material that you have on your PC or laptop. To demonstrate how this works in terms of a practical problem, we will focus on how the iPad can help plan and guide your travels. Possibly on your next trip you will just pack your iPad, passport and maybe some extra clothes.\n\nSee F803 for instructor information.\n\nR807 How to Look and Feel Younger\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center, Lake Anne\n\nCoordinator: Mary Kornreich\n\n● Jan. 22: The Science of Looking and Feeling Younger.

We will go into more depth for specific applications such as mail, iCloud, photos and apps in which you are personally interested. Make sure that your iPad is charged and that you have updated to the latest version of the operating system (iOS). Additionally, you should know your Apple ID and password. Bring pen and paper for taking notes. You must have a George Mason ID number and an active George Mason email address before taking this class. They can be requested at any OLLI office and take approximately two weeks to obtain.\n\nCharlie Pryor retired from the U.S. Army in 1988 and from his second career as a civil engineer in 2005. He has taught at the university level, at military engineer schools and continuing education courses. He has also taught numerous classes on computing at OLLI.\n\nL809 Climate Change\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 21–Feb. 11\n\nInstructor: Robert Means\n\nThis course primarily addresses two questions. First, what determines the Earth’s temperature? Astronomers are searching for planets located within the habitable zone around other stars, where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold for life (as we know it). Why does the Earth itself fall within that zone? Second, why do most climate scientists believe that human activity is making the Earth warmer? There are two approaches to answering this question. One is to examine how humans are changing factors that determine the Earth’s temperature. The second is to measure actual changes in that temperature. The test of our understanding of Earth’s climate is the link between these approaches. Do the factors that we believe determine the Earth’s temperature explain why it is warmer now than it was 200 years ago and cooler than it was 50 million years ago? Time permitting, we will also look at potential responses to global warming.\n\nRobert Means teaches courses in climate and energy policy at The Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland.\n\nL810 Our Industrialized Food Products\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nInstructor: Erica Laufer\n\nAre we eating Frankenfood? Why are pesticides, antibiotics and chemicals in our food? Are they dangerous? The Food and Drug Administration says our food is safe, but it may be catering to a few corporations that own virtually all the products on our grocery shelves. Did a good idea—lots of cheap food for the world’s exploding population—go astray? Immense farms, owned by large corporations and supported by federal subsidies, may sacrifice quality for quantity to obtain more shareholder profit. Is our changed food causing epidemics of obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease? What is being done and could be done to improve the situation?\n\nErica Laufer, an attorney and OLLI member, retired from both government and private law practice. In Ocean City, Maryland, where she ran several businesses, she was too busy to cook and ate only fast food and drank diet sodas. She developed insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis—all allegedly caused by her diet. This led her to research what is in our food, how is it made and by whom, and to share what she has learned.\n\n900 Other Topics\n\nF901 - Cancelled - Comfort Foods III\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Jan. 22–Feb. 12\n\nInstructor: Debbie Halverson\n\nClass Limit: 12\n\nParticipants in last winter’s Comfort Foods class agreed that the hug of good food is always welcome on a cold winter’s day. So we start where we left off last year with a new menu of comfort foods. All hands are put to good use and somehow that makes the food more enjoyable. A fee of $20, payable to OLLI at the time of registration, covers the cost of the food.\n\nDebbie Halverson has been conducting OLLI cooking classes for several years. Unlike most of those classes, intended to improve cooking skills and learn new techniques, this one is not an academic venture but more comparable to a sauna experience or a warm coat.\n\n950 Special Events\n\n951 Astronomy and the Social Concept of Time\n\nTuesday, Jan. 21, 2:15–3:40\n\nReston\n\nInstructor: Jeffrey L. Kretsch\n\nToday we routinely look at our watch or a calendar to determine time and plan our activities. This course covers how time was once determined by the sun, moon and stars. Originally time was a very local thing determined by the positioning of the sun, and every town and city had its own time. With the rise of fast communication through telegraph and telephone, and fast travel by train, the issue arose as to whose time to use. Time became more central to our lives with the rise of the industrial revolution and the need to determine how long employees worked and were paid. The need for train schedules led to the implementation of standard time zones. We will discuss the early measurements of time based on the apparent motion of the sun over the year, the seasons, lunar and planetary cycles and the position of the stars. An optional night field observing session will also be included.\n\nJeffrey L. Kretsch, a retired federal employee, has a PhD from Purdue University and MS and BA degrees in astronomy and physics.\n\n952 Final Chapter? The Future of the Book\n\nWednesday, Jan. 22, 2:15–3:40\n\nTallwood\n\nCoordinator: Dr. Barry Berkey\n\nIn the beginning there was the word. Then the words were collected in a neat device known as the book. Now the word and books are transitioning into what? That’s the question Sam Clay will explore as he examines the book as a physical object and predicts its future development as a digital object. The talk will focus on the events that led to the creation of the book in its present form and argue that the definition of “book” is going through a radical change. Underlying this change is the assumption that words in a book have to be confined to a surface. As this is no longer the case, given ebook development, what does this change portend for the book?\n\nSam Clay has been director of the Fairfax County Public Library since 1982. For more than three decades, he has managed all aspects of this 23-branch system, which has a budget of over $24 million, over 400 employees and more than two million books and materials.\n\n953 Circle of Treason\n\nFriday, Jan. 24, 1:00–2:30\n\nTallwood\n\nCoordinator: Kathleen Price\n\nIn a brutally frank account of CIA traitor Aldrich Ames’s career, Sandy Grimes pulls back the curtain on the hunt for an American who spent years working for the KGB without being discovered. The author’s focus is on the CIA’s crucial Soviet and East European (SE) Division, where efforts to recruit officials snagged the United States’ highest-ranking Soviet spy, General Dmitriy Polyakov, who spent nearly two decades undetected. Ames’s treason did particular damage to the SE Division, leading to Polyakov’s execution and to the exposure of several other key U.S. agents. Espionage buffs will love the details taken from previously classified CIA files, as well as a penetrating view of Ames as an “all-American boy” and spy. Well-researched and written in a clear, no-frills style, the book presents a fascinating Cold War saga that will allow any American without a security clearance to better understand how Aldrich Ames could have become one of the most damaging moles in U.S. intelligence history. Lincoln Square Productions, a division of ABC News, is producing a limited series based on Circle of Treason.\n\nSandy Grimes retired after a long career as a CIA counterintelligence officer.\n\n954 What Makes Classical Music Funny?\n\nSaturday, Jan. 25, 10:00–12:30\n\nTallwood\n\nInstructor: Dan Sherman\n\nThere are many types of music that can put a smile on our face. As part of this course, we will listen to both orchestral and operatic music from the great composers (Haydn, Beethoven, Rossini, Wagner and Verdi) and discuss some of the methods by which composers add humor to music. The instructor will offer many examples of humor from the classical repertoire, including some little-known but very clever parodies.\n\nDan Sherman has previously taught OLLI courses on Wagner, Verdi and a number of theatrical composers, including Cole Porter.\n\n955 Genuine or Counterfeit? Become an Educated Consumer\n\nTuesday, Jan. 28, 2:15–3:40\n\nReston\n\nInstructor: David Safran\n\nHave you ever wondered how you could tell if a product is genuine or counterfeit? In this course you will learn what constitutes a trademark and the consequences of buying counterfeit products. You will be given an opportunity to distinguish counterfeit products from the real thing and will learn of the efforts being made to combat counterfeiting.\n\nDavid Safran is a partner in a local intellectual property law firm with over three decades of experience dealing with trademarks. He has assisted clients in fighting counterfeiting of their products.\n\n956 Once Upon a Time: With a Twist!\n\nWednesday, Jan. 29, 2:15–3:40\n\nTallwood\n\nCoordinator: Florence Adler\n\nGary Lloyd is a 15-year award-winning storyteller, two-term president of the Virginia Storytelling Association and recipient of the National Storytelling Network’s ORACLE award for the Mid-Atlantic states. He has told stories to over 880,000 listeners in hundreds of schools, libraries and festivals. For this session he will present his unique program of Amazing Escapes—six stories of survival events where you vote at the end of each as to whether it really happened or not! Lloyd will then take questions and offer tips on the storytelling process.\n\n957 The Role of Physical Therapy in Preventing and Treating Osteoporosis\n\nFriday, Jan. 31, 1:00–2:30\n\nTallwood\n\nCoordinator: Dr. Barry Berkey\n\nStatistics show that approximately nine million Americans have osteoporosis and an estimated 48 million have low bone density. Studies also suggest that one in two women and one in four men age 50 and older will break a bone due to osteoporosis. This informative presentation by Charles Ottavio will teach you basic information about preventing and treating osteoporosis. Through a multi-step approach you will learn what you can do to minimize the effects of this debilitating disease.\n\nCharles S. Ottavio earned his BS in physical therapy in 1981. He has specialized in orthopedics for the past 30 years and has practiced in a variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and home health. He is currently the practice manager at Orthopedic Physical Therapy of Northern Virginia.\n\n958 Field Trip to Observatory Park\n\nFriday, Jan. 31, 7:30–10:00 pm\n\nCarpool to 925 Springvale Road, Great Falls, VA\n\nCoordinator: Mary Kornreich\n\nAnalemma Society, in conjunction with Northern Virginia Astronomy Club volunteers, conducts Friday night observing sessions from 7:30 to 10:00. Our group will join others to enjoy the session, starting with an introduction to the night sky, pointing out major constellations, the planets and deep sky objects. Included are a description of the daily motions of the celestial sphere and the changes of the seasons. When the moon is visible, a close look at its geological surface features is provided. A wide range of deep sky objects, including galaxies, nebula and star clusters, can be seen in telescopes set up on the site. The passage of earth-orbiting satellites is observed as the opportunity arises. Programs that include a description of the night’s viewing will be available. This is an outdoor event, so please dress appropriately. If this session is cancelled due to inclement weather, we will try again on February 21.\n\n959 The Sinai Peninsula\n\nMonday, Feb. 3, 11:50–1:15\n\nLoudoun\n\nInstructor: Mark Sweberg\n\nWhen anyone mentions the Middle East people think of Israel, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia or any number of other countries. The Sinai Peninsula rarely comes to mind. Yet for centuries the Sinai was the footbridge between Africa and both Europe and Asia. In this course we will talk about the role the Sinai has played through history and its more recent role separating Israel and Egypt. We will discuss the Sinai as a battlefield and as a place of biblical destiny. The instructor will share his personal experiences in the Sinai in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and will describe how its environment has changed.\n\nMark Sweberg is a retired U.S. Army officer and Middle East Foreign Area specialist. He has served as a military peacekeeper and chief operations officer of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Sinai, and as a civilian peacekeeper and chief of protocol in the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping mission, also in the Sinai. He has a BS in engineering from the U.S. Military Academy, an MA in international relations from the University of Southern California and an MBA in international business from the University of Puget Sound.\n\n960 Yoga for Boomers and Beyond\n\nTuesday, Feb. 4, 2:15–3:40\n\nReston\n\nInstructor: Bonnie Elliot\n\n“If you can breathe, you can do yoga,” Krishnamacharya used to say. Yoga has been around for thousands of years and its benefits, such as decreased stress, improved sleep and enhanced well-being, have been increasingly proven through evidence-based research. In this presentation, we will discuss how yoga can help seniors gain vitality and a greater sense of peace and purpose. The instructor will guide you through the experience of breathing and movement that are designed for everybody, especially those with chronic health challenges such as high blood pressure, bone and joint conditions, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and autoimmune or movement disorders. Wear comfortable clothing for gentle movement that can be done seated or standing.\n\nBonnie Elliott is a registered yoga teacher with extensive training in therapeutic yoga that meets the unique needs of the aging body and mind.She has practiced yoga for more than 10 years and taught for over three years.\n\n961 What Makes Us Laugh, and Why?\n\nFriday, Feb. 7, 1:00–2:30\n\nTallwood\n\nInstructor: Mike McNamara\n\nHearing a funny story, a joke, seeing something odd or just plain silly usually results in laughter. Why? What is it that makes us laugh, a function apparently limited to our species (with the possible exception of hyenas and politicians)? Why do TV networks employ “canned laughter”? What’s the anatomy of jokes or humorous stories, and why do people tell them? Why can’t the average person remember a screamingly funny joke or punch line? Laughter is unarguably good for us, mentally and physically, and in this lecture we will present some guaranteed, mostly wholesome examples that will make you laugh. Or else.\n\nMike McNamara, a retired U.S. Army infantry colonel, holds an MA in English literature and an equivalent degree from the Royal College of Defense Studies in London. He is a co-moderator of the Poetry Workshop at Tallwood and also tells reasonably good stories and bad jokes.\n\n962 Muffin Mania\n\nFriday, Feb. 7, 10:00\n\nLoudoun\n\nCoordinator: Mary Coyne\n\nMimi’s Cafe will furnish six different varieties of muffins, along with coffee.
