As Tan Lin has stated in his studies on paratexts, “Can literature resemble a cookbook or a Powerpoint lecture”. Elsaesser might add to this by asking, can film resemble a text message you are notified about throughout the day which causes both anxiety and desire? Can film resemble the rush of direct sensation that meditation brings awareness to?
