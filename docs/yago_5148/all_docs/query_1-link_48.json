        "text": "When Joan Didion died the day before Christmas Eve last year, I had just turned in my grades after another rough pandemic semester teaching writing. Despite the many obstacles and distractions, the upper-level creative nonfiction class was particularly successful. As I read student portfolios of memoir pieces and essays that worked from writing models, I was reminded again how Joan Didion had provided models for the forms in which we were writing, which I continue to find to be miraculous.\n\nI say miraculous because my classes, by and large, are composed of first generation students, many still firmly inside their family’s belief systems. These are students who will go on to work as elementary and high school teachers, as New York State employees, and as nonprofit administrators. These are not students who, like Didion, worked at Vogue, lived in a doorman building in the East 70s, or posed for Time magazine photographer in front of a Corvette in a long-sleeve t-shirt dress. Since her passing, there have been plenty of essays and Twitter threads that cover Didion’s so-called privilege, and that is a needed reassessment. But what is miraculous about great writing is its alterity, its ability to translate across time, across demographics.\n\nIn our upper-level creative nonfiction classes, one of the culminating assignments is something I call “Make Your Own ‘White Album’.” There are lots of moving parts to this assignment, and it covers a good chunk of any given semester. It involves the class reading Didion’s “The White Album,” watching a YouTube playlist to deepen our sense of the many cultural references in the essay, and writing our own version of “The White Album” using our own lives. The results are almost always successful and often amazing. The assignment was included in the Now Write! Nonfiction, published in 2009 if anyone wants to check it out.\n\nAnother Didion essay I bring into just about every class is “Goodbye To All That,” Didion’s 1967 essay about leaving New York City. I don’t assign per se; instead, I put it up on the projector and I tell the story of how, when I was writing my own essay about leaving New York City, I obsessed over this Didion essay for years. I wanted to know what made it successful, how it seemed to be universal and specific at the same time. So I broke it down, sentence by sentence, often diagramming the more important sentences on the board. It’s all a bit of professor theater, of course. The larger point is to model the kind of slow reading and re-reading that gets lost in classes where hundreds of pages need to be covered each week.\n\nWhat I show on the projector isn’t just the essay. It’s the essay, pasted into Word and color-coded according to writer Aldous Huxley’s idea of the essay’s “three-poled frame of reference,” which he describes in the preface to his Collected Essays, published in 1960. I first encountered this idea in The Essay: Theory and Pedagogy for an Active Form, Paul Heilker’s 1996 study published by the National Council of Teachers of English. Sitting in a chapter on “Twentieth-Century Theories of the Essay” beside heady sections on Adorno and Lukács is a gloss over a rather straightforward, and eminently teachable, idea about essays. Here’s the Huxley passage:\n\nEssays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference. There is the pole of the personal and the autobiographical; there is the pole of the objective, the factual, the concrete-particular; and there is the pole of the abstract-universal. Most essayists are at home and at their best in the neighborhood of only one of the essay’s three poles, or at the most only in the neighborhood of two of them.\n\nThe most richly satisfying essays are those which make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist. Freely, effortlessly, thought and feeling move in these consummate works of art, hither and thither between the essay’s three poles—from the personal to the universal, from the abstract back to the concrete, from the objective datum to the inner experience.\n\nFor anyone in need of a clear-eyed theory of what makes essays tick, I recommend the entire preface. Huxley’s description of “predominantly personal essayists” is especially useful when trying to distinguish among essay, memoir, personal essay, which is a question that comes up quite often in a survey of different nonfiction modes. That Huxley includes the “predominantly objective essayists who do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme” is also useful for students who wonder just what it is they are writing in many of their “non-creative” writing classes. Huxley says that “[t]heir art consists in setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from, the relevant data.” Including the objective essayist is also especially helpful for any creative writing instructor who stresses the need for outer data, for research to be placed into the mix—something many creative writing students dread or dismiss or both. When Huxley covers the “personal-autobiographical,” we talk about how in so much creative nonfiction we dig into our personal histories and material and craft them into true stories. And then we get to what to my mind is the hardest part to teach, the “abstract-universal.” “And how splendid, how truly oracular are the utterances of the great generalizers!” Huxley writes of the essays who lean abstract-universal, quoting Francis Bacon, Ralph Walso Emerson, Baltasar Gracian, and others.\n\nIt’s in an upper-lever creative nonfiction course where we might talk about Vivian Gornick’s ideas of situation and story, and how it’s important to spell out our own wisdom, and how sometimes we will teach readers why a certain personal story might be useful or enriching. We can do that not so much by hand-holding or “telling,” by just speaking our wisdom, our truths. In a composition course or a 200-level writing class, it’s more about modeling ways of deep reading, or reading as writers, as opposed to as scholars or a casual reader.\n\nI also confess to my students that I am a total triangle freak. I have a slide show called “Triangles, Triangles Triangles” that includes rhetoric’s “ethos/logos/pathos,” the composition studies triad of “say/mean/matter” as well as Goldilocks and the Three Bears and comedy writing’s trinity of set-up- build-up, and punchline. Student reactions range from “wow, that’s very intense” to “I’m so glad to see someone else so obsessive over something they love” (both are actual quotes from a recent semester’s online discussion board).\n\n​What I found about “Goodbye to All That” was that Didion’s essay is that rare essay specimen that includes all three of Huxley’s poles—the personal-autobiographical; the objective, factual, and concrete-particular; and the abstract-universal. And I discovered this, as many obsessive nerds do, with our tools of the trade: colored highlighter markers. Re-typing Didion's essay into Word, I then set up a color-code for Huxley’s poles: yellow for “personal and autobiographical”; purple for “objective, factual, concrete-particular”; and green for “abstract-universal.”\n\nWhat I learned runs counter to a lot of what we are taught in the classroom about what makes an effective paragraph. Begin right off the bat with something completely general, as Didion does, with “It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and hard to see the ends”? Sprinkle factual nuggets and nest them mid-paragraph, like veins of an arm, as Didion does? And what is it about Didion’s writing that leans heavily personal, in my reading yellowed with autobiographical details, and yet I come out of it feeling like I have learned something about being human and leaving a place like New York? It’s the balancing act on those three poles that makes this essay work. What I draw from this essay isn’t that Didion lived a completely glamorous lifestyle in New York and went to fabulous parties—although, to be honest, that does holds my interest. It’s that Didion has learned something about life and New York, “a city only for the very young.”"
