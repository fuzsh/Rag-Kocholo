        "text": "Mr. Schiffer goes the extra mile. He responded quickly to a question and went above and beyond to improve my son's knowledge. He really cares about education. He is appreciated! - East Middle School Parent\n\nI love Mrs. Ross because I love her so much and she’s so nice. -4K Student\n\nI love Mrs. Di Vilio because she is so nice to me! - 4K Student\n\nMy freshman really loves having (Ms. Tyrcha) as a teacher!! He frequently comes home and tells me funny stories of things that have happened in class or ways that you have connected with him. Last night as he was struggling with binomials and quadratic equations- and my brain just couldn't even understand what he was trying to figure out (I may need a Algebra 1 brush up)- he felt confident in going in and asking questions. You have made him feel safe to not know an answer, but also responsible for seeking help to find it. That is difficult to do with a teen- so I am very grateful that you are that person for him! - NGC Parent\n\nMs. E is so nice. She plans fun stuff to do with us. I love kindergarten! - Carollton Student\n\nMs. Reuteman is new to Deerfield this year, but she's made such an impact on our kiddo. My daughter has adored her class. She has a great teacher and role model this year. We are so grateful! - Deerfield Parent\n\nMs. Maultra is an amazing teacher and I'm so glad I had her this school year! - East Middle School Student\n\nI am so impressed with Mrs. Mann as a young teacher. She handled our parent teacher conferences perfectly, she is easy to communicate with, and our daughter has loved her as a teacher. Teaching is EXCEPTIONALLY hard right now, and I am so grateful that we have young people doing the job well. Thank you! - Meadowview Parent\n\nMs. Kubicek always makes students feel welcome and helps us the best she can, even though math is really hard sometimes. She never gives up on students or makes them feel dumb for not understanding. She lets us in on her outside of school life, will talk about her dog and why she is absent sometimes, allowing us to feel like more than just a student, but a friend as well. She also supports students mental health and is there for you when you need her to be. More than just a good teacher, but also an amazing person to be around. Makes math fun and rewarding as well. - OCHS Student\n\nI truly enjoyed working with such a dedicated staff and caring principal. Thank you! -Former Carollton Teacher (retired)\n\nMr Pontus is the kind of principal that just stands out. He loves his job and it shows. Having a kiddo that requires extra or special attention. It’s hard enough, but when the staff make them feel like they’re one in a million- THAT is what makes them special. Mr Pontus does just that. His adept knowledge of how to read kiddos and evaluate situations is just unmatched and we are so thankful for everything he does. - Forest Ridge Staff Member\n\nShout out to Senor Grochowski for always supporting my son, Brody. Spanish is not an easy subject to learn, but with this teacher's patience, my son has picked up the subject matter with much more ease! Thank you for all you do to support my son in the classroom! Muchas Gracias Sr. Grochowski! - East Middle School Parent\n\nThank you so much to Ms. Benfield for her continuous support of my son! Really appreciate her efforts throughout the long school year! - East Middle School Parent\n\nMr. Fassbender has a gift of being able to connect with the students as a respected leader and mentor. I have seen the positive influence he makes on students and volleyball players. He encourages and challenges students to learn and improve. High School students (my daughter included) return to West just to talk to him. That shows a lasting impact. I feel very fortunate that both of my children have been blessed with him as a teacher. And I am thankful that Megan had Mr. Fassbender as a volleyball coach; he set the bar high for all school and club coaches to live up to. Mr. Fassbender, thank you! - West Middle School Parent\n\nI'd like to shout out Katie Bartelme from West Middle School. She is the Director of the West Theater program. This weekend she put together an amazing show with many talented kids from West. I can't imagine the countless hours and hard work required to put this together! As a parent, I am so grateful that she is so dedicated to the arts, running the only OC middle school theater program! Thank you, Ms. Bartelme, for your hard work, commitment to these kids, and dedication to keeping the arts alive in OC. - West Middle School Parent\n\nI would like to recognize Steve Agg and his amazing automobile students. I took my car in for a few repairs and within a few days the car was back and driving like a brand new vehicle. I think this program is a great way for students looking to enter that field after they complete their high school experience at Oak Creek. Thank you for a job well done. - OCHS Parent\n\nMr. Schiffer always has a smile on his face, and has funny jokes to share to all of his students. He engages his students to learn in a very fun way, and overall my favorite teacher in the school. He inspires every student every day. - EMS Student\n\nThank you to Ms. Zemlicka, Ms. Thiry, Ms. Dian & the entire K5 special ed team at Forest Ridge elementary school for always being so helpful, responsive, and truly invested in my son's everyday success in academics and daily living skills. Really appreciate and value it. Thanks for being a part of his education and exciting learning journey. - Forest Ridge Parent\n\nI would like to commend Ms. Kristen Honore on her work with my band student at Empower. When many of us are looking forward to the weekend, Ms. Honore is hard at work all day at Solo and Ensemble. Her dedication and sense of humor with middle school students is unparalleled. Coming from a parent who knows nothing about music, I appreciate her ability to assist my daughter in preparing for the performance today. When I asked my daughter to tell me something about Ms. Honore, she said, \"She's the kind of band teacher I want to be.\"\n\nThank you, Ms. Honore, for the time, talent, inspiration, and excitement you bring to your job; it does not go unnoticed! - Empower Academy Parent\n\nHuge shout out to all the staff at Carollton in keeping the kids safe and calm during the power outage. As a parent I feel relieved and comforted to know that my child was safe. Managing the situation could not have been easy but none of that was felt by my son which is a huge accomplishment for the staff. Great job! - Carollton Parent\n\nMr. Fassbender was always my favorite teacher all during middle school (25 years ago). - Former West Middle School Student\n\nShe is very kind and when I am sad or mad she comes in the room and she makes me smile every time her and mrs kaiser are my two favorite teachers she gives us lots of compliments in just one day so thank you so much mrs p! - Shepard Hills Student\n\nI am a student of Mrs. Kaiser class and I love being in her class she is aways nice to everyone and she never needs to yell. She helps everyone in my class and helps everyone understand how to solve a problem. She also made us bags with our names on them for Christmas. And I just love being in her class. - Shepard Hills Student\n\nI am a student in Mrs. Kaiser's class. She is very understanding when I get stressed out in math she helps me learn different strategies to be successful. She is always very kind to everyone in the class and doesn't yell to get our attention. She even has past students line up outside her door to say hello. When I was a new student to Shepard Hills I was scared but she welcomed me and made me feel comfortable. At Christmas time she made a gift for the entire class. She is one of the best teachers in the world. I want to say thank you to Mrs. Kaiser! - Shepard Hills Student\n\nThank you to all our custodians, especially the ones that take the time to shine up the cafeterias after our kids at lunch time!! (Oh, if kids were graded on lunch!) We appreciate all you do and your work to keep our schools clean! - EMS Staff member\n\nMs. Meyle has been extremely supportive to my son and our family. She is someone my son feels comfortable talking to and asking for help from. She pushes him to do his best and is always finding ways to help him be successful in her classroom. She goes above and beyond to form bonds with her students and is tuned in to their needs. We are so grateful for you!!! - EMS Family\n\nMs. Ceaglske has been such an amazing teacher to my daughter so far! Paisleigh RAVES about how she loves her teacher everyday. After leaving a toxic school, we were extremely worried. This was hands down the best decision we've ever made for Paisleigh!!! - Carollton Family\n\nMs. Pulford is my favorite teacher! - EMS Student\n\nMs. Edminster, Thank you for being such a great teacher to our kiddo. You are so patient and kind. We appreciate all you do!! - Carollton Parent\n\nMrs. Di Vilio, Thank you for being so amazing and kind to our kids. You are seriously the best!! You made this transition to 4K so easy. We appreciate you! - 4K Parent\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with such a hard working and dedicated staff. - Former Carollton Teacher\n\nMs. Quillin sets up stuff that is fun to do! - OCHS Student\n\nThank you to Mr. Grams for always being so responsive and truly invested in student success. It is much appreciated. - OCHS Parent\n\nMs. Dorlack was the best elementary teacher I had. Keep helping kids. - Carollton Student\n\nKim Schoen is GREAT to work with! She is working hard to inventory our student resources at Edgewood and to make sure the students there have everything they need. She has been a wonderful teammate in this process! - OCFSD Employee\n\nMy daughter will be attending Carollton this fall as a transfer from another district. Mrs. Hanney has been so helpful and reassuring to me as a mom! She is helping to ensure that my daughter is starting the school year with her best foot forward. I know my daughter will soar with adults like Ms. Hanney helping her get her wings. Thank you for your endless dedication to the students in your care! -Carollton Elementary School Parent\n\nMy daughter goes to summer school at forest ridge. Every morning, I walk her into class. Earlier in this week, I saw a little girl sitting outside of a classroom, right off the main hallway. She was obviously upset, sad, etc. Just obviously not happy, and still so young. New things are rough, so I wasn’t too surprised to see it. Her teacher was with her, and another man approached them. The teacher said this was (didn’t hear the child’s name) but saw that the man approaching them was clearly an administrator type of role. He seemed to be coming over to take over for the teacher in caring for the little girl. I recognized him as the man I’ve seen at the front door multiple mornings now, greeting everyone as they came in each day. I kept walking to leave after dropping my daughter off, but saw him take a seat on a chair, and the little girl stood up and walked over to him as I was walking out. That was earlier this week. I didn’t think anything of it, until today. I saw the same little girl, sitting on the floor of the main hallway, with the same person sitting WITH her. And when I say WITH her, I mean he was literally on the floor, sitting WITH her. I recognized them both immediately from the other day, and I was almost brought to tears when I realized what he was doing. How he was trying to make her feel comfortable, trying to be there for her, on her same level. Literally. My daughter is entering first grade in OCFSD this year. She went to a private school last year due to Covid and all the craziness that ensued with being closed and open. I wasn’t 100% sold on going back to registering her for our public schools again, until I saw this today. Wow. If this is the type of teachers/administrators that OCFSD has, then we are proud to be back in our district! - Forest Ridge Elementary Summer School Parent\n\nMrs. Vance was always here for me and for everyone in my class she was always nice to me. When I was in elementary school all of my teachers were nice but not as nice as Mrs. Vance - East Middle School Student\n\nMrs. Jean goes above and beyond when it comes to keeping my son on track and making sure he is working to the best of his abilities. Even through Covid and online learning, she always goes the extra mile to make herself available to the students for extra help and make sure they are keeping on track. Thank you Mrs. Jean for the great job you do in teaching Math and making these kids successful! - East Middle School Parent\n\nI would like to give Mr. Marzion a shout out because he makes class enjoyable, likes to have fun, is great at his job and helps us when we need and makes it easily understandable. - East Middle School Student\n\nI would like to recognize Mrs. Stein because she is always so nice and caring. She is like a mom at school. - East Middle School Student\n\nMrs. Ellifson is my child's K4 teacher. She has been amazing. Miss E had been blessed with abundant of creativity. Miss E makes all the seasons very fun with imagination at Christmas she hosted a Christmas virtual Christmas story time it was In the evening all the kids could where pajamas and eat cookies while listening to stories Santa clause showed up all the kids loved this. She also got all her kids a book , a snack and rain deer food. During virtual time she had always smiled at her kids. She adores her students and loves teaching. Mrs. Torres completes her - they are the perfect team. - Cedar Hills Elementary School Parent\n\nMy daughter loves going to school everyday. My husband and I would like to thank the following staff. Our daughter says how much she learns from Mrs. Castro, Kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Henneberry, Speech Pathologist, Ms. Bagatta, Art teacher, and Ms Barczak, Music teacher. She talks about different content she has learned, but also your love and kindness. Our daughter developed a medical condition. Thank you Ms. Lindsay Packer, Secretary, for taking our phone calls and helping us with paperwork. Lastly, we would like to thank the staff in food services. Our daughter enjoys lunch everyday. Thank you to everyone for pouring your love and kindness into our daughter and other students as well. - Edgewood Elementary School Parent\n\nMy husband and I are so grateful for Mrs. Behnke, Special Education Teacher, Ms. Tina Krimmer, Occupational Therapist, and Ms Tracy Stouffer, Speech Pathologist. Our daughter was diagnosed with autism and this amazing staff worked with her two years. She loves going to school and has grown so much. Thank you for your knowledge, skills, love, kindness, and compassion! - Deerfield Elementary School Parent\n\nTo Mrs. V, Mrs. Sorrel, Tina, Tracy and Mrs Behnke! This group of ladies are absolutely amazing! They have helped my son so much in the nearly three years he’s been in the EC program. We absolutely love having them as his educators! They love our son, and he loves them. - Deerfield Elementary Parent\n\nMrs. Duerkop is a blessing for first grade teaching. My son struggles with emotions and getting frustrated easily, but Mrs. Duerkop was able to recognize it (even virtually) so that she could help him in the way he needed. He loves going to her class everyday and I know it's because of the relationship she has with her students. Thank you for everything you do day in and day out. It makes a difference in so many ways and doesn't go unnoticed! #ThankYou #Mrs.DuerkopRocks - Carollton Elementary School Parent\n\nI wanted to take a moment to \"shout out\" Mrs. Daniels. My daughter struggles sometimes with shouting out, staying on track & keeping focus. Mrs. Daniels holds her accountable, gives her goals and challenges her in the ways she needs. Her structured approach and clear lines of communication make a big difference for my daughter! She's a teacher that truly cares about her students and it shows up in a big way. I'm blessed she was my daughter's teacher this year & will keep my fingers crossed my son gets her too! #OneOfAKind #WeNeedMoreMrs.Daniel's! - Carollton Elementary School Parent\n\nThis is a shout-out to Dani Palm, Steve Anderson, Chris Bennin, Lana Zimmerman, all the OC Virtual teachers, van drivers, IT support who worked on any of the moving parts to have students come into the Oak Creek Community Center for Forward Exam testing. The end result made it look easy, but I know a lot of work went into the organization and planning. - OCFSD Staff Member\n\nI just want to say how amazing Ms. Dorlack is. She has been such a blessing for Dean this year. Even virtually, she managed to keep him engaged and (mostly) on task which isn't easy even in person. Anyone who knows Dean knows how, let's say, spirited and free thinking he is. Ms. Dorlack has managed to connect with him in a way not many have been able to do. We've been very lucky with most of his teachers during his school career and we are definitely blessed to have had Ms. Dorlack added to that list. Thank you for taking the time to really \"get\" Dean. We appreciate everything you do for him. - Carollton Elementary School Parent\n\nThis is long overdue, but Patty Lee is always a help when it comes to answering my questions in regards to purchasing. She keeps me in the loop and works with me until the things are resolved. Thank you Patty for all you do! I also want to thank Josh Dewsenberry for all your help with Skyward. Don't know what we'd do without you! - OCFSD Staff Member\n\nI would love to give a shout out to the entire Meadowview Elementary staff! They have been rockstars throughout virtual learning and are truly giving 110% since the students have returned to school in-person. Besides being stellar educators and dedicated support staff members, they have done such a great job of implementing and enforcing the safety standards/mitigating procedures and have done so with compassion and care. My child was hesitant to return to in-person learning, but the staff has done such a good job to make the students feel welcome, safe, comfortable, and cared for. I'm especially impressed with the care that goes into getting every child to their parent safely at dismissal time, even in sub-zero temps. We are so lucky to have this school of amazingly dedicated people in our district! -Meadowview Elementary Parent\n\nVirtual snow day and Ms. Danko still has students engaged and learning! AWESOME! - Meadowview Elementary Parent\n\nMrs. Ashenhurst is so kind and patient whether it be virtual or in person learning. We hear her while teaching virtual and she takes the time to listen to all her students and makes sure they all understand the lessons being taught. She also allows time for the students to connect with one another. That is a huge part missing while in virtual learning and Mrs. Ashenhurst brings her students together and they all seem excited to learn with her! Thank you for going that extra mile with your students and connecting with them. - East Middle School Parent\n\nWe are beyond grateful that our daughter has been in Mrs. Asala's class this year! She was wonderful for our oldest son a few years back but has really gone above and beyond her teaching duties this year with all of the challenges presented to our teachers. She is patient, caring and so dedicated to her students and families. We have no doubt how much she cares about our daughter and her education and she has made multiple efforts to get on office hours calls with her or drop off materials at our home to facilitate her learning! She communicates regularly with all the families but goes beyond that reaching out to us directly to make sure things are OK. We are so lucky to have her supporting us this last year of our daughter's elementary education! -Deerfield Elementary Parent\n\nMy son has been lucky enough to have Mrs. Wallin for a teacher for two classes and I cannot say enough good things about her. Quite simply, she is THE BEST! She is so dedicated to the students, making sure that they are understanding difficult scientific concepts, giving opportunities to ask questions and always supporting their learning. She easily connects with them as individuals (which is a task in itself with teenagers!) and truly cares about their well-being, especially during the virtual learning. Mrs. Wallin is always available for extra help, usually at the student's convenience. As a parent, I really appreciate her weekly update emails letting us know what the students are working on, what assignments/tests are coming up and a reminder of a longstanding offer to help out with ANY support the students need (with assignments AND social issues/mental health). She's the best high school teacher we could ask for, and I only hope my youngest child will also get to have Mrs. Wallin for his classes when he reaches OCHS! - Oak Creek High School Parent\n\nTeachers have been so patient with Abi and motivating. They are all amazing! Food service has gone above and beyond! Kelly, Sarah, and Ms. Korban are saving my Abi's life. - Oak Creek High School Parent\n\nMrs. Rad always takes the time to listen and help anyone in need. My son asked me to set up time with her during virtual learning and she made it work. They met virtually on a weekly basis and now continue as they are in person. I am so glad my son feels comfortable enough to talk to Mrs. Rad about whatever he is feeling. She is a life saver! - Meadowview Elementary Parent\n\nThank you to Mr. Bernard Carreon for always going above and beyond to help advocate for my son. It is very evident how much you care about your students and it is very much appreciated. Your are one of the best! - Oak Creek High School Parent\n\nMrs. Dorlack has been doing an amazing job keeping her class interacting and learning new lessons virtually! She is patient, kind and so helpful all through the computer screen letting each student know they are not alone while she acknowledges every question and comment and keeping everyone on task! Thank you Mrs. Dorlack for keeping virtual learning fun and the students so engaged! You are a wonderful addition to our Carollton family and my 4th grader is so proud to be your student! - Carollton Parent\n\nA huge shout out to Mr. Schiffer for making science virtually fun for his 6th graders! It's great to see my kids smiling and laughing as they are learning! My kids enjoy his lessons and I can't thank him enough for the time he takes to let our kids know they \"matter\" ! Keep doing what your doing Mr. Schiffer and making a difference in our family (and others) with all of your virtual lessons! - EMS Parent\n\nMrs. Duerkop was incredibly patient and understanding when my son and multiple other students had internet issues while trying to complete a 1st grade math test during virtual school. - Carollton Parent\n\nI would like to recognize Ms. Hunt for being such a dedicated teacher. This has been such a difficult time of adjustment for not only students, but also teachers and there is never a moment where I don't feel supported in her class. I know there is always offers for extra help and thorough teaching of all materials given! - OCHS Student\n\nI just would like to thank Mr. Kenwood for all the many things that he does to support the students and families at Carollton. He does a wonderful job connecting with the students, from greeting them with a big smile at morning drop off, to sending morning announcements out through remote learning and always taking the time to listen to them. I appreciate all that he does to help families stay informed of what is going on. I feel like before I can ask a question he has already posted a Dojo message with the answer. I know all the extra work you are putting in this year and I truly appreciate all you do. Carollton is lucky to have you! - Carollton Parent\n\nMs. Schmidt. Thank you for going above and beyond to support our son as he recovers from an injury! The care, compassion and understanding you are showing him is truly AMAZING! We fell so extremely grateful that you are his teacher! Thank you!!! - Forest Ridge Parent\n\nMrs. Arens, thank you for taking your time tonight to answer my many questions; for caring about our student and for reassuring me of her safety! I appreciate the great job you are doing leading OC West and am grateful for your care and concern! - WMS Parent\n\nMr. Pontus is amazing. He always looks out for students and has time for students and parents. Thank you Forest Ridge is a great school. The staff is great. - Forest Ridge Parent\n\nOur family is giving Ms Barlow a shout out for doing a great job with our daughter. She loves going to school every day and you did a lot for her thank you so much. - Forest Ridge Family\n\nWhat AMAZING teachers we have that we are so very thankful for! As virtual learning continues to present challenges, Ms. Barriere and Ms. McCaigue have been able to identify these issues immediately and intervene in real time. This week was especially rough for us and Ms. Barriere immediately reached out to setup an additional meet for our daughter with herself, Mr. Bersch and her teacher from last year, Ms. Barker. It immediately put a smile on her face to not focus on the challenges she was experiencing with virtual learning, but rather talk to them as if she was just seeing them at school. We are so very appreciative to all of them for the extra time they have given to provide some normalcy in extremely unnormal times. - Shepard Hills Parent\n\nSue Thompson is a true team player pitching in wherever she is needed! And a huge shout out to the teachers for being so quick and helpful in their responses to us parents on the first day of school!! Even going so far as giving a call to say, \"Hi and how did the first day go?\" Also to the patient office team fielding all the calls - Way to go EMS staff!! - EMS Parent\n\nMs. Haslbeck is such a sweet and caring teacher. Our son struggles with school but working one on one with her allows him to relax and learn. Ms. Haslbeck takes the time to encourage students and she makes each student feel important. She goes out of her way to look for ideas that might help her students that are struggling. We are so thankful to have Ms. Haslbeck as our son's special education teacher! She is a blessing and no words can express how much we appreciate everything she has done for him. - Meadowview Parent\n\nMs. Kasar has worked so hard to help the special education students at Carollton both during the Covid closure in spring and now during the virtual start. She is such a kind, caring teacher. - Carollton Parent\n\nMrs. Wisnewski did a good job at teaching virtually. Mrs. Wisnewski's stellar communication skills helped this year get off to a great start. Thanks for everything! - Forest Ridge Parent & Student\n\nMrs. Hennessy has such a user friendly google classroom and made all students feel welcome. It was a great first day! Thanks Mrs. Hennessy! - Carollton Parent\n\nDay one of virtual learning was so organized! The teachers did a great job. My child easily got online and was engaged during her class. Thanks for all the work you have put in to make it a successful first day. - WMS Parent\n\nFirst day of school and the first day of virtual learning went off without a hitch for my daughter. She was very reluctant to start the year like last year ended...virtually. The start of the school year already shows better results for my daughter. She liked that there was a teacher giving the lesson/expectations for virtual learning. Also liked that, for the most part, she could see the other students in her classes and interact with them and the teacher. - Oak Creek High School Parent\n\nThank you so much Ms. Wroblewski for making the first day of virtual kindergarten so smooth! You did an amazing job of engaging the kids and keeping the parents involved and informed. We were so anxious as to how \"virtual kindergarten\" was going to go, and I can already tell this will be a great start to this year. We're ready to roll with the punches and we have your back during this crazy journey. Thank you! - Edgewood Parent\n\nEast Middle School Admin Team. Thank you for all of your assistance with getting prepared for school this year. From a broken chromebook, to a missing workbook you guys did everything in your power to make sure we had a great first day. THANK YOU!!!!!!!! - East Middle School Parent\n\nMrs. Rutter. Where do we begin? She is AMAZING!! She is so engaging, inviting, genuinely caring and enthusiastic. We appreciate all she does and is doing to make all of her students feel important and heard/seen. We love her! Thank YOU!! - Meadowview Parent\n\nMs. Biedenbender is by far the best teacher ever in my experience. Such a nice and helpful teacher. I was a 5th grade student in her class also a school ambassador, some of the students at school would sometimes make me feel unwelcome. But i would always go to school knowing that my teacher was Ms biedenbender. Not only did she help me with school, but with grief that I had over the death of my father. Ms b, if you see this I mean this 100% And thanks for being my teacher. I HOPE ANY FUTURE 5th GRADERS GO TO YOUR CLASS!!! - Forest Ridge Student"
