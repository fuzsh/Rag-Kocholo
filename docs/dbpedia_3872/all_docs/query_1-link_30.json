This document provides a review of the revised edition of Lionel Casson's book \"Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt\". The reviewer notes some updates that have been made to the revised edition, including new material on medicine, copper and tin sources, and the Amarna period. However, the reviewer also points out some claims made by Casson that require clarification or modification in light of more recent evidence, such as around Hatshepsut's reign, female roles and rights in ancient Egypt, and the relationship between magic and medicine. The review evaluates both the positive updates and areas where Casson's assertions could be strengthened.",
