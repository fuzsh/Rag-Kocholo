        "text": "December 15, 2019\n\nLucian of Samosata is one of my absolute favorite classical authors. The renowned English writer Henry Fielding once called Lucian \"almost... like the true father of humour\" and I almost agree with that assessment. If not the \"true father of humor,\" I think I would feel comfortable calling Lucian the \"true father of satire.\" Lucian may have died in the late second century AD, but his works are never out of date. As long as there are people who believe in foolishness and other people who love to laugh at that foolishness, Lucian will remain perpetually relevant.\n\nLucian is the kind of author who is just genuinely enjoyable to read, even for ordinary people who are not classics scholars. Unlike so many other classical humorists, Lucian is only occasionally obscene or crude. Aristophanes might often rely upon fart jokes and sex to make his audiences laugh, but Lucian normally relies upon pure, distilled wit. As Casson notes in his introduction, Lucian is no great philosopher; you will find no exhaustive philosophical arguments from him. Nevertheless, as a satirist, he is virtually unrivalled. He may not be especially wise, but he is extraordinarily clever.\n\nLucian calls out malarkey whenever he sees it and he spares no one from his biting sarcasm. A perennial skeptic, Lucian routinely mocks popular superstitions and new religious movements (including Christianity), but he carries his skeptical inclinations even further; Lucian even dares to ridicule many traditional Greek beliefs about the gods. His Dialogues of the Gods (included in this volume), for instance, is a satire exposing the inherent absurdities of Greek mythology.\n\nSince Lucian's work is so brilliant, it is unfortunate that so many modern English translations of Lucian's writings are truly terrible. A. M. Harmon's 1913 translation for the Loeb Classical Library is dense and archaic, barely readable. H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler's 1905 translation of all Lucian's works writings is a little better. Lionel Casson's translation, however, is the best of all the translations I have read. Casson's translation is written in engaging and thoroughly readable mid-twentieth-century English, rather than the ponderous and archaizing English of so many earlier translations.\n\nOne disappointment I had with this book is that Casson does not include all of Lucian's extant works and he actually leaves out a few of Lucian's most famous works. Notable omissions from this volume include classics such as The Lover of Lies, On the Syrian Goddess, and How to Write History. Nevertheless, Casson has managed to include most of Lucian's most iconic works.\n\nMy other disappointment is the fact that Casson's introduction and notes are a bit outdated. For instance, Casson treats much of what Lucian says in his writings as autobiographical, but modern scholars have come to seriously question the supposed autobiographical nature of works such as The Dream. Casson also does not talk much about how Lucian's identity as a Syrian who had adopted Greek culture and language may have influenced his writings; whereas this has become a major subject of study in recent years.\n\nOverall, though, Selected Satires of Lucian is an excellent work and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in ancient literature.\n\nFebruary 28, 2012\n\nExcellent selection and translation of a delightful ancient author. Lucian of Samosata (~125-180) was a lawyer and satirist in the ancient world. The writings selected here (and translated into modern English) are those which highlight both Lucian's sense of humor and his dedication to ridding the world of charaltans and philosophical hucksters. Included in this volume are two novellas: \"A True Story\" (a parody of the Odyssey) and \"Lucius the Ass\" (in which a man is turned into a donkey); a series of dialogues mocking the extremes of religion and philosophy; and two letters, \"Alexander the False Prophet\" (which exposes a man who had swindled a small town by claiming to speak for the gods) and \"The Death of Peregrinus\" (which exposes the hypocrisy of a man who killed himself in the name of philosophy).\n\nEven better, here is finally an atheist (or at least an agnostic) who is worth picking up and skimming through. Really, the number of anti-religion-in-general writers I've come across who aren't just polemical ranters is so small that it's always refreshing to find one who is honest, thoughtful, and consistent in his beliefs. Lucian is all of these things, with a wicked sense of humor to boot."
