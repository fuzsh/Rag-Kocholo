        "text": "COFFEE tables in many a nautically minded . house will be groaning under the weight of these two handsome jumbo‐sized books this gift season. Pleasure boating is served by William Wallace's book; Lionel Casson's is on the history of ships and boats through the ages. They supplement and complement each other, with virtually no overlapping, and they have in common excellent production jobs. Both are strong on graphic presentation of subjects that lend themselves well to exciting illustrations. Both authors have pursued extensive research and have adapted it into easily read and generally entertaining texts. While not the last word in reference on either subject, both books will long be helpful for that purpose, and they perform a service in distilling knowledge spread over a vast number of sources into one popular package.\n\nWallace's “The Macmillan Book of Boating,” with an eyecatching wrap‐around dust jacket photo of the thrusting bows of the 12‐meter sloops Gretel and Weatherly, America's Cup opponents in 1962, is heavy on the early history of yachting. Lavish use of prints from such sources as the New York Yacht Club, the Marine Historical Society of Mystic, Conn., Currier & Ives, the Peabody Museum of Salem, Mass. and the New York Public Library, revives the color of the period.\n\nWallace's knack of bringing a long‐forgotten incident to life is at its best in his account of the schooner Mohawk disaster on the sultry afternoon of July 20, 1876. Her young millionaire owner, William T. Garner, and a party of New York bluebloods, had just come aboard at the New York Yacht Club Station at Stapleton, S. I., for a sail on New York Bay, when a vicious line‐squall sped off the Staten Island shore, caught the beamy, shallow‐draft, 253‐foot centerboarder still at anchor, but with her sails up, and capsized her, drowning five in the owner's party.\n\nThe schooner America's 1851 victory in England which launched the America's Cup series is recalled, and there are lively passages on the Great Ocean Race of 1866 and some of the early America's Cup challenges. When the modern era is reached, Wallace, a New York sportswriter who has been a pleasure boat sailor since boyhood, turns from detailed accounts of individual events to a more comprehensive approach, and there is perhaps too much compressed into the later chapters to do justice to it all. The coupling of subjects in some chapters leads to some confusion, also.\n\nMany of the photographs and their reproduction are superb, although the tendency to crowd too much in is also evident here. The fabulous files of Morris Rosenfeld have been used to good effect, and Richard Meek contributes some striking shots. There is an error in a caption that identifies the famous yawl Bolero as a sloop (admittedly the mizzen mast does seem to be on a boat in the background) and credit should have been given to a superb feat of seamanship in rolling in a reef in a classic shot of the sloop Mustang. But these are minor carpings over a beautiful book.\n\nCasson's “Illustrated History of Ships and Boats” is also a well‐documented and clearly presented work. Again, the later chapters seem skimpy and too broad after a fascinating excursion into earlier history. A professor of classics at New York University, and a lifetime amateur sailor, Casson obviously intended to emphasize analysis of the development of primitive craft Illustrations from old prints, museum exhibits and other forms of primitive art, and the text, give much detailed information.\n\nHe tells what it was like to be a Holy Land pilgrim on a Venetian galley — odoriferous and brutally uncomfortable, one would gather — and provides clear descriptions on the practical operation of all the important types of craft in the history of sail. Developments in sails and rig are explained in a manner to interest the technically minded sailor as well as the landsman, and it puts a perspective on the fantastic pace of transportation developments in the past few decades to realize that some of these cumbersome rigs were standard, with very little change, for centuries.\n\nIt seems incredible, in the light of the romantic fuss made over ships of 50 years ago in Operation Sail last summer, that John Paul Jones and Horatio Nelson, as Casson points out, would have been perfectly at home on the quarterdeck of the Santa Maria over 300 years after she was built. In an age that has jumped from fullrigged ships to 12‐Meter Cup yachts and atomic‐powered craft in little more than a generation, it is difficult to grasp that the basic vessel of worldwide transportation changed so little in all those years. Such a seemingly minor development as the metamorphosis of headsails from a little square sail under the bowsprit to the fore‐and‐aft jib as we know it today was a matter of centuries and the Casson book is a valuable record of how such changes came about."
