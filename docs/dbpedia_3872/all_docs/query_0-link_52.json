        "text": "They had to start from scratch. Alexandria was a brand-new city with a population consisting most of soldiers and sailors of the Ptolemies' armed forces, bureaucrats and clerks of their administration, and the mixed bag of traders, businessmen, craftsman [sic], swindlers, and whatnot, who see opportunity in, as it were, a fresh playing field. Intellectuals had to be blandished into coming to a place that to all outward appearances was a cultural wasteland. The Ptolemies offered such irresistible inducements that in the course of the third century B.C., the period of the city's cultural zenith, they were able to gather there a stellar community. From Athens, Ptolemy I got not only Euclid but also Strato, the foremost physicist of the age, and Ptolemy III got Eratosthenes, the geographer whose calculation of the circumference of the earth was astonishingly accurate. Herophilus, pioneer in the study of anatomy, after training at the renowned medical center on Cos where Hippocrates had practiced, set himself up at Alexandria. Even the great Archimedes was coaxed into leaving his native Syracuse for a short stay there.\n\nWhat helped mightily in enticing intellectuals to the city was the founding by Ptolemy I of the famous Museum. In ancient times, the word museum normally referred to a religious establishment, a temple for the worship of the muses; Ptolemy's creation was a figurative temple for the muses, a place for cultivating the arts they symbolized. It was an ancient version of a think-tank: the members, consisting of noted writers, poets, scientists, and scholars, were appointed by the Ptolemies for life and enjoyed a handsome salary, tax exemption (no inconsiderable perquisite in the Ptolemaic kingdom), free lodging, and food. There was no danger of funds running out since the institution had an endowment granted by Ptolemy I when he set it up. For its quarters he turned over an area in the palace, including a room where the members could dine together. They were, in short, spared the lowly details of daily life in order to spend their time on elevated intellectual pursuits—just like their counterparts in today's think-tanks."
