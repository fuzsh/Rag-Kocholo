Prince­ ton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1971. Pp. xxviii+441. $20.00. In 1895, Cecil Toit published Ancient Ships, which for three-quarters of a century remained practically the only reference work in its field. When it was proposed that Dr. Casson, of the Classics Department of New York University, revise it and bring it up to date, so much new information had become available in the meantime that he found it more practical to write a w'holly new work. The result, while it may not remain the sole authority for the next three-quarters of a century, is unlikely to be supplanted soon. It is an excellent work in every way, lavishly illustrated and with full scholarly apparatus. Quotations in Latin and Creek are trans­ lated for the benefit of those who (like myself) read these languages either lente et. magno cum dolore or not at all. Appendices go into such peripheral questions as the use of the galley slaves (Ben Hur notwith­ standing, this only began in the 15th century c.e.); small craft; markings and names (of which scores are known) of ancient ships; and ancient harbors. Casson, an enthusiastic yachtsman, is largely responsible for set­ tling some vexed questions about ancient ships. These include the appearance of fore-and-aft rigs before the Christian Era and the form of the Ptolemaic supergalleys, the “thirtiers” and “fortiers.” These ships, he infers, wrere twin-hulled catamarans. I w'ish he had gone into the subject of Caligula’s galleys on Lake Nemi, since I should like to have learned whether he has any additions or qualifications to make to Ucelli’s monumental Le navi di. Nemi. But these very interesting barges are merely alluded to in footnotes. L. Sprague de Camp·’ A History of Ottoman Architecture. By Godfrey Goodwin. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1971. Pp. 510; 520 illustrations. $30.00. This is a major book. Almost for the hrst time in the history of the held a large volume proceeds to survey, from its beginnings in the 14th century through its decadence in the 19th, one of the richest and most original architectural traditions in the Muslim world. The plans are good, the illustrations numerous, the critical apparatus complete and remarkably up-to-date. The book is eminently read­ able and will remain for decades as the point of departure for most studies on late Islamic architecture. It has utilized the considerable amount of new work accomplished in Turkey over recent years and *.Mr. be (Lamp, of Villanova, Pennsylvania, is the author of some seventy books popularizing science, archaeology, and the history of technology. Among his books are The Ancient Engineers and The Heroic Age ofAmerican Invention. ..."
