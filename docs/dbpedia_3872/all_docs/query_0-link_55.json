        "text": "mail:\n\nBill Thayer\n\nItaliano\n\nHelp\n\nUp\n\nHome\n\nAÂ Selection of Articles\n\nfrom Various Journals\n\nin the Fields of Classics, History, and Archaeology\n\nThis site collects aÂ few articles that either captured my fancy, or, more often, were referred to elsewhere onsite â so that it finally seemed a bit unfair not to provide the text of them onsite as well. I'll be adding to the collection from time to time. Most of the papers deal with ancient Rome, but not all.\n\nAt the time IÂ input these articles, some of them were not online anywhere; others were available in partial, garbled, or otherwise inferior versions, or only as raw scans; many were online, yet not available to the general public, but with access restricted in various ways.\n\nAll journal articles onsite are in the public domain, of course.\n\nIn the case of articles originally published in the United States, the copyright of those ofÂ 1922 and earlier has lapsed; of those fromÂ 1923 toÂ 1963 inclusive, they are in the public domain if the publisher failed to renew, which IÂ have verified in each instance. (Details here on the copyright law involved.)\n\nThe copyright status of articles originally published outside the United States follows different rules; generally, they enter the public domain a certain number of years (oftenÂ 70) after the death of their authors. I've checked the dates in each case, and where that information governs the copyright status of the article, you will find it in the public domain notice in the page's header bar.\n\nYou may be coming here from my Readings in Egyptian History page; articles more particularly relevant to that field are marked on this page with anÂ â¥ (that's a searchable character, by the way, that you can copy and paste in your browser window's \"find on page\" box).\n\nSimilarly, articles relevant to Catholic History are marked â , also a searchable character.\n\nThese characters may show up as a plain box in some browsers, even if you have a supporting font: you can still select them, copy them, and paste in your find box, where they may magically appear, or not: but at any rate you will be able to search for them on the page.\n\nâ Â American Catholic Quarterly Review\n\nAmerican Historical Review\n\nAmerican Journal of Archaeology\n\nAmerican Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts\n\nAmerican Journal of Philology\n\nAmerican Journal of Theology\n\nAmerican School of Classical Studies in Rome, Supplementary Papers\n\nArchaeologia Aeliana\n\nThe Art Bulletin\n\nâ Â The Ave Maria\n\nBurlington Magazine for Connoisseurs\n\nCeltic Review\n\nClassical Journal\n\nClassical Philology\n\nClassical Quarterly\n\nClassical Review\n\nClassical Weekly\n\nEnglish Historical Review\n\nGeographical Review\n\nGreece &Â Rome\n\nGentleman's Magazine\n\nHarvard Studies in Classical Philology\n\nIsis\n\nJewish Quarterly Review\n\nJournal of the American Oriental Society\n\nâ¥ Journal of Egyptian Archaeology\n\nJournal of Hellenic Studies\n\nJournal of Near Eastern Studies\n\nJournal of Roman Studies\n\nJournal of the Royal Asiatic Society\n\nKlio\n\nLacusCurtius (i.e., first published on this site)\n\nMnemosyne\n\nNotes &Â Queries\n\nThe Observatory\n\nPhoenix\n\nProceedings of the American Philosophical Society\n\nSpeculum\n\nSyria\n\nTransactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association\n\nUnited States Service Magazine\n\nâ¦\n\nTechnical Details\n\nPrinted Source\n\nIÂ am transcribing my selection from original exemplars of the journals, and only of course those now in the public domain: details here on the copyright law involved. Unless otherwise stated, any illustrations are those accompanying the original article in the journal.\n\nProofreading\n\nAs almost always, IÂ retype texts by hand rather than scanning them â not only to minimize errors prior to proofreading, but as an opportunity for me to become intimately familiar with them, an exercise IÂ heartily recommend: Qui scribit, bis legit. (Well-meaning attempts to get me to scan text, if success­ful, would merely turn me into some kind of machine: gambit declined.)\n\nThese transcriptions have been minutely proofread. In the table of contents above, the articles are shown on blue backgrounds, indicating that IÂ believe the text of them to be completely errorfree; red backgrounds would indicate they had not been proofread. As elsewhere onsite, the header bar at the top of each chapter's webpage will remind you with the same color scheme.\n\nVery occasionally the proofreaders of the original articles nodded off, and I've therefore had the opportunity to make aÂ few corrections, marking the correction each time with a bullet like this:Âº as elsewhere on my site, glide your cursor over the bullet to read what was actually printed. Similarly, bullets before measurements provide conversions to metric, e.g., â¢10Â miles.\n\nMost of these typos were of a minor and obvious kind; but I've marked them nonetheless, as a reminder that there must surely be quite aÂ few other errors that IÂ could not catch: numbers, proper nouns.\n\nWhere an error is manifest, but for some reason IÂ couldn't fix it, or where it is uncertain whether it is poor proofreading of the translated text or it might just have been made in the original documents (which IÂ usually have not seen), or again where there might otherwise be some latitude, IÂ marked itÂ . Inconsistencies in punctuation have been corrected to the text's usual style, in aÂ slightly different color â barely noticeable on the page, but it shows up in the sourcecode as <SPAN CLASS=\"emend\">. Finally, aÂ number of odd spellings, curious turns of phrase,Â etc. have been marked <!ââÂ sicÂ in the sourcecode, just to confirm that they were checked.\n\nAny over­looked mistakes, please drop me a line, of course: especially if you have a copy of the printed book in front of you.\n\nPagination and Local Links\n\nFor citation and indexing purposes, the pagination is shown in the right margin of the text at the page turns (like at the end of this line);Â p57Â these are also local anchors. Sticklers for total accuracy will of course find the anchor at its exact place in the sourcecode.\n\nIn addition, I've inserted aÂ number of other local anchors: whatever links might be required to accommodate the author's own cross-references, as well as aÂ few others for my own purposes. If in turn you have a website and would like to target a link to some specific passage of the text, please let me know: I'll be glad to insert a local anchor there as well."
