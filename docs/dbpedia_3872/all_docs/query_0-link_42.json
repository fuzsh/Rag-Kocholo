        "text": "Jill Kitson: Welcome to Lingua Franca, I'm Jill Kitson.\n\nThis week: the Library of Alexandria and its legacy. The American classicist Lionel Casson in the second of two programs on Libraries in the Ancient World.\n\nFounded by Ptolemy I at the beginning of the third century BC, the Library of Alexandria is the most famous library of the ancient world. Its collection of papyrus scrolls, said to have numbered nearly half a million, drew intellectuals from all over the Greek-speaking Mediterranean and helped make Alexandria the greatest cultural centre of the Hellenistic world. The Library survived Julius Caesar's torching of the nearby dockyards in 50 BC to last beyond the era of the Ptolemies well into the third century of the Christian era, when it was destroyed in a local uprising.\n\nLionel Casson is Emeritus Professor of Classics at New York University and the author of many books on ancient maritime travel. In his slim history of Libraries in the Ancient World, he devotes a chapter to the Library of Alexandria: the third chapter. In last week's Lingua Franca we talked about what preceded it: the palace and temple archives in Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nThis week, from his home in New York, Lionel Casson talks about the Library of Alexandria.\n\nLionel Casson: It was founded by Ptolemy I whose reign began in 306 BC and lasted until 282 BC, and it was founded to give added glory to his new capital at Alexandria. The city after all had been founded by Alexander the Great from scratch a few years earlier. The Ptolemies were a rich dynasty, they had the resources of Egypt at their disposal and Egypt was a rich place, so they had money, and they decided to spend it in all directions, not only to build the city into an architectural sight place, but also to make it as you mentioned a moment ago, a cultural centre.\n\nJill Kitson: So it's very interesting that at this stage the notion of having a library that gathered together all the knowledge, all the great writings of the Hellenistic world, was seen as being absolutely essential to this culture.\n\nLionel Casson: It was. Ptolemy I was a man of breadth, but he was basically a soldier. Somebody must have sold him the idea, and he bought it. It involved by the way not only building a library, but inviting savants from all over the Greek world to live in Alexandria.\n\nJill Kitson: Well, and more than that, as you say he paid them a handsome, untaxed salary, provided them with food and lodging, and then access to this magnificent library.\n\nLionel Casson: That's enough to seduce any savant.\n\nJill Kitson: And of course it was a huge library; there was nearly half a million papyrus rolls in the main library.\n\nLionel Casson: The figure has come down to us, but figures from the ancient world are not certain. The figure is close to half a million, but we don't know how many individual works that means. A given work, for example the work of Herodotus, would spill over many scrolls; the work of Thucydides would spill over close to a half a dozen scrolls, or maybe even more. So when you say it, half a million scrolls, you're saying in a sense half a million volumes, without meaning by that half a million different titles.\n\nJill Kitson: Now of course this is before the era of copyright, and yet what they were trying to gather at the Library of Alexandria, were the authoritative texts, so they also amassed many different versions of the same work, and tried, as one does with the first folio of Shakespeare and so on, to hold in the library what was the closest to the authoritative text.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes. A whole segment of the scholarship of the age was devoted to working out what was the honest text of a given author, particularly Homer, by the way, particularly Homer. Homer to the Greeks was as the Bible is to us, and they wanted a proper text of Homer.\n\nJill Kitson: And of course also they catalogued them and arranged them, you say alphabetically. I'm drawing this out because it's sounding more and more like, despite the papyrus scrolls, more and more like the sort of public libraries we're familiar with.\n\nLionel Casson: We don't have it laid out in actual clear fact but what shreds of information we have, we figure they did, over the course of time, over the course of decades, work out a system of cataloguing, which was based on dividing the works into different areas and then alphabetising them under each area. But the alphabetisation never went beyond the first or second letter, so even though the works were arranged in alphabetical order, they were not as easy to check on shelf as ours are today.\n\nJill Kitson: Now the directors of the Library, certainly the early directors, were you say, intellectual luminaries, and the first was Zenodotus.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes.\n\nJill Kitson: Tell us about him.\n\nLionel Casson: I can't tell you anything except that his name is down there as the Director of the Library. He's just a name to us; we have no details about him. It's true of many of the great figures from the ancient world. It's known that Zenodotus introduced alphabetisation, that's about all that I can tell you about him, and that he specialised in working out a proper text of Homer.\n\nJill Kitson: Well what about Callimachus, his successor, what do we know about him?\n\nLionel Casson: Well, we know a little more about him, that he came from Cyrene and he made his way as an unknown to Alexandria, and took a job teaching, the way so many would-be savants have to start their career as, and somehow came to the notice of Ptolemy I, or one of the later Ptolemies maybe, the second or the third Ptolemy by that time. And made a name as a poet, as a writer of prose and as an organiser of the books in the library and the scrolls of the library.\n\nJill Kitson: Now you go on to write about the growth of libraries in the Hellenistic world. Obviously the Library of Alexandria was THE great cosmopolitan library.\n\nLionel Casson: It was unique, there was nothing like it, never, even when Rome started and was able to spend, and the Roman Emperors were able to spend much money on libraries, they never matched the Library at Alexandria.\n\nJill Kitson: But the interesting thing is that as we talk about libraries and this accumulation of copies, we're beginning to see, or to sense, that there are books being shipped from one place, or carried from one part of an empire to another, that they're being sold and that there is in fact a book industry - a publishing industry and a book-selling industry - and the libraries are central to it, or in particular the Library of Alexandria. So tell us something of the nature of the book industry.\n\nLionel Casson: The book industry can be dated back to the late 5th century BC, the late 400s. There's talk about booksellers having stands in the agora at Athens, for example. What a book dealer did was make you up a copy of a book that you wanted. If it was a copy of Homer that was easy enough, there were plenty of copies of Homer around and this book dealer, who really presided over a room full of scribes - scribes who would in almost all cases be slaves, well educated, very well educated slaves of course - and their job was to copy off the text that the bookseller would hand them, and then the copy they made would be sold to the customer. If, for example, you wanted a copy of Herodotus, you went to a bookdealer and somehow or other he had to get his hands on a copy of Herodotus, maybe from a private person who had known Herodotus and had gotten a copy that he had copied from Herodotus's original. It sounds repetitive and complicated, but that's the way it was done. When a book was written the only copy in existence was the copy that the author wrote down. Herodotus's History: Herodotus wrote down one copy. Then he would make copy for friends, or he would allow friends to make copies from his copy, and then the bookdealer would somehow get hold of one of those copies and make one for a given customer. Eventually there were lots of bookdealers, namely people each one of whom had a shop with a batch of scribes in it, whose job it was to make copies of given texts that the dealer handed over to them, which texts the dealer would get either from the author himself or if the author was already dead, from some family that had somehow acquired a copy.\n\nJill Kitson: One does keep wondering how the author actually made any money out of all this, because it seems to come down to the bookseller who commissioned the scribe.\n\nLionel Casson: That's right. The author didn't make any money, that's why only people with money were authors.\n\nJill Kitson: Well that's a good answer. But we obviously haven't got time to look at libraries in the Roman world, but of course the big advantage that Rome and southern Italy had, was that it had been part of the Hellenistic world, so even though the Romans - of course Latin was their language, there was bilingualism in the early Roman state.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes. Southern Italy was totally Greek and remained Greek throughout its\n\nwhole career, and a Roman library was always made up of two parts: the Latin section and the Greek section. That's long after the Library of Alexandria was in its prime.\n\nJill Kitson: So I really only wanted to bring up the Romans because it was they who made the move from the roll to the codex, to something that we find recognisable as a book, with leaves.\n\nLionel Casson: Yes. They had to wait until the 1st century AD, the end of it, and the beginning of the 2nd century AD. The codex really didn't take off until the third or fourth century AD despite its handiness over the scroll.\n\nJill Kitson: So the Library of Alexandria was destroyed, all the books had been dispersed, those that were not destroyed, so what is our evidence for what it was like?\n\nLionel Casson: Our evidence for what it was like is a description by a Roman writer of the think-tank that the Ptolemies had set up in Alexandria of which the Library was a part, and he gives some very vague details about it. However there is another great Library which set itself up as a rival to the Library at Alexandria at Pergamum in Western Asia Minor, not far from the site of Troy, and there a building has been found which we think included the rooms given over to the great Library at Pergamum, and that gives us an idea of what it was like.\n\nJill Kitson: Lionel Casson. In his book he describes the remains of the Library at Pergamum. Set up as an adjunct to the Temple of Athena on Pergamum's fortress hilltop, the Library occupied four rooms in the U-shaped colonnade that embraced the Temple. The largest of these rooms is roughly 16 metres long and 14 metres wide. Along with a colossal statue of Athena, bases for busts inscribed with the names of Homer, Herodotus and other noted literary figures were found here.\n\nThe archaeologists who excavated the site reasoned that 'a room of this size and with such décor . would have served as a chamber where the library's learned users held receptions, meetings, conferences.' The other three rooms are shorter and narrower. These they've identified as the stacks: the walls, says Lionel Casson would have been lined with wooden shelves for holding rolls.\n\nThe sole indication of the Library of Pergamum's size is found in an anecdote recorded by Plutarch: that Mark Antony had reputedly given Cleopatra 200,000 of its books, a gift, says Lionel Casson that could only have been intended for the Library of Alexandria. He adds that it's been calculated that the three smaller rooms at Pergamum would have had sufficient shelving space for that number.\n\nLionel Casson's book 'Libraries in the Ancient World' is published by Yale University Press.\n\nAnd that's all for this week's Lingua Franca.\n\nTHEME"
