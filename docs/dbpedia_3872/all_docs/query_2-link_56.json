        "text": "A response to criticisms leveled by Amy Peeler and Jason Whitlark in their published dissertations.\n\nI have throughout my career been interested in how the social institutions of patronage, benefaction, and friendship – and the associated ethos of reciprocity – might inform our exegesis of New Testament texts and even our re-examination of biblical theology.[1] These institutions and its ethos were a prominent weave in the social fabric of the Hellenistic and Roman periods and, as such, a potentially important background and resource for understanding how early Christian authors thought about and gave expression to the significance and promise of Jesus’ person and work as well as to the relationship between God and human beings who align themselves with this Jesus and the ethical implications of the same for those human beings. I have kept returning to this background in large measure, I think, because of its potential importance for re-thinking Christian theology – grace being a central concept in soteriology and the doctrine of justification, in particular. I find it (if it is allowed to become a starting point for re-examining contemporary theological commitments, as it was, I am convinced, a vital starting point for Christian theology at its inception) to offer the resources for critiquing traditional divisions of justification from sanctification from regeneration and for developing a much more holistic vision for the interconnections between Christian faith and practice, between grace and response, between “belief” and “discipleship.”\n\nHaving invested a great deal of time and effort researching and developing these ideas, I am perhaps understandably engaged when other scholars, reading my material, find what they believe to be cause to sideline, correct, or otherwise marginalize what I have been trying to bring more forcefully to the fore in exegesis and theology. Every critique provides me with the opportunity to re-examine my positions and discern if these positions need to be refined, if I just have to state them more carefully to avoid misunderstanding, or if counter-claims are being made that, in the end, interfere with hearing the text – counter-claims that must be answered in some arena lest I appear to acquiesce to them as correct by my silence.\n\n1. Amy Peeler\n\nMy first conversation partner here is Amy Peeler, particularly her published dissertation, You Are My Son: The Family of God in the Epistle to the Hebrews (T. & T. Clark, 2014). I fully agree with her emphasis on the importance of the frame of the father-son relationship that the author of Hebrews to speak of the relationship of God to Jesus for the author’s pastoral strategy in this sermon, and I have developed this at length myself as it pertains, positively, to the assurance it gives the audience concerning the access to God it now enjoys through such a well-placed mediator of God’s favor and, negatively, to the greater pause it gives the audience concerning any course of action that might dishonor, and thus invite the satisfaction of, one whose honor is so intimately embedded in God’s own. From this statement, it seems clear that I find the topic of Sonship as it concerns Jesus and considerations of access to divine favor to be more closely and directly related that Peeler seems to allow. I also find myself disagreeing to some extent where she speaks of the importance of the father-children relationship in the author’s presentation of the relationship of believers to God, particularly where she promotes this to the exclusion of other frameworks for this relationship.\n\nI wonder about such broad-sweeping statements as this: “When human beings come into his [i.e., God’s] presence, they do so as his children” (p. 183). While there are passages that foreground a filial relationship between God and the “many sons and daughters,” such as 2:10-18 (though already the language veers toward a “high priest” who “helps” or “provides assistance” in 2:17b-18) or 12:5-11 (though “God is bearing himself toward you as toward sons and daughters” is somewhat less exuberant than Paul’s “you are all sons and daughters of God” [Gal 3:26]), there are vast stretches of text with not a single word invoking kinship relations. From 4:1 through 10:18 the author speaks of his audience in their relationship to God and to Christ in terms entirely removed from the realm of “family.” In their relationship with one another, the notion of brotherhood and sisterhood is invoked only in the recitation of Jeremiah 31 (where, however, “brother or sister” appears in synonymous parallelism with “fellow citizen”). (I except here the language of “inheriting” in 6:12, 17, as I am not convinced that the language of inheritance automatically invokes a framework of kinship.) If we extend this survey through 11:40, we encounter only the vocative “brothers and sisters” in 10:19 and the mixed metaphor of “a great high priest over the house of God” in 10:21 to remind us of the possible kinship connections between believers and with God.\n\nIn these chapters, believers do not approach God “as his children.” Rather, they “draw near to the throne of favor in order to receive mercy and find favor for timely help” – language much more directly connected with patron-client relationships and exchanges – and this through the brokerage, or mediation, of “a great high priest” (4:14-16). They approach merely as “those drawing near to God through him” (7:25) or merely “drawing near to God” (11:6), as those who have been cleansed in regard to their consciences (9:14; 10:14), as those who are “naked with their throats exposed before the eyes of him with whom is our accounting” (4:13). They are identified as “the people of God” (4:9; cf. 8:10; 10:30), as “those who obey” Jesus the Son (5:8), as “imitators of those who through faith and endurance are inheriting the promises” (6:12), as “those who are called” (9:15). They approach a God who is named as “God” (extensively), as a “rewarder” (11:6), less favorably as a Judge (10:30; 12:23) and not as a “parent” (save in 12:9). Jesus is known as “mediator” (8:6; 9:15; 12:24) and “guarantor” of a new covenant (7:22), one who appears before God on behalf of those who look to him for mediation (9:24), through whom believers approach God and seek God’s favors (4:14-16; 7:25), all of this language more closely and rather explicitly reflective of scripts of brokerage and not the relationship of an older brother connecting his siblings with their distant father. He does all this above all in the office of “priest” or “high priest,” a role that, as I have argued at length elsewhere, is given specific significance by the projection upon the sphere of divine-human relations and interaction of the framework of patronage, brokerage, and clientage known from human-human relations and interaction. None of this is the language of children approaching a father, and nothing seems to me to be gained by privileging this image where the author himself has not.\n\nIt may indeed be true that “deSilva’s commentary falls short of highlighting the prevailing familial theme” (p. 83) as this pertains to the audience in regard to the appearance of the important phrase “many sons and daughters” in 2:10, though I think I highlighted this theme more than appreciatively in my treatment of 12:5-11. At the same time, it appears to me that Peeler has not allowed enough room for the multiple ways in which the author strategically frames the relationship between God and believers, not least among which is the relationship of beneficiaries to a great patron whose favor is accessed and assured through a Son in his household who has taken the believers into his own network of favor, which is in turn framed in the familiar language of priesthood as brokerage between gods and human beings.\n\nBefore leaving Peeler’s work, I would like to address myself to two comments she makes in regard to the warning passages. First, she writes: “As an example of the gravity lost with DeSilva’s interpretive lens, his treatment of the warning passages describes the author’s argument thus: ‘[h]e therefore makes the addressees aware of the danger through a number of stern warnings designed to arouse fear and dread in the hearers of the consequences of pursuing a course which would provoke their Patron’. To the contrary, the warning passages speak of trespasses against the Son of God (6.6; 10.29) and, hence, elicit the insolence committed against his Father” (p. 184). The declaration of “to the contrary” here leaves me a bit puzzled, as I had written quite explicitly about “trespasses against the Son of God (6.6; 10.29) and the significance of the implied “insolence committed against his Father” as key disincentives in the author’s rhetoric. She continues: “To the sin of ingratitude, those described in the warning passages add the sin of parental disrespect. The danger before them is that they might dishonor their Father, an even more dreadful atrocity than the disrespect of a Patron” (pp. 184-85). If this is true, the author of Hebrews leaves it to be entirely inferred. At no point does the parent-children relationship appear as frame or motive in these warning passages. The fact that the author warns against abusing God’s unique Son Jesus Christ is no argument in favor of viewing the divine-human relationship in terms of family versus patronage.\n\nWhere the audience remains faithful to God in connection with Jesus, they can be addressed as sons and daughters, as partners of the Son par excellence, and so forth. They remain “God’s house” as they fulfill the conditions of faithful connection (3:6: “we are his house, if….”). But where they are considered, as in the famous warning passages, from the point of view of failing to respond to God’s gifts secured for them by Jesus – and here I am using language of patronage and brokerage without using the terms themselves – then Jesus remains Son of God, of course, but there is nothing filial, nothing familial in the author’s description of the audience or their changed circumstances or the changed attitude of God toward them and the threatened consequences.\n\n2. Jason Whitlark\n\nI would like to turn now to Jason Whitlark’s interactions with my work in his published dissertation, Enabling Fidelity to God: Perseverance in Hebrews in Light of the Reciprocity Systems of the Ancient Mediterranean World (Paternoster, 2008).\n\nA major feature of Whitlark’s investigation, and a principle that looms large in his critique of my work, is the dichotomy he creates between “ongoing divine enabling of human fidelity” on the one hand and “the dance of reciprocity” or “indebted gratitude” on the other (see, e.g., pp. 2, 129, 145-146, 156, 170, 172, 174-75, 202). Two theological principles appear to be at stake in this discussion: a commitment to monergism versus synergism (he himself identifies “Pelagianism and Augustinianism” as the two theological trajectories at work here on p. 14) and, as a corollary, a “pessimistic” versus an “optimistic anthropology,” with a pessimistic anthropology linked to an emphasis on divine empowerment and an optimistic anthropology linked to the expectation of reciprocity.\n\nI have difficulty going where he leads for a number of reasons. First, I find first-century authors whose significantly pessimistic anthropology does not lead to excusing human beings from fulfilling their reciprocal obligations toward God: honoring his favor manifested in creation, in making ongoing provision for life, and in supplying knowledge of the path to life in a greater sense by their worship, loyalty, and obedience. I would point those interested to my 2014 JSNT article on 4 Ezra and Paul to follow up on this. Second, I would regard “ongoing divine empowerment” as part of the fabric of reciprocity that preserves the relationship, just as I would regard reciprocity on the part of disciples as a consequence of (not a necessary consequence, but a consequence made possible by) divine empowerment. It is specifically by approaching the throne of favor through the mediation of Jesus the high priest, receiving mercy, and finding favor for timely help (4:14-16) that the audience can be expected to continue metaphorically to bear the suitable vegetation for those on whose behalf God has cultivated them that receives further blessing (6:7-8). The agricultural image here seems to me quite expressly to hold together divine empowerment (“the rain that often falls upon it,” referring to the wave after wave of gifts the hearers had experienced, recalled in 6:4-5) and reciprocity (“brings forth vegetation suitable for those on whose behalf it is cultivated”). Conversely, as they fail to reach for the assistance available to them in the present, the likelihood that they will act ungratefully toward God through the defection that holds the Son of God up to public contempt, and thereby incur God’s wrath, increases. For the record, I have never said otherwise.\n\nWhitlark suggests that, in my commentary, I have placed a disproportionate emphasis on gratitude, comparing my “hundreds of uses of the term gratitude” (p. 141) to the author of Hebrews’ single use of χάρις to mean gratitude in 12:28 and a possible reference to reciprocity in 6:10, which Whitlark attempts to disqualify. He writes: “This is obviously disproportionate and gives the impression that Hebrews is being forced into a mold of Greco-Roman benefaction” (p. 141). Perhaps. But I would suggest that the importance of a grateful response is advanced by the author’s warnings concerning the disastrous consequences of making an ungrateful response, clearly the dynamic of 6:4-8 and 10:29-31. I would also suggest that the author’s connection of what the audience “has,” which in every case is something that results from something being “given” them or from someone working on their behalf, with actions that the audience is therefore to take, which impels them in the direction of looking to God for ongoing help, remaining loyal in their profession of hope, and continuing to invest in one another’s perseverance, is based on the logic of reciprocity and gives instructions for operationalizing gratitude (I am thinking chiefly of 4:14-16 and 10:19-25, alongside 12:28-13:16). That these occur in two sections that have been found to be pivotal in the structure of Hebrews seems to me to underscore the importance of this operationalizing of gratitude for the author’s strategy.\n\nTwo other dichotomies that I would suggest are false dichotomies seem to me to impede Whitlark’s analysis of Hebrews and of my own work. In regard to Heb 6:10, Whitlark debates whether to “filter this through the lens of Greco-Roman benefaction,” in which case “we might hear that God is not an ungrateful deity but gratefully repays those who honor him” or “through the lens of a Jewish and Christian eschatology that expected a final reckoning by God,” in which case “God, in this verse, is declared to be a just judge who judges every person impartially (i.e., he is not ἄδικος) according to his or her deeds” (pp. 130-31). Whitlark favors the latter.\n\nThe dichotomy I am objecting to here is “Greco-Roman benefaction” versus “Jewish and Christian eschatology.” I would suggest that the author of Hebrews clearly expects eschatological judgment to be executed on the basis, at least in part, of how people have responded to God’s gifts and, perhaps more especially for the author, to the Son’s self-giving (6:4-12; 10:29-31). The just judge (the one who is not ἄδικος) recognizes that faithful disciples have engaged in just action vis-à-vis his benefactions and renders a verdict on their moral behavior accordingly (and still impartially). I regard it as highly problematic that in the above-quoted passage Whitlark replaces the author’s language of justice on God’s part with language of gratitude on God’s part. Even I would never suggest that God, upon whose initiating grace all life depends and therefore, as Paul says, whom no creature can ever indebt (Rom 11:35-36), “gratefully repays.” It is enough that the author of Hebrews says that God is not “unjust.” If recipients of God’s favor have proven themselves noble recipients of God’s earlier benefits, investing themselves in accordance with the value and purpose of those benefits, God will ensure that they come to the blessing rather than the experience of curse just mentioned in 6:7-8. I would agree with Whitlark that “the context determines the specific nuance of this term” (ἄδικος), but the context of 6:4-8, with 6:9-10 specifically applying the agricultural analogy of 6:7-8 to the audience in a way that is both encouraging and that encourages ongoing investment in one another, clearly establishes grace and grateful response as the frame of reference here.\n\nIn connection with this passage, I would question the accuracy of Whitlark’s observation: “The author does not try to call to mind all that God has done for them or try to exhort them to repay their debt to God so that God will then continue to be gracious to them” (p. 144). In point of fact, he does in Heb 6:4-10 – though, of course, not with the objectionable language of “repaying a debt.” The author overtly reminds his audience of past gifts from God to motivate present gratitude, service, and loyalty; proving to have been “fruitful soil” for God’s abundant past favors is presented as prerequisite to the ongoing experience of favor. Conversely, failing to value these gifts appropriately leads to exclusion from future favor and even the threat of judgment (2:1-4; 6:4-8; 10:26-31; 12:15-17). (As an aside back to Peeler’s dissertation, the assurance the author offers the hearers in 6:10 is not assurance based on their filial relationship with God, but on faithful enactment of gratitude, on being that “fruitful soil” in which God’s benefits brought forth a pleasing crop in response to the multiple showers of his favors.)\n\nA final dichotomy that I would wish to dissolve concerns “the primary motivation for faithfulness to God in Hebrews,” with Whitlark arguing in favor of “fidelity [being] motivated by faith in a promised future” rather than by “indebted gratitude that arises out of past benefits given” (p.143). Neither component is neglected in my own work, as Whitlark acknowledges, but, as he puts it, while “DeSilva recognizes that the author attempts to ‘stimulate a forward-looking attitude’ and seeks ‘perseverance in faith’, … he does not grasp the discord such statements have with his primary emphasis on faithfulness that springs from indebted gratitude, which is a backward-looking attitude” (p. 144). I find it unhelpful to force a choice between the two, or even to consider the two as essentially distinct movements of the human spirit. Gratitude towards the Giver in regard to past benefits conferred aligns with trust regarding promised benefits yet to be conferred; ingratitude towards the Giver in regard to past benefits conferred aligns with exclusion from promised benefits – and this quite clearly in Hebrews (6:4-12; 10:26-31). Indeed, as a person born and bred into the Greco-Roman world of reciprocity relations, I know that my investment in a grateful response best positions me for the enjoyment of the future benefits for which I hope. To persevere in gratitude is to persevere in faithful trust; to persevere in faithful trust is to persevere in gratitude.\n\nHebrews 13:12-14 strikes me as a good encapsulation of how past benefits and hoped-for benefits alike motivate ongoing “forward” movement (and that into the margins of this world’s social networks). Jesus’ costly investment of himself in benefiting others (“Jesus, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate”) is invoked to stimulate a reciprocal movement and investment on the part of those benefitted (“therefore, let us keep moving out toward him outside the camp, continuing to bear the reproach he bore”). A second rationale for this response, however, appeals to the future benefits promised but not yet enjoyed (“For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the coming one”). A “backward looking” and a “forward looking” response to God’s benefits work together quite well, moreover, in a number of Second Temple Jewish and early Christian texts, something well worth a specialized study.\n\nAn important issue for Whitlark, which is connected closely to his (and a general) allergy to “synergism,” is the question of whether our response merits further favor from God, and the larger question as to whether “merit” plays any role in God’s or Jesus’ determination to show favor. Whitlark analyzes Josephus’s conception of the divine-human relationship as one in which “God’s people respond with worthy gratitude demonstrated primarily through obedience to God thus meriting further favor” (p 135). The question of a potential beneficiary’s merit is indeed an important one in ancient discussions of patronage and beneficence, and an important point of differentiation between the practice among human beings and Paul’s celebration, for example, of God’s lavishing of the most costly benefits upon the least deserving recipients (indeed, those who were “by nature children of wrath”), so I fully understand where this is coming from. With this lens in place, he takes sharp issue with my reading of Heb 2:13a, in which I suggest – admittedly against the grain – that the context will lead the audience to understand the recitation placed upon Jesus’ lips, “I will be confident in him,” to refer to the confidence Jesus places in the believers when he “is not ashamed to call them sisters and brothers” (2:11-12), when he owns them as “the children God has given me” (2:13b). Whitlark suggests that “deSilva affirms that Jesus’ benefits are based upon his estimation of the believers’ worth and reliability to make an equitable return for benefits received” (p. 141, emphasis mine).\n\nMy actual comment on this demi-verse, however, was this: “This indicates that Jesus’ beneficence toward the hearers is accompanied by Jesus’ estimation of them as people of worth, judging them to be suitable beneficiaries and reliable clients who will not disappoint or bring shame upon him” (Perseverance in Gratitude, 115). The sentences that immediately follow this one in my commentary would make it clear that I do not regard Jesus’ beneficence to be “based upon” the merit of the recipients: “This is not to suggest that Christ died for us because we ‘deserved’ it, but the fact that Christ died on our behalf does indicate the value that he attaches to us. That Jesus esteems the believers highly enough to associate with them as sisters and brothers would … deepen their sense of gratitude and obligation to the Son who has treated them with honor beyond their deserving” (Perseverance, p. 115).\n\nThe replacement of my “accompanied by” with “based upon” changes the dynamics and meaning entirely. I would call it a misrepresentation, as is Whitlark’s interpretation of “suitable beneficiaries and reliable clients who will not disappoint or bring shame upon him” as “[people able] to make an equitable return for benefits received.” My point in regard to 2:11-13 is that the author suggests that Jesus has shown considerable faith in the disciples by associating himself so closely and openly with them before his Divine Parent (and before the world), such that it is now incumbent upon the disciples not to put Jesus to shame for having had such faith in them. This is the pastoral strategy of saying: “Don’t let Jesus down after he’s shown such esteem and trust toward you.”\n\nI consider the proper understanding of grace – not only the points of differentiation between God’s favor and a disciple’s response, on the one hand, and the everyday ethos of favor and response in the lived world of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean, on the other hand, for which so many theologically-minded scholars clamor, but the points of similarity, overlap, and continuity between the two that have the power to reform our theological understanding, and that continue not to be recognized or admitted – to remain a foremost “critical theological issue in the Epistle to the Hebrews.”\n\n[1] I first presented this in regard to the Letter to the Hebrews in Despising Shame: Honor Discourse and Community Maintenance in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Society of Biblical Literature Dissertation Series 152; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995; rev. ed. Studia Biblica 21; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2008) and in a related article, “Exchanging Favor for Wrath: Apostasy in Hebrews and Patron-Client Relations,” Journal of Biblical Literature 115 (1996) 91-116. It became an important theme in my commentary, Perseverance in Gratitude: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000), and has continued to feature in my treatments of Hebrews in reference works and Study Bibles (see also The Letter to the Hebrews in Social-Scientific Perspective [Cascade Companions; Eugene, OR: Cascade, 2012], 95-138). At the same time, I have tried to be attentive to how this background can inform our reading of the New Testament more broadly, for example, in chapters 3 and 4 of my Honor, Patronage, Kinship & Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2000) or my New Testament Themes (St. Louis, MO: Chalice Press, 2001), and of Second Temple Jewish texts as diverse as 4 Maccabees (4 Maccabees [Guides to the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha; Sheffield: SAP, 1998], esp. 127-131; 4 Maccabees: Introduction and Commentary on the Greek Text of Codex Sinaiticus [LXX Commentary Series; Leiden: Brill, 2006]) and 4 Ezra (“Grace, the Law, and Justification in 4 Ezra and the Pauline Letters: A Dialogue,” JSNT 37 [2014] 25-49). It plays a significant role in my more recent thinking about Pauline theology in general (see my Transformation: The Heart of Paul’s Gospel [Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2014]) and Galatians in particular (Global Readings: A Sri Lankan Commentary on the Letter to the Galatians [Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2011; Sinhalese translation, Kohuwala, Sri Lanka: CTS Publishing, 2015]; “Appeals to Logos, Ethos, and Pathos in Galatians 5.1-12: An Investigation of Paul’s Inventio,” pp. 246-64 in Stanley Porter and Brian Dyer, eds., Paul and Ancient Rhetoric [Cambridge: Cambridge University, 2015]; “‘We Are Debtors’: Grace and Obligation in Paul and Seneca,” forthcoming in Joseph Dodson and David Briones, eds., Paul and Seneca in Dialogue [Leiden: Brill, 2017]; Galatians [NICNT; Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, forthcoming).\n\nBy God’s grace from start to finish, those who trust in Jesus Christ are saved from the guilt and penalty of their former sins, renewed in God’s image, and empowered by the Holy Spirit to love and serve God and neighbor in true holiness all the remaining days of their lives.\n\n– Adapted from John Wesley, Sermon 6.I.10 (WJW I.208).\n\nSaved from What?\n\nThe celebrated theologian Charles M. Schultz, creator of Peanuts, once drew a strip in which Schroeder was holding up a placard with the words “Christ is the answer.” Snoopy appeared in the next frame with a sign of his own: “What was the question?” It does seem important, when one begins to talk about “the gospel” or “salvation,” to have some conception of the predicament in which we find ourselves, in regard to which we need to hear “good news” and from which we need to be “saved.” Rather than begin here by dogmatically lining out the parameters and causes of human fallenness, we might consider one of the more positive images of human beings in the Hebrew Bible, which also provides a window into a genuinely well-ordered spirit, namely the spirit of the psalmist who exclaimed:\n\nLord, our Lord,\n\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth!\n\nYou have set your glory\n\nin the heavens….\n\nWhen I consider your heavens,\n\nthe work of your fingers,\n\nthe moon and the stars,\n\nwhich you have set in place,\n\nwhat is humankind that you are mindful of them,\n\nhuman beings that you care for them?\n\nYou have made them a little lower than the angels\n\nand crowned them with glory and honor….\n\nLord, our Lord,\n\nhow majestic is your name in all the earth! (Ps. 8:1, 3-5, 9)\n\nThe psalmist begins by acknowledging and glorifying the God who created all things and marvels at the care that God has shown to such created beings as men and women, who are so comparatively insignificant against the backdrop of all God’s created works and yet have been so honored and granted such significant worth by the Creator who continues to sustain them. He returns thence to giving God the glory and, one might well expect, the obedience that is God’s due as the giver and sustainer of life (as witnesses to which we also have such texts as Psalm 1, 19, and 119).\n\nPeople whose hearts and lives reflect the spirit of Psalm 8 stand in relation to God as creatures ought to stand in relation to their Creator, acknowledging God’s abundant favor and expressing, by way of praise, gratitude for God’s unfailing care and attention. They give every promise of standing also in relation to other human beings as they ought. Carrying about within them such a lofty view of human beings, expressing such an awareness of the sacred worth afforded to each and every one of them by their Creator who has “crowned them with glory and honor,” such people must indeed love their neighbors as themselves (cf. Lev. 19:18), respecting and promoting the dignity of each and every neighbor as fully as their own. Such people may not sense any need for – and may in fact not stand in need of! – the deliverance, the salvation, that is the subject of the “good news,” for they already “love the Lord [their] God with all [their] heart and with all [their] soul and with all [their] strength” (Deut. 6:4) and use God’s gift of life to do what pleases God, which is particularly expressed in loving their neighbors as people possessing the same exalted worth as themselves.\n\nBut our life-long experience has shown us that there are many – a great many – whose hearts and lives do not reflect the heart and life of the writer of Psalm 8. There are many who do not honor God as the source of their being and the bestower of unmatched dignity upon themselves and upon all human beings like themselves. Consequently, a great many people do not live their lives in the manner that springs from these twin truths. In turning our collective faces away from God, we have ceased to bear the image of God ourselves and we have ceased to recognize the image of God in others, such that we should account them and treat them as creatures of worth equal to ourselves. And from this spring apathy to the plight of others, exploitation, oppression, violence, holding the lives of others to be cheap while seeking to advance our own interests at their expense, bringing degradation in one form or another on perpetrator and victim alike. We have thus done both God and our neighbors the grossest injustice.\n\nWe know that something is endemically wrong with human experience and that this is related to what we have become as human beings. We are aware that we are all, at our best, less than we ought to be – and that there seems to be no bottom to the depths to which we descend at our worst. From the most egregious (yet horrifically routine) acts of inhumanity throughout the globe to daily decisions to prioritize profit over people to smaller-scale acts of serving one’s own interests at the cost of another’s flourishing, every occurrence along this broad spectrum contributes to a thick, impenetrable weave of what is “wrong” in human experience that cumulatively casts a death shroud over the face of humanity.\n\nAll such experiences are symptoms that cry out for explanation – some etiology of the cause of the predicament in which human beings find themselves in this world and in their relation to God and one another. Two such etiologies stand side-by-side in Paul. One draws upon the story of the disruption in the relationship between God and people, among people, and between people and nature found in Genesis 3. John Wesley was himself quite content to take our first parents’ disobedience and their consequent loss of the image of God as the framework for thinking about the human plight and the solution, even as Paul himself did in Romans 5:12-21. Paul allows this explanation to stand alongside another, however, which stands as a foil in every respect to the spirit expressed in Psalm 8. Paul opens his presentation of his “gospel” with another story of “the fall,” this time located not in a primeval garden of Eden but in the overall sweep of human history (Romans 1:18-32). We ought to have been able to stand before the wonders of creation and perceive the beneficent Deity whose handiwork we beheld (and are!) and, on this basis, to direct our lives toward honoring this God and his creation, an attitude that would have been reflected in our use of our God-given energies and faculties and in our treatment of our God-made and God-honored neighbors (Rom. 1:18-20). However, human beings “exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever” (Rom. 1:25). As a result, human beings and human community descended into disorder. Alienated from the truth about who they were and whose they were, dominated by their own unruly passions, they set themselves on a course toward their own degradation and the degradation of all their relationships (Rom. 1:24, 26-31).\n\nThe condition into which human beings thrust themselves and one another by virtue of their refusal to live before the one God as God’s creatures, that is, as beings who acknowledge, with their every thought, word, and deed, the debt they owe their Creator and to one another as beings similarly belonging to God, resulted in our alienation from God. Indeed, as hostile ingrates abusing the very gift of life and abusing one another, human beings should have expected to meet only with the wrath of the Creator whom they affronted so egregiously – a wrath revealed and experienced already in their degradation (Rom. 1:18) but also awaiting its full manifestation when all would stand before God at God’s visitation to judge the earth (Rom. 2:5, 8).\n\nGood News for Fallen Humanity\n\nIt is precisely at this point that the announcement of what this God has done on behalf of alienated humanity in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and in the gift of the Holy Spirit comes into the human situation as “gospel” – as “good tidings, good news for guilty, helpless sinners”[1] – for God has not visited human beings in God’s wrath but, rather, in further grace contrary to all expectation and deserving. Indeed, the very awareness that “this isn’t how it should be for human beings” and, all the more, “I’m not who I should be as a human being,” is already a gift from God. It is the voice of God calling us out from perpetuating (at least, colluding with) the forces that destroy human life – and from continuing to be the sort of person that does so – toward becoming something new, a person whose ambitions and energies will have decidedly different effects upon human experience as far as our impact can reach. Wesley would name this a facet of God’s “prevenient grace,” God’s intervention in the lives of those who might otherwise “not only do” what is destructive of human flourishing “but even applaud others who practice” the same (Rom. 1:32), losing all sense of that moral compass that would allow them at least the inkling that they need to change direction so as to swim up towards the air rather than farther down towards drowning utterly.[2]\n\nJohn Wesley understood the good news that came to the world in Jesus Christ as the promise of assured deliverance (“salvation”) from this condition in every respect. He emphasized that salvation was not merely about “going to heaven,” though an eternity in the presence of God and the company of all the redeemed does represent the consummation of salvation – that final “salvation” that is “nearer to us now than when we became believers” (Rom. 13:11 NRSV). Salvation encompasses a great deal more than what happened “the hour I first believed” and what we “shall possess within the veil”[3] that now separates the visible earth and heavens from God’s “unshakable kingdom” (Heb. 12:26-28). He expressed this “great deal more” as being saved from the guilt of sin as well as the power of sin.[4] The good news is that God has established the means and a path by which we may “‘be saved’ from the guilt and punishment” that would justly fall upon us on account of our “former sins” as well as receive “power to serve God in true holiness all the remaining days of thy life.”[5] Thus one finds oneself transformed from the sort of person that contributes to the ongoing degradation of self and others into the sort of person in whom God has restored the well-ordered spirit exhibited by the author of Psalm 8 and through whom God works to elevate the dignity and experience of all those whom God’s restored creature touches. Salvation, for Wesley, thus consisted “of two general parts, justification and sanctification,”[6] and it was his particular genius to join these two parts as inseparable and equally indispensable facets of the saving work of God.\n\nThe righteousness of Jesus Christ, the righteousness of God’s own self in the person of God the Son, manifested in a life that was fully human and, at the same time, fully committed to falling into no inward or outward sin, to doing all that the Father wished, and ultimately to suffering all that the Father had ordained in dying on behalf of alienated humanity, became the basis upon which all whose hearts were drawn to the Son in faith and in love would be pardoned for their past sins. This is the meaning of justification, namely “pardon, the forgiveness of sins.”[7] And with the pardon of the guilt – and dismissal thereby of the consequences – comes deliverance from “all servile fear” of God (though not “a filial fear of offending,” such as loved children bear towards loving parents), which is replaced by confidence that God in his favor will bring to completion the work that God has begun.[8]\n\nWesley was adamant that justification does not involve God pretending that believers are righteous when they are not – nor would God give way to such pretense in the judgment, for “the judgment of the all-wise God is always according to truth.”[9] Rather, God has set in motion those divine forces that will make us righteous, if we diligently give ourselves ever over to them. Thus, as Wesley stresses repeatedly, God has delivered those who trust in Jesus not only from the guilt of sin, but also its power. The former is justification; the latter, sanctification. The former is what God “does for us through his Son”; the latter is what God “works in us by his Spirit” so that we become “actually just and righteous.”[10]\n\nSanctification has both a negative and a positive aspect. Negatively, it means that the believer does not commit sin. This includes both inward sin (indulging opinions, emotions, desires, or intentions contrary to God’s will for God’s creatures), such as Jesus had identified as already culpable in God’s sight (see Matt. 5:22, 28) and outward sin (acting upon such opinions, emotions, desires, or intentions).[11] Thus, while in justification believers are delivered from the condemnation of former sins, for they have been forgiven, it is through sanctification that believers are delivered from the condemnation of present and future sins, for they no longer commit them, since they “do not ‘walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit’.”[12] Positively, it means that the believer manifests the fruit of the Holy Spirit in all its variety – “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Gal. 5:22-23), with love, both of God and of one’s neighbors for God’s sake, being the chief of these. It means living ever from “the mind that was in Christ Jesus,” promoting the interests of others before one’s own (Phil. 2:3-5), and thus the full reversal – the complete redemption – of what is amiss in human experience and in what human beings have become.[13] “Thus doth Jesus ‘save his people from their sins’.”[14]\n\nWesley regarded sanctification as essential to salvation: it was the means by which people would be fitted with that “holiness without which no one will see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14, NRSV).[15] But sanctification is not an onerous obligation laid upon the believer to bring about by his or her own power.[16] Rather, it is a path to deliverance generously provided for the believer and sustained in the believer by the same God who graciously pardoned his or her past sins – and Wesley was far more optimistic about the power of the Holy Spirit than he was pessimistic about the frailties of the disciple. It is not a prize that comes without cost, however, for it requires of believers indeed to die to the person that they were (and would otherwise continue to be) apart from the Holy Spirit so that the new person, re-created in the likeness of God, might indeed come alive and take shape fully within them.\n\nSaved by Being Transformed into a New Person: The New Birth\n\nThe third chapter of John’s Gospel gives us the phrase that, more than any other, has come to be associated with evangelical preaching and revivals: “no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again” (John 3:3, NIV). We must be born again because, though humanity was created in God’s image and was meant to continue to bear that image through all its generations, we no longer bear that image by virtue of our natural birth.[17] The dialogue between Jesus and Nicodemus was of great importance to Wesley’s formulation of the Gospel, leading him to identify, alongside justification, the “new birth” as an indispensable work of grace. While justification represents “what God does for us, in forgiving our sins,” the new birth is “what God does in us, in renewing our fallen nature.”[18]\n\nWesley draws an illumining parallel between natural birth and spiritual rebirth. Just as the unborn child has no perception of light, the faintest perception of sound, almost no sensation from the outside world, there being a wall of flesh that separates the child from the world beyond the womb, so the natural person goes about not perceiving the light of God, hearing the voice of God as faint murmurings at best, feeling almost nothing of the promptings of the Spirit. But when he or she is “brought to the birth” – delivered in multiple senses of the word – he or she enters upon a much larger existence, seeing “the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Cor. 4:6), hearing the voice of God with the ears of the spirit, feeling the love of Christ and the empowering guidance of the Holy Spirit, “and all his spiritual senses are then exercised to discern spiritual good and evil.”[19]\n\nWesley brings Johannine and Pauline streams of thought together as he considers the “new birth.” Here Romans 6:1-23 plays an important role – and its contents appear frequently throughout Wesley’s preaching. A new birth is necessary because a death is also necessary – the death of “our old self” that lived enslaved to self-centered passions and, thus, to sin (Rom. 6:5-6). This death is prerequisite to the flourishing of the “newness of life” (Rom. 6:4) into which the new birth initiates us. Christ’s death and resurrection for us becomes thus something in which we are invited to participate, a means by which to leave behind one way of life and step fully into another, one in which we give our lives-in-the-body over to doing what pleases God rather than continue to use the same to serve ourselves (Rom. 6:12-14). Here again we see the seriousness with which Wesley took Paul’s vision for the life of those whom God had redeemed: there was no room for “continuing in sin” (Rom. 6:1) and splitting one’s devotion between God and self (or “sin”; 6:15-16); the proper response to God’s grace was to use one’s redeemed life fully in service to God, in righteousness and holiness. Romans 6:23 has been isolated as one of the paving stones on the “Romans Road,” that familiar, if severely truncated, tool for evangelism: “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (NIV). Wesley deserves credit for holding this verse to its immediate context: “But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life” (Rom. 6:22, NIV). The gift of God is a new life that God empowers, a life for which God has liberated sin’s captives – a life of holiness that leads to eternal life. The genuine Romans Road brooks no detours around sanctification.\n\nThe “new birth” is the gateway to sanctification, that process by which we “grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ” (Eph. 4:15). But this new life must be sustained, even as natural life must be sustained. Wesley speaks therefore of a kind of spiritual “respiration” that sustains the life of the new person. God now continually breathes God’s Spirit into the soul – the work of “sanctifying grace” – and, “as it is continually received [by the believer] by faith, so it is continually rendered back by love, by prayer, and praise, and thanksgiving. And by this new kind of spiritual respiration, spiritual life is not only sustained but increased day by day, together with spiritual strength and motion and sensation; all the senses of the soul being now awake, and capable of ‘discerning’ spiritual ‘good and evil’. [20]\n\nThis God-ward orientation is essential to the life of the “new person” that begins with the “new birth.” The believer who preserves an ongoing awareness of God’s grace and reception of God’s Spirit, and who “by a kind of spiritual re-action returns the grace he receives in unceasing love, and praise, and prayer,” is thereby kept – and keeps himself or herself – from sin. Here 1 John plays a central role in Wesley’s understanding of the good news.\n\nNo one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him…. Those who have been born of God do not sin, because God’s seed abides in them; they cannot sin, because they have been born of God. (1 John 3:6, 9, NRSV)\n\nThe believers who keep the love of God in Christ ever in view, who maintain constant communion with God in inward conversation, “cannot voluntarily transgress any command of God, either by speaking or acting what he knows God hath forbidden,” since the divine “seed,” which Wesley identifies as “that loving, praying, thankful faith,” will not permit them to do what would offend the Father they love and whose love they have known.[21] Where sin happens, it is a consequence of not “keeping” ourselves in the knowledge and experience of God’s love and presence, not remaining in constant communion with God in our thoughts and intentions: “so long as ‘he that is born of God keepeth himself’ (which he is able to do, by the grace of God) ‘the wicked one toucheth him not’.”[22]\n\nSaved on the Basis of Faith\n\nThe benefits of both justification and sanctification – of pardon for what is past and holiness for the time that remains in the body – are given to those who trust God’s promise to provide the same in Jesus Christ. That is to say, “faith” is the only thing required of human beings. There is no precondition for faith: we can never be sufficiently religious, good, or contrite “to merit acceptance”;[23] we can only believe, accept the gift of pardon and restoration to God’s favor, and live thenceforward “no longer for ourselves but for him who died and was raised on our behalf” (2 Cor. 5:15). But this faith must be more than “a bare assent to this proposition, ‘Jesus is the Christ;’ … indeed to all the propositions contained in our creed, or in the Old and New Testament.”[24] Even demons have faith of this kind.[25] It must also involve “a sure trust in the mercy of God through Christ Jesus,” and a trust of a very personal kind: not merely that “‘God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their former trespasses’” but also, in particular, that the Son of God “‘loved me and given himself for me’,” with the result that “I, even I, am now reconciled to God by the blood of the cross.”[26] Faith that consists of this genuine reliance upon and trust in Christ’s love and self-giving death, moreover, “cannot fail to show evidently the power of him that inspires it, by delivering his children from the yoke of sin, and ‘purging their consciences from dead works’; by strengthening them so that they are no longer constrained to ‘obey sin in the desires thereof’; but instead of ‘yielding their members unto’ it, ‘as instruments of unrighteousness’, they now ‘yield’ themselves entirely ‘unto God, as those that are alive from the dead’.”[27] In short, the quality of the faith concerning which it can be said, “you have been saved by faith” (Eph. 2:8), is “faith expressing itself through love” (Gal. 5:6). “Whosoever has this faith, thus ‘working by love’, is not almost only, but altogether a Christian.”[28]\n\nSaved by the Power of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe Holy Spirit of God, whom Paul also names “the Spirit of God’s Son” (Gal. 4:6) and “the Spirit of Christ” (Rom. 8:9), plays an essential part in the process of turning this “good news” into lived experience. The Holy Spirit brings the good news of God’s pardon, love, and adoption home to the person who will respond with faith (that is, with the quality of faith that Wesley has described as genuine, salutary faith). It is the Spirit that “directly ‘witnesses to my spirit that I am a child of God’; that Jesus Christ hath loved me, and given himself for me; that all my sins are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.”[29] This inward communication of God’s pardoning love for the believer arouses love for God in response and, as a consequence of this, love for all those whom God loves.[30] It is also the basis for the believer’s assurance of having been accepted by God into God’s family and of standing before a God who is ever ready to help him or her live into the fullness of the salvation from sin and salvation for holiness that God has set before him or her.[31] This assurance frees the believer from any servile fear of God, but also manifests itself in honoring God’s kindness by responding to it with a glad heart and full energy rather than “despising the riches of God’s goodness” (Rom. 2:4).\n\nThe Holy Spirit continues to empower and guide the believer toward this end as the agent of the believer’s sanctification. The Spirit nurtures “the mind that was in Christ Jesus” in and among believers (Phil. 2:5), which Wesley considered to be synonymous with the cultivation of “those holy ‘fruits of the Spirit’ which whosoever hath not ‘is none of his’” (cf. Gal. 5:22-23; Rom. 8:9),” enables them to put to death “the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal. 5:24), and “in consequence of that inward change, to fulfil all outward righteousness, ‘to walk as Christ also walked’, in the ‘work of faith, the patience of hope, the labour of love’ (1 Thess. 1:3).”[32] Wesley believed Paul when he wrote: “Keep walking in the Spirit, and you will surely not carry out the cravings of the flesh” (Gal. 5:16, my translation). The first clause issues a command; the second assures the doer of the certain results of obeying the command.[33] The Spirit makes a life of holiness genuinely practicable. He also believed Paul when he wrote: “Don’t deceive yourselves…. Whatever a person sows, that’s what he or she will harvest. Those who continue to sow to their own flesh will harvest only decomposition from the flesh; those who continue to sow to the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit” (Gal. 6:7-8, my translation). A long obedience under the direction of the Spirit was precisely the path to final salvation.\n\nSo important was this work of the Spirit in the heart and life of the believer that Wesley identified the Holy Spirit, given to those who trust in Jesus, as “this great salvation from sin,”[34] the great gift divine that would enable each believer and the community of believers together to realize what is truly meant in the word “Christianity,” rather than its pale shadows evident everywhere in Wesley’s England.[35] Once again, it was not Wesley’s optimism about what is possible for human beings to achieve that drove his understanding of the full scope of the good news in Jesus Christ; it was his confidence in the power of the Holy Spirit to empower believers “to love God and their neighbour with a love which is as ‘a well of water, springing up into everlasting life’,” to lead them “onto every holy desire, into every divine and heavenly temper, till every thought which arises in their heart is holiness unto the Lord.”[36] The good news is also thus not something to be merely believed, but to be experienced and lived as it transformed the believer and, through him or her, also worked to transform the conditions of those who, in the believer’s sphere of influence, would be impacted by the believer’s Spirit-directed and other-centered life.\n\nThe transformation that the Holy Spirit brings about in the believer’s life becomes, in turn, a second source of assurance for believers. Their obedience to God’s commandments (“the doing good to all men, the doing no evil to any, and the walking in the light” which supported “the answer of a good conscience toward God”), the transformation of their character in the direction of “the mind that was in Christ Jesus,” and the manifestation of the “fruit of the Spirit” would all provide the diagnostics that would confirm that the Holy Spirit was genuinely at work in them and, thus, that they had indeed been accepted as children of God, their heavenly Parent whose image they were growing increasingly to resemble.[37]\n\n“Saved to the Uttermost”: Christian Perfection\n\nSo great was Wesley’s confidence in the power of the Holy Spirit that he fully believed that God could make the vision for Christian life expressed in the Scriptures a reality in the experience of all believers who fully gave themselves over to the Spirit’s work. The goal came to be known as “Christian perfection,” reflecting the seriousness with which Wesley took Jesus’s own charge to his disciples: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48, NIV). While the name led to grave misunderstandings both on the part of those who embraced and those who opposed this ideal, Wesley himself was quite clear concerning what “Christian perfection” was and was not. It did not promise perfection of knowledge, whether of God or the Scriptures on the one hand or of people and their circumstances and motivations on the other, for believers would always be subject to error and misperception – and “from wrong judgments wrong words and actions will often necessarily flow.”[38] It did not promise freedom from the weaknesses imposed by our physical nature, from temptation, or even from the need to continue ever to “grow in grace.”[39]\n\nChristian perfection involved nothing more and nothing less than the full realization in experience of what Wesley read in the New Testament texts, believing also as he did that “a promise is implied in every commandment of God,” that is, that God had commanded nothing that God would not also empower.[40] Wesley grounds this expectation also in explicit promises from God, notably drawing upon texts from the Old Testament that he read as early announcements of God’s plan to restore human beings.\n\nThe LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may live. (Deut. 30:6, NRSV)\n\nI will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. (Ezek. 36:25-27, NRSV).[41]\n\n“Christian perfection” is thus itself also ultimately sought and received on the basis of faith, for the one who would attain it must first believe that God promised it, that “what God hath promised he is able to perform,” and, finally, that “He is able and willing to do it now.”[42]\n\nWesley described “the sum of Christian perfection” as arriving at a place where one truly and consistently lived out the twin commandments that Jesus elevated as the weightiest, the second of which Paul also singled out as the one commandment in which all the others were fulfilled: “You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deut. 6:5); “you shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Lev. 19:18; see also Matt. 22:37-40; Mark 12:29-31; Gal. 5:14).[43] This twinned love becomes the driving impulse of the believer’s life, indeed to the exclusion of every contrary impulse. “Christian perfection” could also be conceived of as living consistently from “the mind … that was also in Christ Jesus,” applied not only “to the humility of our Lord,” but extended “so as to include the whole disposition of his mind, all his affections, all his tempers, both toward God and man,”[44] with the result that the believer now “walk[s] in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us” (Eph. 5:2, ESV). Paul had arrived at the place where he could exclaim “it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me” (Gal. 2:20, NRSV); Paul longed and labored to see “Christ formed” similarly in his own converts (Gal. 4:19). The good news was that the Spirit could and would indeed bring this to pass in all who believe, such that the believer’s affections, intentions, and actions consistently reflected the presence of Christ, “the righteous one,” living in and through him or her – and thus restoring the believer to righteousness as well! Such would mark the decisive putting aside of “your former way of life, … your old self,” and the putting on of “the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph. 4:22-24),[45] with the expectation of continuing in this new state, “blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thess. 5:23).[46]\n\nWesleyan scholar William Abraham acknowledges that “the attainment of perfection involves a radical spiritual reorientation beyond conversion.”[47] But the authors of the New Testament call for precisely such a “radical reorientation” as an indispensable facet of deliverance, of “salvation.” One might think of Paul’s statement concerning Christ’s purpose in his death: “he died for all in order that those who continued living might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised on their behalf” (2 Cor. 5:15). Clearly Christ’s self-giving death had not only the forgiveness of sins in view but also the “radical reorientation” of the remainder of one’s life such as would restore the God-centered orientation that ought always to have characterized the creature. This is what it means that God should “save to the uttermost them that come unto God through him,”[48] that is, through Jesus – to be saved not merely from the penalty of sin, nor even from its power, but ultimately from its very presence in the lives of those Christ has redeemed and the Spirit has filled with the very life of Christ. It is this larger view of salvation, one that includes the Spirit’s transforming work within us in the interim between “the hour I first believed” and “when this flesh and heart shall fail,” that allowed Charles Wesley to speak of arriving at “Christian perfection” as salvation:\n\nFinish, then, thy new creation,\n\nPure and spotless less us be;\n\nLet us see thy great salvation\n\nPerfectly restored in thee;\n\nChanged from glory into glory….[49]\n\nSalvation begins with justification and the new birth; it attains its mark when we are “perfectly restored” to God’s image and character (reflected, for example, in the fruit of the Spirit) as a result of being “in” Christ; it is consummated when\n\n… in heaven we take our place,\n\n… [and] cast our crowns before thee,\n\nLost in wonder, love, and praise.”\n\nIt thus carries with it the hope, indeed the assurance, of the verdict of being recognized as “righteous” on that day (that is, at the Last Judgment), since God will recognize Christ, “the righteous One,” in all those whom the Spirit has thus transformed.[50]\n\nAs with the whole process of sanctification, it would be entirely wrong to regard “Christian perfection” as an obligation laid upon believers’ shoulders to attain by their own efforts (though diligent efforts worthy of the label “spiritual disciplines” would certainly be required).[51] It remains, rather, a gracious promise, a work that God greatly desires to accomplish in believers by the power of God’s Spirit. It marks the attainment of another stage in the saga of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration, chiefly as the restoration of the image of God in human beings – which is thus also “the mind that was in Jesus Christ,” who is the image of the invisible God (Phil. 2:5; Col. 1:15) – reflected in all that these human beings think, desire, and do in God’s world. Human beings are at last as they were always meant to be, and the experience of all human beings is elevated as a result.\n\n“Living a life worthy of the gospel”\n\nWesley was so intent that those whom God had redeemed should “conduct [them]selves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ” (Phil. 1:27) that it can fairly be said that there is no genuine reception of the “Wesleyan gospel” apart from the wholesale re-orientation of the life of the one who embraces it. It calls us into a life of intentional discipleship, banding us together to help one another recognize and die fully to the life of the “old person,” who has been deformed by sin and the structures within which it took shape, and to learn to walk consistently in “newness of life” (Rom. 6:4), using all the spiritual disciplines and means of grace bequeathed to us by the rich heritage of the Christian tradition. It calls for rigorous commitment to discover the full dimensions of the life of the new person that are opened up through the power of the Holy Spirit, that precious gift divine, and it calls us to “let perseverance” in this commitment “attain its full effect, in order that [we] may be mature (‘perfect’!) and complete, lacking in no respect” (Jas. 1:4, my translation). It calls us not merely to “accept Christ,” but to have “the mind that was in Christ” – to live a life devoted to serving the interests of others (Phil. 2:3-5), not just by divesting ourselves of all the practices and entanglements that perpetuate harm but by investing ourselves in “doing good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers” (Gal. 6:10), relieving the needs of, restoring the dignity of, and otherwise extending God’s kingdom work in and among one’s neighbors to the fullest extent of our capacity and imagination.\n\nFurther Reflections\n\nIt has been apparent throughout this discussion that, on the one hand, all that God would accomplish for and in us reflects God’s gracious initiatives while, on the other hand, God’s grace must find us responsive and intent on giving due attention to the Giver and his sustaining help. While some would criticize Wesley for promoting a “synergistic” model of salvation, it would be more accurate to say that Wesley had recovered a proper, contextual understanding of the inseparability of grace and response to grace that shaped all New Testament reflection on how God’s grace became effective for the transformation of its recipients.[52] It is in the person who reminds fully mindful of God’s grace – maintaining his or her awareness of the “unceasing presence of God, the loving, pardoning God, manifested to the heart, and perceived by faith” – and who is fully responsive to grace – making an “unceasing return of love, praise, and prayer, offering up all the thoughts of our hearts, all the words of our tongues, all the works of our hands, all our body, soul, and spirit, to be an holy sacrifice, acceptable unto God in Christ Jesus” – that God’s grace attains its full effect.[53] For God’s favor has a purpose: not only to “redeem us from all iniquity” but also to “purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds” (Tit. 2:14) or, in other Pauline terms, to create the believer anew, to allow God to put God’s hand to the clay that is our essence a second time and make us fully “God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do” (Eph. 2:10, NIV).\n\n[1] John Wesley, Sermon 7.II.8 (WJW 1:229).\n\n[2] And here, in keeping with Paul’s indictment of his own people in Rom. 2:16-29, one must simply acknowledge that, throughout the history of the past two millennia, many who identified themselves as “Christians” – who bore the name of and represented God’s provision for setting things right with human beings and human experience – have not only failed to advance God’s goals but, in fact, have so frequently done the opposite that the name of God has fallen into disrepute because of them.\n\n[3] Quotations taken from verses 2 and 5 of the hymn “Amazing Grace” by John Newton, published in John Newton and William Cowper, Olney Hymns: In Three Books (Glasgow: William Collins, 1829), 101-102.\n\n[4] See, e.g., Sermon 5.III.3 (WJW I.191): “He saves from the guilt of sin (and at the same time from the power) sinners of every kind”; Sermon 6.proem.3 (WJW I.204): “‘Believe and thou shalt be saved;’ now saved both from the guilt and power of sin, and of consequence from the wages of it.”\n\n[5] Sermon 6.I.10 (WJW I.208).\n\n[6] Sermon 43.I.3 (WJW 2.157).\n\n[7] Sermon 5.II.5 (WJW I.189); see most especially Rom. 4:7-8.\n\n[8] Sermon 1.II.2-4 (WJW I.121-123); 8.II.1-2 (WJW I.237-238).\n\n[9] Sermon 5.II.4 (WJW I.188).

Not so: we are already pardoned and accepted through the mercy of God in Christ Jesus—not as if we were by our own obedience to procure life, life from the death of sin. This also we have already through the grace of God. ‘Us hath he quickened, who were dead in sin.’ And now we are ‘alive to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord’. But we rejoice in walking according to the covenant of grace, in holy love and happy obedience. We rejoice in knowing that ‘being justified through his grace’, we have ‘not received that grace of God in vain’; that God having freely (not for the sake of our willing or running, but through the blood of the Lamb) reconciled us to himself, we run in the strength which he hath given us the way of his commandments” (Sermon 12.20 [WJW I.312-13]).\n\n[17] Sermon 45.I.4 (WJW II.190).\n\n[18] Sermon 45.proem.1 (WJW II.187).

There is an important discrepancy in the textual tradition of this verse, namely the direct object of the clause “the one begotten of God keeps.” In Codex Sinaiticus and the text known to Origen, the object is the reflexive “himself” (as in the KJV and CEB); in Codices Vaticanus and Alexandrinus, the object is “him” (as in the NRSV, NIV, and NLT), so that the subject of the clause is now read as Christ (who can also be described as “the one begotten of God”). Wesley’s Bible followed the former textual tradition.\n\n[23] Sermon 6.3.1-4 (WJW I.214-15).\n\n[24] Sermon 18.I.2-3 (WJW I.418-19); see also Sermon 7.II.10 (WJW I.230).\n\n[25] Sermon 2.II.4 (WJW I.138); Sermon 1.I.2 (WJW I.119-20); see Jas. 2:19.\n\n[26] Sermon 7.II.10 (WJW I.230), quoting 2 Cor. 5:19 and Gal. 2:20 (as also in Sermon 43.II.2 [WJW 2.161]).\n\n[27] Sermon 17.I.8 (WJW I.406), quoting Heb. 9:14 and Rom. 6:12-13.\n\n[28] Sermon 2.II.6 (WJW I.139).\n\n[29] Sermon 10.I.7 (WJW I.274), quoting Rom. 8:16 and recontextualizing Gal. 2:20.

Wesley understood the promise of the elder that “you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth” (1 John 2:20) to pertain only to matters necessary for salvation and not to matters of theological speculation (Sermon 40.I.1-2 [WJW II.100-101]).\n\n[39] Sermon 40.I.7-9 (WJW II.103-105).\n\n[40] Sermon 76.II.11 (WJW III.80). This might perhaps have arisen as an inference of the future indicative tense with which many commandments (e.g., the greatest two) are expressed as opposed to the bare imperative.\n\n[41] These appear at the climax of the sermon “On Christian Perfection” (40.II.29; WJW II.120-21). See also the references to Deut. 30:6 and Jer. 31:31-34 as promises upon which to build such a hope in Sermon 76.II.1-2 (WJW III.76-77).\n\n[42] Sermon 43.III.15-16 (WJW II.167-68).\n\n[43] Sermon 76.I.4 (WJW III.74).\n\n[44] Sermon 76.I.5 (WJW III.74).\n\n[45] See Sermon 76.I.7 (WJW III.75). William Abraham claims with no little justification that “Wesley’s aggressive optimism of grace fits much more aptly with the witness of Scripture and the wider canonical heritage of the church than does the systematic pessimism of Luther or Calvin or the sombre moderation of Anglicanism” (“Christian Perfection,” pp. 587-601 in The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies [ed. James E. Kirby and William J. Abraham; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011], 598).\n\n[46] Sermon 76.I.9 (WJW III.75). It is worth noting that, in his final months, Wesley reflected upon this particular teaching as “the grand depositum which God has lodged with the people called Methodists; and for the sake of propagating this chiefly He appeared to have raised us up” (John Wesley, Letter to Robert Carr Brackenbury, September 15, 1790, in John Wesley, The Letters of John Wesley. Volume 8, ed. John Telford [8 vols.; London: Epworth Press, 1931], 238).\n\n[47] Abraham, “Christian Perfection,” 588.\n\n[48] Sermon 76.III.12 (WJW III.87), quoting Heb. 7:25.\n\n[49] Charles Wesley, “Love Divine, All Loves Excelling” (WJW VII.546-547).\n\n[50] See Sermon 15.V.5 (WJW I.375): “Why should one of you be found on the left hand at his appearing? He ‘willeth not that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance’; by repentance to faith in a bleeding Lord; by faith to spotless love, to the full image of God renewed in the heart, and producing all holiness of conversation” (that is, “of conduct”). The context of Matthew 25:31-46 (a vision of judgment) supports Wesley’s implicit claim here that the journey towards a fullness of love, not only for God but also for neighbor, is an indispensable facet of the fuller journey from conversion to approbation when “we all will stand before the judgment seat of Christ” (2 Cor. 5:9, the text on which the sermon is based).\n\n[51] This is the subject of the important sermons “The Circumcision of the Heart” (Sermon 17 [WJW I.401-414]) and “Self-Denial” (Sermon 48 [WJW II.238-250]), but also undergirded the whole of the Methodist program of society, class, and band meetings; frequent participation in the Lord’s Supper; daily study of the Word, prayer, and self-examination; and commitment to devote oneself to works of mercy (both those that tended to one’s neighbors’ physical and spiritual needs).\n\n[52] On this point, see D. A. deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship & Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2000), 95-156; more briefly, ibid., The Letter to the Galatians (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2018), 254-262. See also J. M. G. Barclay, Paul and the Power of Grace (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2020).\n\n[53] Sermon 19.III.2 (WJW I.442).\n\n(forthcoming in some book 🙂 )\n\nThe collection known as the Old Testament Apocrypha exists as a discrete and identifiable body of works as a result of the reading practices of the Christian churches throughout the centuries and the different decisions made concerning the level of authority to be accorded to these particular texts in different Christian circles (related, in part, to the different degrees of value placed upon the Jewish community’s – that is, the parent religion’s – decisions about what texts ought to enjoy canonical authority). The question of canonical authority, however, is secondary to the phenomenon of the expansive use and evident influence of these texts in the Christian movement from its inception.\n\nInfluence at the Earliest Stages\n\nWe can speak of “use” with confidence where we have explicit citations of these texts, but the evidence for “influence” pushes considerably earlier, indeed, even to the Judean and Galilean milieu of Jesus himself. Citation of a text by name (or less precisely with an introductory remark like “as it is written” or “as the scripture says”) already presumes, on the part of the writer, the expectation that the text ought to be accorded some level of authority by the audience, such that explicitly drawing attention to the fact of reciting the older text should carry persuasive or argumentative weight. None of the authors of the New Testament introduce passages from the books that come to be called “Apocrypha” in this manner, which strongly suggests that they did not expect their audiences to recognize the first-level authority of these texts that they would assume (require?) for Deuteronomy, Isaiah, or the Psalms.[1] Indeed, it suggests that these authors themselves did not accord such authority to Tobit, Ben Sira, Wisdom of Solomon, and the rest. That said, however, it seems evident that they used these texts or, at the very least, that these texts were used sufficiently in their own contexts that they could become familiar with, approve, and incorporate a broad range of the material found therein.\n\nJesus famously taught his followers that the most prudent use of wealth was to use it to relieve the pressing needs of those around them:\n\n“Don’t lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust ruin and where thieves break in and steal; rather, lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust ruins and where thieves neither break in nor steal.” (Matt. 6:19-20)\n\n“Sell your belongings and give alms: provide for yourselves moneybags that don’t wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where a thief doesn’t approach nor does a moth spoil.” (Luke 12:33)\n\nWhile the Law of Moses prescribed charity toward the poor and the prophets reinforced this as an essential practice, the second-century B.C.E. scribe and teacher Yeshua ben Sira promoted a commitment to charity as the best way in which to “lay up a treasure” for oneself:\n\n“For the commandment’s sake, help a poor person; don’t send him or her away empty-handed because of their lack of means [to repay]. Deprive yourself of silver on account of a brother and a friend, and don’t allow it to rust under a stone unto destruction. Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the Highest, and it will prove more advantageous to you than gold. Stash away almsgiving in your storerooms, and this will deliver you from every hardship.” (Sir. 29:9–12)\n\nSeveral points of contact emerge. Both teach that the way to amass a lasting treasure is not through hoarding one’s possessions, but rather through sharing them with neighbors in need. Ben Sira and Jesus further promote this shift in savings strategy by pointing to the vulnerability of the pile of possessions that sit idle that can end up lost and unfruitful.\n\nJesus is also remembered to have taught that our experience of God’s forgiveness of our sins depends in some way upon our willingness to extend forgiveness to other people. This is enshrined within the Lord’s Prayer (undoubtedly the Jesus tradition most familiar to the greatest number of Christians!): “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors” (Matt 6:12; cf. Luke 11:4). In Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus gives further comment on this petition (and this petition only): “For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive people, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses” (Matt 6:14-15). This teaching is further reinforced in the parable of the unforgiving servant (Matt 18:21-35). A slave who owes his master a tremendous debt is forgiven that debt rather than thrown into prison till the debt be (impossibly) repaid. He then goes out and has a fellow slave cast into prison over a modest debt. Upon hearing of this, the master reinstates the debt of the first slave and hands him over to the torturers till his debt be repaid. Jesus concludes solemnly: “Thus also will my heavenly Father do to you, unless you forgive – each his or her brother or sister – from your hearts” (Matt 18:35).[2]\n\nThis is a claim without precedent in the Hebrew Bible, though not without precedent in earlier Jewish literature. Ben Sira had taught his students a very similar lesson:\n\nThe vengeful person will experience the Lord’s vengeance;\n\nthe Lord will surely remember that person’s sins.\n\nForgive your neighbor a wrong\n\nand then, when you are praying, your sins will be dismissed.\n\nDoes a person treasure anger against another person,\n\nand seek healing from the Lord?\n\nHe doesn’t have mercy on a person like himself,\n\nand he makes petition concerning his own sins?\n\nHe himself, being mere flesh, treasures anger;\n\nwho will propitiate for his sins? (Sir 28:1-5)\n\nBen Sira provides a clear rationale for the claims he is making: since God’s honor is incomparably greater than our own, we must not treat affronts to our honor (concerning which we cherish grudges and for which we seek satisfaction) as more weighty than our affronts to God’s honor. To do otherwise would be to offer God a double insult. The reasoning embedded in Jesus’ parable is very similar, expressed however using the financial metaphor of “debt” to speak about affronts to honor. Ben Sira, moreover, has already articulated both the warning and the assurance that stand behind Jesus’ own reinforcement of the petition, “forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors” (Matt 6:14-15).[3]\n\nI dwell here on these examples to stress that the texts of the Apocrypha were used and exercised influence even in circles where they were not generally accorded canonical authority – and several were in a position to exercise such influence upon the founding leaders of the Christian movement. Ben Sira was particularly well situated to exercise such influence. He was a respected teacher, the head of a school in Jerusalem in the early part of the second century B.C.E., who had committed a sizeable sampling of his instruction to writing. It continued to be read in the land of Israel. Physical evidence for this exists in the form of a small fragment of his work found among the Dead Sea Scrolls and a fragment containing several chapters found at Masada.[4] Literary evidence for this exists in the form of the clear imprint his work has left in rabbinic literature, where it is sometimes (against the prevailing view, to be sure) cited as carrying scriptural authority.[5] It should come as no surprise, therefore, that some of Ben Sira’s teachings may have filtered through to pious Jews, like the family of Jesus and his brothers, who were raised and taught in the synagogues of Judea and Galilee. This particular text, however, was also made available to Greek-speaking Jews in Egypt by virtue of the efforts of Ben Sira’s grandson, who translated it “for those living abroad who wished to gain learning and are disposed to live according to the law” (Prologue to Ben Sira, NRSV), thence to be disseminated first to other Greek-speaking Diaspora communities and then to the assemblies of Christ-followers who were birthed therefrom.\n\nThe Use of the Apocrypha for Ethical Guidance\n\nThe books of the Apocrypha would continue to be mined by the early church for the ethical value of the instructions included therein, perhaps motivated in part by the growing recognition on the part of its leaders of the consonance of these instructions with the ethical teachings of Jesus, James, and other voices preserved in the texts that were emerging as part of a New Testament canon. Indeed, the New Testament texts could be seen to endorse a good deal of material found in the books of the Apocrypha but not explicitly present in the books of the Hebrew Bible. This might help to account for the elevation of the value of the former alongside the latter in early Christian communities (who were clearly open to affirming the value and even authority of texts outside the emerging Jewish canon, given the very fact of a New Testament).\n\nThe promotion of almsgiving, the rationales for the practice, and the specific advice found in Tobit and Ben Sira, for example, continue to appear in early Christian exhortations. Thus Polycarp in the early second century echoes Tobit’s promise that “charity delivers one from death” (Polycarp, Phil. 10.2; cf. Tob. 4:10).[6] The nearly contemporary church manual known as the Didache admonishes Christians not to be like “one who stretches out the hands to receive but withdraws them when it comes to giving” (Didache 4.5; see also Epistle of Barnabas 19.9), repeating Ben Sira’s instructions (Sir. 4:31); Didache 1.6 also cites a proverb, “Let your gift sweat in your hands until you know to whom you give,” which recalls an admonition from Ben Sira: “If you do good, know to whom you do it, and you will be thanked for your good deeds” (Sir. 12:1). The older sage had advised showing charitable generosity only to the righteous poor; the compilers of the Didache utilize the proverb to urge being a good steward of charity, taking care to bestow it on the genuinely needy. Both Ben Sira and Tobit had promoted almsgiving as an atonement for sins (Sir. 3:30; Tob. 12:9), a motivation that also persists in Christian teaching (Did. 4.6). Gaudentius of Brescia (fl. 395) shows how well the ethical teaching of Tobit and Jesus might be combined in the early church as affirms the atoning power of almsgiving and connects this with Jesus’ parable of the rich man and Lazarus: “Not out of malice but out of providence has God made you rich. He intended that through your works of mercy you would again find medicine to treat the wounds of your sins. ‘Certainly alms freely given preserve one from death and purify from every sin.’ The rich man was not tormented because he was rich but because Lazarus suffered hunger while he feasted.”[7] Examples of how Ben Sira and Tobit’s ethical precepts pervaded early Christian discourse could be multiplied exponentially.[8]\n\nEarly Christian writers frequently look to the characters encountered in the Apocrypha as models for piety (which was itself a cardinal value in Greco-Roman ethics). Already at the end of the first century, Clement of Rome presents Judith alongside Esther as examples of women who, “being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed many manly deeds” (1 Clem. 55.3), pointing to their piety as the root of their strength. He was clearly reading the expanded, Greek edition of Esther, for he marks Esther’s preparation, how “through her fasting and her humiliation she entreated the all-seeing Master, the God of the ages” (1 Clem. 55.4-6). Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-215) similarly holds up Esther, with her “perfect prayer to God,” as a model of the faith and service to the cause of God and his people to which Christians of both genders can attain (Strom. 4.19). His student, Origen (c. 185-254), likewise points to Tobit and Azariah as models for proper prayer, mingling petition with praise of God, though he adds the example of Hannah from 1 Samuel specifically because the authority of the additions to Daniel and of Tobit are disputed ( On Prayer 14.4). Cyprian of Carthage (fl. 250) commends the example of Tobit to parents among his congregations, who should be as attentive to giving their children sound instructions for life and piety (Works and Almisgiving 20).\n\nA number of texts from the Apocrypha not only modeled prayer for the faithful but entered into early Christian liturgical practice. Most notable among these is the Prayer of Manasseh, a moving penitential psalm, that is preserved and prescribed for use in the Didascalia (3rd c.) and the Apostolic Constitutions (4th c.). The Prayer of Manasseh appears alongside the two liturgical additions to Daniel, namely the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, in a book entitled “Odes” in the fifth-century Greek Bible now known as Codex Alexandrinus. The book consists of liturgical pieces culled from the whole of scripture (along with an additional “Morning Hymn”) and appears immediately following the book of Psalms as a kind of early “hymnal supplement.”\n\nA cluster of texts among the Apocrypha address the issue of Gentile religious practice and seek to reinforce their Jewish (especially Diaspora Jewish) readers’ insulation against thinking that there might be something to such practice, since so many of their neighbors carry out their rites with such evident devotion. These texts would include the Letter of Jeremiah (a short but potent tirade), portions of Wisdom of Solomon 13-15 (a more thoughtful attempt at deconstruction), and the tale of Bel and the Dragon (a more satirical, even farcical, presentation of the theme). Christian leaders found these works equally suitable for encouraging the Christian heirs to the Jewish commitment to one and only one God to persevere in abstaining from the religious practices around them (indeed, that many of them had personally left behind). Wisdom of Solomon sought to delegitimate Greco-Roman idolatrous cults by explaining their very human origins, for example in the desire of the bereaved to memorialize their dead or the desire to flatter monarchs. These explanations reappear in the work of Minucius Felix (Octavius 20.5; c. 200) and Lactantius (Inst. 2.2–3; c. 300). It is difficult to demonstrate a direct link, but the fact that Wisdom was widely read in the early church makes it the most likely source. Writing in the second century, Aristides drew upon the scathing logic of Letter of Jeremiah in his assault on Greco-Roman practice, centered on the impotence of idols to help themselves. Their neighbors “shut [their gods] up together in shrines, and worship them, calling them gods, even though they have to guard them securely for fear they should be stolen by robbers. . . . If their gods are unfit to look after their own safety, how shall they bestow protection upon others?” (Apologia 3; cf. Let. Jer. 18, 49, 57–58). After his own conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century, Firmicus Maternus also attacked pagan religion reciting portions of the Letter of Jeremiah (De errore profanarum religionum 28.4–5; cf. Let. Jer. 5–10, 21–24, 28–31, 50–57).[9]\n\nIt was, of course, precisely this withdrawal from their neighbors’ gods – this flagrant display of atheism, as their neighbors counted it – that early Christians from Gentile backgrounds met with increasing hostility. Here, too, their shepherds found a great deal of inspiration and encouragement from the books of the Apocrypha to help them remain firm in their loyalty and commitment. Tertullian (c. 225) recites Letter of Jeremiah 6—“Say in your heart, ‘It is you, O Lord, whom we must worship’” —as the unshakable commitment that allowed Daniel’s three companions to face the bitter consequences of refusing to worship Nebuchadnezzar’s idol (Scorpiace 8; cf. Dan. 3:16–18). His near-contemporary Hippolytus read the tale of Susanna allegorically as a depiction of the contest of the early church against its pagan and Jewish antagonists, who sought to denounce and eliminate her. He reads Susanna’s statement of her predicament and stance and finds there the plight of every Christian martyr: “I am completely trapped. For if I do this, it will mean death for me; if I do not, I cannot escape your hands” (Susanna 22-23, NRSV).[10]\n\nBy far the most important texts for Christian martyrs, however, were 2 Maccabees 6:18-7:42 and 4 Maccabees, which focused on nine Jews who endured grisly tortures to the point of death rather than renounce their loyalty to the covenant God. The story of these martyrs, woven as it was into the larger story of the Maccabean Revolt and the rededication of the Jerusalem Temple celebrated annually during the festival of Hanukkah, were well known in Jewish circles and in early Christian communities. The so-called Letter to the Hebrews was written to Christians who had endured significant deprivation and hardship as a result of their allegiance to Jesus, encouraging them to persevere in that allegiance. As part of his exhortation, the author presents a series of exemplars of faith-in-action. Toward the climax of this segment, he contrasts the faith of those mothers who received back their dead children through resuscitation (as in the stories of the widow of Zarephath in 1 Kgs. 17:17-24 and the Shunammite woman in 2 Kgs. 4:18-37) with that of “others [who] were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection” (Heb. 11:35, NRSV). The author refers here to the martyrs known from 2 Macc 6:18-7:42, especially the seven brothers whose defiance of the tyrant is grounded in their conviction that God will restore their bodies in an everlasting existence as a reward for their faithfulness (2 Macc. 7:9, 11, 14, 23, 29), which is indeed “better” than resuscitation to the moribund life of this age.\n\nAs hostility against the early church rose to the pitch of empire-wide persecutions in the third century, the example of these martyrs became ever more important and useful – even as Christian themselves were increasingly facing similarly gruesome experiences in the course of inquiries and executions. Origen of Alexandria turned to their example during the emperor Maximin’s persecution of Christian clergy (c. 235) in his Exhortation to Martyrdom, written to encourage two young deacons named Ambrose and Protoktetos to remain steadfast in the face of torture and death (see Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 6.28). Origen alternately paraphrased and recited portions of the account of the martyrs’ contest in 2 Macc 6:18-7:42 closely, notably referring to these as examples taken “from the Scripture” (Exh. 27), conferring that level of authority upon 2 Maccabees. Origen also drew upon 4 Maccabees as a secondary resource throughout his Exhortation. That text provided him with the images of the “noble contest” (4 Macc. 16:16) as well as the idea that the martyr’s death represented the “perfection” of a life nobly and faithfully lived (4 Macc. 7:15), both images by which he could encourage the deacons to face martyrdom not as victims but as active contenders and witness-bearers (Exh. 18, 28). Origen also appeals to the same logic that one finds in 4 Maccabees, namely that showing loyalty to God to the point of death is an appropriate expression of gratitude to the Gog who gave the gift of life in the first place (Origen, Exh. 28; 4 Macc. 13:13; 16:18–19).[11] During a persecution launched by Valerian in 256 CE, Cyprian of Carthage also turned to the story of the Maccabean martyrs (from 2 Maccabees) to encourage his congregations to hold fast for the sake of the faith (Exhortation to Martyrdom 11). Their example was so valued that they rose to the stature of Christian saints, celebrated on August 1 – the only pre-Christian figures so honored. While some objected to the practice, both Augustine and Chrysostom defended these martyrs’ right to recognition for having endured so bravely for piety’s sake even before Christ had overcome death and conquered its fearsomeness (thus Chrysostom, Sermon on Eleazar and the Seven Boys, 5; see also Augustine, City of God 18.36).\n\nChristian teachers continued to return to 2 Maccabees 6-7 and, more especially, 4 Maccabees long after Constantine’s edicts of toleration quenched the flames of persecution. With the threat of martyrdom removed, Christian leaders focused more explicitly on the original ethical goal that motivated the author of 4 Maccabees himself, namely to affirm God-centered reason’s mastery over the passions – the emotions, cravings, and sensations that could lead one to relinquish virtue and indulge vice. Ambrose of Milan (d. 397), for example, drew extensively upon 4 Maccabees in his treatise On Jacob and the Blessed Life, promoting virtue and mastery of the passions as the marks of any life that could be called “happy” or “blessed.” He opens his work with an elaborative paraphrase of 4 Macc. 1:1-3:18 (De Jacob 1.1.1-1.3.8) and, after finally discussing the example of the patriarch Jacob, returns to a lengthy reflection upon the contests of the nine martyrs, largely following 4 Maccabees but showing clear awareness of 2 Maccabees as well, to underscore the power that reason can exercise over the flood of the passions (De Jacob 2.10.43-2.12.57). Ambrose, however, appears to draw a distinction between 4 Maccabees and canonical texts: as he transitions from the material he has borrowed and developed from 4 Maccabees, he states his intention to turn next to examples from “Scripture” that will also demonstrate the teachability of particular virtues (De Jacob 1.3.9). This suggests that he did not think himself to be drawing upon “scriptural” resources up to that point. At the same time, the distinction does not diminish the obvious value and utility he believes 4 Maccabees to possess for the edification of his Christian audience.\n\nGregory of Nazianzus (fl. 372-89) and John Chrysostom both preached sermons upon 4 Maccabees, applying its principal lesson to Christian audiences: the example of the martyrs’ victory over the most extreme pains and emotions should spur the hearers on to display the same endurance in resisting “anger, greed, lust, empty pride, and all other such things,” so that they might similarly be crowned before God (Gregory, Or. 15, In Maccabaeorem laudem; John Chrysostom, De Maccabaeos homiliae; De Eleazaro et de septum pueris; quote from Chrysostom, De Maccabaeos homiliae 1, 11). For all his own scruples concerning the precise authority that ought to be ascribed to these texts, Jerome also cites 4 Maccabees as proof that reason can “overcome and rule the disturbances of the soul” (Dialogus adversus Pelagianos 2.6). Fourth Maccabees thus comes to be used to support New Testament authors’ exhortations that Christians should contend against the “self with its passions and desires” (Gal 5:25) and against the “passions that wage war against your soul” (1 Pet 2:11, my translation).[12]\n\nDiscovering Further Prophecies Concerning the Christ and His Work\n\nJust as early Christians pored over the books of the Hebrew canon, reading the texts for intimations of the fulfillment of the scriptural hope that they had found in Jesus the Christ, they gave the same attention to other Jewish texts held in high esteem among them for signs that the shape of Jesus’ Messiahship was indeed the outworking of a divine plan announced long before.\n\nSeveral church fathers seized upon Baruch 3:35–37 as a prophecy of the incarnation – the scandalous notion that the immortal and immutable God would take on physical form: “This is our God; no other can be compared to him. He found the whole way to knowledge, and gave her to his servant Jacob and to Israel, whom he loved. Afterward she [he?] appeared on earth and lived with humankind” (NRSV). The NRSV (rightly) translates the subject of the last verse as “she,” understanding the verse to pick up on the career of “Wisdom.” The Greek, however, does not specify the gender of the subject and most church fathers read the verse as a continuation of the action of God, the subject of the preceding verse. Thus here, according to Irenaeus (for example), we find “the Word of God foretelling from the beginning that God should be seen by human beings and interacting with them on the earth” (Haer. 4.20.4).[13] Here was a prediction not merely of the appearance of a Messiah, but of the coming of a divine being in human flesh.\n\nA passage in the Wisdom of Solomon – a product of the Hellenistic Jewish Diaspora that also has impressive parallels with Pauline texts (compare Rom. 1:18-32 with Wis 13:1–9; 14:22–27) – also attracted considerable attention as a prophecy about the suffering and degrading death that “the righteous one” would suffer.\n\n“Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training. He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord… and boasts that God is his father. Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life; for if the righteous man is God’s child, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries. Let us test him with insult and torture …. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected.” (Wis. 2:12-13, 16-20)\n\nThe author of Wisdom of Solomon was speaking about the mindset that possessed apostate Jews, who had become self-seeking animals, toward the Torah-observant Jews in their midst that were a living reproach to them. His description of the righteous person as God’s son, however, and the plot to impose a shameful death upon this one, led Christians to see herein a reflection – indeed a prediction – of Jesus’ story. Augustine, for example, found “the passion of Christ is most openly prophesied” here in a speech that could just as easily have been uttered by “his impious murderers” (City of God 17.20).[14]\n\nEarly church fathers found not only predictions about Christ but also about the work of the church and the consummation of God’s kingdom in several passages from the Apocrypha (alongside texts from the books of the Hebrew canon). Augustine (Civ. 17.20) read the "
