La controversedebuted on December 15 2018 at the Cartoucherie, the historic headquarters of the company Théâtre du Soleil;on this occasion, for the first time, Ariane Mnouchkine gave up directing to leave the leadership of her company to the award-winning french-canadian director Robert Lepage. With KanataMnouchkine and Lepage want to show the current condition of the Indians of Canada: a community exterminated in five hundred years of colonial history, today marginalized in the reserves, forced to depend on state subsidies and a coercive assimilation in Canadian society.Starting from a historical recognition of the phenomenon, the essay deals with the international controvers that arose from the choice of the directors not to bring indigenous Indians to the stage, instead entrusting the representation of their stories to the actors. In fact, this decision was seen by the First Nations community as a form of ‘cultural appropriation’; concept that is explored through the ‘crisis of presence’ treated by Ernesto de Martino in Il mondo magico, and the idea of ‘proxy reality’, of a substitute politician, which has been exposed by the japanese artist Hito Steyerl.\n\n[English below] L’intégration des technologies audio-visuelles dans le spectacle vivant est une pratique scénique qui, encore fortement discutée dans les années 1990, se présente aujourd’hui comme relativement courante.

Son aspect ultramoderne trouve étonnamment ses prémisses dans les travaux des avant-gardes historiques des années 1920, et cela autant dans les propositions théâtrales d’un Schlemmer et d’un Piscator que dans les recherches cinématographiques signées par Lev Kouléchov, par exemple. Des projections et des captations d’images, des objets robotiques ainsi que toutes sortes d’interfaces et de logiciels introduits sur le plateau, emmènent ce dernier vers de nouvelles voies de créations de nature hybride. La scène se situe au carrefour de différents médias et conjugue la logique numérique avec le processus de création. Par conséquent, le spectacle devient intermédial et accueille sur ce nouveau plateau technologique l’acteur. Ce dernier est alors confronté à un univers mixte qui exige de lui une nouvelle manière d’être sur la scène. Quelle sera sa place dans une représentation qui va au-delà des limites du théâtre ? Une image virtuelle, un robot ou un dispositif complexe seront-ils des partenaires ou des rivaux de l’acteur ? Un spectacle peut-il être finalement conçu sans acteur réel ? Cet ouvrage soulève ces questions fondamentales pour l’art scénique, en se fondant d’une part sur une réflexion théorique (études théâtrales, théorie des médias), et d’autre part sur notre propre expérience de spectateur qui a nourri l’analyse de la cinquantaine de spectacles présentés ici. Il s’agit en particulier des travaux de Robert Lepage, du Wooster Group, de Marcel.lí Antúnez Roca, de LLT Videotear « Poza », de Komuna Otwock. Ce livre propose également une réflexion pédagogique consacrée à la formation des comédiens dans des écoles de théâtre qui sont de plus en plus confrontées aux phénomènes en question. Il est destiné aussi bien aux lecteurs liés au théâtre de manière professionnelle (théorique ou pratique) qu’aux spectateurs déjà initiés aux méandres de la création contemporaine.\n\nThe integration of audio-visual technologies in live performance is a stage practice that, although still highly debated in the 1990s, is now relatively commonplace. Its ultramodern aspect finds its premises in the work of the historical avant-gardes of the 1920s, as much in the theatrical proposals of a Schlemmer and a Piscator as in the cinematographic research of Lev Kouléchov, for example. Projections and image recordings, robotic objects as well as all sorts of interfaces and software introduced on the stage, take the latter towards new creative paths of a hybrid nature. The stage is at the crossroads of different media and combines digital logic with the creative process. Consequently, the performance becomes intermedial and welcomes the actor on this new technological stage. The latter is then confronted with a mixed universe that demands a new way of being on stage. What will be his place in a performance that goes beyond the limits of the theatre? Will a virtual image, a robot or a complex device be the actor's partner or rival? Can a performance ultimately be conceived without a real actor? This book raises these fundamental questions for the performing arts, based on theoretical reflection (theatre studies, media theory) on the one hand, and on our own experience as spectators, which has nourished the analysis of the fifty or so shows presented here. These include the work of Robert Lepage, the Wooster Group, Marcel.lí Antúnez Roca, LLT Videotear \"Poza\" and Komuna Otwock. This book also offers a pedagogical reflection on the training of actors in theatre schools that are increasingly confronted with these phenomena. It is intended both for readers with a professional connection to the theatre (theoretical or practical) and for spectators who are already familiar with the intricacies of contemporary creation.\n\nRobert Lepage, La face cachée de la lune In the South-central District of Montréal, in the premises of the C factory (former industrial ovens transformed today into a multi-functional stage by the founding company Carbon 14), at the... more\n\nRobert Lepage, La face cachée de la lune In the South-central District of Montréal, in the premises of the C factory (former industrial ovens transformed today into a multi-functional stage by the founding company Carbon 14), at the Festival of Theatres des Amerique (2001) Robert Lepage presented The Far Side of the Moon with an original score by Laurie Anderson, in the same year as Kubrick's Space Odyssey. The exploration of the moon by Americans and Russians (up to Galileo Galilei \" mirror of the Earth \" , as it is said in the Prologue) is the metaphor used by Lepage to speak about another search, that of the internal, intimate and private space. It's the story of two brothers, a meteorologist and a doctoral student (but also a subscriptions sale man always fascinated by extraterrestrial investigations). Estranged by their very different life style and dispositions, they meet again for their mother's death. The moon and the mother, with their respective mythical and symbolic apparatus, are the spectacle's two central theme which ceaselessly interlace. The two brothers' life is spattered by \" domestic investigations \" : the circular shape of the astronauts' helmet and that more common, of a washing machine's window blend in a strange exchange which transforms themselves into the maternal uterus, into the image of Earth seen in Tv's whether report, into the Moon, or also into a goldfish tank. Daily life and History, personal recollections and collective memory, both shaped by \" an index \" of image archives, are mingled the one with the other, until they merge. We came to the world like little astronauts who breathe for the firs time after the umbilical cord-back of the new born child, given by the midwife, thanks to which he breathes in his first oxygen blow, setting in the breathing process. Will somebody really manage to build this enormous \" Eiffel Tower \" (reminiscent of Tatlin's Monument for the third international) which, set up beyond the stratosphere, as we are told at the beginning of the spectacle, should be able to pick up what remains a secret to us: the hidden side of the Moon? Which probe will ever manage to discover the most mysterious and repressed side of our Self? ACTOR and MIRROR Autobiography, journey and concrete objects are the inspiring motives of this spectacle: There are two departing points-Lepage explained to us: the first idea was to work on the concept of the Cosmos, and of the Moon, the second was to create something related to my mother, who died two years and a half ago. The two themes didn't seem to be linked at first, but met little by little: the moon is a rich and interesting subject, either for mythology and for the scientific aspect, but mostly it is the symbol of the Mother. It is then that I understood that the first subject could contain the other one.\n\nEver since its beginnings, cinema has found its inspiration in many art forms, and its relationship to the theatre has always been complex.

Alfred Hitchcock showed sustained interest in this ambiguous love-hate relationship and explored the boundaries between theatre and film in many film-mediated dramas. Many Hitchcock films based on stage plays foreground their stage origins rather than hide them, which is true of I Confess (1952). Also stage-bound, Le confessionnal (Robert Lepage, 1995), which was inspired by the work of Alfred Hitchcock in general, and I Confess in particular, pushes back the frontiers of fiction. Indeed, this film deals with the concept of adaptation through intertextual references to I Confess and historical rewriting. Ultimately, Lepage’s film “confesses” its sources of inspiration while exposing cinematic conventions through historical references and reflexive strategies.\n\nIn his film La face cachée de la lune (2003), Robert Lepage uses reflexive strategies to question the transparency of representation and reflect on the relevance of conventions and boundaries.

More particularly, this article examines Lepage's explorations of the boundaries between two cultures: science and art. First, it looks at the ways in which this film distinguishes analogical modes of thinking from empirical knowledge. Then, I examine the parallels that Lepage establishes between both modes of inquiry. By emphasizing the optical properties of the cinematic device, Lepage suggests that both the scientific and the cinematic modes of representation construct only partial visions of the world. However, I argue that Lepage's blurring of worldviews is not merely a meta-representational exploration of the poetics of cinema: it can also be interpreted as a discursive strategy to encourage cultural exchange. Ultimately, Lepage's highlighting of boundaries and optical processes invites spectators to broaden their horizons."
