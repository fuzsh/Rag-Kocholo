He’d performed in the play, then still a one-man show, in the mid-‘90s (Lepage himself acted in the original).\n\n“I’m never really nostalgic about anything,” says Lepage when asked in a phone interview about the remounting. “I’m just always interested in new projects, to wander into some new crazy adventure.” However, despite an initial hesitation he realized that the suggestion to revisit might yield artistic benefits.\n\nHe was sold when he re-read some of Cocteau’s writing, including his 1949 cultural critique A Letter to Americans on which Lepage draws for the show. The post-9/11 world is a changed one, and Cocteau’s words “resounded differently, and lines here and there that hadn’t been used in the first version suddenly made complete sense in this version,” says Lepage.\n\nSo he jumped into the project with Labrèche as collaborator.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe result is a play that, like the original, weaves three stories. There’s Miles Davis in Paris during 1949 falling in love with French chanteuse Juliette Greco. There’s Cocteau, an opium addict just as Davis is a heroin addict, visiting New York the same year. And there’s Robert, decades later, in France to do a voiceover for a documentary about Davis. Devastated by his lover’s desertion, Robert is struggling to withdraw from the addiction that is love.\n\nRevamping the play with a post-millennial sensibility was a massive undertaking because everything in the original had to be questioned, says Lepage.\n\nBut it was also an opportunity to do things like hiring a second performer, Wellesley Robertson III, to play Davis, a character who had not actually been embodied on stage in the original.\n\nLepage also made Robert 20 years older. Making him closer to his own current age (Lepage is 57 and Labrèche 54) gives the character’s breakup with his lover a new gravity, says the playwright. “When you’re young it’s tough to go through a breakup, but they come, they go. If you’re being dumped by your boyfriend or your girlfriend in your late 50s, it’s different.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe’s made other changes. For example, whereas Robert’s voiceover gig in Paris was originally just mentioned in the play’s prologue here it’s a fully developed scene.\n\nMore significant is the new staging, which reflects Lepage’s long-standing fascination with startling visual imagery and the frankly theatrical. He is, after all, the guy who upset many folks’ esthetic apple carts with his high-tech, video-assisted production of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle at New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 2012. He also gave us some memorable effects when The Blue Dragon, written with Marie Michaud and a spinoff of his earlier The Dragon’s Trilogy, played here in 2009.\n\nIn the case of Needles and Opium, those effects include a large, spinning cube inside of which most of the story takes place. “It’s like an (M.C.) Escher painting come to life,” wrote one Toronto reviewer in 2013.\n\nThe entire show, says Lepage, who also directs it, is much more “sculptural” than the original. “Everything is more three-dimensional, the images and writing are more three-dimensional.” That accords with the way the world itself has changed, especially since Coctea\n\nu’s time when, the playwright says, life was more “binary,” a description that includes the divide between blacks and whites and between the old and new worlds of Europe and America.\n\nHere is a trailer for Needles and Opium:\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nLepage – who has amassed a fan base in North America, Asia and Europe and racked up numerous honours including, last year, the prestigious Glenn Gould Award – says he got the idea for the show from a chance conversation with a musician.\n\nLepage already wanted to do something on Cocteau. When he mentioned it, the musician said that Davis was in France at the same time Cocteau was visiting America. In fact, says Lepage, the two journeys occurred a couple of months apart but hey, poetic licence and all that.\n\nWhen he heard about the coincidental journeys, everything began falling into place, and Needles and Opium was born.\n\nThe original French production Les Aiguilles et l’opium premiered during the NAC’s 1991-1992 French theatre season (Lepage was artistic director of French theatre here from 1989 to 1993). The reworked French version of the show is at the NAC until May 23, but the original has apparently never been presented in English at the NAC.\n\nLooking back at the original production in which he acted, Lepage says that while it was naïve, it also required courage to perform. “I’m a very shy person still today, and it asks a lot to go on stage and talk about your own personal stuff and barely disguise it.”\n\nRevamping it two-plus decades later, he realized he now has a much broader creative palette to use. “I’m more confident in a certain way when we start a work, but there’s still a lot of doubt wondering where I’m going.”\n\nNEEDLES AND OPIUM\n\nWhere: NAC Theatre (the show is also part of the Magnetic North Theatre Festival)\n\nWhen: May 27-June 6 (previews May 27 & 28; opening night May 29)\n\nTickets: NAC box office and Ticketmaster outlets, 1-888-991-2787, nac-cna.ca\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nNotice for the Postmedia Network\n\nThis website uses cookies to personalize your content (including ads), and allows us to analyze our traffic.
