        "text": "Critic’s Pick\n\nReview: The Met Opera’s Next ‘Ring’ Will Be a Sea Change\n\nRichard Jones’s bleak staging of Wagner’s “Die Walküre” in London offers a clean break from the extravagance of the Met’s most recent production.\n\nBy Zachary Woolfe\n\nWith a 7-Hour Saga, Robert Lepage Returns to Safer Ground\n\nThe Canadian director’s “The Seven Streams of the River Ota” is set for a world tour, after his most recent productions were embroiled in debates about cultural appropriation.\n\nBy Laura Cappelle\n\nThe Met Opera Cuts Back on Screen Time for Berlioz Next Season\n\nCiting “technical demands,” the company will replace its revival of a video-heavy production of Berlioz’s “La Damnation de Faust” with concert performances.\n\nBy Michael Cooper\n\nCritic’s Notebook\n\nBored of the ‘Ring’\n\nRobert Lepage’s much-warred-over Metropolitan Opera production of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle now makes for decent drama. But it’s still not worth it.\n\nBy Zachary Woolfe\n\nCritic’s Notebook\n\nThe Met Opera’s ‘Ring’ Works Best From the Cheap Seats\n\nRobert Lepage’s production, with a notoriously noisy machine as its centerpiece, benefits from distance, which makes it quieter and more cinematic.\n\nBy Joshua Barone\n\nReview: In the Met’s ‘Siegfried,’ Singers Transcend the Staging\n\nThe third installment of Wagner’s “Ring” has its problems. Robert Lepage’s production for the Metropolitan Opera doesn’t help. But the cast does.\n\nBy Joshua Barone\n\nReview: The Met’s ‘Walküre’ Has a Cast Worth Bragging About\n\nRobert Lepage’s high-tech yet stiff staging of Wagner’s “Ring” opera has returned, led by the blazing soprano Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde.\n\nBy Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim\n\nCritic’s Notebook\n\nThe Father-Daughter Bond at the Heart of Opera’s Greatest Epic\n\nAt the core of the “Ring” is the relationship between Wotan and Brünnhilde. The Metropolitan Opera’s old and new stagings offer divergent approaches.\n\nBy Anthony Tommasini\n\nReview: The Met’s ‘Ring’ Stops Creaking, but Still Doesn’t Work\n\nRobert Lepage’s technically complex staging of Wagner’s four-opera cycle began rolling out on Saturday. While the set works, it’s still empty-headed.\n\nBy Anthony Tommasini\n\nReview: In Robert Lepage’s ‘Kanata,’ the Director, Too, Plays the Victim\n\nThe Canadian stage director has seen some of his productions derailed by accusations of cultural insensitivity. In a new show in Paris, he can’t resist pointing to his own suffering.\n\nBy Laura Cappelle"
