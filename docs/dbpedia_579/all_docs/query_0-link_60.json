        "text": "Quebec's artistic community rounded on playwright Michel Tremblay this week with an attack that was swift, dismissive and deeply unfair.\n\nTremblay had dared to voice some doubts about the realism of the sovereigntist project in a media interview, bemoaning the exclusively economic focus of current debate. In a milieu in which Quebec's need for independence is an orthodoxy, the response was often contemptuous. Writer Victor-Lévy Beaulieu denounced him as a traitor, while in a vicious rebuttal published in Le Devoir, writer Claude Jasmin accused him of being politically immature and miserably out of touch, sarcastically sending the playwright (who spends half the year in Florida) back to his gilded ghetto to eat Key lime pie under the palm trees. Others argued Tremblay's remarks only played into the hands of the federalists.\n\nThankfully, the public was more sensible, often defending Tremblay's right to free speech on phone-in shows and media websites, and sometimes criticizing the unfair pressure on Quebec artists never to deviate from a sovereigntist line. La Presse columnist Marc Cassivi quipped that there was only one closet a Quebec artist could never exit and that was the federalist one. (Like new Parti Québécois leader Andre Boisclair, Tremblay is gay.)\n\nA wounded Tremblay responded by pointing out that he is still a sovereigntist and there should be room in a democratic movement for debate. He argued that the controversy was fuelled by a misleading headline in La Presse that said, \"I no longer believe in sovereignty.\" In French, as in English, believe can be an ambiguous verb: Tremblay, who said Quebec's independence had been \"a beautiful dream\" in its day, doesn't believe sovereignty is going to happen; many interpreted his remarks to mean he didn't believe it should happen.\n\nThe debate was further fuelled when the second most famous man in Quebec theatre expressed similar doubts. The day the Tremblay interview was published, Robert Lepage happened to be giving a press conference as he launched the Montreal run of his one-man show The Andersen Project, and someone asked him about Tremblay's remarks. He sympathized with his colleague, saying he personally needed to have his convictions renewed and noting that he felt like a Quebecker at home but a Canadian abroad. Who knows exactly what that meant, but it was enough for Beaulieu to include Lepage in his accusation of treason.\n\nIt's just silly to question Tremblay's nationalist credentials: The man gave Quebeckers a theatrical voice when he put joual onstage. And how ironic that Beaulieu would also accuse him and Lepage of being international successes who have forgotten their roots: The difficult artistic choice between building a career at home and seeking success abroad was the very subject of Tremblay's 2002 play Impromptu on Nuns' Island in which an international opera star who condescends to her Quebec homeland is ridiculed.\n\nThe apolitical Lepage, on the other hand, has often been a bit cryptic about his beliefs. During the 1995 referendum campaign, he said he had recently come around to the Yes side because he believed Quebec could better position itself globally if it were independent. He is an internationalist rather than a nationalist, and his ambivalence about nationalism is often reflected in his work: The Andersen Project is the latest in a series of his plays that include an alter-ego figure who is a confused Quebec artist looking for himself abroad.\n\nBesides these more outrageous attacks, criticisms of the two dramatists also exposed both a bitter generation gap and a real ideological tension in the nationalist movement. Tremblay would have as much right to call old hard-liners such as Jasmin and Beaulieu dinosaurs as they did him, but younger Quebeckers also labelled the dramatist's distaste for economic discussion naive. How do you build a nation without an economy, asked one Radio-Canada listener. And how do you build a francophone nation without the money to pay for a first-rate education system, asked another.\n\nThe criticism that really stung, however, was a challenge by one Radio-Canada listener writing on the broadcaster's website for both artists to do a better job of reaching out to multicultural communities. Luc Desjardins said these artists should be worried by the utter lack of interest in their work among new Quebeckers, noting that the audiences at Montreal's Théâtre du Nouveau Monde, where Lepage is now performing, are almost exclusively white. When he attended a screening of The Barbarian Invasions, the latest film by another Quebec artistic luminary, Denys Arcand, the all-white audience was in marked contrast to the multicultural crowd on the streets outside the cinema, he said.\n\nAnd there is the real tension in this debate. Tremblay is of an older generation than Lepage, but both represent that formidable flowering of Quebec culture that paradoxically makes sovereignty seem less pressing. It is, however, a garden largely tended and enjoyed by the old Quebeckers, the almost exclusively white elite that does little to reflect multiculturalism in its work. Tremblay's characters are always drawn from the vieille souche; on the other hand, the cosmopolitan world of the bilingual and peripatetic Lepage may seem to bypass Quebec. The Andersen Project includes a minor character who's an alienated North African youth -- but that's in Paris.\n\nThis artistic issue exposes the current sovereigntist paradox: The cultural nationalism of figures like Tremblay is not so far removed from the ethnic nationalism the movement has so carefully disavowed. Focusing attention on the economy avoids the ethnic issue, but as Tremblay was asking, what is the point of an independence movement without a cultural heart. Quebec's artists have always been standard-bearers in the battle for independence; turns out, they may actually be brandishing double-edged swords."
