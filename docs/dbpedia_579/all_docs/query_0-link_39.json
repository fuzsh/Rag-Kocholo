        "text": "This article analyses the impact of France's colonial heritage on French and Parisian public theatre. Theatrical programming cor responds to an imaginary still structured by a cultural and social con struction of race that reflects the past of the \"Grande Nation.\" Three different plays by Ivorian dramatist Koffi Kwahulé are examined, each depicting situations of demotion experienced by French citizens of foreign origin. I argue that the way French public theatre is struc tured and administered today mirrors, to a certain extent, real situa tions of tension reflecting the disparities between the \"centres\" (symbols of power and homogeneity) and the \"peripheries\" (socio economic and cultural spaces of relegation structured by a racial imag inary). I also analyse the concept of the border as a geographic, eco nomic, and sociocultural paradigm, allowing us to understand, in the French and francophone contexts, what unites and divides-or more accurately, how francophone writers and French writers of foreign ori gin can still be condemned in the twenty-first century to a sort of exile from metropolitan Paris, the capital of a Jacobin state.\n\nThe study focuses on the theater that was practiced by migrant workers in the 1960s and 1970s, and an actualization of this discussion from the recents studies about decolonial representation in french arts. We highlight the political role of the migrants' native language and culture, emphasizing the role of the playwright Kateb Yacine as an avant-garde representation of decolonial engagement in theater. In the pedagogical context, the investigation describes the interventions made by Augusto Boal and CETITADE during the 70s and 80s, as an expansion of a new look about the immigration theme, where the migrant protagonism was the center of the artistic process.\n\nThis article argues that the public space of theater in an immigrant language can contribute to making immigrants and their offspring feel at home in the host country. In France, however, there is little public support for theater in immigrant languages, since it is perceived as segregating immigrants from French cultural spaces and encouraging communautarisme, or the fragmentation of society along ethnic or religious lines, thus violating the spirit of equality inscribed in the constitution. Through interviews with the Turkish-French theater group Kebab Show and analysis of their plays, this paper argues that what anti-communautaristes see as theater intended to segregate immigrant communities may instead contribute to making them at home in France. For older members of the community, native-language theater provides a bridge between the country of origin and France. For their children and grandchildren born in France, this native-language theater publicly acknowledges a part of themselves that is usually relegated to private home spaces. Filled with word play and humorous situations that require knowledge of both Turkish and French cultures, such theater suggests the important role that native and bilingual theater can play in the process of helping all the generations of an immigrant community feel at home.\n\nIn the last years of the nineteenth century, the young playwright Maurice Pottecher opened his People’ Theatre in a small town in Lorraine. The opening of the theatre in Bussang, which continues to operate today, completed Pottecher’s migration away from the Parisian symbolist theatre and launched his career as founder of a new national popular theatre movement.1 Moreover, Pottecher’ theatre became a rural touchstone for a national French culture, politics, and commerce. To understand the meaning and impact of Pottecher’ theatre we will look at his vision of the theatre and how it placed him at a cross section of commerce, worker uplift programs, and art. Ever-present in the exploration of this theatre is the impact of regionalism. The People’ Theatre was a site where regional and national identity were fused together rather than reacting as competing forms of allegiance.\n\nIn many respects, the discussion about the theatre artist who writes – together with the actors or not – texts that (s)he subsequently stages (signing it as a director or opting for collective authorship) starts and stops in Romania to a vocabulary flaw. In Romanian, there is no equivalent of the term theatre-maker preserving the neutrality and craftsmanship of the English one. The closest in meaning would be ‘theatre author’ (autor de teatru) but this variant enters an ambiguous relationship with the concept of playwright (‘dramatic author’) and a conflicted one with how this working practice assumes the idea of authorship, while ‘ theatre creator’ (creator de teatru) puts an excessive emphasis on the ‘sacredness’ and the exceptional nature of the profession / practice in question. Language difficulties (in fact, they affect the translation into Romanian of many contemporary theatre practices such devised theatre) are, in a sense, a living proof of the atypical nature that this model has in countries such as those in Eastern Europe."
