        "text": "The article argues for a “textural” understanding of “theatricality,” across three fairly distinct models: the image – deep or shallow, as for Richard Wagner and Georg Fuchs; the platform – of skill or tension, as for Vsevolod Meyerhold and Bertolt Brecht; and the tightrope – this is Peter Brook’s metaphor for a kind of theatrical immediacy that navigates between the “holy” and “rough” aspirations of the above. Beyond such central authorities, authorship itself is seen as woven within the work; ‘texture,’ throughout, implies a dramaturgy of interweaving strands or processes, as opposed to the assemblage ofpre-existing parts or components. What marks each of the three models as specifically theatrical is how the very density or sparsity of their textures ostensibly deviates from some historically specific performative norm – be it operatic convention, stage naturalism, capitalist society, literary or “deadly” theatre.\n\nThis multi-authored article collects a range of position statements made by leading scholars/practitioners in the fields of theatre aurality, music theatre/opera and sound design. Contributors independently prepared short statements in response to a central provocation – namely, the mooted ‘scenographic turn’ and its implication for theatre sound studies. The article provides snapshots of current opinions about theatre sound design and scenography. It does not advance a single, unified argument but rather outlines some key ways in which sound/music and scenography are operating, and have operated, in theatre, and have been discussed in aesthetic theory. The article ultimately reinforces the importance of attending to sound and scenography as co-constitutive elements, and suggests there is no single or best way of doing this. With statements from Ross Brown, Adrian Curtin, George Home-Cook, Lynne Kendrick, David Roesner, Katharina Rost, Nicholas Till and Pieter Verstraete\n\n￼How do theatre practitioners translate an existing source into performance? What role does theatre play in the perpetuation of inherited narratives and traditional practices? And what relationship is there between adaptation, performance and change? In this diverse collection of seventeen interviews, the multiple meanings and processes of theatrical adaptation are explored. Covering myriad approaches to adaptation (including live art, puppetry, playwriting, children’s theatre, musical and visual theatre) from a wide range of European, Asian, African and American cultural contexts, Theatre and Adaptation features an exceptional line-up of contemporary practitioners in conversation about their work, including: • Adrian Kohler, Jane Taylor and Mervyn Millar of Handspring Puppet Company on their stage adaptations of War Horse and the testimonies of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission • Katie Mitchell on her stagings of Woolf’s The Waves, Strindberg’s Miss Julie and the Grimm Brothers’ Hansel and Gretel • Ivo van Hove on Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s multimedia stagings of canonical plays by Eugene O’Neill and Tennessee Williams, and stage adaptations of film scripts by Bergman, Antonioni and Cassavetes • Romeo Castellucci on his work with Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio appropriating Dante’s Divina Commedia and Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar • Noh actor and master Udaka Michishige about his interpretations of canonical Noh plays and compositions of new Noh • Simon Stephens on his stage adaptation of Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and his translations of Ibsen and Jon Fosse This ground-breaking collection reveals the pivotal role each practitioner has played in expanding current understandings of adaptation, its relationship to performance and the cultural changes that it might engender."
