What’s the use of remembering that, (but) I can’t remember the names of important collaborators?”\n\nThis is one of the questions, or “obsessions” as he calls them, that inspired Robert Lepage to create 887. It’s the Western Canadian premiere of the 2015 creation by Lepage and his company, Ex Machina\n\nWritten, directed and starring Lepage, 887 begins with Lepage being asked to memorize Michèle Lalonde’s political poem Speak White for a 40th-anniversary celebration of Montreal’s La nuit de la poésie. As he tries to learn the piece, he looks back at his childhood and his family, and growing up in a cramped apartment at 887 Murray Avenue in Quebec City. The play, set in the 1960s, also recalls events leading to the FLQ Crisis in 1970.\n\n“The theme of memory becomes a bit of a preoccupation when you turn 50,” the 58-year-old said. “You bump into more and more people who are having memory problems, where you start having aunts and uncles or closer family members who start having Alzheimer’s. As a performer, you become concerned about memory. It becomes tougher to learn lines. You discover that theatre is intimately connected to memory.\n\n“The first compliment you get as a kid when you start performing is, ‘My god what a memory you have.’”\n\nA presentation by SFU Woodward’s Cultural Programs in partnership with Théâtre la Seizième, 887 follows the sold-out success of Blue Dragon/Le Dragon Bleu (2010) and Far Side of the Moon (2012) at SFU’s Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. Like much of his previous work (see sidebar), 887 is as technically innovative as it is narratively compelling. Working with his company Ex Machina, Lepage has created a show that uses scale models, dollhouses, and shadow puppets to tell the story.\n\nAlthough he spends most of the show with a cellphone in hand, 57-year-old director has concerns about the way we rely on our devices to act as memory repositories.\n\n“It’s not important to remember exactly what happened, but the impressions you have of something that happened,” he said.\n\n===\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE PHOTOS, or tap and swipe the image on your mobile device.\n\n===\n\n“That’s why the show is based on my true life story, but it’s also auto-fiction because I can’t remember exactly everything in detail. Part of my brain invents stuff. That’s how memory works. We only remember vivid things here and there, but there are a lot of grey areas and our brains have a tendency to invent things that didn’t happen, because it needs to bridge the gaps. That’s a very creative process, and I don’t think it’s bad if you’re not exactly truthful about your life story, even without you noticing that you’ve invented a lot of it.”\n\nLepage’s investigation into his past revealed some surprises to the director/performer, such as how much his father, a quiet man who worked long hours as a cab driver, influenced him.\n\n“I always thought whatever talent or personality traits I’ve inherited probably came from my mother,” he said.\n\n“But when I started doing this show, I discovered I inherited much more from my father than my mother. My father was much more central to my life than I thought he was, probably because of the times. A lot of what was going on in the ’60s socially had a huge impact on his life and our family. He was pretty much the barometer of that time. As an adult, I’ve reanalyzed the whole thing and can see he was very present in my life.”\n\nIt was his father who moved the family to a largely English-speaking community in Quebec City. And it was his father who gave his children the gift of a second language.\n\n“The reasons why I can conduct an interview with you in English is the only gift my father could really give to me,” Lepage said. “He did not have a great education. But he was in the Navy, and in the Navy he learned English, and for him it was his treasure. It was the thing he was proud of, that he was perfectly bilingual in a very, very French-Canadian town, Quebec City. He took pride in the fact that he could take tourists on tours of the city because he was perfectly bilingual. And that is what he would impose on us. We would watch TV in English. And that was instrumental in the development of my craft, my intelligence.”\n\nLepage eventually graduated from the Conservatoire d’art dramatique de Québec and studied in Paris. He began performing and creating plays in 1980 and has since enjoyed a string of almost unprecedented successes, both at home and abroad, and is regarded as one of the most innovative theatre directors in the world.\n\nFor all his success onstage, there was no reason during his childhood for Lepage to think he would go into theatre.\n\n“There was no artist in my family besides my older brother, who could draw incredibly well and eventually became a photographer. He was quite an inspiration.\n\n“But I didn’t know theatre would be the thing. I tried music, I tried drawing. But theatre seemed to be the thing where I felt comfortable. All other forms of art meant that I had to express myself as an individual. But in the theatre I could hide behind a group. I was quite a shy guy. So if the show sucks it’s probably the director’s fault, or the writer’s faults or the group, but it’s not your fault. It was quite a release for me.”\n\n***\n\nOver the course of his 30-plus-year career, Robert Lepage has proven himself to be as versatile as he is talented. His creative approach has broken new ground in music, film, opera, and the circus. Here are five cornerstone works.\n\nCirculations: Lepage toured the country with this first play, which won the 1984 award for best Canadian production at the Quinzaine internationale de théâtre de Québec. Circulations already showed signs of his experimental, multilingual, multimedia approach to theatre.\n\nLes Trilogies des dragons: Lepage’s first major, large-canvas work with a multimedia approach, the original 1985 production catapulted him to international fame.\n\nPeter Gabriel’s Secret World Tour: Lepage brought his theatrical vision to the rock star’s 1993 tour, and later contributed stage direction for Gabriel’s 2003-04 Growing Up Tour.\n\nLe Confessional: This 1995 movie was Lepage’s first (but not last) foray into film writing and directing. It won a slew of awards and was selected to represent Canada as best foreign film nominee at both the 1996 Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards.\n\nKÀ: A collaboration between Quebec’s best-known boundary-pushing theatre director and its internationally renowned circus company was inevitable. Lepage designed and directed this 2005 production as well as Totem (2010)."
