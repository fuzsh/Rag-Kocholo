        "text": "Robert Lepage, a renowned Canadian theatre artist, has been awarded the Glenn Gould Prize for his contributions to the arts. The Glenn Gould Foundation, a charitable organization based in Toronto, today (February 21) announced Lepage had won the $50,000 prize.\n\nBorn in Quebec, Lepage is noted for his innovative approach to creating live productions including theatre, opera, and circus. His acclaimed one-man show The Far Side of the Moon visited Vancouver last fall.\n\nLepage is the 10th recipient of the international award, which was created as a tribute to celebrated Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, who passed away in 1982. Previous award winners include songwriter Leonard Cohen, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and violinist Yehudi Menuhin.\n\nCandidates for the prize are nominated by the public and the winner is picked by a jury. Lepage was selected by a six-member jury that included filmmaker Deepa Mehta, author John Ralston Saul, and poet Patti Smith, among others."
