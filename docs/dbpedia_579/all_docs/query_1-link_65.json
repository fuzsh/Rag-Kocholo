The books are carefully structured to enable the reader to gain a good grasp of the fundamental elements underpinning each practitioner's work. They provide an inspiring springboard for students on twentieth century, contemporary theatre and theatre history courses.\n\nThese compact, well-illustrated and clearly written books unravel the contribution of modern theatre's most charismatic innovators, through:\n\npersonal biography\n\nexplanation of key writings\n\ndescription of significant productions\n\nreproduction of practical exercises.\n\nAs a first step towards critical understanding, and as an initial exploration before going on to further, primary research, Routledge Performance Practitioners are unbeatable value for today's student."
