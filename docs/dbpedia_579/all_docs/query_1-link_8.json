        "text": "Robert Lepage is widely considered one of the most influential living theatre practitioners.\n\nHailing from Quebec, Lepage is a multidisciplinary artist whose work as a director, playwright and actor spans theatre, cinema, opera and rock concerts.\n\nHis theatre is recognisable for its highly visual mise-en-scène which has earned him the status, according to The Guardian, of the ‘alchemist of modern imagistic theatre’.\n\nIn 2020 Lepage is staging a revival of his company Ex Machina's early masterpieces: The Seven Streams of the River Ota (1994); a seven-hour piece about the impact of the 1945 Hiroshima bombing.\n\nLepage's work is often compared with other notable contemporary directors such as Robert Wilson, Peter Brook and Elizabeth LeCompte.\n\nRegister now to continue reading\n\nRegister to the Drama & Theatre website today and gain access to all the latest news and developments from the world of drama education.\n\nBy registering you will receive:\n\nFree access to 4 subscriber-only articles per month\n\nUnlimited access to news and opinion on our website\n\nRegister\n\nAlready have an account?
