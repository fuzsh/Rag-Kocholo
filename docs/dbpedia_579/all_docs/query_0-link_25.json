        "text": "Après avoir établi que le théâtre et la recherche théâtrale au Canada ont poursuivi une évolution parallèle, l'auteur examine la nature et les contributions de cette recherche au cours de ces vingt dernières années, période pendant laquelle il a lui-même participé à ce cheminement. En tant que discipline universitaire, la recherche théâtrale s'inscrit, en quelque sorte, dans une idéologie «alternative» semblable à celle qui a amené la création d'un théâtre national, écrit et produit par et pour les Canadiens. Cette idéologie, fondée sur une activité dite «professionnelle» et «nationale» à laquelle on appliquait les grilles théoriques et méthodologiques agréées par la discipline, a servi à proposer des normes ou des cadres théoriques définis sur un mode empirique ou documentaire. Mais cette discipline «alternative» est désormais remise en question par une érudition nouvelle qui en identifie les faiblesses et explore certains aspects jusqu'ici occultés ou marginalisés de la création dramatique.\n\n1. For discussions of the development of theatre in Canada, see the following: Various subject entries in The Oxford Companion to Canadian Theatre, edited by Benson, Eugene and Conolly, L. W. (Toronto: Oxford, 1989)Google Scholar; Brookes, Chris, A Public Nuisance: A History of the Mummers Troupe (St. John's: Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1988)Google Scholar; Filewod, Alan, Collective Encounters: Documentary Theatre in English Canada (Toronto/Buffalo/London: University of Toronto Press, 1987)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Johnston, Denis, Up the Mainstream: The Rise of Toronto's Alternative Theatres (Toronto/Buffalo/London: University of Toronto Press, 1991)Google Scholar: Usmiani, Renate, Second Stage:The Alternative Theatre Movement in Canada (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1983)Google Scholar; Wagner, Anton, ed., Contemporary Canadian Theatre: New World Visions (Toronto: Simon and Pierre, 1985).Google Scholar\n\n2. For a discussion of the term ‘national’ in the context of the search for a ‘national’ theatre, see Salter, Denis, ‘The Idea of a National Theatre’, in Canadian Canons: Essays in Literary Value, ed. Lecker, Robert (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1991), pp. 71–90.Google Scholar\n\n3. See Filewod, Alan, Collective EncountersGoogle Scholar and Brookes, Chris, A Public Nuisance.Google Scholar Although there was no main stream in the sense of a ‘regional’ theatre, Newfoundland did have activity with mainstream values, for example in the 1950s London Theatre Company and in various DDF-oriented amateur groups.\n\n4. The ‘regional’ theatres are seen to begin with the establishment in 1958–9 of the Manitoba Arts Centre with a tripartite mandate of ‘mainstage’ performances, outreach touring productions and audience development programmes aimed largely at young people. Over the next decade-and-a-half, a professional theatre loosely resembling the MTC was set up in each of the urban centres across the country.\n\n7. In Canadian Literature (vol.62 no. 14, 1962)Google Scholar John Ball had published a list of 451 titles covering printed commentary about theatre performance between 1606 and 1959. There had been several short listings of plays in English by 1976 including an early compilation directed by Chris Johnston at Brock University, The Brock Bibliography of Published Canadian Stage Plays in English 1900–1972 (1972)Google Scholar and its First Supplement (1973).Google Scholar The first truly comprehensive play listing was The Brock Bibliography of Published Canadian Plays in English 1766–1978 (Toronto: Playwrights Press, 1980)Google Scholar compiled under the editorship of Anton Wagner.\n\n9. Merrill Denison has traditionally been viewed as the first major playwright in twentieth-century English-Canada. His comment originally appeared in his article, ‘Nationalism and Drama’, in Bertram Brooker's Yearbook of the Arts in Canada, 1928–9 (Toronto: Macmillan of Canada, 1929).Google Scholar Denison's remark has been cited many times.\n\n10. Edwards, Murray D., A Stage in our Past: English-Language Theatre in Eastern Canada from the 1790s to 1914 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1968).Google Scholar This was an adaptation of his doctoral thesis at Columbia University.\n\n12. I am even further implicated since I currently teach the Canadian theatre course at Toronto's Graduate Drama Centre. Again, in light of my criticism, I should report that the number of doctoral theses at the Centre, as well as the course enrolment, continues to increase.\n\n14. Before the Brock Bibliography, the most authoritative reference tool on plays was Reginald Eyre Walters' On Canadian Literature, 1806–1960 (University of Toronto Press, 1966)Google Scholar, which was revised and enlarged in 1972. Both versions included plays. There were several other short lists available, such as W.S. Milne's Canadian Full-Length Plays in English (Ottawa, Dominion Drama Festival, 1964)Google Scholar and its Supplement (1966), but these were highly selective.\n\n19. From ‘An Editorial Viewpoint’, CTR vol.1 no.1 Winter 1974: 4. The editors' commentary went on: ‘If CTRis allowed to evolve (or, perhaps, devolve) into another “learned” journal… this publication won't deserve to exist’.\n\n22. This ‘national’ representation is a much more complicated idea than my comments would imply. When the Stratford Festival was officially our ‘national’ theatre, it was to be resident at the new National Arts Centre in Ottawa for six months of the year and Stratford for six. At another stage of the plans, the NAC, heavily funded by federal funds, was to receive shows from the regions of Canada, and its company would tour shows. A theatre from sea unto sea.\n\n24. Michael Tait's essay, ‘Playwrights in a Vacuum: English-Canadian Dramain the Nineteenth Century’, (Canadian Literature no. 16 Spring 1963: 3–18Google Scholar) was an often quoted assessment of Canadian plays. Covering a few works by three closet dramatists, Tait's article implied that all nineteenth-century English-Canadian drama was bad and separated from the theatre.\n\n28.
