In the 1970s women writers produced a rich literature expounding feminist perspectives, while in the 1980s much emphasis was placed by writers on literary theory and experimental form. At the same time such aesthetic concerns were tempered by a series of lengthy novels or sagas exploring various facets of life prior to the 1960s. Quebecois literature, the term now used to describe contemporary writing in French has become a rich, vibrant, socially relevant literature.\n\nIn the 1960s, traditional approaches to the novel gave way to psychological introspection and abandonment of linear plot lines. Frequently, the normative French of Paris gave way to joual, the French spoken by Montrealers. Le libraire (1960, Not for Every Eye) by Gerard Bessette (1920- ) shockingly criticized clerical censorship and religious hypocrisy, while Le poids de dieu (1962, The Burden of God) by Gilles Marcotte (1925- ) analyzed the taboo topic of a French-Canadian priest's crisis of faith. Anticlericalism and political revolt characterize many novels of the period. Le couteau sur la table (1965, The Knife on the Table) by Jacques Godbout (1933- ) uses cinematic techniques to depict federalist-separatist conflict in Quebec. Ethel et le terrorist (1964) by Claude Jasmin (1930- ), written after terrorist bombings in Montreal, analyzed the suppressed alienation simmering below the surface of the counter-culture in French Canada.\n\nIn the second half of this decade, the publication of several nouveaux romans (new novels) confirmed the weaning of Quebecois fiction from traditional forms, while retaining their social relevance. In haunting surrealistic prose, <IR> MARIE-CLAIRE BLAIS </IR> (1939- ) probed the ugliness of poverty and sexual abuse of children in Une saison dans la vie d'Emmanuel (1965). The exquisite lyrical prose of Prochain Episode (1965) by Hubert Aquin (1929-1970) depicts the flight from justice of a Montreal terrorist seeking independence for his people. Aquin continues his effort to turn the novel into an art form created by both author and reader in two other important novels: Trou de memoire (1960) and L'antiphonaire (1969; The Antiphonary). In the next two decades Blais continued to probe the underbelly of Montreal society, exploring the brutal world of the homosexual in Un Joualonais, sa joualonie (1974, St. Lawrence Blues) and the world of the lesbian in Les nuits de l'undergound (1978, Nights in the Underground).\n\nParody, burlesque, and satire in literature reflect new trends and a rapidly changing society. The carnivalesque La Guerre yes sir! (1968) by Roch Carrier (1937- ) reinterprets pre-war village life in Quebec with biting black humor; Le jardin des delices (1978, The Garden of Delights) revisits the same community a generation later. The influence of the oral tradition and nationalism is seen also in the numerous works of Jacques Ferron (1921- ); L'amelanchier (1970; The Juneberry Tree) recaptures a vision of childhood. In Volkswagen Blues (1984) by Jacques Poulin (1937- ), realism is tempered with tenderness and compassion.\n\nThree women writers have attracted international fame. In addition to key novels, for example, Bonheur d'occasion (1945, The Tin Flute), <IR> GABRIELLE ROY </IR> (1909-1983) has left us many essays and short stories, including Ces enfants de ma vie (1977; Children of My Heart), and a moving autobiography, La detresse et l'enchantement (1984, Enchantment and Sorrow). <IR> ANNE HEBERT </IR> (1916- ) excels in psychological dramas marked by violence, dramatic tension, and poetic prose. Two of her best are Kamouraska (1970) and Les fous de Bassan (1982, In the Shadow of the Wind). <IR> ANTONINE MAILLET </IR> (1929- ) has become the literary voice of Canada's Acadian French minority, in 1979 receiving the Prix Goncourt for Pelagie la charrette (1979, Pelagie, the Return to a Homeland), a picaresque epic of the return of deported Acadians from the United States to their homeland.\n\nFeminist writers such as Louky Bersianik (L'Euguelionne, 1976), Yolande Villemaire (La vie en prose, 1982), and France Theoret (Nous parlerons comme on ecrit, 1982) reflect the vitality of Quebecois literature by trying to create a non-patriarchal language in new fictional forms. Triptyque lesbien (1980) by Jovette Marchessault (1938- ) expresses lesbian solidarity, and Amantes (1980) represents the most avant-garde work of <IR> NICOLE BROSSARD </IR> (1943- ). A return to traditional novels recreating recent Quebec life is seen more recently in the six-volume series of Victor-Levy Beaulieu (1945-\n\n); the five-novel social chronicle of Montreal's Plateau Mont-Royal district by Michel Tremblay (1942- ), equally popular, have all been translated into English. Le Matou (1981, The Alley Cat) of Yves Beauchemin (1941- ) with its sale of one million copies in many languages and a film adaptation, has inaugurated the era of le best-seller in Quebec.\n\nFrom 1953-1963 the Hexagone Press, dedicated to \"action through publishing,\" provided poets with access to the marketplace. Influenced heavily by <IR> ALAIN GRANDBOIS </IR> (1900-1975), surrealism, and the revolutionary Refus global (1948) of the painter Paul-Emile Borduas, automatist writers such as <IR> ROLAND GIGUERE </IR> (1929- ) and <IR> PAULMARIE LAPOINTE </IR> (1929- ) invented new forms and rhythms. The group's charismatic founder, <IR> GASTON MIRON </IR> (1928- ), preaches political independence in L'homme rapaille (1970, The Agonized Life). Fernand Ouellette (1930- ) in Ici, ailleurs, la lumiere (1977) and Jacques Brault (1933- ) in L'en-dessous admirable (1975) argue for the importance of humanistic values in a disordered, modern world.\n\nIn the 1960s Quebec's social upheaval was reflected in such committed and popular works as L'afficheur hurle (1965) by Paul Chamberland (1939- ) and his political manifesto, Terre Quebec (1964). Gerald Godin (1938- ) denounced the War Measures Act of 1970 and his own arrest as a separatist in Libertes surveillees (1975), while Michele Lalonde (1937- ) expressed the resentment of many Quebecers in Speak White (1974) a bitter denunciation of English and American cultural domination.\n\nAvant-garde approaches to poetry are associated with Les Herbes rouges, which published over 100 titles in ten years. The modernism of this school has produced a large body of feminist writings such as Bloody Mary (1977) by France Theoret. Its most important theoretician is Nicole Brossard (1943- ), whose attempt to renew poetic language is seen in Le Centre blanc (1970) and Amantes (1980).\n\nThe first performancee of Tit-Coq in 1948 marked the birth of contemporary Quebecois drama for its author, Gratien Gelinas (1909- ), and brought to the Montreal stage authentic working-class French-Canadians who spoke North-American rather than European French. Best known for his contribution to the training of professional actors, Gelinas produced only four plays, including Hier les enfants dansaient (1966, Yesterday the Children Were Dancing). Influenced by the theater of the absurd, Jacques Languirand (1931- ) posed the dilemma of Quebecers affirming their cultural identity in Les grands departs (1958, The Departures). The prolific Marcel Dube (1930- ) dominated the Montreal stage during the 1960s, delving into the Quebecois psyche in Florence (1966) and Les beaux dimanches (1968); Au retour des oies blanches (1969), considered to be his best play, resembles Oedipus Rex in plot and form but is firmly planted in a Quebec setting. Francoise Loranger (1913-\n\n), like Dube, stresses middle-class family relationships but with violent undertones, as in Une maison . . . un jour (1965). Political and social problems dominate her later work: Medium saignant (1970), reflecting the bitterness of the conflict in Montreal, opened just days prior to election of Quebec's first separatist government.\n\nThe major dramatic figure of the 1970s is Michel Tremblay (1942- ), whose plays have been translated into English and other languages and have been produced internationally. Les belles-soeurs (1968) changed the course of theater in Quebec by Tremblay's firm rejection of international French as the standard for the stage and his innovative use of joual, the curious but colorful French of urban Montreal. Almost all his plays deal with characters living in the Plateau Mont-Royal district of Montreal. One of his best is A toi pour toujours, ta Marie-Lou (1973, Forever Yours, Marie-Lou). La duchesse de Langeais (1970) and Hosanna (1973) present homosexual protagonists who, according to Tremblay, resemble French Quebecers constantly in search of their national identity.\n\nSocial satire marks the plays of Robert Gurik (1932- ). Hamlet, prince du Quebec (1969) uses a Shakespeare plot to illustrate separatist tensions in Canada, while Jean-Claude Germain (1939- ) and Jean Barbeau (1945- ) both opt firmly for joual. Germain tempers social satire with humor in Un pays dont la devise est je m'oublie (1976), as does Barbeau in Joualez-moi d'amour (1972). Citrouille (1974), however, with its brutal depiction of violence to women, underscores female alienation. Antonine Maillet (1923- ) has chosen for her heroes and heroines the poor of New Brunswick who speak Acadian French. In one of her many plays, La Sagouine (1971), a charwoman 72 years old tells stories of her past, unaware that she is using the coarse language of 16th-century France still spoken in the Maritimes.\n\nThe 1970s mark the advent of a vigorous feminist theater. Collective creations such as La nef des sorcieres (1976, A Clash of Symbols) counterbalance individual works by Denise Boucher, Elizabeth Bourget, and Marie Laberge; La Saga des poules mouillees (1981; The Saga of the Wet Hens), by Jovette Marchessault (1938- ) proposes the creation of a female culture within a patriarchal society. Exciting new directions are promised for the 1980s by Robert Lepage (1958- ), a Montreal dramatist who is attracting international attention by his adaptation of cinematic and television techniques to the stage and his use of surrealistic decors, as in Trilogie des dragons (1985-1987).\n\nThe major sources of information on Quebecois literature are Caroline Bayard, The New Poetics in Canada and Quebec: from Concretism to Postmodernism (1989); Eugene Benson and Leonard Conolly, eds.
