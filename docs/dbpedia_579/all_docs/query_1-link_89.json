        "text": "The notion that history will sooner or later repeat itself as farce is given an intriguing twist in the Canadian director Robert Lepage's amusingly knotty film ''No.'' It isn't just repeated history that can be ludicrous, the film asserts. It can be pretty silly the first time around, especially when recalled a decade later by the people who lived through it.\n\nThe particular bit of Canadian history ''No'' cleverly deconstructs is the October crisis of 1970. That fall the Quebec Liberation Front, a militant group advocating the secession of Quebec province from the rest of the country, initiated a series of uprisings that led to a declaration of martial law throughout Canada.\n\nThe biggest problem facing ''No,'' which opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, has to do with historical recognition. While many Americans may have heard something about the October crisis, it was eclipsed at the time by political turmoil in the United States. For an American audience, the events the movie remembers will have little or no resonance.\n\nIn recalling those turbulent days, ''No,'' adapted from a fragment of Mr. Lepage's seven-hour theatrical epic ''The Seven Streams of the River Ota,'' explores questions of national identity through the interrelationships of a group of Canadian and Japanese artists, theater performers, diplomats and a Japanese translator who was blinded in the bombing of Hiroshima. Much of the film is set in Osaka, Japan, at Expo '70, an event that also marked the 25th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nA Canadian contribution to Expo '70 is an admittedly shoddy production (done in French) of a Feydeau farce starring Sophie (Anne-Marie Cadieux), a headstrong, wildly self-dramatizing actress who while in Japan discovers that she is pregnant. Although she has a boyfriend, Michel (Alexis Martin), back home, Sophie is not sure who the father is, and the couple are on the verge of separating over the issue of raising a family. Michel, an aspiring left-wing playwright dabbling in revolutionary politics, has assembled a crude homemade bomb with two of his cronies.\n\n''No,'' whose title is a pun on Japanese Noh drama, underscores its bicultural view by switching back and forth between color (for its Japanese scenes) and grainy black and white (for its Canadian scenes). The ineptly performed Feydeau play in which Sophie performs becomes a metaphor for the behavior of all the major characters.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
