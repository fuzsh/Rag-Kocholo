        "text": "Ex Machina, Côté Danse, Dvoretsky Productions and presenting partner Show One Productions today announced the U.S. premiere of The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark, a captivating fusion of theater and dance by internationally acclaimed artists: the legendary director Robert Lepage (Metropolitan Opera, Stratford Festival, Cirque du Soleil) and the renowned dancer/choreographer Guillaume Côté, best known for his long tenure as a Principal Dancer with The National Ballet of Canada. Following the sold-out world premiere in Toronto last spring and a presentation at Le Festivalul Internațional Shakespeare in Craiova, this re-imagining of Shakespeare's timeless and haunting tragedy Hamlet will debut at the Harris Theater for Music and Dance (205 E. Randolph St.) for three performances, Saturday, November 23-Sunday, November 24.\n\nThis wordless rendition of the emblematic tale of a man engulfed by doubt and possibly slipping into madness following the tragic death of his father offers a fresh perspective on the enduring masterpiece. The 100-minute-long performance delves into the core narratives of Shakespeare's intricate exploration of the human condition, seamlessly blending classical and contemporary choreography. Featuring a company of carefully selected dancers, Côté himself stars as the tormented Dane.\n\nCôté and Lepage's creation pulls the audience deep into a world of deception, where phantoms and humans mingle on a minimalist set on which light, shadow and transparency play an integral role. This metaphorical reinterpretation of the Shakespearian drama draws a fine line, connecting movements of the body with what may or may not be lurking within the corners of the mind.\n\n\"Robert has staged numerous award-winning productions of Hamlet globally and has even played the role himself. His deep and nuanced understanding of the play became a topic of discussion as we worked on another multi-disciplinary experience in 2018, Frame by Frame produced by The National Ballet of Canada\" Côté recalls. \"Hamlet remains a deep exploration of the human experience, and by gaining a deeper understanding of this character, we can appreciate the importance of taking action to address the problems of humanity. Shakespeare's canon of works exemplifies the power of art, and there is no better time than now to unite through shared experiences.\"\n\n\"Hamlet, both the play and the character, have left an indelible mark on my career,\" adds Lepage. \"When Guillaume expressed an interest in revisiting the character, the proposition of working with him to find a nonverbal expression of the inner contradictions and the paradoxes of Hamlet was, for me, an immensely inspiring idea.\"\n\nHailed as \"the can't-miss dance event of the year,\" by the Toronto Guardian, Lepage and Côté's The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark made its World Premiere on April 3, 2024, at Toronto's Elgin Theater. Described as a \"tantalizing glimpse into the creative masterminds of Lepage and Côté as a single creative unit,\" by Intermission Magazine, the performance was lauded as one of the dance world's most innovative productions of 2024.\n\nIn The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark, Côté and Lepage adopt a theatrical approach to the narrative, focusing on the dynamic movements of the nine-dancer ensemble. Lepage infuses the production with his renowned visual signature, crafting a powerfully symbolic world using expressive lighting design, movable set pieces, and a striking original score by award-winning composer John Gzowski.\n\n\"This piece is really based on bodies, on movement, on how to use the space,\" says Lepage. \"I think people will recognize my signature...any technology we employ is very supportive of the strong ideas underpinning the production.\"\n\nThe Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark is produced by Lepage's Ex Machina and Côté's Côté Danse, in partnership with veteran producer Svetlana Dvoretsky's Dvoretsky Productions, and is presented by Show One Productions, which celebrates 20 years as a leading global arts producer and presenter in 2024. Dvoretsky recently produced a new work with Côté, an acclaimed multimedia dance production TOUCH and with Lepage, she presented his immersive VR project The Library At Night in Toronto.\n\n\"I am honored to produce this momentous collaboration of these two extraordinary artists come to fruition in this stunning and innovative new work,\" commented Dvoretsky. \"Guillaume Côté and Robert Lepage are unique talents on a global stage, and their visual worlds blend beautifully. A project like this is a dream come true for a producer, and it is a thrill to be part of their ongoing collaboration.\"\n\nThe brooding and provocative design elements of The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark are brought to life by a carefully selected team of distinguished designers. Leading the charge is Steve Blanchet, Creative Director at Ex Machina, who has over twenty-five years of experience in the arts and cultural sector. Blanchet's notable works include Shakespeare's Coriolanus at the Stratford Festival and Mozart's The Magic Flute at the Quebec Opera Festival. Lighting Designer Simon Rossiter, known for his specialization in dance, has collaborated on over three hundred designs with prestigious companies such as The National Ballet of Canada and Toronto Dance Theatre, earning multiple Dora Mavor Moore awards. Costume Designer Michael Gianfrancesco has an extensive portfolio spanning theater, opera and dance, with his designs showcased at the Stratford Festival, The National Ballet of Canada and the Rossini Festival in Italy. Together, this talented trio ensures a visually stunning and immersive experience for the audience.\n\nTickets for Côté and Lepage's The Tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark will go on sale Friday, July 12 at 10 a.m. CST, with tickets beginning at $59. Tickets will be available at www.harristheaterchicago.com or by calling the Harris Theater box office at 312.334.7777. The U.S. Premiere will run at the Harris Theater for Music and Dance in Chicago from November 23- 24, with a limited number of available performances.

His original approach to theatre has won him international acclaim, particularly for his use of new technologies. He is the recipient of the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He is the founder and artistic director of Ex Machina and has directed numerous plays, operas and films including work for Cirque du Soleil and the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nChoreographer and dancer Guillaume Côté is one of Canada's most celebrated dance artists. He has been the leading male figure of The National Ballet of Canada as a Principal Dancer since 2004 and has choreographed many works for the company including Frame by Frame, Being and Nothingness and Le Petit Prince. He has also been invited to perform at the most prestigious companies in the world like The Royal Ballet in London, Teatro alla Scala in Milan and the New York City Ballet. Côté is also Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur.\n\nComposer, sound designer, musician and instrument maker John Gzowski worked on over 250 theater, dance and film productions for which he has composed, created sound designs, performed live foley and live music and acted as musical director. He has played banjo for opera in Banff, studied Carnatic classical music in India and played oud and guitar in jazz and folk festivals across Canada and Europe. His theater work has won him 6 Dora's, from 18 nominations for companies like Ex Machina, Stratford, Shaw Festival, Luminato, National Arts Centre, the Mirvishes, MTC, the Arts Club, Canstage, Soulpepper, Dancemakers, Red Sky, Tarragon, Factory Theatre and YPT. Gzowski has played on numerous CD's, with releases with Patricia O'Callaghan, Tasa, and Autorickshaw as well as a Juno nomination with Maza Meze. He has run Canada's first microtonal group, touring Canada playing the works of Harry Partch, composed and performed with several new music groups and worked as co-artistic director of the Music Gallery.\n\nAbout Ex Machina\n\nLed by artistic director Robert Lepage, Ex Machina creates, produces, and disseminates multidisciplinary artistic works, most often theatrical.\n\nThe company brings together creators from several fields of activity and offers a broad range of artistic production: original plays written and performed solo or collectively, plays based on existing texts, productions in which various disciplines (dance, music, museology) mingle with theater, operas and multimedia productions featuring a predominantly technological dimension. Ex Machina mainly develops its shows in the city of Quebec, then presents them abundantly in Quebec, Canada and elsewhere in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nBeyond their diversity, the company's projects have some features in common. Anecdotes lead to the exploration of ideas such as the revelation of identity through exposure to the other. Cultural intersections, the nature of the creative act, interrupted communication and states of dependence are recurring themes.\n\nSeveral dramatic situations oppose the quotidian to the extraordinary, the naturalism to the metaphor, and somehow diffident characters to historical figures. The multilingualism, the massive use of images, the reversal of perspective, the variations in scale, the use of narrative codes borrowed from the cinema and the use of technological tools aim to spark meaning and emotion, reflecting a desire to poeticize theatrical expression.\n\nAbout twenty permanent employees and a large number of artists, artisans, designers, authors, performers, and freelance technicians work each year to create Ex Machina's shows. They are seen year after year by hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nAbout Côté Danse\n\nCôté Danse burst onto the Canadian dance scene in 2019, thanks to the collaboration between Choreographer Guillaume Côté and Producer Etienne Lavigne. Since then, they have been actively presenting a range of original works, films, and immersive dance experiences.\n\nUnder the artistic direction of Guillaume Côté, Côté Danse establishes a unique vision, combining classical dance knowledge with captivating geometries and intense human connections. Their style is characterized by contemporary lines, sleek contours, and refined athleticism, creating a distinct and dynamic aesthetic.\n\nThrough collaborations with a diverse group of designers, artists, and partners such as Robert Lepage, Mirari Studios, and Son Lux, Côté Danse has successfully produced four full-length productions. These creations have garnered significant attention, with over 125 performances, over four years, in more than 20 cities."
