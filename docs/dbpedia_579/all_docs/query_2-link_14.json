        "text": "STANDING IN A MONTREAL hotel lobby recently, Robert Lepage was amused to discover that his wallet contained only Italian lire. The 38-year-old director and performer had just returned home to Canada from the European tour of ''Elsinore,'' his one-man version of ''Hamlet.'' As usual, he was existing on several continents at once: ''I guess I'm still partly in Palermo,'' he said with a smile.\n\nA bilingual French Canadian, Mr. Lepage has straddled the globe for the last 10 years in both a literal and a metaphoric sense. His schedule often involves simultaneous world tours of different shows that he has directed and written, frequently with himself in a leading role. The technically dazzling productions, ranging from one-man works (''Vinci,'' 1986; ''Needles and Opium,'' 1991) to multi-hour epics (''The Dragon's Trilogy'' 1985; ''Tectonic Plates,'' 1988), have in common a fusion of cultural emblems and a concern with how universal issues impact individual lives.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Lepage has been compared to such titans as the director Peter Brook and the playwright Tony Kushner, yet he occupies his own space in the theatrical realm as a creator who employs state-of-the-art technology in the service of emotion.\n\nRather boyish looking, of average height and build, Mr. Lepage could easily blend in with the scenery were it not for his casually flamboyant fashion sense. In Montreal a few weeks ago for screenings of his new film ''Polygraph,'' adapted from his play about a love triangle and a murder, he was decked out in velvet jacket, patterned vest and black running shoes -- part bard, part athlete.\n\nLepage productions are not often seen in the United States. So the arrival of his eight-hour epic, ''The Seven Streams of the River Ota,'' opening today at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater as part of the Next Wave Festival, is something of an event. (The two parts, with a break for dinner, will be presented today, Saturday and Dec. 14; the remaining performances will be on consecutive evenings through Dec. 13.)\n\nDivided into seven sections that Mr. Lepage calls ''boites,'' or boxes, ''The Seven Streams'' (the Ota is a river in Hiroshima) is a dreamlike, panoramic depiction of the latter part of the 20th century that employs video sequences as well as scenes inspired by Bunraku puppetry and Butoh dance. The subject matter involves such catastrophes as the Holocaust, the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima and AIDS, as filtered through one family's experiences. The collaborative project has been developed and performed for the last three years by Ex Machina, Mr. Lepage's Quebec company, which took it on tour to Europe this fall.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
