        "text": "The Istituto Italiano di Cultura explores “Pasolini the poet” in this staged reading by renowned Canadian actor RH Thomson (Avonlea, Anne with an E) and from Italy, actor Nestor Saied who has worked with some of the most iconic figures in theatre including Robert Lepage. The reading will be preceded by a brief introduction on Pasolini by Rhodes Scholar and author of the biography Pasolini Requiem, Barth David Schwartz.\n\nTHE POETRY OF PIER PAOLO PASOLINI\n\nStaged Reading by\n\nRH Thomson and Nestor Saied\n\nWednesday, May 4 | 8:00PM EDT\n\nFleck Dance Theatre | Harbourfront Centre\n\n207 Queens Quay West\n\nThird Floor\n\nFREE EVENT | Ticket Reservation Required\n\nCLICK HERE TO RESERVE YOUR TICKETS\n\nPIER PAOLO PASOLINI was a director, a writer, a playwright, an actor, a painter, an intellectual, a journalist, a philosopher, and a newspaper and magazine columnist. He was, however, first of all, a poet. Poetry is the centrepiece of Pasolini’s multi-faced art legacy. He once said, ‘I wrote poetry in the form of cinema,’ claiming that he started to write poetry at the age of seven and never stopped.\n\nThis performance aims to provide the audience with a sample of Pasolini’s gentle yet powerful poetry. Excerpts from his seminal collections, Gramsci’s Ashes and The Religion of My Time, will be recited and performed. Two actors and two languages will present the intrinsic musicality of Pasolini’s poetry in an intertwined performance of music and words.\n\nABOUT THE PERFORMERS\n\nNESTOR SAIED graduated from the National Academy of Dramatic Arts Silvio d’Amico in Rome (Italy). He began his theatrical career in 1982, performing in numerous productions with some of the major Italian theatre companies in Italy and abroad. Since 2004, he has worked with the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco as an associate artist. In 1986, he was appointed “Commander of Merit of the Italian Republic” by the President of the Italian Republic for his intensive dissemination of Italian culture abroad.\n\nRH THOMSON is a Canadian television, film and stage actor. With a career spanning five decades, he remains a regular presence on Canadian film and television screens. He has received numerous awards for his contributions to the arts and war veterans. He began his career in the seventies taking part mainly in television, film and theatre roles."
