        "text": "Convinced of the power of synergy in the cultural milieu, Le Diamant is proud to have major cultural partners from the Québec City arts scene and to be able to count on the support of vital public and private partners.\n\nPrimary resident of Le Diamant, Ex Machina is a multidisciplinary company founded in 1994. Under the leadership of theatre director Robert Lepage, the company brings together creators and technicians from multiple disciplines. The company develops its shows in Québec City and then tours them extensively throughout the province, the country and the world.\n\nEx Machina has produced or co-produced more than 36 artistic productions over the course of more than 20 seasons. A better measure of the extent of its operations, however, is the company’s number of performances. Since its beginning, Ex Machina has had an annual average of 129 performances in 6 to 14 countries, depending on the year. A little more than 1.6 million audience members have seen the company’s work since 1994. The Image Mill—a project excluded from the aforementioned statistics—drew in more than a million spectators between its 2008 premiere and 2013. The company’s annual revenue has been an average of 10 million dollars since the 2008–2009 fiscal year.\n\nEach year, Le Diamant collaborates and creates close relationships with certain cultural organizations in order to present their shows. These partner events align perfectly with Le Diamant’s artistic vision, but they are not a part of Le Diamant’s regular programming and are not subject to its affordable pricing policy (MIDI50 tickets, $20 for 20 years and younger, etc.).\n\nEach spring, Le Carrefour presents a major festival in Québec City. Its artistic choices are influenced by current trends in contemporary new work while also prioritizing original artistic approaches. The festival aims to be a professional crossroad for discovery, exchange and expression for audiences as well as a celebration of theatre and contemporary creation. During its season, it presents—independently or with partners—exceptional works that otherwise would not have been seen in Québec City or in the province.\n\nFounded in 2011, le FCVQ offers Québec City and its visitors a major film event at an exceptional site. The QCFF presents a multitude of high-quality works with a special focus on artists and artisans from Québec City.\n\nL’École de cirque de Québec encourages the development of younger generations and supports professional artists. Both professional and recreational training opportunities are offered. The school also develops workshops in collaboration with specialists in order to use circus arts to facilitate growth for children and teenagers with specific needs (autism, dropping out of school, physical or intellectual disabilities, etc.).\n\nThanks to the engagement of valued partners and donors, Le Diamant continues to fulfill its promises. It is a point of reference for the public, artists and creators of all kinds. It presents audacious productions from here and beyond to the population of Québec City as well as to tourists. It participates actively in inclusion, in the community’s development and in the region’s economic vitality.\n\nThe amounts received will be used to enhance Diamant’s programming, diversify its cultural activities, support the cultural-access program (Donnez au suivant) and set up programs dedicated to the development of children and adults living with functional limitations. Le Diamant would like to warmly thank all its partners and donors.\n\nLe Diamant would like to recognize the essential contributions of the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and the City of Québec to the success of this project."
