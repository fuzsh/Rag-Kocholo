        "text": "Acclaimed theatre artist Robert Lepage will deliver the 2014 Rudin Lecture, “Creating Outside of the Frame,” in the Theresa Lang Theatre at MMC on Wednesday, October 22, at 7 p.m.\n\nAll members of the MMC community are welcome to attend the lecture, which will be followed by a Q&A. Seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis; those wishing to ensure entry should plan to arrive early.\n\nMarymount Manhattan College is grateful for the support of the Rudin Foundation for this event.\n\nWho: Director, playwright and actor Robert Lepage\n\nWhat: “Creating Outside the Frame,” a Jack and Lewis Rudin Distinguished Visiting Scholars Lecture\n\nWhen: October 22, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Theresa Lang Theatre, Marymount Manhattan College, 221 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021\n\nAbout Mr. Lepage\n\nVersatile in every form of theatre craft, Robert Lepage is equally talented as a director, playwright, actor and film director. His creative and original approach to theatre has won him international acclaim and shaken the dogma of classical stage direction to its foundations, especially through his use of new technologies. Contemporary history is his source of inspiration, and his modern and unusual work transcends all boundaries.\n\nA turning point in his career came with the founding of his multidisciplinary production company, Ex Machina, in 1994. Under his artistic direction, this new team produced a steady output of plays, beginning with The Seven Streams of the River Ota (1994), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1995) and a solo production, Elsinore (1995).\n\nIn 1994, Lepage made his début in the world of cinema. He wrote and directed his first feature film, Le Confessional, which appeared the following year at the Cannes Festival Directors’ Fortnight. He went on to direct Polygraph in 1996, Nô in 1997, Possible Worlds in 2000, and in 2003, a film adaptation of his play The Far Side of the Moon.\n\nBesides myriad ambitious stage productions and films, Lepage has also created a number of rocks shows, exhibits, circus and architectural projections. In 1993, he directed Peter Gabriel’s Secret World Tour. He joined forces with Peter Gabriel again in 2002 to direct Growing Up Tour. He designed and directed Cirque du Soleil shows: KÀ (2005), a permanent show in Las Vegas, and TOTEM (2010).\n\nAmong his achievements in opera: 1984, based on the novel by George Orwell, with Maestro Lorin Maazel providing the musical direction (2005); The Rake’s Progress (2007) and The Nightingale and Other Short Fables, which premiered in Toronto at the Canadian Opera Company (2009); and has been presented at the Festival d’Aix-en-Provence and Opéra de Lyon in 2010.\n\nDas Rheingold, Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen prelude, premiered September 2010 at The Metropolitan Opera with the cycle presented during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons.\n\nAbout The Jack and Lewis Rudin Distinguished Visiting Scholars Program\n\nThe Jack and Lewis Rudin Distinguished Visiting Scholars Program was established at Marymount Manhattan College in 2000 through a grant from The Rudin Foundation, Inc. Both Jack Rudin and the late Lewis Rudin have been well known throughout New York for the extraordinary contributions they have made to enhance the quality of living and working in New York City, and for their generous support of education, health, the arts and other civic, religious and cultural causes. Marymount Manhattan is honored to be the recipient of this special grant. This lecture builds upon the College’s commitment to academic excellence and its distinctive undergraduate programs in the liberal arts."
