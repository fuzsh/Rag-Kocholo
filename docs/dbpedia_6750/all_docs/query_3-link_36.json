        "text": "(paper upon request) This study analysed four records of questionable authenticity of total solar eclipses between the fourth and sixth centuries CE in Byzantine narrative sources. As it has been difficult to evaluate their credibility, they have not been utilised in modern astronomical studies. Three records originated in the fourth century, all of which have problems with accurate dating and provenance. The one remaining record concerns the total solar eclipse on 512 June 29. This study first reveals the problems with and questions around the reliability of all these records from astronomical perspectives based on the latest ΔT spline curve and recently proposed ΔT constraints. It then explores their philological and historical contexts to understand how and why these records were written.\n\nPrior to the Hellenistic period, Egyptian priests were coyly mute in the matter of recording sky phenomena. Almost completely absent from surviving records is any reference, by way of myth, text or art-work to the observation of a solar eclipse. The universal 'ill omen' cachet regarding eclipses, seems to have led to the belief and practice of not speaking of, much less memorializing such events. This presentation reveals that, in striking contrast to the usual rule, a solar eclipse which passed over the Western Nile Delta appears to have been commemorated in the royal inscriptions on twin stelae, located in Naukratis and Thonis-Herakleion, requiring Greeks to pay import duty. The (Julian) date of this eclipse, 5 November 380 BC, falls within two days of the Prior to the Hellenistic period, Egyptian priests were coyly mute in the matter of recording sky phenomena.

The (Julian) date of this eclipse, 5 November 380 BC, falls within two days of the Egyptian date inscribed on both stelae, presumably near the accession of the occult-loving King Nectanebo I. He seemingly reinterpreted the 'bad omen' tradition to fortell that his reign would be one of beneficence. The potential discovery of a previously unrecognised astronomical event should invite a re-examination of abnormal hieroglyphs on the Naukratis Stela, and may reconcile scholars to the apparent intermingling of ideologies of Egyptian scientific reticence, and the contrasting openness of Greek astronomical theories, in the 4th century BC.\n\n”The calculated location of the ancient solar eclipses could have an error of up to about 10 kilometers.” This statement by the U.S. Space Administration NASA is a scientific outstretching of how ancient eclipses can be found. When numerous eclipses observed in ancient times are applied to that measure set by science, they reveal a very significant secret of ancient history. Another significant factor is the lunar eclipses of the ancient Ur III dynasty. Can they be found? And what does everything have to be considered in order to find them? Why haven’t scientists discovered the double eclipse of Babylon?

Medieval written sources and modern geophysical models suggest that Mirian, whilst on a mountain top near the city of Mtskheta, may have observed a total solar eclipse (TSE). Adjusting for both visibility corrections and constraints on the accumulated clock error known as ΔT, we examine the local circumstances of the TSE of AD 6 May 319, which Gigolashvili et al. (Astronomical and Astrophysical Transactions 26, 199-201, 2007; Transdisciplinarity in Science and Religion 6, 217-221, 2009) recently proposed as the most likely natural explanation. If the basis for the legendary accounts of Mirian's conversion is this TSE-but we make no judgment upon this question-then the value of ΔT inferred from written sources agrees well with generally-accepted values, such as those derived by Morrison and Stephenson (Journal for the History of Astronomy 35, 327-336, 2004), namely, ΔT ≈ 7,450 ± 180 s. We also show the extent to which this TSE would have seemed remarkable to observers at Mirian's presumed location and less so to those nearby at lower elevations."
