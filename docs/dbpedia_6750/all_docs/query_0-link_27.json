        "text": "I recently went looking through the RAMS collection of alchemy texts, and I found another version of the Actum Leyden letter. This seems to be a translation by a man who actually did the process himself, and it has some incredible details added.\n\nThe title says \"A dying Cappucine monk left this tract to his beloved brother and signed it with his blood. Prague 3-29-1672\"\n\nAnd since the letter doesn't include the introduction by the monk and the whole letter is written in a summarized straight forward way, without the elegant wording used in the monks original letter from an earlier date, I think it's obvious this is re-write and also includes things not in the original letter which must have come from experience from actually doing the process himself and using the elixir.\n\nHere are some key differences:\n\n1. He says to fill the phial only half-way with dew salt water at the start of the process.\n\n2. A glass stopper is used and then sealed with lutem (plaster mixed with egg whites)\n\n3. He says the water itself will turn black, then deposit a gray salt on the sides on the phial when you put it over a low flame in Balneum Siccum instead of using a sand bath. (Balneo Siccum = sand bath). Then when you put it back in Balneum Mary, the gray salt is supposed to dissolve back into the water. Eventually by the 5th coagulation and dissolution, the salt will be white and the water will be clear. The salt is to be tested by putting it on a hot silver plate and seeing if it flows like wax. If it does, then it's to be placed back in the phial and the process continued.\n\n4. Instead of the dosage of only 5 drops, he says to administer 25 drops to completely cure a person of even the worst illness.\n\n5. Now he says to add a little gold oxide powder or fine gold leaf to the water little by little until it can't absorb anymore. Then carefully decant the solution from the undissolved gold into another phial which you fill only 1/4 full instead of 2/3.\n\n6. He says during the first 40 days of digestion you will see a lot of black matter. Then you put it over the low flame of the Balneum Siccum and you will see a beautiful display of colors, and you will hear a noise like water and ice, and you will observe the creation of the whole world. Then after 13 or 14 days it will change into a brownish red powder like red cinnabar. But if silver was used it will become like a clear crystalline matter.\n\n7. He says to take one part of this cinnabar powder and encase it in wax, and place it with 5 parts of gold in a closed container which you then heat over fire for one hour. After that hour, the gold will be brittle and will become the projection powder. You encase one part of this in wax, then mix it with 10 parts inferior metal like lead, and heat it to molten state but not in a closed vessel, and after one hour it will be changed to gold.\n\n8. He says you can take this red powder of the 1st order, put it in a phial and heat it gently in Balneum Mary waterbath for 35 days, and it will change into a beautiful red oil. The silver stone will become a blue oil (which makes sense because silver dissolved in acid becomes blue so maybe there is a chemical explanation for this Alkahest). He says 3 drop of this oil will heal all wounds, and cure all illness, and will keep a human healthy by making them loose all their hair and nails and they will grow back agian, new and youthful. (Just like the description of the Premum Ens of Melissa) He says it will also cure everything by raising your temperature and lost strength will be renewed shortly.\n\n9. Now the multiplication is different than the original letter -- he says to put the oil back into the Balneum Siccum digestion over the flame, and in 10 days it will transform itself back into a powder with the most beautiful colors, only much redder and prettier than before, glowing like a ruby or carbuncle. The blue oil from silver will become like snow. (At this point when he says glowing, I think he only means reflecting light brilliantly the way a ruby does, because this is not yet multiplied far enough to literally glow)\n\n10. Now he affirms that at this stage it's only at the 2nd multiplication because he says you use one part on 50 parts gold, and then 1 part of the projection powder on 100 parts inferior metal to transmute it to gold.\n\n11. To bring it to the 3rd order, you heat it again in the phial in the water bath Balneum Mary for 30 days this time instead of 35 and it becomes an oil. This time the oil from gold is dark red, and the one from silver is white instead of blue. Now what is remarkable is he actually say you can ingest this oil of the 3rd order as only 1 drop in wine, and it will cure all disease and make your nails and hair fall out then regrow and regenerate your whole body, but you must only take it twice in one year, or only once every 6 months, because it is so fiery it can kill you. He says you must be careful because both body and soul are affected.\n\n12. He says to bring it to the 4th multiplication, put it into the Balneum Siccum sand bath like before, and you will observe all sorts of color and living things moving up and down, and you will have a deep red powder at the end. Now 1 part is used on 500 parts gold to make the projection powder. And 1 part of the powder is used on 1000 parts inferior metal to transmute it to gold, still waiting an entire hour before letting it cool.\n\n13. He keeps going describing the multiplications, and eventually says he brought it all the way to the 5th and one part of the projection powder transmutes 100,000 parts lead to gold. He says he didn't go any further because it will penetrate the glass causing a \"delicious\" smell. He doesn't mention it glowing. Maybe it has to be brought to the 6th order to glow, and the only alchemists to achieve that are the ones who knew you needed quartz.\n\n14. He warns that during your work, many Fratres Rosea Crucis (Rosicrucians) will come to you because \"you have caused them to see it\". Apparently by psychic visions?\n\nThen he ends the letter as if the Actum Leyden was signing it with his own blood. So maybe this was the original version, and the other more vague letter with less details was the re-written version?\n\nI think this answers a lot of questions that we may have had because it tells us how to use the elixir and lets us know we can indeed ingest it in the 3rd order if we are careful to wait for 6 months first. And the multiplication are to be done without the alkahest water, which is a very important detail. That explains why my multiplications of gold weren't working! ha! I'm so glad I read this, because when I saw it, I just assumed it was the same letter and would be a waste of time to get out the CD and look it up, but boy am I glad I did! I would have been waiting forever for my gold to become a stone, and it never would have by sitting in the salt water like he original letter said!\n\nLast edited by NDC on Wed Feb 18, 2009 3:37 pm; edited 4 times in total\n\nI decided to go ahead and post the entire 2nd letter in it's entirety because this is simply too important to leave out. I think the people of the RAMS collection will understand the importance of this and not get upset.\n\nOh, and yes I also thought Actum Leyden was a strange name for a man and must have meant something different. If it was his name, then the title of the article would have included his name instead of just saying \"a cappucine monk\". Also because of the fact his letter reveals something he was sworn to secrecy to never reveal, I don't see why he would sign it with his real name.\n\n________________________________\n\nextracted from \"Potpourri Alchemia\"\n\nRAMSdigital.com library\n\nCD #3\n\nfilename: POTPOURRI1_original.PDF\n\nTHE UNIVERSAL PROCESS\n\n(BEING A TREATISE ON DEW)\n\nA dying Cappucine monk left this tract to his beloved\n\nbrother and signed it with his blood. Prague 3-29-1672\n\nIn the Name of God, take some of the whitest sea salt which the ships\n\nbring from the Island of St. Huber in Spain. First it should be calcined\n\nby the rays of the sun. Let this salt dry in a warm room, then\n\ngrind it in a glass mortar to a fine powder and dissolve it in dew.\n\nDuring the month of Mayor June, when there is a full moon, observe\n\nwhen dew is gathering while the wind is blowing from the east or south\n\nduring the day or the night before. Go to a field and drive some\n\nstakes of wood into the ground about 1 1/2 feet deep and in the shape\n\nof a triangle. This way, you can put a sheet of glass on top of the\n\nstakes. The dew can gather on this in the morning. Under it, have a\n\nfew glass containers handy into which the dew can flow. You have to\n\nrepeat this with many containers in order to collect enough dew. The\n\nfull moon quarter is best for this, afterwards it does not have enough\n\nstrength. Put the gathered dew into glass containers, lute them and\n\nstore them in the cellar until you need them.\n\nWhen you want to start this holy process, put as much as you want\n\nof the retained dew into a flask. Little by little, add some of the\n\nsea-salt powder. Continue with this until the water becomes saturated\n\nand you see undissolved sea-salt at the bottom of the flask. This is\n\nthe way it should be because the dew will have the right weight.\n\nTake a 1/2 pound of this solution and pour it into a shortnecked\n\nphial, filling it half way. Close the opening with a glass stopper and\n\nlute it, so that the Universal Spirit can not escape. Put the phial\n\ninto a water bath so that the dew can putrify. The dew has to digest\n\nfor 42 days and nights (a \"Philosophical Month\") over a low flame.\n\nYou will see the matter blacken which is the sign of Putrefaction.\n\n(Crow's Head) Put the phial into a Balneum Siccum and coagulate the\n\nwater over a gentle flame. This will take place within 14 days and nights.\n\nYou will see a gray salt coating the sides and bottom of the vessel.\n\nBefore this becomes too dry, remove it from the flame and let the phial\n\ncool a little. Then replace the phial back into the water bath over a\n\ngentle flame for 40 days and nights after which the salt will dissolve\n\nagain into the water. When it blackens again, put it back into the Balneum\n\nSiccum so the water can coagulate again. As soon as you see the\n\ngrey salt appearing, let it cool and put back in the water bath. Repeat\n\nthis process for a total of five times. The water should be light\n\nand clear as crystal and, after coagulation, the salt will be as white\n\nas snow.\n\nPut some of it onto a glowing metal plate. When. it flows like wax\n\nit is tested (proven). Do not take the salt out of the phial; put it\n\nback into the waterbath. It will dissolve again into water but will\n\nbe reduced by one third. Instead of salt water, you will have a sweet\n\nand drinkable water, the greatest medicine on earth. Give 25 drops of\n\nthis to a person and he will be cured of the most serious of illnesses.\n\nThere are much greater secrets in this water, but I am sworn to silence.\n\nYou will be able, yourself, to recognize enough of this power\n\nof Heaven and earth. Sapiente Sat is.\n\nIf you want to make a tincture of metals, proceed as follows:\n\nPour as much water into the phial as you need, put it well-luted in an\n\nashcupel over such a gentle flame so that the glass gets only warm. Open\n\nit and add little by little, some gold oxide or some finely laminated\n\ngold leaf, until the water cannot absorb any more. This you will be\n\nable to observe the following day, (you can proceed the same way with\n\nsilver, getting a white tincture - the work is the same). The water\n\nnow has the right weight with the gold added. Pour this solution, without\n\nthe undissolved gold (decant) into a clean phial, about 1/4 full.\n\nSeal it hermetically, put it into a water bath and let it stand over a\n\ngentle flame 40 days and nights. You will observe a lot of black matter.\n\nAs soon as this is observed, put it into the Balneum Siccum, once\n\nagain placing it over a gentle flame until you hear a noise like water\n\nand ice and see some beautiful colours and, most remarkably also, the\n\ncreation of the world! After the 12th. or 13th. day, it will change\n\ninto a reddish-brown powder like red Cinnabar. The White Tincture, however,\n\nwill transmute into a crystalline matter.\n\nThis red powder you can project onto metals in the following manner:\n\nTake five (5) parts of gold or silver, encase one part of the powder\n\nin wax and put it over the metal in a sealed container. This you stand\n\nover high heat for one hour. When you take the container off the fire,\n\nthe gold will be brittle.\n\nEncase one part of this brittle gold in wax & add it to 10 parts\n\nof inferiour metal in a liquid state. After one hour, this will have\n\ntransformed into best gold.\n\nI advise you to be carefull with this powder, do not waste it.\n\nIf you put this reddish-brown powder in a phial in the waterbath, you will\n\nhave a red oil within 35 days and nights. With silver you will have a\n\nlight blue oil. If you take 3 drops of this oil with champagne, it can\n\nheal all wounds, it radically cures all illnesses, it will keep a human\n\nhealthy to the end of his days by making him lose all his hair and nails\n\nand then making them grow back again, new and youthful. This also will\n\ncure everything by creating a high temperature and lost strength will\n\nbe regained within a short time. \"Quod per Deum testar possum.\"\n\nIf you put one end of a silver coin into the red oil, it will transform\n\nthis part into gold immediately without harming the print. If you want\n\nto project the oil still further, put it again into the Balneum Siccum.\n\nWithin 10 days it will transform into a powder with the most beautiful\n\ncolours, only, much redder and prettier than before, glowing like a ruby\n\nor carbuncle. With silver, the powder will look like snow.\n\nIf you put one part of this onto 50 parts of Molten Gold (if using\n\nsilver powder, use molten silver) and let this flow together vigorously\n\nfor one hour. The Gold or silver will transform into a tincture. Of\n\nthis, encase one part in wax and add it to 100 parts of molten metal\n\nover a high flame. You will have fine gold after one hour.\n\nIf you want to further augment your tincture, put the powder in a\n\nphial into a waterbath for a 3rd. time. Within 30 days you will have\n\na dark red oil from gold and a white oil from silver.\n\nOne single drop of this in wine will perform the already described\n\nwonders. You only take the dose two times a year, as this medicine is\n\nvery fiery. You have to be careful because both body and soul are affected.\n\nContinue with this oil a fourth time like before, putting the phial\n\ninto the Balneum Siccum. The oil will coagulate again. You will\n\nobserve all kinds of colours and living things moving up and down.\n\nIn the end it will become a dark red powder again.\n\nEncase one part of this powder in wax and add it to 500 parts of\n\nmolten gold (or, if using the white tincture, to molten silver). The\n\ngold or silver will transform into a tincture. Again, encase one part\n\nof this tincture in wax and add it to 1000 parts of inferior molten\n\nmetal, after one hour you will have the finest of gold or silver.\n\nYou will have to continue five times with this dissolution and coagulation\n\nof the first medicine. After the fourth coagulation you will have a tincture.\n\nOf this take one part and add to it 5000 parts of molten gold (or silver)\n\ntransforming it into a tincture. Take one part of the tincture and encase\n\nit in wax and add it to 10,000 parts inferiour metal in molten state.\n\nAfter an hour, it will all be the finest gold.(or silver).\n\nYou take the first powder or tincture,if, without fermenting it\n\nfurther and, after dissolving and coagulating it five times, you\n\nstrengthen and augment it, within 24 hours you will have an incredibly red\n\npowder or, from the white, a white crystalline powder. Of this last\n\ncoagulated powder put one part with a molten fifty mark gold coin (or\n\nwhite on silver). After one hour, the gold or silver will be a tincture.\n\nPut one part of this with 100,000 parts of molten inferiour metal.\n\nAfter one hour it will be exquisite gold.\n\nI got so far with this and no further. Otherwise it will seep through\n\nthe glass and disappear into the air with the most delicious smell.\n\nTake note, during your work, many Fratres Rosea Crucis will come\n\nto you because you caused them to see it.\n\nObserve, I wrote down this holy secret and swear by it on by belief\n\nof the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ. I sign this with my blood on\n\nmy death-bed, on my last day on earth."
