After a period of four years' continued inves- tigation and research, this new edition of \"James* Corruption of Scripture, Councils and Father* — by the Prelates, Pastors, and Pillars of the Church of Rome, for the maintenance of Popery,\" is now presented to the reader with little other confidence of success than is proportioned to a reliance upon the long-acknowledged value of the work itself, and upon very humble talents, which have been unremittingly devoted to the subject with the desire to render it as accurate as possible, and as well suited for the present time as for that, in which it at first appeared. The cause of its having been originally under- taken, it is unhesitatingly avowed, was the con- tinued developement of that movement, which has now for several years distracted the Church, and still unhappily continues a source of much trial and discomfort, inasmuch as the further it has progressed, so much the more has it been seen to approximate and to assimilate itself, to the worst features of Romanism, that it now can scarcely be called even a modification of the pernicious princi- ples, which have been universally diffused as the doctrines of the Roman-Catholic Church under the authority and decision of the Council of Trent. So long ago as four years since, it was perceived that great reliance was placed upon the writings of the Fathers by those most active in carrying on this a — 2 yj PREFACE. movement, and that great use was made of them to prop up and maintain a position, which, upon Scripture principles, was manifestly untenable; and this, notwithstanding it had long since been admitted by all the most eminent divines of our Protestant Church, best versed in the subject of polemical and theological controversy, that the task of ascertaining the minds of the Fathers, sometimes in pure matters of faith, and at others in doctrines and expositions, was so beset with difficulties, and surrounded by fallacies of no ordinary magnitude, as to render it impossible from the study of them, to come to an accurate judgment upon matters of essential moment, and upon any subject connected with the best interests of mankind. Independently of the impossibility, not to say absurdity, of being safe under such guidance, seeing that the Fathers, as uninspired men, were fallible, and that even the most learned of them had erred in fundamental points, the task of ascertaining their opinions has ever been surrounded with the greatest difficulties. Amongst those of the earliest ages, whatever might have been their sincerity and zeal, it is to be lamented that their judgments were not always accurate or in accordance with Scripture, or even positively satisfactory to themselves, that some were too much mixed with the philosophy of the age in which they lived, whilst others, from too great a contempt of secular learning, erred by the feebleness of their reasoning powers; and though many of them * brought to the support of Scripture evidence and to the maintenance of its doctrines and miracles PREFACE. yjj an excellence of skill in the dialectic art, yet it must ever be regretted that very many of these illustrious men were totally unfitted to be the exposi- tors and commentators of Scripture, and can, there- fore, rarely be consulted upon doctrines of importance with any extensive confidence, and much less can be received as acknowledged, or as positive authorities. To the reader of Church History it is also well known that many of the Fathers found it necessary to retract the writings of their early lives, after their judgments had become more matured; but, beyond these discrepancies of opinions amongst single expositors and individual Fathers, the artifice of the Church of Rome had, through a succession of centuries, so extensively prevailed, as at once to confound the student in the examination of the writings imputed to them, and to throw upon him the necessity of determining in most cases whether he was about to consult a genuine production of its reputed author, or whether it contained his mature and ultimate opinions, or whether such opinions, professed to be final, had not been mangled and corrupted by the authority of the predominant Church at that period, for the express purpose of giving further stability to its usurped authority: for it scarcely need be said, that the writers and apologists of this Church, (as this work will amply testify,) were at one time accus- tomed unhesitatingly to quote spurious works, attributed to some one or other of the Fathers, in support of one system of doctrine, and at another to renounce and repudiate them altogether to suit the purpose then in hand. ^JJJ PREFACE. The impossibility of being safe under such guidance is also further evident from the difficulty of ascertaining the accuracy of the text of these writers. If the manuscripts of historians and poets, in which civil passions have rarely been intermin- gled, have suffered so largely from corruptions and vitiation in the course of the few centuries that have elapsed from their first publication, and if, (as has manifestly been the case,) the writings of the divines of a century so near to our own, as the 17th, have been both mutilated and garbled in quotation to make them speak for a system, which the writers themselves, could they have lived to have witnessed the attempt to introduce it, would have viewed with disgust, and undoubtedly would have used all the energies of their gifted minds to overturn, it cannot but easily be conceived that the manuscripts and early printed works of the so-called Fathers of the Christian Church have undergone more hazard of vitiation and corruption than almost any other works that are now extant. During the many controversies of the Church, in the heat and distraction of the schisms and heresies which embarrassed the early ages, there is often strong ground to suspect that they had been corrupted in numerous places to suit the views of the contending parties, that they had also suffered as much from the ignorance and carelessness of transcribers as they had from design, and that before, and even after the immediate introduction of printing, when the facilities of interpolation were so easily afforded, they had been mutilated by Papal advocates, and texts and portions had PREFACE. IX either been wrenched out of them by the JExpur- gatory Indices, or introduced into them by the like arrogant tyranny. The great object of the author of this work was therefore to point out the perversions and interpolations, which were characteristic of the sys- tem of the Papal hierarchy from the first foun- dation of its power, and which had reference to one object only, — to establish a supremacy over the minds of the laity by a sort of pseudo-scripture, or adaptation of principles totally foreign to the spirit and intention of the word of God, in order that it might advance its own ambition and tyranny in spiritual matters over the flock of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the present state of affairs connected with the movement already alluded to, the same intention appears unhappily to be prevalent, and therefore this work has been carefully revised and corrected, and is now given to the public with the hope that it may tend in some measure to clog the wheel, which of late years has been rapidly rolling onward, and increasing in frightful speed towards the fastening upon the nation a system, which, if not entirely and essentially Popish, at least has assumed some of the worst features, and promul- gated many of the most pernicious principles of that corrupt Church. Of the value of the work, the use which the Rev. William Goode has made of it in his admi- rable work, intitled The Divine Rule of Faith and Practice, will amply testify. Care has been taken by every practicable method to verify the x PREFACE. numerous references it contains by a personal investigation. In the first part, Of the Bastardy of the false Fathers^ from pp. 1 — 74, the original text has been somewhat departed from, it having been deemed advisable to substitute the notes for the text, and the text for the notes, to render it more readable, and less distracting from the mul- tiplicity of references. Memoirs of Dr James have also been added, as well as an entire analysis of the work from Oldys' Librarian. The Editor gladly avails himself of this means of returning his grateful acknowledgement of the kind- ness of those friends, who have afforded him assist- ance in his laborious investigation; amongst whom he is especially bound to name the Rev. F. Howes, Librarian of the Hon. and Rev. the Dean and Chapter's Library at Norwich, for the facilities afforded him in verifying the references; to Mr C. J. Stewart, of King William Street, West Strand, London, as well as to the Rev. Richard Walker, of Magdalene College, Oxford, and the Rev. P. Hall, of Chelsea, who furnished him with copies of the editions of 1612, and 1688. MEMOIRS OF THOMAS JAMES, D.D. [Extracted from Wood's Athence Oxonienses, Tom. i. cols. 537 — 540. Ed. London, 1721.] Thomas James, or Jamesius as he writes himself, was born in the Isle of Wight, (at Newport as it seems,) educated in grammatical s in Wykeham's school, and in academicals in New College, of which he became perpetual fellow in 1593, where drudging day and night in several sorts of learning, he proceeded in arts in 1599. About that time being taken into the favour of Mr (afterwards Sir) Thomas Bodley for his excellent worth in the knowledge of books, as well printed as written, and of the ordering of them, he was by him designed the first keeper of the Public Library at Oxon then in founding; which office being confirmed to him by the University in 1602, he did much good therein, and laid a most admirable foundation for his successors to build upon. In 1614 he took the degrees in divinity, and having about that time the subdeanery of Wells conferred upon him freely without seeking by the Bishop of that place, and the parsonage of Mongeham in Kent with other spiritualities by the Archbishop of Can- terbury without asking, he resigned his place of keeper of the Public Library, (being about that time also a justice of peace) and betook himself more severely to his studies. He was very well read in the Fathers and Schoolmen, and so much versed in several faculties, that he was esteemed by some a living library. He was also indefati- gable in reading old MSS. and subtle in finding out the forgeries in them. He and Allen of Gloucester Hall were esteemed as most know- ing in the ancient statutes and customs of this University, and there- fore their helps in the several attempts made of framing an entire and complete body of them, were often desired. He was a member of the convocation held with the parliament at Oxon, 1 Car. I. wherein he made a motion that some persons might be commissioned to peruse the manuscript Fathers in all public and private English libraries, that thereby the forgeries of foreign popish editions might be detected, but what the event of it was I know not. His designs were always for the public benefit of learning, and the English church ; which being well known to his learned friend William Camden, he therefore saith thus' of him, \" He is a learned man, and a true lover of books, wholly * In Britan. Edit. 1607. in com. Monmouth. xii MEMOIRS OF THOMAS JAMES. dedicated to learning, who is now laboriously searching the libraries of England, and purposes that for the public good, which will be to the great benefit of students.\" Our author, Dr James, saith also of himself thus, in 1624, that b \"if Cambridge will set up and set forward the like\" (that is, to collate and examine ancient MSS. as he hath done and will do) \"I dare undertake more good to be done for the profit of learning and true religion, than by building ten colleges. I have of late given myself to the reading only of MSS. and in them I find so many and so pregnant testimonies, either fully for our religion, or against the papists, that it is to be wondered at, that the religion of papists then and now do not agree,\" &c. He also farther tells us, that \" not only the Rabbins, but the Talmud in six volumes at Rome hath felt the smart of the popish indices : would God we were but half as diligent to restore, as they to abolish and put out, the truth. I have restored three hundred citations, and rescued them from corruption in thirty quire of paper, with sundry other projects of mine, which if they miscarry not for want of maintenance, it would deserve a prince's purse. If I was in Germany, the states would defray all my charges : cannot our estates supply what is wanting? If every churchman, that hath an £100. per annum and upward, will lay down but a shilling for every hundred towards these public works, I will undertake the reprinting of the Fathers, and setting forth five or six volumes of orthodox writers, comparing of books printed, with printed or written; collating of popish translations in Greek, and generally whatsoever shall concern books, or the purity of them; I will take upon me to be Magister S. Palatii in England, if I should be lawfully thereunto re- quired,\" &c. \"The first thing I meet with that this Thomas James set forth was a true copy, by a collation of various manuscripts, of a book, entitled, Philobiblon Ricardi Dunelmensis, &c. Oxon. 1599, 4to. Before which our author James set an epistle dedicated to Sir Thomas Bodley, and at the end put Appendix de Manuscripts Oxoniensibus\" As for his other works that are printed, they are these.

This Ecloga doth contain a catalogue of all the MSS. in each college library in the University of Oxford, but not of those in the public, and in each college library in Cambridge, and in that of the public there. In the making of which catalogue he had liberty given to him by each college in Oxford to peruse their MSS. and from that society which he perceived was careless of them, he borrowed and took away what he pleased, and put them forthwith into the Public Library. Several such MSS. were taken from Baliol college, and some from Merton, and do yet bear in their respective fronts the names of the donors of them to those houses.

The Latin out of the MS. is set down in one column, and the English in another, by the publisher. This, I say, is reported to have been published by our author James, though others tell us that it was done by William Crashaw of Cambridge. How- soever it is, sure we are, that it hath supplied with matter a certain scribbler named Henry Care in his Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome, when he was deeply engaged by the fanatical party, after the popish plot broke out in 1678, to write against the church of England, and the members thereof, then by him and his party supposed to be deeply inclining towards popery, &c. I say by that Henry Care, whose breed- ing was in the nature of a petty-fogger, a little despicable wretch, and one that was afterwards much reflected upon for a poor snivelling fellow in the Observators published by Roger L'Estrange : which Care, after all his scribbles against the papists, and the men of the church of England, was, after King James II. came to the crown, drawn over so far by the Roman catholic party for bread and money sake, and nothing else, to write on their behalf, and to vindicate their pro- ceedings against the men of the church of England, in his Mercuries, which weekly came out, entitled Public Occurrences truly stated. The first of which came out 21 Feb. 1687, and were by him continued to the time of his death, which happening 8 Aug. 1688, aged 42, he was buried in the yard belonging to the Blackfriars' church in London, with this inscription nailed to his coffin, \" Here lies the ingenious Mr Henry Care, who died,\" &c. This person I can compare to none more than to Marchemont Nedham, whose parts though he wanted, yet they were weather-cocks both alike, as I shall tell you more at large when MEMOIRS OF THOMAS JAMES. xv I shall borne to that person, which will he in the 2nd vol As for our learned and industrious author Dr James, he paid his last debt to nature in his house in Holywell, in the north suburb of Oxford, in the month of August, in sixteen hundred, twenty and nine, aged about 58 years, and was buried towards the upper end of New college chapel, leaving behind him this character, that, \" he was the most industrious and indefatigable writer against the papists, that had been educated in Oxford since the reformation of religion.\" Which character being made manifest by his writings, it would have been esteemed as gene- rous an act for the society of that house, to have honoured his memory with a monument and epitaph, as they did those of Thomas Lydiat the mathematician. [Extracted from The General Biographical Dictionary, revised and enlarged, by Alexander Chalmers, F.S.A. Vol. xvra. pp. 449 —456. Ed. London, 1814.] James, (Thomas), a learned English critic and divine, was born about 1571, at Newport in the Isle of Wight; and, being put to Win- chester-school, became a scholar upon the foundation, and thence a fellow of New college in Oxford, 1593. He commenced M.A in 1599; and the same year, having collated several MSS. of the Philobiblion of Richard of Durham, he published it in 4to. at Oxford, with an ap- pendix of the Oxford MSS., and dedicated it to Sir Thomas Bodley, apparently to recommend himself to the place of librarian to him, when he should have completed his design. Meanwhile James proceeded with the same spirit to publish a catalogue of all the MSS. in each college library of both Universities ; and in the compiling of it, having free access to the MSS. at Oxford, he perused them carefully, and, when he found any society careless of them, he borrowed and took away what he pleased, and put them into the public library. These instances of his taste and turn to books effectually procured him the designation of the founder to be the first keeper of the public library; in which office he was confirmed by the university in 1602. He filled this post with great applause; and commencing D.D. in 1614, was promoted to the subdeanery of Wells by the bishop of that see. About the same time, the archbishop of Canterbury also presented him to the rectory of Mongeham in Kent, together with other spiritual preferments. These favours were undeniably strong evidences of his distinguished merit, being conferred upon him without any application on his part. In 1620, he was made a justice of the peace; and the same year re- signed the place of librarian, and applied himself more intensely to his studies. Of what kind these were, we learn thus from himself: \" I CTi MEMOIRS OF THOMAS JAMES. have of late,\" says he in a letter, May 23, 1624, to a friend, \" given myself to the reading only of manuscripts, and in them I find so many and so pregnant testimonies, either fully for our religion, or against the papists, that it is to he wondered at.\" In another letter to arch- bishop Usher, the same year, he assures the primate he had restored three hundred citations and rescued them from corruptions, in thirty quires of paper. He had before written to Usher upon the same sub- ject, Jan. 28, 1623, when having observed that in Sixtus Senensis, Al- phonsus de Castro, and Antoninus' Surmrut, there were about five hundred bastard brevities and about one thousand places in the true authors which are corrupted, that he had diligently noted, and would shortly vindicate them out of the MSS. being yet only conjectures of the learned, he proceeds to acquaint him, that he had gotten together the flower of the English divines, who would voluntarily join with him in the search. \" Some fruits of their labours,\" continues he, \" if your lordship desires, I will send up. And might I be but so happy as to have other twelve thus bestowed, four in transcribing orthodox writers, whereof we have plenty that for the substantial points have maintained our religion (£40. or £50. would serve); four to compare old prints with the new ; four other to compare the Greek translations by the papists, as Vedelius hath done with Ignatius, wherein he hath been somewhat helped by my pains; I would not doubt but to drive the papists out of all starting-holes. But alas ! my lord, I have not en- couragement from our bishops. Preferment I seek none at their hands ; only £40. or £60. per annum for others is that I seek, which being gained, the cause is gained, notwithstanding their brags in their late books.\" In the convocation held with the parliament at Oxford, 1625, of which he was a member, he moved to have proper commissioners appointed to collate the MSS. of the fathers in all the libraries in England, with the popish editions, in order to detect the forgeries in the latter. This project not meeting with the desired encouragement, he was so thoroughly persuaded of the great advantage it would be both to the protestant religion and to learning, that, arduous as the task was, he set about executing the task himself. We may form a probable conjecture of his plan, from a passage in the just cited letter to Usher, where he expresses himself thus : \" Mr Briggs will satisfy you in this and sundry other projects of mine, if they miscarry not for want of maintenance : it would deserve a prince's purse. If I was in Germany, the state would defray all charges. Cannot our estates supply what is wanting? If every churchman that hath £100. per annum and upwards, will lay down but Is. for every hundred towards these ' public works, I will undertake the reprinting of the fathers, and set- ting forth of five or six orthodox writers, comparing of books printed with printed or written; collating of popish translations in Greek and generally whatsoever shall concern books or the purity of them. I will take upon me to be a magister of S. Patalii in England, if I be thereunto lawfully required.\" He had made good progress in this undertaking, and no doubt MEMOIRS OF THOMAS JAMBS. jyft would have proeeeded much farther towards completing his design, had not he heen prevented by death. This happened August 1629. He was buried towards the upper end of New college chapel at Oxford. Wood informs us, that he left behind him the character of being the most industrious and indefatigable writer against the papists, that had heen educated in Oxford since the reformation ; and in reality his designs were so great, and so well known to be for the public benefit of learning and the church of England, that Camden, speaking of him in his life- time, calls him \" a learned man and a true lover of books, wholly dedi- cated to learning; who is now laboriously searching the libraries of England, and proposeth that for the public good which will be for the great benefit of England.\" His works are, 1.

[Extract from The British Librarian^ EOldys',] No. IV. for April, 1737, pp. 202—210, Ed. London, 1738, (relating to the present work.)] XXXV. A Treatise of the Corruption of Scripture, Councils and Fathers, by the Prelates, Pastors, and Pillars of the Church of Rome, for maintenance of Popery and Irreligion. By Thomas James, Student in Divinity, and Chief Keeper of the Public Library in Oxford, &c. \"With a sufficient answer unto James Gretser and Antony Pos- seyine, Jesuits, and the unknown Author of The Grounds of the Old Religion and the New. Divided into Five Parts. Lond. Quarto. 1612. The learned author of this work, in his dedication to George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, tells him, \"he has written this book in English for the benefit of his poor seduced countrymen, who are per- suaded by the priests and Jesuits that 'there is no such matter, and that their books are freest from corruption, and minds from falsehood ; that Protestants are guilty of this crime, and sundry others. But as St Austen observed of heretics, that they were shameless and impudent, without foreheads, not caring what they said: so it is with the papists; they do not only impudently deny, but wickedly translate the crime from themselves unto others. For if forging false treatises, or cor- ruption of the true ; changing of scriptures, or altering of mens words, contrary to their meaning, be certain notes of heresy, how heretical then must the church of Rome be, wherein this doctrine of corruption is both openly taught and professed? As their Indices Expurgctiorii, the printing of the Fathers' works at Rome, and the evidence of the fact doth plainly declare. All which is plainly shewed in this small treatise, and whatsoever else doth tend thereunto/' Then he observes how his said patron, the Archbishop, had long since in his book against Hill, begun to discover this devilish policy of the common adversary, and his grace's example has encouraged him to proceed therein, and emboldened him to consecrate his labours with himself, wholly at his grace's disposition. ANALYSIS OF THE WORK. ^ After this address, which gives, in this part we have here extracted, a glimpse of the contents of the work hefore us, we have an ample Advertisement to the Christian Reader, wherein he tells him, that ** having fully travelled this vast wilderness of sin, I have thought it my duty to leave certain land-marks behind me, for their direction \"which shall come hereafter.\" The whole book is resolved into five parts : the first shews, The Bastardy of the False Fathers, and in this part these few things are to be noted: that there are 187 several treatises, here distinctly produced, which are shrewdly suspected, if not plainly convicted of forgery by the papists themselves. That our author follows herein the judgment of their most esteemed writers, such as Bellarmine and Baronius, Possevine and Gretser, Sixtus Se- nensis, Angelus Roccha, Pamelius, and sundry others ; sometimes though seldom, citing Erasmus, or following his censure, because the papists say he was an apostate ; though he defended the religion, then openly maintained, against (Ecolampadius, Melancthon, Martin Luther, and others; was accounted in the bosom of the church, and saluted by the name of son, by Adrian VI. and Leo X. And however he was accused for a Lutheran, seeing his apology satisfied the pope in his life-time, why should the papists traduce him being dead? Though he were in heart and profession a papist, God made him write against the abuses of popery, rather than against the religion itself, as him- self says. But leaving him, let them consider the rest who were in- flexible papists, and see here how the best of them are driven to censure these treatises, yet enforced to make use of them, abusing the simple reader, by the frequent citation of Clement, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augus- tine, Jerome, and the rest, when no one scrip of their writings is alleged; yet Cocceius, their master, has been bold to set down the age when every one of these fathers lived, to those bastard treatises, which themselves never saw. Our author begins his said catalogue, in this first part with Abdias, who lived in the time of St Paul, and ends it with Isidore, who flourished not long after St Gregory; yet, in this part, he comprises not all the treatises of the Fathers who lived within the six hundred years, condemned by papists, nor many more detected by the Protestants, but only those he finds cited by the papists in their books of controversy ; especially when they are alleged to gain credit with the simple people; which they well might do, since some learned men here named have been deceived, to cite these forgeries, as the works of the Fathers, who lived before Luther's time, so they could not be forged by Protestants, who according to the opinion of the papists derive their origin from him. And as to their being cited sometimes by learned Protestants also, it is but reasonable, as one side has used them for their convenience, that they should be as free for the other. After this catalogue, which comprehends 71 pages, we have a list of the names of the authors whose books are cited ; and a brief table wherein is declared, the use that papists make of these bastard treatises : with another table, shewing who they were written by, or ascribed to, and the characters of them. Thus we come to b ANALYSIS OF THE WORK. Part II. Of the Corruption of the True Fathers, wherein is the greater danger, because it may spread farther before espied. And here our author takes the word Fathers in a large sense, extending it as far as Gregory de Valentia does, unto the best learned of all ages. His observations are taken from the most learned Protestants, and par- ticularly his chief encourager the learned Dr Bilson, Bishop of Win- chester. Further, this part contains 50 proofs of corrupted places in these ecclesiastical writers. In the 26th proof, there is a story rehearsed by our author of Bishop Jewel, who citing St Gregory's Epistles, in a visitation sermon, at Abingdon in Berkshire, was defamed for cor- rupting his author's sense; which caused all the MS. of that Father to be searched, whereby it was found, that the popish editions only were corrupted, that the Bishop had quoted the genuine sense, and that those who charged such corruptions upon him were themselves most guilty of them. Our author concludes this part, with his wishes for a Protestant edition of the councils; and observes, that Dr Ward, Master of Sidney Sussex College, in Cambridge, had bestowed many years' pains in this way, and that his endeavours would tend to ex- cellent purposes, if he might be prevailed on to publish them; but if any thing keep him back, it is an humble conceit he has ever had, to think himself so much the less able, the more sufficient others esteem him. This part is comprised in 103 pages, and has in another page, the names added, of the authors and pages corrupted. Part III. The Variety and Contrariety of the popish Bibles, commonly called the Vulgar Bibles in Latin. Our author's motives for publishing this part were, first, because it is a matter of faith to appoint what is scripture, and what not, to shew that the Pope may err in matters of faith. Secondly, because papists object to us our different translations of the Bible, to shew their own gross errors and absurdities, in setting forth their two Jerome Bibles, authorized by two popes within two years. Thirdly, to vindicate his Bellum Papale, wrote against these two discording editions, from some objections to the same, lately published by James Gretser. In this part it further appears, these Bibles were set forth by Pope Sixtus in 1590, and Pope Clement, 1592. And what sentences or words were added by Pope Cle- ment, which were not in the edition of Sixtus : also the sentences or words left out by Clement, which were in the Bibles of Sixtus; with the contradictions of one against the other : errors in numerical compu- tations; transposition of names, and other alterations of the sense: to which follows, an apology or defence of the Bellum Papale, pub- lished by our author against those Bibles, 4to. 1600. In which he tells us, how he came to engage himself against those editions ; recites the pompous inscription set up in the Vatican in honour of Sixtus, upon his said publication, with the apologies of some Jesuits for the errors therein ; as Baldwin, Dr Norrice, and Dr Bishop ; also some answers to Gretser 1 8 allegations against our author : with an account of Arias Montanus* Apology, for his integrity in setting forth the King's Bibles, containing the whole history of his troubles in the progress of that ANALYSIS OF THE WORK. XxJ costly work; the copy of which was found at the sack of Cadiz', and by Dr Rives deposited in the Library at Oxford; this with a rehearsal of some sentences that are yet found uncorrected, or rather added unwarrantably to the vulgar Bible ; also some further answers to his antagonist, and a character of him, concludes this Part, in 59 pages'. Part IV. Of their Condemning the Fathers. For though the papists do much boast of their Fathers, and vulgarly seem to value their writings, yet it is found that none are more injurious to their works or their worth, \"using them as merchants do their casting counters; sometimes they stand for pounds, sometimes for shillings, sometimes for pence, sometimes for nothing, according as they be next and readiest at hand to make up their accounts.\" In this part, our author acknowledges himself much indebted to the second part of the Dean of Winchester's Apology, and to Samuel Huberus, in his Anti'BeUarminus. And having proved these assertions, he proceeds to lay open the mystery and abuses of the Indices Expurgatorii ; shews you the original, nature, use and corruption of this inquisition; the officers, inquisitors, commissaries, and public notaries, concerned in these Indices of Books to be forbidden, or purged from whatever im- pugned the Church of Rome. And here he commends the treatise written by Gabriel Putherbeus, Be toUendis Libris malis, 1549, as what has discovered the wickedness of their bishops, priests, and monks, better than any work our author knows. In the latter end of this part, we have a table of the divinity books, first set forth and approved, then censured by the papists. This catalogue contains 323 of their said forbidden books, which are often noted in what parts they have been purged : among them there are some of our own authors ; as Alcuinuer, whose book de Trinitate, ad Carolum Regem, printed in Bibl. Patrum, is falsely, by Sixtus Senensis and others, attributed to Calvin : though indeed their names are one by a metathesis and change of the letters. Whereas copies of it, written above 500 years ago, were to be seen in the Prince's Library at St James's, and elsewhere. St Adhelm, Bishop of Sherbourn, has also incurred the Roman censure ; and the Sums of Richard Fitz-Rauf, Archbishop of Armagh, against the Armenians, with his other treatises, are cautioned against, as printed Anno 1511, by Possevine; and in Bishop Fishers book, de Fiducia Dei, the papists, finding some points against them, have pretended it was printed by some heretic in his name, and even by Calvin ac- cording to Gregory Capuchine. A silly shift ; for the book was printed at Cologne, in 8vo. 1556, shortly after his death; and since then no such matter was ever heard, till of late years. \" A very likely matter (says our author) that the papists would suffer such a piece of knavery to lie buried so long. Again, what reason have Protestants to counter- feit such a book in a papist's name ? Seeing their Indices of books forbidden, and to be purged, do furnish us with a sufficient number « [Printed in the early editions of I Calais^-Ed.J \" James' Corruptions,\"— .Cafe*,— i. e.

So much the more are we kindly beholden unto them, first for sending us unto the best books, by their catalogue of books prohibited, and secondly, for directing us unto the best places to be read in those books, by their Indices Ex- purgatoriu' Nay, Gildas Sapiens was not so wise, as to see that his works should come to be censured at Rome, for otherwise he would to be sure have prevented them, and retracted his opinion. Much less could William of Occham's Dialogues, his Works of 90 Days, and his writings against Pope John XXII. escaped the catalogue of books forbidden : besides some others of our countrymen in this table also mentioned. At the end of which we have a little summary of the uses thereof, under the consideration of what Popes, Patriarchs, Bishops, Cardinals, Fathers, Saints, Martyrs, &c. Councils, Liturgies, Prayer-Books, Bibles, &c. are censured therein; also by what degrees books have been corrupted ; with what opposition; the inquisitors being still at odds with us and themselves; what popish authors, through all ages, have maintained the truth of our religion ; what books and editions are to be read by Protestants : lastly, what is constantly denied by the papists, that the text of the Fathers' works is commanded to be purged in their several Indices Eccpurgatorii, and plainly proved in this Table, by the mark of a hand in the margin. In this table, our author doubts not but many writers have slipped his pen, wherein he desired not exactness, but to give you a taste only of that sour fruit, which they have grafted upon other men's stocks. He has cited nothing without a sufficient author or authority. And as for the books of law, physic, and the arts, which the papists have thus mangled and disfigured, they are reserved for some other time, this part ending at p. 102*. Part V. A Remedy against all popish Corruptions, Herein the author shews how vain it is to find out the diseases in books, without we endea- vour to find out the remedies also. This last part, containing 27 pages h , begins with an account of the sundry ways how books are depraved and corrupted, and three ways proposed for reforming the same. That the discovery of false treatises, in the name of the Fathers, has in part been made by the Bishop of Winchester, Dr Reynolds, Abraham Scultetus, and especially Master Robert Cook of Leeds. How the cor- ruption of the true Fathers is to be known: and that those places purged by the inquisitors are to be restored as fast by the Protestants. Of a catechism to be framed for us out of their writings : and how papists are to be answered by papists. The collations of this kind by Mr W. Crashaw, of the Temple, commended. How the Romish falsi- fications might be shortly discovered, by dividing the examination among many divines. The profit of collating printed books, with the Indices Eocpurgatoriu Their late corrected editions to be considered and sus- pected. Of their pretended discovery of lost writers in caves, mountains, « [i. e. of the edition of 1612.J [»» i. e. in the same edition.] ANALYSIS OF THE WORK. &c TTie popish editions of the Fathers to be onptied with ancient MSS. How the Fathers were corrupted before, and since printing: the way's of correcting them. Our universities and private libraries well stored with MSS. notwithstanding the great consumption of them in England. An exhortation to private men not to monopolize, bat communicate their MSS. seeing that how commendably soever they preserve them, little use can be made of them, nor their authorities safely vouched, since they are not always to be seen, while such owners are living; and, when they die, may easily miscarry, by falling into the hands of such as regard them not; by whom, as one merrily said, monyscripts are more pored upon than manuscripts. That the neglect of the Fathers has proceeded from the false editions of them: and that there would be an end of controversy, if their works were truly printed. An objection from the divers readings of ancient MSS. Another against the antiquity and integrity of copies ; with answers. The satisfaction of small differences in copies. Our English MSS. highly esteemed beyond seas. Our founders of colleges careful to furnish their libraries with rare MSS. maintaining divers scholars abroad, to compare, transcribe, or procure originals. That Richard Dunelmensis, founder of Duresme College, now called Trinity College, bestowed many thousand pounds per annum in books, and most of his books upon the library he erected in that college, who, for his exceeding great love of learning, did well deserve the name of Philo-biblos : see his book, Be Amort Librorwn, printed at Oxford, 1598. De eo dictum erat, quod haberet plures Libros quam omnes Pontiflces in Anglia. Which title and character, since his time, is most justly to be given to Sir T. Bodley, whose great muni- ficence has far surpassed the Bishop, having stored his magazine, as our author observes, with eleven or twelve thousand volumes ; whereof the greatest part are in folio, in all sciences and languages, and fre- quented by scholars of all nations. Here follows the confession of his adversaries, Possevine and Costerus, of the goodness and plenty of our books ; the way of discerning corrected copies, and to know if they be ancient or not. That those which are written in a set hand, with great letters, or in the Lombard or Saxon characters, are of great antiquity; how far later MSS. to be esteemed of. The objection, that it is a tedious and needless work to collate the Fathers* works, with MSS. answered. The benefit likely to arise of a general collation. Commendations of Erasmus, and wherein defective, in his Animad- versions upon the Fathers works. That he gave the first alarm of their barbarous corrupting the Fathers, for which his very name is in maledictione. Exhortation to our wealthy stationers to print tho Fathers* works ; such as Mr George Bishop, Mr Bonham Norton, and Mr John Norton, who have been chosen Aldermen of London. That the charge of printers and stationers ought to be well recompensed. They are compared to our merchants- adventurers. Why, tho hazard being alike in most books, they should seek rather to deserve well of the ancient Fathers. The Bible compared, revised, and printed this year, 1611.

The Latin Fathers, more urged in all controversies, should be the sooner correctly printed. The collation and revision of the Fathers' works, a good inducement to the printing of them. The use that is made of the MSS. indifferently, both by Protestants and papists; whereof, though much remains to be spoken, our author, like a weary traveller, here takes up his rest; which indeed he might well need, having gone through such a variety of books, as this work does mani- fest; and really held it, as Baronius pretended to do, a religion, to say nothing which he could not prove, and to prove nothing but out of certain, known, and sufficient authors. At the end of his advertise- ment mentioned at the beginning, there is an appendix, shewing first, how there are scribes diligently employed in the Vatican Library, to transcribe acts of the Councils, or works of the Fathers; that they can imitate their copies exactly ; that it is feared they alter and change at the Pope's pleasure; and that these transcripts in time may be vouched for ancient MSS. And this is more to be feared, if there is an Index Expurgatortos for purging of MSS, as well as printed books. Secondly, that the unknown author of the Grounds of the Old Religion, and the New, so often mentioned in this work, is now known to be one May, a priest, a man neither immodest nor unlearned, yet foully mistaken in sundry points of his answer to Mr Crashaw's first Tome of Romish Forgeries and Falsifications. What we have lastly to observe, is, that at the end of the whole book, there is a table of the authors mentioned in this treatise, with the particular editions made use of throughout the same. TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE*, BY GOD'S PROVIDENCE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, PRIMATE AND METROPOLITAN OF ALL ENGLAND, AND ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL. The fruit of my small labours, and the labours of some few years, I here present unto your Grace; to whom they do of right belong, and are most deservedly due, for many respects. They were begun, not without your Grace's know- ledge, some few years passed ; continued with your lordship's most honourable favour and liberal beneficence, and ended as I trust to your good liking. Your Grace hath long and zealously expected a reformation of the ancient Fathers' works, either negligently or fraudulently put forth by the adversary ; and that the trial hereof, some of our men would undertake in Gregory, lately put out at Borne, or some such other book. The trial hath been made, not only in Gregory, but in Cyprian also of the Roman prints, collated with sundry good manuscripts ; and according to your Grace's learned observation, we find, that the works of the most ancient are daily depraved by this sinful and deceitful Romish brood. The errors, not only of the print, but the falsehood of the papists, in Gregory's works of Rome, are collected and ga- thered together into one volume, and shortly to be published, having first passed your Grace's censure; those of Cyprian shall not be long after. But before the edition of these two books in Latin, I have thought it not unmeet to address this small treatise unto your Lordship, written in English for the benefit of my poor seduced countrymen, who are [* George Abbot, Fellow of Baliol, and Master of University College, Ox- ford, Dean of Westminster, was elected Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, May 27, 1609 ; was translated to Lon- don, Jan. 20, 1610, and from London to Canterbury, March 4, 1611, and died Aug. 4, 1633, aged 71.

These are true notes of a false church, in the judge- ment of Possevine, and other learned writers of their side. persuaded by the priests and Jesuits, that there is no such matter; and that their books are freest from corruption, and minds from falsehood; that Protestants are guilty of this crime, and sundry others. But as St Augustine observed of heretics, that they were shameless and impudent, without foreheads, not caring what they said: so is it with the papists, they do not only impudently deny, but wickedly translate the crime from themselves unto others. For, if forging of false treatises, or corruption of the true, chang- ing of scripture, or altering of men's words, contrary to their meaning, be certain notes of heresy, how heretical then must the church of Rome be, wherein this doctrine of corruptions is both openly taught and professed? f as their Indices Ex- purgatory, the printing of the Fathers' works at Rome, and the evidence of the fact do plainly declare. All which is plainly shewed in this small treatise, and whatsoever else doth tend thereunto. My desire is, to remove and prevent the Papists' objections, to satisfy the ignorant, to answer for myself; lastly, to prove by the event, that Rome is Ba- bylon, the Pope Antichrist, and that it is not without cause that the word \" mystery 1 *\" is engraven in the pope's triple diadem, (as those that do know it have testified,) a certain mark of that great mystery of iniquity and abomination of desolation sitting in the holy place. The bringing of ques- tions of faith unto matters of fact, (wherein the sight of the books may determine the question, and the eyes of the simple reader may be meet judges,) I have ever deemed the readiest way to compound the controversies of these times. If the papists be able to answer for themselves, let them shew forth better evidences : or if they cannot, why should they not yield unto a known truth ? against which, the malice of Satan,, the mystery of iniquity, the policy of the inquisition, nor the b James Brocard, a Venetian, that wrote a commentary on the Apoca- lypse, about sixty years ago, vouch- eth it for a certain truth; and of late years, one Friar Francis, a celes- tine monk, at the time of his con- version unto the reformed religion, in the church at Vendome, the 28th of Jan. 1601, professed openly that he had seen it in Pope Clement's diadem set in precious stones; the like hath been confirmed by sundry Dutchmen reporting it at Oxford, that had been at Rome, and not much denied of my certain knowledge by one of their greatest Jesuits here in England. THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY. XXV J£ gates of hell shall ever be able to prevail. I will conclude, with your Grace's words, taken out of your learned book against Hill : \" Have the papists, and do they so crack of the Fathers^ works every where, and are they now forced to raze them, and pare them, and blur them, else they cannot uphold their irreligion ? This is the case, of which I desire all my weak and abused countrymen to take notice.\" Thus your Grace long since hath begun most carefully to discover the devilish policy of the common adversary ; we that follow, are encouraged, by your worthy example, to go onward in the same discovery. And I doubt not, but by God's singular providence, your Grace hath been advanced unto this great dignity, for some special good of the church : in preserving the works of the ancient Fathers, Greek and Latin, entire ; or rescuing those that are decayed from the injuries of times, or men, maugre the Clementine college or Vatican print. Which hath emboldened me to consecrate my labours, present, or to come, together with myself, wholly, at your Grace's disposition, for the church or commonwealth; praying always for your Lordship's health, as for the common good ; resting both now and ever, Your Grace's humbly devoted Chaplain, THOMAS JAMES. AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. Christian Beadeb, There are some things whereof thou mayest please to be advertised, for the better understanding of that which followeth in process of this book : wherein a man may easily err, if his understanding be not led, or guided, by some few general observations, as being to pass through such an huge ocean, wilderness, or world of matter, never yet largely treated of; only pointed out or discovered by others. I know how unable and weak I found myself at the first, to undertake so long, tedious, and troublesome a journey. But thanks be unto the Lord Jesus, when I thought myself the least able, I found myself most sufficient; when other means failed me, God's grace did inwardly assist and encourage me : and to conclude, as the blessed apostle *St Paul said, \" When I was weak, then was I strong.\" In confidence, therefore, of God's exceed- ing goodness, grace, and favour, and nothing trusting to my own merit or worth, having now at the length overcome all the difficulties, passed these almost impassable mountains of Arabia, fully travelled this vast wilderness of sin, I have thought it my duty to leave certain land-marks behind me, for their direction which shall come after. The whole book, as you may perceive, is resolved into five parts; each part hath its proper office and function. The first shews The Bastardy of the False; the second, The Corruption of the true Fathers; the third, The sundry Varieties and Contra- » 2 Cor. xii. 10. XXX AN ADVERTISEMENT rieties of their Bibles ; the fourth, The open or secret wrongs done unto Fathers, ancient, middle-aged, or modern Writers, by the Papists, chiefly in their Indices Expurgatorii ; Fifthly and lastly, Particular Remedies against these several diseases, when and how to be applied, together with the use, profit, and commodity of the ancient manuscripts. Touching the first part, note these few things. First, that there are one hundred and eighty-seven divers treatises, which are shrewdly suspected, if not plainly convicted of forgery by the papists themselves. I follow herein the judgment of their best learned writers, most esteemed in their times ; such as Bellarmine and Baronius, Cardinals; Possevine and Gretser* Jesuits ; Sixtus Senensis, of the order of the Preachers, Angelus Boccha, an Eremite, Pamelius, a monk, and sundry others. Sometimes, though seldom, I name Erasmus, and follow his censure very sparingly, because the papists cannot endure him nor his books. b They disclaim him for a papist, and say he was an apostate ; I am sure he defended the religion then openly maintained, against (Ecolampadius, Melancthon, Mar- tin Luther, and others, was accounted in the bosom of the church, and saluted by the name of c Son, by Adrian VI., and Leo X., popes. He was accused for an heretic, espe- cially for a Lutheran : but d seeing his Apology satisfied the pope in his life-time, why should papists traduce him now he is dead ? God made him an especial instrument of his glory, and though he were both in heart and in outward profession, a papist, yet God made him write against the abuses of popery, rather than against popery itself. For, as himself reports it, he did e magis clamare in eos qui Pontificum auc~ toritate abutuntur, quam in ipsos Pontifices : \" rather tax the abuses of the religion then professed, than censure the religion,\" wherein he both lived and died.

XXXI behalf, out of his large volume of f Epistles, leaving Erasmus, let them consider of the rest that were without all question resolute papists : how the best of them, and chiefly Bellarmine, are driven to censure these treatises, and yet are enforced to make use of them now and then, will they nill they, unless they should betray the cause ; although far better it were, that the cause should be utterly forsaken, than maintained Jby such lewd, wicked, untrue, and insufficient means. And yet what more ordinary, than to abuse the simple reader by the frequent citation of Clement, Abdias, Linus, Dionysius, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and the rest, when no one scrip, or script of any of their writings is alleged : and yet Coccius, their muster-master, hath been bold to set down the age when every one of these Fathers lived, unto those bastard treatises which themselves never saw. Secondly; In the catalogue of these many treatises, which are censured by their own men for counterfeit and base stuff, not fit to be mentioned the same time that the Fathers are named, I omit their divers liturgies of Basil, James, Chry- sostom, or any other; or the g acts of Andrew, Peter, or the gospels of Thomas and Bartholomew, and many such impos- tures. I begin with Abdias, which lived in the time of St Paul, and end with Isidore, that lived not long after the time of St Gregory ; and this part doth not comprise all treatises of the Fathers, that lived within the six hundred years, con- demned by papists : I urge only those which I find cited by them, either directly or indirectly, in their books of contro- versy, especially when they are brought ad faciendum popu- turn, alleged before the simple people, to gain credit and reputation with them. Thirdly ; In my quotations, for brevity's sake, I cite not the book, chapter, and paragraph, as most men usually do; but the book, and the page of such or such editions, which are precisely noted in a h table by itself. And for the authorities, I have put this difference between them; some have letters, some have none, placed directly over the figures. f Eant procul a fidelium coetu— lon- geque longius exulent a Catholico orbe, qui quae corruere videntur, mendaciis suffulcire nituntur. Baron, Tom. vn. p. 154. s Condemned by Baronius. h In the latter end of this Treatise. jg^jj AN ADVERTISEMENT Such as have none, do indirectly appertain unto some contro- versy or other. The others directly concern such or such points controversed between us and the papists; and some counterfeit books, as Clement's Constitutions, and Dionysus 1 Celestial Hierarchy, do fully prove almost all points of popery, if they were not disproved by sundry learned men of their side. I know it will be replied, that Delrius, the Jesuit, hath rescued Dionysius from out of our hands, and that others will be ready to do the like for Clement, Abdias, and the rest. But the Jesuit Delrius hath written copiously, but not sufficiently, in defence of St Dionysius ; as shall, when time and occasion doth minister fit opportunity, be farther shewed. The rest may be defended by some ; but there will never be wanting others, of their own profession, that will immaflk their villanies, pull off their vizards from their faces, and discover their shame unto the eye of the world. And until the pope shall call a council of the best learned men, as 'Gehshis some- times did, and determine precisely and definitively which are the true native works of the Fathers, which the false, you shall have arma armis, et pUa minartfia pilis ; papist against papist, Belkrmine against Baronius, Baronius against Posse* vine, still at odds, and different in opinions. Would God, they were once agreed, which to take, and which to refuse. Fourthly; Besides such treatises as are censured by papists, which no doubt would be partial enough in censuring as fe* as might be, there are above twice as many treatises, which our best learned protestants, and most judicious writers, have challenged of corruption, by such pregnant circumstances, as k Sixtus Senensis, one of the best judgment among them, hath chalked out unto us in the end of his fourth book ; where he proveth these two points very pithily and briefly. I. That divers treatises have been counterfeited in the names of the ancient Fathers. II. How they may be discerned, descried, and discovered. Again, these treatises, whereof no one is here mentioned, are reserved for some fitter opportunity, when God shall give grace to perfect that work ; unless some other, that is better able to undergo this bookish burden, shall pre- 1 Est cnim Arbiter Scriptorum om- I Tom. vi. p. 462. k Page 325. nium Romania Pontifex ; Baron : TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. xxxiii Tent me : which I wish, and withal promise to give him the best directions I can* fifthly; Where I shew that these one hundred and eighty- seven treatises are censored by papists, and yet urged for maintenance of popery ; I imply not that all those that allege them wrote since these grievous censures, and heavy doom passed upon the books, for divers works were compiled, when no such censures were dreamed of; the authors lived many hundred years before, as Gratian, Aquinas, Peter Lombard, and Nicholas Lyra: but that which I infer is, that whatsoever account the learned papists make of these, and the like treatises now, because they have been proved to be very counterfeits : yet they have been heretofore, and are still, urged to the people by the priests and Jesuits, for sound proofs, ancient books, and most divine treatises; when they were indeed written by some ignorant friar, or unlearned monk or other, without either shame or honesty. Sixthly; Those books have wandered up and down, in the names of those ancient and grave Fathers of the church, whose titles they do bear. An argument whereof we have, in that they are cited under their names, by Gratian, Aquinas, Peter Lombard, and others. But it is furthermore better de- monstrated out of their and our ancient libraries; where by con- fession of the adversary, or due proof of our side, it is apparent that the books which carry manifest tokens of forgery with them in the judgment of the best learned papists, are extant in other men's names, and intituled unto the ancient Fathers of both churches, which never saw them. Whence are de- duced these few corollaries! that these treatises have been forged by papists, and not by protestants, whose religion was not *heard of, say they, until of late years. Secondly ; That their religion and church being built upon such weak proofs, must needs fall when the waves of disputation shall arise, and the winds of contention blow ; for it is built upon the sand, and not upon the rock of the Scriptures. Thirdly and lastly ; that the papists cannot avoid the blame and shame of the world, for suffering God's people to be so long abused with > They drew their pedigree no higher than from Luther. Matth. Kellison, in his Survey, p. 114. XXXIV AN ADVERTISEMENT copper instead of gold, and water instead of wine. And albeit, they should decree, with joint consent, to register all these treatises in their catalogues of books forbidden, whereof we see more reason than hope, their state being, as it is, always jarring, and the books so profitable unto them, yet what recompence can they make to so many poor souls, as have been hitherto persuaded by these slender motives to embrace their religion ? who, if they had known as much as we do, namely, that the authorities alleged were produced out of no authentic records, but came out of some monkish forge ; they would have willingly detested their religion, and avoided their corruptions. Lastly; Where it may be objected, that protestants, as well as papists, do make frequent use of some of these treatises, and do cite them as theirs in their books, as the Commentaries of St Jerome, and St Ambrose, upon the Epistles of St Paul: I answer, that it is not to be marvelled, if some of our learned protestants, admitting the books were written by them, whose names they do bear, do thence produce testimonies against you. For these old treatises may serve as well for us, as for you, according to that axiom in the law, m testem quern quis inducit pro se, tenetur recipere contra se. You have produced them for your own benefit, and therefore in reason you cannot disallow of them now, though it be to your great hindrance. But happily, it may be said in your defence, that if these treatises had been forged by monks and friars, as is sug- gested, how then cometh it to pass that there are so many- sentences found in them, which do mainly cross the doctrine of the papists ? If they had been forged by them, they would not have been so foolish as to have left any such weeds grow- ing, that might have infected the minds of the simple reader. This is an infallible token, that they never came out of their forge : for if they had had the penning of them, they should have contained an absolute form of popery in them. It is answered, that this were true, and the objection were something dangerous, if popery were so ancient as they bear men in hand, or that the papists were fully agreed upon every article m Spec.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. xxxv of their religion ; but to this day they are not, nor ever are likely to come to an agreement, for aught that I see. And, therefore, no marvel, if they write one against another, and in some points or other join with the protestants ; and were it not, that they are kept in with a strong hand, and restrained with the power of a severe inquisition ; they would, both priests and Jesuits, freely accord with us in many points, wherein we do now mainly differ from them. God send them once the knowledge of his truth, and the light of his gospel to shine upon them which sit in darkness and the shadow of death, that they may not be thrown into utter darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. And thus much I thought good to note, by way of observation upon the first part. Concerning the Corruption of the true Fathers, wherein is the greater danger, because the corruption may spread far and wide, before ever it be espied, I shall desire the christian reader to observe : First; that I take the word \"Fathers\" in a large and liberal sense, extending it as far as n Gregory de Valentia stretcheth it, unto the best learned of all ages. And albeit, there be very few places challenged by me, which are not corrupted in the works of the Fathers of the primitive church: yet I thought good to adjoin unto these some few texts cor- rupted of later and middle-aged writers : as well to manifest the beginning, continuance, and progress of their corruptions throughout all ages ; as also because they were such famous corruptions, as could not well be passed over in silence. The second thing that I would pray you to observe is, that I take not upon me to note all their literal corruptions, which either myself have observed, or others have noted unto me: that were to fill the world with huge volumes, and to deliver the places, not by decades, as now, but by centuries, or chiliads. But so many are noted of each kind, as may serve to inform your understanding in this great mystery of fraud ; and that you may descry the lion of Borne by his paw, and learn to detest all such Romish corruptions. ■ Doctares sunt, quos jam inde a tempore Apostdlorum, variis etatibus Ecclesia tanquam Patres venerata est C ac fidei Magistros. Greg, de Val. Lib. viii. cap. viii. p. 90. XXXvi AN ADVERTISEMENT Thirdly; I have taken my observations from sundry of the best learned Protestants ; amongst whom I must ever re- member, as my most honourable patron, and chief encourager, the ° Eight Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of Winchester: by whose special means, next under God, I may say with the Apostle, for that small knowledge which I have of their sundry foul corruptions, \" I am, that I am. p \" His learned books were my best directors, throughout the whole course of my studies, to draw them unto the study of antiquity : which every man commends, but few study, the more is the pity, in this age, wherein it is requisite, that we beat the Papists, with the forcible weapon of an- tiquity, and drive them out of the strong fort of Fathers and ancient writers, which they have so long time, by violence and injury, held from us. Now although divers learned men have noted these places of corruption ; yet, as you may per- ceive, I have not relied upon their bare authorities, nor pressed the places farther than I saw just cause and good warrant, especially out of the parchments; wherein I have contented myself with one, two, or three manuscripts ; be- cause this labour, if it were prosecuted as it should, would require longer time, and more help, the books being as far distant, that I should use, as Cambridge and Oxford, Oxford and York : But if it shall please God, that the great work of the collation of the Latin Fathers shall go forward, the stay hath been the want of men, and means ; and chiefly, because so great and weighty a business, as this, is not to be undertaken lightly, or unadvisedly, without approbation of those that are in authority, in this kind, ere it be long, there will be good satisfaction given. The fourth and last thing observable, is, that whereas I have noted certain literal corruptions, in the Books of Questions going under St Augustine's name, and the imperfect work upon St Matthew, commonly ascribed unto St Chrysostom, both which are registered in the first q part amongst the bastard works of the Fathers, and so likewise of the rest, and yet the title of this second part is the corruption of the true ; both titles may be well enough reconciled, being diversly • Dr Bilson. p 1 Cor. xv. 10. 4 Tract 147 and 175. TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. XXXVU considered. For if we consider them, as St Augustine's, or St Ghrysostom's books, they are bastard, and counter- feited treatises : but otherwise, they are ancient treatises, and truly written, by learned men, though we know not their ages, and names. And if they had been penned by later men, yet what reason have Papists to alter and change their words at their pleasure? The third part is about their different Edition of their Vulgar Bibles; which contains in it an abridgment of my greater 11 book in Latin; where you may observe in like manner: First; that the differences are, in themselves considered, of no great consequence ; but in regard of the Papists, and prerogative of the Scripture, they are such, that he that adds or takes away ought from them, willingly and wittingly, is guilty unto himself of damnation. For the Scripture, no man doubts, that hath read the book 8 of Deuteronomy, and the Revelation of St John. And for the Papists, let one speak for all, Gregory Gapuchine the inquisitor of Naples, for the rest; he says, it is a general rule amongst them, to burn such bibles as are defective, he might as well have said, or superfluous, in the text ; and if the books be to be burned, he that authorised them shall be in danger of a council at the least ; and by the instance that he gives, Pope Clement's bibles are adjudged to the fire : an audacious part of a poor Capuchin, to censure so great a person as the Pope. Secondly; that the special motives of publishing this trea- tise, were these three: The first, because it is a matter of faith, to appoint what is scripture, and what is not; which, Pope Sixtus taking upon him to determine, sitting in his chair, hath foully erred : So that it appears by this, that their conclusion is false ; \" That the Pope cannot err in matter of faith.\" The second, because the Papists are ready to u oppose, and object still unto us our different translations of the bibles v , r BeUum Papale. * Deut. xii. 22 ; Apoc. xxii. 18. t « Biblia deficientia in textu semper comburo, et facio experimentum tertio cap.

AN ADVERTISEMENT when there may be very good reason gives out of the origi- nals for both readings, little considering their own gross errors, and palpable absurdities, in the setting forth of their two bibles, authorised by two Popes, within two years ; which to reconcile is a matter altogether impossible ; and to endure, likewise intolerable. I understand by our Divines of Douay, that they mean to have a bout with us, for the corrections of the bishops' bible. I would they would be pleased, first, to answer for themselves, and their two Popes; and then let them object what they can against us, for changing and al- tering some few words in the bible, and they shall be answered with reason. Another motive that hath provoked me to the writing of this argument, hath been a pretended answer of James Gretser, unto my Bellum w Papale. It was fit, his reasons should be answered, though his scurrilous jests, and x reproach- ful speeches deserve no better answer than that 7 of Solomon's fool. If it be demanded, why I wrote not in Latin, that he might understand so much, and answer for himself, I would have the world to know, that first, this book is written for the benefit of my countrymen only, being thereunto provoked by the Papists' continual upbraiding of our men* with cor- ruption of scripture, councils, and fathers, in all their writings ; and published at the request of divers persons of both sexes, that understand not Latin : And lastly, occasioned by \" the a author of the grounds of the old religion and the new,\" who wrote against me in the vulgar language; whose book, as much as concerned me, I have answered in my second part, and second place. Secondly, this book shall hereafter, and very shortly come forth in Latin, if it shall be thought meet by them that are in authority, and have the over-sight of books.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. xxxix not very good, each man hath his proper gift of God: let no man upbraid his brother, yet I hope I shall find words enough to express my meaning; and all that I desire, is to be understood. Lastly ; I have used for the most part the old translation of the bible b , which was done many hundred years ago, be- cause it rendereth the vulgar Latin, as then it was, almost word for word. In the fourth part, there is not much to be observed besides the order ; which if it be any where confused, let it be attri- buted unto the variety of the matter, which may sometimes perplex a man, where store is a sore ; copiaque ipsa nocet. That which I intended to show, is, the manifold wrongs done first unto the Fathers of the primitive church, and then unto the noble writers of ages, unto these present times. And first, the injury done unto the Fathers is of divers sorts, by disavowing and disesteeming them in their writings, after a very base and contemptible manner. In this point, to confess and profess by whom I have been holpen, I owe much unto the c Second part of the Apology of the learned dean of Win- chester ; where you may see this matter treated at large : as also in Samuel Huberus' book in his Arrtibellarrninus, Lib. i. cap. 47, and 8 : this point is so clearly proved out of cardinal Bellarmine's works, that it is most absurd for any papist to deny it, and it were far more absurd to defend it. Secondly ; their writings are very much wronged by their Indices Expur- gatorii, and that three manner of ways ; by adding, changing, or taking away words in the text, in the gloss, or in the tables. Thirdly; by their often reprinting, and under colour of re- forming, deforming their works, which is so closely done, by changing and altering the order of the treatises, that few there be that do espy this kind of fraud and imposture. For other writers, inferior unto these in time or goodness, I have shewed their corruptions also, by their Indices of Books to he forbidden or purged; together with the number of them which have come unto our hands; the original nature, use, or abuse rather, of this inquisition, the officers, inquisitors, commissa- [ b The Editor has retained the old translation, as in the original editions, but has inserted the readings of the present authorized version in the mar- gin-] Part II. Lib. n. cap. i. &c. p. 188. x l AN ADVERTISEMENT,^. lies, and public notaries ; and thus much you shall find con- tained in this fourth part. In the latter end whereof is presented unto you a table, or brief of all their Indices of books forbidden, or to be purged in divinity. I have shewed how often, and in how many sundry places they have been purged : yet I doubt not but many authors have slipped the pen ; in this I desire not exactness, but to give you a taste only of that sour fruit, which they have grafted upon other men's stocks. I have cited nothing, as near as I could, without a sufficient author or authority. The books of law, physic, and the arts, as these Indices Expurgatorii are tran- scendents, are omitted, or rather reserved for some other time. For the fifth and last part, all that I desire the christian reader to take notice of, is this only : that I take not upon me to prescribe such rules or remedies unto others as cannot be altered : far be it from me to teach my betters. I write my opinion, which in this, and in all other matters, I do most lowly subject unto their learned censures and cynosures, that are in authority, to whom I owe all obedience in the Lord Jesus ; professing willingness, where I shall be thought to do well, to go onward ; where otherwise, to be most ready to be reformed : doing all things by the direction and commandment of my superiors. AN APPENDIX TO THE READER. Since the printing of this book, there have come two special things unto my knowledge ; whereof I have thought meet to give the reader some advertisement. The first is, of a dangerous practice in Borne. In the Vatican Library, there are certain men maintained only to transcribe Acts of the Councils, or copies of the Fathers' Works. These men, appointed for this business, do, as I am credibly informed, in transcribing books, imitate the letter of the ancient copies, as near as can be expressed. And it is to be feared, that in copying out of books, they do add, and take away, alter and change the words, accord- ing to the pleasure of their lord the Pope. And so these transcripts may, within a few years, by reason of their counterfeiting the ancient hands, be avouched for very old manuscripts; deluding the world with a shew of antiquity. The danger is the greater, because there may be an Index Expurgatorius, for aught that we know, for purging the manuscripts, as well as the printed books. This practice of theirs I heard of some two or three years ago : but I had forgotten of whom ; and therefore did forbear to mention it, till such time as, by God's will, I lighted upon the gentleman again, who was at Borne in the Vatican, and saw it with his eyes, and will testify it upon his oath, if need be. The second is, that the author, so often mentioned by me in this treatise, in these words, The unknown, author of the Grounds of the Old Religion and the New, is now known to be one May, a priest ; a man, to give my adversary J^J^^ his due praise, neither immodest nor unlearned ; but, never- p^^ h theless, foully mistaken in sundry points of his answer to Mr Grashaw's first tome of Romish Forgeries ami Falsi- fications. Which, but that it is another man's task, who W xKi APPENDIX TO THE READER. is able very well to acquit himself, I would have sounded to the bottom. If this small treatise of mine shall ever be so happy as to light into his hands, to whom, indeed, I would have commended it, if I had known whither to have sent it, I would entreat him, before it come forth in Latin, because Possevine is dead, and Gretser understandeth not our vulgar tongue, either ingenuously to acknowledge the truth of what I have written, or modestly, according to his wont, to shew the contrary; avoiding unnecessary speeches, and convitiatory arguments, which do but engender strife. To conclude, Verum amo, et verwn volo mihi did. THE FIRST PART. BASTARDY OF THE FALSE FATHERS. The First Treatise.
