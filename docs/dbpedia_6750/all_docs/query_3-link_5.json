        "text": "In several previous posts (I, II, III) I have been exploring my academic genealogy. At the end of the last post I had two dangling branches in the tree: the first from Philip Franz von Walther (1782-1849), and the second from Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738). In this post I attempt to clean up both of them — though I shall find that the road goes ever onward.\n\nThe academic family tree I have discussed thus far is shown here.\n\nAs I wrote before, Philip Franz von Walther (1782-1849) studied at Universität Landshut with two men: Johann Peter Frank (1745-1821) and Georg Joseph Beer (1763-1821). I discussed Frank earlier, so let us turn to Beer.\n\nGeorg Joseph Beer (1763-1821): Beer earned an M.D. degree in 1786 from Universitat Wein, studying under Joseph Barth. This was the same period during which Mozart lived in Vienna (Le Nozze di Figaro premiered in the city the same year that Beer graduated), and one wonders if he may have heard Mozart perform. A tantalizing possibility! In any case, Beer had a troubled relationship with his supervisor Joseph Barth, and referred to his years of study as his “martyr years”. Alas! Such suffering is all too common! (I myself was happily exempt, I hasten to add.) Beer developed a particular interest in eyes: he opened an ophthalmology clinic and wrote a textbook on the subject. Today, some refer to him as the “father of scientific ophthalmology”.\n\nJoseph Barth (1746-1818): Barth was Maltese by birth, but moved to Vienna and became one of its leading ophthalmologists, even being designated oculist to Emperor Joseph II. He earned his M.D. degree in Vienna in 1772, under the tutelage of Anton von Störck.\n\nAnton von Störck (1731-1803): Störck earned an M.D. in 1757, also in Vienna, where he studied under Gerard van Swieten. He was a distinguished physician who was eventually named personal physician to Empress Marie-Therese. He was also, at various times, director of the General Hospital of Vienna, and rector of the university. In his practice, he championed the use of sub-lethal doses of dangerous substances as treatment, making him a forerunner to the hazardous science of experimental pharmacology.\n\nGerard van Swieten (1700-1772): Swieten was also a physician. He received his M.D. degree in 1725 from Universiteit Leiden, where he studied under Hermann Boerhaave. He later moved to Vienna and founded the Vienna School of Medicine, as well as the Viennese Botanical Gardens. He wrote a book on diseases in the army, and served as personal physician of Empress Marie-Therese. Interestingly, he was sent by her to Moravia to investigate reports of vampires, and on the basis of his report (which I would love to read) she expressly forbade the beheading, impaling, and burning of dead bodies in that territory. For some reason, a genus of mahogany, Swietania, is named for him.\n\nThere is an interesting musical connection in Swieten’s family. His son Gottfried was a music lover, and, my friends, there has never been a better place for a music lover than Vienna in this period. Gottfried made the most of it: he was a friend and collaborator of both Mozart and Haydn, and a patron of C.P.E. Bach and the young Beethoven, who dedicated his first symphony to the younger van Swieten.\n\nIt is a nice coincidence that Walther’s lineage leads to Boerhaave, whose lineage was the second I intended to discuss today. His biography has been given in a previous post. For the time being, we merely note that he obtained an M.D. degree in 1693 from the University of Harderwijk, where his advisor was a man named Burchard de Volder.\n\nBurchard de Volder (1643-1709): Volder was a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in Leiden. He was known as a promoter of the ideas of Robert Boyle, and edited the collected works of Christian Huygens. He established the first physics laboratory in Leiden, and in his own research published studies on the weight of air.\n\nVolder completed two advanced degrees, the first a Ph.D. in 1660 from Universiteit Utrecht, where he studied under Johannes de Bruyn, and the second an M.D. in 1664 from Universiteit Leiden, where he studied under Franciscus Sylvius. Since the first of these branches is the shorter, I will discuss it briefly before returning to take up the second branch.\n\nJohannes de Bruyn (1620-1675): He received his Ph.D. from Universiteit Utrecht in 1644, where his thesis (Disputatio philosophica inauguralis de aestu maris, iure et iustitia, ac crepusculis) defended Rene Descartes’ explanation for the tides. (This, remember, was several decades before Newton treated the tides in his Principia Mathematica. I wonder what Descartes’ views on the question were?) In 1652 he was named professor of physics and mathematics at Utrecht. While there, he continued to defend and teach Cartesian ideas, which had been banned from the curriculum, writing numerous monographs on the subject. Some years later he issued a work entitled Disputatio physica de vaporibus et modo (1655). I have been unable to find more information about his life, other than that his doctoral studies were taken under Daniel Berckringer.\n\nDaniel Berckringer (1598-1667): Berckringer completed his advanced degree, likely a Ph.D., in 1640 at Utrecht. He was then named professor of moral philosophy at the same institution, a position which he held until the end of his life. He wrote a number of monographs, including Institutiones oeconomicae didactico-problematicae (1646) and Disputationis politicae de nobilitate (1654). Late in his life, in 1665, he wrote Ultrajecti, a work on the astrological significance of comets.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to find Berckringer’s academic mentor, so this branch ends, having just encroached on the sixteenth century. Let us return to Volder and follow the second path, through Franciscus Sylvius.\n\nFranciscus de la Boë Sylvius (1614-1672): Sylvius obtained an M.D. in 1637 in Basel under Jacobus Stupaeus and Jean Baptiste van Helmont, where he subsequently became a physician and professor of medicine. He was a vocal defender of William Harvey’s new theory of the circulation of the blood, but his own work focused on the anatomy of the brain. He is also remembered for having promoted medicine based on iatrochemistry, the theory that chemical and physical principles may be applied in medicine.\n\nJacobus Stupaeus: Stupaeus is listed as academic advisor to Sylvius, but little other information is readily available.\n\nSylvius’ second advisor, Jean Baptiste van Helmont, is a fairly major figure, and he himself has a long academic lineage. I will take up his story in a subsequent post. This diagram shows the full lineage I have discussed thus far."
