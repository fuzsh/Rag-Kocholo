        "text": "During the antebellum period from 1780 to 1861, Pittsburgh was seen by freedom seekers as a destination for freedom. The gradual abolition act of 1780 set in motion colonial and new states' initiatives in the North to abolish slavery. Pennsylvania was one of the first states to establish a law pertaining to the status of African Americans held in bondage. By gradually phasing out legal slavery, the Commonwealth hoped that over the coming decades of the 19th century, slavery would be eradicated from Pennsylvania. One condition of the law established indentured servitude for those born after March 1, 1780 to serve for 28 years. Actually, there was very little difference between slavery and indentured servitude on paper or in life. Between 1792 and 1857, Allegheny County recorded a number of emancipations, manumissions, indentures, certificates of freedom, and freedom papers for African Americans who were passing through the region or settling in the area. It was important for African Americans to have a legal document describing their status on file in the courts because of the danger of losing their freedom to slave catchers. The documents help understand the transition from slavery to freedom in Western Pennsylvania and also indicate that Pittsburgh was a destination for freedom.\n\nSlavery had existed in Pennsylvania from its inception as a British colony in 1681. Various ethnic and religious groups such as the Quakers were the first Europeans colonists to abolish and denounce slavery in the colony. But that did not stop slave holding in Pittsburgh. Some of the leading citizens of antebellum Pittsburgh held slaves. Gen. James O'Hara, Conrad Winebiddle, John McKee, Isaac Craig, Gen. John Neville, and a host of wealthy land and property owners held slaves. Slavery was small in Pittsburgh when compared to the plantation economies of the southern states. By 1790, there were 3,737 enslaved in Pennsylvania with 878 recorded in the western counties and 795 statewide by 1810. The gradual abolition act made Pennsylvania a border state with the slave holding southern border of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware important to the abolitionist cause. To its west, Ohio and the Northwest Territory were deemed free of slavery. The first half of the 19th century witnessed a continual battle along the borders between slaveholders and abolitionists as freedom seekers ventured into Pennsylvania and slave catchers followed them. This caused the Pennsylvania legislature to distinguish itself as a free state.\n\nPittsburgh's abolitionists knew and understood the issue of slavery. Both white and African American abolitionists worked for decades to aid freedom seekers and to protest slavery in America. Eventually many would be part of the network of the Underground Railroad. By the 1830s, Pittsburgh had a growing reputation as a fierce, militant abolitionist community. Pittsburghers were founding members of the American Anti-Slavery Society and through the Prince Hall Masons and African Methodist Episcopal Church, had established a commitment to the abolitionist cause. Lewis Woodson, John B. Vashon, Martin Delany, John Peck, George Vashon, Thomas Brown, William Webb, Halson Vashon, Susan Vashon, Francis Brown, and scores more were deeply invested in abolitionism. These people and others helped form a cohesive African American community that not only addressed slavery but other issues and concerns as well.\n\nThe community investment included forming organizations to not only aid the cause of abolition and freedom but also to assist in the cause of education, employment, homelessness, and other humanitarian needs of the newly free and destitute. In the African American community, organizations such as the Moral Reform Society, Philanthropic Society, and the Juvenile Anti-Slavery Society aided the efforts of abolitionists. During the height of abolitionist activities, a vigilance committee stood guard over rescue missions as slaves were brought into Pittsburgh.\n\nOn the front line of the Underground Railroad was the Monongahela House Hotel located at Smithfield and Water Streets along the river. It was built in 1840, became a casualty of the fire of 1845, rebuilt in 1847, and was staffed by African Americans of the vigilance committee including Thomas and Frances Scroggins Brown. The underground network at the hotel worked to free enslaved people as they came into the hotel with their owners. The practice intensified leading up to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. The network was so effective that a southern slave holder who lost his 14-year-old slave girl while staying overnight at the hotel, wrote in several southern newspapers that slave holders should avoid Pittsburgh and the Monongahela Hotel for chance of losing their \"property.\"\n\nLocal and national press aided the abolitionists' cause. Abolitionist and standard newspapers often printed stories about Pittsburgh activities. Newspapers such as the Colored American, North Star, the Pittsburgh Standard Visiter, and The Mystery covered issues of slavery, freedom, and the abolitionist cause. These newspapers are indications that African Americans understood the power of the press in propagating its anti-slavery position and building a collective of supporters for the cause. Counter to the abolitionists sheets was the Pittsburgh Gazette, and the Post newspapers that regularly printed runaway slave reward postings.\n\nAbolitionist John Brown had travelled the eastern part of the U.S. and Ontario, Canada soliciting support for his planned raid on the Federal Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Va. in 1859. Militias were formed throughout many African American communities to protect themselves from reprisal of the fugitive slave law of 1850. Before Lincoln was sworn in as the first Republican Party president in 1861, South Carolina had seceded from the Union and was followed by other southern slave-holding states. When Abraham Lincoln travelled to Washington, D.C. to assume his residence at the White House, he stopped in Pittsburgh for a night at the Monongahela House hotel. Within a few months, the nation was in a Civil War and the call for federal volunteers went out. Pittsburghâs African American militias, the Fort Pitt Cadets, and the Hannibal Guards both volunteered their services to Gen. James Negley. Like many such militias throughout the north, they were rebuffed. It wasn't until 1863 that African American men from Pittsburgh were able to join the Union forces as United States Colored Troops (USCT) or troops of the Massachusetts 54th and 55th regiments.\n\nPittsburgh would contribute hundreds of African American men over the next two years to the Union army and naval forces. African American men on the home front would work to fortify the city against a pending Confederate invasion. In May 1862, after being rebuffed by Negley, Rufus Sibb Jones, the captain of the Fort Pitt Cadets, sent a letter to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton offering the militia to the Union efforts to garrison southern forts. In addition to the Cadets, Jones offered to recruit 200 men from Pittsburgh within 30 days. African American men were ready to fight because they saw the war as a war over slavery and they would fight to end it.\n\nWhen Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into law on Jan. 1, 1863, it gave great jubilation to the masses. It also provided for the establishment of United States Colored Troops (USCT) providing the opportunity for African American men to join the ranks of the Union. The Federals then relied on the existing network of African American abolitionists to help recruit nearly 100,000 men. Pittsburgher Martin R. Delany came back from Canada to serve as a recruiter first for the Massachusetts 54th regiment then for other USCT regiments.\n\nPittsburgh would eventually contribute hundreds of men for the USCT. Alexander Kelly would join the 6th USCT at Camp William Penn and was eventually awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the battle of Chapin's Farm, New Market Heights, Va. in 1864. Rufus Sibb Jones would serve in the 8th USCT as a sergeant major in the Army of Virginia. Paris Burley served in Company B, 32nd USCT. The 32nd regiment served under terrible conditions, fighting both in battles against the Confederacy at Honey Hill and against white officers whose racist attitudes threatened their lives. Many of the 32nd died from disease and medical neglect. Burley was the son of Paris Burley who attended the National Emigration Convention in Cleveland in 1854.\n\nHowever the Emancipation could not prevent the chaos and terror faced by African Americans in the Confederate South. Delany and others loudly denounced the atrocities inflicted on helpless emancipated slaves by white southerners. Between 1863 and 1865, reports of these atrocities prompted civilians like Martin R. Delany to approach Lincoln with solutions to protect the southern freed men. In turn, Lincoln commissioned Delany as a Major in the 104th United States Colored Infantry making him the highest ranking African American field soldier in U.S. military history. Delany would serve through the end of the war and then work for the Freedmen's Bureau until his commission was served.\n\nAfter the war, the work of ratifying the reconstruction amendments to the Constitution was another cause for the network of abolitionists. The National Equal Rights League (NERL) was formed in 1864 and quickly began to work toward the constitutional abolition of slavery. Branches of the NERL were established in various states in the nation. In Pennsylvania, Pittsburghers George Vashon, Rev. John Peck, and B. F. Pulpress of Allegheny City became leaders of the NERL.\n\nCivil War Songs\n\nThe Colored Volunteer\n\n[Your browser does not support the audio element.]\n\nWe Look Like Men of War\n\n[Your browser does not support the audio element.]\n\nSong of the First Arkansas Volunteers â Glory Hallelujah\n\n[Your browser does not support the audio element.]\n\nFree at Lasâ\n\n[Your browser does not support the audio element.]\n\nOver the next five years, the NERL would work to ratify the 13th (1865), 14th (1868), and 15th (1870) amendments to the Constitution. The 13th amendment ended slavery, the 14th allowed for citizenship, and the 15th allowed for male voting. The Pennsylvania State Equal Rights League would petition the legislature to ratify the 14th amendment and grant citizenship rights and suffrage to its black inhabitants. After the 15th amendment was ratified in Pennsylvania in 1869, African American Pittsburghers would hold a parade to commemorate the re-establishing of their suffrage rights that were violated in 1839. The âJubilee of Freedomâ parade was held in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City on April 26, 1870. The route for the parade began at Smithfield Street near the Monongahela House hotel and trekked into the Hill District then back downtown and across the 9th Street Bridge to Allegheny City then back across the Suspension Bridge to Liberty and Wood Streets where the event commenced. In 1873, another parade was held that continued east on Liberty commencing in Friendship Grove where a program and meeting were held. Events like these annual parades to commemorate the freedom of African Americans show that the local community was very much engaged in issues of freedom, civil rights, and citizenship. However much of the gains in the aftermath of the Civil War would come to an end and a renewed struggle would ensue changing the landscape of Black life forever.\n\nFrom the end of the Civil War to the turn of the 20th century, former slaves, freemen, and the descendants of the enslaved would help transform Pittsburgh. During this period, the professional class continued to grow and support the founding of social organizations and institutions. George G. Turfley completed medical school in Ohio and opened a clinic in the Hill District where he would train a new generation of African American doctors. Mary Peck Bond co-founded a home for aged colored women eventually called the Lemington Home. A second generation of African American family-owned businesses cemented their economic and cultural significance in the area. J.R. Pulpress operated the Allegheny City Market fish dealer business started by his grandfather. Cumberland Posey established the Posey Steamboat Company, the Diamond Coal and Coke Company, and other businesses, becoming a philanthropist in the African American community. Despite the presence of Jim Crow laws, de facto segregation, and discrimination, African Americans persevered in Pittsburgh and elsewhere.\n\nAfter the election of Rutherford B. Hayes to the presidency in 1876, his policies to lift the federal occupancy in the South and provide amnesty to former Confederates opened the social and political resurgence of white oppression of millions of African Americans. White terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan roamed the southern countryside threatening and killing any advancement and hope to escape oppression. The court battles over civil rights escalated as southern states moved quickly to apply black codes and segregated laws. First installed were the voting rights violations, then social restrictions, followed by economic repression. As a result, millions of African Americans who could not escape or change the conditions in their society were trapped in a social, political, and economic subculture orchestrated by whites to protect white power and cultural attitudes.\n\nLand ownership, enterprise, and businesses were under attack. Many were forced into sharecropping or slave-like labor teams. As a result, millions fled the South to the North and West searching for a freer society. These migrants contributed to the growth of northern cities like Pittsburgh. From 1900 to 1930, Pittsburgh witnessed an 80% increase in its African American population. They were drawn by the promise of good paying jobs, housing, and social freedoms. What many found was an increasingly segregated society that placed African Americans at the lower point of the economic totem pole. Even in the steel mills and its subsidiary industries, African Americans overwhelmingly received the lowest paid, unskilled, and most dangerous jobs even when they had experience working in mills in the South.\n\nNot all migrants during this period were poor, uneducated, former sharecroppers, or unskilled laborers. Robert L. Vann migrated to Pittsburgh after attending Virginia Union University in Richmond. He was a recipient of the Avery scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and became its first African American graduate of the School of Law. The industrious Cumberland âCapâ Posey, Sr., moved to Western Pennsylvania in 1892. Posey would own the Diamond Coal and Coke Company and become founding president of the Pittsburgh Courier Publishing Company in 1910.\n\nHowever, the discrimination and restrictions of early 20th century Pittsburgh did not deter African Americans from striving to change the oppressive conditions in America. From 1900 to 1920, African Americans in Pittsburgh founded the NAACP branch, Urban League chapter, and the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper to help fight many of the discriminatory conditions and promote civil rights. Leaders in the African American community would fight for better housing for migrants, education, jobs, and against racism. The NAACP launched a nationwide anti-lynching campaign that involved the local NAACP branch as well as the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper. Local activists wore \"stop lynching\" buttons to support the national campaign against lynching. Steel mill workers in Aliquippa and Pittsburgh organized a local chapter of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and brought the international president general, Marcus Garvey, to town. Their efforts to address the black working class were opposed by some in the black and white communities.\n\nJust like the Civil War, hundreds of African American men from Pittsburgh would serve in the U.S. military during World War I. The national debate surrounding the war and African American support was centered on the escalating violence such as lynchings and the denial of civil and constitutional rights nationwide. President Woodrow Wilson welcomed segregation into federal offices and cut African American federal employment opportunities. Following the editorials of W.E. B. Dubois and others who called for African Americans to \"close ranks\" and set aside civil rights and support the war effort, thousands of African American men enlisted or were drafted into the military and served valiantly in Europe. The hope was that after the war, the democracy won would be extended to African Americans. Unfortunately, servicemen had to fight for civil rights while in the military and face white retribution upon their return from war.\n\nThe 351st Heavy Field Artillery Battalion made up mostly of Pittsburghers first protested their conditions at Camp Lee, Petersburg, Va., where white officers explained that they were expected to âdo manual work only with picks, shovels, scrub floors.â The men âwould not be armed, and might be employed one mile from front line trenches.â The men of the 351st wanted to fight and protested these conditions until they were transferred to Camp Meade where some became officers before serving in combat in France in 1918. Upon the return of the 351st to Pittsburgh at the end of the war, Mayor Babcock held a parade from the Hill District to downtown to recognize their bravery in war and democracy. Pittsburgh Lieutenants Donald C. Jefferson, John Carter Robinson, Wilson Primas, and William J. Curtis were officers in the 351st. Despite the parade, African American servicemen across the country were under attack in 1919 and the early 1920s by European immigrants and whites he felt the new aspect of freedom of their expressions were not to be tolerated in America.\n\nOn the frontline of civil rights battles and community advancement was the black church. The increase in population during the first thirty years of the 20th century also meant the increase in black churches. According to Joe Trotter and Jared Day, \"By the late 1920s, African Americans maintained forty-five churches in the Hill District alone.\" Long standing churches such as Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME), John Wesley AME Zion, Grace Memorial Presbyterian, Metropolitan, and Rodman Street Baptist, Allen Chapel AME, and Brown Chapel AME was joined by great migration era churches Ebenezer, Beulah, Central, Jerusalem, Macedonia, and Mt. Ararat Baptist Churches, St. Benedict the Moor Catholic, and Homewood AME Zion that attended to the religious and spiritual needs of congregations but also provided social, cultural, and at times political leadership.\n\nThose racial attitudes that showed defiance toward black advancement continued. Various communities in Pittsburgh would bar African American homeownership. Confining African Americans to a few communities like the Hill District, East Liberty, and sections of Homewood, this type of discrimination, called \"redlining,\" was supported by the real estate industry and federally funded programs. When Robert L. Vann moved to Monticello Street in Homewood in 1924, his new neighbors quickly protested. They became eager to sell their own properties. Vann purchased a few homes on his street and resold them to other African American families. Trotter and Day recalled the Pittsburgh Public Schools not hiring African American teachers between 1881 and 1933. Former Pittsburgh Courier reporter and editor Frank Bolden recalled African American teachers had to leave town to find work because of the racist policies of the public schools. African Americans paid taxes that funded the schools yet were barred from pursuing teaching careers. This type of exploitation undermined African American advancement and handicapped students of color and others. Thousands of African Americans students would become teachers but were not hired to teach in Pittsburgh. It wasn't until 1936 that Pittsburgh Schools had African American teachers. The first of these teachers and administrators worked in Hill District schools.\n\nAfrican American organizing focused on social and political issues of the day as well. Voting rights for women was a main issue for African American women in the early 20th century. Daisy Lampkin was one of the main organizers for women's rights during this period. The Lucy Stone League, the National Association of Colored Women (later the National Council of Negro Women) served as her base of operations. Historian Leslie Patrick commented that Daisy Lampkin \"was active on numerous fronts, both in her adopted Pittsburgh and throughout the nation. Her activism is believed to have begun with hosting a women's rights tea in her home in 1912, which led to her subsequent roles as a suffragist and member of the Negro Women's Equal Franchise Federation, campaigning for women's right to vote.\" Lampkin was a political activist, vice president of the Pittsburgh Courier, and the first field secretary for the NAACP in 1930.\n\nThis meant more eligible voters for office holders but the change was a slow process because African Americans were mostly constituted into two legislative districts, the 1st and the 24th. Homer S. Brown and K. LeRoy Irvis were able to transform the increased African American voter registrations into political office. Brown ascended to the state legislature in 1934 and Allegheny County Judge in 1949. Irvis was elected to the state legislature in 1959. He ascended to Speaker of the House in 1977. Irvis' political power held promise to transform the conditions of African Americans not only locally but statewide. It was during Brown's tenure in the state house that plans by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development were unveiled to change the face of the Hill District and set in motion a displacement of people, places, and resources in the community. This change in infrastructure and community life reverberated throughout greater Pittsburgh.\n\nThe migration also impacted employment opportunities. Pittsburgh's great employer of the 20th century was the steel mills. For African Americans very few worked beyond unskilled labor in the mills. Other occupations recorded the same struggle, as eligible workers continued to be denied access to jobs despite having the qualifications. As a result of increased migration, lack of jobs, inadequate housing, unemployment, and slow income growth, civil and economic rights activists continued to advocate for equal rights for African Americans. The industrial complex to support the war effort during World War II was in dire need of workers. According to historian Laurence Glasco, it took action by the Pittsburgh Courier and local politicians to open the doors for African American war industry workers.\n\nMuch of the activism of the post-war period grew from the activism during the war. Thousands of African American men and women joined the U.S. military from 1941 to 1945 to defend the Allied forces but also to fight for equality at home. This focus was championed by the Pittsburgh Courier that initiated the \"Double V\" campaign in 1942 for victory over the Axis forces and victory at home over racism and discrimination. After the war, returning servicemen and women expected changes in America that would show appreciation for their patriotism. The late 1940s witnessed desegregation in sports and military that fueled the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s. The Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision of 1954 did not change much in Pittsburgh as African American neighborhood schools ran on capacity while white schools ran at lower the 50%. Much like cities across the country, Pittsburgh took decades to address physical desegregation in its schools.\n\nBy the late 1960s, African American frustration with police brutality, unemployment, segregation, and economic discrimination boiled over. In the wake of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, the Hill District suffered eight days of rioting where buildings were set on fire and some stores were looted. Activists such as Jimmy Joe Robinson, Nate Smith, and Byrd Brown were joined by the Urban League, NAACP, and other activists to lead mass demonstrations and marches to address these issues. In Pittsburgh, the civil rights struggle was focused largely on economic discrimination. Construction tradesmen, medical professionals, access to capital, and covenants designed to limit economic mobility were all issues addressed by African Americans. As the city built Three Rivers Stadium and the U.S. Steel Building, African Americans were completely shut out of working on any of these projects. On Aug. 25, 1969, the umbrella group known as the Black Construction Coalition marched across the Manchester Bridge to Three Rivers Stadium in protest. Pittsburgh politicians, police, and construction workers were all defiant against the demonstrations and at times became violent.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the issue of racism in the city police department was confronted by the first African American city council president, Louis Mason, and others. According to Trotter, Mason asserted that police âwere too ingrained with racism to change their ways.â Recognizing the police bias in emergency ambulance service for the Hill District, the Freedom House Ambulance Service was developed in 1968. A partnership with Presbyterian Hospital and funding from the Maurice Falk Fund, the Freedom House Ambulance Service was one of the first emergency medical services in the nation. Public school desegregation did not come easy. African American parents and students both demonstrated in the courts and corridors of their schools for better education, desegregation, and end to racial biases. In 1968, students at Westinghouse High School held a strike to demonstrate against racial policies and attitudes of its administration and sub-standard unequal education. Westinghouse was soon joined by Langley, Perry, Fifth Avenue, and Schenley High Schools.\n\nSimultaneous to the struggle against racism, significant accomplishments were made in all phases of American society. In 1847, the Allegheny County Bar Association denied admittance to George Vashon. Sixty years later, the University of Pittsburgh School of Law welcomed its first African American graduate, Robert L. Vann, and first dean, William M. Carter, Jr., in 2012. Nearby, Duquesne University Law School graduated its first African American, Theron B. Hamilton in 1925, and first dean of the school, Ronald Davenport, in 1970.\n\nDespite the struggles for equal rights as citizens of Pittsburgh, 20th century African Americans continued to develop and expand culturally and socially. Pittsburgh has great a legacy of internationally renowned jazz, opera, and entertaining artists. Its greatest impact was in jazz music. Very few cities around the country can count as many greats in \"America's classical music\" as Pittsburgh. To name but a few: Earl âFatha' Hines, Mary Lou Williams, Billy Strayhorn, Erroll Garner, Roy Eldridge, Billy Eckstine, Henry Mancini, Slide Hampton, Dodo Marmarosa, Ahmad Jamal, Art Blake, Kenny Clarke, Paul Chambers, Maxine Sullivan, Dakota Staton, George Benson, Stanley Turrentine, and Walt Harper all represent a great legacy of jazz. Mary Cardwell Dawson was one of the many music teachers that helped produce some of the jazz greats. She was the founder of the National Negro Opera Company in 1941 before moving operations to Washington, D.C.\n\nSocial organizations played a major role in the African American community as philanthropists and community organizers. In the late 1890s, a number of male and female social groups were formed. In 1897, the Loendi Social and Literary Club was formed by middle class professional men and in 1910, the Frogs social club was formed by sons of the Loendi members. Fraternal organization such as the Prince Hall Masons can trace their beginnings back to the 1840s and they were joined by the Improved Benevolent Protective order of Elks, Odd Fellows, and Knights of Phythias in the early 1900s. The National Association of Colored Women Clubs was founded in 1896. In 1897, the two Pittsburgh clubs that were members of the NACW were the Pittsburgh and Allegheny Francis Ellen Watkins Harper League and the Women's Loyal Union of Pittsburgh. Ionia Smallwood of Allegheny City was part of the leadership in the local contingent of NACW.\n\nMartha Copeland - Wylie Avenue Blues\n\n[Your browser does not support the audio element.]\n\nThe 1960s witnessed the emergence of Black Power groups and cultural nationalists. Black Power was used figuratively and literally, the act and the organization. Many groups expressed the renewed power of black protest while others saw Black Power as a trait. The United Movement for Progress formed in 1967 and was led by activist William \"Bouie\" Hayden. The Democratic Association of Black Brothers, a Black Panther type of organization, appeared in Pittsburgh during the Black Construction Coalition protest in 1969. The United Black Front headed by Clyde Jackson was part of the Black Construction Coalition. Its advocacy for economic rights helped secure up to 1,000 jobs in construction.\n\nBooks\n\nAndrews, Prof. E.A.
