Julian of Norwich: Autobiography and Theology. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1999. Studies in Medieval Mysticism 2. xiv + 197 pp. Bibliography, index. ISSN 1465-5683\n\nWhen Catholic Sister Ritamary Bradley titled her book, Julian's Way: A Practical Commentary on Julian of Norwich, she called attention to the need to not only study, but live, Julian's contemplative life, not only to analyse, but to practice it. On the other hand, Anglican Sister Benedicta Ward proclaimed that Julian was never a nun. Christopher Abbott has bravely sailed into the eye of this storm and written an academic book that overflows narrow boundaries, bringing to it his sharing of Julian's contemplative life, himself knowing both worlds, of the university and of the monastery. He reads Julian in lectio divina and his reading is wide and deep.\n\nMuch Julian scholarship is secondary, scholars quoting scholars, and thus building upon faulty premises. The major fault of most of these studies is the commonly believed ordering of the texts, the Short Text first, the Long Text later, and the Westminster Text ignored. A thorough study of all the Julian of Norwich, Showing of Love, manuscripts and their true ordering, garnered from primary research, is about to be published. Christopher Abbot has mercifully not set about proving the progress from one text to the other, but instead has sought to understand Julian.\n\nOn page 8, Christopher Abbot queries 'xxx' as being 'yowth'. But in the Lynn, Norfolk, Promptorium Parvulorum (Early English Text Society, Extra Series 102, 'Agis sevyn', column 7), we are given the Roman sense of youth as up to fifty, certainly beyond thirty, years of age. In his careful reading of her text he becomes aware that she is speaking of an earlier time and desire, prior to her vision and her writing of the Showing. He parallels her autobiographical strategy to John in his Gospel. He notes parallels also to Catherine of Siena and Birgitta of Sweden 's writings. And he speaks of Benedict's Rule, Guigo II's Scala, Augustine's Confessions, Bernard's On the Song of Songs, Aelred's De Institutione Inclusarum, Catherine of Siena's , on contemplative lectio divina .\n\nEspecially fine is his perception, albeit pretentiously worded, p. 45, 'The mystical coinherence through Christ of the personal and the ecclesiological implies a dissolution of the gap between Julian as differentiated subject of religious experience and the total community of her fellow Christians'. His chapters on Incarnation I. the Lord and the Servant, use Anselm and Augustine, and are especially illuminating on the slade as also the Virgin's womb, as Julian states, and II. The City of God, enclosing Adam/Christ. 'Human nature was/is created in a primary sense for Christ himself so as to be shared with all human beings, the adopted children of the Father and Christ's own brothers and sisters', p. 114, then citing Julian, 'Thus our lady is our moder in whome we are all beclosid and of hir borne in Christ; for that she is moder of our savior is moder of all that shall be savid in our savior', p. 160. He continues by saying, 'much more imporant to Julian than the details of Mary's appearance are \"the wisedam and the trueth of hir soule', for she is 'fulfillid of grace', translating Gabriel's words 'Ave Maria, gratia plena', p. 161. He ends with the womb image, the birthing, the beginning, citing the work of my former colleague, Edward P. Nolan .\n\nThis book is highly recommended for all Julian scholars and lovers.\n\n____________________________\n\nDavid Aers and Lynn Staley. The Powers of the Holy: Religion, Politics and Gender in Late Medieval English Culture. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1996. ISBN 0-271-01542-X. 310 pp. Bibliography, index.\n\nA English Marxist and an American Feminist come together to do Theory upon Wyclif, Piers Plowman, Julian of Norwich and Chaucer. The Powers of the Holy: Religion, Politics and Gender in Late Medieval English Culture is thus an important, and deeply scholarly, book. But excised from it is the Power of the Holy, the reason for being of medieval literature, architecture and art, which then so clearly transcended merely mortal authority that it has now become suppressed everywhere. Today's fashionable academic discourse upon Julian is clearly uncomfortable with theology, and struggles, paradoxically, to win authorized approval through having co-opted Marxism, while obliterating its Gospel, and Feminism, while obliterating its Liberation. Nevertheless, in the final pages of this book all these obtain a shadow victory.\n\nWhat is especially interesting in many of the scholarly books that follow in these review pages, by Baker, Beer, Glasscoe, is their thesis that the Short Text is earlier than the Long Text. Nicholas Watson in two brilliant Speculum articles has argued for the Short Text as later, but still earlier than the Long Text. In Aers and Staley there is uneasiness about the accepted paradigm, but not yet a willingness to shift, this anxiety being particularly noted in the footnote to p. 79, where they take issue with Watson's pushing of the dating of the Long Text into the reign of Henry V. Far better would be for all concerned to returned to what Julian's texts and manuscripts themselves say, that the Long Text was originally finished 20 years after the 1373 Revelation, in 1393; and that the Short Text was originally finished when Julian was still alive, 'yet on live', the manuscript's text giving that year as 1413. That date accords with everything that Watson has demonstrated concerning the anxiety of that period. While the Long Text accords with everything that Watson says about the halcyon confidence of the earlier period about 1393. Had this brilliant pair worked with the other, and historically likely, ordering they could have carefully demonstrated the suppression that takes place, in lieu of 'development', within Julian. And they could have celebrated Julian's courageous St Cecilia-like compliance/countering even of that suppression. The paradox is that it is in countering that censorship against women doing theology that Julian autobiographically enters the foreground of her text as visionary, as censored, as gendered. She is seventy. She will not be silenced. She speaks like Anna in the Temple, like Magdalen in the Garden.\n\nDavid Aers, p. 95, rightly senses Julian's use of Piers Plowman's allegorical mode of thought in her Chapter 51 on the Lord and the Servant. Both texts are seeped in Wyclif's milieu. (Lynn Staley will note the relation to orthodox Thomas Brinton's Sermons 99, 100, pp. 151-152.) He also brilliantly notes how Julian counters other women's feminist use of milk and blood in relation to Christ. Lynn Staley begins her Julian chapter discussing the chronology of the writing of the various layers of the Showings, again with the premise that the Short Text is early. As before, Watson is discussed, pp. 110-112. By p. 126, Staley states correctly that the Long Text is clearly of the fourteenth, rather than the fifteenth, century, in so doing disagreeing with Watson, because its serenity would not be appropriate to the tensions of the Lancastrian period. On pp. 118-120 she falls into the slade of misreading 'soul' as 'soil', excrement. There is only one reading in the Middle English Dictionary of 'soul' in any way connected with filth, where 'foul' was written of a festering wound, but where the 'f' failed to get crossed, leaving it a long-tailed 's'. This accident has given rise to a generation of textual misreading that fall foul of the substance of what Julian wrote. Staley is particularly good on the context of the 'Lord and Servant' Parable. Indeed, throughout, the pairing of their work is always complementary one to the other.\n\nAers and Staley are correct in their dating of the Long Text's composition, Watson, in his of the Short Text. However, the proof of this ordering is given in the publication of the 2001 edition and translation of Julian of Norwich's Showings.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnderson, Wendy Love. <i>The Discernment of Spirits. Assessing Visions and Visionaries in the Late Middle Ages</i>. Series: Spätmittelalter, Humanismus, Reformation/Studies in the Late Middle Ages, Humanism and the Reformation 63. Tübingen, Germany: Mohr Siebeck, 2011. Pp. x, 266. EUR 89.00. ISBN-13: 9783161516641.\n\nReviewed by Debra L. Stoudt Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University dstoudt@vt.edu\n\nThe discernment of spirits is central not only to the experience of the visionary but also to that of the prophet, the reformer, the magician--and occasionally the heretic. Identified by St. Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians (12:10) as a gift of the Holy Spirit, the ability to discern spirits serves as a token of divine favor, one bestowed on a variety of individuals throughout history. These men and women, clerics and laypersons are remarkable not only for the gift they have received but for its unique manifestation in their lives. In her engaging study Wendy Love Anderson traces how prophecies and visions are \"received and understood by the visionaries themselves and by the people around them between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries in Christian Europe\" (2). The examination is an outgrowth of Anderson's 2002 University of Chicago dissertation, the title of which, \"Free Spirits, Presumptuous Women, and False Prophets: The Discernment of Spirits in the Late Middle Ages,\" draws attention to the marginal role in society played by many recipients of the gift. The revised title and the study itself give precedence to the historical context of the experiences and the tradition of commentary that evolved concerning the <i>discretio spirituum</i>.\n\nThe introduction begins with the response of delight by Christina of Markyate around 1115 to a vision of the Virgin Mary alongside the skeptical reaction of Veronica Binasco in the second half of the fifteenth century to a similar experience. What transpired in the intervening centuries? What criteria merged by which true revelations could be distinguished from false ones? What authority did religious and secular powers wield concerning such matters? In the subsequent chapters Anderson undertakes a contextualization of the responses to these queries, linking the responses of succeeding generations to explain the remarkable shift over time.\n\nAnderson proposes the rediscovery of prophecy by European Christians in the twelfth century as the impetus for change. The visionary experiences of Franciscan clerics stimulate debate on the topic in the thirteenth century, and by the fifteenth century it is the visionary experiences of lay women take center stage. The shift attests to the gendering of theological discernment discourse and results in a multifaceted discourse on the <i>discretio spirituum</i> in terms of gender, ecclesiastical status, and the struggle for symbolic power by the early fifteenth century (11). Anderson argues that the question of authority maintains preeminence over that of gender with regard to the gift of discernment (7), but it might be contended as well that the two are inextricably intertwined.\n\nIn a section on the visionary context of discernment (4-8) Anderson references recent literature, including Nancy Caciola's <i>Discerning Spirits: Divine and Demonic Possession in the Middle Ages</i> (2003)\n\nand Dyan Elliott's <i>Proving Woman: Female Spirituality and Inquisitional Culture in the Later Middle Ages</i> (2004). She identifies the scholarly niche her study fills, namely that \"[t]he late medieval discourse on the discernment of spirits was a visionary project (in both senses), a series of reactions to key events in the history of Christianity, and a dynamic conversation across several centuries addressing widely diverse claims to religious authority within late medieval Christendom\" (8).\n\nThe first chapter outlines the biblical and patristic origins of the Christian characterization of the discernment of spirits, with its occasional exhortations to beware of false prophets and claims that the clergy possess the gift <i>ex officio</i>. Augustine's tripartite understanding of visions--corporeal, spiritual, and intellectual--remains an essential concept through the Middle Ages, but the advent of the monastic tradition introduces a difference nuance to <i>discretio spirituum</i>, one that reflects \"communal moderation\" (36). The chapter concludes with the advice of Bernard of Clairvaux on the subject and a brief examination of the reception of the visionary\n\nexperiences of Hildegard of Bingen, Joachim of Fiore and Elisabeth of Schönau at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth century, focusing on the question of whether each is expected to prove her or his prophetic status and how each understands that status.\n\nChapter 2 explores the impact of the new order and the new mysticisms on discernment in the thirteenth century. What proof is needed to confirm an individual's status as prophet and who evaluates that proof become central themes of papal letters and canon law. The diverse opinions within the Franciscan Order are exemplified by the skeptical stance of David of Augsburg toward the trustworthiness of revelations and visions as well as the more defensive posture of Peter of John Olivi. In the course of the fourteenth century Olivi's writings are interpreted by other authors, e.g., Arnald of Villanova and Augustinus of Ancona. Anderson situates the writings of this time in the context of the historical ages set forth by Joachim of Fiore at the close of the twelfth century and the growing instability of the Church that culminated in the Avignon papacy of the fourteenth century.\n\nThe focus of Chapter 3 lies squarely on the writings of a number of Germanic theological figures. Henry of Friemar \"the Elder\" sets forth criteria for the discernment of the spirits in the tradition of the medieval scholastics. However, his critique of the \"philosophers\" in favor of the holy men inspired by grace serves as a precursor to the mystically informed writings of a number of Dominicans, especially Henry Suso and John Tauler. Suso uses the Middle High German <i>underscheit/d</i> to translate Latin <i>discretio</i> as well as <i>distinctio</i> and touts the potential role of visionary experiences in the spiritual guidance he offers. In a similar vein, Tauler provides homiletic advice as to how to distinguish the divine from the diabolic. The Dutch mystical tradition is exemplified by Jan Ruusbroec, who examines discernment as part of the inward life, providing direction for those who might be tempted to spiritual error. Anderson underscores the didactic nature of the writings of these figures and examines the impact of the pronouncements in light of the Free Spirit heresy, which she links to the \"misapplication of reason\" in understanding spiritual teachings (122).\n\nChapter 4 is concerned with three individuals caught up in the historico-religious events of the time: Birgitta of Sweden, Pedro of Aragon, and Catherine of Siena. All are advocates of the return of the papacy to Rome, and their influence is examined in view of their authority as shaped by \"the proper place of revelation within the institutional Church\" (126). In all three cases the experiential relationship with Christ serves a pivotal function. Anderson ascertains a shift to a post-Schism idea of discernment, in which an outside authority is called upon to validate the visionary experience.\n\nChapter 5 explores the role of medieval universities during the years of the Great Western Schism in the debate regarding discernment. Most prominent reformers are university-based theologians eager to participate in church affairs. Drawing on the commentary of previous, they conclude that the right to determine the authenticity of visions and revelations is indeed their prerogative (189). In this regard Anderson examines the influential comments of Pierre d'Ailly on the question of true and false prophecy as well as the doctrine of discernment of Henry of Langenstein, who identifies false prophets as those who lack <i>ratio</i> as well as <i>discretio</i> (175). It is left to the pupil of both men, Jean Gerson, to champion their ideas. The chapter concludes with an excursus on critiques by various scholars of the last century concerning the writings of the above- mentioned theologians and reformers, with a focus on medieval women's spirituality and the gendering of discourse. There have been similar debates regarding the central figures in other chapters, and one may wonder why only in this particular case the topic is explored in depth.\n\nAnderson's argument for a nuanced understanding of Gerson's ideas and their evolution over time provides the context for the first part of Chapter 6. The mature Gerson is convinced that theologians must not\n\nonly be educated, they must also have an \"ineffable encounter with the divine\" in order to provide guidance regarding <i>discretio spirituum</i> (224). He becomes increasingly moralistic as he compares theologians and visionaries and ever more systematic as he establishes authorial hierarchies for discerning spirits. Anderson interprets Gerson's disparaging comments toward visionary women as more of a critique of male confessors and the institutional church than of the females themselves (213). However, at this time the topic of female visionaries is a contentious one--as it has been throughout history-- exemplified by the case of Joan of Arc, whom Gerson defends in <i>Super facto puellae</i>, although his arguments are misrepresented at her trial two years after his death. The concluding pages review the salient points of the study. Anderson also offers a glimpse into the \"Future of Discernment,\" with references to Savonarola as well as Reformation and post-Reformation debates on the subject.\n\nAnderson's presentation of the topic is even-handed, but any study is selective by necessity. Women's spirituality is explored at various points but seldom takes center stage. Although devils are given their due, the topic of witchcraft is avoided. Notably absent from discussion are representatives of the English mystical and theological tradition, aside from the introductory reference to Christina of Markyate. Likewise the voices of female spiritual charges of the German Dominicans of the Rhineland might have been heard or evidence from their writings presented to support (or refute) the efficacy of the spiritual advisors' guidance. Given the introductory chapter summaries (13-16), there may have been the expectation of more extensive commentary regarding certain topics, e.g., the choice of vernacular languages among German and Dutch writers in the thirteenth\n\ncentury. However, these <i>desiderata</i> do not detract from the argument the author sets out to make. Anderson achieves her stated goal: she succeeds in neatly fitting together selected pieces of the history of discernment of spirits to provide a valuable, readable description of the contours of its evolution in the late Middle Ages.\n\n_________________________\n\n<i>Responsiones Vadstenenses: Perspectives on the Birgittine Rule in Two Tracts from Vadstena and Syon Abbey. A Critical Edition with Translation and Introduction</i>. Ed. Elin Andersson. Stockholm: Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis/ Studia Latina Stockholmiensis LV, 2011. Glossary, Index, Bibliography, Abbreviations, 3 b/w Manuscript Plates. vi + 260 pp. SEK 375. ISBN 078-91-86071-59-2\n\nI had earlier reviewed <i>Liber usuum fratrum monasteri Vadstenensis/ The Customary of the Vadstena Brothers: A Critical Edition with an Introduction</i>, edited by Sara Risberg (Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell International, 2003). Both these books are of great usefulness for a study of London's Syon Abbey, for the pair, Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe of Lynn, and for the cross currents of contemplative manuscript compilations between Syon and Vadstena, between England and Sweden..\n\n<i>Responsiones Vadstenenses</i> at first hand documents the resolution of tensions between the Brigittine monasteries of Vadstena in Sweden, founded by Saints Birgitta and Catherine, her daughter, and Syon Abbey in England, desired by Henry IV and founded by HenryV in 1415. The 60 Sisters of each house were intensely cloistered, the 25 Brothers not so much and able to travel from one monastery to another and to Rome. The Abbess, Christ tells Birgitta [<i>Revelaciones</i> X Latin text: Sancta Birgitta, <i>Opera Minora</i> I: <i>Regvla Saluatoris<i/>, ed. Sten Eklund (Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksells, 1975); electronic version: http://www.umilta.net/bk10.html], represents Mary, the Confessor General, Christ. Two Syon brothers, one of them the future Confessor General, Robert Bell, the other, Thomas Steryngton, present their written questions to the Vadstena brothers who respond to them, likewise in writing, keeping copies for their own later use with the <i>Liber usuum</i>, etc. Two years later than these documents, Syon was to absent itself from the 1429 Brgitine General Chapter at Vadstena amicably but in deference to the consecrated women's inability to travel and to participate in the deliberations.\n\nThe Annales school and the work of André Vauchez on canonizations have taught us upstairs/ downstairs history. James Hogg at the University of Salzburg tirelessly and usefully published texts and studies on monasticism, particularly Carthusian, but also Brigittine. Roland Barthes' 1980 <i>Sade, Fourier, Loyola</i>, focussed on human group constructs. <i>Responsiones Vadstenenses</i> is a splendid book, combining textual editing with a window onto international formation taking place through the universality of the Latin language for western Europe. As with <i>Revelaciones</i> V, the book in which Birgitta resolves Magister Mathias theological doubts with questions and answers in her vision while on horseback to the Castle of Vadstena King Magnus granted her for her abbey, this book is in the form of Latin questions and answers, in this case on how best to interpret the Rule Christ gave Birgitta in visions while she and her husband were at the Cistercian monastery of Alvastra, despite the complications that Popes only allowed it as a customary alongside the Augustinian Rule, and at times officially ruled against the Brigittine espousal of the double monastery form. During this international and friendly dialogue between persons who have not met each other, references are made to the libraries which both possess, copies of the Rule and the <i>Revelaciones</i>, comments made on these by Prior Petrus Olavi (<i>Addiciones</i>, often derived from the <i>Extravagantes</i>) and by Bishop Hermit Alphonso of Jaén (<i>Declarationes Dominorum</i>), and even giving descriptions of his magnificently illuminated, now lost, <i>Liber Alfonsi</i> codex, that Vadstena had possessed before the Reformation, as well as to the papal documents, <i>Mare Magnum</i> (1413) and <i>Mare Anglicanum</i> (1425), concerning the Brigittine abbeys and their indulgences. There were later to be the Syon Additions, of which the nuns of Syon Abbey showed me Tudor fragments they discovered in their attic at Totnes, these likewise seeking to return to the charisma of their Mother Foundress Birgitta and her Regula Salvatoris.\n\nThough this is a conversation, an international written Latin dialogue between men, it is carried out on behalf of the women they serve, the Abbess and the nuns of the respective communities of Vadstena in Sweden and Syon in England and consequently it is women-centered, even feminist. It emphasizes the architecture, the womens choir above, the mens beneath, how communion is given to the nuns, to whom they confess, how they profess, how they are buried, all this in relation to the carefully planned Brigittine architecture. A later parallel to such concerns can be seen in American Shaker architecture where women are separate from men but equal if not higher in rank. Conversations are to be held to a minimum, whether within community or with outsiders, and to be opened with 'Benedicite' with the response, 'Dominus', as with Benedictines (important in Julian of Norwich), or with 'Ave Maria'. Both men's and women's communities were bookish, the extensive catalogue of the men's library surviving, though not that of the nuns'; however there was to be no discrimination against an illiterate nun. Vincent Gillespie and Christopher De Hamel have studied the men's library survivals. I have instead been interested in those of the women, finding that the <i>Revelaciones</i>, the <i>Liber Celestis</i>, the <i>Orcherd of Syon</i> and the <i>Myroure of oure Ladye</i> (Early English Text Society O.S. 291, 178, 258, E.S. 19), as well as early Julian of Norwich manuscripts, were treasured and in some cases edited and prepared for publication by the Sisters. While Uppsala University now has Vadstena manuscripts confiscated at the Reformation where Katillus Thorberni and others copied out texts from England: Richard Rolle, Mechtild of Hackeborn, Walter Hilton, Adam Easton, etc (C1, C17, C159, C519 C621, C631).\n\nThe <i>Responsiones Vadstenensis</i>, written dually by the Syon and Vadstena monks is accompanied in the volume by a 'Collacio' on the text, 'Vide, Domine et considera', written by the Abbot of St Albans, John Whethamstead ('Excerpta paucula de prima part Granarii Johannis de Loco Frumenti'), for Syon's first acting Confessor General, Thomas Fishbourne, and presented to Vadstena, likewise commenting on the Brigittine Rule, attacking the corrupting indulgences, but written in such a florid aureate Latin that it conceals more than it reveals of community life. Both works are given in parallel text with translation into English (rather than Swedish), and with textual and explanatory notes, after an excellent introduction. The source manuscripts are Uppsala University Library C74, C363 for the <i>Responsiones</i> and British Library Arundel 11 for the <i>Collacio</i>.\n\nSadly, during the writing of this review I received a letter from the former Abbess of Syon, explaining they are now closed as an Abbey, the three remaining Sisters living quietly elsewhere, their marble gatepost on which a part of St Richard Reynolds quartered body had been placed, given away. Younger branches of Brigittines, nuns and monks, however, continue worldwide.\n\nReviewed by Julia Bolton Holloway\n\nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder\n\nholloway.julia@tiscali.it\n\nDenise Nowakowski Baker. Julian of Norwich's Showings: From Vision to Book. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. ISBN 0-691-03631-4. xi+215 pp. Bibliography, Index.\n\nA young scholar's book, and perhaps the one which most profoundly discusses the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius and other Patristic material upon Julian of Norwich's Showings. Yet its thesis could have benefitted from even greater scholarship, combining its theological study with that of paleography and codicology, questioning its own thesis about the development of 'From Vision to Book'. An investigation of the Amherst, Westminster, Paris, Sloane and Stowe Manuscripts themselves of Julian's text of the Showings, or of their contexts, or of both, seriously undermines the standard assumption of Julian's textual development, of Vision, then Short Text, then Long Text, all of which is the premise of this particular book. Princeton University Press 'spams' the Internet with this book rather annoyingly!\n\nOne hopes Denise Baker will continue to write on Julian of Norwich, deepening her insight through the study of Julian in her medieval context, as well as that of the patristic world.\n\nFrances Beer.

Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1998. The Library of Medieval Women. ISBN 0 85991 453 4. viii + 93 pp. Bibliography and index.\n\nFrances Beer had already edited the Amherst Manuscript Short Text of Julian of Norwich's Showings, from British Library Additional Manuscript 37,790, excellently, publishing that work in 1978, with Carl Winter of Heidelberg. This introduction and translation gives both that text and an excerpt from British Library Sloane 2477 on the Motherhood of God. Throughout, Frances Beer acknowledges the pioneer editing carried out by Sister Anna Maria Reynolds, C.P. She observes that the Short Text is a fine introduction to Julian studies.\n\nLike most modern scholars, though not earlier ones, Frances Beer considers the Short Text early, the Long Text late and the work of Julian's 'greater spiritual maturity'. (Yet she puts the XVI Showings of the Long Text, into the Short Text's 25 chapters, indicating these in square brackets, as if the XVI Showings' structure already existed at the time of the supposed earlier writing.) She adheres to Julian as having participated in Benedictine contexts, which Sister Benedicta Ward, S.L.G., denies. She carefully notes Augustine and Dionysius on mystical experiences as used by Julian. She also discusses the Ancrene Wisse cluster of texts, Richard Rolle, Walter Hilton and the Cloud of Unknowing cluster of texts in relation to Julian. (In this last instance the bracketed citation to 'Johnston' has one hunt in the Bibliography to find 'Johnson' given as translator of The Cloud of Unknowing, the reference being to William Johnston, S.J.; likewise 'Sara McNamer' p. 74, versus 'McNamer, Sarah', p. 86, both of which can be corrected in a subsequent printing. ) She discusses the careful attention given to autobiographical detail characteristic of the Short Text, and elaborately plots out the correspondences between the two versions. But she does not mention or study the second earliest Julian manuscript, that of Westminster , which again is different from the Short or Long Texts, and likewise a fine introduction for students to Julian, concise, yet giving the hazel nut/Nativity/Annunciation scene, God in a circle and as 'I it am' and the entire presentation of Jesus as Mother.\n\nFrancis Beer's translation begins with the head note about Julian being alive in 1413 at the time of the text's writing. She footnotes that statement to say it is not the date of composition but the year in which this copy was made. Yet the Amherst Manuscript begins, in the same hand, with texts dated as written in 1434 and 1435, and which are Richard Misyn's translations of Richard Rolle for the anchoress Margaret Heslyngton. The possibility Julian could have written or dictated this text when she was seventy is not entertained at all. The next footnote is to the 'paintings of crucifixes', noting that Norwich had fine wall paintings, but not discussing Archbishop Arundel's stress upon worshiping painted rood screens in churches as indicative of orthodoxy in this later period. The footnote to St Cecilia could have noted that the Norwich Benedictine, Adam Easton, friend of Birgitta of Sweden and Catherine of Siena, was Cardinal of the Basilica of St Cecilia in Rome, and by 1413, buried near St Cecilia's tomb. It was in this period also that Archbishop Arundel sternly forbade laypeople, especially women, from teaching theology and reading the Bible in the vernacular. In a note Frances Beer discusses Nicholas Watson's arguing for a later date for the Short Text.\n\nThe translation is excellent and a labour of love. As one reads it one is struck again by Julian's brilliance and compassion. A similar note to 'I it am', here translated 'It is I', could have been given on the order of that for 'reparation' as having been 'aseth'. For Julian's 'I it am' transcends gender yet stresses presence, oneness; the modern rendition changing the 'I am' of God into 'it is' thus branching away from Julian's stress upon the Hebrew meaning of God's name.\n\nThis shall be a fine volume to put into students' hands. But could Boydell and Brewer reconsider the cover? It presents four faces taken from different periods and different countries, one an angel, the others of women, as a quatrefoil upon black. Excellent for the Short Text would have been the Crucifixion from the Despenser Retable in Norwich Cathedral. It and Julian's coeval writing belong together.\n\nRitamary Bradley .

In my poverty I am afraid I shamelessly begged Sister Ritamary Bradley for a copy. I here attempt to repay a debt\n\nRitamary Bradley, having given on its cover a painting of a wise woman, book and medicinal jars at hand, begins with the paradox that the practical mystic is the one who is the real mystic, while the one who studies mysticism theoretically remains outside of its hermeneutic circle of meaning.\n\nRitamary Bradley brings to her reading of Julian profound depths of theology and poetry, ancient and contemporary. A subtle, unacknowledged, and splendid agenda is, of course, that in Julian's Way we have a woman writing on a woman writing on God. Because the context of both women, the one in the fourteenth, the other in the twentieth, is that of monasticism, being oned with God, the first as authorial anchoress, the second as professor and nun, this subtle awareness works. It has all the openness and humility of Mary at prayer, and of her Magnificat. Quietly, the title takes over as Julian and Ritamary together live theology, not merely study it, and with their words the reader too is swept up into the circle of Wisdom.\n\nMartin Buber. Ecstatic Confessions: The Heart of Mysticism. Ed. Paul Mendes-Flohr. Trans. Esther Cameron. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1996. The Martin Buber Library. ISBN 0-8156-0422-X. xxxv + 160 pp. Bibliography.\n\nI am asked to review this book for 'Mystic-L: Academic Discussion of Mysticism', and I realize that in that context both this book and I transgress boundaries. In Academicism the first person is expunged as being too emotionally involved to see issues objectively and clearly, and such writing, such study, is condemned as the 'personal heresy'. In my work on medieval pilgrimage poets I have discussed how the presence within the poem of the poet as pilgrim, as with Brunetto Latino, Dante Alighieri, Juan Ruiz, William Langland, Geoffrey Chaucer, Christine de Pizan, creates a sacred paradigm in which what is said in the first person of the poet is mirror-reflected within the soul of the reader of the poem, engendering mystical experiences shared by writer and reader. Similarly, for this ecumenical collection of first person mystical experiences collected and introduced by Martin Buber, the reader finds him/herself gazing into first the kindly eyes of the editor himself, pictured on the paperback cover, then into the souls of the writers whom he bares in this text. This book is a living confession with God and neighbour, of 'I and Thou', across time, space, religion, gender, death itself.\n\nPaul Mendes-Flohr's brilliant introduction tells us that Martin Buber's Ekstatische Konfessionen was first published in an exquisite art volume in 1909. Martin Buber's doctoral dissertation had been on individuation in Nicholas of Cusa and Jakob Böehme, then, following a study of Jewish mysticism, he had also worked in Chinese, Finnish and Welsh literatures, including the Kalevala, the Mabinogion. Martin Buber in general translated his selections himself, Esther Cameron translating these likewise from his German into our English. Martin Buber's own introduction interrupts itself with the story of St Bernard's sermon interrupting itself while it was being preached, to confess in first-person ectasy, '\"When I gazed out, I found it beyond all that was outside me; when I looked in, it was further in than my most inward being. And I recognized that what I had read was true: that we live and move and are in it; but he is blest in whom it lives, who is moved by it.'\"\n\nMartin Buber's Selections from Ecstatic Confessions, which repeat in a myriad ways Bernard's ecstatic confession, begin with Indian mystics, then Sufi, for whom the only example is the woman Rabi'a, Greek, then European monastic mystics, such as Hildegard von Bingen, the Franciscans, Mechtild von Magdebourg, Mechtild von Hackeborn, Gertrud von Helfta, Heinrich Seuse (Suso), Cristina and Margareta Ebner, Adelheid Langmann, a song attributed to John Tauler, entries from the German Sister Books, many of these from the convent of Töss written by Elsbeth Stagel, Suso's friend and supporter, Birgitta of Sweden, Julian of Norwich, Gerlach Peters, Angela of Foligno, Catherine of Siena, Catherine of Genoa, Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi, Teresa de Jesus, Anna Garcias, Armelle Nicolas, Antoinette Bourignon, Jeanne Marie Bouvieres de la Mothe Guyon, Elie Marion, Jakob Boehme, Hans Engelbrecht, Hemme Hayen, Anna Katharina Emmerich, with a Supplement of selections from the Mahabharatam and from Chinese and Jewish mystics, from the Church Fathers as mystics, and from the 'Sister Katrei' ascribed to Meister Eckhart. That the entries may be so heavily overweighted on the distaff side is likely due to women's exclusion from university training, and thus, as with monastic men, being drawn more purely from lectio divina , from contemplative practices. Strangely the volume lacks the major exemplar, Augustine's Confessions. But then so does Dante's Commedia.\n\nThough first published almost a hundred years ago this book is both mint-new and transcends beyond the bounds of time. Unerringly Martin Buber has chosen the best passages both for himself and for us, in a marvellous generosity. Let me select from his selections from Julian of Norwich's Showings:\n\nOur good Lord spoke to me, most blessedly: \"Oh, how I love you!\" as if he had said, \"My dearest, wait and behold your God, who is your maker and your endless joy. Behold your own brother, your Savior . . .\" [X.xxiv.fol. 46v]\n\nBecause of the great, infinite love which God has for all humankind, he makes no distinction in love between the blessed soul of Christ and the lowliest of the souls that are to be saved . . . . We should highly rejoice that God dwells in our soul and still more highly should we rejoice that our soul dwells in God. Our soul is made to be God's dwelling place, and the dwelling place of our soul is God who was never made. [XIV.liv.113]\n\nGod is much closer to us than our own soul, for he is the ground in which our soul stands. [XIV.lvi.118]\n\nOur Lord opened my spiritual eye and showed me my soul in the middle of my heart, and I saw the soul as wide as if it were an infinite world, and as if it were a blessed kingdom. [XVI.lxviii.143v]\n\nRobert H. Calderwood. Julian's Challenge. New York: Vantage Press, 1995. ISBN 0-533-11143-9. 102 pp. Appendices, Bibliographies.\n\nThis book came to me from Stella Maris, from two Anglican Hermits closely associated with Roman Carmelites, in the wilds of Canada.\n\nThe book is written by a male Anglican clergyman who delights in Julian's Wisdom of God as Mother and Wisdom and in her cherishing of the sacredness of the 'person' in relation to the cosmos. He places Julian of Norwich in the context of modern feminist theology and current issues, such as abortion, and he employs strategies similar to Julian's own, presenting arguments 'doubly', giving both what is acceptable and what is challenging, allowing the two sides of the debate full play against each other, while omitting his own determination concerning them, a strategy Julian had needed to employ in her day.\n\nI was concerned to find on page 75 that Rev. Robert H. Calderwood gives the Hebrew for Wisdom as 'Hokinah'. Had he given his printer or typist a manuscript with 'Hokmah ' and not adequately proofread the text? Or is the error his own? I quibble over these jots and tittles, because he is right where he sees that Julian had had 'well-learned cleric tutor', p. 2. Julian's Master and Rabbi was likely the Norwich Benedictine, Oxford Master, and Roman Cardinal Adam Easton, whose Hebrew was better than that of St Jerome, the translator of the Vulgate Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. For the Lady Julian displays a better knowledge of the Hebrew Bible than does the clerical writer of this book. This is not Rev. Robert H. Calderwood's fault so much as it is that of the Church of England, which is the one Lutheran Church that has officially abandoned the study of Hebrew and Greek for priestly ordination.\n\nThe author of this study is right to see that 'shalom' in its sense of wholeness, wellness, peace, is a concept in Julian's vocabulary of ideas. With only a little further study the book's author could have recognized that phrase, 'Shalom' 'All is well', 'And all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well' as from 2 Kings 4. 23, 26, where it is used concerning Elisha and the raising of the dead child of the Shunamite woman, at first with the greatest sarcasm, then the word coming into its true and peaceable meaning.\n\nI had treasured that use by Julian of 'Shalom', for it embodies the grief, then joy, not only of the Shunamite, but of her Syro-Phoenician counterpart, and of the widowed mother of the dead son at Nain, and of Mary's own loss of her cherished son to the Roman soldiery's cruelty in Jerusalem, followed by Easter joy. Then, the other day, at an old Carmelite monastery here, now inhabited by Australian nuns, I looked at the frescoes, realising that one is of Mount Carmel and of Elisha and his raising of the dead child. We know that Julian not only had Benedictine associations but that also Margery visits her straight after talking with a saintly Carmelite in Norwich, William Southfield, who had likely sent Margery on to Julian for counselling and consoling.\n\nThough Rev. Robert H. Calderwood's book is somewhat loose in its structure, and perhaps too careful in not giving an opinion to issues that it raises, it does point to another area in which Julian's wisdom can console: to the parents of dead, even aborted, children, who carry with them a haunting burden of guilt, blame, and sorrow. In this Rev. Calderwood is not unlike his predecessor, the saintly Norwich Carmelite William Southfield, who understood that women are in need of the wise counsel of women.\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing. Ed. Patrick J. Gallacher. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University, 1997. TEAMS: Middle English Texts. ISBN 1-879288-89-3. ix + 132 pages. Introduction, Bibliography, Text with Textual Gloss, Notes, Glossary.\n\nThe Middle English Texts Series is designed for classroom use, making available texts adjacent to the readily available classics by Chaucer, Langland, the Pearl Poet and Malory. The Cloud of Unknowing is already available in an excellent edition by Phyllis Hodgson for the Early English Text Society, Original Series, 218, and thus shelved in most academic libraries. But the present edition has an excellent introduction placing the Middle English text in the context of mystical theological writings, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite , the Victorine, Thomas Gellus and the Carthusian, Hugh of Balma, an up-to-date, though brief, bibliography. Its text, presented without the Middle English manuscripts' thorns, yochs, and italicized contractions, makes for easier reading for the undergraduate student. It is pleasing that the editor chose to bold the chapter headings, which the EETS editor had not done. Medieval manuscript scribes took care to differentiate their scripts by engrossing, bolding or rubricating in this manner.\n\nPhyllis Hodgson consulted all manuscripts but chose as base text one that did not reflect East Anglian/Scandinavian area characteristics. Similarly the three manuscripts Gallacher consulted do not come from those families. The manuscripts of those families tend also to include 'doctrine schewyde of god to seynt Kateryne of seene [Catherine of Siena ]. Of tokynes to knowe vysytacions bodily or goostly vysyons whedyr thei come of god or of the feende'. Neither Hodgson nor Gallacher comment on the probable gender of the recipient of this and its related texts. A lively literature had grown up in the British Isles and elsewhere in which men counseled women how to live the anachoritic or enclosed life. Where they did so to fellow men they wrote in Latin. But to women they wrote generally in the vernacular, referred to both 'men and women' in their examples, and cited scriptural texts concerning women. All this the Cloud Author likewise does in his texts. The Cloud Author is himself shrouded in a cloud of unknowing. But there was a Norwich Benedictine, Adam Easton , who taught at Oxford University, became Cardinal of St Cecilia in Trastevere, defended St Birgitta of Sweden' s canonization on the basis of her visionary writings, the Revelationes, who also knew St Catherine of Siena and the spiritual director to both women, the Bishop Hermit, Alfonso of Jaén, whose text on spiritual discernment was copied out in its own right into Middle English in a Norfolk manuscript, as well as being restated in the Cloud Author's Epistle, and being repeated in Julian of Norwich's Showing.\n\nAdam Easton wrote many works, some extant, others lost. Among those which are lost is a Treatise on the Spiritual Life of Perfection and various other texts in the vernacular. Besides all of which Adam Easton, O.S.B., when preaching to the laity in Norwich and later, owned and intensely used a thirteenth-century manuscript of Pseudo-Dionysius ' Works, now at Cambridge University Library. Its prayer invocation to the Trinity in the Mystic Theology has a most beautiful Gothic T intertwined in green and gold leaf. That invocation the Cloud Author feminized for his recipient, having the Trinity become the Sovereign Goddess Wisdom, where he translated that text in Dionise Hid Diuinite. He had also addressed her in the opening of the Cloud of Unknowing as the Bride of Christ, language frequently used of anchoresses and by Saints Birgitta of Sweden and Catherine of Siena. It is just possible that the Cloud Author and the Cardinal are the same person. It is even just possible that he wrote for a Norwich anchoress who may have once been herself a Benedictine at Carrow. St Julian's was under Carrow's Benedictine Priory, which in turn was under Norwich Cathedral's Benedictine Priory. Again and again reading the texts of Julian of Norwich and of the Cloud Author one comes across the same words, oneing, noughting, sovereign, and the same concepts. Especially these swirl about the feminizing of the Trinity, of God as Mother. Likewise the Prologue to the Cloud is echoed in the Envoi to the Sloane Manuscripts' Showing.\n\nThis review, in a shorter version, is appearing in Arthuriana, which graciously gives permission for its republication.\n\nMembership in the International Arthurian Society-North American Branch, and its Journal, Arthuriana, may be obtained by writing to Professor Joan Grimbert, Department of Modern Languages, Catholic University, Washington, DC 20064.\n\nMarion Glasscoe. English Medieval Mystics: Games of Faith. London: Longman, 1993. xii+359 pp. ISBN 0-582-49517-2. Bibliography, Index.\n\nReviewed originally for Medium Aevum.\n\nThe Virgin at the Annunciation , when told of the Word become Flesh, was often shown as in the act of reading, and as reading Isaiah's contemplative prophecies concerning the Messiah. St Augustine in his Confessions spoke of his conversion wrought through a child's voice, as if in play, telling him to take up a book and read. Marion Glasscoe has written such a playful book about books of contemplation, games of spirituality, for us to take up and read. She studies in turn (and closely studies their texts), fourteenth-century Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton writing for women recluses, the unknown author of the Cloud of Unknowing writing supposedly for a Carthusian novice, and East Anglian Julian and Margery's books of showings of revelations, written for women and men everywhere.\n\nMarion Glasscoe has access to important materials, her University of Exeter having inherited the Syon Abbey library of Brigittine books: Danzig/Gdansk, to which Margery went on pilgrimage, was and is a major Brigittine pilgrimage shrine; St Birgitta's marriage to Christ was the model for Catherine of Siena and for Margery Kempe. This study could have discussed the pattern in which books self-referentially prompt books, engender books, for instance St Birgitta's Revelationes as model for Julian and Margery's Showing and Book.\n\nMarion Glasscoe has written a finely detailed book on the English Mystics, playfully harnessing for her purpose T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets as touchstone and some, but not all, modern critical theory. One can read this book as a scholar, or one can read this book as a contemplative, and, in either category, gain from it a fresh vision of the authors and texts it discusses.\n\nIts extensive and careful use throughout of manuscript texts is of great value (though it omits the Wesminster Cathedral Julian Showing manuscript). The typesetting is sometimes difficult to read. The cover design, with the Virgin at the Annunciation from Thomas Boleyn's alabaster tomb in Wells Cathedral, repeated again on the book's spine, is excellent and well encloses this timely book.\n\nFrom: tmr-l@wmich.edu\n\nHilton, Walter.

ISBN 15804406801.\n\nReviewed, June-Ann Greeley, Sacred Heart University, greeleyj@sacredheart.edu\n\nThe image of Western Europe in the fourteenth century has been properly etched in modern consciousness as a civilization trembling into disarray from the successive shocks to the contemporary ethos. Familiar cultural patterns, social traditions, and essential assumptions about truth and reality, were continuously disturbed throughout the century, and thereupon often transformed with the accretion of change. Certainly all civilizations experience challenges to established norms, and all civilizations respond to such challenges according to different strategies: by rejecting out of hand any changes that might emerge; by adopting certain aspects of some changes while decrying others; and, finally, by fully absorbing such transformations into the existing patterns and parameters of culture. Fourteenth-century Europe, however, witnessed a civilization in such broad disarray that it seemed perched on the very edge of final dissolution. The disquiet was a widespread social and spiritual disorder that reached into every village and city of Western Europe. Although the history of the period may be overly familiar, a few critical events bear repeating.\n\nFrom 1337 until well past the turn of the fifteenth century, the Hundred Years War ravaged the nations of England and France, and caused not only carnage to peoples and places, but gradually corrupted as well the human spirit with despair and cynicism. Within a decade after the inception of the Hundred Years War, the Black Death began its gruesome stalking of Europe, and before it settled into its tentative dormancy by the 1360s, it had consumed nearly a third of the total population of Europe. Moreover, the plague had so savaged the populations of cities and villages that, in many places, a brutal lawlessness and general disregard for order reigned. Such dissolution of accustomed standards and the blatant rejection of traditional figures of authority had impetus from another catastrophic disturbance to the societal structures and religious parameters of the fourteenth century. The spiritual edifice that was Rome was crumbling before the stunned gaze of the faithful. Early in the century, the papacy had suffered the grievous humiliation of the \"Babylonian Captivity\" in the dislocation of the papal court to Avignon. Thereafter, in the latter quarter of the century (in fact, until 1417), western Christendom staggered under the onus of what would be known as \"the Western Schism,\" the implausible horror of the Church enduring the presence of two popes: the lawfully (although, subsequently, for many of the cardinals, regrettably) elected Urban VI and, by 1378, the more compliant, yet finally moot, Clement VII of Avignon. The schism thrust many believers into a spiritual confusion and a hardened distrust of ecclesiastical process that eventually emerged as desperate complaints for reform, as well as open challenges to papal authority, and for some, to the very legitimacy of the papacy. A noxious chill of fear and bafflement crept through and among the peoples of Western Europe in the fourteenth century and addled despair to the soul of a civilization already besieged with too many disturbances.\n\nIn addition to the general discord of the time, England suffered as well from her own particular set of troubles. During the course of the fourteenth century, two anointed monarchs of Great Britain (Edward II, d. 1327, and Richard II, d. 1399) were deposed, imprisoned and murdered; moreover, throughout the century, there were significant episodes of political intrigue and competition, social unrest, and class hostility that troubled the governance of the realm. Smoldering resentment of the imperial rule, notably that of the Commons with the royal courtiers, resulted in louder voices of rebellion against and impeachment of the authority of the throne. Adding a bitter sting to English woes was the persistence of Scotland, under Robert the Bruce and later under his son David, in its bid for independence; throughout the century, Scotland continued to worry England, especially in the villages of her northern border. In 1381, sparked by the final insult of the levying of a poll tax on a population already fueled with angry discontent and unrest, the common people of England erupted into the Peasants' Revolt, propelling a stormy mob of frustrated commons towards London and towards the hapless young King Richard II. However, it was not only in the political arena that the general populace felt betrayal, disconnection, and frustration. Among the faithful in England, there had been a growing discontent with the power and wealth of the clergy and, in 1327, as the monarchy was overthrown, so also were both Bury St. Edmunds and St. Albans abbey the scenes of mob violence and attack. Yet dismay with the church reached far more deeply than the secularized affairs of the clerical hierarchy. A robust movement for ecclesiastical and theological reform took hold of English souls; indeed, the rise of John Wyclif and the Lollards, England's first 'real\" heresy, can be considered a response to the troubling disorder and anarchy and confusion of the times. The fourteenth century in England then, as throughout Europe, was a time of turbulence, awakening, fearsomeness, fearfulness, and possibility. It was in this world in which Walter Hilton lived and wrote.\n\nWalter Hilton, like his European contemporaries Johannes Tauler, Henry Suso, and Catherine of Siena, and his countryfolk Richard Rolle, Julian of Norwich, and the anonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing, responded to the general social unrest and religious dissatisfaction by turning away from the public, ecclesiastical forms of Christianity, and toward the more affective tradition of Christianity, the interior path of the mystic that relies upon personal reflection and private contemplation for spiritual nourishment and enlightenment. While never divorcing themselves officially from the Church and from the essential doctrine of Church teachings--indeed, most remained steadfastly committed to the authority and primacy of Rome--the mystics of the fourteenth century opted for a spirituality as old as Christianity itself, yet roundly discounted by ecclesiastical authorities and influential schoolmen as bending too far from approved church structure and, therefore, from the necessary direction of the ordained clergy. Still, impassioned mystics like Rolle and spiritual directors like Walter Hilton encouraged the validity of personal devotion, and wrote treatises that posited the interior life of the individual believer as an authentic locus of salvation. They insisted that the pedantic intellectualism of the schools were insufficient to sustain the life of the spirit, and must be enriched by a program of humble penance, devout prayer, and loving contemplation of the person and the passion of the Christ. Only through an active participation of the spiritual faculty in Christ, they emphasized, can an individual achieve the full measure of a meaningful existence. Hilton himself wrote that:\n\nJhesu is tresoure hid in thi soule; thanne yif yow fynde\n\nmyght Hym in thi soule, and thi soule in Him, I am siker\n\nfor joie of it thou woldest gyve alle the likynges of alle\n\nertheli thinges for to have it. Jhesu slepeth in thyn\n\nherte gosteli...Doo thou so stire Him bi praiere and waken\n\nHym with criynge of desire,and he schal ryse sone and\n\nhelpe thee. (I, 49, 1437-1442)\n\nAs the Hilton excerpt indicates, the use of the vernacular was fundamental to the intent of the spiritual guidance, for texts written in the contemporary language of the people would be available to a more broadly based and more diverse audience than if they had been written only in the traditional Latin. In fact, by the fourteenth century, it was quite likely that few prelates in England, except those in the highest clerical ranks, and even fewer lay people, with the obvious exception of illustrious scholastics, were thoroughly conversant in Latin. Therefore, in order to facilitate its access by both clerical and lay devotees, a book of spiritual direction such as the Scale would find its widest distribution if it were composed in the language of the people. A treatise that instructs the faithful how best to pray should, reasonably, be in the language in which the faithful will pray.\n\nTo their great credit, Thomas Bestul and the TEAMS committee have provided both students and scholars with an edition of Walter Hilton's Scale of Perfection in its original Middle English, and the distinctions in tone, idiom, meaning, and affect between the many modern English \"translations\" and the authentic ME text are remarkable, to say the least. With the turn of each page, the text and its author, and the fourteenth-century panorama of faith and spiritual practice, come to life as never a modern reading would be able to capture. In addition, Bestul has wisely provided the modern reader with both a linguistic apparatus of modern English, on the bottom of each page, for those words and phrases that are the least accessible or intelligible to the modern idiom, as well as an abbreviated but quite welcome glossary of about 150 of the most frequently cited words. For those readers of Scale who are not scholars of Middle English dialects or medieval English literature, such as scholars of religious history or medieval spirituality, the availability of such critical details will prove invaluable in making use of the TEAMS text. Also for novices to the intricacies of fourteenth-century English Christianity, Bestul has appended to the fourteen page Introduction a five page \"select\" bibliography which affords the student fundamental sources and secondary references for further study of Hilton and his works. The bibliography is serviceable, but somewhat dated, and should not be considered (nor does it claim to be) an exhaustive review of Hiltonian studies; nevertheless, it offers the reader new to Hilton's Scale essential secondary references to Hilton, his works, and the context of medieval English mysticism.\n\nStill, the author of Scale endures as a shadowy figure in the realm of medieval writers. Little can be actually verified about the life of Walter Hilton-- which is, as one suspects, as he preferred. It is generally accepted that by 1375 or so, he was a canon of the Augustinian Priory of Thurgarton in Nottinghamshire; it is also likely that, much prior to his residence at the Priory (where he continued to live until his death in 1395/96), he had been a student of theology at Cambridge. Less verifiable, but not at all unlikely, is the speculation by some scholars that Hilton himself had, at some point, led an eremitical life, a life not dissimilar from the one led by the anchoress whose need for spiritual counsel formed the pretext for the composition of Scale. While there is no proof of that possibility, the text itself does evidence an authentic ease with and clear-sighted understanding of the spiritual life of a solitary, as well as a keen regard for the psychological and physical complications that trouble the isolated pilgrim. Whatever the facts of his life, Hilton's Scale of Perfection is known to have been one of the most popular spiritual texts in late medieval England, as the number of extant manuscripts (about forty-five) demonstrate. It was translated into Latin by about 1400, and it was that Latin version that soon found its way to Europe, particularly among communities of (male and female) Benedictines and their more ascetic brothers, the Carthusians. In England, the original Middle English tract was copied and \"amended\" over successive centuries, with the result that no one manuscript can claim primacy. For the TEAMS volume, Dr. Bestul selected a fifteenth-century manuscript from Lambeth Palace, London, MS 472. This manuscript is, in fact, a collection of works by Hilton, including Eight Chapters on Perfection and Mixed Life, as well as Scale.\n\nBestul notes (8) that the Lambeth manuscript he used is interesting for reasons apart from its contents. MS 472 exists, in fact, as an example of a fifteenth-century \"common profit\" volume, that is, a manuscript incorporating several spiritual writings and works of religious counsel that was commissioned by a lay person (in this case, one 'John Killum, grocer') hoping to enrich his/her life of faith, and the lives of those descendents to whom the original owner later bequeathed the manuscript.\n\nThe textual history of the Scale is complicated not merely by scribal emendation, or geographical and cultural variance. At some later date from the initial publication, Book One of the two-book Scale seems to have undergone a revision, an embellishment of the original text with a more personal Christology, with the result that at least two versions of Book One of the Scale are extant. Some scholars suggest that Hilton himself may have revisited his work, in his later and, possibly, wiser years, and altered the text himself; however, most scholarship rejects that claim and prefers to attribute the apparent changes in language and focus to the deliberations of zealous scribes. Nevertheless, it is indeed a testimony to the fluidity of the treatise, in consonance with the spiritual journey it delineates, that Hilton (purportedly) advised his readership that, \"thise wordes that I write, take hem not to streiteli, but there as thee thenketh bi good avysement that I speke to schorteli...I prey thee mende it there nede is oonli\" (Scale, I, 92). Hilton understood that the spiritual advice he was providing would probably not be effective simply as a fixed manual of instruction, but must be able to evolve continually as the context and culture demanded.\n\nThat Hilton's work today no longer enjoys the popular esteem in which it was held in its own time is due in no small part, it seems, to the proclivity of the modern age to be overly impressed with Richard Rolle's mystical passion or to be absorbed by Julian of Norwich's evocative examination of her vibrant \"showings.\" Walter Hilton's style is one which bespeaks a teacher: deliberate and considered, almost placid in its order and rationale, and generous in its broad applicability, notably to the laity. Written ostensibly to a cloistered anchoress who sought from him guidance in her chosen devotion to the contemplative life, Hilton's Scale of Perfection opens with a tacit recognition of the universal application of its rationale: one must embark upon the interior journey of spiritual perfection because\n\n...a wrecchid man or a woman is he or sche that leveth al\n\nthe inward kepinge of hymself and schapith hym withoute\n\noonli a fourme and likenes of hoolynesse, as in habite and\n\nin speche and in bodili werkes... wenynge hymsilf to be\n\naught whanne he is right nought, and so bigileth hymsilf.\n\nDo thou not so, but turne thyne herte with thy body\n\nprincipali to God, and schape thee withinne to His\n\nlikenesse bi mekenesse and charite and othere goostli\n\nvertues, and thanne art thou truli turned to Hym.\n\n(I,1)\n\nHilton asserts that it is incumbent upon every Christian to \"turn\" heart and body to God; each Christian, he insists, and not just those literally walled from society, enjoys the capacity of that turning (conversio) to God, which is the familiarly medieval paradigm of the ascent to the Divine. The activity of the ascent must be motivated toward the sure condition of authentic contemplation, which Hilton accords three parts aspects: the \"knowing\" of God and spiritual matters through study, instruction, and rational discussion of Scripture, cognition empty of true emotion, \"unsavery and cold\" (I, 4); the pure \"affection\" for God, most apparent among the devout who, though sincere, possess faith without \"undirstondynge of gosteli thynges\" (I, 5), and, thirdly, the contemplation of God that lies in both cognition and affection, \"in knowyng and in perfight lovynge of God\" (I, 8). However, such a contemplative state is, as Hilton says, like a \"mark bifore the sight of thi soule\" (I, 14), resting on a spiritual height that requires preparation for the soul for so lofty a climb. The individual must first work toward an inner transformation, a personal reformation of his/her condition of virtues, for, as Hilton laments:\n\n(t)here is many man that hath vertues, as lowenesse,\n\npacience,...and siche othere, onli in his resoun and wille\n\nand hath no goostli delite ne leve in hem...he doth hem by\n\nstrenghte and stirynge of resoun for drede of God. This\n\nman hath vertues in resoun and in wille, but not the love\n\nof hem in affeccion... (I, 14)\n\nWalter Hilton rightly distinguishes between the life of virtue based on reason and fear, which is, in fact, not true virtue at all and so would impede the journey to God, and the life of virtue based on affection and love, which is essential to aid the questing soul toward contemplation, and its final resting in God. The virtues to which he refers are common enough, although Hilton makes a particular point to emphasize meekness, spiritual patience, and purity of heart. Indeed, it is perhaps a cautionary reminder for the modern age that Hilton singles out \"meekness,\" or humility, as the virtue upon which all others build, and the one to which all other tend.\n\nThis partie of mekenesse thee bihoveth for to have in thi\n\nbigynnynge, and bi this and bi grace schalt thou come to\n\nthe fulhede of it and of alle othere vertues...(a)s mykil\n\nas thu hast of mekenesse, so mykil haste thou of charite,\n\nof pacience, and of othere vertues...(mekenesse) is the\n\nfirst and the laste of alle vertues...(d)oo thou nevere so\n\nmany good dedis,...yif thu have no mekenesse it is nought\n\nthat thou doost. (I,18)\n\nOne cleanses and thereby strengthens the soul through the authentic inculcation of loving virtues, gifts of the Holy Spirit, a continuous process that does include activities commonly associated, but not exclusively, with the cloistered life, particularly study of the sacred w(W)ord (Lectio), meditation (Meditatio), and prayer (Oratio). Hilton centers true spiritual growth on meditatio and oratio especially, the one a thorough appraisal of one's character, faith life, and capacity for change, and the other a formal recognition of being ultimately helpless in the spiritual journey without being \"touchid and lightned of the goostli fier which is God\", which \"lightening\" occurs most at the core of prayer.\n\nBook One of Scale, then, delineates quite carefully the arduous ascent to God by extolling the purification of the soul in stages, and, thereupon, by assessing the spiritual activities of study, meditation, and prayer, that ready the soul for loving contemplation of God. Book II focuses with greater clarity and even urgency upon the human soul as image of God, and the need for reforming one's soul corrupted and lost in sin and debasement. In Book II, Hilton acknowledges with the conviction of experience that such spiritual reform cannot be achieved by humanity itself, but must rely upon the abiding presence of Jesus Christ to affect change: \"...for I wot wel that oure Lord Jhesu bringeth al this to the ende...(f)or He dooth al; He formeth and he reformeth. He formeth oonli bi Hymsilf, but He reformeth us with us...\" (II, 28). The soul restored to its original condition of light in all its simplicity and love is then able to contemplate by means of grace the Love that is God/Christ, and so abide perfectly in eternal peace and joy.\n\nDr. Bestul and the TEAMS committee have done well in editing for popular use this text of Walter Hilton's Scale of Perfection, and students as well as scholars of medieval spirituality, medieval history, medieval English literature, western spirituality, and English religious history, will discover in this volume an accessible edition of the unjustly neglected Scale, a forgotten gem among the jewels of mystical writings from the Middle Ages.\n\nJulia Bolton Holloway.

Swan University of Northern Iowa jesse.swan@uni.edu\n\nA festschrift, by definition, celebrates and honors a scholar of immense noteworthiness by publishing, ideally, exceptional\n\nessays by equally exceptional intellectuals on topics or methods drawing on those of the honoree. Impressively,\n\nRosemary Horrox and Sarah Rees Jones have accomplished this with their volume for Barrie Dobson, Pragmatic Utopias.\n\nAs a practice of interpretation, historical criticism is a matter of reading. What is read and how one reads usually\n\ndistinguishes historians, and it is one of this volume's best qualities to provide an ample complement of readings.\n\nAccordingly, the volume presents essays that deal with non-literary documents -- by far the bulk of the collection-- as\n\nwell as some that treat literary texts. Such a division between literary and non-literary texts is not the editors'--\n\nthey organize the essays chronologically according to subject matter-- but it highlights many important issues the book\n\nengages, including the modern disciplinary division that the honoree variously contributed to and sought to cross, the\n\ndifferent sorts of conclusions usually drawn from various forms and genres, the value of crossing disciplines by thinking of\n\nindividual texts in terms usually applied to other documents, and, perhaps most suggestively, the possibilities available to\n\nthose who can advance from crossing disciplinary manners of reading into transcending them.\n\nSome essays express overtly an anxiety over crossing lines, such as when, in attempting to resolve the apparent \"historical\n\nparadox\" of the decision of Hugh of Balsham, Bishop of Ely, to found a college \"not for his monastic brethren, but for secular\n\nclerks,\" despite his order's concern \"to provide a university education for its most promising young monks\" (60), Roger\n\nLovatt denigrates the evidence of \"tone and language\" in favor of \"precise injunctions\" (77), a methodological gesture that\n\nremoves him from paradox and places him in singular, if qualified, conclusions, such as, \"We can only say with\n\nreasonable certainty that he founded in Cambridge an independent college-- its independence perhaps forced upon him\n\nagainst his better judgment-- for poor, secular scholars who were to follow as appropriate the rule of Merton\" (77).\n\nSimilarly pursuing \"continuity and singleness\" (175), Peter Biller's \"Fat Christian and Old Peter: ideals and compromises\n\namong the medieval Waldensians\" deals with, in order implicitly to reject, the records that remain-- they are only \"the views\n\nof the extremists, the polemicists and the dreamers\" (184)-- so as to propose a vision of most Waldensians as compromising\n\ntheir ideals in order to continue as an order. Biller writes that the \"frustration is that there is only silence from men of\n\nprobably middling views, such as Fat Christian and Old Peter\" (184), by which he means there is no document purporting to\n\nreport first-hand the views of these two dissenters, who are referred to by others in the inquisitorial records.\n\nOther essays draw on various non-literary records in an effort to re-appreciate experiences of groups of people or people's\n\nexperiences of certain late medieval and early modern institutions. Janet Burton, in \"The 'Chariot of Aminadab' and\n\nthe Yorkshire priory of Swine,\" shows how, in \"acting under acute financial pressures,\" \"the way in which [the prioress and\n\nnuns of Swine] responded somewhat redresses the picture of medieval religious women as unable to act for themselves\" (38).\n\nBurton accomplishes this by suggesting that the \"evidence from wine does not suggest that the canons were there in order to\n\noccupy positions of authority, but rather to provide spiritual succour and literacy\" (37). Also taking finances to be of\n\nprime, real importance in defining significance, rather than spiritual or academic \"ideals,\" Malcolm G. Underwood's \"A cruel\n\nnecessity? Christ's and St John's, two Cambridge refoundations\" and R. N. Swanson's \"Godliness and good learning: ideals and\n\nimagination in medieval university and college foundations\" compare the foundations to modern business and suggest how the\n\nstatutes for the universities are not prescriptions as much as safeguards against economic difficulties. Also addressing a\n\nperceived problem with previous readings of records, but addressing the issue of popular relations with the nascent\n\njudiciary, Anthony Musson, in \"Social exclusivity or justice for all? Access to justice in fourteenth-century England,\"\n\nfinds that the poor had much more \"access\" to \"justice\" than many have assumed to be the case: \"Indeed, far from bringing\n\nalienation from the king's courts, the widening scope of royal justice observable over the course of the thirteenth and\n\nfourteenth centuries (in terms of opportunities for redress and in the range of legal remedies available) not only provided\n\ngreater access at the local level, but also catered for the litigious tendencies of at least some sections of the peasant\n\nand urban communities\" (137). More broadly, and taking an ideal from Thomas More's Utopia, Claire Cross traces and\n\nposes some explanations for the correlation between the reduction of ordinands and the rise in their formal educational\n\ncredentials in \"Realising a utopian dream: the transformation of the clergy in the diocese of York, 1500-1630.\"\n\nTwo essays treat documents commonly associated with historians, but they do so in a sensitive, literary manner. In a\n\nremarkable essay that should draw many readers to the volume, P. J. P. Goldberg carefully attends to the wording and\n\nstructure of a set of ordinances of the city of Coventry for 1492 and revised in 1495 in context of the attendance records\n\nof the leet court, \"the medieval imagination\" (105), and the politics of \"Lollardy,\" understood as \"a particular set of\n\nvalues rather than a specific creed\" (103). By this method, Goldberg is able to make several astute observations, such as,\n\n\"The economic imperative of depression and a scarcity of employment is thus seen not as the cause of vagrancy, but\n\nrather as a consequence. In a godly city where all who are able labour honestly, prosperity will follow\" (110), and,\n\nthrough them, to justify the contention that the ordinances together form a \"programme\" that \"represents a radical reform\n\nmanifesto associated with one particular faction characterized by marked Lollard sympathies. The ordinance directed at single\n\nwomen was thus a key plank in a utopian vision of a godly and ordered society in which all knew their place and all worked to\n\nthe common good\" (97). Patrick Collinson matches Goldberg's sensitivity in a short essay on a sermon, A caveat for\n\nclothiers, by Thomas Carew of Bildeston, entitled \"Puritanism and the poor.\" It was, Collinson discloses, Carew\n\nwho \"first drew me to the subject of Puritanism and poverty . . . [when he] plucked my sleeve as I browsed in the Huntington\n\nLibrary in California with his Certyane godly and necessarie sermons, published in 1603\" (242). In the essay,\n\nColllinson defines terms, such as \"Puritanism\" and \"the poor,\" and justifies speaking \"anachronistically\" of Carew's\n\n\"christian socialist agenda\" (249). Carew, it seems, was up to something other than, or at least in addition to, castigating\n\nthe rich and relieving the poor of his town, Bildeston, with his sermon's deployment of facts and figures, which is the\n\nfeature of the sermon most uncannily Victorian and thereby inspires Collinson's supposed anachronisms, since the \"evidence\n\nof wills and inventories suggests that the town was by no means as polarised as Carew's sermon alleged\" (252).\n\nWith similar literary sensitivity, two essays concentrate on literary texts in historical contexts. Explaining some\n\nfeatures of More's Utopia, such as the thematic issue of governing a society in which most people do not have property,\n\nSarah Rees Jones, in \"Thomas More's 'Utopia' and medieval London,\" indicates how, in its negative-positive\n\njuxtapositions, Utopia imitates, even parodies, the language of London written customs. Through this appreciation\n\nof the language of the work and the language of London culture, Jones is able to show how some of the ideals of Utopia\n\nreflect London's pre-humanist civic writers: \"More's vision of a utopian 'future' was built upon foundations drawn from\n\nLondon's idealised past\" (130). With similar adeptness, but with a broader view, Derek Pearsall's \"'If heaven be on this\n\nearth, it is in cloister or in school': the monastic ideal in later medieval English literature\" explores William Langland,\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, and John Lydgate in terms of how the monastic ideals expressed in their work result from an incipient and\n\nthen an advanced decline of such possibilities.\n\nWhile all the essays take varying degrees of cognizance of literary and non-literary texts, and while most of the essays\n\nconcentrate on one or the other type for interpretative, rhetorical, and, perhaps, disciplinary purposes, three essays\n\nseem most adept on drawing on both literary and non-literary texts in ways mutually illuminating, deferential, and\n\nennobling. Drawing on 15th-century ballads and legal records, A. J. Pollard's \"Idealising criminality: Robin Hood in the\n\nfifteenth century\" indicates how Robin Hood as \"a forester turned poacher and highwayman\" (167) was \"paradoxically . . .\n\nboth a thing of the past and of the future\" (168), while Miri Rubin's \"An English Anchorite: the making, unmaking and\n\nremaking of Christine Carpenter\" draws on film and archival records to illustrate how different forms of historical\n\nknowledge of women's lives are effected through different means: \"For these, and more, links with the past we must be\n\ngrateful to thoughtful film-makers such as Chris Newby. Scholars such as Barrie Dobson will make it possible for us to\n\nknow enough, from the strong testimonies of archival sources, to be able to contextualize and correct; but to view, and thus\n\nsense, the loneliness of the night spent in an anchorhold is an experience which even the most professional of medieval\n\nhistorians cannot, should not, do without\" (217). Margaret Aston's \"Imageless devotion: what kind of an ideal?\" draws on\n\nmany texts, among them St. Bernard's Sermon on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Peter Smart's Short Treatise of\n\nAtlases, and the poetry of John Donne, to suggest how \"the task of reforming mental imagery\" (195) was accomplished during\n\nand after the Reformation's destruction of physical images. Aston's dexterity and perspicacity yields much, including the\n\nrealization that, for the Re-forming religious visionary, \"The ideal was a kind of white blankness, an openness to the divine\n\nessence untrammelled by physical form\" (198).\n\nDrawing on nineteenth-century literature to read a set of fifteenth-century almshouse statutes, Colin Richmond, in\n\n\"Victorian values in fifteenth-century England: the Ewelme almshouse statutes,\" writes the most progressively postmodern\n\nessay of the collection. While some readers might find the essay's structure mechanical and the sections' sentences\n\ninelegant, and while these readers might feel that their patience is left unrewarded by recognizable explanations, other\n\nreaders no doubt will appreciate the participation elicited and the possibilities opened by the same features. Richmond shows,\n\nby comparing the Ewelme and Heytesbury statutes, that the former are quite unusual, and then suggests, by an adroit\n\ncomparison, that the principal founder of the almshouse, Alice Chaucer, \"seems more like the wife of a Victorian industrialist\n\nthan the widow of three husbands who had fought in the Hundred Years War\" (236). Through his essay's sections, Richmond is\n\nable to see the designated beneficiaries in a different, critical historiographical light, namely, that the \"Ewelme bedesmen\" were, the\n\nproto-Victorian arrangement suggests, \"the new secular workhorses of prayer, employees of a hard but fair task mistress who was\n\nadamant she would have her twopenny worth and for whom the moral probity of her workers was essential to the success of a quasi-\n\ncommercial, quasi-industrial, quasi-religious enterprise\" (237). Also, and quite illuminatingly, the last section of the essay, entitled\n\n\"Memorials and Modernity,\" offers a brief, pre-modern ejaculation of sorts on the problems of modern historiography, problems that\n\nocclude many forms of historical knowledge, especially those \"connected to eternity,\" something modern historiography and \"Round-\n\nthe-Clock Capitalism has no time for\" (237). Richmond's views require an astute, talented, literary capacity to perceive and indite,\n\njust as they evoke such qualities in his readers. This essay surely will be variously the most valued and the most detested of the\n\ncollection, according to individual readings.\n\nSuch is the rich collection, complemented by a warm appreciation by John Taylor and a handy \"Bibliography of Barrie\n\nDobson's published works.\" The editors are to be commended for many things, not least of which is their success in securing\n\nessays by talented scholars and devising a broad, diverse collection reflecting the interest and humanity of the honoree.\n\nWe are all fortunate to have the honoree and his contributions to scholarship, just as we are all fortunate to have this\n\ncollection inspired by him.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDeeana Copeland Klepper. The Insight of Unbelievers: Nicholas of Lyra and Christian Reading of Jewish Text in the Later Middle Ages. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007. Jewish Culture and Contexts, ed. David B. Ruderman. Appendix: Manuscripts Consulted Containing Nicholas of Lyras Quaestio de adventu Christi, pp. 135-142, Notes, pp. 143-196, Bibliography, pp. 197-216, Index. Illustrations. viii + 225 pp. ISBN: 978-0-8122-3991-1.\n\nThis is a timely book, given the increasing awareness of Nicholas of Lyras presence as Hebraist in western medieval Christian theology. Deeana Copeland Klepper works closely with his texts, limiting these to his Hebraic materials, largely derived from RASHI (Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, d. 1105), whom Nicholas of Lyra quarries for his Postilla litteralis super Bibliam (completed, 1332) and his Postilla moralis super Bibliam (completed, 1339), a lifework that was to be profusely propagated from the University of Paris throughout the Latin Christian world.\n\nThe book is especially illuminating in noting the Hebrew attributes of God, Power, Wisdom and Love, or Power, Wisdom and Goodness, p. 93. These attributes are used by Dante Alighieri on Hell Gate, by Marguerite Porete, by Julian of Norwich, and by Victorine theologians who were exposed to Hebrew learning, but very rarely by the standard Church Fathers, Aquinas explaining that it is paradoxically heretical to so divide the Unity/Trinity of God.\n\nThe book is excellent, given its narrowed focus. But there are omissions. While noting several times that two persons were burned in the Place de Grève on the same day in 1310, a lapsed Jew and the beguine theologian Marguerite Porete, an event likely witnessed by Nicholas of Lyra, and who had certainly participated in Marguerite Poretes trial, Kleppers book does not discuss Nicholas of Lyras very influential misogyny. Nor does she mention the earlier funding and collaboration by Paula and Eustochium in the translation of Jeromes Vulgate. Instead, she discusses a student in an illumination of Nicholas of Lyra teaching in Paris as being a woman, though this is hardly likely, the figure being more likely of a male adolescent. Freidrich Heer, The Medieval World: Europe 1100-1350, trans. J. Sondheimer (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 1961), sees a clear relationship between women and Jews in the Middle Ages, a relationship which certainly needs exploration in Nicholas of Lyra studies.\n\nThe section on Nicholas of Lyras students is skimpy, mentioning merely as an example the young Catalan Franciscan Poncio Carbonell and the consequent proliferating of Nicholas of Lyras texts in that land, pp. 118-119. Another student had been the Swedish Magister Mathias who, on returning to his homeland, powerfully translated the Bible from Hebrew into Swedish for Birgitta of Sweden, commenting on the Apocalypse, and encouraging her writing similar apocalyptic visions. For her 1391 canonization (she had died in 1373, following her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where she visited the site where Jerome, Paula and Eustochium had translated the Vulgate from Hebrew into Latin), Adam Easton wrote her Defensorium, while quarrying from and countering Nicholas of Lyras misogynist attack on Marguerite Porete in his dialectic. The Norwich Benedictine Adam Easton in turn had been a great Hebraist, teaching Hebrew at Oxford, and translating all the Bible from Hebrew into Latin, John Bale tells us. Instead of being under RASHIs influence, likewise that of RAMBAM, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon or Maimonides (d. 1204), Easton had used the teachings of RADAK (Rabbi David Kimhi, d. 1235), who saw Hebrew philology and theology as intricately interwoven, and who wrote of God as both feminine and masculine, as mother as well as father. Adam Easton is associated strongly with the circle about Birgitta of Sweden, Catherine of Siena and Julian of Norwich and seems to be responsible for the presence of the manuscript (anonymously so) in Middle English of Marguerite Porete in the latters hands in the British Library Amherst Manuscript. It could therefore be profitable for Deeana Copeland Klepper to investigate the proliferation of Nicholas of Lyra manuscripts by way of Master Mathias in Sweden and elsewhere in a later volume.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent book, opening important avenues in medieval studies, as had been the case with its subject, Nicholas of Lyra.\n\nM. Diane F. Krantz. The Life and Text of Julian of Norwich: The Poetics of Enclosure. New York: Peter Lang, 1997.\n\nDiane Krantz came to my lecture on editing the Westminster Manuscript in the context of Brigittine Syon Abbey, given at Berkeley, 19 April 1993. She was then writing her thesis which became this book, and we shared our stories, I then a veiled Anglican nun, she a former Catholic one. She had been let go with a thousand dollars, I was to be let go with zilch. Not quite, I was given £100 by my Mother Superior with which to buy a new wardrobe, my Sisters having already given away my secular clothes, including my beloved cloak, to their cook, but Sister Anna Maria Reynolds, CP, had just come to stay and was being expected to pay, so I gave her that £100 and have never regretted the gift.\n\nDiane's book is good and worth reading. These are its errors. It accepts the erroneous material in print about the manuscripts of Julian's Showing of Love, not knowing from Sister Anna Maria Reynolds, its first and best editor, and from A.I. Doyle, England's best paleographer, that Paris is an Elizabethan manuscript with Flemish watermarks, thus likely produced by Syon Abbey nuns in exile, nor that the second Sloane manuscript, according to its watermarks, and so ascertained by the British Library, predates the first Sloane manuscript. So she speaks of the Long Text as existing in Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century manuscripts. These errors are not Diane's faults, but those of publishing 'scholars' who did not do their homework in paleography and codicology, in particular Eric Colledge, misleading a further generation of Julian scholars, such as Alexandra Barrett and Hugh Kempster. Nor did Diane Krantz realize that Edward Peter Nolan's Cry Out and Write: Feminine Poetics of Revelation published my transcription of the Westminster Manuscript and that he, in prescience, foresaw Diane's perceptions of birthing and womb imagery in Julian.\n\nDiane ably studies Julian's text philologically. She falls into the slade many other Julian scholars do, believing that Julian writes of natural functions when the word in the Middle English Dictionary is a mistake, taking 'foul', of an infected and festering wound, and believing this to be 'soul' (from an uncrossed long-tailed s) as meaning the products of elimination, when in actual fact Julian is talking of the spiritual soul as enclosed and stored up during one's lifetime in one's physical body, as 'in a purse full fair', then released at death into God's enclosing. That concept is mirrored in Julian's words to Margery on the body as the temple of the Spirit. Diane is exceptionally good on Julian's imagery of 'enclosing'.\n\nWhere Diane speaks of Julian's womb imagery, she, like Edward Nolan, are the exact contrary of Hugh Kempster, who in his essay on 'A Question of Audience: The Westminster Text and Fifteenth-Century Reception of Julian of Norwich', published in Sandra J. McEntire, Julian of Norwich: A Book of Essays, and in his edition in Mystics Quarterly, argues that the Westminster Manuscript's opening of Mary as pregnant with Christ, stressing the 'wisdom and truth of her soul', is unworthy of Julian's physical and virile Christology and therefore must be the work of a male editor of that text. Yet, as Diane shows (and as I also had in my 1995 Lambeth Thesis ), this imagery is deeply embedded and enclosed in all versions of Julian's text, Westminster, Paris, Sloane and Amherst.\n\nDiane carefully studies the theological background to Julian, noting the influence of Aristotle, where women do not contribute to the child and lack souls, though earlier Galen had prevailed on sexual equality in engendering. But she does not note the Friends of God nor their predecessors, apart from Hildegard of Bingen. She could have found Julian's imagery of 'flowing from the Godhead' in Mechtild of Magdebourg, the imagery of the creature paradoxically pregnant with the Creator in Marguerite Porete, and the imagery of God within us, we within God, as wombs within wombs, in Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler, influenced as they were by these women writers and all of them by the Gospel.\n\nAs I read Diane's words, I recall my Anglican spiritual director, a Community of the Resurrection monk, recalling the Piero della Francesca fresco above his dead mother's tomb, of pregnant Mary, the Madonna del Parto. Significantly this great painter has for surname not that of his father, but of his mother.\n\nAndrew Lee. The Most Ungrateful Englishman: The Life and Times of Adam Easton. Gloucestershire: Andrew Lee, 2006.\n\nThis is a splendid book about a forgotten but magnificent Englishman. It is self-published. It has problems. There is only one reference in it to Julian of Norwich. It ignores the Westminster Abbey 5664* document in which Adam Easton is already Cardinal of St Cecilia by the date of 27 June 1383. It only knows of four surviving manuscript books owned by Adam Easton, O.S.B. It does not mention the typical use of dialogue preceding the Defensorium Ecclesiastice Potestatis, including the Dialogarum of Gregory the Great on St Benedict or that by Petrus Alfonsi in which the Jewish convert to Christianity has his Jewish self, Moyse, dialogue with his new Christian self, Petrus. It has Queen Margaret, not King Magnus, be Birgitta of Sweden's monarch. Queen Margaret is later and effects Birgitta's canonization. It does not know that Birgitta's body had already been returned to Vadstena soon after her death, while being correct concerning the exchanging of holy relics, of body parts. It does not believe Easton returned to Norwich following his imprisonment by Urban VI, despite the usual bills paid by various persons for the transport of his books, as had been the case earlier in his journeys between Oxford and Norwich. It fails to consult Leslie John MacFarlane's 1955 University of London thesis which includes the Cardinal's Will, naming members of his household. It would have been preferable in the book to have used contemporary images of Urban VI, Edward III and Richard II, rather than later engravings of them. The book does not realize that the admittedly fine tomb was not built at the Cardinal's death but later, likely at the time of the 1414-1418 Council of Constance, the sculptor being one Paolo Romano or Paolo Salvati, the tomb possibly ordered by the Bishop of Hereford.\n\nDespite these minor drawbacks it is a most important book for breaking through a barrier of silence about the Benedictine monk of Norwich who became Cardinal of England, Adam Easton, O.S.B., and who was likely Julian of Norwich's spiritual director, having known both Birgitta of Sweden and Catherine of Siena. I learned much from this book, particularly the greater details concerning Adam's Easton's imprisonment and torture by his Pope, and about the design of the tomb before its changed position in St Cecilia in Trastevere as having had a canopy upon great twisted columns. Comparing this tomb with that of Edward, the Black Prince, in Canterbury Cathedral is particularly helpful. I especially applaud Andrew Lee's admiring study of Adam Easton's tolerance towards women and Jews. After researching the documents in the case, Andrew Lee then travelled to all the places where Adam lived and worked and his colour plates of these are excellent. I recommend also his website: http://www.adameaston.info, which is indeed full of information about Adam Easton and which evidences ongoing corrections and care with his materials, in particular supplying the necessary documentation in Latin and in English translation. A book, and its errors, is an artifact frozen in time; a website is far more flexible and wikifiable. I thank Andrew Lee for doing Adam Easton justice. Both men deserve praise.\n\nC. S. Lewis: Memories and Reflections by John Lawlor (Spence Publishing, $22.96, hardcover, 132 pp.) While this book is not \"nearly as valuable as one by Lewis himself\" (Walter Hooper, Forward), it is an entertaining and well-written work by Professor Lawlor, a former student of both Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nReviewed, Perry Bramlett\n\nPart I, \"Memories\", looks at Lewis as tutor and discusses the Magdalen College and undergraduate life at Oxford in Lewis's day. Part II, \"Reflections\", is an overview with comments on Lewis's space novels, Narnian stories, approach to romanticism (especially \"friendship\") in his thought especially and some of his works, and a discussion of some of Lewis's literary works. The book is enhanced by a previously unpublished photo of Lewis at age 21, right after he returned home after being wounded in WW1, holographs of letters from Lewis to Lawlor, and copies of annotated pages from a book Lewis owned and read often (arou"
