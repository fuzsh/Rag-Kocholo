        "text": "Let’s now take a closer look at two stations on Törni’s tumultuous journey through war-torn Germany that are not as great a mystery as „Hagenaun“ or the search for Felix Steiner.\n\nAccording to an interrogation report given by Törni to the Finnish State Police, [he and Korpela] had been held in a prisoner-of-war camp of about 5,000 prisoners for two and a half weeks before being transferred to Lübeck. Fortunately, both were dressed in standard German uniform and could not therefore be identified as SS members. […] In Lübeck, „the various nationalities had been dispersed to different parts of Germany“ and Törni and Korpela had ended up in the vast assembly area of Oldenburg. „The camp area had been extremely large,“ Törni said, „almost the whole province […] had been a prison camp, and there had been 4 or 5 million prisoners of war.“ Because of the vastness of the area, leaving the camp – escaping from prison – was not difficult. Most POWs stayed in the camp because at least it provided food, and many had nowhere else to go.\n\n(Juha Pohjonen & Oula Silvennoinen: Tuntematon Lauri Törni)\n\nThis is actually wrong on two accounts. Firstly, Törni and Korpela could be identified as Waffen-SS fairly easily, and the Allies had learned the trick: Members of the SS had their blood type tattooed under their left upper arm. (Not, by the way, on their biceps, as the Törni literature claims, but underneath it.) SS members quickly found out that the Allies had found out, and many cut or scraped away the telltale mark, but the resulting scar betrayed them anyway. However, with tens of thousands of prisoners flooding the system, nobody appears to have bothered to check at this stage.\n\nSecondly, German POWs, at least, did not stay in the camps because they provided food – quite the contrary. As already discussed in the Goliath outtake, food was scarce, especially during the first months of the Allied prison camp system. Rather,\n\nThere was no point in escaping for most of them; without release papers (D2-Schein), one received no food stamps, no residence permit and no work permit.\n\nAfter the Second World War, four British restricted areas in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein served to intern soldiers of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS. […] The British referred to the prisoners of war as Surrendered Enemy Personnel (SEP). The denial of prisoner of war status, which was contrary to international law, had already been established at the Yalta Conference in December 1943. According to the Hague Land Warfare Regulations and the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war had the right to immediate release after the end of hostilities and to be cared for in the same way as soldiers of the custodial power. Circumventing these regulations was intended to facilitate the search for war criminals.\n\n(https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britische_Sperrgebiete_in_Norddeutschland_nach_dem_Zweiten_Weltkrieg)\n\nLauri Törni and Solmu Korpela were transferred to Lübeck. There, the POWs were housed in the many barracks in and around town. But with so many prisoners coming in, and Allied troops, displaced persons and refugees needing a place to stay, as well, the situation became problematic very soon.\n\nAlex Hinrichsen, like the Finns, was a prisoner both at Lübeck and later in Holstein:\n\nThe „Tommys“ took watches from them, then they marched from the Wehrmeldeamt to Danziger Freiheit and the officers were taken by bus to a large meadow with 4,000 to 5,000 soldiers. For two days Hinrichsen took command of 600 sailors and 100 other soldiers in the Waldersee barracks, a prisoner-of-war camp. There they had formed a committee like a workers‘ and soldiers‘ council and were of the opinion that there were no longer any differences in rank among the prisoners of war. Hinrichsen, however, saw things quite differently. There was „still a strict military discipline“, he wrote, and he made that clear to the sailors. On 6 May, he took command of the Meesen barracks, which were meant for 2,000 men, but were occupied by 5,000 prisoners and had to take on about 1,000 new admissions every day. On 16 May there were already 13,000.\n\nPower failure, lack of water, clogged toilets – Hinrichsen reports on the terrible conditions and, above all, the scarcity of food. The British gave them a quarter of bread and half a tin of corned beef per day, far too little. They had tried to find food everywhere and yet „always lived from hand to mouth, from one day to the next“. […]\n\nOn 16 May, the prisoners left the Meesen barracks with 13,000 men, „in rows of six to the motorway and from there in a column of three in the direction of Ahrensbök“. Via Kasseedorf they finally went to the „Kral“, the large internment camp in eastern Holstein. The British had „intended it for about 750,000 German soldiers“. The British-guarded demarcation line ran from Schönberger Strand in an approximate line across Seelenter See, Plön, Eutin and Kasseedorf to Neustädter Bucht, including Fehmarn. Here, too, food and supplies for the prisoners were the biggest problem, writes Hinrichsen.\n\n(https://www.ln-online.de/Thema/K/Grosser-Rueckblick-Der-Zweite-Weltkrieg-im-Norden/Die-letzten-Tage-des-Krieges/Pro-Tag-ein-Viertel-Brot-und-eine-halbe-Dose-Corned-Beef&#8220;)\n\nAs can be seen from numerous reports, large parts, if not the majority, of all soldiers apparently arrived in the restricted area from Neustadt [in Holstein]. Until the end of June, they were transported there mainly by rail in closed freight cars […] primarily from provisional prison camps in Mecklenburg – always accompanied by the fear, fuelled by the wildest rumours, of being handed over to the Russians by the British. There was great relief when, for example, the position of the sun indicated that the journey was heading west or northwest. Arriving in Neustadt, but also in Eutin or Malente, „supplied“ with a few English biscuits, the often days-long, energy-sapping marches began. Everywhere in the villages, however, drinks were provided, even if it was only water. In most cases, it was not possible to provide the huge columns with food, because at the end of the war even the rural population no longer had large stocks of food. But as far as it was possible, help was given. […]\n\nThe then First Lieutenant Hans-Joachim Paris reported that his marching column needed 3 full days for the approximately 30 km route from Neustadt […] to the first destination Lütjenburg. A higher marching performance could not be achieved with the 7 biscuits handed out for the way, especially as there had been no rations during the train journey to Neustadt either. […]\n\nAlready in the last weeks of the war, due to the partly chaotic external circumstances, the food supply of the soldiers was no longer guaranteed, with the result that most of them went into captivity already weakened. Before they were transferred to the restricted area F, many of them had already been inadequately fed for days and weeks in British prison camps in Mecklenburg.\n\nAlthough the behaviour of the British towards the German soldiers was generally described as fair, in some cases there were dishonourable transgressions. For example, it was reported that in one case in Neustadt the German prisoners of war were driven out of the wagons by the British soldiers with whips. […] Very often it is reported that German soldiers were individually „frisked“ […] by the British before they were taken into the restricted area. Unless this had already happened on a previous occasion, anything that looked like valuables, such as watches, wedding rings, special medals, etc., was taken from them, sometimes under threat of violence. A situation that was repeatedly deplored, especially since such behaviour had not been expected from the British.\n\n(Peter Wippich: Der „Kral“ im Kreis Plön)\n\nWippich’s description is echoed in nearly all eyewitness accounts that I have come across in the past ten years or so. Red Army soldiers‘ hunt for watches has become almost legendary, but Western Allied troops were actually no better. Of course, it always depended on the individual soldier. There are also many accounts of German POWs trading their valuables to US or British guards for food or cigarettes; and Günter Adam even reports on a business venture he and some of his fellow prisoners set up to produce fake gold rings for bartering.\n\nAfter some time, the swindle was known and we were stuck with the goods. The British called my products „fucking Sandbostel gold“ [after Sandbostel POW camp]. But afterwards the rings were also very popular among our comrades as birthday presents, etc.\n\n(Günter Adam: „Ich habe meine Pflicht erfüllt!“)\n\nSperrgebiet F, also called „Kral“, Zone F, POW Zone F, Sperrzone F or PW Area F, comprised the entire district of Oldenburg in Holstein (not to be confused with Oldenburg in Lower Saxony), parts of the district of Eutin and parts of the district of Plön. In the early days, an estimated 750,000 soldiers were interned in the restricted area.\n\nEspecially in the first months, accommodation was often inadequate. It was not uncommon for the prisoners to have to set up in open fields in holes in the ground or crowd together in stables and barns. Accommodation in houses and on farms was particularly difficult because many had already taken in refugees. Mass accommodation with occupancies of more than 200 people on one farm was not uncommon.\n\nThe daily ration of 300 grams of bread and weekly 250 grams of meat corresponded to one third of the ration of a Brit.\n\n(©)\n\nThe prisoners were distributed over a large area and had extensive freedom of movement in the restricted zones. The British had withdrawn and limited themselves to occasional patrols. Access to the restricted area was only possible with a pass. The borders were not secured by barbed wire and gates. They were based on the landscape conditions. Main access roads were secured by turnpikes and posts. British and Germans alone or together provided these posts. Secondary roads were made impassable for vehicles. The actual green border was secured by German two-man patrols. The control by the (armed) German Feldjägers was very casual. On the other hand, being caught by the British when crossing the border without a pass could result in a prison sentence of several months. A shoot-to-kill order was in force, but the use of firearms against fugitives was unknown. In June 1945, 5,700 volunteers helped in Wehrmacht police troops. Most of the Feldjägers were housed in permanent quarters; however, better rations were not initially available. The German guard units were also called upon to provide object protection for rations stores, fields ready for harvesting, detention buildings and other facilities. […]\n\nThe prisoners were to administer themselves – under British supervision. In controlling, caring for and supplying so many people, the British made pragmatic use of the existing command structures of the Wehrmacht. […] In this grey zone under international law, the German and foreign soldiers had to maintain military hierarchy and discipline.\n\nAs far as the orders of their superiors permitted, the soldiers were allowed to move freely outside the nightly curfew hours. The old uniforms with rank insignia, orders and decorations continued to be worn. Only the swastikas had to be removed. Military salutes were compulsory. The soldiers were subject to German disciplinary authority and received military pay.\n\n(https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britische_Sperrgebiete_in_Norddeutschland_nach_dem_Zweiten_Weltkrieg)\n\nHaving Germans guarding Germans – and POWs of other nationalities! – might appear odd, to say the least, but it was far from uncommon. Back in Lübeck, Erich Mende and his fellow officers from the 102nd Infantery Division (who also ended up in the „Kral“) found themselves more or less drafted into the position of camp guards for good reasons:\n\nAccompanied by four British motorcyclists and two other British jeeps, we drove towards the divisional command post in Lübeck without knowing what would happen to the troops. There we were told that we would be driven to the Adolf Hitler Barracks in Lübeck by order of the division general and that we would have the task of taking over the prison camp there and ensuring discipline and order.\n\nThe picture of the old Lübeck barracks, still called Adolf Hitler Barracks by the British, was bad. About 2,000 to 3,000 German prisoners-of-war from all parts of the Wehrmacht, colonels without epaulets, officers and non-commissioned officers without medals and rank insignia; a jeering crowd welcomed us, as we still wore our rank insignia and our medals. Some of them had red armbands on. It looked anything but disciplined! Obviously, the signs of disbandment were abhorrent even to the British. For an officer asked us to tell him our wishes as to how we thought this prisoner-of-war camp in Lübeck should be taken over. We explained that we would only be able to take over this camp if our troops, who were still at the River Trave south of Lübeck, joined us, because only in this way would we have the necessary soldiers to restore peace and order here. This was promised […].\n\nUpon arrival at the camp, Colonel Dr. Ludwig ordered his Silesian soldiers to line up and declared that […] he was now appointing his old […] troops as camp police. […]\n\nThis appearance and the impression made by the Silesian soldiers in full uniform […] caused a miracle. In no time at all the rioters were silent, the demonstrations ended, the red armbands disappeared. The badges of rank and the epaulettes were eagerly sewn on again […].\n\n(Joachim Schultz-Naumann: Mecklenburg 1945)\n\nWhile keeping the military hierarchy intact no doubt prevented the overcrowded camps from descending into anarchy and chaos, German guards, no matter how casual, did not go down so well with all prisoners, as Günter Adam remembered from winter 1946:\n\nOn the watchtowers we saw new uniforms, if they could be called such at all. Grey windbreakers, our familiar mountain caps. The guard in the walkway between the wires was dressed in the same way. Incredulous, we called out to them, „Are you Germans?“, to which they replied in the affirmative. This hit us like a slap in the face! Outraged, we spat in front of them. Under the leadership of the „general“ we formed a line, marched along the wire and spat in front of each post. It was not so easy to gather so much spit, but we persevered.\n\n(Günter Adam)\n\nAround 2,800 soldiers fled from restricted area F. […]\n\nVolkssturm men, schoolboys (Flakhelfer), female Wehrmacht helpers and paramilitaries (Reich Labour Service), the seriously wounded and the seriously ill had already been released in May 1945. They were followed by soldiers with ties to agriculture if they were not officers and did not belong to the Waffen-SS, the paratroopers or the Gestapo. After that, miners for coal mining and those working in transport occupations were released. Finally, the great masses were released regardless of profession. […] In the search for members of the Waffen-SS, tattoos were checked during the final medical examination. […]\n\nThe last prisoners of war (senior officers and members of the Waffen-SS) left Sperrgebiet F on 2 March 1946 and were shipped to a prisoner-of-war camp in Belgium.\n\n(https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britische_Sperrgebiete_in_Norddeutschland_nach_dem_Zweiten_Weltkrieg. Emphasis mine.)\n\nSo Törni and Korpela were actually wise to become two of the approximately 2,800 prisoners to escape from the camp. (Author Peter Wippich suspects that, like Törni and Korpela, most escapees were members of the Waffen-SS, but that is pure speculation.) But in addition to the British search for potential war criminals, there was something equally, if not more, dangerous going on in the „Kral“:\n\nAgain and again, rumours circulated that the POWs would be handed over to the Russians after all, or that Russians secretly came by ship across the Bay of Lübeck into the restricted area to lure internees into the Soviet-occupied zone with promises of good treatment there. But these had a very real background, because Soviet officers actually did come into the area without the British always knowing about it. On 10 June 1945, Colonel Becker […] reported to the Chill section command in Hasselburg that on 9 June two Red Army officers had appeared at the local command in Kassau with the request to be led to a camp of Russians who had fought on the German side […]. They had received instructions from their military command to take the men in the camp with them. Since the Soviet officers did not want to or could not produce the corresponding permission from the British, the Russian camp inmates were not handed over to them. The interned Russians, moreover, expressed the wish to remain in the (forest) camp […].\n\nThe situation was similar in the Bocksbarg wood, north of Rantzau village. About 1,500 soldiers camped there, about 500 of them Lithuanians. One day in summer, the camp was visited by members of the Soviet army, accompanied by armed British, who wanted to pick up the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians, however, strictly and vociferously refused to follow the Russians – apparently with the acquiescence of the British. The Russians had to leave without having achieved anything.\n\nSince the visits of Soviet officers to the restricted area F without the knowledge of the British became more frequent, von Stockhausen’s corps group, among others, received an order from the VIII British Corps in Plön in June 1945 that persons who „apparently in the disguise of officers or soldiers of British allies“ would enter the area without authorisation were to be arrested and taken to the nearest British unit or guard. Quite obviously, the paraphrase „disguise“ was intended to make it less obvious to the German military authorities (and factual wartime enemies) that the British were distrustful of the allied Russians.\n\n(Peter Wippich)\n\nVia Kiel, Lauri Törni and Solmu Korpela managed to make their way homeward.\n\nFor a couple of weeks, Törni and Korpela moved northwards from the camp area. After reaching Kiel, they had „met Finnish girls who had brought them food from German ships“. [Probably very welcome after weeks of starving at Hagenow, Lübeck and Sperrgebiet F!] By walking and hitchhiking, the men made their way back to Flensburg, where they met other Neu-Strelitz students. […] Once in Flensburg, Törni and Korpela began to feel safe. They had many acquaintances from Sonderkommando Nord nearby and could rely on them. Georg Hayen, a German military intelligence agent and Sonderkommando officer, accommodated both men in his house […]. On 14 June 1945, Korpela wrote in Georg Hayen’s guest book: „We are sitting here in ‚Papa Hayen’s‘ home, relaxing and waiting for our departure to Finland. I take this opportunity to thank you for all the help you have given us while we are wandering here in a foreign land.“ Below both wrote their names. […] At Flensburg, Törni and Korpela were joined by SS volunteer Alpo Kanerva. After a few weeks of waiting, the trio secretly crossed the Danish border and made their way to the Swedish consulate in Aabenraa.\n\n(Pohjonen & Silvennoinen)\n\nAnd this, as a personal aside, is what makes research so interesting: the little things! I don’t think Pohjonen and Silvennoinen realised the significance of that tiny bit of information in Törni’s interrogation report. I don’t think most readers do. Why would Törni mention something as seemingly mundane as getting food from some girls in Kiel? We now know why: Because he and his buddy had not had much to eat since at least early May. They were really hungry! And so the chance encounter with their countrywomen became one of the highlights of their journey.\n\nThe Lauri Törni in Germany 1945 series:\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart 1\n\nOuttake: Felix Steiner\n\nOuttake: The Goliath POW camp\n\nPart 2\n\nOuttake: Odds and loose ends\n\nOuttake: Riikka Ojanperä, and a visit from the beyond\n\nMore Törni-related blog content:\n\n„Alles, was ich getan habe, geschah zum Wohle meines Landes.“\n\nOperation Swift Strike III"
