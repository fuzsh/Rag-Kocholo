        "text": "GENEVA, Nov. 7 — Thirty directors and executives of Investors Overseas Services when the mutual fund empire was ruled by Bernard Cornfeld, its founder, have been accused of fraud in a complaint filed with the Geneva public prosecutor, it was learned today.\n\nThe complaint was lodged by a group of 68 Swiss I.O.S. employes, including many who invested in the company.\n\nAmong the members of the former top management echelon who were named in the domplaint are Mr. Cornfeld, who severed his connections with I.O.S. early this year; James Roosevelt; son of the late President Roosevelt, and Sir Eric Wyndham White, former international trade official.\n\nOther prominent former I.O.S. officials named by the plaintiffs include. Count Carl Johan Bernadotte, a member of the Swedish royal family, and Erich Mende, former West German Vice Chancellor.\n\nThe complaint alleges improper conduct by the I.O.S. management in the splitting of the company's shares an in the selling of an issue of shares to the public in September, 1969.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that at the time of this public offering the then‐I.O.S. management knew that the company's finances were already in the shaky condition that led to the crisis in the spring of the following year.\n\nUnder local law, the prosecutor will first undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether to quash the complaint or continue examining it to determine whether formal charges should be brought against those named.\n\nLawyers say the proceedings could drag on for many months."
