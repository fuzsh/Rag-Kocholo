        "text": "Awesome Legacy Systems\n\nA curated list of awesome resources and links about tackling legacy systems that gives hope.\n\nHi! My name is Markus Harrer. I created this repository to share a set of resources and links that I found valuable and inspiring while working with legacy systems. I hope that you'll like it, too!\n\nImage source: Ancient scroll vector created by upklyak - www.freepik.com\n\nLegacy Systems are systems that you might be too afraid of to change. But they are necessary because they make all the money for your company. Thus, developers often have to maintain these older systems whether they want or not.\n\nLegacy systems have their own fascinations and challenges that can be much more interesting than just gluing together some frameworks in a green-field project. But the lack of knowledge about how to tackle legacy systems is a big problem. Most developers just learn how to create new systems initially and not how to maintain existing ones or even evolve those systems. This list tries to close these gaps.\n\nBooks\n\nBlogs\n\nArticles\n\nMicrosites\n\nPodcasts\n\nTalks\n\nConferences\n\nCourses\n\nLists of Tools\n\nOther Languages\n\nLearning Paths\n\nRelated Awesome Lists\n\nThe resources are ordered alphabetically the first author's surname for books and articles or the name of the resource for all the other resources)\n\nRobert Annett: Working with Legacy Systems (2019) - Short book that gives you plenty of tips on what you can do with legacy systems.\n\nLen Bass, Paul Clements, Rick Kazman – Software Architecture in Practice (2021) - Although this book focuses on software architecture in general, I like the idea of \"architectural tactics\" that propose solutions you can choose to fulfill specific quality goals like \"deployability,\" \"performance,\" or \"security.\" This book could be a valuable source for you when you want to improve your existing system.\n\nMarianne Bellotti: Kill It with Fire (2021) - A book that gives a fresh look at working with legacy systems.
