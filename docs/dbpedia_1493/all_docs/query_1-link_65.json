        "text": "So, I’ve examined four parodies of Alice. None of these examples were appropriate for children to read, nor even possible for a child to fully understand on a linguistic level even if topics such as murder, pornography, propaganda, and political atrocities were appropriate for children to read. Not only did they then play to an adult audience in subject matter, but also in linguistic terms too. This would seem to be one thing which they all had in common.\n\nEach of them also made references to the original Alice; be it through title, subject matter, characters, or even plot. Despite this reference, each story made sure to invert the reader’s expectations in regards to the relative innocence of the story—often mocking their referent in the process, as can be seen in Adolf’s use of illustrative style, or in Blue Alice’s insertion (…no pun intended but you’re free to use your imagination) of sex scenes into the otherwise original plot line.\n\nIt is important to note also how they diverge from the original: most (with the exception of Blue Alice) are seeming to use the Alice characters as more of a mask of familiarity to the story—not actually sticking verbatim to the plot. This is most visible in Alice in Sponsor-land and Malice in Wonderland wherein there are few similarities to the original story other than the character names and a few tropes. This would obviously rely on the reader to have a greater knowledge of the original story in order to understand the references made."
