He first kills a 93-year-old fisherman (Burns) by pushing him off a dock. He then visits Jersey resident John Treadwell (Jones), who works in an office so obsessed with health that the secretary (Edwards) doesn't even speak (rather she communicates through pre-recorded statements as to avoid catching a cold). Treadwell, a man in his 50s, agrees to have his tiresome and infirmed 82-year-old mother-in-law (Patterson) \"dealt with\", as she is likely to live to another thirty-plus years. She constantly enjoys causing a ruckus and making noise (which annoys his wife (Windust) of twenty-seven years and teenage children as well), saying that being quiet is for the grave. Bunce kills the old woman by pushing her wheelchair off a dock on a Sunday morning while the family attends church (as it is a law that all must attend church unless in possession of a health certificate, although John illegally goes fishing). Treadwell then realizes that it is only a matter of time before his own children, son Jack (Meadows) and daughter Jill (Kilgas), have him \"dealt with\" as well, as is implied by Bunce.\n\nSupporting Cast: Irene Windust as Mrs. Treadwell, Vaughn Meadows as Jack Treadwell, Nancy Kilgas as Jill Treadwell, Paul E.

Courtney then goes to the police and gives a false story of picking up a hitchhiker and then having a struggle in which he kills in self-defense. Police Inspector Silva (de Corsia) informs Courtney of the thug's name and violent background after being brought the file by another plain-clothes police officer (Dockstader). When he goes to the office the next day, Courtney says hello to secretary Reita (Green) before his personal assistant Mary (Bonney) informs him that a detective is waiting in his office. Instead of a police detective, it is a private detective (Stroud) that has been hired by Courtney's wife (Greene) to follow him for the previous 5 days. This detective saw everything, drops the thug's recovered knife on the table, and states that it would be mutually profitable if they discussed the matter before he files his report with the wife or police.\n\nSupporting Cast: Ted de Corsia as Police Inspector Salva, Angela Greene as Mrs. Masterson, Claude Stroud as Lester Elleridge (the Private Detective), Gail Bonney as Mary (the Personal Assistant), Reita Green as Reita (the Secretary), George Dockstader as plainclothes police officer\n\n16310\"Special Delivery\"Norman LloydRay BradburySteve Dunne as Bill Fortnam, Beatrice Straight as Cynthia FortnamNovember 29, 1959 ( )\n\nTom Fortnam (Lazer), like many boys all over the country, is excitedly buying mail-order mushrooms to grow in his home's cellar, and a delivery man (Hagerty) soon delivers them.

Bill and his wife Cynthia Fortnam (Straight) are worried when Roger mysteriously disappears after his son Joe (Burns) beginning to grow mushrooms, as well as warning them that something catastrophic is going to happen. Roger's wife Dorothy (Whitney) begs Bill to find Roger. Bill and Cynthia are then visited by a messenger (O'Neill) with a telegram (from Roger) urging them not to accept any special deliveries. Bill then gets a call from police, who says that Roger willfully and cheerfully was found taking a train to New Orleans. Bill posits an alien invasion by space spores that grow into mushrooms and possess human bodies after being eaten.

Fratus purposefully runs the Pine truck off the road and Davey dies as the truck gets stuck in the mud. A doctor (Wynn) even tells Sam that Davey would have lived if they had gotten him there in time.

Sam escorts Fratus to his home to fill up Fratus' gas tank. While waiting, Sam confronts Fratus with the death of his son and Fratus' culpability. Sam insinuates that he has poisoned Fratus with tainted alcohol and Fratus rushes to the doctor. However, one of Sam's sons performs exactly as Fratus had acted on the day of Davey's death by blocking the road, and in his panic Fratus crashes his car and dies. As revealed, the drink was indeed just water, not poison.\n\nSupporting Cast: Ray Teal as Ben Tulip, Brad Weston as Sam Pine Jr., Jack Easton, Jr. as Davey Pine, Roscoe Ates as Tavern Customer, Gordon Wynn as Doctor, Betsy Hale as Little Girl, Snub Pollard as Bar Patron (uncredited)\n\n16512\"Specialty of the House\"Robert StevensStory by : Stanley Ellin\n\nTeleplay by : Victor Wolfson & Bernard C.
