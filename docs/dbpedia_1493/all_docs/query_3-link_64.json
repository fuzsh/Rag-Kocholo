It presupposes no knowledge of cultural history, familiarity with subject matter, compositional principles, and allegorical content. The comic links individual scenes into a pictorial “text,” which does not necessarily say everything but whose interstices can be filled in associatively and by bringing in the person of the viewer to constitute a story. The democratic pictorial understanding innate to the comic, to sequential art, which – despite the name – is not necessarily “comic,” encapsulates the pretensions of institutions concerned with communicating art and bridging the gap between art production and the public.\n\nThe exhibition assembles an international spectrum of politically motivated sequential art from the invention of printing to the present day. All the works have a decidedly political dimension and they are presented not chronologically but in terms of content. These thematic complexes allow cross-references and allusions beyond the given historical context. The architecture on the upper floor of the Kunstverein specially developed for this exhibition underpins this reference system. The display elements recall the spatial sequences of a comic. Each and every panel is a self-contained unit that nevertheless interchanges with other themes offering cross-links. On the ground floor, Keith Haring’s graffiti provide a projection surface for classical presentation.\n\nThe two exhibition spaces relate text to image in their own way, inviting various approaches. The two levels are connected by the entrance area designed by Stefan Marx (*1979, lives in Hamburg). The extensive floor drawing takes up comic motifs, condensing them to constitute a complex universe. In turn, the mural provides a surface for exhibiting other drawings and posters to be added in the course of the year, continuously modifying the installation. This dynamic approach is consonant with the place and in keeping with Marx’ artistic practice. Besides classical sheets he also produces record covers, T-Shirts, skateboards, or small magazines, which he publishes on his own by simple means.\n\nThe exhibition is funded by the German Federal Cultural Foundation. The Kunstverein is funded by Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien.\n\nKunstverein Hamburg\n\nDer Kunstverein, since 1817.\n\nKlosterwall 23\n\n20095 Hamburg"
