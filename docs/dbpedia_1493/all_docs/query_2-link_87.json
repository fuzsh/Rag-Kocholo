Her artistic output thus establishes her as a comparatively prolific singer. Naturally, it is the quality and not the number of those recordings that should concern the aficionado of Anglophone popular music the most. Lenner’s elegant, seductive, and instantly recognizable voice is for me the stuff of sublime fantasy — but as a reference work, this discography does not aim to convince the reader of the artistic merits of each entry. Rather, I have devoted a new website to that aim: annelenner.com.\n\nAnne Lenner’s career as a recording artist was intimately connected with that of Carroll Gibbons. It was he who discovered her singing in a nightclub, and the vast majority of her records were made with Gibbons as director of the Savoy Hotel Orpheans or the subset thereof known as “The Boy Friends,” or with Gibbons as a solo pianist.\n\nIt was with the Boy Friends that Lenner would make some of her earliest but most noteworthy recordings for commercial radio programs sponsored by Hartley’s Jam in 1934-1935. They were therefore not mass-market records, but transcriptions for radio broadcasts. Collectors will not find these in the wild — only single copies are known to have survived as part of Carroll Gibbons’s personal collection — but fortunately the songs have been issued on LP and CD, so we may include them in our assessment of an important phase in Lenner’s career.\n\nLenner also made recordings with bandleaders George Scott Wood, Stan Atkins, Joe Loss, Maurice Winnick, Jack White, Jay Wilbur, Frank Weir, and Harold Geller. These collaborations were essentially one-offs; she would not continue to record with any of these groups.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Lenner recorded transcriptions to be broadcast to the troops. Many of these survive, and what is known about them is listed in this book.\n\nThis is the third vocalist discography that I have produced in the course of three years. There were a number of factors that made this one easier than the others. Such a large part of Lenner’s artistic output comes in the form of dance band vocal refrains, and as such it was covered by Rust and Forbes in their British Dance Bands on Record. Many of the recordings that do not fall into Rust and Forbes’s bailiwick have been the subject of studies by Terry Brown and Mike Thomas. And such an overwhelming number of Anne Lenner’s vocals appeared on the Columbia FB series of records, which has been well documented by Michael Smith and Frank Andrews. I am, therefore, particularly aware of my standing on the shoulders of giants in issuing an Anne Lenner discography.\n\nI aim for completeness and accuracy, but of course I have not seen or heard everything listed here. One of the reasons that I publish my discographies online is so that I may correct and update them regularly. If you have a record with an Anne Lenner vocal on it that is not listed in this little book, please contact me. For that matter, if you notice that the catalogue number for a record side is in italics, that means that I have not been able to examine it yet; again, if you happen to own the record, please contact me, and perhaps you can share a scan or photograph of the label. And be sure to check for updates to Too Romantic: An Anne Lenner Discography in web format on annelenner.com or in PDF format on Zenodo.\n\nFor their assistance in my research, I would like to thank:\n\nTerry Brown\n\nThe City of London Phonograph and Gramophone Society\n\nRobert Girling\n\nCharles Hippisley-Cox\n\nErin Elisavet Kozak\n\nSteve Paget\n\nHenry Parsons\n\nPeter Wallace\n\nJohn Watson\n\nJohn Wright\n\nA.

Matrix 7272 includes “Boston Bounce” (Lamarr-Dallas-Harris), copyright June 22, 1944 and first recorded in Britain in November 1944. Matrix 8751 includes the song “It’s been a long, long time” (Styne-Cahn), copyright August 3, 1945 and first recorded in Britain in November 1945. It seems reasonable to conjecture, then, that matrices 7677 and 7680 were recorded around the early part of 1945.\n\nProgram 7 sides 1 and 3 and program 8 sides 1 and 3 likely include Lenner as well.\n\nMGT-ORBS\n\nTHE ARMY RADIO ORCHESTRA (RSM George Melachrino dir.).

Dixon) Col FB-3526\n\nFB\n\nAppendix A: Recordings Misattributed to Anne Lenner\n\nOn occasion, other singer’s voices are identified as Anne Lenner’s. On the internet, I often see “I’ll never be the same,” recorded by Carroll Gibbons and His Boy Friends (1932; Col DB-1000 mx. CA-13231-1), listed as having a Lenner vocal, but really the voice is Cecile Petrie’s. I have not yet identified the source of this error.\n\n“Where there’s you there’s me” (Col FB-1336 mx. CA-15585-1) and “From one minute to another” (Col FB-1322 mx. CA-15587-1), recorded in 1936 by Louis Levy and His Gaumont British Symphony, have vocals by Anne Lenner’s sister Judy Shirley. Occasional incorrect attributions to Anne Lenner would seem to have originated on World Records SH 258 (Music from the Movies: Louis Levy and His Gaumont British Symphony).\n\nAppendix B: Conventions Used in This Discography\n\n1. Session Headers\n\nCapital letters are used to represent band names and personal names that actually appear on the record labels, whereas mixed-case names do not actually appear on the labels. Other information that does appear on the labels (e.g., “pianoforte duet,” “vocal chorus”) is provided in lowercase, and details that are not on the labels (such as the identity of an uncredited musical director) are put between parentheses. Any information after the first period is entirely supplemental and will not be found on a label.\n\nSometimes a detail such as the identity of a duettist may be marked by a hyphenated number between parentheses (e.g., “(-1)”); in such cases, the detail only pertains to certain songs recorded at a session that will also be marked with that number.\n\nLocations are given when they are known, and the dates or approximate dates are for the original recording session (issue dates are not listed).\n\nAs this is a vocalist discography, individual band personnel are not generally identified. Readers may consult Rust and Forbes (1989) for the personnel of dance band recordings.\n\n2. Tables\n\nThe tables that list the recordings made at every session provide:\n\nMatrix and take numbers: A matrix number identifies a record side and will be found on the shellac itself (often also on the label). A take number frequently also appears on the shellac; when it does not, discographers try to supply it from other sources (such as studio ledgers). Matrix numbers often involve a prefix followed by a number (e.g., “CA-15813”). Takes that are known to have been actually issued are underlined in this text (e.g., “CA-15813-1). I explicitly list every take mentioned by my sources (which include the evidence of the records themselves). In the case of the 1934-1935 Hartley’s Jam programs, in which there are two songs on every side of each radio transcript, I sometimes use a dash (“—”) in place of a matrix number to show that a song is on the same side of the record as the preceding entry.\n\nSong name and songwriter(s): Each song’s name is listed as it appears on the record. I include any extra information provided by record labels, such as the stage play or film origin of a title, in parentheses (in the format “from West End Musical,” “film Hollywood Movie”). Songwriter’s names are included as they are listed on the label; in rare cases I have quietly corrected a spelling error or added a known songwriter who was for some reason omitted from the label.\n\nRecord label(s), catalogue number(s), etc.: For each known 78 rpm-era record pressed from a given matrix, I list the label name (using the abbreviations established by Rust and Forbes [1989]) and the catalogue number. Non-UK issues have a two-letter country code in parentheses. If no takes of a particular matrix made at a session were ever issued, I term them “rejected” if another attempt was made to record them and “unissued” if no further attempt was made. When matrices were unissued during the 78 rpm era but later released on vinyl, I identify the release as being an LP by underlining it. Labels in italics are ones that I have yet to encounter; if you have them, please contact me to share your label scans or photographs.\n\n3. Session Notes\n\nAny further discussion of a session or individual songs is found below the session tables in italics.\n\n4. Source Abbreviations\n\nSmall, boldface codes are listed after every session to show relevant sources. I generally include all sources that mention any element of a session, not just those that I believe to be correct. I rely on the evidence of my own collection implicitly."
