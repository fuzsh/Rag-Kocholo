        "text": "A recorded feature programme\n\nThe speakers are the skippers and crews of trawlers fishing from\n\nScottish East Coast ports\n\nRecorded under the direction of Alan\n\nMelville\n\nSince the outbreak of war the men who man the North Sea fishing fleets have carried out their ceaseless work under constant danger of attack from U-boat and bomber.\n\nThe BBC has visited the East\n\nScottish ports of Aberdeen and Granton, collecting the first-hand experiences of men who have actually been under fire or in danger from U-boats. You will also hear what the trawler-man's wife has to say about things.\n\nAnother scene between a fishmonger and a housewife, discussing the price of ' caller herrin' ', will point the moral that the dependants of the men who go to sea are now even more justified Jn calling fish ' lives o' men '.\n\n[Home Service continued overleaf\n\nMusic in ebony from Harlem to Savannah with Elizabeth Welch, Frisco, Evelyn Dove, Malmaison, the Georgia Crackers, the BBC Revue Orchestra, conducted by Hyam Greenbaum\n\nScript by the compere, James Dyrenforth\n\nProduced by Roy Speer\n\nElizabeth Welch by the warm colour of her voice has endeared herself to listeners. Born in New York City, she was singing at nine years old. She sang in a church choir, a glee club, and a quartet, then found her way to the theatre. She met Caleb Porter; met him again in Paris, and he said: 'I've a song for you.' She sang 'Solomon' at the Boeufsur-le-Tok and then at Chez Florence. Then C.B. Cochran engaged her for Nymph Errant at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, and she never looked back. She won radio fame in 'Soft Lights and Sweet Music'.\n\nEvelyn Dove, London-born and as lovely a coloured singer as ever broadcast, was a student at the Royal Academy of Music, studying singing and music. Then she went abroad. She has performed in no fewer than nineteen countries, and made a great hit in cabaret at Connie's Inn, New York. She was a radio favourite in the States. Two years ago she came to England to win radio fame over here.\n\nFrisco was the name given to Joscelyn Bingham, also a coloured artist, when he drew crowds wherever he appeared in San Francisco. He came to Europe and added to his fame. not only as an artist but as a club proprietor. 'Frisco's', both in Paris and London, became famous. He last appeared on the stage in Erik Charell's production of The Merry Widow in Berlin before the days when Hitler was to take everything merry from that city."
