        "text": "Last month, my time in San Diego came to a close as I graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Kinesiology. I learned so many incredible lessons throughout my time in college, and look forward to the next steps in my journey. I recently relocated to San Francisco where I will be interning at the Dolhun Clinic for the year while I apply to medical school. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to move to a new city and gain valuable experience that will stick with me into my future career, and to begin the long-awaited process of applying to medical school. With so much exciting change in the past month, I have begun to see my work over the past several years come together! I look forward to what the future has in store and the opportunities that await."
