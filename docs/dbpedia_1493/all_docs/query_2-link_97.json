        "text": "I was most interested to read an article about Janet Lind/Reita Nugent yesterday.\n\nI was interested to hear an interview with Janet Lind done in Australia in 1979 on YouTube recently. It may be heard at the following link: https://youtu.be/Wyz3T2Zj6YY\n\nShe started her career in Australia as an acrobatic dancer under her birth name of Reita Nugent. I heard from Stephen Langley who uploaded the youtube video and he gave me a link to a British Pathé video of Reita Nugent doing some amazing dancing in 1928. Indian Rubber Muscles (1928)\n\nStephen commented as follows:\n\nThanks for your most informative account of her life – your blog really does her justice and the clippings are most interesting. I believe she was an extraordinary artist, and I agree that her recordings with Webster Booth reveal a great artist and natural talent. It was I who supplied the 1978 interview sourced from a deceased estate and put it on my YouTube site.\n\nI I remember her well as I used to purchase 78s off her in the early 1980s. By then she ran a small second hand shop ( op-shop) and was not in the best of health. Years of chain smoking and I suspect alcohol consumption had aged her considerably although she maintained her poise.\n\nShe arrived in England via a long-running show in Berlin in the 1930s. Without any vocal training and unable to read a note of music, almost by chance she began singing, and changed her name to Janet Lind. She did numerous broadcasts on the BBC, not only as a singer with the big band of Louis Levy, but also as an actress in a number of straight plays.\n\nThe songs featured in the YouTube broadcast are with Louis Levy’s brassy big band and she is remembered today primarily as a regular vocalist with this band.\n\n1936. A letter in one of the Australian papers.\n\nShe also made several recordings with Webster Booth for HMV in 1936 and 1937, and these are very much more pleasing to my ear than the songs she sang with Louis Levy’s band. Despite her lack of musical and vocal training she had an excellent natural voice. Click on the link to listen:\n\nThis Year of Theatreland (1936)\n\nHome and Beauty (1937)\n\nShe flourished as a performer in England in the last half of the 1930s, often singing songs made popular by Jessie Matthews. She was billed as “the girl with a smile in her voice”.\n\nShe returned to Australia in 1940 with her husband, Mr Hall.\n\nI am not sure how long she continued her theatrical career in Australia, but by the 1970s she was living in Melbourne and running an op- shop – some people called it an antique shop; others were less complimentary about it. In her 1979 interview she had no trace of an Australian accent. Presumably that is why she took part in a number of straight plays on the BBC in the 1930s.\n\nStephen added: A friend of mine recalls buying a pile of 78s from her in the late 70s and she sheepishly said…’I am on some of those’… He didn’t believe her at the time and only realised later that she had been a star. I also recall sitting in the studio at 3CR ( as an observer) a few days after she died and there was a big tribute to her from those who knew her better than I . I have this on a cassette somewhere so may try and upload it too.\n\nDespite her theatrical and vocal success in earlier decades, in old age she was casual and deprecating about her achievements. Many other singers who studied singing earnestly would have given a lot to have had such a successful career!\n\nJEAN COLLEN 28 MAY 2022\n\nADDENDUM I was grateful to receive copies of Reita Nugent’s birth and death certificates from Nicholas Murphy, who wrote the article mentioned at the beginning of this one.\n\nShortly after Anne Ziegler’s death in October 2003, I started work on my first book, Sweethearts of Song: a Personal Memoir of Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth. I published this book in 2006 and resolved to try to keep their names and voices before the public. I started a Yahoo Group which did not attract many members so after a few years I closed it and started The Golden Age of Webster Booth-Anne Ziegler and Friends on Facebook in October of 2014. Some members from the original Yahoo group joined the present one and the group grew in size as Facebook users joined. I have since changed the name of the group to The Webster Booth-Anne Ziegler Appreciation Group.\n\nWe were very lucky indeed when Mike Taylor joined the group. He has a vast collection of 78rpms and had recently developed an interest in Webster’s voice and began to collect his recordings. Not only did he share these recordings with us but he also restored them to pristine condition. He has found many rare recordings which he was kind enough to share with us over the years the group has been running. Here is an example of one of the recordings:\n\nFor You Alone\n\nHe also introduced us to other singers of the same period. My favourite from that period is the versatile Maurice Elwin (née Norman Blair). He recorded under many different pseudonyms and under the pseudonym of Donald O’Keefe he wrote some charming ballads – Webster recorded three of them.\n\nPlay to me Gypsy (Maurice Elwin)\n\nAt the End of the Day (Webster Booth)\n\nMike and I have managed to find all the duet recordings by Webster and Anne and are just short of 10 solo recordings by Webster out of the many hundreds he recorded. Whether these missing recordings, made in the thirties and forties of the twentieth century, will ever be found remains to be seen but Mike assures me that he is still on the look-out for them.\n\nThe late John Henderson often shared recordings and information with us, and a few other members have played an active role in the group even if it is just by ‘liking’ or commenting on the various posts. It certainly makes a difference to me to have some kind of reaction to what is posted to the group. I am grateful that John Marwood became our third administrator and recently Marie Lamb, a broadcaster on Classic FM in Syracuse has become the fourth administrator. I hope they will carry on the group if I anything should happen to me.\n\nI have been looking through the Radio Times from the 1920s and1930s. The complete magazines from those decades are available online on the BBC Genome site. Webster started broadcasting in 1927 and after he introduced Anne to the powers-that-be at the BBC at the beginning of 1935 she was in great demand on the radio too. In these early editions of the Radio Times, I have seen names of many artistes I recognise, but there are also many more artistes who must have been equally popular in their day but whose names are completely unknown to me.\n\nWebster and Anne were extremely popular in those far-off days but not many people remember them today. In comparison to other groups on Facebook, I have kept the membership small as I prefer to have a small group of interested people rather than a large group of people who have no idea who Anne and Webster were and never contribute to discussions.\n\nBecause we have found most of Anne and Webster’s recordings it is sometimes difficult to know what to post. I have created a number of medleys using their voices interspersed with light orchestral works. I’m not sure whether they are of great interest to anyone and sometimes I feel quite despondent about the lack of response from certain members who look at what I have posted and pass on without comment, but it would be a shame to close the group as there is a wealth of information there which might be of interest to someone one day.\n\nJean Collen – Updated on 25 March 2024\n\nBROADCASTS – 1927 – 1934\n\nA great deal of information in this compilation comes from the Radio Times of the 1920s and 1930s, which is freely available online from the Genome project of the BBC.\n\nWebster Booth took part in BBC broadcasts from 1927 onwards. I will post the broadcasts in sections, as follows: 1927 – 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939.\n\nWebster Booth took part in many BBC broadcasts from 1927 onwards. If he appeared in an extended series I have not listed every broadcast, for example, he appeared in many programmes with Fred Hartley and his Novelty Quintet and with Charles Ernesco and his Quintet so only a few of those broadcasts are recorded here. I will post the broadcasts in several sections, as follows: 1927 – 1935, 1936 to 1939, 1940-1956.\n\nAnne Ziegler made one broadcast under her own name of Irené Eastwood in 1934. She began broadcasting under the name of Anne Ziegler in 1935.\n\nFor some reason, Webster was banned from broadcasting on the BBC from 1932 – 1934 – possibly because of his divorce from Winifred Booth (née Keey) although he was not the guilty party! It was Fred Hartley who brought him back to the BBC in 1934.\n\nWebster in an early recording for HMV.\n\n24th November 1927\n\nDaventry -5 XX – 12.00 The Daventry Quartet; Margaret Minor (Contralto); Webster Booth (Tenor)\n\nLIGHT MUSIC – 5GB Daventry (Experimental), 7 December 1927 18.45\n\nTHE ALFRED CAVE SEXTET; A.
