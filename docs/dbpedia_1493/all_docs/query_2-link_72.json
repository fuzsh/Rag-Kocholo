        "text": "After graduating from college in the 1950s, Graham Jarvis journeyed to New York City to pursue a theater career. Jarvis started picking up television work in the early '60s on such authentic Americana as \"Naked City\" and \"Route 66.\" Film work followed and Jarvis landed small parts in Arthur Penn's \"Alice's Restaurant,\" the community comedy films \"The Out of Towners\" and \"Cold Turkey,\" and the enthralling crime films \"The Organization\" and \"The Hot Rock.\" Jarvis worked a lot on numerous television sitcoms throughout the 1970s as well, including spots on \"The Odd Couple,\" \"M.A.S.H.,\" \"Maude,\" \"Sanford and Son,\" and many others. But it was his role on the soap-opera parody \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" that he was arguably best known for before his final, recurring role as Annie Camden's father on the wholesome family drama \"7th Heaven.\" Cult science-fiction fans may remember Jarvis best from his one-shot guest spots on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and \"The X-Files.\""
