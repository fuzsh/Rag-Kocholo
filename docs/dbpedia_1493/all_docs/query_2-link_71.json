        "text": "Webster Booth’s early career in radio from the 1920s to 1935.\n\nBROADCASTS – 1927 – 1934\n\nA great deal of information in this compilation comes from the Radio Times of the 1920s and 1930s, which is freely available online from the Genome project of the BBC.\n\nWebster Booth took part in BBC broadcasts from 1927 onwards. I will post the broadcasts in sections, as follows: 1927 – 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939.\n\nWebster Booth took part in many BBC broadcasts from 1927 onwards. If he appeared in an extended series I have not listed every broadcast, for example, he appeared in many programmes with Fred Hartley and his Novelty Quintet and with Charles Ernesco and his Quintet so only a few of those broadcasts are recorded here. I will post the broadcasts in several sections, as follows: 1927 – 1935, 1936 to 1939, 1940-1956.\n\nAnne Ziegler made one broadcast under her own name of Irené Eastwood in 1934. She began broadcasting under the name of Anne Ziegler in 1935.\n\nFor some reason, Webster was banned from broadcasting on the BBC from 1932 – 1934 – possibly because of his divorce from Winifred Booth (née Keey) although he was not the guilty party! It was Fred Hartley who brought him back to the BBC in 1934.\n\nWebster in an early recording for HMV.\n\n24th November 1927\n\nDaventry -5 XX – 12.00 The Daventry Quartet; Margaret Minor (Contralto); Webster Booth (Tenor)\n\nLIGHT MUSIC – 5GB Daventry (Experimental), 7 December 1927 18.45\n\nTHE ALFRED CAVE SEXTET; A.
