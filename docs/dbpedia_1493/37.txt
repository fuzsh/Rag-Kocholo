George Moon, Mabel Constanduros, Vernon Harris, Jack Train, Maurice Denham, Dick Francis, Doris Owens, the BBC Variety Orchestra, conducted by Charles Shadwell

With Herr Hitler as Alice, and Field-Marshal Goering as the Duchess, this is surely an Alice in Wonderland, or Blunderland, just as you will.

Among the stars in the cast are two young artists, Maurice Denham and Jack Train, both so versatile that they are likely to make a big name for themselves in the Variety Repertory Company. Though Maurice Denham has a small son of his own, he is a character actor who specialises in small-boy parts. He made his radio debut as recently as February last year, yet he has given over 100 broadcasts. The Rabbit in 'Winnie the Pooh', Reggie Neemo in the Neemo sketches - such opposite parts are down his street. He can sing tenor, bass, contralto, falsetto, and, like Jack Train, can patter in a dozen languages.

This other brilliant young man, who has had a flair for impersonations from a boy, was discovered by the Secretary for War, who saw him performing as an amateur at the Royal Hotel, Devonport. Mr. Hore-Belisha introduced him to Sir Alfred Butt, and, with Jack's talent, the rest was easy. He is now to be regularly on the air from 'Somewhere in England'.
