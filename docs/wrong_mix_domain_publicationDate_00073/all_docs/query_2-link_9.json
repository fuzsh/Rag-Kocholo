        "text": "“HIM feels like the real story at last. Ryman’s uncanny ability to get inside people makes this one of the greatest versions of the old story. The family drama, Yeshua’s parents and siblings—all the key moments seen as if by lightening—it comes alive in a supremely vivid way. This time for real. It’s unforgettable.”\n\n– Kim Stanley Robinson, award winning author of The Mars Trilogy\n\n“Ryman does an impressive job portraying his protagonist’s arduous and complicated existence. Readers willing to have their preconceptions challenged will find much to savor and ponder in this unique work.”\n\n– Publishers Weekly\n\n“Here is the Son of God you never knew. HIM is shocking, moving, profound and reverent. Only Geoff Ryman could have written this book. It is a masterpiece.”\n\n– Michael Swanwick, Nebula award-winning author of Stations of the Tide\n\n“Ryman challenges his readers as he always has, with an enormous, defiant, heart. HIM is exhilarating and liberating to believer and non-believer alike.”\n\n– Paul Cornell, author and screenwriter"
