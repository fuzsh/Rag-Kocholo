        "text": "This is an updated version of a story first published on Oct. 8, 2023. The original video can be viewed here.\n\nThere was a time when futurists were predicting that the advent of 3D printing was going to change our lives.. that each of our houses would have a 3D printer to make whatever items we need. What virtually no one predicted, though, was that there might soon be 3D printers that could construct almost the entire house.\n\nBut, as we first reported last fall, that's just what a 7-year-old Austin, Texas company called Icon is doing.. 3D printing buildings. And if you believe Icon's mission-driven young founder, 3D printing could revolutionize how we build, help create affordable housing, and even allow us, to.. wait for it.. colonize the moon. Sound out of this world? Take a look..\n\nWhat you're watching is the building.. actually, the printing, of a 4-bedroom home. On this construction site, there's no hammering or sawing, just a nozzle squirting out concrete -- kind of like an oversized soft serve ice cream dispenser -- laying down the walls of a house one layer at a time. It's the brainchild of a 41-year-old Texan who's rarely without his cowboy hat, Jason Ballard.\n\nLesley Stahl: 3D printing a house.\n\nJason Ballard: Yes, ma'am.\n\nLesley Stahl: People are gonna hear that and say, \"No.\"\n\nJason Ballard: We're sitting inside one right now.\n\nLesley Stahl: This house was printed?\n\nJason Ballard: Yes, ma'am.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh.\n\nJason Ballard: There you are.\n\nLesley Stahl: Look at this.\n\nJason Ballard: Welcome.\n\nAnd so was this one. Does a concrete home printed by a robot have to look cold and industrial? Maybe not.\n\nLesley Stahl: I like the curved wall.\n\nBallard gave us a peek at the first completed model home in what will soon be the world's first large community of 3D-printed houses – a hundred of them.. part of a huge new development north of Austin. They'll start in the high $400 thousand range. How exactly does 3D printing a house work? Well, it starts with this one-and-a-half-ton sack of dry concrete powder, which gets mixed with water, sand, and additives, and is then pumped to the robotic printer.\n\nConner Jenkins: Now, you are looking at how we control the bead size.\n\nConner Jenkins, Icon's manager of construction here, explained that the printer completes one layer called a \"bead\" every 30 minutes, by which time it's hardened enough to be ready for the next bead. Steel is added every 10th layer for strength.\n\nLesley Stahl: The amount of change you're making is–\n\nConner Jenkins: Tiny.\n\nIt takes about two weeks to print the full 160-bead house. Jenkins gave me the controls.. an iPad.\n\nConner Jenkins: So look, Lesley, that's a little skinny. Will you press the plus 1% real quick?\n\nLesley Stahl: Aren't you worried?\n\nConner Jenkins: Done. You just increased the bead size incrementally.\n\nLesley Stahl: I'd be worried if I were you.\n\nBut turns out the path is entirely pre-programmed. I couldn't mess it up if i tried.\n\nLesley Stahl: Don't tell the people–\n\nConner Jenkins: I think that's the most gorgeous bead I've ever seen. I think this'll be the highest selling house. (laughs)\n\nFor now, as Jason Ballard showed us, Icon is only 3D printing walls, with cutouts for plumbing and electricity. Roofs, windows and insulation are added the old-fashioned way, by construction workers. He calls it a paradigm shift in how we construct our housing.\n\nLesley Stahl: But why do we need a big shift like that?\n\nJason Ballard: 'Cause right now, it is too expensive, it falls over in a hurricane, it burns up in a fire, it gets eaten by termites. The way you try to make it affordable is you trim quality on materials. You trim quality on labor. The result is these cookie cutter developments. And, like, this is not the wor-- like, we are not succeeding at something we have to get right. And on top of that, it's an ecological disaster. And I would certainly say, it is existentially urgent that we shelter ourselves without ruining the planet we have to live on.\n\nJason Ballard: Fire resistant, flood resistant..\n\nBallard showed us a sample of a 3D-printed wall beside a conventionally built one.\n\nLesley Stahl: You say it's faster, more efficient.\n\nJason Ballard: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why do you say that?\n\nJason Ballard: What you've got, let's count the materials. Siding, one. Moisture barrier, two. Sheathing, three. Stud, four. Drywall, five. And then float tape and texture, you can count that either as one or three, but you've got at least half a dozen novel steps that have to take place to deliver an American stick frame wall system. By comparison, we need a single material supply chain, delivered by a robot.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's talk about waste.\n\nJason Ballard: Yes, ma'am.\n\nLesley Stahl: Over here.\n\nJason Ballard: At the end of constructing a home with these materials, there are truckloads, and truckloads of waste left over. These studs are gonna have off-cuts that go into a waste pile. Same with siding, same with drywall.\n\nWhereas with 3D printing, he says, you only print what you need.\n\nJason Ballard: So in short, like if an alien came down to Planet Earth and saw these two ways of building and said, \"From first principles, which is better?\" The alien would go, \"Stronger, faster, termite resistant, fire resistant, like by a mile this is the best way to build.\n\nThough old-school construction workers may disagree. If Ballard sounds a little like a revved-up salesman, or a preacher, there's a reason for that. He grew up in east Texas, a studious, outdoorsy, spiritual kid, first in his family to graduate from college.\n\nLesley Stahl: You were thinking about becoming an Episcopal priest.\n\nJason Ballard: Yeah, I was almost an Episcopal priest. But along the way, I started just, like, getting this, like, itch about housing not being right. So I studied conservation biology. I got involved in sustainable building, and I worked at the local homeless shelter. And so now I'm thinking about homelessness and I'm working in sustainable building. Along the way, my hometown gets destroyed by a hurricane. And I have to go help my family pull drywall outta their house. I-- I feel like–\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, wow.\n\nJason Ballard: --life is just putting housing in front of me, right as I've been, like, approved to go to seminary. And so I go to my bishop, the Bishop of Texas, Andy Doyle. He's still the Bishop of Texas. And-- I said, \"What do I do?\" (laughs) And at the end, he said, \"Jason, I want you to pursue this housing thing like this is your priesthood. This is your vocation. And if it doesn't work out, the church has been here for a long time. We'll still be here.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: But that must've turned the switch for you.\n\nJason Ballard: It did. It made it more than a hobby or a business, right, that it sorta became a mission.\n\nHe began pursuing that mission with Evan Loomis, a buddy from Texas A&M who had gone into finance.\n\nEvan Loomis: As we looked at it, like, nobody had incorporated kinda the holy trinity of innovation to housing which was robotics, advanced materials, and software.\n\nSo in a borrowed warehouse on nights and weekends, and having read everything they could find about the mechanics of 3D printing, they tried to design a 3D printer that could make a building.\n\nLesley Stahl: How big was it?\n\nJason Ballard: It was ten feet, by 10 feet, by 10 feet. So it would've-- it would've printed-- if we had ever gotten it to work, which we did not-- (laughs) it would have printed, like, a 100 square foot, like, demonstration building.\n\nThey didn't get it to work, but enter Alex Le Roux, a recent Baylor engineering graduate, who was tinkering with a similar idea.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you ever actually build anything?\n\nAlex Le Roux: Yeah I did.\n\nLesley Stahl: What was it?\n\nAlex Le Roux: A printed shed. A shed doesn't sound too cool, but it was a big milestone.\n\nJason Ballard: It's a real structure.\n\nAlex Le Roux: Yeah.\n\nThe three co-founded Icon in 2017, and soon got funding to print a small house to unveil at Austin's SXSW festival the following spring. They built a new, larger printer, that worked.\n\nAlex Le Roux: And we got really excited.\n\nBut the kinks hadn't quite been worked out.\n\nAlex Le Roux: So at one point, we ran the printer into the print.\n\nLesley Stahl: Explain that.\n\nJason Ballard: It was supposed to go up, and it went down, and then drove into the house (laughs) and, like, pushed a buncha–\n\nAlex Le Roux: Exactly.\n\nJason Ballard: --layers off.\n\nFunny now, but not so much at the time.\n\nJason Ballard: Some engineers folks who were, like, helping us, sat us down and said, \"Guys, it's been a great effort. But you're not gonna get there. So, like, why don't you guys get some rest?\" And we were basically like, \"Get out of here.\" (laughter) We're like–\n\nEvan Loomis: It's true.\n\nJason Ballard: --\"A--anyone who wants to sh-- to finish this home may stay; everyone else needs to leave.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: And the three of you all agreed on that?\n\nAlex Le Roux: Yeah.\n\nJason Ballard: We knew that we were on to something. And, like, we-- this was, like, our shot. And we weren't gonna miss it.\n\nThey worked round the clock, and made the festival deadline by just hours.\n\nEvan Loomis: Hey Ballard, any words for the victory lap?\n\nJason Ballard: Never, never never never give up.\n\nJason Ballard: I stand by those words. Yeah, sure. (laughs) Never give up.\n\nHe showed us the 350-square-foot finished house.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's a small little house, but it's kind of elegant.\n\nJason Ballard: \"Well, I'll be. That's not so bad.\" I mean I think (laughs) that's kinda how people felt about it–\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\n\nJason Ballard: It was, like, better than they expected. And it was easy to believe, \"Well, they'll get better.\"\n\nThat small little house won Icon a lot of attention.. an innovation award.. investors.. meetings with the military.. and with another Austin innovator -- Alan Graham, who created a village called Community First! that provides small homes to several hundred of the formerly homeless.\n\nAlan Graham: Our goal was really the most despised, outcast, lost and forgotten of our community.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, wow.\n\nAlan Graham: Average time on the streets is nine years. Average age of death is 59.\n\nJason Ballard: It's an absolute miracle out there. And so when we were ready to start building homes, one of the first organizations we reached out to was Alan Graham.\n\nSo Icon 3D printed a welcome center, and then six small houses for village residents. That's how 73-year-old Tim Shea, who battled heroin addiction for decades, in 2020 became the first person in this country to live in a 3D-printed home.\n\nLesley Stahl: Before I saw these houses in my mind, I thought it must be cold. You're shaking 'cause you don't think that.\n\nTim Shea: No. Just the opposite. You feel embraced-- you know, enveloped.\n\nAlan Graham: People that live, that are in the economic strata, the men and women that we serve are gonna be the last people on the planet that are gonna benefit out of new technology. And he wanted to make sure that they were the first.\n\nLesley Stahl: The first person in North America to live in a 3D-printed house was homeless.\n\nTim Shea: Yeah, I-- isn't that somethin'?\n\nThe years since have seen tremendous growth for Icon: a new factory to build more printers, and improve the quality of its concrete and a facility called 'Printland' to experiment with new designs. Icon has printed small homes in rural Mexico, vehicle hide structures for the Marine Corps, huge barracks for the Army and Air Force and a deluxe showcase home featuring wavy walls and curves that would be prohibitively expensive if built traditionally, but not when programmed into a 3D printer.\n\nLesley Stahl: So in your minds, is your customer a homeless person? Or is your customer me?\n\nJason Ballard: There's a trick here because what our heart wants to do is to serve the very poor. And it's often been, like, confusing for people to understand. It's like, \"I thought you guys were helping homelessness. Why are you building that fancy house?\"\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\n\nJason Ballard: I would resign if I was only allowed to build luxury homes. And we would go bankrupt right now if all we built was 3% margin homes for homeless people. But once this technology arrives in its full force-- I think it fundamentally transforms the way we build.\n\nIt has been a staple of science fiction forever — humans living and working on the moon. But for NASA, that dream is almost within reach. Their new Artemis program plans to return American astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years — this time, not just to visit, but eventually to stay and even use the moon as a base for exploring Mars and beyond. But staying on the moon requires infrastructure — landing pads, roads, housing — and you can't exactly bring two-by-fours and sheetrock on a spacecraft. That's where 3D printing comes in. NASA is partnering with Jason Ballard's company Icon to pioneer 3D printing on the moon.\n\nIn late 2022, NASA launched the first in a series of Artemis missions. The next, with crew on board, is now scheduled for late 2025. And by the end of the decade, an Icon printer is supposed to fly to the moon to test print part of a landing pad. Jason Ballard, who once applied to be an astronaut but was rejected, can't wait.\n\nJason Ballard: If the schedule holds, or even approximately holds, the first object ever built on another world will be built with Icon hardware.\n\nLesley Stahl: He wants Icon to be the first company to make something on another world.\n\nCorky Clinton: So do we.\n\nAt Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, NASA scientists Jennifer Edmunson and Corky Clinton run a program called Impact.. spelled M-M-P-A-C-T.\n\nCorky Clinton: Moon to Mars Planetary Autonomous Construction Technologies.\n\nLesley Stahl: Whoa. You people at NASA, you come up with these very, very (laughs) long names.\n\nCorky Clinton: That's why we call it MMPACT. (laughs)\n\nThe key word there is autonomous.\n\nCorky Clinton: We want to be able to make structures that we need without having to be tended by astronauts.\n\nJennifer Edmunson: If you're gonna have a truly sustainable presence on the lunar surface, you have to be as Earth-independent as possible.\n\nNASA was interested in 3D printing, having looked at an early version almost 20 years ago. So when they heard about the progress Icon had made with their first houses in Austin, Corky Clinton traveled there to take a look.\n\nCorky Clinton: Being an engineer, I spent a lot of my time going around and looking at the size of the beads and how they went around the corners, and I'll tell ya, I was really impressed with what they had accomplished.\n\nImpressed enough that NASA gave Icon development money in 2020, and then, two years later, a $57 million contract.\n\nJason Ballard: Welcome to Spacelab, Lesley. This is where we figure out how to build on other worlds.\n\nBallard and Evan Jensen, who leads the project, explained the fundamental challenge.\n\nJason Ballard: To bring an object roughly this size from Earth to the moon's surface would be $1 million.\n\nAnd think about--\n\nLesley Stahl: What-- wait, that size would be $1 million–\n\nJason Ballard: Correct. With current technology, this would take about $1 million to deliver to the lunar surface. And think of how many sort of brick-sized things we would need to do launch pad, landing pads, roads, habitats, We'll never have a moon base if we're gonna bring everything with us. So it was okay during the Apollo program to bring things with us. 'Cause we weren't staying, we were coming home. If we want to stay, we have to learn to live off the land.\n\nLesley Stahl: You have to learn to build it there and use the material–\n\nJason Ballard: Correct. Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: --from there.\n\nJason Ballard: That's right.\n\nBut that's no easy feat. It means using what's called lunar regolith, which covers the moon's surface, rather than concrete and water, as a building material.\n\nJennifer Edmunson: Regolith is made up of rock that has been pummeled over billions of years from asteroids, comets and things.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it like sand?\n\nJennifer Edmunson: It's actually finer than sand.\n\nIcon has a big tub full of simulated moon regolith, and they have invented and built a robotic system to 3D print with it.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're gonna build all those roads and buildings out of this?\n\nEvan Jensen: That's correct. The robots will.\n\nJason Ballard: This is actually the mission that we are scheduled to fly.\n\nAs he pointed out in this rendering…\n\nJason Ballard: Our robotic arm with our laser system..\n\nThey've created a whole new way to 3D print -- with lasers. Instead of a nozzle squirting out soft concrete, a high-intensity laser beam will melt the powdery regolith, to transform it into a hard, strong, building material. they're running experiments now, using the laser to create a small sample.\n\nJason Ballard: Once that red light is on, we're hot.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh.\n\nJason Ballard: Lots of power.\n\nMartyn Staalsen: Here we go.\n\nJason Ballard: Here we go.\n\nWe watched on monitors as the arm got into position.\n\nMartyn Staalsen: There's the laser.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh. That white thing is the laser.\n\nEvan Jensen: So it's melting right now-- It's going up to, say, 1,500 degrees Celsius.\n\nJason Ballard: It's gonna complete its second pass. You can see it emerging there. See the dark object on the screen? That's the object we just made with the laser.\n\nThey can add more regolith and laser again and again to build in layers to go as high as they want, which will be done remotely from earth. It takes hours to cool, so they showed me a sample they'd made days earlier.\n\nLesley Stahl: This is pretty darn hard.\n\nEvan Jensen: That's our landing pad. You're holding it.\n\nLesley Stahl: I'm holding the landing pad?\n\nJason Ballard: That's exactly right.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's pretty cool. That's a scientific term.\n\nIcon sends them to NASA, where they're blasted with this special plasma torch..\n\nCorky Clinton: The torch will be about 4,000 degrees\n\nTo see if they can take the heat a landing pad would have to withstand.\n\nCorky Clinton: See there.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, there it is.\n\nThe torch is so bright, you have to watch on a monitor.\n\nCorky Clinton: That was it.\n\nA few minutes later, out it came.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh. It's just a little bit warm.\n\nCorky Clinton: It looks good to me. I don't see any loss of material. I don't see any cratering.\n\nLesley Stahl: It survived the test?\n\nCorky Clinton: Passed the test with flying colors.\n\nThe next test will be operating the entire robotic arm and laser..\n\nCorky Clinton: We'll put in a large-scale simulant bed.\n\nInside NASA's giant thermal vacuum chamber, which mimics the moon's extreme cold, heat, and vacuum conditions.\n\nJason Ballard: This is sort of like--\n\nBallard's idea is to eventually send mobile 3D printers to the moon..\n\nJason Ballard: So this moves the printer around..\n\nWith a longer robotic arm sticking out of the top to print whatever is needed.\n\nJason Ballard: And then they would build the road and then they would build those habitats. Right?\n\nAnd it wouldn't stop there.\n\nJason Ballard: If we can do it on the moon, we can do it on Mars. The moon is actually harder.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's harder?\n\nJason Ballard: Mars is almost in every way easier, except for it's so far away.\n\nEasier, they agree, because for one thing, Mars doesn't have extreme temperature swings.\n\nLesley Stahl: Still, in my mind, it's science fiction. But in your minds, it's absolutely in the palm of your hand. It's going to happen.\n\nJennifer Edmunson: We can see the steps and the technology to get us there.\n\nLesley Stahl: Now, that's thrilling.\n\nCorky Clinton: It's exciting.\n\nJason Ballard: Quality can't go backwards in Block 4.\n\nIcon says trying to 3D print on the moon and Mars is helping with their work here on Earth. They are formulating new mixes to reduce the carbon footprint of their concrete.\n\nAlex Le Roux: We think we will be there by end of year.\n\nAnd they're trying out more radical architecture..\n\nJason Ballard: Quite complex shapes and geometries. Almost looks like ripples on the surface of water.\n\nPatterned walls..\n\nLesley Stahl: Look at that–\n\nJason Ballard: --so this is-- this is-- a thing that a customer ended up really liking.\n\nDramatic flairs...as with this performing arts pavilion in Austin.\n\nWoman: Watch your step.\n\nAnd they're working on test printing domes.\n\nJason Ballard: There's something about arches, domes, and vaults that, like, lift the human spirit. But they're typically too expensive. In fact, they're so expensive, you usually only see them in, like, civic buildings or religious buildings.\n\nLesley Stahl: Domes? Oh, yeah–\n\nJason Ballard: Domes, arches–\n\nLesley Stahl: Churches.\n\nJason Ballard: --vaults. I see the face you're making. Every human being loves being in one of those buildings–\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, of course. They're gorgeous.\n\nJason Ballard: What if having those was available to everyone, and it was faster and cheaper than the kinda roofs we have today?\n\nAnd this year, as in these renderings, they'll be printing round hotel rooms in Marfa, Texas...\n\nLesley Stahl: These are rooms–\n\nJason Ballard: Yes, ma'am.\n\nLesley Stahl: --that you would stay in--?\n\nJason Ballard: That's correct. And so, like, here's one.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh.\n\nJason Ballard: That sort of curve sort of continues down through the roof into the room itself and sort of creates a stairway onto a bed platform.\n\nAnd they'll also be printing futuristic-looking designer homes.\n\nJason Ballard: You see a bedroom on that end with a shower and a bedroom here. And here's some renderings of the interior.\n\nLesley Stahl: Wow.\n\nJason Ballard: Right? It gets you goin', doesn't it?\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think it'll ever be possible to print out, like, a 20-story apartment building, -- or even-- a skyscraper?\n\nJason Ballard: Oh, yes. In fact the architecture for our next generation of printer will be, like, more or less prepared for that.\n\nJason Ballard: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to formally introduce you to the next generation print system Phoenix.\n\nJust this spring at Austin's South by Southwest festival, Ballard unveiled the \"next generation\" of printer.. called Phoenix..\n\nJason Ballard: And by a mile, this is the most sophisticated and challenging engineering we have ever attempted. This is like our version of landing rockets.\n\nIt's a robot with a single, 75-foot-long arm, similar in design to the one Icon is developing for the moon, which they say enables printing multiple-story buildings, allows for greater flexibility, and can print faster than their current printers, which will still be busy. In another partnership with Alan Graham, Icon is breaking ground on 100 more 3D printed homes for the formerly homeless at Community First Village.\n\nLesley Stahl: A lot of what he's doing here is good for PR. So how much is genuine, and how much is just doing things to promote his business?\n\nAlan Graham: Well, I think 100% is genuine. And I think 100% is-- promoting his business. He believes that they are on the cusp of technology that's gonna have a dramatic impact-- on the world. Otherwise, I don't think he'd be doing it.\n\nJason Ballard: You have to remember, there's a tremendous amount of human suffering every year, and every five years, and every decade that goes by where we're not getting shelter right. There are over a billion under-sheltered people, which means if we built a million homes a year, it would take 1,000 years. That is 950 years too long.\n\nJason Ballard: This is one of the most foundational things that we have to get right, or the future cannot be exciting. L--like, forget all the other stuff. You might--get flying cars-- (laugh) w-- the future cannot be exciting if we don't get human shelter--right.\n\nLesley Stahl: We're living at time, right now, where a lot of CEOs have been caught over-promising, hyping.\n\nJason Ballard: Mm-hm.\n\nLesley Stahl: I'm thinking of Theranos.\n\nJason Ballard: You're absolutely right. And it-- and it-- it's-- it's-- it's a tougher thing than you know. Because part of the job is to get your investors, get your team, and in our case the world-- to believe the things you are saying. Except the things you are saying don't exist yet.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah. Oh, boy–\n\nJason Ballard: You-- you need to get them to believe.. So it's hard to know-- like, even in this interview, I actually haven't yet told you all the things I believe we're going to do, 'cause I'm, like, measuring myself.\n\nLesley Stahl: Give us one example. (laughs) Something wild.\n\nJason Ballard: I mean, in the future, I think most buildings will be designed by AI, most projects will be run by software, and almost everything will be built by robots. And I don't think that's that far away.\n\nLesley Stahl: I at my age find that very depressing--\n\nJason Ballard: Haa–\n\nLesley Stahl: --but I'm sure young people don't–\n\nJason Ballard: --well, lemme-- yeah, no, no. That world, housing will be more abundant, more affordable, more beautiful. It will make this version of housing look depressing by example.\n\nLesley Stahl: You know that expression, \"If it seems too good to be true, it is?\"\n\nJason Ballard: Or-- I do know that expression. But cars, and airplanes, and moon landings seemed too good to be true for a moment as well. And so, like maybe the only proof I can give you is, like, I'm betting my life on it. Like, I have this one precious life to live, and I'm using it to do this. And if I could think of a better way, I'd be doing that instead, or I'd go fishing. Like, this is so hard. (laughs)\n\nLesley Stahl: And you like fishing.\n\nJason Ballard: I love fishing."
