You must always be prepared for the possibility that you will need to stop, swerve, speed up or slow down to avoid a collision. That means you need to have your full attention on the road and always be fit to drive.\n\nYour life, your passengersâ lives and the lives of other motorists, cyclists and pedestrians depend on your ability to drive safely. If you are impaired by drugs or alcohol, or if youâre texting or paying attention to anything other than your driving, you are putting lives at risk.\n\nDevastating and deadly accidents are all too common, and often caused by someone who is breaking the law. What you donât hear as much about are all the crashes that are avoided by drivers who are alert, sober, responsive and who follow the rules of the road.\n\nThe Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles was established in 1905 out of concern for public safety as the age of the automobile began. Today, itâs hard to imagine the dangers of that time when there were more horses than cars on the roadways. For more than 100 years, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) has been dedicated to our mission to promote safety on Maineâs roadways by qualifying and licensing drivers, along with maintaining records of driver history, vehicle ownership and vehicle registration. This manual is designed to prepare you with the knowledge and skills you need to operate a motor vehicle safely and obtain a driverâs license.\n\nEarning your driverâs license is only the beginning, though. Please remember that the skills, behaviors and rules of the road you are learning today are more than just the answers to a test. Safe driving is a life-long commitment and one that you must reaffirm every time you get behind the wheel.\n\nAs you take your first steps toward earning your license to operate a motor vehicle, I encourage you to promise yourself that you will be fit to drive every time you get behind the wheel. We wish you success in earning your driverâs license, and enjoyment of all the freedom and opportunities that it will bring in your lifetime.\n\nDepartment of the Secretary of State\n\nBureau of Motor Vehicles\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I: Maine Driver's License\n\nAcquiring A Maine Driver's License\n\nInformation About Your Driver's License\n\nMaintaining Your Driver's License\n\nPractice Questions\n\nPart II: Owning and Maintaining A MotorVehicle\n\nTitling Your Motor Vehicle\n\nRegistering Your Motor Vehicle\n\nInsuring Your Motor Vehicle\n\nInspecting Your Motor Vehicle\n\nMaintaining Your Motor Vehicle\n\nPractice Questions\n\nPart III: Keeping Fit to Drive\n\nAlcohol and Other Drugs\n\nVision and Hearing\n\nDriver Fatigue\n\nYour Health\n\nPractice Questions\n\nPart IV: Operating A MotorVehicle\n\nRules of the Road\n\nSeeing Well While Driving\n\nCommunicating With Others\n\nDistractions\n\nMaintaining a Safe Cushion\n\nSharing the Road With Bicycles\n\nSharing Space With Other Road Users\n\nExpressway Driving\n\nConservation\n\nPractice Questions\n\nPart V: Handling Emergencies\n\nSafety Belts\n\nHazardous Driving Conditions\n\nAvoiding Collisions\n\nAccidents\n\nEmergency First Aid\n\nHandling Other Automobile Emergencies\n\nSharing the Road With Large Vehicles\n\nPractice Questions\n\nPart VI: Motorcycles or Mopeds\n\nDefining A Motorcycle or Mopeds\n\nMotorcycle Requirements\n\nAppendix A\n\nThe information in this manual is as accurate as possible at the time of publication, but is subject to change. This manual is intended to provide basic information and cannot possibly cover every traffic law or situation. If you have a question about the information supplied in this manual or a situation not covered, consult your local Motor Vehicle office, or write to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, 29 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333.\n\nSocial Security Number Disclosure Statement\n\nThis statement is made in accordance with the Federal Privacy Act of 1974, Section 7(b). Disclosure of your social security number is mandatory and is required by 29-A MRSA ,1301(5) and (6) to apply for or renew a driver's license or nondriver identification card. Your social security number will be used solely for identification purposes and will be kept confidential.\n\nPart I\n\nMaine Driver's License\n\nDriving a motor vehicle on public highways in Maine is a privilege and a serious responsibility.\n\nThe ability to drive a car, truck or motorcycle widens your horizons. It helps you do your job, visit friends and relatives and enjoy your leisure time.\n\nA motor vehicle used unwisely or carelessly, can be fatal. More than 30,000 people die each year in the United States because of motor vehicle accidents. To obtain your driver's license you must know the rules of the road and how to safely drive a car or other vehicle in traffic. But becoming a safe, intelligent driver takes time and effort, and the process really only begins when you get your license.\n\nMaine has over 1,000,000 licensed drivers.\n\nAcquiring a Maine Driver's License\n\nWho Needs a Maine Driver's License?\n\nAny resident of the State who wishes to operate a motor vehicle in Maine. New residents who hold a valid driver's license from another state must surrender that license and apply for a Maine driver's license within 30 days of establishing residency.\n\nWho Does Not Need a Maine Driver's License to Operate a Motor Vehicle in Maine?\n\nAny resident who has a valid learner's permit may drive as long as they are accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least 20 years of age and has held a valid license for 2 years. The licensed driver must occupy the seat adjacent to the driver with the learner's permit.\n\nAny non-resident who is at least 16 years of age and who has a valid operator's license or learner's permit issued by his or her home state.\n\nAny military personnel possessing a valid military license operating a military vehicle.\n\nHow Do You Obtain A Permit in Maine?\n\nYou must be at least 15 years of age.\n\nIf under 18 years of age, complete an approved driver education course.\n\nObtain a learner's permit by successfully completing a driver knowledge examination. A learner's permit is generally valid for 2 years. It allows a person to operate a vehicle when accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least 20 years of age and has held a valid license for 2 years. The accompanying operator must be licensed to drive the class of vehicle(s) being operated.\n\nUse of mobile telephone or handheld electronic devices prohibited on learner's permit.\n\nWritten exams and visual screenings are offered on a scheduled basis at all Motor Vehicle branch offices. Two forms of identification are required. Example; birth certificate and social security card. Although your social security number will not be displayed on your license, it must be provided upon application or renewal for a license. Birth certificates or Passports are required of applicants up to and including age 22 to determine date of birth. Photocopies of birth certificates must have an embossed seal or stamp of an issuing agency. Notarized copies are not acceptable.\n\nHow Do You Obtain A Driver's License?\n\nBe at least 16 years of age and have completed an approved driver education course.\n\nBe at least 18 years of age if you have not completed an approved driver education course.\n\nBefore a person under 21 years of age can apply for a road test, that person must have held a learner's permit for 6 months from the date of issue of the learner's permit and must complete a minimum of 70 hours of driving, including 10 hours of night driving, while accompanied by a licensed driver at least 20 years of age and held a valid license for 2 years. The 70 hours of practice driving must begin after issuance of the permit. The parent, stepparent, guardian or spouse must certify the person's driving time on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State. When the person has no parent, stepparent, guardian or spouse, an employer may certify the driving time.\n\nSuccessfully complete a road test. When ready to take the road test, mail the road test request card that has been given or mailed to you to the Motor Vehicles main office in Augusta and you will be scheduled at a testing location nearest to you. Bring your learners permit and appointment notice with you. Drivers must furnish their own vehicle, properly registered (bring registration) and inspected, for the road test. You must be accompanied by a licensed operator who is in possession of a valid driver's license. During the winter months, it is possible that weather conditions could cause the cancellation of your scheduled exam. Applicants scheduled for a road test on a day experiencing snow and/or icy conditions can elect to be rescheduled at no fee. Applicants selecting this option can call (207) 624-9000, ext. 52119.\n\nA person under 18 years of age who has been issued a driver's license may not: operate a motor vehicle while using a mobile telephone; operate a motor vehicle between the hours of 12 a.m. and 5 a.m.; carry passengers other than immediate family members unless accompanied by a licensed operator who has held a valid license for 2 years, is at least 20 years of age, is occupying a seat beside the driver and is licensed to operate the class of vehicle operated by the driver. Immediate family member means grandparent, stepgrandparent, parent, stepparent, brother, stepbrother, sister, stepsister, child, stepchild, spouse, analogous family members as may be connected via the operation of a family foster home and when living with the immediate family, foreign exchange students, court appointed wards of an immediate family member and a child whose parent is deployed for military service and is under the guardianship of an immediate family member.\n\nThese restrictions are in effect for a period of 270 days from passing the road test. Violation of the conditions of these restrictions will result in a license suspension and a 270 day extension of the restrictions which may extend beyond the 18th birthday.\n\nThe first license issued to a new applicant under 21 years of age is provisional for a period of two years and one year for persons at least 21 years old. If a person is convicted of a moving violation that occurred while operating with a provisional license, the license will be suspended for 30 days. Second and third offenses involve more severe penalties.\n\nWhat Will the Tests Include?\n\nThe written test measures your understanding and knowledge of traffic laws, regulations, driving skills and vehicle handling, as well as your ability to identify and understand highway signs. Special emphasis is placed on understanding Maine's drinking and driving laws.\n\nThe vision screening will measure your visual acuity (how clearly you see) and your peripheral vision (how far you can see to either side while looking straight ahead).\n\nDuring the road test, the license examiner will assess your ability to maintain control of your vehicle at all times, whether it be driving forward or backward, maintaining your proper lane position, turning left or right or driving straight ahead. You will also be evaluated on how well you observe and react to other road users and pedestrians, as well as traffic signs, signals and conditions. You will not be asked to do anything that is extraordinary or illegal.\n\nNote: The road test will not be given until all other tests have been successfully completed.\n\nWho Must Take the Examinations?\n\nThose applying for an initial license must take all examinations.\n\nAnyone changing their license classification must take all examinations. Special tests are administered for those wishing to operate a motorcycle, bus or school bus. Additional endorsements may be added to a license following the successful completion of all pertinent written and vision tests.\n\nApplicants with a valid out-of-state license may have the written and road tests waived.\n\nMessage For Those Transferring their Out-of-State License to a Maine\n\nNon-Commercial Driver's License\n\nYou must be at least 16 years of age to apply for a Maine license.\n\nIf you are 16 or 17 and hold a valid out-of-state license, you may be required to provide evidence of completion of an approved driver education course prior to the issuance of a Maine license.\n\nAny out-of-state license must be surrendered at the time of issuance of the Maine license.\n\nYou will need to apply for a Commercial Driver's License if you expect to operate:\n\nA combination of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds, if the gross vehicle weight rating or gross weight of the vehicles being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\nA single motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds or such a vehicle towing a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating or gross weight not in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\nA vehicle carrying hazardous materials in a quantity requiring placarding by Federal DOT regulation.\n\nA vehicle designed to carry over 15 passengers including the driver.\n\nA written test is not required if you are applying for a passenger car license.\n\nAny misstatement on the license application will result in the immediate revocation of your license and your privilege to operate in the State of Maine. Furthermore, court action may be taken against you for any misstatement.\n\nThe Secretary of State shall not accept the application of any minor under the age of 18 years for an operator's license or instruction permit unless signed by a parent or legal guardian having custody of the minor or by the spouse of the minor provided the spouse is of the age of 18 years or older. Any person who has signed the application of a minor for an operator's application or learner's permit may thereafter file with the department a notarized written request that the license or learner's permit of said minor, so granted, be suspended.\n\nYou are responsible for abiding by the Maine Motor Vehicle Laws and must become familiar with the Maine Motorist Handbook and Study Guide.\n\nInformation About Your Driver's License\n\nWhen you have passed the required tests, you may purchase a picture license which is valid until your sixth birthday following the date of issue of the license or your fourth birthday following the date of issue of the license if you are age 65 or older. You must show proof of lawful presence and legal residency at the time of photo license processing. If you are under 18 years of age, you must bring a parent or legal guardian with you to sign for the issuance of your picture license, which will be mailed to you after processing. You should carry your license with you when driving. You must show your license to any police officer who asks to see it. It is illegal to lend your license to anyone else.\n\nLicense Classification , Type of Vehicles\n\nThere are 3 classes of driver's licenses in Maine.\n\nClasses A and B: Class A and B licenses are commercial vehicle licenses and are distinguished by the size and weight of the vehicle to be driven. A Class A license covers any combination of vehicles with a gross combination weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds, provided the gross vehicle weight rating or gross weight of the vehicle or vehicles being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Class B covers any single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or gross weight. Holders of a Class A or B license may, with any appropriate endorsements, operate all vehicles in Classes B and C.\n\nClass C: Class C is the standard license classification issued to most motor vehicle operators. A Class C license covers any single vehicle or combination of vehicles that does not meet the definition of Class A or B. A Class C license is a commercial driver's license only if it carries a hazardous material, tanker and/or passenger (bus) endorsement. Holders of Class C license may, with any appropriate endorsements, operate all vehicles in that class.\n\nSeparate study manuals are available to use for study purposes when applying for a commercial driver's license or motorcycle endorsement.\n\nSchool buses, passenger buses and motorcycles are not a separate class, but their use requires a special endorsement and an examination for the specific vehicle.\n\nNOTE: School bus license applicants must be 21 years of age or older and have at least one year of licensed driving experience. Additionally, any individual convicted of an O.U.I. offense within the preceding ten-year period is ineligible to receive a school bus operator's license.\n\nMopeds may be operated on a license of any class. A motorized bicycle or tricycle may only be operated by a person who possesses a valid license of any class, a learner's permit or license endorsed for a motorcycle or moped.\n\nAltering a License: Changing information on a driver's license carries severe penalties, including loss of license.\n\nLost License: If your license is lost or destroyed, you must notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to apply for a duplicate copy. Once notified, the Bureau will forward the information and material needed to process a duplicate license.\n\nRenewing Your Driver's License: About 45 days before a driver's license expires, a renewal notice is mailed to the driver's most recent address on file at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. If you do not notify us of any address change, you may not receive a renewal notice. You must contact our central office in Augusta and renew your license on time. It is unlawful to drive a motor vehicle with an expired license.\n\nChange of Name or Address: If your name or address changes from that given on your license, Maine law requires that you notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles within 30 days of change.\n\nMaintaining Your Driver's License\n\nRemember, having a driver's license is a privilege that can be taken away from you at any time you drive inappropriately.\n\nSecretary of State's Authority\n\nThe Secretary of State has the authority to impose restrictions on your driver's license when it appears necessary. One of the more common restrictions is the requirement that a licensee who has corrective lenses must wear them while driving. Restrictions apply also as to time of day and location of use. Driving in violation of any restrictions is unlawful.\n\nThe Secretary of State may require you to appear for a license examination or hearing at any time, even after you have been issued a driver's license. The Secretary may also require you to furnish a statement from your doctor regarding your physical or mental condition.\n\nThe Secretary of State is authorized to suspend your license upon receipt of a written adverse report of your driving from a law enforcement officer or other member of the public.\n\nSuspension of a Minor's License or Permit\n\nAny person who has signed the application of a minor for an operator's license or\n\ninstruction permit can, thereafter, file, with the Secretary of State, a notarized written re- quest asking that the minor's license or instruction permit be suspended.\n\nLicense Penalties and Suspension\n\nThe Secretary of State and the courts have a great deal of authority in suspending your operator's license. Driving is a privilege, and only those who prove themselves to be safe may retain that privilege.\n\nYour Driver's License May Be Taken Away by Revocation or Suspension\n\nRevocation: While rarely used, it means that your license and driving privilege is formally terminated and you would have to apply for a new license at the end of the revocation period.\n\nTypical offenses requiring revocation are:\n\nVehicular Manslaughter. Revocation for at least 5 years. If alcohol is involved revocation is permanent.\n\nHabitual Offender. Revocation for at least one year.\n\nSuspension: Suspensions temporarily withdraw driving privileges. A person whose license has been suspended will not be allowed to drive until a written notice of reinstatement is received.\n\nTypical offenses requiring suspension are:\n\nFailure to file required insurance.\n\nFailure to appear in court for a traffic citation.\n\nOperating Under the Influence (O.U.I.).\n\nAdministrative License Suspension.\n\nAdministrative License Suspension\n\nThe most commonly known tool for the control of driver behavior in Maine are rules for administrative license suspension relating to demerit point accumulation, convictions and adjudications.\n\nSuspension Periods for Designated Convictions\n\nThe license or privilege to operate of any person convicted of eluding a police officer, passing a roadblock or street racing may be suspended for a period of up to 90 days.\n\nAny person who is convicted of operating after suspension may have their license suspended for a period of 60 days.\n\nPersons convicted of the following offenses may have their licenses suspended for a period of 30 days:\n\nFailure to stop for a police officer\n\nLeaving the scene of an accident (bodily injury)\n\nOperating alone on a permit\n\nOperating without a license (criminal offense)\n\nPassing a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing\n\nSpeeding by 30 miles per hour or more over the speed limit\n\nAltering a license or registration certificate\n\nLoaning a license\n\nUnlawful use of license\n\nDisplaying suspended license\n\nFalsifying an application for registration or license\n\nGiving false information to a police officer\n\nUsing False Identification to Obtain Liquor\n\nThis law requires a court to suspend the driver's license of a person, under 21 years of age, who is adjudicated of the offense of using false or fraudulent credentials to obtain liquor or gain entrance into a drinking establishment. The court is given discretionary authority to suspend the license for 30 days for a first offense and is required to suspend the license for 90 days for a second offense and one year for any subsequent offense. The Secretary of State is obligated to impose the suspension for second and subsequent offenses. The offense will carry six demerit points\n\nSuspension for Demerit Point Accumulation: The Maine Point System\n\nBy law, the Secretary of State is required to adopt rules establishing a uniform system of assigning demerit points for persons convicted of certain motor vehicle traffic offenses.\n\nOnce certain point levels are reached (currently 6 points), a warning is issued by the Secretary of State, and if the point total reaches 12 points or more the driver's license will be suspended. Points will be erased from a driver's record when they become one year old.\n\nWhen a suspension occurs, a driver is entitled to a hearing by the Secretary of State's office. The hearing examiner may continue, modify, or rescind the earlier action taken. The person under suspension may be represented by an attorney at any hearing and the hearing decision may be appealed to Superior Court.\n\nPoint Schedule\n\nConvictions and Adjudications Demerit Points\n\nConviction\n\nDemerit Points\n\nConviction\n\nDemerit Point\n\nDriving Wrong Side\n\n6\n\nDriving Wrong Way\n\n6\n\nExceeding Posted Speed by at Least 15 Miles Per Hour But Less Than 30 Miles Per Hour\n\n6\n\nIllegal Transportation, Possession or Consumption of Liquor In a Motor Vehicle by a Minor\n\n6\n\nIllegal Transportation of Drugs in a Motor Vehicle by a Minor\n\n6\n\nImproper Passing\n\n6\n\nLeaving the Scene of an Accident (Property Damage)\n\n6\n\nOperating Beyond Restriction\n\n6\n\nOperating With Improper License\n\n6\n\nOperating Without Corrective Lenses\n\n6\n\nOperating Left on Curve\n\n6\n\nOther Improper Pass\n\n6\n\nPass Within 100 Feet of Intersection\n\n6\n\nPass on Curve or Hill\n\n6\n\nPass on Right\n\n6\n\nPass on Wrong Side\n\n6\n\nUsing False ID to Obtain Liquor\n\n6\n\nViolation-Do Not Pass\n\n6\n\nViolation of Instruction Permit\n\n6\n\nOperating Motorcycle Beyond Restriction\n\n6\n\nExceeding Posted Speed by Less Than 15 Miles Per Hour\n\n4\n\nExcessive Acceleration\n\n4\n\nFailure to Keep Right\n\n4\n\nFailure to Return to the Right\n\n4\n\nFailure to Yield to Emergency Vehicle\n\n4\n\nFailure to Yield , No Sign\n\n4\n\nFailure to Yield to Pedestrian\n\n4\n\nFailure to Yield , Sign\n\n4\n\nFailure to Give Way to Other Vehicle\n\n4\n\nFailure to Obey Stop Sign\n\n4\n\nFailure to Stop at Red Light\n\n4\n\nFailure to Yield Right of Way\n\n4\n\nImprudent Driving\n\n4\n\nOperating a Motor Vehicle With Obstructed View\n\n4\n\nOperating Without a License (traffic infraction)\n\n4\n\nRed Light Violation\n\n4\n\nCrossover Violation\n\n2\n\nDisplaying a Blue Light\n\n2\n\nDisplaying a Red Light\n\n2\n\nFailure to Dim Headlights\n\n2\n\nFailure to Signal\n\n2\n\nFailure to Obey Traffic Island\n\n2\n\nFailure to Reduce Speed on a Grade or Curve\n\n2\n\nFollow Too Close\n\n2\n\nIllegal Left Turn\n\n2\n\nIllegal Right Turn\n\n2\n\nIllegal U-Turn\n\n2\n\nImpeding the Flow of Traffic\n\n2\n\nImproper Turn\n\n2\n\nLane Conviction\n\n2\n\nLittering\n\n2\n\nObstructing the Flow of Traffic\n\n2\n\nObstructing Traffic\n\n2\n\nOperating Motor Vehicle Without Tail Lights\n\n2\n\nOperating Without Lights\n\n2\n\nOther Moving Violations\n\n2\n\nSpeed Under Posted Minimum\n\n2\n\nSquealing Tires\n\n2\n\nTrailer Without Lights\n\n2\n\nTrucks Traveling Less Than 150 Feet Apart\n\n2\n\nEluding Police Officer\n\nEluding a police officer is a serious offense. Anyone, after being requested or signaled to stop, who attempts to elude a law enforcement officer by driving a vehicle at a reckless rate of speed, resulting in a high-speed chase between the operator's vehicle and any law enforcement vehicle using a blue light and siren, is guilty of a Class C crime. If any person suffers any serious bodily injury as a result of the operator's attempt to elude a law enforcement officer, that operator commits a Class B crime.\n\nLeaving the Scene of an Accident\n\nIncrease in classification for the offense of leaving the scene of a bodily injury accident from a Class D to a Class C crime, if the accident resulted in serious bodily injury or death and the person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly failed to stop at the scene of the accident.\n\nViolation Free Credit\n\nThe violation free credit system awards one point for each calendar year free of convictions or suspensions. One is permitted to accumulate up to four violation free credit points.\n\nContinuing Driver Education\n\nThe Maine Driving Dynamics Course is an approved five-hour program designed to increase knowledge of driving hazards and the techniques to avoid these hazards. The focus is on the prevention of collisions despite adverse conditions and unsafe actions of other drivers. The course also emphasizes the dangers associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs in association with driving.\n\nSuccessful completion of a Maine Driving Dynamics Course or other approved driver improvement course will deduct three points from a driver's point total. Anyone may, even with no record, receive credit for successful completion of this course, but points will be deducted only once in any twelve month period.\n\nCourses are conducted by trained instructors whenever and wherever there is sufficient demand. The courses are often part of the local adult and continuing education program. For further information please call the Bureau of Highway Safety at (207)626-3840. The fee for the Maine Driving Dynamics course is $40.00.\n\n120 Day Suspension\n\nAny person whose license has been suspended three times within a three-year period by the Secretary of State or by a court may be subject to a further suspension for a period up to\n\n120 days.\n\nMandatory Suspensions\n\nIn addition to the discretionary powers of the Secretary of State, there are certain violations which require total mandatory suspension-no exceptions, no \"work\" license. A few are listed below (for the full list, refer to M.R.S.A. Title 29-A).\n\nFailure to answer to a motor vehicle summons to court. Whenever a person fails to appear in court on the day specified, or fails to pay any related fine, the license will be suspended until the appearance is made or the fine is paid.\n\nThis is one of the most common reasons for suspension. Fines must be paid.\n\nOperating under the influence, blood level 0.08% or over, or refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test require mandatory suspensions of varying terms (see Chapter on Alcohol).\n\nDriving to Endanger: Suspension for at least 30 days\n\nIllegal transportation, possession or consumption of liquor by a minor in a motor vehicle: Suspension for at least 30 days.\n\nIllegal transportation of drugs by a minor in a motor vehicle: Suspension for at least 30 days.\n\nIf you are responsible for accident damage and do not have liability insurance, license and registration must be suspended until proof of insurance is filed with the Secretary of State.\n\nRevocation of a driver's license for certain crimes\n\nThis law requires the Secretary of State to revoke indefinitely the driver's licenses of individuals convicted of designated criminal offenses when the individuals used a motor vehicle to commit the offense and the operation of the vehicle caused, or created a substantial risk or fear of serious bodily injury. The designated criminal offenses, including convictions, are: assault, aggravated assault, elevated aggravated assault, criminal threatening, and reckless conduct. The license revocation periods are three years for Class A, B or C crimes, two years for a Class D crime, and one year for a Class E offense.\n\nOther Suspensions at Discretion of the Secretary of State\n\nThe license of any person whom the Secretary of State determines is incompetent to drive, e.g., adverse physical or mental impairments, may be suspended without a hearing, provided the Secretary of State has reviewed all available evidence.\n\nIncompetence relative to physical or mental handicaps is determined in accordance with established rules (Chapter 3, as amended), Physical, Emotional and Mental Competence to Operate a Motor Vehicle.\n\nAny person whose license is suspended may request a hearing, but the suspension may remain in effect pending such a hearing.\n\nA judge has discretionary authority to suspend the driver's license of any person found in contempt for failing to pay a fine in any criminal or civil violation proceeding. A judge may order a driver license suspension for offenses unrelated to the operation of motor vehicles.\n\nPart I Practice Questions:\n\n1. Who can file a request with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to suspend the license or\n\ninstruction permit of a minor?\n\n2. The illegal transportation of liquor by a minor carries a minimum suspension of how many days?\n\n3. How many classes of driver's license are issued in Maine?\n\n4. What are demerit points?\n\n5. Name the violations of traffic laws which, upon conviction, carry automatic 90 day suspensions.\n\nPart II\n\nOwning and Maintaining\n\nA Motor Vehicle\n\nJust like having a driver's license, owning a motor vehicle carries many responsibilities. Motor vehicles operated on Maine's public roadways must be registered, insured and well maintained.\n\nTitling Your Motor Vehicle\n\nA motor vehicle must have a title before it can be registered in Maine.\n\n1. What is a title?\n\nA title is a legal document which identifies ownership of a motor vehicle.\n\n2. Why do I need a title?\n\nTo prove ownership and to show any liens (debts) on your vehicle.\n\n3. How do I apply for a title?\n\nIf the vehicle is purchased from a Maine auto dealer, the dealer will furnish you with the blue copy of the title application which must be presented at the time of your first registration. If the vehicle was not purchased from a Maine auto dealer, a title application must be completed by you and submitted with the prior certificate of\n\ntitle or manufacturer's certificate of origin, properly transferred to you.\n\n4. Who is the title given to?\n\nIf you are the owner and have no lien holder you will receive the title. If you have borrowed money to pay for the car, the bank or credit union that lent you the money will get the title.\n\n5. Where do I keep the certificate of title?\n\nIn a safe place; never in the vehicle\n\n6. What vehicles do not need a title under the title law?\n\nAutomobiles with a model year prior to 1995, motorcycles with an engine size less than 300 cc and trailers with an unladen weight of 3,000 pounds or less.\n\n7. What should I do if my title is stolen, lost, destroyed or mutilated?\n\nYou should make application at once for a duplicate title. Send in your mutilated or illegible Certificate of Title with the application and proper fee.\n\nNote: If you have any questions regarding title information, please call 207-624-9000\n\nRegistering Your Vehicle\n\nIf you own any motor vehicle, mobile home, trailer or semi-trailer driven on the roadway, you must register it.\n\n1. How do I register a vehicle in Maine?\n\nPayment of the excise tax to a municipal tax collector is the first step in registering your motor vehicle. An excise tax must be paid on all types of vehicle except semi- trailers. The amount of excise tax due depends upon the age and factory list price of the vehicle being registered. The excise tax receipt, in turn, serves as your registration application. The back of the white copy of the registration must be completed and signed before a registration can be issued. If you are under 18 years of age, your parent or guardian must also sign the application.\n\n2. Where are motor vehicle registrations issued?\n\nAfter payment of the excise tax, your registration and plates may be obtained by visiting any of the Motor Vehicle Branch Offices listed on the inside cover of this manual or by mailing your application and the correct fee to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, 29 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333. Most Maine municipalities issue registrations and plates as well. Check with your municipality to see if they are a participant in the state's municipal agent program.\n\n3. How much does a motor vehicle registration cost?\n\nThe registration fee for a passenger vehicle is $35.00. A registration remains valid for one year from the month it is issued. The fee for pick up trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 6,000 pounds is also $35.00. The registration fee for larger trucks increases with the registered gross weight.\n\n4. Do I need to apply for a Maine title in order to register?\n\nAt the time of first registration, an application for title must be submitted for a vehicle that is model year 1995 or newer.\n\n5. Is payment of sales tax required?\n\nWhen registering any vehicle for the first time in Maine your registration application must be accompanied by a \"Use Tax Certificate\". This form is used to determine if any Maine sales tax is due. Any sales tax due must be paid at the time of first registration. These forms may be obtained from any Bureau of Motor Vehicles Office or from a municipal tax collector. If the vehicle to be registered was purchased from a Maine auto dealer, the dealer will furnish you with the sales tax form, which must be presented at the time of first registration. If you have any questions concerning sales or use tax, you should contact the Sales Tax Division of Maine Revenue Service at 207-287-2336.\n\n6. How soon after moving to Maine must I register my vehicle?\n\nMaine law requires that a Maine motor vehicle registration must be applied for within 30 days if residence in the state of Maine is declared or established.\n\nInsuring Your Motor Vehicle\n\nMaine law requires every owner and operator of a motor vehicle to maintain motor vehicle liability insurance and to present evidence upon request of a law enforcement officer. Any vehicle you are operating must be insured even though you are not the owner. Therefore, you should verify and carry evidence of insurance in the vehicle. Maine law also requires Maine motorists to show evidence of insurance when you register a motor vehicle.\n\nAcceptable forms of evidence of insurance include: a motor vehicle insurance card, a letter from an insurance company, or agent that the vehicle is covered by a liability insurance policy, an insurance binder or an insurance policy that has a summary document that describes the vehicle insured, the name of the insured, the amount of insurance (must meet Maine's minimum liability requirements), the type of insurance coverage and the period the vehicle is covered (effective and expiration dates) to either the municipal agent or the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.\n\nFailure to produce evidence of insurance when required can result in a charge of uninsured operation and suspension of license and registration privileges. If you are adjudicated of failure to produce evidence of insurance, you will be required to file proof of financial responsibility through an SR-22 insurance certificate or face suspension of your license and registration privileges. It is a crime to display evidence of insurance that is fictitious or altered.\n\nIf an uninsured motorist causes an injury or property damage of $1000 or more, they may not operate a vehicle until proof of financial responsibility or proper insurance have been shown. In addition, if a court judgment is obtained, driving and registration privileges are suspended until such judgment is satisfied.\n\nUninsured Motorist Coverage: By law, all automobile liability policies written in Maine include \"uninsured motorist\" coverage. This protects the insured for bodily injury damages up to the limits of the Maine Financial Responsibility Law with higher limits optional.\n\nAssigned Risk: Any individual unable to procure insurance coverage through regularchannels for whatever reasons, can obtain coverage through the Maine Automobile Insurance Plan. All insurance companies selling automobile insurance in Maine are required by law, to participate in this shared market.\n\nInspecting Your Motor Vehicle\n\nAll motor vehicles bearing a Maine registration must have a current Maine inspection before being operated on any public way. These inspections must be done at an official inspection station once a year. Check with any of these stations for details. Failure to have a current inspection sticker could mean a fine and loss of points on your driver's license. Motorcycles must have a valid inspection sticker. A police officer may conduct a vehicle safety inspection at any time. In fact, Maine occasionally uses legal road blocks for just that purpose.\n\nNote: A motor vehicle safety check is also part of the driver examination. Examinations will not be given if vehicles do not pass the regular examination criteria, or if any doors are inoperative, seats are not securely fastened to the floor of the vehicle, or if the glove compartment door is not securely fastened in a closed position.\n\nThese are the major items that are subject to examination which must meet State inspection standards before your vehicle can pass inspection:\n\nVehicle Identification Number - (VIN) Must not be changed, removed or hidden from view.\n\nRear View Mirror - Must not be cracked, broken, clouded or have sharp edges.\n\nHorn - Must be loud enough to hear from 200 feet away.\n\nWindshield Wipers - Wipers and blades must be in good working condition\n\nDefroster - Fan must work and defroster must blow heated air on the windshield.\n\nTurn signals, headlights, rear lights, stop lights, and plate light - All lights must work properly and all lenses must be of the proper color and type.\n\nBrakes - Your vehicle must have a foot brake and a parking brake. The foot brake must be able to stop the vehicle within 30 feet when the vehicle is going 20 miles per hour. The parking brake must be able to hold the vehicle on a hill.\n\nWindshield and Windows - Must not be cracked, broken, clouded, or blocked.\n\nSteering and Front End - Parts must be in good working condition and not worn.\n\nExhaust System - All parts must be free of holes and leaks, and must not make excessive noise.\n\nFuel System - All parts must be free of holes and leaks.\n\nTires - Must have 2/32 of an inch tread and be free of cuts, tears or other dangerous conditions. For commercial vehicles of 10,000 pounds G.V.W., 4/32 of an inch tread is required.\n\nRegistration Plates - All issued plates must be attached to the vehicle and easy to read.\n\nBody or Chassis - All parts must be present and free of rust, sharp edges, or other defects.\n\nSpeedometer-Odometer - Must work properly and not be tampered with or changed.\n\nFuel Inlet - Must not be changed in any way.\n\nCatalytic Converter - Must be properly installed and not changed in any way.\n\nMaintaining Your Motor Vehicle\n\nEnsuring that your car is in proper working order may help you to avoid an accident or breakdown. A car in good shape can give you an extra safety margin when you need it.\n\nWhile you may need a mechanic to correct the problem, you can perform the safety check yourself.\n\nVehicle Maintenance\n\nMake note of the condition of the following items whenever you drive:\n\nHeadlights - Replace burned out bulbs and clean dirty lenses, which can cut your night vision by more than half.\n\nSignal and Brake Lights - Replace bulbs or fuses when necessary. If these lights don't work properly, you won't be able to communicate with other drivers.\n\nWindows and Windshields - Keep the glass clear, inside and out, to reduce glare and ensure good visibility.\n\nTires - Look for signs of worn treads and check air pressure when tires are \"cold\", before you've driven very far. If your tires aren't in good shape, you'll have less control, use more gas and risk a blow-out.\n\nBrakes - Check to see that the pedal stays well above the floor when you step on it. Listen for scraping and squealing and be aware if your vehicle is pulling to one side.\n\nSteering - If your steering wheel turns two inches or more without moving the vehicle, it has too much play - you may not be able to turn fast enough to avoid a collision.\n\nWindshield Wipers - Check the wiper blades for wear and for tension on the windshield. Keep the windshield fluid bottle full, use a fluid with antifreeze in the winter. If these items are not functioning properly, your visibility will be severely limited.\n\nExhaust System - If you hear loud noises or rattles or notice rust on the muffler or tailpipe, you should have the exhaust system checked by a mechanic. A leaky muffler improperly discharges poisonous fumes. Carbon monoxide is a deadly, odorless gas found in the exhaust of all engines which causes weariness, headaches, dizziness, nausea and ringing in the ears. Prolonged inhalation of carbon monoxide is fatal.\n\nVehicle Emissions - A person may not operate a gasoline-powered motor vehicle on a public way if the motor vehicle emits visible smoke, other than water vapor, in the exhaust emission for a period in excess of 5 consecutive seconds.\n\nGauges - Make sure that all your gauges are in working order. These can serve to notify you of potentially serious problems with your vehicle, such as overheating or loss of oil pressure.\n\nSuspension - Push down on the front and rear of your vehicle. If it bounces more than twice, you may need new shocks. When shocks are worn, you may have difficulty staying in your lane on curves.\n\nOn a regular basis, you should also check or have checked:\n\nOil level;\n\nEngine coolant;\n\nTransmission fluid\n\nBrake fluid level; and\n\nFan belt tightness and wear.\n\nMaintaining your vehicle with frequent oil changes (every 3,000 - 5,000 miles) and engine tune-ups (10,000 - 15,000 miles) will serve as prevention against many common motor vehicle problems as well as maximize your car's performance.\n\nTools and Supplies:\n\nIt is advisable to equip your car with the following items in the event of a breakdown or emergency.\n\nOwner's manual\n\nSpare tire\n\nTire jack\n\nLug wrench\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nBlanket\n\nFlashlight\n\nRoad maps\n\nPart II - Practice Questions:\n\n1. What is a title and how do you apply for one?\n\n2. How often should I have my vehicle inspected?\n\n3. What tax must be paid prior to registering a motor vehicle?\n\n4. Will I need liability insurance when I register my motor vehicle?\n\n5. Where and how do I register my motor vehicle?\n\n6. What are some of the emergency supplies I should have in my vehicle at all times?\n\nPART III\n\nKeeping Fit to Drive\n\nDriving is one of the most complex things that people do. To do it well takes a lot of skill and judgment. When you are a new driver, it takes all the ability you have. If anything happens to lower your ability, you cannot drive well. Your ability to drive is affected by:\n\nAlcohol and Other Drugs\n\nWhen learning to drive in Maine, one of the most important things to bear in mind is this: OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE IN MAINE IS A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT - those who fail to drive in a safe and prudent manner will be denied that privilege. In other words - if you misbehave behind the wheel, you WILL BE SEVERELY PENALIZED.\n\nONE OF THE SUREST WAYS TO LOSE YOUR LICENSE IS TO DRINK AND DRIVE.\n\nAlcohol is a drug. It is the most used and abused drug in America today; alcohol can and has ruined the lives of untold millions. If you have been drinking DON'T DRIVE. If you are driving DON'T DRINK!\n\nAlcohol-related crashes during 2010 represented an average of one alcohol-related fatality every 51 minutes. There were 10,228 nationwide alcohol-related crashes in 2010 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\nIn 2010, 16 percent of all fatal crashes during the week were alcohol-related, compared to 31 percent on weekends. The rate of alcohol impairment among drivers involved in fatal crashes in 2010 was four times higher at night than during the day.\n\nIn 2010, twenty-two percent of the young drivers (ages 15 to 20) involved in fatal crashes were drinking.\n\nIn order to discourage drinking and driving, Maine has enacted one of the nation's toughest operating under the influence (OUI) laws. In fact, the chance of arrest and punishment is higher in Maine than in most other states!\n\nThe following chapter is a summary of Maine's tough OUI law; alcohol's relative cost and its effects on you and your driving; as well as a SPECIAL NOTICE TO TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS.\n\nREMEMBER: If you value your life and the lives of others, and the thought of either a criminal record or time in jail does not appeal to you - DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!\n\nHow Drinking Impairs Your Driving\n\nDriving an automobile is not as easy nor as carefree a task as many would have you believe. Driving requires constant decision making and is, by its very nature, difficult and dangerous. Good Driving Requires:\n\nGood Judgment - Good judgment is the ability to think clearly and to make quick decisions, including proper evaluations of time, space and distance. Alcohol impairs good judgment. The more a driver drinks, the more rapidly their judgment goes from good, to bad, to deadly.\n\nGood Perception - Good perception is the ability to see clearly and be visually aware of what is going on around you while driving. The ability to see well becomes even more important at night since normal vision is reduced by 50% because there is not enough light for your eyes to function properly. Drinking severely diminishes good perception. For instance:\n\nAlcohol relaxes the eye muscles and thus reduces your ability to see when there is a sudden increase in light, such as when the headlights of an oncoming car are in your eyes. It normally takes about seven seconds for your eyes to recover from headlight glare. At 55 miles per hour, that is almost the length of two football fields! The eyes of drinking drivers take significantly longer to adjust.\n\nAlcohol also affects your ability to identify objects to the side when looking ahead. After consuming alcohol, your ability to see merging, passing or parked vehicles (pedestrians or bicyclists) on the side of a road is reduced.\n\nAdditionally, alcohol decreases your ability to judge how close or far away another car or object is.\n\nEmotional Control - Having control over one's emotions enables the sober driver to use good judgment while driving. As a depressant, alcohol gradually shuts down more and more areas of the brain. As time passes, drinkers become less and less rational, more easily saddened, upset or angry and thus more likely to take risks while driving.\n\nAlertness, Concentration, Coordination and Reaction Time - Alcohol also interferes with the brain's ability to react and to concentrate. A driver who has consumed alcohol is more apt to fall asleep at the wheel or drive off the roadway. Moreover, the more a person drinks, the less control they have over coordinating body functions and movements.\n\nSimply put, a person who has been drinking is more likely to:\n\nDrive too fast or too slow for prevailing conditions;\n\nFail to dim headlights for oncoming traffic;\n\nPass improperly - leaving insufficient clearance, taking too long, or swerving too much;\n\nMake frequent lane changes;\n\nFail to remain in the center of the lane;\n\nOvershoot and/or disregard traffic signals;\n\nLose alertness and adaptability in emergencies; and\n\nTake too long to brake.\n\nWARNING: Worse yet, as your sight, reflexes, coordination and judgment diminish with each sip of alcohol, you become less and less aware of it. You even develop a false sense of well-being and confidence. In short, you become a menace to yourself and everyone else on or near a highway and you don't even know it!!\n\nGOOD DRIVERS DON'T DRINK!\n\nYour likelihood of a car crash increases with each drink! Your chances of an accident increase:\n\nAlcohol Level (See Page 21)\n\n0.05grams ............... 1 times\n\n0.10grams ............... 6 times\n\n0.15grams ............... 25 times\n\nOver 50% of all fatally injured drivers have an alcohol level of .06 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath.\n\nMyths Concerning Alcohol\n\nBeer vs. booze. Some people think that if they drink beer they are consuming less alcohol than those who drink mixed drinks. They are wrong! There is approximately the same amount of alcohol in a 12 oz. can of beer as there is in a 1 oz. shot of 100 proof hard liquor or 4 oz. glass of table wine (or a 10 oz. wine cooler).\n\n\"People get drunk only from switching drinks.\" WRONG! Actually, switching doesn't usually make much of a difference. People get drunk from drinking too much. Period!\n\n\"People are friendlier when they have been drinking.\" WRONG! Statistics show that roughly one-half of all murders are alcohol-related, as are one-third of all suicides.\n\n\"Few women abuse alcohol\" WRONG! Alcohol abuse does not discriminate. Women are just as likely to abuse alcohol as men.\n\nSobering up. Because everyone's liver oxidizes alcohol at a constant rate, nothing but time will sober you up. Drinking black coffee, taking a cold shower or exercising will only result in a wide awake, wet or sweating drunk!\n\nOther Drugs and Driving\n\nThe word \"drug\" commonly refers to prescription medications, over-the-counter remedies, as well as illegal substances. The use of an over-the-counter medication or a prescription drug does not constitute a defense in court. When alcohol and other drugs combine in the body, the risk of having a traffic accident becomes even greater.\n\nHere are a few things you should remember:\n\nPrescription medications. Be sure to ask your doctor about any side effects which could impair your driving.\n\nOver the counter medications. Some allergy remedies, cough syrups and cold pills which you can buy without prescription contain codeine, alcohol, antihistamines or bromides which can affect driving.\n\nAmphetamines. Amphetamines are used as stimulants, but they can decrease one's ability to concentrate and cause hallucinations. Also, when the effect wears off, one is likely to be very tired and depressed.\n\nTranquilizers. These drugs can cause dizziness or drowsiness when combined with alcohol. They can cause heart failure, dangerously lower blood pressure and cut off the flow of oxygen to the brain.\n\nBarbiturates. Barbiturates are sedatives used primarily to help one to sleep. Excessive use can produce drowsiness, confusion, lack of coordination, tremors and difficulty in thinking clearly.\n\nMarijuana. Studies show that users of marijuana have more arrests for traffic violations than other drivers. Use of marijuana can cause drowsiness and inability to judge time and space. Also, some users report that they tend to concentrate on one object at a time, ignoring other objects around them.\n\nHard drugs. Hard drugs such as morphine, opium, cocaine and heroin are narcotics. These drugs have the power to make users completely unaware of, or indifferent to, their surroundings. Other side effects include: dizziness, incoherence, nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe Drug-Alcohol Mix. Many times worse than alcohol or drugs used alone is the use of alcohol and drugs at the same time. The combined influence of these two substances can produce dangerous effects on the mind and body, often resulting in death.\n\nIt is extremely dangerous to drive under the influence of any drug, legal or otherwise. If you are convicted of driving in this condition you will be subject to the same punishments as those for driving under the influence of alcohol. Additionally, being found in possession of illegal drugs or illegal transportation of drugs by a minor may result in severe penalties.\n\nKNOW THE LAW: THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF MAINE'S OPERATING UNDER THE INFLUENCE (OUI) LAW\n\nImmediate Suspension by Secretary of State\n\nIf you are the operator of a motor vehicle and are driving with an alcohol level of 0.08 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath, you are guilty of a criminal offense of operating under the influence (see description below). You will, in most instances, be promptly arrested and taken off to jail. Following your arrest and based solely on the police report and an alcohol level test result, the Secretary of State will immediately suspend your license. This suspension takes place prior to any court appearance, so while you are waiting for your appearance before a judge, you won't be driving!\n\nBreath Alcohol Concentration\n\nBreath alcohol (BrAC) is simply a precise way of recording the percentage of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath concentration. It is expressed in grams and measured by chemical analysis. BrAC is determined by the amount of alcohol consumed, the time required by the body to rid itself of alcohol, and the person's weight. The body eliminates alcohol at a constant rate that cannot be changed.\n\nNote: Any amount of alcohol is likely to impair your driving ability.\n\nAlcohol Level Testing\n\nThere are two types of tests which can be used to measure alcohol level: the Breath and Blood test. These tests are designed to measure the quantity of alcohol in blood. The results of such testing may be used as evidence in court and are fully accepted in all courts as accurate. Under current Maine law, the police officer will administer a breath test (either a Sobermeter or an Intoxilizer) unless the officer determines that it is unreasonable for such a test to be administered. If the breath test is not administered, the driver will be required to submit to a blood test which may be administered by a physician of the driver's choice, if the physician is reasonably available.\n\n\"Implied Consent\" What is it All About?\n\nIt is important for Maine drivers to remember that a driver's license is not a basic \"right\" guaranteed under our Constitution. It is a privilege that is issued and may be withdrawn at the discretion of the State.\n\nStated briefly, when you operate a motor vehicle in Maine you automatically consent to a test at any time the authorities wish to administer it. You will not be forced to take such a test, but your driver's license will be immediately suspended if you refuse. The suspension will be for a period of up to six years by the Secretary of State. It is administrative - that means no court action is necessary. In addition, testimony of the arresting police officer regarding your driving performance can result in an OUI conviction even without the alcohol test results to back it up!\n\nThe law further requires any operator of a motor vehicle to submit to a chemical test to determine drug concentration if there is probable cause to believe the driver operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of a drug other than alcohol.\n\nThe administrative suspension issued by the Secretary of State remains in effect even if you are later found innocent of OUI. And if you are found guilty based on the police officer's testimony, your refusal to take a test will be considered as an aggravating factor by the judge and another OUI suspension will be tacked on, so you will have a much longer penalty than if you had taken the test.\n\nRemember, a test can also protect you. If you are not legally intoxicated, the test will show it.\n\nIf You are Convicted of Operating Under the Influence or Operating with an Excessive Alcohol Level\n\n1st Court Conviction If you are convicted of OUI and your alcohol level is 0.08 to 0.14 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath:\n\nyou will receive a mandatory fine of at least $500.00, $600.00 with refusal;\n\nyou lose your license for at least 150 days;\n\npay a license reinstatement fee;\n\nand be required to attend an alcohol and other drug education and treatment program.\n\nOr\n\nIf you are convicted of OUI and your alcohol level is 0.15 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath or more; or you are traveling 30 mph or more over the speed limit; or you attempt to elude an officer of the law; or you refuse to take an alcohol level test; or you have a passenger under the age of 21 in the vehicle:\n\nyou will spend at least 48 hours in jail (96 hours if you refuse a test);\n\nlose your license for at least 150 days;\n\npay a license reinstatement fee;\n\nand be required to attend an alcohol and other drug education and treatment program.\n\n2nd Court Conviction (a prior refusal to take an alcohol test is considered a prior offense.) Upon conviction:\n\nyou will receive at least seven days in jail (twelve days if you refuse the test);\n\na mandatory fine of at least $700.00, ($900.00 if you refuse a test);\n\nloss of your license for at least 3 years;\n\npay a license reinstatement fee;\n\nand be required to attend an alcohol and other drug education and treatment program.\n\n3rd Court Conviction Upon conviction:\n\nyou will receive at least 30 days in jail (40 days if you refuse the test);\n\na fine of at least $1,100. ($1,400 if you refuse a test);\n\nthe loss of your license for at least six years (no work license);\n\npay a reinstatement fee;\n\nand be required to attend an alcohol and other drug education and treatment program.\n\nIn addition, all 2nd and subsequent OUI offenders will have to demonstrate proof of liability insurance before being allowed to have their license reinstated. Maine offers an ignition interlock program for OUI offenders. Contact the OUI Section (207) 624-9000 ext. 52104 for additional information.\n\nThere are no provisions whatsoever for work or limited licenses during minimum period when suspended for OUI. Offenders are absolutely prohibited from driving!\n\nConditional Licenses\n\nWhen a person convicted of OUI applies for reinstatement of their license, they are issued a license under the condition that they not operate a vehicle with any amount of alcohol.\n\nAdditional Suspension:\n\nA suspension period of 275 days must be added to the OUI or refusal suspension if a passenger under the age of 21 was in the vehicle.\n\nAfter the first OUI conviction, the reinstated license is conditional for one year. After a second or subsequent conviction, it is conditional for ten years.\n\nA conditional licensee will have their driver's license suspended for one year, without preliminary hearing if operating a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol.\n\nA conditional licensee will have their driver's license suspended for the same suspension periods which apply to 2nd or 3rd OUI convictions if operating with 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath or higher.\n\nA conditional licensee will have their driver's license suspended for a period of two years for any refusal to submit to an alcohol test, a penalty which will be added to any suspension previously handed down for an OUI conviction.\n\nBlood Alcohol Level for Drivers Under 21 Years of Age\n\nFor those of you who have not reached the age of 21, it is illegal for you to consume, purchase or transport any alcoholic beverage. Therefore, you may not drive after consuming any amount of alcohol.\n\nIf you are convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, you will:\n\nlose your driver's license for at least one year;\n\nreceive a stiff fine;\n\npossibly spend some time in jail;\n\nbe required to pay a license reinstatement fee;\n\nand be required to complete an alcohol and other drug education, evaluation and treatment program.\n\nif you have passengers under the age of 21 with you, your license will be suspended for an additional 180 days.\n\nVehicle Seizure\n\nA person arrested for operating under the influence or operating after suspension if the suspension was for a previous OUI or OUI offense, is subject to vehicle seizure and payment of any towing and storage fees as well as a fine and jail time. This means that you could lose not only your freedom, but your vehicle as well.\n\nDrivers Involved in Fatal Accidents\n\nEvery driver involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident or an accident where a death is likely to occur must submit to a chemical test. Failure to do so will result in a one- year license suspension.\n\nIf the Secretary of State is satisfied that a driver, while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, negligently operated a motor vehicle in such a manner as to cause the death of any person, the Secretary of State shall immediately suspend that operator's license for at least 3 years. This suspension will be consecutive to any suspension imposed for refusal to submit to a chemical test.\n\nMoreover, a conviction for vehicular homicide in criminal court will result in an extended prison term and a revocation of your driver's license for at least 5 years. If you were under the influence of intoxicants at the time of the offense, your license will be revoked permanently.\n\nOpen Container Law\n\nThe operator of a vehicle on a public way\n\nis in violation of law if the operator or a passenger in the passenger area of the vehicle consumes alcohol or possesses an open alcoholic container.\n\nExceptions:\n\nThe operator or a passenger possesses an open alcoholic beverage container in a vehicle not equipped with a trunk if the open alcoholic beverage container is located behind the last upright seat of the vehicle or in an area not normally occupied by the operator or passenger.\n\nA passenger transported for a fee consumes alcohol or possesses an alcoholic beverage container in a vehicle designed for the for-hire transportation of passengers other than a taxicab.\n\nA passenger possesses an open alcoholic beverage container or a passenger consumes alcohol in the living quarters of a motor home, trailer, semi-trailer or truck camper.\n\nThe operator or the operator's employer holds a valid off-premise catering license and the alcohol is being transported either to or from a catered event.\n\nREMEMBER: Any conviction of OUI Results in a Criminal Record!!\n\nOperating Under the Influence is Costly, in Fact One Drink Over the Legal Limit Could Cost Well Over $7,000:\n\nTowing Charges\n\n$50.00\n\nBail bond\n\n$40.00\n\nLawyer\n\n$2000.00\n\nFine\n\n$500.00\n\nAlcohol Education course\n\n$300.00\n\n3-Year Indurance Surcharge\n\n$4000.00\n\nLoss of Work Time (Jail)\n\n$300.00\n\nLicense Reinstatment\n\n$50.00\n\nTotal\n\n$7240.00\n\nSpecial Notice for Teenagers and Young Adults\n\nThe leading cause of death for young people in the United States (ages 16 to 24) is alcohol related automobile accidents. Approximately 8,500 young adults are killed and an additional 40,000 are crippled or disfigured every year due to drinking and driving in this country.\n\nRemember, alcohol is a drug, a drug which has damaged or destroyed the lives of tens of millions of drinkers and their families. Alcohol is the Most Dangerous and Widely Used Drug in the United States Today.\n\nThough one or two drinks may make some people feel more lively, alcohol is a depressant and the more you take in, the more your brain is put to sleep. Once absorbed into your blood stream, alcohol travels to all parts of your body. An abusive drinker is likely to have many serious physical problems as a result of excessive use of alcohol.\n\nSome of the most common physical problems include:\n\nproblematic pregnancies and birth defects (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome)\n\nskin problems (broken capillaries, wrinkles, acne)\n\nweight gain and fluid retention\n\ndigestive problems (heartburn, ulcers, nausea, constipation)\n\nnutritional deficiencies\n\nweakened immune system\n\nweakened bones and teeth\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nstrokes, heart attacks and blood clots\n\ncancer\n\nliver disease\n\nfertility problems\n\ndecreased sexual arousal and performance\n\nIt's Okay to Say \"No\" to Alcohol\n\nIn fact, 1 out of 3 adults choose not to drink at all, for reasons such as these:\n\nThey don't like the taste of alcohol.\n\nThey dislike feeling out of control.\n\nDrinking is against their religion.\n\nAlcohol makes them ill.\n\nThey have been taken advantage of while under alcohol's influence.\n\nThey have been in too many dangerous situations too often as a result of alcohol.\n\nThey have a friend or relative whose life has been negatively affected by alcohol.\n\nMoreover, you can have fun, relax and enjoy life without drinking. Ultimately, whether you choose to drink is up to you. You must however, be aware that it is illegal for you to buy alcohol if you are under 21 years of age. Furthermore, it is illegal for you to transport alcohol in a motor vehicle unless in the scope of employment or at the request of a parent or guardian. It is illegal to transport illegal drugs in a motor vehicle at any time.\n\nIf you are ever found to be operating a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in your blood (or refuse to submit to the blood or breath test) you will lose your driver's license for at least one year, and if convicted of OUI, receive a fine and possibly time in jail.\n\nNOTE: With regard to Maine's OUI laws, all licenses issued to minors (people under 21 years of age) are considered provisional and subject to immediate suspension until the individual attains the age of 21.\n\nIN ADDITION\n\nA criminal record has seldom ever been considered an asset when applying for either a job, college, military service or credit.\n\nOverall costs associated with OUI offenses (i.e. fines, increased insurance charges, court costs) are, in most instances, much more prohibitive for teenagers than they are for older, more financially secure adults - $7,240.00 is a lot harder to come by for someone who is either unemployed or making minimum wage.\n\nOver half of the young people killed in alcohol related crashes were not the ones who were drinking! Protect your future.\n\nDon't drink and drive, and Don't ride along with anyone who has.\n\nCall a taxi - catch a bus - call a friend or relative!\n\nCould you live with yourself if you killed or injured someone while driving after drinking? When you drive, you are responsible for the safety of your passengers, other drivers on the road, and pedestrians. You can protect your family and friends not only by not drinking and driving yourself, but by encouraging others to do likewise.\n\nMAKE THE RIGHT DECISION: CHOOSE LIFE!!\n\nVision and Hearing\n\nMost of what you do behind the wheel is based on what you see. Good eyesight means:\n\nSeeing clearly. If you cannot see clearly, you cannot judge distances or spot trouble, so you won't be able to do something about it.\n\nGood side vision. You need to see out of the corner of your eye. This lets you spot vehicles coming up on either side of you while your eyes are on the road ahead.\n\nJudging distance. You can see clearly and still not be able to judge distances. Good distance judgment is important in knowing how far you are from other vehicles.\n\nGood night vision. Many people who can see clearly in the daytime have trouble at night. Some cannot see things in a dim light. Others may have trouble with the glare of headlights.\n\nHave your eyes checked every year or two. You may never know about bad side vision or bad distance judgment unless your eyes are checked.\n\nHearing is more important to driving than many people realize. Your hearing can warn you of danger - the sound of horns, a siren, screeching tires. Some times you can hear a vehicle that you cannot see in your blind spots. Hearing problems, like bad eyesight, can come on so slowly that you do not notice them. Drivers who know they have hearing problems can adjust. They can learn to rely more on their seeing habits. Even people with good hearing cannot hear well if the radio is blaring. Keep the radio turned down and do not wear headsets while driving.\n\nDriver Fatigue\n\nRemember, when you're tired, you can't drive as well as you do when you're rested. Decisions are slower and harder to make and you get upset more easily. Or worse, there's always the chance you'll fall asleep behind the wheel.\n\nWake Up To The Facts\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that each year as many as 240,000 accidents are related to sleepiness at the wheel. And in a recent survey, 25% of surveyed drivers reported having fallen asleep while driving, while one in twenty reported having had a crash due to falling asleep or being drowsy while driving. What's more, these crashes can be serious. In a study of fatal crashes on the New York Thruway, an estimated - occurred because the driver fell asleep at the wheel. And here's perhaps an even more sobering thought; like driving under the influence of alcohol, drowsiness severely impairs your driving ability.\n\nYou Can't Fight Off the Sandman\n\nMost of us believe we can control when we fall asleep. But the reality is, sleep is not voluntary. You can't shake it off with caffeine. You can't stave it off with loud music. And you can't hold it off simply by cracking the window for fresh air. Fact is, if you're drowsy at the wheel, you can fall asleep and never even know it; called \"micro-sleeps,\" these brief naps last only four to five seconds. And when you're cruising along at 55 miles an hour, the tiniest nap can be fatal.\n\nCatch Up On Your Sleep Before It Catches Up With You.\n\nIf you feel like you're not getting enough sleep, you're not alone. It's estimated that 30% to 50% of us aren't getting the amount of sleep our bodies require. The result is a \"sleep debt\" we owe ourselves. And the only way to erase this debt is to get more sleep. So don't be fooled by feeling alert just before you plan to drive, because as soon as you get behind the wheel and relax, your sleep debt may take over and put you in serious danger of falling asleep.\n\nHow Much Sleep Does Your Body Really Need?\n\nEverybody has a biological need for a certain amount of sleep. It's possible you may be able to get by with as little as 6 hours. But you could be someone who requires as much as 10 hours of sleep. How can you know? For starters, you shouldn't have to rely on an alarm clock to wake you every morning; if you're getting enough sleep, your brain will wake you automatically. Here's another way to tell: do you sleep a lot later on weekends or doze off when you're sitting up? If you do, your body is telling you something. And you owe it to your health and safety to listen by getting more sleep.\n\nGive It A Rest For Safety\n\nHere are five tips to help assure you arrive safely.\n\nMake sure you get plenty of sleep the night before leaving on a trip. Plan to drive only during the time you are normally awake. And never try to push through to your destination rather than pulling off the road and finding a safe place to rest.\n\nAvoid driving during your body's \"downtime\". Take a mid-afternoon break and find a safe place to sleep between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nTalk with your passenger if you have someone along for the trip. Trade off driving duty to allow one another to rest.\n\nMake sure both people in the front seats are awake. A driver who needs rest should go to the back seat, buckle up and nap. Why? When the objective is to always remain alert, it doesn't help if the person next to you is sawing logs.\n\nSchedule a break every two hours or 100 miles. And, of course, stop sooner if you're experiencing any of the danger signs and take a short 15 to 20 minute nap.\n\nThe Danger Signs of Drowsiness\n\nYou must make a conscious effort to keep your eyes open.\n\nYou want to prop your head up.\n\nYou can't stop yawning.\n\nYou don't remember driving the last few miles.\n\nYou keep drifting from your lane.\n\nYou have wandering, disconnected thoughts.\n\nIf you experience even one of these symptoms, you're only heading for trouble. Pull off the road and find a safe place to take a short nap.\n\nYour Health\n\nAny health problem can affect your driving , a bad cold, infection, or a virus. Even little problems like a stiff neck, a cough, or a sore leg can affect your driving. If you are not \"up to par\", let someone else drive.\n\nWith short-term illnesses, you must decide for yourself if you can safely drive. With long-term conditions that can affect your driving, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles shares the decision. The driver's license examiner can help you decide when and how you may safely drive and whether you need any special equipment. Many people with long-term medical conditions or disabilities are licensed to drive in Maine.\n\nMedical conditions and disabilities that are evaluated include, but are not limited to:\n\nConditions that affect alertness. For example, diabetes, heart problems, epilepsy, and severe lung disorders may reduce alertness. However, if the condition is shown to be stable and well controlled, you may be licensed.\n\nPhysical disabilities. Many people drive with, for example, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, amputation of limbs, paralysis or Parkinsonism. Some people need additional training and perhaps special equipment on the vehicle.\n\nIf your condition has changed, or you have started to use special equipment, a driving evaluation may be needed when you renew your license. The examiner will want to see that you can handle the vehicle safely.\n\nVision and hearing problems\n\nPart III Practice Questions:\n\nWhat is the BrAC level which denotes operating under the influence (O.U.I.) in Maine for people under 21 years of age.\n\nWhat is the legal BrAC level for determining O.U.I. in those aged 21 and older in Maine?\n\nWhat does \"implied consent\" mean?\n\nWhat drug is the most damaging and widely used in the United States today?\n\nTrue or false? An O.U.I. offense could cost you more than $7,000.\n\nPart IV\n\nOperating a Motor Vehicle\n\nDriving a motor vehicle is a serious responsibility and rules and guidelines alone are not sufficient to make you a good driver. While respect for the law is essential, to be a good driver you must also possess an accommodating attitude toward others as well as an ample sense of responsibility.\n\nTraffic laws and procedures are designed to prevent accidents and to keep traffic moving. Obeying these guidelines at all times will go a long way toward making you a safe and prudent driver. There is, however, some risk involved in all driving. To minimize this risk, you should rely not only on the law, but on paying careful attention to everything going on around you.\n\nThe following sections summarize traffic laws and prudent driving practices and procedures.\n\nRules of the Road\n\nRules of the road determine where and when you can drive.\n\nControl of Traffic at Intersections\n\nAn intersection is any place where roads meet. At an intersection there are usually traffic signals, signs, or right-of-way rules to control traffic, if no police are there. An operator may not drive a motor vehicle through a parking area to avoid obeying the requirements of a traffic control device.\n\nTraffic Lights\n\nSteady Red: STOP. Do not enter crosswalk or intersection. A right turn is permitted, after stopping, unless posted otherwise. Vehicles making a right turn must yield to pedestrians and all vehicle traffic.\n\nSteady Yellow: Caution. Traffic signal is about to change to red. Begin to slow down. A yellow light clears the intersection before the red light.\n\nGreen: GO. When the way is clear of traffic and pedestrians, you may go straight ahead or turn left or right where permitted.\n\nFlashing Lights\n\nFlashing Red Light: STOP. Come to a complete stop and go only when the way is clear.\n\nFlashing Yellow Light: Slow down and proceed with caution. Flashing yellow lights are found at construction areas and on some vehicles as well as at intersections.\n\nSometimes flashing red lights mark a railroad crossing. Sometimes there are gates or barriers. Stop and wait until the light stops and barriers are removed.\n\nLighted Arrows\n\nThe color of the lighted arrow means the same thing that it does in a traffic light.\n\nA red light with a green arrow means you may go cautiously in the direction of the arrow, yielding to all other vehicleand pedestrians.\n\nA steady yellow arrow clears the turning traffic at an intersection before the red light.\n\nA steady green arrow pointed upwards means you may go straight ahead.\n\nA steady red arrow means traffic making the turn indicated by the arrow must stop until the arrow changes to green.\n\nWhen there is more than one traffic light, obey the one that is over your lane.\n\nLane Use Control Lights: Special overhead lights are sometimes used to indicate which lanes of a highway may be used at certain times:\n\nSteady Red \"X\": Do not drive in this lane.\n\nSteady Yellow \"X\": Clear this lane, signal is about to change to red.\n\nFlashing Yellow \"X\": This lane may only be used for a left turn.\n\nGreen Arrow: You may use this lane.\n\nTraffic Signs\n\nA Stop Sign is red with white letters and has eight sides (octagon). When coming to one, stop before the crosswalk or stop line and do not cross it. If there is no crosswalk or stop line, stop at the point nearest the intersection to enable you to see approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. The stop must be made before any portion of your vehicle has entered the intersection. If it is a four-way stop, wait your turn. In any case you must wait until a safe interval occurs before moving. Pedestrians have the right of way.\n\nA Yield Sign is a triangle. It is red and white (some old signs may\n\nstill be yellow with black letters). It means you should slow down to wait for traffic to clear on the road you are entering or crossing. Give the right- of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nRectangular white signs with red or black letters contain information about traffic regulations.\n\nYou may find red with white signs at exit ramps and the beginning of one-way streets. They tell you:\n\nYou are going in the wrong direction.\n\nYou may not enter.\n\nA red line through a red circle means that you cannot do something.\n\nThis sign means that you cannot turn make a U turn. This sign means you cannot in the direction the arrow is pointing.\n\nIf you see police directing traffic, do as they direct. Police have authority to direct all traffic and pedestrians as needed. It is illegal to refuse or fail to obey police orders. You can lose your license for trying to flee or escape a police officer. When police are not present, traffic signals and signs have the authority of law. It is unlawful to remove or deface traffic signs.\n\nRight-of-Way\n\nWhen there are no signs, symbols, or police to tell you what to do, there are special rules to follow.\n\nWait for pedestrians crossing the road:\n\nWhen pedestrians are in a marked crosswalk and there are no traffic lights or police at the intersection.\n\nWhen the car is turning a corner and the pedestrians are crossing with the light.\n\nWhen the car is crossing a sidewalk. Cars coming out of driveway or alley must stop before the crosswalk, and wait for pedestrians and traffic.\n\nAlways yield the right-of-way to school children crossing a street.\n\nWait for all moving traffic to pass when starting from a parked position.\n\nDo not pass any vehicle that has stopped for pedestrians in a crosswalk.\n\nWhen approaching an intersection, yield the right-of-way to vehicles which have already entered the intersection.\n\nIf two cars enter an uncontrolled intersection at about the same time, yield to the car on your right.\n\nWhen entering a traffic circle, the vehicle which is already in the circle has the right- of-way.\n\nIf two cars enter an intersection at the same time from opposite directions and one driver is signaling for a turn, the right-of-way belongs to the car going straight through.\n\nAt a 4-way stop, the driver reaching the intersection first gets to go first (of course all vehicles must stop).\n\nCars entering from a private drive or road must yield to any vehicle or pedestrian on a public way. If you are entering a through street or highway you must do so without interfering with other traffic.\n\nYou must yield to emergency vehicles approaching from any direction when they are sounding a siren and emitting a flashing light. You must immediately drive to the right side of the roadway, clear of any intersection, and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. Failure to do so is a Class E crime.\n\nEven though right-of-way rules have the force of law, a good driver never depends exclusively on them for safety. A driver who has the right of way should use it sensibly, never insist on it.\n\nUse of Lanes\n\nDifferent traffic lanes should be used for different purposes, there are correct lanes for through traffic, passing and turning.\n\nLanes for Through Traffic: During ordinary driving, drive in the lane that has the smoothest flow of traffic - the least stopping and starting. Smooth driving allows you to keep more distance between yourself and other drivers. It also helps save gas.\n\nIf there are three or more lanes going in one direction, the middle lane, or lanes, are\n\nusually the smoothest. The left lane is for drivers who want to pass or turn left. The right lane is used by drivers who go slower or who are entering or turning off the road.\n\nIf a road has only two lanes in one direction, the right lane generally has the smoothest traffic flow. However, some roads have special left turn lanes at intersections. This helps keep traffic moving smoothly in both directions.\n\nLanes for Passing: In general, you should pass on the left. Passing on the right can be dangerous because other drivers don't expect it. Cars on the right side are also more difficult for a driver to see.\n\nNever pass a vehicle by driving off the pavement or main traveled portion of the roadway.\n\nNever pass a vehicle when an official sign or traffic control device limits the use of the center lane to turning only.\n\nNever pass another motor vehicle on the right side except:\n\nWhen the car you are passing is making a left turn and there is room for two or more lanes to move in the same direction.\n\nWhen the car you are passing is in the left lane on a street or highway with two or more marked lanes for traffic to move in the same direction.\n\nLane Restrictions\n\nOn any section of the Maine Turnpike or Interstate-95 that consists of three lanes in either direction, trucks, including truck tractors, but excluding pickup trucks may only operate in the two farthest right hand lanes.\n\nLanes for Turning: The safest way to turn is by crossing as few lanes of traffic as you can. Here are two rules to help you:\n\nStart from the lane closest to where you want to go. If you are turning left, pull out toward the midpoint in the intersection, and wait with wheels straight until it's clear to turn. Keep just left of midpoint as you turn. If you are turning right, start from the right lane, keeping as close to the curb as possible.\n\nLeft Turns\n\n1. From two-way to two-way street.\n\n2. From one-way to one-way street.\n\n3. From divided to divided highway.\n\n4. From two-way to one-way street\n\n1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nRight Turns\n\n1. Cars\n\n2. Larger Vehicles\n\n1. 2.\n\nTurn into the lane that is closest to the lane from which you came. On a left turn, turn into the leftmost lane going in your direction, whether on a divided highway, 2- way or one-way street. On a right turn, turn into the right lane.\n\nWhen making a left turn from a one-way street, you must be close to the left curb or edge of roadway. If you need to move into another lane, move only after you have finished your turn and when traffic is clear.\n\nDon't turn the wheels before you make the turn. If you are struck from behind, you may be pushed forward into oncoming traffic.\n\nIf you have already started through an intersection, keep going. If you have started to make a turn, follow through. Last second changes cause accidents. If you have made a mistake, go on to the next intersection and work your way back to where you want to go.\n\nSign and Road Markings\n\nMany streets have signs that show what each of the lanes is to be used for:\n\nCars in left lane must turn left. Cars in right lane must go straight or turn right. Cars in left lane may turn left or go straight. Cars in center lane must go straight. Cars in right lane must turn right.\n\nSolid white lines painted on the roadway separate lanes going in the same direction that have different uses. Broken lines simply indicated the lanes going in the same direction.\n\nTraffic Circles and Roundabouts\n\nTraffic circles or roundabouts are sometimes built at intersections of heavily traveled streets and roads. All vehicles approaching traffic circles or roundabouts must yield the right- of-way to vehicles already in the circle or roundabout unless otherwise directed by a police officer or by traffic control devices. Traffic on a roundabout proceeds to the right around the raised center island. Raised pavement on the inside of the circle enables trucks to negotiate around the small island, while vehicles stay in the outer travel lane. At large traffic circles, called rotaries, vehicles also proceed to the right or counterclockwise around the center island at a slow rate of speed until the street desired is approached. Drivers must yield the right-of- way to a vehicle on the operator's left. Exit from the circle or roundabout is then made by making a right turn. Extreme caution should be used when entering and leaving traffic circles or roundabouts and strict attention to highway signs and pavement markings is necessary.\n\nIf you are going to be turning from a rotary circle within two exits, it is suggested that you should be in the right lane (This applies unless otherwise indicated by road markings on pavement or traffic signs specifying the lane to be used.\n\nParking\n\nWhen you park on a public road, make sure you do not get in the way of traffic. You must park parallel to the road except where angle parking lines are painted on the roadway. Leave at least two feet between your car and vehicles parked in front or behind.\n\nMove as far away from driving lanes as possible. If there is a roadside shoulder, pull as far onto it as you can. If there is a curb, park as close to it as you can (and no more than 18 inches away)\n\nMake sure your car can't move. Set your parking brake and shift gears to park (first or reverse in a manual shift car).\n\nIf you are parked on a hill:Turn wheels so that if the car moves downhill the wheels will be stopped by the curb. Or, if there is no curb, the wheels will turn the car off the road (not into traffic).\n\nAvoid traffic. Get out of your car on the curb side if you can. If you have to use the street side, check for traffic behind you, especially bicycles, before you open the door.\n\nSecure your car. Turn off the engine and remove the key when you leave a car. If the car will be out of your sight, lock it.\n\nParallel Parking/Offset Backing\n\nStop even with the car ahead and about 2 feet away from it.\n\nTurn wheels sharply right, look over your right shoulder and back slowly toward the car behind.\n\nAs the front door passes the back bumper of the car ahead, quickly straighten the wheels and continue to back straight.\n\nWhen clear of the car ahead, turn wheels sharply left and back slowly to car behind.\n\nTurn wheels sharply right and pull forward toward the center of the parking space.\n\nStraighten wheels unless you are on a hill. You should be about 6 inches from the curb, and be sure not to park more than 18 inches from the curb.\n\nYou may have to make adjustments to this method depending on the size of your vehicle - practice is the key.\n\nSome municipal ordinances do not allow you to park:\n\nIn an area reserved for persons with disabilities, unless you have a special parking permit or plates for the disabled ($100 Fine). In addition, State law prohibits misuse of disability plates and placards ($100 Fine).\n\nIn a loading zone.\n\nWithin 10 feet of a fire hydrant.\n\nWithin 15 feet of a driveway entrance to a fire station or directly across from the entrance.\n\nWithin 15 feet of a crosswalk.\n\nAt an entrance to a school, church, theater, hotel, hospital, or public place during hours designated.\n\nStarting from a Parking Place\n\nIf parked on the right hand side of the road, after starting your motor, look over your left shoulder (not through your rearview mirror). When the way is clear give a proper signal, as you would in making a left turn, then pull slowly out into the street and get into the correct lane as soon as possible. Do the same from left curb, except look over your right shoulder.\n\nRegardless of the type of street or position, always make sure that the lane which you are about to enter is free of traffic for a safe distance.\n\nCarrying Passenger and Freight\n\nNo passenger type vehicle should carry a load which extends over the sides of the vehicle beyond the line of the fenders on the left side, or extends more than six inches beyond the line of the fenders on the right side of the vehicle. You must not drive a vehicle if it is so loaded, or when there are more than 3 persons in the front seat, so as to obstruct your view to the front or sides, or as to interfere with your use of controls. Don't let passengers sit on the hood, roof or trunk of a moving vehicle.\n\nNo person may ride in a camp trailer, mobile home, semi-trailer, utility trailer or trunk of a vehicle while it is being moved on any highway.\n\nWhen a passenger under 19 years of age is transported in a pick-up truck, that passenger must ride in the passenger compartment of the pick-up truck, except, when the passenger under 19 is a:\n\nWorker or trainee, including agricultural worker or trainee, engaged in the necessary discharge of their duties or training or being transported between work or training locations.\n\nLicensed hunter being transported to or from a hunting location.\n\nParticipant in a parade.\n\nA passenger secured in a seatbelt in a manufacturer-installed seat located outside the passenger compartment.\n\nA person driving an open vehicle, including pick-up trucks, and convertibles, may not transport a dog in the open portion of that vehicle on a public way unless the dog is protected in a manner that prevents the dog from falling or jumping or being thrown from the vehicle, except; when a dog is being transported by a farmer or farm employee who is performing agricultural activities requiring services of the dog, or a hunting dog at a hunting site or being transported between hunting sites by a licensed hunter.\n\nBasic Operating Procedures: Manual Transmission\n\nThe key to smooth clutch operation is learning to sense the friction point. This is the point when, as you let up the clutch pedal, the engine and the transmission engage. As you continue to let up the clutch, you must match the forward (or backward) motion of the car with an increase in pressure on the gas pedal.\n\nFollow these steps to put the car in motion:\n\nPress the brake pedal with your right foot. With your left foot, press the clutch pedal to the floor.\n\nShift into first gear.\n\nRelease the parking brake.\n\nSwitch on your turn signal to indicate the direction you plan to move.\n\nCheck for traffic in your rear-view and side-view mirrors. Look over your shoulder to check blind spots.\n\nSlowly let the clutch up to the friction point. Remember: look at the roadway, not down at your feet or hands!\n\nMove your right foot from the brake to the accelerator.\n\nAs you press down gently on the accelerator, slowly let up the clutch pedal all the way.\n\nIf the car jerks forward, you either released the clutch abruptly, or you pressed too hard on the gas pedal. If the car lurches and the engine stalls out, you've not fed the engine enough gas.\n\nHow can you use each forward gear?\n\nYour selection of gears depends on the power and speed you need for various driving tasks. First gear gives the power needed to set a car in motion. Second gear lets you go 15 to 25 mph, depending on the horsepower of the engine and on whether the transmission is 3,4, or 5-speed. You can also use second gear to start on ice or drive in heavy snow. Third gear, in cars with 3-speed transmissions, is generally used for all speeds over 25 mph. If a car has a 4- or 5-speed transmission and a small engine, third is used at speeds up to 30 or 40 mph. Use fourth gear for driving above 35 mph on a flat roadway. When driving uphill, you may have to achieve 40 mph or more before shifting to fourth or fifth gear.\n\nShifting to a higher gear\n\nAccelerate to a speed appropriate for the gear you want to be in.\n\nPress the clutch pedal to the floor.\n\nRelease the accelerator.\n\nShift to the next higher gear.\n\nPress again on the accelerator. Release the clutch pedal part way.\n\nLet the clutch pedal up all the way.\n\nDownshifting\n\nThere are several reasons to downshift: to gain power, accelerate, steer effectively, slowing the car on a down slope (except when the road is slippery), and to slow down or stop. To shift to a lower gear, follow these steps:\n\nRelease the accelerator. (If you also want to slow down, press the brake pedal)\n\nPress the clutch pedal to the floor.\n\nShift to the next lower gear. (A sudden decrease in speed may require you to shift to an even lower gear - as when braking sharply and downshifting from fourth gear to second)\n\nRelease the clutch pedal to the friction point. Press down on the accelerator as necessary.\n\nHolding the car in place\n\nLearning to move a manual shift car forward after stopping on an uphill grade takes practice. To keep the car from rolling backward:\n\nSet the parking brake.\n\nPress the clutch to the floor, and shift into first gear.\n\nLet the clutch pedal up to the friction point, and press gently on the accelerator.\n\nRelease the parking brake as you begin to feel the car pulling forward.\n\nPress the accelerator as you let up the clutch pedal.\n\nAccelerate in first gear until you have gained enough speed to shift into second gear.\n\nSeeing Well While Driving\n\nMost of what you do while driving is a reaction to what you see. To be a good driver, you need to see well. Seeing well means:\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSuppose you are the driver looking through the windshield. You are approaching the end of the lane. If you don't change lanes soon, you may have to make a sudden lane change, or stop and wait for traffic to clear.\n\nIn the city, 10 to 15 seconds is about one block.\n\nOn the highway, 10 to 15 seconds is about a quarter of a mile.\n\nTaking in the Whole Scene\n\nLooking 10 to 15 seconds ahead doesn't mean looking at the middle of the road. It means taking in the entire scene, the sides of the road as well. Scanning the roadside helps you to see:\n\nVehicles and people that may be in the road by the time you reach them.\n\nSigns warning of conditions ahead.\n\nSigns giving you information about places ahead and how to reach them.\n\nAnimals. Many cars strike deer, especially in October and November. If you see a deer, sound the horn. Look for other deer following.\n\nIf you look ahead, you will be able to see important things that you can't see later on, such as someone getting into a parked car. The car door might open again or the car might move into your lane right ahead of you.\n\nLooking to the Sides\n\nAny time you come to a place where other vehicles or pedestrians may cross or enter your path, look to the sides to make sure no one is coming. These places include: intersections, roadside areas, crosswalks, and railroad crossings.\n\nIntersections\n\nAn intersection is any place where roads meet, so that one line of traffic meets or crosses another. It includes:\n\nCross streets and side streets,\n\nFreeway entrances,\n\nDriveway and shopping center entrances.\n\nHere are some of the rules to follow anytime you approach an intersection.\n\nLooking both ways:\n\n1. Look to the left first, because vehicles coming from the left are closer to you.\n\n2. Look to the right.\n\n3. Take one more look to the left before you pull out, just in case there is someone you didn't see the first time. Make sure you look both ways, even when you cross a one-way street (Someone might be going the before you pull out, just in case wrong way).\n\nDon't rely on traffic signals. At an intersection, look left and right, even if other traffic has a red light or stop sign. Someone may run either one.\n\nMake sure you have a good view. If your view of a cross street is blocked by buildings, trees, a fence or a row of parked cars, edge forward slowly until you can see.\n\nDon't start to turn yet! Wait until traffic clears.\n\nIf a line of cars in one lane is blocking your view of another lane, wait until the cars move. If you try to look by edging the front of your car into the other lane, you may get hit.\n\nRoadside Areas\n\nWhenever there is a lot of activity along the side of the road, there is a good chance that someone will cross or enter. Therefore, it is very important to look to the sides when you are near:\n\nShopping center and parking lots,\n\nConstruction areas,\n\nBusy sidewalks,\n\nPlaygrounds, schoolyards, and parks,\n\nLawn and garage sales.\n\nStop Lines\n\nStop lines are usually painted on the roadway at a distance from an intersection to give pedestrians a walkway in front of stopped cars. Stop your car before the painted stop lines.\n\nWhen turning a corner, watch for people who are about to cross the street. Remember, if you have a green light, the light may also be green for them. You must wait for pedestrians in a crosswalk, marked or unmarked.\n\nA person who is blind or visually impaired may use a white cane as a means for safe and independent travel. This person may also be led by a guide dog. In either case, this person always has the right of way. If you see anyone in the roadway with a white cane or guide dog, stop at least 10 feet away and wait until the person is out of danger. An operator who f"
