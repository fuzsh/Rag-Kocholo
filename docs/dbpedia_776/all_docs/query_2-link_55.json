        "text": "Grateful Dead\n\nThe Grateful Dead were formed in 1965 by Jerry Garcia (Lead Guitar), Bob Weir, (Rhythm Guitar), Pigpen (Keyboards), Phil Lesh (Bass) and Bill Kreutzman (Drums) in San Francisco. Originally an acoustic folk styled group, they eventually switched to electric instruments and became the epitome of psychedelic rock. Truly, no other group in 1960s popular music emphasized exploratory collective improvisation and live performance as much as the Grateful Dead. They blended many different types of music (folk, country, jazz, bluegrass, classical, free improvisation, etc.), creating a kaleidoscopic variety. Through improvisation when performing live they created smooth flowing and spontaneous sets of music, and every show was a unique performance, much like jazz.\n\nOne of the first opportunities for the Dead came from performing at the Acid Tests. The Acid Tests were a series of free form performance events organized by author Ken Kesey in which the participants (this included band members as well as audience members) were given LSD. Also, the Dead would often perform free concerts around San Francisco as well, setting up their gear on a flatbed truck in the middle of the street or a park and performing for whoever happened to be there. Gradually, through word-of-mouth, the group grew in popularity.\n\nAs the group became more popular, they were eventually signed to Warner Brothers and released their first album in 1967. By the time of their second and third albums, Anthem of the Sun (1968) and Aoxomoxoa (1969), the Dead were spending lots of time and money crafting complex and unusual sounds in the studio. Two new members joined around this time, Mickey Hart (2nd drummer) and Tom Constanten (keyboards), adding to the density of the sound. While their live performances were revered, these early studio efforts tended to lack the excitement of their performances. Also, the Grateful Dead’s experimental recordings were sometimes much longer than the average ‘radio-friendly’ song. “New Potato Caboose” (in Ch. 13 Listening Examples) features elaborate studio recordings mixed with a full band improvisation recorded live and spliced in as a second section to the song.\n\nThe studio albums had left the band owing money to Warner Brothers, so in 1970 they released the double live album Live Dead. This was in part to make back money they owed, but also to showcase the unique quality of a Grateful Dead concert. The first side of the double album showcased a single performance of a song called “Dark Star”, a piece with room for lengthy improvisation. A total of six minutes and four seconds of improvisation open the piece before the first vocal section occurs. Once the vocal section finishes, the band proceeds to experiment with sound, texture, loud and soft dynamics, rhythm/tempo, and tonality. The music is a far cry from the improvisation of a group such as Cream performing a 12-bar blues song like “Crossroads”. The dynamics of the music range from near silence to blistering intensity; Notice the slow yet intense build up of tension from about 7:10 to the release at about 8:07. The group is very active with their accompaniment behind Jerry Garcia’s lead guitar lines Listen to the way the band is playing from around 17:00 to about 18:00. During this section, the accompanying players move to the forefront of the texture, and Garcia modifies his lines to a more interactive role. Most often, accompanying players will play somewhat repetitive music beneath an improvising soloist; not in this case. This music is purely improvised and the band has developed the ability to communicate with each other through their instruments and ears. Another vocal section (a variation on the first) comes back towards the end of the recording. The form of “Dark Star” really defies analysis, but it could be described simply as two vocal sections or verses amidst a large form improvisation.\n\nWith the albums Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty (both 1970), the Grateful Dead showcased new elements including acoustic folk and country influences, vocal harmonies inspired by Crosby, Stills and Nash, and especially the superb songwriting partnership of Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter. This added to the stylistic variety of the group and was a marked departure from their psychedelic roots, though they continued to incorporate lengthy improvisation into their performances which often ran at least 3 hours, but could, in a few cases, go as long as 4-5 hours.\n\n“Friend of the Devil” by the Grateful Dead from American Beauty represents the new side of the Grateful Dead. Like the rest of the album, the song uses acoustic guitars and other acoustic instruments such as mandolin. This song uses ideas from the lexicon of American folk and country such as storyline lyrics. The song is telling the tale of a man accused of a crime who is on the run from the law, along with mention of many women in his life. The form is more along the lines of contemporary 1960s pop in that it uses verse-chorus form. However, it is unusual in that it uses two bridges and one of the verse sections are repeated twice. Lyrics below:\n\nI lit up from Reno\n\nI was trailed by twenty hounds\n\nDidn’t get to sleep that night\n\nTill the morning came around\n\nI set out running but I’ll take my time\n\nA friend of the Devil is a friend of mine\n\nIf I get home before daylight\n\nI just might get some sleep tonight\n\nI ran into the Devil, babe\n\nHe loaned me twenty bills\n\nI spent that night in Utah\n\nIn a cave up in the hills\n\nI set out running but I’ll take my time\n\nA friend of the Devil is a friend of mine\n\nIf I get home before daylight\n\nI just might get some sleep tonight\n\nI ran down to the levee\n\nBut the Devil caught me there\n\nHe took my twenty dollar bill\n\nAnd he vanished in the air\n\nI set out running but I’ll take my time\n\nA friend of the Devil is a friend of mine\n\nIf I get home before daylight\n\nI just might get some sleep tonight\n\nGot two reasons why I cry\n\nAway each lonely night\n\nThe first one’s named sweet Anne Marie\n\nAnd she’s my heart’s delight\n\nSecond one is prison, baby\n\nThe sheriff’s on my trail\n\nAnd if he catches up with me\n\nI’ll spend my life in jail\n\nGot a wife in Chino, babe\n\nAnd one in Cherokee\n\nFirst one says she’s got my child\n\nBut it don’t look like me\n\nI set out running but I take my time\n\nA friend of the Devil is a friend of mine\n\nIf I get home before daylight\n\nI just might get some sleep tonight\n\nGot two reasons why I cry\n\nAway each lonely night\n\nThe first one’s named sweet Anne Marie\n\nAnd she’s my heart’s delight\n\nSecond one is prison, baby\n\nThe sheriff’s on my trail\n\nAnd if he catches up with me\n\nI’ll spend my life in jail\n\nGot a wife in Chino, babe\n\nThe one in Cherokee\n\nThe first one says she’s got my child\n\nBut it don’t look like me\n\nI set out running but I’ll take my time\n\nA friend of the Devil is a friend of mine\n\nIf I get home before daylight\n\nI just might get some sleep tonight\n\nThe Dead began in the early 70’s to develop a cult following (known as “Deadheads”) that grew to huge proportions. Many of these fans spent years of their lives following the band on tour, some of them making a living by selling Grateful dead merchandise in the parking lots of the venues where the band played. The band also allowed bootlegging (audience recording) and certain concert tapes of especially brilliant live performances were sometimes prized more than the actual albums. While most artists were not fond of bootlegging, this proved a way for the band to advertise their music and live performances for free, and often new fans were born out of hearing a friend’s live tape. The Dead, almost from the beginning, emphasized live performance as their primary vessel for artistic expression much more than studio recordings, and this was not lost on their fans.\n\nThe group was dealt a blow in 1986 when Jerry Garcia nearly died after falling into a coma. Garcia had to relearn how to play guitar before they could continue touring. Though the Grateful Dead continued to successfully tour and release albums with a huge live following, Jerry Garcia struggled with health problems and drug addiction until his death in 1995."
