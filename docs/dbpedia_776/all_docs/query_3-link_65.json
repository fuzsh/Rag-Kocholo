        "text": "Live Aid, benefit concert held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia on July 13, 1985. Organized by Boomtown Rats front man Bob Geldof and Ultravox vocalist Midge Ure, the event drew an estimated 1.5 billion television viewers and raised millions of dollars for famine relief in Ethiopia.\n\nYears of drought, civil war, and failed attempts at government control of the grain market in the early 1980s led to a catastrophic famine that threatened hundreds of thousands of lives in Ethiopia. After seeing a television news report on the subject in 1984, Geldof wrote the lyrics for “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” Ure crafted the melody of the song, and Geldof recruited some of the biggest names in the British new wave scene to contribute vocals. The single, recorded in November 1984 and marketed under the name Band Aid, sold over three million copies and inspired similar all-star benefit projects. Most notable among these was Quincy Jones’s USA for Africa, which hinged on the recording of “We Are the World” in January 1985. The success of Band Aid and USA for Africa inspired Geldof and Ure to stage a fund-raising event that was described as a “global jukebox,” collecting dozens of acts for a marathon 16-hour live music event.\n\nOz for Africa, a benefit held in Sydney, was to have been part of the Live Aid simulcast, but time zone differences proved impossible to reconcile. Footage from Oz for Africa, along with recorded performances from more than a half dozen cities around the world, was ultimately woven into the main satellite broadcast. This signal was carried by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the United Kingdom and the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States, with a separate feed for the American cable television channel MTV. To ensure continuity in the broadcast, artists were given no more than 20 minutes of stage time, and equipment needs were kept to an absolute minimum.\n\nWith less than a month of preparation time, Geldof secured the services of an impressive array of artists. Groups reuniting for the event included the Who, Black Sabbath, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. Moreover, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reconvened in Philadelphia, supported by Phil Collins on drums. Collins, who had performed at Wembley earlier in the day, had crossed the Atlantic on the Concorde to become the only artist to appear on both Live Aid stages."
