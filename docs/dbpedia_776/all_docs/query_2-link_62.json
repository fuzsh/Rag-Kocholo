        "text": "Great Expectations\n\nPros: Time-tested build that should last years\n\n- Easily available replacement parts\n\n- Balanced cable bundled in the package\n\n- Uncolored and highly-resolving midrange\n\n- Much improved sub-bass response over the HD 650 and the HD 660S\n\n- Better upper-treble extension than the previous HD 6xx series of headphones.\n\n- Better macro and microdynamics than their predecessors.\n\n- Good imaging\n\nCons: Clamp-force may be tight for some\n\n- Presence region peak can be distracting at times (intentional tuning choice)\n\n- Vocals are not as forward as the HD 600, nor as lush as the HD 650\n\n- Staging is average in the larger scheme of things\n\n- Pricing could be lower given the highly competitive market\n\nSennheiser has a unique problem: it is its own competition in many aspects.\n\nLet me further clarify that statement.\n\nThe HD 650 were released over two decades ago. Even now they remain relevant, a staple even when it comes to open-back dynamic driver headphones.\n\nSo, how do you follow up a bonafide classic? There is no easy answer to that question. Sennheiser has been hard at work, trying to capture lightning in a bottle one more time.\n\nThe weight of expectations bears heavier on the HD 660S2 than any other pair of mid-range headphones. Perhaps unfairly so, but that’s what makes reviewing them worthwhile.\n\nRead on.\n\nShout out to Sennheiser Germany, for providing the HD 660S2 on loan for review purposes.\n\nThis review originally appeared on Headphonesty.\n\nPackaging​\n\nSennheiser has simplified the packaging of the 6xx series headphones to something rather generic.\n\nWhile the old packaging of the HD 650 and HD 600 used to come with a heavy storage box and padded innards, the newer revisions arrive in recyclable cardboard cutouts.\n\nIn the box​\n\nSennheiser HD 660S2 headphones\n\n1.8m 6.35mm terminated cable\n\n1.6m 4.4mm balanced cable\n\n6.35mm to 3.5mm adapter cable\n\nThe good news is that the HD 600S2 come bundled with balanced and single-ended cables, making it easy to connect them to various sources without having to buy an aftermarket cable.\n\nDesign​\n\nThe HD 660S2 have a mostly plastic build with a spring steel headband.\n\nDespite the usual sneer directed at plastic for not having a “premium” enough feel in hand, the HD 6xx series of headphones tend to last for a long time. My HD 650, for example, have been going strong for over seven years.\n\nThe HD 660S2 use a “dual-entry” cable system where both earcups use separate cable entries. This system is far more robust than the single-entry ones and does not rely on wires running through the headband.\n\nThe yokes have adequate sidewise movement, and the earcups rotate front-to-back by about 15 degrees, so I think most people won’t have issues getting a good seal. The left earcup can be identified by touch thanks to three raised dots near the headband.\n\nOnce again, Sennheiser takes care of the little details.\n\nThe earpads are the same ones that come with the other HD 6xx series of headphones, which means that the sound signature will become more mid-centric as the pads wear over time. Fret not, though, as replacement pads are widely available.\n\nComfort​\n\nThe clamp force is slightly higher than I prefer. However, the pressure is so well distributed that no hotspots are formed.\n\nInternals​\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 660S2 use 38mm drivers with a new magnet design despite utilizing a previous-generation housing.\n\nSennheiser uses the same “vented” magnetic system on the HD 660S2 as the predecessor HD 660S. On the older models (e.g., HD 650 and HD 660), the air displacement at the back of the driver was controlled via foam inserts.\n\nThis new design utilizes stainless steel mesh, resulting in much tighter tolerance and superior material longevity.\n\nThe driver is also similar to the 660S except for the voice coil, which is now thinner (and thus, the increase in impedance, I assume). The housing is essentially the same as the HD 660S as well.\n\nSennheiser HD 660S2 Sound​\n\nThe HD 660S2 are mostly neutral with slight emphasis near the presence region.\n\nThe sub-bass reach and extension are a noticeable improvement over the preceding models.\n\nBass​\n\nSub-bass used to be the Achilles’ heel for the HD 600 and HD 650, and while the HD 660S2 improved noticeably, the latest version of the HD 660S2 delivers the best performance.\n\nThe HD 660S2 produce excellent bass for a pair of open-back, dynamic-driver headphones.\n\nBass is tight and controlled while having excellent speed and mid-bass texture. Deep, low rumble until 30Hz with superior definition. However, those used to accentuated sub-bass will not find it here.\n\nGiven that the HD 660S2 are meant to be neutral, reference-tuned headphones, the sub-bass not having a +10dB shelf makes absolute sense. The slam factor is an area that can be improved, as bass notes do not have a lot of physicality to them.\n\nMidrange​\n\nThe mids are the bread and butter of the HD 6xx series of headphones. The HD 660S2 are no exception.\n\nSennheiser goes a slightly different route this time, with the upper-mids being less pronounced than the predecessors.\n\nThis results in a more laid-back presentation of female vocals compared to the hyper-forward HD 600, while male vocals are not as lush-sounding as the HD 650.\n\nIf you are sensitive to shout, the HD 660S2 will be perfect for you.\n\nTreble​\n\nThe aforementioned lower-treble peak around 6kHz can be tiring for treble-sensitive people. I experience fatigue when listening to poorly mastered tracks. Certain rock and metal songs, e.g., Red Hot Chilli Pepper’s Californication, are susceptible here.\n\nThis peak aids in finding mastering issues, however, especially for de-essing. So it’s there for a reason.\n\nFortunately, the upper-treble is well-extended and has excellent tuning. Cymbals, hi-hats, and triangles resonate naturally, with precise attack and decay. Treble timbre is great as well, with no metallic “zing’ or “sheen” affecting the high notes.\n\nOverall detail and resolution are very good, but the HD 660S2 fall behind some mid-range planar magnetic headphones.\n\nSoundstage and imaging​\n\nSoundstage is average for an open-back, but these don’t sound as closed-in as the HD 600 or HD 650. Stage depth is also improved, with frontal projection better reproduced.\n\nImaging is precise with accurate instrument placement.\n\nDynamics and speed​\n\nMacrodynamic punch is fairly good, even though these aren’t the last word for overall slam and punch.\n\nMicrodynamics (gradual shifts in volume) are excellent, on the other hand. Separation is also above average, but some mid-range planars (e.g., the Hifiman Ananda Nano) are better.\n\nComparisons​\n\nVs Sennheiser HD 650​\n\nSennheiser’s HD 650 are legendary in their own right and are massively popular even 20 years after launch. The HD 660S2 manage to noticeably improve the bass response over the older model.\n\nThere really is no contest – the HD 660S2 bass is in another league compared to the HD 650.\n\nThe HD 650 have noticeable distortion in the sub-bass region, and in busy tracks, bass notes tend to smear into each other. After some modding, I have slightly improved the distortion characteristics of my own HD 650, but even then, you reach the limits fairly quickly.\n\nAnother aspect that has seen a jump is the stage width. While the HD 660S2 are not particularly wide-sounding, they fare much better than the HD 650. A reason for this is the less forward upper-midrange, while the bass extension also helps create a sense of depth.\n\nThe upper-treble is a matter of taste. I find them both well-tuned in this regard, with the HD 660S2 perhaps being a tad more resolving. However, the lower-treble is where I much prefer the HD 650.\n\nFor male vocals, the lushness of the HD 650 remain unmatched for me. For vocal-centric tracks, I gravitate towards the HD 650 for this reason, while for instrumentals and more energetic tracks, the HD 660S2 became the natural pick.\n\nOverall, the HD 660S2 are better suited for most modern genres. At the same time, I cannot overlook the price tag, which is nearly twice that of the HD 6XX Drop variant of the HD 650. The performance upgrade hardly justifies such a massive price gap, so the HD 650/6XX still remain as good an option as ever.\n\nConclusion​\n\nSennheiser has made a practically perfect pair of studio monitors with the HD 660S2. This is what the HD 560S tried to be, and the HD 660S were touted as being, but neither could overcome the final hurdles.\n\nUnfortunately, the price is higher than I consider “apt.” The MSRP is exaggerated for a product that is a slight upgrade over the last model – primarily offering improvement in the bass for existing HD 600 and HD 650 owners.\n\nThis puts me in a somewhat awkward position.\n\nI really like the HD 660S2 and could live with them as my only pair of headphones – for the most part. They do not require a lot of amping (though I’d recommend picking a source with >5 Vrms and >10 ohm output impedance for best results). They sound great with every genre.\n\nHowever, the market has grown so competitive that the HD 660S2 do not offer everything they should at that price. For one, I expect better staging, and the bass slam could be improved. If you find the HD 660S2 on sale for a discount, they are well worth the purchase. At the MSRP, I have my reservations thanks to the old classics.\n\nWTS: Everything Else.\n\nPros: - 20-20 Extension\n\n- Intimate Presentation\n\n- Best Imaging and Layering in the entire HD6-- Lineup\n\n- Best Bass Presentation in the entire HD6-- Lineup\n\n- Fantastic Instrument Tonality and Detail\n\n- Vocal Tracking and Separation is Fantastic\n\n- Most Realistic High Hat Renditions I've Heard to Date*\n\nCons: - Vocals can be slightly thick in the lower regions\n\n- Upper Vocals not as airy as the HD600\n\nPrelude​\n\nNote:\n\nPlease do not read this review if you’re short on time, don’t skimp.\n\nThe HD660S2 is not a one trick pony.\n\nSave this review in your bookmarks and read it on the train or in bed at 2am.\n\nAudio gear has been an addiction of mine since I was 14, and I remember undergoing 4 months of research to find a headphone that will beat the Dr. Dre Beats Studios for half the price. Many days of going back and forth between many choices I landed on the ATH-A900x and to this day it still sits on my rack. I soon fell into a rabbit hole of headphones and finally considered the HD600 as my endgame for the past 6 years as I creeped into the age of 28. At this point my listening preferences have solidified and I’m no longer flexible with new sounding equipment. I’ve purchased other brands such as Hifimans to Beyerdynamics with an open mind but they have all been returned.\n\nI’ve been satisfied with my inventory, until well, Sennheiser sent me an HD660S2. I am still unsure of what I’ve done to deserve them, but I’m grateful for having been given a pair. Do note that the following review will be as critical as if I were to purchase the headphone myself. This is the only time Sennheiser has ever sent me anything and I do not expect them to send me anything else, with that in mind I will be following up with an honest review to the best of my abilities as I would for any other headphone.\n\nThe reason I’m so picky with gear is that I’ve come to realize after many headphones, the HD600 is the absolute one especially when it comes to mids. The headphones are able to recreate the intricacies of vocal qualities. Such as chesty to breathy vocals, the ability to present vocalists’ tongue and teeth placement, and I use all that information to create a mental rendition as if I were that vocalist in front of a microphone. I love hearing piano keys actuating hammers that strike the strings of a grand piano, creating a ground for a violin to cry and soar into the highs of triangles and cabasas into the empty void of white noise. The Sennheiser HD600 has done this for me for half a decade now, and the HD660S2 is challenging for the oval crown.\n\nOn another note, my analysis on the HD660S2’s may seem overexaggerated compared to the average listener. I’ve been told before that X headphone sounds fine, or Y headphone sounds fine, or X and Y headphones sound similar. Which is fine, I’m not one to judge another's perceptions and perspectives to differentiate between gear, but please again do note that my review of course be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nI also play a lot of games semi-competitively. CSGO/Squad/Insurgency, and I listen to Jpop(rock), Kpop, Pop, classical and almost anything involving instrumentals. Majority of my music cannot be found on Tidal, as my listening preferences are found on the asian market.\n\nI see headphones as tools. I put on the HD600’s for music, and the HD660’s for gaming. I don’t switch to X headphone for X song or Y headphone for Y song. That has changed though. Nowadays I use the HD660S2’s for almost everything, as I now have this temptation to bring the HD660S2’s to my bedroom computer setup and the HD660S2’s to my living room setup. Every other headphone seems to have taken a step back and they don’t get my attention as much as the 660S2’s. Before we get to the gritty details, I’m going to start off the review from the very beginning of receiving the HD660S2’s.\n\nIt’s day 1.​\n\nThe headphones are still in the box, and a rather small one, and they’re in the exact same packaging as the HD560S. Well that was an unpleasant surprise. I’m going to miss the hardbox of the original 660S’s or HD600’s. It’s a shame really, I was quite disappointed by the packaging the S2’s were delivered in. Well, Sennheiser better deliver on sound, because taking out the headphone I’m also greeted by the exact same appearance as my HD660S, save for the bronze accents of the HD660S2. Financially though at least in the long run the S2’s will last at least a decade, as it will be easier to swap in all the other parts from my other HD6* headphones. The official earpads themselves are also available on amazon which is fantastic. As based on hours of swapping earpads with former Sennheiser headphones, no other earpads come close to the original earpads that maintain the original sound I have come to enjoy from their headphones.\n\nRegarding the initial clamp, it’s quite aggressive on S2’s, and this actually hinders my ability to listen to music like my prior Sennheiser headphones where I only focus on the sound. Though the S2’s may clamp, I actually don’t notice any hinge creaking that the HD660S’s had which is great, so that’s a definite improvement. Although I will come back in 2 weeks where the clamp is less aggressive on my ears. I instead decided to opt for a sound source where I could get immersed and focused on something else.\n\nStarting with gaming.​\n\nOpening up discord and immediately being greeted by a few dudes in a VOIP channel, the first thing I noticed was the HD660S2 being absolutely clear for speech. This is great, because in this game I play on a daily basis called Squad, I always take up the role of a Squad Leader. The Squad Leader is essentially a volunteer managerial position where I need to listen to 2-4 voices through my right ear, speak with fellow squad leaders with my left ear, and have a 3rd party application like Discord taking up my center channel.\n\nSo was I able to differentiate between voices better than the HD660S or HD600? Yes. The only issue remaining was dealing with information overload. My brain trying to comprehend everyone at the same time and reply to each person in the correct order was a task in itself. Needless to say, whenever I’m in the zone I can reply back to every single individual with ease. Much easier than any prior headphone I’ve owned before.\n\nSpeech separation is great on the HD660S2.​\n\nThe HD660S2 also features more accurate imaging than the original HD660S. The HD660S’ imaging was already spectacular and laser sharp. I never struggled with pinpointing the location of gunfire based on audio positioning. But now it’s even better. The HD660S2 solidified the center image, and filled in the soundstage with multiple layers for center imaging. I no longer require turning my head of my game character to confirm if the gunshot came from in front of me or behind me. A short preview on tonality for later, the HD660S2’s treble is absolutely realistic, the bass is well textured and mids clear. Add this into the amazing imaging and everything sounds clean. I can look at a vehicle with its rumbling engine, or if a vehicle is on fire I can practically feel the .ogg file just radiating off it.\n\nSound presentation is great on the HD660S2.​\n\nForwarding the time to two weeks of ownership with the HD660S2’s, the clamp has finally loosened. If they are anything like my other Sennheisers, it will take about another month for them to adjust to the size of my head. So regarding comfort it will be a total of two months for them to relax and feel better to wear. I do want to point out however that Sennheiser’s oval cups and headphone design itself are the absolutely most comfortable out of all headphones I’ve tried. They are lightweight, they conform to my ears, the swivel cups are spectacular, and the earpads are just the right density.\n\nLet me rephrase my statement from before, since the earpads and headband pads are the same as any other Sennheiser 6 line, these parts are absolutely modular and I have no issues finding them anywhere else on the market. So I don’t doubt for a second that long term ownership is without a doubt in my mind with the S2’s\n\nThe other thing I’ve noticed is that the HD660S2’s have a shorter cable than the HD660S’s, and I’ve grown fond of bringing the S2’s with me everywhere I go now. The HD660S’ longer cable 3m cable was great for walking around, but the HD660S2’ 1.8m cable I felt was a lot more manageable to have instead.\n\n​\n\nDaily Comfort and Build Quality is spectacular on the HD660S2.​\n\nSo with that we’ll get into music.​\n\nThe HD660S2’s have gotten past the grace period and my brain has fully acclimated with S2’s, they are past the new toy syndrome. So let’s get into what it’s like to get into the HD660S2’s after never having experience with higher end headphones. I’ll be honest here, and at the time of writing, HD660S2’s are a tier up from the entire HD6** lineup and it all comes down to microdetails. Anything off to the side of the far edges of the given soundstage is solid and I have zero issues tracking those instruments.\n\nWith all other headphones it seems as though instruments would fade away into the distance. Instruments with the S2’s would exist in its own space and direct all their sound towards me in all of its clarity. Instruments in general have greater detail than my other Sennheisers and it gives them that extra bit of realism. Any reverb near the end of a song can be heard, and artists that sneak in a small vocal line are audible. I don’t need to increase my volume to hear it; no detail escapes the HD660S2’s. I’ve never heard detail like this before, and it just blows my mind listening to songs that I had in my library for over 5 years.\n\nHD660S2’s microdetailing and intimate soundstaging is mind blowing.​\n\nLet’s get into tonality starting with treble. The HD660S2’s bring out a smooth and realistic presentation. I can’t say for sure but they could be on the same volume as the Sundaras regarding treble, but they peak in the absolute perfect place in comparison. Sundara’s treble is somewhat grating for me and peaks in the weirdest places that seem to alter speech. Listening to that guy on AfterPrisonShow with the Sundaras is a real problem, I can’t stand listening to him with the Sundaras as the lower treble peak on the headphones emphasize the way he pronounces “S” sounds through his molars. I’ve sold the Sundaras a long time ago and my goodness just typing about that headphone brings me grief again. The 660S2’s treble regarding speech on S pronunciations are smooth in comparison, there is no grain and sibilance.\n\n​\n\nI digress, let’s go back to the 660S2’s treble. Got off topic there.​\n\nThe S2 has smooth and delicious treble for high hats and higher pitched instruments. It's done completely different compared to the 600, 660S and 560S. And it's realism. There was an odd familiarity to high hats with the 660S2. High hats in real life aren’t all smooth and sparkly like the HD600, they’re not sucked out and sparkly like the 660S, they’re not splashy and grainy like the HD560S.\n\nThe S2’s treble is clean, well defined and solid, they produce air when two cymbals separate. So when a drummer separates two cymbals and taps the top of a cymbal the first thing I hear is the tap, the next thing I hear is the top cymbal dancing on the edges of the lower cymbal and it just constantly creates air. It’s aggressive, and a beautiful evenness between the top and lower treble is where the treble on the HD660S2 takes the cake. This is not to be confused with the HD600’s higher placed treble on the frequency spectrum, the HD660S2 takes a middle approach. Treble extension is absolutely there but not as pronounced.\n\nWell how does the treble on the HD660S2’s perform with the highest of frequencies? If anyone is familiar with synthesizers with jpop and kpop; the artists do not let off on these. They will sweep synths from 7khz all the way up to 14khz and sweep these tones from the left to right channel. Tracking these made me smile as the S2’s are absolutely quick and I can tell if the synthesizers are square or sine waves. Just for giggles I ran a frequency sweep from 20hz to 20khz and apparently I can still hear up to 19khz and feel 21khz. Cool! I used to be able to feel 22khz on an AKG Q701 back when I was 18 but you know what, I’ll take it, good to know my hearing isn’t completely smashed, lol.\n\nThe treble on the HD660S2 is absolutely fantastic.​\n\nAdmittedly I am not a bass-head, maybe sometimes. I don’t desire oodles amount of it as I am a stickler for bass-bleed. If anything touches my mids you will for damn sure be notified of it. I will inform you of that in a moment but bass comes first.\n\nThe HD660S2 has extension and punch. I’ve done a bit of Oratory EQ on the HD660S and I would say the Oratory HD660S is on par with the HD660S2 strictly regarding sub-bass extension. For detail they’re about the same for the Oratory HD660S too. Remove this EQ though from the HD660S and they’re back to sounding rolled off by quite a bit. The HD660S2 extends, punches, and is naturally filled with bass detail without needing EQ. Compared to the HD560S, the HD660S2 has more bass presence and detail by a long shot, it’s not even a competition. The 560S also somewhat lacks that punch as well that the HD660S has. When listening to a heartbeat on an HD660S2, I can hear the flow of blood, ventricle valves opening and closing, the resonant heart thump is all laid out for me. The other Sennheiser headphones don’t really portray this sort of detailed emphasis.\n\nSundaras are definitely left in the dust, if they couldn’t touch the bass weight of the 660S’s, then they definitely can’t touch the 660S2’s.\n\nBass is great on the HD660S2.​\n\nIf you have been skimming past the wall of text.​\n\nYou need to read this word for word when I speak of the mids for the 660S2’s. Senny fans who are all about the mids, if you came from the HD600’s, HD660’s or HD560’s; read closely.\n\nThe HD560’s mids are linear and clear. They just get cut off by their sibilant and grainy treble that occasionally hinders them from a totally smooth vocal presentation.\n\nThe HD600’s mids are warm, smooth, engaging and airy. Yes the upper mids can be slightly aggressive but if you pair the HD600’s upper mids peak with the right solo vocalist, you will be floating in an intimate void of smoothness.\n\nThe HD660S mids are warm, flat, intimate and aggressive with plenty of detail and spectacular vocal separation. Not clear like the HD600’s and HD560S’ though, but if you want to have fun with multiple vocalists the HD660S is the one as the smoothed out and even upper mids allows you to pick and choose the vocalist you would like to listen to.\n\nThe HD660S2’s mids are clear from the middle of the mids, like 300hz-ish, all the way up to the 3.5khz area and are linear like the HD560S. They also feature that technical ability of the HD660 that allow you to selectively listen to individual vocalists.\n\nThis is where it stops though.​\n\nThe 660S2 has lower mids that are slightly thicks on some tracks, and the upper mid extension is somewhat shorter in airy extension past the upper mids peak. The peak of the upper mids are solid, whereas with the HD600, this upper mid peak is more on the airy side. So no, you won’t be getting the full midrange experience of the HD600 with your solo vocalists.\n\nBUT, HOLD ON. ​\n\nRemember this is the Sennheiser HD660S2, and I said the center imaging on the 660S2 has been improved with more layers over the HD660S. If solo vocalists weren’t your thing, then mayhaps I interest you in tracking harmony vocals? On a track where the harmony vocals are practically cheek to cheek with the main vocalist, you will be able to hear each of them clearly. This is where the lower mids of the HD660S2’s come in, because the clear and lower and upper mids create such a stark contrast for higher and lower octaves that it plays well for vocals. To put the vocals of the 660S2’s in a nutshell. The 660S2’s give up some of the HD600’s vocal air and smoothness, for clarity and technical ability with instrumentals. Although I personally prefer vocal tonality at the forefront of my gear before all else, which is why I’m so picky regarding midrange performance.\n\nI am still conflicted that my cute japanese vocalists don’t get the high upper mid extension though, but it’s not as bad as I’ve described. The HD660S2 has this thing of making everything else sound so wonderful that I find it okay that vocal tonality took a slight step back.\n\nVocals are an interesting rollercoaster with the HD660S2’s.​\n\nSo let’s sum it all up.\n\nHD660S2’s are the absolute best for instrumentals and present them in an intimate fashion.\n\nThe Treble is absolutely fantastic.\n\nBass extends, kicks, full-sounding, best bass in a Sennheiser I’ve heard so far.\n\nMids, in every step of the way they are a step above in technical performance\n\nTried and true design that the Sennheisers are known for since forever.\n\nGaming headphones, forget the competition, this is it. 10 hour gaming sessions no problem.\n\nI’m now almost a month in with the HD660S2’s, my least used cans will stay on the rack, and the headphones I rarely touch and don’t regret letting go will be sold at a garage sale.\n\nIn this case:\n\nThe HD560S are a sell.\n\nThe HD660S are a sell.\n\nThe HD600 is a complementary keep for the spectacular HD660S2.\n\nExtra Stuff.​\n\nSource: JDS Atom Stack in 1x gain, averaging 12 o’clock volume dials.\n\nLook here man, the stack has done me good for 5+ years.\n\nAnd again, thank you Sennheiser for the 660S2, best gift I’ve received this year outside of my cat bringing me a dead guppy from my fish tank, both were unexpected.\n\nIf you have questions about the HD660S2's, DON'T ASK.\n\nI will proceed to crawl back into my cave and enjoy my music and games.\n\nThank you everyone for reading and for sticking with me on my lengthy review of the Sennheiser HD660S2.\n\nSee you all in a decade,\n\nSmugsie\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 660S2\n\nPros: —6 series lineage\n\n—dynamics of the sound in and around the head\n\n—space of notes\n\n—fit, comfort, weight\n\nCons: —Some may not like the simple ergonomics of the packaging\n\n—4.4mm and 6.3 cables included with 6.3 to 3.5 adapter also.

I was deep into Headphones around 2016 to 2019 and then went super deep into IEMs for a few years. For 8 months now I have been back going very deep into HPs. I love listening to music, I love analyzing sound and I love writing. I do reviews for me first due the creative intellectual masturbatory pleasure I get out of the process, and I want to get what is hopefully beneficial information out to others.\n\nI do not have a website and I do reviews that I want to do. Sometimes I review items I purchased and sometimes not. I am a huge ZMF, Noble Audio, DCA, Holo Audio and Sennheiser fan as you can tell by my gear in my signature.\n\nSennheiser contacted me out of the blue last month and asked if I would like to be part of introducing the HD 660S2 to the community. Well, I am a huge HD600 fanboy so of course I would like to be part of introducing it unless is sucks. Sometimes I say no out of lack of interest or lack of time. Other times I get a product and send it back or sell it if I purchased it rather than doing a review. I am only interested in reviewing what I enjoy and what I think others should know about.\n\n4 of my 5 last reviews involved a different style I have been working on. I use a fictitious interviewer specific to the company of the product I am reviewing. Vison Ears has Bob the sexually repressed and in recovery interviewer. Vision Ears has the grumpy and rough around the edge’s interviewer name Leroy. I am working on an interviewer for ZMFheadphones for the introduction of the Atrium Closed Back in a month or two. For Sennheiser, you will meet Siegfried the overly optimistic interviewer. This interviewer is based off a real person I lived with in Germany when I spent 4 years there. The goal for me is to enjoy the process. My goal for the reader is hopefully they gain a lot of knowledge about how the HD 660S2 sounds and how it sounds in comparison to the other HD 6 series headphones.\n\nPACKAGING\n\nSiegfried: Hey MM How about the cute little package? It is so exciting to get my sharp Hermes box opener out and with precision open a box of love! I see you have not changed since we were roommates am Kreuzburg in Bonn. Sorry about my buddy changing your oil on your Fiat Uno and forgetting to put the oil pan plug back in. You made it about 50 meters from the Capella before there was a divine like noise from the block. Those crack well.\n\nSLC: Glad you have your sharp opener Siggie! Yes, those were the days. I thought it was a gunshot into my engine that seized up my white Uno. Nothing like having it towed to Ankum so Helmut could put a rebuilt engine in it. Enough of that package, now to the HD 660S2 package. I really like the simplicity of the S2 package. A small box is easier to store and easier to ship. Super ergonomic. I usually just take the IEM or Heaphone out of the box and touch nothing else in the box. I then store the box in a safe place, dry dark place. The opposite of where your mind is optimistic Sieggie. The soft pouch is totally fine. Keeps the dust off them. I love that a cable with 6.3 termination is still included with an adapter to 3.5. I love that a balanced 4.4mm cable is included. 4.4mm is taking over and is a must in my opinion. All that is missing is a 4.4mm female to XLR 4 pin male adapter. A lot of HP amps use XLR still. Then all bases are covered. And for me 1.8 meters is perfect I am still able to reach my HP amp and it the cable is not too long to use with a DAP. Simple and ergonomic is better.\n\nI am a fan of keeping all 6XX series HPs with the same frame and cups. Other companies like ZMF and DCA and Audeze for example do a lot of sharing of chassis and cups. The lightness of the 6XX series HPs is wonderful. The clamp can be tight for some, but it does loosen up over time or can be loosened through bending of the strap.\n\nI like how red is not used on the connector to designate Right. More discrete to have all black on the connectors. That brings me to those three dots! No one likes to be wasting time in the dark missing out on a special moment. The three dots on the left gimbal allow me in the dark or light to quickly know which cup to put on which side of my head.\n\nGreat simple package. Just like you Siggie! I mean that in a pure way Siggie! There will be no corrupting you! I tried after the wall came down, but the freedom never changed you! You stayed pure through Die Wende Zeit and beyond!\n\nSide note: The HD 660S2 is for sure worth the $600 price and in my opinion the quality of sound coming from the S2 is worth more than the $600 price! I do not say that lightly!\n\nCOMPARISON TO HD 600\n\nSiegfried: Remember how much fun we had am Kreuzberg in Bonn, looking out the window and hearing the bird’s making music in the morning. It really helped you get over those 0,5s Markie Mark!! I know you want to talk about the S2 specifically, but can you please start by comparing it to what is close to your heart; the HD 600. We would just sit and look at that marble sheen and those curves while the birds sang!\n\nSLC: I can do that Sig. I remember the 0,5 Kölsch but not the birds. I do remember you rolling up to Kreuzberg in your Trabant! Oh, the smells that came out of that exhaust.\n\nFor my comparisons I will use the same 4.4mm stock Sennheiser cable. I have 2 of them which makes is slicker than the pain on your 1990 Trabbi!\n\n600 is a classic. Crisp and clean and detailed with a natural tonality. My standard of what is my personal sound preference. Anyone say ZMF Auteur or DCA Stealth. HD 600 gets super close to those neutral, clarity boys. Huge words IMO.\n\nThe S2 has a deeper, richer, more textured bass compared to the 600. The treble is more forward with S2. Smooth forward rather than sparkly. The female vocals of S2 are a little richer and more forward. Everything seems more forward with the S2. But, upon a longer listen it is not that the S2 is more forward. There is a sheen of glass taken away compared to the 600. There is for sure an increase in clarity and dynamics. This adds a richness to the sound.\n\nA richness to the sound that is in the same family of what I hear with 4-5K planars such at DCA Expanse. 600 is closer to the DCA Stealth and the S2 is closer to the DCA Expanse sound signature. These are 4K HPs I am talking about. A $300 and $600 HP should not even be mentioned in the same breath, but I am, and I can because it is valid that the S2 gets close enough to the 4K HPs to put them in the same breath.\n\nThere is more bass slam on the S2. Not basshead slam but textured mid and sub presence vs the 600\n\nMale voices are closer on S2. The tonality/naturalness of male voices on 600 and S2 are both excellent. I like the timbre on both. The S2 notes are a tiny bit more rounded than the 600. I would attribute this to the wider stage of the S2.\n\nThe timbre and tonality are extremely similar on both. I like that because I like the 600 timbre. With 600 I am thinking “wow how did they make such good sound at this price range.” With S2 I am thinking “this is so good, I am enjoying this a lot, I am not feeling I am missing anything.” With S2 I am not thinking about grabbing a 4K HP to get to the next level. I am enjoying S2 for what it is. An enjoyable engaging HP to listen to. I am not feeling any FOMO when they are on my head. That to me is incredible. Like I have said with S2 a pain of glass has been taken away vs. 600. The landscape is the same as with the 600 (tonality and timbre) but I see the landscape in a clearer and more expansive way.\n\nOn the note, with staging, I am hearing the music more to the L and R on the S2 vs. the 600. For the 600 the music is right in front of me a bit at the level of my forehead. For the S2 the music expands out to the sides of my head and a few inches in front of me and higher up. At the top of my head level. The music is surrounding me more than the pinpoint positioning of the 600.\n\nWhen I go back and forth for longer sessions and short back and forth, I find that the 600 and S2 have the same level of “when am I going to get tired of this” happening. Neither is warm in the “I could just listen forever and even doze off” vein. The S2 and 600 both have me enjoying the music and admiring the notes. The S2 does it with a more around me sound. Wider vs. the narrower sound of the 600. The S2 has more levels of dynamics happening. Both are micro masters. Both are tonality masters. 600 is on a narrower stage with lower ceiling. S2 is on a wider stage with higher ceiling and better 3D sound. The notes are in a bigger space vs. 600. 600 is more intimate and better for fun under the covers. S2 has you using all the bed for your enjoyment. You still with me mein Schatzi Sigi!\n\nCOMPARISON TO HD650\n\nSiegfried: I am with you Schatz! You always preferred the HD600 in the past to the HD650. I prefer the HD650 for warmth and longer sessions and that mid bass bump. And by the way my Trabi finally no longer rolls down the cobblestone streets. It met its demise in front of the Sparkasse we lived above! What a joy life is and what a joy my Pia and Trabi have been. I donated it to our local village next to the Rathaus where we had der Richtkranz when it was being built. We sang traditional songs all night and enjoyed our 0.2 drinks!\n\nSLC: I assume you are talking about the Trabi and not your wife Pia being donated! Congratulations on the change either way.\n\nThe HD650! I have owned it a few times. I get the “classicness” of it also. I get how some prefer the HD650 over HD600. I get how the HD650 has that chocolate syrupiness of the notes. It has a milk chocolate decay of the notes vs. the dark chocolate decay of the 600. I could write a book on the differences of these two classic HPS and put it in the museum next to Pia. I mean your Trabi. Sorry about the Freudian slip Sig man!\n\nI could listen to the HD 650 for hours and not get any fatigue. With the 650 you must come to the notes . In comparison to the S2, with the S2 the notes come to you. Not in a an annoying “why is this guy always wanting to talk to me” at the party feeling but in a “I am so glad she enjoys coming over and engaging in a conversation with me” feeling. The S2 is closer to me. More intimate than the 650. That is wonderful unless there is bad breath involved. Nothing personal Siegried. We all get that at times.\n\nThere is a difference in timbre from 650 and S2. S2 is closer to the 600 tonality/timber. 650 has milk chocolate thicker notes. More pouring of honey in the notes. A little more distance chill I just need to relax going on. S2 notes are tighter and faster. The vocals of the S2 are closer to you than with 650.\n\nThe big similarity is in the bass. The S2 does have a milder subbass bump of the 600 but has the mid bass jump of the 650. Someone took their time to get this S2 right. They lifted some of the “boringness” of the 600 but kept the tonality and clarity and detail of the 600. They also added to the S2 the midbass bump. Great touch.\n\nThe S2 is quicker with the notes vs. the 650. The S2 has everything coming at you closer than with 650. So much more dynamic and with a pane of glass taken away. It is weird but the S2 is like an improvement to the strengths of the 650 as well as an improvement of the strengths of the 600. If you do want the music to just be there and be playing and be chill about it then the 650 is still a good choice as a complementary HP to have in your stable.\n\nThe HD 650 is more laid back with a longer decay. The S2 is so much quicker. Like going from a planar to DD HP. The tonality of both is different but “realistic”. Just slower on the 650. The S2 has a higher fun factor over the 650 and 600. I hear the heritage of the two in the S2. The game has just been upped this time. The 650 and 600 are still classics and still should have a place in an HP stable. The S2 is an updated version of both in a good way. As I said before, the developers put effort into making an upgrade and not a side grade and they really were cognizant of not ruining a classic.\n\nLet me reiterate, that I have no skin in the game. I do this for the cognitive brain orgasm I get out of analyzing what I enjoy. This is a joy to write, and I hope informative for the listener.\n\nOh yes back to Sig the man. I almost forgot about my overly optimistic bud. I got deep into my audio world. I remember the time I tried to turn you into Sig the Swig and took you to the De Wallen in Amsterdam and then the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. I love how you turned the events into conversations and nothing else. You are about dignity and respect Herr Schlosser, and you will go to a better place if there is one, when this is all said and done. You taught me a lot.\n\nBTW here the playlist I use for understanding HPs for review purposes. These are the songs I listen to most due to the quality of the recording in a lot of cases as well as how much I enjoy the songs:\n\nhttps://tidal.com/browse/playlist/c3bde940-1a74-4096-a3f6-89ea47ac5fa1\n\nA big take away for me in this comparison is the amount of lineage the S2 has from the 650.\n\nCOMPARISON TO HD 660S\n\nSiegfried: Getting access to your playlist reminds me so much of the cassette playlists you would make for me. I did not know what the words meant but I enjoyed the music. I remember you asking me to stop singing “Walk on the Wild Side” in public. Seeing you blush was worth whatever I was saying. On that note, MM it is time to compare the 660S2 to the 660S.\n\nSLC: Hey Sig check out the movie “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”. Leave your optimism adjacent to the door. Speaking of Lou Reed, I remember when I was living in France with my partner at the time and her younger sister singing the Vanessa Paradis version of “Walk on the Wild Side” and her having no clue what she was saying. That was not as funny at all compared to your version.\n\nS2 and S time it is: Easy to cut to the chase on this one. I am truly amazed how the S2 is a better version of the S with some serious lineage going on with 600 timbre and 650 rounder notes and bass bump. All 6 series HPs have mids that are sublime. IMO most of the notes I want to hear are in the mid range. That is where the maturity of the music is at. The 6 series keeps the mids as the meat. The S2 bass is very similar to the S bass except the S2 bass has more texture. It is simply a better version of the same bass. I am not the best at talking about treble and I hear a very similar treble between S2 and S. I am not hearing any harshness with S2 nor S. But I have not met a treble I did not like. Especially after a drink or two.\n\nAs I compare the two quickly and after longer sessions with both, the big take away, which I alluded to already is timbre. The 660S2 is like watching a good movie. You are absorbed in the movie and enjoy the movie. You become one with the movie. When a movie is missing some things, I start thinking about the acting or the plot or just start thinking about something not related to the movie. I get that “something is missing” feeling. With certain HPs I become one with the HP. With the S2 I am enjoying the music. Not a laid-back music that gets boring for me. Not thrown in my face notes that get annoying. I enjoy the music with the S2. I am not thinking about the “acting” nor the “plot”. I am enjoying the music.\n\nI do not get the same level of engagement with S as I do with S2. S is very good, S2 is so much more engaging though. The timbre and how the notes end are what makes it more engaging for me. The acting of the notes is at a better level. I am enjoying the acting and the story rather than thinking about the acting.\n\nSeparation of notes are better with S2. The moving of my head is happening with S2. In a dorky way at 5:00 am in the living room. Again, I am sounding like a broken record, but someone really took the effort to make the S2 better than S in every way and keep the lineage/strengths of 600 and 650. There is a place for 600 and 650 to continue being made. I see no reason to make the S anymore. I get that Bangle BMW feeling when I listen to the 660S. With the S2 I get the “they are back on track and a lot more” feeling. The S2 tops the S in every way and leaves no need at all to grab the S for a session. S2 is simply that good.\n\n“They say, oh my God I see the way you shine\n\nTake your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine\n\nYou know you stopped me dead while I was passing by\n\nAnd now I beg to see you dance just one more time”\n\nDance Monkey by Tones and I\n\nSENNHEISER HD 660S2: Final thoughts\n\nSiegfried: Time to say adieu MM. I thank you for helping me see the dark light but keep my optimism. I have enjoyed my time with you again. It has been a while. I ask you to wrap up your thoughts about the Sennheiser HD 660S2. I now look you in the eye and say Prost and Zum Wohl mein Freund!\n\nSLC: Sig, you are the man and cheers to you, my friend!\n\nI listen to jazz more than anything else. Trio and modal jazz to be more specific. My playlist for understanding gear does not have a lot of jazz in it since I want to hear numerous instruments happening in the same song and more bass and treble and of course vocals.\n\nThe HD 600 is an amazing HP for Trio and modal jazz. Slower lyrical jazz with fewer instruments. The detail and timbre are superb for that purpose. The HD 650 draws me to Rock and Roll and the sick amount of Americana music I listen to (in a simplistic way Americana caught on with Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan with “Nashville Skyline” to Lucinda Williams and of course the demigod Neil Young. The music and producing by Dave Rawlings are a great current version of Americana).\n\nThe 660S2 is drawing me to everything. In a similar way the ZMF Caldera does. Nothing is missing in my opinion. Nothing is too much. The timbre is there. The musicality is there. It is detailed. The bass is there. There is not an annoying V shape. 80% of the music is in the mid-range and the mid-range of the 660S2 is exactly what it should be. The bass and treble act as accoutrements. The top and bottom frequencies are super well integrated with the mids. They add color to the mids. Not too much and not too little.\n\nI am not one for hyperbole when it comes to audio gear. There is a lot of it out there and a lot of really good gear. Most gear has strengths and weaknesses. I am hard pressed to find a weakness with the HD 660S2. Maybe because it is harder to drive. But it sounds great on all gear I have tried it on from a normal DAP to high-end Headphone amps. I think they went back to 300 Ohms because at 300 ohms the magic of the driver can happen. I think Sennheiser tried to keep the magic by appeasing some and going to 150 Ohms with the 660S. I think the 660S is a good HP but the Sennheiser 6 series magic was gone. I can say with 100% SLC MM certainty that the magic is back.\n\nThe magic is back with a style of its own. The 600 lineage is in the 660S2. With even more 650 lineage in the 660S2. That said it does not replace the 600 and it does not replace the 650. They both have huge merits and should be kept in the lineup. I reach for the 600 when I want to focus on detailed timbre and sub bass. I reach for the 650 when I want added mid bass and warmth and musicality. The biggest thing the 660S2 adds to the mix is added dynamics. Sound is happening in a 3-dimensional way that other HPs in the 6 series do not have. All around you but with wonderful timbre/tonality and musicality. Also, with detail and warmth. Sometimes the engagement factor can be lost when you add all that together and this is not happening with the 660S2. That is what makes the HD 660S2 so special.\n\nTime for me to go listen to Dance Monkey followed by the Dylan/Cash version of Girl from the North Country.\n\nUntil we meet again!\n\nMM"
