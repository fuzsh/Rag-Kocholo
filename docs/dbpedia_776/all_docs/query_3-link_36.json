        "text": "‚ÄúI've been really lucky, got to 51 with very little symptoms. My periods stopped and I got hot flushes and night sweats but my energy and everything else was good. Fast forward to 52, I got a UTI, my doctor gave me three days of antibiotics but a week later it was still there. He told me it couldn't be and sent me away. But of course, it was. Fast forward four years of total hell. I have been having recurrent UTIs nonstop for four years. I did try Chinese herbs which gave me six months grace and meant I could travel. Last year was the worst, I got a UTI and was put on an antibiotic that was clearly not working. When I told my GP they said to finish the course and dismissed my fears. I knew it was the wrong one, and it ended up that I was walking around with a rampant E.coli infection for two and half months. Every day I woke up and thought I was dying. One day I looked in the mirror and I was black, literally my skin colour was that colour. I am lucky as I have private health insurance and got into a cab and headed to London and was admitted immediately for IV antibiotics for two weeks. For the last year I have been terrified it would come back and it did twice, the last round of IV antibiotics didn't work. I started HRT which helped a bit and am on vaginal oestrogen but if menopausal UTIs are your thing it is a hideous condition to have. I never thought the menopause would mean I could be seriously ill.\n\nIt's incurable as well, so the only thing you can do is treat the symptoms. I have tried everything but my bacteria are so unusual and so resistant that I am now under a specialist in London. I feel if I'd been listened to in the first place, believed, told it was menopausal and given the right treatment then it would not have got so out of hand. I cannot travel, and often have to cancel appointments at the last minute. The symptoms are unusual as well, not frequent peeing, but violent flu like symptoms and pelvic pain which make you feel so rough you have to leave wherever you are and get home. It's caused no end of stress on my mental health and I am really tough and stoic. What maddens me is we can get to Mars but we can't sort out complex UTI's in women. There is also the undercurrent of fear of sepsis which I try and forget about but it's there. Sometimes I feel I am living in a nightmare from which I will never wake up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have probably typed, deleted, re-typed and reworded this post about 100 times. I have also debated even posting about it at all for many reasons but here goes‚Ä¶\n\nAt the age of 33 I was diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) aka peri menopause.\n\nI always thought menopause was something that happened to older ladies (normal average age is between 45-51) so you can imagine my shock when my GP explained that basically my ovaries had decided to pack in early.\n\nThe immediate implications I thought of was my fertility and the ability to have children which sadly have been diminished. Even though I haven‚Äôt felt at a point in my life to have children just yet I didn‚Äôt want the option off the table for good.\n\nHowever, after opening this can of worms called menopause, I learned there are far more serious health implications which I hadn‚Äôt even considered.\n\nMy risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease among other conditions has sky rocketed due to the fact I am so young and not producing the right hormone requirements (oestrogen/progesterone) for someone my age to protect my heart and bones. I was put forward for a DEXA scan to tell me the condition of my bones and luckily all was fine. This is something I will have to keep retesting but I can only thank my job and lifestyle for keeping me otherwise strong and healthy and hopefully limiting my risk for all of the above ü§ûüèª\n\nAnd then there were the symptoms themselves; anxiety, extreme fatigue, no motivation, memory loss or ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù, insomnia and the hot flushes. Ignorantly of me I had heard other ladies complain about them previously but never really appreciated just how difficult they can be.\n\nYou hear stories of women losing their jobs, their relationships and I guess, themselves really as their hormones are pretty much through the floor. I can totally empathise with that now after about 6 months of just not feeling myself, not wanting to go to work, the gym, socialise with friends‚Ä¶all the things I love, I was really struggling to face.\n\nI felt ashamed, isolated, angry, and confused‚Ä¶there are currently no explanations as to why idiopathic POI can occur. Much of the information I have found I have pretty much had to source myself along with the help of some amazing ladies who have gone through something similar.\n\nI find it completely astonishing that as young girls we are all given sex education, how to avoid pregnancy, taught about our periods yet we are not educated on possibly the most debilitating thing EVERY woman will have to go through at some point. I feel like even though it is talked about more it is still a very misunderstood and taboo topic.\n\nI can‚Äôt help but think had I known more about it all sooner could I have spotted my symptoms and acted sooner both in terms of family planning and treatment. But I guess there‚Äôs no point living in hindsight, the only way is forwards and I really want to turn this negative experience into a positive for others, to raise awareness so that one day each and every woman knows the signs, symptoms and has an arsenal of information to turn to.\n\nLet‚Äôs get talking about women‚Äôs health more, let‚Äôs get talking about the menopause more so no one is left feeling like I did initially.\n\nDon‚Äôt let menopause put your life on pause, push for the help and treatment you need.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen I had a surgical menopause back in 2014, I had no support and wasn‚Äôt at all prepared for the menopausal symptoms I was about to experience. Surgical menopause can often lead to severe symptoms, as you go from having normal levels of oestrogen to literally nothing overnight. Despite this, the only conversation I‚Äôd had with a medical professional, was the day after my operation, when I was asked whether I wanted HRT, in much the same way I was asked if I needed any more painkillers. I politely declined the offer, after all, surely a few hot flushes couldn‚Äôt be that bad?\n\nOh my goodness, I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong and needless to say I had a terrible time of it!\n\nBut worst still, whilst, trying to come to terms with all these sudden, weird and unexpected symptoms, I was also coming under increasing pressure to return to work as I neared the end of ‚Äúthe standard six-week recovery period‚Äù. This was in spite of still trying to find the most effective HRT and as a result, crying constantly at everything - the news, TV programmes, adverts, books, even people being nice to me - everything! And when I approached my GP about this, saying I didn‚Äôt feel well enough to return to work, he simply advised ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt put menopausal symptoms down as a reason on your sick note‚Äù and suggested I go on antidepressants. I knew this wasn‚Äôt the solution, even if watching Billy Elliott, was leaving me sobbing uncontrollably. As emotional as the film is, this simply wasn‚Äôt me and I was finding my over-emotional self a really hard thing to come to terms with.\n\nBut feeling I had no other option, I gritted my teeth, packed my tissues and returned to work, despite knowing I wasn‚Äôt well enough. To cut a long story short, I ended up resigning from a job I loved (and was also very good at) because my then employer - which ironically had an all-female leadership team - showed no understanding or interest in my situation.\n\nIt‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that during my darkest days, I really did think I was going mad. And indeed, research shows that if this had happened to me in the 1800s, I would probably have been considered mad and subject to the ‚ÄúLock ‚Äòem up‚Äù approach which saw menopausal women institutionalised, especially those who enjoyed a glass of wine (so my fate would definitely have been sealed). That said, given the number of women who are offered antidepressants as a treatment for menopause, I‚Äôm not sure how far many GPs have actually moved-on.\n\n‚ÄúThe Change‚Äù unfortunately still generally remains a taboo subject, even amongst many women. That‚Äôs why we need to talk about it, to your mums, dads, brothers, sisters, children - anyone. And for those dealing with this, or about to, it‚Äôs so important to learn about it. Do your research and approach your GP armed with the facts and knowledge.\n\nLife on HRT has been fantastic for me, I have never felt better. Being on HRT has given me the energy to get fit and healthy. I lost 4 stone through exercise and healthy eating, disproving the myth that weight gain is a given after menopause.\n\nTo end, I just want to say that there‚Äôs no question during the menopause things can feel quite grim. But once over that, most women find that life post-menopause is one of nature‚Äôs best kept secrets.\n\nFor me, post-50 is the golden age of life!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy journey to my POI diagnosis began in 2020. I noticed my menstrual cycles becoming more irregular and spaced out. I also noticed some cycles becoming extremely heavy, which made me seek out advice from my OBGYN. During this time, my mother suddenly passed away from Covid, making me my father‚Äôs primary caretaker. He was diagnosed with Lewey Body Dementia a few years prior.\n\nThis was one of the darkest moments in my life. During this time of grieving, I was depressed and apathetic. I couldn‚Äôt get myself out of this dark hold that encompassed me. In addition to my loss, I was incredibly stressed because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle the situation with my father because he lives in New York. I thought the stress contributed to my irregular periods and bouts of depression. After the many tests my doctor performed, I was officially diagnosed with POI (Premature Ovarian Insufficiency). This means that my ovaries were no longer producing normal amounts of the hormone estrogen or releasing eggs regularly, causing infertility and early menopause. That‚Äôs when the anger set in. Going through early menopause and having the ability to have children, stripped from my life. Just like my mother‚Äôs life and my father‚Äôs health.\n\nAfter weeks of incredible emotional pain, I made the choice to work with a therapist to help me process my grief and depression. My gynecologist was so incredibly kind and helpful, and was able to provide me with the right resources and options to treat the side effects of early menopause. Not many people are aware, but menopause (especially before your 50‚Äôs) can cause osteoporosis, heart disease and depression. Low Estrogen, Progesterone and Testosterone can bring these conditions on earlier, greatly affecting the quality of life. After discussing my options, I decided to go with HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) in the form of a compounding cream customized just for me at a local Compounding Pharmacy.\n\nIn about 2 week‚Äôs time, I noticed my energy levels change for the better. My mood improved greatly. After about a month‚Äôs time, my hormone levels improved and my estrogen was no longer below 10.\n\nAfter the good news, I decided that I needed to be strong for my father and those closest to me. I began exercising and eating better on a daily basis. The hot flashes finally stopped as well, and I was able to get a great night‚Äôs sleep as well as focus and perform better as work.\n\nI also changed my mindset as to what being a mother looks like. We can be mothers to our friends, to our family and to ourselves. There are so many options, such as adoption, foster care and even becoming a step parent. The options are out there, we just have to shift our mindset and let go of all our old expectations.\n\nToday I choose to love my body, my mind and my POI diagnosis. We are strong women who can overcome anything. I am truly grateful for discovering THE DAISY NETWORK, a charity for all women facing POI and early menopause. They are an incredible support system and a great resource.\n\nThe Daisy Network is one of the platforms I will be advocating for in the upcoming US Continental Pageant in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. I am truly honored to be a part of this incredible opportunity and to share my story so I can inspire other women facing this condition. POI and early menopause need to be discussed freely without the stigma of shame. We are not any less of a woman because of diagnosis. We are strong women! We are POI Warriors!‚Äù\n\n‚Äú6 months ago, I finally received a diagnosis for the increasing number of debilitating symptoms I have been suffering with for years. For the past 5 years I've been back and forth to the GP starting with me feeling depressed. I sat and cried to the GP telling her 'I'm not me anymore' and 'I don't know what's happening to me'. I was prescribed antidepressants and sent on my way. Within the next few months, I was driving along and fantasising about driving off the side of the mountain. I went back to the GP and she increased the dose of my antidepressants. I asked if it could be my hormones. Maybe menopause? She asked if I was still having periods and I told her I have the mirena coil so don't have periods. She said I was too young for the menopause (I was just coming up to 41) so I believed her.\n\nI started getting hot flushes but put this down to a side effect of my antidepressants so I reduced them back down. This didn't stop the flushes and my suicidal thoughts were getting worse. I then went back to the surgery and saw a different GP because I was having panic attacks. They came from nowhere. The final straw was when I had a massive panic attack in my car just because I was going to the hairdresser's. I literally couldn't do it.\n\nThe GP prescribed me diazepam which I initially refused as I know they're very addictive. He reassured me I would be fine. During this time, I decided to leave my partner of 7 years. I didn't even know why. I still loved him but my head was out of control and I just wanted to run away. I just spiralled further into depression. We did get back together but it was just one thing after another. Now I had this bad pain in my hip and lower back, I was waking up in a pool of sweat (which I still thought was a side effect from my antidepressants), I was dripping in sweat during the daytime even when I was outside in the middle of winter. I went back to the GP and again asked if I could be going through menopause. They took my blood but when I called for the results they came back 'normal'. I was also given prescription painkillers for my hip which had in large print that they were highly addictive.\n\nLast year was a massive turning point. I found myself researching symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer's. I was literally terrified and convinced myself I had early onset dementia or Alzheimer's because my memory had been getting worse by the week. I couldn't focus on anything. I couldn't even read a book because I kept having to read the same page over and over but it just wasn't registering. My work was suffering and I would sit looking at a screen wondering what I was supposed to be doing. I ended up going off sick for 2 months and was seriously considering giving up a job I loved because I just felt completely useless. I was supposed to be supporting people with mental health issues. How could I support people when I can't even remember their names half the time? Then one day I was pulling onto a big roundabout and literally had a complete brain fog and didn't know what I was doing. I couldn't remember the rules of the road for a minute (seconds really). It was the most frightening experience as I could have killed someone or myself. I'd been researching menopause and after this I made an urgent appointment at my go surgery and I diagnosed myself. Yes, I diagnosed myself. I explained to the GP all my symptoms and she agreed I may be right and asked what I would like to do about it. No advice at all. I asked about HRT and she told me to go away and think about it first and make an appointment for the following week to discuss it. I had been speaking to a colleague in work who was going through the same and just talking to her made my mind up that what I was going through was not just me going mad, I felt validated.\n\nThe following I week I started on HRT and over the next month I began to feel better than I had in 5 years. It was then that I put all the pieces together, joined the dots and realised that the past 5 years was due to perimenopause and could have been treated with HRT instead of multiple antidepressants, anxiety pills and prescription pain killers. Even the pain in my hip and back which had been getting worse and spreading throughout my body, was gradually easing and I could stop taking the painkillers. Who knew all these symptoms could be all related to the menopause? It seems the 3 different GP's I had seen numerous times over 5 years didn't know. Or did they? And if so, why did they never once consider it, mention it? It's left me so angry but also very determined to ensure that all women and girls are made aware of all the different symptoms and be brave enough to demand to be taken seriously. I honestly believe that, if I didn't have such a good support network around me, my kids may have been left without a mother.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLate 2014 aged 42, I started to experience debilitating depression. It came out of no-where, I couldn‚Äôt understand what was going on! I left my Husband (early 2015) of which I had been with since aged 19 years old, thinking it was the relationship and I couldn't continue on with the up and down moods of mine and nor could he, I thought something was totally missing and couldn't understand 'where I had gone'. It was like someone had totally unzipped me and I no longer felt like ‚Äòme‚Äô anymore. I was still having infrequent periods and at times these would be so heavy, I wouldn't want to leave the house.\n\nI met another man (since breaking up from husband), who turned out to be a narcissist although I wasn't aware of this until it was too late. He often would ridicule me when I had a heavy bleed and said my body odour had changed; now I know this is a side effect of the menopause, yet I didn't know I was in the menopause as I had always been told, you have to have no periods for a full 12 months before I could even consider that was a thing, but you can imagine at the time I was embarrassed and felt ashamed.\n\nDebilitating anxiety took over, lasting for many years and I started to have thoughts that' 'I WAS DONE'... I even started to plan how I was going to end it all, and would obsess over this daily (suicidal thoughts were so real yet I never spoke about these feelings with anyone). I kept myself isolated and masked my feelings and emotions for fear of embarrassment, lack of understanding and also, I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know about my thoughts, as family and friends would talk me out of it and I would still be left with an emptiness of having to live. It was strange because whenever I thought about leaving this world, I had this calm feeling about knowing that I wouldn't have to carry these feelings around with me anymore. I remember contacting my GP at the time and he immediately asked me to go and see him. When I spoke about my symptoms and thoughts, he referred me to a Mental Health facility to have an assessment with a member of the crisis team. I can‚Äôt say it was a pleasurable experience, I was subject to an intense 4 hours interview which focused on my mental health and afterwards it was agreed I could go home, as the assessment confirmed I wasn't a danger to myself. Maybe I masked my feelings well, yet I wasn't asked about anything else. I am grateful to my GP at the time, as he recognised, I did need some support, yet nothing was taken into account about the symptoms I was experiencing which mirrored peri-menopause. He said, on more than one occasion 'Michelle you are definitely not in the peri- menopause you are too young. Who was I to question a qualified doctor?\n\nAnxiety & depression continued for a long period, I changed so much in this time, I wasn't confident, happy or at peace with myself. I kept on reverting back to some old limiting beliefs from the past that I wasn‚Äôt good enough and started to have those recurring thoughts once more that my life had come to end, and to be totally real, it nearly did! I was having hot sweats, insomnia, a roller-coaster of negative emotions which seemed to last forever. I carried on coping on my own without any intervention for many years and experienced a total loss of myself and still every day I considered how I could end my life. Now with everyone saying I couldn't be in peri-menopause, I just accepted this, although unconsciously I kept questioning myself, could this be the start of the change? Who knew, it was never talked about and seemed to be a taboo subject back in the days, also was I too young like the doctor previously had said to me?\n\nFast forward to 2021, the depression was killing me, I was sad, unhappy and felt that something wasn‚Äôt quite right so I contacted my GP. I woke up that morning thinking this is the day I will leave this world, yet something inside of me encouraged me to reach out again to my GP (a different practice this time), this was 8am in the morning that I wrote; 'Please can someone contact me I am extremely low and depressed, I need to speak to a doctor urgently. A male GP called me at 16.05 the same day, and upon contacting me, I explained my symptoms and asked if I could be peri-menopausal or coming into the menopause, after all I had not had a period for approx. 11 months then. The male doctor then proceeded to say, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be silly‚Äô you are not in the menopause you are too young (at the time I was 48 years old I wasn't 49 yet as my birthday was months away) and asked me what anti-depressants did I wish for him to prescribe. WHAT....?? I was pouring my heart out to a doctor that I no-longer felt I could live; I was experiencing symptoms that mirrored the menopause and yet was told the only solution was anti-depressants and to choose the ones that I wanted and he would prescribe them. That‚Äôs when I thought I need to take some control! I could either end my suffering or take charge; now I was really angry, so I took charge. Anger wasn't an emotion that I had been experiencing and this ignited something inside me to start to find a solution. So, I contacted a private doctor who did a full history breakdown of my symptoms, what I was experiencing and confirmed I was in the menopause and prescribed medication to help me through this stage of my life. The private doctor wrote to my GP and they took over the medication prescription of providing me with HRT. HRT and Utrogestan I was on for 10 months. Now, fast forward to the beginning of this year 2022, I started to feel extremely unwell, fatigue and confusion, dizzy spells, chest pains and difficulty breathing with an irregular heat-beat; I was worried it could be the medication. I started to check my blood pressure daily, twice in the morning and the same in the evening. Once again, I was struggling mentally, emotionally and physically, as I was finding it hard to function daily. I reached out once again to my GP and ask if it could be the menopause medication and was met with a different approach, it could be that my blood pressure average which was 160/100 maybe causing these symptoms.\n\nAfter visiting the doctors in person and now on blood pressure medication, the doctor advised to come off the menopause prescription as I would be a high risk for having a stroke coupled with my family history of high blood pressure, strokes and heart-attacks, I had no choice to stop all my menopause medication. Frightened and confused as I wasn't prepared to go back to the debilitating symptoms that had led me to consider ending my life. What was I to do? I could either accept there was nothing I could do, or find a way to manage my menopausal symptoms without the medication. So, I did!!!\n\nToday, my message is clear ‚Äòyou‚Äô the strong women can manage your symptoms with or without medication as I have done, incorporating holistic healing and complementary therapies such as breath-work, hypnosis, meditation, yoga and much more. Many women (like myself) still need solutions day-to-day to help them overcome some of the debilitating symptoms that stops them from living life to the fullest. Because it all begins with YOU. ‚ÄòYou‚Äô to make a conscious decision to shape a healthy lifestyle and to look and feel your personal best. No-one knows you the best and you would never dismiss ways to solve your own problems, to stand in your personal power and be open to the limitless wellbeing potential you have when you are in charge. There is an empowerment among women reaching this phase of their lives, as so many women now are talking and educating others about the menopause, yet I still read and also experience the suffering of women. Many women know adopting a one size fits all, trial and error approach is outrageous, when we are talking about your life and body. So how do you take back your personal power, (like I did) take charge of and manage your own unique symptoms, if you don‚Äôt know how to with or without medication? I have made a conscious effort this year to educate myself and other women in mindful menopause techniques using holistic healing and complementary therapies such as self-Hypnosis, breath-work, meditation and the use of crystals specifically to help with the varying symptoms of the menopause. Now, I know that some of these may not appeal to all women, and that‚Äôs OK, all I know is that they have helped me in ways that have allowed me to manage my symptoms and I truly feel the best I have been since I have been working with these approaches. I wake up each day NOW, knowing that I can take charge of my symptoms and that makes me feel empowered, I am not saying that there aren't days NOW where I feel low, sad and tired, of course, we are women, who take care of everyone else before we care for ourselves, right? Yet, I am in a better place knowing that I have the ability to manage my own mental, emotional and physically symptoms through different holistic solutions and complementary approaches, which then becomes individualised to me rather than relying on the 'one-size fits all approach, that so many women often speak out and one that I have experienced too. I am so pleased to be here sharing my story, as I nearly wasn't! I AM Michelle a Midlife Menopausal women and I AM determined to make the change, to a better menopause - I AM worth it, and so ARE YOU!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHi everyone, I am now 49yrs old, I suffer with chronic migraine and have done since I was 20. What I now recognise as peri-menopause symptoms started around 43, I literally could not keep warm, I went to my Drs as I was feeling very tired all the time. They did a blood test and found that my Iron level was through the floor, I was given tablets to try and increase it but it didn't work, a couple of years passed with many many blood tests that then showed Zinc deficiency, Iron deficiency anaemia, Vitamin D deficiency. My GPs were totally baffled by what was causing any of these.\n\nI had every test under the sun, x3 Endoscopy and colonoscopy, several specialists one of who diagnosed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I really knew this wasn't what was wrong with me but the GP and I (my GPs practice are fabulous) didn't know what was wrong, we came to the conclusion that I had an auto immune problem.\n\nAfter all those tests I eventually got Iron infusions which helped a little but not really the change you would have hoped. This takes me to being 45/46 at this point I went through a very upsetting breakup and was crying all the time, I just couldn't stop crying it was really unlike me, the previous 12 months I had days where I just felt so down for no apparent reason. I suffer from Migraine and therefore get migraine hangover also PMT is relevant. I carried on with no idea what was going on at that time (if only I had known that it was peri-menopause then next three years my migraine just got worse and worse, one would end and I was recovering and another would start! I got to the point where they were every 5-7days, as you can imagine my brain fog was constant along with suffering with cognition issues (both of these things happen with Migraine) I worked for myself, I had done for years and this is quite fortunate for me that I was. I have no idea if I could have coped with how ill I was and still worked.\n\nOther symptoms were anxiety (I have never been overly anxious, driving anxiety (I love driving and have gone all over the country most of my life), and a lot of weight gain. When I was 43 I started to exercise more and more but by the time I got to 47 I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore I literally had no energy or motivation, so I piled on 4 stone, increased urination, cold all the time, low mood, sadness. In the last 3 yrs we sadly had a global pandemic that stopped everything but not my peri- menopause symptoms and Migraines.\n\nI have worked from home for years so that didn‚Äôt change but my Migraine just got worse and worse, I decided to speak to my GP about this and we tried preventative medicine, sadly this didn‚Äôt work and gave me another problem to deal with (stomach pain) so we reverted back to Rizatriptan and paracetamol. The last 12 months 2021/2022 some of the early symptoms are less but I have new ones like thinning hair, hair growth on my chin, my periods have gone to every 3 weeks, aches, fatigue, low motivation, I started to do a lot of research online about trying to control my migraine and peri-menopause came up as a factor, I did some research on that and started listening to the ‚ÄúHeadsup‚Äù podcast (which is amazing) I did more and more research and started to understand that HRT would 100% help with a lot of things, so I contacted my GP and got what I needed. Estrogen and Progesterone separate not combined as that is contra indicated for Migraine, I am on the waiting list for a referral to get Testosterone, in this time both of Davina McCall‚Äôs C4 programmes came out which again was really really helpful, I have only just started the HRT and I am hoping to get my energy back then I can exercise more and feel better. Sadly, not once was Peri-menopause even on anyone‚Äôs mind, given the I have seen several specialists, my GP board met to discuss what was wrong, there really does need to be more education and understanding, this is terrible for women to go through. I hope this helps someone suffering to recognise and get the help they need. It‚Äôs worth noting, I am 100% teetotal (I always have been) I don‚Äôt drink tea or coffee, I don‚Äôt take drugs, I have never smoked so none of these are factors that can make symptoms worse for both Migraine and Peri-menopause.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú10 years ago at age 40 my anti-depressants stopped working. I went to the coast for a walk with my family to try to lift my spirits; because that would always work in the past if I was feeling tired and low; but I just felt flat. I remember sitting on a bench and feeling exhausted and telling my family I would wait for them as they wanted to walk further; and I felt sadness and panic that my tablets and fresh air that had always helped me; weren‚Äôt working for my depression.\n\nLater on in the summer we went to France and I kept feeling like the usual joy I felt on my holidays was lower than normal. I kept thinking that the country wasn‚Äôt as hot as our last holiday abroad; or my second glass of lager wasn‚Äôt lifting my spirits in the usual way because the type of holiday was more sedate than the party atmosphere of the Spanish islands.\n\nI spent a summer going on trips out with my tween girls, thinking the lack of motivation and energy I felt was just the unusually extended greyness of the summer here in 2012. It was only in September when my period that had been so regular for years came 4 days early, that I wondered if it was hormonal and came across stuff online about menopause. I bumped into my child‚Äôs friend‚Äôs mum who on a particularly anxious super market shop, when we got chatting, told her about how tired I was; and as she was older and lovely (thought she might be going through same) I brought up my periods and exhaustion and she recommended agnus castus; which made my periods go back to every 28 days and stopped my depression for 18 months.\n\nAll I can think is that my hormones had shifted again; the agnus castus had worked temporarily but not on the awful pains I would get in my legs if I tried to move after sitting down for a while, or the sensitive bladder I had developed. I then tried Maca which amazingly plumped up my shrivelled lady‚Äôs bits; that had shockingly happened in my early forties when the agnus castus stopped working.\n\nThat was an awful time; I remember thinking my sex drive had disappeared and my husband would leave me; even though he is a lovely man; I was just having such dark paranoid thoughts. I would feel like I didn‚Äôt want to touch him in case it led to him thinking I wanted sex.\n\nAfter another 18 months the maca stopped working and I went to the doctors to ask for HRT; but was told by a male doctor I was too young; even after saying my mum had been just 4 years older than me when she finished her periods. He just repeated that he still thought I was too young. I went to a lovely lady doctor who gave me the pill; but I gave up with that because it made me feel so swollen and uncomfortable. I tried two lots of the coil, but it fell out both times, so had to eventually try the HRT patch, which only made me feel swollen very occasionally. I think transdermal HRT has less side effects than the pill.\n\nI have been dealing with incredibly heavy periods throughout my forties and was borderline anaemic so had iron tablets. Once my iron was ok, I still felt brain fogged and weary a lot of the time; and have not been able to exercise a lot as my muscles can seize up really quickly when walking; so, I just live this kind of half-life of not working, not being able to do the degree I always wanted to do because my brain is so foggy, I can‚Äôt even follow a recipe. I am grateful for my amazing girls and my husband as I have felt that for 10 years, I have had chronic fatigue, but because of its stigma and my doctor not always being the easiest to talk to, although very helpful at times; I have limited what I tell her; and I continue to rely on my husband‚Äôs wage to live. I have lost touch with friends and to a certain extent extended family as they have blanked me when I have mentioned feeling ill. They think I am avoiding them when often I just don‚Äôt have any energy to spend time with my younger nieces and nephew. Nobody wants an exhausted aunt around.\n\nSo, the HRT takes the edge off my symptoms and allows me to manage a very limited existence, but I think if I could ask and was given testosterone that it would help. I am afraid to bring it up with my doctor though because I am fearful that pushing too much will make her reconsider taking me off the HRT I am on. I am grateful to Carolyn Harris MP and Davina for keeping on pushing so that people like me who feel low in confidence and motivation might one day get the testosterone I think some of us need. I‚Äôm afraid it might take my entire 50s until testosterone is available to women in menopause.\n\nI wish all doctors and MP‚Äôs would watch the doctor who works with Louise Newson‚Äôs video about testosterone, and how in around three quarters of menopausal women it‚Äôs too low. She says she thinks the women who cope with menopause better are the quarter who have higher testosterone at this age; so they will have more energy to exercise and manage their symptoms in peri menopause. I‚Äôm not saying the last 10 years have been awful as being ill has given me time to be with my girls and listen to them as teenagers; and also being unable to often leave the sofa has meant I have been there for them, and understood more their struggles with ill health. I am now afraid that part of me has changed so much that being more like who I used to be; (an energetic sexually active wife) is so far from who I am now that it seems scary. Part of me also feels bad for my husband that our sex life has been non-existent and he‚Äôs had to get used to that over the years; it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to suddenly change back to who I was 10 years ago.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen pregnant with my second child at the age of 38, I was told I have a large (11-12cm) fibroid, which lead to me giving birth via C section. After giving birth my periods became extremely heavy. I have always suffered with break through bleeding, spotting after sex, but since giving birth, sex was now becoming so painful, I physically couldn‚Äôt. I was always needing a wee, I would work out a toilet plan where ever I went and the thought of not having a toilet nearby sent anxiety through me, my tiredness was like being in those early weeks of pregnancy, it was unbearable.\n\nApprox 6 months after giving birth I went to see my gynaecologist, we talked through my systems and he asked if my husband and I were considering having more children, after a fairly tricky birth with the fibroid we said probably not. This was the point where my gynaecologist told me that a potential hysterectomy would be good to stop all my ongoing symptoms and why keep my uterus if I didn‚Äôt need it anymore. It was so dismissive, like it was such an easy decision to make. We decided to try the coil as a form of contraception and have a biopsy of my uterus to see if there was anything else wrong.\n\nAfter going back and forth to a couple of gynaecologists and my weeing problem getting ridiculous and debilitating, I was giving an internal examination and told I could be going incontinent, which if I was it would mean surgery.\n\nWith all these problems in place, I was told the best option was to have a hysterectomy.\n\nIn 2017, I had a sub-total hysterectomy, due to my age they decided to leave my ovaries in place. It was found during surgery that I had two very large fibroid, endometriosis and my bowel and bladder were fused together. No wonder I was it finding life hard, there was a lot going on inside of me.\n\nI was discharged from hospital with no mention of my body going into early menopause, or any symptoms I may start to feel.\n\nAfter 6 weeks I had a check, was told should I get any bleeding, progesterone could be prescribed to help me.\n\nAfter a few months, I noticed I was having some sort of period still, but was suffering from hot sweats/flashes. I was told to go on the contraceptive pill and have CBT therapy.\n\nOvertime, my moods changed, I suffered with hot sweats, lack of sleep, no libido, dry skin, brain fog, anxiety.\n\nI was sent to hospital in 2020 as I had extreme chest pains so much that I couldn‚Äôt move, I felt like I had a continual lump in my throat, I think this was actually anxiety.\n\nI suffered until 2021, when I paid privately to go on a bio identical therapy, which helped no end, but long term I couldn‚Äôt afford to keep up with this treatment.\n\nI was and am now still suffering with pains in my left hand side, where my ovaries are, the pain I can only describe as like contractions. So I called my GP to say I‚Äôm in more pain than I was pre-surgery. I explained I‚Äôd be on bio identical therapy and after the seeing Davina McCall program could she provide me with HRT, finally they agreed.\n\nIf it wasn‚Äôt for your program I would have thought I was depressed, because that‚Äôs what it felt like, my anger towards my husband and kids was unacceptable, my marriage was on the rocks, I felt like giving up and then your program brought me a ray of light in a very dark tunnel.\n\nI continue on HRT, although still in pain, I feel so much better than I did, I wish I could get on top of the fatigue, it‚Äôs crippling some days. But I‚Äôm much better on HRT than off and I don‚Äôt want my family, husband or I to suffer any longer than necessary.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú.My story started 3 years ago when I was 40. My periods got so heavy that it massively affected my ability at work. As a PE teacher in a primary school, I often had to abandon classes and go home to change and my confidence was rock bottom. I spoke to my GP and over the phone she prescribed the mini pill without any discussion of the perimenopause. I naively thought I was cured. Fast track 2 years and symptoms started to creep in that I thought were due to other factors. Rage, anxiety, low mood, paranoia, tinnitus, hair loss. The list went on but thinking it was to do with lockdown I did nothing. Until my sister in law pointed me in the direction of Dr Naomi Potter and I watched and read her posts, often crying because I related to it all.\n\nI contacted my GP immediately and they were reluctant to see me. Even though I said it was to treat the peri, they kept saying I was too young to have HRT for the menopause. They were looking at it as just THE MENOPAUSE and not the different stages. I found myself having educate them and finally after being prescribed anti depressants, my GP asked me what I wanted. I then started on Estrogel but she failed to prescribed progesterone so I had to go back and tell her I needed that too. Her words were, you can have it but watch out for the side effects. All of my appointments over the last year, unless they were for bloods, have been by email.\n\nI instantly felt better and some symptoms went altogether but my low mood and loss of libido still lingered over me like a dark cloud. I wrote desperate emails to my GP after hearing about testosterone and it‚Äôs benefits. This was one of my lowest points as I was embarrassed and felt completely alone. Her response was there was nothing they could do apart from refer me to couples therapy!! My partner had been extremely patient but this was not his doing and I felt completely let down. Why was there this drug available to some but not all? I sent more desperate emails and eventually they referred me to a gynaecologist who prescribed the testosterone! Now my fight is actually getting the prescription as my GP still won‚Äôt prescribe it and I go back and fourth from each dr both telling me there‚Äôs nothing they can do!\n\nAll we want is to be happy, healthy and not lose ourselves along this path to our maturer years. I have now made so many changes to my lifestyle to embrace this change but I want help from the professionals too and I actually don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too much to ask for.\n\nIt feels like we are being left on the shelf to become a former shell of ourselves and I don‚Äôt want that for me. I will keep fighting for what we need. The evidence is there, we just need the right people to listen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI started getting symptoms at the age of 36 these were gradual and I would just dismiss them, or think it was down to endemitriosis, which was diagnosed at age 28. At 37 my mood was so low and kept going to the Drs with different symptoms. I had blood tests and was told I could be peri menopausal. However, nothing was offered to me. I saw another Dr a little while later as I started thinking I had ovarian cancer due to constant bloating irregular periods and the constant need to pee. I had more blood tests and was told I couldn‚Äôt be peri menopauseal because of my age. This left me completely confused as the other Dr told me my blood results could indicate this earlier on. I went away very confused. I am now 41 years old I have had so many blood tests been to the Drs so many times. I have been made to have a laperoscopy and a hysteroscopy all the while I have argued I know my body please give me HRT but instead of even been tried on it I have been told\n\nI have had to have all these procedures which have all shown nothing wrong. My periods have a cycle of between 15 days and 60+ days sometimes I have two in one month sometimes none at all. I have anxiety like never in my life low mood which I refused anti depressants several times. I have had insomnia no labido, constant headaches, itchy skin, bleeding gums, amongst other symptoms but by far the worst was thinking I was going mad. I have felt like I knew more than the Drs telling them you can‚Äôt necessarily diagnose peri menopausal symptoms by blood test yet being made to have them over and over again and then the Drs left scratching their heads. I felt like a medical mystery all these symptoms yet no obvious cause. It was obvious to me and I have had to fight for years to be heard. At 41 I am now on HRT patches a few months in and my symptoms are slightly relieved yet I still feel I need testosterone. I am still struggling with fatigue and low labido infact I just have very little interest in sex with my partner. He is very supportive but he‚Äôs seen my in some terrible states from feeling suicidal to me not wanting him to touch me which makes him feel rejected. I am still some days anxious and don‚Äôt want to be around people. I am early days on treatment and hoping eventually I will be back to my old self again. There needs to be better education for Drs the government need to do more to support woman at what ever age they start to go through this, I clearly was not too young. If anything it‚Äôs worse being peri menopausal and still having periods which are irregular and very unpredictable. Testosterone needs to be available to woman we loose 3 hormones yet are only given 2 back which makes no sense. I‚Äôm telling my story because it has deeply impacted my life, and needs to be told. It‚Äôs affected my relationships my chances of work after graduating and my ability to work with all the suffering I have endured. Listen to your body it‚Äôs smarter than we are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am 51. I had a total hysterectomy 4 years ago ovaries/all removed. I suspected I was menopausal in my late 30‚Äôs and at that point was totally reliable on reading up on things on Google. My doctor did an FSH test once but that was it. I changed surgeries several years ago due to something not related to this and struck lucky as my new doctor (or at least the lady I just happened to be booked in with when I first joined), is/was very up on everything menopause related. Her and her colleague go for regular training I believe. The only thing is it‚Äôs very difficult to get in with her.\n\nI was offered anti depressants at one point several years ago but didn‚Äôt take them as felt that wasn‚Äôt right for me.\n\nI started low dose hrt tablets a few months after my hysterectomy. This was because I went to the doctors and asked for it. I wasn‚Äôt offered it at the hospital or doctors after my hysterectomy. It wasn‚Äôt discussed at all at the hospital. Again, it was only through Google (and through a Facebook group I had joined just before the op), that I realised I should be on HRT.\n\nI went through different dosages to try and get on top of symptoms, they had to give me different names of tablets due to shortages a couple of years ago. I had to drive around several pharmacies to get them and have always tried to get them a little while before I need them in case I hasn‚Äôt a problem. I don‚Äôt want to be without the HRT. I went on to Evorel 50 patches in August and although I am starting to get a bit hot again and not and don‚Äôt sleep well still, I feel like a different woman. More positive, less angry and less mood swings. Also more energy.\n\nI‚Äôm so pleased there is so much discussion about it now. It really helps. I don‚Äôt have children but I hope the next generations of women get a lot more help.\n\nReally hoping I can get the patches when I run out in a few months. Luckily I got 6 months supply this time. It has previously been 3 months for the patches. Possibly because I am fairly new to them. I know some women only get a one month supply. That would never work for me as I am away with work a fair bit.\n\nLooking back to maybe 5-10 years ago, I can definitely say that the fatigue, general feeling of being unwell with it, and mood swings /anger, all affected my job. I am freelance in a private aviation industry and think there have been missed opportunities where I could have had permanent jobs or regular work at some places, but just didn‚Äôt feel up to it.\n\nI wish someone could have told me I could take HRT before the menopause. I also want to find out if I can have a combination of oestrogen and testosterone /progesterone from my doctor next time instead of oestrogen. As you can see from my writing testosterone/progesterone, I am still not sure about the options or correct wording, even after all of this time on it and reading about it!\n\nMum (who is 85), was on HRT tablets for a while when she was younger but didn't get on with them so I remember her always advising me against them. I had a number of gynae issues over the years, including Endometriosis quite badly in late 20‚Äôs/30‚Äôs. Female doctor dealing with that told me off the record never to go on HRT. This would have been around 15 years ago when it was, I believe, a different sort of HRT, that also got bad press generally and most of us were too worried to take it because we were worried about breast cancer or other health issues that may arise from taking it back then. That still exists a bit but not so much for me as my doctor explained a lot of stuff to me and showed me a very interesting comparison poster online that showed risks if you drink, smoked, are overweight etc.\n\nI think it‚Äôs vital that women of my age talk about it and know more about it because our mums weren‚Äôt generally given any help, it was a taboo subject and also resulted in a lot of them even saying to this day things like ‚ÄúI was ok, I got by without it, what‚Äôs the big fuss about running out of HRT etc‚Äù. I am very grateful for all of these forums etc. Times are changing, and hopefully they can get this awful and unnecessary shortage situation sorted out asap too.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI started feeling out of control, not coping with life at all and breaking down in tears all the time, forgetting the simplest things that were previously easy, i had worked hard in my career in HR and raising my son and suddenly i just couldnt cope. I was also having horrendous heavy periods and had often had to go home during work to shower and change. I saw my gp who told me i was depressed and prescribed anti depressants but i told him i didnt want them. Fast forward a couple of years and many appointments later and i was also having blood tests every 3 months for underactive thyroid (my levels werent low enough so no medication until they were) i remember a particular male gp, who was really nice, and when he told me i was also peri menopausal and it was something i just had to get through and i broke down in tears as he said i could try over the counter remedies as they don't recommend hrt, and to expect other symptoms such as a dry vagina, i looked at him through the snot and tears and said \"well thank you very much and i left\" despondent. My next appointment for blood tests i saw a wonderful gp who immediately referred me to endocrinology and i started on the thyroid treatment journey (another type of very similar hell) and found out i also had hashimoto thyroditis. Probably a couple of years later i had taken redundancy at work which was timed perfectly as i just wasnt coping at all. I went for a walk along the river and i had seen a new podcast from the menopause doctor so started to listen, the very first one and dr newson was describing a patient who was a professional successful women with a family who found she couldnt cope with life, i remember throwing my arms in the air with a \"wow\" and saying \"this is me\"! Blew my mind and i proceeded to check out her website as this was prior to the balance app, and once i was fully armed i called my new gp surgery as i had moved, i asked for an appointment with a menopause doctor or one that specialises in female health, this was made very easily and when the appointment came and i sat down opposite her, i calmly informed her i had been suffering for around 8 years with peri menopausal symptoms, had done my research on dr newsons website I wanted to be prescribed HRT as i was struggling to cope, i was calm, composed and determined because i was empowered with the right information and she immediately started the process of prescribing it. I breathed a huge sigh of relief just because I felt i was seen and heard, a few months followed where the tablets just didnt work for me and made me nauseous and headaches and i was then given the mirena coil and patches! Hallelujah\n\nThen came the shortages of hrt and the nail biting anxiety when dreading collecting my prescription and the numberous times they had run out. I have wept in the chemist in dispair on numerous occasions and refused to leave until they told me what was available and liased with my gp to get replacements. I know it wasnt the fault of the pharmacist but my local one just treated me like i was an irritant and were so rude i asked my gp to send them elsewhere, and now i collect them from another pharmacy who are really very nice.\n\nI have wept talking to doctors receptionists when trying to chase my gp for replacement hrt when they have ran out. It makes me so angry that its allowed and expected that women just need to go through it, and replacing the depleted hormones can make such a massive difference in your health and quality of life, the number of women over 50 who reduce their working hours or stop working is unfathomable to me. I also appreciate we are the first generation of women who openly talk about menopause as it has previously been pushed under the carpet as a taboo subject, i have older friends who recoil if the subject comes up as they are embarrassed, this is awful.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGoing through peri menopause / menopause was horrendous. And years and years out of my life. Going to the doctors crying I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me and being given anti depressants. Not aware it was menopause related. Heavy periods where I would be soaked with blood in work and taking in changes of clothes. One flight from India and I felt everything come away from me. I managed to get spare clothes out my hand luggage and I was in the toilet absolutely not able to stop the bleeding from running away with me which may have been not helped by the air pressure ....... who knows, not me But was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I didn‚Äôt know enough about symptoms to know any better. Exhaustion sleepless nights and brain fog doesn‚Äôt and the feeling of tiredness. Overwhelming tiredness.\n\nI didn‚Äôt go on HRT as all I knew about it was it is a risk of getting breast cancer!! Well at 62 I was diagnosed with oestrogen based breast cancer. First thing they said is ‚Äúdid you take HRT‚Äù. No I bloody never I felt like screaming and I suffered for years and still got bloody breast cancer. I‚Äôm not sure what was worse the diagnosis or the realisation I may have suffered for nothing!!!\n\nWell now two years later and I‚Äôm on Antrozole to take out the oestrogen - what‚Äôs left of it out of my body to reduce the risk of my breast cancer coming back. Bloody hell im going through the menopause symptoms again and at this moment in time it‚Äôs 2.46am. I have been signed off work as I was like crazy employee of the year. Changes in our ICT system was like the last tipping point to my meltdown as not enough communication together with not enough time to work it out with brain fog the inevitable happened I broke down on the phone to my doctor. I am a wreck who is trying to cover up being a wreck and cos I am trying to function for the sake of everyone I feel like my inside is screaming.\n\nPlease Davina in your quest to raise this profile also include us BC patients on tablets to take out the oestrogen and get doctors to give me and fellow sufferers the percentage of risk of reoccurrence vs no tablets and quality of life. Or maybe alternatives. Let us have the information to make informed choices. I am so please you have raised this issue and as we all live longer and our daughters will benefit from what you are doing and raising the awareness.\n\nPs the Julia Bradbury documentary on her breast cancer was also brill and I would like to know what research she has done on the tablets as I think she may have had the same diagnoses and be put on tablets as she mentioned this at the very end of the documentary.\n\nYou are such a star for raising this profile and also other ladies in the media who are supporting this. Let‚Äôs hope it makes the difference. Thanks you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWith the benefit of hindsight and education through this and other sites such as menopause doctor, I realise I was going through peri menopause for 8 years before actually stopping my periods. In that time I had what I now know are typical symptoms such as dry itchy skin, brain fog, increased migraines and joint pain. I visited my gp with these symptoms suspecting menopause but was told I was ‚Äúprobably over using thyroxine‚Äù. I had a total thyroidectomy in my early 30s. I argued that I had been advised by the surgeons who treated me at that time had said when I was menopausal I should be referred back to endocrinologists. I asked for this but explicably I was referred to a rheumatologist who couldn‚Äôt understand why he was examining me but at least was able to prescribe drops for my dry eyes. Five years later and with increasing symptoms and now erratic periods I started to have hot flushes and revisited my gp who again said it was probably because my thyroxine was too high and reduced my dose. A year on and struggling with low thyroxine levels and increasing conviction I was now menopausal I returned to my gp to ask for HRT without knowing what I should have or understanding much about my options. I explained how slow, overweight and unhappy the low thyroxine was making me feel, along with up to 40 severe hot flushes a day, poor sleep, all the other symptoms and now no periods. I had another lecture about thyroxine and was offered anti depressants which I rejected out of hand as I was not depressed. I finally managed to get a referral to endocrinologists who confirmed my thyroxine dose should be put back up and that I was menopausal. I struggled on with hot flushes and brain fog affecting my work decisions and ability to perform especially in meetings. If I was ever on the back foot or challenged on something I found myself unable to think quickly enough to form a meaningful reply. Something which had never been an issue previously. This led to some very critical and highly personal feedback which crushed my self confidence at work despite being in a senior leadership role. The crunch came when I was in a meeting to dismiss a colleague and was so overcome with hot flushes - red sweating and breathless - that the subject of the meeting was more concerned about me than about the end of their employment. Immediately after that meeting I went to my gp in tears to beg for HRT. I was given an appointment with a different doctor who seemed to know more than the others and was amenable. I was prescribed evorel conti patches as by now I was over a year without periods. They have been life changing mostly in the reduction of hot flushes and improved quality of sleep. Brain fog is better but not gone and my skin hair and eyes are still horrifically dry. I haven‚Äôt been able to wear contact lenses for 7 years now due to the dryness of my eyes. I‚Äôm sure my hips have suffered from the delay in receiving HRT as I have constant pain. However I can now function as a mother, a manager ( in a new role) and a person thanks to the HRT patches‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am 49 years old. Since I was 39 I have struggled with sleep, mood swings, cyclical depression urination urgency and urinating up to 10 times a night.\n\nI was tested for several worrying conditions: ? Ovarian cysts or ? Ovarian cancer, ? Bowel problems. I had weight gain, even when dieting, hair loss and no sleep also. I must have visited the GP more than a dozen times. I've had chest X rays, ultrasound scans on my bladder, ovaries, colon. I've been at my wit's end and no one was able to find anything to give a firm diagnosis...I was left thinking that it was all in my head and making it up !\n\nIt was just last September, 2021, age 48 & 9 years on from my first symptoms that a friend startedHRT and parts of her story resonated with me. I bought two menopause books and it was clear to me that I was in the perimenopause.. after extensive research and after reaching Rock bottom with mood swings, depression and exhaustion- I was literally desperate for a diagnosis or help.\n\nI then had a telephone appointment with a GP at my practice. I had never met her before so to have a conversation over the phone with a stranger about very intimate, embarrassing symptoms was hard in a 5 min phone call. I told them I would like vagifem for my urinary problems and HRT...ideally gel or spray oestrogen.\n\nI was given standard HRT patches to start with and the GP said this was the first line of treatment and that I need a follow up appointment in 3 months.\n\nI started with patches and vagifem. The vagifem literally worked after two or three days...this was amazing! Sadly, I sank deeper and deeper I to misery and still lack of sleeping...I would say my symptoms were scarily heightened within two weeks of using these patches.\n\nThe GP had told me to wait three months but I could only manage three weeks - fortunately I was wise enough to seek further help at this point as I don't know what I should have done if I continued with how I was feeling on these patches. By the time I started the progesterone patches, I was so deep into misery and depression that 8 felt I could no longer cope.\n\nI tried to get a GP appointment and there wasn't an appointment with a GP specialising in menopause for 8 weeks. I don't think I would have survived 8 more weeks of these patches that were deepening my symptoms further.\n\nI did a search on the internet and found a local, private menopause clinic and promptly made an appointment. Two weeks and ¬£130 lighter, I had had the most amazing face to face appointment with a private specialist who listened to me, reassured me, advised that I most likely had a sensitivity towards synthetic progesterones which were potentially what were making my symptoms reach crisis point. I started on Lenzetto spray, ugesterone with a review in 3 months. Within 3 weeks my mood swings were better, relationships less touchy, less depression, anger and urinating at night had really eased, constipation resolved, hair loss had stopped but still not sleeping!\n\nI spoke with my specialist and she suggested increasing my Lenzetto during the worst periods of my lack of sleep which was the week leading up to ovulation until after my period.\n\nRoll on 6 months and I am now in a happier place, moods sorted, no longer argumentative/raging moods, no longer depressed, however I still don't sleep 3 weeks out of four! My next review increased my Lenzetto to 4 sprays from the week leading up to ovultion until my period has started and she has now prescribed female testosterone.\n\nThree weeks in to the new regime and testosterone: I am sleeping. 3 days into using the testosterone my inability to sleep has nearly resolved....9 years of not sleeping I am a little anxious to say this has resolved in case I jinx it but the past two weeks I have definitely slept (possibly woken once in the night for a wee).\n\nCoupled with this new regime, I have also changed my diet through a course with a specialist menopause nutritionist and have increased my protein intake to stop me waking through the night through ? Low blood sugar.\n\nI am still not 100% me again but I can tell you the depression, anxiety and rage ( 3 of my 4 main symptoms) have nearly resolved. Sleep I am pretty sure is on the road to recovery.\n\nMy next part to tackle is weight loss but I am sure that with testosterone now on board, my metabolism will increase and weight loss will commence - fingers crossed!\n\nIt's been a long and painful journey but I can now see light at the end of the tunnel! The sad thing is that my GP won't accept the prescription request from my specialist to prescribe me Lenzetto and ugesterone on the NHS. Sadly, I am forced to pay private prescription prices, (which on an NHS Midwife salary, it's a struggle to pay for just to feel normal and cope with life) because my GP surgery will not prescribe it based on a private Dr‚Äôs diagnosis/recommendation. I still have a battle ahead of me but because of my new HRT regime, I feel I have a little more strength to fight this fight!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am a 57 year old woman who nearly lost the plot and spiralled into the lowest depths of despair and agony. For the most part I have suffered in silence, ensuring to the outer world that every day was business as usual, but it was not. Beneath that smile was a woman who gradually became numb and dead to the outer world, pushing away much loved friends and family as I could not hold a conversation, I became irritated by what others would say, my brain and memory began to fail, the brain fog was constant, I was hearing things that were not being said and took it the wrong way.\n\nOver the last two years, my body became alien to me. I was never skinny (well at birth I was as I weighed only 5 pounds!), but in my 50s my mid-rift spread a lot more, some of my hair fell out, my skin became dry and oh god I became a bearded lady - forever plucking those relentless hairs that appeared under my chin, oh and yes on my bottom! I felt undesirable and shuddered at a mere touch or embrace from my beloved husband, even though he says he desires and loves me as I am and what size I am. I would laugh at him and say the obvious that he wanted me out of desperation.\n\nAs a woman I was and still holding on to the job I really love and reserved most of my energy into preserving this - well we all need money and I am saving for retirement! But my body was fighting me at every twist and turn. Headaches, body on fire with aches and pains, sleepless nights, night and day sweats, mood swings, the exhaustion was debilitating, I could barely get from bedroom to bathroom, I was on my knees. Like most women I went to the doctors and had copious blood tests/MRI scans and other various procedures. Only to be told they all looked normal, so it is all in my head and perhaps I am depressed. No I am not depressed I said on numerous occasions. I am a woman who has everything going for her, loving husband, brilliant job and loving family. I am exasperated at having to fight symptoms night and day. I discussed with the GPs that perhaps its the beginning of the menopause, this was refuted and two years ago they declined to test for this. Even a year without periods and me asking to be put on HRT was refused - again take antidepressants said the male GP.\n\nWith this I gave up for a while and painfully soldiered on. But for a while I also did research on HRT/Menopause and thought this all makes sense, this is what is happening to me.\n\nWell 11 weeks ago I hit rock bottom after numerous pleas with the doctor still hit on deaf ears! I began to emotionally unravel both at home and at work. At one point during what you would call a normal conversation about family finance, I felt confusion, frustration and loss which was unfounded, but completely took over me. I began to gauge deep with my nails into my own flesh from the wrist to half way up my arms, blood pouring out, frightening my husband. As for me I felt nothing but an out of body experience and a disassociation with my body and brain, I felt no pain. At that point my mind, body and spirit flatlined in that one dreadful moment. I was no longer functioning as a human being, let alone a woman.\n\nMy husband booked a visit to the GP, In front of my husband as witness I cried and begged the GP for HRT, he still insisted on giving me sertraline. Even though I knew I was not depressed I agreed to give it a try, along with the agreement that I would take time to rest, I was signed off work for 4 weeks. My body rejected this as they had not checked the other medication that I was on. I had horrendous hallucinations, the face in the bathroom mirror looking back at me, was not me, it was distorted a gargoyle and moving and speaking back to me. I was a screaming strange mess that my 23 year old daughter had to placate and settle down. She called 111 for advice - you guessed it, come off the sertraline as it was not compatible with other medications. This again warranted a conversation with my GP. I did'nt have the energy to ask why he had not checked my current medication and compatibility. Again I mentioned HRT. Oh no not yet the male GP cried, try Citilopram! Take a few more weeks off and try these. Worn out and on my knees, I agreed. Hubby dutifully arrives at the chemist to pick these up and was told - Oh no she can't have these as again they interfere with my other medications!\n\nOn the phone to the male GP again, I was told to ignore the chemist the reaction is not founded in such a small dose. At this point wearily I silently agree to proceed to purchase and take the antidepressants. I don't. I have had enough of not being listened to and I certainly was not inviting a further trip to a land of hallucination. Enough was enough and with the last effort and push in me I resolved to ignore my male GP's advice, he simply did not understand.\n\nThe following day I emailed the surgery clearly asking to be put on HRT. The request was signposted to an adjacent GP practice who run a once a month menopause clinic at my GP surgery! I was phoned by a lovely lady GP running this monthly clinic who, listened, empathised with me and agreed I should have been referred earlier. She looked at my recent blood results that clearly showed that I was in menopause. The relief of being listened to and finally believed resulted in a complete collapse of tears. The lovely GP said if she could give me a pound for every lady that has shared my experience she would be rich. She has heard the same story, many a times. Most GP's male and female have not received sufficient training on menopause and how to recognise and treat symptoms from the earliest stages.\n\n3 weeks ago I was prescribed Estrogel and progesterone and told to use 2 pumps of Estrogel daily along with the progesterone tablet in the evening. Fantastic I thought, I have hope! But now the next battle begins, accessing the HRT. My prescription goes to ASDA. My husband tried to pick up the medication, but was told that they did not have it and would not be receiving this for a while. But I should go back to my GP and ask for something else. I can't tell you how devastated I was. I was pinning all my hopes on this, so I cried buckets of tears through exhaustion, I was defeated again from treatment. The following day I rang alternative chemists along with my husband. Several tries later we found a chemist who had Estrogel. My husband dutifully took the prescription and was told - Oh it says for two pumps, therefore you need to ask your GP to give you 2 prescriptions as we can only give you one pump per prescription as its rare to get hold of. Again we waited 2 days for a new prescription to be done and picked this up from the surgery. We successfully managed to obtain one pump, so I began to use as directed.\n\nA week later after many other phone calls and my husband going into pharmacies around Surrey, he managed to find a pharmacy in London who gave him the other Estrogel. This should not be happening, apart from the fact that it should be readily stocked, not having it will have an effect on many a woman needing to use this.\n\nI am 3 weeks in now using HRT, my mood is beginning to lift and I no longer feel suicidal, I know up until now I have not mentioned the S word, but I was rock bottom and at times felt that not being here was for the best. But now thank god, I feel that there is hope. By no means am I feeling like myself as it is early days yet and my lovely GP says it can take up to 3 months to begin to take full effect. But I can feel a change, be it a small glimmer.\n\nThe experience of menopausal symptoms shattered the strong person I was, I once said mind over matter, but now I believe that your health and body matter, because without that you won't have a body to put that mind in to actually matter! The whole journey to be listened to by my GP has had a detrimental effect, so much so that I shattered physically and mentally. I am slowly re-building my body, my mind and soul and I believe it is down to HRT. I am not yet strong enough to go back to work because of what has happened, I still feel broken inside, but I am slowly mending and putting the pieces of ME back together.\n\nI know that not all of this story will read well, not make sense, I feel amongst everything else I have lost the art of stringing sentences together, but that is because I still have brain fog and some symptoms - but as I said it is still early days!\n\nFor those of you considering HRT give it a go! Fight your GP for the right to be heard, taken seriously and prescribed HRT. Stay strong. Believe in yourself and take care!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was told at 19 I'd go through early menopause and it still took doctors until I was 29 to do a simple blood test to see where my Hormone levels were at. I had about 7 terrible, horrible, horrendous years of symptoms and all my GP would prescribed was antidepressants.\n\nFinally after a breakdown at 29 they agreed to a blood test, my partner and I were trying for a baby with no luck for over 5 years. By the time they agreed to test me, I was post menopause with no period since I'd had my son at 22.\n\nI was given 3 blood tests over 6 weeks and asked to come in to discuss the results. I know what was coming but it was still a shock, I was only 29 and my partner 26. I had the quickest discussion with my GP. Told I needed to start HRT straight away. I left with no other knowledge, support or care.\n\nI think had to wait a year and a half to see a menopause specialist at the clinic. He saved my life. He listened to all my symptoms and that day I left that appointment with a testosterone and oestrogen implant. In the 4 years I had been on HRT I felt normalish for 4 months of them. Unfortunately that doctor retired before my next appointment and I was then referred to his nurse-led implant team. This is when things turned for the worst again.\n\nI was giving a new specialist who did not call for my review and my implant appointment was cancelled. I cried a lot as the oestrogen implant did not last the 6 months and my symptoms where coming back. The anxiety, mood swings and insomnia being the worst. My specialist finally got in touch and agreed to change me on to patches as taking progesterone orally was making me sick daily and I had lost 2 and a half stone in weight. I told several female doctors about my weight loss to only be asked \"what's your secret\" no one cared. It took over a week and a half for my prescription to be emailed to my GP. I called over two days to my GP crying and asking for a emergency appointment to discuss getting my patches just so I'd start to feel a bit normal again. I was breakdown crying to the Receptionist and told it did not merit an emergency appointment. I eventually had a doctor call me back the next day, to tell me the prescription had finally turned up and she'd do it now. I was told put a patch on today(friday) and change it again on Monday. No question of my mental health and the breakdown I told Reception I was having. Got my prescription only to notice (after I'd put a patch on) she had prescribed me the wrong patches. I need progesterone every day these did not have progesterone in all of them. I called back to be told no one was available to talk to me. I was crying again telling her I could not be left like this over the weekend. A male GP called me back and told me I was prescribed the wrong medication and he thinks the other DR went with my age rather than what it said on the prescription or my file. He asked why I was aggressive to the receptionist, I told him I wasn't aggressive I was upset no one was listening to be. He hung up on me mid sentence.\n\nI have not been back to them since this. I don't have any confidence in them anymore. I've have 1 review in 4 years on HRT. I have now changed GP practice and being sent for more blood test as now I've lost 3 stone without anything changing. My new GP seems loads more friendlier and has not tried to force me on antidepressants. I'm hoping this is a turning point in my menopause journey now.‚Äù\n\nI will be 50 this coming Saturday. And it's a birthday I never thought I would see. Just over a year ago, I transformed from an intelligent, life loving, confident, professional woman to an absolute wreck of a human being. I lost my job which I had been in for 10 years. I lost my home. I lost my partner. I lost all hope. I lost my mind. Literally. I stayed in bed last summer for 4 weeks and couldn't speak to a single soul. I went from being a busy, respected professional who was brilliant at what I did to a walking zombie. I was terrified that my brain - which has always been the tool of my trade - would never recover. I shut down completely. I couldn't even make a cup of tea. I had heart palpitations for 5 months solid. I didn't sleep for 3 weeks solid, despite sleeping tablets. And as for the so called 'hot sweats' - that's a ridiculous turn of phrase. I was on fire, having simultaneous panic attacks and thought I was having a heart attack, at least 2-3 times a day. And just had to lay on the kitchen floor until it eventually passed.\n\nBut I'm still here. And so, so thankful that I am. The reasons I am still here are that, firstly, I couldn't work out a way to commit suicide without making a mess. I wrote suicide notes. I researched it A LOT. but couldn‚Äôt find the right way. Secondly I have the most wonderful sister who was on suicide watch every day for months. She literally kept at least half an eye on me at all times - and when she couldn't she subcontracted the job! She is a truly wonderful person. Thirdly that, when I was finally made to go to my GP, my doctor was empathetic, kind, completely understanding and recommended a seriously high dose of HRT without any hesitation.\n\nI recognise I was so so lucky. Nobody had prepared me for the absolute devastation menopause can cause in your life. My mother committed suicide aged 45. She was a wonderful, loving, brilliantly talented person. And she went nuts and took her own life. I was 19. For a LONG time, despite therapy, I struggled to wrap my head around how someone who was a selfless, loving mother to 3 (albeit by then grown up) children could just do this. Then, last year, I completely understood. Every day during that dark, dark period was absolutely terrifying and complete torture. And I never thought it would be any different. I could not locate a glimmer of joy in anything - despite all the efforts of the truly wonderful people that surrounded me. And they tried hard, believe me . I have a wonderful son who is now also grown up and independent - and despite knowing how my mother's suicide impacted on me, and the utter devastation it brings, it simply didn't matter. I had shut down completely and despite knowing the pain I would cause, suicide was absolutely the most logical - and only - solution. It seemed entirely inevitable. To end the absolute misery.\n\nBut. Here I am. Still alive. And embracing life in a way I never thought I would. My sister told me things would change. In those dark days, weeks, months, I didn't believe her. Not for a second. But she was right. Things started to change slowly after around 2 months of HRT gel (the patches didn't seem to work!) - and then, earlier this year, the change sped up. Significantly. And. I don't know if this re-birth is completely down to HRT gel - I‚Äôve also taken up yoga (after vowing I never would), open water swimming (which has been excellent for sorting my nervous system and ridding me of palpitations), and had more therapy. And, I am now LOVING life - more so than before the breakdown. I‚Äôve started my own business which is gong ridiculously well, and my brain is properly motoring. I have more freedom than ever in my life, more purpose, more stimulation, much more confidence- and more satisfaction than I think I've felt for decades.\n\nI also, for the first time ever, have made a forward plan to work out how I want to spend my last 20 or so years on this plant. And despite not having had sex for a year and absolutely not wanting to get involved ever again, I met a person 2 days ago, by chance, that I could actually imagine wanting to have sex with. This is serious progress. And it really doesn't matter if we don't even get it on - just knowing I could feel desire in that way was the best birthday present ever (I really really used to love sex!)\n\nSo - the shortage of HRT gel terrifies me. I do not think I could do another episode like last year. I've resorted to private prescriptions (managed to find 1 UK supplier on a luck day with stock!). So for now I'm ok - but I can't help thinking that, had my mother had the support and medication I was so fortunate to receive, she'd probably still be alive - and would have been a part of my son's life.\n\nI get that menopause impacts on different women differently. For me it is not a 'lifestyle choice' or a 'nice to have'. It really is medication I know I need not to return to the desolation of last year, and resulting inevitability of suicide,\n\nI am hoping the supply chains get sorted. If this condition happened to men I have no doubt that every town fountain across the UK would be pumping out free oestrogel. But it isn't a male issue. And I am so so grateful to this campaign that we make it an issue for the whole of society. Even the capitalists have to recognise that losing half your workforce at 50 is bonkers - especially when they represented the most experience, skilled, patient and smart half!\n\nFinally, just to say, if you're in that dark place just now, know that things really will change. I know this is so so hard to believe. Bu is is true.\n\nGood luck with your journeys, and I hope you get the support, help and medication you need.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú36 years old at the start of the first covid lockdown, I fell head first into hot flushes, awful skin and random bouts of anxiety. The hot flushes scared me, having had a thyroid issue previously with half of it removed I knew flushes could be a sign of something seriously wrong with my thyroid so immediately got in touch with my consultant and managed to get a scan (- battle given it was in a period of madness). Thyroid got the ok but no further along for these awful symptoms. Along came sleepless nights, tossing and turning unable to regulate my temperature and night time anxiety at a peak. I questioned if the drama of lockdown was adding to this and after weeks of having to listen to podcasts to get to sleep and when I woke rapidly shoving the headphones back in praying I would get back to sleep I really began to worry. Toilet trips several times a night had become normal, dry eyes needing eye drops I put down to extra computer work joining in with the nation to a new way of working with zoom calls and remote working now the norm. After a 1am panic attack stood in the garden with my husband crying and trying to breathe, I said I really need to get to the bottom of this. My skin was worse than ever, my GP said it could be rosacea and maybe this was also affecting my flushing and prescribed with azalaic acid. It never worked much and I still use it now but my skin is worse than ever.\n\nMonths later I complained yet again to another GP about the flushing, sleepless night and more and was sent back to my consultant who tested me for a range of autoimmune diseases including lupus. Having already been diagnosed with Graves‚Äô disease and then Hashimoto‚Äôs years before I of course through I was having a relapse into a condition that had been managed pretty well to now.\n\nTests all rushed back clear. I then headed back to the GP now nearly 18 months after my first symptoms. I talked about how I was feeling and how the anxiety I had suffered with at low levels mostly in previous years (worse during my thyroid imbalance) had now come back with a vengeance. I was prescribed antidepressants. I left feeling a little rocked. I didn‚Äôt mention low mood and I didn‚Äôt feel depressed.\n\nA week in and I had a full blown panic attack whilst driving with my son, it really shook me. I went to the GP shaking and she told me to stop them immediately. I did.\n\nI returned to the GP to disucss my ongoing hip and back pain which was so debilitating and I had been struggling with for 4 months. I then had a hip x Ray - all ok. A dexa bone scan- all ok. I had a series of blood tests and was sat down with my husband and told I was being referred on a 2 week wait with suspected Multiple Myeloma due to an elevated blood test and my symptoms. My family were in shock. 1 week late I get a call from my consultant whom I called for advice who offered to speak to his haematology colleague - he advised my levels were elevated enough and they didn‚Äôt suspect myeloma! The rollercoaster of emotions was unreal.\n\nA few weeks later my symptoms now improving I took my mother and the first female GP I saw asked lots of questions to my mother and me. She said this could be hormonal and I asked could it be menopause as I had IVF previously and had Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome producing 27 eggs. She said looking at my bloods they were ok but recommend I read up on PMDD and grab a book called the Hormone repair manual. I did just that. I read it and instantly knew it wasn‚Äôt PMDD. My GP called me as promised after more blood tests and advised me that she hadn‚Äôt mentioned but she worked privately for a menopause clinic and she was going to discuss my case with them.\n\nAnother week later and she called to say she had been through my bloods for the previous year and found some very high and lows of my oestradiol levels. She said this alongside my symptoms was enough to say I was likely Perimenopausal and she would get permission from my designated GP for a 3 month trial of HRT. I was simply overwhelmed. I‚Äôm a long way from back to me but my excruciating pain has nearly gone and I‚Äôm making headway. I don‚Äôt get up to wee throughout the night and I don‚Äôt need earphones in to sleep.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am early 50s and up until a couple of years ago felt amazing, healthy and relatively fit. Periods had stopped probably three years previous and I had a few menopause symptoms that I could deal with . However a year ago I was diagnosed with bilateral frozen shoulders and went through hell with the pain, they are still not completely fixed but I'm getting there. Then came the head to toe body aches, if I turned over in the night I was in agony and getting up in the morning I felt like an 80 year old! My concentration particularly at work was suffering and I had brain fog, sleep was all over the place and felt very low. I spoke to my gp on several occasions mainly in relation to the aches because it was something I was finding harder and harder to cope with. I thought I had an illness that was causing this because it had come on quite quickly. The gp did not want to prescribe hrt, no real reason as i was on no other medication, had no history of cancer but she told me to take pain killers. My employer had several free menopause awareness sessions in October and one I attended had a private menopause specialist presenting, it clicked immediately everything she was explaining was me, finally someone understood what was happening. She wasn't promoting her services as a private doctor so I looked her up online and found that her clinic was able to do remote video consultation . I contacted and within a month I was seen, the appointment was 45 mins and so very useful. She prescribed body identical hrt which was delivered within 12 hours. The private specialist also wrote to my GP advising what she prescribed and requested it to be put on repeat on the NHS. I started my hrt mid November and by Christmas I started to feel more like me. My brain fog was improving, I started to sleep more at night, I wasn't nodding off in the day, my skin had improved, the aches were still present but not as severe and even my shoulders felt easier. Within 3 months I felt back to how I like to feel, energetic and happy until I needed to get a repeat prescription as my Dr will only prescribe one month at a time. I had a text from the surgery to say they were unable to fulfill my prescription due to shortage immediately I panicked, I could not return to how I felt just months before. They suggested I changed to a patch but knowing how my skin reacts to plasters I declined and went back down the private route. I paid for 3 months supply (not much more expensive than the nhs) and hope that it will see me through until the shortages have been fixed. If I get those same symptoms back sadly I will not be able to work, I have no idea how I got thru the last time being awake half the night and then only going back to sleep as the alarm was about to sound. I'm keeping everything crossed that the shortages will be rectified soon.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOne morning I woke, I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror and cried, I had no idea who this woman was, I didn't recognise her at all, she didn't look like me, and I didn't feel like me. I sat on the floor for an hour, sobbing.\n\nI was scared, confused, and felt incredibly lost. I was 38\n\nI went to the doctors more times than I can remember and finally\n\nafter four years and what felt like a weekly increase in symptoms and being told I was depressed and it was all in my mind along with \"you are too young to be going through the Menopause.\" I finally discovered I was going through the Peri-Menopause, all the symptoms of the menopause but still having periods...Yay\n\nWhen I began the peri-menopause at 38 I thought I was on the fast track to becoming ‚Äòold‚Äô my skin began drying, I put on a pound or ten, my memory became foggy, and I couldn‚Äôt see any way back.\n\nI cried, and cried more times than I can count\n\nI cried because I wasn‚Äôt ready, I cried because it wasn‚Äôt my choice, I cried because I was scared, I cried because I had lost the girl I was.\n\nI cried because I was alone and had no idea what was going on\n\nI felt like giving in, I began drinking more because what else was there to do, eating anything and everything because what did it matter it was only an extra pound or two, slowly the love for myself faded\n\nIt was then at my lowest that the light began to creep in.\n\nI sat on the bottom step of my stairs and cried (again)\n\nI ask my self the question ‚ÄòWhat do I want from life, My life?‚Äô\n\nIt was then the that doors and windows opened and the light started flooding in.\n\nMy why is to live a very long, healthy happy and purposeful life, and at 102 to be able to do what I can do today and more.\n\nI liked the sound of this, It sparked hope\n\nIf I had any chance of this happening I had to pull myself together and make some serious changes.\n\nI understood that I was going to age no matter what, but I didn‚Äôt need to get old.\n\nGrow old gracefully some may call it.\n\nI tried HRT a couple of times but it didn‚Äôt like me, chest pains and increased blood pressure and resting heart rate.. I didn‚Äôt need anymore symptoms so I finally stopped\n\nI knew I had to make lifestyle changes\n\nI quit the booze, cleaned up my eating, remembered that I actually love exercising, and reading, and funnily the more I read the more I remembered, our brain is a muscle after all.\n\nThen something amazing happened, I got my power back, the more I stopped making excuses and started making choices the happier I become\n\nNo magic pill just a girl with a goal, a dream and a daily intention to make it happen\n\nLove the season and the skin your in ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nTogether we‚Äôve got this.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMenopause for me started at age 50. The only symptom I had was my periods started to be erratic. The usual on, off, flooding one month to nothing the next. And then stopping altogether At 57 June 2021 I started to feel unwell on and off. Didn't even click that could be Menopause as I had just had my 2nd covid vaccine so thought it was that. The worse symptom for me was fluctuating anxiety and I think I was spiralling into depression. The feeling was awful I felt so low. Didn't want to get out of bed in the morning but did to go to work. The anxiety feeling was awful like I was shaking inside in my chest. This was there one minute, gone the next. Up and down all the time. Other symptoms; I had palpitations, aching joints, brittle nails. I phoned my GP, eventually I got an appointment to go for blood tests. When I eventually got blood tests back (that's another story) I was told my oestrogen and vitamin D was low. My GP started me on Evorel 50 combi patches in September 21 and vit D supplement. After 6 months of side effects, changing my HRT etc., I am now settled on 0.5mg Sandrena gel and Utrogestan 100mg. Initially i felt my GP started me on too high a dose of patches and then Oestogel pump. I was experiencing sore breasts and leg cramps mainly. Because of HRT shortages I was changed to Sandrena gel. My GP Initially gave me 1.0mg and 0.5mg to apply daily. I decided I would just apply 0.5mg daily to see how I got on. I started this on 2nd March 2022 and seem to be getting on with this. No side effects. Although certain time of the month I get a couple of nights where I wake early with very mild anxiety. I just keep my eyes closed think of nice things try to shake this off and most of the time I can drop back to sleep before my alarm goes off to get up for work. It is now 23rd April and I do tend to feel so much better üòå I was told have to give at least 3 months for body to get used to HRT and to settle. I did up my Sandrena one day due to a bit of mild anxiety to 1.0mg. As soon as I did leg cramp came back. I reduced the next day to 0.5mg and after couple days leg cramp gone again. Just shows dose too high. But I may have to increase at later date. My advise to anyone starting HRT make sure your GP doesn't start you on too high a dose. Start low then increase if you have too. I just can't believe I went for 7 years without any symptoms, to this. The only other thing that worries me now is supply shortages. The government/health minister really need to pull their finger out and do something about it. Has been going on for far too long and they are treating women like 2nd class citizens when it comes to our health and HRT. We cannot do without this medication.‚Äù\n\nI was in my early 30's when a full Hysterectomy threw me into Menopause. Leaving the hospital with a leaflet and a box of Oestrogen only HRT, I was merely told, my recovery time and that I'd be on HRT for probably the next 20 years!\n\nWith very little information or education, I had no idea what was to come. I had suffered two decades of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis, trauma from 19 surgeries and at no point did anyone sit me down and explain 1) What Menopause would really feel like 2) The proper after-care I should experience 3) How I should be supported going forward being so young 4) Offer any mental support in how this might have affected me. Crazy right?\n\nAs my body healed from surgery the symptoms of Menopause started. I would experience the usual flushes, night sweats and it started to effect my sleep. My body shape was starting to change and I would feel fatigued easily, exercise slowed down as I tried to save energy to run around after the children and go to work.\n\nThen something happened that I really wasn't expecting. I felt like the plates I would usually juggle, were starting to fall. I would forget things, the kids club timings, things my husband had told me, conversations I'd had about projects at work. I just couldn't get to things. It was like my inbox was full. I became so irritable, angry and explosive at times, hiding my anxiety, the feeling of not belonging and all whilst not having a clue why I felt like I did. I honestly felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nWith relationships starting to crumble, I felt I wasn't any good at my job, a good Mum, Wife...or person! I was lost...\n\nDriving the kids to school one day, I remember not being able to hear the music, I was numb to their usual squabbling and as the sun shone in my eyes, I remember thinking, I just couldn't be bothered to squint, pull down the visor or press the break...in that moment I wanted to die!\n\nI was off work for six months after that day, with a phased return it took me almost a year to get back into the swing of things! In that time I learnt that diminishing hormone levels, not the right dosage of HRT and no support around my surgery was a huge part of what had happened! It took me to get that low, over twenty therapy sessions, for my family to nearly break and for me to temporarily leave work for that to even come up!\n\nWith awareness came improvements and mentally I grew stronger. For a while all seemed better, but despite getting back to work, something still wasn't right physically.\n\nThat was a few years ago and just 5 months ago I finally got to speak to an NHS Menopause doctor through a new clinic at my GP surgery. Elated, we spoke, I felt listened to and she wanted to know my history. Her diagnosis after blood tests was that my Oestrogen levels were dangerously low and it seemed I wasn't absorbing the Oestrogen through tablet/gel/patch (I had tried all over the years). She informed I would need an 'Oestrogen implant', I was then referred beck to the GP to set the wheels in motion hurrah!\n\nI was also put onto Progesterone, in which the Menopause Doctor was shocked I had not been put on this from day one due to the risk of Endometriosis returning. With only ever have one set of bloods done before and no knowledgable checks of low levels, she said \"You've really suffered medical negligence here!\", that struck me hard.\n\nWhat came next was a text message (like some sort of bad break up!) to inform that I couldn't have the implant, geographically it wasn't on offer to me..that was it!\n\nSo where did that leave me? By this point I was a mess, with physical symptoms through the roof including, aching joints, severe fatigue, brain fog and heart palpitations, I couldn't believe what I was reading.\n\nMy options - Go on a NHS wait list for a hospital 2 hours away, or go up the road to a private clinic and pay ¬£500!\n\nFeeling like I was really struggling and now mentally some demons were start to arise again, I opted for Private. I had the most amazing consultation and paid for the HRT Implant to be ordered in.\n\nThat was 5 weeks ago. I'm still waiting for the HRT implant to come! Meanwhile still awaiting any news from the NHS side.\n\nI'm left physically and mentally at rock bottom. I'm struggling to function and right now have had to again take some time off work, in order to sustain energy to function and look after the children. This is not living!\n\nNot only do I have the concern of when I will get this implant, I also question, what happens when it needs replacing every 6 months? Will I even get it? What about support and care...It petrifies me.\n\nI do not fit the usual box on Menopause! People like me are often not seen or heard much in the world of media, we're not recognised on medical forms, or Menopause checklists, HRT checks at GP surgeries, often having to be the one education the professionals rather than the other way around as to why we're menopausal at such a young age.\n\nFor me it isn't a natural stage or transition. It is medical a hormone deficiency that needs proper care, knowledge, support and medication.\n\nImagine what the worst case scenario here is...and then imagine the best. Which one should any human feel?\n\n‚ÄúFound out in 2015 I had a large fibroid. Was left for "
