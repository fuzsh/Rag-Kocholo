        "text": "It‚Äôs possible to make a movie without music ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not advisable. In truth, music and movies are two artforms that are nearly inextricable from one another. Some of the greatest scenes in film history are memorable precisely because of the song that soundtracks them, and there are many classic songs that you can‚Äôt hear without imagining a particular movie scene in your head.\n\nPicking the right song for the right moment is an art in itself, and some filmmakers are well known for their selective prowess, like Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. As you might guess, both are well represented on this list of the best uses of songs in movies, but they‚Äôre far from the only filmmakers to have woven music into movies and made magic. To make it clear, we excluded songs made specifically for the film itself, focusing instead on so-called ‚Äòneedle drops‚Äô ‚Äì recognisable tunes that punctuate a film at just the right moment. But that still left us with a ton of choice pop, rock, jazz and classical cuts to choose from. Here‚Äôs our playlist.\n\nRecommended:\n\nüéµ The 40 best musical movies of all timeüé∏ The 50 best 90s movies, ranked\n\nüî• The 100 best movies of all-time\n\n50. ‚ÄúOrinoco Flow (Sail Away),‚Äù Enya, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)\n\nIn David Fincher's latest antiseptic thriller, the murderer has all the usual instruments of torture: poison gas, sharp scalpels, immobilizing slings. But most harrowing of all? A taste for blasting Enya's cloying hit song at eye-glazing volume. (We don't have the clip‚Äîand wouldn't want to ruin the killer's identity for you anyway‚Äîbut here's that cool trailer again.)‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nWatch the video for \"Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)\" by Enya\n\n49. ‚ÄúHip to Be Square,‚Äù Huey Lewis and the News, American Psycho (2000)\n\nTrue to the spirit of the novel, this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's serial-killer satire uses Huey's catchy hit single to score the cutthroat dispatching of a Wall Street rival. Christian Bale alternates gleeful critical assessments with grisly ax thwacks, making this superficially slick '80s tune emblematic of the ultimate Reagan-era hollow man.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch American Psycho\n\nDownload ‚ÄúHip to Be Square‚Äù on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Hip to Be Square\" by Huey Lewis and the News\n\nAdvertising\n\n48. ‚ÄúYou Never Can Tell,‚Äù Chuck Berry, Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nOf the many peppy, pop-culture-charged scenes in Quentin Tarantino's landmark crime comedy, few pack the giddy punch of this Jack Rabbit Slim's musical number, set to a Chuck Berry jaunt. Uma Thurman slinks with feline grace, and John Travolta proves he's still got the Tony Manero moves.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Pulp Fiction\n\nDownload \"You Can Never Tell\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"You Never Can Tell\" by Chuck Berry\n\n47. ‚ÄúHe Needs Me,‚Äù Shelley Duvall, Punch-Drunk Love (2002)\n\nThe lilting love anthem from Robert Altman's 1980 Popaeye was brilliantly repurposed by Paul Thomas Anderson for his quirky romance: Adam Sandler races to join inamorata Emily Watson in Hawaii. When they finally embrace, the music flourishes and the rush is palpable.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Punch-Drunk Love\n\nDownload \"He Needs Me\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"He Needs Me\" by Shelley Duvall\n\nAdvertising\n\n46. ‚ÄúSome Velvet Morning,‚Äù Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra, Morvern Callar (2002)\n\nA psychedelic groove of soap-opera strings and lyrical menace accompanies Samantha Morton, lost in her headphone cloud, as she cruises to her McJob at the supermarket. It's a perfectly rendered Gen-Whatever moment, an interior mood that few filmmakers have nailed as expertly as Scotland's Lynne Ramsay.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Morvern Callar\n\nDownload \"Some Velvet Morning\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Some Velvet Morning\" by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra\n\n45. ‚ÄúThe Times They Are a-Changin‚Äô,‚Äù Bob Dylan, Watchmen (2009)\n\nZack Snyder's faithful-to-a-fault adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's influential graphic novel is a dud, save its mesmerizing, Bob Dylan‚Äìscored opening-credits sequence. Dylan's folk prophecy poetically complements the history of the story's superhero protagonists, from their WWII heyday to a Vietnam-era fall from grace.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Watchmen\n\nDownload \"The Times They Area a-Changin'\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" by Bob Dylan\n\nAdvertising\n\n44. ‚ÄúNatural‚Äôs Not in It,‚Äù Gang of Four, Marie Antoinette (2006)\n\nSofia Coppola's threading of anachronistic postpunk into her portrait of the 18th-century queen prompts head-scratching among historical purists. But kicking things off with Gang of Four's Marxist critique is inspired: The song immediately puts displays of conspicuous consumption within contextual air quotes. (Here's the trailer, with a taste of Gang of Four at the 0:30 mark, along with other artists.)‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Marie Antoinette\n\nWatch the video for \"Natural's Not in It\" by Gang of Four\n\n43. ‚ÄúDanny Boy,‚Äù Frank Patterson, Miller's Crossing (1990)\n\nIt's ironic enough for an Irish crime boss to be assassinated in his bedroom while listening to this ballad. Yet the Coen brothers rev up the humor massively by having the wistful gent (the mighty Albert Finney) actually survive the hit, returning a hail of submachine-gun fire while his favorite song calmly concludes.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Miller's Crossing\n\nDownload \"Danny Boy\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Danny Boy\" by Frank Patterson\n\nAdvertising\n\n42. ‚ÄúThese Days,‚Äù Nico, The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)\n\nGwyneth Paltrow is immortalized as the alluring, raccoon-eyed Margot Tenenbaum in Wes Anderson's slo-mo tracking shot, which captures a sweet reunion, a hint of nostalgia and the filmmaker's signature coziness, all wrapped up in the Teutonic loveliness of Nico's quiet voice. If Anderson's choices were always this restrained, he'd be a giant.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Royal Tenenbaums\n\nDownload \"These Days\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"These Days\" by Nico\n\n41. ‚ÄúImagine,‚Äù John Lennon, The Killing Fields (1984)\n\nThis Oscar-winning drama about an American journalist and his captured Cambodian translator uses John Lennon's hit to end on a high note. The former Beatle's wish-list lyrics and the moment's emotional uplift‚Äîa tearful reunion‚Äîmake such utopian fantasies seem both noble and absolutely necessary.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Killing Fields\n\nDownload \"Imagine\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Imagine\" by John Lennon\n\n40. \"Making Time,\" the Creation, Rushmore (1998)\n\nHere's the moment when Wes Anderson truly arrives, forever to live in the hearts of geeky obsessives with this montage of Max Fischer's extracurriculars, ranging from \"bombardment society founder\" to the director of the Max Fischer Players. The forgotten band that penned the tune, a lesser Who, supplies the attitude.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy Rushmore on Amazon\n\nDownload \"Making Time\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Making Time\" by the Creation\n\n39. \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In),\" the First Edition, The Big Lebowski (1998)\n\nJeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski knows his way around narcotics, but he's surely never had a trip quite like the bowling-alley dream sequence in the Coens' profanely funny comedy. Wagneresque chorines, scissor-wielding nihilists and a Kenny Rogers ditty combine for maximum, mind-altering surreality.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Big Lebowski\n\nDownload \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\" by the First Edition\n\nAdvertising\n\n38. \"Unchained Melody,\" the Righteous Brothers, Ghost (1990)\n\nMany things about this supernatural drama are endearingly silly, including Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore‚Äôs sensual pottery session ‚Äì but it would have much sillier if it were soundtracked by practically any song other than the Righteous Brothers‚Äô blue-eyed soul classic, a song so swooning and ethereal you could put it over stock footage from a sausage factory and eyes would get misty. ‚ÄîMatthew Singer\n\nBuy, rent or watch Ghost\n\nDownload \"Unchained Melody\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Unchained Melody\" by the Righteous Brothers\n\n37. \"Patricia,\" Perez Prado Orchestra, La Dolce Vita (1960)\n\nIf the films of Federico Fellini can be likened to one glamorous late-night party, unbound and spinning out of control, then here's the organ-drenched soundtrack, equal parts prim and perverse. A drunk party girl sheds her clothes (and shame) in this, the most notorious scene of the director's career.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch La Dolce Vita\n\nDownload \"Patricia\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Patricia\" by Perez Prado Orchestra\n\nAdvertising\n\n36. \"Head Over Heels,\" Tears for Fears, Donnie Darko (2001)\n\nIn a terrific early scene from Richard Kelly's cult debut, Jake Gyllenhaal's depressive, time-traveling outcast takes a long walk down his high-school hallway. Assembled into a single, unbroken take, it's as if we're gliding through one morning in our own angst-ridden teen existence‚Äîbut with a better soundtrack.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Donnie Darko\n\nDownload \"Head Over Heels\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Head Over Heels\" by Tears for Fears\n\n35. \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" the Rolling Stones, The Big Chill (1983)\n\nEffortlessly evoking the disappointments of the boomer era, Mick Jagger's profound lyric lends weight to this movie's early knockout scene, a funeral procession for a suicide. As we get to know these reuniting friends, we only hope they'll get what they need. (This clip isn't the full sequence, but you get the vibe.)‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Big Chill\n\nDownload \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" by the Rolling Stones\n\nAdvertising\n\n34. \"California Dreamin',\" the Mamas & the Papas, Chungking Express (1994)\n\nThe beaches of Malibu are a world way from the crowded noodle stalls of Hong Kong, but damned if director Wong Kar-wai doesn't make it work. His missed-connection romance, between a world-weary cop and a pixieish young woman, gets a dreamy injection of urban ennui via John Phillips & Co.'s '60s pop hit.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Chunking Express\n\nDownload \"California Dreamin'\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"California Dreamin'\" by the Mamas & the Papas\n\n33. \"I Got You Babe,\" Sonny & Cher, Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nIt‚Äôs a perfectly pleasant piece of ‚Äò60s pop sunshine, but under certain circumstances, Sonny and Cher‚Äôs classic bubblegum ballad can become tortuous ‚Äì like, say, if it was the first thing you were made to hear every single morning, signalling you‚Äôve not yet been freed from the time loop forcing you to relieve the same day over and over and over again. For Bill Murray‚Äôs cranky weatherman, it‚Äôs a cruel cosmic joke ‚Äì the universe‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got you, babe, and only you can get yourself out‚Äô ‚Äì and it wouldn't be nearly as funny with any other song. ‚ÄîMatthew Singer\n\nBuy, rent or watch Groundhog Day\n\nDownload \"I Got You Babe\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny & Cher\n\nAdvertising\n\n32. \"My Sharona,\" the Knack, Reality Bites (1994)\n\nThe quintessential scene from Ben Stiller's Gen-X-catering romance takes place in a Food Mart as Winona Ryder and up-and-comers Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo \"ironically\" get down to this exuberant new-wave track. An embarrassed Ethan Hawke cringes on behalf of all involved.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Reality Bites\n\nDownload \"My Sharona\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"My Sharona\" by the Knack\n\n31. A Love Supreme, John Coltrane, Mo' Better Blues (1990)\n\nSpike Lee originally named his jazz film after John Coltrane's epic four-part suite, before the musician's widow asked him to change the title. Thankfully, she let Lee borrow part of the song to add resonance to the movie's climax, in which Denzel Washington's troubled trumpeter starts a family and finally finds inner peace.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch now Mo' Better Blues\n\nDownload A Love Supreme on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for A Love Supreme by John Coltrane\n\n30. \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" Queen, Wayne's World (1992)\n\nQueen‚Äôs grandiosity was well out of vogue in the grunge ‚Äò90s, and Saturday Night Live wasn‚Äôt exactly the cultural juggernaut it used to be, either. And yet, the combination of the two resulted in one of the most iconic movie moments of the entire decade, in what‚Äôs easily still the best big-screen spinoff of an SNL sketch ever. Wayne, Garth and friends‚Äô headbanging singalong reinvigorated interest in the band just months after Freddie Mercury‚Äôs death, sending their then-17-year-old power ballad shooting to No. 2 on the charts and cementing it as a karaoke staple for the rest of time. It‚Äôs a better tribute to Queen‚Äôs legacy by itself than all of Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nBuy, rent or watch Wayne's World\n\nDownload \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen\n\n29. \"Perfect Day,\" Lou Reed, Trainspotting (1996)\n\nWhether Reed's tune is a direct reference to heroin has been long debated, but what isn't arguable is how effectively Danny Boyle employs it‚Äîas an overdosing Ewan McGregor imagines he's in a shag-carpeted coffin. The song's blissful lyrics make this junkie nightmare even more disturbing; it's the \"perfect\" example of needle-drop irony.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Trainspotting\n\nDownload \"Perfect Day\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Perfect Day\" by Lou Reed\n\nAdvertising\n\n28. \"Old Time Rock and Roll,\" Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Risky Business (1983)\n\nFrom 1983‚Äîa time when the whole world could love Tom Cruise unreservedly‚Äîcomes this euphoric scene of geeked-out underwear dancing, set to the scratchy bar-band stylings of Bob Seger. Cruise even jumps on a couch and it's okay.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Risky Business\n\nDownload \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band\n\n27. \"Oh Yeah,\" Yello, Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)\n\nJohn Hughes, that poet of teen-pop angst, was bound to appear on this list somewhere. Not so surprisingly, it's via this Swiss-recorded dance beat, a perfect complement to the Ferrari-stealing antics of the title character. Just try not smiling (devilishly) when you hear it.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off\n\nDownload \"Oh Yeah\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello\n\nAdvertising\n\n26. \"Blue Moon,\" Sam Cooke, An American Werewolf in London (1981)\n\nDavid Naughton's lupine transformation is set to Cooke's crooning cover of the Rodgers and Hart standard, making it the most memorable (and jarring) of John Landis's wink-nudge musical choices. Rick Baker's groundbreaking makeup work may bring on the howling, but this lunar ballad adds a dark dose of levity.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch An American Werewolf in London\n\nDownload \"Blue Moon\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Blue Moon\" by Sam Cooke\n\n25. \"Tiny Dancer,\" Elton John, Almost Famous (2000)\n\nNever underestimate the healing power of Elton John: As the '70s rock band of Cameron Crowe's autobiographical drama piles into its tour bus, everyone's in a funk. Then this uplifting 1971 tribute to an L.A. lady comes on, and soon, everybody is singing along‚Äîincluding you.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Almost Famous\n\nDownload \"Tiny Dancer\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John\n\nAdvertising\n\n24. \"Rock Around the Clock,\" Bill Haley and the Comets, Blackboard Jungle (1955)\n\nRock & roll was the soundtrack to juvenile delinquency, so how better to kick off a film about high-school hoodlums than with a real poodle-skirt scorcher? Bill Haley's 1954 B-side turned on tons of teens to this raucous new sound‚Äîthe first use of rock music in a movie, but far from the last, Daddy-o.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Blackboard Jungle\n\nDownload \"Rock Around the Clock\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley and the Comets\n\n23. \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time),\" the Delfonics, Jackie Brown (1997)\n\nThis impassioned 1970s single is the soul of Quentin Tarantino's most romantic movie: Robert Forster's grizzled bail-bondsman hears the tune in the living room of beleaguered, beautiful client Pam Grier. It sends him from charmed to infatuated‚Äîand straight to the record store.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Jackie Brown\n\nDownload \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" by the Delfonics\n\nAdvertising\n\n22. \"Hurdy Gurdy Man,\" Donovan, Zodiac (2007)\n\nThis near-primal scene starts with two young adults flirting in a Corvair at a lovers' lane, until the headlights of a mysterious car pull up behind them. Suddenly, the song on the radio can only signify evil. By the time David Fincher returns to Donovan's sinuous groove in his closing credits, the tune has been transformed. (A clearer clip of the scene is here.)‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Zodiac\n\nDownload \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" by Donovan\n\n21. \"The Sound of Silence,\" Simon and Garfunkel, The Graduate (1967)\n\nHello darkness, my old friend: The signature track off the duo's 1966 album perfectly underscores Dustin Hoffman's descent into suburban bummersville, as the song's melody casts a melancholic pallor over his interchangeable lazy afternoons and numbing sexual trysts.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Graduate\n\nDownload \"The Sound of Silence\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel\n\n10. \"Sister Christian,\" Night Ranger/\"Jessie's Girl,\" Rick Springfield, Boogie Nights (1997)\n\nThe sad rise and fall of porn star Dirk Diggler reaches its catharsis in this legendary sequence, a drug deal gone awry. First, we're introduced to the den of berobed crackhead Alfred Molina, jamming to his \"awesome\" mixtape and the aggressive triumphalism of Night Ranger's hair-metal anthem. Then (after an unexpected cassette flip) the music shifts to Rick Springfield's puppy-eyed rocker, as our hero slips into a dangerous situation beyond his control. Watch Mark Wahlberg's complex close-up as the chorus builds: He's half in awe of the song‚Äîperhaps it's the kind of music Dirk wishes he himself could record‚Äîand half cognizant of his own ruination. For all of his subsequent genius, director Paul Thomas Anderson has never eclipsed this scene.‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Boogie Nights\n\nDownload \"Sister Christian\" on Amazon\n\nDownload \"Jessie's Girl\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Sister Christian\" by Night Ranger and \"Jessie's Girl\" by Rick Springfield\n\n9. \"Layla,\" Derek and the Dominoes, Goodfellas (1990)\n\nOne could cull a top-ten-song list just from Martin Scorsese's landmark crime epic, the most influential movie of the 1990s. The director was yoking pop music and images with a deftness no one could touch; for the sake of our list, we'll go with this montage of whacked comrades, set to the forlorn piano outro of Eric Clapton's early-'70s radio staple. The party is over as goons meet their long-telegraphed ends: slain in a pink Caddy, hanging in a meat truck and gunned down in the private living room of a \"made guy,\" where a promotion takes a shocking turn. Even as you watched the sequence for the first time, it felt like a classic‚Äîand still does. (We can't embed the specific part, but here's a link to it.)‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch Goodfellas\n\nDownload \"Layla\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Layla\" by Derek and the Dominoes\n\nAdvertising\n\n8. Tubular Bells, Mike Oldfield, The Exorcist (1973)\n\nThe most signature piece of music to ever grace a horror movie (and now an instant evocation of creeping doom), Mike Oldfield's prog-rock composition was selected for this 1973 blockbuster's opening theme after an entire original score was rejected by director William Friedkin. In the piece's tinkling piano and synths, you can hear a premonition of the iconic soundtracks of John Carpenter to come. Early in the film itself, you seen Ellen Burstyn strolling down a leaf-strewn Georgetown street. Children cavort in costume√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùit's Halloween. Nuns pass, their robes billowing in ghostly waves. Suddenly Burstyn stops, noticing two priests having a heart-to-heart conversation. \"There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud,\" one of them says, anguished. Everyone's faith is about to be tested. (Above is the trailer‚Äîbrace yourself‚Äîand here's a link to the scene.)‚ÄîJoshua Rothkopf\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Exorcist\n\nDownload Tubular Bells on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield\n\n7. Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin, Manhattan (1979)\n\nGershwin wrote his groundbreaking high-art-meets-lowbrow work in 1924 as a \"musical kaleidoscope of America.\" But after fellow Brooklynite Woody Allen set his film's opening montage of local landmarks and crowded avenues to the composer's signature tune, you can't help but think of one specific city whenever you hear those joyously jazz-inflected fanfares. Cinematographer Gordon Willis's peerless black-and-white Gotham tour combined with Gershwin's vintage ode fully captures the poetry and sound of the streets. This is late-'70s NYC recast as an old-fashioned urban wonderland, a version of past and present Manhattans linked together with every skyscraper shot and slinky piano run.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Manhattan\n\nDownload Rhapsody in Blue on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin\n\nAdvertising\n\n6. \"Stuck in the Middle with You,\" Stealers Wheel, Reservoir Dogs (1992)\n\nTarantino has already made several appearances on our list, yet here is the sequence that stands above all his others. QT places Stealers Wheel's benign folk-pop tune over an unlikely scene in which a cop is tortured at great length by the psychotic, razor-wielding Michael Madsen. What starts as a playfully meta moment with \"Mr. Blonde\" doing some swaggering dance moves turns deadly serious by the time of the infamous ear slicing, when the song's playful cries of \"Pl-ee-ee-ease!\" might double as unanswered cries for mercy. Along with Tarantino's impeccable musical taste, it makes for an instantly memorable set piece√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe first of many in the filmmaker's oeuvre.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Resevoir Dogs\n\nDownload \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" by Stealers Wheel\n\n5. \"In Your Eyes,\" Peter Gabriel, Say Anything... (1989)\n\nLet's say your true love has broken up with you, and you're going to blast something on a boom box outside their window to win them back. Most people would probably pick one of the era's soft-rock hits or power ballads; then again, most people aren't Lloyd Dobler. Kudos to Cameron Crowe for picking Peter Gabriel's sincere confessional as the perfect offbeat choice for John Cusack's heart-on-his-sleeve hero to serenade dream girl Ione Skye. Thanks to the combo of the song's testimony to soulmate salvation and Cusack's misfit sensitivity, the scene has become an iconic moment of hopeless romanticism, parodied a million times over yet still able to bring tears to our eyes.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Say Anything...\n\nDownload \"In Your Eyes\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"In Your Eyes\" by Peter Gabriel\n\nAdvertising\n\n4. \"We'll Meet Again,\" Vera Lynn, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nVera Lynn's sentimental 1939 tune became a WWII anthem for the British, a heartfelt promise that England's sons and daughters would be reunited come what may and normal existence would resume. Stanley Kubrick's repurposing of Vera Lynn's keep-your-chin-up ditty for his satirical zero-sum game, however, put a stake through any prevailing notions of optimism; life after wartime was a now thing of the past. In an era when sick humor was the only sane reaction to notions of nuclear Armageddon, Kubrick's keenly realized callback to this old favorite, playing over a parade of mushroom clouds, goes way beyond irony. It's a punch line to the blackest joke imaginable. (Our clip includes the scene beforehand.)‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nDownload \"We'll Meet Again\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"We'll Meet Again\" by Vera Lynn\n\n3. \"The End,\" the Doors, Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nJim Morrison's spellbinding 12-minute dirge was originally intended as a breakup song, but with its explicit evocations of patricide and incest (as well as the lead singer's animalistic vocalizations), the tune evolved into something more allegorical, a larger consideration of the violent beast inside us all. The mythic stature of this pop magnum opus only increased when Francis Ford Coppola placed it over the trancelike prologue of his 1979 Vietnam war epic. Helicopters slide cagily through the frame, a forest is devastated in a slo-mo napalm bombing, and Martin Sheen's somnolent visage‚Äîcaught somewhere between dream and reality‚Äîfloats over it all. Morrison and the band's apocalyptic lament evokes the horrors of a war as vividly and aptly as do the images.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch now Apocalypse Now\n\nDownload \"The End\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"The End\" by the Doors\n\nAdvertising\n\n2. \"In Dreams,\" Roy Orbison, Blue Velvet (1986)\n\n\"Candy-colored clown...,\" requests the deranged Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) to his dandyish friend Ben (Dean Stockwell) in a womblike parlor. What has curious collegian Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) gotten himself into? David Lynch's epochal 1986 freak-out doesn't lack outr sequences, but there's something especially unnerving about this prolonged detour behind suburban closed doors (freaky ladies sitting around listlessly, Hopper's terrifyingly bug-eyed countenance). It famously climaxes with Ben lip-synching to Roy Orbison's soaring lost-love ballad using a work light as a microphone. It's a nightmare you never want to wake up from.‚ÄîKeith Uhlich\n\nBuy, rent or watch Blue Velvet\n\nDownload \"In Dreams\" on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for \"In Dreams\" by Roy Orbison\n\n1. Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Richard Strauss, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nIt builds, softly, with three ascending notes...then an eruption of strings and woodwinds, punctuated by colossal timpani hits. That's when the light crests over a gigantic planet‚Äîthe view of a sunrise as seen from an orbiting space station, or witnessed by God Himself. Stanley Kubrick wanted to use classical compositions instead of the commissioned (and discarded) Alex North score to attain an appropriately massive soundtrack to his cerebral sci-fi masterpiece, and Richard Strauss's tone poem supplies the film's opening moments with an immediate sense of scope and grandeur: This is what the majesty of the universe sounds like. Everyone from Elvis Presley to the makers of cat-food commercials has since hijacked this Nietzsche-inspired work for their grand entrances, but Kubrick got there first; by the time 2001's title credit shows up under that sustained musical burst, the combination of sound and image has already transported you to infinity and beyond.‚ÄîDavid Fear\n\nBuy, rent or watch 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nDownload Thus Spoke Zarathustra on Amazon\n\nWatch the video for Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Richard Strauss"
