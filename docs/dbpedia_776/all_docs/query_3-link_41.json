        "text": "All babies cry, but some cry more than others. Healthy newborns start to cry more around 2 weeks of age. They will cry even more until they’re about 6 weeks old. After that, the crying usually gets better.\n\nColic is when a healthy baby cries for more than 3 hours each day for 3 or more days in one week. If this happens 3 weeks in a row, your baby may have colic.\n\nColic can start at 2 to 3 weeks of age and lasts up to 3 or 4 months of age.\n\nThe crying may or may not occur at the same time each day, but it usually happens more often in the evening.\n\nWith colic, your baby will not stop crying when you try usual ways of comforting, such as holding and feeding.\n\nColic is a common. It affects 1 in 4 babies and can cause stress on a whole family. It’s important to remember:\n\nColic is not your fault.\n\nYour baby is not angry with you.\n\nYour anger is normal.\n\nColic is not making your baby sick.\n\nPossible Causes\n\nThe cause of colic is not known. Although healthy babies can have colic, crying can also be caused by physical problems or their environment. Some things that may be related are:\n\nGas pain\n\nStomach spasms\n\nExposure to smoke\n\nImmature nervous or digestive system\n\nSigns and Symptoms\n\nCrying is the main sign of colic. While crying, your baby may:\n\nFlail their arms and legs\n\nClench their fists\n\nArch their back\n\nStruggle and seem angry when held\n\nDraw their legs up toward the belly\n\nWays to Help\n\nThere is no treatment for colic. This makes it hard to comfort your crying baby. You can:\n\nAvoid smoking around them. Do not let others smoke around them.\n\nAvoid feeding them every time they cry. This can lead to overfeeding, which can make them more uncomfortable.\n\nBurp them often while feeding. This removes air from their stomach and reduces gas. You can also try massaging their stomach.\n\nHold them in your arms. Place them on their left side to help with digestion or on their stomach for support. Gently rub their back. If they fall asleep, put them in their crib on their back.\n\nPlay constant, calming sounds. Use a: white noise machine, humming fan, soothing sound playlist, or recording of a heart beating.\n\nTake them for a ride in a stroller or car.\n\nRock them in a rocking chair.\n\nGive them a pacifier. Many babies are soothed by extra sucking.\n\nWalk while holding them. Carry them in a front pack.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\n\nCall your baby’s doctor or health care provider if they have any of these symptoms:\n\nFever\n\nHard poop\n\nDiarrhea\n\nPoor weight gain\n\nPoor feeding\n\nBlood in poop\n\nThrowing up (vomiting)\n\nSpitting up a lot of formula\n\nPreventing Abusive Head Trauma\n\nRemember to place your baby in a safe place and walk away if you start feeling angry or frustrated. It will not hurt them if they keep crying.\n\nNever shake your baby. Shaking will not stop the crying and can cause abusive head trauma (AHT). AHT, formerly called Shaken Baby Syndrome, is caused by serious brain damage. It happens when a baby’s head is moved rapidly, then suddenly stops.\n\nEveryone around your baby needs to know that they may cry a lot. This includes family members, friends, or babysitters. They must know how to comfort them to prevent AHT.\n\nTo avoid AHT:\n\nGently and safely place your baby on their back in a crib or swing. Secure all railings or safety belts before you walk away.\n\nCheck on your baby every 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nAsk someone you trust, like a relative or friend, to stay with your baby while you get out of the house. Go see a movie, shop, go out to dinner, or take a walk.\n\nTry to rest when your baby naps. Getting enough rest will help with stress.\n\nIf you have any questions, ask your doctor or health care provider.\n\nHelping Hands Patient Education Materials\n\nWritten and illustrated by medical, nursing and allied health professionals at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Helping Hand instructions are intended as a supplement to verbal instructions provided by a medical professional.
