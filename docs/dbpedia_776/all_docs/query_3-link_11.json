        "text": "Key emotions\n\nFear, embarrassment, uncertainty.\n\nWhen experiencing symptoms of MI, patients may delay seeking medical help for a number of reasons:\n\nOne main and well-researched reason is misattribution of symptoms: if the experienced symptoms do not fit the patient’s idea of ‘a typical heart attack’ – usually imagined as a sudden-onset severe pain in the left side of the arm and upper body – they may find alternative explanations, such as indigestion or back pain, and wait for symptoms to pass.96 Women, younger people and those with active lifestyles are especially unlikely to consider themselves as possible candidates for MI.\n\nIn this study, only one-third of the patients suspected that their symptoms might be related to heart trouble ( ). Many others ‘normalised’ their symptoms and hoped that they might disappear again given time. (In a few cases, this actually happened and patients only learned weeks or months later that they had previously experienced a ‘silent MI’.) One man told how he ‘tested’ himself for MI by running up and down the stairs and was falsely reassured when this did not affect his symptoms.\n\nFIGURE 11\n\nRecognising the symptoms of MI. Number in shape: participant interview ID number. Participant sex is indicated by shape fill colour (blue = male; green = female). Participant age at diagnosis is indicated by shape form (more...)\n\nI didn’t actually suspect there was anything wrong with my heart; I thought I had a backache, a back problem. [. . .] I was still playing football on a Saturday and I used to get some pain during that but it was across my shoulders and up here, and I’d always – you know you see the films and people have heart attacks, clutch their chest, or their breast and fall to the floor. So looking back I don’t really know whether I really did think there might be a problem and that I’ve just chosen to forget it. Because I do remember at work running up the stairs to see if it got worse because I knew [laughs], I knew that would bring something on and then when it didn’t, I thought, ‘well I must be all right then, it must be my back’.\n\nHA11, male, MI in 1999 aged 42 years\n\nOne woman dismissed the possibility of MI because the pain she felt was on the right rather than the left side of her body.\n\n[My husband] and got me some indigestion tablets. It didn’t work. I took a [pain killer] tablet which usually knocks me out. No. So all night I was up with this pain, on and off and he was rubbing my back, and he kept saying to me ‘Are you sure you’re not having a heart attack?’ And I said ‘No, it’s the wrong side’.\n\nHA03, female, MI 1998 aged 53 years\n\nThere is a considerable literature about delays in help-seeking, and normalisation and symptom misattribution have been well documented in previous qualitative work.97\n\nWhile improved public education about the breadth of possible symptoms of MI and the fact that a broad range of people can be at risk may be helpful, symptom recognition is only one of the factors that accounts for delays in help-seeking.98 Alongside uncertainties about what a heart attack can feel like, another reason why patients delay seeking help promptly is acute social embarrassment. Having a heart attack constitutes a highly disruptive social event which renders the person experiencing it in the role of a helpless victim. In this study, several patients, all male, said that they had delayed seeking help because they did not want to ‘make a fuss’. The following quote is from a man who described his reluctance to call an ambulance to his holiday hotel.\n\nI suppose in the back of my mind I thought, ‘well, this could be a heart attack but surely it’s worse than that’. Like I said about Rowan Atkinson, that was all I knew about heart attacks. [. . .] So [my wife] said, ‘We’re going to phone NHS Direct. [. . .] After I described the symptoms she said, ‘it sounds to me as if you’ve had a heart attack’, I said, ‘no, no I haven’t, I couldn’t possibly have had a heart attack’ [. . .] and she said ‘I think you better dial 999,’ I said ‘well I’m certainly not doing that’. [. . .] The commotion, the commotion of it and thinking, it was a small guest house type of hotel and you know I could imagine the lights flashing because it was a busy road and there was ambulances flashing all the time you know. It was the drama of it and I didn’t feel it was that bad to be honest. So I left it and [um] slept a bit I suppose and next morning we were going home anyway.\n\nHA14, male, MI in 2003 aged 51 years\n\nGender differences in seeking help for MI are well documented in previous qualitative research99–101 and interventions to promote prompt help-seeking for MI need to take account of this. Both men and women delay seeking help, but for different reasons. Qualitative research has also explored other gender-specific factors that may delay hospital admission.33,102,103 Women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms, and are at greater risk of being misdiagnosed. Women may also be taken less seriously by health professionals due to less assertive self-presentation in medical encounters.\n\nOne woman told how she was repeatedly admitted to hospital but then discharged without intervention because her electrocardiograms (ECGs) and blood tests appeared normal. She had an angiogram only after her third admission and then promptly received surgery.\n\nAnd then when I think we went back a third time and went all through the casualty admissions again that there were a set of doctors who were still not prepared to do very much. Then one doctor came along, and I will thank him for the rest of my life, and insisted that three times was too much. And actually he was the one who pushed further in to the problem. [. . .] So I did feel that I wished they’d have listened to me a little more. I felt that three times was enough for them to listen to me. I knew in my heart there was something wrong, oh, that’s a pun isn’t it [laughs]. It just seems as if the nurses were more aware of actual people’s feelings and more aware of what was going on with me.\n\nHA22, female, MI in 2003 aged 63 years\n\nThe decision to seek help is a complex and incremental process and the event of an ‘emergency’ is coconstructed by multiple audiences rather than arrived at by the patient in isolation.104 Partners (or in some cases other family members or coworkers) were described as having played a major role in encouraging the patient to seek help for initial symptoms. Some patients were unaware that delayed admission is likely to result in reduced treatment options and decreased treatment success. Partners frequently pushed their symptomatic spouse to seek medical help or made a call to the GP or emergency service at their own initiative.\n\nHad my tea, didn’t feel well. Went in to the front room. Chest pains started and my arm started the pain and then my wife who was a nurse sort of said to me, ‘lift up your arm over your head’ and ‘did that relieve it?’ ‘No, pain was getting worse’. So I made my way upstairs. Got ready for bed and by that time I got to the bed, my wife had phoned for an ambulance and. I was taken in to [the local hospital].\n\nHA06, male, MI in 1996 aged 70 years\n\nSome patients specifically instructed their partner to call for help, thus effectively relying on someone else to make the case for an emergency response on their behalf. Patients who live alone and do not have this option and support might be at particular risk of delay in getting help.\n\nIn this interview study, few patients and spouses directly called for an ambulance. Even in cases where patients themselves suspected MI, several still chose to consult a GP first ( , yellow-bordered). Some patients who sought help from their local surgery or GP experienced additional delays due to appointment waiting times and the risk of misdiagnoses (see , red-bordered).\n\nFIGURE 12\n\nDelays in hospital admission. Number in shape: participant interview ID number. Participant sex is indicated by shape fill colour (blue = male; green = female). Participant age at diagnosis is indicated by shape form (square = diagnosed (more...)\n\nPatients whose GPs knew them well sometimes felt that knowledge of their general health, typical health behaviour and personality had helped the GP to realise that that something could be seriously wrong. In the following account, the GP had picked up that the man’s wife was very worried when they spoke on the phone.\n\nOne morning [I was] waking up and just not feeling well at all and of course my wife has always been a person who could recognise when I wasn’t well and she said, ‘You’re not well?’ I says, ‘No’. She says, ‘I’ll get the doctor’. And that was the occasion when the doctor came, dropped everything at his surgery, was in the middle of surgery and came straight round. But in the meantime he’d alerted the paramedics because he did say, ‘that he’d recognised in her voice that there was something seriously wrong’. He got here, the paramedics virtually followed him and they took me in to hospital again.\n\nHA20, male, MI in 2000 aged 66 years\n\nPatients may struggle to accurately describe their symptoms or may understate their impact. People staffing telephone helplines, receptionists and GPs may need to listen to and question patients very carefully to identify when something is seriously wrong. A man who was admitted several days after his initial MI felt that his symptoms were not taken seriously by an unfamiliar GP.\n\nI do appreciate the difficulties that GPs face and that my own case was particularly deceptive, but [. . .] I still think I should have been referred to hospital as a matter of urgency. If a doctor is presented with a sixty-something life-long smoker, not long retired from a responsible and stressful occupation, who seldom attends the surgery and is obviously very concerned about the kind of pain which shouts ‘heart attack’, then, even though other diagnostic features may conflict, he should be given the benefit of the doubt. [. . .] The common cab rank system in larger group surgeries militates against a doctor getting to know patients. Until he retired, I saw the same doctor very infrequently over about twenty years. I am confident that he would have taken me seriously had he still been in practice. I suppose my experience is exceptional, but I do wonder how many people who are referred to hospital expire before their first consultation. I have now moved to another practice and no longer see this doctor.\n\nHA04, male, had MI in 2002 aged 62 years\n\nSymptoms may not be those conventionally associated with heart attack; patients may lack the knowledge and vocabulary to describe symptoms with confidence. Even those who suspect a heart attack may be reluctant to self-diagnose and instead trust that health professionals will recognise the need for urgent action. One woman who said that she had initially suspected that she might be having a heart attack was reassured when, after describing her symptoms, the receptionist gave her a regular GP appointment.\n\n[My ex-husband] came and I told him and he said, ‘Well, phone the doctor straight away’. So I did and I spoke to the triage nurse and she said, ‘Come in at half past eleven’. This was about half past eight in the morning because there weren’t any appointments. She did ask me to describe the symptoms and everything but obviously they weren’t bad and I didn’t have the crushing pain or anything. I just thought, ‘oh I’m going to have [a heart attack]’. But when she said, ‘Come at half eleven’, I thought, ‘oh I must be alright then’. So I went at half eleven and saw the doctor and he said, ‘I think you’d better go down to the hospital. It’ll be quicker if you’re husband takes you, rather than me calling an ambulance’. [. . .] So I went to the hospital and [um] they admitted me. [. . .] When I spoke to the triage nurse, she did ask me what I would consider the right questions. But whether I gave the wrong answer, I don’t know, I could only tell her what I felt and she obviously felt that it didn’t sound serious enough because to me, it didn’t feel serious enough, other than I did say, ‘I felt funny and I’d never felt that before’. And I think your instinct tells you, this is something you’d never had before. I knew I hadn’t had it before. I knew I’d had indigestion before. But she obviously – she misinterpreted what I was saying, I would say.\n\nHA32, female, MI in 2003 aged 53 years\n\nIn another example, a woman in her thirties kept seeking help for 5 months because she was concerned about her irregular heartbeat. She was diagnosed with panic attacks before eventually being admitted for MI. The repeated experience of being told her symptoms were imagined made her doubt herself and caused conflict in her relationship as well as shaking her trust in the medical profession.\n\nI never had an ECG done until I had, the day I had the heart attack, never [. . .] I felt like I was, I knew I wasn’t going mad but they made me feel like I was. They made me feel like I wasn’t normal, you know, and I was thinking, ‘God, why do I keep thinking like this?’ You know, thinking that there was something wrong with the way I was thinking because I was being told there was nothing wrong and then I was thinking, well, to me it feels like there’s something wrong. So I felt, I felt hurt, you know, that, and the day when they give me the, the tablets to like calm me down and so when I, I came home and showed my partner those tablets, you know, he started saying to me, ‘you see, they think you’re mad, you know, you’re imagining it. You’ve got to calm down and stop worrying about it and stop freaking out about it because there’s nothing wrong’. So, you know, that, so it’s not only you haven’t got, it’s like everybody’s against you, you know, you feel like no-one’s taking you seriously. [. . .] But I knew there was something wrong.\n\nHA33, female, MI in 2003 aged 36 years\n\nKey emotions\n\nAnxiety, shock, denial, despair, disbelief.\n\nMyocardial infarction can be an extremely frightening and life-threatening event, and many patients initially think that they might die.\n\nI was just lying there and they’d given me a lot of morphine so I wasn’t really aware of things going on around me. All I kept saying to people, like ‘can you help me, can you help me?’ I said. And when the doctor come, at first he said, ‘I think it could be pleurisy’, and I was going, ‘oh no, it’s not pleurisy’. But when, actually another doctor come after that and then she told me, ‘Yes, you’re having a heart attack, [name]. We need to get you to coronary care’. And I was going, ‘Am I going to die? Am I going to die?’\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years\n\nBefore their MI, many said that their understanding of what happens during a heart attack had been very limited, but that the words carried a sense of dread and, if not death, certainly an end to the kind of lives they had led until then. One woman recalled how, after an ECG, her GP told her that she had experienced a silent MI 5 months previously; she felt ill prepared and shocked by the diagnosis.\n\nIt was a huge shock. I remember saying to the doctor, I said ‘Do you realise you’ve just given me a death sentence’. And she was ever so sweet. I was, wasn’t very nice to her, I must be honest, because it was such a shock but there we are. [. . .] I burst into tears. She cried because I cried. She was very, very sweet. She gave me a box of tissues and all that. I just couldn’t speak. I felt as though the bottom had dropped out of my world and that I was going to die the next day. I thought she was going to send me to hospital, which immediately panicked me but she didn’t. There’s no way to describe really how I felt apart from being absolutely devastated.\n\nHA01, female, MI in 2003 aged 62 years\n\nOne man said that receiving the diagnosis made him feel even worse than he did before he knew what was wrong.\n\n[At] that time I don’t know this heart attack, but the words ‘heart attack’ that’s very heavy words, you know. Everybody is scared. Before I heard this word I was feeling better, but when the doctors told me that, ‘you’ve had a heart attack and you are a heart patient’ and after that my feeling was not better. Because life [is] falling down, you know. You cannot run, you cannot eat of your choice. You cannot work of your choice, like this, like this, you know. Life [is] very badly disturbed.\n\nHA25, male, MI in 2001 aged 49 years\n\nOther patients described themselves as responding more calmly but experienced similar feelings about the threat of dying and the loss of their previous life.\n\nI suppose it was perfectly typical feelings of shock, and of regret that it happened so soon, or that my life was coming to a completely different phase and that I would be disabled as it were for the rest of my life, however long that would be.\n\nHA09, male, MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nAt the other extreme, patients with very mild symptoms and no pain may fail to appreciate the severity of MI, especially if they are able to return home very quickly. Health professionals should gauge the patient’s view of the severity of their MI so that they can appropriately reinforce the importance of secondary prevention before discharge (see also Preparation for discharge).\n\nI did not feel ill [when I was admitted]. I knew that at that stage I did not feel capable of doing things that I would’ve been capable of doing beforehand but I could wander quite happily around the hospital without feeling out of breath, without feeling the need to sit down. And I suppose the seriousness of what I had suffered just wasn’t evident to me.\n\nHA10, male, MI in 2003 aged 63 years\n\nI found the second attack much more of a pull up, I did take heed of that one. And the fact that I had a really good GP as well, who calls a spade a spade, he doesn’t go around corners, who said, ‘you have two choices,’ he said, ‘you can go back to work and you can die or you can seek medical retirement and hopefully continue a good standard of life’. So I took notice of him as well. I found it very depressing realising that I was not immortal, but as I say we fought through that and came out of the other end, which was wonderful.\n\nHA08, male, mild MI in 1989 aged 40 years and more severe MI in 2001\n\nPatients usually appreciate explicit and honest communication about their chances of survival, especially if they are brave enough to have asked the question. Conscious of the pressures under which health professionals operate, patients sometimes acknowledged that talking about the possibility of death is a difficult conversation to have for doctors and nurses, too.\n\nSome of them, there are one or two who’ve been very good and sat down and explained stuff to me but most of them aren’t too keen, I think that’s mainly a time issue and some of it’s about it’s because they don’t normally do it, there’s a training, there would be a training issue there. But yes, I must admit it’d be a difficult conversation to have with people, because if you know they’re not going to live very long or they’re likely to suffer, would you be the one that’d want to tell them that?\n\nHA05, male MI in 2001 aged 57 years\n\nPatients’ accounts of receiving the diagnosis illustrate some of the aspects of health professionals’ communication style that they experienced as helpful or less helpful. One man spoke very positively about the clear explanations he had received from the consultant straight after his admission to hospital.\n\nA lot of things then happened very quickly. But one of the things that needed to happen I think, was for the consultant to explain (a) what had happened to me but (b) what was required. What he said was that I had had a heart attack and the next few hours were crucial and what was really important, if possible, was to try and attack the clot that would be in my, the part of the heart that the clot would be in. You know I’m not physiologically terribly well-tuned, I’m afraid. He explained – I mean I was very impressed actually because he squatted down and spoke to me at my level. He explained that there were risks attached to this process [. . .] Every intervention was explained to me. [. . .] And, you know, what was very clearly being stated was that, you know, this was the crucial time, you know, that if they were able to intervene successfully now, then my long term prospects of survival, because I mean, I think there was an explicitness that I wouldn’t necessarily survive. My long term prospects of survival and indeed full recovery, were very importantly conditional upon that.\n\nHA02, male, MI in 2003 aged 54 years\n\nAnother woman found it reassuring not only to be prepared for the technicalities of the treatment but also to be told that it was normal to feel tearful and emotional.\n\nAs soon as I was there [in hospital] they explained to me I was going to be tearful, it’s a big thing, and they explained all my feelings I was going to have. I’m going to do a lot of crying and they explained that they’re going to put this drug in me to get rid of the clot and everything, they just explained every inch of the way what was happening and how I was going to feel. And they was right, everything they said, they was right and they was there, I mean in the night when I was frightened, they was standing at the side of my bed in the middle of night talking to me for an hour or two. They was absolutely brilliant, they was there answering any question.\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years\n\nPeople in the study described feeling reassured by the calm and professional manner in which health professionals had explained the risks and possible consequences of the planned interventions. Patients value health professionals who manage to convey hope and empathy alongside medical accuracy.\n\nEverybody was perfectly civil and, and answered my questions. [. . .] And when the big cheese came in to the ward and I asked him about my prognosis, he smiled and he said, ‘well look,’ he said, ‘you’re here, you’re asking the question. Forty per cent of people who have their first heart attack don’t live to see the day, the next day. So you’ve survived,’ he said, ‘and it appears you’ve survived the previous one as well’. So that was extremely helpful.\n\nHA09, male, MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nHowever, another man described a less positive encounter; he and his wife had nicknamed a certain consultant ‘Dr Death’ due to his brusque manner when describing the possible risks of bypass surgery.\n\n[The consultant] he also wasn’t convinced I’d actually make it through the, the coronary artery bypass. He was surprised that I’d actually made it through that, so like he’s not the sort of guy you want on a football team to gee you up before a game, ‘Hey lads if you keep it down to 10, you’ll do well’. [laughter] He’s not one of those that you want on your team. I think he’s probably going to think he’s trying to give it like it could be, but he probably overdoes how bad it could be. You don’t want an over realistic view but similarly you don’t want to be told that just ‘Well, no it, you could be dead’, because I think everybody knows if it’s heart, you know, if it’s a serious heart problem, yes of course you could be dead, you wouldn’t be here otherwise, [he] just slightly overplayed it.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2003 aged 37 years\n\nPatients may respond to a diagnosis of MI in very different ways. Health professionals should be mindful of the different meanings the diagnosis can carry depending on the patient’s unique situation, as well as more evident factors such as their age and stage of life. One older woman said that her overwhelming response to receiving the diagnosis was gratitude to still be alive.\n\nI was really pleased I was here you see because lots of people die in the middle of a heart attack. You ask me how I felt, well I felt pleased to be here, still be alive. I think that’s the main thing, I thought ‘well I got over that one and if there’s any more I’m going to get over that’. And as the doctor said an operation could put it right, which it did. It’s strange, it’s a lot to do with the mind, how you tell yourself how you feel.\n\nHA15, female, heart attack in 2000, aged 81 years\n\nHA09 (quoted above) was also aware, because his doctor told him, that he was one of the lucky ones to have survived a first heart attack. However, many of the younger patients felt anger, shock and disbelief to have had a heart attack. Now that many people do not have children until they are in their late twenties and thirties, it is not uncommon for people in their 40s and 50s to still have dependent children at home. Patients may worry about financial and career implications for themselves and their families. They may have different expectations about length and level of recovery than retired patients in their seventies or eighties, although many older patients may also have caring responsibilities. Younger patients talked about a sense of disbelief and the perception that heart attacks were something they associated with their parents’ generation.\n\nI was petrified. Well, part petrified and part believing that they must have it – it must be wrong, you know, I was in the pub yesterday. This all happened on Saturday, I was in the pub yesterday and I’m – and I don’t feel any worse. And then I did start feeling rotten. But I think the whole consequences of it all were dawning on me. And you know, ‘heart attack’, my dad had had a heart attack but he was seventy odd. But it just didn’t – I just didn’t think it could’ve happened.\n\nHA11, male, MI in 1999 aged 42 years\n\nI felt like the world was coming to an end. You feel absolutely shattered, you know really tired and quite depressed really. [. . .] You know, I was only 47 years old. ‘I’ve got a life.’ You know, I have ambitions to reach 97. And you think ‘Well all this is coming to an end; I’m on my way out. This is what my parents should be doing you know, it’s not where I should be. This is for older people, much older people’.\n\nHA18, MI in 1995 aged 47 years\n\nHowever, health professionals need to consider patients’ individual life circumstances rather than make assumptions based on age alone. The disruption of MI to daily life may be just as severe for older patients as for younger ones, but their horizons of expectation for recovery and their resources for coping and adjustment may be very different.\n\nThose who considered themselves to have led healthy and physically active lifestyles before their MI may particularly struggle to come to terms with the diagnosis. One man, who found it difficult to accept that someone like him could have had a heart attack in his early fifties, explained that it made him feel better when an even younger patient came onto the ward.\n\nI must admit, I felt depressed when I found out I’d had a heart attack. ‘Why me?’ All my life I’d been working on my feet and I thought I was fit. I thought, ‘Why me? There’s other people who sit down at desks, you know bigger than me, so ‘Why me?’ and I was angry as well, it’s hard to explain. You don’t think you’ve survived and thank god you have, but it was a couple of days later when somebody else came in to the hospital who was younger than me, because everyone else in this ward was older and I was the youngest, and when this person came in who was younger than me, I felt a lot better. It’s a terrible thing to say now, but I did.\n\nHA29, male, MI in 1993 aged 54 years\n\nMore detailed explanations about the multiple risk factors for MI might help to dispel risk stereotypes as well as provide explanations which can be repeated to family and friends who are curious about why the MI happened.\n\nConversely, patients with sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets and habits may be sensitive to either spoken or unspoken suggestions that they are to blame for their MI and feel very defeatist about diagnosis. These patients may benefit from empathic education that provides encouragement. Previous qualitative research has illustrated how patients’ early sense-making about the possible causes of their heart attack may impact on their motivation for behaviour change and engagement in secondary prevention over time.\n\nHaving to tell partners and family members about the diagnosis, and explain why it happened, can be an additional burden for patients. Many patients in this study described having to tell their family as a very difficult and emotional event. While patients themselves feel vulnerable and struggle to make sense of their diagnosis, having to worry about the reactions of their loved ones causes extra stress. Some patients whose parents were still alive decided not to tell them to protect them from worry.\n\nAnd the worst part was, was telling people. I had to tell my sister. And obviously she was very upset. I was [. . .] Right so and I, then I phoned husband at work and he came home and I phoned, well it was actually my daughter-in-law I spoke to I, I couldn’t get hold of my son – I’ve three boys and – the youngest. Anyway the daughter-in-law came [um] along with my sister and we sat and we talked about it. I was very, very upset. Couldn’t believe, I couldn’t believe it because I felt so well. And I’d had no, no warning, no sign, no anything.\n\nHA01, female, MI in 2003 aged 63 years\n\nHA02 explained that he was particularly worried about his young daughter’s reaction to learning the diagnosis; he and his wife decided to delay telling her until his condition had improved. A couple of patients said they had found it helpful when hospital staff offered to talk to their children.\n\nI suppose the thing that I’m most worried about actually was the impact upon my nine year old daughter [. . .] Over the last 2 or 3 years the only people that she would have been aware of that had had heart attacks; one was her headmistress’s husband that we knew very well, and he just dropped down dead in the street at about my age. And then last summer her best friend’s father, who was a very fit, 64-year-old professor at the university. He just dropped down dead while in Italy, while on holiday in Italy. Therefore, our concerns were that for [my daughter], heart attacks would be seen as being something that killed you. So initially that evening, my wife, didn’t say to, didn’t say to [my daughter] that I’d had a heart attack. She said ‘you know that daddy had a bad pain this morning, well he had to go to hospital but he’s fine now’. So it was about a day later before [my daughter] was aware that I’d had a heart attack.\n\nHA02, male, MI in 2003 aged 54 years\n\nEspecially in situations where diagnosis was not straightforward and patients and their families received mixed or changing messages, this could cause strong feelings of anger and guilt among the family.\n\nMy husband, because she’d told me there nothing wrong with me and I was fine, I says to my husband, ‘well you might as well go to work’. So he went to work, well he went home, he fetched my daughter and they come back. He didn’t go to work, he come back. Well, he was bitter because he’d left me and I was having a heart attack. So he felt he’d let me down and I felt he’d let me down because he’d gone, he should have stopped, even though I told him to go. And there was all this, but it really upset him to come and see me all wired up and they’d told him there was nothing wrong with me. So you know, they was crying, my daughter and my husband, and I was crying. It’s very emotional.\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years\n\nPatients may also feel ill prepared to answer questions from partners and family members, and value the support of staff to explain things accurately and at the appropriate level. Health professionals should check if patients would like support to inform family and friends and answer their initial questions. Recommendations for websites and other resources are also appreciated by patients and families.\n\nPatients’ emotional responses to diagnosis develop over time; those who seem to be coping well initially may nevertheless require psychological support at a later stage. Some patients said that it had taken several weeks or even months for them to emotionally respond to the diagnosis.\n\nI think I was just stunned [um] to the point where I didn’t, I didn’t fully take it in and I’ve spoken to my doctor since and he said, ‘When, when you came to see me,’ he said, ‘you were so calm and you’d had a heart attack, and you were saying, “oh I think it might be a bit of indigestion”, you were very calm,’ he said, ‘and I think it suddenly hit you after a few weeks and that’s why the anxiety came’. It did suddenly hit me that you know I could have died. But it didn’t affect me at the time, I just got on with it.\n\nHA32, female, MI in 2003 aged 53 years\n\nWell with hindsight, you pick up the terminology and I realise now that you just go in to a state of denial, you just don’t accept it. You just refuse to believe that this is happening to me. I enjoyed super health all my life and I worked until I was sixty-five and this happened within three months of me retiring. It just seems so wrong and you refuse to accept it.\n\nHA28, white male, married, MI aged 65 years\n\nPatients with a very stoic and calm response at the time of diagnosis might also be the ones who put up a front towards friends and family and who avoid seeking out peer support. However, maintaining an image of strength and invincibility over a long time is likely to be emotionally exhausting. Previous qualitative research in this area suggests that patients’ ways of coping continue to be influenced by gender stereotypes.105 Hegemonic ideals of masculinity mean that men may find it especially difficult to come to terms with the feeling of physical vulnerability that the experience of MI brings (see also Part 6: emotional impact of MI for patients and their families and Part 7: regaining body confidence: patients’ experiences of physical rehabilitation).\n\nKey emotions\n\nAnxiety, worry, lack of familiarity, trust, gratitude, social comparison.\n\nPatients may experience the hospital environment, and especially the technical equipment of the cardiac unit, as reassuring or threatening, depending on their perspective. Health professionals can help put patients at ease in this unfamiliar environment with a reassuring and flexible attitude. Small things can make a big difference, such as access to a telephone.\n\n[In the cardiac ward] I went into a section which is equipped with full monitoring equipment and I was on various drips and goodness knows what else. It’s an intimidating place to find yourself in because all this monitoring equipment is all, emitting all strange sorts of bleeps and noises and it’s very difficult to relax.\n\nHA10, male, MI in 2003 aged 63 years\n\nI was allowed to sit up and have something to eat, make a few phone calls, which was good because it felt a bit like, more like normality. [. . .] I was able to make phone calls to people, although I think people were quite surprised to hear from me, but it was quite therapeutic, hearing somebody else’s voice.\n\nHA11, male, MI in 1999 aged 42 years\n\nAnother patient felt grateful that he was given a private room so that his young family could come and visit him without disturbing other patients.\n\nThe first night I was taken off the monitors, I was actually in little separate room which was fortunate because I’ve a big family and, [um] they thought it’d be, because they’d a room would be easier if I was in that rather than in a general ward, which was lovely of them because it meant that people could come and go. Because as I say there’s my wife and my young son, well my young daughter as well, my daughter’s only a year older than me son.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2003 aged 37 years\n\nSeveral patients in the study said that the first few hours and the first night after their heart attack had been the most difficult and a time when they had felt very worried that they might die alone without anyone noticing. A few said that they had felt so anxious that they had found it difficult to get any sleep. These patients were extremely grateful for friendly gestures from health professionals such as a cup of tea in the middle of the night, someone holding their hand, a chat or words of encouragement, and said these things had made a huge difference to them.\n\nThe first night I was taken off the monitors, I was getting panic attacks [pause], because prior, at least if they’re on, I mean in, in reality if you suddenly go crash, the chance of them actually being there watching probably aren’t that strong really [laugh] anyway. The times they do go bing-bing-bing, and nobody comes [laugh], they’d probably look at you and go ‘Oh, forget that, there’s nothing, nothing really wrong because you usually you’ve just pulled it off or something’, 99 times out of 100 it’s just a technical glitch of course. [um] But the first night I didn’t have them I was really quite worried and I called them a couple of times and they were very understanding and very helpful and they actually give me a, a little bit of a sedative to ultimately to sleep, because I just couldn’t sleep, because you’re just so aware of your heartbeat.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2001 aged 37 years\n\nI found the staff excellent. I found the staff excellent, you know they said to me ‘you’ll be up and running in a few days you know’. One nurse, an Irish girl if I may say, was on night duty. They used to come down and see me every night about, I used to be awake half the night, and make me a cup of coffee about 3 o’clock in the morning, and we’d have a chat and things like that. They did make life good for me.\n\nHA06, male, MI in 2003 aged 70 years\n\nPatients were aware that hospital staff were very busy and often pressurised for time, so they valued it all the more when doctors or nurses provided emotional support by being available to listen or answer questions.\n\nIt was the very attitude of them [that made me feel secure], you know. They were very, they were very caring and they sort of seemed as if they really understood how you were feeling. And I was grateful for that because it wasn’t all this starchy business you know, it was nice. And my family were able to come in and they were around me but I was all wired up to everything you know and that is a bit frightening.\n\nHA35, female, MI in 2001 aged 77 years\n\nMany patients spoke very highly of the coronary care specialist staff. By and large, patients felt a great deal of gratitude and trust in the competence of the health professionals who looked after them. Often this was ascribed to personal characteristics and the manner in which they talked to patients, rather than age, seniority or appearance. One man described how the consultant filled him with trust and made him relax despite the fact that the consultant was covered in blood when they first met.\n\nAnd within about half an hour of arriving, the consultant came in, introduced himself. He’d just, he must’ve come almost straight from surgery because he had – he looked like a butcher. He had a gown on that was covered [laughs] well it had blood all over it. He said, ‘Oh don’t worry, don’t worry, it’s highly unlikely we’ll have to open you up’. But he had this air about him that I was, you know it was just his actions, his voice. I mean he wasn’t very old, he probably wasn’t much older than me, if at all and he was just, I mean it just made me feel relaxed and felt like I was in good hands and that, all the time that meant so much to me that you know, my trust was in these people and as long as I felt that they knew what they were doing, I was going to be all right and that things weren’t going to get any worse.\n\nHA11, male, MI in 1999 aged 42 years\n\nHowever, some patients thought that the level of information provision during their hospital stay could have been improved. While those who asked a lot of questions usually got answers, others assumed that they would be told what they needed to know without asking. This did not always happen, for example when staff changed. This man was too preoccupied to think of the questions he might need to ask about his stress test.\n\nAnother thing that upset me at the time; you’re allocated a nurse when you first get in to the unit. Now then, that nurse after two or three days, her father was taken seriously ill, so she was stood down. Allocated another nurse. So one nurse didn’t know what the other one had told me and now I know I should have asked questions but you’re not, you withdraw in to yourself. You’re angry at being there. ‘Why me at my age?’ I was only 54, coming up for 55 and when I was discharged and went back several weeks’ time for a stress test, I didn’t know what that was. I didn’t know it was a walking machine or a running machine. I didn’t know because I hadn’t been told and I didn’t know to ask.\n\nHA29, male, MI in 1993 aged 54 years\n\nThose who stayed in hospital for longer periods sometimes found that information provision became more patchy as time went on. Patients appreciate health professionals who take the time to explain diagnostic procedures and interventions, even if they are unable to truly share in the decisions. One man observed that the consultants seemed to vary the amount of information they provided to patients. He addressed doctors by their first names to create an equal atmosphere for communication. He appreciated it when a consultant did a drawing of the heart for him to clarify his explanations.\n\nThe thing that struck me because you know, hospitals are not private places so although you have screens round, it’s impossible not to hear other conversations going on. And it struck me that there were different levels of information given by doctors. Some of it maybe on the estimation of what the patient will receive and I think some of it is just to do with the assertiveness of the patient. [. . .] I was always fairly questioning and wanted to find out what was going on. I found that actually a very good technique given that the doctors all call you by your Christian name, was I just called them by their Christian name, you know and it’s sort of a – just as a way of getting equality.\n\nHA02, male, MI in 2003 aged 54 years\n\nThe asymmetrical power relationship between patients and senior medical staff can be detrimental to the quality of communication. Health professionals can help to redress this power imbalance by making eye contact, talking to patients at the same level (e.g. sitting down by the bedside rather than standing up) and adjusting their manner of speaking in line with patients’ level of understanding.\n\nChange-over of care between different members of staff could mean that changes in drugs were not adequately communicated. HA05 felt it was advisable to double-check with staff that they were getting the correct medication.\n\nSubsequently and while you’re in, when they’re doing the rounds, etc., I don’t think you get an awful lot of information there. I think they just tend to gloss over things and you, you have to ask, you have to check things, because I’ve had one or two instances of problems with wrong dosages of drugs and things being stopped and yet you ask and, ‘Oh no, we shouldn’t be doing that’, Well, you just have’ and you know . . . Not everybody’s necessarily so aware or, or you know, would ask the right questions.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2003 aged 37 years\n\nExplaining treatment decisions and drug regimens to patients in more detail may thus provide an additional safeguard against mix-ups due to miscommunication and human error.\n\nDuring their stay on a cardiac ward, patients invariably come into close contact with other coronary care patients. Meeting other patients and witnessing their treatment involved both positive and negative experiences. Several patients said they had found it helpful to talk to others ‘in the same boat’. This man said that even though he would have preferred a room by himself, he experienced the company of other patients on the ward as supportive.\n\nIt was quite good being in the ward together [. . .] They were all angina sufferers so it wasn’t quite the same. I sort of leapfrogged them in the scales of who had what wrong, but they understood the pain and the fear of it and it was like suddenly being in a little club. So it was actually quite helpful. I didn’t really like it from the moment I walked in because I’d rather be on my own. But I think it was actually a very good thing because you could actually talk to people you’d never met before in your life about really personal things because they were all in the same boat. So it was actually very good.\n\nHA11, male, MI in 1999 aged 42 years\n\nAnother man, who had to return to hospital for a bypass operation, described how the company and atmosphere on the ward helped to improve his experience of the surgery.\n\nThey transferred me into a side ward with three young lads in because they thought I would cheer them up. I think the reverse happened, but it was great. There was a 14-year-old with a lung problem who eventually had to get it cut out. There was another young lad with a concave chest, which they were going to take his ribs out and reverse them; a procedure they had never done at the hospital before and there was another chap who was quite an early age to be having bypasses. So we were mixed bag, we settled each other down and the nurses helped. The nurses were quite young, a lot of training nurses, which was surprising. But we were a good mix and we helped each other out and we helped each other to get over their fears, (a) before the surgery and (b) after.\n\nHA12, male, MI in 2003 aged 65 years\n\nSome patients said that comparing their own fate with that of others had helped them to put things in perspective. Seeing other patients make a good recovery gave them hope, but it could also be distressing to realise that fellow patients had died despite being cared for in hospital. Those who were in hospital for several days became aware of the staff behaviour that indicated that someone ‘hadn’t made it’.\n\nBut the one thing we, looking round the ward, all had, seemed to have in common is everybody looked most unlike heart problem people in that they all looked fit but to be there they had to be suffering from a heart problem. And I suppose the one very distressing thing was that you soon became aware that, not frequently but on a number of occasions during the time that I was there, people were being admitted and they didn’t make it and we had the all too familiar thing happen where all the curtains were drawn and you knew that somebody else hadn’t made it and they were on their way.\n\nHA10, male, MI in 2003 aged 63 years\n\nThose who are initially in intensive or high-dependency care may find that it is a difficult transition to the ward. The following quote illustrates the difference that a sympathetic nurse made to a patient who was finding it hard to deal with the noise on the ward.\n\nOther people in intensive care had been so quiet and peaceful. Back into a ward, there’s people shouting and there’s a television on, and I, I was frightened, it was horrendous. I can’t explain it. I wasn’t frightened of having another heart attack. It, it was just this tremendous noise; people just shouting across to each other from one bed to another. Turning the television up, any noise at all, was, was horrific. It was, I guess I was seeking peace, peace and quiet. So any noise at all was, was magnified. It was, it wasn’t somebody talking, people to me seemed to be shouting and screaming and I didn’t need that. It was the last thing I wanted; I just purely sought peace and I wasn’t getting it. [. . .] And there was a very sympathetic sister on the ward who realised I was badly affected by the noise, and she moved me into a side ward for a couple of days and then from there into a much quieter ward than the original one.\n\nHA30, male, MI in 1994 aged 53 years\n\nKey emotions\n\nUncertainty, worry, anxiety, trust and confidence in health professionals’ competence.\n\nThe data analysed in this report were collected in 2002–3. Since then, treatment options for MI have significantly developed, and nowadays many patients will experience minimally invasive procedures and very brief hospital stays. How patients experience these newer forms of treatment could not be explored on the basis of this set of interviews. However, other qualitative research in this area has suggested that while the ‘ “high-tech” procedure of primary angioplasty and fast recovery contributes to high levels of patient satisfaction’, ‘the feeling of being fixed and lack of belief at having had a heart attack may have implications for uptake of rehabilitation and lifestyle changes following hospital discharge’ (p. 85).106 Patients may tend to see their condition as ‘acute’ rather than ‘chronic’ and their treatment as curative.107\n\nInvolving patients in medical decision-making is now widely regarded as both ethical and beneficial. However, previous qualitative research suggests that health professionals and patients view patient involvement in treatment decisions in coronary care mostly in terms of information provision.108,109\n\nMany patients will experience feelings of anxiety before having surgical treatment. Health professionals can alleviate fear and uncertainty by keeping patients informed about what will be happening to them and the possible outcomes.\n\nThe unknown, the thought of having your chest sliced open, your ribs cut open and your ribs expanded, your heart being handled, being on a life support machine and there’s always a chance even with the best surgeons in the world that you may not come out of it. That really frightened me.\n\nHA17, male, MI in 1980 and 1998 aged 49 years and 67 years, bypass surgery in 1988\n\nWhen I went in [for the bypass operation] I was very, very apprehensive, I knew he had a 98% success rate and I kept saying to myself I’ve got to be one of the 98 not the 2. I’m a quite positive person really and you know I felt I’m going to be a 98 not a 2, but I was very apprehensive.\n\nHA12, male, MI in 2003 aged 65 years\n\nHealth professionals should also consider the possible effects that a patient undergoing surgery may have on partners and other family members.\n\nWhen I had the bypass, because I was down the theatre 10 ½ hours and [my husband] was expecting me to be back up in 3, he went through hell. He didn’t think I was going to come out of that theatre. And apparently, you know some of the patients’ relatives were saying to me, ‘I’ve never seen a man crying so much’. And every time they went out and said, ‘she’s still in there?’ he’d start crying. He said ‘there’s something wrong, there’s something wrong’. Because the surgeon had told him I’d be out in about 3 hours and when it was 10 ½ hours he . . . and I didn’t know nothing, obviously, I’m asleep. But he went through that. He’s gone through a lot.\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years\n\nPrevious qualitative research has identified the main existential concerns in surgeon–patient interactions as surviving uncertainty, negotiating responsibility and trusting the doctor’s proficiency. It has also been suggested that when handling uncertainty, doctors are focused on imparting complex information about risk, while for patients, the manner of information provision may serve to establish doctors’ trustworthiness.110\n\nPositive encounters with staff included those who had made an effort to answer questions fully and provide explanations at an appropriate level. Nurses were usually thought to have more time to talk to patients, and to be better communicators, than surgeons or cardiac consultants.\n\nRushed as they were, they [cardiac ward nurses] always had time to talk to you about what was going on. They would explain procedures to you. I think you have to ask in some cases, but once you have asked, or once I had asked, they were quite willing to go through and tell you. I think they want to be fairly convinced that you aren’t going to panic or misconstrue what they’re saying, so maybe they’ll be a little bit guarded at first. But generally I think that they’re there to help you get better and if they perceive that what you’re asking is because you want to know and it’s going to help you get better, they’ll give you the right answers.\n\nHA23, male, MIs in 1991 and 1998 aged 49 years and 56 years\n\nThere are other barriers to the flow of information between patients and staff, as this woman suggests:\n\nIf you ask questions they answer you. If you don’t ask the question, obviously they’re not going to tell you because they don’t know that you want to know. I think probably they could say, ‘Is there anything that you want to know’. I mean they did, they did say that to me sometimes but I know some people are a bit befuddled or a bit in awe of doctors and frightened to ask or they don’t understand the technical terms or what have you.\n\nHA32, female, MI in 2003 aged 53 years\n\nA man voiced his dissatisfaction with the, in his view, disengaged and clipped exchanges he had had with senior clinicians.\n\nWhat I find so unhelpful is the standard mode of communication with patients that now seems to be adopted by senior clinicians. This is characterised by an absolutely minimalist attitude to factual or explanatory statements that results in a delivery so uninformative and terse that it inhibits any possibility of dialogue. The contrast between consultant--speak and the frank and easy communications that you just take for granted with your GP is stark. [. . .] It’s always possible to find excuses: there’s always the pressure to meet number targets and the chronic shortage of time. It may even be that the high academic intellectual demands of modern hi-tech hardware oriented medicine militates against the selection of good communicators. I recall an elderly lady on the next treadmill to me at a gym session bending my ear unmercifully about some consultant she had taken against in a big way. I hadn’t a clue whom she was talking about until she said, ‘I wouldn’t mind so much if only he would occasionally look me in the eye when he is talking to me’.\n\nHA04, male, MI in 2002 aged 62 years\n\nPatients differed in their information preferences. A number were keen to know as much detail as possible and said that they had been assertive enough to ask the questions. Others were satisfied to have a rough idea of what would happen to them and felt happy to leave the details to medical staff. As the following man observed, providing information at the appropriate level of detail for an individual patient can be challenging for clinicians.\n\nI then enquired as to how [the defibrillator] was fitted. The surgeon actually expressed some surprise that I was interested in the technicalities and he said, and I quite understand and believe what he said, because I’ve found out since a lot patients shut their minds to ‘how’ and ‘why’. It must be a very difficult job for either surgeon or nursing staff to find the right level to pitch the information at, because everybody’s different. In the cath labs where they actually do all these insertions, do all the fancy work with the electrician [laughs], it, I was fascinated to watch it all on the screen and yet there were people who were in the same ward as I was, it was a little four-bedded ward, who asked for their eyes covering because they didn’t want to know.\n\nHA08, male, MI in 1989 aged 40 years\n\nAnother man emphasised the difference between the importance of being fully informed about the planned procedure and its attached risks and benefits, and not wanting to be bothered with the full technical details of the operation.\n\nWell, in truth there wasn’t much of a decision to be made [about having the angioplasty]. I had complete confidence in the medical team and they had a clear course of action in mind. There weren’t any options on offer to agonise about. In those circumstances you’d be foolish to do other than go with the flow. Always provided you had fully understood what you had let yourself in for, and subject to the condition, in my fastidious, or just plain nervous case that I wished to be wholly unaware of work in progress. I have never understood this morbid obsession with watching on a display monitor while people poke around your insides. When I next came to I had been fitted with a stent in my left anterior descending artery and diagonal branch. I gather this was thought to be a pretty successful conclusion.\n\nHA04, male, MI in 2002 aged 62 years\n\nOne woman acknowledged that it may be difficult to take in all relevant information about the treatments received at the time.\n\nI think sometimes we don’t take things in. It would be useful to be given a sheet, I would like a sheet saying what has actually happened to me. I don’t know what bit of my heart is affected, other than they’ve said it’s the back bit. That’s all, that’s all I heard. They obviously said where in proper technical terms but I didn’t take that in and I would like to know so I think that would be useful for people who want to know.\n\nHA32, female, MI in 2003 aged 53 years\n\nRegardless of their personal information preferences, most patients emphasised that their main concern was the feeling that they could trust the medical staff looking after them and had confidence in their professional expertise and competence. Some patients enquired about the surgeon’s success rates or years of practice in performing a particular procedure. Interpersonal skills were also important in promoting a feeling of trust (see also Part 3: experience of the hospital environment).\n\nOne of the things that I wanted to know from the surgeon was how many of these things had he done. Was he, sort of, did he know what he was doing and he told me, this was September, he told me by that time he had done about 140 bypass operations that year. So that was you know, quite reassuring. And I also asked him what the prognosis was and he told me that 95% of all cases of, who have bypass surgery are successful, and 5% are not. So you’ve got a 1 in 20, is it? yes 1 in 20 chance that something might go wrong. And I said ‘what can go wrong?’. He said ‘mostly what can go wrong is that you get some kind of sepsis and we can fix that’. So I thought the odds were pretty good, bearing in mind that my cardiologist said I’ve got to have this done, not much choice.\n\nHA09, male, MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nWhile very few patients described instances of shared decision-making, the case of one elderly patient illustrates how upsetting it can be when patients’ own values and priorities are ignored in the course of deciding treatment options. This woman in her early eighties said that she had been judged to be too old to be operated on. She felt that the medical agenda of minimising risk conflicted with her best interests as a patient.\n\n[I felt] devastated, devastated because they said, ‘oh yes, next week we will be taking you down to the theatre next week’ and when next week came they changed their minds because they brought another somebody else in who said, ‘Oh no, no, she’s too old’. And they said it in front of me, I’m too old and I felt so old, I felt ancient. Really, really I felt about 900 years old and I said, ‘well I don’t mind dying on the table, I won’t know anything about it’. But they said, ‘but we will and we don’t like to lose a patient’. But then I said, ‘you have a chance of saving one, too, haven’t you’. [. . .] I could quite understand they don’t want to lose a patient, it’s not good for them to lose a patient and if the chances are 50/50, I think they’d rather take their 50 on their side and have you die at home than on their table. That is fair enough, but then from the patient’s point of view, who hasn’t got much chance anyway, she would rather take the chance on the other side of the 50 and go ahead. Wouldn’t you?\n\nHA15, female, MI in 2000 aged 81 years\n\nThis patient eventually found a consultant who was willing to perform the operation and made a good recovery.\n\nKey emotions\n\nFrustration, grief, loss of confidence, stigma and isolation.\n\nIn the days, weeks and months following a heart attack, patients and their families need to adjust to life with a chronic health condition. Besides lifestyle modifications and adoption of new routines such as taking regular medications, patients need to come to terms with the disruption the MI has caused to their sense of identity.\n\n‘Loss of confidence’ was a phrase that was used by almost all patients in the sample when they were asked how the experience of MI had affected them emotionally. ‘Reassurance’ was what they said they most needed from health professionals. For some, the sense of vulnerability and threat was so severe that it led them to abandon activities they had previously enjoyed, leading into a negative spiral of avoidance and depression.\n\nAt the moment I don’t feel I ever will be confident enough again. And I, we were going to go on holiday with my sister to Portugal, because last year we went and we had a lovely time and we said we’d go again this year. I won’t fly. I don’t want to go which was a little bit upsetting for my sister. We had a few words because she didn’t understand how I felt. I don’t suppose she ever will understand how I felt, but there is no way I am leaving the country. And there’s no way I’m leaving Wales. It takes me all my time to go to [the local town] because if anything happens to me, I want to go to the hospital, the [local hospital] in [a nearby town].\n\nHA01, female, MI 2003 aged 63 years\n\nPatients who considered themselves in good health and had led an active lifestyle before their MI may feel that they have not only experienced a life-threatening event but have also lost an important part of their previous identity. A loss of confidence in the body can make people afraid to do any kind of exercise – even though most of them were well aware about the importance of physical activity for secondary prevention (see also Part 7: regaining body confidence: patients’ experiences of physical rehabilitation).\n\nA heart attack hits you emotionally as well, that’s what I found. I couldn’t believe it that you know that I’d done all that I could do to be fit, have the right diet, I don’t smoke, I’m not overweight. I just, you know, I just couldn’t believe and if I could have a heart attack, well lots of people said that to me, if you can have a heart attack anybody can. So that made me feel very humble.\n\nHA14, male, MI in 2003 aged 51 years\n\nPatients spoke of a continued sense of stigma surrounding MI and several patients said that they had been selective about who they had told. Those who had made use of peer support and community-based rehabilitation groups spoke very positively about the value of talking to others with similar experiences. However, some patients do not have easy access to this form of support. While some people may benefit from encouragement to use such resources, it is important to recognise that others do not want to meet other people who have had a MI; they may prefer the relative anonymity of websites or telephone helplines. Health professionals should, therefore, give patients addresses for online support groups as well as any locally available resources (see also Part 9: building a supportive environment: myocardial infarction patients’ ongoing support needs).\n\nPeople in the interviews often said that their partner had been a vital source of emotional support for them in the weeks and months following their heart attack. However, the experience of MI could affect the relationship and bring about a renegotiation of roles within the marriage. This could sometimes be a difficult process.\n\nI suppose having been the breadwinner. I’m from a generation that I never wanted my wife to go out to work. Maybe we were fortunate that we were in such a position that she didn’t have to. And following my initial heart attack, and certainly following my enforced medical retirement some thirteen years ago, I found it difficult, very difficult to come to terms with that and were my wife present, she would tell you that I made life quite difficult for her at that period. Partly related to the job that I had, I was used to being in a position of authority and I found it quite difficult to find a reason for being.\n\nHA08, MI in 1989 aged 40 years\n\nMale patients, in particular, said that they had found it difficult to pass on some of their previous responsibilities, such as driving, to their spouse. A few men who had to take early retirement on medical grounds said that they felt useless and emasculated following their MI. Findings from previous qualitative research confirm that men are at risk of experiencing a crisis of masculinity after MI.111 For women, on the other hand, it might be difficult to step back from previous domestic tasks and demand additional support from family members.\n\nSome patients also acknowledged that they themselves had become more difficult to be with and a few said that they had become much more short-tempered, possibly as a result of medication side effects.\n\nWell, you know you see the bad side of the thing, you’ve had a heart attack, how bad has it been, what’s the damage, are you going to have another one. If I do this I may have one. I mustn’t do this, I mustn’t do that. In a way it made life a bit hard for my wife. I realised that fully and the treatment I’m on, these various tablets, they do make you a little bit short tempered, I’m understand. And I snap at her sometimes when I shouldn’t. But that may be one of the side effects of it.\n\nHA06, male MI in 1996 aged 70 years\n\nMy wife got the, the brunt of my sort of emotional state and it’s something that the consultant had said that you know, I’d have ups and downs and that I might get tearful and if you think you want a good cry to, you know, just let it happen but it will pass. But everybody else was saying how marvellous I was doing and patting me on the back for handling this terrible thing so well. And I mean my wife was getting recognition for the support she’d given me as well but it was, I think it wasn’t fair that everybody was saying how fantastic I was handling it when my wife was getting the dark side.\n\nHA09, male, MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nI’m very, very glad that we had such, and still have such a strong marriage [um] because the black moods, the despair and very much out of character after the triple bypass initially had me breaking down and crying for no apparent reason. I could have been talking much as I am now, to either my wife or a friend or a colleague, and I would start to cry and to this day I couldn’t tell anybody why. I then got quite black moods, a case of ‘Why me?’, ‘Why is it happening to me?’ ‘What have I done, what have I done to deserve it?’ All the usual sayings and I think because it’s the nearest and dearest, the only person that’s with you at that time, you take out of them some of your own anguish, some of your own anger.\n\nHA08, MI in 1989 aged 40 years\n\nHealth professionals can play a positive role in mitigating the impact of MI on couples’ relationships by helping to prepare patients and their partners for the strains that might occur. Hearing accounts from other patients and partners may also help to understand points of conflict and develop strategies for dealing with marital tensions.\n\nSome patients in the study did not feel able to openly talk about their concerns with their partner because they did not want to worry them.\n\nI don’t think I can fully talk to my wife sometimes about my concerns because [sigh] I think she overly worries about it. On some things she, she gets then frightened and worried about it, and then I only then get upset for her, which doesn’t help me. So the point of trying to share it with somebody helping me, it just defeats, all I’m doing is telling her something that upsets her and I’m thinking where was the benefit in that, that, that’s not to say if there’s something we need to worry about and do something about, that I certainly shouldn’t be hiding something like that from her. But some of the concerns that you might just want to chat to somebody or you know, get off your chest, I wouldn’t do it with my wife now because of having seeing her react.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2003 aged 37 years\n\nHaving a named health professional who is easily accessible (perhaps via e-mail or a telephone messaging service) to provide reassurance on non-urgent concerns was greatly appreciated by patients. Several said that they had benefited from a trusting and supportive relationship with their cardiac nurse.\n\nPartners are likely to worry about the occurrence of a repeat attack, sometimes more than patients themselves, and they might also experience feelings of powerlessness and frustration. Initially after returning home, some patients said that they had felt ‘mollycoddled’ by an overprotective spouse.\n\nShe wouldn’t let me out of her sight, that was the main thing. She would have followed me to the toilet if she could. She wouldn’t let me go – there’s a shop 300 yards away from here where I go and buy a paper. Wouldn’t let me go and do that. She was very protective, it worried her a lot, more than I think it did me and I think that is the impact on people.\n\nHA12, male, MI in 2003 aged 65 years\n\nMany patients said they had found it very helpful when a consultant or nurse had talked to their partner to reassure them on the kinds of activities that were safe for patients to engage in during the period of recovery. Involving spouses in rehabilitation could also provide much-needed reassurance.\n\nWe found that a lot of the stress after the operation derived from the fact that she was more, more worried about, about what I could do than I was. And she was trying to hold me back all the time whereas I was always trying to go. And one of the benefits of joining the support group is precisely this, that the spouse has a chance to speak to other spouses and see you know, what you can do and what you can’t do and that takes away a lot of the stress of rehabilitation. [. . .] [Also] Dr X was very instrumental in helping me there. He said to my wife, ‘Look he’s got a body and his body’s going to tell him what he can do and what he can’t do’. And my wife took that on board and it was far easier and then from then on we made jokes about it.\n\nHA09, male MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nPrevious qualitative research has particularly highlighted a need for guidance for both partners on sexual activity.112–116 One man said that his wife had been more concerned than he was about restarting sexual relations after his heart attack, but openly talking about her worries had helped them to get past it.\n\nResuming your sex life after a heart attack, it’s quite difficult. It wasn’t so much difficult for me as for my wife actually. She was very concerned that I was going to throw another wobbler when . . . [. . .] What helped was talking. You have to, you have to always, you can tell when things are not quite right, ‘So what is the problem?’ ‘Oh I’m a bit concerned, I don’t want you to hurt yourself, I don’t want you to.’ ‘Okay I’m not going to hurt myself, I’m aware of what I’m doing. If I hurt, you’ll know.’\n\nHA18, male, MI in 1995 aged 47 years\n\nAlongside information about the safety of sexual intercourse, patients may also require emotional support if their body image and sexual confidence have been negatively affected by surgical scars.\n\nBecause of the scar on, I didn’t want anybody to look at me, even my legs, you know with the scar all up my leg. I didn’t want anybody, I’d wear trousers all the while. And I didn’t want anybody to see the scar down my chest. It sort of, it’s you know, it was horrible, it was. And I didn’t feel, and I just didn’t feel sexual at all. I just didn’t want to know anything like that.\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years.\n\nPeople also sometimes find positive ways of coping with the emotional impact of MI; for several study participants, the experience of MI had sometimes been a turning point from which to reassess their priorities and make positive changes. Several had become actively engaged in cardiac rehabilitation or peer support groups or embarked on new projects that gave them hope and enjoyment (see also Part 6: building a supportive environment: myocardial infarction patients’ ongoing support needs).\n\nHowever, some patients may need more intensive psychological support to help them come to terms with their heart attack and to find positive ways forward. The extended extracts below illustrate two cases of patients who experienced prolonged periods of severe depression after their MI before they found help.\n\nMyocardial infarction patients’ experiences of follow-up care\n\nPrevious qualitative research has suggested that post MI patients want more consistent follow-up care and ongoing support for help with making lifestyle changes; to meet people with similar experiences; to have regular access to health professionals with cardiac expertise; and to provide reassurance to partners and family members.129\n\nFollow-up care arrangements varied greatly for participants in the study. While some participants continued to see their hospital consultant at regular intervals for several months, for others their GP became their main point of contact for voicing any concerns about their symptoms or requesting changes to prescriptions. Many patients reported very positive relationships with their GPs.\n\nI have a brilliant GP. I’d vouch for him anytime. He’s caring, he listens, he talks, he checks. If there’s anything wrong he’d send you for an X-ray or anything like that, you know.\n\nHA06, male MI in 1996 aged 70 years\n\nEspecially in the early days after discharge from hospital, participants appreciated having access to a designated health professional with specialist cardiac expertise who they were able to contact with concerns or questions between appointments. This woman praised the dedication of her cardiac nurse who phoned her back to check on her well-being.\n\nThe rehabilitation Sister’s been my lifeline. I’ve been able to phone her, she’s been phoning me and she’s, to make sure I’m all right when I’ve come home, and things like that. [. . .] And when I had the funny heartbeat I’d phoned her the day before and she’d phoned my GP and I’d seen my GP but he said I was, I was all right. But 9 o’clock the next morning the rehabilitation phoned me and said, ‘how are you?’ and I said, ‘I’ve still got this funny heartbeat’ and she says, ‘come in now’. And she was there like when I got there at the hospital, she’s been a lifeline.\n\nHA03, female, MI in 1998 aged 53 years\n\nCardiac nurses were usually the health professionals who aided the transition from hospital to home.\n\nI lived by that [the heart manual] for six weeks when I was at home and again saw the doctor every couple of weeks and then I went in to see the cardiac nurse as well. I could ask her lots of questions; [my wife] and I, we both went in to see her, and came out with a few of the answers and a few don’t knows but you know it helps to be able to talk to somebody who has been in the same situation or been with, been with other patients and that was good.\n\nHA14, male, MI in 2003 aged 51 years\n\nHaving health professionals proactively checking up on discharged patients may help to reduce barriers towards help-seeking if patients experience symptoms that might suggest a repeat heart attack.\n\nThis man felt that having to wait for 3 months for his first specialist appointment after discharge was too long and this caused him and his wife some anxiety.\n\nI then had come home and I’d sort of got an appointment, this was in March and my appointment was for July to see a specialist, which I thought was rather a long time. It was more concern to my wife, I mean she was very worried [um], I couldn’t go out of her sight really. I had to go and buy myself a mobile phone which is something, I don’t want a mobile phone but I always had to carry this mobile phone. And if I was out of her sight more than a minute or two, she was worried about it and I thought well we, I ought to be doing something sooner about this. So we tried to contact the specialist, to say, ‘well it’s a long time July, after a heart attack, to worry about is it going to come back, am I going to get it again’. And I really hadn’t got a great deal of information to work on at this point.\n\nHA12, male, MI in 2003 aged 65 years\n\nIn some cases, communication between primary care and consultants at the hospital could be a source of uncertainty, as some participants said that they felt unsure about how much and what kind of information they could rely on to be exchanged between the two systems.\n\nThis man was concerned that his GP had decided to treat him with statins even though his cholesterol levels had not been checked in a primary care setting, so he was left wondering whether this was a ‘blanket’ treatment for MI patients or based on actual test results that had been communicated without his knowledge.\n\nThe one thing that does surprise me a little bit about the management of the condition I’ve got is the lack of blood tests. In terms of monitoring anything, because some of these problems can be explained by lack of magnesium or overactive whatever thyroid or again cholesterol level, I mean they’ve put me on a statin, but unless I’d been in hospital with a problem they’ve never checked my cholesterol level.\n\nWhat is it? Why am I still on the statin? That sort of thing. Now, through my GP I get it checked once a year, and I don’t know if they pass that onto the hospital. Every time, they’re interested in my cholesterol because they think I’ve, because of all of this I must have had a horrendous cholesterol level.\n\nHA05, male, MI in 2001 aged 37 years\n\nIn contrast, this man explained why he was very satisfied with the follow-up care he had received from his GP and the hospital consultant.\n\nFirst of all [my GP] seemed to be pretty adept at prescribing the right medication for me. Secondly, I generally only went when I or my wife, usually my wife, felt that something wasn’t quite right and I ought to see doctor X. And so an appointment would be made and doctor X would look at all the papers and look at all the, you know, did some tests and said ‘there’s nothing much wrong with you, you know, you’re alright, you’re doing pretty well’. Might make a few adjustments to the medication and you know that made me feel, you know, better. Also a good thing was that my GP, who’s just here in the village, and doctor X work very well together. There was no professional politics going on which sometimes happens. And my GP was perfectly content to accept doctor X’s prescriptions or his, his recommendations and so on. But now, for some time now, I’m no longer consulting doctor X, (a) he’s moved out of the area and (b) there’s no need.\n\nHA09, male, MI in 1995 aged 69 years\n\nAnother man said he had found it useful to write down the list of medications he had been prescribed so he could share this information with his GP without having to worry that he might forget something.\n\nI wrote down everything that had happened to me, typed it up, the tablets I was taking and when I took them and whatever because it was so much easier when you go and see a doctor and we all feel a bit confused with the whole thing, I can refer to it or pass it across to him.\n\nHA12, male, MI in 2003 aged 65 years"
