When the ablation pulse matches main pulse, the enhancement gets optimized because the electrons' energy density is highest. A scaling law between the ablation pulse and main pulse is confirmed by the simulation, showing that for given CPA pulse and target, proton energy improvement can be achieved several times by adjusting the target ablation.\n\nAblation enhancement of silicon by ultrashort double-pulse laser ablation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhao, Xin; Shin, Yung C.\n\nIn this study, the ultrashort double-pulse ablation of silicon is investigated. An atomistic simulation model is developed to analyze the underlying physics. It is revealed that the double-pulse ablation could significantly increase the ablation rate of silicon, compared with the single pulse ablation with the same total pulse energy, which is totally different from the case of metals. In the long pulse delay range (over 1âps), the enhancement is caused by the metallic transition of melted silicon with the corresponding absorption efficiency. At ultrashort pulse delay (below 1âps), the enhancement is due to the electron excitation by the first pulse.moreÂ Â» The enhancement only occurs at low and moderate laser fluence. The ablation is suppressed at high fluence due to the strong plasma shielding effect.Â«Â less\n\nContrast-enhanced harmonic ultrasound imaging in ablation therapy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinami, Yasunori; Kudo, Masatoshi\n\n2009-12-31\n\nThe success rate of percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on correct targeting via an imaging technique. However, RF electrode insertion is not completely accurate for residual HCC nodules because B-mode ultrasound (US), color Doppler, and power Doppler US findings cannot adequately differentiate between treated and viable residual tumor tissue. Electrode insertion is also difficult when we must identify the true HCC nodule among many large regenerated nodules in cirrhotic liver. Two breakthroughs in the field of US technology, harmonic imaging and the development of second-generation contrast agents, have recently been described and have demonstrated the potential to dramatically broaden the scope of US diagnosis of hepatic lesions. Contrast-enhanced harmonic US imaging with an intravenous contrast agent can evaluate small hypervascular HCC even when B-mode US cannot adequately characterize tumor. Therefore, contrast-enhanced harmonic US can facilitate RF ablation electrode placement in hypervascular HCC, which is poorly depicted by B-mode US. The use of contrast-enhanced harmonic US in ablation therapy for liver cancer is an efficient approach.\n\nComputed Tomography Assessment of Ablation Zone Enhancement in Patients With Early-Stage Lung Cancer After Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoore, William; Chaya, Yair; Chaudhry, Ammar; Depasquale, Britney; Glass, Samantha; Lee, Susan; Shin, James; Mikhail, George; Bhattacharji, Priya; Kim, Bong; Bilfinger, Thomas\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) offers a curative treatment for lung cancer in patients who are marginal surgical candidates. However, unlike traditional surgery the lung cancer remains in place after treatment. Thus, imaging follow-up for evaluation of recurrence is of paramount importance. In this retrospective designed Institutional Review Board-approved study, follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) exams were performed on sixty one patients to evaluate enhancement pattern in the ablation zone at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after SABR. Eleven patients had recurrence within the ablation zone after SABR. The postcontrast enhancement in the recurrence group showed a washin and washout phenomenon, whereas the radiation-induced lung injury group showed continuous enhancement suggesting an inflammatory process. The textural feature of the ablation zone of enhancement and perfusion as demonstrated in computed tomography nodule enhancement may allow early differentiation of recurrence from radiation-induced lung injury in patients' status after SABR or primary lung cancer.\n\nPhotoactive dye enhanced tissue ablation for endoscopic laser prostatectomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhn, Minwoo; Nguyen, Trung Hau; Nguyen, Van Phuc; Oh, Junghwan; Kang, Hyun Wook\n\n2015-02-01\n\nLaser light has been widely used as a surgical tool to treat benign prostate hyperplasia with high laser power. The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of photoactive dye injection to enhance light absorption and eventually to facilitate tissue ablation with low laser power. The experiment was implemented on chicken breast due to minimal optical absorption Amaranth (AR), black dye (BD), hemoglobin powder (HP), and endoscopic marker (EM), were selected and tested in vitro with a customized 532-nm laser system with radiant exposure ranging from 0.9 to 3.9 J/cm2. Light absorbance and ablation threshold were measured with UV-VIS spectrometer and Probit analysis, respectively, and compared to feature the function of the injected dyes. Ablation performance with dye-injection was evaluated in light of radiant exposure, dye concentration, and number of injection. Higher light absorption by injected dyes led to lower ablation threshold as well as more efficient tissue removal in the order of AR, BD, HP, and EM. Regardless of the injected dyes, ablation efficiency principally increased with input parameter. Among the dyes, AR created the highest ablation rate of 44.2+/-0.2 Î¼m/pulse due to higher absorbance and lower ablation threshold. Preliminary tests on canine prostate with a hydraulic injection system demonstrated that 80 W with dye injection yielded comparable ablation efficiency to 120 W with no injection, indicating 33 % reduced laser power with almost equivalent performance. In-depth comprehension on photoactive dye-enhanced tissue ablation can help accomplish efficient and safe laser treatment for BPH with low power application.\n\nSix-month follow-up of isthmus-dependent right atrial flutter ablation using a remote magnetic catheter navigation system: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuo, Yan; Hindricks, Gerhard; Piorkowski, Christopher; Bollmann, Andreas; Wetzel, Ulrike; Sommer, Phillip; Gaspar, Thomas; Kottkamp, Hans; Arya, Arash\n\n2010-06-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to compare results between the magnetic navigation system (MNS) and conventional catheter ablation of cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent right atrial flutter (AFL) in a case control study. A remote MNS has been used for ablation of various arrhythmias including CTI-dependent AFL but comparative results between MNS and conventional ablation are not available. Between May and September 2007, a total of 51 consecutive patients (45 men, mean age 65.4 +/- 9.4 years) had undergone catheter ablation for CTI-dependent AFL. The catheter ablation (70 degrees C, 70 W, 90 s) was performed with either an 8-mm-tip magnetic catheter using MNS (case group, n = 26, 23 men, mean age 64.6 +/- 9.6 y) or a conventional 8-mm catheter (case group, n = 25, 22 men, mean age 65.4 +/- 9.1 y). Acute procedural success was defined as complete bidirectional isthmus block and success at six months was defined as absence of AFL during the six months follow-up. With respect to baseline characteristics there were no differences between the two groups. The procedure time in MNS and conventional group was [median (range)] 53 (30-130) min and 45 (30-100) min, respectively (P = 0.12). Acute success was achieved by MNS and conventional ablation in 25/26 (96.2%) and 25/25 (100%) of patients, respectively (P = 0.53). During the six months of follow-up 4 patients, 2 in each group, experienced recurrence (P = 0.90). No major complication occurred during the procedure. Charring on the catheter tip occurred in 5 patients (19.2%) in MNS and none of the patients in the control group (P <0.05). This case-control study demonstrated the acute and mid-term efficacy and safety of catheter ablation by MNS for CTI-dependent AFL, similar to rates achieved by conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation.\n\nUltrasound ablation enhances drug accumulation and survival in mammary carcinoma models.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Andrew W; Fite, Brett Z; Liu, Yu; Kheirolomoom, Azadeh; Seo, Jai W; Watson, Katherine D; Mahakian, Lisa M; Tam, Sarah M; Zhang, Hua; Foiret, Josquin; Borowsky, Alexander D; Ferrara, Katherine W\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) facilitates noninvasive image-guided conformal thermal therapy of cancer. Yet in many scenarios, the sensitive tissues surrounding the tumor constrain the margins of ablation; therefore, augmentation of MRgFUS with chemotherapy may be required to destroy remaining tumor. Here, we used 64Cu-PET-CT, MRI, autoradiography, and fluorescence imaging to track the kinetics of long-circulating liposomes in immunocompetent mammary carcinoma-bearing FVB/n and BALB/c mice. We observed a 5-fold and 50-fold enhancement of liposome and drug concentration, respectively, within MRgFUS thermal ablation-treated tumors along with dense accumulation within the surrounding tissue rim. Ultrasound-enhanced drug accumulation was rapid and durable and greatly increased total tumor drug exposure over time. In addition, we found that the small molecule gadoteridol accumulates around and within ablated tissue. We further demonstrated that dilated vasculature, loss of vascular integrity resulting in extravasation of blood cells, stromal inflammation, and loss of cell-cell adhesion and tissue architecture all contribute to the enhanced accumulation of the liposomes and small molecule probe. The locally enhanced liposome accumulation was preserved even after a multiweek protocol of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes and partial ablation. Finally, by supplementing ablation with concurrent liposomal drug therapy, a complete and durable response was obtained using protocols for which a sub-mm rim of tumor remained after ablation.\n\nLikelihood of Incomplete Kidney Tumor Ablation with Radio Frequency Energy: Degree of Enhancement Matters.\n\nPubMed\n\nLay, Aaron H; Stewart, Jeremy; Canvasser, Noah E; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Gahan, Jeffrey C\n\n2016-07-01\n\nLarger size and clear cell histopathology are associated with worse outcomes for malignant renal tumors treated with radio frequency ablation. We hypothesize that greater tumor enhancement may be a risk factor for radio frequency ablation failure due to increased vascularity. A retrospective review of patients who underwent radio frequency ablation for renal tumors with contrast enhanced imaging available was performed. The change in Hounsfield units (HU) of the tumor from the noncontrast phase to the contrast enhanced arterial phase was calculated. Radio frequency ablation failure rates for biopsy confirmed malignant tumors were compared using the chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to assess predictive variables for radio frequency ablation failure. Disease-free survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A total of 99 patients with biopsy confirmed malignant renal tumors and contrast enhanced imaging were identified. The incomplete ablation rate was significantly lower for tumors with enhancement less than 60 vs 60 HU or greater (0.0% vs 14.6%, p=0.005). On multivariate logistic regression analysis tumor enhancement 60 HU or greater (OR 1.14, p=0.008) remained a significant predictor of incomplete initial ablation. The 5-year disease-free survival for size less than 3 cm was 100% vs 69.2% for size 3 cm or greater (p <0.01), while 5-year disease-free survival for HU change less than 60 was 100% vs 92.4% for HU change 60 or greater (p=0.24). Biopsy confirmed malignant renal tumors, which exhibit a change in enhancement of 60 HU or greater, experience a higher rate of incomplete initial tumor ablation than tumors with enhancement less than 60 HU. Size 3 cm or greater portends worse 5-year disease-free survival after radio frequency ablation. The degree of enhancement should be considered when counseling patients before radio frequency ablation.

A.; Holmes, Andrew S.\n\n2006-02-01\n\nMeasurements of ablation rate have traditionally been carried out only at normal incidence. However, in real-world applications ablation is often carried out at oblique angles, and it is useful to have prior knowledge of the ablation rate in this case. Detailed information about the angular dependence is also important for the development of ablation simulation tools, and can provide additional insight into the ablation mechanism. Previously we have reported on the angular dependence of direct-write ablation at 266 nm wavelength in solgel and polymer materials. In this paper we present a systematic study of angular dependence for excimer laser ablation of two polymer materials of interest for microfabrication: polycarbonate and SU8 photoresist. The results are used to improve simulation models to aid in mask design.\n\nUltrasound ablation enhances drug accumulation and survival in mammary carcinoma models\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWong, Andrew W.; Fite, Brett Z.; Liu, Yu; Kheirolomoom, Azadeh; Seo, Jai W.; Watson, Katherine D.; Mahakian, Lisa M.; Tam, Sarah M.; Zhang, Hua; Foiret, Josquin; Borowsky, Alexander D.; Ferrara, Katherine W.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonanceâguided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) facilitates noninvasive image-guided conformal thermal therapy of cancer.

In six sheep-livers, 18 microwave ablations were performed with identical system presets (power output: 80 W, ablation time: 120 s). In three sheep, transarterial embolisation (TAE) was performed immediately before microwave ablation using spheres (diameter: 40 Â± 10 Î¼m) (sMWA). In the other three sheep, microwave ablation was performed without spheres embolisation (bMWA). Contrast-enhanced CT, sacrifice, and liver harvest followed immediately after microwave ablation. Study goals included technical parameters during ablation (resulting power output, ablation time), geometry of the ablation zone applying specific CT 3D rendering with a software prototype (short axis of the ablation zone, volume of the largest aligned ablation sphere within the ablation zone), and histopathology (hematoxylin-eosin, Masson Goldner and TUNEL). Resulting power output/ablation times were 78.7 Â± 1.0 W/120 Â± 0.0 s for bMWA and 78.4 Â± 1.0 W/120 Â± 0.0 s for sMWA (n.s., respectively). Short axis/volume were 23.7 Â± 3.7 mm/7.0 Â± 2.4 cm(3) for bMWA and 29.1 Â± 3.4 mm/11.5 Â± 3.9 cm(3) for sMWA (P < 0.01, respectively). Histopathology confirmed the signs of coagulation necrosis as well as early and irreversible cell death for bMWA and sMWA. For sMWA, spheres were detected within, at the rim, and outside of the ablation zone without conspicuous features. Specific CT 3D rendering identifies a larger ablation zone for sMWA compared with bMWA. The histopathological signs and the detectable amount of cell death are comparable for both groups. When comparing sMWA with bMWA, TAE has no effect on the technical parameters during ablation.\n\nPhotoactive dye-enhanced tissue ablation for endoscopic laser prostatectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Minwoo; Hau, Nguyen Trung; Van Phuc, Nguyen; Oh, Junghwan; Kang, Hyun Wook\n\n2014-11-01\n\nLaser light has been widely used as a surgical tool to treat benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) over 20 years. Recently, application of high laser power up to 200âW was often reported to swiftly remove a large amount of prostatic tissue. The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of photoactive dye injection to enhance light absorption and eventually to facilitate tissue vaporization with low laser power.

Monitoring potential influence on online MR thermometry during the ablation procedure is a secondary aim. Materials and Methods 30 cases of MR-guided laser ablation were performed after i.v. bolus injection of gadoxetic acid (0.025 mmol/Kg Gd-EOB-DTPA; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). T1-weighted GRE sequences were used for applicator guidance (FLASH 3D) in the catheter placement phase and for therapy monitoring (FLASH 2D) in the therapy phase. SNR and consecutive CNR values were measured for elements of interest plotted over time both for catheter placement and therapy phase and compared with a non-contrast control group of 19 earlier cases. Statistical analysis was realized using the paired Wilcoxon test. Results Sustainable signal elevation of liver parenchyma in the contrast-enhanced group was sufficient to silhouette both target tumor and applicator against the liver.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for these declines remain unclear. Here, we show that levels of NAD+ and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, decrease with age in the hippocampus. Ablation of Nampt in adult NSPCs reduced their pool and proliferation in vivo. The decrease in the NSPC pool during aging can be rescued by enhancing hippocampal NAD+ levels. Nampt is the main source of NSPC NAD+ levels and required for G1/S progression of the NSPC cell cycle. Nampt is also critical in oligodendrocytic lineage fate decisions through a mechanism mediated redundantly by Sirt1 and Sirt2. Ablation of Nampt in the adult NSPCs in vivo reduced NSPC-mediated oligodendrogenesis upon insult. These phenotypes recapitulate defects in NSPCs during aging, giving rise to the possibility that Nampt-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is a mediator of age-associated functional declines in NSPCs.

Q.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nProton acceleration during the interaction of an ultraintense (6 Ã 1019 W/cm2) femtosecond (fs) laser pulse with a thin (2.5 Î¼m) foil target pre-ablated by a picosecond (ps) pulse is experimentally and numerically investigated. Enhancements in both proton cut-off energy and charge are observed with the target ablation due to a large number of energetic electrons generated from the preformed preplasma in front of the target. The enhanced proton beams are successfully collected at 4-9 MeV with Â±4% energy spread and then transported to the irradiating platform. The results show that for the interaction between fs laser pulse and Î¼m-thickness target, proton energy and charge can be enhanced by target ablation using a ps laser pulse, which is valuable for application like cancer radiotherapy.\n\nLocal ablation therapy with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for hepatocellular carcinoma: a practical review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Tae Kyoung; Khalili, Korosh; Jang, Hyun-Jung\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA successful program for local ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires extensive imaging support for diagnosis and localization of HCC, imaging guidance for the ablation procedures, and post-treatment monitoring. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) has several advantages over computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), including real-time imaging capability, sensitive detection of arterial-phase hypervascularity and washout, no renal excretion, no ionizing radiation, repeatability, excellent patient compliance, and relatively low cost. CEUS is useful for image guidance for isoechoic lesions. While contrast-enhanced CT/MRI is the standard method for the diagnosis of HCC and post-ablation monitoring, CEUS is useful when CT/MRI findings are indeterminate or CT/MRI is contraindicated.

Although it is documented that metal-based magnetothermal conversion and microbubbles-based inertial cavitation have been tried to overcome above issues, disputed toxicity and poor magnetothermal conversion efficiency for metal-based nanoparticles and violent but transient cavitation for microbubbles are inappropriate for enhancing RF ablation. In this report, a strategy, i.e., continuous cavitation, has been proposed, and solid menthol-encapsulated poly lactide-glycolide acid (PLGA) nanocapsules have been constructed, as a proof of concept, to validate the role of such a continuous cavitation principle in continuously enhancing RF ablation. The synthesized PLGA-based nanocapsules can respond to RF to generate menthol bubbles via distinctive radiofrequency solidoid vaporization (RSV) process, meanwhile significantly enhance ultrasound imaging for HeLa solid tumor, and further facilitate RF ablation via the continuous cavitation, as systematically demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this RSV strategy can overcome drawbacks and limitations of acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) and optical droplet vaporization (ODV), and will probably find broad applications in further cancer theranostics.\n\nIrreversible electroporation ablation area enhanced by synergistic high- and low-voltage pulses.\n\nPubMed\n\nYao, Chenguo; Lv, Yanpeng; Dong, Shoulong; Zhao, Yajun; Liu, Hongmei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIrreversible electroporation (IRE) produced by a pulsed electric field can ablate tissue. In this study, we achieved an enhancement in ablation area by using a combination of short high-voltage pulses (HVPs) to create a large electroporated area and long low-voltage pulses (LVPs) to ablate the electroporated area. The experiments were conducted in potato tuber slices. Slices were ablated with an array of four pairs of parallel steel electrodes using one of the following four electric pulse protocols: HVP, LVP, synergistic HVP+LVP (SHLVP) or LVP+HVP. Our results showed that the SHLVPs more effectively necrotized tissue than either the HVPs or LVPs, even when the SHLVP dose was the same as or lower than the HVP or LVP doses. The HVP and LVP order mattered and only HVPs+LVPs (SHLVPs) treatments increased the size of the ablation zone because the HVPs created a large electroporated area that was more susceptible to the subsequent LVPs. Real-time temperature change monitoring confirmed that the tissue was non-thermally ablated by the electric pulses. Theoretical calculations of the synergistic effects of the SHLVPs on tissue ablation were performed. Our proposed SHLVP protocol provides options for tissue ablation and may be applied to optimize the current clinical IRE protocols.\n\nIrreversible electroporation ablation area enhanced by synergistic high- and low-voltage pulses\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIrreversible electroporation (IRE) produced by a pulsed electric field can ablate tissue.

A minimally invasive RFA setup has been prepared and applied ex vivo on a liver phantom; NPs (with concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/mL) have been synthesized and injected within the tissue prior to ablation, in order to facilitate the heat distribution to the peripheral sides of the treated tissue. A network of 15 FBG sensors has been deployed in situ in order to detect the parenchymal temperature distribution and estimate the thermal profiles in real time during the ablation, highlighting the impact of the NPs on the RFA mechanism. The results confirm that NP-enhanced ablation with 5 mg/mL density shows a better heat penetration that a standard RFA achieving an almost double-sized lesion, while a higher density (10 mg/mL) does not improve the heat distribution. Thermal data are reported highlighting both spatial and temporal gradients, evaluating the capability of NPs to deliver sufficient heating to the peripheral sides of the tumor borders.\n\nImproved model for the angular dependence of excimer laser ablation rates in polymer materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPedder, J. E. A.; Holmes, A. S.; Dyer, P. E.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMeasurements of the angle-dependent ablation rates of polymers that have applications in microdevice fabrication are reported. A simple model based on Beer's law, including plume absorption, is shown to give good agreement with the experimental findings for polycarbonate and SU8, ablated using the 193 and 248 nm excimer lasers, respectively. The modeling forms a useful tool for designing masks needed to fabricate complex surface relief by ablation.\n\nHeat Stress-Induced PI3K/mTORC2-Dependent AKT Signaling Is a Central Mediator of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Survival to Thermal Ablation Induced Heat Stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThompson, Scott M.; Callstrom, Matthew R.; Jondal, Danielle E.; Butters, Kim A.; Knudsen, Bruce E.; Anderson, Jill L.; Lien, Karen R.; Sutor, Shari L.; Lee, Ju-Seog; Thorgeirsson, Snorri S.; Grande, Joseph P.; Roberts, Lewis R.; Woodrum, David A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThermal ablative therapies are important treatment options in the multidisciplinary care of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but lesions larger than 2â3 cm are plagued with high local recurrence rates and overall survival of these patients remains poor. Currently no adjuvant therapies exist to prevent local HCC recurrence in patients undergoing thermal ablation. The molecular mechanisms mediating HCC resistance to thermal ablation induced heat stress and local recurrence remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the HCC cells with a poor prognostic hepatic stem cell subtype (Subtype HS) are more resistant to heat stress than HCC cells with a better prognostic hepatocyte subtype (Subtype HC). Moreover, sublethal heat stress rapidly induces phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dependent-protein kinase B (AKT) survival signaling in HCC cells in vitro and at the tumor ablation margin in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent AKT phosphorylation or direct inhibition of AKT function both enhance HCC cell killing and decrease HCC cell survival to sublethal heat stress in both poor and better prognostic HCC subtypes while mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-inhibition has no impact. Finally, we showed that AKT isoforms 1, 2 and 3 are differentially upregulated in primary human HCCs and that overexpression of AKT correlates with worse tumor biology and pathologic features (AKT3) and prognosis (AKT1). Together these findings define a novel molecular mechanism whereby heat stress induces PI3K/mTORC2-dependent AKT survival signaling in HCC cells and provide a mechanistic rationale for adjuvant AKT inhibition in combination with thermal ablation as a strategy to enhance HCC cell killing and prevent local recurrence, particularly at the ablation margin.

In the far-field regime, the electromagnetic field results from a focused laser beam, while the near-field regime is realized by a combination of the focused laser beam incident on a spherical colloidal particle. For the near-field experiments we have used polystyrene colloidal particles of 700 nm diameter self-assembled or spin coated on top of the surfaces. Laser fluences applied are in the range of 0.01-10 J/cm2. The diameter and the morphologies of the ablated holes were investigated by optical microscopy, profilometry, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The dependence of the shape of the holes reflects the fluence regime and the thermophysical properties, i.e., melting temperature and thermal diffusivity of the surfaces involved in the experiments. We give quantitative data about the fluence threshold, diameter, and depth ablation dependence for the far and near fields and discuss their values with respect to the enhancement factor of the intensity of the electromagnetic field due to the use of the colloidal particles. Theoretical estimations of the intensity enhancement were done using the finite-difference time-domain method by using the RSOFT software. The application of near fields allows structuring of the surfaces with structure dimension in the order of 100 nm and even below.\n\nMicrojet-assisted dye-enhanced diode laser ablation of cartilaginous tissue\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPohl, John; Bell, Brent A.; Motamedi, Massoud; Frederickson, Chris J.; Wallace, David B.; Hayes, Donald J.; Cowan, Daniel\n\n1994-08-01\n\nRecent studies have established clinical application of laser ablation of cartilaginous tissue. The goal of this study was to investigate removal of cartilaginous tissue using diode laser. To enhance the interaction of laser light with tissue, improve the ablation efficiency and localize the extent of laser-induced thermal damage in surrounding tissue, we studied the use of a novel delivery system developed by MicroFab Technologies to dispense a known amount of Indocyanine Green (ICG) with a high spatial resolution to alter the optical properties of the tissue in a controlled fashion. Canine intervertebral disks were harvested and used within eight hours after collection. One hundred forty nL of ICG was topically applied to both annulus and nucleus at the desired location with the MicroJet prior to each irradiation. Fiber catheters (600 micrometers ) were used and positioned to irradiate the tissue with a 0.8 mm spot size. Laser powers of 3 - 10 W (Diomed, 810 nm) were used to irradiate the tissue with ten pulses (200 - 500 msec). Discs not stained with ICG were irradiated as control samples. Efficient tissue ablation (80 - 300 micrometers /pulse) was observed using ICG to enhance light absorption and confine thermal damage while there was no observable ablation in control studied. The extent of tissue damage observed microscopically was limited to 50 - 100 micrometers . The diode laser/Microjet combination showed promise for applications involving removal of cartilaginous tissue. This procedure can be performed using a low power compact diode laser, is efficient, and potentially more economical compared to procedures using conventional lasers.\n\nDifferentiation of pre-ablation and post-ablation late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI scans of longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation patients\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Guang; Zhuang, Xiahai; Khan, Habib; Haldar, Shouvik; Nyktari, Eva; Li, Lei; Ye, Xujiong; Slabaugh, Greg; Wong, Tom; Mohiaddin, Raad; Keegan, Jennifer; Firmin, David\n\n2017-03-01\n\nLate Gadolinium-Enhanced Cardiac MRI (LGE CMRI) is an emerging non-invasive technique to image and quantify preablation native and post-ablation atrial scarring. Previous studies have reported that enhanced image intensities of the atrial scarring in the LGE CMRI inversely correlate with the left atrial endocardial voltage invasively obtained by electro-anatomical mapping. However, the reported reproducibility of using LGE CMRI to identify and quantify atrial scarring is variable. This may be due to two reasons: first, delineation of the left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) anatomy generally relies on manual operation that is highly subjective, and this could substantially affect the subsequent atrial scarring segmentation; second, simple intensity based image features may not be good enough to detect subtle changes in atrial scarring. In this study, we hypothesized that texture analysis can provide reliable image features for the LGE CMRI images subject to accurate and objective delineation of the heart anatomy based on a fully-automated whole heart segmentation (WHS) method. We tested the extracted texture features to differentiate between pre-ablation and post-ablation LGE CMRI studies in longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation patients. These patients often have extensive native scarring and differentiation from post-ablation scarring can be difficult. Quantification results showed that our method is capable of solving this classification task, and we can envisage further deployment of this texture analysis based method for other clinical problems using LGE CMRI.\n\nCarbon Nanotube-Enhanced Carbon-Phenenolic Ablator Material\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKikolaev, P.; Stackpoole, M.; Fan, W.; Cruden, B.

Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The livers of 28 rats underwent US-guided RF ablation. In four animals, contrast-enhanced US was performed during ablation and 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation. The unenhanced zone area on US images was measured. DiI-labeled microbubbles were administered during ablation at 2, 4, and 6 minutes or at 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation in the remaining 24 animals (n = 3 at each time point). One minute later, the animal was euthanized, and the ablated liver was harvested. Tissue samples were imaged to quantify total fluorescence, and NADH staining was performed on the same slice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was also performed. The findings on fluorescence images, NADH-stained images, and hematoxylin-eosin-stained images were compared. The areas of DiI bubble-negative zones, NADH-negative zones, and lightly NADH-staining zones were measured. Data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance. The area of the unenhanced zone on contrast-enhanced US images increased during RF ablation and reached a maximum within 2 days after ablation. At histopathologic examination, a transition zone manifested adjacent to the coagulation zone until 2 days after ablation. The DiI-bubble negative zone on fluorescence images and the damaged zone (transition zone plus coagulation zone) on NADH-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation, then slowly reached the maximum on day 2. The ratios of the mean areas of these two zones at hour 2 to those at day 2 were 94.6% and 95.6%, respectively. High uniformity between the damaged zone on NADH-stained images and the DiI bubble-negative zone on fluorescence images was noted at all time\n\nPreservation of the endometrial enhancement after magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of submucosal uterine fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Young-Sun; Kim, Tae-Joong; Lim, Hyo Keun; Rhim, Hyunchul; Jung, Sin-Ho; Ahn, Joong Hyun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo evaluate the integrity of endometrial enhancement after magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation of submucosal uterine fibroids based on contrast-enhanced MRI findings, and to identify the risk factors for endometrial impairment. In total, 117 submucosal fibroids (diameter: 5.9âÂ±â3.0Â cm) in 101 women (age: 43.6âÂ±â4.4Â years) treated with MR-HIFU ablation were retrospectively analysed. Endometrial integrity was assessed with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images at immediate (nâ=â101), 3-month (nâ=â62) and 12-month (nâ=â15) follow-ups. Endometrial impairment was classified into grades 0 (continuous endometrium), 1 (pin-point, full-thickness discontinuity), 2 (between grade 1 and 3), or 3 (full-thickness discontinuity >1Â cm). Risk factors were assessed with generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis. Among 117 fibroids, grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 endometrial impairments were observed at initial examination in 56.4%, 24.8%, 13.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Among 37 fibroid cases of endometrial impairment for which follow-ups were conducted, 30 showed improvements at 3- and/or 12-month follow-up. GEE analysis revealed the degree of endometrial protrusion was significantly associated with severity of endometrial injury (Pâ<â0.0001). After MR-HIFU ablation of submucosal fibroids, endometrial enhancement was preserved intact or minimally impaired in most cases. Impaired endometrium, which is more common after treating endometrially-protruded fibroids, may recover spontaneously. â¢ After MR-HIFU ablation for submucosal fibroid, endometrium is mostly preserved/minimally impaired. â¢ Endometrial-protruded submucosal fibroid is susceptible to more severe endometrial impairment. â¢ The impaired endometrium may recover spontaneously at follow-up MR exams.\n\nPercutaneous Microwave Ablation of Renal Angiomyolipomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nCristescu, Mircea; Abel, E Jason; Wells, Shane; Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Hedican, Sean P; Lubner, Megan G; Hinshaw, J Louis; Brace, Christopher L; Lee, Fred T\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of US-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation in the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma (AML). From January 2011 to April 2014, seven patients (5 females and 2 males; mean age 51.4) with 11 renal AMLs (9 sporadic type and 2 tuberous sclerosis associated) with a mean size of 3.4 Â± 0.7 cm (range 2.4-4.9 cm) were treated with high-powered, gas-cooled percutaneous MW ablation under US guidance. Tumoral diameter, volume, and CT/MR enhancement were measured on pre-treatment, immediate post-ablation, and delayed post-ablation imaging. Clinical symptoms and creatinine were assessed on follow-up visits. All ablations were technically successful and no major complications were encountered. Mean ablation parameters were ablation power of 65 W (range 60-70 W), using 456 mL of hydrodissection fluid per patient, over 4.7 min (range 3-8 min). Immediate post-ablation imaging demonstrated mean tumor diameter and volume decreases of 1.8% (3.4-3.3 cm) and 1.7% (27.5-26.3 cm(3)), respectively. Delayed imaging follow-up obtained at a mean interval of 23.1 months (median 17.6; range 9-47) demonstrated mean tumor diameter and volume decreases of 29% (3.4-2.4 cm) and 47% (27.5-12.1 cm(3)), respectively. Tumoral enhancement decreased on immediate post-procedure and delayed imaging by CT/MR parameters, indicating decreased tumor vascularity. No patients required additional intervention and no patients experienced spontaneous bleeding post-ablation. Our early experience with high-powered, gas-cooled percutaneous MW ablation demonstrates it to be a safe and effective modality to devascularize and decrease the size of renal AMLs.\n\nPolycrystalline Si nanoparticles and their strong aging enhancement of blue photoluminescence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Shikuan; Cai, Weiping; Zeng, Haibo; Li, Zhigang\n\n2008-07-01\n\nNearly spherical polycrystalline Si nanoparticles with 20 nm diameter were fabricated based on laser ablation of silicon wafer immersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous solution. Such Si nanoparticles consist of disordered areas and ultrafine grains of 3 nm in mean size and exhibit significant photoluminescence in blue region. Importantly, aging at ambient air leads to continuing enhancement of the emission (more than 130 times higher in 16 weeks) showing stable and strong blue emission. This aging enhancement is attributed to progressive passivation of nonradiative Pb centers corresponding to silicon dangling bonds on the particles' surface. This study could be helpful in pushing Si into optoelectronic field and Si-based full color display, biomedical tagging, and flash memories.\n\nReal-time Monitoring of Radiofrequency Ablation and Postablation Assessment: Accuracy of Contrast-enhanced US in Experimental Rat Liver Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWu, Hanping; Wilkins, Luke R.; Ziats, Nicholas P.; Haaga, John R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose To examine the accuracy of the unenhanced zone at contrast materialâenhanced ultrasonography (US) in predicting coagulative necrosis during and 21 days after radiofrequency (RF) ablation by using radiologic-pathologic comparison.

In this retrospective evaluation of 1,963 SMILE procedures, 43 eyes (2.2%) were re-treated at three separate clinics. Of these, 40 eyes of 28 patients with a follow-up of at least 3 months were included in the analysis. During surface ablation, mitomycin C was applied for haze prevention. Spherical equivalent was -6.35 Â± 1.31 diopters (D) before SMILE and -0.86 Â± 0.43 D before surface ablation. Surface ablation was performed after a mean of 9.82 Â± 5.27 months and resulted in a spherical equivalent of 0.03 Â± 0.57 D at 3 months (P < .0001). The number of patients within Â±0.50 and Â±1.00 D of target refraction increased from 22.5% to 80% and from 72.5% to 92.5%, respectively. Mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) improved from 0.23 Â± 0.20 to 0.08 Â± 0.15 logMAR (P < .0001); 65% of patients gained at least one line. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) remained unchanged with 0.01 Â± 0.07 logMAR before versus -0.01 Â± 0.05 logMAR after re-treatment (P = .99). Six eyes (15.0%) lost one line of CDVA, but final CDVA was 0.00 logMAR in four and 0.10 logMAR in two of these cases. The safety and efficacy indices were 1.06 and 0.90 at 3 months, respectively. Three of the four surface ablation profiles (Triple-A, tissue-saving algorithm, and topography-guided) resulted in equally good results, whereas enhancement with the aspherically optimized profile (ASA), used in two eyes, resulted in overcorrection (+1.38 and +1.75 D). Combined with the intraoperative application of mitomycin C, surface ablation seems to be a safe and effective method of secondary enhancement after SMILE. Due to the usually low residual myopia, the ASA profile is not recommended in these cases. [J Refract Surg. 2017;33(8):513-518.].

Therefore, ablation of cardiac tissue treated with metallic nanoparticles may improve local radiofrequency heating and lead to larger ablation lesions. We sought to evaluate the effect of magnetic nanoparticles on tissue sensitivity to radiofrequency energy. Ablation was performed using an ablation catheter positioned with 10 g of force over prepared ex vivo specimens. Tissue temperatures were measured and lesion volumes were acquired. An in vivo porcine thigh model was used to study systemically delivered magnetically guided iron oxide (FeO) nanoparticles during radiofrequency application. Magnetic resonance imaging and histological staining of ablated tissue were subsequently performed as a part of ablation lesion analysis. Ablation of ex vivo myocardial tissue treated with metallic nanoparticles resulted in significantly larger lesions with greater impedance changes and evidence of increased thermal conductivity within the tissue. Magnet-guided localization of FeO nanoparticles within porcine thigh preps was demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging and iron staining. Irrigated ablation in the regions with greater FeO, after FeO infusion and magnetic guidance, created larger lesions without a greater incidence of steam pops. Metal nanoparticle infiltration resulted in significantly larger ablation lesions with altered electric and thermal conductivity. In vivo magnetic guidance of FeO nanoparticles allowed for facilitated radiofrequency ablation without direct infiltration into the targeted tissue. Further research is needed to assess the clinical applicability of this ablation strategy using metallic nanoparticles for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

Baseline creatinine levels varied from 2.0 mg/dL to 3.7 mg/dL. All patients had received red blood cell transfusions in the days and hours before RF ablation. No subsequent surgical or interventional procedures were required for management of hematuria. Gross hematuria resolved in 24-48 hours in all four patients. Two of the patients are alive with stable renal function and two died of causes unrelated to treatment. RF ablation may be an effective therapeutic option for transfusion-dependent cancer-related hematuria in patients with renal insufficiency, solitary kidney, or comorbidities, or after failed conventional therapies in patients who are not candidates for surgery.

The present study evaluates the feasibility and efficiency of this system and the newly available 8-mm-tip magnetic catheter to perform RF ablation in patients with AFL. Twenty-six consecutive patients (23 men, mean age 64.6 +/- 9.6 years) underwent RF ablation using a remote MNS. RF ablation was performed with an 8-mm-tip magnetic catheter (70 degrees C, maximum power 70 W, 90 seconds). The endpoint of ablation was complete bidirectional isthmus block. To assess a possible learning curve, procedural data were compared between the first 14 (group 1) and the rest (group 2) of the patients. The initial rhythm during ablation was AFL in 20 (19 counterclockwise and 1 clockwise) and sinus rhythm in six patients. Due to technical issues, the ablation in the 18th patient could not be done with the MNS, and so we switched to conventional ablation. The remote magnetic navigation and ablation procedure was successful in 24 of the 25 (96%) remaining patients with AFL. In one patient (patient 2), conventional catheter was used to complete the isthmus block after termination of AFL. The procedure, preparation, ablation, and fluoroscopy times (median [range]) were 53 (30-130) minutes, 28 (10-65) minutes, 25 (12-78) minutes, and 7.5 (3.2-20.8) minutes, respectively. Patients in group 2 had shorter procedure (45 [30-70] min vs 80 [57-130] min, P = 0.0001), preparation (25 [10-30] min vs 42 [30-65] min, P = 0.0001), ablation (20 [12-40] min vs 31 [20-78] min, P = 0.002), and fluoroscopy (7.2 [3.2-12.2] min vs 11.0 [5.4-20.8] min, P = 0.014) times. No complication occurred during the procedure. Using a remote MNS and an 8-mm-tip magnetic catheter, ablation of AFL is feasible\n\nAdditive Effects of Mechanical Marrow Ablation and PTH Treatment on de Novo Bone Formation in Mature Adult Rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Qing; Miller, Christopher; Bible, Jesse; Li, Jiliang; Xu, Xiaoqing; Mehta, Nozer; Gilligan, James; Vignery, AgnÃ¨s; Scholz, Jodi A Carlson\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMechanical ablation of bone marrow in young rats induces rapid but transient bone growth, which can be enhanced and maintained for three weeks by the administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Additionally, marrow ablation, followed by PTH treatment for three months leads to increased cortical thickness. In this study, we sought to determine whether PTH enhances bone formation after marrow ablation in aged rats. Aged rats underwent unilateral femoral marrow ablation and treatment with PTH or vehicle for four weeks. Both femurs from each rat were analyzed by X-ray and pQCT, then analyzed either by microCT, histology or biomechanical testing. Marrow ablation alone induced transient bone formation of low abundance that persisted over four weeks, while marrow ablation followed by PTH induced bone formation of high abundance that also persisted over four weeks. Our data confirms that the osteo-inducive effect of marrow ablation and the additive effect of marrow ablation, followed by PTH, occurs in aged rats. Our observations open new avenues of investigations in the field of tissue regeneration. Local marrow ablation, in conjunction with an anabolic agent, might provide a new platform for rapid site-directed bone growth in areas of high bone loss, such as in the hip and wrist, which are subject to fracture.

Ablation threshold dependence on pulse duration is predicted with the model and the numerical results for water agrees well with the experimental data for pulse duration from 140 fs to 10 ps. Influences of parameters and approximations of photo- and avalanche-ionization on the ablation threshold prediction are analyzed in detail for various pulse lengths. The calculated ablation threshold is strongly dependent on electron collision time for all the pulse durations. The complete photoionization model is preferred for pulses shorter than 1 ps rather than the multiphoton ionization approximations. The transition time of inverse bremsstrahlung absorption needs to be considered when pulses are shorter than 5 ps and it can also ensure the avalanche ionization (AI) coefficient consistent with that in multiple rate equations (MREs) for pulses shorter than 300 fs. The threshold electron density for AI is only crucial for longer pulses. It is reasonable to ignore the recombination loss for pulses shorter than 100 fs. In addition to thermal transport and hydrodynamics, neglecting the threshold density for AI and recombination could also contribute to the disagreements between the numerical and the experimental results for longer pulses.\n\nFemtosecond laser-induced size reduction and emission quantum yield enhancement of colloidal silicon nanocrystals: Effect of laser ablation time.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yingxiong; Wu, Wenshun; Hao, Huilian; Shen, Wenzhong\n\n2018-06-19\n\nColloidal silicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) with different sizes were successfully prepared by femtosecond laser ablation under different laser ablation time (LAT). The mean size decreases from 4.23 to 1.42 nm with increasing LAT from 30 to 120 min. In combination with structural characterization, temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL, and PL excitation spectra, we attribute room temperature blue emissions peaked at 405 and 430 nm to the radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs via the oxygen deficient centers related to Si-C-H2 and Si-O-Si bonds of colloidal Si NCs prepared in 1-octene, respectively. In particular, the measured PL quantum yield of colloidal Si NCs has been enhanced significantly from 23.6% to 55.8% with prolonging LAT from 30 to 120 min.

MPH is also popular among healthy individuals, including the elderly, for its ability to focus attention and improve concentration, but these effects have not been shown to be comparable between aged and adult subjects. Thus, we tested whether MPH would improve performance in sustained attention in both adult and aged rats. In addition, we tested the impact of visual distraction on performance in this task and the ability of MPH to mitigate the effects of distraction. Adult (6â12 months) and aged (18â22 months) male Sprague-Dawley rats were given oral MPH, and their cognitive and motor abilities were tested. Results suggest that while MPH improves task performance in adults; there is no improvement in the aged animals. These outcomes suggest that use of MPH for cognitive enhancement in elderly individuals may be ineffective.

Thirty-three lesions (18.4%) showed linear enhancement, a linear-shaped positive enhancement in the RFA-treated area. Seventeen of them were followed up with no treatment (remaining 16; dropout in eight, additional RFA in six and ineffective treatment in two) and three lesions (3/17, 17.6%) showed local tumor progression corresponding to linear enhancement at 7, 14, 19 months after RFA. Although there was no significant difference in local recurrence rate between the lesions with (3/17) and without linear enhancement (10/35), local tumor progression inside the ablation zone occurred only in the lesions with linear enhancement. In conclusion, linear enhancement inside the RFA-treated area should be followed up within 7 months because it has a risk of local tumor progression. Histology of linear enhancement and its influence on distant recurrence remain to be solved. Copyright Â© 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mice with constitutive ablation of the Bassoon (Bsn) gene display impaired presynaptic function, show sensory deficits and develop severe seizures. To specifically study the role of Bassoon at excitatory forebrain synapses and its relevance for control of behavior, we generated conditional knockout (Bsn cKO) mice by gene ablation through an Emx1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase. In these animals, we confirm selective loss of Bassoon from glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain. Behavioral assessment revealed that, in comparison to wild-type littermates, Bsn cKO mice display selectively enhanced contextual fear memory and increased novelty preference in a spatial discrimination/pattern separation task. These changes are accompanied by an augmentation of baseline synaptic transmission at medial perforant path to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses, as indicated by increased ratios of field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope to fiber volley amplitude. At the structural level, an increased complexity of apical dendrites of DG granule cells can be detected in Bsn cKO mice. In addition, alterations in the expression of cellular maturation markers and a lack of age-dependent decrease in excitability between juvenile and adult Bsn cKO mice are observed. Our data suggest that expression of Bassoon in excitatory forebrain neurons is required for the normal maturation of the DG and important for spatial and contextual memory.\n\nRepeated restraint stress enhances cue-elicited conditioned freezing and impairs acquisition of extinction in an age-dependent manner\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Wei; Rosenkranz, J. Amiel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAffective disorders are believed to involve dysfunction within the amygdala, a key structure for processing emotional information. Chronic stress may contribute to affective disorders such as depression and anxiety via its effects on the amygdala. Previous research has shown that chronic stress increases amygdala neuronal activity in an age-dependent manner. However, whether these distinct changes in amgydala neuronal activity are accompanied by age-dependent changes in amygdala-dependent affective behavior is unclear. In this study, we investigated how chronic stress impacts amgydala-dependent auditory fear conditioning in adolescent and adult rats in a repeated restraint model. We found that repeated restraint enhanced conditioned freezing in both adolescent and adult rats. But repeated restraint led to impaired acquisition of fear extinction only in adolescent rats. Along with previous findings, these results suggest that chronic stress may precipitate affective disorders via differential mechanisms, with different outcomes at different ages.

E.; Lehmann, H. I.; Johnson, S. B.; Packer, D. L.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPatients with ventricular arrhythmias typically exhibit myocardial scarring, which is believed to be an important anatomic substrate for reentrant circuits, thereby making these regions a key target in catheter ablation therapy. In ablation therapy, a catheter is guided into the left ventricle and radiofrequency energy is delivered into the tissue to interrupt arrhythmic electrical pathways. Low bipolar voltage regions are typically localized during the procedure through point-by-point construction of an electroanatomic map by sampling the endocardial surface with the ablation catheter and are used as a surrogate for myocardial scar. This process is time consuming, requires significant skill, and has the potential to miss low voltage sites. This has led to efforts to quantify myocardial scar preoperatively using delayed, contrast-enhanced MRI. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of left ventricular scar identification from delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for guidance of catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. Myocardial infarcts were created in three canines followed by a delayed, contrast enhanced MRI scan and electroanatomic mapping. The left ventricle and myocardial scar is segmented from preoperative MRI images and sampled points from the procedural electroanatomical map are registered to the segmented endocardial surface. Sampled points with low bipolar voltage points visually align with the segmented scar regions. This work demonstrates the potential utility of using preoperative delayed, enhanced MRI to identify myocardial scarring for guidance of ventricular catheter ablation therapy.\n\nFlow-dependent vascular heat transfer during microwave thermal ablation.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiang, Jason; Hynes, Kieran; Brace, Christopher L\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMicrowave tumor ablation is an attractive option for thermal ablation because of its inherent benefits over radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microwave energy heats tissue to higher temperatures and at a faster rate than RFA, creating larger, more homogenous ablation zones. In this study, we investigate microwave heating near large vasculature using coupled fluid-flow and thermal analysis. Low-flow conditions are predicted to be more likely to cause cytotoxic heating and, therefore, vessel thrombosis and endothelial damage of downstream tissues. Such conditions may be more prevalent in patient with severe cirrhosis or compromised blood flow. High-flow conditions create the more familiar heat-sink effect that can protect perivascular tissues from the intended thermal damage. These results may help guide placement and use of microwave ablation technologies in future studies.\n\nRole of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in follow-up assessment after ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZheng, Shu-Guang; Xu, Hui-Xiong; Lu, Ming-De; Xie, Xiao-Yan; Xu, Zuo-Feng; Liu, Guang-Jian; Liu, Lin-Na\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAIM: To assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) during follow-up after percutaneous ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: A total of 141 patients with HCCs who received percutaneous ablation therapy were assessed by paired follow-up CEUS and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). The follow-up scheme was designed prospectively and the intervals between CEUS and CECT examinations were less than 14 d. Both images of follow-up CEUS and CECT were reviewed by radiologists. The ablated lesions were evaluated and classified as local tumor progression (LTP) and LTP-free. LTP was defined as regrowth of tumor inside or adjacent to the successfully treated nodule. The detected new intrahepatic recurrences were also evaluated and defined as presence of intrahepatic new foci. On CEUS and CECT, LTP and new intrahepatic recurrence both were displayed as typical enhancement pattern of HCC (i.e., hyper-enhancing during the arterial phase and washout in the late phase). With CECT as the reference standard, the ability of CEUS in detecting LTP or new intrahepatic recurrence during follow-up was evaluated. RESULTS: During a follow-up period of 1-31 mo (median, 4 mo), 169 paired CEUS and CECT examinations were carried out for the 141 patients. For a total of 221 ablated lesions, 266 comparisons between CEUS and CECT findings were performed. Thirty-three LTPs were detected on CEUS whereas 40 LTPs were detected on CECT, there was significant difference (P < 0.001). In comparison with CECT, the numbers of false positive and false negative LTPs detected on CEUS were 6 and 13, respectively; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy of CEUS in detecting LTPs were 67.5%, 97.4%, 81.8%, 94.4% and 92.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, 131 new intrahepatic recurrent foci were detected on CEUS whereas 183 were detected on CECT, there was also significant difference (P < 0.05).

Twenty-three patients (17 men and 6 women, range: 45-85 years old, mean age 65 years) with malignant liver tumors underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous tumor ablation [radiofrequency (n = 14), microwave (n = 9)] followed by intravenous contrast-enhanced CBCT. Baseline multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and peri-procedural CBCT images were compared. CBCT image quality was assessed as poor, good, or excellent. Image fusion was performed to assess tumor coverage, and quality of fusion was rated as bad, good, or excellent. Ablation zone volumes on peri-procedural CBCT and post-procedural MDCT were compared using the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon t-test. Rate of primary ablation effectiveness was 100%. There were no complications related to ablation. Local tumor recurrence and new liver tumors were found 3 mo after initial treatment in one patient (4%). The ablation zone was identified in 21/23 (91.3%) patients on CBCT. The fusion of baseline MDCT and peri-procedural CBCT images was feasible in all patients and showed satisfactory tumor coverage (at least 5-mm margin). CBCT image quality was poor, good, and excellent in 2 (9%), 8 (35%), and 13 (56%), patients respectively. Registration quality between peri-procedural CBCT and post-procedural MDCT images was good to excellent in 17/23 (74%) patients. The median ablation volume on peri-procedural CBCT and post-procedural MDCT was 30 cm(3) (range: 4-95 cm(3)) and 30 cm(3) (range: 4-124 cm(3)), respectively (P-value > 0.2). There was a good correlation (r = 0.79) between the volumes of the two techniques. Contrast-enhanced CBCT after tumor ablation of the liver allows early assessment of the ablation zone.\n\nLocalization of gaps during redo ablations of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Preferential patterns depending on the choice of cryoballoon ablation or radiofrequency ablation for the initial procedure.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaland, Vincent; Pavin, Dominique; Behar, Nathalie; Auffret, Vincent; FÃ©nÃ©on, Damien; Behaghel, Albin; Daubert, Jean-Claude; Mabo, Philippe; Martins, RaphaÃ«l P\n\n2016-11-01\n\nPulmonary vein (PV) isolation, using cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation, is the cornerstone therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. One-third of the patients have recurrences, mainly due to PV reconnections. To describe the different locations of reconnection sites in patients who had previously undergone radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation, and to compare the characteristics of the redo procedures in both instances. Demographic data and characteristics of the initial ablation (cryoballoon or radiofrequency) were collected. Number and localization of reconduction gaps, and redo characteristics were reviewed. Seventy-four patients scheduled for a redo ablation of paroxysmal AF were included; 38 had been treated by radiofrequency ablation and 36 by cryoballoon ablation during the first procedure. For the initial ablation, procedural and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter for cryoballoon ablation (147.8Â±52.6min vs. 226.6Â±64.3min [P<0.001] and 37.0Â±17.7min vs. 50.8Â±22.7min [P=0.005], respectively). Overall, an identical number of gaps was found during redo procedures of cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablations. However, a significantly higher number of gaps were located in the right superior PV for patients first ablated with radiofrequency (0.9Â±1.0 vs. 0.5Â±0.9; P=0.009). Gap localization displayed different patterns. Although not significant, redo procedures of cryoballoon ablation were slightly shorter and needed shorter durations of radiofrequency to achieve PV isolation. During redo procedures, gap localization pattern is different for patients first ablated with cryoballoon or radiofrequency ablation, and right superior PV reconnections occur more frequently after radiofrequency ablation. Redo ablation of a previous cryoballoon ablation appears to be easier. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that can attain single-molecule sensitivity and has been shown to complement mass spectrometry, but lacks widespread application without a robust method that utilizes the effect. We demonstrate a new, highly sensitive, and widely applicable approach to SERS analysis based on laser ablation in the presence of a tailored plasmonic substrate. We analyze several challenging compounds, including non-water-soluble pigments and dyed leather from an ancient Egyptian chariot, achieving sensitivity as high as 120 amol for a 1:1 signal-to-noise ratio and 5 Î¼m spatial resolution. This represents orders of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to those of other SERS approaches intended for widespread application, greatly increasing the applicability of SERS.\n\nImproved multimodality data fusion of late gadolinium enhancement MRI to left ventricular voltage maps in ventricular tachycardia ablation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoujol, Sebastien; Basha, Tamer A; Tan, Alex; Khanna, Varun; Chan, Raymond H; Moghari, Mehdi H; Rayatzadeh, Hussein; Shaw, Jaime L; Josephson, Mark E; Nezafat, Reza\n\n2013-05-01\n\nElectroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) is commonly performed prior to catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) to locate the arrhythmic substrate and to guide the ablation procedure. EAVM is used to locate the position of the ablation catheter and to provide a 3-D reconstruction of left-ventricular anatomy and scar. However, EAVM measurements only represent the endocardial scar with no transmural or epicardial information. Furthermore, EAVM is a time-consuming procedure, with a high operator dependence and has low sampling density, i.e., spatial resolution. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive assessment of scar morphology that can depict 3-D scar architecture. Despite the potential use of LGE as a roadmap for VT ablation for identification of arrhythmogenic substrate, its utility has been very limited. To allow for identification of VT substrate, a correlation is needed between the substrates identified by EAVM as the gold standard and LGE-MRI scar characteristics. To do so, a system must be developed to fuse the datasets from these modalities. In this study, a registration pipeline for the fusion of LGE-MRI and EAVM data is presented. A novel surface registration algorithm is proposed, integrating the matching of global scar areas as an additional constraint in the registration process. A preparatory landmark registration is initially performed to expedite the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the registration in the presence of errors in identifying landmarks in EAVM or LGE-MRI datasets as well as additional errors due to respiratory or cardiac motion. Subsequently, the accuracy of the proposed fusion system was evaluated in a cohort of ten patients undergoing VT ablation where both EAVM and LGE-MRI data were available. Compared to landmark registration and surface registration, the presented method achieved significant\n\nEnhancement of Intermittent Androgen Ablation Therapy by Finasteride Administration in Animal Models\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2003-02-01\n\nthat intermittent androgen ablation therapy can be enhanced by finasteride , an inhibitor of T to DHT conversion, To test our hypothesis in animal...models, it is necessary to deliver exogenous T at physiologic levels and finasteride over a long period of time, We have worked out conditions to deliver T and finasteride in nude mice, which will allow us to test our hypothesis.\n\nCK1Î± ablation in keratinocytes induces p53-dependent, sunburn-protective skin hyperpigmentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Chung-Hsing; Kuo, Che-Jung; Ito, Takamichi; Su, Yu-Ya; Jiang, Si-Tse; Chiu, Min-Hsi; Lin, Yi-Hsiung; Nist, Andrea; Mernberger, Marco; Stiewe, Thorsten; Ito, Shosuke; Wakamatsu, Kazumasa; Hsueh, Yi-An; Shieh, Sheau-Yann; Snir-Alkalay, Irit; Ben-Neriah, Yinon\n\n2017-09-19\n\nCasein kinase 1Î± (CK1Î±), a component of the Î²-catenin destruction complex, is a critical regulator of Wnt signaling; its ablation induces both Wnt and p53 activation.

As expected, CK1Î± loss was accompanied by Î²-catenin and p53 stabilization, with the preferential induction of p53 target genes, but phenotypically most striking was hyperpigmentation of the skin, importantly without tumorigenesis, for at least 9 mo after Csnk1a1 ablation.

Transcriptome analysis of the epidermis revealed p53-dependent up-regulation of Kit ligand (KitL).

Here we report a kind of core/shell structured Zn/ZnO nanoparticles with enhanced photocatalysis efficiency, which were synthesized by a highly-productive gaseous laser ablation method. The nanodroplets generated by laser ablation would be reduced to zinc in the protective atmosphere, and further be oxidized at surface to form a specific core/shell structured Zn/ZnO nanoparticles within seconds. Thanks to the formation of this Zn-ZnO Schottky junction, the photocatalysis degradation efficiency of such core/shell Zn/ZnO nanostructure is significantly improved owing to the enhanced visible light absorption and inhibited carrier recombination by introducing the metallic zinc.\n\n[Effect of low-dose focused ultrasound pre-irradiation versus microbubbles for enhancing high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of VX2 hepatic tumor in rabbits].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yi; Yang, Chao; Zou, Jian-Zhong; Chen, Fei; Ou, Xia; Zou, Hai-Rong; Wang, Yan\n\n2016-10-20\n\nTo compare the effect of low-dose focused ultrasound pre-irradiation and microbubbles for enhancing the ablation effect of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) on VX 2 hepatic tumor in rabbits. Fifty-five rabbits bearing VX 2 hepatic tumor were randomly divided into low-dose pre-irradiation + HIFU ablation group, microbubbles+HIFU ablation group, and HIFU ablation group for corresponding treatments. The pathological changes in the tumors after low-dose irradiation, time for HIFU ablation, tumor volume with coagulative necrosis, energy efficiency factor (EEF), pathological changes in the ablated tumor, and sound channel of HIFU ablation were observed. Tumor cell edema, vacuolar changes in the cytoplasm and tumor interstitial vascular congestion were observed 24 h after low-dose pre-irradiation. The ablation time were significantly shorter, coagulative necrosis volume was larger, and EEF was lower in low-dose irradiation + HIFU ablation group and microbubbles+HIFU ablation group than in simple HIFU ablation group (P<0.05), but the differences between the former two groups were not significant. The effectiveness and stability of the synergistic effect of low-dose pre-irradiation were inferior to microbubbles, but the former ensured a better safety of the sound channel. Low-dose irradiation has comparable synergistic effect in HIFU with microbubbles with such advantages as non-invasiveness, high concentration and good safety, and can be a potentially new method to enhance the efficiency of HIFU.\n\nAblation of toll-like receptor 4 attenuates aging-induced myocardial remodeling and contractile dysfunction through NCoRI-HDAC1-mediated regulation of autophagy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Shuyi; Ge, Wei; Harns, Carrie; Meng, Xianzhong; Zhang, Yingmei; Ren, Jun\n\n2018-04-13\n\nAging is usually accompanied with overt structural and functional changes as well as suppressed autophagy in the heart although the precise regulatory mechanisms are somewhat unknown. Here we evaluated the role of the innate proinflammatory mediator toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in cardiac aging and the underlying mechanism with a focus on autophagy. Cardiac geometry and function were monitored in young or old wild-type (WT) and TLR4 knockout (TLR4 -/- ) mice using echocardiography, IonOptixÂ® edge-detection and fura-2 techniques.
