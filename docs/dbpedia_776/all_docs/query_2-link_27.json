(40 C)\n\nHikers cross the Colorado River on a narrow foot bridge 70 feet/ 21 m above the water.\n\nGrand Canyon National Park Area Map (83kb PDF File)\n\nAll Visitors MUST have an Entrance Pass\n\nLearn about entrance fee costs and passes >\n\n90% of Travelers Visit Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim\n\nSouth Rim\n\nThe South Rim is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nAll visitor services: camping, lodging, and food are available year round.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended during spring, summer and fall.\n\nMake South Rim Lodging Reservation information here > -- Make South Rim Campground Reservations here >\n\nBecause the South Rim is easier to get to, day-use visitors should expect traffic congestion and parking problems, especially during spring break and during summer months.\n\nThe least crowded time is November through February.

Most likely the car will have to be towed to Flagstaff or Williams, AZ .\n\nDistances are deceiving in this part of the country.

The next gas station may be quite a distance down the road.\n\nCarry several gallons of water in your car, particularly during summer months.\n\nLightning Danger\n\nSummer thunderstorms (July - September) provide beauty, excitement, and much needed water to Grand Canyon, but they also bring risk.
