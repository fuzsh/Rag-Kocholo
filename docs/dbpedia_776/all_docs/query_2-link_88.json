I really thank them for their generosity. They did not ask me to write a good review of the EA500 haha. In fact, my first impressions video was not good lol. Here:\n\nTo give a summary of that, I received 4 black nozzles! I do not have the red nozzles in my package. However, the team immediately sent me the red nozzles in no time. I am probably treated that way because I am going to review them. But I really hope that customers are also treated that way. But for my experience, the team has been very responsive with my concerns and the service is top notch.\n\nI am going to start calling these write ups “User experience”. I feel like the word “reviewer” is losing its credibility because some people believe that we are being paid or something like that haha. I am going to make a video about the truth and secrets of reviewing IEMS, so stay tuned!\n\nBut for now, this is my user experience of the Simgot EA500\n\nWHAT’S IN THE BOX?\n\nIt’s a nicely packed set. Premium design of the box, which will probably end up somewhere hidden in my room haha, lets get real .\n\nInside the box you get:\n\n1.) The beautiful shiny EA500\n\n2.) Very good quality cable- I like. It’s nicely braided and feels very good to touch.\n\n3.) My 4 black nozzles hahaha. But now I have 4 red nozzles too, coz they sent me 4. So that's a total of 8 nozzles hahaha.\n\n4.) Eartips in SML- but I don’t like how they pair with the set because they don’t seal well. The eartips are fine with other IEMS though.\n\n5.) It’s always good to have a carrying case, and they have one\n\n6.) Black and red rings- I honestly do not know why it is here haha.\n\nCOMFORT and BUILD\n\nGood build, all metal and yeah a scratch magnet. The vents are near the nozzle which I prefer. I dunno, I feel like vents near the nozzles have better resolution, at least in my experience with listening to 200+ sets in Japan.\n\nFit and comfort is commendable. I really like how comfortable they are in my ears. I do not notice any strain and I can fit them deeper too!\n\nSOUND\n\n\"The Nocebo\"\n\nAs you may have noticed in my video. I placed myself in a nocebo mode. What is a Nocebo? Well yeah, just exactly what you are thinking. It is a kind of placebo, but the effects are the opposite.\n\n“The minute a listener is challenged to hear differences in a stereo system using the double blind method, his defenses are put on high alert - fundamentally changing his abilities to hear differences, thus negating the results” – Paul McGowan et.al.\n\nWhy did I do this though? Haha. Well I just find it fascinating to play with my mind. I tried to counter the hype and understand why other people do not like this set.\n\nTo cut the story short, my first impressions of the set were not amazing. I only saw its flaws, especially in the bass. I felt that it did not have enough subbass to complement the brightness in the treble. And yeah, the treble was also too forward for me, it boosted some cymbal attacks making them sound a bit colored.\n\n\"I don’t stop until I understand\"\n\nBut I did not stop. I listened to the EA500 for a good two weeks to analyze its sound signature. This is a balanced set with emphasis on lower -mid treble. Yeah it is kinda bright with its overall signature. That must be the reason why people are putting on some tapes on the vents to compensate for the treble energy. Mind you though, it is not the strident kind of bright. They are actually pleasing, but you feel like the overall sound would be much more complete if it had some energy in the subbass.\n\nAlthough there is forwardness in the treble, I enjoyed how it replayed my library. I tried to understand what the fuzz was all about. When you listen to other sets after listening to the EA500, believe me, they will sound Lo-Res hahaha. Sometimes, you feel that others sets are dark, even if they are not. This is again because of the forwardness of the treble. If I am going to nitpick this set, I find that the timbre on some instruments aren’t really that perfect. I find them colored.\n\nHowever, they are very pleasing to listen to. You may not hear realism in timbre, but you will have loads of fun listening to the EA500\n\nAnd now I understand what the hype is all about.\n\n\"The waiting game: Project Red\"\n\nNo. it is not the project red from Crinacle haha. But I have the Crinacle red and here is my unboxing and first impressions for that haha.. plugging in..\n\nWhat I meant is the red nozzles, as I have mentioned in my unboxing and first impressions of the EA500. I did not receive my red nozzles. I only got 4 black nozzles. They have foams stuffed in. I emailed Simgot about this and asked if it was possible for me to replicate the red nozzles by removing the foams, and just replace the rings with red haha.\n\nThey replied that the red nozzles do have a different filter, and that they would be sending me the red nozzles.\n\nHaving said that, I carried on with my MOD while waiting- The black nozzles without foams.\n\nHow do they sound? Amazing! But maybe a bit grainy in the treble. The bass is tighter without the foam and the clarity is a notch up. You get a very crisp sound straight from the driver ahaha.\n\nGraph wise, there isn’t any noticeable difference. But on ears? Pretty big actually. This is a perfect example that graphs are not all, or at least the mics cannot capture everything.\n\nIf someone disagrees that the sound of the black nozzle with and without foams sound the same, I do not know what to say about that because for me, the biggest difference is in the bass decay and treble forwardness.\n\n\"And so the red nozzles arrive\"\n\nI was so excited when the nozzles arrived. I immediately listened to them and measured the difference. There is really a difference and I think it is in the filter they used. The red nozzles does not have the foams like the black ones have. Even if you remove the foams from the black nozzles, the sound is still different when compared to the red nozzles. They even measured differently.\n\nI now understand the hype. I understand why so many people like it. I understand why many praise it. I understand the price to performance ratio. Because this set, with the red nozzles, really deserve the title.\n\nThe bass is tight and clean. It still has the midbass emphasis and that fundamental forwardness, but this time, it is better presented. Mids are more correct sounding and the timbre of instruments are more pleasing to my ears. Vocals are nuanced especially female vocals. Treble energy is tamed in a good way. I do not hear aggressiveness like what I hear on black nozzles. It carries a better extension and the balance across the frequency is more even.\n\nI like this a lot. and so let is start in the actual review hahaha.\n\n\"What sounds good, sounds good\"\n\nAnd so I was done with my Nocebo. I tried changing eartips that matched my ear holes. Slowly, reality was sinking in and I could hear why this set is hyped to the moon. This driver is actually pretty good for its price. The clarity of everything is just superb on the EA500. This set has the tendency to highlight the trailing end of notes, making them pop longer in the background. The Technicalities of this set is just too good. The separation and layering is approaching near 3D, almost holographic. I found myself enjoying this set quite a lot. Who wouldn’t? What sounds good, sounds good.\n\n\"Are they one the best in the sub $100?\"\n\nI honestly think they are. The EA500 is very easy to like and you would really have to load yourself with Nocebo to dislike them. I saw other graphs comparing them to the Olina SE, and they are probably not wrong about it. The upper mids and treble elevation resembles the Olina SE, except for the Bass. I do feel that the Olinas sound more complete and more balanced, but what would Simgot get if it copied the exact tuning of the Olinas?\n\nInstead, the EA500 made its way to the sub $100 with its own unique tuning, interchangeable nozzles and a well-planned package and accessories.\n\nPROS\n\nA very good all-rounder. Like really. I tried scrolling my library and any genre I play, the EA500 just plays it with finesse. The ability of the EA500 to extract details and dynamics is simply amazing.\n\nthe micro details is amazing on this set. It tends to make the trailing end of notes pop and make them linger longer. I have noticed that I do not even need to focus much on chords and guitar solos because the EA500 displays them in a clear manner.\n\nGreat vocal presence. And when I say presence, I mean the space around them is well defined. You hear the breaths, layering and melodies. I was surprised at how clear the vocals were in the track “Replicant” by Yorushika.\n\nany track with guitars sound amazing on the EA500. Acoustic tracks also excel. Listening to Taylor swift is perfect with these. The harmonics of guitars are well portrayed, and female vocals also benefit from the treble forwardness.\n\nCONS\n\nalthough the stage is almost holographic, the midbass emphasis is preventing them to sound more open. They are not compressed in any way, but I feel like a little less midbass would make the balance better so that the stage is more natural. I noticed that in the track Gunjo by Yoasobi, the venue was like in a small room.\n\nat times, the upper mids to low treble can actually be a bit much for some, especially the black nozzles. It feels like Chu treble forwardness, but with better transparency. But still, it prevents the EA500 to have that realism in cymbal timbre.\n\nthe stock eartips just don’t work for me. It doesn’t seal! The eartips itself is not the problem, because the eartips works fine with other iems. But the pairing of this eartip and the structure of the EA500 creates a leak, and I hear a loud pop similar to that of a driver flex, but louder. Why do I know it’s not driver flex? Because I know it is not sealing well and I hear outside noise like I am not wearing an IEM haha.\n\nthe overall tonality might not be for everyone. I have talked about this in some disord servers (Mike Bruce's). One person commented that they are not good for metal tracks, and I do kind of agree. The signature cannot resolve drop tunings well, because it does not have enough subbass extension.\n\nSCORING\n\n-Please be reminded that my scoring is always based on its price range.\n\nTONALITY - 2.5\n\nBASS - 2.5\n\nMIDS - 3\n\nTREBLE - 2.5\n\nTECHS - 3\n\n=13.5 ( A+ rank, generally better than other sets. Very good for the price but the tonality might not match your preferences)\n\nCheck my scoring criteria here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15WhgCgiMzWfF3ccgB8SK5-Cg7m87kpIShtxsyg2u-AI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThis is a balanced set. I would not call it neutral. There is a bit of elevation in the midbass and lower mids that gives enough coloration. There is also some emphasis on the mid treble that makes tracks more engaging and playful.\n\nBass is not basshead level but gives me the enough level to enjoy riffs in metal tracks. It is fast and snappy. I do wish it had a little bit of subbass to make it more linear.\n\nMids are full and lush sounding, with a lot of focus in fundamentals. It just sounds very clear but you notice that little coloration, albeit in a nice way.\n\nTreble is forward, but not the strident kind. It is very playful in this area. Again, a little bit of coloration because I do think cymbals don’t sound as natural as should be, but this presentation is still very enjoyable for me.\n\nTechnicalities are what makes this set special. The resolution and clarity is really good and the positional cues, although not accurate, renders stage like you are in a small pub. The separation of instruments is well done for a single driver, almost on par with my RS1 in terms of layering really. The microdetails and nuance are also emphasized and they are just very fun when finding out a lot of stuff in tracks.\n\nCountless mods exist because they are not perfect. It just means that there is lacking with the EA500, or probably something too much, and people are trying to find that sweet spot of this beautiful set.\n\nSimgot has provided different options for users to play with the EA500. The two tuning nozzles, and a DIY kit that includes different filters.\n\nI had an amazing time with this set in all honesty. They went from Zero to Hero, from B+ to A+ in my scoring. Because again, what sounds good, sounds good.\n\nThey did not reach an S however, because I thought the overall tonality can still be improved. But still, it's a good score and I can safely recommend these to anyone looking for an all rounder.\n\nIn the box, there is a quote that says: “ Don’t try to add more years to your life. Better add more life to your years”.\n\nHell yeah! When I put them in my ears, it is like I am in a bar, and I feel like it’s Friday every day.\n\nSimgot EA500, the playful kind\n\n==========================\n\nWHERE TO BUY: non affiliate links\n\nhttp://www.simgot.com/en/products/detail/26.html#!/detail\n\nhttps://www.linsoul.com/products/simgot-ea500\n\nhttps://hifigo.com/products/simgot-ea500\n\nSETUP:\n\n-Shanling M3X using UAPP, Hiby ang stock player\n\n-stock cable\n\n-radius deep mount eartips\n\nMY LIBRARY:\n\nI grew up listening to 90’s music.

Hope you enjoyed reading.\n\nThe Reflection Of A Brilliant Sound\n\nPros: Very good analytical sound, high resolution, with great ability to extract even minute details.\n\n- Good tuning, extension and treble energy level.\n\n- Remarkable separation, clarity and transparency. A vaporous and ethereal soundstage.\n\n- High level of construction and very good finish.\n\n- Good ergonomics and fit.\n\n- Appreciable case.\n\nCons: The bass is smooth, with little depth, simple to recreate layers, follow lines and build structure.\n\n- It is not very deep, nor does it possess much energy in the lower range.\n\n- The mids can be a little thin and lean towards detail, lacking physicality and body.\n\n- Just a set of tips.\n\n- The black mouthpiece can be spicy, sibilant and incisive, for its energy level and sparkle, in the second half of the frequency range.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter a change, as usual, I keep trying new brands. This is the case of Simgot, a company founded in June 2015, based in Shenzhen, focused on the development and promotion of audio equipment. Its products include its first EN700 IEMs and its updated EN700 BASS version, EN700 PRO. As a curiosity, SIMGOT stands for \"Simple and Elegant\". In this case, I am going to review the EA500, an IEMS with a 10 mm dynamic driver with dual magnetic circuit with N52 magnet and dual cavity structure. It uses a 4th generation DLC composite diaphragm. The detachable mouthpiece design offers two different frequency responses. The capsules are all-metal, manufactured with a mirror-plated process for durability and sonic performance. All this and its sound will be discussed in the next review.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDriver Type: 10mm dynamic driver, with 4th generation DLC diaphragm, dual magnetic circuit with N52 magnet and dual cavity structure.\n\nFrequency Response Range: 10Hz-50kHz.\n\nEffective Frequency Response: 20Hz - 20kHz.\n\nSensitivity: 123dB/Vrms (@1kHz mouthpiece with red ring) 124dB/Vrms (@1kHz mouthpiece with black ring).\n\nImpedance: 16Ω+15% (@1kHz).\n\nJack Connector: SE 3.5mm gold-plated.\n\nCapsule Connection Type: 2Pin 0.78mm.\n\nHigh purity silver plated OFC cable.\n\nPackaging\n\nThe Simgot EA500 comes in a medium-sized black box, whose dimensions are 144x123x63mm. In the centre of the main face is a picture of an unreal landscape. The Hi-Res logo is in the top right corner. In the upper left corner is the brand name and below the picture the model. On the back side are the specifications, in Chinese, English and Korean. There are also the two frequency responses provided by the two mouthpieces. The outer cardboard is removed from the side, which gives access to a black cardboard box. After lifting the lid, as if it were a book, you will find the two shiny, polished capsules, encased in foam lined like the box. Underneath is a small box with the accessories. Inside you can find a zippered case containing the rest. In a nutshell:\n\nThe two Simgot EA500 capsules.\n\nOne high-purity silver-plated OFC cable with 3.5mm SE gold-plated plug.\n\nA black, oval, zippered carrying case.\n\n2 manuals in various languages.\n\n1 pouch with red and black O-rings.\n\nTwo black screw-on nipples. The red ones are inserted into the capsules.\n\n3 pairs of translucent white silicone tips with black core, sizes SxMxL.\n\nThe best thing is the presentation itself, austere and slightly different. But above all the zippered case. The manuals are appreciated, but more tips are missing, there is only one set.\n\nConstruction and Design\n\nThe Simgot EA500 features a polished and shiny construction, which is slightly different due to its two-tier design on the inner side, as well as some details that make it eloquent and attractive. The capsules are all-metal and mirror-plated. Each is made up of two visibly separate faces. The outer face has an equilateral triangle design, with very rounded corners. In the centre is the brand logo. The model name is engraved on the edge in capital letters. The rigid, translucent plastic part, which contains the gold-plated 2Pin 0.78mm connection, is slightly recessed. The inner side has two levels. On the lower level there is a recessed oval, which contains a hole, at the bottom of which there is a metal grid. Next to it is a gold-plated Torx screw. Outside the oval, but near the centre, there is an engraved circle, inside which is the letter indicating the channel. The second level of the inner face is more rounded and contains the mouthpiece. Close to the mouthpiece is another hole, the bottom of which is protected by a cloth grille. The nozzles are inclined and have a thread at the tip for attaching the metal filters. The filter with the red O-ring has nothing inside, while the black filter has a foam of the same colour.\n\nThe nozzles have a length of 4.5mm, a smaller diameter of 5.1mm and a larger diameter of 6.1mm at the edge.\n\nThe wire has two coiled strands, silver plated and covered with transparent plastic. All parts are made of plastic. The plug sleeve is of the classic black L-cylinder type. The 3.5mm SE connector is gold-plated. The splitter piece is also made of black plastic. It has a rectangular shape, the lower corners of which are rounded. Engraved in a recessed circle is the brand logo. The slide is made of the same material, rectangular, with two lowered ovals inside, with two through holes for each wire. You can read the brand name inscribed on each larger side. There is a white Velcro strap with a slogan written in black letters. It has guides on semi-rigid ears and the connectors are 2Pin 0.78mm long and gold-plated. The sleeves are the classic rectangular two-tier ones, each with a coloured dot to indicate the channel.\n\nGreat design for the capsules, with a mirror finish that is a fingerprint magnet. The weight of each capsule is noticeable in the hand.\n\nThe cable is more classic, but still of good quality. Although I would have preferred a copper cable to soften the character of the EA500s, I must admit that the silver plating gives it a continuist matching look.\n\nAdjustment and Ergonomics\n\nAlthough the capsules look a little large in appearance, the two-level design of the inner face makes them ergonomic and easy to position inside the cabinet. The angle of the mouthpieces is also very good. It is true that, on the whole, they are a little short and the insertion does not go beyond the surface. With some tips, a slightly deeper insertion could be achieved.\n\nIt also feels that the weight in the hand is evident, but in the ears it is not noticeable, thanks to the remarkable level of fit and integration. The capsules hardly rotate at all and the fit is high, once you find occlusive and well-fitting tips, as is usually the case with my large foam-filled home-made tips. Thanks to them, the level of isolation is remarkable.\n\nSound\n\nProfile\n\nThe Simgot EA500s are in that segment of neutral IEMS, but with excited mid-highs. Depending on our tolerance, the mouthpieces used, the genres of music to be played and the character of the sources, they can range from tolerable to penetrating, harsh and unpleasant. All this, of course, from my personal bias.\n\nRed mouthpieces are at the limit of tolerance, while black mouthpieces are more excessive. In pure frequency response measurements, it can be seen that the bass response is very similar and that the changes produced by the nozzles are registered from the mids onwards. If the bass response feels altered, it is because of the difference from 1kHz onwards.\n\nThe general issue is not that the Simgot is very excited in the high-mids, but that the highs are quite full as well, which generates a higher concentration of energy from the second half of the mids onwards.\n\nAs mentioned, my preference and tolerance is for the red mouthpiece and it is with this that I describe the sound, in the following sections.\n\nBass\n\nThe bass does not dominate the sound, but is always behind or in neutral. It is quite full, smooth and broad, with a soft transient towards the mids. Its overall lightness is accentuated in the sub-bass, which is very much counterbalanced by the mid-highs. In electronic songs with kick drum and cymbal, the bass is in the background, while the cymbals stand out. And this representation is not what one expects when listening to electronica. In these settings, the bass is not particularly developed and is hard to concentrate on, when the high end is hammering the eardrums. If electronics are used with a lighter V (and we are back to Massive Attack) the lower range is drawn simple, without too much texture, subtly rough, with low dynamics and travel. The changes in power are quite slight, so the bass lines are not too pronounced, but not too expressive either. Similarly, the physicality of its punch is low and the amount of air moved is also low. The result is a low end that doesn't rumble, with a monotonous tendency that doesn't mark the bass lines, not even the bass drums, generating a bass melody rather than a bass response.\n\nThe pure tone test is moderately realistic, but colour is felt from the deepest LFOs. Although the reproduction is adequate and natural, it lacks physicality and more body in performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the technical level is appropriate, with a dry and concise, if simple, punch. Its speed is good, as well as its decay, it does not leave a trace and it evaporates quickly. It has precision and resolution, but due to the lack of body, energy and power, both the bass lines and the layers are relatively loose and deflated, with little punch and volume. The result is a well-adjusted bass, compact, more smooth than round, technically precise and pleasant, which needs amplification to emerge, but which finds in the high end a limiter of its dynamics and splendour, as well as occupying a light volume and neutral power.\n\nMids\n\nThe mids are quite clean and I don't find the smooth transition from the bass into this area to add warmth or intrusiveness. The first half is also lacking in body and the level of physicality is fairly neutral, with a balanced note weight and a medium thickness, which becomes lighter as the frequencies rise. Even with red mouthpieces, this is a sound that releases the warmth of musical compositions, bringing light and clarity to them, even as it lowers their density. In this respect, the EA500s work very well with warm music or sources, bringing a brighter, thinner and more transparent point of view. On the other side of the scale, this effect can be doubly positive for brighter music or cooler sources. The Amapiano, characterised by powerful sub-bass sections, has a metallic-brilliant cleanliness that the EA500s take care to emancipate more than necessary, to the point of making such compositions too demanding for my fifty-something eardrums. The explicit and descriptive level reached becomes penetrating, even fatiguing. With warmer music, however, the EA500s shine by adding a twist to dense, unpolished compositions, incorporating detail unheard of in other headphones.\n\nTurning to the first half of the mids, the male voices are relatively neutral, without too much thickness, drawn at medium distance, with a low physical level and volume, as is their density. It is a soft weight. Their timbre is natural, with a fine and luminous tendency. The instrumentation is similar, generating a delicate and relatively thin presentation, which allows space to open up between the notes, and to breathe light between them, something that helps to increase the precision, resolution and level of detail, as well as the perception of dynamics.\n\nIn the second half, neutrality is exceeded, flirting with sibilance and an evident energetic level. And this level is not framed in the upper-mid range, but extends towards the treble. This makes the male voices stretch in extension, giving the same weight and prominence to the body as to the details and harmonics, which distorts their full development. The detail is elevated above the fundamental and musicality is lost in favour of a fervent and vivid sensation that approaches the foreground. It is a sharp brilliance, whose delicate, subtle thickness makes it more cutting, penetrating, fatiguing, after all. And it is accentuated by the black filter. It is clear that the extraction of detail, nuance and staging is superior, placing the sound at an analytical point, which can go from interesting to stressful, depending on the music and the sources selected. Female vocals veer in the same way, becoming either splendid or painful. It is clear that the Simgot EA500 can go from angel to demon, moving away from being a good all-round ensemble, to becoming a more specialised IEMS.\n\nTreble\n\nThe treble has excellent extension for a dynamic driver and more so in this price range. They are able to maintain a high energy level and that contributes to the EA500's sound being crisp and focused, from the mid-highs onwards. There is a certain balance to that excitement - these are not eminently treble-driven IEMS, but it is clear that the range is strong, presentially speaking, at least, in its first half. In this way, their sonority is sharp, thin, fine and powerful, but without being hurtful. Although, it is clear that it may be too much for some sensitive ears. Even the black filter excites this band even more.\n\nAnother positive factor is the speed and dynamics of this range, something that brings a fairly high level of precision, definition and resolution. The result is a fairly full range, even in its air region, which helps to distinguish the overall sound as quite detailed, rigorous and concise. One of the best in its price range.\n\nSoundstage, Separation\n\nThe scene is airy, well-defined, has remarkable width and good height, though it suffers from a certain depth. The sensation offered is more vaporous and ethereal, much more capable of layering and distinguishing detail, than marking bass lines and composing them. There is much more flatness in the midrange and treble than in the bass, which is drawn more simply and linearly. In contrast, the nuances are much more expressive and surprising, reaching a very high analytical level for this price range. The level of resolution and detail definition is very good, even adding an unusual sonority, which offers an even more focused, diverse and distinctive sound, reaching micro detail with ease and ease of recreation.\n\nSeparation is also very good, as is the imaging and positioning of the elements, reaching an excellent level, comparatively speaking. There is a remarkable sense of air and distance between notes, which pronounces the sense of clarity, transparency and luminosity.\n\nComparisons\n\nDunu Kima\n\nThe Dunu Kima is just above $100, being in the range just above it. But there are some similarities between the two products. Both are metallic, with a mirror finish for the EA500 and a matte finish for the Kima. Both inner sides are characterised by two levels. The Kima seems to be smaller and less heavy and I prefer the matte design and the different planes on the outer side. Both have very good cases, but Dunu's presentation and accessories always have a special touch. In fact, both cables are similar, with the Dunu offering a better finish, as well as being slightly thicker.\n\nThe Simgot fit my ears better, offering a more occlusive feel and a more perfect seal than the Kima.\n\nSound-wise, the Kima's have a more relaxed treble presentation and a softer character on the analytical side. The EA500s are more sensitive and move more easily.\n\nThe Kima's bass is a little more pronounced in the sub-bass, being a little cleaner towards the mids. They also have a bit more punch, are more expressive, with more texture and roughness. The ratio between bass and mid-high/treble is more balanced in the Kima, hence the lower range is slightly more prominent and better represented than in the EA500.\n\nHowever, in the mids and highs, the EA500s are sharper, finer and more delicate. While there is a similar tuning overall, with the Kima being smoother in the mids and treble, they are also more relaxed in resolution. The Simgot have a more analytical, fine and transparent profile. The Kima's are not as bright or separated, and can even be a little more diffuse, comparatively speaking. The EA500's treble is more coherent and has a fuller, more accurate timbre. The Kima's treble roll-off gives them a sonority that can be a bit weirder at times, and less full-bodied at others. But, it also makes them more tolerable for extended listening. For critical listening, though, the EA500s are better.\n\nThe separation is more evident in the EA500, being sharper, more delicate and precise, achieving more resolution. The Kima has more depth, but the Simgot is more ethereal and vaporous, with more clarity and transparency. The greater precision gives it a more accurate image, while the Kima is somewhat calmer.\n\nThe Kima could become a variation of the EA500, with a mouthpiece that limits the treble, but with a less pronounced, but more musical, technical performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Simgot EA500 is a great example of the high standard of $80 IEMS available today. Its level of construction, design, finish and accessories put it in a position that was previously reserved for more expensive products. But even its sound is at a very high level of resolution, precision and definition. It has two tuning mouthpieces, whose differences are based on the high-mids and the first treble. Although in the graph, the changes are not very exaggerated, at the moment of truth and given the range of frequencies that it modifies, it is clearly distinguishable. The profile of the EA500 is neutral-bright, with a very efficient analytical character. Both characteristics can be enhanced by the use of black nozzles. However, the red mouthpieces do not soften the sound sufficiently for those who like a more balanced, relaxed or smooth profile. The EA500s are demanding on our ears and sensitive, whether to sources, genres of music or simply to the songs themselves. They are capable of extracting the best out of them, or even of crossing the occasional red line, if you look at them through the prism of pure musical enjoyment. Even so, the level of sound quality is very good, although it is possible that this is a product of a combination of its excited profile and the remarkable characteristics of the driver used, as well as its level of construction.\n\nSources Used During the Analysis\n\nAune X8 XVIII Magic DAC + EarMen ST-Amp.\n\nAune Flamingo.\n\nHidizs AP80 PRO-X Red Copper LE.\n\nTempoTec Variations V6.\n\nXduoo Link2 BAL.\n\nBurson Audio Playmate.\n\nLinsoul Audio Store, offered me this model, in exchange for writing an honest review.

The EA500 uses a 10mm 4th gen DLC, diamond like carbon based dynamic. Utilizing a dual magnet, dual cavity design in an all alloy metal CNC machined housing. The capable driver used on the EA500 is the basis for its sound but Simgot went beyond the one tuning usually associated with sub $100 IEMs by utilizing a nozzle change that applies a different take on the base harmon tuning of the EA500. The EA500 comes with two different nozzles for the IEM, both sets outfitted with acoustic material filters at the end of the nozzles. This affects how you hear the EA500. The red base filters is their base tuning which is based on a 2016 harmon curve. The black filter was provided for a more Simgot based tuning curve which adds more clarity, better separation for enhanced technical emphasis for vocals and acoustic instruments.\n\nThe Simgot tuning or the black filters is using a type of acoustic foam and enhances the upper mids with enhanced treble. This design is more of a technical take on the base tuning. Tonality ends up being brighter over neutral, this one will be the more controversial tuning over the standard red harmon filter. While clarity and perceivable detail has an uptick for this tuning. Tonal character bening brighter ends up being a touch fatiguing overall while intruding a big of sibilance for higher pitched vocal recordings. Not the most natural or the best balanced out of the two options. It's more of an analytical take on the Simgot sound.\n\nI personally preferred the red harmon tuning. Tonal character shifts to a more natural neutral leaning tonal character as well as the balancing of the 3 regions of sound. While your standard harmon tuned IEM still has a lot of upper mid emphasis the black filter brings an extra for the upper mids and trebles. To be fair, after listening to the black filter and getting used to it. I was able to understand why Simgot included this particular filter and how some folks might enjoy the EA500 using these as it does enhance its technical ability with an uptick in sound separation and imaging and gives more of an analytical edge to the sound balancing.\n\nBack to the red filter.\n\nThe harmon red filter is closer out of two to a neutral tuning. It seems to be the better balanced tuning for longer listening sessions and certainly not as intense as the black filter. My review is mostly based on using the red filter which is better suited for my eclectic music library.\n\nWith that I would like to thank @FiaLm of Simgot for providing a review sample of the EA500 for review purposes. You can look up the EA500 and all of Simgot IEMs on their web site here. Thanks for having the patience during my time of leave. The EA500 was burned in for a period of a week's time and is now ready for evaluation using my various audio sources. Fiio K9 Pro ESS, Ibasso DX300Max, Fiio M15, Shanling M6 pro, IFI gryphon, IFI signature for amping.\n\nAccessories.\n\nI am an accessories type of guy. For me nothing is more egregious than when an IEM manufacturer throws in a non matching cheap set of accessories and calls it good. Some companies do it better than others and with the EA500 we get one set of silicones that is just OK and a thinner included silver plated OFC cable. The case is large enough to fit all of it which I appreciate. I have gotten IEMs in the past that include cases that don't even fit the IEMs. Shows how much the IEM maker is paying attention to their own products.\n\nI suppose at the price point what was included with the EA500 is passable but I do recommend you do some tip rolling to help find the right tips that will fit better in sound and comfort for you. The included tips are nothing noteworthy and the included silver plated OFC cable is again just OK. I suppose it is better than your standard OFC copper cable but that is about it. Where Simgot spent most of their focus on was in the design of the EA500. Not so much the accessories. So there is that. I do recommend you try some better cables and tips on this one. More copper based if you would like greater note weight, better fullness of sound, greater bass impact with a smoother treble presentation. A mix of silver and copper like its base cable will get you a technical yet musical sounding EA500.\n\nThe design of the EA500.\n\nIs an all metal type housing. In the sub $200 bracket of IEMs I actually like the all metal design more so than the resin or cheaper plastic builds. In most use case scenarios it will be the sub $100 IEMs that will see the most use outdoors and while exercising. So the build has to be tops. Not only is the EA500 built solidly but they look more premium than the price would indicate. The all shiny chrome finish seems to be fairly scratch proof as well. My casual use of the IEM shows no signs of scratches anywhere I can find. Which for a shiny IEM I appreciate. Isolation is roughly average for a metal design which is to say is not exactly great but certainly passable to be used outdoors. If I was a guessing man it would be around 22dbs of passive isolation. The smaller medium teardrop/oval shape is easy in the ear for lasting comfort and I have no issues at all for its build and design. It is exemplary for universal designs especially for its price point.\n\nSound\n\nI went over the two types of tuning for the EA500 and for me the only way I can use the black nozzle tuning is if I changed the cable to a pure copper one and with foam tips to help mitigate a bit of the extra treble energy I am hearing from that tuning. If I was to base my review solely on that tuning I would not have given the EA500 the score you see on this review. It is as they say a bit much with 15dbs of pinna gain or upper mid gain and enhanced treble emphasis. Music sounds a bit forced a touch sharp which can cause fatigue especially for folks that are sensitive to trebles. As mentioned before technical aspects in the form of details and imaging are enhanced due to the increase of emphasis for these regions but at the cost of a natural tonal character and balancing.\n\nRed filter gets it right for me at around 10dbs of upper mid emphasis. I realize this might be a bit much for some folks but here once again your sources, tips and cables will play a huge part in getting the sound just right for you.\n\nThe EA500 balancing is typical of harmon tunings but where the EA500 seems to have an upper leg on other IEMs using a similar tuning curve is that they have very good note weight with a moderate spacious headstage. The EA500 has been described as a slightly bright neutral tuning but that does not mean it is a lean sounding IEM. The EA500 has enough forward projection and depth to make them sound musical at the same time which I can’t say about some of the other IEMs I have compared them to at the price point. This moderate yet ample note weight bodes extremely well for a true versatile sound. The resolve and technical ability for the price range has seen an increase over the years that the EA500 is a clear example of one of the best you can get for the price. I have seen rumblings of folks that complain about the treble harshness, I would strongly advise sticking to the red harmon filter and do some serious tip and cable rolling. Your source match will matter here as well.\n\nTrebles\n\nIs mostly grounded in performance with a solid rendering of macro details and surprisingly decent for micro details. Its standard harmon treble emphasis does show a good balancing act of details with good extension for the region.Trebles has a moderate level of air with an upper treble lift that helps the sparkle aspects. The EA500 use of a good resolving driver in conjunction with using stronger magnets plays a part to help with an accurate transient properties adding good precision aspect of its treble presentation. Trebles are tuned more balanced than having one area that is too much over the other and while I feel the treble is represented here I always appreciate treble that don’t overstay their welcome in the mix. Overall the treble is not too much but does just enough to bring a nice finishing touch to the overall sound of the EA500. Trebles sound more natural than forced, the black filter however is another story.\n\nThe black filter gets an increase for its treble presentation and will be slightly edgy on some recordings with vocal tracks and energetic EDM recordings. The benefit of more treble emphasis will bring better highlights to stringed instruments and female vocals. But it wasn’t like the standard red filter was muddy or lacking in that department in the first place. Some folks will like the r tuning curve of the black nozzle filters more so than the red. It will come down to sound preferences.\n\nThere is some debate weather harmon tunings brings a bit much in the way of trebles vs a more custom tuning. The EA500 I feel in sticking with an established tuning curve helps mitigate treble glare in the form of too much emphasis for the 6-8khz region. This area of emphasis on the EA500 is in the form of a down slope meaning it only has a moderate amount for this very sensitive region of sound and as a result. It does have a slight edge to its treble notes at times but tips help to get the trebles sounding just right for you and this is the part Simgot can clearly learn from other manufacturers like Fiio and Dunu. Tips are cheap but helps with the overall experience. Even at the budget level. 3 different sets of tips should be the bare minimum.\n\nMids\n\nMids have good moderate presence meaning it's not thin and certainly not overly thick and is not forward and is not recessed either. In comparison to more traditional V shaped IEMs the EA500 might sound a touch more forward for its mids but it clearly shows a proper mids with very good timbre for its price point. I feel this is where you see a lot of the statements online about the EA500 being comparable to much more expensive sets. Its timbre is very impressive for both vocal and instruments alike. I own more expensive dynamic sets that use similar driver tech as the EA500. Dunu Vernus which was a limited edition set and the Penon vortex. I can say the EA500 definitely puts up a good fight against these sets especially in the technical department and in looks. I suppose with an upgraded cable and tips the EA500 will come even closer to these sets which cost more than double of the EA500 so there is some validity to folks off the cuff claims that the EA500 is the “best under $300.” Claim. I don’t think they are actually better sounding than more expensive sets I mentioned here but again they will certainly represent well for the money and arguably the better value set out of the 3 I just mentioned.\n\nA safe sound?\n\nThe EA500 with its base red filter is just this, most folks will not have any issue with its red filter sound quality but I have read some impressions of folks that say they find the treble a bit much.I don't think so. I don't particularly find the treble aspects of the EA500 to be harsh or out of line much if at all. Now the black filter I can understand but not so much the red filter. Tips and cables do affect how you will perceive the EA500. Overall it is really a statement piece by Simgot and at an affordable price as well. Mids to me is some of the best for its class and price category. Nicely resolving, fairly spacious and with enough note weight to make everything you hear very believable. It's not the most dimensional sounding set but does show good layering for its mids presentation vs sounding a bit flat or too one dimensional.. Tonality of the black filter comes a bit bright or cooler in tone over neutral due to the enhanced upper mid pinna gain. It will all depend on your sound preference. Nice to have an option nonetheless.\n\nBass. This is another strong aspect of the EA500. Its dual magnets seem to help with a tighter, more detailed bass end than most IEMs at the price. The bass here is in moderation with nothing that is overly obvious or sticking out of the mix. It does show ample ability for a solid impact and a strong suit for the EA500, a realistic decay of the subbass. Texture is good on the EA500 for bass and I would even say above average for texture. Carbon based drivers have always done well for the bass department and here is another fine example of a moderate capable bass end that folks will be surprised about as the graph on these do not show an over abundance for bass emphasis. Looks a bit more closer to a neutral amount of emphasis but when you actually hear the bass. It's got good speed, tightness defined well and is punchy with a textured sub bass note that is surprisingly capable.\n\nIn the end\n\nThe EA500 does a whole lot of things right providing 2 tunings, of which one being a well balanced harmon representative. I have seen sales for the EA500 reaching a very affordable $79. And at that price. They are really excellent performers about as good as any in the industry. I went from reviewing a $3,000 Tansio Mirai RGB to the $79 EA500 and it wasn’t like the EA500 was so weak against a top flight TOTL performer. Not at all. In fact it was quite interesting the contrast of sound going from a very high end IEM to a nicely performing sub $100 IEM in the EA500. No way was I rejected by the EA500. Which tells a whole lot about just how good the EA500 really is. I can clearly understand the fanfare and why some folks are having some issue with its treble presentation. Especially with the black filter.\n\nThe EA500 provides the type of sound that enthusiasts around the world seem to be looking for. It is exemplary of its technical ability capped off by a moderate stage that shows a very capable imaging and detail ability. Has good depth and is just as enjoyable to listen to vs more expensive offerings. You really can’t ask for too much more given their price range actually. For that I can clearly understand why these are probably Simgots best selling IEM.\n\nComparisons\n\nThe EA500 comes on the heels of some very stiff competition at the price range.\n\nThe IEM that measures the closest to the EA500 would be the Dunu TitanS which share a lot of similarities to the EA500. Especially when compared with its red harmon tuning. TitanS uses a 11mm LCP diaphragm and a N52 magnet and an all metal housing similar to the EA500.\n\nNot only does the Titan S share similar tuning balancing but also happens to be in the same price bracket as the EA500. Overall tonal character is just ever so slightly sharper on the TitanS with a bit of a thinner note weight. TitanS has some extra emphasis in what seems to be around the 8Khz range making them tilt just a touch more brighter over the Red filtered EA500.\n\nThe Titan S tuning is like a middle of the red and the black filter for the EA500. What I mean by that is. It is not quite as bright as the black filter version of the EA500 but not exactly balanced like the red filtered EA500 either. The sound stages for both IEMs are very identical but where the biggest difference comes in the form of note weight. The TitanS sounds just a touch thinner in note weight vs the EA500 making them sound a bit more neutral overall sounding vs the EA500. In comparison the EA500 has a nice balance of its tuning aspect but also has the better more versatile note weight for its sound projection. Here is where if you thought the TitanS lacked a bit of musical engagement the EA500 is better in that front. I also noticed the bass end of the EA500 while emphasized similarly seems to have more body as well. Which again helps with a more musical take on the TitanS/ EA500 harmon tunings. Folks that own the Titan S might do well with looking into the EA500.\n\nThe SG-03s is the direct competitor to the Simgot EA500. Differences are as follows.Both use 10mm drivers. EA500 uses 10mm DLC dual magnets, dual cavity. N52 magnets.\n\nReecho SG-03s uses a 10mm LCP diaphragm, also uses N52 magnets. Both are comfortable for me anyways but I can see how some folks might prefer the EA500 more universal rounded shell design for expanded comfort. The Reecho SG-03s is physically larger shell wise but its shape makes for a nicely tight secure fit in the ear.\n\nEA500 is easier to drive a bit more sensitive at 16 ohms. Probably better for use if you plan on using it with just your phone actually. SG-03s being 35 ohms on an amp is out of this park good. I feel it scales a bit better with power vs the ES500. Reecho throws in a nice complete set of tips that work well with the SG-03s. Not so much the EA500. Its one set of silicones is just telling you to start looking for your own tips. Both cables are just throw ins but I feel both need cable upgrades.\n\nRG-03s wins in passive isolation over the EA500. Both are equally shiny a draw there. As per sound. The EA500 has only got a 24 hours of burn in while the SG-03s got easily over 300 hours of use and burn in.\n\nBoth are technically sound and show excellent technicalities for dynamics at the price range. The SG-03s has a slightly wider deeper larger scope of sound vs the EA500. Don't know if it is due to the larger shell it is using but shell size does play a part in how we perceive sound so there's that. As per the other aspects of technicals. They are very identical in their technical proficiency. Both show excellent details, imaging and timbre. I want to say the SG-03s has a slight leg up on dynamics and sound separation especially when amped that extra stage perception plays a part here. Speed on both sets are identical here as well. The EA500 shows just a slight slower decay of natural bass notes over the SG-03s but otherwise both show identical bass emphasis as well.\n\nSound balancing are done well on both sets. EA500 being more focused for its upper mids, standard harmon boost here. Female vocals are highlighted a touch more so for the EA500 and it has to do with having a bit more emphasis for the 6-7khz range. I would imagine the black filters even more so. Reecho utilizes a fairly large anti sibilance dip around 6-7Khz and that works but treble comes off just a bit subdued/ smoother vs the EA500. Treble sensitive folks might like how the RG-03s does treble vs the EA500 here. Definitely more forgiving of treble bright recordings for the SG-03s. Otherwise the actual treble extension are identical on both sets.\n\nI feel male vocals sound more fleshed out on the RG-03s vs the EA500 by a hair. Bass on both sets are emphasized about equally. Give or take about 7dbs which is not a lot but is clearly enough for a punchy bass depiction. Where the RG-03s has a slight advantage is that its larger soundstage highlights the bass end a bit better. It is a touch better separated vs being just blended in more so on the EA500 slightly more intimate stage if that makes sense. It seems like it has more bass due to this aspect but in reality they both have very similar bass emphasis in impact and sub bass as well. EA500 here has some surprisingly accurate bass decay and I think it has to do with the dual cavity dual magnet working here. If you didn't do an A-B like I am right now you would be surprised how close these two are in the bass area.\n\nA Different Sound Signature From A DLC IEM\n\nPros: 1. Open and extensive treble\n\n2. Energetic and forward mid range\n\n3. Controlled and textured bass\n\n4. Superb technicalities for an IEM in this price range\n\nCons: 1. Metallic timbre slightly present in the higher frequencies\n\n2. Poor sub bass extension\n\nReview OF The Simgot EA500​\n\nIntroduction​\n\nI haven't reviewed any Simgot products before, but I have used one of their older in-ear monitors, the EN700, which was very detailed and enjoyable to listen to. I was fascinated by their performance, especially at a time when there weren't many IEMs available for that price, they either sounded worse or really good. Simgot had one of the better ones. This company is headquartered in China, though I haven't been able to find much concrete or pertinent evidence of that as of yet with me. They recently returned with their two new releases, the EA2000 and EA500, both of which had new features and gave the brand a fresh look. But today I'll be reviewing the EA500. Let's investigate the IEM, but let's first go over some of the points I want to make clear before moving on.\n\nDisclaimer​\n\n*Since this unit tour was organised by the kindly people at Linsoul, I am grateful to them. And as I've said in all of my evaluations, the same is true for this one: all of the concepts I've expressed below are entirely my own, original ideas that haven't been influenced by anyone else. If interested, go to this link.\n\n*I am not associated with the connection, and I receive no financial assistance from anyone.\n\n*For the remainder of the review, I will refer to these IEMs as \"EA500.\"\n\n*I am using different Ear-tips for convenience and better versatility.\n\n*Finally, I will only evaluate the EA500 based on their performance, even though I will explain how it feels and seems physically and aesthetically.\n\nSpecification​\n\nThe EA500 only has a single dynamic driver configuration, and it uses the most recent 4th generation DLC composite diaphram in its 10mm dual magnetic and dual cavity dynamic driver. The metal shells are CNC milled with mirror plating, and the nozzles can be removed to alter the IEM's sound signature. The shells are quite heavy in the hand even though they don't put much weight on the ears; however, the fit was a problem with my ears, and I had to spend a lot of time practising tip rolling to get the ideal seal and fit. Only because of the fit did I feel fatigued after a lengthy listening session. The shells look exquisite and have a great premium finish. The provided nozzles have two different sound signatures: the black ring has the SIMGOT classic target curve response and the red ring has the H brand 2016 curve response. It appears to be hassle-free to change the nozzle, making it simple to do so. Despite being a high purity silver plated OFC cable with a 2 pin connection at one end and a 3.5mm straight plug at the other, the supplied cable feels heavy and slightly rubbery in my hands. The other accessories are three pairs of eartips in various sizes, a hard oval carrying case, two pairs of nozzles, lot of replaceable rings for the nozzle and a cable. In terms of the technical specifications, the sensitivity is approximately 123dB, and the impedance is 16 Ohms. The effective frequency response spans the range of 20Hz to 20kHz.\n\nSound​\n\nI haven't seen an IEM with this kind of tuning profile in a very long time, and to be completely honest, I really don't like it. It flows over the lower midrange while the upper midrange has a lot of presence in the mix. I am really enjoying listening to these for the first time. Not only does it sound exciting and fun, but the tuning has also been somewhat adjusted to suit my tastes. Despite the fact that I knew they were using a new generation DLC driver, I still expected this kind of reaction. Take the Dunu Titan S or Aria Snow Edition, for instance. Both of these have a DLC driver and deliver the same result. However, the way these were tuned sets the EA500 apart from these. If I compare the Aria Snow Edition to the EA500, which performs better in every aspect, whether it be the bass or treble region, they were not able to satisfy my engagement very well. I have also personally reviewed the Aria Titan S. The Titan S came the closest to having this smooth treble extension with the consistency of details produced, but even it couldn't produce the desired outcome. None of the IEMs had this. By stating that these have too much energy in the upper treble and by which I can understand, some people may exercise their understanding. However, the way they are tuned goes beyond what you might think; exactly the same thing happened to me. I'm taken aback by the aggressiveness of the response and how well-balanced and energising it sounds. The bass extension would be the only drawback, but that is only because that is how I personally prefer it. These are enjoyable to listen to overall. Let's examine sound more closely.\n\nTreble​\n\nWhen I first saw the graph, I clearly disliked it and thought there was nothing new about these, but when I actually listened to them, I was astounded to hear such engagement and energy, which would keep anyone on their toes and sound this satisfying. A little uneven progression between the lower treble made the Titan S sound too much for me after listening to them for a longer period of time than I would have normally if any other IEM had such a response. I had no idea that such a response was possible. The vocals are long and far-reaching, but when they reach their highest notes, a sweet and metallic flavour comes through. The sibilant is present but doesn't seem to dissipate or cause any unpleasant sibilance. Although the overall response balances it out, it doesn't pose a significant issue in the mix. The presentation of the instruments is tacky and light, which simultaneously makes it sound airy and detailed. Returning to the vocals, the female vocals in particular stand out because of the delightful softness of their notes, which makes the overall experience musical. The vocals and instruments sound more energetic and exciting in the lower treble while still maintaining consistency and a smooth flow of details. The instruments have a metallic timbre, and the vocals sound a little leaner. However, the overall response in this area works out well. The vocals are complemented by the instruments in such a way that the vocals sound more approachable and the instruments support and blend with good symbiosis. The listener is kept at ease by this amusing experience and it sounds effective. Some of the sounds that have been created have a peaky or sibilant feel to them, but they are rarely heard and only appear on upbeat tracks. I appreciate how they manage to avoid being offensive, add the best details, and maintain an open sound while doing so. The upper and lower trebles are both smooth, so there is never any mishap or incorrect recognition of how vocals and instruments are pronounced in either region because both of their integrity are safeguarded and maintained. Overall, this region's presentation is thorough, clear, and interesting.\n\nMid Range​\n\nEven though I recognise that such a response is designed to accommodate the overall mix, the energy distribution in the mid range still bothers me a little. I believe there should have been more control in both of the mid range's components. The mid range is absolutely correct to include this information in the mix. I think my taste is largely to blame, but I can't get over the fact that an overly expressive response in the lower and upper midrange makes me uncomfortable during extended listening sessions. Additionally, there is an uneven transition between lower and upper midrange. The upper mid range sounds more forward in the mix while retaining the same amount of energy as the lower treble. The vocals and instruments share the same ideals and shine brightly in the overall mix in the upper mid range, which is very energising and open. The female vocals hold a good balance between sounding dense and light because of the vocals' high level of energy, which makes them sound enticing and fleeting. Although the note weight and density are sufficient for the vocals to sound as natural as they can, I won't say that they sound lean. While it doesn't bother me all the time, I do find it to be unsettling after a while. I also discovered that some kinds of offensive nuanced are felt as hot and peaky characteristics that gives a little tiring experience. The instruments sound the same, despite a marked reduction in the metallic timbre, and they add a lot of sharp and distinct details. The foundation of such a response is not thick or warm yet gives a good note weight and clarity throughout the mix. The lower mid range is different from what one may expect because it doesn't sound how I anticipated because the vocals and the instruments have good reachability in the mix with clarity to them. Even so, I still believe that the lower mid range should have been warmer and thicker. The bass line produces bodied notes without sounding overly thick or natural. Although it doesn't sound realistic, it feels accurate. However, I do notice some negative differences between the vocals and the instruments. Overall, the mid range region is presented in an open, forward, and spirited manner.\n\nBass​\n\nAfter listening to these, I realised that the bass response was enjoyable to listen to and had a good solid presence of puches and slams that are qualitative in character. At first, I didn't think I would enjoy the bass response. Although the emphasis is on the sub bass range, it isn't strong enough to sound deep or produce a rumbling sensation. Due to the heavy emphasis on the sub-mid range, which results in a lack of 3D stage in the bass response, it also lacks a sense of the low-end base and sounds somewhat incomplete. The punches hit hard even though the sub bass region generally does its job well and contributes enough presence to the overall mix. Not only are the punches, but the slams as well, even though they lack the warmth and realistic note presentation and aren't as thick or meaty. I experienced the same thing while listening to the Titan S, though the Titan S's sub bass response was much better. The Aria Snow Edition had a warmer mid bass when compared to the EA500. The tactile and tight approach of the response is likely preventing me from feeling the slams and other impacts in the bass despite the midbass' strong presence in the mix and lean sound. The tight and controlled bass was one aspect of the bass response that I really liked. The overall response is not wacky as a result of the bass. Returning to the midbass, theoretically the frequency graph response suggests that it bleeds into the mix and gives you the impression that the bass response will be warm, thick, and organic, but after hearing the bass I have never been so mistaken. Although the bass bleeds into the mids, the lower mid range is not bloated or given a murky approach. To be completely honest, I don't understand such a bass response, but it satisfies my needs and improves my understanding of this tuning's overall presentation. If I'm not exaggerating, it might be due to the bass's intricate detail and texture. Every note has its own distinct identity. Overall, the bass region is presented in a controlled, textured, and punchy manner.\n\nTechnical Performance​\n\nRegarding technical performance, these are very effective, particularly in imaging, speed, and detail retrieval. The imaging is extremely sharp where there is a distance between notes, and the stage sounds nice and spacious. The resolution is excellent, with a great deal of detail and quick resolution. a more impressive response that mostly resembles Dunu Titan S. The ability to retrieve details might be the best in this price range. Let's go into more detail on this.\n\nSoundstage, Sound Imaging & Separation​\n\nThe positioning of the elements on the soundstage is correct, as nothing sounds out of place, and it is wide and expansive to sound spacious. Extremely clear and vivid imaging is present. Since there is sufficient space between notes for to breathe, I can identify the source of the sound thanks to the notes' distinct characteristics.\n\nSpeed & Resolution​\n\nAs a result of the response being expressive and open, the resolution is greatly enhanced with great detail retrieval. The notes have a quick attack and decay, and nothing sounds sloppy or messy. This keeps the response incredibly clean.\n\nSound Impressions​\n\nSound Using Red Nozzle​\n\nSince the changes were so slight, I only noticed them after listening to bright or bassy tracks. Changing the nozzles didn't really alter or change the sound, but there was a slight difference in the bass and treble response when using the red nozzles. The bass also became more prominent. Therefore, even though I consider the nozzles to be replacements in the event of a problem, I do not see any tuning adjustment in changing them.\n\nSources​\n\nTempotec V6 - The entire response is enticing and expressive when listening to EA500 with V6. The bass sounds adept at contributing to the mix to sound fun and engaging, and I also notice that there is a slight lift in the lowest part of the sub ass region to give it a more rumble nature. The treble is strong with details and sounds extensive. The mid range sounds very energetic and forward. The separation is far away, the imaging is sharp, and the stage is sufficiently large to sound spacious. The notes are written at a quick pace and have excellent resolution and expressive details. The best pairing I could find was with a V6.\n\niFi Hipdac - Hipdac listening to EA500 made the entire response more interesting and enjoyable to hear. As the response's details grew softer, the treble became a little easier to hear. The mid range sounded more lively and sibilant as it became more active in the mix. As the sub bass extension to it with rumble sensation felt frequently, the bass improved. The slams and punches became more powerful and impactful. Nothing in the technicalities felt improved or changed, with the exception of the stage, which grew closer. However, I still favour pairing it with a V6.\n\nTracks Used​\n\nLuna Haruna - Glory days\n\nLuna Haruna - Overfly\n\nRokudenashi - The Flame of Love\n\nLMYK - 0 (zero)\n\nORESKABAND - Jitensya\n\nMarina Horiuchi - Mizukagami no Sekai\n\nRADWIMPS - Suzume\n\nIndila - Love Story\n\nIndila - Tourner dans le vide\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire - September\n\nTom Petty - Free Fallin'\n\nFleetwood Mac - Everywhere\n\nNirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit\n\nBlue Oyester Cult - (Don't Fear) The Reaper\n\nGuns 'N' Roses - Sweet Child O' Mine\n\nThe Police - Every Breath You Take\n\nGojira - Amazonia\n\nTV on the radio - Wolf Like Me\n\nBring Me To The Horizon - Can You Feel My Heart\n\nBring Me To The Horizon - sTraNgeRs\n\nAvril Lavigne - Dare To Love Me\n\nTravis - Love Will Come Through\n\nGotye - Somebody That I Used To Know\n\nDJ Shadows - Six Days (Remix) [feat.

It is impressive for an IEM in this price range, where the technical specifications are higher than those of IEMs in this price range, to sound so clear and precise. Anyone who enjoys detailed and clean response that sounds close to mid-centric presentation with excellent treble extension should consider the Simgot EA500, in my opinion."
