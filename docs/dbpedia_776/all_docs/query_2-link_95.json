        "text": "\"Through the Fire and Flames\" (also known as TTFAF for short) is a song written and recorded by English power metal band DragonForce, appearing as the first track (and single) on their third studio album, Inhuman Rampage (2006). It is widely considered to be the hardest Guitar Hero song in the series. There are two ways to play this song on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock; the lead guitarist (Herman Li's part, some of Sam Totman's part) which is harder and more popular, or rhythm guitarist (Sam Totman's part). In Guitar Hero: Smash Hits, the song is available for full band play, with Bass replacing Rhythm.\n\nBecause of its inclusion in the game, DragonForce's sales greatly increased following its announcement in the game.[1] The song is also considered by some to be DragonForce's most popular song to date.\n\nThrough the Fire and Flames later returned for Guitar Hero Live in GHTV mode, being teased briefly on January 11, 2016 for a few hours but was officially released on February 3, 2016 in the Shred-A-Thon special music channel and was later added back to the music catalog on February 8, 2016. However, it is the 5-minute music video version in Guitar Hero Live due to GHTV having music videos.\n\nWalkthrough[]\n\nThe intro is generally considered the hardest part of the song. The intro is all hammer-ons, but its speed results in many players failing at less than 5%. A common method for passing the intro to the song is Tapping, but many find it passable while sticking with one fretting and one strumming hand. Some common tapping methods include tapping blue and orange, or tapping yellow, blue and orange. Another way is to hold green with any right hand finger, leave it there, and quickly hit the hammer-ons in the second (RYBO) hand position. Either way all notes higher than green should be hit and released to green very quickly.\n\nDuring the real song the intro is played on the clavichord. Simply hold down the green button and ignore it, focusing on the melody played on the red, yellow, blue and orange buttons and remember to release them to \"pull off\" to the green note. Many people prefer to tap this section. One trick is to put a rubber band around the green note for the intro. This is not considered \"cheating\" but more of a cheap trick used to progress more easily. In addition to a rubber band, they could also have another individual hold down the green button.\n\nTechnically, the intro is actually full of pull-offs, since in the game and real electric guitar, the ability to pull off makes the green note automatically play and is what propels players through this intro. Had the first note been green, and then the second red, rather than the reverse, then the whole intro could be termed hammer-ons due to the notes approaching from left to right. This would also make the intro very slightly easier due to the ability to hammer on the first note then pull off to green.\n\nPiano style players could try holding green with their pinky and their pointer finger above red. Their other hand could go above Yellow, Blue and Orange. They could then strum the first note with their foot. This would be entirely counterproductive as if they miss a single note then they need to strum with their foot again to restart the streak.\n\nThe song involves intensive strumming and fret work and contains the \"Red Snake\" (within the section of the song entitled So Far Away 3 in Practice Mode in Guitar Hero III) which has been calculated at about 26.6 notes per second, with ludicrously fast hammer-ons and pull-offs from red, green, red and up to yellow, blue and orange. Shortened up it would be RGR(Y,B,O) around 6.5 times per second. It can be FC'ed by anchoring and releasing the green and red notes right after the Y, B and O taps. In Smash Hits the Red Snake has been changed to similarly fast Y→R→G, B→R→G and O→R→G descending triplets.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that some of the keyboard sections are charted as guitar, such as in Verse 1 and \"Synth Death\" in Guitar Hero III. In Smash Hits, the keyboard parts have been converted into tap notes which helps identify them.\n\nThe song's overall difficulty[]\n\nThis is often considered to be the hardest song on the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of Guitar Hero III and competes for hardest song on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions with \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" from the Boss Battle Track Pack. It is almost always considered the hardest song to pass in any Guitar Hero game, along with \"Bark At The Moon\" (GH1 version due to gameplay mechanics), \"Jordan\", \"Free Bird\", \"Satch Boogie\", \"Scatterbrain (Live)\", \"Sudden Death\", \"Black Widow of La Porte\" and \"Fury of the Storm\". If DLC songs are included, then \"Through the Fire and Flames\" competes with \"Bark at the Moon\" (GH2 version, albeit easier with improved HOPO mechanics), \"Surfing with the Alien\", Operation Ground and Pound\", \"Revolution Deathsquad\", \"Heroes of our Time\", \"Dueling Banjos\".\n\nHistory of player full combos[]\n\nOn June 3rd, 2008, Chris Chike (Known as Iamchris4life) posted a video of his first full combo (FC) run of the song. It was the first recorded FC of the song. On October 1st, 2008. Baseballkid7 scored the third FC, which also was the last song he had to FC. JPrez44 has also managed to FC it, along with ggamerman. On July 15, 2009, Guitarherodude2008 also got an FC on this song. TTFAF was FCed by Chris Chike long before \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" was FCed by Danny, although this may be due to the fact that more time was devoted to TTFAF than TDWDTG: TTFAF was in the bonus setlist from the start of the game, while TDWDTG was released as DLC later on.\n\nGuitarHeroPhenom, Danny Johnson, has now FCed this song 27 times (on record). Danny made the Guinness record on February 26th, 2009, breaking Iamchris4life's 8-month streak of holding the title. Danny Johnson, Jprez44, GuitarHeroAddict112, and a few select others have recorded Full Combos of the Guitar Hero: Smash Hits version of this song.\n\nOn February 8th, 2016, DarklyinDarknessGH became the first person to FC the shortened version on Guitar Hero Live. The difficulty of the song is still incredibly high on Guitar Hero Live, even with it being the shortened 5-minute version. Nearly 3 years later, 2 days before GHTV's shut down, MarinoGaming became the 2nd ever (and the last) person to FC this version of the song on its corresponding engine.\n\nGuitarHeroPhenom, megapengproductions, FrostedGH and randyladyman are the only people to have Full Comboed the song with only one hand (without two-hand tapping). As of 21st January 2018, randyladyman is the only person to have ever Full Comboed the song while blindfolded. UKOGmonkey has also achieved a Full Combo while playing on a note size of 5%, making the notes almost impossible to see.\n\nEver since the introduction of custom songs in Guitar Hero III and Clone Hero, many of the higher skilled players prefer to play the song at a faster speed than the original song to see how well they do. UKOGmonkey became the first person to FC the Guitar Hero III version at 125% speed and since then many other higher tier players have FCed the song at 125%, while Acai28 became the first person to FC the Guitar Hero Smash Hits version at 125%. However, randyladyman made further history by becoming the first person to have Full Comboed the song at 150% speed on August 5th, 2018. On April 28, 2020, GHAddict became the first person to FC the song at 165% speed.\n\nSong Stats (Expert)[]\n\nNotes in Guitar Hero III: 3,722\n\nNotes in Guitar Hero: Smash Hits: 3,715\n\nStar Power sections: 25\n\nAverage NPS throughout the song (GH3): 8.54\n\n4 stars: 404,670 Expert\n\n296,676 Hard\n\n203,132 Medium\n\n123,504 Easy\n\n5 stars: 566,538 Expert\n\n415,347 Hard\n\n284,385 Medium\n\n172,906 Easy\n\nVideo[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMost people that try this song on any difficulty can't play the intro of the song.\n\nHerman Li, the lead guitarist for DragonForce, failed the song on Hard with 2% completion and has stated that it is impossible. Since then, dozens of people have FCed it and Danny Johnson has done so 27 times.\n\nFurthermore, in a YouTube video titled \"Can DragonForce play their own song on Expert?\" Herman Li and Sam Totman attempted a Pro Face-Off playthrough of the song, as they both play the same instrument in real life. Not even 2 seconds in and the plunks and wails of missed notes are heard. Apparently, they can't play their own song on Expert any more than most other people. Sadly, the video is no longer available to watch.\n\nAs of February 13th, 2016, there are over 60 people with a legitimate FC of this song on Guitar Hero III. The number of FCs on Guitar Hero: Smash Hits is drastically lower, with a total of 15 FCs. The number of FCs on Guitar Hero Live is the lowest, with only 2 FCs by DarklyinDarknessGH and MarinoGaming.\n\nIamchris4life was the first person to achieve a Full Combo of this song on Guitar Hero III, Danny Johnson (known as GuitarHeroPhenom) achieved the first Full Combo on Guitar Hero: Smash Hits and DarklyinDarknessGH was the first person to achieve the Full Combo on Guitar Hero Live.\n\nThis is one of only three bonus songs that does not have to be purchased in order to be played. (Along with Kings and Queens and the Joe Perry Guitar Battle)\n\nThis is also the final encore song, which is playable in the end credits. The game does not watch the player's performance in this variant, so the score tracker, Rock Meter, and Star Power Meter are absent; because of this, the player cannot fail the song. This also happens in Kings & Queens in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, Pull Me Under in Guitar Hero World Tour, 21st Century Schizoid Man in Guitar Hero 5, and American Pie in Band Hero.\n\nOn the 360 version of the game, if the song is completed on Expert, the player achieves the \"Inhuman\" achievement. This is a reference to the DragonForce's album Inhuman Rampage, in which TTFAF is the first song on the album.\n\nWhen you start up this song on Expert on either the Wii or PlayStation 2, the loading screen will always say \"Good Luck.\"\n\nThis song was FCed on Expert before it was FCed on Hard.\n\nThis is the only song contained on the original disc that the \"Now That's Impressive\" Achievement can be obtained on [achieve a score of 750,000 on a single song].\n\nIn Expert and Hard, the note difference is 999 notes. This is possibly a reference of Studio 999, which is a reference of Neversoft.\n\nThis song has 32 different sections, more than any other song in both games it appears in.\n\nThis song is the only bonus song from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II or Guitar Hero III to appear in Guitar Hero: Smash Hits (Guitar Hero Aerosmith's bonus songs were all either by Aerosmith themselves or Joe Perry).\n\nOne of the most popular YouTube videos is of a (then) 9 year old kid named Ben Eberle playing TTFAF on Expert. He holds the world record for the youngest person to get 5 stars on this song.\n\nThis song is mentioned in the final tutorial. When The God Of Rock and Lou are arguing with each other about a Guitar Battle, The God of Rock suggests going to Mt. Olympus for some \"Expert DragonForce\".\n\nThe song was originally supposed to be the final campaign song, but it was put as the end bonus song instead because of its extreme difficulty. It was replaced by \"Guitar Battle vs. Lou\", which itself would be released as DLC as \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\".\n\nThe current world record for this song on Guitar Hero III is held by UKOGmonkey with a score of 990,518.\n\nThe unofficial world record for the Guitar Hero III version of the song is currently held by randyladyman on Clone Hero, who achieved a score of 1,000,262 on January 6th, 2019. Because Clone Hero uses the overlapping Star Power mechanics from Guitar Hero World Tour and above, he was able to stack Star Power in a way that wouldn't have been possible originally in Guitar Hero III, and thus became the first person to achieve one million points on this legendary song.\n\nIt's extremely impossible to play this song on a regular XBOX/PS2 controller on Expert unless the play has skill on said controller.\n\nReferences[]\n\nSongs of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock Starting Out Small Slow Ride · Talk Dirty to Me · Hit Me With Your Best Shot · Story of My Life · Rock and Roll All Nite Your First Real Gig Mississippi Queen · School's Out · Sunshine of Your Love · Barracuda · Guitar Battle vs. Tom Morello · Bulls on Parade Making the Video When You Were Young · Miss Murder · The Seeker · Lay Down · Paint It Black European Invasion Paranoid · Anarchy in the U.K. · Kool Thing · My Name is Jonas · Even Flow Bighouse Blues Holiday in Cambodia · Rock You Like a Hurricane · Same Old Song and Dance · La Grange · Guitar Battle vs. Slash · Welcome to the Jungle The Hottest Band on Earth Black Magic Woman · Cherub Rock · Black Sunshine · The Metal · Pride and Joy Live in Japan Before I Forget · Stricken · 3's and 7's · Knights of Cydonia · Cult of Personality Battle for Your Soul Raining Blood · Cliffs of Dover · The Number of the Beast · One · Guitar Battle vs. Lou Co-op Career's encores Sabotage · Reptilia · Suck My Kiss · Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll · Helicopter · Monsters Bonus tracks Avalancha · In the Belly of a Shark · Can't Be Saved · Closer · Don't Hold Back · Down n' Dirty · F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X. · Generation Rock · Go That Far · Hier kommt Alex · I'm in the Band · Impulse · In Love · Mauvais Garcon · Metal Heavy Lady · Minus Celsius · My Curse · Nothing for Me Here · Prayer of the Refugee · Radio Song · Ruby · She Bangs the Drums · Take This Life · The Way It Ends · Through the Fire and Flames Downloadable tracks Carcinogen Crush · Tina · Putting Holes In Happiness · All My Life · The Pretender · This is a Call · She Builds Quick Machines · Slither · Messages · Tom Morello Guitar Battle · Slash Guitar Battle · The Devil Went Down To Georgia · Halo Theme MJOLNIR Mix · No More Sorrow · Sleeping Giant · Pretty Handsome Awkward · Ernten Was Wir Säen · So Payaso · Antisocial · We Three Kings · Peace of Mind · Any Way You Want It · Juke Box Hero · Dream On · Excuse Me Mr. · Don't Speak · Sunday Morning · The Arsonist · Hole in the Earth · Almost Easy · Famous for Nothing · (F)lannigan's Ball · Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ya · Nine Lives · Rock of Ages · Photograph · Top Gun Anthem · I Am Murloc · The End Begins (To Rock) · Surfing With the Alien · Supermassive Black Hole · Stockholm Syndrome · Exo-Politics · Heroes of our Time · Operation Ground and Pound · Revolution Deathsquad · That Was Just Your Life · The End of the Line · Broken, Beat & Scarred · The Day That Never Comes · Cyanide · The Judas Kiss · Suicide & Redemption · My Apocalypse Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock Companion Pack (soundtrack) Guitar Hero III Intro · Cherub Rock · 3's and 7's · Miss Murder · Slither · Kool Thing · Cult of Personality (Guitar Hero Version) · Putting Holes in Happiness (Nick Zinner Remix) · Tina · Prayer of the Refugee · The Devil Went Down to Georgia (Guitar Hero Original)\n\nSongs of Guitar Hero: Smash/Greatest Hits Amazon Rain Forest I Love Rock 'N Roll · Heart-Shaped Box · Hit Me with Your Best Shot · Rock and Roll All Nite · Take Me Out · More Than a Feeling · Stellar Grand Canyon I Wanna Rock · Woman · Them Bones · Godzilla · Lay Down · Take It Off · Killing in the Name Polar Ice Cap Round and Round · Cherry Pie · Shout at the Devil · Hey You · Unsung (Live in Chicago) · Miss Murder · Nothin' but a Good Time London Sewerage System Carry On Wayward Son · Back in the Saddle · Monkey Wrench · Mother · Message in a Bottle · Smoke on the Water · Killer Queen The Sphinx Electric Eye · Thunder Kiss '65 · Freya · Barracuda · Stop! · No One Knows · Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart The Great Wall of China Psychobilly Freakout · Cult of Personality · Cowboys from Hell (Live) · Bark at the Moon · YYZ · Laid to Rest · Free Bird The Lost City of Atlantis The Trooper · Play with Me · Caught in a Mosh · Raining Blood · Beast and the Harlot Quebec City Through the Fire and Flames GHTunes example songs Paradise Inferno · TANK'S CHOPPER · Hand of Thunder · Shred Diver · Brimstone '72 · Bar Room Blowout · Down to Dust · Walking in Glass · Luminous Giant · Pillowdrop Laser · Tower of Crimmion · Switchblade Lover · Northbound Rain · Purple Sun · Sunset '88 · Leopard Spandex · SixGun Starship · King Gonzo · Miracle's Bane · Twang Terror · Funkfectious *Setlist ordered by Band career"
