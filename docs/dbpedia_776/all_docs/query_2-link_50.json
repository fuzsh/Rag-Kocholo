The Cherokee Fire Department responded and had the fire knocked down within about two hours. Most of the interior furnishings were destroyed by smoke, water or fire, and the building itself - a mobile home with additions - is said to be a total loss (value not yet determined). The cause of the fire is unknown and is being investigated by park rangers Hobbs and Holland, who may be assisted by Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).\n\nJune 12, 1987\n\n87-98 - Great Smokies - Suicide\n\nMr. T.L. was found dead in his van. A flexible hose ran from the exhaust into the passenger compartment of the van.\n\nJune 26, 1987\n\n87-39 - Great Smokies - Field Incident Update\n\nA fire destroyed the home of the director of the Job Corps Center. The cause was not known. Update: The investigation is on-going, and the cause is still not certain.\n\nJuly 14, 1987\n\n87-157 - Great Smokies - Drug Interdiction\n\nLocation: Foothills Parkway\n\nAs a result of an overflight by Tennessee state drug agents, a patch of marijuana was found along the parkway. Investigation revealed that 148 plants, each about 8 feet tall, were being cultivated in the plot. Chief ranger Pete Hart and his staff removed and destroyed the plants. There were no arrests and there are no suspects.\n\nJuly 17, 1987\n\n87-161 - Great Smokies - Marijuana Eradication\n\nLocation: Hickory Flats, Deep Creek Area\n\nA \"fly-over\" done by Swains County Sheriff's Office revealed a marijuana patch which was growing near Lands Creek. NPS and County Deputies eradicated 944 plants approximately 6 feet in height. All were turned over to Swains County authorities. No suspects, no arrests.\n\nJuly 22, 1987\n\n87-165 - Great Smokies - Fatality: Motor Vehicle Accident\n\nLocation: Route 41\n\nB.K.K. was speeding on his motorcycle on a spur off Route 41 when he lost control and hit a bridge abutment.

Last evening when he did not return home his wife notified park personnel. A search was initiated at approximately 7:30pm which involved NPS rangers, state agencies, and local Emergency Services groups. At approximately 11:06pm A.N.M.'s body was found in a deep pool of water 200 yards south of the Husky Grove Branch. Cause of death has not been determined. No evidence of foul play has been found. A joint investigation is being conducted by NPS park personnel along with Sevire County officials.\n\nJanuary 11, 1988\n\n88-5 - Great Smokies - Suicide\n\nLocation: Cades Cove\n\nFour skiers discovered R.B.W.'s body lying in the snow about 200 yards from a pickup truck parked on the Cades Cove loop road. Evidence at the scene indicated that he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Subsequent investigation revealed that R.B.W. had left home at 10:30 that morning following an argument with his spouse, and that he and his wife had a history of marital problems.\n\nMarch 17, 1988\n\n88-38 - Great Smoky Mountains - Search and Rescue\n\nLocation: Thomas Divide Trail\n\nOn March 14th, a Boy Scout troop on an overnight backcountry trip encountered 5 degree temperatures and snow, for which they were unprepared. On the 15th, J.H. began exhibiting symptoms of hypothermia and was unable to continue. One leader and the majority of the group continued on to obtain assistance; the second leader, who was an EMT, remained with J.H.. The group seeking assistance became lost and spent the night of the 15th on the trail. They finally reached a ranger station at 8:30 am on the 16th. Rangers responded and reached J.H. and the remainder of the group about noon. J.H. was transported to the Swain County (NC) Hospital, where he was placed in intensive care with a body core temperature of about 92 degrees. J.H. was reported to be in satisfactory condition on the 17th and was to be released.\n\nMay 4, 1988\n\n88-70 - Great Smoky Mtns. - Suicide\n\nLocation: Sugarlands Trailhead\n\nThe Jefferson County, Louisiana, Sheriffs Office advised park staff that W.L.P. had sent his wife a suicide letter from nearby Bryson City, NC and might be in the park. A short time after receiving the report, W.L.P.'s vehicle was found at the Sugerlands Mountain Trail trailhead; his body a short distance away surrounded by a large variety of empty pill containers. The labels on the containers indicated that W.L.P., a pharmacist, had issued the prescriptions to himself.\n\nJune 16, 1988\n\n88-106 - Great Smokies - Assault on Non-Federal, Officer\n\nLocation: Little River Road\n\nRanger Kirk Tranchita attempted to stop a vehicle which was weaving down Little River Road, but the driver refused to pull over. Tranchita radioed for assistance; since no NPS unit was available, Officer Ron Suttles of Townsend PD provided backup. Suttles attempted to intercept the car Tranchita was pursuing by placing his cruiser across the road at an intersection known as \"Townsend Y\", which is about one mile inside the park boundary. Suttles stood next to the cruiser and signaled the car to stop, but the driver continued on, hitting the officer. Suttles was able to fire a single shot at his assailants; it penetrated both the rear and front windows of the car, but hit neither of the occupants. Suttles was not badly injured. The car was later stopped by Blount County officers. The two occupants were placed under arrest on a wide variety of charges, including assault, driving on a revoked license, and driving under the influence (DUI). Both men had prior convictions for DUI.\n\nJuly 5, 1988\n\n88-126 - Great Smoky Mtns. - Drug Seizure\n\nLocation: Tobes Creek\n\nPark rangers and state of Tennessee drug enforcement agents discovered a plot of marijuana growing 1/2 mile inside the park near State Rt. 32. The plot, in the Tobes Creek - Cosby area, contained 811, three to four foot plants. The plants were destroyed. There are no suspects at this time and no arrests have been made as Rangers were unable to set up surveillance on the plot due to lack of manpower.\n\nAugust 4, 1988\n\n88-168 - Great Smoky Mountain - Fatal Fall/Helicopter Accident\n\nLocation: Charlies Bunion\n\nOn August 3, at about 11 am, T.R., 15, of Utica, Michigan, fell 500 feet to his death from Charlies Bunion Overlook in the park. T.R. had been attempting to jump from rock to rock at the overlook when the fall occurred. Rangers, upon notification, requested the U.S. Army MAST helicopter from Fort (Campbell, Kentucky to assist as it was believed that T.R. might still be alive. Efforts to reach the victim were hampered by loose rock and a severe thunderstorm with heavy rain. Park medics reached T.R. at about 4:30 pm and found that he had not survived. Body removal was delayed until this morning due to weather conditions.\n\nGiven the weather conditions at the scene, the Army helicopter was unable to assist with the removal of the victim and flew to the Sevier County airport near Gatlinburg to refuel. The aircraft landed and taxied to the fuel pumps where the main rotor struck a sign post flipping the helicopter. The six persons aboard, including ranger Bobby Holland were all injured. Holland assisted in removing three members of the Army crew. Two members of the crew were flown by Lifestar to the University of Tennessee Hospital in Knoxville. The remaining crew and Holland were transported to the Sevier County Hospital for treatment. Holland sustained head injuries, cracked ribs and cracked vertebrae. All the injured are currently in stable condition.\n\nFriday, January 6, 1989\n\n89-1 - Great Smokies - Homicide Conviction\n\nOn December 29, 1984, a family of hikers came upon skeletal remains near the loop road in Cade's Cove. The subsequent investigation by park rangers and FBI agents revealed that the victim was R.G. of Memphis, Tennessee, and that she had been murdered. The primary suspect was W.H., a convicted bank robber who was on the FBI's \"Ten Most Wanted\" list and who was being sought for parole violations, rape and social security fraud. Efforts to find him proved fruitless. Last September 4th, the television show \"America's Most Wanted\" aired a show on the case which they had filmed on location in the park. As a result, W.H. was spotted in Perlington, Mississippi, and the FBI arrested him and his wife there on social security fraud charges on December 19th. During subsequent interrogations, W.H. confessed to the murder of R.G.. He said that R.G. had become friends with the W.H. family when all three were hiking in the park on September 26, 1984. Following a trip to town to drop off W.H.'s wife, W.H. and R.G. had returned to the park, consumed alcohol, marijuana and psilocybin, then engaged in sexual relations; during their tryst, R.G. became angry at W.H. and he strangled her in the ensuing fight. On January 5th, W.H. pled guilty to second degree murder and will likely be sentenced to 60 years in prison. (Pete Hart, Great Smokies).\n\nWednesday, April 26, 1989\n\n89-77 - Great Smokies - Bomb Threat\n\nA young man called the Oconaluftee ranger office at 9 a.m. on the 17th to report that a bomb had been placed in a park building and was set to go off. The park immediately initiated a standard bomb search of park buildings and evacuated the visitor centers and major office buildings. About a half hour later, the man called again and said that the detonation time was set for just after 11 a.m. No bomb was found. FBI offices in both North Carolina and Tennessee are investigating the incident. (Bob Marriott, GRSM).\n\nThursday, April 27, 1989\n\n89-78 - Great Smokies - Burglaries\n\nOn the evening of March 18th, park dispatchers received a report of burglaries in the Wonderland Club complex. The responding ranger checked one of the club's cabins and found that it had been burglarized and that two people had stayed overnight in the cabin for one or two nights. Since it was likely that the suspects were still in the area, the ranger called for a backup; when the second ranger arrived, a full check of all the remaining buildings in the complex was begun. Evidence of forcible entry or attempted entry was found on another nine cabins and the Wonderland Club Hotel. An investigation was begun to gain evidence and determine whether any items had been stolen. While the investigation was underway, a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) officer confronted two young men who were in the process of burglarizing a store near Douglas Dam. One of the two men fired a shotgun at the officer, but missed him. The two were arrested and confessed to having spent time in the park, and evidence gathered by the rangers tentatively identified them as the persons who'd broken into the Wonderland buildings. The two men were subsequently identified as B.J.Z., 19, and J.E.C., 18, both of Jeffersonville, Indiana. They confessed to having been in the area for four days, and said that they had come from Indiana in an attempt to flee from pending charges of grave robbing in New Albany, Indiana. The two were charged by Sevier County and TVA with felonious assault with intent to murder a police officer, possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of stolen property, grand larceny and third degree burglary; the park will also file burglary charges against the two men. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM).\n\nWednesday, May 10, 1989\n\n89-87 - Great Smokies - Rescue of Hiker\n\nOn the morning of May 6th, H.K., 23, of Concord, Massachusetts, was hiking two miles south of Clingman's Dome when lightning struck a nearby spruce tree, passed through the ground and knocked her over. H.K. suffered a head injury in the fall. Fellow hikers carried her to a nearby shelter, then summoned help. A 20-person rescue team comprised of rangers and members of a local rescue squad carried her out because severe weather precluded air evacuation. H.K. was taken to the Sevier County medical center, where she was treated and later released. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, through Steve Smith, RAD/SERO).\n\nWednesday, June 7, 1989\n\n89-120 - Great Smokies - Fatality\n\nJust before 11 p.m. on the night of the 5th, 19-year-old K.R. of Piney Flats, Tennessee, was riding in the passenger seat of a pickup truck on the Gatlinburg spur of the Foothills Parkway when the truck swerved and hit a rock outcropping. K.R., who had been leaning out the window, was killed immediately. The driver drove all the way through Gatlinburg with the victim hanging from the window before stopping to call for assistance. He has been charged with driving under the influence and unsafe operation of a motor vehicle; charges of vehicular homicide are pending. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via phone report from RAD/SERO).\n\nTuesday, June 20, 1989\n\n89-141 - Great Smokies - Shooting of Job Corps Employee\n\nOn the afternoon of the 16th, 21-year-old A.M. was walking with friends from the town of Cherokee on the park's east border to the Job Corps Center at Oconoluftee when someone in a residence along the way fired a .22 caliber pistol at A.M. and struck him in the left thigh. A.M. was admitted to the Swain County Hospital and is in satisfactory condition. The suspect is at large, and is being sought by the Cherokee Police Department. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via telephone report from RAD/SERO).\n\nThursday, June 22, 1989\n\n89-147 - Great Smokies - Armed Robbery\n\nAt 5:30 p.m. on the 20th, D.E., 66, of Trenton, Ohio, was in a restroom at Newfound Gap when a \"scruffy\" male approached him, pointed a small automatic pistol at him, and demanded D.E.'s wallet, when D.E. replied that he didn't have one, the suspect cocked his weapon and said he wanted cash. D.E. gave the suspect a credit card case which held his cards and $20. The suspect then fled in a blue Chevy Impala sedan driven by a female accomplice. Rangers are investigating. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via telephone report from Steve Smith, RAD/SERO).\n\nMonday, July 3, 1989\n\n89-164 - Great Smokies - Arson\n\nJust before midnight on the 28th, the line to a diesel fuel storage tank in the Occonoluftee Job Corps Center was cut and the leaking fuel was ignited. The subsequent fire scorched several trees, but did no other damage. Following an investigation by park rangers, three Job Corps employees - B.H., 18, J.C., 18 and a juvenile - were arrested and charged with arson. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via phone report from Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO).\n\nFriday, July 7, 1989\n\n89-175 - Great Smokies - Fatality Caused by Falling Tree\n\nOn the afternoon of July 5th, a vehicle heading north on US 441 near the visitor center at Oconaluftee was hit by 10-inch diameter tree which fell without warning. The driver, 40-year-old R.A. of Saraland, Alabama, was killed when a limb ripped through the top of his car; his passenger, 29-year-old C.S., was slightly injured. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via CompuServe message from Bill Sturgeon, RAD/SERO).\n\nThursday, July 13, 1989\n\n89-181 - Great Smokies - Aircraft Crash\n\nA Cessna 172 piloted by 38-year-old P.H. of Dayton, Ohio, crashed near the Appalachian Trail at Cold Spring Knob on the afternoon of the 11th. A Boy Scout troop from Alexandria, Virginia, witnessed the crash; the leader, an EMT, went to the scene of the accident, while the scouts returned to Derrick Knob shelter and reported the incident to a park trail crew. The victim suffered a separated shoulder, broken leg and head injuries. An Army helicopter was employed to fly park medics to the Derrick Knob shelter. Hughes was stabilized, carried to the shelter, then medevaced to the University of Tennessee Medical Center, where he is in guarded condition. During the evening of the 11th, the FAA in Dayton, Ohio, received an anonymous phone call stating that there were drugs aboard P.H.'s aircraft. The park is currently investigating that possibility. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via telefax from RAD/SERO).\n\nWednesday, August 9, 1989\n\n89-216 - Great Smokies - Marijuana Eradication\n\nOn the afternoon of August 7th, rangers in the Cosby Subdistrict destroyed 22 marijuana plants ranging in height from four to six feet and valued at $22,000. The plants had been under surveillance for about two months. There are no suspects, and no arrests have been made. (Don Utterback, SDR, GRSM, via telephone report from Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO).\n\nWednesday, August 30, 1989\n\n89-253 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Marijuana Eradication\n\nOn the afternoon of the 26th, rangers from Cosby Subdistrict raided a marijuana garden located within the park and eradicated 33 six-foot plants valued at $82,000. Several containers of an unknown substance, probably fertilizer, were also found in the area and have been sent out for analysis. The garden's location was revealed by an anonymous tipster. (CompuServe message from Pete Hart, CR, GRSM to RAD/SERO and RAD/WASO).\n\nWednesday, August 30, 1989\n\n89-254 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Car Clouting Arrests\n\nOn August 27th, rangers arrested a man and woman who were suspects in a recent car clout (break-in) in the park. Upon further investigation, evidence was found which linked the pair to a number of other car clouts in the park and surrounding areas in North Carolina and Tennessee. The couple had a small child with them at the time of their arrest. Among the items recovered from their van were a .44 derringer, believed to be stolen, and several items which had been taken from a vehicle that had been broken into in the park. (CompuServe message from Pete Hart, CR, GRSM to RAD/SERO and RAD/WASO).\n\nThursday, September 21, 1989\n\n89-286 - Great Smokies (Tennessee) - Car Clouting Arrest\n\nOn the afternoon of September 8th, a passing ranger observed two suspicious adult males in the Laurel Falls parking lot, the scene of a number of car clouts (auto break-ins). He began a stakeout, and saw the two look into several cars and loiter near the trailhead over the next 35 minutes. Their actions convinced the ranger that a car clouting was imminent, so he called for and received a backup. Shortly thereafter, one of the two men took a position where he could watch the road while the other opened the rear window of a mini-van and reached in with his arm. The two - later identified as J.P.M. and S.C.B. - were then arrested. Subsequent investigation revealed that they were using two vehicles, that each of them contained items from a larceny committed in the same parking area on August 23rd, and that one vehicle contained travelers checks stolen from Indiana on August 27th. It was also learned that S.C.B. was out of jail on bond for a similar offense committed in Florida. The vehicles employed were a dark blue 1978 Chevy van (Florida GPW-14Y) and a green 1976 two-door Ford LTD (Kentucky ACT-474). (CompuServe message from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO).\n\nThursday, September 21, 1989\n\n89-287 - Great Smokies (Tennessee) - Successful Search\n\nOn the afternoon of the 16th, six-year-old S.J. of Waynesville, North Carolina, disappeared from his home near Hempill Creek, just a mile outside of the park. S.J. was apparently with his two dogs and was reported to be barefoot and wearing only a T-shirt and jeans. Local authorities began a search, which continued throughout the 17th. Park rangers heard of the search indirectly, volunteered to assist, and put four trackers and a dog on the boy's trail. They soon found footprints and found S.J. around 5:30 p.m. at a point in the park about 300 yards from the Cataloochee Divide trail - about 10 to 11 miles from the point last seen. S.J. had spent the night sleeping in a hollow log; he'd used a covering of leaves and his two dogs for warmth. (Telephone report from Steve Smith, RAD/SERO).\n\nMonday, September 25, 1989\n\n89-289 - Eastern Areas - Hurricane Hugo\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the impacts of Hurricane Hugo on several eastern parks as of Friday afternoon:\n\n- Great Smoky Mountains - The park received about four inches of rain early on Friday morning. Water in local streams and rivers was reported to be rising over both bridges and highways. Several picnic areas were closed.\n\nMonday, October 2, 1989\n\n89-299 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Bear Mauling\n\nOn the evening of the 28th, P.M., 43, and her husband J.M., both of Blanchester, Ohio, were picnicking in the Chimneys Picnic Area when a black bear approached them. They withdrew to their van until the bear appeared to wander off, then got back out again. P.M. walked down to a river and squatted down to pick up some rocks. She heard a noise behind her and turned to find a bear about ten feet away. As she stood, the bear charged her. She attempted to run, but fell. The bear grabbed her on the back of the neck with his teeth and began shaking her. P.M. screamed for help; her husband and another visitor went after the bear with rocks and sticks and chased him off. P.M. was taken to an area hospital, where she is being treated for a fractured scapula and scratches and puncture wounds on her back and neck. The bear, known to park rangers as Bear #79, was caught and locked up. Bear #79 is six years old, weighs 200 pounds, and has a history of aggressive behavior. He was captured and released elsewhere in the park on June 18th, then again on August 12th. The picnic area, which is in the midst of prime bear habitat, has been the scene of considerable bear activity and visitor feeding of bears over the past few years. The future disposition of Bear #79 is undecided at present; the possibility of distant relocation is complicated by the local county commission, which refuses to let the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency remove bears from the county. Because of the bear's history, there is a high degree of local media interest in the incident and in the park's bear management policies. (Telephone report from Steve Smith, RAD/SERO; CompuServe message from Pete Hart, CR, GRSM).\n\nFriday, October 6, 1989\n\n89-299 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Follow-up on Bear Mauling\n\nBear #79, the black bear which attached and injured P.M. on September 28th, was destroyed on the 29th. (Telephone report from Steve Smith, RAD/SERO).\n\nTuesday, October 10, 1989\n\n89-311 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Drug Arrests\n\nLate on the evening of the 29th, two rangers came upon a Lincoln in the Sugarlands Visitor Center parking lot. No one was inside, but the rangers could see open containers of alcohol and the remains what appeared to be marijuana joints in the car. A man and woman, each aged 20, soon appeared and admitted that the car was theirs. During questioning, the man escaped into the woods; despite assistance from local police during the subsequent search, he was able to escape. It was soon learned that there was a warrant outstanding for the man for aggravated assault with a lead pipe, bail jumping and destruction of county property. The woman was arrested and charged with underage possession of alcohol and possession of a controlled substance. The Lincoln was impounded. The man will be charged under Title 21 and the US Attorney is considering seizure of the car because evidence discovered in the inventory of the vehicle indicated that the subject is probably a dealer. (CompuServe message from Bob Marriott, GRSM).\n\nWednesday, October 18, 1989\n\n89-323 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Fatality\n\nOn the night of October 15th, the B. family of Zachary, Louisiana, camped in Balsam Mountain Campground. When they checked their sleeping baby, nine-month-old D.B., at 11 a.m., they found that he was not breathing. CPR was begun and continued by a park medic who was summoned to the scene. Despite their efforts, the boy died. The cause of the death is thought to be SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). (Telephone report from Bill Springer, RAD/SERO).\n\nFriday, November 17, 1989\n\n89-335 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Car Clouting Arrests\n\nDuring the month of October, a series of car clouts (break-ins) occurred in the park. Although stakeouts were conducted throughout the month, rangers were not able to catch the thieves. A breakthrough occurred, however, through the work of Little River Subdistrict Ranger Bill Acree, who has investigated and tracked many of the car clouts which have occurred in the park. Acree noted similar elements in a number of the break-ins, and recognized them as typical of the car clouts once committed in the park by B.J.P., 46, of Conyer, Georgia. B.J.P. had been charged with and convicted of eight counts of larceny in the park. A records check revealed that he had been released from jail in June, that he had jumped parole on October 10th, and that he was driving a stolen car. A description of the vehicle and its license number were provided to rangers on November 8th; on the morning of November 12th, Ranger Pete Walzer spotted B.J.P. and a companion, R.G., in the park. Both B.J.P. and R.G., who was on parole for a misdemeanor, were arrested. During a search of the vehicle, rangers found a loaded .38 double derringer on the car's console and a large number of stolen credit cards and other items. At least 22 different names have since been found on the credit cards. B.J.P. has been linked with 15 car clouts in Great Smokies, and will likely be linked to several more in and out of the park before the investigation is concluded. B.J.P. is currently incarcerated. He is known to have conducted car clouts in Athens, Georgia, and in Gatlinburg, Knoxville and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Following his first arrest, B.J.P. consented to a videotaped interview on his experience with car clouting, and he will probably be doing a second videotape in the near future. These tapes will be available for park training programs. Contact Bill Acree (615-436-1268, FTS 854-1268) for further information. (Pete Hart, CR, GRSM, via CompuServe report to RAD/SERO and RAD/WASO).\n\nThursday, December 14, 1989\n\n88-269 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Follow-up on Assault on Rangers\n\nLate on the afternoon of November 18, 1988, rangers Rick Yates and David Little were assaulted by a trio of hunters while in pursuit of a poacher. The two rangers were forced to draw their weapons when one of the three men, later identified as T.L.B., Jr., pulled a knife. T.L.B. then fled the area, but took a .243 semi-automatic rifle from his truck and pointed it at the rangers before leaving. After a month-long investigation, T.L.B. and the other assailants were identified and a case was filed against them with the U.S. Attorney in Knoxville. Last June 22nd, T.L.B. was indicted on three counts of assaulting and impeding Federal officers. On December 11th, T.L.B. was convicted of two felony counts of assaulting a Federal officer and sentenced to four months in prison and one year of supervised probation and fined $1,000.

Ranger and EMT Dave Little arrived at the shelter shortly thereafter and found a 25-year-old man semi-conscious, weak and dehydrated. The man was a diabetic, who had administered a smaller dose of insulin than normal, causing his blood sugar levels to fluctuate significantly. Ranger and Park Medic Rick Obernesser arrived before noon and administered intravenous fluids under the direction of a local doctor. Because driving sleet, rain and limited visibility precluded helicopter evacuation, a dozen rangers carried the ailing hiker out to the nearest service road, where he was transported to a Tennessee hospital. He is now in the hospital's intensive care unit. The park reports that the initial treatment of the patient by a doctor-directed EMS person was \"instrumental\" in saving Hardy's life. (CompuServe report from Bob Marriott, LES, GRSM, 1:30 p.m. EST, 1/3/90).\n\nMonday, January 22, 1990\n\n90-14 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Search\n\nOn January 13th, the park received a phone call from the wife of a 34-year-old Georgia man, saying that she'd received a letter from her husband bearing a Knoxville postmark which stated that he planned to commit suicide \"in a high place.\" He was identified as a man who rangers had previously contacted for illegal camping and had transported to Elkmont Campground. The park issued an alert, impounded his vehicle, and searched it. The search turned up an additional suicide note, a map with several of the park's highest areas circled, an empty case for a long gun and equipment used to load cap and ball pistols. A call to the man's wife revealed that he'd left his rifle at home, but that he was apparently in possession of a muzzle-loading pistol. The man was no longer at the campy round, so a dog was employed to search trails radiating from Elkmont. At the same time, the park's high points were checked, during which a ranger came upon the man on the Little River Trail. He'd apparently taken a quantity of over-the-counter medication and suffered a fall while hiking. He did not have the pistol. He was led from the area and kept in custody until his wife arrived and took him home.

Investigation revealed that a student at the center had been loan sharking and had been having difficulty collecting from another student. When collection day came, the student was only able to pay back $5 of the loan; the loan shark took the money, then punched the student in the face. The center staff brought the two together for a conference. After discussing the matter, the victim drew a concealed knife and attempted to attack the student loan shark. The attacker was subdued by center staff and arrested by rangers. He will be charged with assault with a. deadly weapon. Investigation is continuing into the loan sharking.

The rangers had not seen either vehicle being operated prior to the contact. Investigation revealed that only one of the persons in the two cars had a valid operator's license and that all persons in the two vehicles were related by marriage. They were ordered to leave the area in one car, which was to be driven by the licensed driver. One of the rangers left the campground area and waited a distance down the access road. Shortly thereafter, he saw both cars leaving the area and pulled behind them. Both immediately increased their speed. Rather than risk a chase on the winding road, the ranger continued to follow at a normal speed. Near the end of the access road, he found one of the vehicles had had an accident and overturned; all four passengers had been ejected. The second vehicle fled the area. Subsequent investigation disclosed that both vehicles had been involved in the accident. The licensed driver, a 22-year-old female, was evacuated with head injuries, and died later that night. The investigation into the incident is continuing.

Before throwing it onto the truck, they looked inside to determine the contents and found five sticks of dynamite, some fuse cord, and a one-quart, unmarked paint can with unknown contents. Rangers were called to the scene, the overlook was cordoned off, and the Knoxville PD explosives unit was summoned to the scene. A member of that unit examined the contents of the bag and determined that the explosive was gelcoate, a type of dynamite that is somewhat more stable than older types because it contains no nitroglycerine. The fuse was not connected to the explosives, and no blasting caps were found. The paint can was blown open remotely using explosive cord and was found to contain soil, fine gravel and other debris. The bag also contained the empty paper wrappers for 19 other sticks of gelcoate. The explosives were disposed of on-site by soaking them with diesel fuel and burning them. No bomb threats of any kind were received in the park, and there is no information available at this time on how the material came to be there. Investigators are now trying to determine the source of the explosives.

Rangers had received information that two drug dealers were to arrive from Atlanta to sell marijuana to Corpsmen on pay day and staked out the location where the transaction was to take place. The dealers arrived as planned and sold a Corpsman $200 worth of marijuana in twenty small packages. Two other Corpsmen then approached and purchased some of these packages. When the rangers moved in to make the arrest, the dealers fled the scene in their vehicle. They committed numerous traffic violations in their attempts to get away, but were stopped and arrested in nearby Cherokee, North Carolina. A drug-sniffing dog was brought in from the Swain County Sheriff's Office to search the car, and discovered another 26 packages of marijuana. The drugs, some cash, and the car were seized. The two men (one of whom is a minor) will be charged under 21 USC, and two Corpsmen will probably be charged at a later date. The investigation is continuing. (Bob Marriott, Acting CR, GRSM, via CompuServe messages to RAD/SERO and RAD/WASO, 4:30 EST, 3/19/90).\n\nThursday, March 22, 1990\n\n90-43 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Incidents at Job Corps Center\n\nJust after midnight on March 19th, the spouse of a Job Corps employee whose residence is near the center called a ranger at home and reported that a Corpsman was at her house and that he was requesting the immediate assistance of a ranger. Two park rangers responded, met the Corpsman and took him back to the Job Corps Center. An interview with him revealed that a group of Corpsman had been conducting an initiation and had in the process threatened other Corpsmen. The latter left the center, recruited their own group, and confronted the original group. During that confrontation, the complainant was chased from the center. The groups were wearing colored headbands and employed gang terminology, but the park reports that no determination has yet been made as to whether actual gang activity is occurring in the center. The center staff remained on duty throughout the rest of the night, but no further incidents occurred. At 11 p.m. that evening, however, rangers were again called to the center. They found that two juvenile and one adult Corpsmen had been beaten, and that one of the juveniles was seriously injured. An investigation into the two incidents is being conducted, but there presently appears to be no connection among these incidents and the drug arrests reported yesterday.

One of the dealers, 19-year-old T.A. of Newnan, Georgia, has been charged under 21 USC with 14 felony counts related to the distribution of controlled substances, including distribution of a controlled substance on or near a school (21 USC 845 [a]) and distribution to a person under 21 years of age (21 USC 845). One of the charges stems from an offense committed on March 2nd, evidence of which was gained during the investigation. Arnold remains in jail under a $10,000 secured bond. The juvenile dealer has been charged with five felony distribution counts. He had been released to his parents under a $5,000 unsecured bond. The investigation also resulted in the apprehension of five corpsmen who purchased marijuana. If they continue to cooperate in the investigation, charges will probably not be filed against them.

The right rear passenger, 22-year-old W.T., was killed. The driver, J.T., 18, suffered a depressed skull fracture and was flown by Lifestar helicopter to St. Mary's Medical Center in Knoxville. He is in critical condition. Two of the three remaining passengers, B.R., 20, and D.W., 14, were treated and released; the third, A.W., 20, remains hospitalized with a broken collar bone, broken shoulder and possible bruised kidney. All five were from Sevierville, Tennessee. It is believed that the vehicle was travelling at a high rate of speed when it went off the road, and investigators are looking into the possible involvement of alcohol. Charges are pending.

The driver of the vehicle in which the two were riding pulled a knife and stabbed the victim two or three times. One wound penetrated the victim's neck and caused extensive bleeding. The assailant took the victim to a North Carolina hospital. The attack was not reported to rangers until two days later, when the victim was released from the hospital. An investigation is being conducted by rangers.

They reportedly descended 60 vertical feet at the cave's entrance, walked 400 feet, then descended 45 vertical feet to a ledge and another 70 vertical feet from there to a point below, where they ran out of rope. At about 2:30 p.m., the pair started climbing back out. After an hour's effort, J.E.M. told T.M. that his legs were numb and he could not climb any further. T.M. completed the climb and called for help. The park called a cave rescue team from the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad for assistance. J.E.M. was reached just after 8 p.m., evacuated, then transported by ambulance and helicopter to the University of Tennessee Hospital in Knoxville. He suffered from hypothermia, but had no other injuries. Neither climber had obtained the required permit to enter the cave, and legal action is under consideration.

The caller had left the Appalachian Trail to hike cross-country to Wilson Falls, and had become lost while trying to return to his car on the Clingman's Dome road. Since he was in possession of a cellular phone, he called the park to find out how to get back. He was advised to continue uphill until he encountered either the Appalachian Trail or the Dome Road. He then hung up to save battery power. Just after noon, he called back to say that he'd found the trail and was headed out. (CompuServe message to RAD/SERO and RAD/WASO from Bob Wightman, GRSM, 5:30 p.m. EDT, 5/30).\n\nTuesday, June 26, 1990\n\n90-156 - Great Smoky Mountains (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Lightning Victim\n\nAround 10 p.m. on June 18th, a lightning bolt struck A.M. of Berea, Kentucky, at his backcountry campsite on a ridgetop near the state line and about three miles off the Appalachian Trail. Other campers at the site hiked off the mountain and reported the incident to rangers at the Abrams Creek ranger station a little after 1 a.m. Cades Cove rangers responded and reached the victim at 5 a.m. He was coherent and had a strong pulse, but had some localized burns and was experiencing same abdominal pain. He felt able to ride out, so evacuation by horse was begun around 7 a.m. A.M.'s companions drove him to a nearby hospital. A.M. told rangers that he was lying on a foam sleeping pad and reading at the time of the strike. For 10 to 15 seconds, he felt \"welded to the ground\", and could not move for some time thereafter, as he was paralyzed on his left side and right leg. He observed smoke in his tent, saw bits of down floating around, and smelled burned hair and flesh. It took about 20 minutes before others heard him yelling for help through the noise of the storm, and by that time he had begun regaining some feeling. Rangers found no signs of damage to the sleeping pad, but the tent floor looked \"shot full of holes\", with several quarter to half-dollar-sized burn holes. A tree about ten feet away had its bark blown off. A.M. said that he'd been shocked by a 220 volt charge before, but that this was much worse; he felt that any more would have killed him. His lower back and leg muscles were extremely sore, and the pain in his stomach was reported to be similar to that caused by a hernia.

R.C. went over the bike's handlebar, hit his head on the ground and was killed. (Telephone report from RAD/SERO, 7/2).\n\nWednesday, August 1, 1990\n\n90-214 - Great Smoky Mountains (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Arrest\n\nOn July 29th, rangers arrested 27-year-old T.L.G. of Huntsville, Alabama, after observing him burglarize a car in the Rainbow Falls area near Gatlinburg. Rangers had the area under surveillance after receiving reports of 15 similar incidents at nearby tourist attractions earlier in the weekend. Approximately $500 in cash and jewelry were recovered. (CompuServe message from Jason Houck, CR, GRSM, 7/31).\n\nFriday, August 3, 1990\n\n90-227 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Weapons Arrest\n\nOn the evening of July 29th, Alan Householder, a backcountry volunteer whose position is jointly funded by the Appalachian Trail Conference, a local hiking club, and the park's cooperating association, was on routine patrol along the Appalachian Trail at Icewater Springs when he saw a man with a .22 magnum rifle. Householder followed instructions he'd received in training and took no immediate action; once alone, he reported his observation to backcountry rangers by radio. Two rangers responded at dawn the next morning and found 26-year-old R.D. of Eustis, Florida, camped illegally along the trail about a mile and a half east of Newfound Gap. R.D. said his intent was to camp for about two months in the park. He was carrying a rifle, 200 rounds of ammunition, a samurai sword, two large knives, two hatchets, a climbing rope, ten pounds of potatoes, a bag of rice, a bag of garden seeds, and books on survival and edible plants. He said he intended to kill small game, but would not kill bear or deer. He was arrested, charged with hunting, and is now out on $1,000 bond.

Guyot along the Appalachian Trail. The scout leader reported that a second leader, 51-year-old J.G. of Albany, Mississippi, was suffering from acute chest pains radiating out into his arms, was sweating and nauseous, and had a history of high blood pressure. Ranger George Minnigh arrived on scene by horseback at 7 p.m., transmitted preliminary vital signs to the park's medical control, and began to administer oxygen. Park Medic Steve Kloster arrived on scene at 8:15 p.m. and began administering sublingual nitroglycerine on radioed advice from a doctor. The two rangers then put J.G. on horseback and began down; they met the park litter team, who carried him to the trailhead, arriving at that point at 1:30 a.m. J.G. was taken by ambulance to Sevier County Medical Center where he is now in an ICU in stable condition. Virtually the entire rescue was conducted during heavy rains and occasional thunderstorms. Visibility was nil, precluding use of a helicopter at any point.

Just before 3 p.m., they saw three men - R.W., 20, M.H., 19, and T.H., 20, all of Robbinsville, North Carolina - leaving the park from that area. Two of the men fled when the rangers attempted to stop them, but all were eventually captured. The trio had a total of 1,138 ginseng roots from the park in their possession. The roots, which collectively weighed just over 13 pounds, have a street value of between $1,200 and $1,500. All were charged with several violations of CFR and may be charged under the Lacey Act (18 USC 3372). (CompuServe message from Jason Houck, CR, GRSM, 9/17).\n\nTuesday, October 9, 1990\n\n90-359 - Great Smoky Mountains National Park (North Carolina- Tennessee) - Hunting Case\n\nOn Friday evening, September 28, two-person teams of rangers were staked out at three separate locations on the North Carolina side of the Park. In addition, two officers with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission were in position to serve as backup. The team watching the Thomas Divide area, at which an unofficial trail entered the Park, observed two men with a weapon and several dogs enter the Park at approx. 2200 hours. Rangers jumped the men but they escaped. The stakeout team notified the others and called in one other team, a supervisor and the two North Carolina officers. Acting on a hunch they subsequently found two Jeep pickups parked outside the Park and initiated a stakeout at their location. While in position they heard a dog race and two shotgun blasts from inside the Park. They also caught three dogs which returned to the Jeeps.\n\nAt approx. 0400 hours, September 29, two men approached the Jeeps and deposited assorted bear parts in a dog box. Rangers stopped them as they started the vehicles and attempted to leave. They were NOT the same two men jumped the night before. At daylight two rangers and a North Carolina officer began backtracking the suspects. Approx. 1 1/4 mile from the Jeeps and inside the Park, they located a gut pile, the head of a bear and the upper torso of a second bear. Another team began tracking at the point of contact from the night before and located a .22 cal. rifle and a knife. All evidence was seized and the vehicles confiscated. On Sunday, September 30, rangers backtracked from the gut pile and found a second gut pile, another bear head and additional evidence within 250 yards.\n\nA shotgun was used to first shoot the bears but has not been recovered. An informant has identified two other men involved in this hunt. Rangers have a suspect for one of the two who escaped capture-they were apparently involved in a separate hunt. The two men at the Jeeps were Sherman Ogle, DOB 1/18/48, of Bryson City, NC and William Paul Owl, DOB 12/20/33, an Indian from Cherokee, NC. No arrests were made but they were escorted home and their blood soaked clothing confiscated.\n\nThe bear skulls have been radiographed. One skull contained four .22 cal. bullets. A .22 cal. pistol was also found in one of the Jeeps. The Park is considering charges under the Lacey Act. The State is considering charges for hunting out of season, hunting without a license and wastage. Both bears were females. If they are found to have been pregnant the Park may ask replacement costs for both the bears and the fetuses.\n\nA total of seven rangers from the South District and two North Carolina officers were involved in the incident. (CompuServe from Jason Houck, C.R.)\n\nFriday, November 30, 1990\n\n90-427 - Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Victim Found\n\nOn November 27th, rangers investigating a citizen's report discovered the wreckage of a pickup truck and the body of its driver, 37-year-old W.F. of Maryville, Tennessee, off the edge of the Foothills Parkway about a mile east of its junction with US 321. W.F. had been missing since July 4th, when he failed to return heme after waterskiing with some friends on Cherokee Lake. W.F. had apparently been driving westbound on the parkway when he went off a steep, 50-foot embankment. He hit a large poplar tree, which flattened the truck's cab, then fell over and concealed it for over four months. The accident occurred in an area of exclusive jurisdiction; the FBI is assisting in the investigation. (Bob Miller, GRSM, via telefax from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO, 11/28).\n\nWednesday, December 5, 1990\n\n90-434 - Great Smoky Mountains (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Poaching\n\nAt about 4:00 p.m. on December 1st, rangers heard shots fired within the park. At about the same time, an interagency stakeout team (NPS, USFS and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission) which was preparing to begin a surveillance operation near the Twentymile ranger station saw a vehicle drop off a man near the point where those shots were fired. The man entered the woods with a light; he returned about five minutes later and appeared to be dragging something. The vehicle then returned to pick him up. Team members moved to stop the vehicle, but a previously unseen lookout vehicle tipped off the suspects that rangers were on their way. The suspect vehicle quickly left the area at a high rate of speed. When finally stopped about four miles away on U.S. Route 129, team members were unable to find either a weapon or a deer within. A deer carcass was later found on state land, but trackers followed drag marks to a kill site within the park. The driver of the vehicle will probably be charged with aiding and abetting, and the passenger with possession of wildlife.

R.T. apparently died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Suicide is suspected. (Telephone report from Capt. Steve Alscher, RAD/SERO, 12/20).\n\nFriday, January 11, 1991\n\n91-6 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Poaching Arrest\n\nOn January 7th, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency received an anonymous report that two Florida men were in the park to poach trophy deer. The men were said to be driving a Ford Bronco and to be armed with a silenced weapon. Rangers spotted the vehicle in Townsend on the 8th, and a surveillance team was assembled to monitor its movement. Around 10:00 p.m. that evening, the Bronco headed into the park, and a man was dropped off at the entrance to the Cades Cove loop road. The Bronco returned every two hours throughout the night, then picked up the man at 7:30 a.m. on the 9th. The Bronco was stopped near Townsend by rangers, and two men T.M.W., 37, and C.L.N., 35, both of Fort Pierce, Florida were arrested. A .22 caliber rifle with a scope and silencer was seized along with the head of a 12-point buck. A consent search of their motel room led to the discovery of another trophy head. The two men have been charged with hunting in the park under 16 USC 403 H3 and are presently out on bond. A trial has been set for February 21st in Knoxville. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will examine the silencer on the rifle, which appears to be homemade. The park will ask for forfeiture of the Bronco.

The ranger who responded to the accident found controlled substances in the car and asked that a drug dog from Gatlinburg, Tennessee, be brought to the scene. A half pound of marijuana was subsequently discovered in the vehicle. N.M.H. was also found to have over $2,000 on his person. He was arrested by park rangers and charged with violation of 21 USC 844 (possession of a controlled substance).

The shelter itself is about six miles from a paved road. S.K. sustained probable head, neck and back injuries in the fall, so a carryout was required. Over two dozen rangers were employed in the effort, which took place in a continuous rain storm at night and in rugged terrain. S.K. was to have reached the highway and a waiting ambulance early yesterday morning.

On April 30th, judgement was rendered by the U.S. magistrate in Bryson City, North Carolina. Both W.P.O. and S.O. pled guilty to violating the Lacey Act, and each was sentenced to five years probation, fined $1,000, and ordered to pay $1,035 in restitution for one black bear. H.L.R. was found guilty of aiding and abetting the hunters and was sentenced to two years probation and fined $500. All three men were banned from all federal lands in North Carolina and Tennessee during the periods of their probations. Two vehicles and a firearm were seized in the case, but were returned to the defendants as part of the plea bargain. Although the state elected not to file charges, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission was instrumental in the development of the federal case.

Two men S.H., 19, and E.H., 25, both of Tapoco, North Carolina were subsequently found with a deer carcass which had been dragged from the park onto state land, and a third - I.M. was discovered in a lookout vehicle. All three were charged with various violations. Judgement was rendered on them by a U.S. magistrate on June 12th. S.H. pled nolo contendere to possession of a whitetailed deer and was fined $200; E.H. pled nolo contendere to aiding and abetting in connection with the above and was fined $400; I.M. pled not guilty to a charge of aiding and abetting, but was found guilty, fined $1,000 and ordered to provide 40 hours of community service. This was I.M.'s third wildlife offense in the park in the past decade. All three men were ordered to pay restitution for the cost of the deer, received six month suspended sentences and two years probation, and were banned from all federal lands in North Carolina and Tennessee during their probation periods. Officers from the Forest Service and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission were participants in the December stakeout and provided essential assistance in the development and prosecution of the case.

When they failed to return as scheduled on the evening of the 30th, H.B.'s wife called rangers at midnight and advised them that they were overdue. Investigators determined that the pair had spent the night of the 28th at Ice Water Spring and the night of the 29th at Tricorner Knob, and that they had received permission from the park to hike from there crosscountry from Mount Guyot to Ramsey Prong Creek and then on up Ramsey Cascade Trail. Accordingly, a hasty search of the trail was conducted on the morning of the 31st. When it proved fruitless, a team of four rangers began hiking up the Ramsey Cascade drainages that afternoon while another pair descended from Mount Guyot. Both teams found footprints around night fall, and tracked the pair through the day yesterday. They were found in good condition at 3:00 p.m. and escorted out of the backcountry.

They were each charged with violations of 18 USC 403h-3 and entered conditional guilty pleas before a U.S. magistrate in Knoxville on July 12th. Judgements were rendered on October 11th. Each defendant was sentenced to six months' incarceration with all but 14 days suspended, four years' probation, 200 hours of community service, and $1,000 restitution, which is to be paid to the park. Each is prohibited from possessing any firearms or other dangerous weapons during the period of probation except what may be required in the line of duty. Hunting, however, is absolutely precluded. T.M.W. was ordered to pay a fine of $500 and C.L.N. a fine of $1,500. They were also ordered to forfeit the rifle, scope and silencer and the Ford Bronco (valued at $7,500) used in the incident. The conditional plea of guilty allows the defendants to file an appeal on the merits of the magistrate's ruling regarding suppression of evidence. The defendants have filed an appeal on that basis.

A park employee detected the fire around 6:30 a.m. and notified the Gatlinburg fire department. By the time the department's engines arrived, the building was completely engulfed. It took firefighters about 25 minutes to control the blaze. The building, which was constructed in 1955, was generally employed as a bunkhouse for seasonal employees and SCA personnel, but at the time of the fire was being utilized by the park's cooperating association as temporary office space while another park building was renovated. The building's value was placed at $35,000, but the association also lost computers and other items in the fire. Some records stored in a fire-resistant file cabinet apparently survived the blaze; the association's financial records were kept in the auditor's office elsewhere and are safe.

The vehicle had been seen at that location the previous evening, but no one was found in the area. The victim was identified as P.W., 51, of Harrogate, Tennessee. Investigation revealed that she'd been reported missing by her husband the previous day and that the company truck she was driving was reported missing by her employer. She'd last been seen just after noon on the 28th. The initial autopsy results indicate that she had cut an artery in her left arm, but the exact cause of death has not yet been determined. On the 30th, a park maintenance worker found a large quantity of blood and footprints matching P.W.'s about 200 yards from the truck near the Little River. Rangers now believe that P.W. attempted suicide, then changed her mind and returned to the truck. She was too weak to proceed further, though, and died at that location.

CAP and park personnel drove park roads until 3:30 a.m. in an unsuccessful attempt to pinpoint the origin of the signals. At 4:30 a.m., the park received word from CAP and FAA officials that two aircraft had been reported missing and that either or both could be in the park. The search for the signal continued on the 27th. Due to an inch of new snow, extreme overcast and fog, the search was confined to the ground and efforts to pinpoint the signal continued to be unsuccessful. Early in the afternoon, a private helicopter spotted the wreckage of a Cessna 310 near Clingman's Dome, the highest point in the park at 6,643 feet, but was unable to provide detailed location information to the incident command team. Weather on Tuesday again precluded the use of aircraft. Ranger and CAP ground teams, hampered by fog, a foot of new snow, steep terrain and thick vegetation (known locally as \"rhododendron hells\") remained unable to locate the wreckage despite strong signals on directional finding equipment. Clear weather on the morning of the 29th made it possible for a Bell 206 helicopter to direct a ground team to the crash site. The wreckage was near the 5,800-foot elevation a half mile north-northeast of the Clingman's Dome observation tower. The ELT antenna had broken off on impact. The pilot and sole occupant, M.W., 23, of Cartersville, Georgia, had been thrown about 75 feet from the wreckage and had suffered fatal injuries. The body was removed by helicopter long-line and was transported to a local hospital. A total of 28 park and 23 CAP personnel were involved in the search effort along with two fixed-wing CAP aircraft and two helicopters. Representatives from the FAA, NTSB, insurance company, and engine and aircraft manufacturers are on site to investigate the cause. M.W. had experience as a pilot and aircraft mechanic and was rated for IFR, but filed no flight plan and apparently remained at a relatively low altitude during the flight. Although an OAS-authorized temporary flight restriction was not put into effect over the area, an overflight by a local helicopter tour operator caused enough interference to warrant a contact by park authorities. Despite an agreement to comply with a request to maintain a two to three mile perimeter around the site, a second helicopter from the same business overflew the site later in the day. The FAA has been advised. (Note: The second missing aircraft reported by FAA was found near Mt. Mitchell off Blue Ridge Parkway on April 27th. Two people were killed in that crash).

About 55 students from the Michigan school have been found to date. Four helicopters flew the park yesterday, primarily along the Appalachian Trail. Several hikers were lifted out of the woods. A number of military medics were also lowered into the park to treat hikers. Most treatment has been for hypothermia in the beginning stages; there have been no serious injuries. Between 90 and 100 park employees were involved in the search yesterday. Five helicopters will be working the park today.

Two of the groups were in the Upper Hazel Creek bunkhouse; the remaining eight were at a backcountry campsite about a mile away. Groups from the Cranbrook School come to the park each year for an \"Outward Bound\" type experience in which students hike with counselors through the park for several days. This year, ten groups of eight came to the park. Searchers found the other seven groups on Monday. Although some group members were suffering from hypothermia and frostbite, some of it severe, most were in good shape. The search continues for 11 other hikers who are still in the park. Many of them came to the park specifically for the winter hiking experience; some of those who have been contacted have waived rescue, others have walked out and are in good condition. The superintendent closed the backcountry yesterday, however; all those still remaining in the park will be found and evacuated. Six helicopters are scheduled to search the park today, but weather conditions may impede operations. It is currently very overcast and raining, and flash flood warnings have been posted for the area. If the hikers are not found today, then six Apache helicopters with infrared sensing equipment will fly over the park tonight. About ten rangers will also be sent in to high probability search areas on snowshoe today. Attention will be focused on the major trails between Cades Cove and park headquarters and the Appalachian Trail. There were about 150 to 175 personnel deployed on the search yesterday. They are operating under a unified command with Jason Houck, the park's chief ranger, serving as incident commander; members are the NPS, Forest Service, CAP, Tennessee Emergency Management Administration, and North Carolina Air National Guard.

Searchers now believe that there are ten hikers still in the park and are focusing their efforts on reaching several shelters along the Appalachian Trail (AT). Flight operations were suspended yesterday because of poor weather but will likely resume this morning. During the night, a pair of Apache helicopters with infrared equipment flew the park, two rangers on snowshoes worked their way toward the Russell Field shelter, and two more rangers attempted to reach the Spence Field shelter. Because of \"extremely rugged going\" caused by drifts up to 12 feet high, the teams had difficulty making headway and still have, respectively, a half mile and a mile and a half to go to reach their destinations. Fourteen rangers with extensive winter skiing and camping experience arrived last night from seven parks (St. Croix, Rocky Mountain, Grand Teton, Voyageur, Apostle Island, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Big South Fork). This morning, four of them will begin snowshoeing from Fontana Dam eastward on the AT toward the Birch Spring shelter; three others will be airlifted by helicopter to the Spence Field shelter and will move westward toward Fontana after checking the shelter. The remaining seven will be on stand by until the shelters are checked and revised assessments of search areas can be made. Four Blackhawk helicopters will be utilized on the search today. Boat patrols are also being conducted on Fontana Lake in case any hikers reach the shore line there, and a military tracked vehicle will work its way towards Clingman's Dome.

LeConte and was missing. Rangers and a dog team searched for B.L. on the three main trails to Mt. LeConte until 3:30 a.m. yesterday, then resumed efforts a few hours later. As of yesterday afternoon, there were 21 rangers directly involved in the search; they were supported by three helicopters and two search dog teams. Search officials are convinced that B.L. is not on a designated trail and believe that he may be on one of a number of unmarked side trails or off the trail system entirely. A three-pronged search effort was being utilized yesterday. One team was using dogs and man-tracking techniques to look for signs of the boy in the area where he was last seen, four teams were hiking cross-country up both sides of the two major watercourses that come down from Mr. LeConte, and other rangers were stationed at strategic trail junctions throughout the night in case B.L. emerged on a trail. According to B.L.'s parents, he is in good health and fairly well dressed to stay out overnight. He's reportedly clad in a polypropylene shirt, a jacket, an Army-green poncho and camouflage pants.

During the night that followed, helicopters with heat sensing equipment also attempted to find him. None met with any success. Rain fell on the area yesterday, grounding aircraft. Ground teams worked nine search sectors, focusing on high probability areas; three dog teams, each accompanied by a highly-skilled tracker, were also deployed.

An additional 40 searchers will be committed today, bringing the total number of ground searchers to about 190 and the total number of personnel involved in the incident to just under 300. Today's efforts will focus on a half mile by two-and-three-quarter mile search area containing about 700 acres of park land. The area covered by ground searchers yesterday included the entire zone from Rainbow Falls to the trailhead. This was the correct area in light of new information learned on Thursday morning. A public appeal made by B.L.'s parents to three college-aged males they'd seen at the Falls on Sunday paid off. The young men, all from the east Tennessee area and known by park personnel to be reliable sources, contacted the park to say that they'd never seen the boy in the falls area. It now seems likely that B.L. never reached the falls, which significantly limits the area to be searched and allows search personnel to concentrate primarily on locations below the falls. They will re-check areas to assure full coverage of boulder fields, cliffs and creeks. The five search dog teams committed to the incident will again be employed to search for signs of the boy. The weather forecast calls for cold weather (around 45 degrees) and possible rain or snow. Agencies and organizations involved in the search include the Forest Service, BIA, the United States Army (Fort Campbell), Tennessee Department of Forestry, Tennessee State Parks, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Tennessee Army National Guard, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and a number of local CAP, fire, and search and rescue units.

He was found about a half mile uphill from the point last seen above \"some pretty significant geographical barriers\", including rock bluffs and water falls. The apparent cause of death was massive trauma stemming from a fall from the top of the cliff. Demobilization of search operations is well underway.

M.T., who was traveling with his mother, left the Clingman's Dome parking area around 1 p.m. that afternoon for a six-hour circuit hike on the Appalachian, Welch Ridge, Jonas Creek and Forney Creek trails. The total distance for such a trip is about 17 miles. When he failed to return to the parking area that night, his mother advised rangers that he was overdue. A hasty search was conducted in heavy rain until 3 a.m.; trail blockers, trail runners, trackers, and dog teams were deployed later that morning. Investigators were able to determine that M.T. had last been seen by backpackers around 7:30 Tuesday evening about seven miles southwest of Clingman's Dome. He was reported to have been wet, cold and shaking mildly, and his hands were said to have been white with a \"prune-like texture.\" The backpackers offered him food and shelter; although he declined, he did drink some water, then headed off in the direction of Clingman's Dome. Searchers found possible tracks above the trail, but lost them in the evening due to new snow and gusty winds. Temperatures dropped to 22 degrees at Newfound Gap that evening. On Thursday, search teams, including both dog teams and trackers, checked high probability areas. The main area was covered with four inches of snow, and gusty winds prevented the use of helicopters. At 2:10 p.m., a search team found M.T. sitting in wet clothes on his shoulder bag in four-foot high rhododendron about 30 yards from Steeltrap Creek a quarter mile above the Forney Creek trail. He was shaking, had a low blood glucose level, and was in an altered mental state. M.T. was dressed in dry clothes and ALS procedures were begun. A 101st Airborne Division Blackhawk helicopter with winch capability and a jungle penetrator was dispatched from Fort Campbell in Kentucky and arrived at the scene at 6:20 p.m. M.T. was evacuated and flown to the University of Kentucky Medical Center, where he stayed for five days. Follow-up interviews with him reveal that he lost the trail in the dark on Tuesday night, hiked cross- country all day on Wednesday, and traveled only a short distance before being found on Thursday. He said that he began having hallucinations of cabins and villages while hiking, and that he would periodically lose a hiking boot and have to hunt for it in the snow. When he got it on, he couldn't tie the boot lace. M.T. had no prior experience hiking in the Smokies. A total of 55 people and six dogs were involved in the search.

Carolina/Tennessee) - Helicopter Crash\n\nOn April 16th, a Bell 204 helicopter registered to Ranger Helicopter Services of Roanoke, Virginia, crashed on the Little River Road three miles from park headquarters. The pilot, M.C., 51, of Midlothian, Virginia, was not hurt. M.C. told rangers that he was flying from Greenville, Tennessee, to Dalton, Georgia, at an altitude for from 600 to 700 feet when his engine shut down.

[Lois Bogle, GRSM, 6/7]\n\nTuesday, June 8, 1993\n\n93-329 - Great Smoky Mountains (N. Carolina/Tennessee) - Car Clout Arrests\n\nBetween April 17th and May 30th, three vehicles were stolen and seven more were hit by car clouters in the Big Creek area. The total value of property stolen and damaged exceeded $34,000. As a consequence, the park began a number of surveillance operations and arrested two men - S.S. and B.D., both 19 and from Cocke County, Tennessee - as they were attempting to break into vehicles at Big Creek at 2 a.m. on May 30th. Stolen property from a home burglary was recovered during the arrest. Investigators determined that the two men were responsible for some of the prior thefts. While processing the crime scene a half hour later, another vehicle arrived at the scene. The driver, B.D.W., 22, of Cocke County, was found to be in possession of burglary tools, stolen property, and marijuana. He was also arrested. The case is to be taken before the grand jury today. Felony charges are being pursued. [Lois Bogle, GRSM, 6/7]\n\nTuesday, June 8, 1993\n\n93-330 - Great Smoky Mountains (N. Carolina/Tennessee) - Drowning\n\nOn June 5th, the body of C.W., 16, a corpsman at the Oconaluftee Job Corps facility, was found floating in the Oconaluftee River by two fishermen. C.W. was last seen at the residential compound located just outside Cherokee, North Carolina, on May 24th. Rangers learned of his absence from family members on May 29th. On June 1st, two search dogs from the North Carolina SAR Dog Association checked the roads, fields, trails and rivers near the Job Corps grounds. A missing person flyer was also assembled and distributed in the local area, and C.W.'s name was entered into NCIC missing person files. An autopsy was performed on June 6th and the preliminary indication is that he drowned. The investigation is continuing; more interviews with Job Corps staff and corpsmen are planned.

[Don Utterback, Acting CR, GRSM, 7/21]\n\nWednesday, July 28, 1993\n\n93-528 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - MVA; Four Fatalities\n\nFour people were killed and several more injured in a multiple car accident on U.S. 441 near Towstring Road at 5:30 p.m. on July 25th. Each of the three vehicles involved in the incident carried families of four comprised of two parents and two children. D.B., 35, of Chandler, North Carolina, who was driving a 1990 Thunderbird, was heading southbound on the highway when he failed to negotiate a right-hand curve, crossed the double center line and struck a northbound Ford Escort driven by C.H., 36, of Morehead, Kentucky. A white Suburu sedan driven by N.N., 46, of Honaker, Virginia, also northbound, then struck the right side of the Thunderbird after it had come to a stop. D.B. was transported by Lifestar to the University of Tennessee Hospital, where he is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. His wife, L.J.G.B., 37, who was the front seat passenger, and his daughter, S.L., seven, were pronounced dead upon arrival at Cherokee Indian Health Service Hospital. The D.B.'s other daughter, A., 10, is in critical condition at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville. Both C.H. and her husband, G., 36, were pronounced dead at the scene.

None of the occupants of the third vehicle were seriously injured. They were treated at Swain County Hospital and released. There is no indication that alcohol was a factor in the incident. [Jason Houck, CR, GRSM, 7/27]\n\nMonday, August 9, 1993\n\n93-578 - Great Smokies (N. Carolina/Tennessee) - Search; Attempted Suicide\n\nAround 6 p.m. on July 28th, rangers at the Deep Creek received a message to be on the lookout for W.J. of Bryson City, North Carolina, who had left a suicide note in her home then departed for points unknown. Rangers found her vehicle parked at the Deep Creek trailhead ten minutes later. The car contained a second suicide note. Rangers conducted a hasty search and found W.J. near a creek a mile and a half up the trail. She had consumed about 120 one milligram tablets of lorazepam, but was still conscious. They evacuated her down the trail to a Swain County EMS ambulance, which took her to a local hospital. W.J. was treated and held at the facility for psychiatric evaluation. Two more suicide notes were found in her purse. [Dave Panebaker, ACR, GRSM, 8/5]\n\nMonday, August 9, 1993\n\n93-579 - Great Smokies (N. Carolina/Tennessee) - EMS Incident\n\nA VIP in the Clingman's Dome area received a report of a man down on a trail about a half mile from the parking lot at 3:30 pm on August 1st. Two visiting emergency room nurses began performing CPR on the man, 60-year-old R.R. of Long Beach, Mississippi, and were assisted by responding rangers. R.R. was taken to the Collins Gap area, where he was picked up and evacuated by a Bell 412 Life Star helicopter from the University of Tennessee Medical Center. He later died at the center. Rangers subsequently learned that R.R. had been taking medication for high blood pressure. After the helicopter left the scene, the rangers were collecting used medical equipment and placing it in a red bio-hazard plastic bag when one of them was accidentally stuck in the leg by an unshielded epinephrine syringe needle. The ranger had completed his hepatitis B vaccinations and had a tetanus booster within the last year. The syringe had been used to administer medication to R.R. through an endotracheal tube. [Dave Panebaker, ACR, GRSM, 8/5]\n\nFriday, September 3, 1993\n\n93-277 - Great Smokies (North Carolina/Tennessee) - Follow-up on Fatal MVA\n\nOn May 22nd, J.S., 45, of Sevierville, Tennessee, was driving on Little River Road when he crossed the center line and struck an on-coming vehicle with three people in it. W.S., 78, who was sitting in the back seat of the second vehicle, died at the scene; his wife, Mamie, 89, and daughter, Faye Money, 49, received severe injuries. J.S. was subsequently determined to have been driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. On August 24th, J.S. was found guilty of one count of second degree murder (18 USC 111) and two counts of assault (18 USC 113) in a jury trial in federal district court in Knoxville. J.S. was willing to plea to a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter, but the U.S. attorney felt that the damage incurred by the victims was overwhelming and warranted a stronger penalty. Key elements that were important to the case were the language of 18 USC 111, which requires that \"malice and aforethought\" be proven to show reckless endangerment, and 18 USC 113, which stipulates that \"willful intent\" must be demonstrated to prove assault. Witness testimony and physical evidence obtained at the scene made it possible to show that these elements applied. The conviction has been deemed important to the area because of the minimal penalties that exist locally for DWI convictions which contribute to deaths. [Jerry Grubb, GRSM, 8/26]\n\nThursday, September 9, 1993\n\n93-684 - Great Smokies (Tennessee/North Carolina) - Suicide\n\nRangers found 38-year-old R.J. of Morristown, Tennessee, lying on the driver's seat of a locked Mercedes 190 sedan in the Newfound Gap parking area on the morning of September 8th. They gained access by breaking a window and found that R.J. was alive but suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center, where he died that evening. Further investigation lead to the discovery of a loaded .25 caliber semi-automatic handgun, four suicide notes, and a micro cassette tape recorder with a 37-minute-long tape to his family. The tape indicated that R.J. shot himself at 1:30 a.m. that morning. A fifth suicide note was subsequently located in the mailbox at his residence. Jefferson County officers had recently interviewed R.J. regarding some thefts that had occurred at his place of employment; larceny charges against him were pending.
