        "text": "Ohio’s McCafferty began as most good earworms should: melodies looped into and blended with pop-rock backbeats, a knack for urgent relatability, and a dedication to capturing a universal feeling. McCafferty edges on the quirky emo/rock of The Weakerthans or Rozwell Kid. Take This To Heart Records released their last album on June 30.\n\nAlso from Ohio, Heart Attack Man originally started as a solo recording project for singer/guitarist Eric Egan in 2013. Driven by an engrained appreciation for addictive melodies and hard hitting alternative rock, the project quickly evolved into a full band. Shortly after the EP Acid Rain was released the band hit the road playing throughout the U.S. and Canada. Ready to record more the band headed to Philadelphia and began recording Ian Farmer from Modern Baseball at Headroom Studios. The result is band’s debut full-length, The Manson Family, which is available through Triple Crown Records.\n\nMcCafferty will be hitting the road March 14-April 19 with Moose Blood and Lydia.\n\nTicket Link: www.mccaffertyband/tour\n\n3.14: Boston, MA @ Royale\n\n3.15: New York, NY @ Irving Plaza\n\n3.16: Philadelphia, PA @ Theater Of Living Arts\n\n3.17: Asbury Park, NJ @ The Stone Pony\n\n3.18: Washington D.C @ 9:30 Club\n\n3.20: Richmond, VA @Canal Club\n\n3.21: Carrboro, NC @ Cat’s Cradle\n\n3.23: Tampa, FL @ Orpheum\n\n3.24: Atlanta, GA @ The Masquerade\n\n3.25: Nashville, TN @ Basement East\n\n3.27: Houston, TX @ White Oak Music Hall\n\n3.28: Austin, TX @ Scoot Inn\n\n3.29: Dallas, TX @ Gas Monkey\n\n3.31: Phoenix, AZ @ The Nile\n\n4.2: San Diego, CA @ Quartyard\n\n4.3: Los Angeles, CA @ The Regent\n\n4.4: San Fransisco, CA @ Slim’s\n\n4.6: Portland, OR @ Hawthorne Theater\n\n4.7: Seattle, WA @ El Corazon\n\n4.9: Salt Lake City, UT @ The Complex\n\n4.10: Denver, CO @ Summit Music Hall\n\n4.12: Burnsville, MN @ The Garage\n\n4.13: Chicago, IL @ House Of Blues\n\n4.14: Detroit, MI @ St Andrews\n\n4.15: Cleveland, OH @ Agora Ballroom\n\n4.17: Buffalo, NY @ Town Ballroom\n\n4.18: Toronto, ON @ The Phoenix\n\n4.19: Montreal, QC @ Fairmont Theater"
