        "text": "Written expression is often overlooked in our essays. Often, if we are made aware of clunky or awkward expression, we are also not quite sure how to go about improving it. Although sophisticated and pertinent ideas serve as the foundation of a successful essay, how we construct our sentences and express these ideas may be what distinguishes a good essay from a great essay.\n\nThese differences can be rather subtle, but the small things can and do matter.\n\n1) USE YOUR VOCAL CHORDSÂ\n\n(to read out loud, not singâ¦ unless you really want to)\n\nTake your essay and read it out loud. Let your own conscience guide you in terms of whether a particular sentence flows well, is complete and makes sense. Keep your eye out for these small errors in particular: Grammar:Does your sentence actually make sense? Letâs have a look at an example:Although Funder suggests that the act of telling oneâs story, especially one of victimisation, can catalyse the internal confrontation and healing required to move on.\n\n?!?Â\n\n(This is not grammatically correct! This is because this example only contains a subordinate clause and is lacking a main clause.)\n\nâ\n\nBut waitâ¦ what is this âsubordinate clauseâ and âmain clauseâ?\n\nA clause includes a subject and a verb.\n\nMelissa ate an apple.After Wendy ate an apple.\n\nWhat is the difference between the two clauses above?\n\nâMelissa ate an appleâ makes grammatical sense on its own. This is what we call a main clause (or an independent clause). On the other hand, âAfter Wendy ate an appleâ is an incomplete sentence as it does not make sense. What happened after Wendy ate her apple? This is the information that is missing from the latter clause, making this a subordinate clause (or a dependent clause).\n\nSo now letâs try againâ¦\n\nAlthough Funder suggests that the act of telling oneâs story, especially one of victimisation, can catalyse the internal confrontation and healing required to move on, ultimately, these individuals can never be truly free from the past that has irrevocably defined them. Â\n\n(Hooray! This is a complete sentence now.)\n\nSpelling: Are the title of the text, the author or directorâs name, charactersâ names, publisherâs name, etc. all spelt correctly (and capitalised, underlined, and italicised appropriately)?\n\nDid you use the correct there, their and theyâre? How about itâs and its? (and so on).\n\nSentence length: Did that sentence just go on for 5 lines on a page and you are out of breath now? You can most probably split that overloaded sentence into two or more sentences that make much more sense. Check whether you have a clear subject in your sentence. If you have three different ideas in one sentence, give each idea its own opportunity (ie. sentence) to shine. The opposite also applies: if it is for a very short sentence, did that sentence pack enough content or analysis?\n\nOne spelling error or half-finished sentence in an essay will not severely affect your mark, but they can easily add up if they occur often enough. Consequently, this will distract the reader from engaging with your ideas fully and thus disrupt the flow of your essay.\n\nBy being aware of these aspects, you are now able to easily fix them and boost your writing.\n\nâ\n\n2) BE SUBTLE\n\nTry not to be casual or overt in your writing as it can be quite jarring to read and unfortunately give readers a potentially negative impression of your piece.\n\nTry not to use phrases such as:\n\n- In my opinionâ¦ (You do not need it as your entire essay should be your implicit opinion!)\n\n- This quote shows thatâ¦ (Embed the quote and link to its implication instead)\n\n- This technique is designed toâ¦ (Identify the technique and be specific, especially in Language Analysis)\n\n- I think thatâ¦, I believeâ¦ (Avoid using first person in a formal essay. Use of first person in creative writing is fine though if required)\n\nThey are redundant and do not add much to your ideas and analysis. Try omitting them and see whether that helps your sentence flow better and seem more formal.\n\nâ\n\n3) LINK âEM UP\n\nSentences that seem disjointed or a clear connection can make it difficult for your teacher or the assessor to join the dots between an idea and an implication or consequence. Use linking words as they are fantastic for explicitly showing the reader how your ideas are related and thus allow your writing to proceed smoothly.\n\nTherefore, hence, thus, thereby, consequently, subsequently, in addition, additionally, furthermore, moreover, on the other hand, on the contrary, however, henceforth, and so onâ¦ The list is endless!\n\nâ\n\n4) ADD OOMPH (through vocabulary)\n\nIn general, having a wide vocabulary will allow you to express your ideas and analysis more accurately as you are likely to have access to a precise word that can capture the essence of your idea. Make a vocabulary list for a particular text or for Language Analysis (such as tone words) and aim to use varied language to convey yourself well.\n\nIf youâd like to see a list of sentence starters and essay phrases to help you get a headstart on expanding your vocabulary, check out this blog.\n\nFocus on verbs and expanding your list of synonyms for words such as shows, demonstrates, highlights, emphasises, suggests and so on. An individual, character, author or director may not only be conveying but also denigrating or remonstrating or bolstering or glorifying or insinuating. Adding precision to your writing through careful vocabulary choice will distinguish your writing and also add complexity.\n\nBEWARE! There is a fine line to tread with sophisticated vocabulary - do not overload your writing as you can risk writing convoluted sentences that hinder the readerâs ability to understand your piece. Also make sure that you understand the nuances of each synonym and that they are used in the correct context! (They are synonyms after all - not the same word!)\n\nIf you are debating whether to use a word, ask yourself: do you know what it means?Â\n\nIf yes: Go for it!\n\nIf no: Do not use it until you know what it means.\n\nâ\n\n5) READ\n\nReading sample essays, The Age Text Talks, reviews and more of the texts you are currently studying will expose you to not only a multitude of interpretations of your text, but also to different sentence structures, writing styles or vocabulary that you could incorporate into your own writing.\n\nI would also highly recommend that you read outside of the texts you are studying if you have time, whether that may be novels by the same author or even newspapers. Your written expression will only benefit from this exposure as the ways you can express yourself through writing continue to increase upon seeing othersâ eloquence.\n\nâ\n\n6) GET WRITING\n\nIf you do not write, you will never be able to improve your written expression. Put pen to paper (or hands to keyboard) and start constructing that essay. You can only fix your writing once you have writing to fix.\n\nGood luck!\n\nThe Lieutenant is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nGrenvilleâs novel follows the life of protagonist, Lieutenant Daniel Rooke in his journey with the first fleet. Rookeâs primary conflict is his choice between his moral conscience and duty as a soldier. Because he is aware from an early age that he is out of step with the world, he tends to be more reasonable in his way of dealing with conflict. His final response to his inner conflict is to stand strongly by what he believes.\n\nThe Lieutenant at its core is a journey of self-discovery as Daniel Rooke navigates the immoral waters of British imperialism and its impact on the indigenous Australians. Becoming closer to Tagaran, Rooke attempts to bridge cultural barriers through the transformative power of language. Rooke observes the scissions created by violence and the perhaps misplaced Western superiority and is perpetually torn between his moral intuitions and his obligations and duty as a Lieutenant.\n\nTIP: Have an understanding of the historical context behind The Lieutenant as well as the real life people that Grenville loosely based her novel off of. This means having a grasp on the first fleet, the British colonisation of Australia and important figures such as Bennelong.\n\nThemes\n\nTIP: I have included some examples from the text but this list is by no means exhaustive, occasionally there is a repetition of examples. Itâs important to remember that examples are versatile and can be applied to many different themes and ideas. Feel free to add and explore how other examples might enhance these themes.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage dictates commonality and communication, yet to Rooke he discovers that central to the power of language is the willingness to cooperate, patience and respect. Throughout Grenvilleâs novel, however, it is clear that language can not only dispel the lasting vestiges of misunderstanding but it can also form the basis for racism and violence. It is through our language itself that reveals our biases.\n\nThe language of racism\n\nWeymark refers to the Indigenous men during their first encounter as âmister darkieâ etc. each a patronising euphemism concealing his arrogant notions of superiority\n\nThe limitation of language to accurately portray and convey a moment\n\nâwhat had passed between Tagaran and himself had gone far beyond vocabulary or grammatical formsâ (pg186)\n\nThe language of violence\n\nâwhat it said was I can kill you. He did not want her to learn that language. Certainly not from himâ (pg224)\n\nâViolence had an enlivening effect. As long as someone else was the victim it made the blood pump, gave the world an edge of glamourâ (pg239)\n\nâGamekeeper. He wondered whether that word had killed Brugdenâ (pg240)\n\nâThe gun is the only language the buggers will understandâ (pg241)\n\nâwar was a species of conversationâ (pg108)\n\nAssumed cultural superiority of British empire\n\nThe hierarchical nature of British Society stands in diametric opposition to the community-oriented system employed by the Indigenous Australians. This hierarchy defines their people by their contributions to âHer Majestyâ and shames and âpunish[es]â all those who fail to comply with the loose morals and violence condoned by the British colonists. This notion is elucidated through the exploitation of the natives and the nations reliance on oppression and servitude to maintain its imperial status, put simply: their strength is an accident arising from the weakness of others. It is on this foundation that Grenville explores the violent treatment of the natives by the British and even their treatment of their own people.\n\nâIn the world of Church Street, Benjamin Rooke was a man of education and standing and a father to be proud of. At the Portsmouth Naval Academy a mile away, he was an embarrassmentâ (pg6)\n\nâSo we punishâ¦. Every man is the same. If he steals, he is punishedâ¦ It was interesting to hear that magnificent idea â the product of hundreds of years of British civilisation â spelled out so plainâ(pg195)\n\nThis was justice: impartial, blind, noble. The horror of the punishment was the proof of its impartiality. If it did not hurt, it was not justice.â (pg197)\n\nâBy god they are savageâ¦ Dirty too, look at the filth on themâ\n\nâthey may be savages, we call them savages. But their feelings are no different from oursâ\n\nWeymark resorts to derogatory name calling, urging on âmy black friendâ and âMister Darkieâ in his base supplications\n\nPower of conscience\n\nThe morality that is ingrained in Rooke from the onset aligns quite naturally with our own moral standards. Yet Grenville encourages readers to explore the difficult choice between morals and disobedience. Rooke faces such a choice. To obey an order to accompany an expedition to capture or kill six indigenous men, this forms the central conflict of Grenvilleâs novel. As elucidated through both Rooke and Gardiner, moral acts that defy the expectations and âorders of Her Majestyâ are deeply frowned upon.\n\nâBut Rooke, think: this is not a request, it is an orderâ (pg246)\n\nââ¦spell out the consequences of refusal.â (pg248)\n\nââ¦ the service of humanity and the service of His Majesty were not congruentâ (pg249)\n\nâI am sorry to have been persuaded to comply with the order. I would not for any reason ever obey a similar orderâ (pg285)\n\nâyour orders were a most gravely wrong thing, I regret beyond my words my part in the businessâ (pg285)\n\nViolence\n\nViolence is central to the operation of imperialists as the British tightens its grip on the Indigenous Australians. Grenville emphasises that the power sought out by the British empire will always come at the expense of the natives. Violence and force are used to assert power, confirm boundaries around usurped land, promulgate fear and discourage resistance. The gun becomes a symbol of the violence and force of the settle and they show little intention of relinquishing the dominant position that the gun affords them.\n\nThe punishment for the mutineers of the Renegade reinforces Rookeâs understanding of institutional power and violence as one lieutenant is hanged in a gruesome spectacle and the others dispatched into a nameless void.\n\nWeymark is determined to affirm his dominance and establish the white man as a powerful force\n\nBrugdenâs increased freedom with a weapon results in violence towards the natives which culminates in the kidnapping of the two native men who are âgrabbedâ against their will\n\nBrugdenâs unchecked brutality, and Gilbertâs excessive use of force, highlights the colonialistsâ use of violence as a means of achieving their goal\n\nDuty, service, obedience and the military life\n\nConforming to the pressures of the British Empire, Rooke joins the marines and complicitly serves without attempting to question the morality behind his actions. Importantly, he joins the marines not out of patriotic pride, but because he believes it will aid him to pursue his academic curiosities and steer away from violence. Yet it only brings him closer to the reality that lurks behind the ostensibly moral quest of British imperialism.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nTIP: Whilst The Lieutenant focusses on Rookeâs experiences, you canât neglect the minor characters in the novel, they are there for a reason! Think about how these characters are similar or different, how their stories contribute to Grenvilleâs overall message and their relationship with the central protagonist Rooke. â\n\nDaniel Rooke\n\nAnalysis\n\nLieutenant on the first fleet\n\nAwkward\n\nStruggles to articulate his thoughts and emotions as he is afraid of being âout of step with the worldâ\n\nFrom a young age, Rookeâs interactions with others has made it clear to him that he is different. As such this dictates his response to conflict: blaming himself or withdrawing. His connection to Tagaran through mutual empathy demonstrates his ability to overcome conflict through mutual respect\n\nRooke is bound by duty to Her Majesty yet finds his missions in conflict with his innate instinct for moral righteousness\n\nSupporting quotes\n\nâquiet, moody, a man of few wordsâ\n\nâhe had no memories other than of being an outsiderâ\n\nSilk\n\nAnalysis\n\nCaptain on the first fleet\n\nStands in contrast to Rooke in every respect\n\nStoryteller that is obsessed with his narrative\n\nIgnores the cruelty and violence of the Imperialist expedition in favour of an interesting story\n\nBlinding opportunism that undermines his integrity\n\nHis tendency to gloss over the violence committed in the name of Her Majesty reflects his loyalty to the expedition\n\nSupporting quotes\n\nâman whose narrative was so important to himâ\n\nâa storyteller who could turn the most commonplace event into something entertainingâ\n\nTagaran\n\nAnalysis\n\nConnects with Rooke through their mutual love for learning and language\n\nTagaran voluntarily engages with Rooke in his quest to understand their language, this surpasses the clumsy and mandatory lessons imposed on Boinbar and Warungin.\n\nSupporting quotesâ\n\nâForthright, ferless, sure of herself, she looked to him like a girl who had already mastered whatever social skills her world might demandâ\n\nâa clever child like Tagaran was the perfect choice: quick to learn, but innocent. Curious, full of questions but only a childâ\n\nGardiner\n\nAnalysis\n\nGardiner acts as a foil character to both Silk and Rooke, sharing the same trials and tribulations as Rooke however responding differently than Silk\n\nRookeâs friendship with Gardiner establishes the grounds for their later discussions on language, the treatment of the natives and the imperialist machine as Gardiner sets an example of the consequences of going against the duties required of him\n\nBrugden\n\nAnalysis\n\nBrugden is portrayed as an essential element of colonising and the survival of the British fleet. As an embodiment of violence, Grenville suggests that integral to the operation of imperialism is crude and unwavering violence\n\nâBrugden, out there in the woods, that powerful chestâ¦ He would be an efficient killerâ\n\nSupporting quotes\n\nâSomething had happened out there in the woods about which Brudgen was remaining silentâ\n\nâThe prisoner, taller than anyone else, his powerful frame half bursting out of its thread bare check shirtâ¦â Â\n\nLancelot Percival James\n\nAnalysis\n\nFamily of slave owners, product of the empire\n\nRookeâs inability to understand James is symbolic of his values not aligning with that of the British empire. It foreshadows his later conflict with the value of the empire\n\nJames symbolises the derision of the British hierarchy\n\nSupporting quotes\n\nâGamekeeper! The word suggested the society that Lancelot Percival James had boasted of at the Academyâ¦ But New South Wales was no gentlemanâs estateâ¦ and the gamekeeper was a criminal who had been given a gunâ (pg91)\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nInteresting Points of Analysis\n\nSilkâs Narrative\n\nWhy is Silk obsessed with documenting the first fleet? What does he seek when he writes?\n\nRookeâs job as an astronomer\n\nInitially signing up for the first fleet as an astronomer, Rookeâs job is supposed to be observing comets and stars yet when he arrives he is tasked with a multitude of laborious tasks that hinder his astronomical work. In what ways does this act as a microcosm for the imperialist mission in Australia?\n\nVOCAB: microcosm - a situation or event that encapsulates in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\nRookeâs life in Antigua\n\nWhy did Grenville include this section? What does it add to Rookeâs journey? Why does Rooke choose to do this?\n\nThird Person Omniscient Narration\n\nWritten from Rookeâs perspective, whose opinion do we hear the least of? And what unique perspective does Grenvilleâs choice of narrative perspective offer us?\n\nLanguage\n\nGrenvilleâs language reflects Rookeâs love for language. Her choice of imagery reveals Rookeâs way of seeing the world. For example, âcrescent of yellow sand like a punctuation markâ accentuates Rookeâs tendency to observe his world as a linguist might and Â highlights Rookeâs deep connection with language. Likewise, Rookeâs perception of a gun that speaks a language that âdoes not require listenersâ emphasises his natural tendency to think as a linguist. Grenville does not write in an overly complex, dense or poetic way in order to mirror Rookeâs tendency to view things logically\n\nSetting\n\nHow does the setting that Rooke finds himself in mirror or parallel the emotions that he experiences?\n\nNaval Academy (Portsmouth)\n\nâjust another world that wrenched him out of shapeâ\n\nâsucked out of his spirit and left a shell beingâ\n\nâclosed in on itselfâ, ânarrowâ, âsqueezed tightlyâ\n\nSydney Cove\n\nâThere is nowhere in the world that I would rather beâ(pg97)\n\n\"On the northern shore, high dark prows of headlands hung over the water, the sombre woods pressing down into their own reflections. To the south the land was lower, each bay and promontory shining with the glossy leaves of mangroves. Now and then between them a crescent of yellow sand was like a punctuation markâ (pg89)\n\nTIP: Just like the minor characters I mentioned before, meaning and themes come from all aspects of a novel not just plot points and major characters. By including niche examples such as the setting or the narrative perspective, you can demonstrate that you have a really thorough understanding of the text!\n\nâ\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nâ\n\nThis videoâs takeaway message focuses on tackling essay prompts that include quotations. The extra quote with the prompt can seem superfluous, but often, they can provide hints about how to tackle or challenge the essay topic. It is there for a reason, and if you are familiar with the quote, I would recommend that you try to incorporate it into your essay!\n\nBefore we unpack todayâs essay topic, letâs have a look at background information.\n\nKate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant explores the commonality of the human spirit amidst tumultuous conflict during the First Fleetâs arrival in Australia in 1788. Drawing upon the true experiences of William Dawes, a British astronomer and one of the lieutenants to travel with the First Fleet, Grenville crafts a work of fiction inspired by Dawesâ âtwo little blue notebooksâ detailing his growing understanding of the Aboriginal language Gadigal and his conversations and connection with Patyegarang, a young Aboriginal girl.\n\nThe ability for two individuals from completely different worlds to transcend their differences in order to share cherished moments and understandings together is exemplified in The Lieutenant, alongside the rife external and internal conflicts which threaten such relationship.\n\nTodayâs prompt is:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â\n\nHow does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStart off with focusing on the keywords in this prompt, especially the phrases that resonate with you for Steps 1 and 2 of brainstorming (which I have previously covered in other essay topic breakdowns.)\n\nIn particular, letâs have a look at the phrase âconflict of conscienceâ as this captures the essence of the prompt and what you will need to discuss in your essay. Â\n\nConflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we will need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and âsidesâ need to be taken. Â\n\nConflict itself is a central theme of The Lieutenant, however, it is important to recognise that this topic considers conflict through the narrower lens of âconflict of conscienceâ. This means that in your discussion, the relevance to the prompt is crucial to keep in mind to ensure you are actually answering the question! Â\n\nBut first, letâs analyse the quote:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different pathsâ\n\nThis quote alludes to Rookeâs realisation regarding the reality of his identity, not only as Tagaranâs friend or âkamaraâ but also as a soldier or âBerewalgal\". The resignation and recognition of the impossible â that is, for Rooke to continue attempting to appease both âsidesâ without making critical decisions about who and what he ultimately valued more - is evident in this quote. Hence, this quote refers to the conflict of conscience he experiences and provides us with an insight into not only his character but also conflict itself.\n\nWhy is it not possible for a man to travel along two different paths?\n\nWhat would happen if he tried? Â\n\nWhy was this realisation important for Rooke, especially for his character and development?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions coming to mind upon seeing that quote alone, which all provide hints as to how I might tackle this prompt. Â\n\nNow that we have looked at a few ideas related to the question, weâll now move into potential paragraphs for this essay.\n\nParagraph 1: Grenvilleâs utilisation of Rookeâs perspective in detailing his thought processes, observations and realisations reveals the facets of Rookeâs character contributing to his internal conflicts.\n\nRemembering this is a âhowâ prompt, we want to be analysing ways in which Grenville explores Rookeâs conflict of conscience. In this paragraph, I have chosen to focus on the raw and intimate expression of his inner thoughts and consciousness as the âhowâ aspect. Â\n\nThe detailed perspective reveals Rookeâs naivety in assuming the possibility of maintaining a peaceful connection with Tagaran and the Aboriginal community amidst turbulent and violent times. Consequently, it highlights his realisations regarding the morality of the conflicts he is involved in, and how despite oneâs admirable intentions, âa man could not travel along two different pathsâ without facing dire consequences for their actions. Â\n\nQuestions I might ask myself here include: why does Rooke initially try to deny the reality of his situation? What does his preference for a peaceful and accepting approach towards the Indigenous Australians suggest about his approach to conflict?\n\nThis cognitive dissonance ultimately contributes to his internal conflict between the value he places in his connections with Tagaran and her community and in his duties and obligations as a lieutenant. As readers, we come to realise the duality of this conflict in Rookeâs mind through the limited omniscient third person perspective, which provides us with an insight into Rookeâs shifting understandings of Indigenous people, conflict and even himself. Â\n\nI would then continue unpacking these changing understandings, especially ones relevant to his character which reveal his internal conflicts further. â\n\nParagraph 2: In addition, the stark contrast between Rookeâs approach to his conflict of conscience and other soldiersâ approaches underscores the rationale behind his actions and the stakes ineluctably linked with his choices and morality. Â\n\nThis paragraphâs analysis revolves around Grenvilleâs inclusion of a host of different characters and outlooks - from Indigenous Australians to intransigent Colonial perspectives. I would emphasise the importance of juxtaposition between these different perspectives as it elucidates the values and beliefs underpinning each individualâs choices, especially during conflict. Â\n\nAlthough the core of the essay discusses internal conflicts, highlighting the connection between internal and external conflict would add another layer of complexity to your essay. Rookeâs conflict of conscience results in his permanent departure from Australia, and fleshing out the ramifications of dissent and opposition towards other Colonials is key in demonstrating your understanding of the complex and intertwined nature of conflict.\n\nParagraph 3: Through the detrimental implications of Rookeâs initial conflict avoidance, Grenvilleâs focus on his subsequent self-awareness to unite his morals and his actions highlights the strength of his character to resolve his internal conflicts to prevent further perpetration of injustice towards the Aboriginal population. Â\n\nHere, I am having a closer look at how Rooke's encounters with his conflicts of conscience and the repercussions of his actions in attempting to take a âmiddle-groundâ stance catalyse his development as an individual - in particular, how it solidifies his moral stance and his decision to act in a manner that reflects his beliefs. Â\n\nBy showing Tagaran how to load the gun but not how to fire it, or by accepting the navigator role but distancing oneself from the group, he endeavours to avoid conflict with either âsideâ. However, passivity is a stance within itself, and in the case of the treatment towards Indigenous Australians, Rookeâs silence in not rejecting the actions of other âBerewalgalâ inevitably enables injustice to continue. Â\n\nIt is only through his understanding that non-committal actions also incriminate him as a perpetrator that his choice to sacrifice his Colonial obligations for taking an active stance to fulfil his moral obligations comes to light. This reveals the role that internal conflicts may have in inciting powerful change and realisations in an individual. Â\n\nThe complexity of internal conflict can be difficult to discuss, but by using the quote provided in the prompt and asking yourself questions about the implications of the quote, we are able to delve into and construct a sophisticated understanding of The Lieutenant and of conflict itself.\n\nLSG-curated sample essay topics for The Lieutenant\n\nNow it's your turn!

Summary\n\nFlames is a bit of an out-there story right from the beginning: Levi is attempting to build a coffin for his sister Charlotte because the women in their family come back to life after dying. Neither of them is that close to dying - both are young adults. Charlotte doesnât really want a coffin so she runs away from home, as far as she can while still remaining in Tasmania at least, and Robbie Arnott takes us on this adventure through interweaving perspectives and rich imagery of his home island.\n\nSome of these perspectives are surprising and unexpected, ranging from a hardcore private investigator to a river god in the form of a water rat, but each of them earns their place in the story. Our job when studying this text is to follow these shifts in perspectives and make sense of how they contribute to the overall text. If youâre writing creatively, you may want to play around with this sort of structure as well in your piece.\n\n2. What Is Magical Realism?\n\nBefore we get stuck into the text itself, it might be useful to first discuss its genre. Magical realism books tend to be extremely confusing if youâre not familiar with the genre (and sometimes even when you are!). This is because authors in this genre will typically set their stories in the real world (in this case, in Tasmania), but theyâll add supernatural elements, which vary wildly from story to story.\n\nLetâs unpack the genre a bit more, in particular, what it involves and why itâs used.\n\nElements of Magical Realism\n\nThe most important element of magical realism is that it blends the real world with fantastical elements. In Flames, the most obvious example is gods: gods donât exist as far as we know, but they walk among humans and play key roles in this text. Less obvious examples of fantastical elements include the wombat farm at Melaleuca (fortunately nobody actually skins wombats) as well as the Oneblood tuna and (unfortunately!) the pet seals.\n\nThe fact that these examples are narrated as perfectly normal is another element of magical realism: the author usually operates as if the fantastical elements are perfectly real. We, as readers, enter a world where the existence of these magical things is taken for granted by the characters.\n\nPurpose of Magical Realism\n\nThis blurring of the lines between real and magical is primarily supposed to suspend our disbelief: we canât really be sure whatâs real about the novelâs world and what isnât. All we know is that in many respects, it looks like our own. Within this familiar setting, Arnott lets his own imagination run wild and leaves the reader to figure out the rest. This helps to create a sense of wonder, as if these elements could be real and as magical as described.\n\nThese elements also contribute to the story in other ways: in particular, they open up new possibilities for commentary. For example, the voice of the South Esk god is used to highlight the impacts of colonialism and the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that was brought with it.\n\nOther Magical Realism Books\n\nIf youâre liking the sound of this genre and/or if you enjoyed Flames, thereâs plenty more to discover in the way of magical realism. Itâs a hallmark of Latin American literature (Isabel Allende, Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez), and itâs also been picked up in Japan by the likes of Haruki Murakami. A prominent Australian example is Carpentaria by Alexis Wright.\n\n3. Themes\n\nDeath and Grief\n\nLetâs move more closely into Flames, starting with its central theme of death and grief. Itâs what defines this central point of tension between Levi and Charlotte throughout the novel, since it starts with their divergent responses to their motherâs death (and reincarnation etc.). Their divergent responses suggest that thereâs no one way to cope with death, and their fatherâs reaction on top of that introduces further complexity: he disappears from their lives altogether, ânot want[ing] to be close to them when they [died]â. Between the three of them, there are three very different expressions of grief.\n\nBut Edith McAllister is not the only death of significance in the novel. Another standout is the passing of Karlâs seal, after which he becomes haunted by âclicksâ; he subsequently leaves tuna-hunting behind. The death of the South Esk god is also explored as causing grief, this time in the form of divine emotional outpouring, âa cloudâs sorrowâ. Arnott is thus exploring many processes of grieving, from solitude and callousness to physical and emotional labour.\n\nFamily Relationships\n\nOutside of these moments of grieving, Arnott explores the background relationships between family members as well. Again, Levi and Charlotte are central to this. As siblings, they donât always see eye to eye: âLevi and I have never understood each otherâ. However, that does not diminish their love for each other, particularly as they were left alone after their motherâs death. Their father Jack again makes this dynamic more complicated: he sees an âunbridgeable gapâ between himself and Levi for example, but the omniscient third-person narrator in that chapter knows otherwise. Consider what difference it makes when Arnott writes in first person from within these relationships (as he does with Charlotte) versus when he writes in third person, observing from outside.\n\nWe also see interesting relationships between Karl and his daughter Nicola. Unlike the McAllisters, the two of them are remarkably close despite his ongoing grief for his seal: ânothing could match the blaze of love in her fatherâs smileâ.\n\nRomantic Relationships\n\nNicola crops up again under this theme, as she begins to navigate a relationship with Charlotte. In a book review for The Guardian, Sam Jordison argues that this is a bit trite, but we can think of it as one perspective on how relationships begin: organically and sincerely, and out of a desire to protect someone else. By contrast, the start of Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on something more artificial and manipulative, a âtiny sparkâ which he ignited in her mind.\n\nThis is bookended with romantic relationships that have come to an end, as explored through the eyes of the private investigator: her and her ex-husband, Graham Malik, have settled into something of an âecosystemâ. With these various beginnings and endings, Arnott shows how it can be natural - or supernatural - to fall in and out of love.\n\nColonisation\n\nFinally, this novel touches on the impacts of colonisation. Itâs a few quiet allusions here and there, but they are important: Arnott acknowledges the impact of colonisation on the natural landscape of his birthplace. He does this firstly through the eyes of the South Esk god, who observes the âfoul industriesâ of the âloud, pale apesâ when they first arrived on palawa and pakana land, the land we now know as Tasmania.\n\nArnott also explores colonisation through the eyes of Jack, who experiences racism when taking on the human form of an Aboriginal person. He wanted to learn more about how European colonisers were using fire, but he found âthey reacted poorly to his dark appearanceâ. Meanwhile, First Nations people in Tasmania were being âhunted in their own homelandâ, and he chooses not to intervene.\n\nAs immortal outside observers, their perspectives are the only ones in the novel that can really trace this history. Arnott might be including them so readers take his descriptions of nature with a grain of salt: even as we appreciate Australiaâs beautiful landscape, itâs worth acknowledging its custodians who have kept it that way for tens of thousands of years.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nSupernatural Creatures\n\nWeâve traced the major purposes of these deities already, but to reiterate them here these âgodsâ symbolise different parts of nature and the wonder Arnott derives from them. Although nature is already alive, these figures help it feel even more so. They also serve the important purpose of highlighting and acknowledging Tasmaniaâs colonial history, as well as the disconnect between humankind and nature.\n\nWater\n\nThe one natural element worth discussing as its own symbol is water. There are many bodies of water identified in the novel, from rivers and lakes to the ocean, and they each have their own significance. For example, rivers connect parts of the natural landscape while lakes (particularly Crater Lake) represent a getaway, solace, solitude and peace.\n\nThe ocean is the most complex of these symbols though: itâs all around the island of Tasmania, and it appears to be a vicious and unforgiving place filled with orcas and tunas the size of âmountainsâ. But itâs also a place that brings calm to Edith and Charlotte, and even Levi as a child. Arnott canvasses all of these different relationships to nature through the different manifestations of water. Water even exists as rain, which in the novelâs denouement represents a new beginning, a washing away of past tensions and conflicts.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nLevi\n\nâMy sister is struggling to cope with the lossâ¦I cannot allow her pain to continue.â\n\nâThey (Levi and Jack) were so alikeâÂ\n\nCharlotte\n\nâThe tears were flames, and they were coming from within Charlotte.â\n\nâLevi and I have never understood each otherâÂ\n\nGods\n\nâSome wore fur and feathers and watched over the creatures they resembledâ¦ Some, like a blood-hungry bird spirit he encountered deep in the southwest, were cruel. Most were calm, seeking only to care for the creatures and land that they felt drawn closest to.â\n\nâHe (the South Esk god) continued on, soothing his rage in a simple, humble way - by nipping screws out of the hull of an idle jetskiâ\n\nâLiving with humans did not workâ\n\n6.

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhen talking about the genre of this text, weâll definitely need to discuss magical realism. The question here is about how magical realism enriches or contributes to the story, so it might be worth breaking down the elements of magical realism and thinking through each of them one-by-one. The fact that this prompt is framed as a âhowâ question (one of the 5 types of essay questions) also means weâll have to bring in Arnott and how he chooses to tell the story.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nOne magical realism element Arnott adopts is the gods, who play a few roles symbolically in the novel, but there are other elements too: the seals, the flames, the cormorants and so on. Do these elements add as much as the gods, and if so, what are they adding?\n\nConsider also not just the elements as they appear, but also how Arnott is treating them. The fact that a lot of them are taken for granted as perfectly normal is in itself another genre element.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nInstead of talking about the elements too disparately or separately, I think a lot of them revolve around this central question of how humans relate to the earth and to one another. This will help connect my ideas to one another.\n\nParagraph 1: Elements of magical realism show how humans adversely impact nature\n\nNature is a huge part of the story: around the island, we see everything from beaches and rivers to âundulating moorlands of peat and buttongrassâ. Sometimes, these elements are personified as deities (e.g. South Esk god) â this is where genre comes in, since these deities are supernatural or âmagicalâ, though they are written to exist in our world.\n\nThese voices, made possible by magical realism, highlight the impact of human industry on the environment: for example the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that seeps into Tasmaniaâs waterways.\n\nEven Jack and Edithâs relationship could be seen as a metaphorical take on our incompatibility with nature: âliving with humans did not workâ.\n\nParagraph 2: At the same time, not all humans contribute equally to this pollution, and magical elements also facilitate commentary on this perspective\n\nBefore European colonisers arrived in Australia, the land had been tended to by the First Nations peoples for over 60,000 years - and pollution had been minimal. We cannot blame the entire human race equally for the deteriorating natural environment (see this Instagram post for an explanation!).\n\nThis is pointed out by the South Esk god: it is the âpale apesâ who are trying to âswamp[] over everythingâ.\n\nJack, the deity of flame, also recognises this, although he is far more complicit: âhe liked learning from the pale people more than he wanted to helpâ Aboriginal people.\n\nMagical realism adds this historical and political dimension to the narrative.\n\nParagraph 3: However, Arnottâs use of magical realism also shows possibilities for âidealâ relationships between humans, and between humans and nature\n\nThis paragraph gets to draw on some examples that arenât just the deities: the seals for example coexist really poetically with humans, âthe half of themselves they had been born withoutâ (these were inspired by dogs, by the way).\n\nPlus, even though Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on a lie, Arnott is able to use that as a point of contrast for the relationship between Charlotte and Nicola, born from Nicolaâs âdesire to helpâ, plus her âfast and firmâ attraction to Charlotte. This relationship is highly organic, and the âmagicalâ relationship between Charlotteâs parents proves a useful foil.\n\nEven though some textual elements are exaggerated because of genre, Arnott still manages to use magical realism to highlight what might be possible, inviting the reader to imagine possibilities for harmony between people and nature within their own worlds.\n\nFlames is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Introduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nWilliam Wordsworth was a British poet and primary co-founder of the Romantic literary movement. He strongly believed that the poetry of the nineteenth century was much too fast-paced and too mindless to be able to evoke a meaningful message to the reader. Contending that âall good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling,â he wished to pioneer Romanticism to create a genre of poetry that reminded the reader of the very essence of humanity.\n\nAs such, Wordsworth and fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge founded a new style of poetry through their co-written 1798 Lyrical Ballads, a collection of poetry which attempted to unite the human condition with the tranquility of nature.Â\n\nAs a resident of Englandâs picturesque Lake District, Wordsworth enjoyed becoming one with nature by wandering through the neighbouring hills, moors and lakeside views, while mentally composing poems inspired by its glorious elements.Â\n\nWilliam Wordsworth: Poems Selected by Seamus Heaney is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Key Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nNature\n\nThe Romantic movement of poetry was founded during the Industrial Revolution, a period in which people were growing farther from the serene comfort of nature and closer towards modern mechanisation and mass manufacturing. As such, a primary characteristic of Romantic poetry is nature, as poets attempted to remind humanity of its meditative respite, and the comfort it could provide in the backdrop of the pollution that accompanied the growing industrialisation of England.Â\n\nWordsworth was a pantheist and believed that God was within every aspect of the natural world. In addition to this, he categorised himself as an ardent âworshipper of natureâ. Thus, much of his poetry explores nature in a sacred and religious sense, presenting goodness and naturalness as synonymous - aptly displaying his belief of nature as a living, divine entity that could only to be ignored at humankindâs peril.Â\n\nEmotionalismÂ\n\nRomantic poetry subdues reason, intellect and the scientific truth in order to place more focus on the âtruth of the imaginationâ. As a result of the harsh rigidity and rationality of the Enlightenment era, all human sentiments, from melancholiness to hopefulness, were celebrated by Romantics as important instruments in poetry to remind the common people of sentimentality in a modern and intransigent era.Â\n\nAs Romantics believed that these feelings allowed one to look deeper into oneâs self, the theme of powerful emotions constructs the very essence of Romantic poetic poetry. As a result of this, rather than placing much importance on sense or sensibility, much of Wordsworthâs poems scrutinise his own effusion of feelings and the universal truths that these help him discover, speaking as the characteristic Romantic poet occupying a sentimental place of alienation.\n\nRebellion and Individualism\n\nThe Industrial Revolution oversaw the creation of distinct class differences between the extremely wealthy class of businessmen, and financially struggling workers and entrepreneurs. Poets, like all other artists, were forced to become increasingly independent and needed to rely on their unique vision and style in order to succeed in their gradually declining line of work. The Romantics subsequently began to view themselves as heroes who challenged and overcame the social challenges that arose; as champions of independence and self-awareness. As such, Romantic poetry often features characters or symbols of valiant heroism, as the poet acts as a visionary figure in his work, like a prophet telling of poetic self-awareness.Â\n\nThe Sublime\n\nIn accordance with their celebration of human emotions, Romantics also became fascinated with the literary conception of âthe sublimeâ, a mental state that Classical authors such as Longinus defined as âphysical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic greatnessâ that is of such magnificence that it cannot be measured.Â\n\nThe Romantics explored these extraordinary experiences in their poetry, describing the power of such sublime experiences on oneâs senses, mind and imagination. Wordsworth expressed in his essay that a sublime experience is what occurs when oneâs mind attempts to attain âsomething towards which it can make approaches but which it is incapable of attainingâ. For example, his biographical poem, The Prelude recounts his ascent of Mount Snowdon and the sublime emotions he experiences as a result of its powerful atmosphere.Â\n\nMany have viewed Wordsworthâs view of the sublime as the Romantic standard, as his poetry focuses equally on both the alluring and devastating aspects of such sublime experiences. His work focuses on the intertwined pleasure and terror that is generated as a result of such experiences, and how either end of the spectrum is ultimately beautiful and inspiring.\n\nContext is really important when engaging with a text in VCE English, so be sure to read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\n3. Poetic Analysis ExamplesÂ\n\nExample Passage 1\n\nBooks! 'tis a dull and endless strife:\n\nCome, hear the woodland linnet,\n\nHow sweet his music! on my life,\n\nThere's more of wisdom in it.\n\nAnd hark! how blithe the throstle sings!\n\nHe, too, is no mean preacher:\n\nCome forth into the light of things,\n\nLet Nature be your teacher.\n\nThis passage, taken from Wordsworthâs Tables Turned; An Evening Scene on the Same Subject, is a primary example of a poem displaying the Romanticsâ propensity and reverence for the natural landscape.Â Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nThe speaker of the poem contrasts the âendless strifeâ of book-learning to the spontaneous and liberal method of learning through interacting with nature. The description of the âwoodland [linnetâs]â song as âsweetâ music evokes an image of heavenly bliss associated with the charms hidden within nature. That âthereâs more of wisdom inâ such nature works in tandem with this, as the speaker asserts that the natural landscape is able to teach a lesson of a magnificence incomparable to the monotony of the âdullâ studying thorough book-learning.Â\n\nThe speakerâs evocation of âblitheâ emotions through sound is continued in the second stanza, in which âthe throstleâ delivers another divine âsongâ in an attempt to entice the reader. The speaker furthers his advocation for natural learning through a condemnation of route learning, as he attacks teachers of such as âmean preachersâ. The directly following use of a pun emphasises this contrast, as the âlight of thingsâ symbolises both the enlightenment that will accompany natureâs teaching, as well as the literal âlightâ of nature underneath the sun.Â\n\nThe final line of the passage summarises the speakerâs persuasion aptly, as the phrase, âlet nature be your teacherâ, rings similar to a passage which can be found in the Bible; the speaker thus implies that the natural world is the all-superior entity and source of knowledge that one should take lessons from.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe rhyme and the rhythmic beat of the poem give it a sound comparable to a nursery-rhyme. This works in tandem with the Romantic viewpoint that great poetic language should be simple, accessible and conversational; as understandable to the common people as a nursery rhyme is to a child. This similarity also works in accordance with the authorial message of the poem, that nature should be a universal âteacherâ, as nursery rhymes are often employed as enjoyable sing-songs that educate children on a moral level. As such, Wordsworth here strengthens his viewpoint through his poetic words; that nature should be a mentor to all.Â\n\nExample Passage 2\n\nâFor thou art with me here upon the banksÂ\n\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catchÂ\n\nThe language of my former heart, and readÂ\n\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lightsÂ\n\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little whileÂ\n\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,Â\n\nKnowing that Nature never did betrayÂ\n\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,Â\n\nThrough all the years of this our life, to leadÂ\n\nFrom joy to joyâ¦\n\nTherefore let the moonÂ\n\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;Â\n\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be freeÂ\n\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,Â\n\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be maturedÂ\n\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mindÂ\n\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,Â\n\nThy memory be as a dwelling-placeÂ\n\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,Â\n\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,Â\n\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughtsÂ\n\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,Â\n\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchanceâÂ\n\nIf I should be where I no more can hearÂ\n\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleamsÂ\n\nOf past existenceâwilt thou then forgetÂ\n\nThat on the banks of this delightful streamÂ\n\nWe stood together; and that I, so longÂ\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither cameÂ\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather sayÂ\n\nWith warmer loveâoh! with far deeper zealÂ\n\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,Â\n\nThat after many wanderings, many yearsÂ\n\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,Â\n\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to meÂ\n\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\n\nThis passage is taken from the final section from Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, a critical work in Wordsworthâs poetic career. Tracing the growth of his mind in different periods of time, the poem is a condensed, spiritual autobiography of Wordsworth himself as it views his younger self from the perspective of his older self, weighing the sense of âlossâ suffered against the belief that the years have brought him âabundant recompenseâ.Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nAfter recalling his experiences with nature over his formative and adult years, the speaker now addresses his younger sister Dorothy, as he gives her heartfelt advice about what he has learnt. Here, Dorothy becomes a ghost of his former self, as he hears âthe language of his former heartâ when she speaks and perceives his âformer pleasureâ in the âsoothing lights of [her] wild eyesâ.Â\n\nThe speaker depicts his loyalty to nature and its reflective loyalty to him, by the expression that ânature never did betray [his] heartâ that loves Dorothy, and this is the reason they have been living from âjoy to joyâ, lending nature a role of salvation.Â\n\nThe speaker then directly addresses the moon as a kind of separate entity, in order to ask it to bless his sister by shining on her âsolitary walkâ, so that when she is an adult her mind may become a âmansion for all lovely formsâ. This is an ode to the harshness of the society at the time, in which the privileged businessmen and factory owners possessed a monopoly over British wealth, and accompanying prejudices clouded social judgement. As such, the speaker expresses his desires for his beloved sister to be exempt from such hardship that he was once subjected to, so that she can enjoy âsweet sounds and memoriesâ without experiencing the vexations of an unrelenting human society.Â\n\nThe conclusion of the poem is cyclic, as it takes the speaker back to the âgreen pastoral landscapeâ of the beginning of his meditations. This symbolises the omnipresent timelessness of nature. As the speaker muses upon his âpast existenceâ, he wishes to convey his own reverence for nature to his beloved sister, as he expresses that she will not forget the âsteep woods and lofty cliffsâ upon which he first understood and respected nature.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe language utilised in this poem is lucid and natural, characteristic of Romantic poetry. The simplicity of the words chosen by Wordsworth effectively communicate the honesty of his own emotions towards nature. The elevated blank verse structure furthers this simplicity, as its familiar and easy tone is like that of a comfortable heartbeat or pulse that runs throughout oneâs body in a serene state of mind.Â\n\nUltimately, the unconstrained and liberating tone of the poem, in accordance with its free blank verse structure emphasises Wordsworthâs belief that nature is within our very selves. Just as the poem runs smoothly and continuously, akin to a human pulse, Wordsworth suggests that nature too runs within everyone as an incessant heartbeat, necessary in order to experience a âwarmerâ and âholierâ love for this universe.\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an All the Light We Cannot See essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nTaking a look at this prompt, the first thing to note is that it is theme-based. Specifically asking about the line that separates civilised and uncivilised behaviour within the novel, this prompt focuses directly on the theme of human behaviours and how you ultimately interpret the fine line (i.e. seamless, difficult, changing, manipulative) between such ideas. Fundamentally, you have to discuss how this theoretical line drawn between the contrasting behaviours is explored within the novel in various ways throughout Doerrâs examination of humanity.Â\n\nThe question tag of Discuss is the most flexible type of prompt/topic you will receive, providing you with a broad and open-ended route to pretty much discuss any ideas that you believe fit within the promptâs theme of uncivilised and civilised behaviour. Although this may seem hard to know where to start, this is where Step 2: Brainstorm, comes into play. You can read through LSGâs Question Tags You Need To Know section (in How To Write A Killer Text Response) to further familiarise yourself with various ways to tackle different prompt tags.\n\nIf youâre not sure what it is meant by âtheme-based prompt,â take a look atThe 5 Types of Essay Prompts.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nA fundamental aspect of writing a solid Text Response essay is being able to use a diverse range of synonyms for the keywords outlined in the prompt. Our keywords are in bold. When you are brainstorming, if any words pop into your head, definitely list them so you can use them later. You may want to have a highlighter handy when unpacking prompts so you can do just this!!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nHow people have grown up determines the civil and uncivilised behaviours shown by individuals of different backgrounds and childhoods\n\n- Bastian is symbolised as the eagle that circles the youth camp, which is an uncivilised/unwanted form of hawk-like behaviour. This compares to Fredrick's love of birds as a young boy which makes him a softer character.\n\n- Bernd had âno friendsâ as a child - showing his isolated past - which could be described as the reason he leaves his father and goes off to join the Hilter Youth âjust like the other boys.â (find this analysis in the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ)\n\nThere is a fine line that Doerr draws between the stereotypes of women and their ability to remain civilised despite being suppressed by uncivil livelihoods and experiences.\n\n- Jutta is characterised as a strong and independent woman instead of the traditional âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ. Society expects most women to stand on that side of human behaviour and representation however she defies this.\n\nThe strength of women to cross/overcome the line of uncivilised behaviour is significant within the sexual abuse and misconduct driven by soldiers. Can remain true to oneself despite the horrific behaviours a woman faces.\n\n- The role of women on the homefront (i.e. Fredrickâs Mother) highlights the stark contrast between men fighting and thinking about the âmen they killedâ and mothers who put on a âfake smile to appear braveâ (the line between barbaric behaviours of many soldiers and caring/loving behaviours of those on the homefront) - women and their sacrifices is an important topic here\n\nIt is oneâs ability to adapt to change that draws the line between civil and uncivilised behaviours.\n\n- Marie Laureâs ability to look past being a âblind girlâ, and move on from this hardship. She adapts to the âchanging timesâ around her despite others who are suppressed in such an environment (e.g. Etienne and his âdreadâ).\n\nThe game of flying couch is a symbol of escaping the uncivilised world around them (metaphorical line of the human imagination).\n\n- Werner is predominantly overwhelmed by the world around him, which reflects his inability to no longer ask questions as he did as a young boy. Instead, he succumbs to the uncivilised world of death and destruction as he is unable to change.Â\n\nSymbolic use of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in epilogue - symbolises his loss of perspective and wonder of the world,\n\nUltimately it is this line that makes the human existence so unique\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nAfter having brainstormed all the ideas that came to mind, Iâll be approaching the essay prompt with the following contention.Â\n\nIn a world where society is grounded by behaviours both civil and uncivil, there is a clear distinction between humanity's response and representation of these behaviours.\n\nComing up with a clear contention allows you to put together a cohesive and strong essay that answers all aspects of the prompt question.Â\n\nNow, onto developing our topic sentences for each paragraph!\n\nP1: Embedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative*, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life.\n\n*A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling technique Doerr uses to portray events out of chronological order.Â\n\nP2: Encompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them.\n\nP3: In essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nThe art of recognising the ephemera of the human existence is painted by Anthony Doerrâs All the Light We Cannot See as a fine line between behaviours of civilisation and extreme brutality (1). In the inordinate scheme of history, Doerr fosters the dichotomy between those who remain socially aware and others who are marred by desolation as a reflection on one's past. Further subverting the traditional depiction of women in a âwar storyâ, the strength of women is established as a key turning point for individuals to escape barbaric behaviours and cross the line to civilisation. Fundamentally, however, it is the overall response to change that crafts human behaviours that Doerr underpins within society (2).\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(1) it is important to include synonym variation in your opening sentence to ensure that it does not look like you have just copied the prompt and placed it on your page. This idea should be carried out throughout your essay - vary your words and try not to repeat anything, this will ensure you are clear and concise!\n\n(2) In order to improve the flow of your writing, the final topic sentence of your introduction can be a concluding statement on why/how the topic is OVERALL expressed within the novel. When you formulate your contention, it is not enough just to state it, you must also provide reasoning as to why you are writing from this point of view or how you came to this conclusion. For example, my final topic sentence here is a concluding sentence about how I believe a fine line between uncivilised and civil behaviour has an influence throughout the entire novel and Doerrâs intention, oneâs response to change. As you read on, youâll also see that this sentence relates to my final paragraph, thus linking together ideas throughout my essay.\n\nEmbedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life. The initial illustration of the âsmokestacks humeâ and the âblack and dangerousâ imagery (3) of the war paints a clear picture of the destruction and trauma that individuals have lived amongst, thus why people were âdesperate to leaveâ. Empathising with an âold woman who cuddles her toddlerâ on the streets, Doerr laments how young individuals who end up âsurg[ing] towards one cause,â which this toddler may similarly grow up to do in the Hitler Youth, directly reflects the âintense maliceâ of their childhood. This idea that oneâs past affects the future behaviours of a generation is further captured within the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ (4), which outlines how Berndâs upbringing with âno friendsâ promotes him to âjust leaveâ, in order to experience something new, despite knowing this something new would bring unjust decisions into his life. Becoming âjust like the other boysâ, Doerr suggests that the line between civil and uncivil behaviours is so thin (5) that a mere need to escape oneâs past is enough to create feelings of negativity and at worst death. Encapsulating the darkness that prevails over such individuals, the symbolism of Bastianâs âsharp eyesâ (6) poetically describes the eagle that circles the youth camp where Doerr seeks to paint a metaphorical cruel depiction of Bastian as a harmful hawk. Underpinning the fine line between human behaviour, Fredrickâs âlove of birdsâ is âso beautiful[ly]â representative of his respectful nature and approach to life while Bastianâs immersion in âthe self interest of the worldâ ultimately explains how his fallacious behaviour towards others is embodied by his environment within the war. Overall, the behaviours displayed by humanity are a reflection of past experiences and how they shape the individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) Imagery is a key aspect of All the Light We Cannot See and goes hand in hand with the vast symbolism Doerr uses within his novel. When including imagery, it is great to include a few related quotes; however, you must then ensure you analyse and delve into how this technique (imagery) demonstrates the idea you are writing about. In this case, the imagery of the chimneys and foggy/dirty air illustrates the desolate environment individuals lived in during the war.\n\n(4) This chapter is something not many students analyse or touch on so if youâre looking to add some spice to your writing I would definitely take a look and see what you can extract from some of those more unique and nuanced chapters!\n\n(5) Referencing the âfine lineâ continually throughout your essay ensures that you are staying on track and not talking about topics away from the prompt.Â\n\n(6) Symbolism is very important in All the Light We Cannot See. The use of the quote âsharp eyesâ, really shows that you have considered not only how Doerr simply explores the behaviour of each character but also the physical interpretations of how individuals may demonstrate a certain persona within the novel. This focus on character description on top of dialogue adds extra layers to your writing.Â\n\nEncompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them. Instead of characterising Jutta as a âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ, whom the soldier will âfight and die forâ, Doerr proffers the unconventional humanisation of women on the home front to pay tribute to the power of staying true to oneself (7). Despite facing the barbaric reality of âsex crazed torturersâ, Doerr illuminates Juttaâs capacity to âlook them in the eyeâ rather than shy away from them as a meditation on her own morals of (8) âwhat is rightâ. The tragic nature (9) of such abuse is specifically chronicled by Doerr to concatenate (10) the continual brave behaviours Jutta portrays even when succumbing to the line that attempts to draw women away from strength and independence. Further referencing her desire to âlock away memoriesâ of the past in her life after the war, the novel posits the importance of women during a period of inordinate history as a powerful force that remained civil even in times of âabsolute blacknessâ. From the perspective of Fredrickâs mother, Doerr seeks to display how her âfake smile to appear braveâ outlines how many mothers and women had to remain strong for their children, such as Fredrick with brain damage, even though they were so close to falling into a world of sorrow and isolation. A clear segregation between soldiers who thought about âthe men they killedâ and women who were made to âfeel complicit in an unspeakable crimeâ (11) they did not commit overall affirms the sacrifices women made during the war and without such sacrifices and strength the thin line between behavioural acts would be broken.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(7) Here I have included an analysis of Doerrâs message - what he is trying to say or show within his novel. Ultimately an author has a message they seek to share with the world. Providing your own interpretation of certain messages the author may be attempting to send to his readers adds real depth to your writing, showing that you are not only considering the novel itself but the purpose of the author and how this novel came to explore the fundamental ideas of the essay prompt.\n\n(8) This quote directly relates to the keyword: civilised behaviour. Finding quotes that are also specific to your prompt is crucial to producing an essay that flows and has meaning.Â\n\n(9) The use of adjectives within the essay paints the picture of whether an act is civil or uncivil which is ultimately what we are attempting to discuss from the prompt. Here the phrase âtragic natureâ, underpins the essence of unjust behaviours shown by the soldiers.\n\n(10) Concatenate - link/connect ideas together\n\n(11) Comparing aspects within the novel is a great way to show your understanding and how the same theme or idea can be shown in many different ways.Â\n\nIn essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world. Established by Marie Laureâs characterisation as a âblind girlâ who can âproject anything onto the black screen of her imaginationâ, Doerr illuminates her ability to adapt to the âchanging timesâ around her. She is seen to be âcarried away by reveriesâ rather than a plethora of voices who âforgo all comfortsâ and âeat and breathe nationâ. Through the chapter and make-believe game âflying couchâ (12), Marieâs nature to âsurrender firearmsâ with Etienne in their imagination is a symbolic adoption to escape the world around them, hence the uncivilised society they are learning to live in. Doerrâs congruent imagery of Etienneâs changing voice of âdreadâ to âvelvetyâ as he becomes intertwined within âMarieâs braveryâ underpins the ability for individuals to seamlessly cross the line from a lack of cultured behaviour to a world of hope and prosperity. Contrasting this, however, Werner, an individual who was initially curious about âhow the world worksâ, is so âoverwhelmed by how quickly things are changing around [him]â that his âinterest in peaceâ is stripped away and no longer exists due to his inability to change with a changing world. Doerr, therefore, laments the transmogrification of his character as a reflection of his uncivil thoughts and ideals as a soldier, ultimately resulting in his loss of ability to ask questions. This idea places emphasis on Volkheimer receiving Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in the epilogue (13) where the translation of the bookâs title âFragenâ - to âaskâ in English - is symbolic of the moment Werner decided to âwork, join, confess, dieâ he immediately lost the open mind and curiosity he once had. Ultimately, the dichotomy between these two lives and their opposing character transformations resembles the line between remaining calm or acting out of haste when subject to change.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(12) Analysing not only the game but the whole meaning behind chapters and why Doerr has given them certain names is an interesting avenue to take. Here âflying couchâ not only underpins the imagination of Marie Laure but also symbolises freedom and bravery within just the name itself.\n\n(13) The analysis and evidence used from the epilogue is a crucial part of this paragraph and is significant to Doerrâs novel. Unpacking All the Light We Cannot See, there is a lot of evidence and juicy ideas you can draw from the beginning and end of the novel. Here I have almost analysed the meaning of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ to the bone; however, this adds a lot of depth to your writing as Iâm sure your ultimate goal is to make your essays as unique as possible?!\n\nAs a project of humanism, Doerr seeks to portray a fine segregation in people's behaviours as the microcosm (14) of what makes the human existence so unique. Following the journeys of individuals who even âsee a century turnââ the novel displays how oneâs past has an immense influence on how their future values, actions and behaviours grow and develop. Further subverting the stereotypical representation of women living in a war, Doerr establishes an acknowledgment of their roles and strength in the face of cruel situations. Ostensibly, it is the human capacity to adapt to change that marks the difference between what is just and unjust in a society that weighs both on a very unstable scale.Â\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(14)Â Microcosm - a community, place or situation regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our All the Light We Cannot See Prompts blog post.

Historical Context\n\nTo understand the works of Franklin and Ziegler, we are going to take a look at the historical contexts in which the texts were written. By doing this, weâll establish a proper understanding of some of the language and concepts that you might have experienced in class. The three specific historical contexts that we will address are life in 1950s London, uncovering the enigma of DNA as well as 19th-century rural life in Australia. As you continue to read this study guide, you may wish to refer back to this section if you find some of the terminologies and references confusing!\n\nLife in 1950s London (Photograph 51)\n\nPhotograph 51 is set during the 1950s in London. This was a challenging time for everyone, largely due to Britainâs impaired economy after the war, as well as the financial obligations of the nation to the United States. An iconic local feature of this time was the fact that the government encouraged everyone in the nation to grow food for themselves and their communities. Everywhere you looked, land was being used to farm crops! Indeed, people would grow food everywhere that they could because government rations were strictly enforced and the 1950s was a decade marked by the struggle for parents to find enough food for themselves and their children. This was a difficult situation in which to live and work. However, in this time after the Second World War, Britain experienced changes on a scale never experienced by the country before. The war had cost Britain its status as a nation of monumental power, and in the 1950s the nation was looking to rebuild itself. This was a period of enthusiasm and optimism, in which many technological and scientific developments were made. Computers became more sophisticated, and humanity deeply desired to explore the workings of the world.\n\nNonetheless, during this time of hope and progress, women were remarkably undervalued, and female professionals were often treated with contempt. We are provided with a snapshot of what this looked like in Photograph 51. As a Jewish woman in the 1950s, Rosalind Franklin is depicted as a target for prejudice in the world around her. For example, she is not permitted to dine with her male colleagues at lunch, which renders her unable to engage in meaningful conversations with her colleagues and debate about their research and ideas. Additionally, despite the fact that she is just as qualified as Wilkins, he continually ignores her qualifications and achievements. We see this as he refers to her with the patronising nickname âRosyâ, which underscores the reality that he sees her as inferior to him. It is evident that the professional world was a challenging place for women and minorities during the 1950s in London. However, Rosalind Franklin was willing to persist with her important scientific work in this formidable social setting.\n\n19th Century Rural Life in Australia (My Brilliant Career)\n\nMy Brilliant Career was published in 1901. This was the year when the Commonwealth of Australia was formed, as the colonies of Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales united as one nation. The text is set in areas around Goulburn in Australia in the 1890s, which is around 195 kilometres - or a two-hour drive - in the South-West direction of Sydney. To put it bluntly: Australia was a challenging place to live in in the 1890s. Take a moment to consider the harsh realities of life in this time and place. During this time, most of Australia was a rural environment and this was an era in which Australians were confronted with drought, economic hardships and high unemployment rates. Indeed, the period of prosperity during the 1850s gold rush was, unfortunately, coming to a close, international investment in Australia was devastatingly declining and the price of wool and wheat was dropping at a dangerous pace. The dire economic situation was certainly not helped by the long drought, which created a distressing situation for the agricultural industry. As we see in the text, Sybyllaâs father is a dairy farmer, and her family lived through this unbearable summer heat, the harsh drought and the pain caused by dying livestock. Miles Franklin convincingly uses Sybylla and her family to illustrate the extent to which the adversity of the time had an impact on everyone and the fact that nobody could escape it.\n\nDuring this period, many women had to take up jobs to support their families, due to the turbulent economic times. Having said that, this was a challenging environment for a woman to pursue a career. Marriage was seen as the only appropriate venture for a woman, and women were expected to marry as soon as they were able to. It was basically unthinkable for a woman to work and pursue a career unless she was working while she waited to be able to depend upon a husband for support. Those who chose not to marry were treated poorly by the world around them. In particular, women could be traded and bartered as labour, and we see when Sylblla becomes a governess to repay her familyâs debt.\n\nDuring this challenging time, it was becoming increasingly common for young women in Australia to publish books, with Miles Franklin being one of them. Nevertheless, Miles Franklin - officially born Stella Franklin - ensured that âMissâ was excluded from her name on the cover of her text. Presumably, she did not want her readers to assume that My Brilliant Career was written by a woman, as this may have harmed sales. Despite this, it is undeniable that social perspectives surrounding gender roles were gradually shifting towards permitting women greater rights within society. For instance, women were eventually granted the right to vote in federal elections in Australia when the Franchise Act was passed in 1902. We see such a progressive attitude represented in the text through Sybylla. Despite the social expectations placed upon her, Sybylla has aspirations for her future. As part of her aspirations, she must choose between the traditional route of marriage to Harry Beecham or her plans to pursue a career. Through this, we see that Miles Franklin welcomes the potentiality for increased social freedom for women to pursue meaningful occupations. In defiance of what society expected of her, she wanted to do something with her life and have a meaningful career! Much like many women of the day in rural Australia, pursuing such a path was no easy task and she faced much opposition.\n\n2. Plot Summaries\n\nWeâre now going to take a quick look at the plots of My Brilliant Career and Photograph 51. However, I cannot overemphasise the importance of setting aside the time to read these texts in detail and annotate them for yourself. You may wish to use these summaries to refresh your memory about the plot, or to stay on track if you get lost or confused while you read! Weâll provide you with a general overview of what happens, with a particular focus on the key events in each text.\n\nSummary: My Brilliant Career\n\nMy Brilliant Career is an Australian literary classic by Stella 'Miles' Franklin which is set in rural New South Wales in the late nineteenth century. The story is presented in an autobiographical format and depicts the life and travels of Sybylla Melvyn and her family. The novel is written in a fairly free-flowing format, which Sybylla unapologetically explains is the result of her life being unstructured and lacking a plot. At times you may be frustrated with Sybyllaâs pessimism and cynicism. At other times, you may hold back tears as you reflect on the adverse circumstances she faces as she pursues her goals and strives to find purpose in her life.\n\nThe novel commences with Sybylla and her family living in Bruggabong. Sybylla is content with her life here, with the freedom to roam around and ride horses as she pleases. However, as the first chapter comes to a close, we are told that Sybyllaâs father, Dick Melvyn, intends to sell his stations and move his family to Possum Gully. He hopes that Possum Gully will present him with greater financial opportunities through trading farm animals. Sybylla is frustrated by the move and perceives her familyâs new home as boring and monotonous. At the same time, life is hard for her mother, who becomes increasingly critical of Sybylla who seems to be developing into a rebellious child. Dick inflicts a great deal of pain upon his family, as he spends too much time in town, loses money with every sale and becomes an alcoholic. The drought certainly doesnât simplify matters, with the scorching heat taking a toll on Sybylla, her family and their animals.\n\nEventually, we learn that Sybyllaâs grandmother has decided to take Sybylla to live with her in Caddagat. Sybylla enthusiastically agrees and celebrates the opportunity to experience life in a different location away from the difficulties of Possum Gully. Whilst in Caddagat, she lives with Grandma Bosser, Aunt Helen and Uncle Jay-Jay. During her time there, several men approach Sybylla with an interest in marrying her. The first is Everard Grey, a wealthy lawyer from Sydney with a keen interest in the performing arts. She is denied the opportunity to travel with him and he neglects her upon hearing this news. Frank Hawden, a farmhand to the family, is attracted to Sybylla, but she sharply rejects him due to his unsophisticated demeanour. Finally, she meets Harold Beecham of Five-Bob Downs. They enjoy spending time together and he brings out Sybyllaâs playful side. They eventually become engaged. However, Sybylla never intends to marry him and only agrees to the engagement on the condition that it is kept a secret between the two of them. She shares to her audience that she intends to break off the engagement as a means of stirring up and confronting Harold. Eventually, Harold is forced to leave Five-Bob Downs due to his financial misfortune resulting in the loss of his property. However, he and Sybylla agree to maintain their engagement and commit to marrying after a few years. Having said that, Sybylla never really has any intention of marrying Harold, for she views marriage as restrictive and unnecessary controlling of her freedom to pursue her own life.\n\nShortly after Haroldâs departure, Sybylla is confronted with the news that her fatherâs debt to Peter MâSwat means that she will be required to travel to Barneyâs Gap to work as a governess for the MâSwat children. It would be an understatement to say that Sybylla is dissatisfied with this new state of affairs! She absolutely hates working for the MâSwat family! She finds that the house is filthy, the children are disobedient and she has very minimal personal space. All she wants is to go back and live with Grandma Bossier and Aunt Helen. However, her mother denies her this privilege, for she must repay her fatherâs debt. The experience at Barneyâs Gap becomes so bad for her that she develops an illness due to the emotional strain that she experiences. Accordingly, Mr. MâSwat sends her back home to Possum Gully to be with her family.\n\nSybylla hardly receives a warm welcome from her parents. Her mother continually treats her as ungrateful, and her fatherâs drinking has had a significant impact on his demeanour. Her younger sister, Gertie, is sent off to live in Caddagat, and Sybylla feels as if Grandma Bossier, Aunt Helen and Uncle Jay-Jay have forgotten about her. To make matters worse, she feels as if Harold Beecham, who has been unable to return to Five-Bob Downs, is falling in love with Gertie. Eventually, Harold travels to Possum Gully. Sybylla is expecting her to ask Dick for permission to marry Gertie. But to her surprise, he actually intends to ask Sybyllla if she will marry him, even though she made it clear through her letters that she had no intention of doing so. For fear of hurting him and due to her view of marriage as restrictive, she rejects Harold again and sends him on his way.\n\nAnd thatâs basically the story! Sybylla concludes with some reflections on her position and purpose in life. She sees her purpose as completing the monotonous tasks that nobody wants to complete and she is thankful for the opportunity to earn her living through hard labour. Overall, we know that her ambition was to become an author, and this book is her final product as she writes about her various experiences.\n\nSummary: Photograph 51\n\nPhotograph 51 is a play by Anna Ziegler which tells the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA. The title takes its name from the photograph taken by Raymond Gosling and Rosalind Franklin at Kingâs College in 1952. The play has been constructed by Ziegler with a bit of artistic license, and she herself admits that she has modified timelines, altered facts and events, and recreated characters. If we take a step back and look at the big picture, we have a great representation of events that makes some bold statements about injustice within the scientific community and society at large.\n\nIt is important to mention that this play is full of characters who break the fourth wall - a performance convention in which we usually imagine that there is a wall that separates characters from the audience when we watch a television show, movie or play. Ziegler has deliberately constructed this play in a manner where the characters that feature in the play provide commentary on the events to the audience. And this is how we start, with Rosalind directly speaking to the audience alongside Wilkins, Watson, Crick, Caspar and Gosling. Rosalind shares that the play will be about âpowerfulâ scientists accomplishing incredible feats. Shortly after this, our story begins (with frequent interruptions from the male scientists who want to bicker with each other and give their own commentary on the events).\n\nRosalind arrives at Kingâs College in London to work in the field of genetics. However, much to her surprise and dissatisfaction, she is told that she will be working on uncovering the structure of DNA. She also learns that she will be working with a doctoral student, Gosling, under the direction of Wilkins. Wilkins and Rosalind clearly donât get along, and they are often fighting about something! Meanwhile, Gosling is clearly lower in the chain of hierarchy and awkwardly tries to have a say in matters.\n\nNow, pay attention to this part, because it will be important for the end. Shortly after her arrival at Kingâs College, Rosalind goes to see a production of Shakespeareâs comedy, The Winterâs Tale. Ziegler doesnât get into the details, but basically, this play features King Leontes and Hermione, his wife. Leontes murders Hermione upon suspecting her of unfaithfulness. In The Winterâs Tale, Leontes is able to pray Hermione back to life! Why is this significant to Photograph 51? Just remember for now that Rosalind canât seem to remember who played Hermione in the London production, whilst she can recall who played Leontes. We may say that this represents the misogyny that Rosalind has internalised after facing a life of sexism from the world around her.\n\nAs Rosalind and Gosling work closely on taking photographs of DNA, Gosling urges her to go home and rest on several occasions. She refuses, as she wants to persist in her work! He also pleads with her to be careful around the beam, but she is reluctant to listen. It is clear that she disregards her health and well-being because she is fixated on the task at hand.\n\nWe are introduced to two other scientists, Watson and Crick, who are also competing in the race to discover the structure of DNA. Another character, Caspar, is introduced around this time. Heâs a PhD student who is captivated by Rosalindâs work and writes to her for assistance with his research. He eventually finishes his PhD and obtains a fellowship at Kingâs College where he develops a close relationship with Rosalind.\n\nOver the course of the play, Wilkins works progressively closer with Watson and Crick, and eventually shares Rosalindâs Photograph 51 with them. This image, having been captured and developed by Rosalind and Gosling, was crucial to their discovery of the double helical structure of DNA. Watson and Crick are also able to access Rosalindâs unpublished paper which details all of her findings.\n\nRosalind and Caspar are having dinner together and Rosalind admits to the audience that she has feelings for Caspar. However, she does not share this information with him. During this time, Rosalind has some pain in her stomach and it is revealed that she has cancer, with two tumours in her ovaries. It is likely that this came about due to her close work with X-rays. She becomes very sick and eventually dies at the age of thirty-seven.\n\nWe are informed that Watson, Crick and Wilkins all receive the Nobel prize for their work on uncovering the structure of DNA. Meanwhile, Rosalind receives no credit, even though her research was what helped them with their breakthrough.\n\nIn the final moments of the play, Rosalind and Wilkins talk about The Winterâs Tale. Wilkins shares that he saw her entering the theatre on the day when she saw the play, but he decided not to enter with her. He regrets this and it is clear that he has lived a life full of regret. Wilkins wishes he could bring Rosalind back to life, just as Leontes does with Hermione in Shakespeareâs play. However, he regrets that this is not possible and must carry on his life with guilt and regret for the decisions he has made and the way that he has treated Rosalind.\n\n3. Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nThrough discussing themes, motifs and key ideas, weâll gain a clearer understanding of some super important ideas to bring out in your essays. Remember that, when it comes to themes, thereâs a whole host of ways you can express your ideas - but this is what Iâd suggest as the most impressive method to blow away the VCAA examiners. Weâll be adhering to the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy. While this study guide doesnât go into too much detail about using LSGâs CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy, Iâd highly recommend you familiarise yourself with it by reading LSG'sHow To Write A Killer Comparative.\n\nCONVERGENT: Yearning\n\nWithin Photograph 51 and My Brilliant Career, we are presented with characters with profound ambitions to overcome adverse circumstances. Indeed, both texts featured major and minor characters, who yearn to overcome their circumstances and make the most of their unfortunate situations. At the conclusion of My Brilliant Career, Sybylla questions the nature of 'vain ambition'. She reflects on the inevitability of death, and that all will die, regardless of oneâs status as a 'king or slave'. Ultimately, Sybylla wants to be 'true' to herself, and in striving to do so, she finds contentment. Likewise, Rosalind is satisfied with 'painstakingly' trying to accomplish success by discovering the truth in her work. She is highly diligent, for she wants to discover the truth, and she will not permit herself to make a mistake. In doing so, she '[pays] attention to every detail'. However, as part of this, Watson and Crick are able to take advantage of her, and ultimately achieve success at her expense.\n\nRather insightfully, Caspar reflects that 'the things we want but canât have are probably the things that define us'. This reflects the reality for characters across both texts. In particular, Rosalind has a deep 'yearning' for various things throughout Photograph 51. This is not strictly for success in her research, for she admits that she yearns for friendships, peace, to be able to sleep well at night and for a deeper relationship with Caspar. Rosalind works diligently with her research, admitting that she doesnât believe in 'laziness'. She regularly stays up all night, which likely contributes to her significant health complications. At the same time, this has an impact on her ability to form meaningful relationships with the people around her. Ultimately, she is not able to attain any of her aspirations, for her life is cut short by her unfortunate death. Likewise, Crick acknowledges that his ambitions in the scientific community have negatively impacted his relationship with his wife. Whilst he may have started out with the desire to 'support [his] family, to do science, to make some small difference in the world', it is clear that he became overwhelmed with his desire for success, and this has cost him dearly.\n\nOne of the most significant characters with aspirations in My Brilliant Career is Dick Melvyn. He clearly possesses great ambition at the beginning of the text, which motivates him to move his family from Bruggabrong to Possum Gully. However, this ambition for financial prosperity turns him into a man who is 'a slave of drink', as well as someone who is overall 'careless' and 'bedraggled in his personal appearance'. Indeed, his ambition has taken a challenging toll on him and the life of his family. Unlike Dick Melvyn, who has been harshly impacted by his ambition for success, the MâSwat family seem to be genuinely supportive of their children, and others outside of their family. This is evident in their care for the Melvyn family in their time of financial need. It is evident that a desire for success and 'the possession of money' does not necessarily lead to ruin.\n\nDIVERGENT: Selflessness\n\nThe leading characters in My Brilliant Career and Photograph 51 differ in the extent to which they display selflessness as they approach life. Whilst Sybyllaâs perception of her circumstances may not be entirely accurate, we can see that she approaches her despairing circumstances with ultimate altruism that leads her to neglect her own desires and focus on how she can be useful in serving the needs of others. At the conclusion of the text, Sybylla sees that she is most suited to 'wait about common public-houses to look after [her] father when he is inebriated'. She seems to be content to submit to her circumstances in order to look after the needs of her family. In contrast, Rosalind seems to be limited in her capacity to discern the needs of others, and the fact that others also require resources to c"
