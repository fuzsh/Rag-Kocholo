        "text": "Sleep Number is known for their adjustable mattresses that help you find the exact level of firmness you need for a restful night’s sleep. Their mattresses are actually air beds that hook up to a hose and pump, so you can inflate or deflate the bed to your exact comfort level.\n\nSleep Number gets its name because each user gets their own “Sleep Number” —a number between 1 and 100 that indicates how soft or hard you like your bed. The hope is once you find your perfect sleep number, you know exactly how your mattress should feel to enjoy deep sleep.\n\nWhile Sleep Number is definitely innovative, the technical aspects of it — along with the fact it is indeed an air mattress (though intended for permanent use) — means it comes with a set of common complaints. This article will dive into some of the most frequent customer criticisms, then provide an alternative mattress that might address the issue. Here are the issues and beds we’re including:\n\nThe Mattress Sagging: Our Recommended Alternative – Saatva\n\nBeing Uncomfortable: Our Recommended Alternative – Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid\n\nBreakdowns and Malfunctions: Our Recommended Alternative – Bear Elite Hybrid\n\nBad Customer Service: Our Recommended Alternative – Nectar\n\nPrice: Our Recommended Alternative – DreamCloud Original\n\nThe Five Most Common Sleep Number Problems\n\nThese are the issues we frequently encountered when researching if Sleep Number is right for you. They all come from reviews written by customers who purchased a Sleep Number bed.\n\n#1 – Trench Effect\n\nThe most prominent complaint throughout all Sleep Numbers reviews was talk about the “trench effect,” which is when the mattress sags in the middle and one or both people on the bed slide into it. Because most Sleep Number beds come with two air chambers (so each person can adjust their side to their liking), if one side is significantly more firm or soft than the other, the bed is uneven and is susceptible to sag in the middle.\n\nWe think a good alternative solution to this problem would be the Saatva. An innerspring mattress with two layers of coils, the Saatva has a ton of support to keep the bed from sagging.\n\nOur Favorite Mattress That Won’t Sag – Saatva\n\nRead more in our full Saatva mattress review, or click here for the best deal. You can also see our list of the best mattresses that won’t sag for other options.\n\n#2 – Comfort\n\nPeople have also complained about Sleep Number beds being uncomfortable. Some talk about the bed deflating too often and others say it simply feels like a glorified air mattress. Also, depending on the model you receive, some Sleep Numbers don’t come with a cushioned mattress pad, making the bed feel extra firm.\n\nFor anyone worried about comfort, we recommend the Brooklyn Signature Hybrid. Up top, there’s cushy memory foam for pressure relief at the shoulders, hips, and lumbar region. However, the coils at the bottom of the mattress ensure that there’s plenty of support for your spine to stay neutrally aligned. Even though it’s not an adjustable mattress, its winning combination of comfort and support should appeal to a wide range of folks.\n\nOur Most Comfortable Mattress – Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid\n\nRead more in our full Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress review, or click here to get the best deal. You can also read about other options in our picks for the most comfortable mattress.\n\n#3 – Breakdowns and Malfunctions\n\nBecause there’s a decent amount of setup and technology that comes with a Sleep Number — including a hose, pump, and remote to work the adjustable air chamber — the bed is naturally susceptible to breakdowns, especially air deflation. People also spoke about the mattress cover itself falling apart after a few years. While the site has a good support section with videos and content to help troubleshoot issues, many unhappy campers only spoke about how things would break down every few years.\n\nIf you’re looking for a mattress with lots of luxurious touches, but without the potential technical mishaps of Sleep Number, check out the Bear Elite Hybrid. As the luxury upgrade of the Bear Original, its bells and whistles include not one, but two layers of coils (one for general support and another for increased edge support), as well as an optional cover (available for a fee) made of both phase change material and Celliant. These materials are incredibly cooling and should help you keep a low temperature at night. Overall, the Elite Hybrid is supportive yet soft, coming in at a 6 out of 10 on our mattress firmness scale.\n\nOur Favorite Durable Mattress – Bear Elite Hybrid\n\nIts Optional Cover Is Made of Celliant and Phase Change Material\n\nBear Elite Hybrid Mattress\n\nThe Bear Elite Hybrid is Bear's “ultra-luxurious” model with a traditional mattress feel, plus advanced cooling and support technology.

The first point, that came up a lot, was issues with their “100-night sleep trial.” Apparently, if you want to return your bed before the 100 nights is up, this guarantee only includes the mattress itself, not the bed frame or additional accessories (the website’s fine print verifies this).\n\nIf you’re looking for a mattress that offers plush comfort, as well as exceptional customer service, consider the all-foam Nectar. We scored it a perfect 5 out of 5 on both its trial period (a generous 365 nights) and warranty (which lasts forever).\n\nOur Mattress with the Best Customer Service – Nectar\n\nForever Warranty and 365-Night Trial\n\nNectar Mattress\n\nThe original Nectar mattress is a pressure-relieving, yet supportive, bed.

This may seem pretty pricey, given that it’s an air bed. While it’s important to remember the adjustability and technological aspects of the bed probably hike up the price, it’s still at least 15 percent more expensive than the average permanent-use airbed.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that there are two sides to every story, and for every poor review, there was typically a great review of a Sleep Number product. Make sure to do thorough research before any big bedding purchase, and maybe find someone you know who owns a Sleep Number to get a personal opinion before getting your own.\n\nThat said, if you want to pay a similar price for a Sleep Number while getting something with a more permanent structure, you could opt for the DreamCloud Original mattress. Constructed with gel memory foam and breathable coils, this firmer hybrid mattress can usually be found for around or under $1,000 for a queen after discounts, especially around the holidays.\n\nOur Favorite Value Mattress – DreamCloud Original Mattress\n\nSturdy Foams and Coils at an Affordable Price\n\nDreamCloud Original Mattress\n\nThe DreamCloud Mattress is a luxury hybrid mattress made with layers of memory foam and pocketed coils.
