When i share it with my friends it works fine but only on my laptop shows like the attached pictures.\n\nYour mesh is behaving fine here after smooth mesh, you have a few Ngon areas that need fixing but no major problems.\n\nYour issue might be related to your graphics card, you can update it or roll back, also make sure Maya is up to date.\n\nI would recommend increasing the size of your mesh, try to work in centimeters."
