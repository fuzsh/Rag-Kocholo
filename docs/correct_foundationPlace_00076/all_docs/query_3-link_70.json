        "text": "An inhaler is a device used to deliver medicine to your lungs and airways. It's mainly used to treat or prevent diseases of the airways, eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis. By getting medicine directly to your lungs, smaller doses of medicine are needed and it can start working faster.\n\nWhat are the different types of inhalers?\n\nThe main types of inhaler devices are metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers.\n\nMetered dose inhalers\n\nThe metered dose inhaler or MDI is an aerosol inhaler used to deliver a short burst, or puff, of medication. Read more about metered dose inhalers below.\n\nImage credit: Canva\n\nDry powder inhalers\n\nDry powder inhalers are handheld devices that deliver medicine to your lungs and airways as you inhale through it. Examples of dry powder inhalers include:\n\nTurbuhaler®\n\nAccuhaler®\n\nHandihaler®\n\nEllipta® inhaler\n\nBreezhaler®\n\nRead more about these different types of dry powder inhalers below.\n\nSoft mist inhaler\n\nThe Respimat® device is a soft mist inhaler. Read more about the Respimat® device below.\n\nMetered dose inhalers are also called MDIs or aerosol inhalers.\n\nThe medicine is in a small canister, inside a plastic case.\n\nWhen the inhaler is pressed, a measured dose of medicine comes through the mouthpiece.\n\nExactly the same dose is released each time.\n\nMDIs require good technique and coordination by pressing down on the inhaler and breathing in at the same time.\n\nBecause using the inhaler correctly can be difficult, spacer devices are recommended for use with MDIs. The spacer is attached to the MDI to make it easier to use the inhaler and get more medicine into your lungs. See the image below.\n\nMDIs contain different medicines including preventers, relievers, symptom controllers and combinations of medications. Read more about asthma medicines in adults, asthma medicines in children and medications for COPD.\n\nTo get the most benefit from your inhaler, it's important to use the correct technique. Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to use an MDI device.\n\nThe video below provides some guidance on how to use an MDI. An MDI is the name of the device used to deliver the medicine to your lungs and airways. There are different names for each MDI depending on the medicines inside the device.\n\nIt's important to know the name and colour of your MDI, eg, Ventolin®, Flixotide®, Serevent® or Respigen®.\n\nYour MDI may be a different colour tothe one in the video below. Read more aboutunderstanding your medicines(external link).\n\nVideo: How to use a metered-dose inhaler (puffer)\n\nHow to use an MDI (puffer)\n\nTake off the cap and hold the inhaler upright. Shake the inhaler to mix the medication. Sit upright, tilt your head back slightly (as if you are sniffing) and breathe out gently.\n\nHold the device upright, insert the inhaler into your mouth, ensuring that your lips firmly seal the mouthpiece.\n\nAt the beginning of a slow, deep breath, breathe in through the mouthpiece as you press the inhaler to release one dose or 'puff'.\n\nBreathe in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as is comfortable.\n\nBreathe out gently through your nose.\n\nUsing a spacer\n\nA spacer is an attachment to use with your MDI. Using a spacer with your MDI makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps to get the medicine into your lungs, where it’s needed (with less medicine ending up in your mouth and throat). Spacers improve how well your medicine works. Children over 10 years of age may be able to use an MDI without a spacer; however, babies and young children must use MDIs with a spacer or a spacer and a mask. Read more about spacers.\n\nImage credit: Healthify He Puna Waiora\n\nCommon mistakes when using an MDI\n\nBreathing in too fast.\n\nBreathing out so hard that you cough.\n\nPressing the puffer too early before you have started to breathe in (if you see a mist of medicine from your mouth, then you're making this mistake).\n\nTilting your head down – it should be tilting back slightly.\n\nPressing the inhaler twice during a single inhalation.\n\nGiving the inhaler a 'test puff' into the air and wasting the medicine.\n\nBreathing in through your nose instead of your mouth.\n\nIf you think you might be doing any of these things, ask your healthcare provider to watch you using your inhaler to make sure you're using the right technique.\n\nCleaning an MDI\n\nYour inhaler can get blocked, especially where the medicine sprays out. Clean your inhaler weekly to make sure it doesn't get blocked.\n\nHow to clean it\n\nRemove the plastic cap, remove the metal canister (don't put it in water), rinse the plastic case under warm water for at least 30 seconds.\n\nShake off any excess water, and leave the plastic case and cap to dry overnight.\n\nPut the metal canister back in, and replace the cap.\n\nStoring an MDI\n\nAlways keep the cap on your inhaler when it's not in use.\n\nStore spare inhalers in cool places (not in your car glove box).\n\nCarry a spare clean plastic case so you can change it if the one you're using becomes blocked.\n\nWhen to start a new MDI\n\nBy shaking the inhaler it's possible to hear if there's any medicine left in the canister.\n\nAlways have a spare inhaler ready, start this before the old one is completely empty.\n\nIt may help to write the start date on the inhaler, so you can work out how long it will last with daily use. There are usually 200 puffs per canister.\n\nThe Turbuhaler® is a breath-activated device – this means it will release a dose of medicine when you take a breath in through the mouthpiece.\n\nThe Turbuhaler delivers the medicine in a dry-powder form. There's no propellant added to the medicine.\n\nWhen you breathe in a dose of the medicine, you will hardly notice any powder in your mouth.\n\nPreventers, relievers, symptom controllers and combination medicines are available as turbuhalers.\n\nChildren from 5 years of age should be able to use a dry powder inhaler.\n\nExamples of medicines available as a Turbuhaler\n\nterbutaline (Bricanyl®)\n\nformoterol (Oxis®)\n\nbudesonide plus formoterol (Symbicort®)\n\nbudesonide (Pulmicort®)\n\nWhen is a Turbuhaler device suitable?\n\nSince the Turbuhaler is a breath-activated device, to use the Turbuhaler properly, you must be able to breathe in deeply.\n\nAdults and children 5 years of age and older should be able to use a Turbuhaler.\n\nSome people (eg, those with severe COPD) may not able to breathe in well enough to activate the Turbuhaler.\n\nIf you don't know if a Turbuhaler is the correct device for you, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nHow to use a Turbuhaler device\n\nTo get the most benefit, it is important to use the correct technique. Ask your healthcare provider to explain how to use your Turbuhaler.\n\nThe video below provides some guidance on how to use a Turbuhaler device. A Turbuhaler is the name of the device used to deliver the medicine to your lungs and airways. There are different names for each Turbuhaler depending on the medicines inside the device.\n\nIt's important to know the name and colour of your Turbuhaler, eg, Bricanyl®, Oxis® or Pulmicort®.\n\nYour Turbuhaler may be a different colour tothe one in the video below. Read more aboutunderstanding your medicines(external link).\n\nVideo: How to use your Turbuhaler device\n\n(Healthify He Puna Waiora & Auckland District Health Board, NZ, 2018)\n\nUsing a Turbuhaler device:\n\nOpen: Unscrew and remove the cap. Hold the Turbuhaler upright.\n\nLoad the dose: Twist the base anticlockwise and then back in the other direction until you hear a click. Your Turbuhaler is now loaded with 1 dose of medicine\n\nBreathe out: Breathe out, away from the Turbuhaler. Don't blow directly into the Turbuhaler.\n\nInhale your dose: Place the mouth piece in your mouth and form a seal with your lips. Breathe in deeply. Remove the turbuhaler and hold your breath for up to 10 seconds.\n\nClose: Replace the cap and twist until it's on properly.\n\nRinse your mouth: Rinse and spit out the water or clean your teeth after using any inhaler that contains a corticosteroid. Ask your healthcare provider if you’re not sure.\n\nCleaning and storing a Turbuhaler device\n\nWipe the mouthpiece with a clean dry tissue. Don't wash the mouthpiece or allow it to get wet when cleaning. Keep the cap on when you're not using it. The device may get blocked if you breathe out or dribble into it. It can also block up if it's stored in a place where there's high humidity (dampness) with the cap off or unsealed.\n\nWhen to start a new Turbuhaler\n\nThere's a window under the mouthpiece on the outside of the Turbuhaler called a dose indicator window. When it turns red it's time to get a new Turbuhaler.\n\nCommon problems when using a Turbuhaler device\n\nTo get the most benefit, it's important to use the correct technique. Here are a few common problems:\n\nNot holding your Turbuhaler upright (vertical) while loading the dose.\n\nCovering the air inlets with your lips.\n\nBreathing in through your nose instead of your mouth.\n\nShaking the inhaler to see how much is left.\n\nStoring your Turbuhaler in a damp place with the cap off.\n\nAn Accuhaler® is a breath-activated device – this means it will release a dose of medicine when you breathe in through the mouthpiece.\n\nDoses of the medicine are preloaded in foil-covered blister packets inside the device.\n\nThere are 60 doses in each Accuhaler – these can be counted with the dose counter on the device.\n\nExamples of medicines available as an Accuhaler\n\nsalmeterol (Serevent®)\n\nfluticasone (Flixotide®)\n\nfluticasone and salmeterol (Seretide®)\n\nWhen is an Accuhaler suitable?\n\nSince the Accuhaler is a breath-activated device, you must be able to breathe in deeply to use it properly.\n\nAdults and children 4 years of age and older should be able to use an Accuhaler.\n\nSome people (eg, those with severe COPD) may not able to breathe in deeply enough to activate the Accuhaler.\n\nIf you're not sure if the Accuhaler is the correct device for you, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nHow to use an Accuhaler device\n\nTo get the most benefit from your Accuhaler, it's important to use the correct technique. Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to use an Accuhaler device.\n\nThe video below provides some guidance on how to use an Accuhaler. An Accuhaler is the name of the device used to deliver the medicine to your lungs and airways.

When it turns red it's time to get a new accuhaler.\n\nCommon problems when using an Accuhaler device\n\nTo get the most benefit, it's important to use the correct technique. Here are a few common problems:\n\nNot loading a dose before using the Accuhaler.\n\nNot holding the Accuhaler horizontally while loading and inhaling the dose. Never hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece pointing down during or after loading a dose; this can cause the medicine to fall out. Keep it horizontal.\n\nNot breathing in strongly enough to draw the medicine out of the Accuhaler and into your lungs.\n\nNot holding your breath long enough after using the Accuhaler.\n\nGetting moisture inside the Accuhaler.\n\nNot closing the Accuhaler cover after use.\n\nThe HandiHaler® is used for the medicine tiotropium (also called Spiriva® capsules). Do not swallow the capsules – they must be used by inhaling the contents of the capsule with the HandiHaler device provided.\n\nThe HandiHaler is a breath-activated device – this means it will release a dose of medicine when you inhale on the mouth piece.\n\nTiotropium (Spiriva® capsules) is used for people with COPD. Read more about tiotropium.\n\nHow to use your HandiHaler\n\nTo get the most benefit, it's important to use the correct technique when using your HandiHaler. Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to use it. The video below provides some guidance.\n\nVideo: How to use your Spiriva HandiHaler\n\n(Healthify He Puna Waiora & Auckland District Health Board, NZ, 2018)\n\nUsing your HandiHaler\n\nOpen: Press the green button on the side of the HandiHaler to open the lid. Lift the lid to see the mouthpiece. Pull on the mouthpiece to reveal the capsule chamber.\n\nLoad the capsule: Spiriva® capsules come packaged in blister strips. Peel back the foil from 1 blister strip to release 1 capsule. Don't remove the capsule by pushing it through the foil – this will damage the capsule. Place the capsule into the capsule chamber. Close the mouthpiece firmly until you hear a click.\n\nPierce the capsule: Press the green button on the side to pierce the capsule.\n\nBreathe out: Sit upright, tilt your head back (into 'sniff' position) and breathe out gently. Don't breathe into the device.\n\nInhale your dose: Put the mouthpiece into your mouth and seal your lips firmly around it. Breathe in rapidly and deeply through your mouth. You will hear the sound of the capsule vibrating in the chamber. Remove the HandiHaler from your mouth and hold your breath for up to 10 seconds.\n\nTake 2 breaths from the same capsule: To get your full daily dose, you must take a second breath from the same capsule. You won't need to pierce the capsule again.\n\nDiscard the used capsule: After inhaling your dose, open the mouthpiece and discard the used capsule. Close the mouthpiece and the lid of the inhaler.\n\nCleaning the HandiHaler device\n\nClean the device once a month.\n\nOpen the protective cap, mouthpiece and base.\n\nRinse the whole device with warm water and air-dry thoroughly for 24 hours.\n\nClean the outside of the mouthpiece with a damp tissue when needed.\n\nWhen to start a new HandiHaler\n\nYou can use your HandiHaler for up to 1 year before replacing. A new one can be prescribed for you or you can buy one from your pharmacy.\n\nCommon problems when using the HandiHaler device\n\nTo get the most benefit, it's important to use the correct technique. Here are a few common problems:\n\nPiercing the capsule several times or not piercing the capsule at all.\n\nNot breathing in strongly enough to draw the medicine out of the inhaler.\n\nNot taking a second breath to get the full dose from the capsule.\n\nSwallowing the capsule instead of inhaling it through the HandiHaler.\n\nNot using a new capsule for each dose.\n\nThe Respimat® device is a soft mist inhaler. It's a hand-held device in which medicine in a liquid form is converted to a fine mist which is then inhaled.\n\nThere's no propellant added to the medicine. It's converted into a fine mist by a compressed spring inside the inhaler.\n\nUsing the soft mist inhaler needs some coordination as you have to press down slowly and breathe in at the same time.\n\nWhen compared to the metered dose inhaler (MDI) the soft mist inhaler has been shown to leave less medicine in your throat so that more reaches your lungs.\n\nExamples of medicines available as a fine mist\n\ntiotropium (Spiriva® Respimat®)\n\ntiotropium + olodaterol (Spiolto® Respimat®)\n\nHow to use your Respimat device\n\nTo get the most benefit, it is important to use the correct technique.

Pull back the mouthpiece to reveal the capsule chamber.\n\nInsert the capsule: The capsules come packaged in a foil wrapping. Pull back the foil edges to release 1 capsule. Don't remove the capsule by pushing it through the foil – this will damage the capsule. Place the capsule into the capsule chamber. Close the mouthpiece until you hear a click.\n\nPierce the capsule: Hold the inhaler upright and press both side buttons at the same time. You should hear a click as the capsule is pierced. Then release the side buttons.\n\nBreathe out: Hold the inhaler away from your mouth and breathe out fully.\n\nInhale your dose: Put the mouthpiece into your mouth and seal your lips firmly around it. Breathe in rapidly and deeply until your lungs are full and hold your breath for 10 seconds. You'll hear the sound of the capsule vibrating in the chamber.\n\nTake 2 breaths from the same capsule: To get your full daily dose, you must take a second breath from the same capsule.\n\nDiscard the used capsule: After inhaling your dose, open the mouthpiece and throw away the used capsule. Close the mouthpiece and the lid of the inhaler.\n\nCleaning and storing a Breezhaler device\n\nYou can clean your device by wiping the mouthpiece with a clean dry tissue. Don't wash the mouthpiece or allow it to get wet when you're cleaning it. Close the device when you're not using it. Store it in a cool dry place, away from heat and moisture.\n\nWhen to start a new Breezhaler\n\nEach new pack contains the capsules for inhalation plus a new Breezhaler. Use a new Breezhaler every time you start a new pack of capsules.\n\nCommon problems when using a Breezhaler device\n\nShaking the inhaler.\n\nNot piercing the capsule.\n\nNot using a new capsule for each dose.\n\nNot breathing in hard enough."
