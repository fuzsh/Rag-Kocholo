        "text": "Editor’s note: this article was updated May 14, 2024 to include information about Eilish’s upcoming tour dates.\n\nBillie Eilish has announced her third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT out May 17.\n\nFresh off a sweeping set of award wins for Song Of The Year and Best Song Written For Visual Media at the 2024 GRAMMYs and Best Original Song at the Oscars for her hit single, \"What Was I Made For?\" from the Barbie soundtrack, Eilish is swapping Barbie pink for submerged shades of blue.\n\nHer new album, another collaboration with brother Finneas, comes almost three years after her sophomore effort, 2021's Happier Than Ever.\n\nAhead of the official press announcement and Instagram post on Monday, Eilish unleashed a viral ad campaign teasing the release. Billboards featuring the nine-time GRAMMY winner's \"blohsh\" symbol (a genderless human stick figure) with what fans guessed were cryptic lyrics, appeared in blue font on a black background across major cities, including Los Angeles and New York City's Times Square. Then, Eilish changed her social media icons to a shade of blue and treated Instagram followers to some more mystifying visual content via a set of story posts that included her millions of fans being added to Close Friends on the app.\n\nThat strategy paid off, exploding the number of followers Eilish counts on the platform to over 120 million (up from 110 million on Friday) in the span of just three days. One fan summed up the collective rush to join the inner circle with a comment that's racked up over 10,000 likes: \"Not a big deal but I’m on her close friends.\"\n\nAs she dives into deeper artistic waters with her third album, Billie Eilish continues to push the boundaries of music and environmental activism, blending her unique sound with a strong commitment to sustainability. Read on for everything GRAMMY.com has unearthed about Eilish's upcoming release.\n\nThere Won't Be Any Pre-Released Singles\n\nFans hoping for an early taste of what's to come will have to wait almost a full month to quench their thirst for any new music.\n\nEilish confirmed via Instagram that the album will drop in full, without any pre-released singles. “So crazy to be writing this right now i’m nervyyyyy & exciteddd,\" Eilish wrote. Continuing, \"Not doing singles i wanna give it to you all at once. Finneas and i truly could not be more proud of this album and we absolutely can’t wait for you to hear it. Love you love you love you.”\n\nThe Track List is ‘Spirited Away’\n\nOn April 18, Eilish posted the full tracklist for Hit Me Hard And Soft on her Instagram in a post that lists 10 tracks including one named \"CHIHIRO,\" a title borrowed from the Japanese animated film Spirited Away.\n\nEilish teased a 15-second snippet of the track in a recent interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music which included Eilish softly singing, “Today, maybe tomorrow/ Open the door for me/ I know you said before/ You can’t cope with it no more.”\n\nIn the same interview with Apple Music, Eilish noted that she and brother Finneas created the album as if no one would ever hear it. \"We kind of made the album that if somebody had said, ‘I want you to make an album and no one is going to hear it. You don’t have to worry about anyone’s ears or opinions or anything at all. It’s in your contract to make an album but no one can hear it,’ Eilish told Lowe. \"We pretty much made that album. We made that album without much thought of other people.” Watch the full interview below.\n\nThe album is set to debut in a year poised to feature some of the most significant releases from major musicians, each exploring and redefining genre boundaries, trends, and soundscapes.\n\n\"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT is a diverse yet cohesive collection of songs, ideally listened to in its entirety from beginning to end,\" a press release accompanying the announcement stated. \"The album does exactly as the title suggests: hits you hard and soft both lyrically and sonically while bending genres and defying trends along the way.\"\n\nThe Cover Art Is Haunting\n\nThe cover art is elusive and mysterious, featuring a dark and moody image of Eilish that matches statements about her plunging to new depths as an artist. Dressed head-to-toe in dark colors, she is depicted sinking into the depths of a body of water, beneath a stark white door floating at the surface.\n\nThe cover art tracks against the statements in the press release that note, \"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT journeys through a vast and expansive audio landscape, immersing listeners into a full spectrum of emotions.\"\n\nThe Release Is Focused On Sustainability\n\nEilish is hoping to turn the power of her fans into a force for good — her latest album hopes to set a new standard for eco-conscious music production with sustainability baked into the production of CD, cassette, and vinyl releases.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard Eilish said, \"The fact that I have a far bigger audience and platform than I’ve ever had in my life means I can reach that many more people, and that’s such a huge responsibility and privilege to have.\" She continued, “If I don’t use that privilege to do some good in the world, then what’s the point?\"\n\nAccording to a new sustainability page on her website, fans can anticipate eight distinct vinyl variants, each unified in track-listing but varied in their sustainable creation. Available through her website and major retailers, the standard black vinyl is crafted entirely from recycled materials. The other seven vibrant variants use ECO-MIX, which repurposes leftover vinyl pieces, or BioVinyl, reducing carbon emissions by 90 percent with ingredients like used cooking oil. The packaging itself is also focused on environmental responsibility, featuring certified recycled content and plant-based ink.\n\nOn building more sustainable processes into her album release as a major artist, Eilish told Billboard, “I can’t just ignore what I know and go about my business and career and not do something. That’s just not how I was raised, or how I want to live my life.\"\n\nBillie Will Celebrate The Album With Special Listening Parties\n\nIn the two days before HIT ME HARD AND SOFT arrives, Eilish will host two free album listening parties on May 15 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and on May 16 at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles. Though the ticket request window has closed for those shows, fans across the United States will have the chance to listen to the album in a special way thanks to AMC Theaters and Apple Music.\n\nBillie Eilish: HIT ME HARD AND SOFT - Presented by Apple Music will hit theaters in 43 cities — including Seattle, Kansas City and Miami — on May 16 and 17. The album will be played in Dolby Cinema along with a visual component. Tickets are available for purchase now for $5 each (with a portion of proceeds benefiting the AMC Cares Charitable Fund); see if it's coming to a theater near you here.\n\nHIT ME HARD AND SOFT: THE TOUR Will Start Sept. 29\n\nEilish couldn't release a new album without announcing a tour! HIT ME HARD AND SOFT: THE TOUR will kick off in Quebec City, Canada, on Sept. 29. She'll make stops across North America through Dec. 17 (just one day before her 23rd birthday!). The tour will pick up again on Feb. 18, 2025 with 12 dates in Australia before heading to Europe and the United Kingdom; Eilish will close out the trek with two shows in Dublin, Ireland on July 26 and 27, 2025.\n\nCheck out the full list of dates here — and keep watching this space for more news on all things Eilish!\n\nWatch Billie Eilish & FINNEAS’ 2024 GRAMMYs Red Carpet Interview\n\nBeloved by fans around the globe, yet increasingly unaffordable for many artists, concert tours are central to the world of entertainment and local economies. After the pandemic-era global shuttering of concert venues large and small, tours are back, and bigger than ever.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour issmashing records, selling more than four million tickets and earning more than $1 billion. But that tour made headlines for another reason: as reported inBusiness Insider and other outlets, for a six-month period in 2023, Swift’s two jets spent a combined 166 hours in the air between concerts, shuttling at most a total of 28 passengers.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, heightened concerns about the global environmental cost of concert touring have led a number of prominent artists to launch initiatives. Those efforts seek both to mitigate the negative effects of touring and communicate messages about sustainability to concertgoers.\n\nA 2023 study sponsored by Texas-based electricity provider Payless Power found that the carbon footprint of many touring bands was massive. In 2022, concert tours in five genres — country, classic rock, hip-hop/rap, metal and pop — were responsible for CO2 emissions totaling nearly 45,000 metric tons. A so-called greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by radiative forcing; increased levels of CO2 also contribute to health problems.\n\nNo serious discussion of climate issues suggests a worldwide halt to live music touring, but there exists much room for improvement. Both on their own and with the help of dedicated nonprofit organizations, many artists are taking positive steps toward mitigating the deleterious effects that touring exerts upon the environment.\n\nSmart tour planning is one way to lessen an artist’s carbon footprint. Ed Sheeran’s 2022 European run minimized flights between concert venues, making that leg of his tour the year's most environmentally efficient. Total carbon dioxide emissions (from flights and driving) on Sheeran’s tour came to less than 150 metric tons. In contrast, Dua Lipa’s tour during the same period generated 12 times as much — more than 1800 metric tons — of CO2.\n\nIn July, singer/songwriter and four-time GRAMMY nominee Jewel will embark on her first major tour in several years, alongside GRAMMY winner Melissa Etheridge. During the planning stage for the 28-city tour, Jewel suggested an idea that could reduce the tour’s carbon footprint.\n\n\"I always thought it was so silly and so wasteful — and so carbon footprint-negative — to have separate trucks, separate lighting, separate crews, separate hotel rooms, separate costs,\" Jewel says. She pitched the idea of sharing a backing band with Etheridge. \"I’ve been trying to do this for 25 years,\" Jewel says with a laugh. \"Melissa is the first person who took me up on it!\"\n\nThe changes will not only reduce the tour’s carbon footprint, but they’ll also lessen the cost of taking the shows on the road. Acknowledging that there are many opportunities to meet the challenges of touring’s negative impact upon the environment, Jewel emphasizes that “you have to find [solutions] that work for you.”\n\nSheeran and Jewel aren’t the only popular artists trying to make a difference. A number of high profile artists have become actively involved in creating the momentum for positive change. Those artists believe that their work on sustainability issues goes hand in hand with their role as public figures. Their efforts take two primary forms: making changes themselves, andadvocating for action among their fans.\n\nThe Climate Machine\n\nNorhan Bayomi is an Egypt-born environmental scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a key member of theEnvironmental Solutions Initiative, a program launched to address sustainable climate action. She’s also a recording artist in the trance genre, working under the nameNourey.\n\nThe ESI collaborates with industry heavyweights Live Nation, Warner Music Group and others as well with touring/recording acts likeColdplay to examine the carbon footprint of the music industry. A key component of the ESI is theClimate Machine, a collaborative research group that seeks to help the live music industry reduce carbon emissions. \"As a research institution, we bring technologies and analytics to understand, in the best way possible, the actual impact of the music industry upon climate change,\" says John Fernández, Director of the ESI.\n\n\"I’m very interested in exploring ways that we can bridge between environmental science, climate change and music fans,\" Bayomi says. She explains that the tools at the ESI’s disposal include \"virtual reality, augmented reality and generative AI,\" media forms that can communicate messages to music fans and concertgoers. Fernández says that those endeavors are aimed at \"enlisting, enabling and inspiring people to get engaged in climate change.\"\n\nThe Environmental Solutions Initiative cites Coldplay as a high-profile success. The band and its management issued an \"Emissions Update\" documentin June 2024, outlining its success at achieving their goal of reducing direct carbon emissions from show production, freight, band and crew travel. The established target was a 50 percent cut in emissions compared to Coldplay’s previous tour; the final result was a 59 percent reduction between their 2022-23 tour and 2016-17 tour.\n\nA significant part of that reduction came as a result of a renewable-energy based battery system that powers audio and lights. The emissions data in the update was reviewed and independently validated by MIT’s Fernández.\n\nChange Is Reverberating\n\nGuitarist Adam Gardner is a founding member of Massachusetts-based indie rockersGuster, but he's more than just a singer in a rock band. Gardner is also the co-founder ofREVERB, one of the organizations at the forefront of developing and implementing climate-focused sustainability initiatives.\n\nFounded in 2004 by Gardner and his wife, environmental activist Lauren Sullivan, REVERB began with a goal of making touring more sustainable; over the years its focus has expanded to promote industry-wide changes. Today, the organization promotes sustainability throughout the industry in partnership with music artists, concert venues and festivals.\n\nREVERB initiatives have included efforts to eliminate single-use plastics at the California Roots Music & Arts Festival, clean energy projects in cooperation with Willie Nelson and Billie Eilish, and efforts with other major artists. Gardner has seen sustainability efforts grow over two decades\n\n\"It’s really amazing to see the [change] with artists, with venues, with fans,\" Gardner says. \"Today, people are not just giving lip service to sustainable efforts; they really want to do things that are real and measurable.\"\n\nTheMusic Decarbonization Project is one tangible example of REVERB’s successes. \"Diesel power is one of the dirtiest sources of power,\" Gardner explains. \"And it’s an industry standard to power festival stages with diesel generators.\" Working withWillie Nelson, the organization helped switch the power sources at his annual Luck Reunion to clean energy. At last year’s festival, Nelson’s headlining stage drew 100 percent of its power from solar-powered batteries. \"We set up a temporary solar farm,\" Gardner says, \"and the main stage didn’t have to use any diesel power.\"\n\nBillie Eilish was another early supporter of the initiative. \"She helped us launch the program,\" Gardner says. Eilish’s set at Lollapallooza 2023 drew power from solar batteries, too.\n\nWith such high-profile successes as a backdrop, Gardner believes that REVERB is poised to do even more to foster sustainable concerts and touring. \"Our role now,\" he says, \"isn’t just, ‘Hey, think about this stuff.’ It’s more how do we push farther, faster?\"\n\nAdam Gardner believes that musicians are uniquely positioned to help make a difference where issues of sustainability are concerned. \"When you’re a musician, you’re connecting with fans heart-to-heart. That’s what moves people. And that’s where the good stuff happens.\"\n\nSmall-scale, individual changes can make a difference — especially when they’re coordinated and amplified among other concertgoers. Gardner provides real-world examples. \"Instead of buying a plastic bottle, I brought my reusable and filled it up. Maybe I carpooled to the show.\" Conceding that such steps might seem like drops of water in a giant pool, he emphasizes the power of scale. \"When you actually multiply [those things for] just one summer tour, it adds up,\" he says. \"And it reminds people, ‘You’re not alone in this; you’re part of a community that’s taking action.\"\n\nGardner understands that REVERB’s arguments have to be framed the right way to reach concertgoers. \"Look,\" he admits, \"It’s a concert. We’re not here to be a buzzkill. Our [aim] now is making sure people don’t lose hope.\" He says that REVERB and its partners seek to demonstrate that, with collective action and cultural change, there is reason for optimism.\n\n\"There’s a wonderful feedback loop between hope and action,\" Gardner says with a smile. \"You can’t really have one without the other.\"\n\nSustainable Partnerships\n\nTanner Watt is Director of Partnerships at REVERB; he works directly with touring artists to develop, coordinate and implement initiatives that bring together his organization’s objectives and the specific personal concerns of the artists. \"I get to come up with all the fun, big ideas,\" he says with a wide smile.\n\nWatt acknowledges that like every concertgoer, each touring artist has a certain level of responsibility where sustainability is concerned. \"And everyone can be doing something,\" he says, noting a number of straightforward actions that artists can put in place while on tour. \"They can eliminate single-use waste. They can donate hotel toiletries that [would otherwise] hit the landfill.\"\n\nWatt stresses that artists can lead by example. \"Nobody wants to listen to an artist telling them what to do if they’re not doing it themselves,\" he says. \"But we believe that everybody cares about something.\" He suggests that if an artist has cultivated a following, \"Why not use [that platform] to be that change you want to see in the world?\"\n\nEach artist has his or her own specific areas of concern, but Watt says that there’s a base level of \"greening\" that takes place on every REVERB-affiliated tour. Where things go from there is up to the artist, in coordination with REVERB. Watt mentions Billie Eilish and her tour’s sustainability commitment. \"The Venn diagram of food security, community health, access to healthy food, and the impact on the planet is a big cause for her,\" he says. \"So there’s plant-based catering for her entire crew, across the entire tour.\"\n\nSpeaking toBillboard, Eilish's mother Maggie Baird said championing sustainability starts with artists. \"If artists are interested, it does really start with them telling their teams that they care and that it’s foremost in their thoughts.\" In the same conversation, Eilish called the battle for sustainability \"a never-ending f–king fight.\"\n\nWatt acknowledges that with so many challenges, it’s important for a concerned artist to focus on the issues that move them the most, and where they can make the biggest difference. \"Jack Johnson is a great example,\" he says. While Johnson is a vocal advocate for many environmental issues, on tour he focuses on two (in Watt’s words) \"cause umbrellas\": single-use plastics solutions and sustainable community food systems. Each show on the tour hosts tables representing local nonprofit organizations, presenting concertgoers with real-world, human-scale solutions to those specific challenges.\n\nFour-time GRAMMY winnerBrittany Howard is another passionate REVERB partner. \"Knowing that I wanted to make my tours more sustainable was a start,\" she tells GRAMMY.com, \"but working with REVERB really helped me bring it to life on the road. REVERB has helped us with guidelines and a green rider to keep our stage, greenrooms and buses more sustainable.\"\n\nAfter listing several other specific ways that her tour supports sustainability, Howard notes, \"By supporting these efforts, I am helping ensure future generations have access to clean water, fish, and all that I love about the outdoors.\" A dollar from every ticket sold to a Brittany Howard concert goes toward support of REVERB’s Music Decarbonization project. \"I’m also excited to see industry-wide efforts that are reducing the carbon pollution of live music,\" Howard continues. \"Because it’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s every tour.\"\n\nThere’s a popular aphorism: \"You can’t manage what you can’t measure.\" From its start, REVERB has sought not only to promote change, but to measure its success. \"As long as I’ve been at REVERB, we’ve issuedimpact reports,\" says Tanner Watt. \"We include data points, and give the report to the artists so they understand what we’ve done together.\" He admits that some successes are more tangible than others, but that it’s helpful to focus on the ones that can be quantified. \"We’re very excited that our artists share those with their fans.\"\n\nWatt is clear-eyed at the challenges that remain. \"Even the word ‘sustainable’ can be misleading,\" he concedes, suggesting that the only truly sustainable tour is the one that doesn’t happen. \"But if folks don’t step it up and change the way we do business in every industry — not just ours — we’re going to get to a place where we’re forced to make sacrifices that aren’t painless.\" Getting that message across is REVERB’s aim. \"We can’t stop the world,\" Watt says. \"So we find ways to approach these things positively.\"\n\nWatt says that the fans at concerts featuring Jack Johnson and theDave Matthews Band — both longtime REVERB partners — are already on board with many of the sustainability-focused initiatives which those artists promote. \"But there are lots of artists — and lots of fan bases — out there that aren’t messaged to, or have been mis-messaged to,\" he says. \"I’m really excited to find more ways to expand our reach to them, beyond mainstream pop music. Because these are conversations that are meaningful for everyone, regardless of political affiliation or other beliefs.\"\n\nReimagining The Planet’s Future\n\nSinger, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Met does more than frontAJR, the indie pop trio he founded in 2005 with brothers Jack and Ryan. Met has a PhD in sustainable development and is a climate activist; he's also the founder/Executive Director ofPlanet Reimagined, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability and activism through its work with businesses, other organizations and musicians.\n\n\"I’ve spent years traveling around the world, seeing the direct impact of climate change,\" Met says. He cites two recent and stark examples. \"When we pulled up to a venue in San Francisco, the band had to wear gas masks going from the bus into the venue, because of forest fires,\" he says. AJR’s road crew had to contend with a flash flood in Athens, Greece that washed out their hotel. \"And in Rome, some of our crew members fainted because of the heat.\"\n\nEncouraged by representatives from the United Nations, Met launched Planet Reimagined. Met’s approach focuses on tailored, city-specific actions to empower fans and amplify diverse voices in the climate movement. Through social media and live shows, Met strives to galvanize climate activism among AJR fans. And the methods he has developed can be implemented by other touring artists.\n\nMet points out that one of the most climate-unfriendly parts of the entire concert tour enterprise is fans traveling to and from the concerts. And that’s something over which the artist has little or no control. What they can do, he says, is try to educate and influence. Working closely with Ticketmaster and other stakeholders, Met’s nonprofit initiated a study — conducted from July to December 2023, with results published in April 2024 — to explore the energy that happens at concerts. \"In sociology,\" he explains, \"that energy is called collective effervescence.\" The study’s goal is to find ways to channel that energy toward advocacy and action.\n\nPolling a quarter million concertgoers across musical genres, the study collected data on attitudes about climate change. \"Seventy-three percent of fans who attend concerts believe that climate change is real, and that we need to be doing more about it,\" Met says. \"Seventy-eight percent have already taken some sort of action in their lives.\" He believes that if his organization can activate even a fraction of the estimated 250 million people annually who attend concerts around the globe, \"that’s the ballgame.\"\n\nMet’s goal is to do more than, say, get concertgoers to switch from plastic to paper drinking straws. \"At scale those things make a difference. But people want to see actions where there’s a track record,\" he says; a return on investment.\n\nAJR will be putting a plan into action on the second half of their upcoming arena tour. Part of the initiative is encouraging concertgoers to register to vote, and then actually vote. Beyond that, Met has specific actions in mind. \"At every single stop, we’re putting together materials around specific policies that are being debated at the local level,\" he explains. \"We give people a script right there, so they can call their elected representative and say, ‘I want you to vote [a certain way on this issue].’\"\n\nHe believes the initiative will lead to thousands of people contacting – and hopefully influencing – their representatives. With regard to sustainability issues, Met is convinced that \"the most impact that you can have as an artist is when you give fans ways to pick up the mantle themselves.\"\n\nArtists Who Are Going On Tour In 2024: The Rolling Stones, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo & More\n\nBeing a once-in-a-generation artist isn't an easy crown to wear, but Billie Eilish has made it look effortlessly badass. The singer's unabashed honesty and equally raw vocal talent led her to becoming one of the industry's most decorated Gen Z artists before she even reached her twenties.\n\nEilish first caught our ears in 2016 when the then-13-year-old uploaded \"ocean eyes\" to SoundCloud. The tender ballad — written and produced by her brother and steadfast collaborator, FINNEAS — was shared with Eilish's dance teacher with the intention of using it as a choreography track. The intimate song transformed the budding artist into an overnight sensation that led to an Interscope record deal that year.\n\nFrom there, Eilish released her stunning 2017 debut EP, Don't Smile at Me. The trajectory continued at a whirlwind pace with 2019's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? and her 2021 follow-up, Happier Than Ever, both of which topped the Billboard 200 chart. The albums' successes made her an award show darling, and in 2020, she became only the second artist and first woman to win all four General Field Categories (Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year, and Best New Artist) at just 18 years old. As of press time, Eilish has nine GRAMMY Awards and 25 nominations. And at her current age of 22, she's still only just getting started.\n\nThe singer may have emerged onto the scene with a subdued voice, but what a red herring that was. Eilish has been a force to be reckoned with from the start, and this edition of Songbook celebrates each chapter of her shape-shifting career thus far, including her recently launched HIT ME HARD AND SOFT era.\n\nBelow, dive into Eilish's music highlights — from her personal projects to soundtrack masterpieces — that have laid the foundation for her growing longevity.\n\nThe Melancholic Songstress\n\nDon't Smile at Me (2017)\n\nDon't Smile at Me is a perfectly blunt way to sum up teen angst. With signature songs like the teary \"ocean eyes\" and the equally earnest ballad \"idontwannabeyouanymore,\" the eight-track project showcased Eilish's propensity for transforming moodiness into art.\n\nThe EP navigated themes of depression and heartbreak, which were funneled through lyrics seemingly ripped out of Eilish's diary. That refreshing intimacy is what makes her such a revered artist, and Don't Smile at Me provided just a glimpse into what her sound would grow into.\n\nWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019)\n\nDepression can often feel like one is drowning in a bottomless pool, and Eilish doubled down on that heaviness with her debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? The lyrics were pulled from Eilish's nightmares and bouts with depression, and with the help of her brother FINNEAS' production and co-writing pen, it all came to life like a wicked horror film.\n\nIf the album is a night terror, then \"bad guy\" is the sleep paralysis demon smirking in the bedroom corner. It might be the poppiest of WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP's singles (it even spawned a remix featuring one of Eilish's idols, Justin Bieber), but the balance of the zany electro and claims of being the \"Make-your-girlfriend-mad type/ Might-seduce-your-dad type\" shows this flavor of pop is not the bubblegum kind. Other highlights — The Office samples dotted throughout, the eerie taunts of \"you should see me in a crown\" and \"bury a friend,\" and even an ASMR-worthy Invisalign intro — made the album a thrilling exploration of Eilish's unconventional artistry.\n\nHappier Than Ever (2021)\n\nAfter WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? saw Eilish in a living nightmare, Happier Than Ever found her confronting those demons — and as a result, feeling and sounding much lighter. Sporting a Marilyn Monroe-esque blonde bob at the time (a complete 180 from her black and electric lime-colored locks), the album presented an even more vulnerable artist. Eilish's overnight success not only came with a tireless music industry demanding more hits from her, but also stalkers, toxic relationships and social media-fueled misogyny — and she addressed all of it on Happier Than Ever.\n\n\"Things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now,\" she grieves on the \"Getting Older\" opener, coming to terms with the reality of being a pop star. The vulnerability continues with songs like \"Not My Responsibility,\" a response to people constantly dissecting and sexualizing her body; the trip-hop \"NDA,\" which finds Eilish pleading for privacy; and the boisterous title track that sees Eilish belting for the first time. Happier Than Ever wasn't the typical coming-of-age moment that we're used to. But it was born out of an ugly truth, which is an admirable endeavor for an artist who hadn't even reached her twenties.\n\nHIT ME HARD AND SOFT (2024)\n\nHIT ME HARD AND SOFT almost plays like a \"Best of Billie\" album, highlighting her award-winning sonic tropes and guiding them into new, expansive territories. She heavily plays on the concept of her third album's title, with both tender ballads and heart-pounding uptempos.\n\nShe also celebrates the menacing teen version of the Billie Eilish many were first introduced to on WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? Only this time, she's even more confident in her artistry; her vocals are the strongest they've ever been, as heard on \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" and \"THE GREATEST.\" There's a beautiful maturity that envelopes HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, making it even more exciting to see how else she'll experiment with this album era.\n\nThe Big-Screen Auteur\n\n13 Reasons Why (2017)\n\nEilish's music is as cinematic as it's poetic, so it's not surprising that she's established herself as a soundtrack queen. Her first foray was for Netflix's hit series \"13 Reasons Why,\" which aired just before Eilish's debut EP release, making it the perfect pairing. The singer contributed the flippant song \"Bored\" to the series' first season, showcasing the ballad brilliance that was to come from the rising star.\n\nRoma (2018)\n\nWater plays a big part in the critically acclaimed Roma — a feature that's also frequent in Eilish's own music videos, and she further heightened that inspiration for the film's soundtrack highlight, \"When I Was Older.\" With her voice sounding submerged under water, the singer and FINNEAS create a chilling atmosphere that reflects the characters' turmoil. Roma ended up becoming an Oscar-winning film, a not-so-subtle foreshadowing of what would happen to Eilish's own career soon after.\n\nNo Time To Die (2020)\n\nThe James Bond theme songs often have a somber tone, so it made sense for Eilish to join the likes of Adele and Sam Smith as a contributor. \"No Time To Die\" is as beautiful as it is haunting, with the singer's voice bellowing with the sweeping orchestra. The song owned awards season, scoring a GRAMMY for Best Song Written For Visual Media and Best Original Song trophies from the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards and more.\n\nEuphoria (2021)\n\nBoth Eilish and Rosalía make achingly tender music, and the Spanish singer led Eilish to new, atmospheric heights with Euphoria's \"Lo Vas a Olvidar.\" The song was first previewed in the trailer for Jules' special episode, then was later played in a vulnerable scene where the character reveals how much her girlfriend Rue's relapsing affected her. The pained lyrics (\"Tell me if you still miss me / Tell me if you still don't forgive me / What will you do with all this poison?\") reflects Jules' heartache. \"Lo Vas a Olvidar\" marked the first time Eilish sang in Spanish, making her harmonies with Rosalía even more elegiac.\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nUnder Eilish's edgy demeanor is a pure pop fan, so it was fitting that she teamed up with Pixar to contribute three songs to their Turning Red film. The singer and FINNEAS wrote \"Nobody Like U,\" \"U Know What's Up\" and \"1 True Love,\" all songs performed by a fictional boy band, 4*Town, a nod to boy bands of the late '90s and early aughts.\n\nEilish had made playful songs in the past, but these tunes traded her signature cynical undertone for more nostalgic fun, further revealing her pop versatility. \"Writing the songs has literally been the most fun we've had writing,\" Eilish shared during a Disney press run. \"Mei and her friends' passion for 4*Town, it really resonated with me just because I was the same. It's so accurate of how it feels when you're that kind of fan.\"\n\nBarbie (2023)\n\nLast summer's Barbie was a mammoth at the box office and the charts, partly thanks to Eilish's soundtrack contribution. Reverting back to her teary-eyed ballads, \"What Was I Made For?\" summarizes the film's central theme of navigating life as a woman in a misogynistic world.\n\nThe beautifully painful tune resonated in and outside of the film, earning an Academy Award for Best Original Song and two GRAMMY Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media in 2024. The accolades marked another history-defining moment for Eilish: \"What Was I Made For?\" became just the tenth song in history to win both an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a GRAMMY for Song Of The Year.\n\nThe Poignant Performer\n\nTours\n\nThe bombastic production in Eilish's music practically begs for an audience, so it's bound to be electrifying whenever she hits the stage. She began small in 2017 with the 11-show dont smile at me tour — her first headlining trek — but quickly expanded to arenas.\n\nShe truly hit her stride with 2022's Happier Than Ever, The World Tour. Keeping the staging minimal while sporting her signature baggy looks, she let her vocals (and some electrifying strobe lights) command the attention. Her energy never falters throughout the nearly two-hour long show and neither does the audience, who lovingly shout every single lyric. And it won't be long before she brings HIT ME HARD AND SOFT to the stage — the tour (her seventh) kicks off Sept. 29 in Québec, Canada.\n\nAward Shows\n\nEilish's fan base goes far beyond the hyper teenagers who flood her concerts. The singer's award show performances also reveal how much her peers admire her.\n\nWith nine GRAMMY wins under her belt, Eilish's GRAMMY performances over the years have helped prove why she's earned them. Following her stage debut in 2020, she returned the following year to perform the Record Of The Year-winning \"everything I wanted\" as fellow nominees Black Pumas and Harry Styles cheered her on in the crowd. The singer's thunderous \"Happier Than Ever\" performance received equally roaring applause.\n\nEilish reminded of her vocal prowess and ethereal stage presence at both the GRAMMYs and Oscars this year, delivering delicate renditions of \"What Was I Made For?\" with just FINNEAS and a piano for each show. As those performances displayed, relatability and heightened emotion — as seen with other award show performances, like the cinematic version of \"No Time To Die\" at the 2022 Oscars and the fiery \"all the good girls go to hell\" at the 2019 American Music Awards — are what make Eilish's performances so unforgettable.\n\nConcert Film\n\nEilish transported the vulnerability and intimacy of Happier Than Ever to the silver screen for 2021's GRAMMY-nominated Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles concert film. As its title suggests, the film sees Eilish (a native Angeleno) paying homage to her hometown with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl — even performing alongside the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, which she grew up singing in.\n\nBut the concert film also addresses the pressures of fame like Happier Than Ever the album did. There's a stark contrast between the Eilish on stage, who is seemingly comforted by the lack of an audience inside the Hollywood Bowl, and an animated version of the star, who drives past Happier Than Ever billboards before arriving at a premiere with an overwhelming number of fans and flashing cameras. The film is more than a tribute to her hometown — it shows Eilish coming to terms with her own stardom.\n\nFestivals\n\nAs Eilish's star status has ascended, so has her name on festival lineups. Just like her own tours, she gives it her all for these performances, many of which become career-defining moments.\n\nShe first emerged on the scene at SXSW in 2017 and appeared at one of Lollapalooza's smaller stages the following year. But the budding star quickly rose among the ranks, securing bigger stages at festivals like Tyler the Creator's Camp Flog Knaw and Reading & Leeds. She officially graduated in the festival sphere in 2022 when she headlined Coachella and Glastonbury, making her the youngest headliner in the latter's festival history; she's since headlined Coachella, several iterations of Lollapalooza, and even recently became the latest Fortnite Festival headliner.\n\nEilish had another full-circle moment at Coachella 2024, when Lana Del Rey — one of Eilish's biggest influences — brought her out as a surprise guest. The pair performed Eilish's \"ocean eyes\" and Lana's \"Video Games,\" a fitting pairing as fans have often drawn comparisons between the two tracks. \"This is the voice of a generation!\" Del Rey exclaimed to the crowd following the duets. She might be onto something.\n\nThe Visionary\n\n\"When The Party's Over\" (2018)\n\nMusic videos play an integral role in Eilish's artistry, helping to set a visual stage for her narrative lyrics, with many of her videos connecting with each other. The video for the somber piano ballad \"when the party's over\" wasn't her first, but it officially exhibited the shock factor that she's now known for.\n\nArriving a few months before WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, the video shows the then blue-haired singer drinking a cup of black goo, which soon pours from her tear ducts, a visual that was inspired by a drawing gifted by a fan. The video was released a week before Halloween, making it a ghoulish holiday treat for Eilish fans.\n\n\"Bury A Friend\" (2019)\n\nThe singer brought her debut album's nightmarish themes to life for \"bury a friend.\" The video — reminiscent of films and series like The Exorcist, American Horror Story: Asylum and The Haunting of Hill House — accentuates the song's spookiness with dead eyes and needles pierced into Eilish's back. As she told Rolling Stone at the time, it's a visual representation of \"honing in on people's fears,\" a concept that has remained in Eilish's visuals to this day; she continues to face her own fear of water, as seen on HIT ME HARD AND SOFT's submerged album cover.\n\n\"Bad Guy\" (2019)\n\n\"bad guy\" may be the singer's most colorful music video to date, but don't let that fool you. Eilish's signature edgy tropes still remain intact — from her bloody nose, to decapitated heads in plastic bags, to the dimly lit crimson bedroom amplifying the trap-inspired switch at the song's end. In between those scenes, though, she pops out her Invisalign before going on a mini-cart joyride, proving that her personality can be just as goofy as it is moody.\n\n\"All The Good Girls Go To Hell\" (2019)\n\nThe \"all the good girls go to hell\" video picks up from where \"bury a friend\" left off, suggesting that Eilish's music isn't just meant to be listened to as standalone singles. Rather, there's intentional connective tissue that is revealed in her videos.\n\nThe syringes injected into Eilish's back gave her 25-foot-long white wings; she dramatically falls from the sky and into a black tar pit. She walks through a grim town while leaving a trail of oil behind her, causing fires to ignite with each step. A big advocate for climate change awareness, Eilish used \"all the good girls go to hell\" visual to show that her creative vision can spread important messages, too.\n\n\"Happier Than Ever\" (2021)\n\nThe title track of Eilish's sophomore album, Happier Than Ever, instantly became a fan favorite due to its contrasting two parts, beginning tender and soulful before lashing out into an alternative rock banger. The singer maintained the thrilling transition for the self-directed video, which showcases her knack for visual storytelling.\n\nThe video starts off with Eilish in a vintage-looking room before the lights begin to flicker. She then opens a door that fills the room with water, mimicking the track's flood of emotions. With a powerful song and video like this, she's clearly taken some cinematic tips from her film experiences.\n\n\"What Was I Made For?\" (2023)\n\nBarbie soundtrack highlight \"What Was I Made For?\" is a tender hug for women everywhere, including Eilish herself. The singer directed the accompanying video, which shows her donning a '50s-inspired Barbie look as she reflects on the past.\n\nSitting at a school desk, she hangs up miniature versions of her own outfits, including looks from videos like \"Bellyache\" and \"bad guy\" and the Gucci get-up she wore for her history-making night at the 2020 GRAMMYs. The video was a cleansing of sorts, as Eilish closed a chapter of her career before entering a new one with this year's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. Though her first video for her third album era — the '90s VHS-inspired \"LUNCH\" — showed more of her playful side, Eilish has certainly proven that she has plenty more tricks up her sleeve.\n\nAll Things Billie Eilish\n\nBillie Eilish has never been one to shy away from her feelings. In fact, she doubles down on them.\n\nSince her debut EP, 2017's Don't Smile At Me, the pop star has held listeners' hands as she guides them through the darkest pages of her diary. The EP found a teenage Eilish navigating heartbreak while her blockbuster debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? — which swept the General Field Categories (Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year and Best New Artist) at the 2020 GRAMMYs — was a chilling and raw look into her depression-fueled nightmares. And 2021's Happier Than Ever had her confronting misogyny and the weight of fame.\n\nShe could have easily succumbed to the pop star pressures for her third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, out today (May 17). Instead, she reverts to her sonic safe space: creating intimate melodies with her brother and day-one collaborator, FINNEAS. Only this time, the lyrics are more mature and the production is more ambitious.\n\n\"This whole process has felt like I'm coming back to the girl that I was. I've been grieving her,\" Eilish told Rolling Stone about how HIT ME HARD AND SOFT revisited elements of WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? \"I've been looking for her in everything, and it's almost like she got drowned by the world and the media. I don't remember when she went away.\"\n\nHere are five takeaways from Billie Eilish's new album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, where Old Billie is resuscitated and comforted by New Billie.\n\nHeartbreaking Ballads Are Her Sweet Spot\n\nTenderness remains at Eilish's core, and it's beautifully highlighted on HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. Despite her love for eccentric electro-pop beats, ballads have always been the singer's strong suit. After she first displayed that in her debut single, 2015's \"ocean eyes,\" Eilish won two GRAMMYs and an Oscar for her delicate Barbie soundtrack standout, \"What Was I Made For?\" — and the magic of her melancholic balladry returned on the new album.\n\nHIT ME's album opener, \"SKINNY,\" mimics the self-reflection of Happier Than Ever's \"Getting Older\" opener, where she painfully sings about Hollywood's body image standards. \"People say I look happy just because I got skinny/ But the old me is still me and maybe the real me/ And I think she's pretty,\" she muses.\n\n\"WILDFLOWER\" cuts in the album's center like a knife to the chest. Eilish's comparisons to a lover's ex-girlfriend are devastating over a bare piano melody — the simplest production on the LP: \"You say no one knows you so well/ But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt.\"\n\nHIT ME Isn't Afraid To Get A Little Weird\n\nWhat makes Eilish so intriguing is her effortless balance between misery and mischief. On lead single \"LUNCH,\" the singer/songwriter taps into the playful attitude of WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? smash \"bad guy.\"\n\nOver an upbeat and kooky production, she lets her carnal fantasies about devouring a woman run wild. The fantasies continue on \"THE DINER,\" with Eilish stepping into the stalker mindset that may be inspired by her own life (she was granted a five-year restraining order against an alleged stalker last year). \"I came in through the kitchen lookin' for something to eat/ I left a calling card so they would know that it was me,\" she winks on the chorus.\n\nShe Lays The \"Whisper Singing\" Criticism To Rest\n\nEilish's subdued voice has been chided as much as it's been lauded. She first gave naysayers the middle finger on Happier Than Ever's title track, nearly screaming in the song's latter half. On her latest album, she showcases her range even further, from bold belts to delicate falsettos.\n\nThe gauzy synths and vocal yearning of \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" is the perfect summer anthem, soundtracking the feeling of kissing your lover as the salty Los Angeles breeze runs through your hair. On the second half of \"THE GREATEST,\" she unleashes a wail-filled fury.\n\n\"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT was really the first time that I was aware of the things that I could do, the ways I could play with my voice, and actually did that,\" she recently told NPR Music. \"That's one thing I feel very proud of with this album — my bravery, vocally.\"\n\nHer Vulnerability Hasn't Waned\n\nEilish is quite the paradox, as her superpower is her emotional fragility. Her music has doubled as confessionals since the beginning of her career, and that relatable vulnerability threads HIT ME together. Despite its lighthearted nature, \"LUNCH\" marks the first time the singer has discussed her sexuality in a song.\n\n\"That song was actually part of what helped me become who I am, to be real,\" Eilish told Rolling Stone of \"LUNCH.\" \"I wrote some of it before even doing anything with a girl, and then wrote the rest after. I've been in love with girls for my whole life, but I just didn't understand — until, last year, I realized I wanted my face in a vagina. I was never planning on talking about my sexuality ever, in a million years. It's really frustrating to me that it came up.\"\n\nThen there's \"SKINNY,\" which is a raw insight into how much social media's discussions of her body and fame affected her. \"When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage/ I'm a dog in a dog pound,\" she sings. \"BLUE,\" the album's closer, finds Eilish accepting her state of post-breakup sorrow: \"I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you, but that's still not true.\"\n\nFINNEAS Has Unlocked A New Production Level\n\nFINNEAS — Eilish's brother, producer and confidant — has grown as much as his younger sister since they first began creating music together. He continues to challenge himself both lyrically and sonically to excitedly push Eilish to her creative limits. He explores a myriad of sounds on the album, with many playing like a two-for-one genre special. Named after Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away heroine, the glittery melody and thumping bassline on \"CHIHIRO\" transport you into an anime video game.\n\nThe first half of \"L'AMOUR DE MA VIE\" is deceptively simple with its plucking acoustic guitar strings, but soon finds itself under the glare of a disco ball with Eilish's vocals funneled through a vocoder. \"BITTERSUITE\" is arguably the best reflection of Finneas' experimentation: it starts out with Daft Punk-esque synths before dragging itself across a grim, bass-heavy floor. Then, it crawls into cheeky elevator music territory before ending with an alien-like taunt.\n\nHIT ME HARD AND SOFT is begging to be played live, as seen with fans' raucous reactions after the singer's listening parties at Brooklyn's Barclays Center and Los Angeles' Kia Forum. Fortunately for fans in North America, Australia and Europe, it won't be long before she brings the album to life — HIT ME HARD AND SOFT: THE TOUR kicks off on Sept. 29 in Québec, Canada.\n\nAll Things Billie Eilish\n\nAs music fans know, Friday is the official weekday of new releases — but this week began with a bang.\n\nOn Monday, May 13, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, released Atavista, a \"finished\" version of his 2020 album, 3.15.20. Back then, he released a nascent version of said album on his website, before pulling it down and uploading it to streaming services the following week, with guest appearances by Ariana Grande, 21 Savage and more.\n\nHappily, the finished product retains those inspired guest appearances, over polished and honed versions of the original tunes. With the release of Atavista, Glover released a music video for \"Little Foot Big Foot,\" featuring Young Nudy. He also promised special vinyl with visuals for each song, as well as an all-new Childish Gambino album due this summer.\n\nAnd before Friday even hit, two country superstars also delivered exciting new tracks. Also on May 13, Lainey Wilson unleashed \"Hang Tight Honey,\" the first single from her forthcoming third album, Whirlwind, out August 23. Three days later, Luke Combs released \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma,\" the lead track from TWISTERS: THE ALBUM. (Arriving July 19, the soundtrack will feature a number of other country greats, from Miranda Lambert to Shania Twain to Jelly Roll.)\n\nToday, there are plenty of other musical delicacies to savor. One of the most prominent is Billie Eilish's hotly anticipated third album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. Also, Puerto Rican rap star Álvaro Díaz's SAYONARA; American singer/songwriter Sasha Alex Sloan's Me Again; and 1D star Zayn's ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS have been unveiled. Even renowned actress Kate Hudson has also joined the musical ranks, releasing her debut album, Glorious.\n\nVeterans, too, are stepping out with fresh offerings. Psych-tinged retro rockers Cage the Elephant are back with their first album in five years, Neon Pill. Slash released Orgy of the Damned, an album of mostly blues covers featuring guests from Gary Clark Jr. to Iggy Pop to Demi Lovato. On the opposite side of the coin, boy band pioneers New Kids on the Block return with Still Kids, their first album in 11 years, featuring guests DJ Jazzy Jeff and Taylor Dayne.\n\nStill, that doesn't even begin to cover the trove of new songs delivered on May 17. Omar Apollo, Peggy Gou and HARDY released tracks from upcoming albums, and Russ (feat. 6LACK), Charlotte Cardin and T-Pain released inspired singles. What other treasures have this Friday wrought? Check the below list for albums and tunes to add to your weekend playlist!\n\nThe Avett Brothers — The Avett Brothers\n\nWith their previous album, back in 2019, Americana favorites the Avett Brothers declared they were Closer Than Together. Now, they're back with a self-titled album, and a return to their original label, Ramseur Records.\n\nBut that's just one way they're circling back to their roots; the Rick Rubin-produced The Avett Brothers returns to burning-rubber vocals; sturdy, folkloric melodies; and lovelorn lyrics. If those are your bag, don't miss tracks like \"Love of a Girl,\" \"Orion's Belt\" and \"Same Broken Bones.\"\n\nBebe Rexha, \"Chase It (Mmm Da Da Da)\"\n\nBebe Rexha's last album was 2023's Bebe, but this phenom of a pop singer/songwriter is already back with new music. Get warmed up for the impending summer sun with \"Chase It (Mmm Da Da Da),\" complete with a rip-roaring video.\n\nThe four-time GRAMMY nominee debuted her latest banger in the desert sands of Coachella 2024; if you're ready for the swooping, thumping official version, chase it down today.\n\nMeaningfully, \"Chase It (Mmm Da Da Da)\" marks Rexha's first solo dance track after numerous collaborations with electronic acts; she even earned back-to-back GRAMMY nods in 2023 and 2024 for jams concocted with David Guetta, and her only other release of 2024 so far was a collab with Brazilian DJ Alok.\n\nGalantis, Rx\n\nWe haven't gotten a new album from the beloved Swedish EDM duo Galantis in a hot minute; that just changed. Though they has released two albums since 2015's Pharmacy — 2017's The Aviary and 2020's Church — Galantis' latest album is a direct successor to their game-changing debut. Behold, the aptly titled Rx.\n\nRunning the gamut from ethereal textures to electrifying, pulsing rhythms, Rx directly reckons with Galantis's now-sole member Christian Karlsson's ADHD, and how medication was a game-changer in his life and work.\n\n\"Pharmacy was when I knew I was neurodivergent and I knew the studio was like a pharmacy for me,\" Karlsson stated in a press release. \"I was the patient. Rx is when I found medication. For me, it was key, but of course, everyone walks their own path.\"\n\nSaweetie — \"NANi\"\n\nBefore Saweetie officially released \"NANi,\" she had been teasing the track all week long. On May 11, at the 2024 Gold Gala, an annual gathering of top Asian Pacific and multicultural leaders, the rapper (who has Filipino and Chinese roots) told Billboard, \"NANi' is that girl. 'NANi' is main character energy.\" And on Instagram, as part of the cover art reveal for the single, she declared, \"We gon' fkkk up the Summer.\"\n\nShe certainly will. The poolside-partying, Smirnoff-plugging video lives up to a YouTube commenter's adroit description: \"It's giving Barbie and Bratz royalty!\" Will it be part of Pretty Bitch Music, the album she's been teasing (and honing) for years? Time will tell.\n\nWarren Zeiders — \"Betrayal\"\n\nWarren Zeiders staked his claim with his 2021 debut single, \"Ride the Lightning\"; now, he's got a stormcloud overhead. The uber-moody \"Betrayal\" makes no bones about its subject: \"This isn't how I pictured you and I/ Smile in my face while you twist the knife/ Shame on me if you fool me twice/ You fooled me twice.\"\n\nAs unremittingly bleak as the lyrics are, though, the budding country star's melody lets the light in. What an alchemy: the more Zeiders bemoans being chapfallen and frustrated, the lap steel-laced music evermore swoops and sparkles.\n\nMaría Becerra — \"IMAN (Two of Us)\"\n\nOnce a YouTuber, and now an urbano sensation, bubbly Argentine singer María Becerra is back with a four-on-the-floor stomper. The somewhat Dua Lipa-tinted \"IMAN (Two of Us)\" is a delight, as is its candy-coated video, where Becerra cavorts and romances through a surreal art exhibit.\n\nHer new album, MB3*, is expected sometime in 2024; it should also include tunes like \"Slow it Down,\" \"Do You (feat. 24kGoldn)\" and \"Agora.\" Let the earworm \"IMAN\" slake your thirst in the meantime.\n\nZayn — ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS\n\nBoy band acolytes will always long for the return of One Direction, who have been on hiatus since 2016. But in the meantime, their solo work just keeps getting sweeter. Following a three-year intermission, Zayn released ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS; for him, this music cuts to the quick of who he is.\n\n\"I think the intention behind this album fully is ​​for the listener to get more insight on me personally as a human being,\" Zayn explained in an Instagram post. \"My ambitions, my fears, and for them to have a connection with that and that's why it's so raw. It's just me.\"\n\nTaking six years to get right, and marking a return to Mercury Records, ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS is an unmistakable sonic and thematic evolution for the One Direction star. As with the other selections on this list, it's right on time for spring — let the songs of the season help you flourish, too.\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To Songs From Megan Thee Stallion, Camila Cabello & Lil Nas X, BTS' RM & More"
