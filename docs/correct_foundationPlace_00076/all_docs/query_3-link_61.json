        "text": "Nor sure to put this into the General or Beginners category…\n\nI am just now trying to jump into Pinegrow knowing very little about code such as HTML and CSS, as I am very used to having software write what I picture in my head. It is indeed sort of odd that after sixteen years of making websites I know so little of the actual coding, but can wrap my head around SEO and make Google and Bing work for me.\n\nSo before I learn brand new things that I have never done before when making a website, I want to start with Pinegrow doing what I already know how to do and like. Personally, I am not a fan of responsive websites and I much rather make a separate .mobi website for the mobile devices and give the desktop version a script to send the phone browser to the .mobi domain. Therefore when I do this, I start off in two different blank webpages and go from there, designing from my visions and plotting.\n\nMy question is then since responsiveness is not the concern, should I start of by using the HTML mode or the Bootstrap (which I know NOTHING about)? If I do start of in the HTML mode, what is the process of doing so? Are there any videos or instructions anywhere for this type of thinking?\n\nTIA!\n\n@Rgator to me it sounds like starting in plain HTML mode is probably what suits your needs, starting with Bootstrap would mean you are by default going to have a responsive site. So select plain html after clicking New Page then you will be presented with a blank page and you can drag any of the HTML elements on to it and build your layout as desired. I think for somebody with an SEO background that initially just adding content and then designing up your page might make the most sense. Hope this is of help, feel free to ask more questions and I’ll be happy to help guide you as best as I possible can.\n\n@Rgator\n\nA bit of a glaring problem here is… the HTML code you drag and drop are… just that!\n\nHTML code! no pretty shiny blocks and image holders and whizzy whazzy wotnots! just a rather barren skeleton that you must flesh out.\n\nAnd then style with CSS.\n\nYou can use PineGrows CSS editor for that. but, as you are visual and Dyslexic, you may just find that -It breaks your eyes!\n\nIt breaks mine! whenever I am away from it for a while, I have to try and \"tunnel* back into it … relearning as I go.\n\nThat’s why if you use the Bootstrap setting, you get lots of blocks - which are already done, BUT, come with a wad of CSS Overhead - to first style the Content blocks, but then, to also . alas for you… make them and the page as a whole, Responsive.\n\nI was just looking for library of NON responsive components… sheesh! it might be easier to make responsive sites now.\n\nlooks like it might just be time to stare at code… sad days indeed\n\nI am likewise aware of that @schpengle, I was just expanding upon the topic discussion of non-responsive + Bootstrap.\n\nPlus doesn’t it parallel with your first response of people using Bootstrap and Blocks for design and layout if they are not comfortable using pure HTML/CSS to create their designs without the need of a framework to provide quick scaffolding for them? In most cases people likewise use less than 90% of any given framework just to get a grid, menu, etc. They do it for ease of use or lack of knowledge and are left in the same situation you just described of having unnecessary bloat in the site.\n\nYep, but that was info for @Rgator who would be reading your reply more than for yourself. The code side is new to him. just so he would know, if he simply used Bootstrap but then clicked the magic button to murder responsiveness.\n\nI then went to look for libraries of NON responsive components for him (and me ) to play with… on the Internet!\n\nFAIL!\n\nI couldn’t, didn’t have the time as the Internet is soooo big. and so is the usage of the words Component and Library and Responsive. together!\n\nTrying to leave one out wasnt happening.\n\nA bit ago, I created a screencast which could clarify some things. Not only for Freeway users, but as well for you expert guys (if it isn’t too boring at least). But it could give you an insight of the Freeway user’s pain in butt.\n\nThe video can be found here:\n\nI tried to compare both products - and in a very raw way trying to explain the main things happening when working from scratch.\n\nIt was at the very beginning of my work with Pinegrow. So I’m curious what you say (don’t judge me too hard though).\n\nCheers\n\nThomas\n\nHi @Thomas, that’s a nice simple yet demonstrative example between the two. I would guess you may have probably scared off a lot of Freeway users though when they saw the differences needed between the two ;-). I am trusting the decisions being made for Pinegrow v3 concerning the new UI/UX will improve many aspects of the app, helping to benefit us all and those transitioning to the app as well.\n\nYour English is very good by the way.\n\nSide Note: Never having used FP, I wish they would have made the downloads full versions they left on their site with the closing their doors notice, since they abandoned it. It looks interesting and I always enjoy testing UI/UX of different apps. I saw on the softpress forum you considered Sparkle to be the replacement of Freeway, do you use it as it’s replacement?\n\nHi @Pinegrow_User\n\nOh - cool, yeah - it can indeed be read as you did, but it was meant the other way round:\n\nThe more people stepping to Sparkle, the better (for me and for them). My intention is not to scare people, it is more to prevent them from the wrong expectations. Pinegrow loves the code (cited from pinegrow.com) - an average FW user usually not.\n\nTo me, Pinegrow was the next logic step ahead. It’s about proving what I learned so far and slightly extend all my knowledge. And I expect that from all former FW users, too. In the sense of improving our new hometown*.\n\nThis is probably not in Softpress’ hand, but more a matter of former stakeholders being involved in the liquidation process. This is as well a reason, why I’m not handing out my serial -it’d feel somehow a betray.\n\nCheers\n\nThomas\n\nSide note:\n\n*Unfortunately all my good TalkMates stepped to Coda (long time ago) - and I was close to do this too. But I never understood this application. I’m pretty sure they’d be kept well and safe here in this community, flavoring the talks and the app. In fact, they’re much wiser than me.\n\n@Rgator, don’t you have issues with content not being updated on one or both? Where one site has one version and the other site has another? I have seen that before and confusing as to which site is the main one and which one I am suppose to buy from. Though they used either .net or .com and not .mobi or any of the other TLD’s available now.\n\nSomeone is, at whatever screen size the page changes to. Also you have not just CSS but Images that are duplicated and resized for different screen sizes as well so it is not just CSS and JS files. Though it beats having an entirely different site created on a new domain for each screen size.\n\nI did not like Adobe Muse in the beginning because it actually created three separate versions of the site depending on if it were Desktop, Tablet or Phone sized screen and then sent the user to that version.\n\nPersonally I don’t see any issue with the size of my CSS (Foundation or Bootstrap), even when it may appear large to other developers, but then again I don’t build resource heavy websites.\n\nFor example i’ve seen developers moan about the size of CSS, I then visit the websites they build and they take an age to load - websites overloaded with images/js and all these plug-ins, animation everywhere, choppy websites when you scroll.\n\nAs for responsive/non-responsive, for anyone serious about web development, you should focus on one website, make it responsive and forget about about .mobi websites, unless there is a specific reason for having .mobi, in terms of your users, although I can’t think of any reason why your end users would prefer a watered down .mobile version"
