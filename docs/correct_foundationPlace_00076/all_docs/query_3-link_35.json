There are a number of these Bootstrap Builders available (Pinegrow, Pingendo, Mobirise) and even web-based versions like the Free HTML 5 generator;\n\nThe only issue I have with Mobirise is the cost of the code editor. If it were more in line with the cost of other add ons then I think it would be OK but $70 does seem excessive considering other systems (the Free HTML 5 generator) allow you to directly change the source code.\n\nRegards,\n\nTim.\n\nOn 26 Jul 2016, at 19:31, David Smerdon email@hidden wrote:\n\nJust like so many of you, the demise of Softpress has hit me hard.

There are a number of Bootstrap builders out there - some are web applications others are dedicated Mac, Windows or Linux apps that are simply thin wrappers for the original web code. Unlike the majority of these tools Norm has taken Bootstrap as a core and has, and continues to, build on it. The UI for Blocs is very nice and you can see from the product history just how it has grown over the various versions with new features.\n\nPersonally I like Norm’s attitude to comparing his product with the competition and his reluctance to, potentially, bad mouth the competition. He gets my vote for that alone.\n\nRegards,\n\nTim.\n\nOn 29 Jul 2016, at 01:57, JDW email@hidden wrote:\n\nIf you’ve used Mobirise, surely you must know of Blocs 2:\n\nhttp://blocsapp.com http://blocsapp.com/\n\nTo my eyes, Mobirise and Blocs look like chips from off the same, well, block. I even asked the developer of Blocs (in another FWtalk thread) to offer us some thoughts that differentiate Blocs from other web design apps, but I got the standard “I prefer not to” answer. Even so, it almost seems like the two apps are clones. But who’s the clone, and is the clone better than the original copy?\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options\n\nTim,\n\nWhile I join you in appreciating Norm’s hesitation in speaking about competitive products (even for the sake of not giving them free advertising by the mere invoking of their name), the fact remains that the entire Freeway user base will be needing a Freeway replacement at some point and we therefore are doing the leg work now to compare a variety of apps on our own. But as we do that, some critically important differences among products may not be readily apparent to us, even after reviewing a trial app or briefly scanning documentation. Therein lies the basis for my query to Norm about what “sets Blocs apart.” The question is valid and can be answered without “badmouthing” anyone or other apps. Consider well what has long set Freeway apart from other apps, which is mere truth that exists regardless of those other apps.\n\nI don’t seek badmouthing. I seek an objective set of facts that aid in the decision making process on what is the best Freeway alternative for me and for those like-minded, noting that not all are like me and therefore our final app selections will differ.\n\nFor example, we know that Joe Workman has not only embraced RapidWeaver but he has expanded it with Foundation. In contrast, we know Blocs is built upon Bootstrap, as you just mentioned. And although you did say “bootstrap is a core” framework, no specifics were given about the merits of Bootstrap versus Foundation.\n\nWhile something entirely different, I know, Freeway was at its core an aging MacApp program. That underlying framework was great in its heyday but became outdated many years ago. Again, I know that Foundation and Boostrap are a very different category of things than MacApp, but looking at “the core” of an app tells us about the app. Bootstrap versus Foundation. And other valid and important comparisons can and should be made as well.\n\nIf I can get an insider to give me important clues as to why I should choose an app above others out there, I am going to try my best to glean that information, even if some consider it bordering on badmouthing other products. But for the record, I am not seeking a reply that says, “Our UI beats theirs, hands-down, and they will never catch up with us.” I agree that would be badmouthing (and interestingly sounds a bit like how Apple talks about itself), but that’s not what I seek. Just give me a tactful answer like, “I can’t speak for competitive products, but here are the lesser known aspects of our app that you may find interesting or important.”\n\nThat’s it in a nutshell.\n\nJames Wages\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nTodd, I actually read a comparison just last night which, in summary, said “there’s not much difference” and “it’s boils down to personal preference.” It was a very lengthy and detailed comparison, but in the end, that’s what it said.\n\nBut my previous post still stands. My previous post should not be interpreted as something limited to a Bootstrap versus Foundation comparison alone. When I ask a developer what sets their app apart from others, I am not asking for badmouthing of competitive apps. I am asking for “lesser known facts that differentiate the app.” If such info cannot be provided, regardless of reason, then of course my inquisitive mind wonders why. And then I proceed to ask the same question of a developer of another app; and if they answer me, I will naturally feel drawn toward their app a bit more for the sheer reason my query was at least in part satisfied.\n\nI hold no animosity toward any developer, regardless of whether they answer my “what differentiates your app?” query. But those who do answer, without badmouthing of course, get a plus in my book because they are aiding me and others in making a very difficult decision on what app we should choose to replace Freeway.\n\nThanks,\n\nJames\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nI think a problem occurs when a software developer promotes its own\n\nsoftware. When he pushes its advantages in front of the others, he should\n\nalso tell us whats less good in comparison with other programs. If he’s\n\nhonest. But that’s not very common if the software is needed to hold his\n\npants up. If it were my program I certainly would not want to emphasize the\n\ndisadvantages, would you?\n\nSo we will, searching for a good alternative, still need an independent\n\nperson to compare or do it by ourself. 50% Of working with software is the\n\nclick you get with its look & feel, its structure and joy of use. The other\n\nhalf are its features, compatibilty and speed of work. Based upon that\n\nfacts we will decide which one to choose.\n\nSometimes I just bought software/updates because I find the developers very\n\nsymphatetic and want to encourage them to go on with it, for perhaps latter\n\nuse. Like I did with Coffeecup RSD.\n\nDownload a trial, take your time for it on a lazy sunday. Do not just\n\nfiddle around but try to (re)build a site for ‘the real world’.\n\nAfter a hour or two you will discover which program will lead you by the\n\nhand and which one drives you insane.\n\nAnd read before those articles about software, who compared its main use\n\nalready for you. That will be your first shake up.\n\nSucces!\n\nAndries\n\n2016-07-30 8:30 GMT+02:00 JDW email@hidden:\n\nNorm,\n\nThank you for your reply (although perhaps it would be more appropriate if\n\nwe moved our dialog to the Blocs thread here on FWtalk). I fully agree\n\nwith you that using the trial will answer many questions. So why then does\n\nJames Wages ask so many questions prior to using the Blocs App trial?\n\nBecause the trial is only 7 days. That’s it in a nutshell. So as to get\n\nthe most out of those precious few days, I want to ensure I know exactly\n\nwhat I need to test before the trial goes “poof!” These are not my\n\nsentiments alone, but such are shared by others here in various threads.\n\nIt’s not a knock against you. It is merely an observation of fact.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJames Wages\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nInformation for existing FreewayTalk / Groups.io users - Site Feedback - Softpress Talk\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options\n\nI don’t think Norm could ever point out all the options positive, negatives etc of his app against others. If you’re working on commercial work that asking price is negligible over an extended period of time if only for a tool in your armoury.\n\nIf you weren’t happy with Freeway and that did more or less everything you needed in a round about way in places. You won’t like any of these new apps to rely solely upon. You’re going to have to go with the flow on this one.\n\n–\n\nDavid Owen\n\nOn 30 Jul 2016, at 07:30, JDW email@hidden wrote:\n\nSo as to get the most out of those precious few days, I want to ensure I know exactly what I need to test before the trial goes “poof!” These are not my sentiments alone, but such are shared by others here in various threads.
