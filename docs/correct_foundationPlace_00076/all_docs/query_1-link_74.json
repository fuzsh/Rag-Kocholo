        "text": "Chemical Alternative Processes\n\nToning Methods\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXlZtuFa1qA Toning tea and coffee\n\nmaking cyanotype prints into warmer tones using washing soda and tea (tannin)\n\nfrom alternativephotography.com\n\nToning black & white photographs with organic materials\n\nTerri Sprinkle gives plenty of tips how to tone and hand color black & white photographs, the classic way and the organic way.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy first experience with toning photographs came while taking classes to learn the art of hand coloring. I wanted to learn hand coloring as a way to enhance the black & white images that my husband was taking while he worked as a free-lance wedding photographer. The images were all his, of course, so it didn’t take long for me to yearn to apply these wonderful techniques to my own photographs. Ultimately, I found myself in a series of beginner’s photography, as well as darkroom and development, classes. A somewhat backwards approach, yes – but I believe this makes me walking proof that even the most circuitous route can still get you where you want to be!\n\nToning B&W prints is a wonderful way to add dimension to a photograph, enhancing or sometimes even changing the mood of an image.\n\nEven in this digital age we are fortunate to have a wide variety of product choices. From classic toners, such as sepia and selenium, to the less toxic, creative use of coffee and food coloring, possibilities abound! This article will touch on many of them, show some samples from my own work, and ultimately hopes to pique your interest into incorporating some of these products into your darkroom work to enhance and expand your own creative vision.\n\nToning… the “classic” way\n\nThere are extensive volumes available that are dedicated to toning with commercially prepared solutions for easy use, some even including formulas for those home chemists among us who prefer to mix their own solutions, with great results. This article will not attempt to supercede or supplant these writings, but will include a suggested reading list at the end from authors I can highly recommend.\n\nFor many of us, using commercially prepared toners gives us the exact results we are after. The trick with most of these preparations is to appreciate that, in most cases, the manufacturer’s suggested mixing instructions tend to produce the “heaviest” of results, while in reality, better control and more creative outcomes can be had from deviating from the packaged instructions. If you want, for instance, a completely toned sepia print, from the lightest to darkest tonal range, the printed directions for using the “Part A” bleach (from many commercially prepared sepia toners) will serve you well. You will slip your print into the bleach at full strength, and gently agitate or rock the toning tray until your image completely disappears. After a wash, you will then slip your bleached-out print into the toner (“Part B”) and watch in delight as your print returns nearly instantaneously, and you rock the tray only for a matter of seconds or minutes until you get your desired, full sepia tones. Simple enough!\n\nBut what if you are more interested in retaining some actual black in your print, that Dmax you worked to achieve in your initial development? This is where the concept of “split toning” comes into play, and where you begin to want to control the bleaching process to retain those blacks. If you choose to dilute the bleach to a weaker solution than is suggested in the directions, the bleaching process will slow down considerably and give you much more control over it. In addition, certain papers may react much differently to the same bleach/toning solutions, giving you even further choices while planning to tone your print. Experimentation will be your guide, keeping careful notes as you go.\n\nToning… the “organic” way\n\nFor those of us who want to “tone” a print without the use of chemicals, there are some options. The most important thing to keep in mind when toning with organic materials is that you are not increasing the archival properties of your print with their use. The chemical reactions to the silver halides imbedded in photographic paper emulsions are not in play here, as the “toning” is really an overall staining of the print. Think of any time you spilled coffee, tea, or wine on your clothing or, even worse, your mother’s best white tablecloth, and you can well visualize the same effects on your print! While thisstaining does last for several years and keeps your home free of potentially dangerous chemicals, it will not extend protection of your print from the eventual effects of decay. If you have an important print you wish to tone, organic materials may not be the best choice.\n\nNote: Certain prepared toners, such as copper and iron (blue), are also not recommended if your aim is to improve the archival stability of your print. For that purpose, sticking with the classics such as sepia, selenium and gold formulas will be your best bet.\n\nLet us now review some of the more common organic materials used for toning.\n\nRed wine\n\nToning with a deep red wine is quite straightforward. There is no mixing, or even diluting required. Simply uncork a bottle of inexpensive red wine and pour into a tray. Depending on your print size, one 750 ml bottle will suffice in an 8×10″ tray. Pre-soaking your print in a tray of clean water helps soften and open the fibers of a fiber-based paper, which will shorten the time needed in the wine and lets the wine absorb evenly. Anywhere from two to ten minutes will do. Slip the dampened print into tray of wine. Start by checking every minute or two until you achieve the desired color. As this is an actual, overall dyeing of the print, your borders as well as the back of your print will also absorb color. If you wish to keep clean borders, applying a frisket prior to the soak works well. Inspect your highlights under good light, rinsing the wine off in cool running water. Allow the print to dry overnight.\n\nCoffee and tea\n\nBoth coffee and tea are also fairly straightforward materials with which to tone. Each can impart a lovely light tan to near-sepia color. Simply brew regular strength coffee and allow to cool, then pour into a tray. For tea, the use of 4-6 tea bags a liter will suffice. Black tea is recommended as imparting the richest color. Again, pre-soaking a print in clean water allows for easier and more even absorption. You may feel the urge to rock the tray, as with commercially prepared toners a fresh swirl of the chemistry encourages even toning, but it is not really necessary. Inspect your print every couple of minutes until you achieve the desired tone. A shorter time in tea or coffee will give you a light, tan color, while extending the time will intensify the color to a deeper brown.\n\nTake care to mask off any highlight areas you do not want to tone. Again, your borders will also absorb the color. When inspecting, don’t hesitate to rinse the print in gently running water. When done, you may pat the borders dry and allow the print to dry overnight.\n\nFood coloring\n\nFood coloring is another easy choice in organic toning. The recent move towards gel preparations, as opposed to the thinner solutions that were dispensed drop by drop, offers the artist better control over mixing shades – much like spreading paints on a palette. These food coloring gels allow you to mix primary colors from the individual tubes of color that come in each box. Some brands offer blending directions. Using a toothpick, you can mix up secondary, even tertiary shades in seconds, depending on your patience and mixing skills. You can use any type found at your local supermarket. The three primary colors are provided, plus a secondary, generally a green. These gels are more intense in pigment, so not much is needed. Drop your blended mixture into a tray of room temperature water with about 1 tablespoon of white vinegar added per liter. It will dissolve quickly. If you wish to adjust the shade, blend color outside of the tray before adding to make sure you are keeping ratios correct.\n\nIf you wish to use a single color straight from the tube, simply squeeze out a small amount directly into the tray.Use more for intense color and shorter times in the tray – less for extended tray time that afford better control over the process, much like general chemical toning. Again, the use of a painted-on mask or frisket is good for repelling color. Once the desired tone is achieved, rinse off the print, pat gently and allow to dry.\n\nHand coloring after toning\n\nThis is one of the processes I enjoy as a continued way to add color to a toned B&W print. You may either apply color to an area that was masked to prevent toning, or apply additional pigment over a toned area. If you plan on applying additional color after toning, choose your silver gelatin paper accordingly. A matte or semi-matte surface takes photo oils, oil or wax pencils, chalks, etc., very well, while glossy surfaces do not. It is possible to apply pigment to a glossy surface by use of a “workable fix” type of spray, but it is an added step that can be avoided by choosing emulsion surfaces that are better suited for this purpose. When using pastel chalk, there is no need to prep the toned print – simply color as desired and blend with cotton swabs. When using photo oils, applying a prepared medium to your toned print is recommended, such as the PMS that comes with Marshall’s photo oils – and it will not affect your toned print. If, however, you are only adding a small amount of color using photo oil pencils, you can skip this step.\n\nToning with organic materials is fun and easy.\n\nThe strong advantage is keeping harsh chemicals out of the household. You can experiment with a wide variety of these materials, and cleanup is still a breeze!\n\nsource: Cyanotype toning: the basic April 1, 2011 by mpaulphotography\n\n“No one but a vandal would print a landscape in red, or in cyanotype.” (Peter Henry Emerson: Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art, London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington, 1889) Citation courtesy of Luminous Lint/Mike Ware.\n\nI happen to agree with Mr. Emerson so I tone pretty much all of my cyanotypes. I have several posts about different toners and how they (generally) look, but this post will go over the basic process of toning and try to troubleshoot a few common problems.\n\nToning a cyanotype involves two basic steps: a bleach phase, and a toning phase. Every toner I know of contains some type of tannin in it: tannin chemically binds to the iron in the emulsion and changes the color. If I understand this process correctly, it produces a form of gallic acid – used in dyes and inks, especially medieval ones. I’ve read that gallic acid is normally corrosive, but I’ve never found this to be the case with toned cyanotypes.\n\nIf you’re concerned about the archival quality of your toned cyanotypes, Dr. Mike Ware (inventor of the “New” cyanotype process) has said that his family photo albums contain what he’s pretty certain are toned cyanotypes – because they look very similar to other alternative processes it’s easy to confuse with Van Dyke prints or Kallitype prints. I’ve personally never had issues with mine – I’ll get back to you in some 20 years or so and see if that’s still the case.\n\nKeep in mind that toners are funny things – you can mix and match things, you can vary the sequence of bleach and toner and get different results. I have a lot of good results with simply leaving the prints in the toner for long periods of time without bleaching at all. Take things one at a time – don’t try to tone or bleach multiple prints together. Experiment and have fun with it! Just remember that the key to a successful toned print is to wash well between steps.\n\n1. Toning Preparations:\n\nBefore you start your toning, always:\n\nAge your prints at least 24 hours for the emulsion to harden.\n\nPre-wet your prints in filtered water to allow the solutions to penetrate the paper fibers evenly.\n\nIt’s a good idea to have multiple prints – toning is fickle, you never know what you’re going to get.\n\nPlan to leave the print face down for long periods of toning, or plan enough time to “babysit” the print – agitate it while face up in the toner.\n\n2. The Bleach Phase:\n\nBleaching is a tricky thing. The purpose of bleaching is to help break down the iron a little so that the tannin in the toner can “grab on” easily. If your water is heavily chlorinated, you may not even need to bleach your prints.\n\nHow much you bleach really depends on how you coat, how much emulsion is on the paper, and what toner you’re using. If you bleach too far, you lose shadow density. If you bleach too little, your shadows will stay a stubborn blue shade while your highlights cooperate.\n\nBleach types: the most common form of bleach solution is Sodium Carbonate. That’s Washing Soda, usually found in your grocery store’s cleaner aisle, or at a photography chemical supply store. Don’t confuse this with Sodium Bicarbonate – baking soda – it won’t react the same way.\n\nOther types of bleach that I’ve used are Ammonia and regular chlorine bleach. Ammonia stinks, horribly, and usually produces a browner image. Chlorinated bleach destroys paper fibers and is better left to your laundry.\n\nMy typical bleach solution is about 1-2 teaspoons of Sodium Carbonate combined with 1 Liter of water. If your print turns a bright purple the second you place it in the solution, it’s too strong. Play with the solution until you’re comfortable with the rate of bleaching. As you practice bleaching, you’ll notice that it’s a good idea to yank the print out a few seconds before you think it’s ready – the print will continue to bleach a bit while starting to rinse.\n\nAlways rinse the print well in running water between the bleach phase and the toning phase.\n\n3. The Toning Phase:\n\nAll cyanotype toners are pretty much variations on a black/brown/purple theme. Certain toners are more efficient and stain less, while other toners produce a wider range of possible colors. Keep in mind that all toners will stain your paper base a little despite your best efforts. (please note that the following links lead to blog post about the toners, or examples of the toner shade.)\n\nTea toner: Most tea toners that I use are brewed for about 10 minutes in 25o mL of hot water, then added to a 1.5 Liter of room temperature filtered water. I use about 8-10 small tea bags, not a very accurate measurement! Every type of tea has a different quality or color to it – make sure that you use teas with tannin in them like black tea or green tea – white tea, red tea, and most herbal teas don’t have enough tannin to do anything to your print.\n\nGreen tea produces an eggplant/black shadow, and is so mild that it doesn’t stain the paper base too badly. If you’re toning a high key image, green tea will sometimes produce a really cool pink highlight. It has a tendency to split tone for me because of my double coat of emulsion.\n\nBlack tea will stain your paper the most, but it produces a lovely warm black/brown shade that’s nearly impossible to get anywhere else. I generally use a Lipton tea product for iced tea, but any black tea will work. If you want an easy split toner with warm highlights and blue shadows, black tea is the fastest way to get it.\n\nEarl Grey tea: avoid this one – it has a lot of oils in it that can damage your print.\n\nTea toners work really well with a minimum of bleaching, but they do require a longer immersion for the iron to shift. I normally tone prints in tea for about 2 hours, but depending on the print, it’s taken up to 8 hours. Some people suggest that tea toners should be hot for a faster toner – in my experience that shaves about 30 minutes off the toning time, and stains the paper much worse. It’s a good idea to let the print sit in clean filtered water for about 10 minutes before the final rinse to help remove some of the excess tannin. All tea toners should be used freshly brewed – they lose potency after a day and should not be reused.\n\nTannic Acid Toner: This stuff is a royal pain to work with. It can produce the closest thing to a true black, but it’s far more likely to screw up, or produce a weird purply brown shade. It has the widest range of color tones that I’ve seen in a toner, but you have absolutely no control over what you get. Be extremely careful how much bleaching you do, because this toner is totally unforgiving if you go the slightest bit too far.\n\nDone well, this toner produces the least paper staining – however, I’ve run into some chemical issues that I don’t quite understand that leave my paper the shade of cardboard. (I’ve narrowed it down to interactions with the tap water, or the age of the toner.)\n\nTannic Acid is produced from wood chips, and is extremely hard to mix into a solution. It’s a gummy mess. Because of this it’s difficult to estimate how much I use, but generally about a Tablespoon mixed into a Liter of water is a good place to start (and then remove the gummy bits.) A good tannic acid solution should be almost clear, and will take a minute of sitting in filtered water to fully tone out. Toning times for tannic acid are usually quite short.\n\nIf mixed with distilled water, tannic acid toner will last for a few weeks/months. A little mold is normal, just filter the solution every time you use it. Once the solution starts turning a dark brown or granulating (tiny little granules appear – not sure what they are) it’s time to start fresh. Tannic acid is also quite expensive, and only available at a photography chemical supply store like Photographer’s Formulary.\n\nCoffea Toner: I love coffee toner. It’s a cold toner, as opposed to the warmer tea shades, and it leaves the paper pretty close to the original color. It will still stain, just not as badly as tea. Coffee doesn’t produce a true black, but more of a blue/black like a blackbird’s feathers. The highlights will stay pretty clean so make sure your contrast is good and your highlights aren’t blown out.\n\nI generally use the cheapest instant coffee I can find – about 4-5 heaping tablespoons of instant coffee dissolved into 250 mL of hot water, then added to 1.5 Liters filtered room temperature water. I’ve read that other people have great success re-brewing used coffee grounds – since I don’t drink coffee I can’t exactly test this.\n\nCoffee toner doesn’t seem to take quite as long as tea toner, but expect at least an hour of toning, perhaps more. Again, it’s a good idea to let the print rest in a water bath before the final rinse.\n\nWine Tannin: This is my new favorite toner, and I don’t have that much experience with it yet. So far, it produces a nice dark shadow and a brown/tan highlight on a fairly regular basis. It can be rather fickle if you keep the solution for a long period of time, so I suggest storing this toner no more than a month.\n\nWine tannin is basically the same thing as tannic acid, but produced from a different source. It’s designed to use in microbrewing so it mixes into solution a lot easier. It leaves the paper almost paper white, producing almost no staining. It’s slightly cheaper than tannic acid, but since it requires more to produce the same effect – half an ounce of wine tannin mixed into 1 L of water – the price is probably pretty close. I use the powdered version, but some stores have a liquid solution available.\n\nWine tannin has a tendency to put any coating discrepancies on display. Unless I use the Christopher James variation listed in the link (toss the print into the tannin instead of bleaching first) I lose some of my highlight detail. Like the tannic acid, it works pretty quickly. Wine tannin also has a weird chemical reaction that can turn my paper to a cardboard brown, requiring a water bath before the final rinse.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\n1. My print looks faded! What happened? You probably bleached the print too far. Try test strips in varying times to get a better idea of what works – the ideal is to tone your shadows dark without losing highlight details. Usually this means bleaching until the shadows are a dark purple and the highlights are slightly yellow.\n\n2. I left the print in the toner forever, but it’s still blue! What now? Rinse the print for at least 5 minutes and go back to the bleach bath. After bleaching again – just a little, rinse it again for 5 minutes and put it back in the toner. Your initial bleach probably didn’t break the iron down enough.\n\n3. The print toned nicely, but now that it’s dry I hate it! Why does it look so flat? I don’t know why, but that’s normal for a toned cyanotype. Try brushing a diluted solution of acrylic gloss medium onto the print to bring back the shadow depth and give the surface a little shine. It will look like it did when the print was wet.\n\n4. Why can’t I produce the same results each time? What am I doing wrong? Nothing. That’s a quirk of toning. If you have a batch of prints that need to look similar, try toning them all at the same time with the same solution. Otherwise you run the risk of variations that you may or may not like. If you’re still having issues, stick with the basic tea toner – it’s a little less fickle.\n\n5. My print looks mottled – it didn’t tone evenly. What’s going on? If you’re leaving the print in the toner for a long period of time, make sure you place it face down. Paper floats oddly, and you may end up with “dry” spots that don’t tone evenly. If you’re toning face up, make sure you agitate the print constantly.\n\n6. My print has a bright blue round spot on it! Yup, the curse of the air bubble strikes again. Make sure the print is lying face down – ease the print into the toner slowly and work all the air bubbles out past the far edge. If you already have the blue spot on it, try a quick rinse, bleach bath, and return the print to the toner for a bit to remove the blue.\n\n7. My shadows are blah. What happened to my perfect exposure? Your original shadows need to be a nice, deep, cobalt blue to tone dark. If your shade of cyanotype isn’t dark enough, it’s not going to tone well. Read this tutorial and do some experimenting with your paper and your developer first before you try toning again.\n\nChemigrams Follow these Instructions!\n\nThe chemigram\n\nChristina Z. Anderson tells us how to make chemigrams and shows plenty of examples from her students innovative work. This text is excerpted from The Experimental Photography Workbook.\n\nThe chemigram process was discovered by Pierre Cordier on November 10, 1956. It is a unique process that uses resists on photographic paper much the same way as wax is used as a resist in batik.\n\nWhat Cordier discovered in 1956 was that a resist can hold back the chemical effects of developer and fixer on black and white photo paper for a time. Paper put into developer that has been exposed to normal room light for varying periods of time will turn black, except where a resist blocks the chemical reaction. The parts of the paper protected by the resist will continue to change color from extended exposure to room light, of course.\n\nLikewise, paper put into fixer turns white, except where a resist blocks the chemical reaction. The parts of the paper protected by the resist continue to change color from the room light exposure, and suddenly there is the possibility of black, white, and colors in-between on normally monochrome paper.\n\nWith a back and forth from developer to fixer or fixer to developer, the resist begins to dissolve, so the next chemical bath either turns slowly exposing paper under the dissolving resist black (developer) or white (fixer) or some color in-between because of the now-lengthening room light exposure. With time this dissolution can be coaxed into creating beautiful, intricate patterns.\n\nThe chemigram process is actually very simple, using common household ingredients and common darkroom chemistry. There is no end to experimentation with this nonfigurative, physico-chemical process.\n\nExamples of resists\n\nNail polish\n\nWax Oil\n\nCellulose varnish\n\nAcrylic varnish\n\nAcrylic medium\n\nSyrups such as honey\n\nEgg\n\nGlue or adhesive\n\nLacquer or resin\n\nFelt tip pens\n\nRemovable adhesive plastic, sticky labels\n\nTape\n\nLiquid mask or rubber cement\n\nExamples of choices to make along the way\n\nThe different choices that can be made at any juncture are summed up in the following extensive but not exhaustive list.\n\nPaper type and brand, warmtone or cooltone\n\nPaper age—don’t neglect outdated/fogged paper!\n\nResist, from thick to thin, full strength to diluted, soft and syrupy to hard and water-resistant, etc.\n\nAdditions to the resist—sugar, salt, for instance\n\nResist applied in the darkroom or in room light\n\nResist applied with a brush, spray, stencil, silk screen, roller\n\nLength of time the resist is allowed to dry before the developer and fixer baths\n\nExtending the resist on all or parts of the paper\n\nIncised lines or drawing into the resist\n\nFixer, diluted – full strength\n\nDeveloper, diluted – full strength\n\nToners\n\nStrength of light source, from dimroom to sun\n\nLength of light source\n\nLength of time in each bath\n\nMethod of application of the baths, whether by tray, brush, spray, through a stencil, from a bottle, with a roller\n\nWhich bath first, which bath next\n\nSprinkles of dry chemicals with a salt shaker\n\nNonfigurative versus photo-based or somewhere in-between—e.g. through a silk screen\n\nThe chemigram process\n\n1Take the BW photo paper that is going to be used out of the black plastic light-safe bag in the darkroom and put it into another bag. The rest of the process can be carried out in room light.\n\n2Set up four trays: developer, water, fixer, and water, in that order. The developer could be normal strength – dilute. Likewise with the fixer, but for this first attempt, use fixer working strength and developer 1+5.\n\n3Take a resist of choice—start simple, e.g. butter, maple syrup, honey, Pam—and coat the paper carefully and artfully. Varnish works better thin. Syrup works fine thick.\n\n4Incise a few lines into the resist. When the resist goes back and forth in and out of the chemistry, the resist disintegrates faster around the line, the line becomes wider, more distressed, and chemistry will react with the successively exposed photo paper underneath that is no longer protected. The paper will develop a darker line and then a paler line every time the paper is put through the developer/fixer cycle.\n\n5With the trays all set up ready to go, slip the BW paper coated with the resist in either the developer to get a black background, or the fixer to get a white background. Meanwhile the paper will be turning color in room light—brown, yellow, mauve, blue, pink—that’s OK. Don’t touch the resist just yet.\n\n6Whenever the paper looks finished developing or fixing, move it to the water wash. Rinse well enough, still not touching the surface and marring the resist, and then put it in the opposite tray of fixer or developer, respectively. If the water wash is not used, there will be contamination between the developer and the fixer which can produce chemical fog and dichroic silver, another option to consider.\n\n7The resist will start its dissolution process, some resists sooner than later. Surprisingly, butter doesn’t dissolve too quickly. Honey will. Wherever the resist starts to dissolve, the underneath area will either turn lighter (fixer) or darker (developer), and with each back and forth, concentric areas of dark and light will begin to form like tree rings. Depending on the resist, the rings can have hard edges, mottled edges, or soft edges. Honey, for instance, is very soft and silky.\n\n8The decisions are numerous. How long in each bath can be a minute or 10 minutes or hours. What the process teaches is patience, and going with the flow, both literally and figuratively. It is not necessarily quick.\n\n9When the chemigram is done, get as much of the resist off as archivally possible, and then do a final fix, archival wash, and dry.\n\nDarkroom Experiments & Techniques\n\nHUA 239 Alternative Photography—Darkroom Experiments with Professor Jaimie Lyle Gordon\n\nStudents—I will demo these techniques-please familiarize yourself with them and pick several to produce some final images with for your presentations.\n\nYou will find further technical info and instructions including images examples on the class blogsite under “posts”\n\nSolarization\n\n—we got to play around with this a bit but I would like for you to take it a bit further. Some important considerations too—if using solarol (not sure if lab has it or not) it allows for your solarized print to yield rich blacks and bright whites because print develops fully (full development time) before it’s reexposed to light—guaranteeing solarization and amazing mackie lines that develop between the light and dark areas of the print. High contrast prints exaggerate this best. Pick a neg with good contrast—you can add a #5 filter and rc paper actually yields greater solarization.\n\nYou can even use solarol on film too. It’s best to use weak dektol—so this time we will use a diluted solution—and instead of the flashlight tests we did last time—it’s better to use a 75 watt reg incandes bulb for re-exposure over dev tray. When doing solarization because we’re using white light make sure prints are done one at a time and fellow students prints are safe in fixer before beginning a re-exposure with white light.\n\nIt’s best to cut off about 10% exposure time for solarized prints –and the shorter the initial exposure under enlarger the more negative looking the solarized print will appear when you re expose it. Opposite is true—the longer the exposure under enlarger the more positive looking the solarized print will appear when you re expose it. The longer you let print come up in developer the more pronounced mackie lines will be when you reexpose it to light and the shorter you leave it in developer before reexposure to light the less pronounced mackie lines will be. You can also contact print your solarized images using them as a paper negative. Here is easy handout you can print out http://blogs.ccsd.edu/south-art-dept/files/2013/01/Solarization-1lx7set.pdf\n\nBasic Directions:\n\n-make initial exposure in enlarger with negative or photogram–do it at about 10% less than you should\n\n-put it into developer (make sure dev is no more than 70 degrees) when it comes up about 1/3 of the way (20 sec rc-40 sec fiber) take it out and put it into tray of water or squeegee the dev off of it you’re trying to stop the dev process without fixing it-you could use very diluted stop bath but water or squeegee is fine–some people blot print dry to avoid streaks–some like streaks–by making printing more dry before 2nd exposure and getting rid of standing or running water you have more control–for example at this point you could do combo chemgram by selectively painting on fixer or using a penlight with more detailed solarizing details.\n\n-put it under enlarger and reexpose it with either 40 watt bulb 2 ft away or use enlarger light at f 11 do it no more than couple seconds–you could also walk out into white light as well–less control though=\n\n-bring it back over to sink and put it back into developer (some people use diluted developer–or use solarol for whole dev process so they get true blacks)–After the secondary exposure has been completed, the print should normally be slid very gently back beneath the surface of the developer, and development should be completed without agitation (as it destroys the formation of the Mackie lines) until the desired state is reached, usually a little less than half the total time for a straight print. Watch it carefully pull it before it goes to far–Processing can then continue as normal.\n\nCLICHE VERRE: I really like the smoked glass method that involves tracing and wiping away—as I showed you example in class I made–but we can’t do that in school obviously no open flame—but the block ink method can be interesting too where you can etch some drawings or use combination of ink to opaque out what you don’t want –—want you to try tracing an image through the glass you can use dry erase markers—I’ll bring some—or you can paint with brushes too—just remember if using dry erase markers keep the right side up—you would use contact printing for this but you could also project an image down and contact over it too—perhaps you want to etch something over a projected image. We will do this again—think too about the link I sent you with Morrell’s cliché verre’s of botanicals set into the ink and built up with layer…lots of possiblities to combine drawing, etching with photography.\n\nPainting a Print With a penlight: An interesting and fun technique is to project an image onto easel and expose it and then insert red filter and use penlight that has an opaque paper wrapped around it to direct the light like an aperture (the coast company has some really good penlight choices) you can trace what you want our of the image—it’s like you’re drawing or outlining on top of image. You can also do a combination of solarization too which adds another dimension—with either full solarization of following it during development rather than in the enlarger with red filter…\n\nMultiple Exposure in the Darkroom: Lots of ways to do this—from sandwiched negs to composite prints-to making an exposure onto paper at 50% taking out neg putting another neg in using red filter!! and then re exposing. Doing multiple test strips on a print in all different directions! Printing portions of negatives and changing the enlarger focus! Projection images in combination with photograms objects put directly in contact with print—or negatives contacted and projected at same time! Sandwiching the negative in a glass carrier with other negative or other materials that are on transparent or even using stencils in combination with negatives..hmmmm…lots and lots of patience and forethought as to your combinations. Also very important to have some tracing paper and pencil on hand.\n\nDirections for composite printing on multiple enlargers: (Jerry used MANY enlargers all at the same time!) He has each neg set up in a different enlarger with a different mask ready. It could be done with one enlarger, you’d just have to swap out the negs each time and replace your masks.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsVDXjthsaU WATCH THIS!\n\nhttp://www.pdngallery.com/legends/uelsmann/ this link gives step by step description on how he did these images—process and perception was the name of one of his books and he exemplifies this !\n\nLook for 2 images to combine—once you’re adept you can try to combine more. Look for images with clear horizontal or vertical dividing line. It simplifies blending process.\n\nPlace each image in a different enlarger.\n\nSize and focus images allowing them to overlap slightly.\n\nPut a piece of plain white paper in the first easel. Use a marker to indicate placement of major objects in photo and where blending line will be.\n\nMove this paper to the second easel and line up the second image and blending line with the indicated marks.\n\nMake a test strip to determine the correct exposure for each enlarger.\n\nPlace your light sensitive photo paper in the first enlarger and make the exposure using an opaque board to block the exposure around the blending line. Keep the board moving and allow some of the exposure to cross the blending line so there is no visible joining line.\n\nTransfer the light sensitive paper to the second easel. Don’t turn the paper around or get confused about the orientation—insert it into this 2nd easel and expose the 2nd negative using the opaque board in the same manner of step 7 to block the first exposure.\n\nExpect to carry out this procedure many times until you master moving the board to get a seamless blend-patience and craftsmanship are necessary to create this illusion.\n\nUsing Opaque Printing Masks: Uelsmann exposes parts of one photo onto the final print while he masks other areas,...\n\nSelective Development; Selectively paint developer with brush on certain areas—perhaps do some fixer staining on the print..this is more like Chemigrams which can be quite interesting.\n\nPhotograms: Objects directly on paper—raised off of paper—set up in front of paper tape paper to wall illuminate them from other light source—do combination projected image and photogram together..put objects on glass if you want to repeat—do combination solarization and photograms too…try some text on transparency—use materials—I’ll bring in some of my interesting junk to use! Don’t forget moving objects across paper—water–stencils–translucent and mixing of textures—try to work bigger—think of symbolism of the objects you are using.\n\nDiptiks and triptiks—select pair of images you think would work that are next to each other on neg strip and then pick a triplet section—we will project this grouping of negs on 4×5 enlarger and 80mm lens should work ok for 35mm negs longer for med format negs. We will need to block off areas on neg carrier with some pieces of cardboard and tape. Creating sequences in this way is important to understanding your work outside of the primary image alone.\n\nWall GRID WORK: Think about creating some images that will work well as large wall grid—I want you to try and look at some of your 8×10 and 11×14 or bigger prints you have and bring them in when we work on collage and montage—but perhaps you might come up with something abstract with some of the processes above and want to use them all together.\n\nRETICULATION TO A NEGATIVE: can be a happy accident when you do it purposely! Find some negatives you don’t care about ruining or taking the chance of enhancing to try this out.\n\nHere’s a fool proof way of reticulating the emulsion!\n\nProcess the film normally. Fix using a non-hardening fixer (important). Wash as usual.Mix some Sodium Carbonate (arm and hammer washing soda), up to 1 ounce per liter.Water must be somewhere between 100-160°F.\n\nSoak the desired negative in the solution. Once desired effect is obtained, wash in cold water and dry. If crystals are present on the dried negative, wipe dry crystals off and re-wash negatives.\n\nHigher concentrations give a more wrinkled effect. Higher temperatures accelerate the reaction.\n\nLow concentration at low temperature gives a leopard skin look. High concentrations at high temperature will peel the emulsion off. When the emulsion is soft, it is possible to manipulate it with solid objects or imprint textures in it like Time-Zero films. Drying of the negatives takes longer than average, rolling a clean tennis ball across the film gives an interesting texture\n\nwhat else can you do to “destroy” or “distress’ your negatives and give them a re-birth—scratch them-burn them-put alcohol ink on them-Use the tiniest scratching tool possiblefor 35mm negatives, because with enlargement, the scratches will be huge and dominate your image. A quilting “between” needle embedded in a pencil eraser might do the trick. They are smaller, stubbier, needles and thus are less bendable. Watch your scratching process so you make smooth, fine marks, or the lines will appear jagged and distracting. When you scratch on the top/non-emulsion side of the negative, refraction will produce white lines on your print. When you scratch on the bottom/emulsion side of the negative, the scratches will remove emulsion and produce black lines in the print. If you are using a color negative, the scratches will produce black and whitish lines and also different colors. These are general rules of thumb, anyway.\n\nScratch words into the top of the negative. Write with a pencil on top of the image, and the graphite will act as density and print lighter. Scratch an empty space in one negative and sandwich another negative with it when printing, so the second negative will print through the cleared area. Scratch and burn at the same time, manipulating the plastic while it is warm.\n\nCOMPLETE DIRECTION FOR CHEMIGRAMS\n\nhttp://penumbrafoundation.tumblr.com/post/33908494890/from-our-community great article\n\ncheck out this artist’s work:\n\nhttp://www.nsarachek.com/nsarachek_web_site/chemigrams_Norman_Sarachek.html\n\nhttp://www.lloydgodman.net/tech/tech/Photograms/photograms8.html let’s look at this link!\n\nhttp://www.alternativephotography.com/wp/processes/chemigrams/the-chemigram\n\nhttp://www.pierrecordier.com/en/travaux.html\n\nhttp://mrngcsephotography.weebly.com/chemigrams.html\n\nhttp://faculty.cooper.edu/willia/handouts/1574733.pdf\n\nhttp://naomijoycelynnkiasmith.blogspot.com/2013/05/chemigrams.html\n\nSee these directions below from lomography.com\n\n|\n\nAnother starting point of the photography course I teach is getting students to understand the difference between positive and negative images and a basic introduction to chemicals, and to do this we create chemigrams. This is a way of capturing positive or negative images straight onto light sensitive paper by using various objects.\n\nWhat you need:\n\nLight sensitive paper\n\nThree trays\n\nDeveloper, Stop and Fixer chemicals.\n\nNo darkroom needed\n\nPaper towels / kitchen towels would be handy.\n\nSetting up\n\nAs you’re not making an actual replica of a picture it doesn’t matter if your paper gets exposed to light, just be sure not to exposure the whole box. You will need three trays, one for each chemical. Set them up as recommended by the brand for paper development, not film. For ease of reference, label each tray. Okay, you’re ready to go!\n\nHow to create positive images\n\nSelect your chosen object; usually more absorbent objects work best such as flowers, leaves and plants. You can also create hand prints if you’re sure to wash your hand extremely well straight after. Dip your object into the developer. This is just a dip, shake off any excess liquid. Carefully place onto your light sensitive paper cover with a paper towel. Evenly press down and hold for 40-60 seconds.\n\nRemove, and magic! A black detailed print of your chosen object! Now to keep it there place the paper into the stop for 30 seconds then remove and place into the fixer for 5-10 minutes with regular agitation. Wash off in another clean water tray of a sink for 5 minutes to rid it of any chemicals. Complete!\n\nHow to create negative images\n\nThe process is the same as above only the order of the chemicals changes. This time you want to fix your chosen object so it remains white. Dip your object into the fixer first and repeat as above. Place into the developer to give you the black background. This takes roughly 2 minutes or until you are happy with the darkness. Continue to stop and fix then wash as above! Compete!\n\nOnce you have mastered this and you’re ready to move onto the next level, Google chemigrams and check out the chemigram paintings. By using different dilutions it is possibly to actually paint an image. This is a great way to get some fantastic prints for beginners and experts alike.\n\nPhotograms Follow these directions!\n\nPhotograms\n\nThere are lots of different techniques you can use to make these with natural light-flashes of light-enlarger light–and other forms of artificial light (flashes–BRING MINI FLASH YOU CAN FIRE OFF CAMERA–they even make flashes you can insert gels into for use on color paper). You can do them in b/w or color-there are some really cool effects you can do with color filters and gels. You can work from digital negatives and contact them adding other objects on top also cliche verre glass negatives you’ve created and added more objects on top or during the exposure. You can move the objects during the exposure. You can work flat or create a set put your paper behind and flash light from front instead of above. You can have your objects at different heights by building up on stilts off the surface.\n\nUsing translucent objects-line drawings-water (one of my favorite mediums for photograms)-things with patterns or geometry–natural botanicals or artificial ones (look at Michaels in the floral section)–especially ferns and serrated lace type objects–look at some patterning on chiffon scarves and other textiles–think also of food like lemon or cucumber slices that have a pattern when you slice them–or some lovely herbs.. Also don’t forget you can use text in combination also just put it onto acetate if you want it to appear black or make letters opaque if you want them to appear white. You can tone or paint your photographs afterwards–or embellish them however you want. I like to drip colored wax on mine and sometimes work that out with tools to create a more textured surface.\n\nUsing translucent objects-line drawings-water (one of my favorite mediums for photograms)-things with patterns or geometry–natural botanicals or artificial ones (look at Michaels in the floral section)–especially ferns and serrated lace type objects–look at some patterning on chiffon scarves and other textiles–think also of food like lemon or cucumber slices that have a pattern when you slice them–or some lovely herbs.. Also don’t forget you can use text in combination also just put it onto acetate if you want it to appear black or make letters opaque if you want them to appear white. You can tone or paint your photographs afterwards–or embellish them however you want. I like to drip colored wax on mine and sometimes work that out with tools to create a more textured surface.\n\nFlying bees and butterflies in jars—that little goldfish in his bowl–swimming babies in pools illuminated below with light on plexisupport–snake slithering in water–look at the work of Adam Fuss-quite wonderful. Etched crystal-marbles-beads-chains-water balloons rolling around (we’ll do this one!)-stencils-try to think of the innate symbolism of what you are using–think glass slipper!\n\nConsider the words of Adam Fuss: “The aesthetic of me not being there.. One doesn’t have complete controle over the individual picture in the way one steps back. The force that makes the picture, the actual construction of the picture is not made by the hand it is made by the law of nature, the form that the nature takes. But one creates the situation that allows to take place. So there is a great degree of taken the helm. But there is also a situation where it is beyond, it is like another world. So there is no way you can do that. I like the aesthetic of me not being there, of the being no helm, of the looking like that there is no one there…”\n\nTry to vary the density of the objects you choose–be wary of the tonal values they will impart and how you can adjust the exposure–or simply move them during exposure to change their appearance. Each photogram is a one of kind gesture-and brings you back to the fun and mystery of what photography is really all about. We as photographers try to exert so much control over our subjects and scene and technique–it’s very liberating to just let it all go and embrace what happens.\n\nCheck out these photograms!\n\nI love Michael Mendez’s photogram book on Blurb! http://www.blurb.com/books/1277216-photograms\n\nhttp://betterphotography.in/features/camera-problem-2/13628/\n\nhttp://sjpritty.blogspot.com/2013/11/three-photographers-who-make-photograms.html\n\nhttp://www.chisholmphotography.co.uk/index.php?/2013/candid-arts-2013-photograms/\n\nSALT PRINT PROCESS-FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS!\n\nSALT PRINTS with digital negatives or objects (VERY SIMILAR TO CYANOTYPE PROCESS)\n\nWatch this video!\n\nMATERIALS NEEDED:\n\n-SALT PRINT CHEMICALS–LAB HAS KIT or MIXES THEM from FORMULA\n\n-Digital Negative (see cyanotype post for instructions on this!) or objects to be placed\n\n-2 Fine Bristle Hake Brushes (all wooden)\n\n-Tray based on size paper or material\n\n-Watercolor paper or handmade paper or untreated material\n\n-clips and board with plexi non uv or glass\n\n-Quartz work light\n\n-transparency film to make digital negative (see video it reviews it again!!)\n\n-Gloves neoprene or chemical resistant\n\n———————————————————————————————\n\nCOATING EMULSION:\n\nBefore you apply solution–to coat the emulsion –tape with drafting tape your paper to workboard so it doesn’t shift.\n\n-2 solutions: salt solution in gelatin based form and silver nitrate–the combination of these will result in a high quality light sensitive emulsion.\n\nCOATING PAPER\n\n-warm up gelatin salt solution in container by soaking small amount of it in another container of hot water till it begins liquid. Then using one of the brushes apply a thin even coat of it onto the watercolor paper. Apply one coat horizontally and then another coat vertically in ensure uniformity. Let it dry completely or speed it up with hair dryer on low heat before preceding. The next step must be done in a DARKENED ROOM because after the silver nitrate is applied it is light sensitive! Low wattage tungsten light is ok at a good distance away from working area. Avoid UV light at all costs!!\n\nSilver nitrate is dangerous follow lab and safety procedures–listen to lab tech!! Wear your gloves silver nitrate can cause skin burns and brown stains! It’s best to pour the silver nitrate into a small vial to have more control prior to applying it. Pour a small quantity onto the paper and brush it in one direction-pour some more and then brush in other direction. Make sure your application is even–don’t go near your working light but you could tilt it in the direction of the light just to make sure you can see that you’re coating paper evenly. Once you’re done coating it-allow it to dry or dry with hair dryer low setting to speed up process. Once it’s dry you can make the contact print. If not making print right away you could store it in light tight container for later use. Making sure it’s bone dry then place your negative or object as you did with the cyanotype with clips or directly with objects as in photogram (or photogenic drawings as Talbot called them).\n\nEXPOSURE\n\nExpose print to UV light–an inexpensive quartz work light would be fine and gives more control than sun. Light should be about 2 ft away could be set up on easel as long as clamped or with objects light needs to be overhead. Exposure ranges from 7-10 minutes depending on the density of your negative. Expose till dark tones are deep shade of brown-but not too much so–print will lighten up quite a bit during processing phase.\n\nPROCESSING & WASHING-DRYING PHASE\n\nAfter it’s been exposed -darken the room- then remove paper from clamps–and place it into tray of cold water-agitate for a couple minutes and then dump water out and refill it again with fresh cold water and soak it again for another couple minutes. This process removes unexposed silver salts from print. Next step is to FIX THE PRINT IN NON HARDENING FIXER! (supplied with kit) Fix it for 10 minutes-(agitate a bit)-this will make the print lightsafe—Wash the print in running water (no more than 70 degrees) in a tray for 30 minutes to remove fixer from print. Allow print to air dry on rack. Inherent Flaws and the texture of the paper are the charm!\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nBostick Sullivan Premixed kit instructions:\n\nSalted Paper Printing Instructions\n\nYour kit contains:\n\n100 ml Salted Paper Sensitizer\n\n100 ml 12% Silver Nitrate Solution\n\n250 g Sodium Thiosulfate Fixer\n\n25ml 2% Potassium Dichromate Solution\n\nThank you for purchasing this Salted Paper Printing kit by Bostick & Sullivan. It will make approximately fifty 8″x10″ prints and produces a unique eggplant (aubergine) colored image. The image is traditionally toned in platinum, palladium or gold for added archival quality.\n\nPlease read and understand these instructions completely before beginning, and make sure to observe standard laboratory safety precautions when handling chemicals.\n\n1.) Safety and Handling Information\n\nThe solutions in your kit are not light sensitive and can be handled under most room lighting conditions. A safelight is not necessary and normal incandescent lighting may be used during the entire process of making Salted Paper prints. Work in a windowless room, or shade any windows in your workspace.\n\nAlways wear plastic or latex rubber gloves while handling Salted Paper and Silver Nitrate solutions, and while coating the paper and processing the exposed images. We always recommend the use of protective goggles, glasses or other eye wear while working with photographic solutions. All photo solutions should be considered poisonous. Do not store them in a refrigerator used to store food or drinks. The solutions are stable at room temperature and will have a shelf life of at least 5 years from the date of purchase.\n\n2) Preparing Your Workspace and Negative\n\nYou will need a negative the same size as your final image, and it must be printed in direct contact with the coated paper under intense UV light. A 1000 watt metal halide bulb, ultraviolet fluorescent lights or sunlight can be used to expose the image.\n\nYou will need a split-back contact printing frame, vacuum frame or two sheets of plate glass to maintain proper registration and pressure between the negative and paper. For the purposes of these instructions, it is assumed the artist is using a split-back contact printing frame, which allows for inspection of the image during exposure .\n\nSelect a large table with a hard, smooth surface to coat your paper. The 12% Silver Nitrate Solution will stain wood, metal and many plastic surfaces. Place several sheets of newspaper or blotter paper on top of the table to catch any extra solution.\n\nIf you are coating with a brush you should only use it for Salted Paper printing. Avoid using a brush that has been used to coat other alternative process chemistry to limit contamination. A glass coating rod can be used for multiple handcrafted processes if you wash it properly between uses.\n\nYou will need 2 trays for processing the exposed image. Fill the first tray with slowly running tap water for your first and last wash. In the second tray prepare a fixer bath by measuring 50 grams (approximately 4 heaping teaspoons) of fixer crystals per liter of cold tap water.\n\nSelect a 100% cotton rag, unbuffered, archival quality paper to print on. We recommend using hot pressed papers\n\nwith a minimum 50lb rating for larger images. Heavier papers will withstand wet processing better, and the hot pressed surface will produce a denser, sharper image with smoother transitions. Begin your printing with a paper that has a proven record and has been recommended for alternative processes, then experiment with other papers as you gain experience.\n\n3) Coating and Drying\n\nTake a piece of paper and tape the upper corners to your coating table using paper tape or masking tape. Place your negative on the uncoated paper and mark the four corners of the negative on the paper using a pencil. This will mark the area that needs to be coated and help you concentrate the solution inside the image area.\n\nShake both solutions well, then using the supplied droppers, count out equal amounts of both the Salted Paper Sensitizer and 12% Silver Nitrate solution into two separate small glass or plastic cups. Shot glasses as well as small plastic cups commonly used for condiments in restaurants both work well.\n\nApproximate drops of each solution needed for various image sizes. Some papers will require more, some less:\n\n4″x5″ image = 12 5″x7″ image = 18\n\n6″x9″ image = 24\n\n8″x10″ image = 40\n\n3a) Using a brush\n\nWet your brush with distilled water, and then generously blot it on a paper towel to remove any excess water. This prepares the brush for coating and helps prevent the solutions from “wicking” up the bristles and keeps it on the surface of the paper.\n\nTake the measured Salted Paper Printing solution and quickly pour the entire amount onto the center of your image area. Using very light pressure, immediately begin spreading the solution back and forth in a horizontal pattern until you have covered the image area. Switch to a vertical stroke and continue spreading the solution. Switch back and forth between vertical and horizontal strokes until the solution has absorbed into the paper. If you are still spreading solution after 30 seconds, reduce the amount of coating solution by 1/4. If you have trouble seeing the coating solution as you spread it on the paper, place a small desk lamp or light next to your coating station and aim it horizontally over your paper.\n\nUsing the pencil marks you made earlier as a guide, make sure you coat an area large enough to completely cover your negative. Your edges are never going to be perfect, so coat a little larger than necessary, then position the negative in the middle. After you have finished coating the paper with the Salted Paper Sensitizer, let it sit until completely dry. After the wet paper has set for 2-3 minutes you can use a hair dryer set to LOW to help dry the solution more quickly.\n\nWash your brush thoroughly using warm water, then rinse it with distilled or deionized water before coating the 12% Silver Nitrate Solution.\n\nAfter the paper has completely dried, apply the 12% Silver Nitrate Solution over the 1st coating of Salted Paper Sensitizer. Allow the paper to air dry or use a warm hair dryer to speed drying, then proceed to step 4.\n\n3b) Using a coating rod\n\nTake the measured Salted Paper Sensitizer and pour the entire amount along one edge of your paper, just outside of the image area. Place the coating rod in the middle of the solution and wiggle it a few degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise. The capillary action will draw the solution evenly along the entire length of the coating rod.\n\nWhile applying very light pressure, gently pull the coating rod across the image area. When you reach the edge of the image area, lift the rod, skip over the bead of solution, then drag the solution across the paper in the opposite direction. If you are able to make more than 6 passes back and forth, reduce the amount of coating solution by 1/4.\n\nIf a line of solution remains on the paper after 10 passes, gently blot the excess solution with the corner of a paper towel to remove it. Let the paper dry completely, or use a warm hair dryer on LOW after the solution has set for 2-3 minutes.\n\nWash the coating rod, then dry it completely.\n\nApply the 12% Silver Nitrate solution over the coat of Salted Paper Sensitizer. Allow the paper to air dry or use a warm hair dryer to speed drying. Proceed to step 4.\n\n4) Exposure\n\nThe Salted Paper image darkens and develops as it is exposed, producing a “printing out” image, eliminating the need for a separate development stage. Using a traditional split-back contact printing frame allows the artist to inspect the image during exposure without disturbing the registration between the negative and paper. This is especially useful when using natural sunlight which is variable and unpredictable, and exposure times can vary greatly.\n\nPlace your negative inside the print frame and center it on the glass. Make sure the image is not reversed when viewed through the glass, or your final image will be reversed. Carefully place your dried Salted Paper face down in the frame, covering the negative. Install the felt-lined hinged back and lock the springs in place.\n\nPlace the frame under your UV light source or in direct sunlight to begin exposing. You will see the emulsion-coated area outside of the negative begin to darken almost immediately. Judging the proper time to remove the print from the light is the most important part of the entire Salted Paper process.\n\nAfter approximately 3 minutes of exposing, remove the print from the light and inspect. If using the sun for exposure we recommend inspecting indoors to minimize UV exposure and fogging. Carefully open one leaf spring on the hinged back. Fold that half of the frame open to expose the backside of the print. Gently lift the paper by an edge and fold it back to reveal the image.\n\nSalted Paper prints will darken considerably during washing, fixing, optional toning bath and drying stages, so you will need to stop exposure when it appears approximately 1/2 – 2/3 as dark as the desired final image.\n\nAfter an initial 3 minutes, the image will have darkened considerably, but it is likely that it will need more exposure. Close the frame and lock the leaf spring into place, then place the frame under your light source again. Repeat the inspection process every few minutes until the image has darkened sufficiently to begin showing details in the highlights.\n\nIf your images appear flat and lack sufficient contrast, try adding 1 drop of 2% Potassium Dichromate to the coating solution of Salted Paper Sensitizer before applying it to the paper.\n\n5) Washing\n\nTake the exposed image from the print frame and place it in the tray of wash water. Agitate the tray every 20-30 seconds. You will see the unexposed Silver Nitrate and Salted Paper Sensitizer floating off of the print as a white, milky cloud. Wash the print for 5-7 minutes, or longer if the white precipitate continues to float off the paper. Using warm water (90 degrees F) in the wash will shorten wash times considerably.\n\n6) Fixing\n\nRemove your print from the wash tray and transfer it to the second tray with the fixer solution. Agitate the tray periodically, and watch as the image darkens. Continue agitation for 4-5 minutes. Remove the image from the fixer, and it should be approximately 3/4 as dark as your final desired image. In the final drying stage the image will darken and the color will richen even further. Over-fixing can lead to bleaching of the image, while under fixing will cause archival permanence issues.\n\n7) Final Wash and Drying\n\nMove the print from the fixer tray to the wash tray. Set the water flow so a slow, constant stream of water is running. Wash the print for 20-30 minutes, agitating the tray once every 5 minutes.\n\nAfter washing for 20-30 minutes, gently lift the print from the tray by a corner and allow the water to drain off of the paper for 15 seconds. Hang the print from a clothes line or place on a plastic window screen to air dry. Alternatively, you can dry the print on several paper towels laid on a table, making sure to keep the print from sticking to the towels as it dries. We recommend flattening your dried prints in a warm dry mount press, then mounting and matting them on archival, acid-free board. If the print is to be toned in gold or platinum, you can proceed directly to the toning process after the final wash without drying.\n\nCYANOTYPE PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS–FOLLOW THESE!\n\nCYANOTYPES\n\nI want you to watch this video it covers exactly how you can make the digital negative quickly and easily and some tips for making cyanotype. You will get a monochromatic blue tone image-different values–Iron based print similar to salt prints which have brown hue and that is silver based.\n\nReview: About the Digital Negative\n\n-Scan negative or digital image–Choose high resolution image with good contrast and value. Cyanotypes do not render great midtones but are contrasty in nature–When you bring image into Photoshop convert it to grayscale, (under mode), then invert image (image-adjustments-invert) then flip it (select all-edit-transform-flip horizontally) so it will be proper orientation.\n\n-Make sure you create a negative that is dense (dark enough) and contrasty. This can be a challenge. You need to make it denser than you think you need to! What looks good on the screen won’t look good on the transparency printout! Best way to do this is to increase contrast and lower brightness so you have nice dense negative. Simple method –Do this,( image-adjustments-brightness/contrast and adjust sliders accordingly) OR better yet, use shadow/highlight adjustment and adjust accordingly. Once you get it looking good–print it out on high quality setting onto transparency film at the size of your purchased film. Have your negative size match your paper size or you can combine smaller negatives if collaging.\n\nhttps://mpaulphotography.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/cyanotype-digital-negatives-a-basic-how-to/ this is another how to on making digital negative a bit more advanced. https://mpaulphotography.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/cyanotype-basic-process-tutorial/ a good overall tutorial\n\nReview: About coating and exposing the paper-trouble-shooting!\n\n-You are using Photographer’s Forumulary Cyanotype kit they have powder and liquid-it will be mixed for you and you don’t need a lot to coat your paper-this is what is being mixed:\n\nMixing chemicals\n\nhttp://stores.photoformulary.com/content/07-0090.pdf this is the directions Peter has for kits there\n\nThe cyanotype is made up of two simple solutions. You must use DISTILLED WATER for best results.\n\nPotassium ferricyanide and Ferric ammonium citrate (green) are mixed with water separately into dark brown bottles and they are uv sensitive when mixed.\n\nThe two solutions are then blended together in equal parts. You have 3rd container that gets equal parts of both solutions. Once mixed into working solution they must be used right away-separate mixed solutions A and B once mixed up don’t keep long either but put them in dark storage bottles if you’re attempting it.\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\n-Digital Negative made according to directions above and reviewed in the video\n\n-drafting tape to secure you paper to clamping board\n\n-Watercolor paper or handmade paper hot pressed 140 lb or heavier–the plexi they have with clamps only accomodates 11×14 under uv light–but if using the sun to expose you could go larger but you will need to get non uv plexi glass and clamps\n\n-tray large enough to hold your paper to rinse with water\n\nPreparing the canvas\n\nYou can apply the solution with a foam brush for more even coverage or a brush for more streaky coverage. Coat both directions horizontal first and then vertical.\n\nUse rubber gloves and an apron or an old shirt to work in. If you have the space, choose an area where you can spread out. Ordinary light bulbs or tungsten light is safe to use, but UV light will affect your prints. Some fluorescent lighting may also affect your prints–it’s best to work in subdued dim dark incandescent area.\n\nPaper, card, textiles handmade papers or any other naturally absorbent porous material is coated with the solution and dried in the dark or dried with blow dryer in the dark to faciliate faster drying time.\n\nPrinting the cyanotype\n\nObjects or negatives are placed on the material to make a print via contact printing method in LOW LIGHT and then placed into light source–otherwise you could fog paper paper and lose contrast and highlights. A digital negative will be sandwiched between glass or non uv plexglass any actual object could go on sheet of glass and then placed on exposed material or directly in contact with it. The cyanotype is printed using UV light, such as the sun, a light box or a UV lamp. If doing them at lab you will us UV light if working larger you can do them on your own with sun–coat them there and bring them home (you must expose them within 1 day) in a dark lightproof transport. -Do not need enlarger or darkroom–you will expose with sun or uv light\n\nPaper usually turns to white or washed out blue when it’s often ready to be taken apart and washed.\n\nAre you using the negative correctly? (i.e. facing the paper on the correct side – for digital, ink-to-emulsion works best.) Side that ink printed on should go against emulsion! Remember, cyanotype is part of the paper and the paper “tooth” becomes part of the image. If the paper is particularly rough, try sizing it before you coat with emulsion for a clearer image. You can size it with soak in vinegar but remember it needs to be completely dry before you coat it with cyanotype solution.\n\nExposure times can vary from a few minutes to several hours, depending on how strong your lightsource is or the season where you are printing. It is best to do a test print to avoid guessing. Some people like to rush oxidation and put it in a diluted bath of hydrogen peroxide to intensify the blues–a capful per 32 oz of water.\n\nProcessing and drying\n\nAfter exposure the material is processed by simply rinsing it in COLD water-agitate it by rocking it back and forth. This removes any unexposed chemicals from print. Be careful when picking up the prints: a wet cyanotype will smear emulsion if you touch it. A white print emerges on a blue background. When the print has been exposed, process your print by just rinsing it in cold water. The wash also removes any unexposed chemicals. Wash for at least 5 minutes, until all chemicals are removed and the water runs clear. Oxidation is also hastened this way – bringing out the blue color. The final print can now be hung to dry or placed on drying screen and air dried. If you plan to tone your prints, let them age/harden for at least 24 hours before you tone.\n\nTROUBLE-SHOOTING CYANOTYPES:\n\n-You should bring in some foam brushes or Japanese hake or pastry brushes to apply emulsion to your material–don’t use brushes with metal on them it can interfere with chemicals. Do not use stretched canvas that has gesso treated on it–but untreated canvas or 100% cotton or linen no synthetics for material can work. Paper see–list of recommendation for watercolor or Japanese rice paper or inlaid handmade flower papers–or other textures. Think about how minimal or complex the image is in comparison to your selected base. Untreated Porous surface works best.\n\n-If using material it must be 100% cotton or linen or canvas without any prior gesso or treatment.\n\n-Try to use hot pressed watercolor paper rather than cold.\n\n-If print is too dark expose for less time if print is too light expose for more time. If print washes away you left it in water too long -or didn’t use distilled water.\n\nTroubleshooting issues\n\nMy entire print washed off in the developer, what did I do wrong? You didn’t expose long enough for the image to fix. Try a few test strips with stepped increments to find the best printing time. Don’t be surprised if your printing time is long for a really dense negative.\n\nMy image has far too much contrast: You need to adjust your negative. For ortho film, use filters when printing (it’s been a while, I think you make a super low contrast negative.) For film negs, try vinegar. Lots of vinegar. For digital negatives, read this blog post.\n\nMy coated paper is dark green/blue/anything but light green when I go to print: dark green usually means contaminated chemicals. Blue means it got wet – high humidity will do this, or bagging before the print is fully dry. Best case, recoat and try again. Worst case, you need to remix your chemicals and be super careful to avoid contamination.\n\nWhy does my print look washed out? Different papers will produce different color tones of blue. Try Canson Montval – avoid cheap art papers because they will have more chemicals in them that interact with your emulsion. Also try double coating for deeper shadows. As in all photography, if your negative isn’t perfect, your print won’t be either. Make sure your contrast on the negative is perfect.\n\nMy image is blurry! Is your negative completely squashed against the paper? Did it move during printing? Are you using the negative correctly? (i.e. facing the paper on the correct side – for digital, ink-to-emulsion works best.) Remember, cyanotype is part of the paper and the paper “tooth” becomes part of the image. If the paper is particularly rough, try sizing it before you coat with emulsion for a clearer image.\n\nMy print stained. What went wrong? Proper washing is key. Sometimes your rinse water will react to the emulsion – if this is the case, let it sit in a filtered water bath for a while longer. Make sure you never reuse your developer – always prepare fresh water/vinegar for each print or risk a blue stain.\n\nAck! My negative is dusty/shows fingerprints! I usually wear light cotton gloves when working with my digital negatives. If I notice a problem, usually the gloves will clean the negative without damaging it. Dust/fur/brush bristles in the emulsion are far more a problem for me – duplicate prints are a good idea, especially if you plan to tone.\n\nMy cyanotype print faded after a few months. Cyanotypes like a slightly acidic environment, and sun will fade the print. Shove the print into a book for a few days and let it sit: it should come back to its normal color.\n\nI hate the flatness of my prints. Is there anything I can do to make them shiny? Yes! Try brushing a half-and-half diluted solution of acrylic gloss medium on a finished print. This works really well with toned images, bringing out the shadow depth. If you’re using a single coat of emulsion, try adding a tiny bit of gloss to the emulsion before you coat. Mix well, or you’ll get streaks – you may have uneven toning issues with this method as well.\n\nWhy can’t I just mix up the entire solution instead of mucking around with solutions A and B? Because it’s light sensitive and it starts to degrade about a day after you mix it. Best to keep them separate – they last for years. Just remember to lightly swish the solutions before you start pouring – some chemicals settle to the bottom.\n\nHistory and artist inspiration about the cyanotype process\n\nSee this gallery on alternativephotography.com for cyanotype artists for inspiration.\n\nhttp://www.alternativephotography.com/wp/category/gallery-by-process/cyanotype-photographers\n\nsome good example here: http://photoeidolon.wordpress.com/\n\nThe cyanotype, also known as a blueprint, is considered among the easiest of all the historical methods. Dating from 1842, this classic Prussian blue process is a great place for both beginners and accomplished artists alike to explore. Cyanotypes are economical, permanent, have few pitfalls, and are versatile in that a variety of toning effects are possible.\n\nSome background History on the Cyanotype Process:\n\n-1842 Sir John Herschel (1792-1871) Inventor of cyanotype process in 1842 precurser of modern blueprint process, discovery of permanent way of fix images to be seen in white light, sodium thiosulfate fixer as solvent of silver halides in 1820, after trying it in 1839, told Daguerre and Talbot about it. English mathematician, astonomer, chemist, and photographer/inventor. He did most of his photography related work between 1839-1844. He coined the term, photography (light/writing) in 1839, used terms negative/positive, and snap shot. He contributed to color reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of spectrum imparted their color to photo paper, originally discovered platinum process on basis of light sensitivity of platinum salts and later developed by William Willis.\n\nStudy of lace, by Sir John Herschel 1839.\n\n-Anna Atkins (1799-1871)British, Botanist/photographer, first to use photogram illustrations in illustrated self published book, British Algae, Cyanotype Impressions, 1843 with 424 photos issued in parts over 10 years. She learned from Talbot and Herschel (cyanotype), her book preceded Talbot’s 1844 Pencil of Nature. Women were not encouraged at the time to be scientists, however, botany was acceptable field, and she established photography as an accurate medium for scientific illustration. She owned camera, yet, made cameraless direct contact photograms (shadowgraphs as they were known then), Talbot’s photogenic drawing technique.\n\n–\n\nEasy digital negatives for cyanotype\n\nLearning to make really high quality digital negative takes a lot of time to learn and trial and error we are limited for time in this course–so once you become interested in a technique or process after trying it the first time then you can try to perfect it– Dan Burkolder is THE GURU of digital negative making–here is link to his site his book is out of print–but lots of info online and he does have tutorials that are very helpful http://www.danburkholder.com/Pages/main_pages/Digital_Neg_Info/Digital_Negatives.html\n\nYou can download copy of book–or order hard copy –but this is the resource if you find this technique is for you and you want to be able to have greater control over your digital negatives. http://www.king-cart.com/cgi-bin/cart.cgi?store=danburkholder&cart_id=6343.30390&product_name=NEW+Inkjet+Negative+Companion&return_page=&user-id=&password=&exchange=&exact_match=exact\n\nMaterials:\n\n-Pictorico TPU-100 Premium OHP Transparency Film for Inkjet (8.5 x 11″, Letter, 20 Sheets) http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/544997-REG/Pictorico_PICT35009_TPU_100_Premium_OHP_Transparency.html\n\nIt come larger too more expensive and remember that the uv light at school can only accomodate 11×14–I suggest you all buy a package and share it to reduce the costs. See this link at b/h photo for more sizes: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=pictorico&N=0&InitialSearch=yes&sts=ma&Top+Nav-Search=\n\nSome suggestions for watercolor papers for cyanotype–go cheaper so you can experiment more–\n\nhttp://www.alternativephotography.com/wp/paper/tests-in-blue-papers-for-cyanotypes\n\nwatch this video to understand difference between cold press and hot press watercolor–strokes and application of emulsion appear differently on them depending on what you’re trying to achieve in terms of texture and coverage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLddZ7rcx4c#t=194\n\nI would recommend starting out with Arches hot press watercolor paper and 140 g\n\nCold press watercolor paper has texture. Little bumps and grooves holds in the water and pigment. It really sucks up the water pretty quickly. Cold press is a good choice when you want to convey texture in your subject.\n\nHot press is super smooth. No texture with this paper. This paper doesn’t suck up the water as fast as the cold press, allowing you to play around more, like re-wetting edges of pigment.\n\nMight be nicer to suggest texture with handmade papers like Japanese rice papers or the ones that are inlaid with flowers–NY Central Art supply should have good selection–and you could cut them down to size you want. Think perhaps too of creating several images that you could connect to one another in a grid or sequence or pattern.\n\nThis list of papers from alternativephotography.com extremely detailed and helpful too\n\nCyanotype process:\n\nArches and Fabriano papers seem to be favourites amongst many cyanotype artists and Buxton and Hahnemühle are also recommended, but keep sending in your favourites.\n\nWorks:\n\nArches platine, cranes platinotype and buxton work well for any iron processes. (by 2 anonymous contributors).\n\nArches Platine, Arches 90# hot press watercolor, Rives Lightweight (from Edwardo Aites).\n\nArches hot pressed watercolor paper (from Ivy Bigbee and Ken Sinclair).\n\nArches RKB\n\nArches 140 lb. Hot Pressed paper works very well (from Randi DeLisle).\n\nArches Aquarelle\n\nBergger COT-320 (soft graduation), Arches Platine (soft graduation), Fabriano Artistico grain fine and grain satine (hard graduation) (from Kai Hamann).\n\nBFK – Rives (from Wendy Currie).\n\nBuxton; Fabriano 5; Silversafe; Cranes cover and parchment (for the New Cyanotype process).\n\nBuxton paper for cyanotype I process – a wonderful paper to work with, though, sadly, not inexpensive (from Diana Bloomfield).\n\nCanson Sketch: The BACK side of Canson Sketch 120gsm White fine grain paper (from Ole Tjugen).\n\nCanson Moulin du gue CP – rag paper (from Wendy Currie).\n\nClairefontaine – grain 224 g/m2; both sides tested, the rough and the smoother; tested with cyanotype classic solution with solution A stabilized with a few drops of formol. Paper exposed with Ultra-Vitalux bulb at 40 cm for 5 minutes approx – not a perfect solution because the bulb produces an irregular flow of light with an higher level of UV light in the center of the beam; negatives were a polyester transparency negatives for hi-resolution inkjet printers;\n\nProcessing: rinse with cold water and then rinse with white vinegar (1 part of vinegar with 3 parts of water) and finally rinse with water again (from Oliver Wattez).\n\nCranes AS8111\n\nCranes Crest Parchment\n\nFabriano Artistico hot works pretty well (from Barbara Maloney).\n\nFabriano Hot Pressed (from Wendy Currie).\n\nFabriano 5 (from Andrew Parnell).\n\nFabriano 100/100 paper, with Mike Ware’s cyanotype II, it gives the richest toning, other papers tested with less nice results, also Buxton which is excellent but more expensive (from Manfred Raida).\n\nFabriano 100 percent cotton paper, hot press, 140 lb. But cheaper papers often work also – try several (from Karl P. Koenig).\n\nFabrics: Silk – beautiful sheen although a softer cyan with v.pale blue highlights.\n\nRaw silk – deeper blue but softer image due to the texture of the material.\n\nCotton Poplin – thin cotton gives a deeper blue with clean highlights.\n\nTwill – A thicker cotton which gives excellent results. Has a long tonal range from the deepest blue to clean white highlights (from Wendy Currie).\n\nHahnemühle etching paper (from Neal Oshima).\n\nKozo rice paper – made from mulberries. This is a delicate & translucent paper with a good wet strength. Dry thoroughly to ‘rest’ the paper before toning. (from Wendy Currie).\n\nRoyal Watercolour Society 300gCP; Hahnemuehle Photorag inkjet paper; Hahnemuehle Torchon inkjet paper (from Malcolm Raggett).\n\nRives BFK and stonehinge (from Nan Wollman and an anonymous contributor).\n\nStonehenge HP 245gsm (from Wendy Currie).\n\nStrathmore Bristol – Very smooth surface that holds up to wetting well without roughing. Produces full tonal range and quite sharp prints. Somewhat slow printing allows for more control of exposure and more repeatable results (from Randall Ellis).\n\nSt. Armand Canal white – works beautifully and requires no acidification. Somewhat more absorbent than the better-known papers. (from Eben Ostby)\n\nWhatman Watercolour\n\nFor the blue I go for, my favorite is Stonehenge and some Hahnemuehle. A must is to try the cheapest brown paper used to wrap boxes and big enveloppes; not the dark brown , but the orangier brown ones. Can be stunning (from Henk Thijs).\n\nBoth cyanotypes and VanDyke brown prints I make on either Arches bright white 140lb. cold press or white Rives BFK. Both processes work well on these papers. The main difference is the Arches paper has a prominent texture, while the Rives BFK is smooth textured. I find that exposure times are slightly longer when using Arches for VanDyke browns than with Rives BFK. Van Dyke solution is more likely to streak when coating on Rives BFK than with Arches (from Tyler Hewitt).\n\nWatercolour paper (from Jo Mills)\n\nMost every watercolor or printmaking paper I’ve used works. My favorites: Fabriano Artistico 180lb hot pressed & soft press in bright white or traditional white; and hot pressed 300 lb Fabriano or Arches. I’ve used 100% rag printmaking papers and watercolor papers with excellent results. Not only that, the cyanotype images are still fresh 25 years later. (from Rebecca Bushner).\n\nBoth cyanotypes and VanDyke brown prints I make on either Arches bright white 140lb. cold press or white Rives BFK. Both processes work well on these papers.

I find that exposure times are slightly longer when using Arches for VanDyke browns than with Rives BFK. Van Dyke solution is more likely to streak when coating on Rives BFK than with Arches (from Tyler Hewitt).\n\nDoesn’t work:\n\nCanson Sketch: The FRONT side of Canson Sketch 120gsm White fine grai. paper (from Ole Tjugen).\n\nFabric that doesn’t work is synthetics (from Wendy Currie).\n\nPapers buffered with chalk (calcium carbonate). Avoid chalk-buffered papers for processes using ferrioxalate sensitizers (precipitates calcium oxalate and hydrolyses the iron(III)).\n\nKentmere Classic II (from Malcolm Raggett).\n\nArches cold press (from Ivy Bigbee).\n\nAll water color paper (from Nan Wollman).\n\nAnything under 70lb wrinkles too much when wet, some kozo papers are hard to work with. I try to avoid sized paper (from Rebecca Bushner).\n\nMan-made fabrics like bandages or packing materials (from Jo Mills)\n\nTo create a digital negative:\n\nUsing graphics/photo editing software, create the artwork that you want to cyanotype, sized appropriately for the piece of knitting. The finished will be the same size as the negative.\n\nConvert the image to grayscale.\n\nFlip the graphic from left to right, so that any lettering is now backwards. You do this because when printing, the negative will be placed face down, ie. ink-side down.\n\nInvert colors to make it a negative.\n\nPrint the finished graphic onto inkjet transparency film.\n\nAnother version: Just get some Pictorico Premium Overhead Transparency Film (OHP). Then, open your image in photoshop and, if it’s not already in black and white, then convert it using mode function. Once you have a black and white image and have adjusted the levels, brightness and contrast to your liking, invert (or reverse) the image. Using an inkjet printer, print the reversed image onto the OHP film at whatever size you want the final image to be and you are done. Since this is a contact printing technique whatever size you make the negative will render the same size on the printing surface.\n\nA bit more complex and good directions:\n\nVery good video that will help you out in photoshop with orange color negative that many like.\n\n—Pictorico transparency film is recommended by many practitioners as it has a gelatine and ceramic coating which has superior ink holding properties to standard OHP material, but feel free to experiment with other manufacturers as this isn’t as widely available as it used to be. Look for a good quality overhead transparency film from a respected manufacturer.\n\nSelect the image that you wish to make a negative and go to Image>Adjust>De-saturate. Next you need to turn the image into a negative. Do this by going to Image>Adjust>Invert. To alter contrast go to Image>Adjust>Levels. In levels adjust the Output with the bottom sliders from 0 to 255 to about 20 to 210 (fig 1). This is a starting point and you may find that, after experimentation, other settings suit your images better.\n\nYou could print the negative at this stage but I recommend filling the image with another colour. Rather like the orange mask used in colour film negatives – using your software’s fill command. This allows for a denser negative as the additional colour adds ink.\n\nFrom the Toolbox select the foreground colour icon. The colour picker box will open. In the C.M.Y.K % section change the settings to C=0, M=50, Y=50, K=0 (fig 2). This will produce an orange colour in the Foreground Box similar to the orange cast found in colour negative film. Click OK. Now go to Edit>Fill. Select OK (fig 3). The image will turn completely orange (fig 4). Next go to Edit>Fade Fill. A dialogue box will open. With the Mode setting left at Normal – slide the Opacity slider until it reaches 40% (fig 5). Click OK. You may want to experiment with the percentage but 40% is a good starting point. Save your work.\n\nThe final stage is to flip the negative image horizontally (fig 6) – if you fail to do this your image will appear as if in a mirror.\n\nfig 1\n\nfig 2\n\nfig 3\n\nfig 4\n\nfig 5\n\nfig 6\n\nFinally print, at your printer’s highest resolution onto your OHP transparency. Handle the negative carefully by the edges and hang it up to dry and harden away from dust.\n\nPaper: Whilst practically any paper can be used to make a cyanotype print most photographers favour using a quality acid free watercolour paper of about 300gms in weight. The beauty of the cyanotype process is that you can experiment with differing paper surfaces and tones – try an off-white/cream or ivory paper.\n\nLighting Source: Traditionally the sun was used as the light source but an artificial UV source may prove to be more controllable. I uses a small facial sauna. This ‘mini-sunbed’ has the dual advantage of being a constant source of UV and of having a built in timer. This allows for more accurate and repeatable exposures.\n\nPrinting Frame: A rim-less clip frame, of the sort used to display posters, can be modified for use as a cyanotype printing frame. Cut the backboard of the clip frame in two about half way and tape these two parts back together with heavy-duty tape to form a ‘hinged’ back. The frame can be opened as normal to load your paper and negative, and then clipped back together, using 4 large ‘bull-dog’ clips, to hold the two in register while you make your exposure. To check the progress of the print, simply remove 2 clips from the top half and ‘open’ the hinged back. The remaining clips ensure that the negative and paper stay in register.\n\nMore complicated and using Burkholder’s curves (he wrote a book on how to make digital negatives which is a popular resouce) see directions at this link: http://faculty.cooper.edu/willia/pages/digital_negatives-compilation.html\n\nanother resource: http://masteringphoto.com/how-to-make-a-digital-negative/\n\nfor advanced photoshop users refer to this link for curves to download: http://www.alternativephotography.com/wp/negatives/curve-corner-photoshop-curves\n\nADDING ONTO THE CYANOTYPE**************\n\nOnce I see your results I would like for you to take some of your cyanotype prints a step further and tone them with teas and also add some hand coloring to them or perhaps if you’ve worked on fabric then embellish them (beads-buttons) or sew them–quilt them.

It consists of an extremely thin layer of gelatin coated on chemically-cleaned glass. Liquid Light bonds to this thin layer, fusing with the glass so that the image seems to be virtually embedded in the glass or ceramic surface. Is it worth the extra effort?\n\nSubbing is more time-consuming than using glossy varnish. However, the materials for the process are easily available at grocery stores, and the extra effort pays off with the enhanced appearance of the print.\n\nWhat materials should be “subbed”? The process is only for vitreous materials like glass, glazed\n\nceramics, fired porcelain, natural rocks, marble, etc. On glass-resembling plastics like Lucite and\n\nPlexiglas, as well as on highly-porous materials like unglazed ceramics and plaster, do not use subbing;use glossy polyurethane varnish, following the instructions enclosed with Liquid Light.\n\nMaterials needed:\n\nYou will need some unflavored gelatin such as Knox, sold at grocery stores, plus some powdered\n\nlaundry detergent (do not use soap or dishwasher detergent, which leave a waxy film). Sprinkle one level teaspoon (approx. 3 grams) of gelatin onto the surface of one pint (450 cc’s) of cold water in a saucepan. Let it stand 15 minutes to swell the gelatin, then heat with stirring until the gelatin is dissolved (140º-160º F or 45º-56º C.)\n\nProcedure:\n\nScrub and rinse the glass or ceramic (wearing rubber gloves) until the rinse water does not bead up as it drains off the glass but leaves a uniform, nearly- invisible film. Pour some of the hot gelatin mixture onto the material, drain well and dry overnight in a warm place with low humidity and circulating air. (The remainder of the gelatin-water solution can be discarded.)\n\nCoating with emulsion:\n\nThe glass is now “subbed” and can be coated with emulsion. Pour a surplus of Liquid Light on the glass, tilt to spread, and pour the surplus back in the bottle. Set the glass or ceramic on a level surface with cool circulating air to speed setting and drying. The glass can be exposed while the Liquid Light is still damp or dried thoroughly and saved for future use\n\nIf using pre bought stretched canvas that has been primed with water-base gesso, it should be given a topcoat of alkyd primer or glossy polyurethane\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-landry/post_6747_b_4670041.html David Prifti\n\nLIQUID LIGHT PROCESS DIRECTIONS:\n\nThe process where you can apply the process to a surface of your own choice.\n\nExplained by Lloyd Godman\n\nThis is a silver-based sensitizer for applying on any surface, exposing by an enlarger, and processing in conventional chemistry. It is virtually the same emulsion found on ordinary photographic paper, but in a liquid form and can allow the emulsion to be coated on a wide range of surfaces.\n\nSpeed and Contrast When freshly-made, liquid light is relatively slow and lacks full contrast. As it ages, it becomes faster and more contrasty. You can obtain maximum speed and contrast at any stages by adding a small quantity of working developer to the emulsion, as described below.\n\nThe emulsion can leave black stains on working surfaces and needs to cleaned up immediately.\n\n1Safe Light\n\nUse a dark yellow, light amber or red safelight while coating but when emulsion is drying and for storage total darkness is recommended.\n\nAt room temperature, liquid light is a solid gel and before use the bottle must be soaked in a container of hot water until it becomes a liquid at about 110 Deg F. It is not necessary to melt the entire contents if only a portion is to be used as the mixture is of a similar consistency throughout and in fact shaking the bottle will cause bubbles to form which can effect the application of the emulsion. Use containers and tools made only from plastic, rubber, enamel, stainless steel or glass. (Other metals such as plain steel or brass may contaminate the emulsion. Temperature and humidity in the darkroom should be moderate.\n\n2Increasing density and sensitivity\n\nA small, precisely-measured amount of paper developer added to liquid light just before use will give maximum speed and contrast. Add exactly one part of working developer to 10 parts of liquid light. Example: Add 15ml of dektol, Neutol or equivalent diluted 1-2 (Not stock or concentrated solution) to 150ml of liquid light. Mix well, an coat this mixture during the same day. (Once coated and dried, material can be stored of an indefinite period).\n\n3Applying liquid emulsion\n\nUse a brush, small sponge or a nap type paint applicator, by using a paint roller, spray gun, or by flowing on the emulsion and draining off the excess. At the same time, coat a few pieces of paper or file cards with the same mixture to serve as test strips to calculate the correct exposure. Like paint, too thin a coating of liquid light will show streaks and brush stokes. If an even coating is required, two thin coats will cover better than one and the second can be applied after the first has become tacky or dried. As you are applying the solution, remember to keep the emulsion warm in a water bath as it will begin to set again if it becomes cool.\n\n4Exposure\n\nLiquid light can be exposed once it is dry by using an enlarger, contact printing, or by a slide projector. Liquid light is slower than normal enlargement papers and requires a longer exposure time. Suggested exposure for an 8×10 from a 35mm neg enlarged full frame is about 40sec @ f5.6. If using an enlarger for large works, you will need to reduce the amount of light projected on to the surface,and this can be done by tapping a piece of black stiff card over the front lens with a hole 1/8 inch diameter cut in the middle to act as a diaphragm that limits light out put and sharpens the image.\n\n5Processing liquid emulsion – development\n\nFor preparations on paper, develop like a normal print in a tray, or for other surfaces paint the developer on with a brush or sponge. A developer like Dektol or Neutol should be used diluted 1 part with 2 parts water. It is important that while the temperature of the developer is warm it is not above 70 deg F or 21 deg C. to avoid melting of the emulsion. For large surfaces where the developer must be applied to a portion of the print at a time, even out the development by first wetting the emulsion with cool water.\n\n6Fixing\n\nDo not rinse with water or use a stop bath after developing. Use two consecutive identical hardening fixer baths. The first acts as a short stop; immerse for a few seconds to neutralize the developer. Next place in the second bath for 10 min or more until the chalky white pigment disappears, leaving the highlights completely transparent. (The second fixer should always be new and some agitation should be used).\n\n7Washing\n\nWash in the normal manner for at least 10 min in running water.\n\n// SURFACE PREPARATION 1//\n\n*ALL MATERIAL IS TAKEN FROM “SILVER GELATIN: A USER’S GUIDE TO LIQUID PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSIONS” BY MARTIN REED AND SARAH JONES\n\nBEFORE APPLYING EMULSION YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT:\n\nSURFACE IS CLEAN.\n\nSURFACE IS PREPARED [IT MAY NEED SOME TO HELP THE EMULSION TO ADHERE]\n\nTHERE ARE THREE TYPES OF ADHESION:\n\nMECHANICAL [PHYSICAL]\n\nDIFFUSION [IN MOLECULAR LEVEL]\n\nELECTRICAL [AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE CAN BE USED TO OXIDIZE THE SURFACE OF SOME MATERIALS, ENABLING A CHEMICAL BOND TO BE PRODUCED THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE OCCUR]\n\nCLEANING AND DE-GREASING THE SURFACE\n\nA SIMPLE TEST FOR CLEANLINESS FOR METALS AND PLASTICS IS TO APPLY A FILM OF WATER AND CHECK HOW IT ACCEPTED THE SURFACE. IF IT BREAKS INTO BEADS FURTHER PREPARATION IS REQUIRED.\n\nMECHANICAL CLEANING – INCLUDES REMOVAL OF SURFACE DUST AND DEBRIS, AND POSSIBLY THE USE OF A SCOURING AGENT SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD ABRASIVE CLEANER TO LIGHTLY ABRADE THE SURFACE.\n\nDETERGENT – USING DETERGENT AS AN INITIAL PREPARATION IS SIMPLE, NO-HAZARDOUS, AND APPLICABLE TO MOST TYPES OF POTENTIAL BASE MATERIAL\n\nCHEMICAL – A CLEANING SOLUTION CAN BE MADE BY DISSOLVING ABOUT 25G OF SODA HYDROXIDE (CAUSTIC SODA) IN A LITRE OF WATER.\n\nSOLVENTS – SOLVENTS FOR FATS AND OILS CAN BE USEFUL CLEANSING AGENTS, BUT THEY MUST BE USED THOROUGHLY AND SUFFICIENTLY OR THE GREASE CAN ME MERELY REDISTRIBUTED OVER THE SURFACE. ALCOHOL AND ACETONE ARE TWO EXAMPLES.\n\nSUBBING\n\nSUBBING IMPLIES ANY SURFACE PREPARATION TREATMENT PRIOR THE EMULSION COATING, PARTICULARLY FOR SMOOTH-SURFACED MATERIALS. THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SMOOTH SURFACES :\n\nSMOOTH SURFACES TO WHICH EMULSION WILL NOT ADHERE TO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SURFACE PREPARATION – THIS INCLUDES MANY PLASTICS\n\nSMOOTH SURFACES TO WHICH EMULSION WILL ADHERE WELL WHEN DRY, BUT POORLY IN THE WET STATE, INCLUDING GLASS AND GLAZED CERAMICS.\n\nGELATIN SUBBING SOLUTION\n\nTHIS IS A DILUTE SOLUTION OF GELATIN, PREFERABLY HARDENED WITH CHROME ALUM (CAN USE SILVERPRINT SUBBING SOLUTION & EMULSION HARDENER), WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO A BASE THAT IS NORMALLY DIFFICULT TO EMULSION-COAT DIRECTLY, PARTICULARLY GLASS AND "
