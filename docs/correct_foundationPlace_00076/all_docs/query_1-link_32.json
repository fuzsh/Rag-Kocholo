        "text": "Now getting back to the fundal assessments vs. fundal massages.\n\nTheir names are misleading, the fundal assessment is the much more fun option of the bunch.\n\nA fundal check/assessment is a gentle, soft press with a side-of-the-hand tilting in around your belly button. Typically lasting a few seconds while your provider/RN is also peeking between your legs to check for bleeding.\n\nIf a fundal check was a 2/10, a fundal massage is likely closer to an 8/10. The same hand motion occurs with more rubbing involved and with much more pressure. The duration could be 5-10 seconds to minutes.\n\nNow here is where the conversation is about to occur- how do you or your team know which you need?\n\nIf your birth was relatively uncomplicated, your bleeding amount/consistency is considered normal. you don't feel symptoms of anemia and you have no history of bleeding disorders, complications and you are receiving pitocin after birth, the evidence shows that fundal check will probably be the only action necessary.\n\nPeek the evidence here which shows that for moms receiving synthetic oxytocin (pitocin) immediately postpartum, having a fundal massage vs. a fundal check does not reduce the incidence of a postpartum hemorrhage.\n\nJust because the evidence shows a fundal massage should only be done on an as-needed basis, that does not mean your nurses and providers will follow. Maybe it's fear, knowledge-gap, inadequate continuing education or just being stuck in old ways. Whatever the basis of performing routine fundal massages, we want to tell you it may not be necessary and you can speak up.\n\nFundal massages hurt, they are often performed without proper informed consent and can seriously interrupt bonding with baby. Fundal checks are just as comprehensive for your care team in ensuring you are continuing recover in a safe way.\n\nWe don't want you to feel like you need to play defense postpartum, but we do want to give you some scripts of what to say if a fundal massage is being discussed or performed and it's making your uncomfortable:\n\n\"Can we please wait until I am done ___ for you to check me?\"\n\n\"Am I bleeding heavily or having clots?\"\n\n\"Are you concerned about my bleeding or my uterus?\n\n\"Were you planning on lightly touching the top to check or doing a massage?\"\n\n\"Would you mind sitting down briefly so we can discuss what you'd like to check before you get started?\"\n\nWhat else would you add to the list?\n\nNow we know we kind of flew through this. We want every mom to feel prepared for what they are entering into, so we are glad we caught you!\n\nWe dive way deeper into the talk on your fundus and your postpartum recovery in our mega course, Taking Back Your Fourth Trimester."
