        "text": "Michael Wolfe\n\nFrom Michael Wolfe:\n\nI began writing seriously at age 14. I happened upon a biography of Ezra Pound in my hometown library in a Cincinnati suburb, and the story of a poet’s dedication to the written word turned a tumbler in my being; that he got into trouble later, and occasionally wore an ear-ring, increased the mystique.\n\nAt fifteen, I sent some of my poems to John Ciardi, care of the Saturday Review, for which he wrote a column on language. This correspondence landed me at Bread Loaf Writers Conference the following summer. There I met Robert Frost, John Berryman, and Dudley Fitts. Later, Berryman and Fitts directed me toward Wesleyan University, and Richard Wilbur, and helped me enter university despite a lousy performance in high school math. I “studied” poetry with Dick Wilbur for 4 years at Wesleyan; this invaluable experience consisted of visiting his office once a week for an hour and showing him a new poem, if I had one. Rather than major in the literature of my own language, I studied Greek and Latin, French and German. How wise this was I am not sure; it left me badly read in English; I did, however, manage to read Homer, Herodotus, Catullus, Virgil, and Propertius in their own meters. I graduated in 1968.\n\nIn 1969, I applied for an Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship in poetry. I was living in Tangier, Morocco, in 1970 when word arrived that I would receive this grant. It was a Godsend as by that time I was running low on funds. The scholarship was renewed several times, allowing me to travel in North and West Africa for about 3 years.\n\nThis African experience had two lasting effects on my career: first, it induced me upon my return to America to start a small press publishing company, Tombouctou Books, named after the African capital where books were worth their weight in gold. Second, my travels brought me face to face with Islam, a faith and culture about which I had known nothing and which I found very interesting.\n\nI settled in Northern California. There as a very small-time publisher, editing a few books every year (and designing them on a light-board in my kitchen), I came into touch with writers at home and in Africa too. I continued to travel there, when the opportunity arose.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1980, I published three books of poetry and a small travel journal called In Morocco. My writing until this time, save for the travel journal, was all in verse.\n\nGradually, I began to take an interest in writing sentences and paragraphs. This, for me, remains a separate matter from writing poetry_ formally, socially, and psychologically. In the past, it had been quite enough for me to fill the middle portion of a single sheet of paper, when the notion struck me; in formal terms, you could say that the short lyric was really all I cared about. Now I began to consider the entire page, the relation between one paragraph and another, and the notion of story. I also began to write in a daily way, which no lyric poet would ever think of. Indeed, I became transfixed with all this and ceased writing verse for many years.\n\nIn the 1980s, I published a book of fiction, and produced other prose works, some half finished, others finished but failed or just abandoned. Something else was happening in this period, too: I was undergoing an emotional and spiritual transformation. To put it plainly, I had grown fed up with the limits of my own well honed, ironic, skeptical view of life, a view that had served me well in certain ways, but which nonetheless left me feeling too often outside my own experience, more an observer than a participant, less an emotional being than a summation of words and thoughts. In short, I was missing the texture of life, an indefinable quality, for the lack of which people wander off into deserts and don’t come back.\n\nI found myself taking an interest in Islam (of all things) during this time. Now I think I know why, but at the time it was hardly conscious. Rather, I felt like a compass needle turning to the North. In time, I found a fresh direction there, a path to a hidden entrance that seemed to lead me back into the world. Being then more a beggar than a chooser, I followed the instinct, as dogs track a scent. Along the way, I taught myself about Islam, slowly, without asking why. (There was no one to ask. The nearest mosque, had I thought of it, was 100 miles away.)\n\nIn a year or two I began to consider traveling to Mecca, to take part in the annual Muslim pilgrimage. I wrote a friend in Morocco, the author Mohammed Mrabet; Mrabet wrote back, through our mutual friend, his translator Paul Bowles, encouraging me. This all sounds somewhat exotic as I write it, but there was nothing exotic about it, in my mind. I also laid plans to write a book about the journey, for writing had always been my way of defining, internalizing and sharing events. Also, the formal concerns of a Western travel book with spiritual dimensions intrigued me.\n\nIn 1989 I became a Muslim, formally. In 1990, I traveled to Morocco and spent some months there, before going on to Mecca. I went on my own. The experience was transformative.\n\nI spent about three years writing a book about this journey: The Hadj: An American’s Pilgrimage to Mecca, which Atlantic Monthly Press and Morgan Entrekin gamely saw me through, then published in 1993. In 1997, I followed this with another book, from Grove Press, an anthology of Hajj travelers, drawing on authors from around the world who had visited Mecca during the last one thousand years. The title: One Thousand Roads to Mecca. My editor for both these books was Anton Mueller.\n\nAs I’m supposed to be treating literary matters here, I’ll finish by saying that after the publication of these two books, I slowly began to return to the writing of poetry. I look upon this as ground reclaimed after many, long years. Stranger things have happened, but not to me.\n\n“Entering the Third World”\n\nA storefront lit by candles\n\nAnd the dial on a clock.\n\nThe clock’s quit ticking.\n\nTwice now in six nights\n\nCuernevaca’s sea of light\n\nDrowns in total blackout.\n\nThe modern world works all right\n\nBut it’s broken.\n\nLong-legged shadows graze the earth.\n\nFrom browsing weed\n\nIn cold volcanoes,\n\nA mare has reached the gate.\n\nDespite certain regrets\n\nI wouldn’t part with,\n\nWhat waits outside is more,\n\nDark though it may be:\n\nWet streets, real houses,\n\nStars enormous after all,\n\nA planet still unfinished.\n\nLinda camina como la noche.\n\nA saddle stands at the gate\n\nTo mount, to depart with.\n\nPublication History\n\nTaking Back Islam: American Muslims Reclaim their Faith, 120 pages, Rodale Press, 2003.
