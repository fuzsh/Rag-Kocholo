(Not subscription!)\n\nThis is a collaborative Google Sheet which anyone with the link can edit and contribute - let’s keep the discussions/tangents on the forums - please play nice!\n\nThere are currently a dizzying array of options - some all web based. Most of us would prefer to move into something that’s going to be around for a while. So comments to that end would be welcome.\n\nThe intent is for links and a short summary only so people can sift through all the options to find the one that suits them best.\n\nI’ve made a feeble start but something to show the idea…\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nDave,\n\nI understand that some (if not many or most) would never get involved with something where you paid each month, but I just think a program comparison has nothing to do with the how you pay for it.\n\nThe chart could have a subscipt column and YES or NO, but the features to me seem like everyone’s first priority; what will get the job done… the way you pay for it would be secondary.\n\nThat is like not putting something there that was over $300 because most people would never spend that much.\n\nIn this case for example Adobe Muse is right there in every conversation of able to do most anything people who use Freeway can want, but neglect any mention because of the way they structure their pay?\n\njust my 2 cents.\n\nBarry\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nHi Barry,\n\nDave put it best, as there is a divide on those who don’t mind paying never ending fees for something on a subscription plan, vs the desktop one time license.\n\nIf one wanted to open the door to any possible alternatives there are seemingly endless numbers of virtual web design sites to also add to the list - some paid and some not - where one can build a website. Wix, Weebly, SquareSpace and beyond! Most are simpler/less featured though.\n\nMy focus on desktop web publishing software was hoping for apples to apples alternative/comparisons to Freeway. But - Feel free to expand the spreadsheet to add any alternatives you like in new categories or sections - that’s why it’s collaborative!\n\nPersonally, I don’t generate or operate enough websites to justify a monthly bill for occasional use. I’ve stopped buying anything Adobe beyond Photoshop CS6 and Lightroom 6 due their their scheme. I will keep a dedicated machine for those programs (and this machine could also work well with Freeway!) until such time as their replacements come along. Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo and Capture One are filling the gap nicely right now.\n\nYMMV\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nThe million dollar question for me is which one is closest to FW?\n\nFrom what I’ve seen there’s not anything very close. The “block building” ones seems incredibly limited at first glance.\n\nThe familiarity of the whole desktop publishing roots approach was why I liked FW so much as well - even though it got further and further away from that trying to keep up with the changing landscape of mobile web and all.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear where all our peers end up moving to.\n\nWhatever it is - it’s going to be a learning curve - and a gamble that software is around for the long term as well.\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options\n\nIt would be interesting to hear where all our peers end up moving to.\n\nHi Karen,\n\ncertainly I can’t speak for the rest. But in my case, I’ll keep on going with Freeway.\n\nMeanwhile I prepare myself, making it easier being off from one day to the other. The plan has been documented here (if you haven’t seen it already):\n\nBut wherever my web design career will end (or start?), it is not:\n\nI’m a fucking DTP specialist and I need to drag elements around application dependency!####\n\nCheers\n\nThomas\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options\n\nOn 8 Sep 2016, 12:45 am, Karen E wrote:\n\nI’ve added CoffeeCup’s Foundation Framer and altered CoffeeCup’s Responsive Site Designer. It’s amazing what you can do with FF…\n\nThank you - this looks quite interesting but from what I can glean via their website you have to buy the Beta to try it out - or is there a trial period? (A new column has been added to the collaboration by Duncan, to show trial period information)\n\nI found an article lightly explaining the differences between the two and also added it to the sheet - Foundation Framer and Responsive Site... | CoffeeCup Software\n\nYou can chip in and buy the Responsive Foundation Framer beta for less than $60. This also entitles you to a copy of the final release (which will save you a couple of bucks, Responsive Site Designer goes for about $190). This also gives you a coupon for a 20% discount on any next purchase. I’ve cashed it in on the whole Responsive Design Package so for less than $300 I own a licence for every single Mac OS app they offer. But you could settle for just the Responsive Content Slider which is a sure winner.\n\nI’ve created layouts using RSD and RFF within an hour that seemed impossible to do within Freeway.\n\nThe support forum is as helpful as this Freeway forum, and also even the folks from CoffeeCup join the conversations. Their response time is very short.\n\nRichard\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options\n\nI’ve been experimenting with various programs and am leaning towards Pinegrow, so far. It opens all my FW sites (and others) via their html files, and they work and restructure responsively, as intended. They just came out with a new version 2.93 and CMS feature for end-user (client) editing of text and images:\n\nhttp://docs.pinegrow.com/editing/pinegrow-cms-for-static-html-websites\n\n2 things important to me are: being able to open html files properly, so I don’t have to recreate my FW sites, and code editing panes. There are a couple of other items I have on my wish list, as well.\n\nI poked around Flux 6 last night. It also opens html files and allows for code editing, but I don’t care for the interface. I may explore it some more though.\n\nI like Coffee Cup’s RSD interface, but it doesn’t open FW/html files, nor do they expect to offer it. They may add a code editing feature in the future. Have not checked out Foundation Framer yet.\n\nMuse looks interesting and I already use the CC suite, so I have it by default, but it lacks editing capabilities and the ability to open html files.\n\nIn addition to its html mark-up and extend panes, I always wished that Freeway Pro had a code editing side panel option. I think it would have added to its professional credibility. Just sayin’.\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nOn 10 Sep 2016, 12:27 am, Dave Boli wrote:\n\nI just purchased Coffee Cup RSD. I will miss the future with Freeway but I think it’s the way forward. Will still use FW on existing work but will gradually ween off FW and onto RSD. Looks exciting, and GREAT support!!! Already familiar with break points etc after 30 minute tutorial!\n\nI’ve been using RSD for quite awhile now and am very used to it. It was a fairly easy transition for me from Freeway. I bought Foundation Framer in the beta program and I would recommend that you do so as well. As soon as it comes out of beta I will probably switch over to it exclusively due to it being almost identical to RSD in features but with so much more.\n\nThe symbols/components functions alone, make it worth the $59 extra bucks to get it in beta and then get the full version release for free.\n\nRead up on it and check out some of the tutorials & vids out there on it. You’ll see what I mean.\n\nfreewaytalk mailing list\n\nemail@hidden\n\nUpdate your subscriptions at:\n\nhttps://freewaytalk.softpress.com/person/options"
