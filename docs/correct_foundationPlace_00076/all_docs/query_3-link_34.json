        "text": "Located in Pesaro, a mere 10 kilometers from the Adriatic coast of Le Marche, Selvagrossa is a small estate with only five hectares of vineyards. Sangiovese, the area's predominant vine, along with select international varietals which have a history of growing in the area, find a terroir favorable to the production of great wines of character.\n\nBrothers Alberto and Alessandro Taddei inherited the Estate in 2002 from their grandparents, and the first Selvagrossa wine was made that same year from an old-vine Sangiovese vineyard planted in the early 70’s by Alberto and Alessandro’s father and grandfather. During the following years more Sangiovese was planted as well as Merlot and Cabernet Franc in order to exploit the advantages of the Adriatic terroir. The area is marked by cool summer nights with soil rich in clay. The results of these conditions yield wines with great acidity which is especially important for Cabernet Franc.\n\nWhile in oenology school in Tuscany, Alberto had the opportunity to work at the famed, three star Michelin restaurant Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence, an experience that allowed him to taste and appreciate the world's most significant wines and to meet so many influential people and producers from Italy as well as abroad. After earning his enology degree in 1999, Alberto moved to New York as wine buyer and general manager of Falai Restaurant in Manhattan’s lower east side. His brother Alessandro was executive chef in one of Pesaro’s most prestigious restaurants as well as working for one of Pesaro’s better butcher shops. This connection with the wine industry from both the wine buying and culinary sides have given the brothers a wealth of experience and perspective that have created a foundation for them as wine growers and producers.\n\nWhile the estate is not certified organic, Alberto and Alessandro work organically, maintaining cover crops and using only organic treatments in the vineyards. The wines are all fermented spontaneously and a minimal amount of SO2 is used at bottling to stabilize the wines.\n\nSelvagrossa Muschen Marche Rosso IGT 2021\n\nA blend of 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabenet Franc which are all fermented separately and blended after fermentation. The grapes are de=stemmed and the must is punched down. Temperature control fermentation is at 22-24 degrees Celsius. There is a four day maceration after fermentation. The wine remains on the lees in stainless steel tanks for three months. It's then blended and bottled by the end of May/ beginning of June. There is no oak. The Cabernet Franc and Merlot come from soils planted to clay and sand. Sangiovese is planted to limestone and sand: calcareous soils. Really good and brambly with nice texture. 20mg of free SO2. The total SO2 is 50 mg.\n\nMuschen is a fruit-fly in the local dialect. This annoying little insect is also Alberto’s nickname."
