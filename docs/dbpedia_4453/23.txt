History

After World War II, the ownership of the right-of-way of an uncompleted Imperial Japanese Army military railway line was transferred to Keisei. Shin-Keisei was established as a subsidiary of Keisei on 23 October 1946 to construct and operate the line.[3] The first section of the line, 2.5 km from Shin-Tsudanuma to Yakuendai, was opened on 27 December 1947, with a track gauge of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) and electrified at 1,500 V DC overhead.[3] The line was regauged to 1,372 mm (4 ft 6 in) in October 1953, and the entire line was completed as a single-track line by 21 April 1955.[3] In August 1959, the line was again regauged, this time to 1,435 mm (4 ft81â2 in) to match the standard gauge used by Keisei Electric Railway.[3]
