        "text": "The JR Yamanote Line is a loop line in central Tokyo operated by JR East. This is a very important line as it connects most of the major commercial districts and popular tourist destinations of Tokyo. The line is also famously busy, so services are very regular and come every 2 – 4 minutes. Trains run in both directions, clockwise and anticlockwise, around the loop. To travel the complete circuit would take about 1 hour.\n\nBecause this is a JR line it is covered by the Japan Rail Pass. Also if you are traveling from outside Tokyo with a JR ticket, you can use that same ticket to continue on to any station on the Yamanote Line. So if you travel by shinkansen to Ueno Station, you can transfer to the Yamanote Line without buying a new ticket. On maps and signage the Yamanote Line is color coded light green and Yamanote Line trains are also easily identified by their light green coloring.\n\nThe Yamanote Circuit\n\nThere are currently 29 stations on the Yamanote Line though this will increase to 30 stations in 2020. Following the route clockwise these stations are:\n\nTokyo – Yurakucho – Shimbashi – Hamamatsucho – Tamachi – Shinagawa – Osaki – Gotanda – Meguro – Ebisu – Shibuya – Harajuku – Yoyogi – Shinjuku – Shin-Okubo – Takadanobaba – Mejiro – Ikebukuro – Otsuka – Sugamo – Komagome – Tabata – Nishi-Nippori – Nippori – Uguisudani – Ueno – Okachimachi – Akihabara – Kanda – Tokyo\n\nThe name “Yamanote” comes from the Yamanote area of Tokyo. Literally Yamanote means “foothills” and traditionally this hilly area was the home for the richer, more upper class citizens of the city. The more working class areas were in the lowlands which are called Shitamachi (literally “downtown”). The modern Yamanote Line, however, links both traditional high class areas with typical Shitamachi areas such as Nippori in Arakawa ward, Ueno in Taito ward, and Kanda in Chiyoda ward.\n\nDestinations\n\nAmong the Yamanote Line destinations only Shin-Okubo and Mejiro have no transfers.\n\nUeno Station\n\nUeno is an important cultural center in Tokyo with a large number of major museums in the grounds of Ueno Park.
