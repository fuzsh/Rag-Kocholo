        "text": "I live in Kanagawa, so I can only speak from personal experience and things I have heard from other people (mostly railway fans and friends that are a bit deeper in the railway thing (model train companies, museum staff, etc.). I'm keeping it as well to the commuter companies here.\n\nOdakyu has a good reputation. Maybe a lot of suicides, but I don't know the statistics about this, so I can't go into this. I do know these usually cause a one hour delay. There are a lot of universities and colleges around the line, as well as living areas, which results in a lot of drunk people in the evening. These are the usual suspects like the white collar middle-class and students. Blue collar workers (like Keikyū) are less present. Next to that, they have dedicated limited express trains (Romance Cars), which are rare with Kanagawa oriented private railways. The Odakyū stations, especially the renovated ones, are usually sparkling clean and relatively chic in their utilitarian look. Especially in Setagaya-ku, one of the most exclusive places to live in Tokyo. Maybe the most successful operator, as they have access to major tourist spots (Enoshima, Hakone, Odawara and Oyama), as well as incorporated important transport companies (Enoden, Hakone Tozan, Kanachū, etc.) that provide feeder services for their trains.\n\nTōkyū runs through rather expensive places, so naturally the reputation and ridership is of a higher income class in general. High-density operation and service are the main traits. The Tōkyū stations, when new, are very modern and have interesting architecture incorporated. Old stations are wood and breathe a warm atmosphere. Especially smaller stations along the Ōimachi, Tamagawa and Ikegami lines are fantastic in this regard. Tōkyū also owns a swath of real estate, Izukyū and BookOff to name a few more operations, making their railway operations fantastic to connect these venues.\n\nSōtetsu is generally seen as just a people mover between the countryside of Kanagawa and Yokohama. High-density operation with visual signals (ATS-P), long trains, high speeds, lots of curves and strange experimental rolling stock. Apart from that, Sōtetsu (Holdings) isn't much of a player compared to Odakyū and Tōkyū. They however have no direct competition going on in regard to railway operations.\n\nKeikyū is indeed the blue-collar operator. Highly competitive with JR East between Shinagawa and Yokohama and all the way to the depth of the Miura peninsula and Zushi. Very fast trains, high density operation and a lot of factory workers (as the network largely passes the industrial coast). Keikyū is seen as the most fun railway company in the area by many. Though highly uncomfortable at times (imagine a packed 2100 series with its transverse seating), many people learn to love this company, even if they have no interest in trains at all (I've heard it on quite a few occasions from old study colleagues).\n\nYokohama Municipal Subway is indeed a municipally operated network with public funding, so profit is not the main goal of this company. Until recently there were only local trains, but a rapid service has been introduced on the very long Blue Line last month, improving service quality. This network is seen as purely utilitarian and has no tourism credentials, except for the sightseeing buses. Riding fees however are quite low and are a fixed ¥110 for children during holiday seasons. Service is excellent, though the seats are low and trains rather spartan in general."
