        "text": "Pink is the color of romance, feminine, and nurture\n\nThis article is about the symbolism and meaning of the color pink, which is part of the Color Meaning Series.\n\nFor detailed information about other colors, check out the meaning of the colors.\n\nWhere can we find the meaning of pink?\n\nIs it in the vibrant pink flowers in a park or in the sweet pink of bubble gum?\n\nMaybe we can find it in the cute ribbon of a little girl or in the sugary cotton candy that brings us back to our childhood.\n\nAs the most feminine color of all, pink is associated with girls and everything sweet.\n\nTo give you a full picture of the symbolism and meanings of the color pink, we’ll also talk about its most common uses, company logos, chakra, gemstone, facts, quotes, and idioms.\n\nPink Color Meanings in Different Cultures\n\nIn keeping with color psychology, each color has a significant influence on our lives – from our behavior to mood.\n\nStill, color associations are ambiguous and depend strongly on upbringing and each individual’s experience with specific colors.\n\nFor that reason, we will briefly nudge into the symbolism of pink in different cultures before jumping into its psychological meanings.\n\nIn Western cultures, pink is widely considered as the color of femininity and romance.\n\nIn Japan, pink is a popular color because of the cherry blossom, Japan’s unofficial flower.\n\nIn South Korea, pink symbolizes trust.\n\nWhat Does the Color Pink Mean in the Bible?\n\nAccording to the meaning of the colors in the Bible, pink is associated with healthy flesh, new life, heavenly care, feminine, and rose of Sharon.\n\nPsychological Meaning of Pink\n\nAs a blend of red and white, pink has traits of both colors. On one side, it has the passion and action of red, and on the other side, it has the peacefulness and purity of white.\n\nPink charms with ease while calming those surrounding it. According to a study from 1981, light pink has (temporary) calming effects on people.\n\nThe pink studied, drunk-tank pink, also known as Baker-Miller pink, was used in prison cells to tone down the inmate’s aggression.[1]\n\nHowever, its calming effects only occur during the initial exposure to the color. Inmates become agitated once they get used to the color. After all, pink also has some red traits.\n\nIn keeping with, the visitor’s locker room of Kinnick Stadium in Iowa is entirely pink to try to keep the opposite team less energetic and calmer.[2]\n\nAs a non-threatening color, pink is not only calming but also sweet, playful, approachable.\n\nIt’s a friendly color strongly associated with tenderness and nurture while conveying a sense of safety and vulnerability.\n\nColor Pink Meaning\n\nPink relish in giving and receiving nurture. It evokes images of compassion and kindness while charming with harmony.\n\nBecause pink is so affectionate, it is a color that needs acceptance and support.\n\nWhile it gives love without measures, pink also requires unconditional love to fulfill its need for attention, support, and care.\n\nFor instance, those who predominantly wear pink clothing might be subconsciously asking for attention.\n\nMore than anything, pink is the color of universal love – for oneself and others. It embodies all that is good in the world, showing an unmatched level of sympathy.\n\nHowever, like a delicate and romantic color, pink is a gentle type of love. It bursts with romance and is especially appealing to women.\n\nActually, pink is associated with girls in our modern society, but it hasn’t always been like this. In fact, the pink and blue trend is relatively new, and for a while, it used to be the other way around.\n\nUnlike red, pink represents romantic love rather than the heat of passion.\n\nBlame white for that. The lightest color of all softens pink to an innocent and euphoric hue.\n\nThe color pink is highly upbeat and relish in boosting the morale of those who need comforting.\n\nIt oozes optimism and gives hope to a level where no obstacles are big enough. For instance, the pink ribbon is an international symbol of breast cancer awareness.\n\nIntuitive and insightful, the color pink is vibrant and glows creativity. Yet, sometimes it sees the world through rose-tinted glasses: it can be excessively optimistic and unrealistic.\n\nAs a child, pink is sweet and innocent, but sometimes it can also be naive and silly.\n\nConsidering that, pink might not be the best color to wear for job interviews – not predominantly at least.\n\nBecause it is linked to childhood, pink is associated with inexperience. It can lead to irritation and inspire feelings of weakness when overused.\n\nIn the same breath, pink is nostalgic and relishes walking down memory lane and dwelling on the past.\n\nFor that reason, pink is also very sensitive and overly cautious, leading to a lack of confidence and passiveness.\n\nAs a timid color, pink prefers to blend in, rather than being the star of the show.\n\nStill, adding darker colors to a pink design adds strength and sophistication to it.\n\nPhysical Effects of Pink\n\nHere are some of the physical effects of pink on us:\n\nEnergize – The red influence on pink assures brighter shades of this color give us energy.\n\nRelaxing – On the white side, pink is a relaxing color and is known for toning down aggressive behavior, especially its pale tints.\n\nUplifting – Pink is a charming color that brings happy and optimistic thoughts.\n\nComforting – Because pink is such an optimistic color, it brings hope to those in need.\n\nPersonality Color Pink\n\nPink is an inherently sweet and charming color.
