They are for, but didn’t really state anything interesting. [Porcari later said things indicating he knows something useful, but I didn’t think his opening testimony indicated any knowledge of transport]\n\nMs. Danielle Eckert was more interested in creating a lot of jobs than anything useful. She would probably prefer to have NYC construction costs as more money goes to unions.\n\n“Trey” Duhon III is against. He references a lot of bureaucracy related barriers without making the connection that government should ease those. He talked a lot about competitive transport investment, but never says what they are, or how they compare in cost effectiveness. They can’t use eminent domain, but again doesn’t make the connection that this barriers is one reason they are having issues.\n\nKunz did mention reducing the barriers of doing things – hopeful. His testimony indicates he is at least somewhat aware that the regulation environment in the US. I didn’t quite catch everything, but his testimony worth listening to.\n\nMr Payne: (chair of committee) wants all American access – in particular rural areas. [This seems like something we need to shut down, or at least recognize that it isn’t cost effective]. Response [don’t recall who] is rural areas can get to cities – but nothing about how the rural areas get to HSR which is mostly between cities.\n\nMr Crawford: asked about impacts of Tx Central on land. Duhon: the FRA is not working with their group. Don’t use the same process as for TX central as the communities are ignored.\n\nMr Crawford: will this need public funding. Duhon: response that most HSR is subsidized worldwide, and this won’t change. Thinks ridership is overstated [I think we agree here]. Thinks people won’t quit driving in Texas.\n\nDeFazio: about HSR instead of 95 expansion. Has highway or airport (not seen as possible) expansion been compared? Porcari: environmental issues, also needs cooperation between states, by contrast NEC has that cooperation.\n\nDeFazio Subsidies worldwide? Porcari: airports are public, airlines make profit. Likewise trucks use highway, and make money. So subsidizing tracks makes sense.\n\nDeFazio right of way issues? Washington: have some, working on more\n\nDeFazio wants US jobs. Specifically against China. Washington: We have assembly plants in the US, proposing ground up (forging steel). Wants to build locomotives in their park. [not sure why – locomotives are not common]\n\nDavis: reality: how are we building them – without investing in new technologies. Communities are cut off by multiple rail lines running through. How can we encourage new technologies to grant better access? Porcari: federal programs that exist something [My internet died for a minute]\n\nDavis: rant about paperwork processes that take years. How does regulatory processes slow down our ability to achieve goals? Porcari: front loads the process. CA is more streamlined than previous processes because assigned to state level. Model for future. Force all the environmental reviews at the same time.\n\nDavis: looks forward to good policy.\n\nMalnowsky [I’m not sure if his name as an i or not]: Trains are the same speed as 100 years ago. Highway doesn’t live on a free market. Without the US would look different. Trains 96 million investment since 1949, compare to China, UK. UK is now doing more than the sum total of all ours. Notes that Acella is pathetic speeds compared to Europe. Why can’t we have nice things – can we surmount them? Porcari: We have old tunnels and such – but will is the real problem. We haven’t made rail a priority. We can do it with the will\n\nMalnowsky: wants more freedom to live anywhere where.\n\nSteel: Price tag of CA HSR – was supposed to be 33 billion, now over 100, and going up with no deadline. Tax payer money. We don’t have the commitment – but 100 billion isn’t? she sees HSR as a money pit (at current prices I agree). Says not opposed to HSR, but CA failed, and TX seems like it will. How do we know it won’t have these cost overruns? Likes HSR in Japan, where it is affordable. Duhon: where does it work – drop a line between two cities and everyone will go – this is not true. Where you put in HSR matters. Japanese don’t own cars. 2-3000 people per day. (missed some for personal reasons) A family won’t pay $1000 for a ticket when a car is $50 in gas. NEC makes sense, not TX.\n\nMoulton: We have investing a lot into highway subsidies. 60 billion/year even if you don’t own a car. What are the costs of widening Texas highways? Duhon: yes but TX central was private investment. (interrupted) Moulton: but HSR does sometimes operated at a profit, highways never do. HSR is half as much as adding a lane (Microsoft study in Seattle) 80MPH on a highway is a far cry from 150MPH+ on HSR. You can live in many more places and still get downtown (I wonder how this works – stations that close together limit speed). How much do you need to expand highways to do a HSR? Porcari: 6 lanes, and 6 (?) runways at airports.\n\nBurchett: HSR done right – but project has already more than doubled in cost and 2 years late – how is this done right? Washington: We can improve the lives of people in our county. [I didn’t catch his list, but it was at least a start in the right direction]\n\nBurchett: trust fund like highway – how to generate it? Porcari: all transportation should be on level funding. Let locals decide what the right mix is.\n\nBurchett: HSR favors urban over rural. How to benefit everyone? Duhon: wants locals as meaningful partners. How does it impact us? Can routes be adjusted? FRA doesn’t engage with us. FRA telling states not to meet with local groups.\n\nNewman: Big gaps where commuter lines don’t connect. Wants Higher speed rail (not HSR) for 20 mile stretches. Shift workers often don’t have a good connection. How expensive is it on the environment to NOT do this? Has the impact of not doing HSR been studied? Procari: some places are. Very project specific. Long term growth is clear. Washington: in lives lost on highways. Lightrail in LA get a lot of people working at the airport to work. Transportation is bigger emitter of pollution. Measure that in lives. Kunz: cost of people’s time – stuck in traffic. 7 billion per year (time is money).\n\nNewman: for the record, we should stop talking about should or should not be done. We need to ask how not why. There is no better reason than to create opportunity and save lives.\n\nCarson: need for federal government investment – compared to other industrialized nations. We fall behind others. Opponents argue for private investment. How do you respond? Porcari: not irreconcilable. There are private rails – PPP is established model. Needs public funding to happen. Washington: need to build and rebuild is so great that we need all 3, federal, local, and private investment. Need 3 legged stool. Private sector wants to invest and is strong. Local – 70% success on local investments. federal is wobbly.\n\nWilson: how do we generate jobs? Eckert: 30% should make 32-42,000 per year. (some small number) should be those who have barriers to normal work.\n\nWilson: What do others get as a result of their investment? Kunz: jobs, economic development to depress areas, time, affordable housing, be with families.\n\nStrickland: from environmental perspective, how is Seattle uniquely poised to take advantage? Smith: have a partnerships to get done. PPP, local funding, fare box recovery. Can put funding together. Good labor relations. Community made a commitment to transit. [no mention that this line is still marginal rideship]\n\nStrickland: congestion is bad on interstate. what is cost of adding a lane to I5 vs HSR? Smith: there is no way to meet capacity – rail is exponentially more people [I bet should doesn’t know what exponential is – the functions are linear, just a much better factor]. [My internet died so I don’t know if she answered the question, but I’m suspecting not]\n\nNeopolitano [I can’t find a spelling of her name]. [I Didn’t understand question] Washignton: most deadly crossing. Union station will be the hub of HSR when it comes, already has metrolink and Amtrac. 423 million dollars to develop fly over. – stub in station have to back out, a run through track (and elsewhere) make it efficient for trains to not have to idle. Will save lives and be more efficient.\n\nNeopolitano: how can we ensure low-income can afford tickets to HSR? Porcari: fare structure that recognizes employer contributions. Affordability is a concern. Should be part of contract if there is a private operator. Kunnz: France has a second no-frills system, much cheaper. Very efficient, high capacity, not expensive to operate. Neopolitano: government in Europe owns land – no eminent domain issues there. Doesn’t seem fair for taxpayers to fund and not get benefit.\n\nTitus: Likes Brightline west (LA-Los Vegas). Estimated ridership 10 million people. How are we coordinating inter-modal connections? [great question!] Washington: Detailed specifics about LA getting to union station. [losts more good discussion but if you don’t know LA/Los Vegas it won’t make sense]\n\nHuffman: Under investment in rail compared to highways and aviation – even with trust fund we are stretched to build more. How can we ensure HSR compliments instead of competes with other service? Porcari: HSR is over longer lengths with fewer stops. States need to make tradeoffs.\n\nHuffman: Where is thismanufacturingg hub – what would we get? Washington: Industrial park with suppliers on site, and test track on site. Climate chamber…. Build everything on one site. in North LA county where these is plenty of space.\n\nAuchincloss: If you were investing in HSR what would you need guaranteed – part of charter to build on time and under budget? Porcari: consistency and predictability. Downfall of PPP is everything is bespoke – no templates. No way to price political risk. Where those are used they (ie outside of US) have an end point. Kunz: we need substantial funding. Focus on key projects and get to completion. Prioritize projects so people can ride. Auchuncloss: Reduce political risk and get to work. Eckert: make sure covered by federal railroad unions.\n\nJohnson: hesitancy – concern about lack of capital. What about those who think the network is too expensive – and thus not worthwhile? Kunz: need to look at what these systems do. Struggle with energy and other problems draging us down. Big vision, bold funding can see these transformations. This is proven around the world. [perfect opportunity to bring up Spanish costs was ignored!] Johnson: before highways had rails.\n\n[missed question – my lunch time] Kunz: HSR opens up and makes the nation and each country more efficient. Keep up with China or they lead us in the Dust.\n\nJohnson: much of nation has been left out. How can we help rural areas? Kunz: beauty of HSR, in a corridor: HSR connects all cities in between. Not all trains stop at all stations, but some will so people have access. And access brings companies to those towns\n\nGarcia: what type of rail isn’t a rail carrier (something about unions): Eckert: railroad retirement act. No wage stagnation because of high union density. Garcia: what are obstacles to make HSR a reality? Porcari: need to think big. Need to fully load cost – environmental and safety impacts. Kunz: [specifically asked, didn’t respond]\n\nPanel 2:\n\nCarlos Aguilar: tx central is a safety project. saving 800 lives.\n\nWilliam Flynn: Amtrak is a HSR operator. Shouldn’t made a few rails that take years, instead a large network.\n\nMr. Josh Giegel: 500 tests of Hyperloop to date. Claims to be ready – where will it happen first?\n\nMr. Andres de Leon: Claims Hperloop is ready. $54 million/mile – less than HSR. [maybe in US, not Spain – I wonder if they can really do that]\n\nMr. Michael Reininger: Allow more investment via programs that are maxed out. They could do more with more funding. Low interest loans would be better than larger grants, and reduce public investment while getting more HSR.\n\nMr. Wayne Rogers: Maglev\n\nPayne: how do you keep project equal for minority. Aguilar: targets. 34% inclusion for construction.\n\nCrawford: will new routes to small towns make money? Flynn: these routes are opened in consultation with state and city. This will ensure there is a level of ridership. Crawford: do not know if it is self sustaining. Flynn: no. We think it will need support, but that will come from states. States need to sign up for that.\n\nCrawford: How do you connect to rural communities? Giegel: Can get around smaller cities. Little rock to Memphis in 15 minutes\n\nMoulton: What is timeline? Andres de Leon needs funding. Then in 3 years ready to move people.\n\nMoulton: What is the speeds you got? Giegel: 120MPH. Need more length to build that out. Takes a couple more years.\n\nMoulton: While Japanese technology over hyperloop? Aguliar: Proven, predictable and safe. Want to be first.\n\nMoulton: what is top speed of Acella? Flynn 135 MPH. Operating at lower speed on schedule basis. Up to 150, but only runs that speed for 34 miles. Moulton: 8-10 minutes over 7 hour trip. Are you really HSR? Flynn: yes. Moulton: HSR is 160MPH elsewhere should we accept that lower speed? Flynn: on existing track. There is top speed and scheduled speed. Moulton: America revised down our definition of HSR down – why not aspire to be best in the world? Flynn: in 2012 we called for higher speed. We are lacking funding.\n\nDavis: Any interst in connecting Illinois? Reininger: We need to go back to the map of Springfield [why not Chicago] and see if there is anything that makes sense within 200 miles. Davis: How can we spur more private sector investment? Reininger: funding. Make us eligible for grant funding when in partnership with public. More bond allocations. (that alone is enough, not liquid enough) RIFT loans – more of these.\n\nDavis: What changes to ensure success? Giegel: be eligible for the same pots as the rest. Creating the ability to compete in a friendly way.\n\nDavis: short shunt issue [I’m not sure what this is] Flynn: working on that issue. Davis: can’t talk about HSR without reliability on the lines. Lets get that fixed.\n\n[I was working and missed a few questions. Mostly related to labor/unions not HSR]\n\nTitus: what else to increase funding? Reininger: revamp grant and loan programs. Curtail discretion in process – they turn into time delays and more costs.\n\nWesterman: hyperloop claims costs of $54million/mile, compared to 150-200 million/mile for others. State says interstate is 9.7 million/mile. 11.45 in mountains. What do you mean by only 54, compared to others? Andres de Leon: depends on country. Cannot have a real cost until you do analyses territory and real costs. These number make sense. Westerman: what is experience on cost for high speed rail? Reininger: 16 million/mile in Fl, expected to be 31 in CA.\n\nWesterman: hyperloop has a lot of advantages, but not as proven. Outside of that, why looking at hyperloop first? Carlos Aguilar: short term needs/solution. Market is congested and needs solutions to be operated. $62 million/mile – 50% viaduct to reduce impact on land owners. Flynn: different technology, be we have other trains on our rail today. Wants to work on existing infrastructure with just some upgrades over next decade\n\nGarcia: concerned about Chicago. will amtrak invest more? Flynn: yes. Have plan for new and expanded services. Madison, Milwaukee, to Minneapolis. St Louis. Detroit. Garcia: existing funding won’t make a dent in exiting HSR – does HSR need dedicated funding? Flynn: needs certainly of funding, and projects will take longer. One policy action: create trust fund for intercity transit. Garcia: any other places for electrification? Flynn: others lend themselves. Key density and population centers. Intercity train sets are dual mode. These are interim steps.\n\nLaMalfa: TX is having difficultly with ability to streamline. How can CA do it at 50% higher prices and a negative regulatory climate? This is environmental project and still can’t get very far. [asked a question, but I didn’t figure out what]\n\n[didn’t catch her name]: Dallas is interested in downtown terminal. Aguilar: started talking to city last month, will connect to DART."
