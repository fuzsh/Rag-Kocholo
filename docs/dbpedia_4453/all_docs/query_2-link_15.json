        "text": "edit\n\nGetting There\n\nBy Plane\n\nYokohama does not have its own airport. You can reach Yokohama from Tokyo's two main airports.\n\nSome Narita Express trains from Narita Airport go through to Yokohama (1½ hours, ¥4,290). Limousine Buses run frequently from Narita to the Yokohama City Air Terminal (YCAT) in 2 hours (¥3,600). The cheapest access from Narita Airport involves a Keisei train. The Keisei Main Line train, with one across-the-platform transfer at Aoto, will cost ¥1,500 to Yokohama. The Sky Access line train will cost ¥1,690. Most Sky Access trains run to Keisei Ueno, but there are a handful each day which run through to Yokohama (and beyond; generally to Kanazawa-Bunko) on the Keikyu Main Line.\n\nFrom Haneda Airport, take the Keikyu Line's Airport Express (エアポート急行) to Yokohama station in 30-35 minutes for ¥480. Note that the Airport Express has several variants: If the train's destination is Shin-Zushi (新逗子) or Kanazawa-Bunko (金沢文庫), then you can stay on the train for the entire trip. If the train goes to another destination, it's likely to continue on into Tokyo so you will need to change at Keikyu-Kamata station to the next main line limited express train going in the other direction. Limousine bus to YCAT is also an option. Cost is 580 yen and duration is about 30 minutes.\n\nBy Train\n\nThe overwhelming majority of visitors to Yokohama arrive from Tokyo by train. A multitude of train lines connect the two cities at roughly equal prices, but some of the more convenient options are:\n\nTokyu Toyoko Line (東急東横線) from Shibuya to Yokohama Station. A trip from Shibuya to Yokohama takes as little as 26 minutes on the fastest service; at a cost of ¥270 this is the cheapest trip from metro Tokyo. Chinatown, the terminus of the MM21 line, is another 10 minutes away (Motomachi-Chukagai, ¥480). Up to eight kyūkō (急行) and tokkyū (特急) trains per hour.\n\nJR Ueno-Tokyo Line (上野東京ライン) and Tokaido Main Line (東海道線) from Ueno, Tokyo and Shinagawa stations (all on the Yamanote Line). Departs every 10 minutes; more trains during rush hour. About 25 minutes from Tokyo to Yokohama, ¥470. Note that Commuter Rapid Service (通勤快速) and Shonan Liner (湘南ライナー) trains do not stop at Yokohama Station.\n\nJR Shonan Shinjuku Line (湘南新宿ライン) from Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ebisu and Ōsaki. This was the first line that connected the western part of the Tokyo metropolis to Yokohama; it competes with the Fukutoshin and Toyoko lines. Roughly four trains per hour, reaching Yokohama from Shinjuku in as little as 30 minutes at a cost of ¥550.\n\nJR Yokosuka Line (横須賀線): A less-convenient alternative from Tokyo Station and Shinagawa. However, it is the route of choice if coming from stations east of Tokyo on the Sobu Rapid line, such as Tsudanuma and Chiba, as most of these trains continue onto the Yokosuka line. About 30 minutes from Tokyo to Yokohama; about 75 minutes from Chiba (¥1,080). Departs every 15 minutes or so from Tokyo; more trains during rush hour.\n\nJR Keihin Tohoku Line (京浜東北線) from Nippori, Ueno, Akihabara, Tokyo, and Shinagawa Stations. This train stops at more stations in Yokohama than the Yokosuka Line, including Sakuragicho (桜木町), which is within walking distance of Chinatown. It is also a convenient route from stations north of Tokyo in Saitama prefecture. About 35 minutes from Tokyo Station to Yokohama Station. Departs every 5 minutes from Tokyo; more trains during rush hour.\n\nKeihin Kyuko Main Line (京急本線), or Keikyu for short, from Shinagawa and Haneda Airport. Most trains from the Toei Asakusa subway line continue onto the Keikyu line. Departs every 10 minutes from Shinagawa at a cost of ¥300 (more trains during rush hour), with the fastest train reaching Yokohama in only 18 minutes. Note that Keikyu WING (京急ウィング) trains do not stop at Yokohama.\n\nSotetsu Line (相鉄線） from Ebina to Yokohama (25 minutes by limited express, ¥310) and from Shonan-dai to Yokohama (30 minutes by express, ¥350). A useful connection from the western Tokyo suburbs on the Odakyu Line. This train will go direct to Shibuya in 2019.\n\nTokaido Shinkansen (Nozomi/Hikari/Kodama) trains go to Shin-Yokohama station instead, a few stations away from the main Yokohama station. The two stations are connected via the JR Yokohama line (10-15mins, ¥170. A few direct trains from Yokohama per hour otherwise take Keihin-Tohoku line to Higashi Kanagawa station and transfer there) and the Yokohama Subway Blue Line (10 minutes, ¥240, direct). Alternatively, take the Shinkansen to Shinagawa and change to the Tokaido, Yokosuka or Keihin Tohoku lines. If you take other Shinkansen lines (Tohoku/Hokuriku/Nagano), transfer at Tokyo station to Tokaido or Keihin Tohoku. If your final destination is Chinatown or the harbor area, transfer at Shin-Yokohama to either Blue line or Yokohama line mentioned above.\n\nThe Minato Mirai Line (みなとみらい線), opened in 2004, is a direct extension of the Tokyu Toyoko Line. Connection with the lines is at Yokohama Station, and the line itself has five stations: Shin-Takashimacho (新高島町), Minatomirai (みなとみらい), Bashamichi (馬車道), Nihon Ōdori (日本大通り), and Motomachi-Chūkagai (元町・中華街), terminating at the posh Motomachi shopping street and the second largest Chinatown in the world. The line’s stations itself are worth seeing, especially Minato-Mirai Station itself, where you are able to see straight up to the very spacious entrance hall (7 floors in all) of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan. (The tallest is Abeno Harukas in Osaka.)\n\nBashamichi Station is built with artifact bricks and hosts the remains of the first western style bank of Yokohama. Note also that Bashamichi (literal translation: horse carriage street) was the first street in Japan to have gas fired street lighting, which were re-installed lately. Bashamichi Station is surrounded by historical buildings, built only a century ago, but for Japanese standards are a true catapulting into westernization. Thus all buildings remaining (partially rebuilt after the heavy bombings of WWII) are protected as “historical – cultural national treasure.”\n\nNihon-Ōdori Station is similar to Bashamichi Station. Nihon-Ōdori (meaning Japan Avenue) is a two lane-two way avenue, which back then separated the living quarters of the foreign delegation and Japanese.\n\nThe line runs parallel to the Keihin-Tohoku Line. Due to the massive expense of maintaining the designer-class stations, the fares are rather pricey, but definitely worthwhile. The line runs through the very historical parts of Yokohama, when Japan opened up to the Western civilization. Many history-related museums of Yokohama are dotted along the line, and to attract further tourists, the line offers a one-day unlimited ride ticket (¥460 for adults, 1/2 price for children).\n\nBy Car\n\nIt's not recommended to use your (rental) car to drive into Yokohama. Otherwise, park it as quickly as possible in an underground parking and start using public transport, taxis or walk.\n\nBy Bus\n\nBuses connect Yokohama with other cities and surrounding areas in Japan.\n\nBy Boat\n\nFESCO used to run a service from Vostochny Port/Nakhodka in Far Eastern Russia to Yokohama but expired in 1991. Now it's reported that Russia and Japan started a discussion to start this route but there seems to be some obstacles such as political relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Car\n\nTaxis are very easy to hitch anywhere in the city center. There are several companies such as JUN or ASKA that cater van taxies for big groups. There are some companies that has UD (Universal Design) taxi which you can take when you're on wheelchair. The cost for such cars is similar to the ordinary taxis (go by meters and starts from 730 yen. You will need an additional 300 yen to arrange a pickup).\n\nVelo taxis are widely available within the harbor area, while rickshaws make their rounds within Chinatown.\n\nBy Public Transport\n\nThe Minato Mirai 21 subway line from Yokohama station down the harborfront to Chinatown is the best method of accessing the main tourist haunts. The main subway line is useful primarily for transfers between central Yokohama and the Shinkansen station. JR Negishi Line (根岸線) is also available for Chinatown and Minato Mirai Area. All Negishi Line Trains with the blue line are direct service via the Keihin-Tohoku Line. For suburban areas, Yokohama has a subway and extensive commuter rail lines that crisscross the city from every direction and to all neighboring cities.\n\nYokohama Subway (横浜市営地下鉄) This train has two types: the \"blue line\" and the \"green line\". The former is from Azamino to Shonandai. The latter is from Hiyoshi to Nakayama. Using this train, you can get around Yokohama easily.\n\nAkai Kutsu Bus is a sight seeing bus around Minatomirai, Chinatown and Motomachi. It runs every 20-30 minutes and looks like an old red bus. A ticket costs ¥220. Fare is covered by 1day pass of Yokohama Municipal Bus service which costs 600yen.\n\nThe \"Sea Bass\" boat operates between JR Yokohama station (east exit), Minato Mirai and Yamashita Park, and is one of the nicest ways to get around on a sunny day. The fare is ¥350-700 depending on the distance.\n\nCentral Yokohama is comparatively compact and the Chinatown/Yamashita Park area is best explored on foot.\n\nBy Bike\n\nThere's a shared bicycles called Baybike. You need to create an account before you rent.\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nManga cafes are dotted along the streets of almost every city in Japan. For a very reasonable price (about ¥100 per 15 minutes), you receive a private cubicle with a PC with internet access at blistering Japanese internet speeds. The chairs are incredibly comfortable (making them an excellent place to sleep for the cash-deprived), and you can even order snacks and drinks from the staff.\n\nA number of business hotels have Internet access available if you have your own device, sometimes for free. It is also possible to find Wi-Fi \"hot spots\" around many large cities in Japan, especially near tech-related businesses and large corporate buildings with unsecured wireless networks. 3G Wireless Data and Pocket Wifi are other options.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also: International Telephone Calls\n\nPayphones (公衆電話 kōshū denwa) are easily found, particularly near train stations, although with the popularity of mobile phones, public pay phones are not quite as numerous as they once were. Gray and green pay phones accept ¥10 and ¥100 coins and prepaid cards. Be aware that not all places with public telephones have phones that accept coins, so it may be worthwhile to buy a phone card for emergency use. Some of the gray phones, as indicated on the display, can make international calls. Pre-paid cards can be purchased at convenience stores, train station kiosk stores and sometimes in vending machines next to the phone.\n\nModern Japanese mobile phones (携帯電話 keitai denwa or just keitai) tend to operate on unique cellular standards not always compatible with the rest of the world. 3G phones using the UMTS/WCDMA2100 standard and equipped with a 3G SIM card will most likely work. If your phone is up to spec, double-check with your carrier if they have a roaming agreement with either SoftBank or NTT DoCoMo. Coverage is generally excellent, unless you are heading to some remote mountainous areas. If you have no 3G phone but still have a 3G-compatible SIM card, you can rent a 3G phone in Japan and slot in your card, allowing you to keep your home phone number in Japan. For a longer trip, you can also purchase a phone, but doing this legally requires an Alien Registration Card (or an obliging Japanese friend willing to front for you).\n\nThe easier way is to get a prepaid phone. Prepaid phones are sold in most SoftBank and AU stores. If you already have a 3G phone, go with Softbank as it can sell SIMs as opposed to au whose prepaid service is phone-based like most CDMA carriers. Prepaid phones use a \"card\" with a pass key to \"charge\" a phone with minutes. These prepaid calling cards, unlike the phone itself, can be found in most convenience stores. A prepaid cell phone is available for as little as ¥5000 plus ¥3000 for a 60-90 day call time package, which will get drained at a rate of ¥100 per minute (¥10 per 6 seconds for AU's prepaid service). Both SoftBank and AU offer prepaid phones.\n\nPost\n\nThe Japanese postal service is excellent! Domestic and international mail service is very quick and reliable. The prices for sending letters, postcards and parcels vary depending on where you send if from and to which country you send it too, and of course depends on weight as well, so check this calculation page of Japan Post for more details. Post offices generally are open from 9:00am to 5:00pm on weekdays, closing at weekends and also on national holidays, though a few open on Saturdays from 9:00am to 3:00pm. Central post offices are sometimes open until 7:00pm, open on Saturdays from 9:00am to 5:00pm and on Sundays and holidays from 9:00am to 12:30pm. There are post offices in every major city and minor town. Another thing to remember is that the post office is one of the few places in Japan that is guaranteed to have ATMs that take international cards."
