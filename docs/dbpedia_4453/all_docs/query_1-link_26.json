        "text": "The Moha 100 was the company's first semi-steel electric train, which Keisei Electric Railway, the predecessor of Keisei Electric Railway, built when Narita opened in 1926.\n\n25 new cars were manufactured, and all of them, including those that suffered from garage fires and war damage, received body updates after the war and became Keisei's main vehicles.\n\nIn the 1960s, all the cars were transferred to Shin-Keisei Electric Railway, but even though they were small cars, they were valued at a time when passenger numbers were rapidly increasing, and they continued to be used until 1987.\n\nThis book explains the more than 60 years of service from the Keisei to Shin-Keisei eras, including 25 cars of the 100 type and 10 cars of the same type 126, with a focus on the differences between each model, along with color pages.\n\nThe first volume looks back at the time from when it was new to the time it was transferred to Shin-Keisei and the change in paint color in the 1970s."
