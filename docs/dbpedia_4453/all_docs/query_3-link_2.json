        "text": "The association of pink with femininity is a traditional perspective that’s increasingly challenged in contemporary design. From the gentle to the vibrant, the calming to the assertive, and the sophisticated to the playful—it can convey a spectrum of impressions, much of which depends on the context and specific shade used.\n\nDive in to discover how to design with the color pink. Learn about its history, symbolism, the best color combinations, and discover our specially curated collection of pink-inspired images.\n\nExplore Pink Collection\n\nHistory of the color pink\n\nThe first time a pink colour was mentioned was in 800 B.C. In Homer’s Odyssey, it is referenced as the rosy color of dawn. It was also referenced later in Ancient Rome — people used the Latin word “roseus,” which means “rose,” to describe the pink color.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and Renaissance era, the color pink was often used in religious paintings and symbolized the bonds between mothers and their children. In the 18th century, pink meaning first started to include luxury and femininity due to Madame de Pompadour, who was well-known for her love of that hue. Around that time, other royals across Europe started wearing pink items. The color was also used in interior design along with other pastel hues.\n\nIn the 19th century, pink was a common color among English males. Back then, English military uniforms were red, and pink was viewed as a lighter version of that hue. Blue, on the contrary, was considered a more delicate color, commonly associated with females.\n\nThis color pink meaning, however, changed in the mid-20th century, after World War II. As men started wearing darker colors, the brighter and pastel hues, including pink, were rebranded as feminine. This mostly happened because, in the postwar period, society was focusing on reestablishing women as homemakers and caregivers.\n\nIn the late 20th century, pink continued to be considered a baby girl color, but this changed in the 1990s. During that period, many Western cultures started viewing pink as a more gender-neutral color.\n\nTo get free downloads, click the banner above, switch to «Annual Upfront» subscriptions, and press the «Free 7 Day Trial» button.\n\nColor psychology of pink\n\nThe rich and diverse history of pink greatly contributed to how this hue is perceived today. Depending on the context, the color pink meaning can be both positive and negative.\n\nHow pink can affect mental health\n\nPink is often considered to have a calming impact on humans. It can soothe a person and help create a sense of tranquility and relaxation.\n\nThis color is generally associated with feelings of warmth, affection, and love. Pink can also contribute to a sweet, innocent, or playful mood.\n\nPink colour meaning and the impression it can create also depends on its shade. For instance, fuchsia is a strong pink shade that is often associated with something energetic and confident. Calmer shades, on the other hand, are usually associated with tenderness and care.\n\nPositive associations with pink\n\nOne of the most common symbolic meanings of pink is love and romance. It is also often linked with positive aspects of traditional femininity, such as kindness, empathy, and gentle nature. A lighter pink color represents positive aspects of childhood and youthfulness — innocence and playfulness.\n\nNegative associations with pink\n\nPink symbolic meaning can be negative — for instance, if the hue is used excessively. In this case, it may be perceived as overly sweet or even childish. Pink is also generally not the best color for professional or serious designs and contexts, as it can create a lighthearted and even shallow impression. Although the history of the color pink has been traditionally associated with femininity, the contemporary world is moving away from this stereotype.\n\nTypes and shades of pink\n\nAs mentioned above, the meaning of pink can differ depending on its shade.
