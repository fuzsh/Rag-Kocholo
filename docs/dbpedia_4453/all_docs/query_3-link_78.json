        "text": "The colors of Saint Patrick’s Day are not necessarily the same as Saint Patrick’s colors. While mentioning the patron saint of Ireland everybody starts thinking green, things are a bit more complicated. This article will explain the role of the colors of this popular feast, with some history behind it, and, for a more scientific approach we’ll also add HEX and RGB codes for all the presented colors.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Flag Color Codes\n\nThe official flag of Saint Patrick has no green color at all. It’s a simple flag with a red cross on a white background. St. Patrick’s Cross, also known as St. Patrick’s Saltire was adopted at the end of the 19th century by the Anglo-Irish Order of Saint Patrick. It is supposed to have roots in one of the powerful Irish dynasties but there are no convincing proofs for that claim. The Order was established by British King George III and Irish nationalists rejected it.\n\nHere it is.\n\nCodes for the colors are:\n\nRed: #C7042C (199, 4, 44) and White: #FFFFFF (255, 255, 255)\n\nSt. Patrick’s Color\n\nSt. Patrick’s color was blue, not green. There are several candidates for the specific shade of blue, with the sash of the Order of St. Patrick, arms of the Kingdom of Ireland, and Irish presidential standard as the main contenders. Others have their own ideas of St. Patrick’s Blue.\n\n#7696AB (118, 150, 171) St. Patrick’s Order Sash\n\n#285AA1 (40, 90, 161) Kingdom of Ireland Arms Blue\n\n#00005C (0, 0, 96) Irish Presidential Standard Blue\n\n#23297A (35, 41, 122) St. Patrick’s Blue (Encycolorpedia)\n\n#94C4E1 (148, 196, 225) Patrick’s Perfect Day (Valspar)\n\nIrish Flag Colors\n\nThe Irish flag consists of three colors: green, white, and orange. We already have a code for white and here are the codes for green and orange:\n\nGreen: #009A49 (0, 154, 7) and Orange: #FF7900 (255,121,0)\n\nThe problem with green is that almost everybody has his intimate vision of the right shade of green. The green hue above is made by Pantone, by the way. Orange is even more controversial. Some people believe it should be gold (coming from the golden harp which was used in the Irish flag before 1916), not orange, so a stripe in the yellow shade would be way better.\n\nSomething like Golden Yellow: #FFD700 (255, 215, 0) on the left or Irish Linen (Berger) #F8F3DA (248, 243, 218) on the right in the picture above. Harp is still a national instrument of Ireland and a must at celebrations in honor of its patron saint.\n\nWhile green in the flag is symbolizing the Catholic majority in Ireland, orange represents Protestants, supporters of William of Orange from the Netherlands. White between both other colors should show the peaceful coexistence of both religions in Ireland. With time, green became a symbol of Irish Nationalists and Orange a symbol of British Unionists. But let’s leave politics to politicians and check the possible shades of green, useful for all kinds of projects related to the celebration of St. Patrick’s Day.\n\nIrish Green\n\nWhat can look more Irish than the Irish Green color? We can certainly expect more than one solution when we look for the RGB code of this particular shade of green.

On the other hand, each one of us prefers specific authorities on specific subjects. The car industry, for instance, has its very own logic. All the next five shades of Emerald Green are made by Chrysler and all bear the same name.\n\nEmerald Green by Chrysler\n\n#72B2B2 (114, 178, 178)\n\n#4F6F78 (79, 111, 120)\n\n#507C76 (80, 124, 118)\n\n#3F6D70 (63, 109, 112)\n\n#193236 (25, 50, 54)\n\nThey look similar yet they difer.

The composition of their crystal structure with always present impurities will always offer a wide variety of hues even before the grinding.\n\nThen, of course, the color changes even more, depending on the point of view.\n\nKelly Green\n\nKelly is a popular Irish name. It can mean many things, icluding warrior, the-one-who-frequently-goes-to-church, bright headed, and wood. It’s used as first name and surname and you can name Kelly a boy or a girl. Kelly is one of the words that are most closely associated with Ireland. Kelly Green is a popular color and it’s time to find out why it’s so special.\n\n#4CBB17 (76, 187, 23) Canva\n\n#339C5E (51, 156, 94) Pantone\n\n#238A64 (35, 138, 100) FolkArt\n\n#046A38 (4,106,56) Colorcodes\n\n#00C957 (00C957) Crayola\n\nNow is also a perfect opportunity to compare Kelly Green to Irish Green.

Enjoy Your celebration of St. Patrick’s Feast and don’t forget to share this article with everybody who might be interested.\n\nThere are several definitions of violet color. It all started with Isaac Newton who defined certain wavelengths (from 380 to 435 nm) of visible light as violet. The name came from the flowers of violet color. This is where things might become a bit complicated because we know several kinds of different violets and each one of them can vary a bit in shades.\n\nIn the RGB model violet is made by mixing blue and red with blue as the dominant light and in the CMYK model by using magenta and cyan with magenta as the dominant pigment. On the color wheel, we can find it between blue and magenta.\n\nThis article will present many different shades of violet with examples. Here you’ll find names, HTML codes, and RGB codes. Some of the shades will inevitably overlap with other colors where blue and red are also the main ingredients. The aim of this article is to collect as many shades as possible in one place in logical order which is useful for everybody interested in color violet. If you find it interesting, share it with your friends.\n\n#7F00FF (127, 0, 255) Violet\n\n#EE82EE (238, 130, 238) Violet (Web)\n\n#8B00FF (139, 0, 255) True Violet\n\n#53357D (83, 53, 125) Prism Violet\n\n#9400D3 (148, 0, 211) Violet Ink\n\nPhoto of violet – a beautiful example of blue-red combo\n\nDark Violet Color\n\n#8000FF (128, 0, 255) Dark Violet\n\n#330066 (51, 0, 102) Deep Violet Color\n\n#784384 (120, 67, 132) Night Violet\n\n#6A75AD (106, 117, 173) Midnight Violet\n\n#4F566C (79, 86, 108) Heavy Violet\n\nAs you can see we already have a bit of a problem with naming. There are already two colors named simply violet but by different standards. There are also two colors named Dark Violet (the other has HEX code #9400D3) and with Deep Violet we only open the doors to more interpretations.\n\nAt least we can conclude that the general perception of violet is that it’s a color where we have more blue than red in the mixture. We’ll of course find some exceptions as well but these will soon lead to other names.\n\n#9F00FF (159, 0, 255) Vivid Violet\n\n#645394 (100, 83, 148) Ultra Violet\n\n#8F00FF (143, 0, 255) Electric Violet\n\n#AA00FF (170, 0, 255) Digital Violet\n\n#661188 (102, 17, 136) Extraviolet\n\nViolet can be a pretty energetic and intense color. According to the names above it’s very fashionable as well. So if you need ultra violet RGB code or want to know what Electric Violet Color looks like, you are in the right place.\n\nViolet Colors Names in Combination with Other Colors\n\n#C71585 (199, 21, 133) Red-Violet\n\n#F75394 (247, 83, 148) Violet-Red\n\n#BB3385 (187, 51, 133) Medium Red-Violet\n\n#47243C (71, 36, 60) Purple Violet\n\n#B197BE (177, 151, 190) Purple Violet (Dutch Boy)\n\n#553592 (85, 53, 146) Magenta Violet\n\n#9B8E8E (155, 142, 142) Grey Violet\n\n#C71585 (199, 21, 133) Medium Violet Red\n\n#8A2BE2 (138, 43, 226) Blue-Violet\n\n#324AB2 (50, 74, 178) Violet-Blue\n\nThese are only a few examples. Dozens of paint makers offer their unique mixtures of violet paints where additional color is added to violet.\n\nLight Violet Shades\n\nLight shades of violet are especially popular as wall paints due to their soothing/relaxing effect. It is believed that light violet shades act especially stimulative on intellectual activities. Here are a few bright, pastel, pale, soft, and other light violet colors with HEX and RGB codes.\n\n#CB99C9 (203, 153, 201) Pastel Violet\n\n#EE82EE (238, 130, 238) Bright Violet\n\n#8F7DA5 (143, 125, 165) Chalk Violet\n\n#803790 (128, 55, 144) Dull Violet\n\n#DDBEDD (221, 190, 221) Faded Violet\n\n#DB7093 (219, 112, 147) Pale Violet Red\n\n#DBD7E4 (219, 215, 228) Misty Violet\n\n#D4B8BF (212, 184, 191) Melting Violet\n\n#D1C0BF (209, 192, 191) Hushed Violet\n\n#643A4C (100, 58, 76) Crushed Violets\n\nViolet Color and Feelings\n\nLike all colors, violet affects our mood.

They are cultural products as well. Here are some examples of the perception of the violets around the globe.\n\n#B284BE (178, 132, 190) African Violet\n\n#551B8C (85, 27, 140) American Violet\n\n#8B818C (139, 129, 140) Asian Violet\n\n#856088 (133, 96, 136) Chinese Violet\n\n#563C5C (86, 60, 92) English Violet\n\nTo be honest, the African Violet color got its name after the flower, not after the continent. Anyway, the flower is named after Africa, and you’ll have a chance to find many more kinds of violet colors named after flowers and other plants. A bit later, of course.\n\n#8806CE (136, 6, 206) French Violet\n\n#5B3256 (91, 50, 86) Japanese Violet (JTC Violet)\n\n#32174D (50, 23, 77) Russian Violet\n\n#81007f (129, 0, 127) Philippine Violet\n\n#4C2882 (76, 40, 130) Spanish Violet (G&S)\n\n#4D517F (77, 81, 127) Roman Violet\n\n#777CB0 (119, 124, 176) Ontario Violet\n\n#32127A (50, 18, 122) Persian Indigo\n\n#8C8EB2 (140, 142, 178) Persian Violet aka Viola Odarata aka Ogleia\n\n#702963 (112, 41, 99) Byzantium\n\n#66023C (102, 2, 60) Tyrian Purple\n\n#55455A (85, 69, 90) Parma Violet\n\n#DABAD1 (2018, 186, 209) Venitian Violet\n\n#CDA4DE (205, 164, 222) Tropical Violet\n\n#AA55FF (170, 85, 255) Vega Violet\n\nAs you probably noticed our world is not enough for naming all the violet shades. We had to name one after Vega!\n\nViolet Shades Named after Flowers\n\nWe have already stated that color got its name after the flower named violet. Even more, the color named African Violet is named after the flower with the same name. And so on. To avoid complications, we’ll just continue with the violet shades named after flowers.\n\n#B57EDC (181, 126, 220) Lavender\n\n#EE82EE (238, 130, 238) Lavender Violet\n\n#D8BFD8 (216, 191, 216) Thistle\n\n#8D4687 (141, 70, 135) Hyacinth Violet\n\n#C9A0DC (201, 160, 220) Wisteria\n\nLavender is known in so many different shades that the creation of a whole family of lavender colors is necessary.

This accidentally made dye is also called Aniline Purple, Purple Aniline, Perkin’s Mauve, or Perkin’s Mallow.\n\nViolet Fruits\n\nViolet fruits are relatively rare. We (and other fruit eaters) tend to associate blueish hues with decay. But we still got a few to show.\n\n#6F2DA8 (111, 45, 168) Grape\n\n#764663 (118, 70, 99) Crushed Grape\n\n#58427C (88, 66, 124) Cyber Grape Purple\n\n#410056 (65, 0, 86) Ripe Plum\n\n#DDA0DD (221, 160, 221) Plum\n\n#C54B8C (197, 75, 140) Mulberry\n\n#D05FAD (208, 95, 173) Hopbush\n\n#705160 (112, 81, 96) Kalamata\n\n#311432 (49, 20, 50) Eggplant\n\n#540E32 (84, 14, 50) Black Currant\n\nFood and Drink of Different Violet Shades\n\n#290916 (41, 9, 22) Raisin\n\n#2C041C (44, 4, 28) Wine\n\n#4D0F28 (77, 15, 40) Sangria\n\n#9A2CA0 (154, 44, 160) Pizza Edge\n\n#8601BF (134, 1, 191) Violet Poison\n\nYes, you got it right, there is a color named after poison.

Maybe we’ll add more if there’s interest among our audience. This means it’s up to you, actually. Share this article with your friends and good things will happen. Bye.\n\nWelcome to the longest list of pink shades in the world. Here you’ll find 265 different pink colors with examples, their HTML (HEX) and RGB codes, and a lot of amusing tidbits about probably the most controversial color of all – the color pink.\n\nNumerous shades of pink can look pretty different than one might imagine, sometimes looking yellowish, reddish, grayish, or, of course purplish, often resembling pink only by their names.\n\nThis list of pink names is organized by groups with certain shared traits – by origin, by name, by association, … My intention when writing this article was not only to create a useful list for artists, designers, web developers, and other ‘professionals’, but to provide an interesting read in the form of a story. Your comments and suggestions are appreciated, and I encourage you to share this article with everybody who might be interested in pink color.\n\nTypes of Pink HEX Codes\n\nAs you probably already know different standards define pink differently. So we start with a few pinks but soon find out an addition to the name is necessary. Hence, we got the simple and best pink in the first group already.\n\n#FFC0CB (255, 192, 203) Pink\n\n#D74894 (215, 72, 148) Pink (Pantone)\n\n#CD919E (205, 145, 158) Pink (Crayola)\n\n#FABFCE (250, 191, 206) Simple Pink\n\n#FBCAE0 (251, 202, 224) Best Pink\n\nColor pink is well-known for its soothing effect, characteristic of all (not only pink) light and pastel colors. If want to calm down, you could find an answer in the next set of light pink colors.\n\nLight (Pastel) Pink Color Code\n\n#FFD1DC (255, 209, 220) Pastel Pink\n\n#FFB6C1 (255, 182, 193) Light Pink\n\n#FF5CCD (255, 92, 205) Light Deep Pink\n\n#FFB3DE (255, 179, 222) Light Hot Pink\n\n#F1ABB9 (241, 171, 185) Light Blush\n\nWhat is the difference between light, pastel, pale, and soft pink? We could open a semantic debate here but in reality, all these adjectives are used interchangeably. So when you search for a specific light shade of pink don’t forget to check soft, pale, pastel, etc. pinks as well.\n\nPale Pink Color Codes\n\n#F9CCCA (249, 204, 202) Pale Pink\n\n#EFCDDB (239, 205, 219) Pale Pink (RAL Design)\n\n#E6D0D8 (230, 208, 216) Soft Pale Pink\n\n#FDDDE6 (253, 221, 230) Soft Pink\n\n#F2D8CD (242, 216, 205) Soft Pink (Pantone)\n\nAs you can see even if we limit our exploration to pale and soft tones of pink, we deal with a huge amount of different hues with more or less blue or yellow helping to make the statement of the final color.\n\nSo it’s not surprising to find so many different light pink paints for walls as well.\n\n#F0DCE5 (240, 220, 229) Very Pale Pink\n\n#CEA9B8 (206, 169, 184) Pale Dusty Pink\n\n#F9DEDD (249, 222, 221) Pale Salmon Pink\n\n#DEC5D3 (222, 197, 211) Pale Rose Pink\n\n#F0D3D4 (240, 211, 212) Pale Lip\n\nThe family of pale pinks is finished with Pale Lip which immediately suggests mentioning lipsticks. Many of them are pretty pale, or, as is modern to say, natural, but the main point of lipsticks is to accent lips as one of the most romantic parts of the human body.\n\nSo stronger shades of pink for lipsticks are suggested!\n\nHot Pink HEX Code\n\n#FF80BF (255, 128, 191) Full Pink\n\n#F698BD (246, 152, 189) Supreme Pink\n\n#FF96D0 (255, 150, 208) Intense Pink\n\n#FF69B4 (255, 105, 180) Hot Pink\n\n#E7388A (231, 56, 138) Intense Hot Pink\n\nApparently, everybody wants to know the hot pink HEX code. But which one? All the hot pinks above are pretty similar, with a huge amount of red and a hint of blue. Such colors are very popular for lipsticks because they combine energy and sensuality. The hot pink color in its many variations is very likely the most controversial color of all. Either you love it or you can’t stand it. It’s very hard to find a neutral way for it.\n\n#CF6BA9 (207, 107, 169) Super Pink\n\n#E75480 (231, 84, 128) Dark Pink\n\n#FF1493 (255, 20, 147) Deep Pink\n\n#FF007F (255, 0, 127) Bright Pink\n\n#FF6FFF (255, 111, 255) Ultra Pink\n\nDark and deep shades of pink are in most cases on the edge of purple and violet colors, so it’s good to know there is no clear and unequivocal way to tell if a certain color belongs among the shades of pink or maybe in the family of violets of purple colors. Sometimes even the name misleads – some pinkish tones have red instead of pink in the name and some colors with names with pink don’t look pink at all (or at least not until you use a lot of imagination).\n\n#893843 (137, 56, 67) Solid Pink\n\n#FB607F (251, 96, 127) Brink Pink\n\n#EB94B7 (235, 148, 183) Cosmic Pink\n\n#DD95B4 (221, 149, 180) Techno Pink\n\n#FF1493 (255, 20, 147) Fluorescent Pink\n\nWe are not over yet! The next section is devoted to even more energetic and living shades of pink, which clearly suggests their names too!\n\n#F35A91 (243, 90, 145) Action Pink\n\n#FC0FC0 (252, 15, 192) Shocking Pink\n\n#FF6FFF (255, 111, 255) Shocking Pink (Crayola)\n\n#E3256B (227, 37, 107) Razzmatazz\n\n#FF3EA5 (255, 62, 165) Knockout Pink\n\nThis group of lively pinks is all about action. It’s hard to imagine being surrounded by so energetic shades of pink but we can definitely use most of them as part of the decor at parties or in amusement parks.\n\nReady for more?\n\n#EF5097 (239, 80, 151) Sport Pink\n\n#DE8DAE (222, 141, 174) Sassy Pink\n\n#F36097 (243, 96, 151) Youthful Pink\n\n#D66A8A (214, 106, 138) Livid Pink\n\n#E977B5 (233, 119, 181) Party Pink\n\nWe could continue with more groups of envigorating pink shades but it’s time to take a break. Well, before that, one of the most aggressive pinks (and in general most screaming colors in the universe) should be presented: neon pink with its HEX and RGB codes.\n\nNeon Pink Color Code\n\nI don’t know if this is good or bad news for you but neon pink is used as the name of numerous pink hues. You see, in the world of colors there is no definite global standard like there is in measuring weight or length, so every designer suggests his or her vision of a specific color as he or she perceives it.\n\nNeon pink is one such color where we can find at least a dozen different standards and different HTML codes for the same name. It’s up to you to pick the most suitable one for your project.\n\n#FF10F0 (255, 16, 240) Neon Pink (htmlcolorcodes.com)\n\n#FB48C4 (251,72,196) Neon Pink (colorcodes.io)\n\n#F535AA (245, 53, 170) Neon Pink (computerhope.com)\n\n#FE019A (254, 1, 154) Neon Pink (icolorpalette.com)\n\n#FF44CC (255, 68, 204) Neon Pink (color-name.com)\n\nPink Shades with Other Colors in Their Names\n\nBeing on the indefinite line between red and white with so many possible additions of other primary colors, we can expect several names of pink shades where pink is combined with another color. In this case, when pink (red + white) is paired with another color (yellow and/or blue), the tones of pink are called off pink.\n\nWhen somebody asks you what color is off pink you can answer that any pink with addition of one or two other primary colors. We can also call them pinkish colors. Here are a few examples for you.\n\n#FBA0AC (251, 160, 172) Pinkish Red\n\n#E2718D (226, 113, 141) Red Pink\n\n#EC3B83 (236, 59, 131) Cerise Pink\n\n#DA3287 (218, 50, 135) Deep Cerise Pink\n\n#D10056 (209, 0, 86) Reddish Pink aka Rubine Red\n\nAll the pinks above are intensely red, so red (or red shades) is an expected part of the name. A lot of red (and some yellow and blue) leads to brown.\n\n#F56991 (245, 105, 145) Light Crimson\n\n#EF3038 (239, 48, 56) Deep Carmine Pink\n\n#E66771 (230, 103, 113) Light Carmine Pink\n\n#C08081 (192, 128, 129) Brownish Pink\n\n#643941 (100, 57, 65) Pinkish Brown\n\nWe came from reddish to more and more intensely brownish tones of pink. The last two actually have pink only in their names, so dark and muted they are. But we are not over yet. Here is another group of pink shades with other colors in their names.\n\n#DBC3BE (219, 195, 190) Pink Ivory\n\n#D2A1CC (210, 161, 204) Lilac Pink\n\n#E18E96 (225, 142, 150) Ruddy Pink\n\n#B5A3C5 (181, 163, 197) Blue Pink\n\n#A38BA4 (163, 139, 164) Purplish Pink\n\nAnother question you may ask is about the difference between some of the above-presented pink shades and magenta. Yes, we got an answer, but you might not like it.\n\nThe name magenta is not limited to one color only. Here are a few examples:\n\n#FF00FF (255, 0, 255) Magenta\n\n#F653A6 (246, 83, 166) Magenta Crayola\n\n#D0417E (208, 65, 126) Magenta Pantone\n\n#CA1F7B (202, 31, 123) Magenta Dye\n\n#FF1DCE (255, 29, 206) Hot Magenta\n\nIs magenta the same as pink? Yes and no. While pink necessarily consists of red and white, magenta needs blue as well. If you add some blue to pink, it’s still pink until it strays into a purple area. On the other hand, if you take blue out of magenta, it will lose its name and become one of numerous shades of pink.\n\nSo – when you are asked what is difference between pink and magenta, the correct answer is: every magenta belongs to the pink family, but not all pinks belong among magentas.\n\n#CF71AF (207, 113, 175) Sky Magenta\n\n#97395D (57, 151, 68) Quinacridone Magenta\n\n#9F4576 (159, 69, 118) Magenta Haze\n\n#FF0090 (255, 0, 144) Magenta Process\n\n#CF3476 (207, 52, 118) Telemagenta\n\nMagenta can be also included in the family of purple or violet shades (which, by the way, are not the same!) but to conclude this: Magenta is a shade of pink with a decent amount of blue (and magenta in its name).\n\nIf you are still not sure, just check the inscription on the label on the box.\n\nPink Colors Named After Countries\n\nYou got it right. Pink is so popular several countries share their names with this controversial color. And they are spread all over the world.\n\n#F7BFBE (247, 191, 190) Spanish Pink\n\n#FD6C9E (253, 108, 158) French Pink\n\n#F88379 (248, 131, 121) Congo Pink oranzna\n\n#F77FBE (247, 127, 190) Persian Pink\n\n#DE6FA1 (222, 111, 161) China Pink\n\nWe cruised Europe, Africa, and part of Asia, so it’s only fair to make a short trip to America too.\n\n#EC9AA3 (236, 154, 163) Japanese Pink\n\n#FA1A8E (250, 26, 142) Philippine Pink\n\n#FF9899 (255, 152, 153) American Pink\n\n#E4007C (228, 0, 124) Mexican Pink aka Mexican Rose\n\n#E8C3BA (232, 195, 186) Chilean Pink\n\nWe went around the world with pinks, yet we still need to mention at least a few more cities intertwined with shades of pink.\n\n#D7837F (215, 131, 127) New York Pink\n\n#F400A1 (244, 0, 161) Hollywood Cerise\n\n#D95D67 (217, 93, 103) Milano Pink\n\n#D9BFC5 (217, 191, 197) Venetian Pink\n\n#C07B9A (192, 123, 154) Dark Venetian Pink\n\nThere is more, of course. One day we might add a few more related (by name) hues but to make this article publishable as soon as possible, let’s put a few dozen of already discovered pinks aside and move on – to the largest (by far!) group of pink shades.\n\nPink Flowers\n\nFirst things first – pink got its name after flowers, not vice versa. Flowers were blooming and being beautiful and colorful way before humans decided to name colors. Only after that, new and new names were needed (due to our excessive dependence on communication) and different flowers became parts of more or less official names of pink colors.\n\n#FDCDDD (253, 205, 221) Flower Pink\n\n#E96A97 (233, 106, 151) Azalea Pink\n\n#F19CBB (241, 156, 187) Amaranth Pink\n\n#DBB2D1 (219, 178, 209) Pink Lavender\n\n#FBAED2 (251, 174, 210) Lavender Pink\n\nYes, you got it right. Apparently, there is a difference between lavender pink and pink lavender. And lavender, by the way, is also a group of colors on its own. But let’s not stray from the subject and continue with more of the flowery pink tones.\n\n#FFA6C9 (255, 166, 201) Carnation Pink\n\n#F56FA1 (245, 111, 161) Cyclamen\n\n#CD9BC4 (205, 155, 196) Clover Pink\n\n#F6909D (246, 144, 157) Geranium Pink\n\n#CA99B7 (202, 153, 183) Morning Glory Pink\n\nPink is one of the species (Dianthus plumarius) in the family Caryophyllaceae. Yet flowers are not the only species with pink blooms. Trees can have pink blossoms too. The same is true for aquatic plants like the lotus.\n\n#F3D1DD (243, 209, 221) Light Pink Peony\n\n#F6ADC6 (246, 173, 198) Nadeshiko Pink\n\n#E0D2D1 (224, 210, 209) Almond Blossom Pink\n\n#FFB7C5 (255, 183, 197) Cherry Blossom Pink\n\n#EAD0D6 (234, 208, 214) Lotus Pink (RAL Design)\n\nPink Orchids\n\nOrchids are the second most popular group of flowers (after roses, of course). Here are several pink shades named after orchids.\n\n#F2BDCD (242, 189, 205) Orchid Pink\n\n#D198C5 (209, 152, 197) Orchid (Pantone)\n\n#D470A2 (212, 112, 162) Wild Orchid\n\n#E5BDB5 (229, 189, 181) Orchid Pink (British Standard)\n\n#E29CD2 (226, 156, 210) Orchid (Crayola)\n\nFuchsia Pink Colors\n\nFuchsia is another flower with pink blossoms. Its color is so distinctive and popular, a whole group of colors is actually named after fuchsia and one day we may provide a special article on fuchsia color only.\n\n#F984EF (249, 132, 239) Light Fuchsia Pink\n\n#FD3F92 (253, 63, 146) French Fuchsia\n\n#CC397B (204, 57, 123) Fuchsia Purplish Pink\n\n#F400A1 (244, 0, 161) Fashion Fuchsia Pink\n\n#FE4164 (254, 65, 100) Neon Fuchsia\n\nYes, we finally arrived at the roses. They may be pink and are enjoyed in numerous pink shades. Many languages derived the name for the pink color from the rose and just like we saw at fuchsia there is a whole group of rose colors. This article may be written some day too, but for now, we invite you to read the symbolism of the different colors of roses.\n\nShades of Pink Roses with Codes\n\n#C74375 (199, 67, 117) Fuchsia Rose\n\n#FF66CC (255, 102, 204) Rose Pink aka Rosy Pink\n\n#C08081 (192, 128, 129) Old Rose\n\n#FF5470 (255, 84, 112) Fiery Rose\n\n#FF33CC (255, 51, 204) Razzle Dazzle Rose\n\nRoses are so widespread many of them (several hundred species with thousands of hybrids) got names after countries, so we made a group of rose pink colors with country names.\n\n#FF033E (255, 3, 62) American Rose\n\n#A8516E (168, 81, 110) China Rose\n\n#FE28A2 (254, 40, 162) Persian Rose\n\n#F64A8A (246, 74, 138) French Rose\n\n#B57281 (181, 114, 129) Turkish Rose\n\nThe last group of rose pink shades provides some interesting combinations (salmon rose should be a surprise for most of us, right?), and here they are with examples and HTML codes.\n\n#FBA0E3 (251, 160, 227) Lavender Rose\n\n#F4C2C2 (244, 194, 194) Tea Rose\n\n#B3446C (179, 68, 108) Raspberry Rose\n\n#E7968B (231, 150, 139) Salmon Rose\n\n#FFE4E1 (255, 228, 225) Misty Rose\n\nFrom roses, we continue to bushes and trees with pinkish blossoms or wood.\n\n#D71868 (215, 24, 104) Dogwood Rose\n\n#EDCDC2 (237, 205, 194) Pale Dogwood\n\n#F5D3D4 (245, 211, 212) Pink Dogwood (Pantone)\n\n#A45A52 (164, 90, 82) Redwood\n\n#9E4244 (158, 66, 68) Rosewood\n\nWe are almost finished with plants related to pink shades but can’t skip fruits. Here are three groups of pinks named after fruits.\n\nPink Fruit\n\n#E30B5D (227, 11, 93) Raspberry\n\n#E8888A (232, 136, 138) Strawberry\n\n#FF43A4 (255, 67, 164) Wild Strawberry\n\n#C54B8C (197, 75, 140) Mulberry\n\n#C8509B (200, 80, 155) Mulberry Crayola\n\nBerries are very thankful when we try to find pinkish shades related to fruits. They are lively, somehow fragile, and tender at the same time. The next group is a bit more robust. Of course, they belong to the pink family too.\n\n#FADCD6 (250, 220, 214) Apricot Pink\n\n#FAD1AF (250, 209, 175) Peach\n\n#FFC5BD (255, 197, 189) Peachy Pink\n\n#FC6C85 (252, 108, 133) Watermelon\n\n#F7BCAC (247, 188, 172) Melon\n\nWe already mentioned cerise which means cherry in French. Well, it looks like we have the Cerise Pink and Cherry Pink among the shades of pink and now you can compare both. You’ll be the judge which suits your perception of cherry pink.\n\n#DE3163 (222, 49, 99) Cerise\n\n#E26F8F (226, 111, 143) Cherry Pink\n\n#E0707C (224, 112, 124) Grapefruit Pink\n\n#AD4379 (173, 67, 121) Mystic Maroon\n\n#915F6D (145, 95, 109) Raspberry Glace\n\nFruit is so popular thanks to its attractive colors and taste. Speaking of taste, pink plays an important part in the food area – especially sweets are closely associated with this sweet color.\n\nE4717A (228, 113, 122) Candy Pink\n\nFFBCD9 (255, 188, 217) Cotton Candy\n\nF9429E (249, 66, 158) Rose Bonbon\n\nF58092 (245, 128, 146) Bubblegum Pink\n\nFA86C4 (250, 134, 196) Taffy\n\nFeeling hungry already? If Candy Pink, Bubblegum Pink, and Rose Bonbon (now you know the difference!) don’t satisfy your taste, you probably need something more caloric.\n\nPink Foods\n\n#F89883 (248, 152, 131) Crepe\n\n#E9C3CF (233, 195, 207) Parfait Pink\n\n#D3507A (211, 80, 122) Pink Flambe\n\n#A50B5E (165, 11, 94) Jazzberry Jam\n\n#EAAEA9 (234, 174, 169) Sweet Tart\n\nThe pink color is obviously more than the appropriate color for sweets. There is even a shade of pink called Sweet Pink. Well, here we are again – different designers perceive this particular shade in different ways, so we provide a few examples of Sweet Pink with RGB and HEX values, together with their closest relative Sweetest Pink.\n\n#FD9FA2 (253, 159, 162) artyclick.com\n\n#EE918D (238, 145, 141) colorcodes.io\n\n#F4BCE1 (244, 188, 225) color-name.com\n\n#EE918D (238, 145, 141) crispedge.com\n\n#FBCEE7 (251, 206, 231) Sweetest Pink\n\nAfter so many sweets some drink would be nice. There are several drinks known for their pink colors, so here is a few of them.\n\nPink Drinks\n\nF25278 (242, 82, 120) Punch\n\nF2DBE7 (242, 219, 231) Lemonade Pink\n\nF78FA7 (247, 143, 167) Pink Sherbet\n\nF38FA9 (243, 143, 169) Vanilla Ice\n\nD9463E (217, 70, 62) Strawberry Daiquiri\n\nThe most popular pinkish color is champagne pink which gives us another opportunity to check how designers see Champagne Pink. And yes, there is also Pink Champagne, so you can have even more choices.\n\nChampagne Pink\n\nYou guessed it – again each web designer percieves champagne pink color a bit differently.\n\n#F7E7CE (247, 231, 206) canva.com\n\n#F8DECD (248, 222, 205) color-name-com\n\n#F1DDCF (241, 221, 207) encycolorpedia.com\n\n#F6E1D3 (246, 225, 211) colorcodes.io\n\n#F0D8CC (240, 216, 204) Pink Champagne (Pantone)\n\nWhile the pink drinks mostly look soft and gentle, the world of animals offers some pretty powerful pink shades.\n\nPink Animals\n\nDid you know a flamingo’s color depends on food? When captured they tend to become white, so food additives are a must in ZOO. At first, caught birds were fed with paprika but now synthetic additives became a standard.\n\n#FDDDE6 (253, 221, 230) Piggy Pink\n\n#FC8EAC (252, 142, 172) Flamingo Pink\n\n#D998A0 (217, 152, 160) Parrot Pink\n\n#ECC4D5 (236, 196, 213) Pink Elephant\n\n#905D5D (144, 93, 93) Rose Taupe\n\nThe most well-known pink shade in this area is, of course, Flamingo Pink, which, again, varies, thanks to the eating possibilities of flamingos (they got the color of their feathers from food and this color inevitably changes from time to time). The other popular pink shade in the animal kingdom is the color of salmon.\n\n#FF9999 (255, 153, 153) Salmon aka Light Salmon Pink\n\n#E9967A (233, 150, 122) Dark Salmon\n\n#F0D8D8 (240, 216, 216) Oyster\n\n#CC8899 (204, 136, 153) Puce\n\n#F88379 (248, 131, 121) Coral Pink\n\nYes, coral pink deserves a few additional words. It could be treated as a shade of pink yet it belongs among orange colors too.\n\nWe are well-aware of versatility of this popular color so a special article about coral color is in our plan for near future.\n\nWe’ll also add some examples of pink animals later.\n\nHow about people? Are there any pink colors named after real folk? Yes, they are.\n\nPink Colors Named after People\n\n#ED7A9B (237, 122, 155) Rose Pompadour\n\n#997A8D (153, 122, 141) Mountbatten Pink aka Plymouth Pink vijolicna\n\n#FF91AF (255, 145, 175) Baker-Miller Pink aka P-618 aka Drunk-Tank Pink aka Schauss Pink\n\n#F2003C (242, 0, 60) Munsell Red\n\n#C154C1 (193, 84, 193) Fuchsia\n\nRose Pompadour got its name after the famous Madame de Pompadour (1721-1764), Mountbatten Pink after Lord Mountbatten (1900-1979), who used it during World War II, Gene Baker and Ron Miller were directors of the institute where Alexander Schauss studied the influence of specific pink shade on aggressive behavior, and Munsell Red is named after Albert Henry Munsell.\n\nWait a minute! And Fuchsia? Isn’t that pink shade named after the color of the flower fuchsia? Yes, it’s true. But the plant was named after botanist Leonard Fuchs!\n\n#F4C2C2 (244, 194, 194) Baby Pink\n\n#EABDD1 (234, 189, 209) Cherub Pink\n\n#EDD0DD (237, 208, 221) Cradle Pink\n\n#E8CCD7 (232, 204, 215) Queen Pink\n\n#A84860 (168, 72, 96) Hippie Pink\n\nPink is for centuries associated with everything young, playful, unserious, and sometimes extravagant.

Did you know, the first names for pink in Europe were actually words describing skin complexion? Of course, then the spectrum was not discovered yet. Artists and scientists believed pink is a shade of yellow, not red, so the transformation to the name, coming from flowers came much later.\n\nPink for Skin Complexion\n\nIf, for some reason, you need an HTML code for the color of human skin, here are a few ideas. Please note that the name of the color pink initially came from naming the complexion in countries with Caucasian people (Italy in the first place).\n\n#DDC0B4 (221, 192, 180) Nude Pink\n\n#A95C68 (169, 92, 104) Deep Pruce\n\n#DBAC98 (219, 172, 152) Lip Pink\n\n#BE9D9B (190, 157, 155) Pink Suede (Pantone)\n\n#D498B1 (212, 152, 177) Pink Leather\n\nAfter groups of shades of skin and related stuff intertwined with the color pink, textiles come into play. Being so delicate and versatile color, it’s expected to find pink here as well.\n\n#9C657E (156, 101, 126) Batik Pink\n\n#FFDDF4 (255, 221, 244) Pink Lace\n\n#F18AAD (241, 138, 173) Sachet Pink\n\n#EEBDC0 (238, 189, 192) Boho Pink\n\n#AA83A4 (170, 131, 164) Wilhelminian Pink\n\nBut let’s not confine ourselves to soft, gentle, and generally pretty stuff only. Pink shades can act strong too. The next section is devoted to proverbially strong elements – metals.\n\nMetals with Pink Tones?\n\n#B76E79 (183, 110, 121) Rose Gold\n\n#E6C7C2 (230, 199, 194) Gold Pink\n\n#C4AEAD (196, 174, 173) Silver Pink\n\n#DCB5B4 (220, 181, 180) Silvery Pink\n\n#996666 (153, 102, 102) Copper Rose\n\nAfter more or less precious metals, related to different pink shades, we can expand into less known characteristics of this versatile color. Of course, it’s generously present in the world of minerals and plays an important part in jewelry as well.\n\nLooking for Rose-Quartz Color?\n\n#EDA6C4 (237, 166, 196) Metallic Pink\n\n#CC33CC (204, 51, 204) Steel Pink\n\n#ED5B9A (237, 91, 154) Cobalt Pink\n\n#AA98A9 (170, 152, 169) Rose Quartz\n\n#BCA3AA (188, 163, 170) Quartz Pink\n\nSome of the most precious minerals are closely related to different pink shades.

Pearls can be pinkish, right? And pearls are made of mother-of-the-pearl. We found a few other minerals too.\n\n#E7ACCF (231, 172, 207) Pink Pearl\n\n#D1C4C6 (209, 196, 198) Mother-of-pearl Pink\n\n#960145 (150, 1, 69) Rose Garnet\n\n#FBD3D9 (251, 211, 217) Pink Fluorite\n\n#DFCDC6 (223, 205, 198) Morganite Pink\n\nWe are slowly approaching the end of the list of pink-colored minerals in this article. Some of them edge more on the red, others on the gray side.\n\n#9966CC (153, 102, 204) Amethyst Pink\n\n#C6A0AB (198, 160, 171) Opaline Pink\n\n#B3586C (179, 88, 108) Slate Pink\n\n#E8E1E6 (232, 225, 230) Apatite Pink\n\n#BD9E97 (189, 158, 151) Pink Granite\n\nOur final group is also related to minerals but not so admirable. Of course, we are looking at more earthly, even dusty substances.\n\nDusty Pink Color and Other Dirt Related Pinks\n\n#CA7B80 (202, 123, 128) Dirty Pink\n\n#D58A94 (213, 138, 148) Dusty Pink\n\n#CC4E5C (204, 78, 92) Dark Terra Cotta\n\n#C4B3B2 (196, 179, 178) Clay Pink\n\n#E5CCC9 (229, 204, 201) Dust Storm\n\nThis is the end of the longest list of names for pink shades with HEX codes ever made in one article on this planet. If traffic (by traffic, we mean you, dear visitor!) proves to be high and engaging, soon we could expand the list with additional pink colors. 265 pinks from today can someday rise to over 300!\n\nIf you find this material useful, don’t hesitate to share it on your social media, blogs, etc. Stay pink!\n\nAre you thinking about painting your interior pink? There are hundreds of quality pink paints on the market offering a wide range of pink shades we’ll going to explore in this article.\n\nAs you’ll see there are many bold and even showy pinks originally meant more as an accent than the full cover of the wall and there are also numerous calmer ones, sometimes only with a hint of pink paint colors among which you can find just perfect one for your room, no matter if it’s a living room or a study, for boys or girls, with full coverage or just for one of the walls in the room.\n\n20 popular shades of pink paint with examples\n\nHere are 80 different shades of pink paint produced by dozens of paint makers, all the major paint brands included. They are presented with HEX (HTML) and RGB codes, so you can imitate the desired effects on your computer or mobile screens before ending up with several gallons of paints of the wrong color.\n\nEnjoy the voyage and think pink!\n\nBlush Pink Paint\n\nThis is the stronger pink hue with a lot of red but also a significant percentage of green and blue (if we think of RGB standards), which leads to more orange or violet tones.\n\n#FA906C (250, 144, 108) Valspar Paint Pink Blush\n\n#F4CEE3 (244, 204, 227) Asian Paints Blush Pink\n\n#E56F65 (229, 111, 101) Valspar Paint Rose Blush\n\n#F1B4B2 (241, 180, 178) Valspar Paint Champagne Blush\n\n#C56E76 (197, 110, 118) Valspar Paint Brazilian Blush\n\nBlush pink paints can still stay true to the blush in their names if the end effect is less showy. Here are lighter tones of blush pinks which is obvious from their values of G and B). As you see, Valspar is a leading manufacturer in both ‘families’ of blush pinks.\n\n#FBC7D3 (251, 199, 211) Valspar Paint Velvety Blush\n\n#FBDBE0 (251, 219, 224) Valspar Paint Opal Blush\n\n#E7C1B5 (231, 193, 181) Behr Pink Blush RAH-47\n\n#F7EFEC (247, 239, 236) Valspar Paint Noble Blush\n\n#DAAFA3 (218, 175, 163) Frenchic Paint Dusky Blush\n\nHot Pink Paint\n\nIf you like bright, energetic colors, hot pink paint might be the right choice for you. Again, it might be too strong for the painting of the whole room but you have countless options to combine it with a white ceiling (all strong and medium pinks pair perfectly with white) or use it just for a few stripes in the area of your choice.\n\n#D5276A (213, 39, 106) ProMarker Hot Pink\n\n#FE00FE (254, 0, 254) FolkArt Bright Pink\n\n#F659A3 (246, 89, 163) FolkArt Hot Pink\n\n#BF536C (191, 83, 108) Taubmans Hot Pink / Bristol Hot Pink\n\n#CE5171 (206, 81, 113) Porter Paints Hot Pink Kiss / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Hot Pink Kiss\n\nWe are not done yet. More bright pink paints can be explored below. As you see, the perception of hot or bright by manufacturers varies from classic magenta to brown on one and baby pink on the other side.\n\nBright Pink Paint\n\nAB4673 (171, 70, 115) Behr Hot Pink\n\n77374C (119, 55, 76) Earthpaint Hot Pink\n\nF8C0CE (248, 192, 206) FolkArt Bright Baby Pink\n\nFF78CB (255, 120, 203) Crayola Hot Pink\n\nEEBFCE (238, 191, 206) Devoe Paint Hot Pink\n\nPlease note that bright and hot are perceived as petty much the same in the industry.\n\nCandy Pink Paint\n\nWe still have a plethora of lively and energetic pinks to check, yet not necessarily so intensive colors as above. Candy pink paints took their names from pinkish-colored candies which immediately bring memories of amusement parks, garden parties, and other carefree moments of pure happiness.\n\n#9B4469 (155, 68, 105) Bentley Candy Pink\n\n#EA848F (234, 132, 143) Taubmans Candy Pink / Bristol Candy Pink\n\n#F5919D (245, 145, 157) Apple Barrel Candy Pink\n\n#D69495 (246, 148, 149) Asian Paints Pink Candy\n\n#D8BAC5 (216, 186, 197) Valspar Paint Candy\n\nWhile pink color doesn’t necessarily suit everybody we can’t deny such lively shades are a guarantee against boredom. So let’s compare another set of candy pink paints.\n\n#F7BEBD (247, 190, 189) Devoe Paint Cotton Candy Pink\n\n#F3BEC3 (243, 190, 195) CIL Cotton Candy Pink\n\n#F8DCC6 (248, 220, 190) Albany Paint Candy\n\n#F1E7E6 (241, 231, 230) New Look Pink Candy\n\n#FFCDC7 (255, 205, 199) Valspar Paint Candy Hearts\n\nMetallic / Neon Pink Paint\n\nMetallic paints are so aggressive they are in most cases used only as an addition to other paints to achieve some specific effect. They are also a valuable addition to areas in theme parks and similar entertainment venues. Metallic pink and neon pink belong to the same family with very intensive red with a flashy look which, as already said is not always used as it is, but added to other paints to create custom colors.\n\nOr, if you want, you can make only a vertical strike with one of the presented neon pink paints somewhere close to the top of the otherwise pale-colored wall.\n\nPink Flamingo Paint\n\nFlamingoes symbolize beauty, grace, and romance. The birds got their characteristic color of feathers from carotenoids produced by algae, the main staple of brine shrimps which are the main source of food for flamingoes.\n\n#F87F92 (248, 127, 146) Duron Pink Flamingo\n\n#D67C99 (214, 124, 153) CIL Flamingo Pink\n\n#CD717B (205, 113, 123) Sherwin-Williams Pink Flamingo\n\n#D97C94 (217, 124, 148) Devoe Paint Flamingo Pink\n\n#C77D7E (199, 125, 126) Behr Pink Flamingo\n\nDepending on the percentage of carotenoids, the balance of diet of specific flamingos, and of course other factors, the color may vary from intensive orange or red to relatively pale pink.\n\nPink flamingoes are another story. A decorative idea of a plastic pink flamingo as a lawn ornament is today closely associated with Florida yet it comes from Leominster, Massachusetts, the self-proclaimed plastic capital of the world. Some love it, some hate it, just like the color pink. But like it or not, it’s iconic and part of our cultural history.\n\nLight Pink Paint\n\nLighter shades of pink paint are way more popular for painting walls than stronger hues. So we should not be surprised to find even more options of interior paints in light pink to choose from.\n\n#F2DBDE (242, 219, 222) Valspar Paint Light Pink\n\n#FAB4D8 (250, 180, 216) Apple Barrel Light Pink / 20535\n\n#FABFBF (250, 191, 191) Apple Barrel Light Pink / 44844E\n\n#FFCDD8 (255, 205, 216) Benjamin Moore Light Chiffon Pink\n\n#FFE1E2 (255, 225, 226) California Paints Pristine Pink\n\nAs you can see above, Apple Barrel offers two paints with the same name differing by the numbers at the end of the name.\n\nLighter shades of pink are easily accentuated with subtones of yellow to enliven the space or greyish additions which make the areas calmer. Alone or in a variety of combinations these paints can be used for interiors and exteriors, virtually for every place you might want to paint.\n\nAnd often they don’t even look pink!\n\nF5E4DE (245, 228, 222) Dunn-Edwards Faded Light / California Paints Faded Light\n\nFBD0D8 (251, 208, 216) Delta Hydrangea Pink\n\nF4B8B7 (244, 184, 183) Diamond Paint Teenage Pink\n\nFFF1E8 (255, 241, 232) Diamond Paint Princess Pink\n\nF2D3D0 (242, 211, 208) Dutch Boy Pink Buds\n\nBefore we continue with more soft tones of pink, it’s good to know, we created a dedicated article about light pink paint so you can find even more examples of this popular color.\n\nPale Pink Paint\n\nAs the name suggests, we are dealing with calm colors, suitable for living places, where you can hang out with friends, eat meals, study, exercise, or rest, just about everything you might imagine.\n\n#FEDCE7 (254, 220, 231) ProMarker Pale Pink\n\n#EDD1C2 (237, 209, 194) Dulux Australia Pale Pink\n\n#F7D7CC (247, 215, 204) Benjamin Moore Pale Pink Satin\n\n#FCE2D5 (252, 226, 213) Taubmans Pale Petal Pink\n\n#F9E9E6 (249, 233, 230) Vista Paint Pale Perfection\n\nPale pinks are another popular choice for a variety of interiors and there are many great options on the market.\n\nDusty Pink Paint\n\nWe are still not over with lighter shades of pink paint. The industry interchangeably uses names dusty and dusky pinks which means we have a whole family of lighter pinkish paints with greyish addition which makes the end result on the wall very peaceful with a typical matte finish.\n\n#D5A7A9 (213, 167, 169) Sears Dusty Pink\n\n#DCC3BB (220, 195, 187) Sherwin Williams Dusty Pink\n\n#E6D2C9 (230, 210, 201) Valspar Dusty Pink\n\n#E9D9CA (233, 217, 202) Duron Dusty Pink\n\n#C19B94 (193, 155, 148) Olympic Dusty Rose\n\nWell, see for yourself: dusty (above) or dusky (below)? Compare both and try to find a general rule for each of the groups.\n\nD09C9D (208, 156, 157) Sears Dusty Rose\n\nFDDDC6 (253, 221, 198) ProMarker Dusky Pink\n\nDAAFA3 (218, 175, 163) Frenchic Paint Dusky Blush\n\nE5D5CE (229, 2013, 206) Valspar Paint Dusky Sand\n\nD6C5C4 (214, 197, 196) Valspar Paint Dusky Twilight\n\nGreyish Pink Paints\n\nThe family of greyish pinks is always in demand yet there is currently no paint on the market bearing such a name. So we choose from the numerous options and create a group of five typical greyish-pink paints where you can start from.\n\n#F7E7D8 (247, 231, 216) Kansai Paint Cool Pink\n\n#EBECED (235, 236, 237) Kansai Paint Pink Voilet\n\n#FFC6C2 (255, 198, 194) Diamond Paint Teenage Pink\n\n#FDEAE4 (253, 234, 228) Benjamin Moore Soft Pink\n\n#EFE7EA (239, 231, 234) Sico Soft Pink Blush\n\nCoral Pink Paint\n\nCoral is another iffy color. Should we treat it as orange or pink? Maybe even a subfamily of red? Anyways, the paint manufacturers offer several paints with the color pink in their names, and here is an example for you.\n\n#EBCCCF (235, 204, 207) Colortrend / Diamond Vogel Pink Coral / ECOS Paints Pink Coral\n\n#CB665B (203, 102, 91) Earthpaint 2-3-6 Coral Pink\n\n#E7ACA9 (231, 172, 169) Pratt & Lambert Coral Pink\n\n#F9ABBA (249, 171, 186) Benjamin Moore Coral Pink\n\n#F6B695 (246, 182, 149) Martin Senour Paints Coral Pink\n\nIf you found this information useful or believe it could be interesting to somebody else, please share it with others. Stay in pink!\n\nBrown Color Names – 130 Shades with HEX and RGB Values\n\nThe color brown is the least popular color of all. There are many reasons for that and being so ordinary is probably the most obvious. Formally, it’s a tertiary color which means we can make it by mixing all three primary colors: yellow, red, and blue. Or, if we stay in RGB model: red and green.\n\nWhile it’s very hard to find a person who will declare brown as his or her favorite color, we still can’t do without it. After all, brown, the color of the earth, is the most natural of all colors in the world. Depending on the shade, there are numerous (more than a thousand!) brown colors that can be mixed with different degrees of red, yellow, and blue with the addition of white or black to doctor the tint.\n\nIt’s our mission to present this interesting color which is unjustly omitted from the company logos and other graphics meant to attract our intention and sympathies. At the moment there are 130 different colors of brown sorted by logical groups, depending on their names and origins. We already have more than 100 additional shades waiting to be processed by our designers and introduced to the world.\n\nEnjoy the already-shown brown colors and stay tuned for more!\n\nColor Brown with values by different standards\n\nWhat, exactly, is perceived as color brown?\n\n#964B00 (150, 75, 0) Brown\n\n#993300 (153,51,0) Brown (Web Safe)\n\n#794E3E (121, 77, 62) Brown (RAL)\n\n#AF593E (175, 89, 62) Brown (Crayola)\n\n#3A1F04 (58, 31, 4) Brunette\n\nAs you can see, our perception of ‘perfect’ brown differs from one standard to another. So we have many colors with a simple name: brown. Yes, brunette means brown in French. It’s up to you which of the browns above you’ll perceive as yours truly brown.\n\nDark Brown Colors\n\nWhen we say brown, our first image is probably one of the darker tones. We’ll see many of them, her is just an example of five dark brown shades with the name directly insinuating they are dark.\n\n#5C4033 (92, 64, 51) Dark Brown\n\n#654321 (101, 67, 33) Dark Brown (color-meanings)\n\n#410200 (65, 2, 0) Deep Brown\n\n#73624A (115, 98, 74) Heavy Brown\n\n#403330 (64, 51, 48) Night Brown\n\nDespite the fact it’s always a strong, authoritative tone, dark brown can be very warm and comforting, which depends on the used red in the mixture. These colors are among the most used hair dyes.\n\nLighter Colors of Brown\n\nThe light brown color is also widespread in nature. It’s the color of several wood types, different fruits of nature, types of wheat, …\n\n#7F5112 (127, 81, 18) Medium Brown\n\n#876E4B (135, 110, 75) Dull Brown\n\n#B7825F (183, 130, 95) Soft Brown\n\n#B5651D (181, 101, 29) Light Brown\n\n#B1907F (177, 144, 127) Pastel Brown\n\nIf you compare the codes for darker and lighter shades of brown, you’ll see the values of red and green are significantly higher, while the values for blue are also higher but not to the same extent. Most of the colors above are warm and easy on the eye which makes them a popular choice for coloring the elements of our homes, like walls, or everyday lives, like cloth.\n\nWe’ll find many more lighter tones of brown a bit later.\n\nBrown Color Names, Combined with Other Colors\n\nNext set of names is a bit iffy yet we’ll present them anyway.\n\n#A52A2A (51, 24, 0) Red-Brown\n\n#34080E (52, 8, 14) Scarlet Brown\n\n#BC8F8F (188, 143, 143) Rosy Brown\n\n#C27E79 (194,126,121) Pinkish Brown\n\n#9E4638 (158, 70, 56) Coral Brown\n\nWe already know the importance of the percentage of each primary color in the mix leading to brown color. Often one of the primaries dominates what can lead to the name. Yet, it’s good to know, there are many standards for naming the colors, so you’ll very likely find two colors with the same name but different HEX codes or with the same color values but totally different names.\n\n#B16002 (177, 96, 2) Orange Brown\n\n#996515 (153, 101, 21) Golden Brown\n\n#696112 (105, 97, 18) Greenish Brown\n\n#7F7053 (127, 112, 83) Gray Brown\n\n#7A6A4F (122, 106, 79) Grayish Brown\n\nDue to its warmth and energy orange-brown color above is one of the most popular brown shades. It’s used especially as a hair color and as a color of smaller elements of living rooms.\n\n#922B05 (146, 43, 5) Brown Red\n\n#8D8468 (141, 132, 104) Brown Gray\n\n#565044 (86, 80, 68) Brown Gray (RAL)\n\n#AB814F (171, 129, 79) Brown Beige\n\n#DFD0C0 (223, 208, 192) Brown Cream\n\nThis set of names is still made of combinations with other colors but with the other color as the second in the name. Gray, in all its variations, is the most frequent in this case. We can actually play with different tones of brown just adding a bit of white or black, creating dozens of interesting results suitable for our projects.\n\n#86775F (134, 119, 95) Brownish Gray\n\n#9E3623 (158, 54, 35) Brownish Red\n\n#7B403B (123, 64, 59) Brownish Red (Eggradients)\n\n#76424E (118, 66, 78) Brownish Purple\n\n#B05F03 ((176, 95, 3) Brownish Orange\n\nThe family of brown colors named as combinations with other colors ends with a set of brownish colors with their codes. We can look at them as primary or secondary colors with an addition of brown (in practice this means an addition of some other primary or secondary), but they are still all brown colors by definition.\n\nBrown Color Names Related to Plants\n\nMany elements of plants are brown. Wood is probably the first association coming to one’s mind. Here is a set of five shades of wood brown color to start.\n\n#C19A6B (193, 154, 107) Wood Brown\n\n#402F1D (64, 47, 29) Wood Brown (Louisem)\n\n#855E42 (133, 94, 66) Dark Wood\n\n#DEB887 (222, 184, 135) Burlywood\n\n#CEBAA8 (206, 186, 168) Firewood\n\nAs we see, something seemingly as simple as a wood color code can already provide a challenge to the designer. There are so many shades available, we definitely need more data, than just the name. And this is just the beginning.\n\nTan Color Codes\n\nTan is a very light shade of brown. The name comes from the Latin tannum, which means oak bark. Oak bark was traditionally used for tanning leather. As you’ll see even this specific shade of brown can be derived in more ‘sub-shades’.\n\n#D2B48C (210, 180, 140) Tan\n\n#988558 (152, 133, 88) Dark Tan\n\n#A75502 (167, 85, 2) Windsor Tan\n\n#C4915E (196,145,94) Mid Tan\n\n#ECDEC9 (236, 222, 201) Light Tan\n\nTan has several synonyms: tawny, fulvous, tenne. As expected, we can find even more shades of tan in this family. Compare them and try to spot a difference between both Pantone Tawny Brown colors. They also share their names with only one letter being different. Looking at their RGB codes, it’s obvious the shares of red and green are very close in both cases with the percentage of blue being only slightly more different.\n\n#CD5700 (205, 87, 0) Tawny\n\n#A9836F (171, 133, 111) Tawny Brown Pantone / PMS 17-1226 TPG\n\n#A9836A (169, 131, 106) Tawny Brown Pantone / PMS 17-1226 TPX\n\n#E48400 (228,132,0) Fulvous\n\n#97572B (151,87,43) Leather Brown\n\nFor good measure, we also added the color Leather Brown, which is directly related to tan and tanning.\n\nLet’s continue with more tones of brown, related to wood.\n\n#C04000 (192, 64, 0) Mahogany\n\n#806517 (128, 101, 23) Oak Brown\n\n#4B3A26 (75, 58, 38) Cedar\n\n#351E10 (53, 30, 16) Hickory\n\n#645452 (100, 84, 82) Wenge\n\nAbove you can compare different shades of brown, associated with specific types of trees. Wenge is probably the most exotic among them. Yet, if you got seriously involved in buying furniture, this dark brown shade will probably pop up very soon. Originally, it’s the name of a very dark brown, almost black wood of a sort of tree (Millettia laurentii) growing in West Africa. Yet we can also compare this color with Cedar and Hickory which are even daker.\n\n#996633 (153, 102, 51) Bark\n\n#79443B (121, 68, 59) Bole\n\n#AC9464 (172, 148, 100) Teak\n\n#C8B560 (200,181,96) Fall Leaf Brown\n\n#E2C28E (226, 194, 142) Birdseed\n\nDifferent Shades of Brown Names Related to Fruits\n\nA huge family of chestnuts brings some of the most popular shades of warm dark brown colors, especially in demand for hair dying. While it’s interesting to compare colors of chestnut and maroon (very close in a botanical sense, but not the same), it’s probably intriguing to compare both with other fruits.\n\nIf you want to find even more colors named after chestnut and maroon, check the article about red shades.\n\n#954535 (149, 69, 53) Chestnut\n\n#986960 (152, 105, 96) Dark Chestnut\n\n#800000 (128, 0, 0) Maroon\n\n#713930 (113, 57, 48) Raisin Brown\n\n#965A3E (150, 90, 62) Coconut\n\nIn contrast, we have also choose two extremes: very small fruit such as a raisin (dry grape) and huge coconut. But this is not all. Many more brown fruits can be found in nature and some of them are presented below together with HTML (HEX) codes and RGB values.\n\n#D7A98C (215, 169, 140) Acorn\n\n#5C5248 (92, 82, 72) Walnut Brown\n\n#EFDECD (239, 222, 205) Almond\n\n#FFEBCD (255, 235, 205) Blanched Almond\n\n#B0724A (176, 114, 74) Burnt Almond\n\nAlmond is another great example of how the naming of brown shades very fast becomes complex and in many cases too demanding even for color experts. Even if we find a consensus on the sort of almond in a specific phase of maturity, we will very likely sooner or later make some kind of impact on it. In the case of almonds, we treat them with heat, of course.\n\n#5B3A29 (91, 58, 41) Hazelnut Brown\n\n#D2691E (210, 105, 30) Cocoa Brown\n\n#48260D (72, 38, 13) Pecan\n\n#795C32 (121, 92, 50) Peanut\n\n#AF642B (175, 100, 43) Date Fruit Brown\n\nFamily of Brown Food-Related Shades\n\nNature is loaded with edible products and already-presented fruits (many of them being brown or at least brownish!) are a great start to dive into samples of colors, closely associated with foods.\n\nWe have already mentioned cocoa. So why don’t we start with chocolate?\n\nOr shall we say chocolates?\n\n#7B3F00 (123, 63, 0) Chocolate\n\n#9E5B40 (158, 91, 64) Bitter Chocolate\n\n#352620 (53, 38, 32) Dark Chocolate\n\n#A86E53(168, 110, 83) Milk Chocolate\n\n#EDE6D6 (237, 230, 214) White Chocolate Color\n\nAfter cocoa, we definitely couldn’t skip the family of chocolate brown colors. We could probably find at least a few dozen of more brown shades with chocolate-related names but for this article, it’s probably better to continue with other edibles.\n\nBread and its’ cousins, tortilla included, is one of them.\n\n#DACBA9 (218, 203, 169) Baked Bread\n\n#D2AD84 (210, 173, 132) Butter Toast\n\n#8D7D77 (141, 125, 119) Cinnamon Toast\n\n#997950 (153, 121, 80) Tortilla\n\n#FFF8DC (255, 248, 220) Corn Silk\n\nWhile we are at basic foods, we can’t skip the meat and meat-related products. You got it right. Brown color in several different hues, tints, and shades, is influential in this sector too!\n\n#9F724B (159, 114, 75) Roast Brown\n\n#E3DAC9 (227, 218, 201) Bone zelo siva\n\n#534B4F (83, 75, 79) Liver\n\n#E5B73B (229, 183, 59) Meat Brown\n\n#BB8866 (187, 136, 102) Carnal Brown\n\nCaramel Brown, Anybody?\n\nIf you are in the mood for something sweet, sugar can be brown as well. We have already mentioned how shades of brown change when we apply some heat and sugar is no exception. Even if we start with perfectly white chrystals we soon got lovely brownish tones as a result of the dehydration of carbon hydrate.\n\nThis led us to caramel and related edibles.\n\n#492000 (73, 32, 0) Syrup\n\n#AF6F09 (175, 111, 9) Caramel\n\n#FFD59A (255, 213, 154) Caramel Color\n\n#B87A59 (184, 122, 89) Caramel Apple\n\n#A17249 (161, 114, 73) Brown Sugar\n\nSweet liquids don’t end here. Apart from caramel, we need to address at least maple syrup and honey, right? And, of course, both pair perfectly with butter leading to more interesting brownish shades.\n\n#C9A38D (201, 163, 141) Maple Sugar\n\n#BB9351 (187, 147, 81) Maple Syrup\n\n#BA9238 (186, 146, 56) Honey Brown\n\n#EFE0CD (239, 224, 205) Buttercream\n\n#F1EBDA (241, 235, 218) Buttery Brown\n\nWe have more than a dozen brown food-related colors with codes in our depository, waiting to be sorted in groups, but at the moment, it’s time to end the journey through brownish colors of food.\n\nHow about a drink?\n\nBrown Color Names Named After Drinks\n\nThere are many brown drinks out there and coffee is probably at the top of the list. Coffee, in its countless versions which are getting even more numerous each and every day. Even if we call it black coffee, we always deal with more or less dark shades of brown.\n\nHere is a set of the first five coffee brown shades.\n\n#6F4E37 (111, 78, 55) Coffee\n\n#704241 (112, 66, 65) Deep Coffee\n\n#4B3621 (75, 54, 33) Cafe Noir\n\n#4A2C2A (74, 44, 42) Brown Coffee\n\n#38250E (56, 37, 14) Espresso Brown\n\nThere are as many versions of coffee as there are coffee drinkers. some prefer a quick shot of energy, while others enjoy sipping it. some want it black (meaning without anything in the cup except the coffee), and others add sugar, milk, cream, and even alcoholic drinks.\n\nSome sorts of coffee became so popular they expanded from local curiosities to true ambassadors of their inventors. Here we go with a second set of coffee colors with HEX and RGB codes.\n\n#5C3925 (92, 57, 37) Irish Coffee\n\n#7D6757 (125, 103, 87) Roman Coffee\n\n#483F39 (72, 63, 57) Turkish Coffee\n\n#A88B70 (168, 139, 112) Affogato\n\n#967969 (150, 121, 105) Mocha\n\nMilk and dairy products such as cream or ice cream are an especially popular addition to coffee drinks which already vary by brown shades depending on the sort of coffee beans and type of preparation. We can add just a few drops of milk or we can go to the other extreme, finishing with just a hint of coffee in milk.\n\n#7A706C (122, 112, 108) Americano\n\n#BCADA3 (188, 173, 163) Cappuccino\n\n#C0A386 (192, 163, 134) Cortado\n\n#928168 (146, 129, 104) Macchiato\n\n#3F3230 (63, 50, 48) Ristretto\n\nThe last set of coffee brown colors for designers, coffee lovers, and all curious people who want to learn something new has an addition of Frappe Color, which expands a whole new set of possibilities in the area of browns. We also included Chicory which is widely used as a coffee substitute.\n\n#C5A582 (197, 165, 130) Latte\n\n#A67B5B (166, 123, 91) Cafe Au Lait\n\n#B18F6A (177, 143, 106) Iced Coffee\n\n#D1B7A0 (209, 183, 160) Frappe\n\n#A78658 (167, 134, 88) Chicory\n\nTo be fair, we have to add at least one set of tea-related colors. They are brown drinks too, aren’t they?\n\n#DAC395 (218, 195, 149) Chamomile\n\n#999B85(153, 155, 133) Tea Color\n\n#B1832F (177, 131, 47) Chai\n\n#A23C26 (162,60,38) Rooibos Tea\n\n#923C01 (146, 60, 1) Iced Tea\n\nWe are done with beverages for now and ready to conclude our journey in the land of brown-colored drinks. Champagne, whiskey, and brandy should also be included in the list. Recently especially the family of Champagne colors is in high demand, as we can see, among other examples in this list of light pink paint colors.\n\n#C9A86A (201, 168, 106) Ginger Ale\n\n#D2975D (210, 151, 93) Whiskey\n\n#FAD6A5 (250, 214, 165) Champagne\n\n#DCB68A (220, 182, 138) Brandy\n\n#9A463D (154, 70, 61) Cognac\n\nThis is the end of the article for time being. Expect some more browns to be added in the future. The world of animals, minerals, or just everyday objects offers many many more!\n\nIf you learned something interesting and useful, share it with others. Bye!\n\nLight pink paints are a classic choice for painting interiors for many years and their popularity is growing. Pink paint, especially pale, muted tones, goes great with almost all other colors and gives us countless possible combinations for creating a unique feel for every imaginable home.\n\nDue to its soothing, feminine effect, pastel pink paints found their way to living rooms and bedrooms, and are one of the first choices for painting the walls of girls’ bedrooms and studies. Did you know that certain hues of pink paint are used in correctional institutions to calm down the aggressiveness of the prisoners?\n\nBy definition soft pink paint color is made of some red and a lot of white. The more white, the more soft pink color we’ll achieve. To play a bit with the warmth of the final result, some yellow and blue may be added as well.\n\nLet’s take a look at the light pink paints available on the market with examples and HEX and RGB codes.\n\nPale Pink Paint Colors for Walls\n\nPale pinks are by definition pink colors with a lot of white pigment. White is so dominant that pink can be seen only as an undertone.\n\n#FAE3DD (250, 227, 221) Behr Soft Pink\n\n#FDEBE5 (253, 235, 229) Peintures MF Chaleur / Benjamin Moore Soft Pink\n\n#F7EBE7 (247, 235, 231) Asian Paints Pearly Pink / Rodda Paint Soft Shell / Cloverdale Paint Soft Shell\n\n#F9E9E6 (249, 233, 230) Scib Paints Pale Perfection / Vista Paint Pale Perfection / Berger Pale Perfection / Behr Hush Pink\n\n#F6EAE5 (246, 234, 229) Wattyl Fairy White / Asian Paints Divine Pink / Rodda Paint Pale Petals / Cloverdale Paint Pale Petals\n\nPaint makers sometimes use a bit poetic names for their products, yet it’s obvious they all offer almost the same thing – soft, calming paints with a bit of pink which gives some warmth to your room walls.\n\n#F0E3E6 (240, 227, 230) Porter Paints Pastel Pink / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Pastel Pink\n\n#EBDED6 (235, 222, 214) Diamond Vogel Cliffswallow / ECOS Paints Cliffswallow\n\n#F2E2DC (242, 226, 220) Olympic Plaster Pink / Pantone PMS Pastel 9241\n\n#E5DCD5 (229, 220, 213) CIL Pink Suede / Pantone PMS 11-0603 TPG Pastel Parchment\n\n#FCFAF8 (252, 250, 248) Brighto Paints Pink Champagne\n\nYou already noticed light and pale are often used interchangeably, even though they differ by definition – light can be much more energetic and at least in theory made without the addition of white. Yet in practice both groups of pinkish paints often overlap and to make our lives even more interesting, paint factories describe their colors with soft and pastels as well.\n\n#F8EAE3 (248, 234, 227) Benjamin Moore Shell Pink\n\n#F3E2E6 (243, 226, 230) Benjamin Moore Ballerina Pink\n\n#F5EAE7 (245, 234, 231) Benjamin Moore Pink Bliss\n\n#F7E7E1 (247, 231, 225) Behr My Sweetheart\n\n#F7E1DC (247, 225, 220) Sherwin-Williams Laurel Pink\n\nBenjamin Moore is one of the most popular paint producers and their family of pink paints is in constant demand. In the set of paints above you can compare three of their products with two different (and also extremely popular) makers of pink wall paints: Behr and Sherwin-Williams. Both of them are represented below as well.\n\n#F2E6E6 (242, 230, 230) Behr Pink Prism\n\n#F6E9E8 (246, 233, 232) Sherwin-Williams Fancy Pink\n\n#EEE9DC (238, 233, 220) Glidden Cream Puff / Coronado Paint Campiello / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Cream Puff\n\n#EFE9DD (239, 233, 221) Nerolac Old Charm / Porter Paints Cream Puff / Behr Villa White\n\n#F6E7E2 (246, 231, 226) Sherwin-Williams Cosmetic Blush\n\nSome soft pink paints have a slightly yellowish feel which makes them even warmer and livelier. They are, of course, very neutral and great to paint with more powerful colors for furniture, decor, and other surfaces.\n\n#F0EBE9 (240, 235, 233) Designers Guild Frost / Behr White Dogwood\n\n#EAE6DE (234, 230, 222) Scib Paints White Now! / 8476 / Porter Paints Dogwood Blossom / Vista Paint White Now! / Berger White Now! / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Dogwood Blossom\n\n#E8E4DB (232, 228, 219) Asian Paints White Delight / CIL Kitten White / Olympic Dogwood Blossom\n\n#F3ECEA (243, 236, 234) Behr Touch of the Pink\n\n#EFE5E4 (239, 229, 228) Olympic Bare Pink / Taubmans Iris Haze\n\nThis is the last set of pale pink paint colors, called barely pink paints. Some makers don’t even use the word pink in their names and rather go for plants or even animals. We will continue with a bit more intensive light pink paints for interiors.\n\nSoft Pink Paint\n\nWe are still in the huge and popular family of light pink paints but the next few sets will perform significantly warmer thanks to greater values of red pigment in the mixture. For starters, let’s see what Benjamin Moore has to offer:\n\n#FDE8E6 (253, 232, 230) Benjamin Moore Touch Of Pink\n\n#FFCDD8 (255, 205, 216) Benjamin Moore Light Chiffon Pink\n\n#FAE7E9 (250, 231, 233) Benjamin Moore Elephant Pink\n\n#FDE7E4 (253, 231, 228) Benjamin Moore Powder Pink\n\n#FACBD0 (250, 203, 208) Benjamin Moore Pastel Pink\n\nBenjamin Moore offers a huge selection of pinkish paints for walls, differentiating by gentle hues of reddish, yellowish, and bluish undertones. All are very popular due to their ability to pair with other paint colors.\n\nThe next set offers a few pink paints with champagne in their names. While we all expect a bit of yellow in those colors, you’ll find a few champagne pink paint colors in the next groups of paints, where other hues are present.\n\n#FFEFF3 (255, 239, 243) California Paints Pink Champagne / Dunn-Edwards Powder Puff\n\n#F1DDE1 (241, 221, 225) Clark+Kensington Pink Champagne\n\n#FEDCE7 (254, 220, 231) ProMarker Pale Pink\n\n#F7CAC1 (247, 202, 193) Glidden Rose Pink / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Rose Pink\n\n#E8DADD (232, 218, 221) ICI Paints Harem Pink / Dulux Waterlily Blush 6\n\nHere we go with another set of light pink paints available by different paint makers. They look petty similar, yet each one of them with a special feeling that you can create in your bedroom, living room, or other places in your home. All are warm, optimistic, and energetic like modern users expect from wall paints.\n\n#FFE9E4 (255, 233, 228) Brighto Paints Rose Pink\n\n#F7DBD9 (247, 219, 217) Behr Princess Pink\n\n#EED2D4 (238, 210, 212) Glidden Princess Pearl Pink\n\n#FDE0DB (253, 224, 219) Rodda Paint My Sweetheart / Cloverdale Paint My Sweetheart\n\n#FDE0DD (253, 224, 221) Scib Paints My Sweetheart / Vista Paint My Sweetheart / Berger My Sweetheart\n\n#F9DCD7 (249, 220, 215) Coronado Paint My Sweetheart\n\n#FFE3E0 (255, 227, 224) Duron Laurel Pink\n\n#FFEDF3 (255, 237, 243) Duron Fancy Pink\n\n#FDE9E3 (253, 233, 227) Benjamin Moore Frosty Pink\n\n#F6DEDE (246, 222, 222) Duron White Dogwood / Devoe Paint Delicious\n\nEver heard about millennial pink paint? Well, the term was coined in the late 2010s and is used for a whole family of light pink shades. While you’ll find an html code for millennial pink color #F3CFC6 and RGB (243, 207, 198), the producers of paints got several ideas on how should millennial pink actually look on the wall.\n\nHere is a set of millennial pink paints made by Sherwin-Williams.\n\n#F1CAD3 (241, 202, 211) Sherwin-Williams Reverie Pink\n\n#E3B5A8 (227, 181, 168) Sherwin-Williams Mellow Coral\n\n#E8B9AE (232, 185, 174) Sherwin-Williams Rachel Pink\n\n#D6C8C0 (214, 200, 192) Sherwin-Williams Unfussy Beige\n\n#E3B7B1 (227, 183, 177) Sherwin-Williams Gracious Rose\n\nThe tones of millennial pink vary from gentle pink to more yellowish, greyish, and blueish hues. The assortment is, obviously, much wider when we take into account, other paint makers. Maybe we’ll present some of them in the future.\n\nBlush Pink Paint\n\nBlush pink paints are bolder colors with more intense red tones. They are cozy, inviting, and invigorating. Modern interior designers use them for smaller places like closets, laundry rooms, powder rooms, and home offices.\n\n#EBBBB1 (235, 187, 177) Valspar Paint Soft Pink\n\n#E4A5A9 (228, 165, 169) Glidden Soft French Pink\n\n#FAB4D8 (250, 180, 216) Apple Barrel Light Pink 20535\n\n#FABFBF (250, 191, 191) Apple Barrel Light Pink 44844E\n\n#FF9999 (255, 153, 153) Humbrol Pink / Light Salmon Pink\n\nBecause pink, especially lighter hues, pairs so well with neutrals, like beige, cream, ivory, and similar whiteish colors, we have virtually infinite possibilities to create a space according to our wishes. Sometimes the ceiling is painted with the same light paint color, sometimes only three-quarters of the walls are covered and the top (together with a ceiling) is left white, to make an optical illusion of larger or higher space.\n\n#FADADD (250, 218, 221) Glidden Powder Pink\n\n#EEC4C9 (238, 196, 201) Albany Paint Powder Pink\n\n#F6B6BB (246, 182, 187) Behr Ballerina Pink\n\n#F8A3BC (248, 163, 188) Apple Barrel Princess Pink / Pantone / PMS 189 C\n\n#FFB1CF (255, 177, 207) Valspar Paint Princess Pink\n\nAgain, paint factories use sometimes pretty poetical names for their products. Powder pink paint is actually a conservative solution, while Princess Pink or Ballerina Pink clearly alludes to the girlish feel of the result.\n\nPale Pink Paint Colors With Yellowish Hues\n\nThe next group of light pink paints has a distinctive addition of yellowish tones. This makes them live, energetic, and optimistic.\n\n#F7D7CC (247, 215, 204) Benjamin Moore Pale Pink Satin\n\n#FFEAD8 (255, 234, 216) Kansai Paint Pastel Pink\n\n#F8EBD4 (248, 235, 212) Sherwin-Williams Dollop Of Cream / Taubmans Blush Pink / Bristol Blush Pink\n\n#F1DDCF (241, 221, 207) Clark+Kensington Pacific Coral\n\n#F3E5DC (243, 229, 220) Resene Fair Pink / Glidden Champagne Ice / Nippon Paint Penelope Pink / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Champagne Ice\n\nThose pastel pink paint colors are great for living rooms, playrooms, or other places where we spend a lot of time or hang out with visitors. They can be used in very different ways depending on the lighting conditions.\n\n#FDE1D9 (253, 225, 217) Taubmans Elephant Pink / T12 28.A2 / Bristol Elephant Pink / P073-W1\n\n#F7E8E2 (247, 232, 226) Benjamin Moore Gentle Butterfly / 2173-70 / Hint Of Pink / 884 / Coronado Paint 8060 – Devon Dawn\n\n#E2D0B8 (226, 208, 184) Kansai Paint Rose Pink\n\n#FFF1E8 (255, 241, 232) Diamond Paint Princess Pink\n\n#FEEBDC (254, 235, 220) Sanderson Peony Pink\n\nIf we compare, for instance, Elephant Pink and Hint of Pink, we notice that we are dealing with colors similar to champagne pinks, but with less intensive yellow. This muted effect has a calming effect, which can be used for all places where we want to relax. Or maybe meditate?\n\n#F4E3C7 (244, 227, 199) ICI Paints Lace Corsage / Behr Cream Puff\n\n#FBE3AB (251, 227, 171) Taubmans Cream Puff\n\n#FFEEC8 (255, 238, 200) Rodda Paint Cornmeal / Sanderson Cream Puff Lt / Cloverdale Paint Cornmeal\n\n#FFF1D8 (255, 241, 216) California Paints Vintage Lace / Pascol Angel’s Glow / Dunn-Edwards Cream Puff\n\n#EAD9D0 (234, 217, 208) Fuller OBrien Pink Champagne\n\nThis group of yellowish pink paints, made by slightly less known paint makers is a bit brighter, with a more playful effect. Several paints use the word cream in their names insinuating soft whitish yellowish tones.\n\nRose Pink Paint\n\nIf yellowish pinks make you feel more energetic, more orange tones give you determination and power. The next few groups of paints still belong to light pinks yet they are the most intense so far. The reason is a higher percentage of red pigment which, with an addition of yellow, create a fresh and flowery or fruity feeling.\n\n#FA906C (250, 144, 108) Valspar Paint Pink Blush\n\n#FFCDC5 (255, 205, 197) ProMarker Pastel Pink\n\n#E7C1B5 (231, 193, 181) Behr Pink Blush\n\n#FEE4D2 (254, 228, 210) Valspar Paint Champagne Pink\n\n#FFD0C4 (255, 208, 196) Taubmans Pink Elephant / Peintures MF Nuance de peche / Bristol Pink Elephant\n\nOrange-pink paints also come on the market in numerous variations, from bolder almost orange to gentler almost greyish-white tones. The producers found inspiration everywhere, from nature and geography to breakfast food and personal cosmetic products.\n\n#FFE1D4 (255, 225, 212) Taubmans White Feather / Resene Sentimental / Bristol Powder Pink\n\n#F8CEC5 (248, 206, 197) Sico Pink Powder-Puff\n\n#EFBE9E (239, 190, 158) Chrysler Shell Pink\n\n#FFCEC4 (255, 206, 196) Taubmans Pink Sea Shell/ Bristol Pink Sea Shell\n\n#F6E4D9 (246, 228, 217) Pantone PMS 11-1306 TCX Cream Pink / Taubmans Bare Pink\n\nThe next group of orangey-pink paints is the palest pink in the family. Five different popular brand marks offer relatively similar neutral pink paints with clear orange undertones. All presented colors pair great with numerous darker colors.\n\n#F8DBCF (248, 219, 207) Taubmans Pink Bliss\n\n#F9E9E4 (249, 233, 228) Benjamin Moore Cream Puff\n\n#FCE8E1 (252, 232, 225) Farrow & Ball Middleton Pink\n\n#EFDED8 (239, 222, 216) Sherwin-Williams White Dogwood\n\n#F6E2D7 (246, 226, 215) Duron Alluring White / Behr Island Hopping / Farrow & Ball Pink Ground\n\nMore Neutral Pink Paint Examples\n\nWe have already explored soft pink paints with only a hint of pink, with an addition of yellow or orange, and stronger tones of pink. It’s time to see if there are even more pastel pink paints on the market.\n\nYes, of course, there are many other popular products in this area. The next few sets of paints look a bit more brownish, even earthy, which gives us countless opportunities for usage in interiors and exteriors.\n\n#E5C9BC (229, 201, 188) Pratt & Lambert King’s Arms Rose Pink Medium Light\n\n#D2AD9F (210, 173, 159) Pratt & Lambert King’s Arms Rose Pink\n\n#F5D6BF (245, 214, 191) Taubmans Soft Pink / Bristol Soft Pink\n\n#F2D9CC (242, 217, 204) Benjamin Moore Love & Happiness\n\n#EDD1C2 (237, 209, 194) Dulux Australia Pale Pink\n\nAll presented pink pants are soft, pale, and light, with a hint of yellow and some green which makes them a bit brownish, sometimes edging on beige or cream which are classic choices for painting the walls for many many years.\n\n#E4C1AE (228, 193, 174) 1829 Pale Salmon Pink\n\n#BA929C (186, 146, 156) Wattyl Posh Pink / New Look Flush Blush\n\n#F2E9E4 (242, 233, 228) Devoe Paint Elizabethan / Earthpaint Pink Champagne / CHROMATIC Rose Arum\n\n#F4D5CE (244, 213, 206) Behr Pink Elephant\n\n#C9947F (201, 148, 127) Matthews Paint Pressed Rose Pink\n\nThe group of pinkish paints above is interesting for their diversity. While all give an earthy, muted appearance, they are obviously very contrasting. While Posh Pink from Wattyl looks almost purple, we could easily characterize Elizabethan by Devoe Paint as white.\n\nSpeaking of white, check the next group of very light pink paints.\n\nIs There the Palest Pink Paint?\n\n#E7DDDE (231, 221, 222) Glidden Wood Anemone Pink / Dulux Pale Peony\n\n#EBD4CE (235, 212, 206) Brighto Paints Day Dawn / Behr Ole Pink\n\n#DEB2AF (222, 178, 175) Dulux Australia Princess Pink\n\n#FBE1DE (251, 225, 222) Taubmans Pink Peony / Bristol Pink Peony\n\n$DFCFD1 (223, 207, 209) Levis Gentle Peony / CIL Nouvelle Pink\n\nWhile technically all the colors above belong to orangeish pinks, we are definitely still dealing with pale pinks with orange subtones. These paints are very neutral and can be used almost universally.\n\nMore Blush Pink Paints Examples\n\nWe have already presented several blush pink paint colors. They all have a bit of blue which makes pink purplish. This leads to a more dramatic, yet sweet effect. Blush paints are a popular choice for walls in different interiors, from living rooms to bedrooms. We selected lighter shades varying from creamy and greyish to magenta and mauve shades.\n\n#E8D1D7 (232, 209, 215) Earthpaint Candle Light Pink\n\n#F3E3EB (243, 227, 235) Brighto Paints Candle Light Pink\n\n#F4CEE3 (244, 206, 227) Asian Paints Blush Pink\n\n#EDE1E5 (237, 225, 229) Porter Paints Pink Champagne / PPG Pittsburgh Paints Pink Champagne\n\n#E1CCD1 (225, 204, 209) Duron Studio Mauve / ICI Paints Pink Champagne\n\nWhile Behr, Benjamin Moore, Farrow and Ball, Sherwin-Williams, and Valspar dominate the market, we made an effort to present some other paint makers as well. All these paint colors pair well with blue and green paints, but they can look especially great with glass and metal.\n\n#EDC5D3 (237, 197, 211) Earthpaint Pink Elephant\n\n#F8D6E6 (248, 214, 230) Brighto Paints Pink Elephant\n\n#D3BFC1 (211, 191, 193) Levis Diadeem / Dulux Powder Pink\n\n#EADEE3 (234, 222, 227) Glidden Floral Twist Pink / Pantone PMS 11-2509 TPG Calcite / Earthpaint Perfume Powder\n\n#ECC4E0 (236, 196, 224) Plascon Sea Shell Pink\n\nWe are ending this article about light pink paint colors for the moment. Just for the moment. Because there are dozens of interesting, inspiring, and inviting paints already on the market with always something new to explore. So expect more in the future, because pale pinks are here to stay!\n\nRoses are by far the most popular flowers in the world. Their gentle petals and sharp thorns make an instant dramatic impact. Roses’ colors tell many interesting stories which evolve through time and cultures. We can’t imagine Valentine’s day without them.\n\nBut there’s a catch. What does the color of a specific rose actually tell? Is there a difference if you send a single rose or a bouquet? Are red roses saying the same, no matter the shade? We intend to provide you at least a basic insight into the fascinating world of roses’ colors and their sometimes obvious but in many cases very subtle meanings connected with often very complicated symbolism.\n\nAt the end of this article, you should be able to understand the message of the rose you are sending or receiving. You should also know how to paint a rose (learn how to draw a rose here) and effectively use it as an authentic gift or a decorative element in a design.\n\nFor starters, we’ll provide facts about ten different colors of roses and their meanings. We have already prepared material for at least half a dozen more rose colors in near future, so don’t think about this article as a complete story yet. It will expand soon. And it will probably continue to expand for many more years …\n\nMeanings of Red Roses\n\nRed roses tell a story about desire, longing, love, and passion. What a bouquet of red roses says instead of the sender? ‘I love you!’ Deeper the color, the more ready you are for a committed relationship.\n\n#C21E56 (194, 30, 86) Rose Red (Htmlcolorcodes)\n\n#FF033E (255, 3, 62) Rose Red (Canva) aka American Rose\n\n#CD7687 (205, 118, 135) Rose Red Color (Color-Name)\n\n#C21E56 (194, 30, 86) Rose Red Color (Eggradients)\n\n#BE013C (190, 1, 60) Rose Red (Wikimix)\n\n#FF5454 (255, 84, 84) Rose (Hexcolor)\n\n#C08081 (192, 128, 129) Old Rose aka Ashes of Rose\n\n#C4808A (196, 128, 138) Old Rose Red (Color Combos)\n\n#AB4E52 (171, 78, 82) Rose Vale\n\n#BE013C (190, 1, 60) Rose Red (XKCD)\n\n#B94D58 (185, 77, 88) ICI Paints Red Red Rose\n\n#C1565C (193, 86, 92) Devoe Paint Red Red Rose\n\n#C75361 (199, 83, 97) Glidden Red Red Rose\n\n#E71837 (231, 24, 55) Nanjing Automotive Group Rose Red Solid / Plymouth Antique Rose\n\n#A93B46 (169, 59, 70) Glidden Red Rose Bouquet\n\n#BB5A58 (187, 90, 88) Valspar Paint Deep Rose\n\n#CD6D70 (205, 109, 112) Australian Standard Deep Rose\n\n#A0372F (160, 55, 47) Benjamin Moore Deep Rose\n\n#C28285 (194, 130, 133) Glidden Deep Dusty Rose\n\n#BE594B (190, 89, 75) Diamond Vogel Sweet Baby Rose / ECOS Paints Sweet Baby Rose\n\n#C4375C (196, 55, 92) Pantone Rose Red\n\n#DD727D (221, 114, 125) Pantone Tea Rose\n\n#CB555D (203, 85, 93) Rose Red\n\n#905D5D (144, 93, 93) Rose Taupe\n\n#B17376 (177, 115, 118) Benjamin Moore Burgundy Rose\n\nMeanings of Pink Roses\n\nWhat is the meaning of pink roses?

After all, purple was reserved for royalty for centuries and is in many areas still used only on special occasions.\n\n#5E2D79 Purple Rose\n\n#B09FCA (176, 159, 202) Pantone Purple Rose\n\n#C0428A (192, 66, 138) Pantone Rose Violet\n\n#CB9AAD (203, 154, 173) Dutch Boy Purple Rose / Sherwin-Williams Rosebay\n\n#CABCD2 (202, 183, 210) Glidden Quaint Purple Rose\n\n#D8B9D8 (216, 185, 216) Crown Diamond Violet Rose\n\n#BE8A97 (190, 138, 151) FolkArt Vintage Tea Rose\n\n#DBA5C5 (219, 165, 197) Devoe Paint Tea Rose Garden\n\n#A4707A (164, 112, 122) Dulux Australia Tea Rose\n\n#D0ACCF (208, 172, 207) Behr Rose Purple\n\nLavender Rose Color Meaning\n\nstill working on it\n\nThe Meaning of Yellow Rose\n\nYellow roses are all about happiness and joy. When you send yellow roses to somebody you are celebrating life at its best moments. A yellow rose is probably the least romantic of all and the most suitable for sending to a platonic friend. It simply says: ‘Thanks for making me happy!’\n\n#FFF000 (255, 240, 0) Yellow Rose\n\n#EFBF4D (239, 191, 77) Adonis Rose Yellow\n\n#FAEDC8 (250, 237, 200) Muralo Yellow Rose\n\n#FFDB75 (255, 219, 117) CIL Yellow Rose / Devoe Paint Yellow Rose / Olympic Beach Ball\n\n#FFD76E (255, 215, 110) ICI Paints Yellow Rose / Coronado Paint Country Sun\n\nDid you know yellow roses symbolized jealousy in the 19th century? Getting a bouquet of yellow roses was a public accusation of betrayal or infidelity! It’s not clear how the meaning changed through time, yet it’s probably related to a simple fact – the message in most cases tells more about the sendee than the sender. Somebody who opted for a yellow rose showed himself or herself as a greedy and jealous person.\n\nThe role of the messager of such a negative image is nowadays somehow portrayed by a yellow hyacinth.\n\n#FFDA71 (255, 218, 113) Devoe Paint Yellow Rose\n\n#FFD65C (255, 214, 92) Taubmans Yellow Rose\n\n#FFE27C (255, 226, 124) Glidden Yellow Rose\n\n#F4E3A1 (244, 227, 161) Martha Stewart Living Yellow Rose\n\n#F1DCA5 (241, 220, 165) Martha Stewart Living Tea Rose\n\nOrange Rose Meaning\n\nOrange roses communicate energy, fascination, and pride. Orange is a color of enthusiasm, perfect to express admiration to somebody. An orange rose can motivate you too, especially if you want to congratulate somebody on a certain achievement.\n\nA bouquet of orange roses tells: ‘Great work. Keep it up!’\n\n#DB7146 (219, 113, 70) Matthews Paint Orange Rose\n\n#F9EDE0 (249, 237, 224) Behr Apricot Rose\n\n#EF8957 (239, 137, 87) Valspar Paint Tomato Rose\n\n#EB8B6E (235, 139, 110) Valspar Paint Amber Rose\n\n#E98575 (233, 133, 117) Dulux Gypsy Rose\n\nMeaning of Peach Rose\n\nPeach is a shade of orange color. It’s actually a whole family of colors among a larger group. Peach orange colors are so influential they differ from the ‘normal’ orange (although we all know how many details can we find in there).\n\nSo, what’s the meaning of peach roses? They send a message of gratitude and sincerity. They are not so often used in romantic connotations as to a friend or a relative, especially to younger ones.\n\nIf you simply want to say: ‘Thank you!’, peach roses are the way to go.\n\n#FFE6D8 (255, 230, 216) Light Peach Rose\n\n#FDE2C5 (253, 226, 197) Peach Rose\n\n#F6E3D5 (246, 227, 213) Peach Rose (Photokit)\n\n#FFE3C6 (255, 227, 198) Vista Paint Peach Rose / Behr Fall Straw / Scib Paints Peach Rose / Berger Peach Rose\n\n#FFDDBE (255, 221, 190) Rodda Paint Peach Rose/ Cloverdale Paint Peach Rose\n\nGreen Color Rose Meaning\n\nGreen is the color of fertility, harmony, health, and stability. Green roses are rare, yet more and more popular, so we’ll probably see more of them soon. On a symbolic level, they are great to send somebody with best wishes for good health.\n\nA green rose sends a message of hope and recovery.\n\n#DBF9DB (219, 249, 219) Light Rose Green\n\n#292D74 (41, 45, 116) Blue Rose\n\n#7D7CC0 (125, 124, 192) Rose Blue\n\n#5C798A (92, 121, 138) Transmitter Shop Rose Blue\n\n#B2B3CA (178, 179, 202) Dulux Blue Rose\n\nAs you can see, we managed to find only one green color officially connected to roses, and four for blue roses.\n\nThe obvious question is: what do blue roses mean? The meaning of blue roses is extrapolated from their extraordinariness. They represent lust, mystery, and unrequited love. When you know your love will never be fulfilled, a blue flower will say: ‘I love you even if it’s not meant to be.’\n\nBlack Rose Meaning\n\nBlack is the color of death but also represents authority, certainty, and confidence. Traditionally black roses were sent to enemies (especially very personal, even intimate ones) as a death wish, but nowadays this changed.\n\nA black rose can send very positive messages, like: ‘I am over it. I am ready to move on. Although there is no more us, I believe in myself.’\n\n#1C0506 (28, 5, 6) Black Rose Color (Color-Name)\n\n#532934 (83, 41, 52) Black Rose (Crispedge)\n\n#74053C (116, 5, 60) Black Rose (Hexcolor)\n\n#532934 (83, 41, 52) Resene Black Rose\n\n#88474E (136, 71, 78) Sico Black Rose\n\nDid you spot the differences between black shades named after black roses? Black roses are rare like green and blue ones, so they are also connected to the mystery. So when you wanna say: ‘I am out of your life, and you’ll never know what you missed.’, a black rose can tell this instead of you.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nWhat Are the Best Colors for St. Valentine’s Day?\n\nWanna pick a perfect set of Valentine’s colors? Are there only red, white, and pink, or could we expand the palette? What to wear and how to choose appropriate Valentine’s colors for nails?\n\nWe’ll present the official Valentine’s colors with their more and less known meanings to allow you to make the best of St. Valentine’s Day.\n\nValentine’s Red\n\nRed is the obvious choice for Valentine’s. It’s the color of passion and love, life and blood. A bouquet of red roses is a classic gift for the lady of a gentleman’s heart. But we can do much more with the color red, especially if we are willing to dive a bit deeper and play with its numerous shades and countless combinations with other colors.\n\nIf you wander about Valentine’s color code, we got you covered. Let’s start with St. Valentine’s red colors:\n\n#E55451 (229, 84, 81) Valentine Red (Computerhope)\n\n#D41F3A (212, 31, 58) Valentine Red Color (Color Name)\n\n#E72650 (231, 38, 80) Valentine Color (Color Name)\n\n#B233B (155, 35, 59) Valentine Red Color (Crispedge)\n\n#BC3440 (188, 52, 64) Valentine Red (Colourlovers)\n\nThe set of Valentine’s reds above comes from various unofficial web sources. Different international standards used to compile this list of red colors don’t have Valentine Red on the list. Yet.\n\nBut we all know things can change, right?\n\nThe paint makers already offer several red paints named after St. Valentine.\n\n#AE3162 (174, 49, 98) Vista Paint Valentine’s Kiss / Berger Valentine’s Kiss / Scib Paints Valentine’s Kiss\n\n#B44F51 (180, 79, 81) Sico Valentine Card / Crown Diamond Valentine Card\n\n#A5414D (165, 65, 77) Benjamin Moore My Valentine\n\n#DC6B6E (220, 107, 110) CIL Funny Valentine\n\n#DF6B6B (223, 107, 107) Devoe Paint Funny Valentine / Color Your World Funny Valentine\n\nIt’s always interesting to note how the perception of color, even if it’s associated with a specific action, event, feeling, or, in this case, holiday, varies. Different companies see Valentine’s Red paint as presented above and below.\n\n#D86367 (216, 99, 103) ICI Paints Funny Valentine\n\n#A53A4E (165, 58, 78) Sherwin-Williams Valentine\n\n#984053 (152, 64, 83) MyPerfectColor Valentine Red\n\n#DE6167 (222, 97, 103) Dulux Funny Valentine\n\n#AA323A (170, 50, 58) Sico Valentine\n\nWe are not finished with the list of Red Valentine’s paints.
