As a professor of the Clocktower, such knowledge is required. This covers the following.[Effect:] Basic Familiar Creation (D) - creation of up to three familiars. They can only assume the form of small animals like cats, crows, dogs and the like. The range they can stay connected to a magus is within the limits of a small city. Because the skill only covers basic familiars, they will not possess complex unique skills, like the ability to attack or speak.Basic Bounded Fields (D) - the knowledge to create and destroy bounded fields. The speed of creation can possibly take 30 minutes to hours, depending on the size of the bounded field. At this rank, the bounded field can at most span a hundred feet - the size of a typical bedroom. Its durability, if that applies, is the same as the rank.Basic Mental Interference (D) - low level hypnotism is possible against normal people with no magic circuits (or not active circuits). This works only on NPC or characters with dormant circuits with player consent. Its main function is for the manipulation of memories in order to keep the existence of magecraft a secret. At this rank, it is possible to issue simple orders that do not go against the individual's principles and desires.Magic Crest Creation/Update (Null) - the ability to create a magic crest and contribute to it. Magic Crests are mysteries, bought separately.NAME OF SKILL: Toxicology: Formula of RothwildRANK: ATYPE: Magecraft/BioDESCRIPTION: Toxicology is a medical field of science concerned with the nature, effects of poisons and its harmful effects to the body. Following the famous works, articles written by professor Hohenheim, it is said that there are some toxins in the world that works greatly in specific organs of the body. When poison is injected, it doesn’t mean complete deterioration of the body as a whole rather in an area sensitive to the chemical substance. Arcades has recently perfected the art of brewing poisons and miasma, some through the means of mage craft itself rather than ordinary scientific applications.[Effect:]Allows Arcades to apply poison to his own attacks, physical or magical in nature, knowledge over toxins allows him to easily identify what it is and how to neutralize it in turn. Toxins that were brewed with great mastery from the Age of the Gods can overcome Arcades’ resistance to poison. NAME OF SKILL: Poison ResistanceRANK: BTYPE: Magecraft/BioDESCRIPTION: While there are many types of poisons in the world, it is also known that those who would use toxins to kill foes tend to ingest some of it to develop antibodies and strengthen immunity towards that kind of poison. While it is not possible formulate an antidote to all kinds of poison, resistance and longevity of the lifespan once expose to these kinds of incurable poisons would have increased significantly.[Effect:]Grants Arcades an extremely high resistance to most types of poison known across the world though it doesn’t grant full immunity to any toxin classified to B rank or above rather decrease the effectiveness of such poisons.NAME OF SKILL: CursesRANK: BTYPE: Magecraft/KnowledgeDESCRIPTION: \"All curses will bring misfortune by not all coincidences are curses.\" ~Arcades RothwildA field of magecraft that involves completely altercating one’s true nature, the very thing that signifies one’s existence in this world, and violate it by imposing or rewriting it through the intervention of shadows. From the primitive to the most potent, each curse induces phenomenon to act upon and roots from resentment. And it is because of curses are how most known taboos in the world are formed, some even worst than others. Thus the true nature of curses is the alteration of one’s true nature and takes the form of a grudge.Much to his familiarity in the field, he is capable of creating a new curse, be it through incantation or by simply crafting an object meant to be its vessel. It maybe also possible for him to administer a curse simply with a glare which is called the Evil eye, (evil eye is technically a known scrying curse) however it’s less potent. Some curses can be bound to a leyline which can affect the entire land. A Geas falls under this category which imposes a mystical restriction given the consent of both parties.[Effect:] Grants Arcades the knowledge and familiarity on curses. He can inflict a curse upon a living target which can induce harmful and ailments, in Arcades’s case some of his curses are specialized to causes deterioration within the target’s body until death. In this case, it can lower a chosen physical parameter stat by 1. Some of his curses can either be administered by a glare whereas any extension that can serve as vision can be casted through the familiars he keeps, (Evileye is known as a basic scrying curse). It is also possible for Arcades to conclude his curse as most curses administered weren’t given any, thus their prolongment and if the time comes, he may do so. He may also create a Geas that imposes restriction and binds them to a consented agreement. Arcades can also dispel curses rank B and below while those higher are barely possibleOne can dictate the conditions of the curse given player consent should a curse be successfully casted.Curses cannot bypass anyone under the effects of apotropaic magecraft with equivalent rank.NAME OF SKILL: Beastial Inversion: GarudaRANK: CTYPE: Beast MagecraftDESCRIPTION: Bestial Inversion is a spell related to Beast magecraft which allows one’s body to be possessed by an animal spirit, and utilize some of its traits, reinforcing the body and materializing a holographic form depending on what spirit they are contracted to. Arcade’s inversion was named Garuda as his Bestial inversion represents such form.[Effect:] Arcades gains a pair of wings and darkens his appearance further resembling a fallen angel. It also makes all of his attacks look different. Increases all Arcades’s Endurance parameters by 1. Lasts for 6 posts with an equivalent cooldown. On hit effects apply.NAME OF SKILL: GandrRANK: CTYPE: Curse MagecraftDESCRIPTION: One of the rune spells passed down in Northern Europe. A type of curse that can reduce the target's physical capability. If the magical energy is highly condensed, it could have the same firepower as a bullet.[Effect:] Allows one to fire black bullets of magical energy that can decrease the target's END down by 1 rank ONLY IF its equivalent to or lower than the user's Gandr rank. NAME OF SKILL: Tria Prima: Father Medicine's LegacyRANK: BTYPE: AlchemyDESCRIPTION: The Tria Prima were the three principles of Paracelsus Von Hohenheim, the many who was the father of modern medicine and expanded his theories towards medical practice, allowing the birth of new solutions to treating illnesses and diseases. Salt represented the body; mercury represented the spirit (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties); sulphur represented the soul (the emotions and desires). By understanding the chemical nature of the tria prima, a physician could discover the means of curing disease. [Effect:] Allows one the ability to create a variety potions and elixirs of different varieties given the right ingredients such as healing the body, removing ailments, body enhancement (1 rank of choose parameter, can only be used on one parameter at a time.) recovering magical energy and much more. These may range from medical use to that of poisons as well. Can create other concoctions with aesthetic functions that aren't combat related. Any potions with buffs can only last for 3 posts.Additionally, he can only carry 8 vials of solutions at a time (Aesthetic solutions or those for the purpose of investigation do not count) Health Potion ( C ): Heals mildly lacerated wounds and mildly lacerated ones. Mana Potion ( D ): Recovers one's magical energy by a fair amount. Miracle Formula ( C ): Removes 1 status ailment or 1 debuff. Holy Water( C ) Dispels a curse equivalent to its rank. Body Booster ( C ) Increases one chosen parameter stat by one. Anthrax ( C ) Deals ranked damage over time. Can come in liquid form or gas. NAME OF SKILL: WushuRANK: DTYPE: Martial ArtsDESCRIPTION: It is popularly known as \"Kung Fu\", a traditional martial arts skill originating in China. To fulfill the basic requirement of a clocktower magus, Arcades studied basic martial arts in hopes to defend himself whereas one day his own magecraft may not be suitable enough to help him.[Effect:] Grants D level mastery over Wushu. MYSTERIES MYSTERIES: NAME: Murderous FlockRANK: ATYPE: FamiliarELEMENT: Curse/PoisonDESCRIPTION: A small group of fauna genetically modified by Arcades Rothwild himself which comes in different breeds of birds modeled from the Pitohui's bodily ability to coat its feathers with neurotoxins through its own diet of Choresine, a type of beetle that has high level of batrachotoxin. Afterwards, he allowed the progenitors to breed, creating a category of avian tied to his blood.Alone a single bird can be used for reconnaissance to serve as Rothwild's eyes and ears. In swarms these birds and dangerous especially to humans and large animals. Their talons are coated with the neurotoxin as well as their feathers upon touch, although from a single bird alone may only have temporary effects.[Effect:] Can act as simple reconnaissance and can attack Arcades's targets. A single bird may only have mild effects of poison but in droves, they can amount to a poison attack equivalent to Arcades's toxic skill.NAME: Pitohui, The Blighted GraspRANK: ATYPE: Mystic Code/Left Prosthetic ArmELEMENT: Curse/Poison/BeastDESCRIPTION: A mystic code tailor made under Arcades’s own preferences. When he received his prosthetic arm, he wanted to add a touch of his own with it, thus he began constructing it with magic circuits, imprinting it with those suited for his own specializations. This Mystic Code had one function, to violate the soul and corroding it the magecraft combined to it.Beast Magecraft served as its form, whereas the toxin attacks the body and the curse attacks the very nature of the target. The worst part of it is that it can materialize holographically at a distance.[Effect:] Upon touching the target's body, deals physical interference and administers both curse and poison, applying forward effects. For a ranged attack, he can materialize a holographic talon and shoot it forwards in about 20 meters from him and returns back to him. If the intended living target is caught between these intervals, they are immediately administered both curse and poison. Cooldown is about 4 posts but turns into 2 if the holographic attack returns to Arcades without hitting any enemies. history HISTORYThey were a lineage of alchemist who specialized more into the medical field since the mid - 1500s. Their research follows the three humors from Paracelsus, namely the Tria Prima, basic components used in order to arrive to a certain cure to a disease. After Hohenheim’s achievements, they had dedicated themselves to practice what he had left behind and further expand on his research if at all possible. However, one of Arcades’ forefathers had foreseen something about the future in which in this case, ingredients to cure ailments may one day be limited and be driven to a point of scarcity.In order to solve such crisis, he completely abandoned his family for his work to find the ultimate vaccine that can permanently cure all known diseases of the world, a sustainable component to which will eliminate the shortage of medicine. Though the last anyone’s heard from this forefather was before his trip to England.In the absence of the forefather, the family struggled with dwindling resources and without the proper instruction from the forefather, nearly more than half of the family’s secrets was lost with him.Thus in order to prevent any further ruin, they were to marry into a family that belonged to one of the 12 Lords of the Clocktower at the time, thus securing their future at the cost of having all their research surrendered. Arcades Rothwild in his early years, excelled in his studies and took pride in his family’s line of work, and received education that usually isn’t fit for his elementary years. Having shown passion and love for their work, Arcades created his first painkiller when he was only 10 years old and advanced beyond that, mastering modern medicine.He did belong to a family of medical specialists after all. At one point he administered oral medicine he made for his classmate to cure them of their common cold and gave another cough syrup which he made with their favorite flavor.Others call it talent but this was just the way he was raised. It was just simple knowledge to him after all.And because of that, the only people he can relate to were those who studied and shared their love for science, especially those in the chemistry department. He earned a scholarship and managed to take up his studies in the Clocktower, from there he continued until he graduated and became a Clocktower apprentice under the Department of Curses while also working as a pharmacist.During that time, he began experimenting with his drugs in Italy by offering free medication to those who can’t afford it, while it was considered illegal activity, he was known to as the Bird Doctor, a title earned because of the fact that all the time while administering these drugs, he was wearing a plague doctor’s mask which isn’t commonly known in the modern world.His actions did not go unnoticed as he was soon taken by a crime organization and was forced to do their bidding to create drugs for them to sell. He’d often participate in their operations, usually involves extortions, human trafficking and plotted assassinations as well as sabotage. All the more that he was never compensated fairly for it and detest their atrocity.At one point he disobeyed orders and spared the life of a young man and helped him escape at one point but only for the effort to have gone in vain as he was shot down afterwards.After being seen as a liability, the crime organization had disposed of him or so they had thought.They only succeeded in destroying his left arm.Making a recovery, he took matters into his own hands and plotted his revenge.He poisoned their best men, cursed their seats of power and watched their downfall in great relish.From his supposed field work he returned to the clock tower a different person and was given a special prosthetic arm under his own personal request. Eventually he started focusing towards making poisons that antidotes and his practice of curses as well as his new found beast magecraft.Because of his expertise, he was given the position of a substitute teacher in the department of alchemy.What are his motives now that he has changed? No one knows.PERSONALITYAt times Professor Arcades comes out as cold, cynical, malicious, bitter and sarcastic and possessed a commanding presence towards his students, keeping a class quiet without much effort. If anything, his entire presence shrouds the entire classroom of young magi, there was even fear that disappointing the professor may lead to consequences apart from anything related to schoolwork or so to the student’s imagination.Especially when he substitutes for basic alchemy class, he never fails to instruct and discipline his students and puts them under high standards, that is to say if any of them lagged behind, they’d earn a powerful scorn which is believed to the student’s own paranoia to be his way of administering a curse as punishment for their own sloppiness. Course his near ruthless rapport comes from his past experience in Italy. He takes pride in his alchemic work, should there be another professor hailed with a talent that can outshine his, he’d come to see them as a rival (Madame Nicola is an example). However, he’d care less about coining as to him it’s a hassle to create and manage homunculi while birds are much easier as birdkeeping became his hobby in order to preserve the memory of his so-called title “Bird Doctor” back in Italy.EXTRA INFOAlignment: Neutral EvilArcades Rothwild is 38 years oldArcades stands at a height of 176cmArcades weighs 59kgIn some proposed plots for Arcades apart from his search for the ultimate recipe for poison, it could be hinted that he could be solely responsible for crippling the evreux’s heir with an incurable cancer while at the same time could be the only man that can cure him.Rumors of Arcades associating with a Dead Apostle is only reserved for a possible plot, however unintended.He owns several laboratories across the world dedicated to make the finest of poisons, some were just psychotic drugs. This makes him one of the most powerful drug lords in the world.Like the typical magi he seeks the root only to realize and become the first to create the ultimate poison fatal enough to even afflict those that existed outside of mortality.Arcades’s Face Claim was primarily Gunter from the Fire Emblem series. This was changed to Swain from League of Legends.There is also mention that he could have met Madame Nicola at some point before the Arcadia Network was founded.

A dreaded technique with every intent to kill to which every strike will be delivered with no hints of restraint, nor fear of their opponent’s power. While this can be described as a rage inducing form of swordplay, this style proved effective in most skirmishes and assassinations, throwing off the opponent’s center of gravity and knocking away their battle patterns in a single strike, in which merits their second one to be fatal.\n\nEffect: Grants Seena the ability to fight with the blade using the applications of the slayer style. Every single strike is delivered with less effort. Proved highly effective against non-human entities.\n\nName of Skill: Krav Maga\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional): Martial art\n\nDescription: Krav maga which means “contact combat” is a form of Middle Eastern martial art that consists of a wide combination of techniques sourced from Aikido, Judo, Boxing, Wrestling, along with realistic fight training. It is known to be extremely efficient and for its known counter attacks. It emphasizes aggression, neutralization and simultaneous defensive and offensive maneuvers to deal with the threat.\n\nEffect: Allows Seena to employ the use of techniques from Krav maga and perform them under a professional level.\n\nName of Skill: Gandr\n\nRank: C\n\nSkill Type (optional): Curse\n\nDescription: is a simple curse originating from Scandinavia, which decreases the physical health of the target. Because the curse properly said is released from the caster’s index finger and the target must be within the field of vision to be aimed at, it is dubbed Gandr Shot. A Gandr with so much Magical Energy concentrated into it that becomes capable of physical interference is called Finn Shot.\n\n[Effect]: Seena can fire a full clip of 30 gandr shots at once. Afterwards reloading takes a single post. In addition to that, the Finn shot consumes 15 gandr shots.\n\nMysteries\n\nName of Skill:Esva Granz: The 8th Contract of St. Croix\n\nRank: A\n\nType:Conceptual Weapon\n\nDescription: Esva Granz is a demon bound to the form of a sword by the church exorcists who sought to bind demons and use their powers for their own bidding. Primarily possessed by the Church Agent Sloan Zabala and was given to him as his personal conceptual weapon that he will be using during his entire membership with the Burial agency. It is said to be able to charm those who look to the edge of its blade, causing victims to break out of desire to possess and touch the sword and once fully immersed in its trance, it would be hard to unbind completely unless there’s something far overwhelming than the sensational desire for it. It is said that it feeds off life energy to which it is used to benefit its wielder, enhancing their physical ability.\n\nEffect: Esva Granz has two abilities:\n\nAsmodian Shine: A passive ability that charms anyone who looks directly at the blade. Even the smallest glints can have a full effect. Considered as a mental debuff effect, that inserts a record of it into its memory, making it so that the second charm effect would become even stronger. Mental pollution or defense against mental effects can reduce its effect.\n\nMana Drain: For every thrust into a living target, drains them of magical energy and vitality and converts it into the sword’s mana, which then can be used to physically boost Seena, giving her superhuman strength and ability beyond typical magecraft reinforcement.\n\nHistory\n\nSeena Gransbury is one of the top ten solo bounty hunters in the world, primarily had lived a life of ruin until one day the 8th contract of St. Croix that she was supposed to be a sacrifice to, choose her to become its wielder and its servant. Together they sought out to satiate the sword’s hunger for vitality and energy.\n\nSeena primarily lived in Marseille and was taken in by someone who thought who’d adopt her as a daughter but instead, she was given a life of absolute filth and ruin that no child deserved. She was a slave, subjected to abuse and to satisfy sexual desires of his lords and masters. It didn't just stop just there, she was sold off to others like an item to trade as a gesture of goodwill and was treated the same way as the last who owned her, tortured as well as rape. She knew nothing of freedom to live with herself, she was robbed of all will and the only thing that matter to her was to survive and to obey her owners without question. She wasn't treated humanely but fortunately fate didn't allow her to die until the moment came when her life changed forever.\n\nIt was at one point when she was sold to an agent of the church under the name of Sloan Zabala, one of the potential candidates from the Shura's Den to become a burial agent, who plans on bedding her and sacrificing her to the 8th contract of St. croix as soon as he’s done with her, stating that she was nothing more than a hollow shell whose purpose is nothing else but to fulfill the desires of men and become a slave from daylight till end. The blade however called out to her and driven her with a new sense of purpose. Before she was about to be sacrificed, she rebelled against the cruel clergy and ended up executing him instead. She was charmed by the blade and started treating it as her true master from here onwards and started killing all the lord she once served. When that was accomplished she began a new life as a bounty hunter, who desired nothing more than to kill for her master, the 8th contract of St. Croix, Esva Granz.\n\nPersonality\n\nSeena is obsessed with the weapon she uses and calls her “Lord” known as Esva Granz, the 8th contract of St. Croix. Ever since obtaining it, it became her companion and gave her a sense of “self.” It also gave her a twisted perception of life similar to that of the typical magus and believes that anyone who desire the sword would be an enemy she must defeat, a rival she must destroy and then offer to the sword itself to satisfy its unending hunger for life energy. She’s cruel, a natural born killer driven in the madness and allure of Esva Granz’s influence, willing to shed her own blood for anything that her master desires but however she doesn’t take a blind eye to anything that might threaten her life and her master’s.\n\nSeena has shown to be quite the normal person you can talk to but some of these conversations involve her putting sentences that would play mind tricks, acting like a devilish witch who’d turn someone’s own belief into the very thing they reject, intended to find the smallest exploit in order to manipulate them for her own gain. Like a vixen, she has great cunning and would gladly face an adversary much greater than herself for that the more powerful the foe, the greater the reap of rewards her master will gain.\n\nExtra Info\n\nSeena’s faceclaim is Zhenhua lou from the anime “Chaos Dragon”\n\nWhile her backstory was easy to formulate, the real challenge was developing the lore for the very sword itself which required a reference to demonology. The reference of St. Croix was given by the roleplayer Murky which suited the entire purpose so well.\n\nSeena had recently engaged in social media but only for the purposes of contacting her clients and coding her messages.\n\nWhen Sloan died, the several branches of the church were debating whether or not to employ her in Zabala’s place or blacklist her as a heretic for possessing the 8th contract. The executor’s den clearly wanted her to become part of the organization while the Burial agency is against the idea, believing that she only kills in service of her own lord.\n\nIt was unknown to others whether or not Seena would decide to join the church but the principles of the said doctrine contradict to the influence of her master’s and therefore an alliance with the church is unlikely.\n\n--------------------\n\nOOC\n\nPartner\n\nFP\n\nPost Count\n\n494\n\n33\n\nTitle\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Cult of Lies\n\nAlignment\n\nMember Group\n\nLawful Good\n\nBanned\n\nThe Archer\n\nSangreal Crusade\n\nParameters - 135FP (FIXED)\n\nSkills - 150FP (FIXED)\n\nMystery - 100FP (FIXED)\n\nName:Irilys Lorelei\n\nFaction: Sangreal Crusade\n\nSpecies: Homonculus\n\nTitle: The Wandering Goddess\n\nParameters\n\nStrength:D\n\nEndurance: D\n\nAgility: B\n\nMana: A\n\nMagic: A\n\nSkills\n\nName of Skill:Material Transmutation\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type: Magecraft\n\nDescription:\n\n[Lore]: Material Transmutation Trinity involves spells that interfere with the properties of an object tackling Reinforcement as the basic, Alteration as the intermediary and Gradation Air Magecraft as the advanced form of its craft. While being a combat homunculus, wielding magical or non-magical weapons would be something an opponent would predict of them to be important, therefore steps and measures were taken to creating Lorelei. She was considered a fine product of trial and error, a homunculus that wields both magical and physical capabilities, allowing a variation of attacks and answering to any situation possible.\n\nReinforcement - It is said to be the most difficult Magecraft with the purpose of pushing a basis to the utmost limit. It is the foundation of all Magecraft that enhance the existence of the target by pouring Magical Energy. It is the same as adding something to an object that is already complete, in case of failure the target will receive it as a poison. Success requires a good grasp of the inner structure to fill openings with Magical Energy.\n\nAlteration – is the intermediary step between Reinforcement and Projection, to give an object a property or effect that it originally didn’t have. Lorelei uses version from Einzbern Alchemy, making the alterations to objects permanent.\n\nGradation Air - is a magecraft that through the use of magical energy materializes objects in accordance to the caster’s imagination. Gradation comes from the fact that the created object slowly fades away after being created and Air is an allusion to the fact that said object is made out of “nothing”. Lorelei has let this skill go, but it is possible in future she will get better with it should she focus on it.\n\n[Effect]:\n\nReinforcement Effect - Lorelei is capable of casting it as single action spell, temporarily enhancing an object or its specified aspect through contact. It lasts for 2 posts. At her current stage she is not capable of self reinforcement.\n\nAlteration Effect - Lorelei is capable of permanently modifying small objects by slightly changing their shape according to its mass. It is single action spell that requires contact with the object. It is possible turn a small iron ball into a needle or perhaps a piece of wood into a sword, however some transformations and reshaping the object may prove incomplete due to its mass.\n\nGradation Air Effect - Lorelei can create physical manifestations of objects by use of her prana. Any projection created by her only lasts for 2 post AT MOST and currently she can create only one projection at a time. The item projected is treated at most as a D rank weapon. The stability of the projected item and its rank depends on her own image of said item, aka how well she knows how it is supposed to look, feel, act, from what it is made, etc. The better the image, the better the quality.\n\nName of Skill:Traditional Arms Mastery\n\nRank: C\n\nSkill Type (optional): Martial Arts\n\nDescription:\n\n[Lore]:It is the skill that employs the use of traditional weapons in the early centuries from the Iron age to the Late Antiquity period. It is possible to learn a variety of weapon techniques passed down by the greatest martial artists. It was basic combat training for the combat homunculi the Einzbern uses, while knowledge is easily transferred over to them by the great archive, experience is deemed to be a greater teacher. While Lorelei had fought several battles years in the aftermath of the previous grail war, she sought peace while acting out of the desire to live like a human being.\n\n[Effect]:Passively allows Lorelei to wield weapons that fall under this category with average skills. These may involve swords, spears, axes, halberds, bows, daggers, etc.\n\nName of Skill:Modern Arms Mastery\n\nRank: C\n\nSkill Type (optional): Skill\n\nDescription:\n\n[Lore]: The knowledge and skill to use various weapons developed by the modern world, employing various firearms, modern equipment and heavy weapons handling. Lorelei took interest guns after reading a manga about a protagonist that uses them. While she does possess a handgun her aim with the firearm is worse than the bow.\n\n[Effect]/i]: Passively allows her knowledge on how to use simple militia type firearms. However due to the low rank, her aim with those weapons is bad. She can only accurately hit when the distance is around five meters, the further away the target the greater the chance of miss. She can also disassemble and assemble the modern arms, but the speed is lacking to be of use during fight.\n\nMysteries\n\nName of Skill:Fail Note: The light that cancels out mystery\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Mystic Code (Broken)\n\nDescription:\n\n[Lore]: An old broken magical artifact that was once a powerful mystic code against magi. It was an item that utilized magical energy to sever the work of magecraft and eliminate manifestation through the use of embedded Curse and Origin. Originally it was an item in possession of an opposing Master from one of the the previous Grail War where Irilys participated in. The name Fail Note was given to the Mystic Code because of its function to disrupt and nullify powerful magical forces. Upon the Master’s defeat, Lorelei had planned to use it as armor. It broke sometime later after the events of the Grail War and though she had this repaired it lost some of its original function and abilities. Currently she cannot bring out its full potential, hence it is only used as an accessory to cover the entire forearm.\n\n[Effect]: Treated as a piece of armor it's possible to make use of this item to block a physical attack that holds a strength parameter equivalent to the item and may only reduce damage that's a rank above, thought to easily break by another beyond that. It passively grants her E magic resistance which means that any damage received from magecraft of rank equal to the rank of the artefact is slightly reduced.\n\nHistory\n\n“You may not remember who I am but I do know that I’m no hero. Just a protector.”\n\nLorelei is a homunculus of the einzberns designated to become one of the personal servants and escort of the magi family’s participant of the last Holy Grail War. She had but one purpose, to protect Irilys von Einzbern and see to the fulfillment of the Einzbern’s long standing wish, to realize the Heaven’s Feel. For the previous grail war she was dispatched along with 2 homonculi including the chosen master of the grail. She was presumed dead after failing to protect the previous master.\n\nThe thought of them being just mere creations for the Einzbern’s benefit didn’t seem to bother them, content with who they are and what they do. While having attended to her objectives, Lorelei was an oddity among her fellow kin, she wanted to see more of the world and go beyond the walls of the castle alongside with her sisters one day once they managed to obtain the Holy Grail. Within that period she had gotten her small wish but that was during a selection test for the homunculi created for combat. While she had spent time practicing within the walls, the Einzbern alchemists decided that actual experience may bring them even better results rather that simulated tests in a reality marble, some were even sent to different biomes to evaluate how they would survive under weather conditions while fighting dangerous familiars created by the family itself. Some spanned for miles or kilometers even, each faced with difficult obstacles, faced with adversity and situations where they would run out of mana or had limited options. Some died and were met with gruesome deaths while others degraded over the course of the entire trial. Out of the 50 homonculi, only 5 survived the entire experiment and Lorelei was one of them. While having received experience over combat and survival she silently mourned for each of her fallen kin while going forward, she did valued life after all. She thought that they didn’t want to die or rather had not deserved it but who was she to question the Einzbern’s methods? They were looking for the best combat homunculi after all.\n\nAfterwards Lorelei was reassigned to become one of the maidens for the new homunculus who then became a selected participant of the grand ritual known as the Holy Grail War. Her name was Irilys von Einzbern, her model comes after the same as Lorelei’s, technically making them sisters or two birds of a feather. For the first time in her life she found family in the little girl unlike the other alchemists and homunculi tho having knew that Irilys would soon met with an inevitable fate, she stood by her side till the end of their days.\n\n“Listen to me as I say this… once you go to war, you can never return home”\n\nIrilys alongside her servant fought and won over 2 battles and it was all they could ever accomplish. They lost in the third battle, while two sides have lost both their servants Irilys only had Lorelei by her side to defend her. In fact she wanted Irilys to escape but her efforts were all for naught and in the end the injured Lorelei could only watch helplessly as her younger sister was skewered and left for dead. In the last few moments, Lorelei crawled over to Irilys and mourn for her after she sang the very melody that she was named after. Having lost purpose, she thought that she was better off dead but fate had other plans.\n\n“If only I had the same power as theirs… I would have stopped it from happening”\n\nShe was rescued by an elderly couple and was nursed back to health. After recovering she introduced herself as Irilys Lorelei as if not to forget her little sister and remind her of what happened that day. The Grail war was past behind her and decided to move forward with a goal in mind. To live the normal life of a human as her sister Irilys wanted.\n\nWhile she did, old habits die hard as she took upon the role of an urban legend known as the Crimson Sword Dancer, functioning to protect the innocent. Assailants hire to kill certain individuals like Seitianshi were thwarted by her alone, however this earned enemies. Top guns, street sweepers and other mercenary groups who were victims to her actions are out for blood in hopes to find her and kill her before she ruins more of their contracts with her interventions.\n\nPersonality\n\nB.C. (Before Crisis)\n\nMagi – Just like most of the homunculus created for the purposes of engagement and the protection of the family, Lorelei knew the importance of her duties as a homunculi magus. She was known to have taken her job seriously (resembling more like Leysritt in a way) and took pride in becoming one of the top homunculi worthy to become combatants and protectors of the castle. Analytical and always looked for a way around the problem, surviving the entire trial the einzberns had laid out of her and her fellow kin validated this.\n\nHomonculus – Her generation’s homunculi were based off several models of their past selves, formal and loyal to their creators. The Homonculi’s relationship to each other was maintained under the pretense that they served under the same faction, in other words they are nothing more than work partners. Lorelei was a different case as she came to value life when she was just a year old. This deepen even more when she experienced the Einzbern trials and her time serving as Irily’s personal maid, becoming more human as the months pass by. To her Irilys seemed like the only family she had in the entire castle.\n\nA.D. (After Death)\n\nMagi – While having retained her abilities as a magi, experience became the foundation of her improvement, deciding to take constructive and creative ideas in order to benefit from any situation she was put in. While having failed the Einzberns and was presumed dead, she took advantage of this and faked her death.\n\nAs Irilys Lorelei – While her name was the sole reminder of what happened in her past, she looks towards the future, acting out of the desire of her deceased sister and eventually developed her own personality. Her childish habits involved manga, playing video games and dressing up, sometimes walking around in the house with no clothes, working around in random places and do what any girl would do in her day and age. Her hobbies in manga had her take up the role of a mysterious heroine known as the crimson sword dancer, the one who protects the innocent from the guilty.\n\nShe is cheerful and outgoing, upbeat and generally exhibits a positive attitude. Possessing a friendly demeanor, she is easy to talk to and tends to be playful and mischievous.\n\nExtra Info\n\nIrilys Lorelei is a character derrived from Fate/Sword Dancers's heroine Archerko by Himura Yuu.\n\nHeight: 5.6ft\n\nWeight: 47kg\n\nVoice: Haruka Tomatsu\n\nShe dyed her hair yellow in the aftermath of the previous grail war.\n\nThe name Lorelei comes from the old German words lureln, Rhine dialect for \"murmuring\", and the Celtic term ley \"rock\". The translation of the name would therefore be: \"murmur rock\" or \"murmuring rock\".\n\nIrilys was her sister's name given to them due to their possession of the Mystic Eyes of Archive which allows full comprehension of magecraft.\n\n--------------------\n\nOOC\n\nPartner\n\nFP\n\nPost Count\n\n494\n\n33\n\nTitle\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Cult of Lies\n\nAlignment\n\nMember Group\n\nLawful Good\n\nBanned\n\nThe Lancer\n\nIndependent\n\nParameters - 165FP (FIXED)\n\nSkills - 255FP (FIXED)\n\nMystery - 100FP (FIXED)\n\nTotal - 520FP\n\nName: Arcades Rothwild\n\nFaction: Independent\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nTitle: Embodiment of Famine\n\nParameters\n\nStrength: B\n\nEndurance: C\n\nAgility: B\n\nMana: B\n\nMagic: C\n\nSkills\n\nName of Skill:Toxicology\n\nRank: A\n\nSkill Type (optional): Knowledge\n\nDescription: Toxicology is a medical field of science concerned with the nature, effects of poisons. It is also known that those who would use toxins to kill foes tend to ingest some of it to develop antibodies and strengthen immunity towards that kind of poison. While it is not possible formulate an antidote to all kinds of poison, resistance and longevity of the lifespan once expose to these kinds of incurable poisons would have increased significantly.\n\n[Effect]: Grants Arcades an extremely high resistance to most types of poison known across the world though it doesn’t grant full immunity to any toxin classified to B rank or above rather decrease the effectiveness of such poisons. Toxins that were brewed with great mastery from the Age of the Gods can overcome Arcades’ resistance to poison.\n\nAdditionally he can also apply poison to his own attacks, physical or magical in nature.\n\nName of Skill:Curses\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional): Knowledge/Magecraft\n\nDescription: \"All curses will bring misfortune by not all coincidences are curses.\" ~Arcades Rothwild\n\nA field of magecraft that involves completely altercating one’s true nature, the very thing that signifies one’s existence in this world, and violate it by imposing or rewriting it through the intervention of shadows. From the primitive to the most potent, each curse induces phenomenon to act upon and roots from resentment. And it is because of curses are how most known taboos in the world are formed, some even worst than others. Thus the true nature of curses is the alteration of one’s true nature and takes the form of a grudge.\n\nMuch to his familiarity in the field, he is capable of performing curses, performing counter curses and to physically deliver a curse, or embed a curse to an object.\n\n[Effect]: Grants Arcades the ability to inflict a curse upon the target, which can either lower a chosen physical parameter stat or between a mana rank and a luck related skill by one. C rank resistances related to curses may deter such from working. It is possible to afflict the curse to the target through physical means or by embedding it into an object.\n\nIts possible for him to dispel a casted Geas C rank and below.\n\nIt is also possible for Arcades to perform a counter curse that is equivalent to his own proficiency of curses.\n\nAesthetically can dictate the conditions of the curse given player consent should a curse be successfully casted.\n\nIf a curse was successfully casted upon a target in a thread after 6 posts, doubles the severity of the curse, doubles again after 12 posts and so on. The rank of the curse MUST remain the same regardless.\n\nName of Skill:Beast Magecraft\n\nRank: C\n\nSkill Type (optional): Magecraft/Body Modification\n\nDescription: Beastial Magecraft\n\nC\n\nIt is a field that allows one to gain the characteristics and instincts of an animal through the integration with its spirit. Its magecraft is usually popular amongst shamanistic groups since its practice is related. The higher the proficiency, the greater your senses.\n\n[Effects]: Enhanced animal senses – Can have animal senses from the same class group, in this case Arcades is the avian\n\nBestial inversion - Enhancement of the body which mimics physical capabilities of an animal. Most of the body takes on a physical appearance of a beast. Lasts for 6 posts.\n\nName of Skill:Alchemy: Body Modification\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional): Magecraft\n\nDescription: Body modification is one of the trademark magecraft of the mages from sea of estray. It is common application that involves biological modification of organic bodies, these may apply towards familiars, coining of homunculi or self modification of the body. Arcades specialization is focused on bodily resistance to poisons and enhancement.\n\n[Effect]:\n\nPoison Immunity: Additional resistance to all toxins\n\nLesser Regeneration: Arcades can regenerate small wounds easily and can heal major injuries slightly faster than the average human being.\n\nMysteries\n\nName of Skill: Hectate: The Deliverer\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Weapon/Lance\n\nDescription: Hectate is the name of Arcades’s personal lance, its name was derived from the goddess of magic, night, moon, ghosts and necromancy. It was primarily his training lance that was smelted and reforged to serve as the base of the Hectate, reinforced with Titanium ingot for extra durability. The pointed blade itself was forged with different materials, a mix of Macedonian silver and one of the legendary treasures of nautical mythology, the hydra’s poisonous gland which was found by the Sea of Estray 70 years ago. Out of the three recovered, only one of them remained with Dr. Rothwild.\n\nHectate was forged after realizing the potential of his research and its contributions to biological warfare. The Hectate’s power was experimented on different specimens, regular ones and those with a special immunity to poisons. Perhaps one of the most powerful pole arms of the modern world ever to be created.\n\n[Effect]: Hectate is a deadly weapon, as a lance of its class it can potentially tear through body armor given the enough amount of force. The weapon isn’t lethal unless its activated by the wielder or coated with a different poison. Activating the lance requires the wielder to flow prana into it, triggering a faint purple in the tip of the blade caused by the function of the Hydra’s poisonous gland. When the poison in the gland has been produced, a black silvery smoke would envelop the entire pointed blade coating the blade with the Hydra’s poison and a thaumaturgical curse as if replicating the mystery of the fatality of the Hydra’s deadly poison. While the Hydra’s poison affects biological functions upon ingestion, the curse around it is meant to reduce defenses completely but one rank and reduces regeneration effects by two ranks. Complete Lethality.\n\nHistory\n\nThey were a lineage of alchemist who specialized more into the medical field since the mid - 1500s.\n\nTheir research follows the three humors from Paracelsus, namely the Tria Prima, basic components used in order to arrive to a certain cure to a disease. After Hohenheim’s achievements, they had dedicated themselves to practice what he had left behind and further expand on his research if at all possible. However, one of Arcades’ forefathers had foreseen something about the future in which in this case, ingredients to cure ailments may one day be limited and be driven to a point of scarcity.\n\nIn order to solve such crisis, he completely abandoned his family for his work to find the ultimate vaccine that can permanently cure all known diseases of the world, a sustainable component to which will eliminate the shortage of medicine.\n\nThough the last anyone’s heard from this forefather was before his trip to England.\n\nIn the absence of the forefather, the family struggled with dwindling resources and without the proper instruction from the forefather, nearly more than half of the family’s secrets was lost with him.\n\nThus in order to prevent any further ruin, they were to marry into a family that belonged to one of the 12 Lords of the Clocktower at the time, thus securing their future at the cost of having all their research surrendered.\n\nIn the early years, Arcades Rothwild outshined the heir in both academics and magecraft and grew to becoming a candidate to becoming part of Jigmarie’s faculty of curses.\n\nThough it came at the cost of his arm from an accident a few years back, he is now more than ever determined to perform the family’s works and represent them as one of the many faces to the proud family of Rothwild.\n\nPersonality\n\nArcades is known to be a ruthless man who found purpose and desire through his line of work, creating toxins for his consumers. Being a traditional magi, Arcades can never hope to understand of Arcadia Network’s goals and visions, believing that there is more to it than just getting magic exposed to social media. He is someone with ambition and sees toxins and poisons as an opportunity to write a name for himself in the pages of history. As of now Dr. Rothwild has completely forgotten his original purpose for researching poisons, to concoct the greatest formula that can mitigate the effects of even the most incurable poisons. Because of how much power and potential his specialization brings he became arrogant and believes that he has become more powerful than the founding heads of the Mages Association and have gone rouge.\n\nAlthough there were no actions taken to cause strife between him and the entirety of the Mages Association, for every passing moment, Arcades would pull himself closer and closer to realize his ultimate goal. A poison that can’t be cured, a poison that can even slay the greatest of phantasmal beasts. The embodiment of Famine, the realization of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse.\n\nIn terms of battle, he considers himself not as a fighter but as a hunter to which he considers his opponent his prey despite the gap and difference in power, it was a mindset that came along with the fruits of his research, to prove not only his skills as a hunter but the gravity and power that goes with his achievements in his craft.\n\nExtra Info\n\nArcades Rothwild is 38 years old\n\nArcades stands at a height of 176cm\n\nArcades weighs 59kg\n\nIn some proposed plots for Arcades apart from his search for the ultimate recipe for poison, it could be hinted that he could be solely responsible for crippling the evreux’s heir with an incurable cancer while at the same time could be the only man that can cure him.\n\nRumors of Arcades associating with a Dead Apostle is only reserved for a possible plot, however unintended.\n\nHe owns several laboratories across the world dedicated to make the finest of poisons, some were just psychotic drugs. This makes him one of the most powerful drug lords in the world.\n\nArcades defecting from the Sea of Estray is purely because he doesn’t trust the Salem Foundation and the Yggdmillenia factions and hated the idea of exposing magecraft to social media.\n\nLike the typical magi he seeks the root only to realize and become the first to create the ultimate poison fatal enough to even afflict those that existed outside of mortality.\n\nArcades’s Face Claim is Gunter from the Fire Emblem series.\n\nThere is also mention that he could have met Madame Nicola at some point before the Arcadia Network was founded. He considers her his rival.\n\n--------------------\n\nOOC\n\nPartner\n\nFP\n\nPost Count\n\n494\n\n33\n\nTitle\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Cult of Lies\n\nAlignment\n\nMember Group\n\nLawful Good\n\nBanned\n\nThe Card\n\nOrganization\n\nParameters - Number of FP?\n\nSkills - Number of FP?\n\nMystery - Number of FP?\n\nTotal - Total Number of FP?\n\nName: Vincent Moriarty\n\nFaction: The Sangreal Crusade\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nTitle: The Pioneer of Tomorrow\n\nParameters\n\nStrength:E\n\nEndurance: D\n\nAgility: E\n\nMana: C\n\nCraft: A\n\nSkills\n\nName of Skill: Item Creation\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Magecraft Skill\n\nDescription: Item Creation is one of the many specializations taught in the basic schools of thaumaturgy. Vincent’s talents lean towards this skill, from the time that he was a young boy, he would continue to create new items everyday each with its own different function and with its own magic circuit, some of them may not require such at all and are unique in every way possible. They can be used to perform the most simple of tasks perfectly such as maintain a bounded field for long lasting periods of time, tools used to assist him in further development of more mystic codes and some of which can be used to generate power or charge energy into one to the point that nearly goes beyond mastery. Better tools to create better mystic codes, equipment that can refine materials better and more, name it… he’s a young man with a passion for what he does, a prodigy that had exceeded if not far surpassed his family’s expectations.\n\n[Effect]: Allows Vincent to craft fine Mystic Codes to aid him or better tools to create better ones. Creating modern tech may become a menial task for him, it makes it possible for him to create the finest of magical cores and generators for specific items or anything that may require such power source.\n\nName of Skill: Familiar Creation: Clockwork Automata\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Magecraft Skill\n\nDescription: It is no secret that Vincent was into buying and building gunpla model kits and various other things that allows him to build toy mechs and the like, as they would serve as an inspiration to his own work. For a young inventor such as himself, he would have wanted to make toys of his own at some point but perhaps toys that are even better, who can think for themselves and be more human-like than most cybernetic figurines. Hence he dive deep into the works of creating automata, from simple woodwork to a mechanized framework of either gears or strings, hoping to be one of the greatest and first innovators of his own work, namely the clockwork automata.\n\n[Effect]: Allows Vincent to design and create unique automatons who will serve under him to assist in his work and to act as his bodyguards, each with their own sense of individuality and would replicate human personality. In this case, all familiars created by Vincent will be classified as Clockworks.\n\nName of Skill: Atlesian Magecraft\n\nRank: NULL\n\nType: School of Magecraft\n\nDescription: Atlesian magecraft, also known as the magecraft of atlas, is defined by their incredible ability to think and perform calculations on the go while adapting to situations and coming up with a solution in a matter of seconds, cutting the time it takes to think of prep work, the fast creations of various formulas in order to arrive to the desired result. While Vincent has not been formally part of atlas (given that he wants to enroll into their school), he is capable of Thought acceleration.\n\n[Effect]:Thought Acceleration: The capability of Moriarty to create a series of calculations in order to arrive to a designated answer in a small span of time. While capable, basic exercises to further increase this skill has not been introduced.\n\nMemory Partition: the ability to partition their thoughts to form multiple independent thought processes. Vincent may have been capable of making 2 rooms at once, however with no known training methods, such is unlikely for this skill.\n\nMysteries\n\nName: Mobile Suit: Andromeda\n\nRank: E\n\nType: Magical Item/Equipment\n\nElement: None\n\nDescription:\n\n[Effect]:\n\nHistory\n\nVincent Moriarty is a young mage who dreamed of becoming one of the world’s greatest inventors of his time. In recent times he’s been trying to get a chance to study at atlas.\n\nVincent Moriarty comes from a young 400 year old family line of mages whom excel in the creation of mystic codes. He was born in Bristol but grew up in Winchester 2 months after he was born. Vincent came with a knack for building improvised toys made from unusual materials, but it didn’t stop there. He even tried to create household appliances out of recycled materials, however he realized that everything he made out of recycled materials don't have any integrity and all. Even in the case that he uses proper materials, some of the improvised inventions and gizmos either malfunction or were proven unstable but he never gave up and gotten better at it.\n\nIn basic elementary, he excels at mathematics and basic science, people refer to him as “James Moriarty” from the Sherlock Holmes novel series, as both Vincent and James share a proficiency in mathematics. There were times where he would simply bring some of his inventions from home to school to show everyone, one time he brought a mystic code he invented from school which caused a small fire accident in his classroom. As punishment for his misbehavior, Vincent dropped school for only a year before coming back again.\n\nEver since then till the end of high school, he stopped bringing inventions he created, with the exception of the science fairs held every year. Upon graduation, his parents sent him to the London clock tower to study as a mage but dropped its freshmen classes because he wanted to go to Atlas Academy instead, believing that the institute can teach him what he really wanted to learn, or better yet a place that can appreciate inventions.\n\nAt present, he’s been trying to get in but failed the entrance exams multiple times as the requirements for atlas were strict.\n\nPersonality\n\nVincent’s passion lies into inventing new things, but every time he presents something or performs a field test, it would always end in failure, sometimes blowing out of proportion or nearly costing his life. He’s a magus that loves and knows how to handle modern day gadgets unlike his parents and would sometimes try to dissect it, open a brand new product and see the contents on how a machine would work and try to make a version of his own with cheaper materials. He was always so reluctant to show off his inventions to everyone just to get feedback, he’d sometimes drag a poor unsuspecting person into one of his field experiments with a 60% chance of failure.\n\nHe had always looked up to history’s inventors as they were those that founded the technology of today and aspires to become one of them. He loves collecting building model kits like a mechanical drone or a Japanese Gunpla as a hobby and would often try to mash them up together to create something new.\n\nHe comes off as a positive person upon first impression, and whenever he sees you having some sort of cool looking modern day gadget, he would not hesitate to try and take a closer look. Same goes for power tools, new cars and if you’re from the military, military equipment.\n\nIn recent times, he’s into making automata and the like as well as suits of armor.\n\nExtra Info\n\nVincent Moriarty’s faceclaim is Kensuke Hanasake from the anime “Trickster.” Original faceclaim ideas meant for him to have that steampunk look, however such art can’t be found to meet that visual impact.\n\nVincent is currently 21 years old considering he skipped a full year of regular education. His birthday is on the July 21st.\n\nThe character was named after the author’s grandfather whom he revered much, and Moriarty was taken as a surname out of favoritism for James Moriarty. He was primarily to be named James Moriarty but the name Vincent sufficed instead in order to avoid any friction with names between original characters and canon.\n\nThe part of him taking interest in making mobile suits and newly designed and lifelike automatas were based from old character ideas but never met full completion or simply because their stories never correlate to site story.\n\nHis entire profile replaced the idea of Davy Jones whom returned to the world through the Grand Grail war, believed to be lost at sea many years ago.\n\n--------------------\n\nOOC\n\nPartner\n\nFP\n\nPost Count\n\n494\n\n33\n\nTitle\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Cult of Lies\n\nAlignment\n\nMember Group\n\nLawful Good\n\nBanned\n\nThe Caster\n\nYggdmillenia\n\nParameters - 120FP (FIXED)\n\nSkills - 180FP (FIXED)\n\nMystery - 100FP (FIXED)\n\nTOTAL - 400FP\n\nName: Adolf Schuttler Yggdmillenia\n\nFaction: Yggdmillenia\n\nSpecies: Magus\n\nTitle: The Invoker\n\nParameters\n\nStrength: D\n\nEndurance: D\n\nAgility: C\n\nMana: A\n\nMagic: B\n\nSkills\n\nName of Skill: Alchemy\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional): Magecraft\n\nDescription: Alchemy is one of the many schools of magecraft said to mimic the mysteries of the manipulation of the flow of matter. While the knowledge of general alchemy is inaccessible to Adolf because he belonged to Yggdmillenia, within the clan was a man who knew and taught Adolf its principles from the general to the unorthodox methods.\n\n[Effect 1]: Transmutation – A granted ability to purify metals, base components, to redirect the flow of energy and the creation of items available through the process of alchemy. Adolf developed an application of this for combat purposes; to transmit Magical Energy through his Mystic Code, allowing him to manifest spells without any adverse effects on the body.\n\n[Effect 2]: Coining – the term used to describe the process of creating artificial humans known as the Homonculi. Adolf is capable of creating Homonculi created by him lack a sense of self. Should there be a self-aware homunculi would be extremely rare. These Homonculi may either serve as magical containers or his personal foot soldiers and servants.\n\nName of Skill: Kabbalah: Numerology\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional): Magecraft\n\nDescription: Numerology is a branch of the Kabbalah Thaumaturigcal theory that mostly sees connections between mathematical proportions and constant, and events. It’s a belief, seeking pattern to which the underlying engine can generate phenomena and such of its applications can be translated and contacted by using mathematical perceptions. It also applies the basic principles derived from Gematria, an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code that assigns numeric value to a word/name/phrase, and Terumah (in Hebrew means gift or offering) is the second principle that grants its mysteries its function and instruction.\n\nThe system is based on the idea of creating magical algorithms and formulas that modifies specific spells, usually done by creating glyphs. These spells may allow increase in magical power or decrease it to an amount, delay spell activation for a brief time period or be detonated earlier.\n\n[Effect]: Grants Adolf knowledge over Numerology and the use of its applications to his magecraft.\n\nName of Skill: High-Speed Incantation\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type (optional):Magecraft\n\nDescription: High-Speed Incantation is a method of arias used by the modern magi, allowing incantations to be chanted at a faster pace. Through its practice, it allows quick action and response time in and between casting spells, reducing the cast time requirement in half the normal time.\n\n[Effect]: Grants Adolf the skill and aptitude to cast spells faster, reciting 3 lines faster in a second.\n\nMysteries\n\nName of Skill:Blitz, Veil, Helios: The Magister’s Triad\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Mystic Code\n\nDescription: The Magister’s Triad is a Mystic Code created based on the principles of both Alchemy and Numerology system. They are three ball shaped reagents that are used to manifest most of Adolf’s spells. Each ball holds a specific element and supposedly represent the three factions that make up the magi society. Blitz (Wind) represents the Atlas Academy, Veil (Water), represents the Sea of Estray and Exort (Fire) represents London Clocktower. They work on the base of 3 and allows him to cast 10 spell combinations, the process is done with all three orbs taking on each other’s form to manifest a formula.\n\n[Effect 1]: BLITZ – Blitz is an iron ball, appearing to be the most exposed reagent of the triad with small sparks of electricity escaping its body. It allows Adolf to send a power bolt of electricity, firing from Blitz or any of its active instances and has the fastest projectile speed in the Triad. A direct hit would be enough to paralyze the target with the exception of magic resistance. If a target is hit by any spell affiliated with Blitz, they are tracked, causing the next offensive spell to prioritize the tracked target and only a single target can be tracked at a time. Consecutive bolts may completely shut down the peripheral nervous system at least, further exposure would shut down the entire nervous system instead. It is possible to actually energize inactive devices for a brief period of time with a single bolt. Spell combinations performed with active Blitz instances adds a single line incantation and posses a green color code.\n\n[Effect 2]: VEIL – Veil is a gaseous ball surrounded by condensed air, hence its misty appearance. Veil’s instances can fire a hard shard of ice towards a target by collecting the condensed air surrounding it. On hit, the target will have their body heat drained out of the impaled area. Passively gives a rank in physical regeneration for every existing Veil instances stacking up to C rank. Spell combinations performed with active Veil instances adds a double line incantation, possessing the blue color code.\n\n[Effect 3]: HELIOS – Helios is an illuminated ball of heat that can be ignited to a ball of fire upon casting a spell. It is the most powerful reagent in the triad and can shoot out a fire ball capable of setting the target aflame. Consecutive strikes may reduce the target to ashes with the exception of them having some form of resistance to fire, leaving them with a bad burn at best. As long as Helios exists it amplifies the damage of any offensive spell, making it the most destructive and yet the most costly of the Triad, the more instances of Helios, the more powerful the spell. Spell combinations performed with active Helios instances adds a triple line incantation, possessing the red color code.\n\nPyroclasm: Eye of Apollo\n\nNumerology Code: Helios, Helios, Helios\n\nDescription: This uses 3 Helios instances, making them orbit above him to create an incendiary element at the center. He can fire it at a target and cause the projectile to be set ablaze, creating an explosion up to 25 meters in diameter. Cooldown 5 posts. 6 posts if buffed by other effects.\n\nTrailBlaze: Chain Dragon Arc Lightning\n\nNumerology Code: Helios, Helios, Blitz\n\nDescription: Allows Adolf to shoot forth a living snake like beam of fire and electrical energy that seeks out nearby targets. Every subsequent target the Trailblaze hits reduces its damage and bounces off targets to the fifth and final target before returning back to Adolf or dissipating completely. Trailblaze’s trajectory can be manipulated by Adolf allowing it to dodge obstruction and spell intercepts. It has a cooldown of 4 posts, whereas its reduced to 2 if the dragon returns to Adolf successfully.\n\nSoulbound Tracker:The Lost Hound of Wolfstein\n\nNumerology Code: Helios, Helios, Veil\n\nDescription: A spell that causes the three orbs to project a steam apparition in a form of a wolf. It runs forth and chases its designated target, blasting them with hot steam that can leave a burnt mark. Apparition lasts 2 to 3 posts with a cool down of two.\n\nFrostbite: Crippling death\n\nNumerology Code: Veil, Veil, Veil\n\nDescription: This spell that can only be activated if a target’s temperature levels have decreased down to significant levels. On any open wounds, no matter how big or how small, small crystals of ice will start to form around it, lowering the target’s body temperature even further, freezes a blood cell and extends to the circulatory system. The duration of this spell is equivalent to how many times the target was hit by Veil as well as its cooldown after. Fatality would cause the ice to expand to the point that it would be powerful enough to nearly freeze a living body, depriving them of oxygen due to extreme low temperatures.\n\nBorealis: The Frost Monarch’s Wall\n\nNumerology Code: Veil, Veil, Helios\n\nDescription: Materializes a defensive wall, uprooted from the ground or through condensed air, creating a defensive measure against physical attacks. This wall can either be molded towards one direction or around adolf. Cooldown of 2 posts.\n\nPhasewalker: Path of Evanescence\n\nNumerology Code: Veil, Veil, Blitz\n\nDescription: Adds a rank of agility, allows him to hover or glide. The duration of the spell is indefinite until he casts another spell combination or removes all instances of Blitz.\n\nArk Blast: Lightning Bomb\n\nNumerology Code: Blitz, Blitz, Blitz\n\nDescription:All three Bltiz instances invest magical energy by creating and charging an unstable singularity of electrical energy. After a brief period of time, the energy charged in the singularity is released, either by letting lose 3 thunderbolts or sending out an electrical pulse wave that disables electric powered devices, reaching to a range of a 100 meters in diameter. A fully matured Ark Blast can be near fatal to the human body upon hit. It takes 2 posts to detonate it completely and detonates early if a tracked target is within 30 meters of Adolf. 5 post cooldown.\n\nStorm Tornado: The Dragon’s Wing\n\nNumerology Code: Blitz, Blitz, Veil\n\nDescription: Storm Tornado is a spell that creates a small and powerful twister by means of rotating both Blitz instances around Veil at high speeds. This can be casted as a raging projectile that only lasts for 2 posts, knocking up or tossing aside anything that stands in its path or be casted around adolf to cause incoming projectiles to deviate. 3 post cooldown\n\nFlame Crown: He who is Ifreet\n\nNumerology Code: Blitz, Blitz, Helios\n\nDescription: Alacrity is a spell combination that causes the two blitz instances to orbit around the Helios instance, materializing a tri pointed projectile from above and shooting towards a target. 2 post cooldown\n\nTrinity Force: Magic Blast of the three Reagents\n\nNumerology Code: Blitz, Veil, Helios\n\nDescription: A spell combination that requires 1 instance of Blitz, 1 instance of Veil and 1 instance of Helios. It fires off a huge projectile of elemental energy, embodying fire, water and wind altogether. Upon detonation, contact or having arrived the extent of its range, it will decimate an area and bathe it in harmful magical energy. 4 post cooldown\n\nHistory\n\nAdolf Geishct Yggdmillenia is a magi of the Yggdmillenia by blood and shall be the running heir to rule over the entirety of the faction. While having to share the same sentiments and acknowledged his family’s goals to obtaining the Holy Grail, Adolf had different plans for the organization to one day he will reshape Yggdmillenia altogether.\n\nBefore World War II, the Yggdmillenia were an aristocratic family of nobles that used to live in Germany. One of the heads of the Yggdmillenia was part of the Axis army led under Hitler’s dictatorship, working for the Wolfstein Research and Excavation teams. At the time they believed in the existence of supernatural artifacts that can act as superpowers to aid the Axis in its campaign. The existence of this research unit cannot be found on any of its government papers or records of it in the Mages Association despite the fact that some of its members were magi. The only ones that knew of this group’s existence were a few of the high Reich and Hitler himself.\n\nWhen D-day came, the Wolfstein Research and Excavation teams were cut off due to the allies surrounding the nation, without any safe routes to the Fatherland, they were nothing more than isolated units. At the time they would have recovered several artifacts and relics that not even the Mages Association nor the Holy church discovered yet. By the time Berlin would have fallen, the decision came that the entire group would either sell the relics and split profits or keep some of it for themselves. Of course the Yggdmillenia head had other plans.\n\nWith the excavation unit gone, its soldiers and the magi that worked alongside Yggdmillenia murdered, the relic and artifacts retrieved came under his ownership and were hidden from the Mages Association and the Church ever since. In later events the existence of the Holy Grail was introduced and Adolf’s Grandfather participated in the counterfeit wars. In its conclusion it was revealed that the Grail was fake.\n\nSo it was all down to the Yggdmillenia line to pursue the Holy Grail and monitor all of its related activities in hopes to accomplish what Adolf Grandfather can’t. As of present, Adolf will be the next heir to the Yggdmillenia faction.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs the young patriarch of Yggdmillenia, Adolf shows promise to become the next successor of the family and the new head of the organization, sharing the same views as how Yggdmillenia would monopolize magecraft. Others commented that he was just as ambitious as his Grandfather was but took a different approach as he did, believing at while obtaining the Holy Grail was a golden opportunity for Yggdmillenia to prove a fierce competitor of the magi society, and he sought alternative means.\n\nHe held superiority complex towards the other magi societies, believing that despite whatever the Yggdmillenia has achieved would be undeserving for the world to know and the fact that they are part of the Arcadia Network irks him to the core. He thinks of his Father and his Grandfather’s arrangement in allying with the Arcadia Network a desperate act of conformism because Yggdmillenia has not made any headway in the previous grail wars leading them to be belittled by the Sangreal Crusade. For he believed the Yggdmillenia now is more capable than just becoming participants of a massive Grail war and great magi. To him they were a sharpened blade waiting for the right man to wield it.\n\nIn general, Adolf is known to be quite a flirt when it comes to women regardless of their gender, some would suggest that he can be a womanizer and when he sets his eye on someone, he disregards others and becomes flamboyant but not to the extremes.\n\nExtra Info\n\nAdolf's Faceclaim is none other than Adolf K. Weissmann from the anime K. Primarily was selected in search of a man who looked as German as Darnic Prestone Yggdmillenia. The one responsible for this suggestion was Whammy, a roleplayer of past Type-moon forums.\n\nAdolf stands at a height of 6.1ft and weighs about 146lbs.\n\nThe name Geischt was derived from an existing username of a roleplayer who used to have a character affiliated with Yggdmillenia that had so much plot potential but fail to see to its fruition because of the lack of activity.\n\nPrimarily there was need for search of a unique magecraft for Adolf, while the concept of DOTA 2's Invoker was adopted, it wasn't the first choice.\n\n--------------------\n\nOOC\n\nPartner\n\nFP\n\nPost Count\n\n494\n\n33\n\nTitle\n\nAdvanced Member\n\nOrganization\n\nThe Cult of Lies\n\nAlignment\n\nMember Group\n\nLawful Good\n\nBanned\n\nThe Assassin\n\nNone/Rouge\n\nParameters - 135FP (FIXED)\n\nSkills - 255FP (FIXED)\n\nMystery - 120FP (Subject to change)\n\nTOTAL - 510FP\n\nName: Xander Papadopoulos\n\nFaction: None/ Rouge\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nTitle: The Terror of Luxembourg\n\nParameters\n\nStrength:C\n\nEndurance: C\n\nAgility: B\n\nMana: C\n\nMagic: C\n\nSkills\n\nName of Skill:Elemental Magecraft - Wind Specializaiton\n\nRank: C\n\nSkill Type (optional): Magecraft\n\nDescription: The Wind Affinity magecraft is one of the Great Five Elements that deals with air, kinetic forces, static energy, free energy and directed movement. Xander was taught the basic principles and applied it to his skills and techniques. With Xander’s aptitude for Wind Affiliated Magecraft, his tutor believes that if he were to possess a natural amount of magic circuits a magician has, he would have been a force to reckon with.\n\n[Effect 1]: He has the ability to summon a powerful and harmless gust of wind that knocks foes back given that they haven’t raised their guard. Course the distance of the knock back depends on how much force was exerted and the mass of their bodies. A full grown man may be knocked back 50 meters away at best. This wind may also be able to blow and send back projectiles away or cause them to deviate and miss. This technique may be utilized in his own attacks.\n\nName of Skill:Obfuscation\n\nRank: A\n\nSkill Type (optional):Ability\n\nDescription: Obfuscation is the ability to hide one’s presence or reduce it down to a level whereas nobody would notice. Xander is a master of espionage, stealth and subterfuge, making him a capable spy which allows him to gather information, making it possible to even bypass high level security in order to do so. While this may have not been on his political resume, this skill has been honed before he was taken in by nobility as he mainly uses this to sneak in to steal food and small amounts of money. However a servant may be able to detect their presence or any form of magical device that can detect “Living existences.”\n\n[Effect]: Conceals Xander’s presence out of combat, allowing him to go stealth. It is possible for him to sneak into a Mage’s boundary field (Rank B ) without being detected and bypass high level security and surveillance magical devices by using internal magecraft.\n\nName of Skill:Marksmanship\n\nRank: B\n\nSkill Type: Ability\n\nDescription: Xander is known to have a good aim, which was improved much later when he came into a political position. His level of precision matches that of a complete professional but not to a level of total accuracy. While versed in using a sword, shooting wasn’t his field of specialization as he never held a projectile weapon before. Even after having been trained to use the pistol, he comments that he lacks creative vision in shooting from a distance whom which the professional sweepers agree.\n\n[Effect]: Xander has increased accuracy when it comes to firing off projectiles. This may include throwing daggers as well. Apart from his preferences of using the pistol and the sleeve crossbow, he can also use a variety of firearms. This ability is only reserved to make him effective in shooting but not reloading nor proper use of weapons handling. He cannot perform “Double ups” or “Ricochet shots” like how underworld sweepers can as he’s more of a melee type fighter.\n\nName of Skill:Bladework\n\nRank: A\n\nSkill Type: Ability\n\nDescription: Bladework is the skill that allows the user to wield bladed objects (This excludes blunt objects). Bladework is no stranger to Xander as he wielded a blade even before his political career and with the raw talent he has, he was able to fend off a rouge assailant long enough for the noble fighter to recover. This later was refined by his tutor, the one who took him in and learned better control over his swings.\n\n[Effect]: Allows Xander to wield any bladed weapon and handle them with finesse. He is capable of locking a weapon and disarming an opponent. Only those with weapon related skills with the same rank can be on par with Xander.\n\nMysteries\n\nName:Mask of the Turncoat\n\nRank: C\n\nType:Mystic Code/Mask\n\nDescription: Xander’s personal mask constructed of a sturdy material that allows it to serve as conventional armor. It was modeled with a grotesque look of a human skull.\n\nThe mask has three features, primarily allowing Xander to view far-off objects and target enemies at long range. It also has night vision that allows Xander to see through the dark. The last function of the mask is what makes it special. Installed in the mask is a special kind of lens that allows Xander to see the flow of magecraft, the very essence of it or basically its energies. It allows Xander to easily differentiate a normal animal from a familiar and discover boundary fields and rune powered glyphs.\n\n[Effect]: Grants the wearer night vision that allows them to see through the dark, a telescopic vision and the ability to locate magical energies, allowing them to tell between a person and a servant, spot for boundary fields and detect people who are actively using magic circuits.\n\nName:The Phantom’s Vein: Dishonored\n\nRank: C\n\nType:Mystic Code/Chain\n\nDescription: The Dishonored was primarily a demon hunting tool used to bind and capture unholy targets, weakening their spirit. Said to be an implanted magic circuit in the forearm and comes in a form of a tattoo like insignia. Upon activation it lashes out a spiritual chain that isn’t visible by the naked eye, upon contact it can either pull an object towards Xander or pull Xander towards it. Usage of this Mystic code is meant to help him to climb or arrive at hard to reach places. And when the restraint starts pulling back, Xander or the object pulled becomes nearly invisible until it has completely pulled itself into his arm or after a few seconds passes, this is due to how fast the chain is being pulled back.\n\n[Effect]: Allows Xander to launch a spiritual black tendril from his forearm that isn’t visible by the naked eye, and pulls the target to Xander or Xander to the target.\n\nHistory\n\nLord Xander is the former personal bodyguard of the Royal family in Luxembourg. His primary role was to serve as the Lady Duchess’ and the Duke’s escort, and their means of gathering information to alert the family of potential threats coming to Luxembourg. Before the events of the Grail War, he was tasked to retrieve the catalysts required to summon the Guillaume’s servants and in recent events, Lord Xander assassinated both the duke and duchess and is currently serving his time in prison.\n\nXander was a citizen of Sparta who lived with his parents and an older sibling, however his childhood darkened at the age of five. His mother’s illness happened when he was born and grown worse over time. Xander’s father tried to keep his wife alive by acquiring loans from the wrong people just to buy her medicine and maintain the family. Xander’s mother died afterwards, throwing his father in debt to the loan sharks. On the night the loansharks were attacked, Xander’s father was killed and the loansharks ransacked the place. Xander’s sibling got abducted just to save their little brother from them.\n\nFor the rest of his childhood till the age of 16, Xander lived off in the streets, stealing scraps of food and creating a makeshift home just to get by, learning to fight with the blade just by means to survive. Just as he was about to accept this reality, thinking that this will be how he will spend his life, an opportunity presented himself before him and changed his life forever.\n\nIt was when he got involved in a fight between a noblewoman and a rouge. The woman looked like a professional duelist facing off against a masked assailant. Their battle was a sight to behold, however the masked assailant had the advantage due to his dirty tricks. Just as it seemed the lady would lose, Xander intervened and fought off the assailant. Nearly overpowered by Xander, the assailant consorted to the same tricks again but had forgotten his real opponent.\n\nA fatal mistake one which the rouge will never do again, nor live to see the day the mistake repeated.\n\nThe noble duelist turned to the young man and pointed her blade at Xander, who has heavily injured from fending off her assailant. This wasn’t because of her pride as a duelist broken having received help from an outsider but because he was a witness to magecraft.\n\nBut killing the boy would only bring her dishonor when it was he that saved her life. She spared the young man after learning that he had nothing and lost everything he had. While unethical, the noble woman took him in and trained him as her own, for she could not conceive her husband’s child. Two years were spent, Xander became proficient in the ways of the sword and learned a few tricks of magecraft of his own. Xander later gained status and became one of the most powerful officers of its own national security.\n\nXander, age 20 was then offered to the Grand Duke of Luxembourg as a political gesture by the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign affairs and served as one of their royal guards. At some point he earned the Duke and Duchess’s favor and became their personal bodyguard, serving them for nearly more than 20 years.\n\nIn later years Xander became one of the five members of a special task force in Luxembourg called the Sandhurst Crescent Unit created by the Lord Duke Guillaume upon gaining status. As an operative, Xander participated in various missions, and sometimes he led his own. The Sandhurst Crescent unit lost all its members except for Xander who was the only survivor of a dispatch of four operatives. There was a known conspiracy within the Sandhurst Crescent unit, the very blade of Luxembourg who sought to be in service of the Guillaume now serves in corruption with the United Kingdom’s greatest enemies. Nobody knew what exactly happened except for Xander who refused to say anything.\n\nAt some point he murdered both the Duke and the Duchess afterwards. There was suspicion that he was conspiring with the enemies of Luxembourg, officials claim that they have proof and are currently gathering evidence to back it up.\n\nPersonality\n\nXander is usually a man with few words when one meets him. Before the assassination, he earned the respect of his fellowmen in Luxembourg, given praise for his efforts and worked to seize and bring down some of the Royal Family’s enemies. It is known that he had avoided contact with the Guillaume children most of the time as speculations from the nobles suggest that he could have not liked children. He was a man who held the highest honor being one of the elites protecting the family head.\n\nThough having assassinated the people he sought to protect brings a different story.\n\nWhile its hard to divine his reasons why, the closest guest would be that he could have served the Guillaumes for status and hated life with the Nobles, having some sense of inferiority. It could have also been the fact that he was sent off from Greece to Luxembourg as he hasn’t returned in Greece in years, believing he has been abandoned like how his elder sibling left them even if it was for the sake of saving them, they never returned.\n\nOr the cruelty of the nobles and how they profit from their citizens and harbored and nurtured hate for years.\n\nWhatever reason, his deeds were still held accountable as he nearly brought the destruction of Luxembourg itself.\n\nExtra Info\n\nXander was a character inspired from the game series Dishonored, conceptualized as a modern turncoat.\n\nXander is 48 years old, though this may be subject to change in the later circumstances and was born on the October 13th on a Friday. Because of this and along with the assassination of the Luxembourg Royalists, he and his name and his birthday became an ill omen in the country.\n\nHis experience in combat was mostly from his childhood and the tasks received by the Guillame household that involved skirmishes. Even after being taught magecraft, he’s thought to be a guardsman who knew magecraft than just an incomplete magus, barely one at any point.\n\nXander’s Command Seals appeared on his hand after killing the Luxembourg nobility, implying he found desire after killing them.\n\nXander’s story starts in prison having been caught in the act of killing them with blood on his hands and a blade stained with blood. However it proved hard to divine his reasons for such actions. After being imprisoned, the starting plot implies he summoned a servant to which he used to escape. Following the weeks after escape, its implied that he’d be killing some nobles in Luxembourg while participating the Grand Grail War.\n\nXander’s teacher is supposed to look like Fiora from League of Legends only with a body in a Greek accent.\n\nWhile primarily Xander’s plot has been set to spark a massive impact on Luxembourg, the story can be set and shifted to any part of Europe, the point remaining that he had gained political status and betrayed the people he meant to protect. However the plot device and setting may be adjusted in accordance to the site’s plot due to lack of information or a failed attempt to divine what staff had in mind for the Roleplayers of Fate/Orbis Telos.\n\n--------------------"
