The fashion designer chose silk as the material, and as the form of pleissé.\n\nThe blue-violet shade of indigo, in turn, stands out against the background of jeans or imperial blue — it charms, brings harmony and balance to the image. Rich electric and web indigo allow to form bright, catchy non-standard images.\n\nThe popularity of one shade or another has international motifs, so indigo is widely known in some countries and is not popular at all in others.\n\nIt’s dark blue, the colour of the night sky. The deeper the color of indigo, the more it calls man to infinity, awakens in him the desire for pure and, finally, for super-sensitive. Blue is a typical celestial color. With great penetration, he develops an element of peace. By leaning towards black, he acquires a shade of inhuman sadness. It’s like an endless deepening into the serious, where there’s no end and there can’t be.\n\nThe symbolism of indigo\n\nIt is very deep, leads to depression, causes oppression, anxiety, excessive seriousness, sadness, sadness. It causes the need for physiological peace and satisfaction in the world. The rejection of this color — if you do not want to relax and rest.\n\nTo increase the main effect of blue, namely to enhance the feeling of peace, the Lucher dough uses dark blue.\n\nDark blue creates a serene peace of mind.\n\nIndigo (colour)\n\nWhen the dark blue color is considered, a vegetative calming occurs. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and waking function are reduced and adjusted trophotographically. The body adjusts itself to soothe and rest. In case of illness and fatigue, the need for blue is increased. The susceptibility and readiness for pain also increases.\n\nIndigo color — like each of the four basic colors — is a color expression of one of the basic biological needs: physiologically — peace, psychologically — satisfaction. Whoever is in such a balanced, harmonious state without tension feels at home: in close contact with others and in safety.\n\nPeople say: “Blue is loyalty”. In a state of unity with others, there is a special sensitivity to change. Blue therefore corresponds to all kinds of sensitivity. Blue, as a colour of heightened sensitivity, is a prerequisite for the ability to penetrate, aesthetic experiences and deep reflections.\n\nThe Pali language, akin to Sanskrit, calls dark blue the preferred colour for meditation. This suggests that already in ancient India the dark blue color was perceived as the most typical shade.\n\nDark blue is a rich color — especially preferred by obesity-prone people — and expresses satisfaction and performance. It is the fulfillment of the ideal of unity (hence the blue flower of romanticism); it is a close connection with the foremother, devotion and trust, love and sacrifice (the blue garment of Our Lady Mary).\n\nThe relationship of indigo color to man\n\nDeviation of the dark blue color means that a person avoids the relaxing tension of rest, because he believes that at the moment can not afford to rest without giving up something important. Such a person feels that the relaxing rest will cause an atony which he or she — in most cases subconsciously — feels fear. Atony can lead to depression, which they are trying to avoid. For such people, blue is not an “attractive thing” but a “threatening thing” because the need for communication expressed by this color is not met; it is often an attitude towards a love partner, sometimes a colleague at work or a place where the person should live. The one who constantly rejects blue is deprived of the “satisfying unity” that he lacks. The result is anxiety and tension, fussiness and a search for excitement in order to avoid a waiting atony or even depression in this senseless way of life.\n\nIn a survey of 5,000 people smoking cigarettes, it was found that more than half of them reject blue, especially those who smoke dark aromatic tobacco. In this case, excitement from smoking seems to be a protection against atony. Increased irritation (e.g., television) and changeable anxious behaviors also affect their ability to concentrate, which, especially in children, is reflected in their insensitivity to learning. Prolonged irritation can cause neurotic disturbance in adults. Relinquishing dark blue as a fear of rest often causes, as compensation, a preference for red and indicates a desire for excitement. If a dissatisfied sense of spiritual unity demands red as compensation, then a “passionate” sexual dope appears.\n\nFlower palette with names\n\nA palette of 137 colors with names, RGB values and HEX (HTML) code."
