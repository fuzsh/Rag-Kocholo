We may earn a small commission from purchases made through them, at no additional cost to you.\n\nWhen it comes to a pink color, most of us associate it with femininity. A cheerful, sweet, and romantic color that comes in a range of different shades of pink, from a baby pink color to a hot pink color and many more variations. We will be exploring various shades of pink names, discovering a little history about the color and how some pink shades can be used around the home.\n\nShades of Pink: A Brief History\n\nThe color pink has had a diverse history, with society forming different perspectives and associations of the color. Pink has not always been associated with feminism, which only developed in more recent history. The name pink was first used near the end of the seventeenth century and was derived from a flower with the same name, the Dianthus plumarius, which is also known simply as pink, garden pink, wild pink, or common pink. This is why so many shades of pink have natural, floral names, like wild orchid pink, french fuchsia, cherry pink, or carnation pink.\n\nDuring the middle ages and the Renaissance, pink shades like rouge were used more in religious art and the color only stepped out of the shadows in eighteenth-century Europe. Men and women during this time, mostly European aristocrats, wore soft light pink colors as an indication of status and extravagance. A chief mistress of Louis XV, Madame de Pompadour adored the color. In time, a particular pink known as “Rose Pompadour” was named after her by the Sevres porcelain manufacturer.\n\nDuring the 19th century, pink was still not associated with girls only, and if a boy wore a shade of pink, it was considered a lighter color to red, which had a more masculine connection as red was associated with the military. In fact, most children only wore white in those times because any color would wash out too easily. This was before the discovery of chemical dyes.\n\nLater during the 19th century, the change in the perception of pink started to become more pronounced. Western world men began wearing more neutral or darker colors, and pastels or brighter colors were worn by women. During this time pink also gained a more sensual representation, as it was used in the creation of lingerie. The gradual move of pink becoming more of a feminine color continued during the twentieth century, due to designers of the time creating dresses in shades of pink. This perception was boosted due to various female icons of the time, who chose to wear pink attire. For example, Mamie Eisenhower wore a pink dress to the inauguration ceremony of her husband Dwight D. Eisenhower, who then became the US President in 1953.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, inmates who were branded as homosexuals and were kept in concentration camps in Nazi Germany were forced into wearing a pink triangle.\n\nOver the years, this has become an emblem of gay rights. Other causes have also taken up the color pink, the color has become quite familiar in the fight against breast cancer. After the 1940s, pink has become a color that separates the sexes. This societal misconception developed into a general way people view pink. So, pink has become more of a color for girls, while blue has become a color for boys. This is ultimately a form of bias or sexism, and unfortunately, many of us do not even realize this. Ideally, we should not gender colors as it only perpetuates this type of thinking.\n\nWhen considering the world, many other cultures have embraced the pink color and have not labeled it a female-only color. Various cultures are more open to the use of pink and its various shades. Men in India are commonly seen wearing pink items of clothing or turbans, as the color is used by both males and females. In recent years, in the modern western world, thankfully, pink has become a color that is evolving and reaching new perceptions in fashion and other areas.\n\nThe Color Pink: Psychology and Meaning\n\nAll colors have meaning and can have an effect on emotions, and as we have already learned, are associated with femininity, romance, calmness, and tenderness. The different shades of pink take the power of red and soothe it with the addition of white. This is why pink is strongly connected to being able to calm aggressiveness. The pale or light pink color varieties provide the most calming effects, whereas the brighter pink shades have the opposite effect and are more stimulating.\n\nA certain pink color known as “drunk tank pink” has been known to be used in certain prison cells, because of its calming effects. When looking at the psychology of colors, it has more to do with each individual’s experiences. Some positive links could include youthfulness, happiness, or a sense of joy. A pink color palette could inspire creativity and soften designs that might be too intense. Some negative associations can include frivolity or a lack of seriousness. Pink can be seen as a weak color that exhibits timidity, or something that is not important.\n\nPink combined with white can be seen as portraying innocence while combining black with pink can be more evocative.\n\nSometimes, pink can be unremarkable, but on other occasions pink can be extravagant and in the spotlight. For example, consider Elvis Presley’s 1955 pink Cadillac, a car that most definitely got noticed. Some people might have pleasant memories associated with the color, while others could have unpleasant connections to the color. So, you should really answer the question of how you feel about the color pink yourself.\n\nDifferent Shades of Pink\n\nShades of pink can be used in every area of life, from the workplace to your home and what you wear. Graphic design plays an important role in the digital world of advertising, and colors can influence the way you look at things. Painting is another way to express oneself and understanding how colors work together plays a pivotal role in how an art piece comes to life.\n\nThe decision to use pastel pink or a hot neon pink shade can alter the way that you present yourself in life or the way that you feel in your space.\n\nColor Theory\n\nThe main color when creating pink is red, and when looking at a more detailed color wheel, you will notice many shades of pink that range from cooler to warmer reds. This “temperature” difference is known as a color bias. So, the type of red you choose as your main color will determine the shade of pink you will make. Cooler reds will favor purple, as they contain a little blue, while warmer reds will lean towards orange. Some examples of warmer reds include cadmium and scarlet red, and these will create pink shades that are similar to peach and coral. Cooler reds include vermilion, or alizarin red, and are more likely to produce your hot pink color as well as magenta.\n\nSince white is also used to produce pink shades, the type of white can play a similar role as red when creating pink. Titanium white is a well-known option, and is more opaque, while your zinc white is more transparent. Ultimately, choosing the correct red and mixing in small amounts of white, will be what determines the shade of pink created. When painting, you will most likely want to create some depth and dimension, so you will need to lighten or darken your pink color. To tone down a pink hue, the ideal option is to make use of a complementary color. On the color wheel, complementary colors lay across from each other.\n\nIn this case, adding a small amount of green-yellow should mute your bright pink color. Remember to only use small amounts.\n\nTo create a darker pink, you can also try and add in more of the same red you are using for the pink color. You may even want to try adding a little purple for a darker pink color. To create a light pink color, it is simply a matter of adding in small amounts of white. You can also attempt creating shades of pink without white, which involves using a light shade of yellow blended with red. This is why experimenting and creating a pink color swatch with a range of pink shades and hues can be helpful before you start painting\n\nNames of Different Shades of Pink\n\nShades of pink are generally lighter shades of red, which can also be created on television screens and computers. There is a scientific formulation that helps in the creation of the various shades of pink and other colors. When it comes to computers, this is known as the RGB (Red, green, and blue) model, while in printing, it is represented as the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) model. These models show the percentages of the mentioned colors, or how much of each color is needed to create a shade of pink. Below we are going to be looking at the various popular shades of pink names and their scientific hex codes.\n\nFuchsia\n\nFrench fuchsia is named after the flower of the same name and is a cool purple pink with hints of warmth. Some might describe it as a vivid or hot pink color. When this color is overused, it can be a bit overpowering and works well with cooler, darker colors. The name comes from a German botanist, Leonhard Fuchs, who discovered the plant. Fuchsia is said to encourage confidence and represent maturity. You can use the color in design together with a lighter gray or tan for a sophisticated look. To grab attention, try using it with black for contrast and bright green for a burst of colors.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorFuchsia#c154c10, 56, 0, 24193, 84, 193\n\nCarnation Pink\n\nThis pink color is softer, and lighter, and is similar in appearance to the carnation flower. Carnation falls close to baby pink but is slightly darker in color. The name carnation, as a color, was first recorded in 1535. This soft pink represents a certain sophistication and also gratitude. Colors that compliment carnation lay on the opposite side of the color wheel and include colors like your mint greens. A pink color palette is often used for weddings, and this particular shade of blush pink would work nicely.\n\nIt is a romantic light shade of pink that would work alongside champagne pink nicely.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorCarnation#ffa6c90, 35, 21, 0255, 166, 201\n\nHot Pink Color\n\nHot pink is a bright and warm color that can be found between dark pink and light pink. Most pinks are associated with calmness; however, hot pink is the opposite and is more of an energetic deep pink shade and has a rebellious nature. The color is bold and stands out, it is vibrant and is a color that represents youth. The color can be paired with black, but it can also work well with yellows and various cyan colors. Lighter pinks and white can help to tone it down. Hot pink can also be thought of as Barbie pink, as it has a stylistic flair and clean appearance.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorHot Pink Color#ff69b40, 59, 29, 0255, 105, 180\n\nMagenta\n\nMagenta can be found halfway between blue and red and is quite bright with a slight purple undertone. As a result, magenta is often called a purple shade like violet. The color is said to represent emotional balance and also elicits a sense of energy. The color can help to promote compassion and is thought of as a cheerful color. Sometimes fuchsia and magenta are confused with each other, this is because it is a similar color when looking at them from the RGB color code perspective. However, they are completely separate colors when it comes to printing and painting. Magenta is more red-blue, while fuchsia is more red-purple.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorMagenta#ff00ff0, 100, 0, 0255, 0, 255\n\nBaby Pink Color\n\nBaby pink is a more delicate and lighter shade of blush pink. The color was first recorded in 1928 and is associated more with baby girls. However, this association was not always so, and many boys in the past wore pink as it was seen as a strong color. Today, baby rooms and little girls wear baby pink, but it can easily be added to a pink color palette for all kinds of design purposes.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorBaby Pink Color#f4c2c20, 20, 20, 4244, 194, 194\n\nCoral\n\nCoral seems to be quite a popular color as it is vibrant, bold, and can be either soothing or stimulating. The color can be described as an orange or sometimes reddish-pink shade, and is very similar to a salmon pink. The name was first used early on during the sixteenth century. Coral combines nicely with colors like Tiffany blue as well as white. Coral is a versatile color, and some shades contain more orange, while others contain more yellow and pink. The shades of coral that appear deeper in color tend to appear more like the actual coral in the ocean and can contain purple and red undertones. Whatever shades of coral are chosen, this will influence how you pair with its complementary color. The deeper shades go best with teal blue and green, while the more vibrant shades go well with tiffany blue, and aqua blue. In design, when it comes to evoking feelings of summer and sun, shades of coral and blue are the perfect combination.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorCoral#f883790, 47, 51, 3248, 131, 121\n\nPeach\n\nPeach is a softer light orange-pink, named after the color of the peach fruit’s skin. In designs, the color helps to produce feelings of joy, warmth, and a sense of comfort. The color is associated with spring and is the perfect warm color to use that will brighten up your day all year round. Peach is a subtle color that can be used similar to your neutral colors. When combined with cream, gold, or beige, it can lend a certain amount of elegance as well as sophistication to a room. The color can be used in smaller rooms, like a bathroom, as it works well with all skin tones.\n\nThere are many amazing shades of peach, with names like peach puff, papaya whip, and marshmallow snow.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorPeach#fad1af0, 16, 30, 2250, 209, 175\n\nLight Pink Color\n\nThere are so many light shades of pink, the light pink color in the table below is slightly darker than the pale pink. The light pink shades are considered more relaxing and calming, while the darker, more vibrant shades do the exact opposite and are more stimulating. A combination of light pink and gray will go well in a bedroom to provide a calming effect.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorLight Pink Color#ffb6c10, 29, 24, 0255, 182, 193Pale Pink#fadadd0, 13, 12, 2250, 218, 221\n\nWatermelon\n\nWatermelon is a warm, medium pink that is similar to the flesh color of watermelon. Watermelon is a truly aptly named shade of sweet pink, it makes you think of warm summer days full of sweet fruit. A fun pink shade that is invigorating and lively. You can use the color on its own but can be paired with neutral spring colors like Sahara or a mist gray. The color also works well with all shades of pink for a more monochromatic effect.\n\nColor ShadeHex CodeCMYK CodeRGB CodePink ColorWatermelon#ff6b6d0, 58, 57, 0255, 107, 109\n\nRose Pink\n\nRose pink is a vibrant purple-pink that was first recorded as a color name in the 1760s. The color is a symbol of joy, gratitude, and grace, a more gentle color when compared to red. Seen as more of a feminine color, it can lend a certain romantic and playful mood. A pink color palette, including rose pink, can work well with your taupe, and soft green tones.

I have listed a few of the more common pink colors above, but here are a few more you might recognize.

Pink can be used in anything from sunsets to flowers and skin tones. To make sure you have the best shades of pink available, it is a good idea to create some color swatches to test out and keep a record of all the pink colors.\n\nCreating Shades of Pink\n\nPlace the colors onto a palette, a short distance from each other. Take a little red and add this to the white paint and mix. Slowly keep adding a little white paint to the red paint until you reach your desired shade of pink. Adding red paint to the white is easier and uses less paint.\n\nWhen darkening or changing the color hue, many simply add in black. However, black can be a bit too aggressive in toning down a color. As a better alternative, use the complementary color of pink, which is green. You can also try using blue or navy to darken pink colors. As you mix colors, make sure to make a color swatch with the amounts of paint you used as an easy future reference.\n\nSelecting the White Paint\n\nAs mentioned above when discussing the color theory, you also have different white colors you can choose from. When it comes to acrylics, it is best to choose a more opaque white, which is your titanium white. The zinc white does not create the best pink and may only lighten your red paint. Take note, when it comes to watercolors, you do not have to use white paints, as you can simply add more water to dilute and lighten the red paint. In addition, for a pink pearl shade, you can use a pearly white shade that includes flakes of glitter.\n\nSelecting the Perfect Red\n\nThe shade of red you choose will affect the shade of pink that it is created. Cadmium red is a popular color and will produce more of an orange-pink, while a scarlet red will produce a more vibrant pink. You will need to try out and test a few colors to discover the pink color you are looking for.\n\nNaphthol Red: The pink created with this red will be more transparent but still vibrant\n\nAlizarin Crimson: This red leans towards purple, so the pink produced will also have traces of purple and blue\n\nEarthy Red Tones: These can be used to create more natural pink shades\n\nQuinacridone: Produces something close to a hot pink color when mixed with white. When mixed with grays or blues, you can produce a variety of beautiful shades of pink\n\nDecorating With Pink Shades\n\nPink is a color that can pair with most colors, and a pink color palette, with its variety and shades of pink, can create space that is either sophisticated or playful, as well as calming or stimulating. Below are a few color combinations you might want to consider when designing your next bedroom or living room.\n\nBlue and Pink\n\nYou might not consider using blue with pink, but these two can complement each other quite nicely. You can easily create a calm space, especially for a bedroom, using softer shades of blue, pink, and white. Tone things up and make it more eccentric by combining a navy color with fuchsia.\n\nGray and Pink\n\nCombining pinks and grays will lend a certain sophistication to a room. Especially, when using the soft or light pink colors with a lavish amount of gray, which will then provide a certain amount of depth to the look.\n\nWhite and Pink\n\nThis might be an obvious choice, and it is a simple, yet elegant color combination. These colors create a warm yet fresh feeling that invites people in. You cannot go wrong with these colors, as any white should go with all shades of pink. White is a fantastic color to use alongside pink simply because it goes nicely with every shade.\n\nFrom vanilla ice, rose bonbon, to valentine pink, white perfectly brings out the vibrancy of these shades.\n\nGreen and Pink\n\nDepending on what shades of each color you use, you can create different moods. The softer colors like your pale pinks and sage green can create a more serene atmosphere while using more vibrant pinks and greens can be more exciting and invigorating.\n\nBlack and Pink\n\nThis is a more daring combination and might not be something that everybody likes. However, black and pink will create a more sophisticated look. By simply adding black or darker accents to a pink room, it can already provide more depth and character. Consider using a peach and ebony combination in a bedroom.\n\nPeach can provide that soft color without being too feminine, and besides ebony, it combines well with dark gray and white.\n\nTrending Shades of Pink\n\nEvery season new trends are happening in all walks of life from fashion design to home decor and design. Some of the more well-known color trends in the past include colors like millennial pink and Pantone rose quartz. Millennium pink became extremely popular as an Instagram-friendly color.
