Probably.\n\nStep 1: Make your Initial Roll!\n\nPost your Pre-Signup and make your rolls in the Interest Check.\n\nStep 2: Post your Character Sheet as a Draft or Completed!\n\nPost your character sheet in the Interest Thread as well (keep it separate from your original interest roll)! filling out as many relationships as you can. After your character sheet is posted/drafted be sure to Tag Ehb. You will be sent an invite link into the Discord via Iwaku PM to simplify communication. Note that not all character relationships need to be completed at that time.\n\n-> Be Sure to collaborate with others in the Discord on your characters' relationships with one another, and leave a rating on CS's you feel satisfied with.\n\n-> Also Roll a [ three sided die ] x [ one time ]. A second accidental roll CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE RESULT!This will decide your Summoner Character's Support Skill.\n\nRoll a 1 - Damage Taker Decreaser :When your great spirit takes damage, roll a [ two sided die ] x [ once ]. If you roll a 2. Divide damage taken in half (rounding up). If you roll 1, take double the damage. Your Spirit cannot attack the post you use this support.\n\nRoll a 2 - Damage Transfer to Party : When your great spirit has damage, roll a [ # players sided die ] x [ once ]. If you roll on a non-incapacitated player, you can then roll a [ one die ] x [ current damage to spirit ]. Based on the [ result ] decrease your damage by that amount, then increase the damage of the non-incapacitated player by the same [ result ]. If you roll on a player whose remaining damage is less than or equal to the damage you took, you take double damage. Your spirit cannot attack the post you use this support.\n\nRoll a 3 - Damage Infliction Increaser : When your spirit attacks and inflicts damage, roll a [ two sided die ] x [ once ]. If you roll a 2, double the damage you inflict on your target foe.

Inflict damage to the enemy by [ Result ]. Then, your Summoner is knocked out.\n\nStep 3: Ehb Reviews... and Awaits Completion of all Sheets and Relationships\n\nCharacter sheets are reviewed. Ehb will be looking for completion of all of the sections, and your inputs into things your pair 'did' in the story to build this 'endgame' narrative as best as they can.\n\nStep 4: After all sheets and relationships are done...\n\nEhb Posts the RP, and it has a hard one month end date. Additionally, points for \"Pair Combat Attributes\" will be rewarded based upon the average quality of relationship details.\n\nBlank Character Sheet\n\nThis is the Character sheet for Owari no Sekai. The aim is to have enough detail for your characters available to allow the others space to imagine that they too have been on an adventure with them for an entire story. As you will find, your character's strength will be based upon the growth they experienced with the others on this journey, and the depth of their relationships.\n\nIn the following post, the completed sheet for Nozomi Yuri and Tsubaha Mori is availible to look at as an example.\n\n[Section 1 - General Information]\n\nCharacter Type: Summoner OR Spirit\n\nCharacter Name: (First Name, Last Name Format this Time)\n\nCharacter Color Code: (The Color Code you Reserved in the Interest Thread)\n\nAppearance: (Picture - ideally Anime - of Appearance)\n\nRace: (If your character was a particular fantasy race just put the name here and be sure to mention details about it in parts of your bio.)\n\nGender:(Self Explanatory)\n\nAge: (Their age Before Arrival to Limbo, disregarding the time they may have been stuck in Limbo)\n\nRoleplay of Origin:(RP your character came from. Ideally linking their character sheet in their original RP. Again, do be sure to mention if it's an old or now buggy website as courtesy to the others)\n\n(Extra Optional)\n\nCharacter Voice: If you happened to have a voice actor in mind. Consider linking a youtube clip here.\n\n[Section 2 - Character Details (One for BOTH Summoner and Spirit)]\n\nPersonality Summary: (The character's personality summarized. Their development within the setting as well as the Dynamics of their Summoner - Great Spirit relationship can be mentioned in summary, here.)\n\nLikes:(at least 3)\n\nDislikes: (at least 3)\n\nProud of: (at least 2)\n\nAshamed of: (at least 2)\n\nFears: (at least 2 - Nothing is Still Invalid)\n\nBio (Original Setting): (A description of the character up until they arrived in limbo. Giving hints at their original RP, how they may have progressed since then, as well as how their world might've been destroyed.)\n\nBio (In Limbo): (This is the section of their bio that describes the character 'story' of Owaru no Sekai up to this point. Describing how they met and joined the party, and things that they've contributed to the party in terms of story. Is is here where you'd be sticking in the 'Tropes Exercise' parts.)\n\n[Section 3a - Abilities (Summoners Only)]\n\nBond to Party: (Imported from the Interest Check, use as a guide)\n\nPerformance Rank: (*Ditto)\n\nIdeology: (I know it's a bit odd here - the Ideology of your summoner is the ideology your spirit will follow by default)\n\nSkills + Equipment: (Mostly for Flavor, what things are they good at that helps them in Limbo? What belongings do they lug around maybe?)\n\nSupport Skill: (Your Character's Support Skill, based upon the roll you made.)\n\n[Section 3b - Abilities (Great Spirits Only)]\n\nWeapon: (Your Character's Primary Weapon(s) they use in battle)\n\nSkills + Equipment: (At this stage mostly for flavor, describes traits of their combat style, their talents, and equipment they use in battle)\n\n[Section 4 - Relationships (For Both Characters)]\n\nThis section includes your characters' relationships to the others in the story. Describing the thoughts and feelings as well as sort of summarizing the sorts of things they've gone through up until this point. Note that the relationship section applies to both characters in order to not force you to write relationship lists for both your summoner and spirit. But it also makes sense as the two of them are always together anyway.\n\nIt is worth noting that the quality of your Relationship Entries will have an effect on the amount of points that you can spend on upgrading your character's attributes. Of course, the attributes have no real effect in the RP's battle mechanics, and are just merely there for bragging rights!\n\nNote that while not all of your relationships needs to be completed in order to have a character pair accepted, relationships DO need to be completed for everyone in order to start the RP's IC Thread.\n\nRelationship to another Pair: Blah Blah\n\nRelationship to another Pair: Blah Blah Blug\n\nRelationship to another Pair: Blah^2\n\n....*\n\nTropes Exercise (Optional):(If you did the tropes exercise, list the tropes in here and explain quickly how you squeezed them in. This is mostly as your own personal check, and to help out Ehb who has to find out how to turn them into titles for your characters!)\n\n[Section 5 - Pair Combat Attributes (For Both Characters)]\n\nDO NOT COMPLETE UNTIL AFTER EHB OK'S THE REST OF YOUR PROFILE, AND YOU'VE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO LOOK THROUGH YOURS TO WRITE RELATIONSHIPS!\n\nThis section describes the apparent attributes of your pair. The strength of a summoner and spirit is greater than the sum of their parts. As such this section does not solely describe the spirits' individual strength, but rather the effectiveness of how your pair work as a team.\n\nAll your skills start at the lowest F ranking. But only require a single point in order to upgrade to the next rank. Going from F->D->C->B->A->SP it takes a total of 5 Points to fully upgrade an attribute.\n\nNote that due to the time restrictions of the RP these stats exist solely for flavor. However their use for game-play purposes in what would've been a full version of this RP remain!\n\nAttributes:\n\nManifestation - The amount of damage your spirit can take before they are automatically de-summoned for safety. Analagous to HP.\n\nPower - The apparent strength of your character pair which is a combination of their magic and physical ability. When you roll a die against an opponent this decides the maximum amount of damage you can inflict.\n\nIntuition - The intelligence of your character pair in coming up with ideas on the fly. Points can be used in this section for special rolls and situations for unorthodoxy plays!\n\nAgility - The speed of your character pair. Agility can be spent in order to perform actions such as attacking before a foe can react!\n\n(Extra Optional)\n\nTeam Battle Theme - The Battle Theme of Your Characters in Combat for extra spicy flavor.\n\nI am definitely not as (or ever was) format wizard-y as I used be so you can reformat to your liking if you want it to look prettier.\n\nNozomi Yuri == Tsubaha Moriya\n\n[General Information : Yuri Nozomi]\n\n\"Everyone, Let us Give it Our Best!\"\n\nCharacter Type: Summoner\n\nCharacter Name: Yuri Nozomi\n\nCharacter Color Code: #DFBCDA\n\nAppearance:\n\n(Original Artist: Kauto)\n\nRace: Human\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 17\n\nRoleplay of Origin:\n\nHisakawa Koukousei III - My High School Life is Despairingly Governed by the Cruelly Impartial RNG\n\n(Extra)\n\nCharacter Voice: Ayane Sakura\n\n[Yuri Nozomi : Character Details]\n\nPersonality\n\nProper and polite, Yuri has always been thought of as an upstanding student.\n\nShe always seems so willing to lend out a hand to the best of her abilility, especially when it comes to listening to and working with them on their personal problems. For that reason, the common consensus about her is that she carries herself immaculately - and the truth is that she is indeed quite good at it. However, as the party found out, this facade she put up around herself left her feeling isolated. To add on to that, she has her own personal troubles and haunting pasts that she only keeps at bay by working herself fully in other tasks to keep her mind off of.\n\nAt one point in the story, she did break. After being defeated in battle, and having her past as a murderer revealed to everyone by the Clairvoyant Summoner Kuuyari, she broke down. She retreated all the way back to her home patchwork and locked herself away. Seeming to break down completely. It was only thanks to her party coming to find her and talk her through it that she was able to come back. At this point in the story, she wants to repay everyone's kindness and defeat Fatuita in order to move forward!\n\nLikes:\n\nNice Weather - While weather in Limbo works in mysterious ways, there are locations where days seem to be always sunny and pleasant. Yuri's been known to be hesitant on going to worlds where weather is known to be muggy, and has been known to drag her feet a little when leaving more pleasant destinations. One of her first comments in a new world tends to always involve how the weather is.\n\nHer Friends - Originally, Yuri had been expecting to work mostly alone as a summoner. However, her journey with her friends has made her very invested in their well being. She's happy she's been able to open up to people more than she she had been able to before.\n\nFantasy Settings - If it has castles, old timey farms, and people in armor walking around with swords and in armor, Yuri feels like she's living out the anime she used watch in home. She uses her Great Spirit Tsubaha to project her role-playing fantasies, much to the latter's chargin.\n\nDislikes:\n\nRainy Weather - One time, the party arrived from a world that was literally full of volcanoes and lava. Yuri started to voice out complaints that the current one they arrived in was raining - much to everyone's dismay.\n\n'Flashy' Clothing - Some fantasy settings require characters to show more skin due to things such as magical tattoos needing to be exposed or to allow for better moment, or simply due to the environment. Such outfits (or lack thereof) makes Yuri very uncomfortable.\n\nInter-Party Strife - Not everyone in the party always got along with each other. She can't quite stomach hearing them argue over things so she's more often than not ended up butting in to try resolving it with varying levels of success.\n\nProud of:\n\nEmployee of the Week - Yuri once infiltrated an office of the Restoration Ideology wearing one of their uniforms in order to help the others retrieve a Key Fragment. She was no help as the party found their own way in. However, at the rendezvous point Yuri apologized but gleefully presented her employee of the week receipt that allowed for a free menu item at the cafeteria. Tsubaha says Yuri had it framed later.\n\nCooking Skill - She's done a big share of the cooking during the trip. Nowadays, thanks to experience and a stash of spices she carries, she can make pretty much anything taste good.\n\nAshamed of:\n\nHer Chunnibyou - 7th Grade Syndrome, or Nerding Out. While normally reserved and polite there are times when Yuri's interest in a topic such as interesting outfits or cool fantasy tech and magic causes her to lose all formality and revert to her babbling, nerdy, theater club middle school self. She still wants to pretend that her Chunnibyou is kept under lock and key but everyone already knows. The fact that her physical appearance always seems to stay as her middle school self only adds to the shame for her.\n\nLetting Herself Get Dragged into Things - While she's always convinced herself that she is very inconvenienced by helping other people all the time, the simple truth is that she can't help herself to say no or ignore them. She can't seem to understand why she always likes to mentally complain about it when she's always willingly subjecting herself to it. It's been even worse lately as her party has certainly gotten dragged in along with her into one side-story on more than one occasion.\n\nFears:\n\nPlatforming and Obstacles: Yuri is not the most physical of the party. Because Tsubaha is actually smaller than her, even her great spirit has trouble carrying her around when they need to make jumps between bamboo polls or run through corridors with moving saw-blades. Each experience has been borderline traumatizing.\n\nRainy Day Trigger: As the party discovered, Yuri isn't as perfect or kind as her facade puts up. There was a time when a part of her was capable of taking other people's lives, leading this dark second life as she lived her days trying to be an upstanding student. For a long time, she'd struggled between the upstanding person she wanted to be, and the dark person she seemed so naturally inclined to be.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nYuri was previously from a more peaceful version of Earth. As a student, she was a part of the 'Social Morals Committee', a nationwide mandate that used upstanding students in order to assist their fellow students in times of trouble and to assist growing everyone into productive members of society.\n\nNozomi herself was once a rambunctious character in middle school who was obsessed with nothing but anime and acting out her flamboyant fantasies with others. However, at the suggestion of a fellow Social Morals member in that school, she decided to straighten up her life. In time - she even became embarrassed of the person she used to be. She was haunted by a trauma that occurred to her before she entered middle school, however, she did her very best in order to hide it.\n\nShe has a hard time remembering exactly what went wrong on her version of Earth. All she can remember from those last years is attending High School like normal. Helping people as a part of the Social Morals Clubs, and the few notable incidents she had to help resolve between students. She remembers people wanting to help her, but her being too cold and formal to be able to accept it.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nThe arrival to Limbo was confusing, then ultimately horrifying. Their world Patchwork, Earth Hotel-India was soley composed of the Hisakawa School campus and the immediate shopping area, dorms, and apartments around it. The world was surrounded by this large mist, and anyone who entered that mist reported horrors on the other side, or never returned at all. Yuri carried out her duties as Social Morals Officer trying to hold down students' emotional breakdowns and hysteria. After first contact with the Ideologies, Yuri also helped form the world's governing board in an attempt to restore order, and help everyone make sense of their new situation. Eventually, some individuals began to discover their ability to Summon, and were thusly allowed passage to another world in order to be trained in that skill. Yuri herself found herself to be a Summoner when she in her sleep, she dreamed of having an encounter with her Great Spirit, Tsubaha Mori. Forming the bond.\n\nYuri trained hard to be a competent Sumonner. Egged on by the commands of the 'Little Empress' and also in order to keep her mind off of being sent into Limbo. She Graduated as top 13 in her class of some 500 individuals. Those top thirteen had the fortune (or misfortune) of being more aggressively recruited into one of the ideologies (whereas most of the rest were sent back to safeguard their own worlds or go independent). Yuri ultimately chose to follow the Unification Ideology, which would give her a chance to see the all the worlds of Limbo and even find new ones as one of the Ideology's Scouts.\n\nHer story in Limbo truly began when she followed a rumor that a Key Fragment was in one of the worlds. Partaking in the scramble to get there, she fought against several Summoners whom were also seeking to take the Key Fragment for their own Ideologies. However, it was her fateful encounter with the Summoner Fatuita and the discovery of the MIZUNOHARA Unit that lead her onto the journey that has taken them this far.\n\nTogether with her friends, she's trying to stop Fatuita's Machinations of attempting to implement the Paradox Method again to prevent another catastrophic world destruction from occurring again.\n\n[Abilities : Yuri Nozomi]\n\nIdeology: Unification\n\nBond to Party: Like Family\n\nPerformance Rank: Eager to prove\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nFantastic Formality - Yuri's polite and formal demanor has helped her and the party go a long way in things that couldn't be solved with brute force.\n\nHer Smartphone and Charger - She's uses it to record information. Though an outlet is not always available and there's no signal outside of some rare Worlds so she only uses it sparingly to review or record information.\n\nSpices and Basic Cookware - She originally started out the journey with just enough cooking gear for herself. The party collectively carries everything that's allowed them to camp and eat in more feral patchwork worlds.\n\nCollapsible Umbrella - She uses it to keep herself dry when it rains.\n\nBag of Bloons - Yuri happens to be in charge of the party's finances.\n\nSupport Skill: Rolled a [3]\n\nDamage Infliction Increaser : When your spirit attacks and inflicts damage, roll a [ two sided die ] x [ once ]. If you roll a 2, double the damage you inflict on your target foe. If you roll a 1, damage dealt becomes 0%.\n\n[General Information : Tsubaha Moriya]\n\n\"If Only I Could Live a Thousand Lifetimes. Maybe then, I'd come to Understand the Ways of the Blade.\"\n\nCharacter Type: Spirit\n\nCharacter Name: Tsubaha Moriya\n\nCharacter Color Code: #FF0000\n\nAppearance:\n\n(Original Artist: Kouhaku Kuroboshi)\n\nRace: Sapien\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 23 ( 7 Years after the Start of Kenno Matsuri)\n\nRoleplay of Origin:\n\nAachen Rizen Compile: Kenno Matsuri\n\n(Extra Info)\n\nCharacter Voice: Manami Nakamura\n\n[Character Details - Tsubaha Moriya]\n\nPersonality\n\nImpetuous and Easily Offended, Yuri had a hard time believing she was the Empress of anything when they first met.\n\nTsubaha came from a much more dangerous and violent world than the one Yuri knew of, and she lived a very isolated childhood that made her a little aloof in many aspects when it comes to interacting with people. Regardless, as time when on Yuri found Tsubaha to be very well driven and confident in her abilities. She is also surprisingly strong, and her technique and skill allows her to hold her own against most opponents who oftentimes think they have her easily outmatched. Tsubaha is also one to speak her mind quite freely. Something that Yuri somehow found a bit refreshing considering the way people normally talk to her.\n\nWhen the pair encountered the First Spirit who came from Tsubaha's world, the fellow spirit confirmed Tsubaha's claims to Yuri. Throughout the story, Tsubaha has made it clear that her main goal is to fine her original patchwork world to find out it's fate. But regardless, she's been cooperative. She's eager to help out former members of her party like they did for her in the past. Yuri finds it odd to be chided along by someone who looks noticeably shorter than her, but at this point the two have an understanding of one another.\n\nIf anything Tsubaha's sometimes blunt straightforwardness is a form of sincerity that just takes a bit of getting used to.\n\nLikes:\n\nDuels - An avid sword duelist who likes to spar with other swordsmen of the world. More often than not her appearance has made it hard for strangers to take her all too seriously. She tends to impulsively go for her sword from time to time for no apparent reason as if eager to duel thin air.\n\nHer Court - Tsubaha's 'Court' as empress was composed of nobles loyal to her. Among those were her now legendary companions who traveled with her from the time of the Jiaojing Sword Festival. Since the end of the TItan Crisis, they've all been working hard to heal the wounds and divides of the tumultuous unification of Shang and Tousawa to which she's appreciative.\n\nSwords - Some things do not change. Tsubaha's infatuation with the sword, the art of the sword and all else related is as strong as ever. Even in the years since her ascendancy she is still considered just as capable as she's ever been. While she only carries her most valued weapons in Spirit Form, she's said to have a collection of mind boggling size.\n\nDislikes:\n\nBeing Teased: She defeated two ruling monarchs in single combat in order to establish her rule, and lead her original party in resolving the nearly apocalyptic Titan Crisis. In Limbo though all others see is a short girl with peculiar eyebrows and she's just as sensitive about them as she's always been.\n\n'Spirit Mode': In her un-summoned mode she resides within Yuri Nozomi's consciousness. She finds nothing pleasant in that state and always demands to be in physical form.\n\nCharcoal: Has an illogical dislike of the stuff. Was seen smashing spare charcoal bits under her feet with a disturbingly victorious expression once before.\n\nProud of:\n\nHer Original Journey: During her adventures, she proved her martial prowess against some of the toughest foes in her world. She is very proud of the things she and her party accomplished in their time together.\n\nThe Swordmaxter System: Tsubaha created a magical inheritance system that could store weapons and store the skills and knowledge of people who were admitted into it. This impossibly complex system, she believes, will secure the safety of Shang-Tousawa for many years to come.\n\nAshamed of:\n\nHer Ambition - Defeating the King of Shang and the Daimyou of Tousawa opened the door to her becoming Empress later on. She's a bit disappointed in herself in hindsight that she did not think of the implications of making those challenges and becoming empress when she was younger.\n\nBushy Brows - As a child, attempted to use charcoal to correct her eyebrows. Failed miserably but only found out after townsfolk told her in person. It's still just as painful as it was to remember.\n\nFears:\n\nThe Fate of her Home Patchwork: Being formed as a spirit, she has yet to come across her own original patchwork world. But knowing that it was somehow destroyed worries her. What force could've been greater than the Rampaging Titan they took down? How could she face her people again as a spirit subservient to a high school girl?\n\nSailing and Boats: The 'Great Pirate' Saburo's ill-fated attempt to navigate the party across a river once ended so horribly that she swore to never step aboard a boat again. She'd rather swim.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nAn outcast. Tsubaha was a bastard child born between a local nobleman and a lesser-immigrant noblewoman.\n\nTsubaha was raised by the Woman's Family however, but was nonetheless considered an outsider by everyone. The only one who accepted her was her grandfather, teaching her the migrant Tousawa ways of the sword - the Ikkikari Style. One day, Tsubaha participates in her home city's Festival of Swords. With the hopes of winning and being declared a Swordmaster, she joins in order to prove herself. Her fateful journey begins when she and many other participants are unfairly poisoned by participants looking to get an upper hand. Through events in that tournament, Tsubaha and her companions are outlawed by Shang, and forced to run in order to evade imprisonment.\n\nWith her friends, Tsubaha ends the war between the two warring Sapien Tribes of the Shang Kingdom and Tosawa Kingdom, and they stop a plot to awaken a sleeping Golem before it could be used to destroy both Kingdoms. Tsubaha secures a peace for the two tribes by defeating their leaders in combat. Gaining their kingship through victory, she unites them in order to prevent further conflict between them. She founds the Ikkikari Swordmaxter Order - meant to safeguard the knowledge of the Golems to prevent anyone from considering awakening them ever again using a complex inheritance magic to pass down information and technique to anyone accepted into the order.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nTsubaha's memory in Limbo begins with her appearing in Yuri Nozomi's dream.\n\nMiraculously, Tsubaha had what felt like an inborn understanding that she was a great spirit and that Yuri was her Summoner. In the time afterward, they worked together going through the summoner training program, and eventually being inducted into the Unification Ideology and scouting the void for new worlds and the Key Fragments. Throughout their journey together, Tsubaha had gotten Yuri out of many bad situations caused by being lead into traps or situations Yuri had stumbled upon. Though she often started at a disadvantage, Tsubaha's raw strength and high martial ability for her size has allowed her to make decisive comebacks on many occasions.\n\nShe consider's her summoner Yuri to be diligent but incredibly naiive despite knowing her secret from the beginning. Though, she likes Yuri's kind demeanor that has allowed her to befriend other summoners who control Spirits who used be a part of her own party. She journeys with Yuri to find her own Patchwork world, but in the meantime the MIZUNOHARA Unit and the next Paradox Disaster needs to be stopped due to Tsubaha's Summoner's own inability to say no.\n\n[Abilities - Tsubaha Moriya]\n\nWeapon: Spring and Autumn (Twin Shortblades)\n\nA pair of blades with ornate looking scabbards and handles. Made to be used as a pair.\n\nHazakura (Dai Blade)\n\nAn exquisite long blade made for the mainline Ikkikari Style. It has a curious maple colored finish on it's steel. The weapon is too large normally for Tsubaha to wield. But she can temporarily summon it in to increase the force of some of her finishing strikes due to it's ability to amplify magic.\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nIkkikari Swordmaster: She practices the Secondary Line Ikkikari Style of Swordsmanship from her home world. In basic form she uses two Oriental Style Shortswords and the aim is to close in attack aggressively with them. Tsubaha's version of the style has some of the Wushu School's flavor in her freedom in being being able to switch between backhanded and foward grip on her swords at will, making her attacks and stroke patterns harder to read.\n\nSwordmaxter Sigil: The number Zero printed on the back of her right hand in a unique font. The inheritance magic of her version of her combat prowess is stored within it. The Sigil also allows for her to summon the weapon she uses in her Mythic Techniques.\n\nRotation Force: When landing strikes Tsubaha makes up for her smaller size by using the rotation of her body. Her attacks have a great ferocity and momentum once they start going. With rotation, her opening moves can leap forward with uprising distance, and often catches foes off guard.\n\nFire Magic Proficiency: Tsubaha's has an inborn proficiency with Fire Magic. She often opts to use it to add explosive and fiery effects to her own attacks.\n\nDrackish Magic: A peculiar type of magic that Tsubaha uses in some of her more fierce magical attacks. In some attacks she's able to summon dragonic forms that charge the enemy from a distance, or even blast a foe with a shimmering pillar a unique type of of non-aligned magic.\n\n[Section 4 - Relationships (For Both Characters)]\n\nRelationship Details Yuri | Tsubaha\n\nRelationship to Each Other:\n\nClosest Fried | Sincerely and Naiive Idealist\n\n\"Tsubaha...san? I want us to grow better as a team!\" | \"A splendid proclamation, Yuri. I suppose. But, words are merely paltry in value without action.\"\n\nYuri appreciates the lengths Tsubaha has gone to keep her out of harm. To an extent, she's even a little emberassed at how much she relies on Tsubaha to get her out of things that go to being beyond her physical control. She feels at times that she isn't quite up to snuff when it comes to being Tsubaha's partner. Nonetheless,Tsubaha's sometimes unfiltered remarks and advice has helped Yuri forge a way when her own fear or indecisiveness clouds her judgement. While Yuri's always wanted to avoid conflict, Yuri has also wanted to be a good Summoner to Tsubaha, and as her summoner help realize her spirit's true potential in the honorable duels Tsubaha seems to be quite fond of. On the other hand Tsubaha finds that Yuri has much room to grow. Even if Yuri's Naiivite can be very inconvenient and difficult to stomach at times. Tsubaha remains loyal to her in order to achieve her own personal goal to find her home patchwork, but as they have journeyed together, she, like Yuri has found things that make them good company for one another.\n\nTo Sukimairu and Kiri:\n\nAn Ally | Questionable Motive\n\n\"Tsubaha. You knew Kiri in your own world?\" | \"Yes. But, her Summoner is curious indeed.\"\n\nThough Tsubaha and Kiri met for the first time as strangers, their second meeting in this strange world was a certainly more joyful surprise. In their original world, Tsubaha had to accept that her travels with Kiri would come to a permanent end when Kiri used her spirit in order to stop the Titan Golem. While Tsubaha would never admit it, she partially developed the Swordmaxter System so that Kiri - nor the Golem she took possession of - would never be disturbed again. Being reunited in this world has made that final farewell a bit moot.\n\nYuri finds it charming to see a different side of Tsubaha when she's with Kiri. Once observing Tsubaha energetically talking about something sword related as Kiri appeared to be dozing off. Though Tsubaha does her best to hide it, Yuri knows that Tsubaha also feels ashamed. The Swordstress feels like she had failed Kiri in letting their world fall into Limbo.\n\nIn the context of being Yuri's Spirit, Tsubaha is weary of Sukimairu's intentions. The journey and their meeting began with both of them looking for the Key Fragment, what will happen when that goes up for grabs, considering Sukimairu is not part of an ideology like Yuri? Tsubaha knows that Kiri likely is only tagging along for the merit of being reunited, but at the end of the day she is in service to her Summoner - and Tsubaha, having once lead their team knows she is capable of putting up a fight.\n\nYuri's 'fakeness' is no doubt irritating towards Sukimairu - the most honest moment they ever had with each other was when Yuri yelled at her during her emotional outburst in the aftermath of the fight with Kuuyari.\n\nTo Kimiko Ono and Ko\n\nA Mending Friendship | Stubborn\n\n\"Just when we were finally getting along... It can't go back to the way it was, can it?\" | \"There are some things that we simply need to live with, Yuri.\"\n\nYuri and Kimiko unintentionally first met when Yuri had impounded the latter's car in Earth Hotel Kilo. Though the two never really met in person until a bit later on. Kimiko and Ko managed to get the party out of a tough situation, and joined them therafter. Though as it turned out, it seemed like Kimiko mostly was wanting to get her car back. Afterward, Yuri found herself getting teased a lot, probably as some sort of retribution. Regardless, Yuri maintains that Kimiko was indeed parked in a tow zone. Even though cars aren't really a thing anymore. Reguardless, she enjoyed Kimiko and her Spirits Ko as company.\n\nThe relationship took a hard hit though when Kuuyari revealed that Yuri had killed people in her own past. In truth, it was Kimiko confronting her, and the apparent breakdown of their friendship in that short span that drove Yuri to leave the party and return back home. Curiously, it was Ko, whom had been taking back-seat to interacting with Yuri for much of the adventure, that sought her out to bring her back. Critiques of the game say they're frustrated as to whether Yuri actually knows Ko is Shinji from the same world as their interactions from those parts of the game are left highly ambigious.\n\nTsubaha on the other hand can enjoy the company of anyone who can listen to her drone on about swords and her home world. A part of her dislikes and even resents her for driving Yuri to that point, but like her Summoner she's accepting the possibility of mending that transgression to face the task at hand.\n\nTo Kyouko Himura and Kyouko Hiruma\n\nVery Confusing | VERY CONFUSING\n\n\"So let's just call one Himu-chan and the other Hiru-chan?\" | \"Maybe something more succinct like Broody and Rowdy?\"\n\nDespite all that's happened with these two and the party, the biggest defining factor of them is the fact that their names are easy to get mixed up. Yuri and Tsubaha innocuously encountered the two while on the way to a certain mission. Though a series of coincidences they ended up traveling with one another. Later in the adventure the party uncovered the shady dealings of Kyoukos' organization, Sol Lucidis and lent a hand in the debacle that followed. To their surprise, Kyouko decided to see this adventure through before returning to her organization.\n\nYuri could appreciate Kyoukos' honesty. Tsubaha remains frustrated at the fact both of them have different names to the point that she comes up with nicknames for them that she ends up forgetting about after every mission - only to make up new ones later on. Originally, Tsubaha would identify the Kyouko she was addressing by drawing and pointing a blade at them, but Yuri was quick to keep her spirit from doing that. The chapter in their adventure that involved Sol Lucidis helped the party as a whole grow together - Though Yuri still looks poorly at how a part of that adventure got her and Tsubaha thrown into the 'Arena' world.\n\nKyouko was also the first person to experience Yuri's cooking skill at the start of the story. Her bluntness helped dishearten Yuri enough to get better. Tsubaha finds Kyouko's stories of saving other worlds quite fascinating.\n\nTo Haruka Tatsumi and Yulia Verde\n\nNot the Arena... | Battle forged Friends\n\n\"Haruka-chan, The money isn't really a big deal.\" | \"Come! Let's go back to the Arena Again, Yuri!\"\n\nYuri still has... trauma from her short stint in the Arena. While investigating Sol Lucidis Yuri was seperated from the party and ended up in the Arena where she had to fight for her freedom. Tsubaha absolutely relished the opportunity to fight it out and the more sucessful they got the more stuck they ended up being since the crowds could not get enough. Eventually though, they strike a deal with Haruka, a ring bunny - in order to escape. The plan does work out somehow, and they both gain their freedom again. Haruka joins Yuri and the Party afterward to make up for the Prize Earnings Yuri never got.\n\nYuri doesn't think too hard about the 'lost' money as all she really wanted was to get out of there. She feels bad that Haruka feels indebted to her since the escape involved her losing her 'job'. Tsubaha on the other hand considers Haruka and Yulia battle forged battle sisters considering the whole scenario reminded her dearly of the events that began her original adventure - the Jiaojing Festival of Swords. Tsubaha has sparred with Yulia extensively. Yuri at first was wanting Haruka to go back to her original world and live peacefully, but though events in the story she's a little protective of her - sort of worried that if she let her off as she is she'd end up being used in some world again.\n\nYuri was trying to Haruka's self-esteem up a bit more - at least until the fight with Kuuyari happened. Tsubaha almost desperately wants to return to the Arena again, even though it would likley mean they would get stuck there - again...\n\nTo Michio Kamijou and Argenta Chevalier De Salvare\n\nRecovering Party Member | More than Met the Eye\n\n\"It's strange Tsubaha. It's like I did meet him before, but at the same time I can't remember it.\" | \"At this point it matters not, Yuri. The Michio you've traveled with thus far is the one you know with complete certainty, so focus on that.\"\n\nYuri and Tsubaha met Michio as an 'acquaintance' of Kyouko Himura. He was shown to help out sporadically, operating outside of the main party in order to infiltrate locations, and jumping in to help during occasions when things turned against the party's favor. It was only when the Sol Lucidis Plot began to escalate that Michio fully became a part of the team.\n\nAfter the affair was settled, Yuri and Tsubaha had a suspicion that Michio had some type of wounds or emotional trauma from his past. This was revealed when the party discovered more about the Origins of the MIZUNOHARA Unit and it's apparent connection to someone he cared about in the past. The news was so shocking to him that he went after the MIZUNOHARA Unit on his own. The party was only able to stop him to talk him through it after subduing him and his spirit.\n\nThough they have talked through it - and though Michio appears to be a bit more stronger because of it - the party allows him to participate in the final battle - where they may need all the help they can get. The party had gone through some strife leading up to this, but Yuri wants to believe they've all come strong enough to face this final battle together.\n\nUniformity Exception\n\nUniformity Exception - TV Tropes\n\nYuri infiltrated the Restoration Ideology Office wearing their uniform. The only thing that differentiated her from everyone was the fact that she had a bright red bow in her hair. She did nothing to help the infiltration mission but somehow got employee of the week that day, which she's proud of.\n\nOpen Secret\n\nOpen Secret - TV Tropes\n\nThe fact that the prim and proper Yuri can break out into Chuunibyou Syndrome on occasion when she sees something she really likes. She wants to pretend that she's done a good job of keeping it a secret but the party's been traveling with her long enough to know.\n\nThirteen is Unlucky\n\n13 Is Unlucky - TV Tropes\n\nYuri was among the top 13 in her Summoner Training Class. As such, she just barely made the cut of being essentially forced to join one of the Ideologies due to her proficiency. She originally would've preferred to just stay back in her home patchwork as she already had duties there.\n\n[Section 5 - Pair Combat Attributes (For Both Characters)]\n\n(Extra) Character Battle Theme: LINK YT\n\nAttributes:\n\nManifestation - F ( 0 Points )\n\nPower - F ( 0 Points )\n\nIntuition - F ( 0 Points )\n\nAgility - F ( 0 Points )\n\nSukimairu S. == Kiri Moriya\n\n[General Information : Sukimairu Saemonsaburou]\n\n\"These Ideologies are stupid; imagine what we could all accomplish together!\"\n\nCharacter Type: Summoner\n\nCharacter Name: Sukimairu Saemonsaburou\n\nCharacter Color Code: #BFBFBF\n\nAppearance:\n\nOriginal Artist: 21st century technology...\n\n(Yes, I changed the FC; I'm way too obsessed with this AI...)\n\nRace: Human\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 17\n\nRoleplay of Origin: In The Name Of The Company\n\n[Sukibauble : Character Details]\n\nPersonality\n\nSukimairu is usually very polite and responsive. Her conversations are often geared heavily toward a goal: getting small talk or personal details out of her is challenging without directly asking her questions. Quickly, people who speak with her find her to be well opinionated, and these opinions are about as easy to steer off their tracks as a train. Unlike her free-spirited summon, Suki has powerful drive to get things done and improve the world around her.\n\nLikes:\n\nCats - Suki has always enjoyed the sleek, clean, and efficient motions that cats generally make, but having met a couple less-than-cooperative people in Limbo with cat features, she draws a very clear line between them and their animal counterparts.\n\nMarbles - Especially when expertly crafted with all manner of colors. Plain marbles are still shiny and beautiful though. They're also much harder to find in Limbo, making them especially nice trinkets to collect wherever possible.\n\nEfficiency - Sukimairu tends to write out a lot of plans. No one reads them, nor cares. Do they not appreciate how just a few minor changes in behavior could improve their combat efficiency by as much as 40%? At the end of the day, while she continues to push for improvement, Suki has to accept how unprofessional her 'colleagues' really are.\n\nDislikes:\n\nThe Ideologies - They're both wrong to Suki. She considers the fact that they exist as two separate organizations instead of one combined effort a serious problem and would love nothing more than to break down the concept itself.\n\nLies - Absolutely HATES them. Almost to the point of 'resetting' anyone she finds lying to her.\n\nDisrespect - Suki is used to people doing what she tells them to do. When they don't, she remains pleasant, but tends to start treating the person like a child if they refuse enough times.\n\nProud of:\n\nMCS - The Memory Capsule System has been Suki's main project since entering Limbo, and has developed to the point where it can reliably carry a 20-word message across a reset. While it's not much, she considers it her crowning achievement, and a milestone toward things to come.\n\n'Kita' - Sukimairu's assistant AI in a headset, which is now pretty much useless thanks to the lack of internet. She still considers it the pride of her home patchwork, particularly with how lifelike the personality is, which is just about the only thing that still functions.\n\nAshamed of:\n\n'Kita' - This AI also happens to be a major shame, considering how it constantly fails to deal with the new environment. Proud of the concept, ashamed of the reality.\n\nReliance on her summon - In her own world, Suki was a somewhat capable magical girl. Without a constant supply of manufactured mana, however, she's pretty much forced to rely on Kiri entirely for anything related to combat.\n\nFears:\n\nMemory loss - Having already lost her memory once, Suki has no desire to go through it again, and is still occasionally plagued by one-way recognition people give her.\n\nLimbo - The very existence of Limbo is horrifyingly unnatural, and causes Suki to consider whether or not she's actually back home flailing around in a mental hospital. In general, she tries to bury the concern as much as possible, with more success some days than others.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nBefore falling into Limbo, Suki was the daughter of the founder of ManaCorp: a powerful, multi-national organization known for selling manufactured mana. In order to prove how worthless a certain group of magical girls hired by the company was, she joined it herself to watch the group carefully for evidence. However, shortly before her first mission, she found herself thrust into Limbo without having transformed once.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nLimbo was a massive shock to Suki, who was used to a more orderly reality. Once moment she was eating cereal, and the next, the entire cooperate building of ManaCorp was thrust into an alternate dimension... or something like that. In one fell swoop, the infrastructure for internet, magical girl powers, and a modern lifestyle in general were dashed to pieces. Electricity was confined to a set of backup generators that quickly ran out of fuel, and mana production was totally out of the question for lack of rare materials.\n\nThe first several weeks of Limbo were spent panicking in her room alone while the rest of the people who'd come along with her frantically tried to make the best of their situation. This panicking likely would've continued, if Suki didn't find suddenly find a young lady snoozing in her bed. After waking her, she introduced herself as Kiri Moriya and was about as helpful explaining how she got there as Suki was explaining Limbo. Nevertheless, Kiri's constant, calming presence eventually snapped Suki out of her panic attacks.\n\nThe next several months were spent developing the Memory Capsule System (see tropes section). After testing this system by forcefully resetting herself, Suki once again fell into a mild panic, though the oblivion tweet and Kiri's help kept the duration down to a few hours. Even now, almost a year later, Suki still occasionally runs into acquaintances and situations she forgot, giving her a mild fear of losing her memory again.\n\nEventually, the summoner/spirit paired happened upon a familiar little empress and due to a persistent nagging, Suki finally gave in and tagged along with their party for the time being. While Kiri is extremely fond of the rest of the party, Sukimairu only appears to be fond of Kiri, sticking around only because of Kiri's desire to. It seems less because of a true dislike for the others, and more considering the group to be a waste of time that could be spent searching for key fragments or designing technology to improve life in Limbo.\n\n[Abilities : Suwuki Saymamaboloru]\n\nIdeology: Anarchy Independant\n\nBond to Party Kiri: Like Family\n\nPerformance Rank: Excellently skilled\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nKita - Suki's AI assistant in a headset. Really more of a toy at this point, but becomes a powerful tool in the few environments with Wi-Fi access, to the point where it could even hack certain computer systems that lack decent security.\n\nMCS - A small, but nearly-indestructible crystal with a 20-word message that gets relayed to Suki telepathically if she gets reset. No one knows what the message contains except Suki herself (and Kiri, who snooped when she was unsummoned).\n\nMana Battery - A small canister of backup mana which could theoretically be used to transform into her magical girl form for about a minute. Irreplaceable.\n\nEnterprise Laptop - Compared to many worlds, the computational power of this laptop is something straight out of a science fiction novel. Much like Kita, it's severely limited by the lack of internet access.\n\nBag of Bloons - Yuri's in charge of most of the party's finances. No one touches Suki's money, and most of her valuable possessions came with her room to Limbo, so she has quite a lot.\n\nSupport Skill: Rolled 2 | 3\n\nShort Circuit Sacrifice : Roll [ One die ] x [ current Manifestation Amount of Enemy ]. Inflict damage to the enemy by [ Result ]. Then, your Summoner is knocked out.\n\n[General Information : Kiri Moriya]\n\n\"There's no need to go so fast... let's stop and rest with a cup of tea for a while.\"\n\nCharacter Type: Spirit\n\nCharacter Name: Kiri Moriya\n\nCharacter Color Code: #FFB7C5\n\nAppearance:\n\nRace: Sapien\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 24.... ish.\n\nRoleplay of Origin:\n\nKenno Matsuri\n\n[Character Details - Kiri Moriya]\n\nPersonality\n\nCalm, collected, peaceful, and frequently asleep. Legend has it that Kiri actually sleeps far less than she used to, claiming she 'grew out of it.' This is somewhat hard to believe considering how many naps she likes to take, especially in Suki's mind. Kiri is a bit scatterbrained, and tends to focus on issues of little importance, like a misaligned crest, or an uneven number of opponents. Even in the thick of battle, she barely looks like any effort is spent at all.\n\nKiri is also particularly friendly, which often helps make up for her summoner's blunt, all-business attitude. Her opinions on the two ideologies seems to mirror Suki's as well, though in her case, it seems less like a conscious choice and more of Kiri just being too lazy or generally passive to form a proper opinion.\n\nLikes:\n\nNaps - Any opportunity to doze off. According to Kiri, the comfiest place available is Suki's conscious, which baffles and confuses most people, including Sukimairu herself.\n\nTea - A calming drink that helps get her mind off of troublesome things, and helps Suki even more. Limbo has some very interesting and exotic teas...\n\nLimbo - Kiri is probably one of the few people who actually likes Limbo, preferring it to the other, far more lonely form of limbo she suffered before arriving here.\n\nDislikes:\n\nConflict - Kiri fully shares Suki's dreams of a united Limbo, though perhaps not for the same reasons.\n\nDirt - Though Kiri's since grown plenty used to being dirty and using earth around her for combat, she still hates it when dirt stains otherwise nice colors.\n\nPillows - Stemming from one fateful day in her past when she lost her entire childhood in a flurry of pillow feathers. While Kiri still loves to sleep on just about anything, she's never seen with a pillow.\n\nProud of:\n\nSaving the a world - Twice, in fact; though she doesn't remember the first time too well.\n\nGravity and magnetic manipulation - Over the course of her adventures, Kiri slowly honed very basic earth manipulation into a frighteningly potent series of skills that seem to modify the very forces of the ground themselves. While she doesn't like to boast about combat, she'll happily show off these skills for other purposes.\n\nAshamed of:\n\nHer edge-mode phase - After losing her world (for the first time), Kiri spent several weeks horribly depressed, moody, and downright hateful. Eventually, she calmed down and grew to like some things the future version of her world had to offer, but it took a while.\n\nThe Maple Tree Incident - May it forever be lost to the sands of time...\n\nFears:\n\nReturning to her original patchwork home - While Kiri has no ill will toward her home world, she also has no desire to return things back to the way they were, considering her life in Limbo to be considerably richer and more enjoyable.\n\nHigh places - Kiri's earth manipulation is severely harmed in mid-air, so she'd much rather remain firmly on the ground. Besides: heights are dizzying and dangerous.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nA noble-lady from the Haschou house of Moriya, Kiri lived a lazy life until her family began to hatch a plot to overthrow the Ikkikari house and seize control of Haschou. Having been banished and hunted, Kiri lived several years as a fugitive, before throwing herself into the crater of Demon Crown Mountain hoping to calm its eruption.\n\nSeveral years later, a spirit world mirrored the event yet again, cause a copy of Kiri to be shamed and dishonored yet again. After another series of events within the spirit world, the copy was sent to the real world along with a strange party of lost festival contestants. For several weeks, Kiri reluctantly traveled alongside them, plotting some way to exact revenge on a few of them for ruining her spirit world life.\n\nEventually, Kiri met Tsubaha, and after a lengthy talk, began to take pity on their situation. Over time, Kiri eventually came to forgive the real people, journeying across the land in order to bring peace between Shang and the Tousawa Migrants. This all culminated in Kiri sacrificing her freedom to merge with the power within the mountain, saving the world a second time.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nKiri's first memory of Limbo is waking up in a mysterious bed, surrounded by glass and various glowing rectangles. Having already lost her home once, along with her freedom, Kiri found it more of a blessing than anything, though she quickly realized this wasn't a common response to the situation. Her summoner, Sukimairu, was quickly calmed by her peaceful continence, and the two formed a close bond, with Kiri's constant presence easing Suki, and Suki's mind providing a comfy resting place for Kiri when she gets tired.\n\nAs far as opinions about Limbo goes, Kiri just goes along with whatever her summoner wants, not bothering to contradict or fight it. The one exception was the time when Kiri noticed Tsubaha wandering alongside a white-haired girl. Considering how few requests Kiri actually made, Suki easily gave into her summon's pleading to join forces with the two.\n\n[Abilities - Kiri Moriya]\n\nWeapon: Celestine (Crystal Crossbow)\n\nAn exquisite Doven-made crossbow from Kiri's homeworld, made out of solid gemstones. Very powerful, if used correctly.\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nInstinctual Earth Manipulator: Kiri has almost no proficiency with weapons, including her crossbow. However, her innate understand of earth manipulation, which has since extended to gravity and magnetic forces, allows her to throw opponents off-balance and trap them in tombs of earth before they even realize what happened. Ironically, despite only having a crossbow, Kiri is far more dangerous up close. Anyone to close the distance may find themselves falling in hidden pitfall traps, growing 10 times heavier, or having metal weapons jerk around in strange ways beyond their control; all while Kiri calmly stands there like nothing's happening.\n\n[General Information : Hisui Skystar]\n\n\"Connected hearts will see us through~♪! Our hearts connect me back to you~♪!\"\n\nCharacter Type: Spirit\n\nCharacter Name: Hisui Skystar (alt. Miyori)\n\nCharacter Color Code: #FF69B4\n\nAppearance:\n\nRace: Human\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 18\n\nRoleplay of Origin: Spellheart*\n\n*Spellheart was written mostly in private before it died, so it can't actually be linked to in any useful way.\n\n[Character Details - Hisui Skystar]\n\nPersonality\n\nHisui tends to act like how every obsessed fan would expect a pop idol to act: bubbly, sweet, charismatic, and cutesy to the point where some people would want to slap her. At the same time, every so often, something else peeks through that perky exterior: guilt, fear, worry... Hisui is perfectly capable of taking a situation seriously, it's just that when she does, her particular choice of language tends to awkwardly contrast the dramatic atmosphere around her. It's common for Hisui to be mistaken as being several years younger from her dialect alone; something that both her behavior and her cosmetics strongly reinforce.\n\nLikes:\n\nMusic - In her native patchwork, Hisui is a well-recognized singer. While a lot of this is soured by the pressure this fame puts on her, she still has a clear love of the music she writes and performs.\n\nRecognition - While Hisui originally found the idea of not getting instantaneously mobbed wherever she went an appealing aspect of Limbo, after a while she began to miss it. Visual recognition tends to remind her of home and normalcy, though it rarely ever happens.\n\nSugar - Possibly the result of having been carefully manipulated into the stereotype, but nonetheless, Hisui loves all kinds of sugary foods. That's not to say she eats them much for the sake of her figure, but she loves them when she does.\n\nDislikes:\n\nForeign Cultures - While Kiri is more than happy to explore the wonders of other cultures, Hisui instead distrusts everything by default, considering it all barbaric, strange, dangerous, weird, and any other complaint that boils down to 'different.' Given even time, she can eventually warm up to things though, which is more than could be said about much of her xenophobic home.\n\nStalkers - A common problem she faced back in her home. While less of a problem now, she may be quick to slap this label on people Suki and her come across frequently.\n\nBeing Alone - Hisui is very much used to being around multiple people constantly. Having no one around is discomforting.\n\nProud of:\n\nHer Career - Spellheart can be a very cold and fickle place. Hisui has managed to build a surprisingly strong and lasting career there as a pop idol and is fairly proud of this accomplishment, even if it has to be put on hold for now.\n\nCombat Skill - For private, personal reasons she refuses to explain, Hisui took up arena combat as a disguised identity known as Miyori. Despite expecting to lose horribly, she actually managed to win, or at least heavily contend in, a couple battles against the strongest opponents Spellheart had to offer. Within the rest of Limbo, Hisui is remarkably powerful, and she takes some pride in knowing she can do more than just sing and dance as a cutesy cultural icon.\n\nAshamed of:\n\nThe Jar - ???\n\nXenophobia - She doesn't want to be that way, but it's hard fighting that many years of prejudice...\n\nFears:\n\nPeople finding the jar - ???\n\nPublic Opinion - Hisui is a performer who's career has hung solely on her reputation. She carefully avoids rude gestures, 'crude' jokes, and anything else that she thinks could jeopardize that reputation, even if it wouldn't in reality.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nHisui comes from a world where societies and nations are built along pockets of magically charged land. Depending on the concentration of this mana (and possibly other factors), some children are born with magic. The chances and relative power of the magic, if available, are tied directly into the place they're born. Of all these nation-states, Spellheart-- Hisui's home nation --could be considered by far the most prominent, to the point where it would be unheard of for any child to be born without incredibly potent magic.\n\nSpellheart draws a lot of parallels to the modern society of Yuri, Michio, and Suki's worlds; skyscrapers, televisions, crystal balls that functionally act like cellphones, and more. Due to the post-scarcity of the nation, jobs end up taken only for their entertainment value rather than financial gain. Thus, public opinion and goodwill tends to shape an individual's access to luxuries and other nice things. Under this strict principal of life, Hisui and her twin sister, Misui, were drilled with the standard views of their society: other lands are dangerous places to keep away from, foreigners are simple-minded savages to be ostracized (if allowed in at all), and so on.\n\nWhen their parents discovered the girls' talent for singing, they cleverly exploited it by intensive stage training and, eventually, televised public performances. This continued on for several years until their mid-teens, when Misui suddenly died by slipping and falling on a sharp staircase ornament. Though Hisui was given a short while to grieve, her parents quickly began to pressure her to take advantage of the incident and compose a somber concert in her memory. Moved by Hisui's pitiable story and her heartfelt performance, the entire nation joined the singer in grieving her sister, and ever since then, Hisui Skystar became the most widely-recognized name in Spellheart.\n\nA few years after this time, unknown to anyone but a choice few, Hisui took on a double identity known as Miyori to participate in magical arena fights. Thanks in large part to having been born with a high magic affinity (even for Spellheart), she had a couple of shockingly close fights for someone who'd done nothing but singing and dancing all her life. On the other hand, even the few people who know about 'Miyori's' true identity aren't sure why she did this in the first place.\n\nBio (In Limbo): N/A\n\n[Abilities - Hisui Skystar]\n\nWeapon: \"Swordie\" (Telekinetic Blade Artifact)\n\nAn ornate blade which appears in a striking blue color. Though she's often seen swinging it manually, a little-known secret is that Swordie can be moved simply with Hisui's mind, allowing Swordie to fight even when Hisui's 'disarmed.' Swordie may have a proper name. We'll never know.\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nAether Storage: Known in trope-terms as 'Hammerspace.' This is effectively a small, magical closet that she can access from anywhere to store items, or retrieve them later, Swordie being a primary example.\n\nSonic Manipulator: Her current magical kit consists of an offensive sonic blast, a defensive sonic barrier, and an augmentation spell that can repeatedly charge the power of her next sonic move, eventually reaching catastrophic levels if she's given enough time.\n\nHover Boots: Another spell, which allows Hisui to literally walk on air as if it were a road or staircase. The spell lasts about a minute and is rarely used without good reason, as she has a limited pool of mana between rests.\n\nRestoration: A powerful healing spell meant to restore a person's body to its natural state. Though Hisui claims it can heal anything, there are several limitations, which she'll adamantly deny, even if the spell fails right before her eyes.\n\nInternal Magic Shield: In Hisui's patchwork world, this is considered as common as having hair. Hisui's body seems to completely ignore the effects of weaker magic— the fire of a fireball, the zap of a lightning spell, etc —and stronger spells are, up to a point, blocked by an invisible barrier surrounding her. Only a series of strong magical attacks, or one mega-powerful spell, manages to break through, and if it is broken, Hisui tends to cower in fear as if losing the shield marks her for a gruesome death. This shield completely ignores physical attacks however, so it can be avoided that way.\n\n[Section 4 - Relationships (For Both Characters)]\n\nSuki | Kiri\n\nTheir Relationship to Each other\n\n\"Oh, hey, Kiri...\"\n\n\"Hm...? What is it?\"\n\n\"Uhm... nothing really, I just... thanks for helping me out.\"\n\n\"Oh... you're welcome. Thanks for letting me sleep in your min--\"\n\n\"Please don't say that out loud, I'd almost forgotten how weird it is...\"\n\nSuki and Kiri are a pair of personalities that, at first glance, one would imagine to clash horribly. One being lazy and perpetually calm, the other a powerfully driven individual with an incredible force of will. Despite this, it's rare to actually see the two fight... ever. The reason for it seems mostly to be on Suki's end of the relationship, as any objection Kiri has to something is almost always respected immediately. This is a privilege only Kiri seems to enjoy; everyone else gets Suki's constant lectures and 'critiques.'\n\nRelationship to Yuri/Subaha\n\n\"Oh, Sukimarareru, have you seen my sister around? She's going to teach me how to hold a sword...\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute, there's no way the forceful eyebrow girl's your sister...\"\n\n\"She's almost my sister!\"\n\n\"You can't be almost sisters! How are you two actually related?\"\n\n\"Well I had a cousin, and that cousin had a child who had a child who... I think was Sis's mother, or maybe that was actually her... and then I split into two copies of myself which eventually merged a hundred years later whe--\"\n\n\"--you know what, forget I asked! Your sister went that way with Yuri.\"\n\nKiri -> Tsubaha: Kiri's fondness of Tsubaha is likely the main reason Suki and Kiri are tagging along with the party at all. While their relationship from their home-world was initially quite strained, Kiri slowly grew fond of Tsubaha's drive and ambitions, hoping they would put an end to the feuds that ruined her own life. After discovering the strange familial relationship, Kiri latched onto this as a strange connection to her old world and lost family, further strengthening her fondness for the small, would-be empress.\n\nKiri -> Yuri: Kiri doesn't share Suki's distaste for Yuri's hidden chuuni, though she does find it culturally confusing why a 'dynamic personality' would need to be hidden. At home, the strongest personalities were often the successful ones who eventually became heroes, nobles, or both. Outside of that, Kiri simply considers Yuri a nice girl to chat up with a cup of tea.\n\nSukimairu -> Tsubaha: The two are on semi-friendly terms, as long as personal ambitions don't come up in conversation, which-- considering the two --is fairly rare. For Kiri's sake, Suki has agreed to avoid discussion of ideologies when Tsubaha's around, and the two got along fairly well after that thanks for Kiri.\n\nSukimairu -> Yuri: \"You have a COMPUTER CHIP in your BRAIN!? Are you CRAZY!?\" Suki originally hated Yuri. First it was the dual-persona, and when Suki learned of the 'Electro-pulsar Spinal Attachment' she refused to talk with Yuri for a week. After Kuuyari, the two finally reached an agreement through a series of angry shouts. To this day, Suki still considers the chip a massive security risk, but seems to be channeling her distrust specifically at the chip rather than Yuri herself.\n\nRelationship to Kimiko/Ko\n\n\"Sukimagoogle, I'm going to go nap with Kimiko for a while; try not to do anything dangerous while I'm gone.\"\n\n\"Why do you waste so much time napping anyway...? I barely have enough time in the day as it is.\"\n\n\"Resting isn't wasting time...! It's when you get the best ideas, and then when you need to do things, you're focused.\"\n\n\"I've never seen you focus on something for more than 5 minutes before you started nodding off...\"\n\n\"Everyone naps different. You should see Kimiko, the way she nods off you would think she--...\"\n\n\"(...I wonder if it's possible to trade spirits for a while... Ko could be awfully useful...)\"\n\nKiri -> Kimiko: Long live the UNA~! (United Napping Alliance)\n\nKiri -> Ko: The UNA shall triumph over its enemies~!\n\nSukimairu -> Kimiko: The easiest way to befriend Suki is to ask for her advice. For this reason, the two are on very good terms: Kimiko benefits from Suki's business advice, and Suki gets to enjoy the pleasure of someone heeding her advice and improving because of it. Their shared independence from ideologies makes it an especially strong relationship, despite the differing reasons for said independence.\n\nSukimairu -> Ko: This might have been a more friendly relationship if Ko left Kiri alone. Though Suki has nothing against him personally, she grows extremely defensive if she notices him chewing out Kiri for napping. Plus, the whole 'possession' incident was extremely fishy...\n\nRelationship to Kyouko/Kyouko\n\n\"Hey Kiri, what do you think about Kyouko...?\"\n\n\"Hm...? Kyouko, or Kyouko?\"\n\n\"Kyouko.\"\n\n\"I think her imagination is wonderful. And who knows, maybe there really are worlds like that out there...!\"\n\n\"Where I'm from there's a word for people like her...\"\n\n\"Oh? What is it...?\"\n\n\".........let's just go with 'meme.' That sounds nicer.\"\n\nKiri -> Kyouko: \"Are you suuuure you've never heard of Saburo...?\" Kiri keeps insisting Kyouko must be a pirate or a fighter of some kind, since the vast majority of people from home with a missing eye lost it in battle. Although she was corrected several times, she keeps it up, possibly as some sort of dry joke.\n\nKiri -> Kyouko: A small bundle of exhausting. Kiri is more capable of high-energy tasks than she was before her journey, but this Kyouko absolutely pushes her beyond her limits, and she generally stays away for her own sanity.\n\nSukimairu -> Kyouko: \"Sorry you got the kid as your spirit... that must be rough.\" Sol Lucidis catches Suki's eye as a respectable organization and the closest thing to a truly ideology-independent organization. Sadly, this leads to her treating Kyouko more as a business partner than a friend or companion.\n\nSukimairu -> Kyouko: One would think being tossed into limbo would open Suki's mind to the crazy, supernatural things, but Kyouko falls squarely into the 'fictional' category in Suki's mind. Suki absolutely refuses to take Kyouko seriously at all and patronizes her like the small child she appears to be.\n\nRelationship to Haruka/Yulia\n\n\"It's so nice having a normal person like Haruka around..\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'huh'...?\"\n\n\"She seems awfully weird to me.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Well... she never learned an elemental manipulation, she spent most of her life in a learning prison called 'school,' and she told me wyverns didn't even exist where she was from...!\"\n\n\"You do realize you just described most of us here, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm. All of you are weird~!\"\n\nKiri -> Haruka: Kiri enjoys playing the game of 'is this a thing in your world' more with Haruka than anyone else. Most often than not, a totally normal cultural thing for one of them ends up like a baffling fictional novel to the other. Being fairly small herself, Kiri finds the idea of weight to be confusing, coming from a world of scarce foodstuffs. For the sake of getting Haruka to enjoy a cup of tea with her, she usually claims it's a special 'diet tea' regardless of what variety it actually is.\n\nKiri -> Yulia: Being as shy as she is, Kiri doesn't talk or think much of Yulia. She's usually just part of the background scenery when talking with Haruka (if she's even summoned at all).\n\nSukimairu -> Haruka: Suki enjoys sharing relatively normal conversations with Haruka, thanks to the similarities of their home Earths. While there are some differences, they're similar enough to the immediate past of Suki's world that their relatively normal conversations are calming to her.\n\nSukimairu -> Yulia: \"Who's Yulia...? Oh, her. She's........ an effective summon, I guess.\"\n\nRelationship to Michio/Argenta\n\n\"Am I seriously the only one concerned about these people having web-connected technology attached to their brains?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I have no idea what that means... should I be worried...?\"\n\n\"YES, you should be worried! EVERYONE should be worried!!\"\n\n\"Why though...?\"\n\n\"With enough computing power, security algorithms can fail, or there could be a backdoor in their networking cod-- KIRI!\"\n\n\"--huh!? Oh, sorry... it's hard to stay awake when you start using confusing words like that...\"\n\n\" 'It's dangerous.' Is that better?\"\n\n\"Mhm...\"\n\nKiri -> Michio: \"He plays the best lullaby... zzzzz...\" Kiri and Michio get along quite well. She especially likes stargazing with him, though in most cases she just uses it as an excuse to doze off.\n\nKiri -> Argenta: Kiri continues to ask how someone can have light as an elemental manipulation. After several, continued explanations, Kiri had to finally accept that the worlds they come from are still quite different, though she still enjoys talking about the similarities.\n\nSukimairu -> Michio: More suspicion thanks to the 'brain chip.' While Suki has told him several times she respects his skill and loyalty to ideological independence, the chip still drives a bit of a wedge between her fully trusting him (and a few others for that matter). Michio having 'died,' Suki has called into question whether or not the chip is even still functional, however, and this helps a bit.\n\nSukimairu -> Argentina: \"Are you sure it's not 'Argentina...?'\" Another capable spirit. Suki doesn't have much of an opinion beyond that, though she's always curious about studying how the different magic types work.\n\nDawn of an Era\n\nDawn of an Era - TV Tropes\n\nSince arriving in Limbo, Suki's efforts have mostly been toward developing what she calls the 'Memory Capsule System,' or MCS. After months of collaborating with brilliant people across diverse patchworks, the result is a small, nearly-indestructible, adamant crystal. This crystal can store a 20-word-max message that is jokingly called an 'Oblivion Tweet.' If the owner's life signature cuts off for a few seconds, the crystal relays the message to its owner telepathically. Already, several crystals have been manufactured, and they carry with them the hope that the technology will continue to develop until all memories can be saved.\n\nAdvice Backfire\n\nAdvice Backfire - TV Tropes\n\nIn order to test the MCS, Suki had to reset herself and confirm the message was properly relayed. The message she chose involved the words \"Trust the blue-haired girl. She's Kiri: your friend.\" Shortly after Suki's death, another blue-haired girl named Mana happened to notice the bloody scene using a flying spy-camera and popped in, causing the now-reset Suki to take her own advice as a horrible joke.\n\nNo Backwards Compatibility in the Future\n\nNo Backwards Compatibility in the Future - TV Tropes\n\nSukimairu has a small, beta version of a headset with a built-in AI assistant named Kita. This headset has an incredible range of abilities: making phone calls, ordering things online, organizing cloud files, and many other useful things... or at least, it would if it had internet access. Sadly, without Wi-Fi, this incredibly advanced piece of technology ends up reduced to an encouraging voice in Suki's ear the vast majority of the time.\n\n[Section 5 - Pair Combat Attributes (For Both Characters)]\n\nAttributes:\n\nManifestation - B ( 3 Points )\n\nPower - SP ( 5 Points )\n\nIntuition - SP ( 5 Points )\n\nAgility - A ( 4 Points )\n\nAttachments\n\nSukimairu.png\n\nSukimairu.png\n\nKiriHappy.png\n\nDatKiriFace.png\n\nimage0.png\n\nKimiko Ono &&& Ko (Shinji Kobe) ​\n\nKimiko Ono\n\n\"I'm a detective, not some magical boy summoner!\"\n\nCharacter Type: Summoner\n\nCharacter Name: Kimiko Ono\n\nCharacter Color Code: Blue-green! #00A885 under as rgb(0, 168, 133)\n\nRace: Human\n\nGender: Female\n\nAge: 19\n\nRoleplay of Origin: Persona: Resist Your Calling (sheet)\n\nCharacter Voice: YouTube Link\n\n\"I see you want to know more about me? .... Why? I'm an open book.\"\n\nPersonality Summary:\n\nDo you know of right and wrong? Kimiko's world exists in black and white, and she won't stop until true justice can be served. Kimiko wants to do the right thing for others, however typically that means crossing a line. Violence will always be met with violence. However, when not openly opposing something she deems 'wrong', Kimiko makes jokes and generally laid back. The type of student who is 'smart, but lazy'. However, after befriending a senpai who went missing, she's been hoping that increasing her own potential with learning detective skills and methods to track down culprits. She briefly ran a club in high school which consisted of her investigating various small incidents. She was paid in candy. Kimiko likes napping in the middle of the day, and tends to skip class if the content seems boring.\n\nHer laid back personality annoys Ko (also known as Shinji) to no end. She typically lets him handle most of the \"hard stuff\", and happily lets him handle most of the plot driving forward. However, once she finds injustice Ko has to hold her back. There's been a few times in the story where Kimiko has nearly just charged in to kill the villian.\n\nAfter the reveal of Yuri as a murderer, it was eventually Shinji who had to talk her down. It took a long time, but eventually Kimiko started talking to Yuri again. Kimiko never quite forgave Yuri, but eventually understood the situation was more complicated. She seems to have shifted a little on her stance towards black and white mentality.\n\nLikes:\n\nPractical jokes; Kimiko loves little harmless jokes. Not enough to harm anyone, but confuse them. Her faverite target has been the prim and proper Yuri. She stopped after Yuri was revealed as murderer, and shifted her target to Ko.\n\nThe truth; In her orignal world, her side gig was to be a detective. She wanted to solve the disappearance of her older mentor student, but since she can no longer do that, she pushed forward to try and become someone who wants to solve all the mysteries of the world. She doesn't care about Unification or Restoration or any of that. Just what interests her in the moment.\n\nMedical history; Kimiko was also a medical student in her world. She was supposed to study medicine, whether or not she wanted to. However, she kept up her studies in Limbo, since it was more a practical skill now than an expectation.\n\nIce cream; her favorite flavor is cookie dough.\n\nHer car, Sandy; she won this in a race for a Fragment key. She won and since then she's happily been enjoying the independce of owning a car. Of course, she's also the go to driver for the group because of it, but she doesn't mind.\n\nDislikes:\n\nLiars; those who lie are lower than low. They're hiding behind a mask made of paper, and it's her job to wreck it. She'd rather just get to the heart of the problem and solve boring things quickly.\n\nCriminals; Her sense of justice won't allow her to let criminals to get away with it. She hates nothing more than knowing who the criminal is and letting them get away with it. However, she's let Yuri go in exchange that Yuri change her ways. The next time Yuri steps out of line, Kimiko will fix the problem.\n\nPeople who think they can get away with anything; people who know they've done wrong, and think that no matter what something will protect them. Money, justice, corruption, she hates it all. She'll destroy those types of people first.\n\nRudeness; there's no reason to be rude. She may appear lazy, but she'll be polite. No reason to just be rude if they don't deserve it.\n\nProud of:\n\nHer Car: Kimiko once challenged a guy to a race in the Patchwork Worlds and won. She got his car. Now she spoils it nearly as much as he did, and she's even named it 'Sandy'. The car gets wrecked every other mission, but Kimiko's taken steps to fix it every time. She's become really handy with the tools.\n\nMedical Knowledge: In her world, she was working to become a doctor because of expectations foisted upon her, but in Limbo Kimiko's skills have saved quite a few people.\n\nAshamed of: (at least 2)\n\nHer own powerlessness; in her world she was on the cusp of unlocking her own potential with her Persona. However, when her world fell apart, she was forced to part with that part of herself. Sometimes she'll try to summon it in battle, to no avail.\n\nShinji Kobe (Ko); Shinji represents a few aspects of people that she hates. He lies about who is to the group, pretends to be someone else, and acts like he can get away with it. However, while they aren't always seeing eye to eye, the two work together well. Kimiko just wishes that her Spirit wasn't such a liar.\n\nFears:\n\nDying; even though she knows that in Limbo, and won't permanently die, she still doesn't want to lose all her memories. All that knowledge lost, it would be too much to bear for her. She's come so far without dying. Not to mention, she would lose control of Ko, and doesn't know where the spirit would go if they were separated.\n\nGrowing too attached to the Group; while she's been working on it, she can't help but worry about how permanent this all is. Because she grew up a child of a military man, she never got to stay in one place with one group for too long. If she loses this group too, it would be too difficult for her.\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nKimiko was born to a military family, shortly adapting to the moving around, she graduated from high school. Pledging to save her friend from a mysterious university, Kimiko plunged straight into the heart of the beast, unknowingly having forgotten her friend in the meantime. She never found him and the world was destroyed before she even finished her oritentation.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nHer world has since become overrun beings known as 'Shadows'. Unable to return, Kimiko was stranded. She dreamed of a young man as alone as she was, but it almost looked as though he was split in half. Half a strange blue haired soldier uniform, and half a normal boy with black hair and glasses. He looked pained from the split and seemed to try to crawl back to his home.\n\nEventually, the two moved from meeting in dreams to reality. Ko appeared mysteriously in the middle of night before Kimiko, who actually kicked the spirit from fright. Eventually, the two agreed to go travel the Patchwork Worlds. Ko had different goals from Kimiko, but agreed in the hopes of fufilling them. Kimiko wanted to travel and find a new world for her to inhabit. Eventually, she ran into the group. She agreed to join them since there was strength in numbers.\n\nShinji lied about who he was, and Kimiko covered for him. Since then, her spirit's name has been Ko. She doesn't mind covering for him, but is still bothered by it. By the current time of confrontation, Kimiko has been questioned about the real person behind her Spirit, but won't answer. She won't lie, but she also won't give an answer. She respects that there are secrets she shouldn't tell, in spite of her hating them.\n\nBond to Party: Good Friends\n\nPerformance Rank: Capable of Doing So\n\nIdeology: Independent. Survival. Without a safe world to come back to, she wants simply to survive.\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nDetective Skills; Kimiko is good at assessing a situation at a glance. She's talented at it, and frequently know things just ahead of the group. However, that's only when she's actually trying. When she's not, she might fall behind knowing things with the group.\n\nNotebook; she has a ton of sketches and notes in it. Most are in code, but some are just illegably written. Nobody knows what she's written down besides that there's no point in trying to understand it.\n\nBedroll; Ko is in charge of cooking and self care. Kimiko ony knows one thing and that's to sleep comfortably at night on the ground.\n\nSupport Skill:\n\nDamage Taker Decreaser : When your great spirit takes damage, roll a [ two sided die ] x [ once ]. If you roll a 2- Divide damage taken in half (rounding up). If you roll 1, take double the damage. Your Spirit cannot attack the post you use this support.\n\nKo (Shinji Kobe)​\n\n\"My name is Ko. It's... uh... nice to meet you?\"\n\nCharacter Type: Great Spirit\n\nCharacter Name: Ko (Shinji Kobe)\n\nCharacter Color Code: Updated Blue! #2C82C9 or rgb(44, 130, 201)\n\nAppearance in Original World:\n\nRace: Human\n\nGender: Male\n\nAge: 16\n\nRoleplay of Origin: Hisakawa Koukousei III - My High School Life is Despairingly Governed by the Cruelly Impartial RNG\n\nCharacter Voice:\n\nJunji Majima (as Toru in Coffin Princess Chaika)\n\n\"Uh... we haven't met, have we?\"\n\nPersonality Summary:\n\nAs Shinji, he used to be prim, proper, and stuff down anything that didn't fit the ideal Class President or Student Council identity he had formed for himself. Locking parts of his personality away, he grew more and more isloated and depressed.\n\nHowever, when he was summoned in his virtu-ava form, he took on the name Ko. Instead of sealing away his dorkyness and chunnibyou, he instead embraced it. He let himself be as werid as he wanted and was geninuely enjoying his guise. Ko as a whole is very adventurous and willing to do things without thinking them through. As a result he's more reckless, but he thinks the change is for the better. However, Ko still has to take over most of the basics when traveling alone with Kimiko, becoming the 'responsible one' once again.\n\nLikes:\n\nFlowers; he just thinks they're neat, and without worrying about how he's percieved, he can embrace his love of flowers. He frequently is found with some in his pockets.\n\nBooks; Ko likes to read in between jobs and finding Fragment Keys. He espcially loves cheesy romance books. Also literally any games, or stories he can scavenge on a mission.\n\nBallroom Dancing; he likes the feeling of dancing with someone. Espcially ballroom dancing. He finds it incredibly romantic.\n\nRomance; Ko likes romance in any form. He's incredibly in love with love. Sometimes to the point where Kimiko has had to reel him in.\n\nDislikes:\n\nRain; he doesn't like it. It makes him feel cold and alone. Something about being wet and cold just isn't appealing to him. He'd much rather be inside.\n\n'Spirit Mode'; he doesn't like to be reminded that he's just a spirit. Staring at Yuri and realizing something happened to make him into a Spirit rather than a summoner is shameful to him. The form is just as limiting as it is freeing to him.\n\nLaziness; Kimiko would rather sleep all day than get anything done. Ko would prefer to always be moving forward, working hard to solve the problem and save the world. Of course, he's limited by his summoner in this aspect.\n\nProud of:\n\nHow He's Fooled the Party; As far as the party is aware, Ko has always been Ko. Shinji Kobe is a separate being from Ko, and has never the two met. There was an incident in a world where he pretended to be 'taken over' by Shinji, because he needed to use knowledge from Hisakawa to convince the group how to find their way around Hisakawa while being separated from Yuri. He pulled it off flawlessly, he thinks.\n\nHis Fighting Skills; he wasn't a fighter in his orignal world, but Limba has afforded him the ability to keep people safe. He'll be the first line of defense if others need it. He won't back down from a fight this time.\n\nAshamed of:\n\nHis Old Self; a stick in the mud who vanished just as easily as he worked. There was no one he saved, nobody who he could reach out to. He was alone, and never really seemed to have anyone by his side. If he could choose one person to be now, he would remain Ko and give up being Shinji forever.\n\nThe Bodysnatchers Incident; Shinji was proud to have fooled everyone, but mad at himself for having to pretend to be his old self. It just reminded him of how useless he had been. Not to mention, he wished he had come up with a better lie. It felt like he was just suppressing who he was again, too.\n\nFears:\n\nGhosts; A well known ghost-fearer, Ko would rather be un-summoned than deal with anything supernatural. The irony has not escaped him, but he simply just cannot deal with Ghosts, Zombies, or magic.\n\nFailure; Ko would rather lose everything than fail to save the world. He figures that he's already failed once, that's why he's in Limbo. The world must have been destroyed when he failed to help Yuri and the others, and so can be a bit reckless at times.\n\n\"Hey! No looking! ... Well it's not like I can stop you but no blabbing, ok?\"\n\nBio (Original Setting):\n\nShinji Kobe was in charge of helping Student Council, and the Social Morals Comittee. He was the average student who suppressed all his otakuisms deep beneath the surface along with anything else that didn't fit his image of 'perfect student'. It was a perfect balancing act that started to go wrong when he could only hopelessly as people started mysteriously vanishing.\n\nHe was desperate to get the class to join together and work as one. The world just... ended one day. He remembered looking at Yuri upset... and then falling down to the floor like a puppet with cut strings. Then nothing.\n\nBio (In Limbo):\n\nHe remembers dreaming of a girl with fire in her eyes and a heart for justice. He reached out to her, and appeared in a strange land. Just before he could finish processing it all, he was punched to the gut and knocked to the ground. Kimiko had nearly knocked him out in a sucker punch. Soon after, the two figured out the situation and then resolved to go traveling. Shinji hoped to locate his own world, hoping that his being a Spirit meant that it was out there... somewhere.\n\nKimiko and Shinji ran into the MIZONOHARA Unit after nearly dying to some monsters wandering their current Patchwork World. Kimiko was content to continue her journey, but Shinji recognized Yuri. However.... Yuri didn't recognize him. Knowing this was a second chance, he persuaded Kimiko to join the group.\n\nAfter running into Yuri, he dubbed himself 'Ko'. Claiming he was someone else entirely, he managed to pass off the ruse to the others. As time went on, he allowed himself to be sillier or more nerdy or just plain more open with the others. At one point, while in the world of Hisakawa, he passed himself off as being posessed as... himself to navigate a fragmented group to one place. Kimiko nearly gave him a migrane for such a boneheaded idea.\n\nWeapon: (Your Character's Primary Weapon(s) they use in battle)\n\nHis fists, an innate knowledge of some kind of martial arts, and illusion magics.\n\nSkills + Equipment:\n\nIllusionary Opponent- Ko flits between his real self and false selves, making himself unpredicatable. Anyone expecting a straight up and down fight between themselves and Ko has another thing coming. While he primarily is skilled in making shadow clones of himself, he can also create minor illusions of pitfalls, or small creatures. He can teleport between each illusion, but only between his other Selves, the minor illusions are too small to move between.\n\nSimple Cooking and Cleaning- Kimiko refuses to do this, so Shinji picked it up for himself.\n\n[Section 4 - Relationships (For Both Characters)]\n\nKimiko | Ko\n\nRelationship to Each Other:\n\nTrusted Ally | Good Friends\n\n\"I wish you'd tell them the truth, Ko.\" | \"Don't worry. Maybe when this is all over, I will.\"\n\nKimiko -> Ko: The two may not always see eye to eye on everything, but the two are so often in sync that one can forget how rocky their relationship started. Kimiko knows that she can trust Ko to watch her back, even if he won't tell everyone everything.\n\nKo -> Kimiko: Ko knows that Kimiko is pretty black and white minded, and while he doesn't want to lie... it's easier for him to be someone else entirely. The two kno"
