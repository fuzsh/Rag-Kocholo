        "text": "Wondering about the pink color meaning?\n\nPink is often seen as a feminine color, one for girls. But there’s a lot more to pink than that!\n\nPink is a complex color that has different meanings, along with its interesting tints and shades.\n\nLet’s take a look!\n\nMeaning of the Color Pink\n\nPink is a gentle color, and is often seen as the color of love and romance.\n\nIt is also associated with femininity. Girls’ toys often use pink tints and shades.\n\nPink is also useful as a calming color.\n\nBut there are also negative associations with this soft color, so read on!\n\nHow the Color Pink Affects You\n\nGoodness and kindness\n\nAs well as being the color of love and romance, pink also symbolizes kindness and understanding.\n\nFor some people, it’s a positive and upbeat color that relates to all that’s good in the world.\n\nPink isn’t intimidating or threatening, but often has the opposite effect.\n\nLove and romance\n\nPink is a little complicated when it comes to love and romance. The color is associated with love of all kinds, and is sometimes seen as a color of childlike wonder.\n\nBut it’s also a color of romance and passion! That comes from the red undertones in the color. But it symbolizes love in a more gentle way than aggressive reds.\n\nWhen it comes to pink color meaning for Valentine’s Day, it’s seen as the color of the hopeless romantic.\n\nLifts the spirits\n\nPink is also said to lift the spirits and help people feel more hopeful. The color is upbeat and optimistic, and can help people feel this way too.\n\nFor some, it is said to help ease rage and aggression, to boost good cheer.\n\nIn interior design, pink walls help relieve anger and other negative feelings, bringing a positive and peaceful feeling to the room. Some prisons and police stations use this psychological effect to their advantage by confining aggressive people to a pink room or cell!\n\nPsychologists say it can calm angry feelings in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nNegative Connotations of the Color Pink\n\nThere are fewer negative associations of pink than with other colors.\n\nOne negative is that pink lacks confidence and can be timid. This hue often blends into the background, and for some people, heightens their self-doubt.\n\nThe other slightly negative association is with an unwillingness to take things seriously, to be silly.\n\nIts connection with inexperience also includes weakness and timidity.\n\nWhat do famous people say about pink? Check out these pink quotes!\n\nPink Meanings Around the World\n\nIn many Asian countries, pink is also seen as a feminine color, and connected with marriage.

This biblical flower isn’t what we refer to today as a rose, but was likely more like a crocus or tulip. It probably grew in a fertile valley known as the Plain of Sharon, between the mountains of central Israel and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nPink is also rarely used in the Catholic church. It’s a deeper shade of pink called rose.\n\nRose symbolizes a time of joy during a period of penance and prayer, such as Advent and Lent.\n\nOther Spiritual Meanings and Symbolism of Pink\n\nPink is said to represent the inner child, and being in touch with it.\n\nIt’s also said to be connected with opening of your heart, or inviting romance into your life.\n\nTogether pink and blue color meanings lead to serenity, and sometimes idle pastimes like daydreaming.\n\nPink dream color meaning normally focuses on love or romance. For some, it also relates to their relationship with God.\n\nSimilarly, the pink aura meaning relates to a sensitive soul who values love and art.\n\nTraditionally, pink isn’t one of the chakra colors.\n\nPink Meaning in Art & Design\n\nBecause pink doesn’t appear in nature that often, artists and designers didn’t use it regularly. There was no color named pink in English until the 17th century!\n\nRenaissance artists were the first to use it as a defined part of their palette. However, it was mainly used for the flesh color of faces and hands.\n\nIt then grew into the associations with love and romance, and was popular with everything from Japanese-inspired art to the lilies of Claude Monet.\n\nAfter that time, it went in and out of fashion until the 1990s, when it became a driving force in contemporary art.\n\nPink with white can symbolize childhood, innocence and tenderness, but pink with black or purple can be the color of seduction.\n\nTints and Shades of Pink Meanings\n\nThe color called Pink in CSS code has a hexidecimal code of #FFC0CB and RGB value of 255, 192, 203.\n\nPink Color Swatch\n\nBut there are many more shades of pink, each with their own twist on color meaning!\n\nRose pink is known as the color of love. This is why the pink color rose meaning is a romantic one.\n\nIt is a stronger pink shade with a hex code of #ff66cc and RGB of 255, 102, 204.\n\nRose Pink Color Swatch\n\nHot pink is another strong pink, seen as playful, sensual, and passionate.
