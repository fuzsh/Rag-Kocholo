Pink is a color that evokes many emotions. It can signify youth, innocence, and femininity. But there are countless shades of pink, ranging from the extremely pale to the bold and fiery. When people think of a bright, attention-grabbing pink, the color that often comes to mind is hot pink. Hot pink is an intense, saturated shade of pink that really packs a visual punch. But with so many variations of pink out there, what exactly makes a pink qualify as hot pink?

Defining Hot Pink

Hot pink is located between magenta and fuchsia on the color wheel. It is defined by its vividness and intensity. Hot pink contains no traces of blue like cooler toned pinks. Instead, it leans towards a reddish undertone that gives it its punchy look.

The exact specifications that define hot pink are:

Hex Code #FF69B4 RGB 255, 105, 180 CMYK 0, 59, 29, 0 HSV 330°, 59%, 100%

As you can see, hot pink is composed of a high degree of red and a lower but still significant amount of blue. The lack of green mixed in is what gives hot pink its highly saturated appearance.

Hot Pink vs Pink

What distinguishes hot pink from regular pink comes down to saturation and brightness. Hot pink has full saturation, meaning its color is pure and intense. Regular pink is often soft and muted. Hot pink also has high brightness, while regular pink can range from light to dark.

Visual examples make these differences clear. A light dusty rose would be considered regular pink. It has low saturation and brightness. Meanwhile, a neon magenta would be classified as hot pink for its full saturation and brightness. Hot pink also contrasts more dramatically against other colors than regular pink. It packs a big visual impact compared to softer pinks.
