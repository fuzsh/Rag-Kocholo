We, the <strong>Hoosier</strong> <strong>Auto</strong> <strong>Racing</strong> <strong>Fans</strong> have banded together to actively support all forms of competitive auto racing regardless of sanction or affiliation. <strong>HARF</strong> HOOSIER AUTO RACING FANS <strong>NEWS</strong> Copyright <strong>HARF</strong> 2004 Fall 2007 www.<strong>HARF</strong>online.org President’s Corner Well, all the race track finales are completed and now it’s party time! Some tracks have banquets to celebrate their champions, others have bonfires and track parties, but however they celebrate, it’s to show their champions their appreciation on a great year of on-the-track battles and struggles to have a car prepared week after week. We applaud all of you out there who fight to keep the sheet metal straight, nerf bars unbent and engines tuned and showing up at our local tracks every weekend to entertain us. Unfortunately, we only get to honor those of you who have had the especially great year and won your track championships. Our celebration of Champions this year will be on January 27, 2008 (the day after the <strong>Hoosier</strong> Racers Swap Meet) and we hope you can all join us this year. The past few years has been a sell-out with great participation from the Champions and award winners, our sponsors, our sanctioning body representatives and most of all, our club members: “The Race <strong>Fans</strong>”! As all of you who celebrate with us year after year know, it’s a fun day of bench racing with drivers and fans, seeing our “Champions and Heroes” receive their <strong>HARF</strong> awards, and having a chance to leave with great door prizes or winning a piece of racing history in our Silent Auction room! We are planning for this to be the most fun racing weekend you’ve had, without going to the racetrack, with the <strong>Hoosier</strong> Racers Swap Meet on Saturday and the “56th” Annual Awards Banquet on Sunday. If you’re from out of town, we have made arrangements for you to enjoy another little piece of history and stay at the Brickyard Resort for a race weekend discount. Just mention the <strong>HARF</strong> weekend package for a special rate and enjoy spending the night in the shadow of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The motel also has a great restaurant and bar for your enjoyment and one of the best “giant” tenderloins in town. Just another treat to make your weekend memorable. We owe so much to our members this year, from your help with the Tracy Hines recovery fund auction, to the great sponsors who gave us money to support our <strong>HARF</strong> Hundreds, we appreciate all of you so much! And to update you, Tracy is up and walking and doing great (but chomping at the bit to get back in the race car as soon as he can bend his leg a little bit more) and the <strong>HARF</strong> Hundreds ($1000) went to Bill Rose, who competed at all 3 tracks and did great (& even though our Sunday night feature at Kokomo got rained out, he had won his heat race and had enough points to wrap up the win). A quick thanks to all of you who stopped by our booth to say “hi” to Vicki and me or for bringing friends by to join them up, we only grow with your help and we’ve found that this <strong>HARF</strong> Hundreds weekend is a great promotion to remind some of you to renew or to join, so Thanks so much. Now to our event only a couple of weeks away and that is Monte Carlo night! If you haven’t been, you’ve missed a great night of fun. From the time the doors open and the race movies start to the conclusion of the winners auction we have a ball. It’s a great opportunity for you to get more when you re-new your membership and a great night of fun and competition with fellow race fans and drivers. All professionally done with Vegas style tables and dealers, but without the Vegas style pressure, no one gets mad if you take the ace they needed for 21 or if you can’t add 2 dice together, our friends from Elite Casino Productions take the time and explain things (before they take your money), and then after the gaming is over, take your winners to our racing auction and buy your self something pretty. We have great prizes to buy with the credits you’ve earned and fun Monte Carlo Night November 17th, 2007 Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort & Inn 4400 W. 16th St. Social Hour & Movie Party 6pm - 7pm Vegas style gaming 7pm - 9pm Then use your winning credits at the auction, immediately following the gaming to buy great racing memorabilia & gifts!
