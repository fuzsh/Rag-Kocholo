        "text": "Brockton, MA - Randy Cabral isn’t about to give the 2009 Northeastern Midget Association driving championship, the second in a row for him and car owner Tim Bertrand, back. “I’ll take them anyway I can get them,” he admits.\n\nBertrand, a one-time driver, and Cabral, who followed his dad Glen into NEMA, “took” their respective championships with consistency. They won five times but it was the 11 top-five (in 14 races) that made the difference. They’ll top the honorees at the NEMA Awards Banquet Saturday night Nov. 21 at White’s of Westport in Westport, MA.\n\nCabral, a school teacher, won with an 84-point bulge on runner-up three-time winner Nokie Fornoro, who missed a race, and a 211 edge on third-place Adam Cantor, a two-time winner and “twice a victim of circumstances.” NEMA had seven winners in all – Jeff Horn, Jeff Abold, Russ Stoehr and Greg Stoehr each getting one.\n\n“Nokie and Adam are the two guys I’m most comfortable with,” said Cabral. “We take nothing away from each other. It doesn’t matter where we are.”\n\nWinning the first three of the first four races (he was second in the other), Cabral, never trailed in the drivers points race. With 13 wins over the last two years, he has moved to seventh place on NEMA’s all-time win list. Eighteen have come in the four years with Bertrand.\n\nAcknowledging Bertrand “gives me the best equipment possible,” Cabral says the objective is to “do the best we can” and that is especially so when “we don’t have a car that is capable of winning.” The season-ending World Series at Thompson is a case in point, Cabral’s third place “just enough” to get the championship for Bertrand by four points over Mike Jarret.\n\nThe relationship between the families, tempered by both joy and sorrow, is, Cabral insists “not about championships but about friendship. We were friends before we were owner/driver. If Tim called up tomorrow and said he is putting somebody else in the car we’d still be friends.”\n\nThe biggest 2009 win came at Twin State in September. “My grandfather Henry died that week,” Cabral explains. “We had the funeral on Friday and Friday night we were getting ready to go racing. This is what we do, go racing. If I missed a race because of his funeral, my grandfather would have climbed out of the grave and kicked my butt.\n\n“Ryan Newman was one of his favorites,” continues Cabral. “When I beat him up at Lee (Newman was also in a Bertrand car) I called by grandfather and said ‘Hey, I beat your boy.’ He laughed and he was proud. He would call every Sunday morning and ask how I did whether we raced or not. It was tough when I didn’t get that call.”\n\nHitting the wall at Waterford was the low point “There was nothing wrong with the car,” he says. “I made a mistake. It was strange, the only DNF we had all year was at a track I really love to race on.”\n\nCabral says “growing up all I thought about was driving Midgets.” He would be “more than happy” to try a Supermodified or a Modified but presently is more than content. “Right now, I see myself driving for Tim Bertrand until he fires me,” he says.\n\nFinal 2009 NEMA Points: Full Points Page Here\n\nDrivers: 1.

Brockton, MA – Tim Bertrand is doubly proud of his second straight Northeastern Midget Association owners championship. In a battle that came down to the final laps of the final feature (at Thompson Speedway’s World Series), Bertrand nipped Mike Jarret by a scant four points.\n\nRandy Cabral’s third (in the Bertrand 47) behind winner Nokie Fornoro (in the Jarret 4) left little room to spare for Bertrand. While he doesn’t deny the joy in winning, he takes special delight in the battle.\n\n“We had no mechanical dnfs all year,” Bertrand says. “That is almost unheard of in Midgets. The fact that the Jarret car had no dnfs at all is incredible. We should have won the owners title by 200 points, instead the #4 gave us as good a run for the championship as perhaps NEMA has ever seen. The top two cars had one dnf between them (Cabral crashed at Waterford) and no mechanical dnfs.”\n\nBertrand, who also maintained a NEMA Lites car, has high praise for Jarret and his wife Lu, both as competitors and friends, who retired as owners following the last race.\n\nThe second championship comes in the fourth year of the partnership between Bertrand, a former driver, and Cabral. The team has 18 wins, five coming in 2009.\n\n“Part of [our success] is the work Randy and his dad Glen do during the week. Part of it is also a midseason switch to Jon Andruk (Circle Performance) regarding the motor,” Bertrand continues. Andruk, he adds, made the Esslinger motor “more reliable, insuring a lack of problems.”\n\nBertrand Motorsports pretty much dominated in 2008 with eight wins in 17 races. “What we had was a great driver and we had the set up perfect a number of times,” Bertrand says. “We proved it’s not about the motor, not about the ignition box, not about the number of rpms; - it’s about the set up.”\n\nOthers proved that as well this year – Adam Cantor, Jeff Abold, Jeff Horn, in addition to Fornoro, had excellent runs.\n\nThe two Bertrand championship seasons are similar. In ‘08 the team did it with wins (8); this year with top-five finishes. The car was out of the top five only once over the last eight races including five podium spots. “We proved when we were right on we could win and we proved when we were not right on we were still competitive,” Bertrand boasts.\n\nThe championship was in doubt until, on lap 16, Cabral passed Cole Carter, who was also driving a Bertrand entry, for third. “I was nervous, sick to my stomach,” says Bertrand, freely admitting he was thinking points at that point.\n\nBertrand could be even busier in 2010, heading up a team that could also include one or two other cars. The “guest program” which this year included, in addition to Carter, Sprint Cup star Ryan Newman and Modified ace Ted Christopher, will most likely continue as well. Brockton, MA - Mike Keeler refuses to pick a favorite. The Danbury, CT racer has driven everything from Quarter Midgets to Dirt Modifieds. He cannot deny, however, statistically he fits best in a Midget.\n\nSince joining John Seaman's TSR #63 team in July of 2008, Keeler has\n\nposted seven top-10 finishes in eight Northeastern Midget Association starts. He'll take a second place in NEMA's '09 opener at Monadnock into the Friday night, June 26 event at Lee USA Speedway.\n\n\"I'm definitely fond of Lee,\" says Keeler who has driven a True Value\n\nModified and Supermodified as well as a Midget there. Being one of the fastest cars at Monadnock - \"I finally felt comfortable there\"- was a major boost.\n\nKeeler needed some late heroics to beat Aaron and William Wall at\n\nMonadnock. Adam Cantor and John Zych Jr. also got off to impressive\n\nstarts as they join veterans Nokie Fornoro and Russ and Greg Stoehr as contenders to dethrone champion Randy Cabral and Tim Bertrand. NASCAR Sprint Cup star Ryan Newman, in a second Bertrand car, will be the Lee headliner.\n\n\"A victory is definitely in our future,\" predicts Keeler. Although he\n\n\"expects to make all the NEMA events\" he says the team \"does not talk about points. Jon wants us to have a good time but that starts with good finishes. Getting a lot of points in not a bad thing.\"\n\nKeeler will also campaign a pair of ISMA Supermodifieds in '09. He's\n\nlooking forward to dates at Stafford Speedway (July 7), Waterford\n\nSpeedbowl (Aug. 15) and Thompson Speedway (Oct. 18) when NEMA and ISMA are both on the agenda.\n\n\"I love twitchy race cars and the Midgets are twitchy,\" Keeler offers.\n\n\"I love the movement. You can kind of throw a Midget around. I\n\nabsolutely love going through traffic in a Midget.\"\n\nDriving his own car, he won at Waterford in 2006. In his third race\n\nwith TSR he was second there last August. Keeler's first NEMA podium\n\nfinish was a second at Star Speedway in 2005.\n\nAlthough the Southbury-based TSR operation is only minutes away, Keeler leaves maintaining the #63 to Seaman. \"He enjoys tinkering,\" says Keeler, pointing out \"the car is always ready off the trailer. Jon runs a good team.\"\n\nThe #63 wound up ninth in owner points last year, Jeremy Frankoski\n\ncollecting five top-eights before leaving.\n\nThe only finish outside of the top-10 for TSR came at Beech Ridge in\n\nMaine. Keeler was leading the feature when the fuel pump drive system failed.\n\nKeeler operates MKM Property Management LLC in Danbury. It stands for Mike Keeler Motorsports. Brockton, MA - Jeff Horn, a New England open-cockpit mainstay, will be the first of several high profile names to drive a Bertrand midget in 2009 Northeastern Midget Association competition. Horn, who has 19 career NEMA wins, will drive the Esslinger-powered #39 Drinan car at the club’s season opener Saturday night May 23 at Monadnock Speedway.\n\nTim Bertrand and Randy Cabral, in the #47, will begin defense of the owner and driver championships at Monandock. It is the first of 17 races on the ’09 schedule.\n\nAccording to Bertrand, current Sprint Cup competitor and one-time USAC open-cockpit star Ryan Newman will drive the #39 at Lee USA Speedway on Friday night, June 26. Current USAC driver Cole Carter, son of the legendary open wheel chauffeur Pancho Carter, will drive at Waterford Speedbowl on July 25 and at Seekonk’s “Boston Louie” on Aug. 8 in a new car that is currently being constructed.\n\nBertrand also said Newman is “tentatively scheduled” to drive the car at Lee and Canaan Speedways in September. There is also the possibility of other drivers to appear within the Bertrand stable in 2009 dependent upon sponsorship opportunities that the team is working on.\n\n“Jeff Horn is the perfect choice to start this program off,” said Bertrand. “We are there to race but he’ll also be feeling the car out a little bit for us to ensure Ryan has a solid ride for Lee. Monadnock is a place where experienced guys seem to do well and few guys know the place better than Jeff. I also like Jeff because he respects the equipment having owned his own cars for years.”\n\nPlans for Newman to drive for Bertrand at Lee last year were rained out. Currently driving the US Army car for the Stewart-Hass team, Newman was one of the top open cockpit drivers in the nation before moving to NASCAR. He has a Midget and Silver Crown championship on his resume.\n\nCarter, who will drive midgets, sprints and silver crown cars this year, is the third generation of Carter racers beginning with grandfather Duane and his late uncle Dana. Father Pancho, a sprint and champ car stalwart for many years, made 17 Indianapolis 500 starts. Brockton, MA - For the first time since joining the Northeastern Midget Association as a 16-year old in 2001, Adam Cantor “feels confident in saying I’m a contender.” Pointing out “it’s all about confidence and seat time,” the Dix Hills, NY resident says “it is a matter of feeling comfortable” in his surroundings\n\nNEMA will return to action Friday night, June 26 at New Hampshire’s Lee USA Speedway. Fourth at Lee last year, Cantor points out “two definite grooves” makes Lee a challenge.\n\nCantor grabbed some interest with a hard-earned fifth in NEMA’s opener at Monadnock Speedway. Part of a first-lap incident that resulted in suspension damage, he came from last in a car “that was very difficult to drive.” One of the top cars in the first practice session, he’s convinced “we would have been one of the cars to watch.”\n\nMonadnock also made contenders out of Mike Keeler (TSR Motorsports) and Wall Motorsports drivers William and Aaron Wall – the second, third and fourth finishers between winner Randy Cabral (Bertrand #47) and Cantor.\n\nNokie Fornoro (Jarret 4) , Greg Stoehr (Stoehr 26b), Russ Stoehr (Angelillo 45) and Erica Santos (Breault 44) will go to Lee hoping to rebound after disappointments at Monadnock.\n\nA “realist,” Cantor, who drives for his dad Allen, is aiming for consistency, believing “when you are consistent things take care of themselves.” He made great improvements as a driver last year, finishing fourth in both driver and owner points. He posted 10 top fives including a second in the season finale at Twin State Speedway.\n\nAdmitting he came to NEMA “with visions of grandeur,” the one-time Go-Kart standout now understands “you go as far as your resources will take you. There comes a point when you realize you’ve done your best.” That's when, he continues, “you set little goals and then go after them.”\n\nA two-time winner, Cantor, part of the great young movement of ’01, remembers the feeling coming to NEMA. “I remember racing against guys like Drew Fornoro, Bobby Seymour, Russ Stoehr,” he says. “It was a privilege to race against them and you showed them great respect when they were around. It was always on my mind to not wreck them. You were there to learn from them.” He believes there is “much less respect” now.\n\nCantor’s last win came at Adirondack Speedway in 2005. He also won at All Star Speedway in 2003.\n\nNEMA NUGGET: Among the happiest drivers at Monadnock was Doug Cleveland. He and his team arrived after practice and then broke before turning a lap in his heat. Starting last in the feature, he came to 10th at the checkered. Brockton, MA - Tim Bertrand and Randy Cabral #47 will begin defense of their respective championships (owner and driver) when the Northeastern Midget Association begins the 2009 season Saturday night (May 23) at Monadnock Speedway. It will be the 57th season opener for NEMA.\n\n“Rule changes have equaled competition up a little bit and it has forced our team to be on our game a little more,” says Bertrand. He expects a torrid battle for the championships that will include, among others, Nokie Fornoro is the Mike Jarret #4, Russ Stoehr in the Gene Angelillo #45 and Greg Stoehr in the family #26. Other contenders include Erica Santos in the Ed Breault #44 and Adam Cantor in the family #7ny.\n\n“We are excited about beginning the defense of our championships,” said Bertrand. “We expect it to be difficult. Several cars have tested well.”\n\nGetting off the mark with a strong effort will be the concern for the likes of Doug and Brian Cleveland, Chris Leonard, Andy Shlatz and Aaron Wall.\n\nMonadnock, which kicks off a 17-race agenda, is one of the few tracks where Cabral and Bertrand have not tasted victory. They have, however, won three season openers including last year at Waterford Speedbowl.\n\nAccording to Bertrand, the #47 team has been purposefully quiet over the off-season but has hardly been idle over the past month. “We were just not very good at Monadnock last year,” Bertrand continues. “With the help of Lou Cicconi, Danny Drinan and Glen Cabral, we have made some significant chassis/suspension changes on the Drinan chassis for Monadnock that we believe will be hopeful for our overall short track program. That’s all we’re saying for now and will hope for the best.”\n\nGreg Stoehr (2), Russ Stoehr and Fornoro have all been winners at the tricky Monadnock that, Bertrand says, “favors” the experienced, veteran competitors. On the owner’s side, Angelillo is far and away the leader with 12 wins, 11 with the now retired Drew Fornoro. The last one came last year with driver Joey Payne.\n\nA NEMA NUGGET: Nokie Fornoro will begin his 34th year in Midgets looking for his 108th victory. He recalls “actually lying” to get his first Midget ride with George Ferguson at Wall Stadium back in 1976. “I told him I was experienced and he finally got tired of hearing me,” recalls Fornoro. “I went out and led much of the race before being passed late by Lenny Boyd in Dewey Cali’s Badger. It was only after the race when Boyd came out to congratulate me on my first Midget ride that Ferguson knew about it. I did drive for him some more. A new team name, new sponsors, and a new engine program. Andy Schlatz (Owner Lite #20 and Driver NEMA #77) is really looking forward to the 2009 season.\n\nUnder the Hollywood Motorsports banner, Chris Haskell will be piloting Andy's #20 in the NEMA Lites. Chris was the 2007 750cc Champion at Whip City Raceway in Westfield, MA. D.J. Cavaliere from Cavaliere Onsite Recycling and Equipment Sales in Stamford, CT has signed on as a major sponsor. Long time friend and sponsor Kurt Rafferty from Rafferty Fine Grading in Enfield, CT will continue with his prized support for the team.\n\nA new engine program is the major change. A PBH Indy Honda 2.4 NEMA Lite / Sportsman motor is going to be the power plant under the hood of the COR Equipment Sales, REMU Screening Buckets, Rubble Master,and Rafferty Fine Grading #20 Lite Midget. PBHIndy.com has been working hard on getting this engine program off the ground and Andy is honored to be representing Honda in their first year in NEMA.\n\nSkeet Busher from PBH Indy has been a tremendous help to Andy. An ever growing number of America’s top performance equipment manufacturers see the Twin Cam Honda Midget engine as perhaps part of the answer to the future of Midget Racing both in terms of cost and performance. To use the example set by the Ford Focus Midget Engine, the PBH Indy Twin Cam Midget Engine should be able to run 40 races on a couple of sets of valve springs costing about $700.00.\n\nDave Haskell and Andy having been working hard all off-season getting the totally rebuilt #20 race ready.\n\nIn the NEMA Midgets, Andy is also excited to be back behind the wheel of the Luggelle Motorsports #77 also with support from COR Equipment Sales and Rafferty Fine Grading.\n\nAndy looks forward to 2009 in the #77: \"Mike was great to work with last year. We really had some fun last year. In the last couple months of the season we hit on some things and the car started to get better and better each week. I really think we will have a good season. I feel we can be a top ten car and I am really ready to get the season started on May 23rd at Monadnock. We may be an underdog team, but I think we will turn some heads this year.\" Brockton, MA - Randy Cabral will be after a second-straight season-opening win when the Northeastern Midget Association 2009 campaign begins Saturday night, May 23 at Monadnock Speedway. Amazingly, two-straight season-opening wins has been done only seven times in NEMA's 57 years, Ben Seitz the last to do it in 2004-05.\n\nOthers to accomplish it were Bill Eldridge (1954-55), Dutch Schaefer\n\n(1959-60), Walt Gale (1966-67), Johnny Coy (1970-71), Armond Holley (1976-77) and Drew Fornoro (1982-83). Fornoro's six opening wins top the list followed by Schaefer (4) and Eldridge (4). Jeff Horn has three.\n\nMonadnock is one of seven tracks on NEMA's 17-stop agenda. Lee USA, Thompson, Stafford, Seekonk, Waterford, Twin State (Claremont) and Canaan are also on the schedule. The NEMA Lites will make 16 stops in 2009.\n\nNEMA again will feature a mix of youth and veterans. The return of Russ Stoehr in Gene Angelillo's #45 means that three of NEMA's all-time top-10 winners will be in action this summer.\n\nStoehr, with 39 victories, sits fourth, three behind Nokie Fornoro. The\n\ntop two - Drew Fornoro (85) and Dave Humphrey (72) - are far out in\n\nfront of the field. Defending champion Randy Cabral is tied for 10th\n\n(with Lee Smith) with 21 victories. Ahead of Cabral are Johnny Mann\n\n(29), Bobby Seymour (23), Bill Eldridge (23) and Joe Csiki (22).\n\nThe Stoehr brothers will be racing against each other again for the\n\nfirst time in five years. Russ and Greg, in the Circle Performance Machine-powered #29, are second only to the Fornoro boys when it comes to brother combinations. They have 47 wins with the Seymours - Bobby and Mike - in third with 41.\n\nCabral's eight victories in 17 races last year is tied for eighth on the\n\nlist of \"most dominating seasons\" in NEMA history. Cabral's winning\n\npercentage in the Bertrand Motorsports #47 was a lusty .444.\n\nFirst place belongs to Joe Csiki who \"batted\" .645 in 1963, winning 11\n\nof 17 shows including a record six straight. Two .500 efforts - Dick\n\nBrown (five-of-10 in '61) and Drew Fornoro (eight-for-16 in '83) are\n\ntied for second. Nokie Fornoro's .478 (10-of-21 for Mike Scrivani in\n\n'81) is fourth. A trio - Johnny Mann's five-for-11 in '74, Dave\n\nHumphrey's 7-for-15 in '68 and Drew Fornoro's 7-for-15 in '89 share\n\nfifth with a .450 mark.\n\nCabral shares eighth with Bobby White who won eight of 15 starts back in 1979. NEMA's other \". 400 hitters\" are Russ Stoehr (6-for-14, .428) in '97 and Drew Fornoro (eight-for-19, .421) in '82.\n\nCabral takes a streak of nine straight years (2000-'08) with at least\n\none victory into the '09 season. That ties him with Drew Fornoro\n\n(1982-1990) in that category behind Humphrey's 14 (1966-1980) and Russ Stoehr's 10 (1993-2002).\n\nNokie Fornoro has won NEMA features on 14 different tracks, the leader among active drivers. Russ Stoehr has won on 12. The all-time leader is Dave Humphrey with 20, one better than Drew Fornoro. Mike Scrivani Jr. was only five but the memories are vivid. The Northeastern Midget Association president, the son of a New England legend, figures this is his 50th year of involvement with Midgets.\n\n“I remember sleeping between the gear box and the tool box in the back of an Oldsmobile station wagon that we towed with,” Scrivani begins. “We never did get the smell of gear oil out of that car. It made my mother so mad.”\n\nThey traveled all over the east. “Before we used to get to Danbury, we’d stop at the Fornoro house for something to eat,” he continues. “That’s’ how long I’ve known Drew and Nokie Fornoro. They lived on a cul-de-sac and there were rigs all the way up the road.”\n\nBack in 1981, Fornoro drove a Scrivani-owned car to the championship, posting 14 podium finishes in 20 starts. Mike Jr. presently works on Fornoro’s current ride, the Jarret #4.\n\nAbout to begin his sixth year as president, Scrivani has missed very little of NEMA’s history. Still one of the most forward-looking Midget clubs in the country, NEMA kicks off the 2009 campaign at Monadnock Speedway on May 23. It is the first of 17 races and seven tracks.\n\nUnder Scrivani, NEMA has seen its popularity soar along with its speeds. He’s been a guiding force in bringing new faces into the club evidenced by the introduction of the NEMA Lites last year. “I think we are in great shape,” he says. “We’ll be at established tracks with established competitors.”\n\nWith the likes of defending champion Randy Cabral, both Stoehr brothers, Erica Santos, Adam Cantor, Doug Cleveland, Chris Leonard and Fornoro all dedicated to strong efforts, 2009 could be one of the best seasons yet.\n\nScrivani has seen a lot of them. By age 13, he was working in earnest on a car that over the years was driven by Billy Eldridge, Ray Burke, Hank Williams, Dave Humphrey, Billy Randall. He actually owned his first car – a Ford 60 – before he had a driver’s license. His father had sold his car to go Modified racing. “I found out about it from somebody else. I was so mad I didn’t talk to him for two or three days. Then he gave me some money and told me to go buy a car from Wally White.”\n\nIt didn’t last long. With Meatball Orlando driving, they won a heat at Star Speedway before scattering the engine. Mike Sr. then bought the old car back and for a while they campaigned both the midget and the modified. Brockton, MA -Doug Cleveland, about to start his 34th season as a Northeastern Midget Association competitor, is “one of the old school guys.” He is currently making ready for NEMA’s 57th season opener May 23 at Monadnock Speedway.\n\n“If there is a race we’ll try to make it,” continues Sudbury, MA resident Cleveland, part of a two-car team that includes brother Brian. “We’re aiming for the opener and see what happens after that.”\n\nDoug and wife Linda, his partner since 1987, are the very heartbeat of NEMA. Linda, involved as a scorer since 1993, won the Wen Kelley Memorial Award last year. Cleveland has won almost all of NEMA’s awards including the Ray Roberts (last year) and Johnny Thomson (1999) trophies.\n\nIronically, 1987 was also the year Cleveland became an owner/driver. He currently campaigns a self-built car powered by a Mopar engine.\n\nThe 51-year old wound up 10th in driver points last summer. A realist, he proudly sees himself as one of the guys “who would collect bottles and cans to buy a tire” and defines “a good night” as “when the car rolls on the trailer and I don’t have to spend a lot of money fixing it.”\n\nHe’s been at it since jumping into a car owned by his late father Jim and uncle Paul. His car continues to carry the family number – 87 – and a tribute to his dad and cousin Mark, the latter driving the car when Doug took other rides. “It is absolutely important for us to do that,” he says. “Without it, the young guys wouldn’t have a clue of the club’s history. Truth is, they wouldn’t be there if wasn’t for guys like them.”\n\nHis single win came in Jimmy O’Brien’s car in Quebec (Sanair) in 1977. “They can’t take that away,” he says. “Neither of us had any money but we pulled it off one night. We beat Bob Cicconi.” He drove for a number of owners including Ed Czyzewski and Carl Kibbe before going on his own.\n\nThe Clevelands travel with a truck and motor home and gas is a big part of the yearly expenses that approaches $9,000. It has to be a “close to the vest” operation. He does not crash a lot, something he credits to experience more than economics. “I’ve been doing is so long, I don’t stick my nose where it shouldn’t be,” he says. Still, he insists, “once the helmet goes on I don’t think about anything but driving” and he still impresses himself with “wow moves.”\n\nHe is an unabashed cheerleader for NEMA, especially the willingness to help each other. “It is more so than other divisions,” says Cleveland, who received engine help from Circle Performance Machine’s John Andruk last year. “It’s been like that for as long as I can remember.”\n\nMonadnock is the first of 17 races at eight different tracks on the ’09 schedule. Greg and Russ Stoehr will be Northeastern Midget Association foes again for the first time since 1994. The sons of Paul Stoehr, they make up the second winingest brother combination in NEMA history.\n\nWhen NEMA opens its 57th season May 23 at Monadnock Speedway, Greg will be in the Mazda-powered #26 that he drove to a pair of wins in ’08. Over the past two seasons, Greg has won twice at Monadnock.\n\nRuss, back in the seat after five years away, returns to the Angelillo #45 team. That combination produced nine victories and three-straight championships (2000-2002). His last win came at Thompson’s World Series in 2002.\n\nThe Bridgewater, MA-based Stoehr brothers are part of NEMA’s strong “veteran class” that includes Nokie Fornoro, Jeff Horn, Doug Cleveland and defending champion Randy Cabral, the latter a winner every year since 2000.\n\nThey’ll do battle over a 17-race agenda on eight different tracks. Russ has won on five of them.\n\n“The theory remains the same; the corners are all in the same place,” says Russ concerning the layoff. The speeds, however, are considerably faster – “like a full second at Thompson.”\n\nThey’re both championship contenders. “There are things you just know when you accept that ride,” Russ says of the Angelillo relationship. Greg hopes to bring acknowledgement to engine builder Circle Performance Machine.\n\nStill, don’t expect any sizzling sibling rivalry from the co-owners of Motor Cars International in Bridgewater, MA. It is home, in fact, for the #26. “We’ve done this before,” says Russ.\n\nThe 1993 Thompson World Series remains the greatest brother v. brother battle in NEMA history, Greg, in the Zahar #38B, passing Russ, in the Beane #26, on the last lap. “I do owe him for that one,” says Russ who has not driven since taking a couple rides in 2003.\n\nGreg, who won twice at Seekonk in ’94, was mostly watching when Russ won championship No. 2 with Beane in 1997 and three, four and five with Angelillo. Russ’ first title came at age 26 with Beane in 1990.\n\n“We worked together well, always communicated well,” remembers Russ, who replaced Drew Fornoro in the Angelillo car. “We just jelled and put in all together for three years.”\n\nThe relationship with Beane remains close. Russ was very much involved with Greg’s return. “We decided to use the Mazda engine Bruce helped to develop,” says Russ. “It is still in the car.”\n\nLast fall, Russ “had no interest” when Angelillo approached him about driving again. He found himself having second thoughts and talked it over with wife who responded with “if that’s what you really want to do, then do it.” He then got back to Angelillo and informed him\n\n“if the opportunity comes up again…”\n\nHe replaces Joey Payne Jr., the guy who replaced him in the Angelillo seat. Over the winter of 2000-01, Bobby Seymour was at the forefront of an effort to make the Northeastern Midget Association “more friendly” to younger drivers. The minimum age for drivers was lowered considerably.\n\n“It was a must,” says Seymour, “one of those things that had to be done.” Young drivers, he says, had “a lot of different avenues” coming out of go-karts and NEMA was not one of them. We had to change or lose them.”\n\nBobby Santos III and Adam Cantor are products of that move.\n\nThe list continues with teenagers William Wall, the 2008 Rookie of the Year, and Jeff Abold, 20, a winner last year at Seekonk in the Seymour #29. “Actually, there are great young drivers all over the place,” insists Seymour, adding “there are three or four ready to move up from NEMA Lites.”\n\nThe Lites produced several candidates including Jake and P.J. Stergios, Anthony Marvuglio, Todd Bertrand and Jesse State. Aaron Wall is another hopeful. “Economics is a factor right now,” Seymour says, “but they’re ready.”\n\nThe 58th NEMA season opens Saturday night May 23 at Monadnock Speedway, the first of 17 dates on seven tracks. The NEMA Lites second season begins Friday night, June 5 at Seekonk Speedway, the first of 14 events. Seymour predicts an average field of 15-to-16 cars for the Lites this summer.\n\nVeterans – defending champ Randy Cabral, Greg and Russ Stoehr, Nokie Fornoro, Erica Santos, Doug Cleveland – are still the lifeblood of NEMA. The club, however, continues to make room for youth and the combination, suggests Seymour, “makes NEMA as good as any regional series in the country” with at least 10-potential winners every race.\n\nWall, who finished seventh in points last season, plans on a full-time ’09 assault in the family-owned #5. Last season was the first time on asphalt for the Whip City Speedway product who had three top fives. Abold will be very busy as well, his dance card including not only NEMA but ISMA and some USAC Midget dates. The second-generation driver had three podium finishes - all at Seekonk.\n\nSeymour remains a big supporter of the program, and hopes for more recognition for the Lites in ’09. “My kids run Little T (Thompson) so I’m there a lot,” he says. “I watch these kids 13, 14, 15 and marvel at what they’re capable of. They are very good.”\n\nAbold and Wall came to NEMA with plenty of experience in Quarter Midgets and Go Karts.\n\n“When you asked the young kids ‘where are you going to race next?’ you would hear everything but midgets.” The cost of motors and tires made the move to NEMA very difficult if not impossible. The Lites, using Ford Focus or Oldsmobile Quad 4 engines, take aim at reducing those costs.\n\nHERE AND THERE: Bobby Seymour was 21 when he drove a Midget for the first time. Brother Mike was 23. For many years, drivers didn’t get into Midgets until their late teens and early 20s and that includes the greats…There has been at least one “first time” winner in NEMA every year since 2001. The list includes Ryan Dolan, Kyle Carpenter, Bobby Santos, Adam Cantor and Jeff Abold. Although they were teenagers when they did it, they came to NEMA with a lot of Quarter Midget and Go Kart experience… Brockton, MA - Pete Falconi, the voice of the Northeastern Midget Association, remembers being “a little scared” watching the Midgets at his family’s Westboro Speedway. “As a young kid, they looked so dangerous, you were almost afraid to watch them. You were afraid of what could happen.”\n\nHe, of course, has conquered that “fear.” Falconi, 54, will start his seventh season as NEMA’s announcer when the club opens the 2009 season Saturday, May 23 at Monadnock Speedway.\n\n“I enjoy the camaraderie in NEMA,” says the son of New England Auto Racers Hall of Famer John Falconi. “The racing is, of course, very exciting and I really love getting around to all the different tracks. I enjoy seeing the different divisions of racing.”\n\nNEMA, facing a 17-race schedule in ’09, will visit seven different tracks. Ever-increasing speed has made NEMA a sought after attraction. “Places like Waterford and Seekonk are so fast,” Falconi says. “You look down and there’s only two or three laps left. You’re amazed.”\n\nIt is also a never-ending challenge for Falconi.\n\n“You have to get into the rhythm,” continues Falconi. “Stock cars are a little more predictable. You have to follow Midgets all the way around. Still, usually more happens than I can get on the microphone.”\n\nSometimes, he “can see things shaping up,” the result of “learning more about the drivers and the moves they like to make.” Long-time NEMA competitors Mike and Bobby Seymour, he says, were instrumental in his becoming a Midget announcer.\n\nPart of New Hampshire International Speedway’s Sprint Cup weekends for the past 10 years, Falconi had “stationary jobs at Stafford Motor Speedway in the 1970s and at Lee USA in the 80s. While he admits to being “raised on the stock car side of things,” he was hardly a stranger to the Midgets in general and NEMA in particular.\n\nHis father, a one-time car owner, moved into promotion at Westboro (before owning it), Thompson and West Peabody. Pete watched a lot of NEMA history including Dave Humphrey’s exploits, Jerry Wall’s storied Yellow jacket and the Rollie Lindblad-inspired Badger era. “I was at Westboro from the 1960s until the place closed in 1985,” he says.\n\nHe remembers Nokie Fornoro dominating in the Scrivani car in the early 80s. “I don’t think Nokie has lost a step,” says Falconi. “He hasn’t lost a thing and what is amazing is the kids have come up to run with him and guys like Joey Payne.” He is “very impressed” with youngster Jeff Abold (“he just sort of glides getting it done”). Defending champion Randy Cabral, Bobby and Erica Santos, Adam Cantor fit “nicely” between them. He is “looking forward” to battles between Greg and Russ Stoehr, the latter back in Gene Angelillo’s #45.\n\nThe future for Midgets is “golden.” They have become a stepping-stone thanks to the likes of Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart and Ryan Newman. He is a big supporter of the NEMA Lites pointing out “kids are now coming out of quarter midgets and go karts, turning 16 and moving into Midgets. I think the Midgets have as strong a future as any division anywhere.” The Northeastern Midget Association heads into its 58th season with a 17-race campaign that includes several “traditional” stops. NEMA, which dates back to 1953, is one of the oldest Midget sanctioning bodies in the country.\n\nThe winged wonders will open the 2009 campaign on Saturday night, May 23 at New Hampshire’s Monadnock Speedway, one of three stops for the New Hampshire quarter-mile. The agenda also includes traditional venues Thompson and Stafford Speedways and Waterford Speedbowl in Connecticut, Massachusetts’ Seekonk Speedway and Lee USA Speedway in the Granite State.\n\nTwin State Speedway and Canaan Fair Speedway are on the schedule as well. It will be NEMA’s first visit to the third-mile Canaan since 2002. Lee and Canaan share the Sept. 18-19 (Friday-Saturday) weekend.\n\n“We believe we have a solid, well-spaced schedule considering the economy,” said NEMA President Mike Scrivani Jr. “These are good Midget tracks. Guys know what they’re doing.\n\nNEMA will share dates with the International Supermodified Association (ISMA), True Value Modified Series (TVMS) and American Canadian Tour (ACT) over the season.\n\nThe NEMA Lites division returns for its second campaign with a 13-race schedule that begins Friday night, June 5 at Seekonk.\n\nThe busy schedule includes Stafford’s Carquest Extreme Tuesday\n\n(July 7), Seekonk’s Boston Louie (Aug. 8), Waterford’s Wings & Wheels (Aug. 15), Twin State’s Open Wheel Sunday (Oct. 4), Seekonk’s DAV (Oct. 11-12) and Thompson’s World Series (Oct. 17-18).\n\nThe NEMA Lites, coming off a very successful inaugural effort, faces a schedule made up of third and quarter miles. NEMA expects as many as a half dozen new teams will join the Lites this season..\n\nLee’s season-ending October fest (Oct. 24-25) remains tentative for both NEMA and the Lites.\n\n2009 NEMA SCHEDULE - Table Here2009 NEMA LITES SCHEDULE - Table Here"
