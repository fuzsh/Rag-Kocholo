        "text": "The target date is September 2017. Congdon said a tennant will be ready to move in, a not-yet-started-up microbrewery that will call itself Guggman Haus Brewing Co..\n\nBy the fall of 2015, the long-neglected building at 1701 Gent Ave. looked hopeless. Some walls were standing, but the roof was gone. The windows also were gone. Animals entered and exited freely.\n\nBut a small local group of automobile history enthusiasts wasn't ready to give up on this place, once the headquarters of maybe the most unusual racing team in Indianapolis 500 history. In the 1920s and '30s the Boyle racing team in the was wildly successful. Its cars won the Indy 500 three times, finished in the top six 13 times and won the pole position four times. But its financing was murky. The boss was \"Umbrella\" Mike Boyle, a shadowy labor leader from Chicago who twice was put behind bars: once for jury fixing, once for violating an anti-trust law. As the motorsports website Speedway Sightings put it, Boyle \"walked the fine line between crooked politicians and the Chicago mob.\"\n\nBoyle quit racing in the 1940s, and the old racing garage on the north side was used for other things. It had been vacant more than a decade, seized by the county for back taxes when the auto enthusiasts acquired it. They formed a nonprofit called Boyle Racing Project Foundation LLC, and joined forces with the preservation group Indiana Landmarks.\n\nOn Thursday night the group doubled the size of its kitty. Some 300 people attended a fundraiser at the Dallara IndyCar Factory in Speedway which raised $60,000. The would-be rehabbers now have $120,000.\n\nThat's still far from the $750,000 they'll need to transform the 15,000-square-foot building, \"but it was a very good evening,\" said Jeff Congdon, one of the group's leaders, \"and we have a lot of confidence this is going to get done.\"\n\nThe biggest single donation Thursday was the $25,000 from James and Joan Voyles. Joan Voyles' father was Johnnie Parsons, the 1950 Indy 500 winner, and her stepfather was Duane Carter, who raced in the 500 in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. She is the sister and half-sister of Johnny Parsons and Pancho Carter, prominent Indy 500 drivers from the 1970s through the '90s.\n\nBoyle Racing's heyday ended some 70 years ago, but on Thursday descendants of the organization's major players came together: Bill Shaw, the son of Boyle's top driver, Wilbur Shaw, a three-time Indy 500 winner; Tony Henning, the nephew of legendary chief mechanic Harry “Cotton” Henning (and son of Paul Henning, creator of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"); and Fred Geyser and Michael J. Geyser, the grandson and great-grandson of Mike Boyle.\n\nThe target date for completion is September 2017. Congdon said a tenant will be ready to move in: a microbrewery that will call itself Guggman Haus Brewing Co."
