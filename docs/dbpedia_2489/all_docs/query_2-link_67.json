        "text": "\"Dwayne Carter\" redirects here. For the racecar driver, see Duane Carter.\n\n\"Weezy\" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Wheezy.\n\nDwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September 27, 1982), known professionally as Lil Wayne, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation, and is often mentioned among the greatest rappers of all time. Wayne's career began in 1995, when he was signed by rapper Birdman to his record label Cash Money Records, becoming the youngest member of the label at age eleven. From then on, he was the flagship artist of Cash Money Records before ending his association with the imprint in June 2018.\n\nIn 1995, Wayne was placed in a duo with label-mate B.G. and they released an album, True Story in July of that year, although Wayne (at the time known as Baby D) only appeared on three tracks. Wayne and B.G. soon formed the Southern hip hop group Hot Boys with Cash Money label-mates Juvenile and Turk in 1997; they released their debut album Get It How U Live! in October that year. The Hot Boys became popular following the release of the album Guerrilla Warfare (1999) and their song \"Bling Bling\".\n\nWayne's debut album, Tha Block Is Hot (1999), was his solo breakthrough, followed by Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2003). He reached wider popularity and critical acclaim with his fourth and fifth albums Tha Carter (2004) and Tha Carter II (2005), as well as several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. He propelled to the forefront of hip hop with his sixth album Tha Carter III (2008), with first-week sales of over one million copies in the US. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and included the consecutive hit singles \"A Milli\", \"Mrs. Officer\" (featuring Bobby V and Kidd Kidd), \"Got Money\" (featuring T-Pain), and \"Lollipop\" (featuring Static Major)—the latter became his first song to peak the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn February 2010, Wayne released his seventh studio album, Rebirth, which experimented with rap rock and was met with generally negative reviews. A month later in March, he began serving an 8-month jail sentence for criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. His eighth album, I Am Not a Human Being (2010) was released during his incarceration, while the release of his ninth album, Tha Carter IV (2011) coincided months after his release from prison. Tha Carter IV sold 964,000 copies in its first-week in the United States and received mixed reviews. His twelfth studio album Tha Carter V (2018)—preceded by I Am Not a Human Being II (2013) and Free Weezy Album (2015)—was released following long-term delays and label disputes, and was met with 480,000 in first-week sales. Wayne's thirteenth album, Funeral (2020) became his fifth non-consecutive number one album.\n\nWayne has sold over 200 million records worldwide, including more than 25 million albums and 92 million digital tracks in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has won five Grammy Awards, eleven BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and eight NAACP Image Awards. On September 27, 2012, he became the first male artist to surpass Elvis Presley with the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100, with 109 songs. Wayne founded his own record label, Young Money Entertainment in 2005, which has signed artists including Drake, Tyga and Nicki Minaj.\n\nEarly life\n\nDwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and spent his first few years in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana's 17th Ward. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was two and his father permanently abandoned the family. When CBS interviewer Katie Couric asked why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name, Carter explained that \"I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne\". Asked if his father knew of this, Carter replied, \"He knows now\". Carter has said that he considers his deceased stepfather Reginald \"Rabbit\" McDonald to be his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to McDonald.\n\nCarter was enrolled in the gifted program at Lafayette Elementary School. He later attended Eleanor McMain Secondary School for two years, where he was an honor student and a member of the drama club, playing the Tin Man in the school's production of The Wiz. After matriculating to Marion Abramson Senior High School, Carter dropped out at age 14 to focus on his musical career.\n\nCarter wrote his first rap song at age eight. In the summer of 1991, he met rapper and Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan \"Baby\" Williams (known currently as Birdman), who mentored him and encouraged his love of hip-hop; Birdman included Carter on several Cash Money tracks, and Carter would often record freestyle raps on Williams' answering machine.\n\nCareer\n\n1997–1999: Career beginnings and Hot Boys\n\nIn 1997, Carter joined the Hot Boys along with rappers Juvenile, B.G., and Turk. At age 14, Carter was the youngest member at the time. Hot Boys' debut album Get It How U Live! was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut Guerrilla Warfare, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200. During their career, the Hot Boys had a charting single \"We on Fire\" from Get It How U Live!. Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single \"Back That Azz Up\", which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Let 'Em Burn, a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded during 1999 and 2000, came out in 2003, several years after the group disbanded. It reached No. 3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 14 on the Billboard 200.\n\n1999–2004: Tha Block Is Hot, Lights Out, and 500 Degreez\n\nCarter's debut solo album, Tha Block Is Hot, was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA less than two months after its release. The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \"Best New Artist\", and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was \"Tha Block Is Hot\". After the release of Tha Block Is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \"Bling Bling\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. Carter's verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.\n\nHis second album, Lights Out, was released in 2000, and failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was \"Get Off the Corner\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \"Shine\" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Carter was featured on the single, \"Number One Stunna\" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nCarter's third album, 500 Degreez, was released in 2002. It followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor, it also failed to match the success of his debut. The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. The lead single was \"Way of Life\" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Carter was featured on the single \"Neva Get Enuf\" by 3LW.\n\n2004–2006: Tha Carter, Tha Carter II, and Like Father, Like Son\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Carter's fourth studio album, Tha Carter, was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes. In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature dreadlocks. Tha Carter gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single \"Go DJ\" became a Top 5 Hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. After the release of Tha Carter, Lil Wayne was featured in Destiny's Child's single \"Soldier\" with T.I., which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.\n\nTha Carter II, the follow-up to the original Tha Carter album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime Cash Money Records producer Mannie Fresh, who had left the label. Tha Carter II sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \"Fireman\" became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included \"Grown Man\" with Currensy and \"Shooter\" with R&B singer Robin Thicke. Carter also appeared on a remix of Bobby Valentino's \"Tell Me\", which rose to number 13 on the U.S. R&B Charts. In 2005, Carter was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money. However, as of late 2007, Carter reported having stepped down from the management of both labels and had handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.\n\nIn 2006, Carter collaborated with Birdman for the album Like Father, Like Son, whose first single \"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\", reached number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2006–2007: Mixtapes and collaborations\n\nInstead of a follow-up solo album, Carter began to reach his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip hop singles. Of his many mixtapes, Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 received the most media exposure and critical review. Dedication 2, released in 2006, paired Carter with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track \"Georgia Bush\", in which Carter critiqued former US president George W. Bush's response to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the city of New Orleans. Da Drought 3 was released the following year and was available for free legal download. It contained Carter rapping over a variety of beats from recent hits by other musicians. A number of prominent hip hop magazines such as XXL and Vibe covered the mixtape. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone magazine considered the mixtapes Da Drought 3 and The Drought Is Over 2 (The Carter 3 Sessions) \"among the best albums of 2007\".\n\nDespite no album release for two years, Carter appeared in numerous singles as a featured performer, including \"Gimme That\" by Chris Brown, \"Make It Rain\" by Fat Joe, \"You\" by Lloyd, and \"We Takin' Over\" by DJ Khaled (also featuring Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and Birdman), \"Duffle Bag Boy\" by Playaz Circle, \"Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)\" by Wyclef Jean (also featuring Akon), and the remix to \"I'm So Hood\" by DJ Khaled (also featuring T-Pain, Young Jeezy, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Big Boi, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Rick Ross). All these singles charted within the top 20 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Rap Tracks, and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. On Birdman's 2007 album, 5 * Stunna, Carter appeared on the singles \"100 Million\" and \"I Run This\" among several other tracks. Carter also appeared on tracks from albums Getback by Little Brother, American Gangster by Jay-Z, and Graduation by Kanye West and Insomniac by Enrique Iglesias. \"Make it Rain\", a Scott Storch production that peaked at number 13 on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for 2008.\n\nVibe magazine ranked a list of 77 of Lil Wayne's songs from 2007 and ranked his verse in DJ Khaled's \"We Takin Over\" as his best of 2007, with \"Dough Is What I Got\" (a freestyle over the beat of Jay-Z's \"Show Me What You Got\") from Da Drought 3. At the end of 2007, The New Yorker magazine ranked him \"Rapper of the Year\", and GQ magazine named him \"Workaholic of the Year\". In 2008 he was named \"Best MC\" by Rolling Stone. Another article, built around Lil Wayne's 2007 mixtape work, cites his creative practice as an example of post-performance creative practice.\n\n2007–2010: Tha Carter III, We Are Young Money, and Rebirth\n\nIn 2007, Carter stated that he would reunite with Hot Boys, with plans to release an album after B.G.'s solo album Too Hood to Be Hollywood was completed. Tha Carter III was originally scheduled to be released in 2007, but it was delayed after several recordings were leaked and distributed through mixtapes, including The Drought Is Over Pt. 2 and The Drought Is Over Pt. 4. Lil Wayne initially planned to release The Leak, a separate album with leaked songs and four additional tracks, on December 18, 2007, with Tha Carter III delayed to March 18, 2008. Instead, The Leak became an EP with five songs and was released digitally on December 25, 2007.\n\nTha Carter III was released on June 10, 2008, with first-week sales of over 1 million copies, the first to do so since 50 Cent's The Massacre (2005). The album's first single \"Lollipop\", featuring Static Major, became the Carter's most successful song at the time, topping the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming his first top 10 single as a solo artist and his first number one on the chart. The third single \"Got Money\", featuring T-Pain, peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 100. Tha Carter III went on to win four Grammy Awards, including best rap album and best rap song, which he won for \"Lollipop\". On July 14, 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America certified Tha Carter III two times platinum. In October 2008, Lil Wayne announced plans to MTV News to re-release the album with new tracks, including a duet with Ludacris and remixes of \"A Milli\".\n\nCarter also appeared on R&B singles \"Girls Around the World\" by Lloyd, \"Love In This Club, Part II\" by Usher, \"Official Girl\" by Cassie, \"I'm So Paid\" by Akon, \"Turnin' Me On\" by Keri Hilson, and \"Can't Believe It\" by T-Pain; rap singles \"My Life\" by The Game, \"Shawty Say\" by David Banner, \"Swagga Like Us\" by T.I., \"Cutty Buddy\" by Mike Jones, All My Life (In the Ghetto) by Jay Rock and the remix to \"Certified\" by Glasses Malone; and pop single \"Let It Rock\" by new Cash Money artist Kevin Rudolf.\n\nIn 2008, Carter performed at the Voodoo Experience in October in New Orleans, which was described by Jonathan Cohen of Billboard as his biggest hometown headlining set of his career. He also performed at the Virgin Mobile Music Fest with Kanye West, where they performed the remix of \"Lollipop\" and lip-synced to Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\". Lil Wayne also performed at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards with Kid Rock (\"All Summer Long\"), Leona Lewis (\"DontGetIt (Misunderstood)\") and T-Pain (\"Got Money\") and performed \"Lollipop\" and \"Got Money\" on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He later performed at the homecoming rally at Vanderbilt University and the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, where he received 12 nominations. He won eight awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards, one of which included the \"MVP\" title. After M.I.A. dropped out of performing on the I Am Music Tour due to her pregnancy, Jay-Z performed \"Mr. Carter\" with Lil Wayne at select shows.\n\nFollowing Tha Carter III's achievement of selling over 3 million copies, becoming 2008's best-selling record, Carter re-signed with Cash Money Records for a multi-album deal.\n\nOn November 11, 2008, Carter became the first hip hop act to perform at the Country Music Association Awards, playing \"All Summer Long\" alongside Kid Rock, in which Carter inaudibly strummed guitar strings alongside the guitarist in Kid Rock's band. Shortly after, Wayne was nominated for eight Grammys – the most for any artist nominated that year. He was then named the first MTV Man of the Year at the end of 2008. He won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for \"A Milli\", Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for his appearance in T.I.'s single \"Swagga Like Us\", and Best Rap Song for \"Lollipop\". Tha Carter III won the award for Best Rap Album.\n\nPrior to the 2009 Grammy Awards, Wayne was featured in an interview with Katie Couric. On February 7, 2009, he presented the Top Ten List on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman. On April 24, 2009, he appeared on The View, discussing his GED. In September 2009, Carter was profiled in an episode of VH1's Behind the Music and was a presenter of the 2009 MTV Movie Awards. In film, Carter produced and composed music for and starred in the direct-to-video film Hurricane Season. A documentary of Carter, titled The Carter, was released at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nOn December 23, 2009, Carter released a collaboration album with Young Money, We Are Young Money, with its lead single being \"Every Girl\". The second single was \"BedRock\", featuring Lloyd, with the third being \"Roger That\". On May 24, 2010, the album was certified gold by the RIAA with over 500,000 copies sold. Carter is featured on the song, \"Revolver\", with Madonna for her greatest hits album, Celebration (2009). He was also featured on a Weezer song, \"Can't Stop Partying\", on Raditude (2009). In late 2008, Carter announced plans to reissue Tha Carter III with leftover recordings, and was to be titled Rebirth, originally scheduled to be released on April 7, 2009, before being delayed several times. Rebirth instead became his sixth solo album, released on February 2, 2010.\n\nTo support its release and that of We Are Young Money, Carter was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone and headlined the 'Young Money Presents: America's Most Wanted Music Festival', a United States and Canada–only concert tour which began on July 29, 2009. \"Prom Queen\", the first official single, debuted on January 27, 2009, immediately after a live Internet broadcast on Ustream of his concert in San Diego. It peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. On December 3, 2009, the second single, \"On Fire\", produced by Cool & Dre \"On Fire\" peaked at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. \"Drop the World\", which features Eminem, was the third single from the Rebirth.\n\n2010–2013: I Am Not a Human Being series and Tha Carter IV\n\nIn an interview on MTV's Mixtape Monday, Carter asserted the possibility of Tha Carter IV. He later announced that it would be released in late 2009 before the holiday season. Birdman had previously stated that Tha Carter IV would be packaged with Rebirth as a double disc album. However, Carter denied this idea saying that \"Tha Carter IV deserves Tha Carter IV\", adding that We Are Young Money may be packaged with Rebirth. However, both albums were released separately.\n\nIn June 2010, Lil Wayne appeared on two tracks to Kevin Rudolf's album, To the Sky. He appeared on the tracks \"I Made It (Cash Money Heroes)\" and \"Spit In Your Face\".\n\nOriginally thought to be an EP, Carter released his tenth album, I Am Not a Human Being, on his 28th birthday, September 27, 2010. The album has sold over 953,000 copies in the U.S. and spawned successful single \"Right Above It\", which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tha Carter IV was later delayed into 2011, after Lil Wayne began recording from scratch after his release from prison. He described his first song since his release as \"a 2010 version of A Milli on steroids\". The album's lead single, \"6 Foot 7 Foot\" featuring Cory Gunz, was released on December 15, 2010, and made available for digital download on iTunes on December 16, 2010. The song is produced by Bangladesh, who also produced \"A Milli\".\n\nOn March 8, 2011, Carter released another song, \"We Back Soon\", produced by StreetRunner, though it was not included on the official track listing of Tha Carter IV. The second single, \"John\", was released on March 24, 2011, which features Rick Ross and is produced by Polow Da Don. The album's artwork was unveiled on April 20, 2011. The album was originally scheduled to be released on May 16, 2011, but Mack Maine had confirmed its delay until June 21. On May 26, 2011, the third single, \"How to Love\", was released. A song called \"Dear Anne (Stan Part 2)\" was released in June. Carter said the song was a throwaway track from Tha Carter III and was originally supposed to be on Tha Carter IV, but decided not to put it on there because of its age. Carter said that he liked the beat, but not the lyrics, and was thinking about revamping the song.\n\nIn July 2011, Carter confirmed in an interview with MTV that Tha Carter IV was finished, and was released on August 29, 2011. For preparation for Tha Carter IV, Carter released a mixtape, Sorry 4 the Wait, with all the beats coming from other artist's songs, similar to his mixtape No Ceilings. Tha Carter IV debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 964,000 copies, making it Carter's third chart-topping album of his career. On January 8, 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan was elected the seventh artist (second male artist) all-time best-selling tracks digital with 36,788,000 million to the end of 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, it was reported that Carter was working on sequels to both I Am Not a Human Being and Rebirth. In January 2012, Birdman announced that he and Carter had finished recording Like Father, Like Son 2. On November 22, 2012, he announced that Tha Carter V would be his final album. After numerous delays, I Am Not a Human Being II was released on March 26, 2013, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 selling 217,000 copies in its first week; \"My Homies Still\", \"Love Me\", and \"No Worries\" were released as singles prior to its release. The album was met with generally mixed reviews, with most critics noticing the declining quality of his releases. Carter toured North America with 2 Chainz and T.I. on the second America's Most Wanted Festival. On May 3, 2013, Pepsi dropped Carter, who was a spokesperson for Mountain Dew, due to offensive lyrics about civil rights icon Emmett Till. On September 1, 2013, Carter released the fifth instalment of the \"Dedication\" mixtape series, with Dedication 5. The mixtape featured 29 tracks, with guest appearances from The Weeknd, Chance The Rapper, Jae Millz, Birdman, T.I., Vado, Kidd Kidd, and 2 Chainz among other members of Young Money.\n\n2014–2019: Free Weezy Album and Tha Carter V\n\nOn February 10, 2014, Drake tweeted \"CARTER V\". On October 18, 2013, Cash Money Records Vice President of Promotion Mel Smith, tweeted: \"Happy Friday!! New YMCMB music coming soon!! Carter 5.\" Nearly four months later, in an interview with The Griffin, released on February 14, 2014, Smith spoke on the upcoming album: \"We're very close to dropping the album. It's going to be a huge surprise to everyone, it's an incredible album ... I can't release the date because he wants to surprise people, he wants his true fan base to get excited, but he's worked extremely hard on it and you won't be disappointed.\" On February 15, 2014, during the NBA All-Star Weekend festivities at Sprite's NBA All-Star concert at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Carter appeared as a special guest during Drake's set and performed various hits. Carter and Drake then announced that Tha Carter V would be released on May 5, 2014. However, on March 27, 2014, Carter's manager Cortez Bryant announced that the album had been delayed. Carter then serviced Tha Carter V's first single \"Believe Me\", which features vocals from Drake, to mainstream urban radio in the United States on May 6, 2014. Three more singles, \"Krazy\", \"Grindin'\" (featuring Drake) and \"Start a Fire\" (featuring Christina Milian), were also released for the album.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, just five days before the album was due to be released again, Carter issued a statement saying the album would not be released on its expected release date, due to his displeasure with Cash Money Records label-boss Birdman, refusing to release the album although it had been completed. Carter also expressed his feelings by stating he felt both he and his creativity were being held \"prisoner\".\n\nOn January 20, 2015, Carter self-released Sorry 4 the Wait 2, a sequel to his 2011 mixtape, to compensate for the continued delay of Tha Carter V. Upon Sorry for the Wait 2's release, it was said Wayne disses Birdman and Cash Money Records, several times throughout the mixtape. Birdman was reported to be upset with this.

On March 4, 2016, 2 Chainz released his third studio album, ColleGrove. The album was initially a collaborative effort between 2 Chainz and Carter, but due to his record label issues, only 2 Chainz was credited as the primary artist. In 2017, Carter announced that he signed with Roc Nation. Later, Carter revealed that there was no official paperwork that he signed to the label.

Carter is a frequent guest on the program. On Christmas 2017, Carter released the mixtape Dedication 6, the sixth instalment of the \"Gangsta Grillz\" chronology. The second part was released on January 26, 2018.\n\nTha Carter V was finally released on September 27, 2018, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 480,000 album-equivalent units, including 140,000 pure album sales. It is the second-largest streaming week for an album behind Drake's Scorpion with 433 million streams. It is also Carter's fourth US number-one album. Every song on the album charted on the Billboard 100, while simultaneously charting 4 songs in the top 10, also becoming the first artist to debut two songs in the top 5.\n\n2020–present: Funeral and Tha Carter VI\n\nWhile Carter was working on Tha Carter V, it was announced that his next album would be titled Funeral. On January 23, 2020, he revealed the album's release date and album artwork. Funeral was released on January 31, and debuted at number-one on the US Billboard 200, with 139,000 album-equivalent units, becoming his fifth US number-one album. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. On February 2, 2020, Lil Wayne competed in Season 3 of The Masked Singer after the Super Bowl LIV as \"Robot\".

For the song by The Weeknd, see Can't Feel My Face.\n\nCarter has announced several possible upcoming projects, including a collaborative album entitled I Can't Feel My Face with Harlem-based rapper Juelz Santana, that has been in production for several years. In late 2011, it was announced by Mack Maine that Carter and Juelz Santana had gone back to work on their collaborative album I Can't Feel My Face, which had been delayed for a few years due to \"label politics\".\n\nOn June 19, 2008, Carter and T-Pain formed a duo called T-Wayne with plans to release an album, titled He Raps, He Sings; however, those plans have died down due to much of the material recorded for the album being leaked. T-Pain ultimately released T-Wayne in 2017.\n\nAccording to an interview with Drake, in the December 2011 issue of XXL, plans for an upcoming album with Carter had been scrapped for the time being because of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration album Watch the Throne (2011).\n\nIn April 2012, on the premiere of MTV's Hip Hop POV, Carter sat down with Amanda Seales and spoke briefly about an album he put together titled Devol (loved, backwards), an album full of \"love songs\" that he wrote during his imprisonment at Rikers Island. In May 2013 he confirmed the album will still be released.\n\nCarter's once ongoing litigation with Cash Money prevented numerous completed projects from being released. In January 2017, Young Money revealed the title of a planned Carter album called Velvet. The album ended up leaking online in November 2018.\n\nRetirement plans\n\nOn March 29, 2011, in an interview with Hot 97's Angie Martinez, Carter announced that he would retire at age 35; saying \"I have four kids\", and that \"I would feel selfish still going to the studio when it's such a vital point in their lives.\" He said in November 2012 that Tha Carter V will be his last album as he wanted to go into other interests.\n\nIn March 2014, Carter reconfirmed at SXSW that Tha Carter V will be his last album during his keynote with interviewer Elliot Wilson.\n\nIn September 2016, in regard to his contract dispute with Cash Money, he indicated a possible retirement on Twitter saying \"I AM NOW DEFENSELESS and mentally DEFEATED\" and then said, \"I leave gracefully and thankful I luh my fanz but I'm done.\" Many rappers responded with respect and encouragement.\n\nArtistry\n\nLil Wayne has cited rapper Missy Elliott as his biggest musical inspiration, saying \"she's a huge influence of everything I've ever done\". Another one of his major influences is American hip hop group Goodie Mob. In an interview with Genius, Lil Wayne said \"I've been listening to Goodie Mob since I was in the 7th grade\". For his MTV Unplugged special, Lil Wayne paid tribute to Tupac by covering his music. He also pulled inspiration from Tupac's \"Keep Ya Head Up\" for his 2011 single \"How to Love\".\n\nAdditionally, he has mentioned T-Pain, Prince, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lenny Kravitz as influences, stating \"I viewed them seriously and was like, 'Wow, I could do that without being totally them.\" Lil Wayne and rapper Calboy paid homage to Hill on their 2021 single \"Miseducation\" titled after Hill's 1998 album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\n\nAccording to American Songwriter, Lil Wayne credits Jay-Z for inspiring him to freestyle rhymes while recording over an instrumental, as opposed to writing down his lyrics.\n\nLegacy\n\nLil Wayne is claimed to be \"one of the most influential artists in the 21st century\" and is many times called as \"the greatest rapper of his generation\", as well as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His musical style and usage of autotune influenced modern sound of hip-hop music and its subgenres, especially development of trap.\n\nMany of later upcoming rappers and musicians cited him as an influence on their careers and musical style, among them are Nicki Minaj, Drake, Fall Out Boy, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Future, Lil B, Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, Trippie Redd, Lil Skies, Playboi Carti, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Lil Baby, DaBaby, Polo G, BlocBoy JB, NLE Choppa, and The Kid Laroi; with some of them he has also collaborated. His lyrics have also been criticized for their controversial subject matter.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships and children\n\nCarter has four children. His first child, daughter Reginae, was born November 29, 1998, when he was 16, to his high school sweetheart Toya Johnson. They later married on Valentine's Day 2004 and divorced in 2006. Internet rumors circulatied in August 2008 that Carter's daughter had died in an auto accident; he immediately dispelled them.\n\nHis second child, Dwayne III, was born on October 22, 2008, at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati to radio broadcaster Sarah Vivan. His third child, Cameron, was born to actress Lauren London on September 9, 2009. His fourth child, Neal, was born on November 30, 2009, to singer Nivea. Trina also became pregnant with Carter's child, but later suffered a miscarriage.\n\nIn July 2014, it was rumored that Carter was dating singer Christina Milian, with whom he attended the ESPY Awards. They later confirmed their relationship in mid-2015, after which they received criticism from their interconnected exes, singer Nivea and songwriter The-Dream. They split at the end of 2015, having collaborated on multiple singles, videos, and concert dates.\n\nWayne was engaged to model La'Tecia Thomas but called off the engagement in May 2020.\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Wayne had started dating Denise Bidot, another model. In November 2020, they reportedly broke up over Wayne's endorsement of Donald Trump. Shortly after, it was reported that the couple had reconciled.\n\nBeliefs and interests\n\nIn an interview with Blender, Carter revealed one of his favorite bands from childhood to be rock group Nirvana, and cites them as a major influence in his music.\n\nAfter earning his GED, Carter enrolled at the University of Houston in January 2005. He dropped out in the same year due to his conflicting schedule. He also revealed on The View that he switched to the University of Phoenix and majored in psychology taking online courses. An article in Urb magazine in March 2007 asserted that Carter had been earning high grades at Houston.\n\nOn September 24, 2008, Carter published his first blog for ESPN in their issue, ESPN The Magazine. Carter revealed he was a fan of tennis, the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Bruins, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHealth problems\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Carter's private jet, bound for Los Angeles, made an emergency landing in Texas due to an in-flight medical episode. Lil Wayne was transferred to a local hospital upon arrival. TMZ and other media sources said that Carter had suffered a seizure aboard the plane. His publicist denied this, saying that he was in fact treated for \"a severe migraine and dehydration\".\n\nThe following day, while flying from Texas to Los Angeles, Carter's private jet was reportedly again forced to make an emergency landing, this time in Louisiana, after he suffered a second seizure and required further hospitalization. His representative said that the reports of Carter's condition had been exaggerated, and that he was resting at his Louisiana home. In a November 2012 interview with MTV, Carter revealed that he was taking seizure medication, on doctors' orders, due to the aforementioned incidents.\n\nOn March 14, 2013, TMZ reported that Carter had been treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of March 12, after having seizures while on a music video set with Young Money rapper Nicki Minaj. He was reportedly released in the early hours of March 13. On March 15, TMZ published a second story, claiming that hours after his release on March 13, Carter was found unconscious after experiencing further seizures, and was brought back to Cedars-Sinai, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit in critical condition. The article alleged the latest seizures were found to be linked to high amounts of codeine in Carter's system, possibly due to bingeing on purple drank after his initial hospital release. Multiple celebrities, including Drake and Birdman, were photographed on March 15 and 16 visiting Carter at Cedars-Sinai.\n\nSeveral members of Young Money Entertainment, including president Mack Maine, criticized media reports on Carter's hospitalization, particularly those of TMZ, alleging that they exaggerated the severity of his condition and falsely implied that he was on his deathbed (such as by saying that he was in a medically induced coma), triggering what the Washington Post called \"the most overheated celebrity deathwatch in recent years\". In separate interviews on March 18, Mack Maine and Birdman disputed TMZ's reports, and stated that in fact there were not multiple seizures or multiple hospital visits. They explained that after Carter began seizing on the way to the music video shoot on March 12, an ambulance was called and he was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and remained continuously thereafter.\n\nCarter was released from the hospital late on March 18, following a six-day stay. Lil Wayne addressed his condition via a vlog, on March 21 saying he was more than good.\n\nCarter had two seizures in June 2016, during a cross-country flight from Wisconsin to California, and landed in Omaha, Nebraska. His plane was only two minutes in the air when the second seizure occurred, forcing the plane to land in Omaha once again. Less than a month later, he had another seizure, supposedly due to not taking his epilepsy medication.\n\nCarter canceled a Las Vegas show on September 3, 2017, having had a seizure in a Chicago hospital earlier that day, where he was brought after being found unconscious in a hotel room.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nOn February 19, 2008, Carter and Cortez Bryant revisited their alma mater McMain Secondary School to get students to design an invitation to the gala introducing Carter's nonprofit One Family Foundation.\n\nOther ventures\n\nYoung Money Entertainment\n\nMain article: Young Money Entertainment\n\nBooks\n\nCarter wrote a memoir of his experience in Rikers Island called Gone Til' November: A Journal of Rikers Island that was released October 11, 2016.\n\nSports media\n\nOn September 24, 2008, Carter published his first blog for ESPN in their issue, ESPN The Magazine. Carter revealed he was a fan of tennis, the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Bruins, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Red Sox. To commemorate the Packers' making it to Super Bowl XLV, he spoofed Wiz Khalifa's hit song \"Black and Yellow\" (which were the colors of the Packers' opponents, the Pittsburgh Steelers) in a song titled \"Green and Yellow\". He released a second version of the song in 2021, which was requested by the Packers, and updated with the current roster. Carter has continued writing for ESPN, notably reporting at the ESPN Super Bowl party.\n\nOn January 6, 2009, Carter was a guest debater against Skip Bayless on the \"1st & 10\" segment of ESPN First Take. On February 10, 2009, he appeared on ESPN's Around the Horn and beat out veterans Woody Paige, Jay Mariotti and fellow New Orleanian Michael Smith to win that show's episode.\n\nCarter made his debut on ESPN's daily sports round table show Around The Horn on February 10, 2009. Carter created the intro song \"No Mercy\" for the Fox Sports 1 sports debate show Undisputed. After Shannon Sharpe's departure from the show, Carter created a no theme song for Undisputed titled \"Good Morning\". Carter also joined the series as a regular guest opposite Bayless.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain articles: Lil Wayne albums discography, Lil Wayne singles discography, and Lil Wayne videography\n\nSee also: Hot Boys discography and Young Money discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nTha Block Is Hot (1999)\n\nLights Out (2000)\n\n500 Degreez (2002)\n\nTha Carter (2004)\n\nTha Carter II (2005)\n\nTha Carter III (2008)\n\nRebirth (2010)\n\nI Am Not a Human Being (2010)\n\nTha Carter IV (2011)\n\nI Am Not a Human Being II (2013)\n\nFree Weezy Album (2015)\n\nTha Carter V (2018)\n\nFuneral (2020)\n\nTha Carter VI (TBA)\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nLike Father, Like Son with Birdman (2006)\n\nWelcome 2 Collegrove with 2 Chainz (2023)\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Film Role Notes 2000 Baller Blockin' Iceberg Shorty 2007 Who's Your Caddy?
