        "text": "It's that time of the year again!\n\nTomorrow night will be the finals of the 42nd Winternationals at East Bay Raceway Park in Gibsonton, a mere ten miles from the old fairgrounds in downtown Tampa, going east on Selmon Expressway and then south on US-41. East Bay sort-of took over when the fairgrounds moved away from Plant Field in 1976, to carry on a tradition of almost a century of dirt track racing in Tampa, which is a bit of a story in itself - it wasn't that straightforward, suffice it to say! Maybe there'll be time to address that, too, later on, but first let's take a look at the history of racing at the Tampa Bay Race Track/South Florida Fairgrounds/Florida State Fairgrounds/Plant Field/Plant Park, all those names refering to the same old, tough half-mile dirt track on the West Riverfront, which traditionally opened the dirt track racing season in the East. Today, East Bay's Winternationals take place during the better part of four weeks, a big meeting catering for all sorts of cars from Sprints to Late Model Stockers, but the beginnings were much more humble. Through the archives of not one, but two Tampa newspapers I was able to clear most questions regarding these events, and all along I found fascinating titbits of information about sundry events and institutions, learned about subtle changes in the IMCA point scoring system, and found out about two legendary dirt track super stars making the shortest of comebacks years after official retirement, in both cases lasting just the length of time trials at Plant Field. But first, let's start with busting one super myth about Plant Field, and find out when it really opened for auto racing!\n\nThe old story that has been trotted out hundreds of times, maybe thousands, is that the first auto race at Plant Field took place on February 3 in 1921, promoted by Alex Sloan and sanctioned by the IMCA. It actually wasn't that difficult to find out that the story was baloney, so I wondered where it came from, and began looking through back issues of the Tampa newspapers to find its origin. The earliest reference to the 1921 origin of the race that I could find was from January 1951, when The Tampa Tribune ran an article about the \"30th Anniversary Auto Race\". In it, it said that \"P. T. (Pa) Streider, veteran fair manager, recalled the colorful chapter in automobile racing written by the Florida Fair in the 30 years since J. Alex Sloan presented the first speed event here in 1921\" - Bingo!\n\nPaul T. Strieder (also often spelt Streider), born 1876 Jan 22 in Fort Wayne/IN, and died 1960 Dec 14, was the general manager of the Tampa Fair for 35 years, and already 75 years old when he made that statement. In his obituary it said that he began his \"career\" in 1893 at the age of 17 with Chicago's Columbian Exposition, so it was a lifelong \"carnie\" with about six decades of experience in embellishment and bullshitting who gave the world a piece of his \"memories\", and EVERYBODY copied off him!! In fact, Al Sweeney and Gaylord White, the 1951 promoters of the Florida State Fair races, had little alternative but to believe what Strieder said - though by 1951, the IMCA had long begun to aspire to being a respectful sanctioning body (which was the main point about honouring the \"anniversary\" in the first place), that same organization had paid scant attention to things such as record keeping, or history at large, for the first twenty or thirty years of its existence - there simply wasn't anyone within this most ahistorical group who would have had any way of finding out details like these by themselves!\n\nThe amazing thing is, actually, that not everything about that 1921 race was baloney. True, it wasn't the first auto race at the Tampa fairgrounds, it wasn't sanctioned by the IMCA, and it wasn't promoted by Alex Sloan - all that, as well as the accompanying story about how the Plant Field track record evolved over the years, were nothing but wild fantasies. But the actual date of the \"race\", and the name of the \"racing drivers\" competing that day were all true. Why the quotation marks? Well, it wasn't really a \"race\" more than a speed exhibition, and the drivers weren't really \"race drivers\": Charlie Rowe, the \"winner\", was actually a professional golfer! And I. J. Watkins, the \"first track record holder\"? Why, he was a professional animal trainer, and presented his acts at circuses and fairs all over the US for four decades!! It was actually Watkins who promoted the 1921 races at the Tampa Fair, just another carnie idea from just another professional carnie, a far cry even from the orchestrated IMCA shows of professional drivers, this was more akin to a Thursday afternoon circus number. Even the cars were nondescript, \"miniature racing automobiles brought to Tampa by I. J. Watkins\", which \"promise to be a big amusement feature of the fair\". Hardly the start of a long racing tradition - and it wasn't the beginning, anyway.\n\nPaul Strieder and I. J. Watkins (in 1948)\n\nEDIT Ahhh, don't you just love this new software... When you want a big pic, it makes it small, and when you want a small one, it makes it big!\n\nEdited by Michael Ferner, 16 February 2018 - 19:51.\n\nHow Strieder, who by all accounts came to Florida in 1918, took on his first job at the Tampa Fair the following year and was appointed as general manger the very next, managed to \"overlook\" the truly professional races held during two days of the 1920 Fair, is quite beyond me. Maybe his new job demanded all his mental capacities, but then again, one would think that the auto races, listed on the official program of the Fair, WERE part of his job description that year? Even then, he should have been aware of the auto races that took place just one week after the exhibiton, following on the big success of the fair races, or indeed of the AAA races one month later, the first ever of the premier US racing club on Florida's west coast, when even a racing car from the starting field of the 1914 Indy 500 was entered, though apparently it did not appear. Most likely, Strieder was aware of these events at the time they were happening, but thirty years later his memory became confused - proof, if ever it was needed, that oral history can be very misleading, especially once it enters the realm of the written record without proper fact checking!\n\nSo, having established that there were at least four race meetings in 1920, are we now closer to the real auto racing inaugural at Tampa's Plant Field? Well, only if we accept a \"smart aleck\" answer! Technically, the 1920 races look to have been the first auto races at Plant Field, but the same track already saw auto racing before it was named \"Plant Field\" Incidentally, though the track was known both by \"Plant Field\" and \"Plant Park\", technically it was across the street from the former City Park, renamed on September 9 of 1913 in honour of Henry Bradley Plant, on a property formerly known as Armstrong Park, purchased in April of 1913 by H. B. Plant's son, Morton S. Plant, and renamed \"Plant Field\". It was then, as it is now again, mainly a baseball field with a little grandstand, though the dirt track already existed well before, at least fifteen years, and lo and behold, an auto race meeting was held there as early as April 29 in 1909! Of the seven events advertized that day (including one for motor cycles), only three were run off due to a short entry (eight cars in toto), and the main event shortened from 20 miles to ten, won by a 30hp Cadillac at the impressive speed (if true) of 39 mph.\n\nInterestingly, the report of the events in the next day's Tampa Tribune opened with the words: \"What proved to be the most successful automobile racing card ever pulled off in Tampa was that yesterday afternoon at the Tampa Bay track...\" Well, those words ARE true (if somewhat meaningless) even if it was the first ever race, and in any case I haven't found evidence of earlier races at the fairgrounds, or anywhere else in Tampa for that matter. So, for the moment at least, 1909 April 29 should replace 1921 February 3 as the opening event in Plant Field's motor sport history.\n\nEdited by Michael Ferner, 16 February 2018 - 21:15.\n\nI'm sure Fines won't mind me answering for him , but you're probably right, Ray. The name Winternationals (or Winter Nationals) was first used for the Tampa sprints in February of 1967. Perhaps they took a leaf from the NHRA book.. .\n\nHere now an annotated list of all (Big) car racing events I found for Tampa's Fairgrounds track \"Plant Field\":\n\n1909-04-29 (Thu): 10m (20 laps), 15'08.0\", 1 W. F. Ferman (Cadillac), 2 Thonet (Buick), 3 Nelson (Buick), Time Trials ??, Heat winners: 10m (20 laps), 17'26.0\", Thonet (Buick) , 10m (20 laps), 18'42.0\", Roy Hinson (White steamer), three other heats and one motorcycle event cancelled\n\n​Organized by the Tampa AC, this was baiscally an unsanctioned meet for local cars and drivers, none of which appear elsewhere in my records. It is not clear whether prize money was on offer, but admission was charged for the events. In the run-up to the races, the AC announced plans to build a five-mile permanent auto racing track in Tampa, in order to take away \"the racing laurels from Savannah and the east coast of the state\", i.e. Daytona/Ormond Beach, which was never mentioned in name - some form of inferiority complex? Like so many of those plans, nothing ever came of it.\n\n​1920-02-19 (Thu)/rs 02-20 (Fri): 10m (20 laps), 15'31.0\", 1 Harold Roller (Roller/Roof?), 2 C. A. Chapman (Chapman/Buick), 3 Dave Koetzla (Norman/Buick), Time Trials (2 laps): 1'15.5\", Roller, H1 (10 laps): 7'11.25\", Roller, H2 (10 laps): 7'23.5\", Roller, H3 cancelled\n\n​1920-02-21 (Sat): 10m (20), 15'47.0\", 1 Harold Roller (Roller/Roof?), 2 Hendricks (Chapman/Buick), 3 Dave Koetzla (Norman/Buick), TT (2): 1'15.25\", Roller, H1 (10): 7'17.5\", Roller, H2 (10) 7'07.0\", Roller, H3 cancelled\n\n​These were fully professional races, part of the South Florida Fair program, with $750 advertized for each day. The first day's races were rescheduled not because of rain on the day, but because the horse races rained out on Wednesday were held that day, showing that the bangtails were still boss. Harold Stanley Roller (b. 1893-03-27d. 1964-10-05) from Kansas was the promoter, and a highly successful independent racing driver in many Midwestern states. His car was described as a \"revamped Ford\", and from other events it appears to have been a very early 16-valve conversion by Roof, or possibly a Rajo. He would eventually move to Tampa in 1926, open a garage and run his racing car out of it, also for other drivers after retiring from active competition in 1929. Since he won every event here in 1920, one is tempted to think of the races as \"hippodromes\", but that is actually not very likely, the competition being all local. The only name driver in the field, apart from Roller, was Dave Koetzla from Michigan or Illinois, a successful IMCA driver who had just moved to Florida, and was driving a local car here. It is, in fact, not very clear whether the other Buick special was driven by Chapman or Hendricks, and it was likely the latter who took second on the first day, too.\n\n​1920-02-28 (Sat): 5m (10), n/a, 1 Harold Roller (Roller/Roof?), 2 Dave Koetzla (Norman/Buick), no other starters, TT ??, H1 (10): n/a, Koetzla, H2 (10): n/a, Roller, H3 (6): n/a, Johnny Marsicano (Marsicano/Ford?)\n\n​Following the success at the Fair, a match race \"two out of three\" between Roller and Koetzla was carded for the following Saturday, with an advertized purse of $1,500 and a short race for locals on the side.\n\n​1920-04-03 (Sat): 5m (10), 7'45.0\", 1 Jay Davidson (Davidson/Stutz), 2 Harold Alexander (Alexander/Duesenberg), no other finishers, TT: 38.0\" Alexander, H1 (6): 4'13.0\", Alexander, H2 (4): 2'43.2\", Alexander, H3 (2): 1'29.8\", Davidson, H4 (6): 4'14.0\", Alexander\n\n​Finally, the AAA came to town, with a race promoted by Harold F. Alexander of New Jersey, who was touring the South with a group of fellow Northeastern racers, and sometimes did business under the name of New York Auto Racing Association. After stops at Goldsboro/NC on January 1, Gainesville/FL (Jan 22), Daytona Beach (Feb 7), Ocala (Feb 28) and Saint Petersburg (Mar 13/pp 18), Tampa was their final destination before heading back north to tracks such as Olympic Park/NJ, Bluefield/WV, Middletown/NY, Richmond/VA, Elsmere/DE, Benning/DC, Allentown/PA or Danbury/CT. Star exhibit of the Alexander troupe was the Beaver Bullet, a car built for the 1914 Indy 500 by Charles F. Keene of Beaver Falls/PA. Keene had disposed of the car in 1915 to fellow Beaver Falls resident George B. Gardner, who in turn sold to Irving C. Barber of Washington/DC in 1916, then to Charles E. Dagnett of Washington/DC in 1917 and finally to veteran driver Don Moore of Washington/DC in 1918. Of all the drivers entered at Plant Field in 1920, Moore had been active the longest (at least six years), yet he was still racing in 1949!! However, he appears to have damaged the car during the races at Daytona Beach, and apparently never made it to Western Florida. Alexander won all the races except for the main event, which was declared a dead heat between the Duesenberg and the Stutz. An extra race over two laps was added as a \"tie breaker\", and promptly won by Jay Davidson!\n\n​1921-02-03 (Thu): 3m (6), 4'40\", 1 Charlie Rowe (\"Red Devil\" #16), 2 I. J. Watkins (white #8), 3 Earl Mallott (#7)\n\n​As mentioned, basically a circus act on the opening day of the Fair, to be repeated on all eight remaining days but no further info availbale, and probably called off. Repeated references to \"diminutive cars\" or \"baby racers\" suggest a competition for Midgets/Cycle cars/Voiturettes.\n\n​1922-01-02 (Mon): 3m (6), 4'32.5\", 1 Speedy Bower (?/Ford), 2 Al Fisher (?/Ford), no other finishers, H (?) n/a, Fisher\n\n​A poorly supported race for Ford specials in conjunction with several motor cycle races, plus a match race between a Ford and a Dodge. Local promoters Jeff Legler and Johnny Marsicano teamed with Ray Creviston of Indiana to attract 1,000 spectators, all three of them mainly connected with the bike racing, though Creviston would go back to Indiana and race cars for the next three or four years.\n\n​1923-04-05 (Thu)/06 (Fri): 15m (30), 19'21.4\", 1 Carl Dixon (Dixon/Dodge), 2 Russell White (Daniels/Hudson), 3 Percy Gonzalez (?/Hudson), TT 1'07.0\", Dixon, H1 (10), 6'17.0\", Bob Robinson (Robinson/Dodge), H2 (10), 6'05.0\", Dixon, H3 (6), n/a, Dixon\n\n​1st Tampa Police Benefit Race, promoted by Ralph Hankinson, and sanctioned by the National Motor Contest Board. The NMCB was a break-away group of the IMCA, and this may have been the very first meeting sanctioned by this club. Heats were run on the Thursday, additional heats on Friday were apparently cancelled.\n\n​1924-02-09 (Sat): 2½m (5), 3'09.8\", 1 Sig Haugdahl (Haugdahl/Fiat), 2 Putty Hoffman (Horey/Fiat), 3 Larry Stone (Disbrow/Simplex) or Cleo Sarles (Sarles/Frontenac), H1 (5), 3'17.6\", Sarles, H2 (5), 3'02.2\", Haugdahl, AP (7), 4'22.0\", Haugdahl, Exh (2) 1'06.0\", Haugdahl (Haugdahl/Wisconsin)\n\nClosing day of South Florida Fair, first race for both the IMCA and promoter Alex Sloan.\n\n1924-03-20 (Thu)/pp 03-21 (Fri)/03-24 (Mon): 15m (30), n/a, 1 Walt Smith (Smith/Chevrolet), 2 Grady Garner (Garner/Dodge), 3 John Kelly (Daniels/Hudson), TT (2) 1'10.0\", Bob Robinson (Robinson/Dodge), H1 (6), 3'47.0\", Robinson, H2 (6), 4'09.4\", Sam Purvis (?/Nash), H3 (6), 3'42.4\", Robinson, TT (2), 1'09.8\", Smith\n\n2nd Tampa Police Benefit Race, again NMCB-sanctioned and promoted by Hankinson. Originally scheduled for March 20/21, but rain on the first day forced the heats to be run off on Friday, and the main event to be postponed to Monday due to ball games on the Saturday and \"blue laws\". A second set of time trials were run off on Monday to try for a new track record.\n\n1925-02-03 (Tue), 3½m (7), 4'29.4\", 1 Bud Putman (Disbrow/Simplex), 2 Bob Green (Green/Frontenac), 3 Larry Stone (?/Fiat), H1 (5), 3'21.2\", Sig Haugdahl (Sloan/Miller), H2 (5), 3'43.8\", Putman, H3 (4), 2'14.6\", Haugdahl, H4 (?), n/a, Haugdahl\n\n1925-02-14 (Sat), 2½m (5), 3'06.8\", 1 Bob Green (Green/Frontenac), 2 Sig Haugdahl (Sloan/Miller), 3 Dave Koetzla (Koetzla/Peugeot), H1 (7), 4'33.6\", Bud Putman (Disbrow/Simplex), H2 (7), n/a, Haugdahl, SH (5), 3'45.8\", Koetzla\n\nThe first year of the regular IMCA Opening Day/Closing Day schedule at the South Florida Fair. Haugdahl brought his new Miller (actually, a 1922 engine in a '23 chassis), but the main wins went to the positively ancient Simplex special and a humble Fronty-Ford! Ouch... \"SH\", by the way, stands for Straw-Hat Derby, a race were drivers were obliged to wear a straw hat and finish the race without it being blown off... \"AP\" is for Australian Pursuit, \"WC\" for Wheel Changing race.\n\n1926-02-02 (Tue), 2½m (5), 3'05.0\", 1 Ray Lampkin (Elliott?/Miller), 2 Bob Green (Green/Frontenac), 3 Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), TT 33.2\"/TR, Lampkin, H1 (5), 3'28.4\", Lampkin, Ex (1), 36.8\", Joan La Costa (NDS/Frontenac), H2 (4), 2'32.4\", Green, H3 (3), 2'00.2\", Arch Powell (Yale/Duesenberg?)\n\n1926-02-13 (Sat), cancelled/rain (?)\n\n1926-05-08 (Sat), n/a, n/a, 1 Tubby Burton (Ferman/Dodge), 2 John Kelly (Kelly/Frontenac), 3 n/a, TT 32\"/TR, Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), H1 (?), n/a, Gingrich, H2 (?), n/a, n/a\n\n1926-06-05 (Sat), 10m (20), 11'30.0\", 1 Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), 2 John Kelly (Kelly/Frontenac), 3 Ernest Gutierrez (?/Frontenac), H1 (6), 3'20.4\", Gingrich, H2 (6), 3'35.4\", John Perry (Scootis/Chevrolet), H3 (10), 6'10.0\", Gingrich\n\n1926-08-26 (Thu), 25m (50), 28'20\"?, 1 Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), 2 Tim Raspbury (Raspbury/Chevrolet), 3 John Kelly (Kelly/Frontenac), TT 33.2\", Gingrich, H1 (10?), n/a, Gingrich, H2 (10?), n/a, Tubby Burton (Ferman/Dodge), H3 (20?), cancelled?\n\n1926-12-04 (Sat), 10m (20), 13'30.0\", 1 Howard Miller (Miller/Frontenac), no other finishers, TT 34.8\", Jim Angel (n/a), H1 (10), 6'36.0\", Barney Sullivan (Ferman/Dodge), H2 (10), 6'16.6\", Miller, H3 (20?), cancelled?\n\nThe Fair races were IMCA-sanctioned, as usual, and Lampkin did better with the other IMCA Miller straight 8 (though I can't be sure - a picture would've been nice! ). Also, I couldn't find results for the Closing Day races, but at the same time I couldn't find any notice that the races had been called off - frustrating! The other four meetings are interesting, as they were an attempt to establish a local racing club: the May and June races were sanctioned by the Florida State Auto Racing Association, which apparently went under in no time at all, because basically the same cars and drivers then appeared under the banner of the American-Latin Auto Racing Association for the August and December dates. Both clubs apparently also raced at Daytona/Ormond Beach, but apart from previews I have no info.\n\n1927-02-01 (Tue), 3½m (7), 4'10.0\", 1 John de Palma (Duesenberg), 2 Fred Horey (Sloan/Hall-Scott), 3 Ray Claypool (Peugeot), H1 (5), 3'02.0\", Claypool, H2 (6), 3'32.0\", Harold Roller (Roller/Frontenac), H3 (5), 3'02.4\", Horey, H4 (6), 3'30.8\", Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), H5 (6?), n/a, Gingrich\n\n1927-02-12 (Sat), 2½m (5), 2'54.8\", 1 Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), 2 Hayden Smith (?/Chevrolet), 3 Howard Miller (Miller/Frontenac), H1 (?), n/a, Ray Claypool (Peugeot), H2 (5), 4'41.4\", Smith, H3 (?), n/a, Claypool, H4 (6), n/a, Gingrich, H5 (?), n/a, Miller\n\nThis was the year when there were two sets of races, one \"All-Star\" event for the imported IMCA professionals, and one \"State Championship\" race for locals, with no interaction. There were, however, only four cars in the \"All-Star\" category, and during the Closing Day races all but one broke down in the heats, so that the final was cancelled and substituted with a match race for locals. The reporting was also very poor in both papers.\n\n1928-01-31 (Tue), 2½m (5), 2'55.0\", 1 Bob Green (Young/Frontenac), 2 Sam Hoffman (Scootis/Chevrolet), 3 Ed Hughes (?/Dodge), H1 (5), 3'02.2\", Fred Horey (Elliott/Miller), H2 (5), 3'04.6\", Hoffman, H3 (5), 3'04.0\", Horey, H4 (5), 3'05.0\", Green, H5 (3), 1'50.4\", Curley Young (Young/Frontenac)\n\n1928-02-11 (Sat), 2½m (5), 2'51.6\", 1 Sam Hoffman (Morosco/Frontenac), 2 Fred Horey (Elliott/Miller), 3 Swan Peterson (Peterson/Frontenac), H1 (5), 3'01.0\", Horey, H2 (5), 2'54.0\", Sam Purvis (Scootis/Chevrolet), H3 (5), 3'00.0\", Bob Green (Young/Frontenac), H4 (5), 3'02.2\", Horey\n\n1928-05-30 (Wed), 5m (10), 5'47\". 1 Sam Purvis (Scootis/Chevrolet), 2 Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), 3 n/a, TT 33.0\", Purvis, H1 (5), 2'50\", Gingrich, H2 (5), 3'05\", Hayden Smith (?/Oldsmobile), H3 (5), 3'18\", Joe Duff (?/Frontenac)\n\nThe Memorial Day races were again locally sanctioned, the name apparently Florida Racing Association - this group also raced at Pompano Beach on the East coast.\n\n1929-01-29 (Tue), 2½m (5), 2'46.0\", 1 Sig Haugdahl (Elliott/Miller), 2 Swan Peterson (Powell/Roof), 3 Sam Purvis (Scootis/Chevrolet), H1 (5), 2'51.6\", Peterson (Peterson/Frontenac), H2 (5), 2'53.2\", Purvis, H3 (5), 2'58.4\", Haugdahl, H4 (5), 3'01.4\", Bob Green (Sheppard/Frontenac), H5 (7), 3'58.0\", Purvis\n\n1929-02-09 (Sat), 2½m (5), 2'57.2\", 1 Swan Peterson (Peterson/Frontenac), 2 Arch Powell (Powell/Roof), 3 Ray Price (n/a), H1 (5), 2'52.6\", Peterson, H2 (5), 2'58.6\", Sam Purvis (Scootis/Chevrolet), H3 (5), 3'01.0\", Shorty Gingrich (Gingrich/Frontenac), H4 (5), 2'51.8\", Gingrich, H5 (5), 2'55.2\", Powell, H6 (6), 3'27.0\", Gingrich, H7 (5), 2'57.6\", Bob Green (Sheppard/Frontenac)\n\nEdited by Michael Ferner, 19 February 2018 - 21:24."
