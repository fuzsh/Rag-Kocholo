        "text": "by Camisha Miller\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH SARAH HADDY\n\nHow did Tim and you meet? We actually met on a blind date. My girlfriend and a guy friend of his were dating at the time and decided to play matchmaker and set Tim and I up.\n\nDo you think any of your children will race? Well TJ raced go karts already and Becca wants to so probably someday.\n\nFavorite racetrack? Watching Tim race I would have to say Dodge County or Three Lakes (we haven’t raced there in year’s ☹).\n\nFavorite food at the racetrack? Brats\n\nWhat do you do for a living? To make it easy I process claims and work with other insurance offices to answer claim questions.\n\nFavorite race memory? The first feature Tim won during our relationship (I believe it was at Beaver Dam Raceway) it was shortly after we had Becca. I wasn’t at the track but I packed Jordyn and Becca up into the car to meet him out to celebrate with our sponsors, family and crew.\n\nLeast favorite race memory? Umm, anytime Tim flips.\n\nWhat makes you a diva? I don’t think I’m a diva by definition. I am a very strong willed woman who will stand up for and defend my family and friends with all that I am.\n\nWhat about Tim do people not know but should? He is very sentimental when it comes to racing.\n\nFavorite driver and can’t be Tim?! If I have to name just one I guess for Sprint Cars David Gravel and NASCAR would be Dale Jr.\n\nI have had the privilege of getting to know both Tim & Sarah over the years due to our husbands racing together. There are not many racers that I want to win (other than my husband) but Tim is one of those drivers that I pull for and I know Sarah would tell you the same about my husband. She is strong-willed but has a heart of gold and that is what I adore about Sarah. She may say she is not a diva but deep-down she sure is J\n\nOne-on-One with Jillian Papa\n\nHow did David and you meet?\n\nDavid and I met in high school; mainly through my brother because David used to come over the house and they would work on their Mustangs together. Since then, we have been together 6 years now!\n\nHe just won at the Big E, how did you guys celebrate?!!\n\nSince David won on Thursday night, we still had to keep our game faces on for Friday and the big race on Saturday so we didn't really celebrate too much. His parents came in for the races for their first time at Eldora and his owner and some sponsors were there so we had a good time in the pits afterwards and made a quick stop at Waffle House with everyone!\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI just graduated in May with a Bachelors Degree in Public Health and I'll be continuing on to pursue a Nursing degree at a one - year accelerated BSN program back home in Connecticut! I started getting into an online fitness program through Beachbody called the 21 Day Fix and Shakeology, since I knew I'd be busy traveling and not always have time for the gym or have many opportunities for healthy meals. This program has targeting 30 minute workouts and incorporates a daily meal replacement shake to keep you full longer, boost metabolism to trigger weight loss and fight off any junk-food related cravings. I saw such amazing results within the first month of using the product I decided to sign-up as an Independent Beachbody Coach, where I can help others stay motivated and reach their fitness goals while making an income! The program really helped me stay on track with my nutrition while on the road and gave me the energy I needed for the long road trips after races! Shakeology was definitely my savior to keeping my diet on track on the road and helping me make an income at my leisure since it’s an online business!\n\nThe T-shirt Van is cleaver who came up with that idea?\n\nThe T shirt Van is an awesome setup! It allows David to travel around on his own schedule/have a vehicle on the road! His dad and him came up with the idea and customized the entire inside! His dad owns an auto body shop so he had eyes on the van as it used to deliver parts to their shop and got word that it was going to retire soon from being a parts truck.\n\nWhere is your home base? My home base is Waterbury, Connecticut- about 15 minutes from Dave’s home base of Watertown.\n\nYour favorite track?\n\nThis summer has been my first time out on the road for an extended period of time so I've been to many new tracks! When I was in school I was only really able to get to the PA, NY and big races like Charlotte or Knoxville. I'd have to say Eldora and Knoxville are definitely at the top of my list for favorite tracks!\n\nYour favorite track food? My favorite track food would probably be chicken tenders! A recent find was fried Oreos!\n\nWhat makes you a diva?!! After being on the road for a month and a half I definitely discovered a little more diva in me! I am home now and couldn't wait to get pampered - nails and hair we're overdue for some TLC!\n\nWords you live by? Words I live by are usually \"everything happens for a reason\" and \"let go and let God\"- I tend to stress things I cannot always be in control of so I just like to remind myself to go with the flow and everything will run its course.\n\nWhat does your future hold? My future hopefully holds a successful school year where I will obtain my RN and be able to have a flexible schedule to make it out to the races!\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Jillian and David when the Outlaws raced in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. We sat and talked for quite a while and I was so impressed by how extremely friendly and professional they both were. I adore their t-shirt van and my family cheers loud for David!\n\nJillian welcome to the Dirt Diva club!\n\nOne-On-One with Jordan Armstrong\n\nHow did Kevin and you meet? We had mutual friends and then one day he was driving through Little Rock we went to the driving range and got ice cream on our first date (my idea.)\n\nNow here we are...Getting married lol!\n\nExplain how YOU are doing with all that has happened with Kevin?\n\nI really am as happy if not happier than what I was prior to his accident. Is our life completely different than it was? Yes. Is this easy? Absolutely not, but Kevin makes this easy (most days.) Every single day he amazes me at how well he has handled this. I couldn’t imagine how I would feel or where my head would be at. I will admit after the first surgery when they told us he would never walk again I had a moment where I lost it. Since that moment every amount of news and every day we have proven those doctors differently. The only thing I hate is being away from our home. Louisville might have the best rehab facility I could ever wish for but there isn’t any above average Mexican food around here J\n\nIf there was one thing that you wanted people to know about Kevin, what would it be?\n\nHe is hands down one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet.\n\nYour favorite race track?\n\nMy parent’s house is 2 miles away from I-30 Speedway. Its home and I’ve spent almost every weekend of my life at that place-I love it.\n\nFavorite driver (cannot be Kevin or Sammy ;) & favorite race memory:\n\nThis is going on a sprint car forum correct? I’m a huge late model fan so I have to tell you Scott Bloomquist.\n\nLast year chili bowl; Yes, he has won 4 of them but I’ve never been more proud of him than I was last year. He genuinely showed how good he is there. Kevin raced hard and battled back from every bad thing that could possibly happen to be pretty dang close to winning another one; I literally don’t think I took a breath that whole race.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nPrior to Kevin’s accident I worked in property management. Now I am a full time dog mom, nurse, pharmacist and personal assistant/trainer. I also spend time working on our new t-shirt line. So if you’re reading this go check out www.vintageracetees.com\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nI am incredibly sassy…. I always have an opinion even when I shouldn’t….I blame my father for that trait J\n\nWhat are some goals for 2016?!!\n\nMy main focus for the year is Kevin’s rehabilitation. Day in and out we are going to therapy, extra gym time and then trying to fit in as much work at home as we can. Other than that I hope to fit in my wedding dress.\n\nHow has Zoey Kevin’s daughter doing with everything?\n\nShe's an incredibly strong 6 year-old; she listened intently as we told her. We sent her videos of when Kevin was first able to kick his leg and she than brought her soccer ball with her when we had her the week of Thanksgiving and they kicked it around. She knows her Daddy is no different than he was.\n\nHow has Zoey taken to you?\n\nZoey is my girl and always will be; there's nothing more fun than me and her ganging up on her dad and I have a great relationship with her mother which is great.\n\nAs I got to thinking about Kevin and his family whom I have known for years and have the utmost respect for, it dawned on me that when I first started this venture of Dirt Diva interviews it was to showcase the women that stand behind their men whether it be from a wife, mother, daughter, sponsor, girlfriend, best friend, etc stand-point.. So I thought to myself what about interviewing Jordan because she truly has been a rock for Kevin. She without any hesitation agreed and this has been quite a learning interview/experience for me. I am a lot like you are DIVA with being sassy J and I think that is what makes us strong! Keep up the great work with everything you have going on; we are always thinking and praying for you guys!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH JENN NISSEN\n\nHow did Shane and you meet?\n\nAt the races, of course-Knoxville Nationals. The best time of the year!\n\nHow long have you been involved in racing?\n\nI've actually been going to the races longer than I can remember. My dad was involved with his families racing, so through that, we always went, which actually works out well for Shane and me. A lot of girls wouldn't understand the lifestyle and long distance of a relationship in racing, however for us, it works.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI am an Independent Consultant with Rodan & Fields, a premium skincare company. So if any of y'all need some great products, let me know! www.jennnissen.myrandf.com I also have started Tutu Twist where I sell infant/toddler tutus and tutu dresses. I was making them for our daughter Nixon, and received so many compliments on them and thought, why not just sell them!\n\nFavorite racing moment with Shane?\n\nOh man, that's a tough one as there are so many. Honestly, every win he has gotten has been a great moment, whether I am there or not. Just this year I have been so proud of him and the whole LMR team. It's their first year out running with the World of Outlaws and they are second in points. The dedication and drive that Shane, Scotty, Andrew and Heath have is incredible. That is what it takes to win races and drive with the Outlaws every night. But if I had to pick my one favorite moment, it would be Shane's qualifying day at the Nationals in 2014. The day we found out we were having a baby girl, and that night he won the A; It was just a great day overall for the both of us! :)\n\nWorst racing moment with Shane?\n\nHmm…. Another tough one… Any night that he wrecks or crashes makes for a rough night. But worst moment for me was in 2013 when I flew home from Australia. He was still out there racing, and I remember he had a pretty bad wreck. He wasn't hurt or anything, but me just not being there was hard.\n\nFavorite driver- it cannot be Shane :)\n\nUh oh, he might not like this question, ha-ha. :) Of course he is my favorite driver, but second to him, I was always a\n\nSteve Kinser fan ever since I was a kid; He's The King! I wish he could still race like he used to.\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nWell, I am a girl! :) Shane might argue that I am raising Nixon to be a diva already. What diva doesn't love shopping and fashion! I could shop all day, every day!\n\nI have known Shane for a long time and I have to say he is one of my all time favorites. He has always been so kind to me and for that I am thankful. Jenn and I have connected on Facebook and I enjoy seeing photos of their little girl and wish them the best of luck with that little peanut because she is already a DIVA\n\nOne-on-One with Stacy Ervin\n\nHow long have you been involved in racing?\n\nI was born into a racing family. Grandpa Rocky owned a jalopy that raced in the 1960s at West Liberty Raceway and Columbus Junction Raceway (both in Iowa). My mom got the racing bug and so did I. I went to my first race at two weeks old. When I was 4 years old in 1976, my parents took me to my first Knoxville Nationals. I was hooked on sprint cars from then on.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in English, with emphasis in journalism and public relations. After I graduated, I spent about 10 years as a newspaper reporter and editor. I now work at the University Of Iowa College Of Education.\n\nWhat did you do when you worked at Knoxville Raceway?\n\nKathy Bell helped me get my start back when I was working for newspapers in the mid-1990s and I started doing some freelance columns for Hawkeye Racing News from Iowa and for various drivers' newsletters. In 2001, the publisher of the Knoxville Journal Express at the time asked me to be the lead writer of the Dirt Digest. The job involved sitting in the press box on race nights and writing the results story, in addition to columns. When the Dirt Digest folded a couple years later, former promoter Ralph Capitani allowed me to stay on and help the track with the new live results streaming on the internet. Former track historian Bob Wilson and I made a great team and Cappy made me a real track official in 2006. I also helped Bob assemble the official Knoxville Nationals program for several years. Shortly after becoming an official, I was asked by the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame and Museum to be the moderator for their \"Women in Sprint Car Racing\" forum at the Knoxville Nationals and I did that for several years, as well.\n\nBiggest accomplishment you feel you have in racing?\n\nI got to do so many different things during my 12 years of being at Knoxville full time that it's hard to pick one thing; hosting the women's forum was always incredibly rewarding. It was also a great honor to write the \"official\" results story for the 50th Knoxville Nationals. Though there were sometimes frustrations to deal with, my time working at Knoxville as a whole was the best time of my life.\n\nMost favorite thing you have gotten out of racing?\n\nUnquestionably, all the friendships I made and people I got to interact with by doing these jobs is the greatest. Race people are so awesome and I always enjoyed talking to the fans. I have so many fun memories of my Knoxville life. One of the best was the night track announcers Tony Bokhoven and Justin Zoch let me take a microphone for time trials. I think Tony thought I would totally blow it, but afterward my announcing hero, Tim Trier, said I had done a fantastic job. Rod Pattison let me fill in for Bill W one night when Hoseheads Radio was at Knoxville. Racing writers Pat Sullivan and Dave Argabright complimented my writings and the late Ruby Sorensen, who was a pioneer for women racing writers, once quoted me in her column. Sitting next to Ralph and Marilyn Capitani every week felt like going to the races with my grandparents. It was all the positive interactions with people I had always looked up to that made it all special.\n\nWho is your favorite driver and why (cannot be a relative)?\n\nThere are lots of drivers I have become good friends with over the years. Brian and Heather Brown were my weekly \"neighbors\" at the Super 8 motel in Knoxville for many years. I started writing columns for Donny Schatz's newsletter long before he became a champion. So I certainly love the success both of those guys have had at Nationals. My first favorite driver in the early days of coming to Knoxville was T.J. Giddings.\n\nBut I think most people around Knoxville know that I have been close friends with John Hall (360 driver from Marion, Iowa) since he started racing there in 1988. I liked him because he was from my part of the state, Eastern Iowa, and most of my hometown friends didn't have any idea what sprint-car racing was since we lived a couple hours from Knoxville. We became great friends and I have helped him with his racing endeavors ever since. And along that same line, I am also close with Tom Lenz (also a 360 driver from Marion, Iowa) for those same reasons. Once my work with my press box family was finished on race nights, the Hall and Lenz crews would become my pit family afterward.\n\nLife motto…\n\nIt doesn't matter how rich, talented, educated, cool or attractive you think you are. How you treat others ultimately tells all.\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nWell, I'm an only child. I'm passionate about a lot of things and I'm not afraid to stand up for what's right. I don't have much time for people who aren't nice or who aren't sincere. Both having run a newspaper (which means you never make everyone happy, least of all yourself) and working in racing (where there can be lots of testosterone-fueled egos) have taught me not to let what others say affect what I know about myself.\n\nI got to know Stacy while I was at the Nationals one year and after my accident happened 4 years ago she reached out several times and I thank her for that. She also asked me to attend the Forum but I was too sick to attend, however I hope that it will come back because it is a very neat idea. Stacy, you do a fantastic job writing and covering the races, and I can appreciate that being a PR person myself; keep up the great work DIVA!\n\nOne-on-One with Tina Madsen\n\nMadwoman J\n\nHow did Kerry & you meet?\n\nWe actually met in Knoxville in 1998, when it was Kerry’s first entire summer racing here. A group of co-workers and I would all go out on Friday nights after we finished work at Midnight. Back then we went to the 'bowling alley bar' called Sportsman’s Lounge. I was ordering a drink and as soon as he started talking to me I knew why he was here; even though I had never been to a race yet at that point.\n\nDo you have children, if so, will any of them race? No. Anyone that knows me knows how I feel about children....I do not want any! I’ve never had any interest in being a mother, which I think is a good thing being that I spend way too much time alone & doing things on my own; I would never want to bring a child into this lifestyle.\n\nDo you prefer racing here or Down Under? Here. It’s just so much simpler & not near as dirty (except for Ohio) it’s dirty!\n\nWhat do you do for a living? Well for my paying job I work for 3M here in Knoxville. I operate a machine that cuts rolls of VHB (very high bond) tape into various sizes & lengths. It’s all different kinds of tape used in vehicles, building structures/windows and solar panels to name a few. Other than that, I’m also the housekeeper, groundskeeper, secretary, pool technician, sales associate and cook.\n\nBest racing memory you and Kerry share? Finally winning the Kings Royal last year; it was such an awesome race and especially after he had been so close so many times prior, and I was actually there for it!\n\nWorst? The night he crashed at Grand Forks a few years back. He said that while walking back to trailer he noticed the top of his head was a bit sore. Then upon farther inspection he noticed his helmet had a hole entirely thru the top to the point in which it 'touched' his head! I then received a photo of the quarter sized hole the wing ram had punctured down thru the top of the helmet. That helmet is now on display at Speedway Motors in Nebraska.\n\nFavorite race track? Knoxville because its 3 miles from home! Premier Speedway in Warnnambool, Australia because its home to the Classic which I consider to be the biggest race in the country and usually the most fun! I love the town and have good friends there I get to visit as well.\n\nFavorite thing to do outside of racing? Anything outside, except for in winter! I’m always out doing yard work, or in the garden, taking care of all the flowers I have.....anything to be outdoors! I grew up riding and showing horses. I’ve been away from it for a long time now, but any chance I get to go ride I take it!\n\nOne thing you would like people to know about Kerry is...He's actually a pretty shy guy. He’s also quite humble. Although he gets pretty fired up at times racing, he’s pretty laid back. And when he plays his guitar down in the basement all alone.....I sometimes hear him singing as well.....LOL! It’s actually not bad!\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nI have no idea; I totally don't consider myself a diva?? I guess I am not a fan of being told NO so in turn I will do it or get it myself- if that makes me a diva!\n\nLife motto...\n\nSignificance trumps success every time!\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Tina when I went “Down Under” with the WoO a few years ago and I liked how incredibly straight forward she was then and now. I saw her again at the Nationals a while back and she was out having a good time and Tina- your smile is somewhat contagious. I also enjoy her tweets because she is very open and honest on there too!\n\nOne-on-One with Deanna Sides\n\nI've never considered myself as a \"diva\"!! I'm more of a \"roll with the flow, whatever happens\" kind of gall; so, here ya go.....\n\nWhere did Paul & you meet?\n\nPaul & I met when we were kids. We were about 8 & 11 yrs. old. Both of our dads played in a pop/rock band together called Cloudy. You could say that we were kid groupies together!!! After the band broke up, we all went our own ways for many years. Paul & I met up by coincidence again around 1996; Then we married in Jamaica in 1998 (which is a whole other story in itself) I can honestly say that I always had a crush on him, and I still do!!!!!\n\nHow many children do you have?\n\nWe are so blessed to have 2 wonderful children; Sydney (9) & Sawyer (7) mind you that we were the couple that was \"never\" having kids-Ha-ha!! Now they are the reason we live; Funny how God does that!!\n\nWill you children race?\n\nWell, Sawyer is racing BMX now. I'm thinking it’s in his blood that he's going to race something with a motor pretty soon.... I’m still pushing that announcing thing though, look out Johnny Gibson!\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI'm a Realtorfor Re/Max and I would love to sell your house or help find your dream home!\n\nWho is your favorite driver (can’t be your husband or brother-in-law Jason)? All around guy has to be the King Steve Kinser.\n\nYour best race memory?\n\nThere are so many it's hard to pic one! I guess it was when Paul won at Atwood, TN & Larry, Judy, Mark, Debbie, & I and our whole crew jumped up & down in the bleachers so much they almost caved in!Probably Paul's entire 2003 race season\n\nYour worst race memory?\n\nI don't want to say it was the worst but, it was the one that I cried the most. It was the night that Jason won Pevely. This was right after our best friend Mark had passed away. Jason dedicated the race to him & said Mark was helping him drive! I know he was our angel that night\n\nYour favorite vacation spot?\n\nDefinitely Australia; Anywhere in AU is my favorite place to be J\n\nYour favorite food?\n\nSteak & Shrimp\n\nYour life motto?\n\nWow, life Moto- I guess is to appreciate family & friends, Love a lot, have lots of fun, and drink a beer! Like I said, I'm more of a roll with the flow, try not to sweat the small stuff kind of person... Not to say that things don't get hard with Paul being away from home as much as they are but, I know that he loves me & our kiddos, and that's what keeps me going! That's all that really mattersJ\n\nPaul & Deanna- where do I begin; I traveled a lot with Paul and Jason while working for the Outlaws and by doing so I learned how to party in the rain, sleep wherever we had too and always make sure you have your family close by. I had the opportunity to fly with both Deanna and Paul to Australia and I can say I was drunk, hung over and sober all in one flight- hard to believe I know J I would have been lost without them there and Deanna, you helped make some of the best memories I will ever have there. The entire Sides family are some of the most welcoming and caring people I have been blessed enough to have in my life. Deanna thinks she isn’t a DIVA but we all know different!\n\nONE-ON-ONE\n\nKRISTEN KNAB WOODRING\n\nHow did you get involved in racing? I have been involved in racing my entire life, starting with my mom and dad in snowmobile racing when I was little; then my brother (Mike Woodring) raced professional 3 wheelers all over the country until the late 80’s. Then when he entered sprint cars, he worked with Erin Crocker for many years and I was a part of that. I also started to become a Track Queen for Ransomville Speedway in 1993 and then Miss Empire Super Sprints as well. Since then I have started the Patriot Sprint Tour and helped with marketing for several races. Amid all of this I married Brad “Bad” Knab who races, so it will continue to be in my life forever.\n\nWho is your favorite driver (can't be related or a spouse): Tony Stewart, and I don't mean a NASCAR driver, I mean a SPRINT CAR driver!!!\n\nBest racing memory? Actually when my husband beat all the Outlaws in a B-main at Tri City Speedway! It was very cool!!!! We are underdogs, so it was very cool for us!!! I have had so many wonderful memories over the years it is hard to list one.\n\nWorst? Probably watching Brad flip out of the park at Ohsweken Speedway during the Sprint Car Nationals. That is now why they call it the Brad Knab catch fence! He had to be air lifted out and I could not go in the helicopter back to States so our poor crew guy had to ride with me the entire 3 hours!!\n\nWhat do you do for a living? I watch kids! I love it! I am starting to get back into marketing for race tracks I miss it and I am good at!\n\nFavorite track? Ohsweken speedway!!\n\nChildren? How many? Do they race? I have a 17 year old son who has raced a mini stock and snowmobiles! He crews now for Paige Polyak.\n\nFavorite vacation spot? It seems to be any dirt Sprint Car track!!\n\nI met Kristen while her Brother Mike was working with Erin on the Outlaw Tour and I enjoyed her energy. I have a degree in Public Relations so we could talk about marketing and that was always a nice conversation! A few years ago when I attended my first sprint car race after my accident; it was to watch my brother-in-law race in PA and we parked right next to Kristen and her husband Brad. She came up to me and hugged me and said Welcome Back Diva! I will never ever forget that hug. Her husband did awesome that night and our family fought motor problems but it was so worth the trip. A racing family is there anything better??!!\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS DIVA’S!!!\n\nTWO IN ONE- CORRIE AND SAMANTHA PORTSCHY\n\nSamantha:\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to race:\n\nI knew I wanted to race as soon as I saw my dad win a race and have fun doing it.\n\nHow old are you when you started:\n\nI started racing at the age of 14.\n\nDo you think your daughter will race:\n\nI would love for my daughter to be in some sport and follow her dreams; I don’t know if that's racing or not but I am not going to push her to race.\n\nHow hard it is it to be a woman sprint car driver:\n\nI would say that the guys don’t treat me like I am a woman driver they treat me like I am their own which is a good thing because I would not want to have special privileges just because I am a girl. I want to get treated like their own and have them race me just as hard as they would any other person.\n\nWhat is the one thing you want people to know about your dad:\n\nWhat I want people to know about my dad is that he was a great family man. He would do anything for his family and we always came first no matter what.\n\nYou recently graduated from college- what is your degree in:\n\nI graduated from Moraine Park Technical College with Associates in Criminal Justice.\n\nIf you had to choose dry slick or a tacky track which one would it be:\n\nI preferably choose tacky tacks because you can hold it wide open and not have to worry about spinning out.\n\nMy best moment\n\nMy best moment in racing would have to be winning a heat race my rookie year against Danny Schlafer and Pete Ostrowski.\n\nLeast favorite:\n\nMy least favorite moment would have to be when my dad crashed into a driver and then I crashed into my dad and I had to go to the hospital because I had neck pains and found out I tore all my ligaments on my second vertebra and had bruised ribs.\n\nFavorite Driver (other than your dad):\n\nMy favorite driver would have to be Donny Schatz.\n\nYour life motto:\n\nMy life motto...hmmmm I have a lot of them lol...probably live each day like it’s your last because you never know when it might be.\n\nCorrie:\n\nHave you always been involved in racing:\n\nWhen I was a young girl I was a “norm” at the Plymouth Dirt Track I was a fan of the sportsman division. I sat in the bleachers and had the mud hit me and I would always just play with my friends when the super winged modifieds went out because I liked a different division. Little did I know that I would end up falling in love with a driver in that modified division Brian “the tornado” Portschy. We met one night when I visited my dad and there was this guy in a blue hat with the lettering saying Portschy Racing. I simply said, “You know Portschy?” He replied, “I am Portschy” and then I thought he must be a jerk because of the division he raced in, boy was I wrong! He had raced since 1998 and not in a fender car so I did not pay much attention to him, but I am glad my dad had him over and we started then to build a life together. He raced sprint cars for years after his modified days and got his daughter Samantha in one as well, so I guess I knew then no fenders going to be around our shop! Two opposites attract and that was us to a tee!!\n\nFavorite win with Brian:\n\nIn all honesty, I don’t have a favorite win with Brian because each was different and all of them were just as equal as his first win. Now when he did win, my favorite part of that was how he shared it with everyone around him but mostly his family who shared 110% of his passion and love for the sport. Brian was a selfless man and if you looked at old photos of him in victory lane he was not smiling until he got to share it with his family, sponsors and fans after the races were done.\n\nBrian left us all in August, 2013, how are you doing: It was a tragic accident not race car related but still car related at our shop on a night I will never ever forget. I now get to see how our kids and my grandchild are living examples Brian. He would say “we” all the time not “I” because he was always thinking of us. His motto in life was to always include family into everything. His sister Pam is a doctor and any medical problems we had or the kids had questions on, he would say “call your aunt she will know.” She was right alongside of us throughout his time spent at the hospital before he left us and his mother was there too. He also was a mama’s boy and for as tough as his layers were there was a soft spot for his mom. His strength came from his mom and they shared a special bond that I feel he will always have with Samantha, Emily and Liz too. Brady our son was his left-hand man. He loved to work on things with his dad and help him out all the time. Those are cherished memories I know Brian loved and he was very passionate about anything he was involved with. He believed without children there would be an end to racing, so by watching his daughter race in the same division as him was a lifelong dream he had succeeded at. I will always be “Ma” Portschy because I was always involved with our families racing ventures and still plan to be. And that is how Brian would want it to be.\n\nCorrie would like to add: Brian was 28 years old when he started racing a super winged modified and did not come from a racing family. He simply saw the rush and thrill and jumped right in to owning and driving a modified and sprint car. He had started a chain now with Samantha being second generation and he was so proud of her and still is. He was very well known to his fans especially on autograph night because we had the best goodies to giveaway! BP was humbled and never took any credit for always helping people and working hard. If Brian could say one thing about the things I wrote he would say anything is possible as a child so don’t give up and oh my wife “ma” hit it on the head in this interview (lol)!!\n\nI grew up watching BP race and got to know the Portschy’s very well. Brian stood up in our wedding and for that we are so very grateful he was a part of our day. It is said that you meet people for many reasons, and I believe with my whole heart we met the Portschy’s to be encompassed by their passion for many things. Corrie and Samantha makesme laugh and has always supported me in whatever I was doing and for that my diva’s, I am forever grateful!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH HEIDI WARREN\n\nHow did Billy and you meet?\n\nWe went to school together but during high school I was dating someone else so he would just stalk me (follow me around school). After graduation we all used to go to the same bar, finally after several beverages he worked up the nerve to talk to me... and the rest is history!\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI have three jobs - my favorite job is part-time professional grandma, babysitting for my one year old granddaughter Alexis (we are expecting our second grandchild, a boy on June 8). I am also the office manager/bookkeeper for Warren Automotive & Machine and shortly (Tuesday) I will be taking my exam for my realtor’s license so then I will also be selling real estate for Anderson Realty in Beaver Dam.\n\nDo your children enjoying racing and do they ever want too?\n\nI am not sure if you would call it \"enjoy\". They have always helped in the shop and went to all of the races when Billy raced 360's. But when he went back 410 racing with all the traveling it didn't always work for them to go along. Our oldest, Cody lives in Apple Valley, MN and whenever we are in that area he and his wife Christine will come to watch and if they are home and we are racing they will come along. The youngest Sam works for the family business and he does come along to help whenever he can. Billy likes having Sam come along because he knows and understand the engine part so if there are any engine issues he can trust Sam to assist him. Happily I have to say the neither one of the boys want to race. I say this because I often think of Amy Swindell and having both husband and son racing, I am not sure my nerves could take that.\n\nYour favorite win with Billy?\n\nHmmm.... favorite win.... he had quite a few with the 360's and those wins both boys were along to share the experience and usually my family was also there. Probably my favorite would be in 1997 when he won the 360 championship, the final night he won the feature. That one was special because Cody and Sam, my family and his mom and dad were all there to enjoy it. His first 410 race I was pregnant with Sam and it was very hot and my doctor would not let me go to the races because of the heat. That one I would have really liked to have been at, all I got was to see the video.\n\nYour least favorite moment with him?\n\nI have two - the first one was when he flipped in turns three and four at Knoxville and almost bounced off the score board. The second one was at St. Croix two years ago going down the front straight passing for second in the feature the steering locked up, he turned into the front straight wall and proceeded to flip into turn one. The best/worst part was several weeks later we were in the doctor’s office and he asked the doctor what were the symptoms of a concussion; And apparently he had been experiencing these symptoms but never told me!\n\nFavorite person you have got to know through racing and why?\n\nI have met so many people through racing, which is what I think is the best part of racing. But my FAVORITE person has got to be Melissa Reinke. Most of my close friends don't understand racing, and then I met Melissa! Finally a close friend that understands my need to follow my husband all over the countryside to watch him race. We help to keep each other sane during the racing season, although I have sustained several bruises from her after a feature. Her and Mike have taken several trips with Billy and I, to Mexico and our Couples Weekends in the fall. She was also very supportive when I was dealing/fighting my breast cancer.\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nHmmm.... not sure because I never thought of myself as a diva. But I guess that standing by and supporting my husband in all his racing endeavors and fighting and winning my fight against breast cancer.\n\nA motto you live by?\n\nI have two - That which does not kill you only makes you stronger and With God all things are possible.\n\nI have had the chance to get to know both Heidi and Billy over the years and she is more of a diva then she realizes. She fought hard to be a breast cancer survivor and I am so proud and honored to call you my friend. Heidi also has a very soothing effect when you sit next to her so I tend to be less nervous, and I appreciate that trait she has. The Warren’s have also been very big supporters of our family and our circumstances we have faced and for that we are very grateful. I think Melissa and Heidi need to share in their cold weather drinks with me that I hear about…lol!\n\nOne-on-One with Kylie McMahan\n\nHow old are you?\n\n15\n\nWhat are your plans after high school?\n\nI don't know exactly what I want to do, but I know I want to do something with music.\n\nHow do you manage not seeing your dad all the time? Any advice...\n\nI've gotten used to not seeing him all the time since he has been racing my whole life; however, it is hard when he goes to Australia for a month.\n\nYour favorite racing moment with your dad?\n\nProbably when he won Eldora for the first time because he wouldn't stop saying \"Guys...I just won Eldora.\" and it made me laugh\n\nWhat do you want us to know about your dad many people wouldn't know?\n\nHe really likes to sing even though he is tone deaf and doesn't know the words.\n\nYour favorite track?\n\nKnoxville\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nI won't let anyone get in the way of my goal. If someone tells me I can't do something, I try to do it just to prove them wrong. I'm not sure if that's exactly what makes me a diva J\n\nFavorite race food?\n\nProbably the hamburgers and the fresh squeezed lemonade from Eldora\n\nFavorite driver other than your dad? :)\n\nJoey Saldana\n\nYour favorite non-racing moment your dad and you have shared?\n\nMy favorite non-racing moment would probably be all the times we've gone to amusement parks because we both love roller coasters so we ride them all together.\n\nI have gotten to know Kylie over the years and she is growing up to be an amazing and talented young lady. She has a spark just like her mother Jan when she walks in to a room. Her voice is beautiful and I think Paul will have to take lessons from her! The McMahan’s are a great family and have been supporters of my family and for that I am thankful! No one usually stands in our way as Diva’s Kylie, so of course that makes you a DIVA!! Welcome to the Dirt Diva Club!!\n\nOne-on-One with Xia Xianna Bacon\n\nHow did Brady & you meet?\n\nIt was a sunny afternoon on September 30, 2008. I was Miss Winchester for my hometown and track! I only did a few races a year, mainly the bigger events and USAC was one of them! I enjoyed being Miss Winchester and used it as an excuse to get dressed up since I wasn’t into the racing much. That day was the same as any other; being walked around to meet and greet fans, shake the driver’s hands as they were introduced for driver intros, ride in the pace car during caution laps, and stand in victory lane with the winning driver. Little did I know I would soon meet my future husband? Brady was currently driving for Kasey Kahne Racing in the midget and sprint car divisions for USAC. Today’s race was a sprint car race and Brady had won. Back then I didn’t understand the prestige that went along with winning a USAC race at Winchester Speedway. The entire team was so excited as I made my way to Victory Lane to congratulate the driver and crew. We didn’t talk much, just took pictures. After the celebrations were over I was making my way to the track office to get ready to leave when I was asked to come officially meet the winning driver. I walked over and Brady and I were introduced. We made some small talk and I was asked for my phone number. I initially said I wasn’t interested but was talked into it by a friend. Brady invited me to a bonfire that night but had other plans and I really had no interest in going. We both went our separate ways as we left. It didn’t take long for him to start texting me. I had just recently gotten out of a 5 year relationship and wasn’t interested in dating at that time. However, after a few days and a very persistent Brady, I agreed to go on a date with him. We went to dinner and a movie then came back to my house where I told him he had to meet my roommates, which were 2 girls and 3 guys. I’m pretty sure that when he arrived to pick me up the guys were trying to scare him off lol. Apparently it didn’t work! After our first date we enjoyed each others company and started spending more time together. I went to his house in Brownsburg a couple times. I remember one night we were bowling and Brady’s mom had asked for my phone number and as I was giving it to her, Brad Sweet was trying to put it in his phone ha-ha boys will be boys! That next weekend was the Hut Hundred in Terre Haute. It was my first race that I went to actually watch Brady, I’d say I was hooked from then on.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI am an Esthetician and skin care professional. I have a spa in my sister’s salon! I love making people feel great. I also do permanent cosmetics which is tattooed eyeliner, eyebrows, and full lip color. Its funny seeing peoples reaction when someone tells them that I do tattoos! When we are on the road which is the majority of the time I take care all of Brady’s merchandise and run our merchandise trailer. I also take care of all the social media and update all of Brady’s races live! You can get updates from me on twitter: @XiaXianna and on Facebook.\n\nWhat is your biggest pet peeve?\n\nWell my biggest pet Peeve is our 60 pound black lab, her name is Pevely, aka Peeve for short ha-ha. OK… One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone says they will do something and then they don’t. I would just rather them not say they can do it than to say they can and don’t. My other pet peeve is leaving lights on around the house in rooms no one is in;Brady does this all the time especially in our pantry lol.\n\nFavorite win with Brady?\n\nWell my favorite win has to be Winchester because without that win we wouldn’t have each other. Besides that win my favorite would be when Brady won both non-wing and wing features of the night during the Jesse Hockett/ Daniel McMillan Memorial race! Another good win was Brady’s win in our car at Eldora in October! It was his first win there!\n\nHardest moment with Brady while racing?\n\nThe hardest moments for me with Brady while he’s racing is either when he is qualifying or when he is leading. When he qualifies he needs the best lap he can possibly make and I know he is trying his best to make that happen. When he is leading a race I’m so excited and nervous at the same time because I know at any given time something could possibly happen to the car that is out of Brady’s control and could take the win away from him. This year this exact thing happened at a USAC race in Iowa, Brady had an 8 second lead on the field and his rear axel broke. That’s heartbreaking!\n\nYour favorite part about being on the road?\n\nI think my favorite part about being on the road is being able to spend so much time together. Most family’s only get to spend the evenings together after they get home from their 9-5 job. We work together and are a great team. I would do anything I could to help Brady and his career and being on the road with him is a big part of that. It’s how we make a living and it’s what we love doing together.\n\nWhat are your 2014 resolutions?\n\nTo win the USAC Championship this year!!! Brady is the hardest working and most dedicated person I know. He puts everything he has into what he does for a living and I believe this year is going to be one of his best!\n\nFavorite food?\n\nI love breadsticks with cheese and pizza, especially Pizza King! We are big fans of Mexican food and eat it a lot.\n\nFavorite vacation spot?\n\nWell as many racers know there isn’t much time for a vacation, but the most amazing place I have been was our honeymoon in Costa Rica. It was so beautiful. We were in the rain forest and looking out of our private bungalow was a Volcano. The scenery of all the tropical plants, trees, and flowers were so different than you see in Florida or Mexico. It truly was one of those places you only see on TV and think wow!\n\nWho is your favorite driver (can't be Brady)?\n\nAnytime Brady isn’t driving I’m probably cheering for Shane Stewart. He is such a talented driver and one of the nicest guys I know.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you’re not racing?\n\nWhen we aren’t racing we like to spend time at home to just relax. When we are busy during the race season we are gone so much that we don’t get to enjoy being home much without having to leave in a day or two. We avoid restaurants at all costs because we get so sick of eating out. We have 2 nieces and 2 nephews so we enjoy spending time with them as well.\n\nWhat do you do with Brady's racing?\n\nBesides taking care of all the merchandise which is a ton of work I pretty much help Brady with whatever he needs help with. When he’s not racing for Hoffman in the 69 car for USAC, Brady will run our own stuff with the All-Stars or World of Outlaws. We don’t have a full time crew guy so Brady pretty much does everything himself and if he needs help at the shop I’ that person. I’ve done everything from cleaning out fuel bladders to mounting and dismounting tires to changing rear ends to putting a motor in the car to cutting all the vinyl and lettering the car. Whatever he needs I will find a way to help. I may not be the best at it but we do it together.\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nHmmmm…. If I was asked this question about 5 years ago I would say probably the fact that I own over 30 pair of heels and it’s rare for me not to be all dressed up. But since I obviously don’t live that life anymore I’d say it’s my type A personality. I’m a very organized person that has a place for everything. I plan everything ahead of time even if its months away. This sometimes drives me crazy because you can’t always do that with our schedule and how it can change last minute. I’m also extremely competitive and Brady and I are always trying to outdo each other; he on the track and me in the merchandise trailer, we keeps tabs of who makes more money that night lol. I can get down and dirty at the track but I can also be the girly girl when I’m at home.\n\nThank you so much for asking me to do this for you!!! I appreciate it and hope you enjoy getting to know us a little better.-Xia Xianna Bacon\n\nI had to opportunity to meet Xia at the Knoxville Nationals a few years back and we were both a bit busy so it was a short moment we spent together. Last year I was able to see Brady make ALL THREE A-MAIN EVENTS AT ELDORA in October and capture a win! I was excited my brother-in-law made the BOSS show at Eldora in the non-wing car and Brady won the A-main in their own car, so there was excitement in the pits for me! Xia has one of the biggest hearts of anyone because she has not yet met my niece Ava who has a Congenital Heart Defect but she supports her all the time. I reached out to her and Brady and she didn’t even blink an eye and sent raffle items for our Bowling for a Broken Heart Benefit last weekend. Without even meeting her she said “No child should have to go through this and bless her little heart- we will pray for her always.” Diva’s stick together! I have learned this in many ways since I started doing this, and I am so excited to welcome her to our Dirt Diva family! Make it a Diva day! PS. I like to work on our race car too :-)\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH HEATHER BROWN\n\nHOW DID BRIAN & YOU MEET?\n\nI have always wished that I had some romantic fairy tale story to tell of our meeting; however, I don't! Brian grew up in a town 15 minutes away from my hometown, but I guess a couple years’ age difference made it so there was no running into each other and no high school romance! However, in my twenties, I would see Brian out and about and my girlfriends and I would always joke that he was my future husband! He was exactly what I was looking for in a man: tall, good dark hair, pretty smile, and a nice dresser. One night we were at the right place and the right time. He was single and I was single, so we tried it. Ten years later, here we are!\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?\n\nI am a hairstylist at a salon in Blue Springs, MO. I have been blessed to have one of the best jobs a woman can have and lucky enough to have done it for almost 17 years! My clients who know nothing about sprint car racing have been very supportive of the life style I have! Many times I’m able to move appointments last minute or work late hours to be able to leave town for a race. I am slowly educating \"fancy\" women about a little bit of \"dirt\" racing and what it is all about!\n\nHOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN RACING?\n\nI have been asked this questions many times! At the Nationals this year, I was a part of a women's panel about \"women in sprint car racing\". As I sat and listened to the women answer questions, every single one had a wonderful story about growing up being involved in racing since childhood or that they had a family member race. Then there was me. When I met Brian, I wouldn't say it was his pickup line, but I do remember him throwing it out there a few times that he was a sprint car driver. My response was simply, \"What the heck is a sprint car?\" Brian was racing the Casey's #6 with the Outlaws and he invited me and some friends to come see him race. So we packed up and headed to Pevely, MO, to a race. If you have ever been to a race there, then you know when I say this that Pevely was not a place for a first-timer to see her boyfriend race! That race was 10 years ago, and 10 years later I am still here! So even though I was not raised around racing, I can honestly say that I think I have now been involved long enough to understand what this racing stuff is all about!\n\nWHAT IS YOUR PET PEEVE?\n\nOh jeez I have many pet peeves, from chomping gum to biting fingernails! But as far as a pet peeve in racing, it is pretty simple-- JEALOUSY! Gosh this one is a topic I could chat about for days! From the message boards, to every piece of social media out there, it drives me crazy to see the jealousy and mean things people say about racers! When someone works hard, accomplishes something great, or even gets a big opportunity, many, many times instead of the praise they deserve, I read such negative comments and words to tear them down! I will never understand jealousy and if people actually feel better after saying negative comments.\n\nFAVORITE FOOD\n\nI am a food junkie! I love all kinds of food. But if I had to narrow it down to one favorite, I would say Mexican! Cannot go wrong with chips and salsa and a margarita!\n\nFAVORITE MOVIE\n\nI would have to say Top Gun! I really believed the first time I saw this movie that some guy would get done flying his plane, be all sweaty, and hop on his motorcycle then come busting in my front door and that was normal for romantic couples! Needless to say I am still waiting....\n\nFAVORITE SPRINT CAR DRIVER (can't be Brian)\n\nWell I discuss this with Brian all the time. I came into racing only knowing/watching him race! I didn't know anyone else to cheer for. However, over time, I have decided I would cheer for others because I liked the look of their car, I thought the driver was cute, or I liked their sponsor! But 10 years later I now choose \"favorite\" for different reasons! So if I had to choose a driver now I would have to go with the rest of the world and say Kyle Larson. However, I am probably choosing him for different reasons than others. I do agree he is an amazing racer. I hear it from my husband all the time, but I choose him because of so much more! I am constantly amazed the few times I see him that he is still the polite, kind person that he was the very first time I met him! The kid has had so much thrown at him and has more than enough reasons to be a cocky, punk kid; however, he is not! He is a racer that is not selfish and his whole goal in becoming a professional racer is to give another racer an opportunity, and I just love that!\n\nWHAT MAKES YOU A DIVA?\n\nHmmmmm... a diva? Well, I don't really think I classify myself as a diva. Wait…who am I kidding?! It takes me as long to prepare my wardrobe for the weekend as it does the boys to do maintenance on the car all week!\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN WHILE YOU ARE NOT AT THE RACES?\n\nI enjoy spending time with my friends, going to the lake, shopping, going to ball games, having a night on the town with my friends, and going to concerts. My daughter is now attending University of Missouri, so I love to go hang out in Columbia with her! Also recently, my brother and his wife had a little girl so I am a \"new\" aunt and love every minute of that! But to be honest, whenever I have time to just be home for a weekend doing nothing that is about as good as it gets!\n\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT BRIAN NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW?\n\nOh I could go on and on about this one! He (thinks) he can sing as well as Brad Paisley, and he (thinks) he can dance as good as Usher! But thank goodness racing has been his choice for profession! Ha ha! But if I had to choose one thing that many people don't know about Brian, it is that he is an amazing step father to my daughter, Mikala. When I started dating Brian, my daughter was only 8. At that time, I would have never guessed that the single \"bachelor\" would have become one of the key parts in completing my little family. Brian has been so influential in many of Mikala's stepping stones-- school, sports, dating, break ups, college, and many more. He has truly been the person she can call at any time of the day, and he will drop whatever he is doing to help her! This is what I love the man for, not because he drives a race car!\n\nEXPLAIN THE EMOTIONS OF RUNNING 2ND AT THE KNOXVILLE NATIONALS\n\nWell, now I guess I get to explain 2 years of the emotions! Ha ha! When I try to explain it to people, I don't know how I can put into words all of the different emotions. Two years ago, the emotions were completely different than they were this year. So, go back to 2012 Nationals, I remember thinking to myself the whole day that it was just amazing that we made the show, so however Brian finishes I will be happy. I was so very, very nervous at the beginning of the race, just because I was so worried about the unknown-- blown motor, flat tire, etc. As the race came closer to the end, I would have never said it to Brian, but I would have just been happy to have a top 5!\n\nThen with Donny Schatz in the lead, I think it is a mental compromise that we will have to settle for nothing better than second place, which hey I was ok with! I will never forget, I was sitting on the floor in the suite and each lap he was getting closer and closer to Donny, and I thought, “Oh my goodness if Brian pulls this off…” and I made the joke to everyone that I began to spend $150,000 in my head.\n\nJust like that Schatz bobbles and Brian is as close as he has been all night. The picture of the checkered flag and the cars at the line will NEVER ever leave our memory! Sooo freakin close! So freakin close! Next came a different emotion...\n\nTo my husband, winning the Knoxville Nationals is like becoming President of the United States! There is nothing more that he wants. So coming from just happy to make the show to running 2nd is one step closer to his dream. The excitement was unexplainable! I got to sit back and watch something I had not witnessed before, which was the excitement not just from our family or his crew guys, but from fans that have been fans of Brian’s for years. Seeing them excited and then seeing the boys he grew up with watching the races at Knoxville and the emotion they felt and seeing grown men in tears because they know how very special that moment was for all of us. It was one of the best feelings in the world!\n\nEvery single person that has had a part in Brian's racing career was there to witness that night and all the emotions. Unforgettable for sure!\n\nSo, 2013 emotions are completely different than 2012. This year it was a calm feeling for me. I wasn't sick to my stomach or shaking so bad I couldn't stand up. This year was almost like a numb feeling at the start. There was so much more pressure this year because I feel that so many fans were behind Brian and putting the pressure to win on his back. It was an amazing feeling working in the t-shirt trailer every day and hearing the different comments from people that were pulling for Brian or that they knew this was his year. For me, I thought everything was going our way, so I just knew it had to come this year.\n\nWhen the races started and Brian took the lead it was almost like that calmness was still there for me. At the halfway point I got a whole new feeling back! Good ol Schatz was coming and coming fast. So after leading 41 laps and getting passed this year by Schatz at the end-- it was a completely different feeling running 2nd! Two years ago finishing 2nd was like we won the Nationals and this year finishing 2nd was nothing like that. I know that Brian will get the win some day. He wakes up every single day thinking about what he can do to win it and he goes to sleep every night thinking about the same, so I know it will come.\n\nI cannot wait to answer a question like this when he does!\n\nFAVORITE WIN THAT STANDS OUT TO YOU WITH BRIAN\n\nGosh this is a hard one because I feel like so many wins have stood out for different reasons. Races where he started very last and won it or races when all of our friends and family have been there all have such memories. Anymore, it doesn't matter where you win. It stands out because competition is so tough. But, if I had to choose just one race that stands out, even though it wasn't a win, would for sure be 2nd at Knoxville Nationals 2012. That was one of the greatest memories for all of us with Brian.\n\nHeather and Brian have been amazing with my niece Ava June Biel who was born with a Congenital Heart Defect & has had three open heart surgeries in 9 months since being born. I reached out to Heather after meeting her and hanging with her a few years ago at the Nationals and ask if she would send something for Ava’s hospital room from Brian because she needs to have more Dirt Diva items in her room.\n\nShe without hesitating sent items from Brian and has not stopped checking-in on her. We will never be able to express how much we appreciate it- but I do know this that Ava went to her first Nationals this year and was smiling the whole time. Dirt Diva’s are unique in their own right but all of them have hearts of pure gold. I am so blessed to have gotten to know Heather & Brian on a different level other then racing. Heather welcome to the Dirt Diva world-THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH LAUREN STEWART\n\nHow did Bryan Clauson & you meet?\n\nWhen Bryan and I met, I was Ms. Eldora Speedway and I was helping at a Tony Stewart Racing event at the Knoxville Nationals. The TSR event was a Chevy “Test Drive with your favorite driver” day and I was helping with registration. During the day Bryan and I got introduced and I jokingly signed us up to take a test drive. Well, our turn came and we hopped in a Camaro with me behind the wheel. A couple minutes into the drive I scared Bryan and asked him if he wanted to take over the driving duties. We made it back to the track in one piece (with my scary driving and all). Five months later I needed a date to the Eldora banquet… after some prodding from Misha Geisert I asked him to be my date and the rest is history!\n\nWhat do you do currently?\n\nI just finished up my junior year of college. I attend Indiana University in Indianapolis (IUPUI) and I am majoring in marketing. I have a part time job for the summer, but I’m basically Bryan’s full time personal assistant, which is a 25-hour-a-day job. I handle his merchandise and his social media while at the track. We just launched an iPhone/Droid app and I keep that updated. We just got a puppy, her name’s Chevy and if you follow me on twitter or Facebook you’ve probably seen her!\n\nHow long have you been involved in racing?\n\nI’ve been involved in racing since I was in the womb! When I was younger my dad sold tires and fuel at local dirt tracks in Illinois. My parents have owned their own racing merchandise business since they’ve been married. Growing up my parents traveled to NASCAR races with their merchandise trailers. I was pretty lucky and got to travel with them a lot! They always did a lot of dirt races as well, East Bay, Knoxville, Eldora and some WoO races. I grew up with winged sprint cars, and I never went to non-wing races until I started dating Bryan. I hate to admit it, but I think I might be converted. I still enjoy wing cars, especially the atmosphere at a World of Outlaws race, but you’ll never see a boring non-wing race!\n\nWhat is your favorite track?\n\nHmm… this question has several answers! My favorite overall track is definitely Kokomo Speedway! Kokomo always puts on a good show; it’s always a good race. I’ve seen winners come from the back multiple times at Kokomo! The track is always prepped perfectly and it’s good for sprint cars and midgets. Another plus about Kokomo is the pork chop sandwich; next time you’re there you need to get one. I promise it’s the best item on a concession stand menu in the country. My favorite track for qualifying is Lawrenceburg Speedway. The track is really cool to look at empty because of the banked corners, so single car qualifying is pretty exciting! The drivers are on the gas for qualifying there and it usually takes someone pretty crazy to set quick time at Lawrenceburg. My favorite event is the Knoxville Nationals, so Knoxville Raceway is on my list of favorites. I love the Nationals and it’s something I look forward to every year! I’ve never missed a Nationals and I don’t plan on it anytime soon!\n\nExplain the emotions Bryan & you felt for qualifying for the Indy 500...\n\nThe whole month of May was such an awesome experience last year. We spent so much time at the speedway with the whole Sarah Fisher Hartman team and everyone became like family. The coolest thing was seeing people in their dirt track shirts walking around the speedway. So many people told me they were attending their first 500 because Bryan was racing and that was pretty neat. The month was like a roller coaster of emotions, especially Pole Day. When Bryan hit the track for his qualifying run, the crowd went crazy.\n\nI was sitting in the stands with my little brother and I watched Bryan come around three times and on that fourth and final time around I heard the crowd before I saw what happened. Bryan had a really good run going, the crowd cheering louder every time by and then it was a collective groan and I looked up at the screen and saw what had happened. My immediate reaction was fear; I was scared because Bryan just hit the wall really hard at 220+ mph. I watched him get out of the car, so I knew he was okay. Then I was devastated, for Bryan, for the fans that we’re watching, and for the whole SFHR team.\n\nThe team worked so hard and got the car put back together for Bryan and the next day when he qualified for the Indy 500 was such an incredible feeling! I was so proud of him and the smile he had on his face is an emotion I’ve never seen from him! He was completely beaming and it was awesome to see him so happy. The next week was crazy busy with dinners, the parade, practice and finally race day. The second best moment of the whole month was during driver intros. When Bryan was introduced the crowd cheered louder than I’d heard all month! Hearing him introduced as I stood on the track by his car made it so real. Bryan’s racing in the Indy 500!! How many people can say they’ve done that?!\n\nWhat do you see in your future?\n\nGraduation in One year! I’m pretty excited for that. Majoring in marketing I hope to find a job that is in motorsports. I would love to work for a series or a track. I’m not 100 percent sure what I want to do, but I still have some time to figure that out!\n\nFavorite food:\n\nOh man. I love to eat. I love a good steak and baked potato, that’s my go to at a restaurant. My favorite thing to cook is baked spaghetti, pretty simple, but it always hits the spot! I always and I mean always, save room for dessert. My favorite is pineapple frozen yogurt from Orange Leaf.\n\nFavorite movie:\n\nMy all time favorite movie is 8-Seconds. If I could watch it every night I totally would. I don’t even have to have the volume up because I have every word memorized. I cry like a baby at the end every time, but it’s such a good story it’s hard not to be emotionally attached to it!\n\nChevy the dog is what breed :) love her by the way!\n\nShe’s a Jack Russell mix. Not sure what she’s mixed with… we think a Beagle. She’s almost 5 months old! I love her way more than I thought I’d ever love a dog! She’s spoiled rotten and I think I’ve become a crazy dog lady.\n\nWhat is the motto you live by?\n\nI don’t necessarily have a motto, but I am a big believer that everything happens for a reason. I’ve learned to deal with change and have an open mind about people and situations. That’s especially important in the racing world because things change all the time!\n\nWhat makes you a diva?!!\n\nOh goodness… Well, if you asked Bryan what makes me a diva he’d probably tell you my opinion. I always have an opinion and I’m usually not afraid to share it. I have learned when I need to keep my comments to myself, but when we get in the car after the races everything comes spilling out! Another thing that we joke about is that I always use the side of the trailer as a mirror. I’m not really girly, and 99% of the time I have a ponytail and hat on at the races, but I still check my reflection when I get the chance!\n\nWho do you look to as a role model?\n\nMy role model is Misha Geisert, program manager at Tony Stewart Racing. I’ve known Misha since I was Ms. Eldora and I’ve had a relationship with her ever since! I think her job is awesome, but I think it’s even more impressing that she is in her position in a male dominated field. Misha gets stuff done, but she does it so professionally and politely and that is something I really admire. She’s always on the go, always has her phone out, but she’s a really cool, down-to-earth person when you get to know her! Not going to lie, I was slightly intimidated when I first met her, but then I learned she was just very serious with her job. She should be because what she does is hard and I don’t think anyone else could do it better!\n\nFavorite driver besides Bryan!!\n\nMy favorite driver is Joey Saldana! My parents have been friends with the Saladana’s so I’ve gotten to know Joey and his wife Shannon pretty well. I like Joey because he’s always exciting to cheer for on the track, but he’s a super nice person off the track too! Bryan’s joked around with me before and asked if him and Joey were racing each other who I would cheer for and I’m not really sure… let’s hope it doesn’t happen!\n\nI met Lauren at a non-wing race last year in Sun Prairie, WI and we had a wonderful conversation about life and since then she has been a huge supported of my family and my niece Ava who was born with a congenital heart defect and spent 130 days in Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and has survived three open heart surgeries (she certainly is a diva)... Lauren and Bryan both took time to pray and send items to brighten her hospital room and we truly appreciate their love & support.\n\nI also love her dog Chevy and will never forget when my husband went to race at the Brownstown Speedway for the No Way Out 40- I was in pure panic because this was his first time running wingless and she was great with my panic-ness- lol :)\n\nAfter the A-main event I went to thank Misha and Lauren for their help and thank Jimmy Carr for a part we needed and Chevy at through her kennel and got at her food- I laughed so hard because no one talked about Bryan’s finish because Chevy took the spot light- as soon as Bryan got out of the car she says “Bryan do you know what your dog did during the A-main- she ate through her kennel and got at her food and ate most of it!” His response, “Oops I guess we need a new kennel and laughed at her.”\n\nChevy and Lauren are both Diva’s and we are huge Joey Saldana fans too! Plus I used to work for the Professional Bull Riders so some of those that were depicted in the movie\"8 Seconds\" I am good friends with them. I want to THANK YOU Lauren and Bryan for loving our family as much as we love you!!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH MELISSA PAULUS\n\nHow did Brian and you meet?\n\nBrian and I met at Huset's Speedway in Brandon South Dakota. I was at the Outlaw show talking to all of the teams about a job on the road, and I had one taker. I made arrangements to travel to Fargo the following weekend so Brian could see what I knew. By the end of the weekend, I wasn't really changing gears and checking bolts but something between us just clicked. Two weeks later I flew to Pennsylvania to spend a weekend with Brian. Two weeks later I had packed up everything in my apartment, moved everything into storage and was on my way to Knoxville. I traded my two bedroom house for a forty foot motor home. We got married on Valentine’s Day in Florida at the beach. It sounds a little fairy tale like, but we've been married for 8 years now.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI'm a full time wife and mom. I actually tell people I'm a stay at home mom with a full time job. Brian and I own Tear Off Apparel. I am also getting ready to start my own little business out of our shop that specializes in rhinestone and glitter transfers.\n\nTell us what Tear Off Apparel is and how it started?\n\nTear Off Apparel is the screen printing business that Brian and I started while he was still racing full time. We knew that racing full time wasn't going to last forever, so when we were given the opportunity to start our own business, we took it. We started with a small automatic press in a corner of our race shop. We have grown to a point that we traded in the small press for a much much larger one. We now have a print shop with a race car in the corner. It's still just Brian and I in the shop. It's a fact that every shirt that has ever left Tear Off Apparel has been printed by Brian or me. I do almost all of the social media for Tear Off Apparel and for Brian. It's sometimes what he's saying, but it’s always me typing.\n\nYour favorite food?\n\nHhmmm, there's so many things I enjoy. I love going out for Mexican. When I'm cooking, I'd say that shepherd’s pie is my favorite.\n\nYour favorite movie?\n\nI've always loved The Lion King. With or without kids, I can watch that move over, and over again.\n\nFavorite moment with Brian racing? I can't pick just one! I can narrow it down to two. The first year that we were married, Brian won the Outlaw show at Huset's Speedway. Brian won a few Outlaw shows that year, but it was really special because my parents and a lot of my friends were there. It was a nail biter for me with a few close restarts; Brian led from start to finish with the In-Law pressure on (ha-ha).\n\nThe other top moment was last year at the Knoxville Nationals. It wasn't Brian's best performance (starting on the outside pole in 2005 is tough to beat), but it was in so many other ways. It was the first time we had been to the Nationals in a couple of years. Brian had a major injury to his arm, and the race team had been sold off. We showed up using our old merchandise trailer to haul our car, a car that was new in 2004, a motor that was new in 2005, and no budget for tires. We qualified on used tires Wednesday night. Brian was top ten in time trials, made it threw his heat, and lined up mid pack of the A main.\n\nBrian was up to 2nd, coming out of turn four to take the white flag, the Ujoint broke. At that point the amount of pride I had in my husband's performance was pretty overwhelming, and then to have a devastating finish like that- For a team that races on such a limited budget, that night was like winning the big show. The next day we were able to repair broken pieces, and check the motor. The motor wasn't in the best shape, but learning that Brian was starting in a transfer spot of the B Saturday night, we knew he had to give it a shot. Saturday was a really long day not knowing if the motor was going to make it 5 laps, or 50! Brian had quite the line up right behind him so that only added to the stress.\n\nBrian started 4th, raced Sammy Swindell and Jason Sides most of the race, and finished 3rd, ahead of both of them. By the end of the race, I thought I was going to pass out in the stands. My dad had marks on his forearm from where I had squeezed it so tightly, and my friends had paper towels thrown at them and were told to sit down by the people behind them.\n\nI don't know if I had ever had so many emotions all at once. Brian was starting 24th in the main event at the Knoxville Nationals. I was more proud at that moment than the year he set quick time, more than winning back to back Outlaw shows. Brian had raced an amazing race, and had qualified that week on used tires, what most would call an old car, and with a tired motor. That was a testament to what kind of driver Brian really is. He is an amazing driver with so much talent!\n\nHardest part of being on the road is...\n\nWith kids, it's making sure I have all of their stuff packed, and making sure I have enough of their necessities and stuff packed. I'm out of practice so packing can take quite a while. I have to make a list and start carting stuff out to the truck a week before we leave.\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nI've never thought of myself as a diva before. I have always kind of been the opposite of a girly girl. Maybe my new found love for rhinestones makes me some kind of a diva. Or maybe it's the confidence I’m trying to instill in my girls that it's ok to take a chance. You're not going to get anywhere without a little risk. If that's what a diva is than I hope I'm the best.\n\nDo you think your children will want to race?\n\nI can very confidently say that is a great big no for Adie. She is so busy with cheerleading it doesn't leave much time for anything else. She does love helping her daddy with his car though, and loves scraping mud! Mira, it's too soon to tell. I'm going to do what I can to turn her into an executive, or cheerleader or anything that doesn't involve going fast in circles!\n\nWhat motto do you live by?\n\nAnything worth doing is worth doing right. Don't WASTE your time beating around the bush; you could be using that time for something much more valuable.\n\nFavorite racer (can't be Brian :)\n\nIf I can't say Brian (even though he really is), then it's the person that I credit for teaching me most of what I know about a sprint car, Doug Martens. He's also the person that gave me the push to find a job with an Outlaw team. He's more than my favorite driver, he's a true friend!\n\nIt's amazing how my life has taken so many turns and changed direction so many times with Brian and now my girls. Traveling has allowed me to meet so many interesting and great people. It's given me the opportunity to live a dream I didn't know I had. I have great experience for the industry that I'm now involved in full time, by running Brian's merchandise trailer. I have so many stories that most people probably don't believe me when I tell them where I've been and who I've met. I tried to live a \"normal\" life when we moved to Indiana, and found that I was much better suited for Tear Off Apparel, and a racer's wife. We only race a few times a year now, whatever our budget and schedule allows, but by printing mostly racing apparel it allows me to stay in contact with the racing world.\n\nI had the joy of meeting Melissa when I was on the road with the WoO and Brian raced full-time with them so I got to see their love for each often and it was amazing to see them together. One story that I have with Melissa is that we were in Pennsylvania at Williams Grove and Stevie Kinser and I got Steve’s t-shirt truck stuck in the mud and neither of us wanted to tell him- so Stevie asked Melissa to go get him and let him know we needed some help. Steve got in the truck and got us unstuck but threw mud all over other people’s campers but the people there didn’t care it was Steve Kinser who did it. Melissa then for the rest of the night would walk by the Outlaw merchandise t-shirt trailer and ask if I needed any help because she didn’t want me to get stuck in a cabinet or something. We laughed and laughed! I cheered last year so loud at the Nationals for Brian because he was really the underdog and it was awesome to see him push off for the A-main! Melissa you are one of the most kind and thoughtful ladies I have met and I get to pick who is a diva or not and YOU ARE IT!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH KENDRA JACOBS\n\nFor those people who don't know you- can you explain your connection to dirt track racing?\n\nI was literally born into a racing family. My father, Kenny Jacobs raced sprint cars for more than 35 years. His father, Kenneth \"Jake\" Jacobs raced when he was young, as well. And my great-grandfather \"Pete\" Jacobs built Wayne County Speedway. In addition to that, my uncle Dean Jacobs still races. My brother Lee Jacobs races in Ohio. My cousin Cody Jacobs is a mechanic. My cousin's husband, Brian Bloomfield, is the crew chief for Sammy Swindell and my Uncle Ed Haudenschild and his son Brad Haudenschild are former sprint car drivers. (Whew) Racing was all I knew growing up. I thought that every kid in school went to the races on the weekends. It took me quite a while to realize how special my life was.\n\nWhat is your job with Hendrick Automotive Group?\n\nCurrently, I work as the Manager of Communications for Hendrick Automotive Group. We have 86 car dealerships across the country so it keeps me hopping! From 2006 through the 2011 NASCAR season, I worked as a Public Relations Rep for the No. 5 team at Hendrick Motorsports. Through the years I worked directly with Kyle Busch, Casey Mears and then Mark Martin. There was never a dull moment!!! But, honestly, the travel got to me after 10 years, and I knew it was time to do something new.\n\nDid you ever believe the Kick It for Cancer would have been as successful as it is?\n\nI had HOPED it would be. This was something so spur of the moment for me to get involved with. When I heard they were sponsoring a sprint car, I knew that I wanted Jeff to LOVE being involved in sprint car racing again and then I remembered the softball games Knoxville used to have and all of this started clicking to have a kickball game there instead. The Knoxville game came together in about three weeks. Looking back that seems crazy but it wouldn't have been a success if the drivers hadn’t has embraced it as much as they did. They all gave so much of themselves and really had fun out there on the field. That's the side of these guys I think the fans really want to see. They sold themselves and, in turn, sold the game. It was a great thing to see and even greater event to be a part of. Since that game, sprint car racing has hosted eight games around the world and raised more than $160,000! It's amazing what we can all do collectively!\n\nHow do you manage a job with most of it being around asphalt but being a huge dirt fan?\n\nWhen I traveled with NASCAR, I would try to find dirt races that matched up with the NASCAR schedule. I always notice more of them now that I'm not out there! But really I felt like I was an advocate for sprint car racing or at least I wanted to be. I'm surprised at how many people with NASCAR, both in the sport and as fans, don't know about sprint car racing. More of them do now since Tony and Kasey own sprint car teams, and I think Kyle Larson is gaining a lot of awareness for us too but, this is an amazing sport that seems to be, unfortunately, overlooked at times-So, I tried my best to talk about it as much as possible to build interest in the sport and really explain the excitement. Hopefully I at least gained sprint car racing one fan over the years.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing you like to do?\n\nOooh...going to the races is definitely my favorite. Any kind!! Dirt is the best racing, but the people in NASCAR became my family too. So, truly if I'm at a race track, I'm happy J other than that sleep-I know that's horrible, but it's honest.\n\nFavorite racer besides your family members? Asphalt -dirt or both :)\n\nOn asphalt, it's Tony Stewart. I adore him and his big heart. Anyone who doesn't like Tony Stewart just doesn't know Tony Stewart. I've never met a more giving person. On dirt, it's Tony Stewart. HA! Just kidding...that's a tough one because I like so many of them for different reasons. I would say Donny Schatz is pretty high on my list. Not necessarily for what he does as a driver, but for how he mentors me. If I ever have a question about the sport I know I can call Donny and he'll fully explain everything to me. I appreciate that more than I could tell him.\n\nFavorite dirt track?\n\nEldora. What can I say, I love slide jobs. And they're better there than any other track.\n\nFavorite asphalt track?\n\nDarlington. Old Darlington. I think the newer surface will be great. But back when I started in NASCAR, Darlington would eat away the tires in less than one lap. Meaning the drivers had to hang on for dear life and really fight to drive the car. I loved that you knew the guy that won was really the best one out there.\n\nWhat makes you a dirt diva?\n\nOooh...depends on the definition of diva! I love sprint car racing. I think it's what keeps me sane in all honesty. There are no egos (well little ones) and the people involved are solely in that pit area and in that race shop because they're so passionate about this sport. To share that passion and hopefully pass it on, that's my one goal in my career. Hopefully other fans, male or female, can see how much I LOVE this sport. I don't know if that makes any sense...but I guess that makes me a “dirt\" something. Now, the fact that I wear white to the track all the time probably makes me a diva!\n\nIf you could give anyone advice about racing & working in the field-what would it be?\n\nGet thick skin! This sport is tough. It's not glamorous. Its long hours- It's dirty truck stop bathrooms. It's dealing with insecurity and instability. There's nothing easy or certain in this sport. And no one's going to come up to you and hand you anything. Work hard-Show you're serious and then have some fun- Always have fun J\n\nMotto you live by?\n\nA friend of mine recently taught me \"Be where your feet are!\" I'm TRYING to live by that. But it's hard for me. I'm always checking Facebook and Twitter or taking pictures or writing notes. There comes a time when I need to just stop and enjoy the moment.\n\nThe only other thing that I would add is how much I love doing Winged Nation on Motor Racing Network. This job is my dream job! I get to spend one hour a week just talking about sprint car racing. Not only about the race itself but with and about the people and their families-it’s like returning to my childhood and just talking about a normal day with my racing family. I could not have asked for a better opportunity. To get to this point in my life and have a voice in this sport, not just be \"Kenny's daughter,”-is something I had hoped for one day, but feels even better than I had imagined.\n\nI met Kendra way back when I ran for the Knoxville Nationals Queen contest way back in the day- LOL!! I got done with the entire contest and was really upset that I did not answer the question they asked me right because it threw me for a loop, and she walked up to me and took me and took me aside and I will never forget what she said it sticks with me today-\n\nShe said this- “you may not know who I am but I know who you are- I watch you in the pits with your boyfriend (at the time) work on his car and you could run circles around these girls if you had to take apart and put a sprint car back together and it was judged on that. Your question you got was dumb and you answered it just fine- but maybe you just belong getting dirty and I see you dirty all the time. Keep up the good work not many girls would ever do what you do.” – The question was- what does a top wing do??…\n\nI will never forget that question and never forget that moment she came up to me because for a moment I reflected back when I was a track queen in 1998 and had fun with it but dressing up at the races really like Kendra pointed out was not my calling- I like to get dirty at the race track and usually did in my dress when I was queen working on my Uncle’s super winged modified. I still work in our race shop on my husband’s sprint car-I get dirty at the race track and I would not have it any other way.\n\nKendra you put me in my place that day and I thank you for that because you brought me back to where I thought I wanted to be and for that I am grateful and blessed- You truly are a Dirt Diva and I am honored to share that title with you now and call you my dear friend J\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH ERIN CROCKER EVERNHAM\n\nHow did Ray Evernham & you meet?\n\nAt the end of the 2004 World of Outlaw season, I started talking to several NASCAR teams about driving opportunities. At the time there was a big push for diversity and most teams had budgets for development programs. My agent and I got a call from Ray asking us to come down to North Carolina and meet with him. So we did and the deal he offered me for the 2005 season was very fair and so I signed with him the following week. The rest is history!!\n\nWhat was your most exciting moment traveling full-time with the World of Outlaws Sprint Series?\n\nThat's an easy one! Winning the feature event at Tulare!! I can remember every detail of that day! It was near the end of the season and we had had a rough west coast swing. I started 6th and I remember passing Jac Haudenschild for the lead with just a few laps to go. It was one of the most exciting moments of my life, never mind just that season!!\n\nHow would you describe what it’s like being a successful woman race car driver?\n\nI am not sure necessarily how successful I have been. As a race car driver, you always think you could have or should have accomplished more. But I do appreciate when people I look up to in racing, say I am a \"real racer.” As a woman race car driver that's all I ever wanted to be considered. I race for the pure competition and love for speed.\n\nDo you prefer dirt or asphalt?\n\nDirt! I enjoyed and certainly appreciated the racing I got to do in ARCA, Trucks and Nationwide but to me, the most fun I have ever had in a race car is in a winged sprint car-30 or 40 laps just all out, up against the fence.. You can't beat that!\n\nFavorite food?\n\nOh gosh, this is hard.. I am a foodie! I eat just about anything. I love everything from sushi and filet mignon to pizza burgers at Eldora!\n\nFavorite race car driver (one from dirt & one from asphalt)?\n\nSteve Kinser and Dale Earnhardt\n\nWhat do you do now that you are not racing on dirt full time?\n\nI am a part time driving instructor at the BMW Performance Center in South Carolina, I write articles for AskPatty.com (a women’s automotive website), I am on the board of directors for the National Sprint Cart Hall of Fame, I do some TV and radio here and there and work at our shop Ray Evernham Enterprises on projects Ray and I have going on... I keep myself pretty busy!\n\nWhat was the hardest part of being on the road full time?\n\nBeing away from my family was probably the hardest part. When I ran the WoO tour in 2004 I had just graduated from college where I lived in a sorority house, so I went from that to living with 3 guys on the road. Talk about culture shock! It was a great time in my life to do something like that though. I didn’t own a car; I didn’t have a house or apartment. Whatever I did own at the time, I left at my mom’s house so I didn’t have many personal responsibilities. The only bill I had was a cell phone bill. It would be hard to go back out there now with where I am at in life... although I'd consider ;-)\n\nIf you could tell women involved in racing or those who want to be any advice- what would you say?\n\nGo for it.. You only get one chance at this life so if it's what you love to do then by all means put all your effort into it! It takes a lot of dedication and hard work to make it happen but it’s possible. And lastly, develop thick skin, there will always be people who tell you don’t belong or you aren't good enough..Ignore them!\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nMy shoe collection ;-) Since I haven't been racing as much lately, I have gotten way more into fashion and the girly stuff. Actually I always liked fashion; I just didn’t have as much time for it. Don’t worry though.. I still enjoy getting dirty, working at the shop and playing at the dirt track!\n\nA motto you live your life by?\n\nLife can change in heartbeat so don’t sweat the petty stuff\n\nFavorite relaxing thing to do?\n\nEnjoying a day on Lake Norman with Ray and our dogs\n\nI met Erin when I worked for the WoO and I can attest to her statement about having thick skin. SHE HAS IT! I witnessed drivers saying things to her and she would just go out and out qualify them, beat them in a heat or dash or in the A-main and leave it on the track. I could not be more proud of her, and I know she appreciated that my dad was her biggest fan and loved meeting her when the WoO raced at Beaver Dam Raceway in Wisconsin where we live. Erin defines what a Dirt Diva is from all aspects of the name itself. I am honored to call her my friend, and I would love to someday fit in her shoes it whichever way that maybe!J\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH DEBI BRUNETTE\n\nHow did Randy and you meet?\n\nI met Randy at my 18th birthday party. Randy was a bartender at my bowling party. I guess I had a little too much to drink and I fell for his cheesy line...Lol!! I went to the bar and asked for a drink and he said you bet, he then flash his baby blue eyes and he grab my hand to give me my change and I felt fireworks. The rest is my fairy-tail come true.\n\nHow long has Randy raced and in what type of cars?\n\nRandy has raced since 1974...he has raced everything except legends and late models.\n\nWho is your favorite driver besides your husband?\n\nMy favorite driver is Randy then Tony Schumacher wooot- wooot!!!!!!\n\nWhat is the motto you live by?\n\nMy motto is ...Always be honest and kind to others and never live your life with what if’s. You can do anything you put your mind to do... follow your dreams.\n\nWhat are your families plans now that Randy has retired?\n\nWe will still be a part somehow with sprint car racing. We are not sure but we are enjoying one day at a time. Life is good!\n\nWhat makes you a diva?\n\nI love tucking Randy into his sprint car and taking care his race crew... I am very superstitious so I would never wear green always- I would give him good luck kisses and say our own race prayer. It was ... Go fast , turn left , no crashes or dents, have fun and be safe and always said I love you.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI work in daycare as a teacher for 25 yrs. I love it! I love taking care of our two girls Cassie and Kayla also and I love my book club which is a huge part of my life besides my family, work and racing.\n\nYour favorite moment racing?\n\nMy favorite moment was this year’s is his heat win! Randy wanted to show everyone and himself he still could race and he won!!!! I’m so proud of him it’s been a long road but he did it!\n\nYour least favorite moment?\n\nMy least favorite was the first time ever I seen him race he hit the wall and his mod was tore into pieces. I thought I finally thought I found a great guy and he's dead!!! But he jumped out of his car and was banged up but okay!!! Thank God!\n\nYour favorite thing to do now that racing won't consume every weekend?\n\nI’ve done a 5k mud run for Harbor House with my daughter Kayla and friends that was so awesome!! We will be just hanging with family and friends more! We will still be around but not racing anymore. We are truly grateful for all our race friends and family without your love and support we couldn’t have raced. Life is good!\n\nI have known Randy and Debi since Justin started racing his 360 MSA sprint car three years ago. They are an amazing couple and Randy is an incredible talent, and I never worried once when Justin and he were racing side-by-side. It was actually tough to cheer for both of them at the same time! I also told Randy I had him on tape because for laps on the video would be Randy not Justin because both of their cars looked alike to me J Debi and I became great friends through my accident and every night at the race track we would bond together as our husbands raced and always prayed for each other. I will miss them being there dearly because of their loving attitudes and both of them have the biggest hearts and giving spirits. She is a diva and I am honored to share that title with her and Randy you will be missed on the track- who am I going to tape now??!!!\n\nONE-ON-ONE WITH SUSANNAH STAPP\n\nHow long have you been involved in racing?\n\nI was born into my racing lifestyle. My grandfather, Babe Stapp drove race cars from 1923 to 1940, including 12 times in the Indianapolis 500 from 1927 to 1940. My father, Steve, owned his first race car at age 14, which he was too young to drive himself, so he had to hire drivers that not only had to drive the race car but had to drive the hauler to the races as well! My dad then drove race cars threw his twenties, which is when he met my mother, and married in 1963. He drove until 1964 when my brother was born & then he became a mechanic & car owner. My parents lived in California during the winter and in Indiana during the summer, because Indiana is where the racing was. My dad worked for many Indy teams throughout the late '60's and was a Chief Mechanic at the Indianapolis 500 in 1965 & 1966 and in April of 1971 I was born. My parents were about to put my brother in full time school and they decided they wanted to do that in Indiana rather than California. So in August of 1971, my family moved to Brownsburg, Indiana, but along the way they had to make a stop...at the Knoxville Nationals! That was my first race!! My mom dressed me in a cute little pink outfit and pink bonnet (have I mentioned I totally dislike the color Pink!!) and she and my brother Andy and I sat in the grandstands and watched the races.\n\nIn 1971 my dad began building Sprint Cars, and I grew up going to the race shop daily as my mom worked with my dad at the shop. I was just recently given a photo from Shame Carson of our race shop and surprisingly, there I was running through the shop, it was very cool! I remember as a kid I used our open race car trailer as my jungle gym and uneven bars!\n\nWe raced mostly the USAC Sprint Car Circuit where my dad won the USAC Sprint Car Championships in 1974 & 1976 with Pancho Carter as the driver. He built many cars throughout those years but not too long after Pancho moved on to drive Indy cars my dad started to transition into a trucking business and ventured away from building race cars. My dad continued to own and campaign sprint cars with various drivers piloting his cars until my brother decided he wanted to race in the late 80's. I loved going racing with my brother, as we were always very close, despite our 6 1/2 year difference. As a matter of fact,\n\nAndy and I always worked for the family growing up and once Andy started driving full time, my dad opened a Speed Shop to sell race car parts and Andy & I ended up running the speed shop. Andy moved on from driving and now lives in North Carolina and works for a NASCAR team as a finish fabricator. After we closed the Speed Shop, I worked for Stealth race cars in Indianapolis, Indianapolis Raceway Park and then went to work for Hoosier Tire Midwest - Indy, which is one of 3 stores that is the Hoosier Tire Distributor for the Midwest. This coming July I will have worked there 12 years!\n\nSo I have been involved in racing my whole life!\n\nWho is your all-time favorite driver?\n\nI have sooo many! My brother would be my sentimental choice because so many of my racing memories are from going racing with him. Pancho Carter would have to be at the top of my list because he was just a phenomenal racer with such drive and ability, and he has always been such a great friend to our family. Joey Saldana is my favorite current day wing racer. We grew up together going to the USAC races with our fathers. It doesn't hurt that he is married to my childhood best friend and that I adore his children, but I have to say he is a bad ass in a race car, and I am very proud of him and the career he has built.\n\nBUT...of all of the racers over the years that I have watched, when I think of who would be my all time favorite I have to say....Jack Hewitt. I loved to watch him race! I loved to watch him race at Eldora! I was there when he won all four races at the Four Crown and he was Awesome!! I don't agree with everything he has done, but I still love him as a race driver! And I love that when I see him, even now, he gives me a kiss and his mustache tickles!!\n\nWhat do you do for Hoosier Tires?\n\nMy boyfriend, Chuy, would say I am \"The Tire Bitch\" but my official title, at least on my business card, is Office Manager, which I laugh at because I am the only official \"office staff,\" so I manage me!! I do a lot of customer service, answer questions, take orders and handle accounts as well as manage our Simpson Hoosier Tire Fire suit Program, which we offer to all of our customers who run our tires.\n\nBest racing memory you have to date?\n\nMy favorite memory was the first ever sprint car race that my brother won. It was at Lawrenceburg Speedway, the old \"Burg,” and the little Indiana Bull Ring that produced fantastic races every Saturday night...not the new, high bank, engine eater, beautiful Lawrenceburg. No I'm talking about the little shitty one that I grew up at practically every Saturday night. My best friend Shannon Ridenour, now Shannon Saldana was with Mom, Dad, Andy & I, as she usually was during those summer weekends. Mom was up in the grandstands for the feature while The Bopper, (which is what we all call my dad) Shannon and I were up on top of the trailer watching. I believe it was a 25 lap feature and we all paced the top of that trailer for 25 straight laps. My friend Shannon was as invested in Andy's racing as any of us. She had been up & down the highways with my family for years going racing with my brother. She was there on the good nights and endured the butt chewing’s on the not so good nights! So she was up there pacing that trailer right along with Dad and me. When Andy came off that fourth turn and took the checkered, I had to reach out and grab both my Dad and Shannon, as they were so excited that they almost walked right off the back of the trailer in their hast to get to victory lane!\n\nOnce we all climbed down the ladder, all three of us jumped on the 4-wheeler to ride out to the front stretch. Bopper was driving and I was "
