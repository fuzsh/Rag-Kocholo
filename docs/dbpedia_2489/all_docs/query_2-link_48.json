        "text": "Over the years, I have met and talked with a number of other race fans in the stands about the Good Old Days. Some of my really cherished times have been reminiscing over tracks, races and drivers from out of the past. As I prepared this story, I went back to a number of friends, whom I have spoke with over the years, to glean more background information, interesting stories and experiences. These friends all started attending races well before World War II. They came from different parts of the country and the common thread was that they all enjoyed auto racing.\n\nI spoke with Don Zabel of Tujunga, a spry 80 years young and two 76 year-old youngsters, John Smith of Whittier and Jim Van Natta of Fullerton. What spewed forth from these three gentlemen was a fountain of experiences with some of the true racing heroes over the past sixplus decades. I am deeply indebted to these three for sharing their time and knowledge with me. I must tell you that it was such a pleasure to take notes as the tales unfolded about deeds of daring-do by many famous drivers.\n\nDon Zabel is a native Southern Californian. Like so many of his generation growing up in this locale, the automobile played a significant part in his life. Starting with the old Model T, they found ways to make it go faster and then found it necessary to compete to prove who had been the most successful. Don was part of the group, who before and especially after the war, took Detroits finest and made it better. They built their Hot Rods and then participated in street races to see who was the best. Eventually with speeds escalating, they needed more clear space, so they moved to Muroc and El Mirage Dry Lakes. Sundays attendees at the dry lakes, read like a whos who of the Hot Rod Hall of Fame. There was Ed Iskendarian, Doug Moon, Al Barnes, Don Zig and many more. Don Zabel was there, running his 32 Ford roadster with the Mercury flathead engine.\n\nDon was first introduced to auto racing by one of his neighbors from Eagle Rock, who took him to the old Ascot tracks and Gilmore. After returning from the war, Don set up an automotive repair shop in Glendale, with partner, Bruce Robinson. In the late forties and early fifties, the area around Glendale was a hot-bed of auto-racers. A close friend was A.J. Watson, whose nearby shop generated so many of the famed Indy roadsters. Frank Kurtis also had a shop in Glendale, where the first Novi Indy cars were developed. Racing pioneer, Don Blair operated a speed shop in Pasadena. From this general area of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena, came some of the heroes of that era, namely; Rex Mays, Jack McGrath, Rodger Ward, Sam Hanks, Gordon Schroeder, Johnnie Parsons and Manny Ayulo.\n\nIn addition to general repair work, they did a lot of custom work, since the modern day kits had not yet been invented. Don says he taught himself to weld when he was about twelve. They decided to build a track roadster, which they raced on Friday and Saturday, then pulled the engine, put it into Dons 32 Ford and went to El Mirage on Sunday morning. On the way home, they would stop off at the Fontana, Colton, Saugus or San Fernando Drag Strip and compete. After drag racing got somewhat organized, they would run the Santa Ana strip.\n\nDon and Bruce had a third partner in the track roadster, Ruiy Whiting. Ruiy and Don used to divide the driving chores, but Ruiy lost his life at Carrell Speedway. Don continued to race until 1951, about the time when the CRA converted from roadsters to sprint cars. Chet Bingham drove the car until his untimely death at Clovis, then Rodger McCluskey took over from 1953 to 1957, when he moved back east to run with USAC. They continued to run the car until 1960 with drivers like Colby Scroggin, Hal Logan, Red Amick, Bruce Jacobi, Ray Douglas and Chuck Hulse, each taking a turn in the seat. Something unique about the RobinsonZabel sprinter, was that when many of the teams were going to Chevy or Offy power, they installed a DeSoto hemi engine to replace the old flathead. Don wanted to acknowledge Bob Milliken, who functioned as the chief gofer over the years on the racecar.\n\nDon says his heroes as racers were Wilbur Shaw, Louie Meyer, Ted Horn, Rex Mays, Jimmy Bryan and Jud Larson. He also named Lou Moore, longtime mechanic and car builder and Chickie Hiroshima, an engine builder, who specialized in Offies. Favorite tracks named were Gilmore, the mile dirt tracks at San Jose, Sacramento, Phoenix and Milwaukee and Winchester when it was an oiled dirt track.\n\nDon applauds much of the modern safety equipment, which has reduced the injury and loss of drivers in recent years. He bemoans the fact that nearly everyone runs the same engines now, not nearly the variety of years gone by. Also, nobody builds their own chassis anymore. All the parts and pieces come from a speed shop, not designed and fabricated by the individual racers or at least picked up at the local junk yard.\n\nDon has retired from his shop, but still works on projects at his Tujunga home, where he resides with his wife of 49 years, Barbara. His current project is an early fifties Ford pickup.\n\nJohn Smith was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa and later moved to the greater Chicago area. He recalls going to the 24th Field Artillery Armory prior to World War II and watching midgets race on the indoor track, with drivers like Wally Zale, Shorty Sorenson, Harry McQuinn and Duke Nalon. He also went to Hammond Speedway in Hammond, Indiana, where he saw the AAA big cars and name drivers; Bill Holland, Lucky Teeter, Paul Russo and Joie Chitwood. As a youngster, he commuted by streetcar to area tracks, such as; Raceway Park in Blue Island, Illinois, Riverview Speedway in Chicago and Roby Speedway in Roby Indiana. Regular competitors were Tony Bettenhausen, Ronnie Householder, Emil Andres and Myron Fohr. Another driver he saw in the mid-west was Lou Scally, who later organized the UARA. An item of interest is that while going to 87th St. Speedway, which was at a softball park called Gill Stadium, the announcer was some up and comer named Chick Hearn, who announced both the races and softball games. From 1947 to 1952, John also made it to Indy each year for the 500. As a kid in Chicago, John lived near Warren Erwin, who built his own midget, #A3, after going to the track and observing other cars and then going home and welding up parts and pieces. The car raced at Raceway Park and was recently featured in an article titled, The Ugliest Racecars.\n\nAfter the war, John worked briefly with Bill Namovice on a V8-60 midget driven by Bob Myers and Larry Johnson. Later, while living in Phoenix, he worked for Bob Hornbrook, who was the Arizona State Midget Champion and helped out on the racecar. Car builder Myron Stevens was based in Tolleson, Arizona and John witnessed the assembly of the Bell Auto Parts Midget for Roy Richter. Moving to Los Angeles in 1955, John started attending races at Gardena Stadium, watching the Jalopies, with drivers such as the Lopicolo brothers, Termite Snyder and Billy Wilkerson.\n\nJohn eventually got involved with the CRA sprinters at Ascot. He helped out on a car driven by Jim Klemovich. Here he met Walt Reif who worked for Louie Senter at Ansen Automotive. Walt and Ace Noffsinger maintained a car owned by Bill Gatta. After sitting in the stands with me at Ascot, Johns neighbor Dick Cleveland turned up with a sprint car in his driveway and soon John was back in the pits, with drivers, Todd Noffsinger, Duane Feduska and Roger Newell. He later worked with John and Edie Grubb and driver Bob Meli. His alliance with Meli was to last for ten years as they campaigned TQs, Midgets, Sprints and Silver Crown cars. John went on four of the CRA Midwest Tours, plus several forays into the mid-west with Meli and the Senter Silver Crown car.\n\nJohn worked for a number of years as a truck mechanic for Navajo Freight Lines. He has resided in Whittier with his wife Anna for many years. Away from the job, he spent much time devoted to his beloved auto racing. He names Tony Bettenhausen and Teddy Duncan, both from the Chicago area, as his driving heroes. His favorite tracks are Ascot Park in Gardena, CA and Raceway Park in Blue Island, IL, when it was dirt.\n\nJim Van Natta was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota and moved out west as a youngster. Moving to Fresno in the thirties, he first saw the midgets race at the Italian Amusement Park, later known as Airport Speedway and even later, as Kearney Bowl. In the early years, before the Offies became so dominant, many of the hot-dogs ran a Drake midget engine. This was a two-cylinder Harley (en-block) with water-cooled heads and cylinders, which was mounted crosswise in the chassis. Other engine combinations, like a straight eight cut in half and other push-rod or flathead varieties, which ran on the U.R.A. Red circuit. Some of the regular competitors were Perry Grimm, Gib Lilly, Johnnie Parsons, Andy Linden, Jerry Piper, Bill & Eli Vukovich, Duane Carter, Norman Gertz, Bill Zaring and Billy Cantrell.\n\nAbout 1947, Jim met Bill Vukovich, who would run Bakersfield on Saturday night, then return home to prepare the racecar to run at Fresno on Sunday night. Jim started going by Vukys house on Sunday mornings. He would ask the somewhat reticent Vuky how he had done at Bakersfield. There would be a few grunts and then Jim would just say goodbye and leave. After going through this routine for some time, Vuky asked him if he would like to go for coffee. They did and this started a relationship, which lasted until Indy in 1955. Jim started to go with Vuky to races. It was Vukovich who first introduced Jim to Len Faas Sr. and started Jims longtime friendship with the Faas family. Len Sr. stopped by Vukys place in Fresno on the way to a race at Bay Meadows. Faas was alone, so Vukovich asked if Jim would ride with him and keep him company. In 1952, the Agajanian driver, Troy Ruttman had been injured in a sprint car crash, so Aggie asked Vukovich to substitute in the #98 Dirt Champ car. Jim traveled with Vuky to Denver, where he set fast time and won the hundred-miler.\n\nJim related a couple of interesting races he attended over the years. First, in 1939, he was living at Project City, near Redding, California. A couple of friends had acquired an old Chevy. They stripped it down and replaced the stock Chevy head with a three port Oldsmobile head, Grant rods and a down draft Chrysler carburetor. They were going to the nearby Anderson Fairgrounds half-mile horse track to race. A broken piston ended the day for this racer, but the driver was able to secure a ride in a Chrysler, which was stripped down to a seat, cowl and steering. As the race got underway, it was so dusty that you couldnt see the front stretch. They lost track of their driver and eventually found him, as he had exited the track and ended up out in the parking lot. The second recollection was in the early sixties near San Juan Bautista in central California. He said he noticed a small flyer tacked to a fence post advertising a race. It turned out to be on some farmers land in a little dry wash, which Jim related, was a taco shell shape. The cars would go down the front straight, around the corner and up the bank to the peak of the taco shell, then diamond down and around the other corner. Spectators lined up their cars at a safe distance or just stood around the perimeter of the track.\n\nJim says that one of the most exciting races he ever witnessed was at Ascot in the early sixties. It was a USAC sprint car show. Hurtibise was in the #56 Barnett car, with Foyt in the #1 Bowes car and Parnelli in the Fike car. Herk was quick and started up front. He went hard into turn one, got into the marbles and saw his pursuers go by running a little lower. Herk continued to run high up to the wall with about one-foot of dirt against the wall. He ran high in turns one and two and a little lower in three and four. He kept closing the gap with Foyt and Jones, eventually passing them on the top in turn one and going on to win.\n\nJim was transferred to the Bay area in 1963 and soon started to attend races at the old high banked paved track at the San Jose Fairgrounds. The modifieds were king at that time and he saw many close dices between the likes of Marshall Sargent, Al Pombo, Howard Kaeding and Clyde Palmer.\n\nJim moved to southern California in 1974 and started attending races at Ascot. Jim used to shoot a lot of photos and make copies to give to the drivers. When Cary Faas started racing, Jim stopped by and related that long ago ride to Bay Meadows. Soon Jim met Carys mom and dad and they have been close friends ever since.\n\nJim says his only driving experience, was some hot laps in the famous Vukovich #45 midget at the old Madera track in the early fifties. He says his favorite tracks are the old high-banked paved track at San Jose, Ascot, Manzanita and now Perris. He names Bill Vukovich, Jim Hurtibise, Rodger McCluskey and Bill Vukovich Jr as his driving heroes.\n\nJim currently resides in Fullerton with his wife, Doris and has just returned to racing after going through a triple bypass heart surgery. In real life, he spent 25 years as the Western Regional Service Manager for Wayne Gas Pumps, hydraulic lifts and other service station equipment.\n\nI cant express the pleasure I have experienced in spending time over the years talking with these three gentlemen. They have enjoyed racing for so many years and have had the opportunity to watch some of the greatest drivers ever on the track. If you can spend a little while with any of these folks, they can enlighten you with some great stories about some of the old tracks of yore and some of the bravest souls ever to strap into a race car. I am indeed grateful to them for sharing their time with me."
