Here he wins the 500-miler at Ontario Motor Speedway on September 5, 1971, averaging 152.345 mph. From SEVENTIES CHAMPIONSHIP REVOLUTION: American Racing Championships, by Dick Wallen. (Wallen/Torres Photo) a #2249 - No matter the date, whether dirt or asphalt, indoors or outdoors - he's still the People's Champ. Promoter Tony Barhorst congratulates Dave Darland for winning the Rumble Series event at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum on New Year's Eve 2009/2010. (Mike Feltenberger Photo) a #2248 - It was Martinsville, VA, the start of the Dogwood 500 in March 1979. The top four starters were George Kent, Richie Evans, Ronnie Bouchard, and Mark Newton. Kent took it in the Cal Smales #41. (Mike McClelland Photo) a #2247 - Here's an interesting shot from days of yore at the Seekonk, MA, Speedway. The facility was built in 1947 for the Midgets, but within a couple of seasons that era was gone with the wind. In came the more raucous jalopies and back came the fans. he photographer is unknown, but someone along the way identified the three drivers in front as Larry Antonellis, Tony Spinolza, and Leo Cleary. Antonellis went on to become a leading \"non-Ford\" runner and later a top Modified competitor at Norwood Arena, just outside Boston. Known appropriately as \"the Lion,\" Leo Cleary was at the outset of a long and distinguished Modified and Late Model career, ending up as one of the most noteworthy inductees in the New England Auto Racing Hall of Fame. (Coastal 181 Collection) A #2246 - This was a problem in the 1960s in many tracks across the country. As the Class B - or jalopy racers - had progressed beyond straight-axle coupes and coaches to the heavier, knee-action (A-frame) cars, the additional weight caused many a right-front wheel to break off on the turns and go sailing. It was obviously an extremely dangerous situation. At some of the tracks we frequented in the Northeast, promoters began to insist that the wheels be painted white so at least folks outside the track could see them coming. Obviously a real solution was needed, and that's when wide-five \"safety hubs\" were quite sensibly allowed to be installed on the right-front corner. From FAST MEMORIES: Springfield Speedway 1947-1987, by Joyce Standridge and Terry Young. (Allen Horcher Photo) a #2245 - So many cool cars were wasted back during the Demo Derby era. A lot of folks just couldn't stomach them, and I was one of them. It seemed that there was ample crashing in the jalopy races. (Archie Banks Photo) A #2244 - \"After a 1984 racing accident left his son a paraplegic, Ron Hughes Sr. rigged the family Midget with hand controls. Ron Jr.'s career included five Texas Outlaw championships, three after the accident. Among the estimated 100 feature wins was this 1989 night that found the Hughes men in Belle Clair's Victory Lane. Tragically, Ron Jr. was killed the following March in a Devil's Bowl wreck.\" From DID YOU SEE THAT: Unforgettable Moments in Midwest Open-Wheel Racing, by Joyce Standridge. (Allen Horcher Photo) A #2243 - It seems so distant now, but it wasn't so long ago. From 1995-1998, the infamous half-mile \"circle\" in Flemington, NJ, (shuttered in 2002) ran four popular Craftsman Truck Series events. Ron Hornaday Jr. was the alpha dog, winning two of them. (Photo by Our Man from Amsterdam, Dave Dalesandro) a #2242 - All in the family. Michigan's Ron Keselowski was a Winston Cup driver from 1970 to 1974. He raced 14,167 miles, gathering up two top-fives and 11 top-tens, pulling in a grand total of $62,790. His nephew, Brad, is highly visible today, but in an unimaginably different racing economy. He's 2012 Cup Champion, drives full-time for Penske and has 27 career scores, including the Brickyard 400 and Southern 500 last summer. (C.R. Racing Memories Collection) A #2241 - There was a lot of profiling going on in the pits at the old Riverside Raceway in Southern California. Two luminaries at the Los Angeles Grand Prix in 1963 were race queen June Wilkerson and racer Pedro Rodriguez. Both were impressive - Pedro ended up third behind Dave MacDonald and Roger Penske. From RIVERSIDE RACEWAY: Palace of Speed, by Dick Wallen. (Lester Nehamkin Photo) a #2240 - Rico Abreu scores at the USAC/CRA 2014 Vermeil Classic for Sprint Cars in 2014. That gave him six career wins at his home track, Calistoga Speedway, the mighty half-mile at the Napa County Fairgrounds. He also set the Midget track record there that year at 20.159. From Guide to Northern & Central California Raceways, by Saroyan Humphrey. (Saroyan Humphrey Photo) a #2239 - Dick Berggren's note and Photo of the Day from Florida:\n\nLast Friday night there were 100 Modifieds at Volusia. 100 cars in the same division! So, they ran five features of 15 laps each. No time trials, no heats, minimal warm-ups but five winners. 31 Sprint Cars ran green to checker with lots of passing. They announced it was the biggest Volusia crowd ever for a WoO race night, and I believe it. The police blocked the track parking lot entrance because all parking was used up. Fans parked in a vacant lot across the street and on the side of the road for a long distance. Last night showed that there remain pockets of great success in dirt track racing. Unfortunately, the fresh cut french fry stand is no more, replaced by grandstands.\n\nAnd here is Dick's Photo of the Day caption:\n\nGUILTY: Ask 77-year-old Buzzie Reutimann about the tire marks on his car and ask 63 year-old Ken Schrader about the same thing and you'll get two different answers:\n\nSaid Reutimann, \"That Schrader just drove into me. We were racing hard like it was $5,000 to win or something and he just hit me.\"\n\nAccording to Schrader, \"Buzzie just slid up into me. You know what he said? He said he picked up an aero push. On a little dirt track with these Modifieds? Aero push?\"\n\nThe conversations were all in good fun and enjoyed by both drivers as you can tell by the smile on Buzzie's face. Not so incidentally, Reutimann won the 2018 UMP Modified Championship for the Southeast region last year, winning six on the way to that trophy. a a #2237 - Back in the '50s at the old Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix, Jalopy drivers needed to clean up a bit and wear white pants. Laverne Doyle, pictured above, ran her husband Avery's car one night, got in a tangle, and pounded the wall. She disembarked stunned and fell in the mud. It is said that others had to help her back up. It is also said that Avery had, in fact, run out to the incident, but was totally preoccupied in getting the car ready for his event.

Here Johnny Rutherford pits in his McLaren M-16/Offy. He was having some kind of year, winning at Ontario, Milwaukee, Pocono, and his first of three career scores at the Brickyard.

Uncharacteristically, he endured a hard flip and ended up on the trailer with injuries for the first two months of the season. It was September before he could grab his next tour win, that at Mohawk International Raceway in Hogansburg, NY. It was an inspired performance, but he admitted in Victory Lane that he was \"still not 100%.\" (Mike Feltenberger Photo) A A #2219 - Stafford (CT) Speedway opened for the season on April 10, 1949. That year essentially bookmarked the end of the Mighty Midgets' boom in the East. Appears as if they had a healthy crowd, but check out the ticket line and all the top coats, ties and suits, dresses, hats, and high heels. It looked pretty up-town. Twenty-three years later, on April 16, 1972, Dick Berggren, Bruce Cohen, and I promoted the Stafford opener with an event called the Spring Sizzler. How different the ticket line looked then. It was blue jeans, boots, and Purolater jackets. And the featured class was the Mighty Modifieds. (Photos from John DaDalt, RA Silvia Collection) A #2218 - It was the heyday of the mighty Midgets - Hinchliffe (NJ) Stadium on June 9, 1946.

Teddy was piloting this Clyde Booth rocket ship and pulled off an amazing win over the best of ISMA that night. The Airborne track was perfect for these cars.

Among them is the ever-zany former USAC National Midget Champ, Kevin Olson. KO writes in his book CAGES ARE FOR MONKEYS, \"A few Januarys back I went to [promoter] Emmett Hahn and asked if it would be all right to drive in my open-face helmet, dressed in a tee shirt with a pack of cigarettes rolled up in the sleeve. He scratched his head a few times and finally said 'Okay, but be careful.' I ran the heat and led all the way almost to the end. I honestly considered it an honor for me, and one done as tribute to those great racers of yesterday who faced a real possibility that they would be seriously hurt or killed every time they climbed into a cockpit. Not lots of money back then, but lots of heart. I do have to admit, though, that Emmett turned me down the next year when I told him cages are for monkeys and asked if I could run without one. He said emphatically that his wife would kill him if he let me do it.\" So, what do you think KO could be up to this year? (KO Collection) a #2214 - On top of their game and on top of the mile.

CD climbed into Modifieds in the late 1960s and went through a gritty period during which he picked up the nickname \"Crash and Destroy.\" Then he started to try Reading and some of the other NJ/PA facilities to tune his skills - and what a show he put on. The mid-Atlantic railbirds report that whenever this guy from New York came down the straightaway, everyone in the infield would step back 50 feet That may be, but when CD came back north, he was a new type of performer - still on the gas for sure, but now a consistent winner, earning the new handle \"Super CD.\" (Photo by Our Man from Amsterdam, Dave Dalesandro) A #2211 - \"This photo is at the Flat Rock Speedway, MI, from 1956.

Check. Loose-fitting trousers. Check. Bow tie. Check. That would have been Mike Hawthorn's travel and racing kit in the 1950s on his way to becoming Britain's first World Champion. Any movie about Mike would be a tragi/comedy with a captivating, dashing character in the main role. He won the title in 1958, but the death of Peter Collins ended his love affair with the sport, and that, along with a serious illness, led him to retire aged just 29.

(Russell Fleetwood Collection) A #2193 - \"'Hot Rod\" Wheeler was quite the Late Model competitor at places like Wisconsin International Raceway from the '80s and '90s into the 2000s. He was fully comfortable with his stature as a villain. \"You've got to have somebody there to fill the void. I wasn't there to make friends. Race cars are made for racing. We're here to put on a show. I was there to win. If you want to just go ride around, go to Highway 41. I really didn't care. I didn't have many friends. I pitted next to Mark Schroeder for years, so I mean I talked to him and all. But that was about it. I even got into him a few times. I never really did have any friends there. My dad always taught me to be aggressive. That's how I drove. I told people 'the beauty show is done after the first race. Let's get on it. The car shows are done.' These days it seems everybody wants to be buddies with everyone else. They want to go to the bar and drink with them afterwards. I wasn't big on socializing with anybody. I always minded my own business.''' Quote and Photo from WISCONSIN INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY - Where the Big Ones Run, by Joe Verdegan.

A #2190 - \"Tragedy visited New York National at the 1968 AHRA Summer Nationals when the Wild Thing VW pickup wheel-stander rolled up to the line. Although accounts of this incident vary, most present that day concur that the Long Islander Richard Sembler was driving Wild Thing for owner 'Lead-foot Charlie' Holms. As Sembler two-wheeled it down track, something went awry. Aware that Sembler could only see the sky, track official Truman Nichols ran out to warn Sembler but was knocked skyward by Wild Thing, which then spun at least once under full throttle and accelerated backward toward the starting line, leading with its freshly sharpened (and lowered) tailgate. The truck sliced through a guardrail, then the crowd of racers, track personnel, and fans at the starting line, as 12,000 grandstand-bound spectators witnessed the carnage. Miraculously only 12 people suffered serious injury (including amputated limbs).

(Photo by Ted Pappacena, courtesy of Drag Racing Imagery Collection) A #2189 - It was May 22, 1988, a very painful day for Bob \"Barefoot\" McCreadie. He is shown collapsing in the weeds and had no memory of climbing out of the car on his own. \"I clipped the guardrail in turn two (at Weedsport, NY, Speedway) and it broke a bolt in the steering linkage. When I hit the throttle, I didn't have steering and I flew off the back chute full bore. I broke three vertebrae in my thoracic spine. All I can remember about it is that it seemed I couldn't breathe, like I couldn't get air. I was hospitalized for surgery for two weeks and couldn't race all summer. Worried fans took up collections and sent me checks totaling $10,000. The fans took care of my family for a year. After my back healed, it took me another year just to get back to where I was before. So the way I figured it, I lost two years to that injury. I didn't start racing until I was 21 and I didn't get going on the DIRT circuit until I was in my thirties. So two lost years in the prime of my career was tough. My mother Betty was at Weedsport the night when I broke my back; it scared her half to death. That was the last time she ever saw me race.\" From BAREFOOT: The Autobiography of Bob McCreadie as told to Andy Fusco. (Bill Moore Sr. Photo) a #2188 - That was Gary Patterson winning another in a Super at West Capital (CA) Speedway in August 1965. He was actually looking reasonably spiffy at the time, surely a far cry from his appearance a decade later. By that time he was full-time on the road with Sprinters and Midgets, had obtained his mail-order divinity degree from the Universal Life Church, developed a look at the fuzzy interface of hippie and ferocious, and announced, racing in Australia and New Zealand, that he would henceforth be known as \"the Great GP\".

Because it's in the 'critical moments' that people forget who they are and it's their animal instinct that takes over. That's when they will start to make mistakes. And if they expect you to act in some way...or if they think you're stronger than them, for some reason or another, they become weaker. So all the psychological things like that have a huge effect on important races. Like I said, the only reason I won the Indy 500 [in 1995] is because I bugged Scott Goodyear on the two laps behind the pace car. That's the only way I could win the race, and it worked. It's like that in every sport; in sports, we're animals. It's true - the difference is [that] we are aware of what our actions can bring. That's different from the rest of the animals, but the more pressure you have, that's when your animal instinct come out. We're all predators.

That's because it is from a 2014 reprint (re-scan) of a milestone book TIMBER ON THE MOON: The Curtis Turner Story, written by Turner's pal, Dr. D. L. Morris in 1966. Most every racing aficionado has heard tales of Turner's racy lifestyle and aggressive wheelmanship in stock cars. He surely seemed to be charmed to live through it all - even this nasty crash at Indianapolis in 1963. Turner was driving a radical entry built by his buddy Smokey Yunick and esteemed car builder Luigi Lesovksy, called the Python Roadster and the Fiberglass Special. Turner was quick to get it up to speed in practice, but going into turn three, he spun in oil from a Novi in front of him that had blown up. He hit the wall at 150 mph, ending his open-wheel career as quickly as it began. It looked very serious. The car was completely trashed, but after just four hours in the hospital, Turner was off on his merry way. His \"charm\" did run out, though, seven years later.

On that day the track held a Ladies Challenge Race to raise money for several different charities - and it did just that with over $30,000.

She's the niece of late Cup star Ron Bouchard and daughter of Ronnie's sister JoAnn and Bob Bergeron, who was Ronnie's crew chief. Courtney, a champion equestrian rider and instructor, had never raced a car before. It must have been in the genes. Starting 11th, she went right to the upstairs and came marching right through the pack, looking like a seasoned pro.

Thank goodness for them because, were they not there, the pits would look pretty lonesome. Case in point is Pennsylvania's Talan Carter, an 11-year-old Quarter Midget hot shot. Talan drives a white car with a slanted red #1, a sight that makes area old-timers smile. It's a tribute car to Harold Cope's mighty Modifieds of the 1960s that were wheeled to glory by Talan's great-grandfather, Rags Carter. Rags' son Alan became a Modified racer at Reading before it closed, and Alan's son Tim was a fine Slingshot and Modified driver, a winner at Moc-a-Tek. And along came Talan. His granddad, Alan, says, \"We make him play baseball in the summer to make sure he has interaction with other kids. But we can't get him into anything like football or basketball. All he thinks about is racing. We really had no choice. We just went and sold all his Quarter Midget stuff and bought him a Slingshot for next year.\" (Carter Family Collection) a A #2159 - \"Italian Trophy Race award presentation (at Legion Ascot, California, Speedway) to winner Al Gordon, 1933.

Will Cagle and I got together, and I ended up spinning into a dirt pile that was protecting a light pole. The right front suspension of my car ended up over where the left-front belonged, and the right rear wheel, a big 17-incher, was packed with dirt. The driver was in tough shape, too. My helmet flew off in the impact and bounced out onto the race track. Bill Sanchelli went running over toward the wreck to check on me, and, when he saw that helmet, he was afraid my head was still in it...You don't take a hit like that without sustaining a concussion, and I did.

There were so many crock pots that there was justifiable concern about how many the electrical circuit could handle.

During the WW I, however, auto-racing activity was sharply curtailed, and despite the enormous throng in the grandstands for this event, by the autumn of 1919, the track was out of business.

He picked up the car just three days before the show, put in a roll cage, and had little time for other modification. With its 198HP delivered through a tight gear ratio, the #3 was the berries off the turns, and Buchanan was fastest in the time trials, no contest. But in the race itself, he struggled with the car's inappropriate steering and suspension. Buchanan loved the high groove, but had trouble negotiating it, and he bounced the car off the wall a couple of times. Still leading on lap 70, he hit it again, this time breaking a rear axle and going for a sky ride. The detachable top was dispatched - and so was Buchanan. He went right to the hospital.

He waltzed to victory, his first time in Maine, at a star-studded Oxford 250. He kept right on going, and it must have felt like he was nearing the Arctic Circle. He crossed the border into Ontario and won the Canadian Short Track Nationals for $50,000 at Jukasa Motor Speedway, formerly known as Cayuga Speedway.

Recently Bob was up at the old Air Force base in Loring, ME, raring to go, but when he was pushed up to the starting line, there was an electrical problem with the starter. It took a bit of running around to get it fired, much to the dismay of the officials who wanted to keep the show going. Finally Bob got everything squared away. Sort of. Off he went and reaching his mark at 189mph, he pulled the parachute release. Nothing happened. He could feel no backward lurch whatsoever. That's when he remembered that in his haste, he had forgotten to pull the release pin before taking off. \"The end of that runway sure was coming up fast,\" he says, \"and I stomped on those brakes - all two wheels of them - as hard as I could, but it didn't do much good.\" As he approached the long curve built for B-52s at the end of the strip, he took a breath and attempted to turn. It wasn't pretty, but he was finally able to come to a stop. An official ran up to him and said, \"My God, I have never seen a car come in there so fast.\" Bob replied, \"Me neither.

He called to say that he's had a great summer, running near the lead in Badger points. But then, there was an incident (can you imagine with Kevin Olson?). You see, the 67-year-old was riding his motorcycle with a somewhat aggressive approach when he came up upon a construction site. There was little chance for avoidance, and as he dove for the shoulder, the flipping began. The bike landed on top of him, and the construction guys, quite impressed, came running over. They lifted off the bike, telling him not to move and they would call an ambulance. \"None of that,\" thought Kevin. \"If I go to the hospital, they might tell me I couldn't race for a while.\" So, when they weren't looking, he righted the bike, climbed on and rode away. The only problem was that he was really hurting. He admits he \"slumped down in the saddle like an Indian in an old-time Western riding away with an arrow in his back.\" He then came to a stop light, and, lo and behold, the ambulance was coming the other way, siren blaring, lights flashing. KO sat up in the stirrups like Hop-a-Long Cassidy until it went by so the attendants would not realize he was the accident victim. He will admit that he has lost a couple of spots in the point chase because after about eight laps the pain in his chest (from broken ribs) and lungs became unbearable, but you can tell he's feeling much better.He says he has enough stories that perhaps we should do a follow-up to CAGES ARE FOR MONKEYS, which we published with him a couple of seasons back.

Upon arrival, however, he was summarily dismissed by the tech inspectors. For some reason, they decided that on that particular date the mounting of the seat in the sedan was not allowable. Van Horn was unimpressed and rushed to the nearest phone both. He called the Valley and said he was on his way and urged them to allow him a late chance to qualify. Off he went, God knows how fast, up the 300-mile trek north. He arrived late, but was able to squeak out a spot, as the 100-plus car field was being whittled down to 44 starters. The largest crowd in the history of the track watched as first Toby Tobias and then Jackie Evans in the Lux #77 led and broke, while Van Horn strong-armed his way through traffic.

I don't think any of them had lost a tenth of a second from those glorious days in the 1970s and '80s when they so frequently waged motor wars war in their Late Models around the Northeast. Needless to say, their stories were on the outrageous side of hilarious. A typical one went down the last day of racing at Vermont's Catamount Stadium. Apparently Dave and Beaver were going at it a bit in warmup, and Beaver rode over Dave's left front, destroying the oil tank and then launching into a frightening series of flips. Beaver recalled that eerie, seemingly endless silence as the car spiraled through the air between bounces off the ground. It landed upside down. Dave Moody who was on the PA thought it had to be a fatal - what in the world would he tell the crowd?! And it sure looked like one. Everyone stared at the steam and smoke from the wreck, and Beaver did simply did not appear. Finally Dion ran over worried that he might have been at fault, and Beaver was very much with the program. He couldn't get out because there was oil all over the place below him, and, if he undid his seat belts, he would land in it and get covered. \"Help me out,\" he hollered. \"I've got a backup car in the pits and I can't get oil all over my fire suit!\" They did, and Beaver ended finishing up third in the feature. There were no hard feelings. One of Beaver's crew guys raced to their garage and brought back a new oil tank for Dion. He ended up with a good finish, too.

It would be quite a trip. At that first 100-mile Midget race at V.F.W. Motor Speedway in Detroit, there were many bumps and bruises, and Richter retired from driving at the end of the season. History would say that was a good idea: He emerged a titan in the performance industry, running a legendary speed shop and creating such products as the Bell Helmet and the Cragar equipment line.

He has written books on all sorts of topics, taught school, taken care of folks in need, and has seemingly built an arena full of very cool things over the years. Here's his idea of what to do with fuel drums: \"Enclosed is a photo of the Barrel Car. Built the way we built hot rods in the late fifties and early sixties. No one had any money, there weren't many accessory parts to buy, so everything was built with what you had. The car is powered with a 2300cc Pinto engine, the frame fabricated from 2x3 tubing. Fifty-five-gallon drums were used for the body (four for the main body and one for the nose). Building with the drums was certainly a learning process. The rear, my version of a 1950s Calabasses shifter rear (popular on the West Coast in the day). Muffler is a home-made glass pack. Steering wheel fashioned from a 15-inch circular saw blade (popular in rods and race cars of the day).\" (Photo and quote from Walt Scadden) a a #2085 - In the late 1970s, \"Fast Eddie\" Delmolino was a bright star at Lebanon Valley (NY) Speedway.

(Hertha Beberwyck Collection) A #2084 - Dick Berggren, guiding force behind the very cool North East Motorsports Museum in Loudon, NH, got started with a wiping cloth in Connecticut in the 1950s. It was in Billy Boudrieau's garage that housed the mighty #$ Modified driven by Moe Gherzi. Bergie recalls, \"My job was keeping that brass radiator clean and shiny. I don't think the car had a roll cage, just a roll bar, and there's no shoulder harness. Four carburetors and I'm not sure what Billy was thinking with the tubes atop them, but, with their air intake so close to the hood, they probably stole some power rather than delivering. The red/white/black paint job made the car a real looker. And I liked Gherzi's style. Note the colorful shirt. For a while, he wore Bermuda shorts when he drove.\" (Photo, North East Motor Sports Museum) a A #2082 - In August 1965, Wally Dallenbach buckled into Mel Nelson's Kurtis Offy for his USAC Indy Car debut at Langhorne. He had an oil leak from lap one, covering him with blistering burns, but he soldiered on for an impressive 13th-place finish. \"About five of us girls went to the race together,\" Peppy [Dallenbach's wife] recalls. \"We weren't allowed in the pits, of course, so it didn't really matter what time we got there. But we got there on time and as we arrived it started pouring. So we said let's go underneath the grandstand and wait. . . Well, it didn't end and finally we drove home. We had to stop at five different houses so everyone could get changed and showered. But we did it fast and drove back to the track. There was no rain and by the time we arrived, they were taking the checkered flag. So I never got to see Wally race his first Championship race but never told him for forty years.\" Quote and photo from WALLY DALLENBACH: Steward of the Sport, by Gordon Kirby.

He took everyone's breath away as he took it right up to the wall attempting to pull off a bridesmaid finish. He had to settle for third. (Photo by Dick Berggren, North East Motor Sports Museum) A #2076 - On February 21, 1969, a handsome and promising 18-year-old high school student, Troy Ruttman Jr., wrote in his journal: \"If I had three wishes that would come true, they would be 1) To be out of school, through college, and be a graduate mechanical engineer and a racing driver. 2) would be to win the Indianapolis 500-mile race at least one time before my death. 3) Would be to earn enough money racing to retire at age 30, if by age 30 I have survived long enough to fulfill my #2 wish.\" About that time, working mostly solo, he converted his dad's 1962 Indy roadster for Supermodified racing with an enormous injected Chevy. He then came to Pocono, PA, on May 4 and ran third in the first of two 50-lappers. Just a few laps into the second race, for whatever reason, the car blasted the Armco barrier wide open, ripping even the engine apart. His uncle Jim Ruttman recalled for Sports Illustrated, \"When I got to the car, Troy Jr. was slumped over with his hands on his lap. There was no agony on his face. There wasn't even a mark on him.

In 1951 he was the first rookie to sit on the pole at the Brickyard. On this date, August 26, 1951, he won at Milwaukee in the Grant Piston Special and received a great big smooch from his wife, Mary. Note her crossed fingers, a hopeful habit of hers while he raced. Everything turned cold five seasons later when he died in a USAC Stock Car at Vallejo, CA. (Photo from Speed Age Magazine by Don O'Reilly) A #2067 - Your first guess probably would not have been that this was Dick Tobias, but it most certainly was. Back in 1967, given his growing successes and his desire to attempt to get to the Brickyard, Toby decided that he should do some pavement racing. He found an aging Edgar Elder car that had been wheeled by several notables, including Troy Ruttman, Eddie Sachs, and Mario Andretti. Toby shortened it up, put in an injected 350, and towed over to Hershey Stadium Speedway, right there in \"Chocolate City,\" Pennyslvania, where Supermodifieds were running on Wednesday nights. He adjusted quickly and captured three wins by mid-seasons. The plot then thickened a little, and Toby was launched into the flip that never seemed to end, hospitalizing him with a bruised side, broken arm, and thoroughly busted car. No problem. Both were back the next week and won by half a lap. From TOBY: The Star-Crossed Story of an American Racing Family. (Tobias Family Collection) a #2066 - Frankie was cruisin'.

In the first five years of the early 1960s, the Valley presented wildly competitive open-competition events, and Frankie Schneider won six of them. (Photo by Rick Rickard) a #2065 - Some things just aren't meant to be. And experience would show that running a dirt track in the afternoon is usually one of them. It's such a delicious idea that a promoter could run Sunday afternoons - even if just in the spring and fall. But take what happened to the late Kenny Shoemaker when he carved out a track, Cairo Speedway, at the Greene County Fairgrounds in upstate New York back in 1974. Everyone was psyched when he opened on August 18, and an enormous field of cars showed up and a packed grandstand to boot. But the clay just would not cooperate. Copious watering did little other than aid in the development of crater-like holes that could swallow a street stock. We broke our rear suspension. Five weeks later, the promising facility was closed. (John Grady Photo, Coastal 181 Collection) a #2064 - What can you say about that Buzzie Reutimann? How about a \"a life well-lived\"!!!

Corey was non-stop action, so he was back winning in no time, having whatever fun he could have with his new appendage. Things like playing tunes with it or putting an explanation point on the end of a comment by reaching down and pulling out a pistol. Meanwhile, Fonda's major competitor track, Lebanon Valley, 60 miles to the east, had a similar uni-legged character/winner. He was Tom Dressell, who gave his leg in World War II. In later years it is said he would offer it up as a target in dart games at the barroom after the races. (Roger Liller Collection) A #2058 - Most always, it seems, that at oval tracks' turns one & two and turns three & four have completely different personalities. Most certainly the quirky quarter-mile pavement, Monadnock Speedway, in Winchester, NH, is a case in point. And it seems impossible that the Supermodifieds, so much a part of New England's motorized history, have never tried to conquer Monadnock, while they have run for years at neighboring New Hampshire tracks like Lee and Star Speedway (above).

Cropseyville's Steve Danish takes refreshment before disembarking from his infamous six-banger \"Danish Chevrolet.\" He had just won the Langhorne Race of Champions Elimination event, and what a feature it was. The height of what was called Fonda's most riotous night to date was when Bill Fake blew a tire and began flipping. That's when Stan Bellinger came along and piled on in, fracturing Fake's fuel tank in a ball of fire. Both men were rushed off in guarded condition. Danish's car was top shelf for the day, beautifully built and obsessively maintained. But it was hard to believe that it would soon be on its way to the lethal, high-speed mile circle in Langhorne without even the hint of side bars. There was just that sheet skin of the hollowed-out door. He finished 11th down there in Pennsylvania, while his Saturday-night Fonda nemesis, Pete Corey, stole the show. (Photo by Bergh & Neiderhauser, Danish Family Collection) a #2056 - \"Rydell, Hope, and Lang were a trio of mid-class Gassers who teamed up in 1967. For the next few years, they campaigned a G/G Anglia affectionately known as Mr. Crude. Rydell had the idea sometime after Indy 1967 to improve the breathing of their 292-ci 6-cylinder by fabricating a new cylinder head using a pair of small-block Chevy heads. Because the bore spacings were nearly identical, he could lop off the end chamber from each V-8, bolt the two modified heads onto a 6-cylinder block, and use Ni-Rod to weld it up. The rest was pretty basic machining. Intake for the new design came courtesy of a modified V-8 Crower injection. The trio was the first to use V-8 heads on a six, and the experiment really paid off. The Anglia went from low 11s elapsed times to 10.79 and held the class record for what seemed like forever. At the 1969 Springnationals, their newly formed heads won the Best Engineered Car award. Of course, imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, before long, every 6-cyclinder drag car seemed to be sporting modified V-8 heads.\" Quote and Photo from 1001 DRAG RACING FACTS: The Golden Age of Top Fuel, Funny Cars, Door Slammers and More, by Doug Boyce.
