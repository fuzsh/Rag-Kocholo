It was a highly interesting session since (father and son) Don and Rich Vogler were playfully roughhousing with each other at full speed .Cut and sliced to cruelly simple, it just happened. Entering turn three, Don Voglers handcrafted Midget inexplicably failed to turn, impacted the guardrail, began to flip, and ended up tangled well above the ground in the catch-fencing .Rescuers quickly reached the scene, Rich Vogler among the vanguard of them. He was there just long enough to grasp the gravity of the situation and he strode rigidly back across the track. My Dad wont make it. Too much impact just too much impact, he mumbled. He didnt.

A #1976 - Wally Campbell, one of the East Coasts most serious gassers, is shown at Cedar Rapids in 1953 in Frank Curtis Sprinter. Campbell, who perished at Salem the next season, was strong-armed. But his tattoos and his T-shirt, the racers fashion statement of the day, did little to protect those biceps. Typically, on the old fair tracks, drivers would return to the pits all bloody and banged up from flying dirt clods and rocks. Arnie Knepper labeled the condition Offy rash. Later, when fire suits were in vogue and the track surface looked a little racy, some guys would tape a protective layer of cardboard to their arms. There was no visible compromise to their masculinity, as few fans saw they did it. From 1976 SPRINT CAR PICTORIAL.

Ken is a 2018 inductee to the NASCAR Hall of Fame who, back in promoting days, tried mightily to keep Dave in check  with mixed results. Dave has moved to Daytona, hooked up with the Living Legends of Auto Racing, and each year, these days, he hosts what just might be the coolest, down-to-earth event of Speedweeks. It is called \"Coffee with Characters,\" and it is a free-ranging, often hilarious, discussion among racing notables from all over the country. It is scheduled for this year at 10:00am, Thursday, Feb. 15, at the LLOAR Museum, 2400 South Ridgewood Ave, South Daytona. If you need more info, give Dave a shout at (603) 320-3095 (Dion Brothers Collection) a #1973 - In the early 1970s, championship driver and prodigious car builder Don Edmunds put his well-utilized pencil to paper to design a four-wheel, independent suspension Midget. His hope was the car might really help keeping open wheel  and Indy  racing accessible to American drivers, most all of whom were trained with straight axles and torsion bars and little lap time with the new independent chassis technologies. The car was lightning fast, but was banned both in the United States and in Australia. It was, however, Don's favorite of all the cars he ever built. Recently, when Paul Weisel, the former racer and current race historian/writer from New Jersey, went to Don's home in Oregon to work on the book they were producing, Paul noticed that the car had a set of two Hoosier dirt tires on the front. Don had been unable to locate a pair of the original pavement front Firestones. Turns out that Paul used to have Firestone's Northeast racing tire warehouse, and the next time he went west, he brought the proper rubber with him. Paul writes, \"Don was all smiles. We had them mounted at a local tire dealer and the above photo is the first one taken with Don and his prized roadster on four vintage Firestones.\" From THE SAGA OF ROTTEN RED: The Don Edmunds Story, by Paul Weisel Jr. (Paul Weisel Photo) A #1972 - A lot of ex-racer Harold Brassingtons South Carolina neighbors thought he had gone a little wacky in 1949. The previous year he had gone to Indy and seen the enormous crowd; he announced at a card game that he was going to build a huge, banked and paved facility for stock car racing in Darlington. Equally unbelievably, he planned to open with a 500-miler for the Strictly Stock cars on the Monday of Labor Day weekend in 1950 that he would call the Southern 500. Seventy-five cars showed up from everywhere, and after 15 days of qualifying, still fascinated with Indy, Brassington lined the grid up three-deep, 25 rows. The fans showed up, too  so many of them that hotels filled, and Brassington opened the infield for cars and trucks so fans would have a place to sleep. Apparently most of them decided to drink instead. Some of them likely caught a few Zs during the show itself. It took the winner, Johnny Mantz, over six hours to urge his 1959 Plymouth along the 500-mile run. He was the slowest qualifier, but unlike others he used heavy-duty truck tires and just plodded along while faster entries broke or had tire failures. He averaged 75.250mph. Thats Brassington with his arm around Mantz in victory lane, and Cannonball Baker is on the right. From STOCK CAR RACING  The High Speed History of Americas Premier Motorsport, by Don Hunter and Al Pearce. (Tom Kirkland Photo) a #1971 - For many privateer (sports car) racers, the TR3 proved to be the car of choice In the 1950s, drivers frequently raced in short sleeves and the equivalent of a polo helmet; cars did not have roll bars or sometimes even seat belts. This accident at the 1956 Redwood Empire amateur race in Arcata, California, claimed the life of William Howard Pete Snell. Another amateur racer, Dr. Howard Snively, was the course physician and after seeing how poorly the existing crash helmets worked, he began serious efforts to do something about it. Within a year and with help from the SCCA, the Snell Foundation was born and by 1959 the first Snell standards were implemented. The Snell number certifications for helmets continue to this day. Quote and Photo from THE ILLUSTRATED TRIUMPH SPORTS AND RACING CARS, by G. William Krause. (Photo courtesy Revs Institute, William Hewitt Collection) A #1970 - Handsome Lance Reventlow was son of socialite Barbara Hutton and Count Kurt von Haugwitz-Harderberg-Reventlow. Relying on his resources as heir to the Woolworth fortune, he began road racing in California with his buddy James Dean. He then set up a company building Chevy-powered Scarab race cars, driven to glory by stars such as Chuck Daigh and Carroll Shelby. Married initially to Jill St. St. John and subsequently Mouseketeer Cheryl Holdridge, he died in a plane crash in 1972. Can you imagine seeing a figure like that today with a cigarette in the mouth?

(Dave Freidman Photo) A #1969 - Carroll Shelby was kissed so many times by [actress] Jan Harrison that he asked her to marry him After watching the bull fights in Tijuana, Mexico, they were married. A few months later he returned to Mexico and terminated it. He and Jan remained friends, however, for the rest of his life. Quote and Photo from CARROLL SHELBY: A Collection of my Favorite Racing Photos, by Art Evans with Carroll Shelby. A #1968 - Three B-boys from Arizona were 50s-era open wheel champions: handsome Art Bisch, bespectacled Bobby Ball, and the states Cowboy Jimmy Bryan. All of them perished pursuing the oily grail. Ball, a fabulous Midget wheelman, died 14 months after being injured at Carrel Speedway in Gardena, CA, in 1954 in a wreck in which Bryan was also hurt. Bisch won the 1956 CRA title and moved up to Championship cars. As shown above, in spring of 1958, he won Milwaukee, but he died in a 100-miler at Atlantas Lakeside Speedway on July 4, 1958. Two years later, Indy-winner Jimmy Bryan met his demise in Langhornes dreaded Puke Hollow on the very first lap of the June USAC Big Car main event. Photo from UNITED STATES AUTO CLUB: Fifty Years of Speed and Glory, by Dick Wallen A #1967 - Right after World War II, Joie Chitwood ramped up his thrill show with several traveling units. His friend and employee, Snooks Wentzel, became manager of one of them. Shown here doing an early rollover crash while Chitwood (upper left in the riding boots and pants) watched, he had become quite the stuntman himself. As reported in Chitwoods biography, Then in the evening of July 1, 1952, Snooks was doing deliberate auto rollovers in Haverhill, Massachusetts, [at the old Pines Speedway]. A crash man had quit, and the show was short-handed, so Snooks decided to do the rollover. He started with a full tank of gas. At the time, stuntmen didnt drain the gasoline out of the junkers. He rolled the car wheel-to-wheel, side-over-side, landing on all four wheels, drove back up the track, approached the narrow rollover ramp and flipped the car again. He repeated the feat as many times as he could landing in the same place every time. On the fourth roll that evening, something went wrong. The car did not roll back up onto its wheels, but came to rest on the drivers side. Then it caught fire. Before the firetruck in the infield could drive over, the car exploded. Snooks was knocked unconscious by the blast and died. Apparently the gas cap came off after the first roll. Each successive time Snooks did the rollover, more fuel was dumped in the same spot. It is not known what actually ignited the fuel. The engine may have backfired or the fan may have hit the radiator shroud causing sparks. It was obviously a frighteningly sickening spectacle. And, to make it even more horrible, a sizeable crowd in the grandstand watched, as did all the drivers scheduled for the jalopy feature. They were all lined up, buckled in their cars, on the backstretch. Photo and Quote from SAFE AT ANY SPEED: The Great Double Career of Joie Chitwood, by Jim Russell and Ed Watson.

A #1965 - In 2014, Kurt Busch took a shot at the Brickyard, driving for Andretti Autosport.  Then there was the responsibility of the three-wide start. That was the first time Id ever done something like that, where you have the responsibility of the three-wide parade and when they drop the green  thats the first time Id really been in all that dirty air. That was probably the most intense moment of the month. Everybody was telling me how it insane it was once the green flag drops. Then there was also the responsibility  with guys like Scott Dixon and Juan Pablo Montoya on my inside. It was like Whoa. Here we are and its real. Its race time and here we go. He brought it home sixth, Rookie of the Year. Photo and Quote from INDY 500 MEMORIES: An Oral History of the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, by Art Garner and Marc B. Spiegel A #1964 - It was an amazing night at Reading, PA, on the Thursday before July 4, 1969. The track held a combined URC/ARDC show to benefit the promising Bob Wilkey who had died there on May 29. The pits were awash with Sprinters. A surprise entry among them was Modified standout Dick Tobias who climbed into Russ Rupperts Hillegass. Toby had never ever been in a Sprinter, but he qualified handily in third spot for a 24-car main. Little question he knew the short route around Reading. He assumed the lead in the second turn of the first lap and romped on to the win, to wild applause. In his words, I drove the last lap exactly the way I drove the first. I couldnt be happier if I had just won Indianapolis. His good luck charm for the evening was his daughter Tina. Quote and Photo from TOBY: The Star-Crossed Story of an American Racing Family, by Lew Boyd (Tobias Family Collection) A #1963 - God bless Brock Yates. This shot was taken when he came up to do an interview with me at Bakersfield. Brock and I started on the story and worked our way through the pits, when we were told that Garlits got hurt at Lions, when he lost his foot in a horrible clutch explosion. So Brock and I jumped on a plane and went down to the LA airport and were there when Pat Garlits walked off the plane. I looked her right in the eyes and never blinked. She told me later, I knew, Linda, that if you closed your eyes, I had lost Don. I said, No, we havent lost him. And then we went to the hospital. Quote and Photo from LINDA VAUGHN: The First Lady of Motorsports, by Linda Vaughn with Rob Kinnan, Foreword by Don Garlits. A #1962 - It was a glorious scene in every way, but the flower once born forever dies. The track was an amazingly well-appointed 1/5-mile oval built specifically for the Midgets that were exploding in popularity in the mid-1930s in California. Located on Gilmore Island in LA, Gilmore Stadium held crowds of 18,500. The racing, too, brought rave reviews. It was aggressive and dangerous, but sadly dismantled in 1951. Shining stars had included Ronney Householder, Roy Russing, Curley Mills, Swede Lindskog, Gilbert Guthrie, and Billy Betteridge. In this faded photo, popular Bob Swanson out of Minneapolis was on the point. The first Turkey Night Grand Prix was held at Gilmore in 1934, and he won it. Swanson went on to be the 1935 National Midget Champion, but died qualifying for a Midget event in Toledo, Ohio, in June of 1940. In his book LET EM ALL GO, Chris Economaki stated, I believe he may be the finest racing driver America ever produced. I consider it a toss-up between Swanson and Bob Sweikert, the terrific driver from California (who died in a Sprint Car at Salem, Indiana).

A #1961 - So, were bravin the wintry blast and packin up for the Chili Bowl in Tulsa, which runs from January 8 - 13. Heres a shot from last year with Kevin Olson and Kenny Wallace redefining the art of selling books. This year should really be something: Page Jones will be with us signing GODSPEED: The Page Jones Story DVD; Rich Tobias signing the just-released TOBY; the Olson Boys, KO and Loren, with CAGES ARE FOR MONKEYS and MIDGETS OF WISCONSIN; Dave Darland; Bentley Warren ...and did someone say Vladimir Putin? The joint will be jumping! (Coastal 181 Collection) a #1960 - To an outsider like me, it was obvious that P.J. (right) and Page (Jones) had talent, skill, and their fathers drive to succeed. When the boys reached their teen years, I remember many a Saturday night at California short tracks like Ventura Speedway and Ascot Park, watching the boys as they polished their trade. The Jones boys not only shared their fathers speed, but also his temperament  especially when someone pushed them a little too far. If you were looking for trouble, the Jones boys would accommodate. Quote by Tom Madigan in PROFESSOR SPEED: Danny McKeever and the Mind Game of Going Fast, by Tom Madigan with Andrew Layton (Tom Madigan Collection) A #1959 - Indianapolis, Indiana  May 2, 1949: One of the Midwests lesser hot rod/modified drivers, Byron Horne, had another Granatelli entry, also Mercury-powered. He had so little experience that his entry smelled like a rent-a-ride. He ran out of talent in a micro-second on May 2, the first crash of the season. His claim to fame was that he nearly died, not of his injuries, but by choking on his false teeth. That resulted in an instant new rule requiring all drivers to remove dentures before taking to the track. Quote from THE ROARING ROADSTERS: The Road to Indy by Dick Wallen (Dick Wallen Collection) a #1958 - This is an open comp event at Seekonk, MA, Speedway in the early 1970s. It was a dynamic time in Modified racing, and you can detect the tension about track rules. The Seekonk entries were A-frame cars with late model bodies, engines up front, as seen in the front row. That's Eddie Hoyle on the pole in the Maverick-skinned Hendrickson Brothers entry, while Jimmy Wilkins starts on the outside. They are followed by the red and white, Red & White Moving Company Camaro, with the late Ronnie Bouchard at the helm. A little further back on the outside are three coupes, more standard flyweight Modifieds of the time with set-back motors. They came to town from nearby Connecticut. (RA Silvia Collection, Johnny Mercury Photo) a #1957 - Although there were several (pre-war roadster racing) associations in Southern California, drivers could be fickle about where they ran. They might pop back and forth between groups since the fines in CRA  supposedly $50  were too small an impediment. Some drivers used phony names, but it was hardly worth the trouble. Bob Cross had a reason of his own for racing as Bob Denny. His bosses in the telephone company didnt want their employees engaging in hazardous activities. Presumably climbing a telephone pole wasnt hazardous. Crosss girlfriends surname was Denny, so he reversed the usual process, and took her name. Hope the corporate head of Human Resources didnt notice Cross this day at Bonelli Stadium. (Photo and Quote from ROARING ROADSTERS: The Road to Indy, by Dick Wallen. (Dick Wallen Collection) a #1956 - Competition on the 1/3-mile dirt of 54-year old Grandview Speedway in Bechtelsville, PA, has always been racy  and often on the aggressive side. URC dates have been no exception. The Sprinters came to town on July 26, 2008, and Denny Garl put on quite a high-flying show. Becca Anderson and the late Kramer Williamson quite properly decided to go low. (Photo by Frank Simek, our Man with the Hat) A #1955 - It really happened. Twice  on June 15, 1958 and April 26, 1959. NASCARs Grand National stalwarts pulled into the half-miler located at the Reading, PA, Fairgrounds. Thats Lee Petty in his familiar #42 chased by Junior Johnson. Johnsons 57 Ford was a little faster the second year, and his average speed remains the NASCAR track record  53.768 mph. Photo from STRAPPED IN, June 2006. (Marburger Collection) A #1954 - It really was close  .043 of a second  and the closest finish in the history of the Brickyard. Personable, popular Canadian racer Scott Goodyear had just been beaten at the line in 1992. Photo from AUTO COURSE: THE OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE INDIANAPOLIS 500, Second Edition, by Donald Davidson and Rich Shaffer (IMS Collection) a #1953 - Victor Getzloff (Left) and his brother, Albert, were hitchhiking to the races at the track in Adams-Friendship near their rural Bancroft home in Central Wisconsin in the late 1950s. Just twelve years old at the time, the brothers were picked up by a man who was en route to the track  with a race car tugging behind a pickup truck with a not-so-sturdy tow chain. Hop in guys, said the stranger. The Getzloff boys climbed inside the race car that was being towed. They were just happy to get a lift to the races. Little did Albert know that the man picking them up, the late Richard Trickle (Right), would eventually team up with Bib Vic as his crew chief years later and form one of the most dominant teams in the history of short track racing in America. From WISCONSIN INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY: Where the Big Ones Run! by Joe Verdegan (Bob Bergeron Photo) A #1952 - Our buddy Otto Graham sure has a way of uncovering great images. How about this one he took at Super DIRT Week at Syracuse in 2011? a #1951 - I did the welding and built the exhaust system on Jack Costellas well-designed little Midget (gas class) Dragster. It had a 190-inch wheelbase and weighed only 800 pounds. It was driven by a Wilkinson 350 cubic-inch Chevy small block, with 12x5.50 Midget tires on the rear and 17x1.75 bicycle rims on the front. It was one of the first dragsters with no suspension, and the front axle was set without the extreme caster used by customary dragsters at the time. There was no transmission; it was also one of the first dragsters to use direct drive ..When Jack first appeared at Fremont (CA) Raceway with the car, race officials went into brain spasms about the frame being joined with nickel-silver-bronze and not heli-welded. I had sold Jack on the brazing concept to gain joint surface area on the .02-thin tubing he used in the fame construction. The exceptional strength and ductility of nickel-silver-bronze was not well known at the time. We worked up some sample joints of the frame tubing both heli-welded and brazed as well as a destruction test that Jack could perform with the test joint clamped in a vice mounted on the tailgate of his pickup truck and a ten foot lever. He performed this demonstration at the drag strip for the officials. It proved by a light year that the brazed joints were superior . Frank Santos was the original driver and set the top gas record in 1962 at Fremont at 196mph with an elapse time of 8.6 seconds. After Santos went into the Navy, Dave Uyehara drove the car to numerous top gas wins and actually was top eliminator over all classes on occasion. Quote and Photo from GEORGE BENSON: THE RACING YEARS - A Memoir of the Life and Times of a Racer 1952-1987, by George Benson (Rich Welch Photo, circa 1963) a #1950 - That Dave Lape out in Canajoharie, New York, sure collected a room full of trophies. Back in the late 1960s, he chased NASCAR national points with a best finish of fifth. He subsequently joined the church of the clay full-time and was a DIRT front runner for the next four and a half decades. Here he was as a teeny-bopper  full head of hair, rather full around the mid-section, and winning already. (Jessica Lape Collection) A #1949 - Wally Zale was best known as the leader of the Chicago Gang, a group of Midget drivers from the Chicago area. He won 65 Midget features in 1936, 47 in 1939. His best year was 1940 with 67 feature wins and 59 more in 1941. Zale and Frank Perone were killed when their passenger car was struck by a train in April of 1942. Quote and Photo from HARD DRIVING MEN: Images of Speed 1895-1960, by Dick Wallen.

(Dick Wallen Collection) A #1947 - Thats Lloyd Rubys name being painted on the pit-lane wall in advance of the Indy 500 in 1966. The laid-back Texan would run the event 18 times, leading the parade 18 times in five different races for a total of 526 laps. He pulled down a third in 1964, but, when he passed away at 81 in Wichita in 2009, he was remembered as the greatest driver never to win it. From HARD LUCK LLOYD: The Complete Story of Slow-Talking, Fast-Driving Texan Lloyd Ruby, by John Lingle (Indianapolis Motor Speedway Collection) a #1946 - The win [at Indy in 1951] did not come easily for Lee Wallard in spite of the fact that he led for 159 laps. The left rear shock broke, giving him a terrible pounding the exhaust pipe broke and the brakes gave out .He took the checkered flag with three minutes to spare over Nazaruk and shut the engine off in turn four, climbed up on the tail of the car, and then drifted, brakeless, down past the pits towards Victory Lane. He was in quite a bit of discomfort. Although fire-retardant uniforms were not mandatory in those days, he wore one (which had) abrasive blotches. The constant pounding of the bricks, coupled with the fact that he did not wear an undershirt, caused his skin to be severely chafed. After the victory ceremonies were over, he went to the infield hospital, where he was rubbed down with liniment. He then climbed on the scales and discovered he had lost 15 pounds since breakfast. Earlier, he had quipped that due to having carried block after block while building his own house over the last few months, he estimated he was one inch shorter than he had been in 1950. Quote and photo from AUTOCOURSE  OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE INDIANAPOLIS 500, Second Edition, by Donald Davidson and Rick Shaffer.

But he wasnt always that way. For years he was the consummate local racer in stock cars, Figure Eights, and sports cars. Then one day  by chance  he was asked to take the late Lenny Boehlers iconic Old Blue #3 Modified to a vintage event at New London-Waterford Speedbowl. He climbed in and, wheeling down the backstretch, was overcome with a kind of spiritual moment. My life changed, he recalls. He sold all his cars and launched into his selfless, preservationist period. He has pleased thousands and thousands of people. Just this weekend he parked the pleasingly industrial and un-chromed Ole Blue on its original hauler in the middle of the floor of the New England Racer Auction and Trade Show in Springfield, MA. It almost seemed to shimmer with memories.

He is shown here (in sun glasses) being loaded into the ambulance with a broken leg. When everyone had coming running over to help him, Bud yelled, \"Dont come over here messing with me! Get that car out of the pits!\" Turns out that the race was almost halfway, and Brett was able to motor on and capture the $10,000 bonus for leading. Bud, though, was hurt so badly that he had to learn to walk again during weeks of rehabilitation.

Curiously, prior to a rather big moment of the green flag, Smith shared ice cream with Rita Souther, Miss World 600. There was actually a back story to the moment. Turns out that Smith grew up in Oakboro, North Carolina, on a cotton farm in very modest circumstance. At school, he became infatuated with Eskimo Pies, which his classmates devoured at ten cents apiece, but he could never afford any. He speculated in a 1997 interview, I wanted to one day reach a goal in life where if I wanted an Eskimo Pie I could buy one. Quote from CHARLOTTE MOTOR SPEEDWAY: From Granite to Gold, by Deb Williams.

And Joe had a flaw and a big one, very poor eyesight. Without passing, Joe would not get permission to race. I took it upon myself to lobby and convince old Doc Hanna to let him take his drivers test anyway. Doc could not let Joe pass without compromising Speedway regulations. But he had wisdom and he looked at Joes racing achievements which belied his lack of reasonable vision and tried to find a solution. He came up with some special Coke-bottle glasses for Joe to wear, which enabled him to pass his vision and rookie tests with flying colors. We called them the two-and-half milers. From that day forward, when Joe showed up in Gasoline Alley early in the morning, we greeted him by singing, Jose can you see? Photo from As A Matter Of Fact, I Am Parnelli Jones, by Bones Bourcier (Hugh Baird Photo, Parnelli Jones Collection), Quote from INDY 500 MEMORIES: An Oral History of The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, by Art Garner and Marc B.

(Rick Lane Photo) A #1931 - In September of 1962, a daring, young, recently married hotrodder, biker, and jalopy racer from California climbed into a thundering J-7 jet engine-powered land-speed car at Bonneville. Glenn Leasher was intent on achieving fame and fortune  and he would go flat out so to do. After a couple of unsuccessful runs, Leasher terrified his crew by roaring by them at enormous speed far beyond the beginning of the measured mile. Their concern was justified. The car drifted off into the ungraded salt, and Leasher still did not lift or deploy the chute. Instead there was an explosion of sand, eruption of the fuel tank, and the most horrific crash ever at Bonneville. Leasher died.

A #1930 - In one of his early URA Red Circuit soirees at Fresno, California, Jimmy Bryan, the Arizona Cowboy, had heard about the Vukovich boys and wasnt really surprised when Bill rammed him with a wheel in a non-too-subtle manner. But Bill was surprised to find a wheel stuffed right back at him, and this back-and-forth banging continued throughout the feature. After the race, Jim headed for the pits and fully expected to have to fight half of Fresno, especially when he saw Vuky striding purposefully toward him, still wearing his helmet. (This was a trait of Vukys; once the evenings racing began, he rarely took his helmet off.) All Bryan saw, however, was the swiftly approaching Vukovich, and he looked around for a wrench in case he had to protect himself. The grim look on Vukys face was misleading. When he got to Bryan, he stuck out his hand. Son of a bitch, thats how I like to race! enthused Vuky. Good job, Kid! They shook hands, and Vukovich strode off.

Gene did not look all that comfortable. That became even more apparent when they went to Milwaukee, attempting to qualify on the billiard-table flat fairground mile. No matter what Gene did, the car pushed badly in the corners. Gene felt the solution was the same thing hed always done: manhandle the thing and let the rear end hang out. The harder Gene tried, the worse it got. Every time he went out, the car went slower. They didnt make the show, and Gene erupted. He picked up a bucket of water and threw it at the car. The pits were full of TV and media. The cars co-owner, Buzz Harvey, who was trying to project a professional image to attract sponsors, didnt appreciate the meltdown.

Such was the case in 1954 when Don Edmunds towed his Midget into the 5/8 mile portion of the 1.4 mile asphalt tri-oval at Marchbanks Stadium in Hanford, CA. He took time never having been on the track before. With the advice of Billy Cantrel to drive it like dirt, he slid around turn one, the rear pointed to the wall. He was fast. But in the next turn, it didnt work, and over the banking he went. He landed under car, but fortunately his head was somewhat protected by a slight hole in the ground. URA car owner Bob Sorenson is shown inspecting the busted up car. Following a night in the crash house, Edmunds was released but still beaten up.

Here he blasted under the big blocks of Brian Herb (high) and Ken Andrews (middle groove). Wrestling with his bow-spring front end all the way, Ollie sealed the deal and won the show. (NESMRA Collection) a #1895 - On October 5, 1991, Kara Hendrick, a beloved, up-and-coming driver the country was watching, died in a USAC Midget race at El Cajon (CA) Speedway. Her father, Arthur, mourning, said, People came up to me all time and asked how I could let my daughter race. I would tell them Im doing everything I can to discourage her. I would go up to her and say, Kara, Im not going to put any more money into your car, but she would go out and get it from sponsors. Shes up there right now, looking down and saying, Dad, you were right. It is dangerous, but I still want to drive. From UNITED STATED AUTO CLUB: Fifty Years of Speed and Glory, by Dick Wallen (John Mahoney Photo) A a #1893 - A very unique early dragster was Slice of Pie, campaigned by Creighton Hunter around 1955. Creightons crude-looking dragster featured a full, owner-fabricated body covering a front-mounted tri-carb flathead, positioned sideways in the chassis and running direct drive via chain to the rear axle. Creighton relied upon a jacking system to raise the rear of the car once he was at the starting line. Bringing up the RPM, he dropped the car when the flag dropped. Creighton topped 150 mph with the car in 1956 before crashing it at Santa Ana. From 1001 DRAG-RACING FACTS, by Doug Boyce. (Bob McClurg Photo) a #1892 - In 1969, Mickey Thompson towed his SOHC Ford-powered Funny Car to Detroit Dragway to test. Here the front wing appears to be set for downforce, while the rear seems to be neutral. Sometime shortly after the cars debut, the sanctioning body outlawed the wings. There was a lot to learn about mounting them. Speed and downforce could fold the wing struts back or collapse the entire assembly. Several road race cars experimented with the strut mounting system. A series of accidents, attributed to wing failure, led to rules that prohibited them or required upgrades to the mounting.

Freddie was a starring chauffeur starting back in the jalopy days in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, at venues such as Dracut, Hudson, the Medford Bowl, and West Peabody. By the mid-50s he had advanced to the cutdowns and is seen in this photo in Andy Smiths remarkable A-Framed #99 when overhead engines came on the scene. In the 1960s he was The Man at Westboro, MA, and Brookline, NH, Speedways, driving the Falconi Bros. #10 Modifieds. He is likely the biggest winner in Westboros 38-year history. (Coastal 181 Collection) a #1890 - Two true Eastern legends, great friends, fast racers, and talented car builders, the late Budd Olsen (L) and Dick Toby Tobias. Olsen started racing far and wide in 1948 and was 1951 National Auto Racing Association Sprint Car champ in 1951. Seven years later he romped to the NASCAR National Modified Championship in Busty Lusos 37 Ford coupe. He took in $600 plus a shotgun for the title. He subsequently raced locally until 1973 when he retired and built BOSS Modifieds with his son, Doug. Toby, on the other hand, began with jalopies in 1950 on local bullrings and over the next couple of decades began to race nationally, entering national USAC competition in open-wheelers. He died at Flemington, NJ, in a Sprinter in 1978. His company, Tobias Speed Equipment, is said to have sold 1,000 kits and cars, including Modifieds and Sprint Cars. (Bob Sweeten Photo, Rob Sweeten Collection) A #1889 - The sport of drag racing has changed much since Kenny Bernstein built this Funny Car in 1978. Today, the strip is one thousand feet, and Funny Cars travel it in less than 3.9 seconds, topping out at over 330 miles an hour. But the heart of just about every Funny Car and Top Fuel dragster since the mid-seventies has been the 426 Hemi. Today these 500-cubic-inch engines generate 11,000 horsepower, with 90% nitromethane forced into the engine at 110 gallons per minute. Its estimated it takes 950 horsepower just to turn the supercharger at full throttle, and the twin sparkplugs throw a spark equivalent to an arc welder to ignite the dense explosive fuel mixture. Still, open one of these $150,000 engines, and the block and cylinder head design is clearly based on the legendary 426 Hemi  huge valves, twin rocker shafts, and hemispherical combustion chambers. From THE ART OF MOPAR  Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth Muscle Cars, by Tom Glatch.

It was Flathead powered with an Ardun OHV conversion, a Hilborn injection on top, and a Harmon-Collins magneto hanging off the front. A.J. reportedly tipped the can with some interesting chemistry in the gas tank. This phase of Foyts career would come to an end mid-summer in 1956 when he left for Midwest Sprint Car wars. (Photo from DEUCE  The Original Hot Rod; 32 x32, by Mike Chase. ) a #1887 - The seemingly centuries-old group of good guys, the Ty-Rods Club, held their annual gathering in Lancaster, MA, this past Sunday. The day was as awash in sunshine as Florida was in Irma, and 100s of square tops and early muscle cars rumbled in. One of the biggest hits of the show, though, was an oval-track race car  the original pre-war Midget in original condition owned and operated by Ralph Moody of Holman and Moody fame. Believed to be one of the first tube-framed Midgets ever, the car certainly showed Moody's creativity. He even solved the overheating problem so generic to Ford V-8/60s. Note the two radiator hoses coming from the top of the radiator towards the cockpit. They go to an auxiliary water tank under the cowl.

Turn 1 was really difficult because the car I had  I didnt know it at the time  was very imbalanced aerodynamically and it was loose  the back end kept coming out. That isnt a problem when youre going 100mph on an open road race, but if youre going around Indy at 230mph, it is an issue. So I went there and I said, Hello, Im Eddie Cheever, and he looked at me with great disdain. The disdain did not bother me so I just sat there and said, Look, could you give me one good thought that I could use around here because Im really stuck  I cant seem to go any quicker. He paused and in that southern drawl of his, he said, Keep turning left. I thought, OK, wheres the punch line to the joke.

In his brand new book, Loren Olsen lists 13 venues in Wisconsin alone that held races. Some tracks such as Milwaukee State Fair Park and Racine Horlick Field ran full schedules, while some venues ran just one show. Tomah Fairground was one of them, but it didnt even get through its solo event, which was cancelled because of a bad accident and never restarted.

Marty was a sweet-tempered man, a throwback to a gentler time. For years and years an institution around the Northeast, he made rounds to garages with an over-stuffed Volkswagen bus, peddling brooms, wrenches, and all manner of bric-a-brac. He was also the brightest man I ever met. In Europe, back in World War II, he taught himself Italian, and in his nineties could still quote chapters from Dantes Inferno that he had read back then. In the 1950s and 60s he was a stock car builder for hire, who would deliver his cars and guarantee that they would win, provided his driver and his setup were used for the test. His finest work was likely the time he built the Modified with Vic Kangas that carried Ernie Gahan to the 1966 NASCAR national title. They had literally one week to complete it, while Ernie was banged up, recovering from a crash in Middletown, NY. Marty also had quite the wit. Several years ago, Parnelli Jones was at the Vintage Celebration at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. When introduced, Marty looked Parnelli up and down and said, Well, you dont look all that special to me... (Photo, Howard Towns Collection) a #1866 - Back in the 1960s, folks out on the West Coast couldnt seem to get enough of those outrageous Fuel Altereds. The epitome of the phenomenon was the Fuel Altered National Tour, which lasted for four years after its 1968 start. The cars were short and very, very fast. Mondello and Matsubaras blown 427 Chevy Fiat was the first Fuel Altered in the 7-second bracket at above 200mph. Out-of-control, guard-rail to guard-rail, Christmas-tree-destroying runs, all four wheels in the air, and trail-dragging wheelies werent the exception to the rule, they were the rule. As expected, Wild Willie Borsch ran right up front.

Most all of the Los Angeles area car clubs had been merged into S.C.T.A., the Southern California Timing Association, and this was the date of their first big meet. Three hundred cars roared across the Muroc Dry Lake that day. Apparently the oldest of the S.C.T.A. competitors was a 40-year-old school teacher. Describing the impact of that incredible day on motorsports, William Carroll wrote, It took primitive Muroc Dry Lake, at every chill dawn a barren, featureless slab, dusty at the course and dirty wherever touched, to host the beginning of what is remembered as one of the truly great communal efforts of modern youth. From WHEN THE HOT RODS RAN  May 15, 1938, by William Carroll a #1862 - She looks pretty cosmopolitan  almost like Meryl Streep, but it wasnt Meryl.

Junior Johnson of NASCAR fame was slated to drive. But after a few laps on the Indy oval he found it wasnt his cup of tea. Colby Scroggins, a rookie, was then picked to drive it. Colby was more than able to keep up with the fast runners in the turns, but had no power on the long straights. This was no mystery as the stubborn owner insisted on using a passenger car typed ignition with a wet battery, rather than the tried and proven magneto on the Offy engine. It didnt work.

One night he was pulled over by a policeman who said the two-story trailer couldnt slow down in a country mile. He demanded that Pappy take it back up to speed. The policeman would follow and then flash his lights telling Pappy when to try stopping. That they did. The lights flashed, and Pappy jammed on the brand new binders he had just installed, plus he downshifted and yanked on the emergency brake.

It was July 10, 1969 when the weary NASCAR Grand National highway men pulled in to the Thompson 300 at Thompson, CT, the 30th show of the circuit. It all looks pretty primitive  Thompson with its infamous sand banks and the NASCAR field just a little less kitted-out than today. But they were all there. Of the 31 starters, only Dick Watson, Ken Meisenhelder, and Roy Halquist were from New England. David Pearson won it with James Hylton and John Sears sharing the podium a lap down.

A surprise birthday party will be held at Albany-Saratoga Speedway in Malta, NY on June 30 to honor the unforgettable racing lensman, John Grady, on his 87th. Here's what they have to say:\n\nPhotographer John Grady from Schenectady, NY, has recorded over 50,000 stock car racing images, from the late 1950s to the 2000s. He began taking photos with Track Photographer Irv Conran at Menands Speedway, NY, in the late 1950s. Primarily, black and white photos were taken for print and press. John was one of the first to take color at night. Getting the proper light and adjusting for the film of the day was a challenge. John mastered that and started selling photos and meeting press obligations.\n\nUtica-Rome Speedway, NY, in 1961, provided John with his first position as Track Photographer where he befriended Joe Lesik, track builder and promoter. He made the weekly haul to Utica on Sunday nights to take photos and manage a photo stand. He worked there until the track was sold and Lesik built the \"new\" Albany-Saratoga Speedway in Malta, NY, in 1965. Closer to home and with the endorsement of Modified Champion Rene Charland, John became Maltas Track Photographer. John was the photographer there for 15 years. He was noted for the famous photo of then Modified champion Rene Charland, whose car caught fire in May 1966. Eddie Flemke ran into the flames and saved Rene. John often commented that it was the bravest thing he ever witnessed in racing. He went to Eddie afterwards and commented on it. Eddie said, \"He would have done the same for me\". John's response was, \"Are you sure?\"\n\nHe worked with various track owners and promoters. Larry Mendelsohn and Spectacular Promotions from Islip, NY, brought Grand National racing to Albany-Saratoga in the early 1970s. John was there from the transition from asphalt to dirt, and worked with promoter C.J. Richards during the transition. John and his wife Sondra and son Chris ran the novelty stand and photos, during this period, as well.\n\nHe was the Track Photographer at Fonda Speedway, NY, in 1979 for one year, and then it was onto Howard Commander's, Lebanon Valley Speedway. John worked at Lebanon Valley for 15 years and sold thousands of photos \"off the wall\" with no booth, just tables. He was noted for selling photo grab bags. Three photos for one dollar. With the help of announcers Dan Martin and John Stanley, he sold thousands of these to race fans, primarily kids.\n\nEventually he returned to Fonda Speedway to work with son Chris, who ran the novelty stand, selling photos old and new. He worked there with Ralph Compani and Ric Lucia for another 15 years, primarily freelance.\n\nJohn was a friend to many in the racing community. His sense of humor and story-telling from racing history made many laugh. He loved giving photos away and also making a \"few bucks\" with racing. He commented that he loved racing and never had to pay to enter a track!\n\nA NYSSCA Hall of Fame member in 2004, writer for the Daily Gazette for ten years with his weekly Stock Car Column, and photos in all racing publications are just a few of his accomplishments. As an elementary school teacher, at Niskayuna School District from 1963-1987, John was also entertaining.\n\nJohn's 87th birthday is June 30th. It will be held at Albany-Saratoga Speedway. His son Chris and Historian Bob Novak will have thousands of his photos on display at the track. Race fans are encouraged to look at photos and say hi and Happy Birthday to John, who has been struggling with dementia the past few years. With the help of Andrea Johnson, Ronnie Johnson's mom, he was able to stay home until recently. He is now in Brookdale, Dementia Care Facility, in Niskayuna, NY. John's wish was to \"get his photos out there, they are no good sitting in boxes, in the garage,\" so fans are invited to visit with John and look at so many wonderful racing shots. Photos are for sale, and all proceeds will go to the Dementia Society. a #1830 - After a few rocky years at the beginning of his career, Scotia, New Yorks C.D. Coville undertook the long weekly tow to Reading, PA, at the dawn of the 79 season. After four weeks, he apparently grew weary of the miles, but he was leading in points. Hes certainly on the gas in this shot, beneath Reading veteran Bobby Braxton (who would end up with 119 RSCA top tens). When C.D. decided to stay put in Upstate, he had become a different driver. He was now Super CD. Photo from READING FAIRGROUNDS  Modified Memories, Vince Vicari, Editor. A #1829 - Reading Stock Car Association, 1968. Could there ever be another one? (Tobias Family Collection) a #1828 - Thats Dick Tobias looking you right in the eye from the front stretch at Langhorne, PA, in 1964. Toby was especially focused when he ventured to the circular mile, as getting to Indy was always in the back of his mind. He had some great rides at the Horne, including this Sterling Lerch coupe. It was powered by a engine from a Pontiac Catalina that had been defective from the factory and was donated to the team. It was rebuilt and sent to Daytona where Smokey Yunick installed injection and dynoed it to perfect pitch. Even with this weapon, Toby was unable ever to match his fast time and second-place finish a couple of years earlier. That had been in John Regesters bug-like #6, powered by a peashooter 283 Chevy. Our book on Toby and his star-crossed family will be out in the fall. (Tobias Family Collection) a #1827 - Early on in the 1957 season, fun-loving, big loving Don Hendenberg, \"the bear who walked like a man,\" looked forward to another possible championship at his home track, Fonda, New York. But a tree got in the way of his Volkswagen bug one morning, and he died. For whatever reason, Fonda management turned down the suggestion for a benefit race. It ended up taking place far to the east. On a Sunday night a whole gaggle of upstate New York runners towed all the way to Bennington, Vermont's State Line Speedway, owned and operated by Pete Corey's uncle. The solemn 100-lap memorial was taken by Cliff Kotary, \"the Copper City Cowboy from out by Rome, near Syracuse. He drove using his left foot on the go pedal as his right foot had been temporarily rendered immobile by a gunshot wound. (Coastal 181 Collection) a #1826 - It could have easily been from 1970, but it ain't. It's last Sunday (06-11-17).

He was the 2008 New York State Stock Car Association rookie of the year and was extremely popular, as is his family, so active at Lebanon Valley Speedway for years. A week ago the track held its fifth memorial event. (Photo by our Man from Amsterdam, Dave Dalesandro) A #1824 - In Victory Lane with Fred Lorenzen and co-crew chief Jack Sullivan at the 1965 Daytona 500, Miss Teenage America seemed to be asking, What in the world just happened? So was Freddy. It all came too fast, too quick. I got into racing too early and quit too early. I was good for another five or six years. I was at my prime, but Id won about everything there was to win and I had plenty of money. I was sick with stomach ulcers, and I was tired of traveling and living out of a suitcase. Most of all the spark was gone; the candle was out; the King (Fireball Roberts) was dead. Quote and Photo from HOLMAN MOODY: The Legendary Race Team, by Tom Cotter and Al Pearce. (Don Hunter Photo) a #1823 - Accomplished Portland, Oregon, native Len Sutton had a very happy day on the Milwaukee mile on August 25, 1960, winning the 200-mile USAC Champ Car event. Everyone must have figured that the fans were going to have a happy day, too. After all, this was the time of the oft-repeated line, Im from Milwaukee where the beer comes from! The days racing program was literally saturated by advertisements for hops. This one is kind of neat, but also curious. The advertiser, Pabst, only saw fit to mention its name in microscopic print in the lower left.\n\nA #1822 - Midget racing has not been for the faint of heart over the years, as this 1950 shot of Al Pavasil at Sun Prairies Angell Park demonstrates. There is a lot of evidence about that these days at Coastal 181. We are finishing up an incredibly thorough photographic and statistical history of Midget racing in the Wisconsin, 1930s - 1961, written by Loren Olson. Long live Angell Park! (Armin Krueger photo, Greenfield Gallery Collection)\n\nA #1821 - Richard and Vanessa Jordan, the energy force behind the wonderfully revived Wiscasset (Maine) Speedway, are doing all the right things. Great shows; great crowds. Speaking of shows, popular veteran Midget driver, Paul \"Dangerous\" Scally put one on a couple of weeks ago. He was running really well in his full NEMA car, but it broke in the main. So he decided to \"go for it\" when he chugged out in his NEMA Lite  and right to the front he went. With two to go, he was praying \"nuthin' would break\" and when he pulled into Victory Lane  for his first time  \"the adrenaline carried me right up on that tire!\" Asked what this \"Dangerous\" moniker is all about, Paul laughs, explaining that he was pinned with it one night by a competitor and he decided to keep it. \"It's not all that bad to be called Dangerous\" when you are starting on the inside of a fast outside row!\" (Crystal Snape Photo) a #1820 - \"Jim Dunns Woody Gilmore-designed rear-engine Plymouth Barracuda was considered the only successful rear-engine Funny Car of its time.
