        "text": "LIFE IS BUT PRESENTATION\n\nWHEN DEATH crosses the path of Motor Racing, we will inevitably review the life that has preceded that tragic moment, that moment when, in the space of two or three heartbeats, we lose one of our fellows.\n\nWe can look at it dispassionately and say Mike Burgmann was 39 and had led a life fuller than most. He had four children of his own and took on a further two in his second marriage, had built an empire of sorts as an Accountant with an entrepreneurial flair, and had seen the world as he lived and worked in the USA for two years.\n\nCloser to our hearts, we know that he raced with the assistance of the superb preparation of Bob Stevens, inevitably giving him a better chance than most. He never beat Peter Brock.\n\nWe can look that way, but few of us will. We will instead search for his moments of despair and his moments of glory, from his upbringing at Greystanes - the son of a bricklayer - to his final few heartbeats.\n\nIf there is a word that covers the man, then it is 'achiever,' and if it were not so overly used, one would say 'quiet.' Pole vault, discus and soccer medals live in frames at his Glenhaven home, legacies of active competition in years highlighted by being Captain of Blacktown Boys High. In soccer he played on with the Wentworthville Waratahs.\n\nSomewhere in those early years he acquired or developed the phrase that would be a guiding hand in his future - \"Life Is But Presentation.\" Never did he say \"You can't do that!\" and he hated to hear anyone say \"We could have done that!\" He was a positive man.\n\nHe was the man who built the Parramatta Club, making it presentable, dynamic and successful. Then he resigned his Presidency, unwilling to bask in his success, rather seeking new goals.\n\nAnd it was during his term there that he came in contact with Motor Racing. Ivan Stibbard was to become a close friend as the ARDC negotiated rights for their members after the closing of the Clubrooms at Leichhardt. Most important to Mike was the entry into his life of Gaye Woodford, an employee of the ARDC and to become a part of him for his final five years.\n\nGaye helped hiim decide to go racing when he needed more in his life, Ivan guided them to Bob Stevens and Bob guided them through the Camaros, the Mazda and into the Commodore.\n\n\"It used to defeat me that he had no background knowledge,\" says Bob, \"But he was a brain. He absorbed everything. He could quote back spring rates and bar sizes - they were all just numbers to him.\"\n\nIt was an Escort Mike raced first, that being put aside for a Camaro, which upended itself at Oran Park after breaking a stub axle. Then the second Camaro, which became the Dreamworld car and was co-driven by Tony Longhurst, recommended to Mike by Dick Johnson and spotted as a result by Frank Gardner.\n\nThe Camaros died and an RX7 took their place, with some good placings. Strangely, Bob feels Mike was most at home in the Mazda; Gaye says he didn't like it. When Mazdas were out a Commodore seemed logical.\n\nWhat was Mike looking for as he raced these cars? \"He knew his limitations,\" says Gaye, \"he just set out to do as well as he could.\"\n\nA regular at Amaroo, where he was on the Committee and setting some high goals for the ARDC to achieve with his guidance, he put in the fastest lap ever by a Commodore during 1986. But there was more happening in his team.\n\nAlert to the problems - all of them - of running a successful car, he equipped a pantech with all that was needed. Bob Stevens takes no shortcuts and Mike was prepared to pay his way. And he picked up another young driver and eased him into the car.\n\nThe tears of Bathurst having cleared away, Mal Rose remembers Mike's advice - how to dress himself, how to conduct himself, how to feel a part of something important. They were planning for the 'Wellington 500' and Bathurst next year, with Mike grateful for Mal's competitiveness (he qualified the car at Sandown) and responding by going faster to match him.\n\nBut during this time there was nothing that was just Mike. Gaye was a part of every decision. They were an 'item,' as Bob puts it. \"When we were at the circuit there was us and there was Mike and Gaye, always together.\"\n\nIt was Gaye who convinced him to reduce the size of his business, who feared he would work himself to death. It was Gaye to whom he came after his first lap of Bathurst in the Camaro and said, \"I wanna go home!\" And again after his first laps of the wet Sandown in the Commodore.\n\nBit it was Mike who overcame these setbacks and, with Gaye's help, was a force in the field. It was Mike who was frustrated in his attempts to help the ARDC grow. It was Mike who lost his mother two months ago, who pulled six seconds off his his Bathurst time and took pride in hearing Michel Delcourt praise Mal Rose on his first trip to Bathurst. It was Mike and Gaye who wanted to see Mal be Rookie of the Year.\n\nBut it was only to his devoted wife Gaye that the flowers came, the hundreds of cards and letters, telegrams and understanding phone calls. Among them many from businessmen who'd succeeded with his help, one from James Hardie, with whom Mike was a central figure in touchy negotiations for Bathurst's future, one from Jon Davision, recalling his own tragedy.\n\nYes, we could look dispassionately, but we would miss too much. Mike knew the upheaval of a broken marriage, the feeling of success, the adrenalin-pumping exhilaration of 268kmh and the warmth of a true closeness.\n\nThen, in two or three heartbeats, it was over.\n\nRAY BELL"
