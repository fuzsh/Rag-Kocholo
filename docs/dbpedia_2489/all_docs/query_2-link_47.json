        "text": "plus ROAD RACING & MOTORCYLES\n\nV-1758UC\n\nPrice: $29.95\n\nTHE ROADSTER ERA (And Before)\n\nAT INDIANAPOLIS 1930s-1964\n\nA unique compilation of rare B&W news film footage of the Indy 500 from the 1930s-1964.\n\nOver two hours of news-making events at the Speedway, most footage never seen before. Highlights from the days of the 1930s two-man cars to the end of the roadster era in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe heroes, the cars, the wrecks, the fires, in the News of the Day.\n\nV-1738\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nThe Encore in 54  Indianapolis 1954\n\n(Bill Vukovich Winning)\n\nAll the excitement from the month of May 1954 at Indianapolis. Practice, qualifying and the race, won for the second time in a row by the great Bill Vukovich, the year before he lost his life trying for his third victory in the 500.\n\nB&W and Color, approx. 58 minutes with 5 minutes of bonus footage of cars that missed the race.\n\nV-1734\n\nPrice: $29.95\n\n1982 INDIANAPOLIS 500\n\n\"LEGENDS OF THE 500\" &\n\n\"RUN FOR THE BRICKS\"\n\nIncludes two professionally produced films: Legends of the 500 by Championship Racefilms, narrated by Paul Page for Goodyear, has the most complete qualifying and race coverage.\n\nRun For The Bricks by Car & Track Productions, narrated by George Plimpton, is told from the perspective of the Red Roof Inns #19 March Cosworth team and rookie driver, Bobby Rahal.\n\nEach film shows different footage highlighting the 1982 Indy 500 and the story of the month leading up to the spectacular classic on Memorial Day.\n\nColor. 51 min. total.\n\nV-1651\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nThe Dominant Blue Crowns\n\n- Indy 1946-1949\n\nAfter four years of war, it was uncertain that there would even be an Indianapolis 500, but three-time winner Wilbur Shaw didnt want to see the Speedway go the way of the wrecking ball, so he looked for interested buyers who would preserve the Speedway. He found such a buyer in Anton Tony Hulman Jr. It would take a miracle to get the track ready for a race in May of 1946, but amazingly Tony and Wilbur pulled it off and the 1946 500 was a success.\n\nAs most pre-war cars had been stored away, there were only a handful of new cars built for the 1946 500, one of them being the Novi. Former driver turned car owner Lou Moore liked the idea of the sleek cigar-shaped front-drive Novi, and he built two smaller versions with Offenhauser engines for 1947 and thus the Blue Crown Spark Plug Specials were born.\n\nThe Dominant Blue Crowns brings you 65 minutes of color & B&W film in DVD format with music, engine sounds and narration from the exciting post-war era of 1946 - 1949 highlighted by three wins for the Blue Crown team. There is also approx. 15 minutes of B&W BONUS footage from 1948 and 1949 which has music only (no engine sounds or narration).\n\nV-1640\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nTroy's Triumph: Indy 1952\n\nWith 83 entries (23 different chassis and nine different engines), the month of May 1952 at Indy looked to be an interesting one!\n\nDrivers Duke Nalon, Chet Miller, Jack McGrath, Sam Hanks, Duane Carter, Troy Ruttman, Bill Vukovich, Jim Rathmann, Johnnie Parsons, and Tony Bettenhausen, among other veterans and eight rookies, would fill the field.\n\nTroys Triumph brings you 57 minutes of action at Indianapolis during May 1952. Practice, qualifying and the race are all covered. Bonus footage includes cars that missed the race, as well as a visit to the Frank Kurtis shop in California.\n\nColor.\n\nV-1628\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nRACE AGAINST THE HEAT\n\n- Indianapolis 1953\n\nAll the excitement from the month of May 1953 at Indianapolis - from practice, qualifying and the race!\n\nB&W and color, approx. 59 min. with 8 min. bonus footage of cars that missed the race.\n\nV-1603\n\nPrice: $14.95\n\nBORN RACER\n\nThe story of the will to win in todays IndyCar wars.\n\nScott Dixon, Dario Franchitti, Chip Ganassi, Tony Kanaan play themselves in dramatic footage and candid interviews.\n\nDocumentary 2018, 89 min.\n\nV-1604\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nLightning Al (Indy 1970)\n\nAfter missing the Indianapolis 500 in 1969 because of a broken ankle, Al Unser was more determined than ever to do well in the 1970 event.\n\nDriving the Johnny Lightning Special, Al would dominate the race, leading 190 laps to score his first Indy victory.\n\nLightning Al documents all of the excitement during the month of May 1970 in this 57-minute DVD, including 8 minutes of bonus footage.\n\nV-1605\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nLightning Strikes Twice (Indy 1971)\n\nAfter dominating the 1970 500, Al Unser returns with an updated version of the Johnny Lightning Special and hopes of winning Indy again.\n\nHis task would be much tougher this year with the introduction of the new McLaren cars driven by Peter Revson, Denis Hulme, and Mark Donohue. Revson would qualify on the pole with Donohue in the second spot.\n\nAl, starting fifth, would battle Donohue, Revson, and his teammate, Joe Leonard, to win his second Indy 500 in a row.\n\nLightning Strikes Twice 1971 documents the events in May 1971 in this 74-minute DVD, including 18 minutes of bonus footage.\n\nV-1583\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nGODSPEED: The Story of Page Jones\n\nA feature-length documentary about Page Jones  former race car driver and son of the legendary Parnelli Jones  and his remarkable and continuing recovery from a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nThe film shows the early Page, as he stormed the Midget circuits and looked to be another Parnelli in the making.\n\nA terrible accident caused a near-fatal brain injury, from which few recover. This is the inspiring record of his  and his dedicated familys  fight to recovery, health, and contribution to brain injury research.\n\nThe documentary shows in detail his wrenching efforts to overcome and live with the results of his injury, while advocating for access to long-term rehabilitation for others with similar injuries. Page is living proof that with support, quality lives are within reach.

He was also well known for his philanthropy; Newman's Own has given more than $430 million to charities around the world.\n\nYet few know the gasoline-fueled passion that became so important in this complex, multifaceted man's makeup. Newman's deep- seated passion for racing was so intense it nearly sidelined his acting career.\n\nHis racing career spanned 35 years; Newman won four national championships as a driver and eight championships as an owner. Not bad for a guy who didn't even start racing until he was 47 years old.\n\nIncludes Special Features: Adam Carolla interviews with Mario Andretti, Patrick Dempsey, Jay Leno, Graham Rahal, and Bob Sharp; Adam Carolla restores Paul Newman's 1985 GT-1 Championship Car/Trailer.\n\nColor, 83 min.\n\nDick Wallen's Racing Classics PAGE HERE\n\nClassic Open Wheel Racing VIdeos\n\nTitles include:\n\nThunder from the Fifties\n\nV-1439\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\n1965-1967 USAC Indy Car Highlights\n\nThe rear engine revolution is here.

Crews spend hours tweaking their cars to get the speed their driver will need to qualify for the 500.\n\nFor some teams, just qualifying for the race is their winning combination but for others, only the pole position will do.\n\nThe ultimate winning combination in 1965 went to the Lotus team of Colin Chapman and their driver, two-time Formula One Champion, Jim Clark. Clarks winning combination was a rear-engine Lotus 38 powered by a Ford. This was the first rear-engine car to win the 500. His record average speed of 150.686 MPH would have sat on the pole just two years prior.\n\nWhat would the winning combination of driver and machine be to win it all in 1966?

Along with A.J. Foyt, they are the Mount Rushmore of American motorsports, and their accomplishments will never be duplicated. They thrived and survived in racings deadliest era and became household names that people still say with awe.\n\n1 hour 30 min.\n\nV-1277\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nThe Roadster's Last Triumph\n\n Indianapolis 1964 In 1961, Australian Grand Prix driver Sir Jack Brabham brought a light-weight rear engine F1 Cooper-Climax car to the Speedway. Although down on horsepower compared to the Offy- powered roadsters, Brabham used the superior corner handling of the Cooper to finish a respectable 9th place in the 500 and in the process, usher in the modern rear-engine era.With the door open, several teams developed rear-engine cars, with the most notable being the Colin Chapman-designed Ford-powered Lotus 29s of 1963 driven by Dan Gurney and Jim Clark.Clark would qualify 5th and in the race he moved up in the field to become the first rear-engine car to lead the 500, and even though he would finish 2nd to Parnelli Jones, the rear-engine car could no longer be ignored. The rear-engine car has returned with a vengeance in 1964 and the question had to be: Had the roadster gone the way of the dinosaur, or would this be its last triumph?\n\nColor, approx. 60 min. plus cars that missed the race; 8 min. of B&W Bonus footage.\n\nV-1279\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nMidget, Sprint & Champ Dirt Highlights, Vol. 2 \"Midget, Sprint & Champ Dirt Highlights Vol. 2\" spans the 1930s to the late 1970s from tracks that include Williams Grove, Hershey, Atlanta (Lakewood), Terre Haute, Indianapolis Raceway Park, Langhorne, DuQuoin, Winchester, Dayton, Cleveland, New Bremen, Syracuse and many more.\n\nB&W and Color, Approx. 1hour and 45 minutes.\n\nV-1608\n\nPrice: $24.95\n\nMidget, Sprint & Champ Dirt Car Highlights,\n\nVol 3\n\nThis DVD contains highlights from Midget, Sprint and Champ Dirt Car races from the late 1930s to the mid-60s.\n\nSee such greats as Jimmy Bryan, Parnelli Jones, Jim Hurtubise, Tommy Hinnershitz, A.J.

He came close, finishing second to Parnelli Jones, who was driving a conventional front-engine roadster.\n\nClark returned in 1964 with Chapman and the Lotus to qualify on the pole. However, his suspension collapsed while leading the race, and A.J. Foyt went on to win in his roadster.\n\nIn 1965, Clark and Chapman came back with the brand new Lotus 38. This time, Clark hoped to drive the final nail in the front-engine coffin, ending its winning reign at Indianapolis. Clark qualified in the middle of the front row and dominated the race, becoming the first driver to win in a rear-engine Indy Car. No front-engine car has won the Indy 500 since.
