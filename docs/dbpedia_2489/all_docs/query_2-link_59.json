        "text": "Waterford, CT - Adam Cantor took the lead when Nokie Fornoro ran out of gas on the last lap and went on to win the 25-lap Northeastern Midget feature Saturday night at Waterford Speedbowl. It was first win of the year and the fifth straight top-five for the Long Island driver.\n\nCantor (Cantor #7ny) thought “the race was over” when he saw Fornoro (Jarett #4), who had led since lap seven, slow in the backstretch. “”I said to myself ‘I’m going to go another lap’ because I’ve gotten myself in trouble before counting laps. You’ve got to just keep digging.”\n\nRuss Stoehr (Angelillo #45) also got by Fornoro who coasted home third. Chris DeRitis (Power Point #99) and Jim Miller (Miller #3m) completed the top five in the caution-filled race.\n\nIt was the third career NEMA checkered for Cantor and the first since Adirondack in 2005.\n\n“Never,” snapped the jaded Fornoro when asked if had ever run out of gas that late leading a race. Just a few minutes before he had gone under the white flag only to be “totally surprised when yellow showed again.” Behind him Greg Stoehr and Cantor, running second and third, made contact resulting in Stoehr retiring to the pit.\n\nDriving “the best car I’ve had since joining the Jarret crew,” he got away from Cantor, now in second, on the restart. He was well in command when the engine sputtered halfway down the backstretch.\n\n“Nobody had anything for Nokie tonight,” admitted Cantor. Fornoro’s 13.144 was the fastest lap of the race.\n\n“Somebody had to win and it might as well be me,” continued Cantor who had three gallons left in his tank. Starting third, he took the lead with a daring three wide move on the initial green sending him past front-row starters Erica Santos and DeRitis.\n\nA rash of yellows followed. Cantor lost the lead to Greg Stoehr on a restart. He lost second to Fornoro, the latter then passing Stoehr with seven gone. He used a string of green laps to open a commanding edge.\n\nCole Carter (Bertrand #74) lost a motor on lap two resulting in a very long caution period. Shortly after the restart Randy Cabral (Bertrand #47) hit the front stretch wall triggering a multi-car crash that eliminated five cars including the Luggelle #28 which landed on its side with Doug Cleveland aboard.\n\n“I just came out of four and the car kept going out to the fence,” said a dejected Cabral who was after a ninth win at the Speedbowl. “I am not happy.” The point leader, he had three wins and a second going into the race.\n\nThere were no heats, the Speedbowl needing time to pump the infield after heavy rain Friday night into Saturday morning. Brockton, MA – Cole Carter, a USAC open-cockpit mainstay and a member of one of America’s premier racing families, will be in the Northeastern Midget Association field at Waterford Speedbowl Saturday night, July 25th. NEMA will be part of “Nostalgia Weekend” at the historic Speedbowl.\n\nThe son of the legendary “Pancho” Carter, Cole will be a teammate of reigning champion and current point leader Randy Cabral in Bertrand Motorsports entries. He’ll steer the #74 driven twice this season by Jeff Horn.\n\nCarter will join a strong field led by Cabral, the all-time NEMA winner at the Speedbowl with eight including three last year for Bertrand.\n\nAmong current competitors, Horn, Nokie Fornoro (Jarret #4), Russ (Angelillo #45) and Greg Stoehr (Stoehr #26b) and Jim Miller (Miller #3m) have tasted at least one Speedbowl win, Greg Stoehr doing it last year. Adam Cantor (Cantor #7ny) and Erica Santos (Breault #44) were both consistent top-five finishers at Waterford in 2008. Cantor has four straight top-fives this year.\n\nWilliam Wall, last year’s top rookie, and current newcomer Chris DeRitis, who had a strong effort at Seekonk, are other threats. Many NEMA drivers scored their first win at the Speedbowl.\n\nCole Carter’s racing genes include both grandfathers – Duane Carter and Carl Forberg – and an uncle – the late Dana Carter – as well as his dad Pancho who, in addition to many Midget and Sprint successes, had 17 Indianapolis 500 starts.\n\nNow 26, Cole has been driving family equipment since 2000, climbing to as high as fourth in the 2005 standings. He has also driven Sprints, Silver Crown and Infinity Pro Series cars.\n\nThe last time NEMA came to the Speedbowl – the 2008 Finale – owner Tim Bertrand claimed first (Cabral) and second (Jeremy Frankoski) as well as the checkered in the NEMA Lites (Todd Bertrand). Bertrand has eight Speedbowl wins – six by Cabral, one by Lou Cicconi Jr. and one with himself driving back in 2002. He beat Cabral.\n\nThe most successful car owner at the Speedbowl is Gene Angelillo with 10. His winning drivers include Drew Fornoro, Russ Stoehr, Joey Payne Jr. and the versatile Teddy Christopher.\n\nAmong the drivers who scored their first-ever NEMA win at the Speedbowl is current USAC hot shoe Bobby Santos. Others are Ben Seitz and Barry Kittredge.\n\nThere are 26 years between Nokie Fornoro’s first (1981) and last (2007) NEMA/Speedbowl wins.\n\nThe Speedbowl hosted the second race in NEMA history on May 31, 1953. Billy Eldridge was the winner. It started a win list that is second to none among NEMA venues.\n\nNEMA Winners at Waterford Speedbowl\n\nNo. Driver First Last\n\n8 - Randy Cabral - 2002 2008\n\n6 - Drew Fornoro - 1982 1999\n\n5 - Bobby Seymour - 1988 2000\n\n4 - Dick Brown - 1958 1962\n\n4 - Mark Buonomo - 1999 2001\n\n4 - Nokie Fornoro - 1981 2007\n\n4 - Bobby Santos III - 2002 2004\n\n4 - Ben Seitz - 2004 2005\n\n3 - Joe Csiki - 1962 1963\n\n3 - Joey Payne Jr. - 2003 2006\n\n2 - Mike Favulli - 1991 1992\n\n2 - Bill Randall - 1959 1960\n\n2 - Russ Stoehr - 1999 2000\n\n2 - Butch Walsh - 1980 1981\n\nOne-time Waterford Speedbowl Winners: Tim Bertrand (2002), Rudy Boetticher Jr. (2000), Len Boyd (1978), Howie Bumpus (1988), King Carpenter (1960), Ted Christopher (1998), Lou Cicconi Jr. (2007), Johnny Coy (1977), John Dudevoir (1962), Bill Eldridge (1953), Johnny Evans (1975), Armond Holley (1976), Jeff Horn (1993), Mike Keeler (2006), Barry Kittredge (2001), Paul Lawless (2001), Johnny Mann (1978), Jim Miller (1999), George Monson (1973), Peter Pernesiglio (2002), Al Pillion (1959), Dutch Schaefer (1966), Mike Seymour (1997), Lee Smith (1982), Greg Stoehr (2008), Len Thrall (1970), Bobby White (1979)"
