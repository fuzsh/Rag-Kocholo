At year's end, Chip Ganassi took over the assets of the team (Patrick formed a new alliance with the Alfa Romeo Indy car program). Fittipaldi left the team to join Penske Racing. Ganassi renamed the team to Chip Ganassi Racing, and kept the two PC-23 chassis. For the 1990 season, Indy car rookie Eddie Cheever became the new driver, and utilized Fittipaldi's cars from 1989.

One is hung on a wall in Jim Hall's Petroleum Museum in Odessa Texas. Where a sign claims it to be the winner. The other is owned and restored to running condition by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Foundation, and housed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum.

In June 2011, the car participated in the Goodwood Festival of Speed. 1979: Gould Penske PC-6/Cosworth (Rick Mears)\n\nResearch suggest that the original car was owned by a private individual, but no longer exists. In 1980 at Indy, a significant number of pieces of the car appeared on the entry of Dick Ferguson. Roger Penske, the winning owner, owns a perfect replica of the car. Mario Andretti reportedly drove the same car at Indianapolis in 1978. In 2000, Mears donned his original driving suit, and drove the replica car for a few ceremonial laps at the Speedway. This car is one of Roger Penske's Indy winning cars (or replicas) that is displayed on a rotating basis at the Penske Racing Museum in Phoenix, Arizona. On October 12, 2010, the car was included in the special Centennial Era photo shoot on the mainstrech at the Speedway, where 33 of the best Indy 500-winning cars were aligned in a starting grid.

Foyt)\n\nThe winning car of the first four-time Indy 500 winner currently is believed to have existed at one point amongst three chassis. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum owns two 1977 Foyt cars, and various loose parts, in an effort to make certain all of the actual car's components are accounted for. The Speedway museum acquired the first rolling chassis shortly after the 1977 race. In August of 1992, A.J. Foyt hosted a huge, well-publicized, auction of his personal racing inventory at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Speedway purchased the second chassis at that time, which is believed to contain most of the winning parts. Jim Gilmore had possession of a third chassis, but after he died in 2000, little has been reported of its current whereabouts. The museum may have acquired the car, or pieces of it, as it is uncertain if the third car was even complete. The actual rolling chassis was driven by Foyt at Indy in 1975, when he won the pole position, and again by Foyt in 1976 as well. Billy Vukovich, Jr. drove the car to a top ten finish in the 1978 race, then it was retired. The most accepted chassis, comprised of the most accepted winning parts, is on permanent display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum, and is restored to a running condition. With its status as the first four-time winner, arguably this car is considered the second-most important car in the IMS collection (second only to the 1911 winning Marmom \"Wasp\"). On Opening Day, May 6, 2007, all five of Foyt's winning cars (1961, 1964, 1967, 1977, 1999), and the 1977 Oldsmobile pace car, participated in ceremonial laps celebrating Foyt's fiftieth year of competition at Indy. Foyt's grandson A.J. Foyt IV drove the 1977 winning car around the track. Foyt himself rode the 1977 Oldsmobile pace car with Speedway president Tony George. On October 12, 2010, the car was included in the special Centennial Era photo shoot on the mainstrech at the Speedway, where 33 of the best Indy 500-winning cars were aligned in a starting grid. In the spring of 2011 the car was included in the 100th Anniversary display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. In June 2011, the car participated in the Goodwood Festival of Speed. 1976: Hy-Gain McLaren Offy (Johnny Rutherford)\n\nWas Owned and restored to a display condition at the Behring Auto Museum at Blackhawk Plaza in San Francisco, California. The car had also been run at Indy in 1975 by Lloyd Ruby, and from 1977-1979 by Cliff Hucul. Now in Korea at the Samsung Transportation Museum. 1975: Jorgensen Eagle/Offy (Bobby Unser)\n\nThe car was also raced at Indy by Pancho Carter in 1976. It is the property of the Colliers Automotive Museum in Naples, Florida. This museum is closed to the public. On March 12-14, 2004 the car, or a replica, was displayed at the Concours d' Elegance at Amelia Island, FL. In the spring of 2011 the car was included in the 100th Anniversary display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. 1974: McLaren M16C Offy (Johnny Rutherford)\n\nThe car was initially sold by Team McLaren to the Walther family. It was then acquired by noted collector Rick Carroll of Jensen Beach, Florida. The car was the restored. It was well-documented, and on long-term loan to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum, but was ultimately returned to Carroll's estate, where it was auctioned off by Sotheby's in 1991. McLaren officials bid on the car, but it ultimately went to a private collector, the Prisma Collection of Patrick S. Ryan. It has appeared three times at the Concours d' Elegance at Amelia Island, FL most recently, on March 12-14, 2004. It is signed by Johnny Rutherford, and restored exactly to race-winning, running condition. In 2006, it was driven on parade laps at the Speedway during \"500\" Festival Community Day by Rick Hamlin. In the spring of 2011 the car was included in the 100th Anniversary display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. In June 2011, the car participated in the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Since then the ownership was transfered to Bill Oesterle. Purchased by Mclaren and moved to the england. However it was brought back to Indy for 2024 to run around the track before the race. 1973: STP Eagle/Offy (Gordon Johncock)\n\nThe actual winning car of 1973 was in the possession of Carly Brayton and the Brayton Family (relatives of the late Scott Brayton). The car was restored to at least display condition by Walter Goodwin. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum owns a replica of the car. The replica is not an accurate representation of the winning car. It is, in fact, a 1974-model Indy car, and the decals are equally as inaccurate. The museum replica had been on periodic display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. At some point around 2010, the authentic 1973 winner was brought to the Speedway museum for display, and the replica was moved off the museum floor to the storage basement, out of view, perhaps permanently. In the spring of 2011 the authentic car was included in the 100th Anniversary display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. 1972: Sunoco McLaren M16B (Mark Donohue)\n\nOwned and restored to running condition by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Foundation, and housed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. A plaque indicates it was donated by Sun Oil Company. It was entered in the race again in 1978 but did not qualify. It is the only Penske winning car that the Speedway has possession of. Roger Penske, the winning owner, owns a replica of the car, which is reportedly the car that Gary Bettenhausen drove in the 1972 race, painted to match Donohue's car. This car is one of Roger Penske's Indy winning cars (or replicas) that is displayed on a rotating basis at the Penske Racing Museum in Phoenix, Arizona. The 1972 Hurst/Old Cutlass Indianapolis 500 Pace Car which was awarded to Donohue is also on display at the Penske museum.

However, other records, photographs, and accounts, suggest otherwise. Prior to his death, Souders continued to claim the car was the same that DePaolo drove. Speedway historian Donald Davidson has not made any official declarations of authenticty, or lack thereof, however, he appears unwilling to confirm. The car has been restored to the 1925 running condition by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. The only original parts are believed to be the engine block, and few other pieces.

The official account by the estate claims that this car was a 1913 model Peugeot grand prix car, bought by Resta in 1915 when the Peugeot factory team disbanded its racing operations due to W.W.I. Resta finished second at Indy in 1915 (painted as #3), and won the 1916 race (painted as #17), which was scheduled for 300 miles. Resta also went on to win the 1916 AAA championship with the car. The car passed to Art Klein, the head of transportation at Warner Brothers Studios in Los Angeles. In 1949, he sold the car to prolific automobile collector Lindley Fowler Bothwell. In 1949, Bothwell actually entered the car (painted differently as #66) into the Indy 500 and practiced in the car, reaching a four lap timed average of 103.25 mph, earning him a driver's certificate. Bothwell hoped to qualify the car but, however, did not attempt to qualify, because due to the high speeds, the car began handled poorly. The car was on frequent display at Bothwell's citrus estate and other various shows, and recently at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. On race day 1966, the car was driven around the track for a ceremonial lap before the race, celebrating 50 years since the victory. Bothwell died in 1986, and the car remains part of his estate (painted in its #66 version), and is on occasional display at various events. On his radio program in 2007, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Historian Donald Davidson expressed some doubt about the car's authenticity.
