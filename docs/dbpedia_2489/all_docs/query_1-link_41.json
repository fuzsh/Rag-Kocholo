        "text": "Florida Open Wheel\n\nBy Richard Golardi\n\nDrama on the First Lap and the Last at the 2024 Little 500\n\nStory and Photosby Richard Golardi\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\nThe First Lap:\n\nScotty Adema is a 44-year-old pavement sprint car racer from Southwest Florida who comes to Anderson, Indiana, to win the biggest pavement sprint car race in the world, the Little 500 Presented by UAW. He left with his wrecked car shoehorned into his race trailer and his left arm undergoing surgery in the hospital in Anderson to realign the bones that had been broken and displaced. The updates on the driver of the No. 44 car, Scotty Adema, came through on a steady pace through the evening from the Anderson hospital as he was being examined and treated.\n\nScotty Adema Racing team photo at the 2024 Little 500\n\nUPDATE #1:\n\nScotty Adema's family has confirmed that he has a broken left wrist from the 3rd turn crash on the 1st lap of the 2024 Little 500. He is at the hospital and had a CAT scan of his head, neck, and torso. They are reviewing the CAT scan now and we are waiting to hear the results of all tests. Scotty expressed that he was glad about putting an emphasis on safety in his newly designed sprint car chassis. He was conscious and awake in the hospital. Results for broken wrist: Scotty has a closed reduction in the break, and has been told that he will not need surgery. His arm is broken and displaced.\n\nUPDATE #2:\n\nCause of crash was a hung (stuck) throttle going down the back stretch, which caused an impact with the outside back stretch wall and broke the steering, and the car went into the 3rd turn and had a hard head-on impact into the tires stacked at the outside 3rd turn wall.\n\nUPDATE #3:\n\n2:45a.m. Update on Scotty Adema from his wife, Lauren: “He is currently in surgery to have a bone, maybe two, put back into place. It’s a simple surgery. He is up, awake, and talking. We thank you all for your prayers and please hope for Scotty to have a speedy recovery.”\n\nScotty let me know about his Sunday evening condition, the latest update, and told me that he was “Sore as hell. My hand looks like a football (lol). Could’ve been a lot worse for sure.” The car looked worse, punched in on the front end with the right front suspension and wheel bent back at a crazy angle. As he climbed from his car on Saturday night, an aerial photographer’s drone caught him clutching his broken arm close to his body as the rescue crew helped him climb from the car. He made a claim about not losing consciousness, but that statement has since been disputed. “I’ll be back,” Scotty told me, adding,“just got to heal up a bit.” The sprint car that absorbed the big impact into the third turn tire barrier was one that he designed, the SASSE chassis. It keeps its sassy demeanor, taking the punishment that kept Scotty from more serious injury.\n\nThe Last Lap:\n\nThere had never been a last-lap pass for the lead in the previous 75 editions of the Little 500. There had been a pass for the lead on the next-to-last lap, which occurred in the 5thannual Little 500 in 1953 when Bob King passed John Key on the 499th lap and won the race. There had also been a last-lap pass for second place, which took place in 1969, a race that very likely ranks as the wildest, most exciting Little 500 finish in the history of the race. Someday it would happen, and there would be a last-lap pass to win the Little 500 now that the cars are so close and the winning margins smaller. That someday happened on Saturday at Anderson Speedway.\n\nDakoda Armstrong led when the white flag was shown to start the last lap at the Little 500 on Saturday night. His cousin, Caleb Armstrong, trailed closely in second and made a dive to the inside of the third turn, made the pass, and won the race. Both men are talented pavement sprint car drivers who had been striving for their first Little 500 win for years and had come close to winning in the past. They shared the same pit crew for both cars in this race.\n\nCaleb Armstrong, winner of the 2024 Little 500, May 25, 2024.\n\n“Man, the car was so good,” Dakoda Armstrong told me after the checkered flag fell on Saturday. “I thought I was better than them, but the problem was that with about a hundred to go, they came on the radio and they were doing their math and they were like, ‘I don’t know if you are gonna make it on fuel.’ So, I was in conservation mode for the last hundred laps, just trying to hang on. When I saw them wrecked up there the last time, I was pretty sure we were going to run out. On the second pit stop, we didn’t get enough fuel in it. So, for the last hundred laps, I was just trying to save. I stopped using brakes and I was just lifting at the flag stand, just letting it roll fast and I kind of burned up my right rear that way. The only way you can really save with these cars is just be off the throttle and when you pick it up, be as easy as you can. When I went to push it there at the end, the car just wasn’t under me. I got run tight in one and two trying to run low and it just slid up on me off of two and I didn’t have the grip I needed to stick it.\n\n“Man, the car was good for the 499 other laps! Just missed it on that one. If it had stayed green [instead of having a late-race caution], I was pretty sure that was our race but I guess that’s just how it goes. I wasn’t going to wreck him; I did not want two cars wrecked. Once he got there, I went to give him a lane and after 170 laps on that right rear tire, she was pretty shot. I just couldn’t stick on the top there, I couldn’t do a crossover. It’s so cool that team cars go one-two, just a little bittersweet that I thought we should have had it. I know he [Caleb] is about to retire and I don’t know if he wants to do it much more so it’s pretty cool that he got one. Hopefully, we can come back and get it, but it’s hard to bring a car that good every time.”\n\nCaleb Armstrong described his pass for the win as “a diamond move … I was close enough to him and beat him into the corner and was able to diamond him off the corner. It stuck. I knew it was going to be kind of sketchy, I was hard on the gas there and I knew I was going to pass him. The way I had him set up, I said: ‘I’m gonna make this pass.’ I didn’t know if he was going to give me the room, but he did.I felt like he could see me. I still can’t believe it, honestly. I kept pulling up beside him [Dakoda], kept bugging him, trying to rattle his cage, trying to make him mess up, slip up. I don’t know if it worked or not, I still can’t believe it. I was kind of worried because I never felt that good the whole race, I don’t know if it’s this new tire or what but I never felt that sporty. The guys did an awesome job on pit road and everything worked out perfectly this year. I felt like we should have had a few of these by now. It feels good to finally have it.\n\n“I kept talking to myself,” Caleb admitted. “Man, come on!” he told himself. “You’ve been wanting this forever.” That’s when he decided to push himself to the utmost limit of his skill and get every last bit from his worn tires and use every last bit of stamina he had left. His radio to communicate with his team was dead at this point in the race, and what minimal amount he heard was just garbled. But he still had the voice inside his head, urging him on, telling him that even the last turn of the last lap was not too late to make the pass and win. The voice was right.\n\nScotty Adema Makes the Little 500 With a Sprint Car He Designed\n\nStory and Photosby Richard Golardi\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nFloridian Scotty Adema is a 44-year-old pavement sprint car racer who is also a battalion chief at Pine Island Fire Department, and he’s been employed by them for 23 years. “I started with them at 21, and just worked through the ranks,” Scotty remarked. “There’s no mandatory retirement age. I’ll probably put in my paperwork in another two years, and after that, I have another five to eight years that I can go.”\n\nScotty Adema at the 2024 Little 500.\n\nScotty decided to return to the Little 500 in 2024, the 20th anniversary of his first and only start in the iconic pavement sprint car in 2004, to attempt to make the field for his second Little 500. Scotty recalled that the 2004 Little 500 was originally planned to be broadcast on the Speedvision cable TV channel, but never got aired on that channel. “It brought out quite a few cars – I believe there were 68 or 69 entries that year. We made the field, we qualified 29th. I think we were only one of two 360s to make the field, Dude Teate was the other one.”\n\nScotty did attempt to qualify for last year’s race, but was not quick enough to be among the 33 fastest qualifiers. The new chassis that he brought this year was described by Scotty as “a chassis that we’ve been working on, me and a guy named Steve Darvalicsfrom Northport, Florida. We just call him Steve D. or Sassy Steve. He worked for Doug Shaw for quite a while and was kind of doing his own thing in the stock car world now. We met and I had some ideas of what I wanted. His fab work was just second to none and he was definitely the right guy for the project. He kept a very high level of safety in the car with tubing sizes and everything. I couldn’t be happier with him as a partner. He could take the ideas in my head and put them into practical use. He was a partner in the actual idea of SASSE [the name of the new chassis] which stands for Scotty and Steve Sprintcar Engineering. It includes some things out of cars that I really enjoyed driving or had a lot of luck with. Our goal is to eventually make the car available to anybody. We do have a Facebook page: SASSE Chassis. We’ve got a good car, good service, and safety.”\n\nScotty explained that the Little 500 will be the second race for this new chassis after qualifying for the Dave Steele Classic race in February. “We’re getting closer and every time we’ve been out, we’ve been faster,” Scotty explained. “I’m still a little gun-shy from last year, it was a really miserable experience last year because we had a mish-mosh of parts on the car and had some engine problems that were not going to be rectified at the track. A lot of it’s our fault – but, live and learn. Next, we’re going to finish some of the design work on the car. A lot of the chassis builders are aging, and have been around a long time. We want to be a manufacturer where we can get a chassis made for a customer in weeks to a month. There seems to be plenty of people that want them [pavement sprint car chassis]. We want to make our chassis available to people. The same chassis will be just as competitive in whatever genre, or version of pavement sprint car racing that you want to do.”\n\nAfter a workman-like smooth four laps in his Thursday afternoon qualifying effort, Scotty felt comfortable with his time, partly due to a 44-car Little 500 entrant list that seemed to have suddenly deflated and had been reduced to possibly only 33 or 34 cars. Then, everything changed. A lightning bolt of excitement shot through the pits at the Little 500. Maybe one or two more cars could qualify, by bumping another car with a moderately fast time. Could a backup driver make his way from Tampa, make an overnight flight to Indianapolis (or close to it), and then step into the backup car that Scotty had brought with him and which sat in his trailer? Could that driver, obviously woreout after traveling all night, then put Scotty’s backup car in the field when Friday qualifying started at 1:30 p.m.? There was only one way to find out – give championship-winning Florida sprint car driver John Inman a call and tell him to get from Tampa to Anderson by Friday morning. The chase (for a spot in the field at the Little 500) WAS ON!\n\nScotty Adema confers with John Inman, in his backup car, at the 2024 Little 500\n\nThe choice of flights for a last-minute traveler out of Tampa was not great. The best option that John Inman found (after accepting his “Mission Impossible” assignment) was one that put him on the ground in Cleveland at 2:30 a.m. Friday morning. He had to wait until 6 a.m. for the car rental counter to openand was in a rental car at 6:30a.m. to make the Cleveland-to-Anderson early-morning run, an interstate highway dash to destiny.\n\nThe car was readied for his arrival, and it was no slouch. It won on the Southern Sprint Car Series circuit last year. Black tape made a hasty number 59 on the blue car, and John Inman, now changed into a firesuit and gloves and helmet, was ready, even though he confessed that he got no sleep during the night. His goal – four fast, smooth laps. He didn’t need to be blazing fast, as it looked like 44 cars were now down to 34 cars, and only one car would be bumped. A brave young driver, a local, was called in for a last-minute attempt in the Welpott Racing backup carand climbed in to turn his first laps in a sprint car. He made it. Rookie Jerry Kobza withdrew his Thursday time, requalified, and was still in the field. John Inman made his two runs of four laps, and fell just short. He had the 34th-fastest time. That’s the first alternate, but not in the starting field for Saturday (unless bad fortune befalls another qualified car). The sun seemed to bear down a little more brutally on John Inman’s face as he smiled, but with a touch of a grimace. He wasn’t cursing his luck. He had put everything into the 24-hour effort and was oh-so-close to that magic point of ecstasy – when a driver can exclaim: “Yeah! We did it. Always knew we could!” John was still smiling, even as the bystanders were lamenting, “Well … there’s always next year.” Could another lightning bolt of destiny strike and put John Inman in the field on Saturday? Who knows? Scotty Adema is in the field and had made a valiant effort to put a friend in the field too. He could be proud of that effort.\n\nVideo of Scotty Adema’s 2024 Little 500 Qualifying Attempt:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_n3Z-U7v0Ao?si=CeJPHfhI6EdIEMlB\n\n2024 Little 500 Pole Position Goes to Emerson Axsom\n\nStory and photo by Richard Golardi\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nEmerson Axsom at Anderson Speedway, 5-23-2024\n\nEmerson Axsom grabbed the 2024 Little 500 Presented by UAW pole position on the first day of qualifying on Thursday at Anderson Speedway in Indiana. As the young, tousle-haired racer sped by the main stand in the yellow and purple No. 4 sprint car with his last name splashed across the roll cage front, the V6 engine in his car gave a loud, reverberating buzzing note, distinctively different from the roar of the V8 engines. The smaller engine is known for not having a disadvantage at the small track compared to the V8 and is often described as “having all the horsepower you need at this small place, you can't use all you have in a V8 anyway.” In recent years, cars with both V6 and V8 engines have made their way to the Little 500 winner’s circle.\n\nEmerson remarked confidently after qualifying was completed, “Tyler Roahrig went right before me, so we had a time to chase. I wish Gene [Nolen] was here, because he was one of my biggest supporters and he was the main reason I'm able to drive this car because he was a big fan of mine. I know he's watching. It would be really cool if he was here and could take some pictures with us on the front row. Starting on the front row means that we’ll get the jump and will be the first in lapped traffic. You get to there in five laps, and you don’t really have clean air. It is better to set your own pace and not have to fight to the front and then pit and try to fight to the front again. You can just get out front and try to stay out front. It is definitely easier to start up front.”From 5/23/2024, at Anderson, Indiana.\n\nTommy Nichols Plans 2024 Racing in Both Midwest and Florida\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nTommy Nichols, May 2024.\n\nVeteran Florida sprint car owner and driver Tommy Nichols plans to race his No. 55 sprint car in both Florida and the Midwest during the 2024 season, and I caught up with him at the recent Must See Racing Sprint Car Series race at Berlin Raceway in Michigan. Nichols has already had his first sprint car feature win of the season, which occurred at Showtime Speedway in Pinellas Park on Saturday, March 9, and added a win in the Dash for Cash at Citrus County Speedway on May 11. He also will be making a major change this season, adding a second team driver for her first races later this season.\n\n“We’re going to run all the Must See races,” Tommy Nichols said, “and we’re planning on running some of the 500 Sprint Car Series. I’ve got two cars up here so I can kind of mix it up and still run what I can down in Tampa with the group. I’ve hired a young lady, Macy Williams, who is going to be driving periodically for me. She’s out of Denver, Colorado, and is 19 years old, and will be driving the winged sprint. My hourglass is getting kind of towards the end, so I figured that I’d find a young driver that I could start coaching and adding to the sport, hopefully.”\n\nTommy Nichols at Berlin Raceway, Michigan, May 18, 2024\n\nMacy Williams, who has been racing since she was six years old, did have a recent Midwest open-wheel race, driving in the 2023 Kenyon Midget Series season finale at Anderson Speedway on October 7. It was her debut in oval track racing, which occurred with support from Aaron Pierce and his AP Driver Development Program. Williams has had many wins and series championships in go-kart racing, often in the shifter class races. She decided that she was ready to try something new in an attempt to advance in her racing career and match the success she has had in go-karts.\n\nHow did Tommy find out about Macy Williams and come to offer her a sprint car ride? “Actually, she drove for Aaron Pierce last year in the midget, and did pretty good, and just through friends, and just came to an agreement. No, she’s never raced in Florida, but we are going to bring her down and let her run a couple of races down there this year.” Tommy’s plans for Macy so far include winged sprint car races with the Must See Racing Sprint Series and also with the Southern Sprint Car Series in Florida. “I don’t know if we’re going to do any non-wing races with her,” Tommy added. “I plan on running some 500 Series races, but I don’t know if she will. I will run the full series with Must See Racing, and with her, she will run a couple of races just to get her feet wet [in a second car].” Tommy told me that he has the Beast chassis that he was racing at Berlin Raceway and also a Hurricane chassis, the car he raced last year.\n\nMore on Macy Williams: “Her main thing is the shifter karts,” Tommy Nichols continued, “and she runs around the world. I mean, she’s been to Germany, France, she’s been all over and won multiple races.” How many laps has she had in a sprint car? “Probably none. I think on June 7 [a Friday night open practice], we’re taking her to Anderson and let her run with the wing at Anderson and practice all day long.”Do you have a date for her first winged pavement sprint car race? “Not yet,” Tommy replied. “But I think we’re planning on the race at Plymouth with Must See Racing [race date: Saturday, June 15]. She is also a driving instructor at an Arizona-based driving school and she instructs people that go out there and run the road course. To me, that’s pretty neat [with her instructing wealthy clients who can afford to drive exotic sports cars]. She’s a 19-year-old girl, and she’s out there teaching these guys [on the road course]. She knows corner speed and that’s the big thing, especially for one of the sprint cars. Corner speed … speed period … is where it’s at, so I think she’s going to acclimate to it very well.” Tommy believes that Macy will have no problem getting up to speed in her next racing adventure – sprint cars.\n\nLittle 500 Hall of Fame Announces Release of New Documentary\n\nStory and photo by Richard Golardi\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nThe Little 500 Hall of Fame has announcedthe release of a new documentary film titled At Speed with Rob Hoffman. This documentary chronicles the career of open-wheel racing car owner and builder Rob Hoffman of Ohio, who is being inducted into the Little 500 Hall of Fame on Saturday, May 25, 2024. Rob also was the recipient of the Jack Nowling Award from the Little 500 Hall of Fame in 2023. With his No. 69 Hoffman Auto Racing sprint car, he won the pole position at the Little 500 with driver Bryan Clauson (2014), he also won the race with Kody Swanson (2016), and had American racing legend Tony Stewart drive his car to third in the race in 2017, along with earning the Rookie of the Year Award. This documentary is being co-presented by the Florida Open Wheel Channel and the Little 500 Hall of Fame and is produced by award-winning journalist and author Richard Golardi.\n\nAfter going to Rob Hoffman’s race shop in Ohio on May 30, 2023, Richard Golardi got to take a tour of the Hoffman Auto Racing team’s race shop and various work areas, in addition to examining the classic car collection and memorabilia of the team’s decades of open-wheel racing and many USAC sprint car championships. Rob Hoffman had many fascinating stories to tell of going racing with his father, Richard, and other Hoffman family members with their Indy cars, champ cars, and also sprint cars and midgets. The nearly 100-year history of the Hoffman family’s American racing endeavors provides an engrossing and exciting story that is sure to please fans of American open-wheel racing, the Indianapolis 500, USAC racing, and the Little 500 sprint car race.\n\nThe Little 500 Hall of Fame has thankedRichard Golardi, columnist with Hoseheads.com, for producing this video and making it available for free for all race fans worldwide. There will be more documentary films relating to the Little 500 in the future.\n\nThe Little 500 Hall of Fame has invited the Little 500 community of participants and fans to this year’s induction ceremony, which will take place at Anderson Speedway, Indiana (at the pavilion), on Saturday, May 25 beginning at 1:30p.m.This year’s ceremony will be open to the public at no charge.

Sam Pierce Chevrolet has provided the Little 500 Presented by UAW with push trucks for many years in addition to the pace truck that paces the field during the race. Sam Pierce has fielded sprint cars in the Little 500 since 2004 with drivers Aaron Pierce, Tanner Swanson, Joey Schmidt, Austin Nemire, and Mickey Kempgens, and adds Kaylee Bryson in 2024. Floridian Colton Bettis is his newest team driver and likely future Little 500 starter. His drivers have earned two poles (both by Aaron Pierce), three top five finishes, and five top tens.\n\nSam Pierce was in the Central Highlands in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War from 1969 to 1970 as a U.S. Army combat infantryman. “Every day, we were in the bushes,” according to Sam. Upon returning home to Muncie, Indiana, he went back to his job at the GM transmission plant. He also worked on and sold cars from his home. “That was to support my racing habit, my drag racing habit.” The asphalt ¼ mile fueled his desire for speed. He paired that with building a base of customers for car repairs and sales from the GM plant employees. Those Muncie and Anderson GM plant employees would remain a loyal customer base for decades for used car sales, and later for sales of new Chevrolets when Sam Pierce Chevrolet was formed in 1983.\n\n“Our business for years has predominately been supported by the GM employees. We went to a little town called Middletown, it was mostly farmers and GM employees. They worked at Delco-Remy, Guide Lamp or Chevrolet.By 2003 (the last year in Middletown before moving the dealership to Daleville), we sold a thousand new cars that year, and 500 used. We’re in the top five in our area as far as sales go. We’re between two corn fields, but our numbers are really strong. We still sell a thousand new cars a year.”\n\nSam Pierce’s tenacity, determination, and friendly, selfless demeanoralong with his mentoring of young open wheel race drivers is reminiscent of the qualities that earned Jack Nowling a place in the hearts of competitors and fans in Indiana and nationwide.\n\nTheHall of Fame wishes to thank Wayne and Shirlene Hammond for their continuing sponsorship of the Jack Nowling Award again in 2024.They have chosen to honor the memory of Dave Steele with their sponsor donation. Wayne recently retired as the general manager of Brandon Ford in Tampa, Florida, and previously drove a sprint car for Jack Nowling in the Little 500 and in Florida competition.The Award Plaque features aphoto of Jack Nowling in the winner’s circle at Anderson Speedway in 1996.\n\nThe Little 500 Hall of Fame also expresses its thanks toRichard Golardi, columnist with Hoseheads.com, for originating the idea for the award; Wayne and Shirlene Hammond for their sponsor donation; and Dorothy Nowling for her assistance with the logo design. The Little 500 Hall of Fame has invited the Little 500 community of participants and fans to this year’s induction ceremony (which includes the Jack Nowling Award presentation), which will take place at Anderson Speedway, Indiana, on Saturday, May 25(time to be announced).For further information, contact David Sink (765) 278-8231.\n\nBy Richard Golardi, Hoseheads.com, for the Little 500 Hall of Fame.\n\nLittle 500 Entry List Shows Few Floridians and a Plethora of Rookies\n\nStory and photos by Richard Golardi\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nThe most recently released entry list for the 2024 Little 500 Presented by UAW, set for Saturday, May 25, shows a total of 40 sprint cars entered, with a total of 38 assigned drivers. The No. 12 car entered by Jerry Powell and the Sam Pierce Chevrolet Racing Team entry with the now-retired Tanner Swanson are the two cars without assigned drivers. There are a total of nine rookie drivers entered, a number which might have been pumped up by the surprising win last year by a rookie driver, Jake Trainor. There are also four race winners entered, which includes two multi-time winners, Kody Swanson and Tyler Roahrig. Although the Sam Pierce Chevrolet team does have two drivers for their pavement sprint cars, Kaylee Bryson and 14-year-old Colton Bettis from Florida, the team is entering Bettis in Must See Racing sprint car races only due to his age. Sam Pierce told me that he hasn’t yet decided if he will withdraw the Little 500 entry for the second car or keep it and assign a new driver.\n\nTwo-time race winner Tyler Roahrig and friends at the 2023 Little 500\n\nThere are only three Floridians with cars entered as of the most recent entry list update on March 19. They are Shane Butler from Bushnell, Scotty Adema from Ft. Myers, and Tommy Nichols from Tampa. With 12 race starts, Shane Butler is the most experienced Little 500 driver in the group and also has the best race finish, 8th place in 2016.\n\nOne of the major factors that has likely increased the number of rookie and veteran entrants in this year’s race is the lack of another pavement sprint car series racing in the Midwest on the same day. In recent years, the Must See Racing Series has held a race on the same day as the Little 500, the American Speed U.S. Nationals, which was held at Birch Run Speedway, Michigan in 2023. Jimmy McCune and Tommy Nichols both raced in Michigan on that weekend instead of entering the 2023 Little 500. In 2024, Must See Racing will not race on Memorial Day weekend. McCune and Nichols will both be back in the Little 500 in 2024. Jeff Bloom, also a regular in the Must See Racing Series, is back to qualify for another Little 500 in 2024 in the No. 32 car of Terry Broadus. By qualifying, he will make his 43rd Little 500 start, which is 13 starts more than the driver with the second most starts, Brian Tyler.\n\nRace winner Jake Trainor at the 2023 Little 500.\n\nI have learned that five-time Must See Racing Series sprint car champion Jimmy McCune will have a new car for the Little 500, and that it will race for the first time on race day, May 25. In other news for the McCune family, Jimmy and his father, “Big Jim” McCune, will both be present at the Little 500 Hall of Fame induction ceremony for the first time since Big Jim\n\nbecame the sponsor of the “Irish” Jim McCune Memorial Little 500 Hall of Fame Plaque (named for Big Jim’s father) in 2023. Another McCune family member, Jimmy Jr., aka Jim McCune IV, aka Lil Jimmy, aka Jimbo (those last two from his father, with Jimmy Jr. being preferred by his grandfather), the 15-year-old son of Jimmy McCune, has made his first step toward becoming a pavement sprint car race driver. He has completed his first practice laps at Lorain County Speedway in a pavement sprint car and will be getting his first competition laps later this year in a dirt sprint car. His previous racing experience has been in go-karts on both dirt and pavement. His father and grandfather both plan for him to get more practice laps on pavement in preparation for his first sprint car competition laps.\n\nA major change to the format of the Little 500 Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony will mean that the ceremony will be open to the public for free with the elimination of the need to purchase a luncheon ticket. There will be no meal at the ceremony and a later start time, with the hope of attracting more fans arriving in the afternoon for pre-race events. The naming of two local inductees, Gary Schlafer of Anderson and Sandy Jones of Muncie, and a current car owner, Rob Hoffman, who will all be inducted into the Hall of Fame on May 25, will likely also boost attendance. Another upcoming event for the Hall of Fame is the naming of the 2024 recipient of the Jack Nowling Award, an annual award that debuted at the 2023 Induction Ceremony.\n\nIt's time for another annual tradition, my Little 500 Race Week Open Wheel Racing Schedule.

What made him the most impressive 360 driver during the month was that two of the three wins were in big-money races paying $10,000 each to win, the USCS Southern Sprint Car Series finale on 1/27 and the East Bay 360 Winternationals finale on 2/16, which he won from 14th starting place. Timms is a Toyota Development driver who will drive a midget in his second season with Keith Kunz Motorsports in 2024. His high point last year was likely his three wins in USAC national midget racing. Timms has been called one of the brightest young guns currently driving in American open-wheel racing.\n\n2024 Florida Open Wheel Column Florida Speedweeks 410 Sprint Car Driver of the Year Award: Logan Seavey\n\nAlthough Logan Seavey only won two of the six USAC national sprint car races in February, he won two features in one day at Volusia after a Monday rainout, and he left Florida with the USAC sprint car point lead and the Big Gator Trophy for most USAC sprint car points at Volusia Speedway Park with that impressive feat of two feature wins in one day on February 13. Those achievements were the best among 410 sprint car drivers during the month in Florida. Hopefully he’ll remember not to put that Big Gator on the floor in any room where dogs or cats roam to avoid a serious pet freakout.\n\n2024 Florida Open Wheel Column Florida Speedweeks Track of the Year Award: East Bay Raceway Park\n\nI’ll admit that this award was based on purely sentimental reasons since the track held its last-ever East Bay Winternationals this month, will close permanently in mid-October, and that the decision was based on decades of incredible, history-making dirt sprint car racing for the entire life of the track, 1977 to 2024. Farewell to the East Bay Winternationals.\n\n2024 Florida Open Wheel Column Florida Speedweeks Sprint Car Promoter of the Year Award: Pete Walton, United Sprint Car Series\n\nPete Walton had the most ambitious schedule of Speedweeks sprint car racing, which stretched from the far-flung western Florida panhandle down to the edge of the Everglades in South Florida and lasted from late January through late February. You could have seen U. S. military fighter jets scream overhead as they departed the Pensacola area military bases as well as some equally intimidating crocodiles and alligators in the swamps near the Hendry County track while visiting those USCS Speedweeks locations. In addition, Pete Walton has firmly established the USCS Southern Sprint Car Shootout at Volusia Speedway Park (held three weeks before Daytona 500 weekend this year and moving to two weeks before Daytona in 2025) as the probable successor to the East Bay 360 Winternationalsfor next year and beyond. There is no other three-race series for 360 c.i. winged dirt sprint cars that has a realistic chance to be the “next 360 Sprint Car Winternationals.” With Volusia as the special event’s home and the support of the DIRTcar management that owns the track, Pete Walton’s workaholic commitment got him a title sponsor (Germfree), air time on DIRTVision’s streaming network for the three-raceseriespaying $75,000 in prize money, participation by a NASCAR regular and a handful ofsprint car legends, and the virtual certainty that his three days of 360 motor madness will be the new “360 Winternationals” for 2025 and beyond. Heck, I’ve even encouraged him to use the “360 Winternationals” title starting next year.\n\n2024 Florida Open Wheel Column Florida Speedweeks Most Exciting Sprint Car Race Award:\n\nHigh Limit Racing Series, Battle at the Bay, Feature Race #2 (on Tuesday), East Bay Raceway Park, Tuesday, February 13,2024\n\nVideo – race highlights, High Limit Racing Series,Feature #2, East Bay Raceway Park, Feb. 13, 2024:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ycJ0UhiBzmM?si=ZpvHu1bDAu9P3w8K\n\nWill Cagle is Inducted Into His Seventh Hall of Fame\n\nStory and photo by Richard Golardi\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nOn Tuesday, February 20, Florida auto racing legend Will Cagle was inducted into his seventh auto racing Hall of Fame, The Villages Motor Racing Fan Club Hall of Fame, in a ceremony that took place in The Villages, Florida.\n\nWill and Barbara Cagle\n\nUpon accepting the induction, Will commented, “I’d like to thank my family and my wife, Barbara, who I picked up hitchhiking sixty-six years ago and she’s still here! She’s towed the cars and has done everything to help me. She’s always been right there. We’ve got three lovely children and the oldest one is sixty, he turned sixty a couple of years ago. Then we’ve got two girls, and they’re not as old as he is. But I’ve had a wonderful career and the main thing I’ve done is what I wanted to do, and not what someone told me to do. I’d also like to thank The Villages Motor Racing Fan Club for inducting me into their Hall of Fame. I consider it quite an honor.”\n\nWill has frequently been described as the most dominating big-block modified race driver of all time. Will has won countless modified and super-modified championships in Florida and in the Northeast, including multiple track championships in each of these states: New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring his career, Will Cagle has been inducted into seven prominent racing Halls of Fame. They are: (1) Harmony Speedway Hall of Fame; (2) Living Legends of Auto Racing; (3) Jacksonville Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame; (4) Eastern Motorsport Press Association Hall of Fame; (5) Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame; (6) New York State Stock Car Association Hall of Fame, and (7) The Villages Motor Racing Fan Club Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to modifieds and super-modifieds, Will has driven Indy cars, NASCAR Modified-Sportsman stock cars at Daytona, late model stock cars, midgets, sprint cars, USAC Silver Crown champ cars, Legend cars, a Trans Am sports car ('68 Chevy Camaro), and even a five-ton Mack truck during a racing career that began in the early '50s. Will has raced against and beaten some of the best drivers in America and has been a dirt racing instructor to Hollywood royalty. Will is credited with 472 wins in big-block modified racing, and over 900 total wins and if you ask him, he'll tell you that he intends to get some more.\n\nI hope you will join me in congratulating Will Cagle on his amazing racing career.\n\nVideo – “Will Cagle's Induction Into The Villages Motor Racing Fan Club Hall of Fame”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YwX3_sQrXVo?si=0Is9U8BAZ53h4YU5\n\nFlorida Legend Jim Childers Plans Return to Racing at Age 80\n\nStory and Photo by Richard Golardi\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nFlorida late model and sprint car racing legend Jim Childers told me on Saturday that he plans to return to driving a sprint car at age 80. He retired from race car driving 20 years ago when he was 60 years old, a move that he now regrets. When I asked Childers why he was making a racing comeback in his 80s, he remarked, “Because I think I retired too soon.” He also mentioned fellow Florida racing legend Buzzie Reutimann, who is still racing dirt modifieds into his 80s and apparently has no plans to retire soon.\n\nJim and Charmaine Childers at the 2018 Little 500 at Anderson Speedway.\n\nChilders plans to make his racing comeback in pavement sprint car racing and (as of Saturday) plans for his first race to be at the next BG Products Southern Sprint Car Series race at Citrus County Speedway in Inverness on Saturday, March 2.With a $10,000 first-place prize for the 50-lap race, this special event, The Children’s Dream Fund 50, is being co-sanctioned by the Midwest-based Must See Racing Sprint Series. This race already has 31 cars that are anticipated to enter, with seven out-of-state drivers on the preliminary entry list, and appears to be a successful attempt to establish an iconic Florida pavement sprint car event with multiple sanctioning bodies involved. Childers has entered the No. 44 car that he purchased from Gary Wiggins. Childers, now a Seffner-based car owner/driver, did show up on an earlier Southern Sprint Car Series entry list for a race on January 27, but did not feel the car was ready and now plans to make his return to racing on March 2.\n\nJim Childers, a Little 500 Hall of Fame inductee, did have most of hisauto racing success in sprint cars, winning the Little 500 three times (most for any Florida driver) and earning the TBARA sprint car driverchampionship, Tampa Tribune Driver of the Year honor, and Open Wheel magazine 360 Winged Sprint Car Driver of the Year titlein 2000. He was 56 years old when he earned those last three honors and retired four years later. Now he’s embarking on his next racing adventure in his 80s, and like Buzzie Reutimann, is making no mention of any plans to retire.\n\nDave Steele’s Amazing USAC Racing History\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nFebruary 8, 2024\n\nAmazing. That’s the word I would choose to sum up Florida racing legend Dave Steele’s achievements racing in United States Auto Club (USAC) national racing events. Other than his achievements racing in Florida sprint car events, I know that Dave was the proudest of what he had achieved racing in USAC and their national racing series (Silver Crown, National Sprint Car, and National Midget Series).\n\nDave Steele at 2015 Little 500, Anderson Speedway.\n\nMost of us know the oft-repeated win numbers: Frequently competing in only half the races on the USAC sprint car or midget schedule, or just the paved-track races, Dave Steele had 60 USAC national race wins from 1996 to 2007, and is tied with JJ Yeley for 16th place on the USAC national series win list. He had 16 Silver Crown, 26 sprint car, and 18 midget race wins, and two national championships in the USAC Silver Crown Series in 2004 and 2005.\n\nBut if you dive deeper into the numbers, Dave’s domination becomes easier to see and more impressive. Let’s begin with a list in which he’s at the top, number one. This USAC statistic shows his open-wheel versatility and consistency, not to mention that he kicked butt on the track to take the modern-day (1971 to present) record for most seasons with a win in all three national series (Silver Crown, sprint car, and midget). Dave has six seasons with wins in all three national series: 1998 and 2001–05. The next one of Dave’s USAC racing achievements to outline is one that I have to admit I was kind of shocked to learn about. It provides a lesson onhow Dave’s winning ways compare to other modern-day sprint car racing legends. I had assumed that other better-known American racing legends, who had raced for much longer and had more championships and Hall of Fame inductions when compared to Dave had won more frequently than Dave in USAC sprint cars. Wrong!\n\nMy assumption was really wrong, and I’ll admit it. In USAC national sprint car racing, Dave had 26 USAC sprint car wins in 125 starts, a 20.8% win percentage. Surprise, Surprise! – that makes his USAC sprint car win percentage higher than that of legendary racing champions such as Mario Andretti, Tony Stewart, Bryan Clauson, and Jack Hewitt. In addition, when you eliminate the dirt track race starts (and Dave started in a sprinkling of dirt sprint car races as he never loved dirt racing, so that seems fair to me!), that reduces the USAC sprint car starts total to 114. Twenty-six wins in 114 USAC sprint car starts (now all wins and starts are on paved tracks) produce a 22.8% win percentage. Let’s go back to that USAC Career Win Percentage List, which uses a minimum of 50 starts to eliminate those drivers who had a 100% win percentage, but only raced in a few USAC races and won them (such as Doug Wolfgang). Now Dave Steele has leapfrogged ahead of some real legends, some monsters of racing. Dave’s pavement-only USAC sprint car win percentage is higher than the career win percentages of A.J. Foyt, Tommy Hinnershitz, and Jim Hurtubise. Only Parnelli Jones, Jud Larson, and Rick Hood have a higher USAC sprint car win percentage and Parnelli is the only one to be more than just a few ticks above Dave Steele’s number.\n\nThis dominance in USAC sprint cars does bring back memories of Dave’s incredible domination in local Florida sprint car racing, a phase of his career that I was fortunate to cover extensively during a ten-year time, 2007–17. Near the end of this decade of dominance, Dave had three major achievements: taking over first place in the All-Time Florida Sprint Car Win List, becoming the first driver in Florida racing history to win 100 Florida sprint car races, and then becoming the first to win in excess of 100 Florida sprint car races. Dave’s 101 Florida sprint car race wins still stands as the most in Florida racing history, and is a record that probably won’t be challenged in the foreseeable future.\n\nDave Steele has his board track car ready for 2016, December 2015 at Jack Nowling's Party.\n\nLet’s consider some other of Dave Steele’s USAC open-wheel racing achievements, which even though they may not fit into the arena of being amazing, still put him near the top when compared to other USAC drivers. So, maybe not amazing but still kick-butt impressive. Dave is tied for second place for USAC national sprint car season-opening wins with two wins, coming in 1996 (April 12, Lakeside Speedway, Kansas); and 2005 (April 10, Anderson Speedway, Indiana). No other driver has more than three USAC sprint car season-opening wins.He’s in third place for USAC Silver Crown fastest qualifying times (19). Also, during the 1998 to ’99 time frame, when Dave had only been going at USAC racing full-tilt for a couple of years, he won four consecutive USAC sprint car features at Winchester Speedway. Another USAC sprint car win streak occurred in a much more condensed time in 1997 when Dave won three consecutive Indianapolis Raceway Park features during May, June, and July.\n\nThen there’s the love affair Dave had with winning at a track far from home – way out west in Phoenix, Arizona.In Phoenix Raceway’s annual Copper World Classic, Dave won the USAC Silver Crown race for five consecutive years, from 2002 to 2006. The last Phoenix Silver Crown win in January 2006 came in one of the “new generation” pavementcars. It was the first race with the new cars. That Phoenix win made him the first driver in USAC history to win an iconic series race for five straight years. Dave also won the USAC national midget race during the annual Copper World Classic in 2002, ’06, and ’07. He gave Toyota its first USAC national midget series win in 2006 at the wheel of Nine Racing team’s number 91 Toyota-powered car.\n\nOne of the reasons for this column dealing with Dave Steele’s amazing USAC racing history is because this weekend brings the annual running of a race named in memory of Dave Steele and the only active race event using Dave’s name with the family’s blessing, the Dave Steele Non-Winged Sprint Car Championship race at Showtime Speedway in Pinellas Park, Florida. Friday night will have non-winged sprint car practice and a Dash for Cash race. Saturday night will have the 125-lap championship sprint car race (with a 1st place prize of $5,000) and two other Showtime divisions as the undercard. Two of the Florida drivers to keep an eye on this weekend are Davey Hamilton Jr. and teenage phenom Colton Bettis, who won the two Dave Steele Championship winged feature races at Showtime Speedway last weekend.\n\n2023 Florida Sprint Car Racing Season Concludes, Part Two: The End of an Era?\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nThe End of an Era? The limited 360 sprint car race in two days (Saturday, December 9) with the Top Gun Sprint Series at East Bay Raceway Park may mark the end of an era in Florida sprint car racing. It may very likely be the last sprint car race in Florida to require (with some exceptions) limited 360 c.i. engines. Only two series racing on Florida dirt have required these engines up to this year: the Top Gun Sprint Series and East Bay Raceway’s own East Bay Sprints. Top Gun is making a 2024 rule change to allow an engine already in wide use nationwide, the ASCS/USCS 360 c.i. engine. Many Florida dirt racing teams already have these engines and have been using them while racing with the USCS national series, and in events like last weekend’s Battle in Barberville at Volusia Speedway Park and the East Bay 360 Winternationals in February. The East Bay Sprints have a long history of using the limited 360 engine for over 26 years, going back to 1997.\n\nIt was first revealed in March 1997 that East Bay Raceway Park was introducing the new limited sprints division that month, and that it was replacing the Southern Modified division. This was probably done for two reasons. First, sprint car racing had become widely popular in Florida (TBARA was at its peak), while the popularity of the Southern Modified class had diminished. Secondly, the TBARA, which had raced at East Bay Raceway in 1996, was going to a pavement-only schedule in 1997. They would never race at East Bay Raceway again. East Bay replaced the TBARA races with weekly Saturday night limited sprint car races, but for East Bay Raceway points only. East Bay would be in control and set the purses and the rules for limited 360 racing until the Top Gun Sprint Series began in 2009. The new dirt series chose to use the limited 360 engine rules already being used by the Tampa-area and Jacksonville teams at East Bay. One engine and one car were sufficient to race in both East Bay Sprints and Top Gun, with many teams viewing it as a cost-saving option.\n\nTommy Nichols, feature winner, Auburndale Speedway, 12-2-2023\n\nWith East Bay Raceway rumored to be closing permanently after the final race in October 2024 with the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series (appropriately named The Grand Finale), and with no announced weekly racing schedule (there would be no reason to continue limited 360 racing), the end of the line for the limited 360 engine in Florida has arrived. So, 26 years and 9 months after the first limited 360 sprint car race in Florida, the day of the last race has arrived – this Saturday. A handful of Florida drivers rose to dominate limited 360 competition over those couple of decades, and their names have been mentioned many times in this column. Many are still around, and one may even be smiling in the East Bay winner’s circle on Saturday. Hopefully, the new era of local Florida dirt sprint car racing will be around as long (or longer) than the prior limited 360 era.\n\nThe local Florida pavement-only sprint car series, the BG Products Southern Sprint Car Series, concluded its season last Saturday, with Tommy Nichols getting his first sprint car feature win of the year. The series champions were named: Daniel Miller is the 2023 series driver champion and Miller’s car owner, Doug Kenny of PCS Racing, is the 2023 series owner champion. This was the first sprint car racing championship for both men, and Doug Kenny’s first auto racing championship since a 2004 Pro Truck series owner’s title. Colton Bettis was named the 2023 Rookie of the Year. There were also several milestones celebrated by Southern Sprint Car Series drivers during the year.\n\nBo Hartley: When Bo Hartley got his feature race win at Citrus County Speedway in Inverness (Southern Sprint Car Series) on July 8, 2023, it was his first sprint car feature win since February 2010.\n\nJoe Liguori: Prior to last Saturday’s race, the prior race at Auburndale Speedway on September 23 produced one of the best feel-good stories of the year in Florida racing. Florida racing legend George Rudolph, car owner, and Joe Liguori, driver, got the win that was years in the making. Liguori's win was the first Florida sprint car feature win for a Liguori family member since grandfather Ralph won at Sunshine Speedway in 1979.\n\nSteven Hollinger: Steven Hollinger's sprint car feature win at Auburndale Speedway on June 10, 2023, was the first Florida sprint car feature win by a driver from Melbourne, Florida, since Billy Yuma's feature win at Golden Gate Speedway on June 22, 1974. Almost 49 years had elapsed between these two Florida feature wins by Melbourne residents. Steven also earned another Florida sprint car feature win on July 3, 2023, at Showtime Speedway.\n\nDaniel Miller, driver, and Doug Kenny, owner of the 2023 Southern Sprint Car Series champion titles.\n\nThe Top Gun Sprint Series will finish its 2023 season at East Bay Raceway Park on Saturday, December 9 with the Don Rehm Classic (a winged race). This may be the final time that East Bay Raceway Park will have racing during December due to the 2024 track closing. About those rumors of 2025 racing – remember that the name of East Bay’s October late model races, The Grand Finale, was chosen for a reason, which was to signal the end of East Bay. Shed a tear (in October), and then say goodbye. Hopefully, your memories of the past good times will last through 2025 and beyond.\n\n2023 Florida Sprint Car Racing Season Concludes\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nNovember 27, 2023\n\nThe two Florida sprint car racing series, the BG Products Southern Sprint Car Series, which races on pavement, and the Top Gun Sprint Series, a dirt-only series, both conclude their seasons over the next two weekends. The Southern Sprint Cars conclude their year at their final 2023 race at Auburndale Speedway in Auburndale on Saturday, December 2. Top Gun finishes up the slate of 2023 races the following weekend at East Bay Raceway Park on Saturday, December 9 with the Don Rehm Classic (previously announced as a non-wing race, now a winged race). This may be their final December race at East Bay, with the track rumored to be closing permanently after the final race in November 2024 with the Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Series.\n\nDon Rehm, founder of the Top Gun Sprint Series\n\n2024 will be a climactic year of change for the Top Gun Series, with a changeover to using ASCS/USCS 360 c.i. engines and abandoning the long-term use of limited 360 c.i. engines. They will also be ending one of their most important partnerships, the one they have maintained with East Bay Raceway Park since the inaugural Top Gun season in 2009. It is assumed they will race at the Gibsonton third-mile track next year for the track’s final season (the track’s planned sale is finalized after the 2024 race season, with the new owners already having confirmed they have no interest in operating a race track). Additionally, one of Florida’s most iconic racing families, the Racing Reutimanns, are anticipated to be present in the pits at Top Gun Sprint Series races in 2024. As reported previously, PJ Reutimann, grandson of Florida racing legend Wayne Reutimann, is preparing to enter Florida dirt sprint car racing in 2024, with racing in two series, both Top Gun Sprints and the USCS national sprint car tour, included in their plans.\n\nThe Southern Sprint Car Series will lose a small number of race teams due to a new pavement sprint car event on Saturday in Las Vegas, but will still have some top teams competing for the 2023 point championship in attendance. The No. 5 sprint car, driven by Daniel Miller, may have an insurmountable point lead for two reasons. First, he and car owner Doug Kenny and his PCS Racing team have a 96-point lead in the driver points (eight top-five finishes) over the driver in second place, the No. 93 car driven by Dude Teate.Second, the No. 93 car will apparently not be entered and is not shown in the most recent entry list. In addition, although the season’s leading race winner, Davey Hamilton Jr. (four wins), will not be present, the following 2023 winners are entered: Steven Hollinger (two wins), Scotty Adema, Bo Hartley, and Colton Bettis (each with one win).\n\nDanny Martin Jr. at Bubba Raceway Park, 2014\n\nThe Top Gun Sprint Series season point chase will be decided by the two top 2023 point-getters, Danny Jones and Dustin Burtron. Jones leads Burtron by a 48-point margin, 2,112 points to 2,064 points. The point champion will be crowned on December 9, and the driver garnering the most wins may also be determined on that same date. As of today, both Steve Diamond Jr. and Danny Martin Jr. have three feature wins in 2023. No other driver has more than two wins. Danny Martin Jr. has a distinct advantage in taking the title of the winningest driver of the year in that all three of his wins have taken place at the track holding the December 9 race, East Bay Raceway Park.\n\nFlorida’s Open Wheel Racers and the Florida Governor’s Cup Race\n\nStory by Richard Golardi\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nWayne Reutimann, left, and Bobby Allison at Golden Gate Speedway, 1965 Governor's Cup late model race.\n\nThe current trend in Florida short-track racing in which drivers specialize in sprint car racing only, or maybe just pavement late model racing, was not always followed by the state’s short-track drivers. Wayne Reutimann, who made a habit of racing in three classes during the early years of racing at Tampa’s Golden Gate Speedway and built his late model driving skills at the track, was a two-time winner (1965 and ’73) of the premier late model race there, the Florida Governor’s Cup.\n\nOther multi-class drivers, considered experts in both sprint cars and late models, made a years-long effort to join Wayne as a Florida Governor’s Cup winner. This group included Jim Alvis Sr., Dave Scarborough, and Jim Childers. Although they racked up wins in other “Florida Triple Crown Series” late model races (Dave Scarborough won the 1982 Gulf Coast Classic at Sunshine Speedway, and Jim Childers won the Desoto 200 at Desoto Speedway in 1981), none of these three multi-class aces ever won the Florida Governor’s Cup. Jim Alvis Sr. may have come the closest to winning, dropping out near the end of the 1970 race after leading and dominating. But when his car’s rear end broke, it took him out of what looked like a sure win that year. It was theclosest he came to winning.\n\nHere's a look back at the 1965 Governor’s Cup race won by Wayne Reutimann, which I have ranked as the most exciting Governor’s Cup in the race’s history, and also the second and third most exciting races since the inception of the event in 1965:\n\nTop Three Most Exciting Florida Governor’s Cup Races Since 1965\n\n1) 1965 Governor’s Cup, Golden Gate Speedway, Sunday, November 14, 1965\n\nNovember 14, 1965, was race day at Golden Gate Speedway. The one-third-mile asphalt track was host to the first 200-lap Governor’s Cup, the Florida State Late Model Stock Car Championship. Bobby Allison, already a two-time NASCAR modified division champion, was bringing his number 312 Chevy late model. Allison started 26th and methodically worked his way through slower cars in order to catch leader Wayne Reutimann. After Wayne took the lead on the 23rd lap and Bobby caught up to the Reutimann Chevrolet number 00jr,the two drivers were locked in a two-car duel that lasted more than 150 laps. For many of those laps, the two cars frequently raced side-by-side, with Bobby on the outside lane and Wayne on the inside.Bobby was playing a waiting game, later explaining that he was waiting for Wayne to make a mistake. That never happened. Coming out of the fourth turn on the last lap, Allison made a final effort to pass when he saw Wayne’s car slide a little, and he got inside Wayne. The two cars made theirlast dash to the checkered flag almost even. The two best drivers in the field were going all-out to the finish, side-by-side.Wayne beat Bobby Allison to the line and won by less than a car length in a race considered by many fans and media as the mostexciting Governor’s Cup race finish. The two drivers had countless wins and hall-of-fame race-driving careers over the next few decades.\n\n2) 1977 Governor’s Cup, Golden Gate Speedway, Sunday, November 6, 1977\n\nEvents from the prior year’s race, the 1976 Governor’s Cup race, reverberated the following year. In ’76, the cars of Mark Malcuit and Robert Hamke collided on the front straight, sending Hamke’s car up and over Malcuit’s car.An instant later, Hamke’s car sliced through the front straight catch fence like a giant chainsaw.The number 74Chevrolet Nova was thrown back onto the track. The fence held (fortunately, no fans were injured) and the right front tire and suspension from Hamke’s shattered car were torn off. Hamke was uninjured and starter Johnny Hicks had cuts and bruises. Hamke was determined to return and win.\n\nRobert Hamke returned to the Governor’s Cup race in 1977, again with the same car wrecked in the race in ’76. During morning practice, the car’s brakes failed and itleft the track in the third turn, landing in the sand dune about 75 feet away. Hamke’s team made some hurried repairs to the car, finishing just in time to allow him to make the start. After a thrilling 110-lap battle for the race lead with Ed Howe, who was trying for his fourth straight win in the race, Hamke drove the home-built Chevy Nova, with its cracked oil pan leaking all the while, to the win.The crowd gave him a standing ovation, as they had a new driver to add to the elite few that they cheered for. Some called it the biggest upset in the history of the Governor’s Cup race.\n\n3) 1989 Governor’s Cup, New Smyrna Speedway, Saturday, November 4, 1989\n\nThe prior year’s race, the ’88 Governor’s Cup race, was memorable for two main reasons. It marked the first time that the Governor’s Cup was held at New Smyrna Speedway and it was won by a driver who had been trying to win the race for 17 years, Dick Anderson. Dick’s best prior race performance was in 1978, when he held onto second place behind a charging Dick Trickle, a late model legend who was so dominant that day that no one else seemed to have a chance.Anderson was beginning to feel like he had a jinx in this race before getting the win in ’88. He had won just about every other premier late model race in the state, and his son, Wayne, was also in the race, taking ninth.\n\n1989: Dick Anderson used to travel all over the country, chasing wins in the big late model races, but no more. It cost too much. He was cutting way back on the out-of-state races to concentrate on Florida. Winning the ’89 Governor’s Cup race was now a higher priority for him. After about half the starters in the 42-car field dropped out, LeRoy Porter and Dick Anderson were left to battle it out to the finish. Porter was fortunate to still be in the race after a big crash earlier in the day in hot laps. Porter spent much of the second half of the race trying to get around Anderson and take the lead.In the last five laps, he threw everything he had at the leading late model of Dick Anderson. Fans in the packed stands rose to their feet as one, sensing that Anderson was just hanging on and was about to be passed. But that pass didn’t happen and Dick had his second Governor’s Cup win. His son, Wayne, also became a multi-time race winner (1999, ’03, and ’08). That made the Anderson family the leading Governor’s Cup race-winning family with five career wins.\n\nNOTE: The 58th Annual Florida Governor’s Cup late model race will be held this Sunday, November 12 at New Smyrna Speedway. Some of the favorites to win as of today include a NASCAR Cup Series driver, William Byron; a 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series driver, Jesse Love (just signed to drive for Richard Childress Racing); and a Florida driver who has had great success recently in Midwest races, but is still striving to get his first Governor’s Cup race win, Stephen Nasse. There is an entrant who is descendedfrom a Florida sprint car and stock car racing legend – that is Bryton Horner, who is the great-grandson of Frank Riddle.\n\nReutimann Racing Team Confirms Their New Sprint Car Driver\n\nStory by Richard Golardi\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\nPJ Reutimann after a 2023 mini-sprint win\n\nThe Reutimann Racing Team, an iconic family team based in Zephyrhills, Florida, has a history of producing sprint car champions. The father and son duo of Wayne Reutimann and his son, Wayne Jr., have both won sprint car championships during their time driving sprint cars (other than Wayne Sr.’s 1988 TBARA championship, they were won racing on paved tracks). Wayne’s father, Emil, was a champion in both modified and stock car racing. Champions all, going back three generations. I have just confirmed that a member of the fourth generation of the Reutimann racing dynasty is preparing to enter sprint car racing in 2024.\n\nIn a discussion earlier today, Wayne Reutimann Sr. confirmed that his 14-year-old grandson, PJ Reutimann of Zephyrhills, will be moving up to dirt sprint car racing in 2024. PJ’s car owner will be Wayne “Pook” Reutimann Jr., his father. Wayne Sr. will act as his grandson’s mentor, team adviser, and driving coach, as he has done this year and last year when PJ raced a mini-sprint, and a micro-sprint before that. PJ, who is a freshman at Zephyrhills High School,got mini-sprint feature wins in Florida at Jacksonville International Raceway and Hendry County Motorsports Park. Those days of driving a mini-sprint as his main class of racing are now over for PJ. His father believes that now is the time for him to move up to 360-cubic-inch dirt sprint car racing in Florida and other select Southern states.\n\nWayne told me that there were several reasons for this decision to move up to sprint car racing in 2024. First, Wayne Jr. felt that the time was right. The local Florida dirt sprint car series, the Top Gun Series, has made a rule change to allow USCS/ASCS 360-cubic-inch engines next year (they weren’t allowed before 2024). That will allow the Reutimann team to purchase and use the same engine in both Top Gun Series racing (Florida) and the USCS Outlaw Thunder Tour (dirt 360 racing in Florida and other deep South and mid-South tracks). When ready, they intend to race in both series. The USCS dirt sprint car series has already announced a series of Floridaraces beginning in January 2024. Second, the amount of mini-sprint racing in Florida seems to be on a downward slope. At Jacksonville International Raceway, a track that seemed committed to having regular mini-sprint racing, there may beno further races. East Bay Raceway Park will close in about a year. Other tracks seem to be less committed or unwilling to host regular mini-sprint racing. Thirdly, PJ’s skill level has advanced sufficiently that his father feels he is ready for sprint car racing now.\n\nThere are still a few steps that will have to be completed before there is a Reutimann Racing Team sprint car ready for PJ. The team’s mini-sprint has been advertised for sale (currently listed on Facebook on Wayne Reutimann Jr.’s page). They don’t intend to race it again. The next step will be to purchase a dirt sprint car and 360 c.i. engine and get both ready for 2024 competition. A race shop owned by Wayne Jr. in Zephyrhills will be used to build the car and for their base of operations. Then the driver needs to be made ready. PJ has not yet gotten any practice laps in a sprint car. They intend to get practice on dirt first, with the intention to race only on dirt. Wayne told me that he believes his grandson will be ready for asphalt sprint car racing later, and that it will be to his advantage to get experience in a sprint car on both racing surfaces (as it was for the two previous generations of Reutimanns).\n\nWayne Sr. also mentioned his assessment that dirt sprint car racing will offer something that PJ didn’t get to experience much in Florida mini-sprint racing, and that was running different grooves on a dirt track. He wants his grandson to learn and improve his skill at knowing when to make the move from the bottom groove and when to sense that the top or middle groove will be faster and that the dirt up top has the best grip. The tracks in Florida don’t have enough banking to allow a driver to learn these skills, Wayne said. PJ did get an opportunity to race a mini-sprint in Pennsylvania this summerat a track that had multiple grooves and drivers who were ready to use all of them. PJ got to learn when to use the top groove and how to drive it. Another all-important portion of the learning curve was: going too far out there, slammingand then going over the cushion, and meeting the wall, up close. All part of learning the business of dirt racing.\n\nDue to the need to purchase a car and engine and get PJ prepared to compete in dirt sprint cars, the team has not set a date for their first race and they have not set a goal to be ready by a certain date, other than the intention to begin 360 dirt sprint car racing in 2024. I asked Wayne Sr., “Do you think PJ will be a future sprint car champion, just like his father and grandfather?” With three prior generations of racing champions in the family and championships earned on dirt and pavement in multiple classes of cars, Wayne Sr. did not hesitate in his answer.\n\n“Yes, I think so” he replied confidently.\n\nThe Night Will Cagle Retired, and the Next 37 Years of Racing\n\nStory and photos by Richard Golardi\n\nSeptember 21, 2023\n\nWhat a way to go out. In his last race, the legend won, and then he retired.\n\n“A legend retired Saturday night,” the reporter wrote. That was June 21, 1986, at Weedsport Speedway, New York.\n\nA storybook career, with tens of thousands of laps and hundreds and hundreds of winner’s circle celebrations, was over. A reporter had said it was so. Will said it, too, right in the winner’s circle.\n\nBut the legend wasn’t just a race driver, he was far more. Will Cagle retired as the most dominating big-block modified race driver of all time.\n\nThen he did what you’d expect him to do. He un-retired. The thrill of speed was just too enticing for him to stay away. There were more tracks and more race car types to conquer. So, he would undo that retirement decision and slam-dunk it into the trash can labeled “Life Decisions in Need of Revision.”\n\nWill Cagle at home in Tampa, Florida, July 2023, Richard Golardi Photo\n\nWill Cagle won an astounding 1,000 + feature races in a race-driving career that began in the early ’50s and which for all purposes was over by the summer of ’85 when the driveshaft in his dirt modified broke (at Weedsport Speedway) and tore into his leg, turning it into a twisted and broken mess. He was in the hospital for 33 days, caused when “the driveshaft went right through my leg.” The following spring, he was racing in Tampa and was leading the 1986 late model class points at the Florida State FairgroundsSpeedway when he left in late April for the annual trip up north. He headed back to the Northeast tracks.A couple of months later, he’d put a halt to driving full-time. He hadn’t been winning in the Northeast. Not like before. That’s when the decision to retire was made.\n\nHe didn’t completely retire from driving. Instead, he would be a part-time race driver. Now hewas the general manager at the same track just north of the New York/New Jersey border at which he had so much success as a driver, Middletown’s Orange County Fair Speedway. This turn of fate produced a scenario in which Will was not racing past a point when he was no longer competitive. Not a career cut short, but rather a career for the record books. It was not just the sheer volume of wins, most of them in the Penn-Jersey area and later in the upper New York circuit, but also a different measurement, one of dominating performance.\n\nWith the arrival of rules for the 1966 season that turned the big-block modified into the top-level class of Northeast dirt modified racing (it remains so to this day), Will’s record of wins for the 1966–1986 period in this class of modifieds made him the number one most dominating big-block modified driver of all time. Here are the facts: He averaged 22.5 big block modified wins per season, more than any other driver. Will’s wife, Barbara,has documented 472 career big-block modified wins. There were many more in super-modifieds, small-block modifieds, and others for the pre-’66 period. Some have claimed that his lifetime feature win total, maybe close to 1,100, is the best ever for any driver.\n\nWill Cagle Shows off a photo from early in his career in his Tampa home, July 2023, Richard Golardi Photo\n\nWill Cagle is a master storyteller and can compete with the best of them at weaving a tale about racing. He may tell a tale about racing a late model stock car at Tampa’s Golden Gate Speedway in 1962, when track owner Frank Dery spent the summer setting up phony “feuds” for Will with other legends such as Buzzie Reutimann and Cush Revette. Hyped in the Tampa newspapers, these feuds would reach their climax in a two-car match race the following Friday night. Or Will’s story may be about having a Hollywood movie star show up at a dirt track, where Will was waiting with his modified for them to get in some laps. There’s no passenger seat in a dirt modified, so Paul Newman was fortunate not to have his agent or the director of his current film (Slap Shot), which was shooting in Central New York, see him there. He was sitting in a car piloted by Will, hanging on to the roll bar, with no seat belt. There was a possibility that Newman may not still be in the car after Will threw it sideways into the turn, wide open.\n\nBeen there, drove that (and Will Cagle has driven lots of race car types): On September 12, 1970, Will had his best Indy car race finish, ninth place in the Hoosier Hundred at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis, at the time the second-biggest Indy car race. USAC Silver Crown racing came later in the decade (1978). He raced on the high banks of Daytona International Speedway a few times in the ’60s in the NASCAR Modified-Sportsman stock car division. When that terrifying 37-car crashhappened at Daytona in 1960, Will was in his ’55 Chevy and was right in the middle of it, followed by a short hospital stay.\n\nHe stacked up super-modified and modified championships in Florida (Golden Gate Speedway, Super-Modified Champion;and Florida-Georgia Modified Championship, 1962) and a few Northeast states(PA: Nazareth Speedway, and 1966 Langhorne Speedway Race of Champions; New York: Orange County Fair Speedway, Canandaigua Speedway, Rolling Wheels Raceway, Weedsport Speedway; and New Jersey: Alcyon Speedway, and East Windsor Speedway). Add in races driven in a midget, sprint car (won in Jack Nowling’s car at East Bay Raceway, March 1985), late model stock car, Trans Am sports car (’68 Chevy Camaro at Lime Rock Park, Connecticut, May 1972, his first “real” road race), Legends car (Charlotte, NC: placed third in 2010 Legends Masters final for drivers over 40, he was 72 and the oldest driver competing), and even a five-ton Mack truck(at the Florida State Fairgrounds Speedway, Tampa, February 1987) and you’ve got a career for the ages and an unforgettable story to tell.\n\nWill Cagle was inducted into six prominent auto racing halls of fame during his career. They are: (1) Harmony Speedway Hall of Fame; (2) Living Legends of Auto Racing; (3) Jacksonville Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame; (4) Eastern Motorsport Press Association Hall of Fame; (5) Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame; and (6) New York State Stock Car Association Hall of Fame.\n\nWill Cagle will be the speaker at the next monthly meeting of The Villages Motor Racing Fan Club and will be interviewed by racing journalist and author Richard Golardi on Wednesday, October 4 at 7 p.m. at the Colony Cottage Recreation Center, The Villages.Admission is limited to residents of The Villages.\n\nKaylee Bryson Interview – Pavement Sprint Cars and Beyond\n\nStoryby Richard Golardi\n\nAugust17, 2023\n\n“I’m not really used to running pavement open-wheel,” sprint car and champ car driver Kaylee Bryson told me. Speaking about her opportunity to race in the 500 Sprint Car Tour with a pavement sprint car from the Sam Pierce Chevrolet race team, she was recently at the high-banked Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway asphalt oval. “It’s gone pretty well so far,” Kaylee said, commenting on the season’s first half. “Last time I ran with the 500 Sprint Car Tour, I got fifth. It’s a new series for me, it’s a new learning aspect. I think we’re doing good so far.”\n\nTeam Manager Aaron Pierce with driver Kaylee Bryson.\n\nI mentioned to Kaylee that I had spoken to Aaron Pierce and that the Sam Pierce Chevrolet-sponsored team plans to have a car for her for next year’s Little 500, a race that is the ultimate endurance test for a pavement sprint car driver. “Yeah, we’re going to have a car there, for sure. We’re probably going to have three cars possibly. It’ll be pretty exciting. It was my first time going last year, and just going and watching Tanner [Swanson] lead laps and the heartbreak that the motor let us down, but watching Tanner lead laps and seeing how fast our cars are is making me really excited for next year.”\n\nThe longest race that she has driven in is “Probably 146 laps – in Silver Crown cars,” Kaylee said. That was at the Hoosier Hundred, which was held at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park on the Friday night before this year’s Little 500, and was a 100-mile race. For Kaylee, the two-hour, or more, Little 500 will be “For sure my longest race. But I feel I’ve gotten pretty used to running longer races and endurance races for sure, so I don’t think it will be too much difference for me because of the experience in Silver Crown.”\n\nI asked Kaylee about the upcoming final 500 Sprint Car Tour races and the remaining second half of the 2023 racing season and what she is looking forward to the most. “I’m looking forward to the rest of the Silver Crown schedule. You know, we’re third in points right now.” Her current USAC Silver Crown point position as a rookie in the series puts her ahead of other Silver Crown series rookies such as Tyler Roahrig, Dakoda Armstrong, and Wayne Johnson. “It’snew for me, running all these new tracks I’ve never been to. To be able to go to Springfield, to go to Du Quoin for the first time and I’m looking forward to being on dirt in a Silver Crown car.”\n\nDoing so well in the Silver Crown point race leads to an obvious next goal for Kaylee – win a USAC Silver Crown race. Does she have a choice of track for that first win? “Any track – I don’t care!” she responded. “I just want to win one. But I think it would be pretty cool to do it at Springfield or Du Quoin – one of the dirt tracks, considering that I grew up on those.” Kaylee explained that she is more of a dirt racer, so getting her first Silver Crown series win at an iconic American dirt track would be more satisfying for her. Regarding the dirt-to-pavement transition she is taking part in now: “I feel like no matter where I’m going, I’m learning something new. I’ve jumped in so many different cars and I’m just starting to get used to everything right now.”\n\nRJ Johnson is Lone Floridian at Knoxville Nationals\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nKnoxville, Iowa,August 13, 2023\n\nKnoxville, Iowa, is a place many consider to be sprint car nirvana. It certainly has the most passionate fans and fantastic, high-drama dirt sprint car racing at a place called Knoxville Raceway.After my first trip to the Knoxville Nationals this weekend, I was fortunate to participate in a book signing in the lobby of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame and Museum in Knoxville. I noted that of the 52 sprint car drivers in the Knoxville Sprint Car Nationals on Wednesday night and the 54 drivers on Thursday night, there was a total of one driver with a Florida hometown, RJ Johnson of Tampa in car No. 121 (Thursday night). That's kind of sad – I’m sure that I’m one of many that wished there were more Floridians in the national dirt series.\n\nAt 36 years old, RJ’s maturity and poise have grown during his decades of racing. With his father (Florida sprint car racing legend Roland Johnson) at his side as his car owner and mentor, the Tampa native had many successes while a young racer. He was USCS Sprint Car Rookie of the Year in 2004and East Bay Raceway Park Sprint Car Champion in 2007. He was racing 360s at Knoxville in 2008 (moving there in April 2008) and got a 360 feature win at Knoxville Raceway before making the move to the ultra-competitive Knoxville 410 class full-time in 2014 (after a half-season of 410s in 2013 subbing for an injured Brooke Tatnall). Then he earned the Rookie of the Year title in the 410 class at Knoxville Raceway in 2014.“It’s the toughest weekly show in the country,” RJ once told me.\n\nRJ is now married and living in Knoxville, Iowa, but he’ll always have a Florida connection.Beginning with racing 360s at Knoxville, as he had in Florida previously, he later added World of Outlaws and All Star series races when the Knoxville racing season concluded. After earning the 410 class Rookie of the Year title, hereturned to seek his first Knoxville 410 feature race win. RJ Johnson is the only driver with a Florida hometown in the 2023 Knoxville Nationals.\n\nThe new ride for this year’s Knoxville Nationals was just finalized last week, so his mother and father, Roland Johnson, were unable to be there due to an out-of-town vacation previously planned. RJ is enjoying one of his new roles as \"Daddy RJ.\" He's recently a new father and smiled as he described how happy he was in this new role. He said that this was his first time back behind the wheel of a sprint car in two years and he was apparently greatly enjoying himself. A moment later he was behind the wheel and ready to return to the Knoxville Raceway dirt, a place he knew well from his previous time as a weekly racer. A glint in his eye still shone through his face shield and inside his helmet there was surely a smile.\n\nBilly Wease Rocks on the Nashville High Banks, Then Strums a Victory Guitar\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nNashville, TN, July30, 2023\n\nBill Wease, feature race winner, 500 Sprint Car Tour, 7-29-2023\n\nFrom his qualifying time, just a tick over 18 seconds (sixth-fastest) on Saturday at the high-banked Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway asphalt oval, you might think that Billy Wease wasn’t going to compete with the three fastest qualifiers (Jake Trainor, Kyle O’Gara, and Kody Swanson). But you’d be wrong in that assumption. Jake Trainor, still new to asphalt sprint car racing and the winner of the Little 500 in Mayin his second sprint car race, not only looked fast but sounded fast. Something under the hood of the No. 29 Matt Seymour Racingsprint car (or maybe it was in the exhaust?) just sounded powerful, like a lion under extreme stress, roaring at its brain-bursting loudest. After an invert of six cars, Jake started in sixth and wasn’t a factor to win, pulling into the pits with three laps to go due to engine overheating.\n\nThe invert put Billy Wease and Bobby Santos III on the front row, and Wease powered away to an early lead. Santos and Kody Swanson moved up to challenge, but since both sprint cars and stock cars had stayed away from the second groove in the banking and there was no rubber up above the bottom groove, neither could pass.Both mounted an attack on the lead, but a damp, slippery track made that an unsurmountable goal while Billy Wease never made a misstep. The 36-year-old Wease led every lap for his first feature win in the 500 Sprint Car Tour, a fitting victory for a racer who has made a decades-long commitment to pavement sprint car racing and the Little 500.\n\nTop Three Finishers, Billy Wease, Bobby Santos III, and Kody Swanson, 500 Sprint Car Tour, 7-29-2023\n\nBilly and second-place Bobby Santos III (his brother-in-law) slapped each other on the back and shared a joyful hug in the winner’s circle. The winner’s trophy, appropriately a slick-looking guitar at a track in “Music City,” was raucously strummed by Billy in the winner’s circle while he showed his winning smile to the TV cameraman. I’ve got a feeling that smile may still be there on Billy’s face, even though we are now approaching 24 hours since his big Saturday night win and boisterous, strumming victory guitar celebration. Now that’s music to a sprint car driver’s ears.\n\nTroy Carey’s Somewhat Excellent, Somewhat Frustrating Indiana Sprint Week Adventure\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nJuly 28, 2023\n\nTroy Carey crossed the Pacific Ocean in his halfway around the world journey from Tullamore, New South Wales, Australia, to come to America to race a sprint car in USAC’s Indiana Sprint Week. The 48-year-old trucking businessman has been driving sprint cars for nine years and never raced before then. “I was a bull rider before that,” Troy said. “I never raced a thing. After riding bulls and the adrenaline and fun you get out of one of those, I had to find something that was a little bit safer, or I thought it was a little bit safer. It’s something that will give you the same adrenaline rush!”\n\nTroy Carey at Circle City Raceway, Indianapolis, 7-24-2023\n\n“I’m racing non-wing sprint cars, 410s,” Troy explained, “competing all over Indiana. We went down into Illinois and raced at Macon Speedway the other week, but mostly around Indiana and we’re based out of Kokomo at the moment.” Monday night at Circle City Raceway in Indianapolis was one of those nights that had a frustrating moment. It occurred after a USAC official checked their tires after a qualifying run and told them there was a problem. “We went out and qualified, wasn’t the best qualifying we’ve ever done so it’s probably not going to really hurt us. We ended up being disqualified because we had the wrong compound tire on. Wasn’t aware of it and we probably should have been. We can’t blame anyone else but the team. We should have checked on it.” Troy was still able to continue competing for the rest of the USAC National sprint car event but lost that qualifying time. “It’s our fault – we take it on the chin and we go from there.”\n\nNo. 45n car of Troy Carey of Australia at Circle City Raceway\n\nTroy said about his plans for this week, “Then we head down to Terre Haute, back to Lincoln Park, Bloomington, then finish it off on Saturday night at Haubstadt [Tri-State Speedway]. Yeah, we’ll do every show, all eight shows [of USAC Indiana Sprint Week]. We’ve got a spare car. As long as we don’t tear two cars up, we’ll do every one of them. And then, we’re hanging around, we’ve got a steel block motor and we’re going to come and run a few steel block shows and they’ve got a steel block nationals – hopefully getting around to doing that. Then we’re going to hang around and do Smackdown at Kokomo at the end of August. Yeah, we’ll be here around 10 weeks.” But, Troy won’t be doing any commuting back to Australia during his American Summer. “No, not going back and forth. Too far, too big of a trip. Going home, you lose two days doing that. You’re better off staying over here trying to get a few more laps in at different tracks.”\n\nRacing down under in Australia: “We run non-wings in Australia but obviously don’t have these motors in them. We’re about 550 horsepower up in this motor compared to what we run in Australia so it’s a fair bit different. Car setup’s a lot different, driving them’s a lot different. You’ve got to really back these cars in, where at home, you can sort of turn them in. But, basic setup is exactly the same in the way the car’s built, but when you come to a race setup, they’re very different. There’s a lot more stagger. At home, we’re at about 220 horsepower.” In his car at Circle City, the engine he had was measured on the dyno at well over 700 horsepower. Broadsliding, throttle control, and using as much of that available horsepower as possible took some getting used to for Troy. The additional ready horsepower required changes to his driving habits.\n\nIn his Australian sprint car racing, Troy has gotten “a state title and a rookie title and we’ve won a fair bit in Darwin, raced a lot in Darwin. We’ve always been really competitive in New South Wales, but as for Australian titles, we’ve never got one of those. I think the best I’ve gotten on an Australian title is eighth on the main night, so we’re still a long way off getting one of those but we won’t stop trying.” He turns 49 on the first of August, so Troy Carey’s ability and determination and friendly demeanor mean there will be a lot more racing and surely a lot more friends in America that will be watching and cheering for him.\n\nTyler Roahrig and Statham Construction Racing Team Take on Must See Racing Sprint Series\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nPlymouth, Indiana driver Tyler Roahrig’s latest sprint car racing endeavor is taking him into more winged sprint car racing this summer, and he has recently been assigned to the seat in the bright orange and white No. 36 winged pavement sprint car with the Statham Construction Racing team from Florida. This team has had an enviable record of success in Florida pavement sprint car racing, and after a short respite from active racing, has recently returned with the same colors, owner and sponsor (Statham Construction owned by Ken and Theresa Statham), and car number. The graphics and color design on the Hurricane chassis are reminiscent of the colors previously used on the Marlboro Formula 1 team cars.\n\nTyler Roahrig at Birch Run Speedway, July 21, 2023\n\nI spoke to Tyler Roahrig during last Friday’s Must See Racing Sprint Series race at Birch Run Speedway in Birch Run, Michigan, and asked Tyler to tell me about all the things that were new for him that night. “Just some winged sprint car racing,” Tyler said, “here with the Statham Construction team. They got a hold of me about a month ago and asked if I wanted to do some racing and of course, I said yes. It’s a top-flight car and team. So, I haven’t done much winged racing in a while, so, we’ll see how it goes.” Tyler stated that this was his first race with this team and that they contacted him after seeing him win with another team in a Michigan sprint car race. “They asked if I wanted to run their car at Berlin tomorrow night [a Must See Racing event on July 22] and I said I said yeah, and that we might as well come to Birch Run, too [Friday, July 21 race]. So, here we are. I want to race for them as much as I can. We haven’t really talked about it, though. But, we’ll just kind of see how this weekend goes and move on from there. I think we both want to do some more racing. We haven’t really set anything in stone. I’m sure we’ll talk about it and see. I want to race for them as much as I can.”\n\nTyler Roahrig in Statham Construction car, July 21, 2023\n\nAfter not seeing Tyler at the wheel of the No. 19 Legacy Autosport USAC Silver Crown car at Winchester Speedway for the Silver Crown race the night before, Thursday, July 20, I asked why he did not drive that car at Winchester (Caleb Armstrong drove the No. 19 car), and Tyler indicated that he will no longer be driving the car. I mentioned that maybe that leaves more time for sprint car racing, with added winged pavement races. “No,” Tyler remarked. “This [winged pavement racing opportunity] came about before that [leaving the No. 19 USAC Silver Crown team car]. You never know – I might have a Silver Crown team out of my own shop next year.” And maybe some engines from Evan Jackson for that new USAC Silver Crown team? “That’s the only engine I’ll ever run,” Tyler confidently proclaimed. I asked if that is because engines from Evan Jackson Racing Engines are so dependable and powerful, don’t fail when put under maximum-stress racing conditions, and he has such a good working relationship with Evan, and Tyler responded, “I mean, pretty much. It’s just that he’s one of my best friends, for one. And, me and him have had a lot of success together, whether it be in late models or sprint cars or anything. I don’t see any need to change. He’s more than just an engine builder. He’s one of my best friends and he knows how to work on a race car, too, not just the engine. He’s very smart on all aspects of the race car and he’s very good to have at the race track.”\n\nI remarked that they, Tyler and Evan, have been together for a while in Little 500 and other non-wing pavement sprint car racing, and with many success stories, so why would anyone desire to break up such a successful, top-level team? “Exactly,” Tyler stated, and then added, “I wouldn’t do it!”\n\nAaron Pierce is Back in Big Cars\n\nStory and Photo by Richard Golardi\n\nJuly 22, 2023\n\nThe location was Winchester Speedway, Indiana, and the occasion was the only open-wheel race of the year on “The Hills” of the high-banked, paved half-mile race tracks of Indiana. The USAC Silver Crown Series champ cars were back at Winchester on Thursday night for an annual visit and also returning was champion driver Aaron Pierce of the Daleville, Indiana, Sam Pierce Chevrolet team. You’ve been seeing less of Aaron in asphalt sprint car and champ car racing lately for a few reasons, and I’ll let him explain why later in this story. The No. 26 Sam Pierce car (both sprint car and USAC Silver Crown champ car) has still been seen lately, but with the names Chris Windom, Tanner Swanson, and Kaylee Bryson on the side.\n\nSam Pierce Chevrolet team car for Aaron Pierce at Winchester Speedway.\n\nThen Aaron decided to get back behind the wheel of a USAC champ car for this week’s race at Winchester Speedway, but as a teammate to the primary car for Kaylee Bryson, with Aaron in the No. 126 car and Kaylee in the No. 26. The track can be tough on equipment, with big bumps in the uneven asphalt and high speeds straining suspension and engine parts. Once dark descends, the cars up in the banks that are spewing sparks from their undersides are providing bright orange evidence of the pounding they are taking.\n\nI asked Aaron to reveal what led to his decision to get back in a USAC Silver Crown car? “We came over and tested on Tuesday,” Aaron told me on Thursday, “and it went really good and was really comfortable and the car was fast and I love this place, so I didn’t want to miss out on a good car here, for sure.” Regarding having a two-car team, he said, “As long as everything goes smooth, it’s not that big a deal. If something happens to her car, I’m going to get out and let her drive this one, obviously, because she’s running for points. But, I’ve got enough good help down here that it’s going pretty smooth right now.” Aaron remarked that he believes his last race in a Silver Crown car was at “Springfield or Du Quoin, two years ago. Last year, Chris Windom drove here, and Kaylee ran the miles.”\n\nCould a return to sprint car racing also be near for Aaron? “Oh, yeah. For sure. I want to come down to Florida and race this winter some and I’ve been testing over at Anderson a few times, still running some Trans Am. So, I haven’t been totally out of it.” In addition to the frequent Trans Am road races in the past two years, Aaron has had another project that he has been devoted to during this time. “Getting my driver development program going has been really big, and Kaylee is an awesome driver and she’s young, she’s easy to get along with, she’s a really good shoe and I’m just trying to get her going good on the pavement because she already hauls ass on the dirt. I’m trying to get her an array of experience. She’s driven nine different cars this year, from Trans Am, to winged cars and non winged cars, [Trans Am Corvette] SGT, to [Trans Am Camaro] TA2, just all kinds of stuff! So, I’ve had her busy.” And these nine different cars were all for Aaron and his AP Driver Development program (whose website asks, “Wanna race?” and then provides a way to scratch that itch: “Drive our race cars!”). An obvious motivation that was not mentioned was the need that NASCAR has for more female drivers in their three national series, and Kaylee is getting experience at road courses, as well as at dirt and pavement ovals, which puts her and Aaron, her mentor, in a prime position to make the move up when she is ready and NASCAR is ready.\n\n“Next year we’ll probably do the same thing as far as run all the Silver Crown stuff. I want to get her some more Trans Am experience over the winter, and then hopefully pick and choose the races we want to go to with Trans Am.” And what about the Little 500 (a race that Aaron has not driven in since 2021), I asked? “Little 500 – I’m not for sure yet what I’m going to do.

I still do all the setups, work on the cars, and build all the shocks,” he added. On race day, he manages the team as well as the pit strategy with the pit crew that he has selected and trained. The day after the race, it’s back to the race shop and the cycle starts all over again preparing for the next race, wherever that may be ... Winchester, Road Atlanta, Springfield, Watkins Glen, or another track.\n\nSteven Hollinger and Mac Steele are the Hottest Race Team in Florida This Summer\n\nStory and Photos by Richard Golardi\n\nJuly 7, 2023\n\nVeteran 83-year-old sprint car owner Mac Steele is a pretty good judge of driving talent. He noticed the open-wheel race driving expertise displayed by Steven Hollinger when he was a teenage TQ midget driver racing on Florida short tracks. Steven could be seen in the pits with his father Rex Hollinger, the 2012 TBARA sprint car Rookie of the Year. In the ensuing years, back when there was still an active TQ midget series in Florida, you could find the father/son duo racing "
