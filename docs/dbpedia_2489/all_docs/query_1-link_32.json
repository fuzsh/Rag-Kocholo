At an average speed of 170.722 mph (274.750 km/h), it was the fastest 500-mile Indy car race to that point.\n\nNearly the entire race unfolded as a three-way battle between polesitter Rick Mears, Bobby Rahal, and Kevin Cogan. Cogan, who was a key fixture in the controversial crash on the opening lap of the 1982 race, took the lead in dramatic fashion with 13 laps to go. Cogan, driving for Patrick Racing, appeared to be on his way to victory, and career redemption. But on lap 194, his lead evaporated when a spin by Arie Luyendyk brought out the caution flag. After a quick cleanup, the green flag came back out with two laps to go. Second place Bobby Rahal got the jump on the restart and grabbed the lead. Rahal pulled away and won the race, with car owner Jim Trueman, stricken with cancer, cheering him on in the pit area. Trueman died eleven days after the victory.[5][6] At the time, it was the closest three-car finish in Indy history.\n\nThe race was sanctioned by USAC, and was included as part of the 1986 CART PPG Indy Car World Series. For the first time, ABC Sports televised the race live \"flag-to-flag\" on network television in the United States. The race celebrated the 75th anniversary of the first 500, but there was very little fanfare of the milestone outside of the cover art of the official program.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nGarage area\n\n[edit]\n\nThe highlight of offseason improvements at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was the construction of a new, state of the art garage area. Just days after the 1985 race, the old Gasoline Alley garage area, most of which had stood since the 1940s, was dismantled and demolished.[7] Official groundbreaking for the new facility occurred on August 26, 1985.[8] The new concrete garages increased to 96 units (up from 88), and each stall provided approximately 30% more working room than their predecessors. The green and white wooden barn doors were replaced with overhead steel garage doors, and the layout was changed from east–west to north–south.[9][10][11] The access lanes were widened substantially, improving ingress and egress, improving drainage, and various vendor and support units were also part of the new complex. Lastly, a refueling complex was constructed in the southeast corner, including two underground tanks, one each for methanol and gasoline fuels.[8] Most of the work was completed in April, however, some of the finishing touches were still being completed during the first week of on-track activity.\n\nThough the new garages were universally praised for their increased space and function, they were criticized for lack of aesthetics, and for breaking tradition.[12] The plain precast concrete walls resembled the cookie-cutter stadiums of the era that were largely criticized in baseball and football. The design was a sharp and striking contrast to the previous garage complex, which led some to call them overtly plain or \"antiseptic.\"[13] Changing the layout to north–south based was also a thinly-veiled attempt by the management to further scale back the oft-rowdy \"Snakepit\" area formerly located inside the turn one infield. The interiors were spacious and without walls (except those adjacent to the middle corridors), allowing teams the flexibility to erect partitions as they saw fit, as well as layout their work area however they desired. Lastly, the new complex greatly improved safety. The old wooden buildings were criticized as potential \"fire traps,\"[14] and management did not want a repeat of the devastating 1941 fire. The concrete construction was more fire-resistant, water spigots were provided in every stall, and the wider lanes provided easier fire escape.\n\nVictory lane\n\n[edit]\n\nA new victory lane area was constructed for the 1986 race. From 1971 to 1985, the winner drove up the checkerboard ramps into the \"horseshoe\" area below the Master Control Tower. A hydraulic platform was now used, which was located in the actual pit area, in line with the pit stalls. The car would drive onto the platform, and it would raise into the air, and then slowly spin 360° for the fans to see the winner.\n\nThis victory lane was popular, but could only a hold a small number of people when raised. It would be used through 1993.\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 19, 1985, after 15 years of being shown tape delayed, ABC Sports signed an initial three-year deal to cover the Indianapolis 500 live flag-to-flag starting in 1986.[15][16] Longtime anchor Jim McKay was moved to the host position, and play-by-play would be handled by Jim Lampley and Sam Posey.[17]\n\nThe Daytona 500 had been shown live flag-to-flag on CBS since 1979, and NBC carried the Michigan 500 live beginning in 1981. ABC officials had wanted to do the same for Indianapolis for several years. ABC's landmark telecast was scheduled to feature 32 cameras, three RaceCams, and an hour-long live pre-race.\n\nTeam and driver changes\n\n[edit]\n\nDefending Indy 500 winner Danny Sullivan returned to Penske Racing, however, the rest of the team saw a shake-up from the previous year. Rick Mears suffered a serious crash at Sanair in 1984. In 1985, Mears only drove a partial schedule (ovals only, including Indy). For the 1985 season, Al Unser, Sr. drove full-time, as a substitute for Mears. Unser won the 1985 CART championship in dramatic fashion. At the final race of the season at Tamiami Park, Unser Sr. clinched the championship by 1 point over his son Al Unser Jr. For 1986, however, Unser Sr. dropped down to a part-time schedule only. Unser would race the three 500-mile race (Indy, Michigan, and Pocono), along with Phoenix and Tamiami. Unser was assigned the duty of rolling out the brand new PC-15/Ilmor-Chevy Indy V-8.\n\nKevin Cogan moved over from the Kraco Team to Patrick Racing. Cogan joined Emerson Fittipaldi to expand the team to a two-car effort. Fittipaldi's new livery for 1986 featured a sponsor returning to the sport after a lengthy absence. Marlboro, which had abruptly left the sport of Indy car racing in 1971,[18] returned and would become a major part of the series for 25 years.\n\nBobby Rahal won three of the last six races of 1985, and finished third in the points standings. Despite a heavy crash at Michigan in August, and a testing crash in the fall at Indy, Rahal was hot off the finish of the 1985 season, returning with Truesports, and a favorite entering the season.\n\nBorg-Warner Trophy\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the month of May 1986, the Borg-Warner Trophy celebrated its 50th anniversary sporting a new look, featuring a brand new three-row base. The likeness of the 1986 race winner was going to fill the body of the trophy, and the new base was constructed in order to accommodate winners through 2003. On the base, the first square was filled with a gold likeness of the late Speedway president Tony Hulman. The base increased the height of the trophy to 55 inches, and the weight to about 95 pounds.\n\nRace schedule\n\n[edit]\n\nRace schedule — April/May 1986 Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nROP 26\n\nROP 27\n\nROP 28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nPractice 4\n\nPractice 5\n\nPractice 6\n\nPractice 7\n\nPractice 8\n\nPractice 9\n\nPractice 10\n\nPole Day 11\n\nTime Trials 12\n\nPractice 13\n\nPractice 14\n\nPractice 15\n\nPractice 16\n\nPractice 17\n\nTime Trials 18\n\nBump Day 19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nCarb Day 23\n\nMini-Marathon 24\n\nParade 25\n\nIndy 500 26\n\nIndy 500 27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\nPractice 31\n\nIndy 500\n\nPractice - Week 1\n\n[edit]\n\nPractice started on Opening Day, Saturday, May 3. Chip Ganassi earned the honor of first car on the track.[19][20][21] Michael and Mario Andretti led the speed chart for the day, both over 210 mph (340 km/h).[20] On the second day of practice, the Andrettis continued their dominance, again posting the top two speeds.[20]\n\nOn Tuesday, May 6, three single cars crashes marked the first incidents of the month.[20] Danny Ongais, Herm Johnson, and Johnny Parsons all suffered single-car crashes in turn one, with Johnson's the most serious. Around 3:30 p.m., a piece of bodywork flew off Johnson's car in turn 1, which caused him to break into a hard spin. His car hit nearly head on into the retaining wall, and he suffered serious fractures to his feet and back.[19][21]\n\nPenske teammates Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan nudged the speeds up over 214 mph (344 km/h) by Wednesday, May 7, then the day ended early due to a rain shower.[19][20] On Thursday, May 8, Emerson Fittipaldi joined them as the third driver over 214 mph (344 km/h).[20]\n\nBy Friday, May 9, the last practice session before pole day, seven drivers were over 214 mph (344 km/h), with Mears still the fastest of the month at 214.694 mph (345.517 km/h).[20] The only incident of the day was a suspension failure and spin by Johnny Rutherford, but no wall contact resulted.[19]\n\nTime Trials - First weekend\n\n[edit]\n\nPole Day - Saturday May 10\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the morning practice on Saturday, May 10, Rick Mears set an all-time unofficial track record, at 217.548 mph (350.110 km/h).[20][21] Later in the session, Michael Andretti and Bobby Rahal both broke the 216 mph (348 km/h) barrier.[20] No incidents were reported.\n\nMario Andretti took the honor of first-in-the-field, with a qualifying run of 212.300 mph (341.664 km/h).[20] Three cars later, defending Indy winner Danny Sullivan took the provisional pole with a new track record of 215.382 mph (346.624 km/h).[19][20] Sullivan's speed did not hold up long, however. About an hour later, Rick Mears blistered the track with a new track record.[19][20]\n\nLap 1 – 41.364 seconds, 217.581 mph (new 1-lap track record)\n\nLap 2 – 41.451 seconds, 217.124 mph\n\nLap 3 – 41.503 seconds, 216.852 mph\n\nLap 4 – 41.712 seconds, 215.765 mph\n\nTotal – 2:46.030, 216.828 mph (new 4-lap track record)\n\nMears secured his third Indy pole position, and the Penske teammates would line up 1st–2nd. The one-lap and four-lap track records set by Mears would stand for two years. Michael Andretti squeezed himself onto the front row, with a run of 214.522 mph (345.240 km/h), faster than his father Mario. It would be Michael's only front row start at Indy. Emerson Fittipaldi ran two laps over 213 mph (343 km/h), but a flat tire slowed his average to just over 210 mph (340 km/h). Bobby Rahal managed one lap over 214 mph (344 km/h), and qualified 4th.[20][21]\n\nWith about ten minutes left in the session, A. J. Foyt lined up to make an attempt, but his car failed technical inspection, and he was sidelined for the day. Geoff Brabham got out just before the 6 o'clock gun, and completed his run at 207.082 mph. Brabham was slowest car of the day, but ultimately he would hang on to make the field. After qualifying was concluded for the day, the cars of Raul Boesel and Dick Simon, both of the same team, were disqualified for a faulty pop-off valve fitting.[19][20][21]\n\nSecond day - Sunday May 11\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter missing out on a qualifying attempt on pole day, A. J. Foyt took to the track to qualify for his 29th career Indy 500. He posted the 5th fastest speed overall in the field, but since he was a second day qualifier, he lined up deep in the field.\n\nRaul Boesel re-qualified his machine, after being disqualified a day earlier.[20][21] At the close of the day, the field was filled to 28 cars.[19]\n\nPractice – Week 2\n\n[edit]\n\nRain delayed the opening of practice on Monday, May 12, and only 21 cars took laps Tuesday (May 13). Two-time winner Gordon Johncock planned to end a one-year retirement, and purchase a back-up car from Penske. However his funding fell through at the last minute, and he was forced to sit out the race.\n\nThe biggest story of the week came on Tuesday May 14. Mario Andretti was practicing his already qualified car. A suspension piece failed, and he crashed hard into the turn 3 wall. Andretti suffered lacerations to his left heel, and abrasions to both knees, but he was not seriously injured. Newman/Haas Racing would spend the next several days trying to make repairs, and even sent the car's tub back to the Lola factory in England for reconstruction. Andretti's 5th-place starting position was in jeopardy if they were unable to rebuild the car. Two days later, Andretti was cleared to drive, and he soon started shaking down his back-up car. By the end of the week, the team announced that Andretti would drive the back-up car in the race. He was moved to the rear of the starting grid.\n\nThe remainder of the week saw sparse track activity. Most cars on the track belonged to yet-unqualified drivers. Thursday, May 15 was almost a complete wash out due to a thunderstorm.\n\nTime Trials - Second weekend\n\n[edit]\n\nThird Day - Saturday May 17\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite threatening weather for the next two days, the third day of qualifying saw only four additional cars added to the field. Jim Crawford was the fastest of the day, over 209 mph (336 km/h). Dick Simon, who was disqualified the previous weekend, put his car back into the field with a speed of 204.978 mph (329.880 km/h).\n\nThe day ended with one position left vacant in the field.\n\nBump Day - Sunday May 18\n\n[edit]\n\nAs many as twelve cars started the day with hopes to make the field on the final day of time trials. Rain kept the track closed until 3 p.m., with qualifying finally getting underway at 4 p.m. By late afternoon, however, several cars were pulled out of line and chose not to make an attempt.\n\nGeorge Snider went out first in an Foyt back-up car, and filled the field to 33 cars. That placed Dick Simon on the bubble as the slowest car in the field. After a wave-off by Steve Chassey, Gary Bettenhausen took to the track. Bettenhausen bumped his way into the field with ease.\n\nWith Geoff Brabham on the bubble, and rain quickly approaching, Rick Miaskiewicz was the next car out. His first two laps were not nearly fast enough, and his team waved him off. That gave Derek Daly just enough time to get out on the track. His first two laps were fast enough to bump Brabham, but as he was completing his second lap, the skies poured rain, and the run was halted.\n\nGeoff Brabham held on as the slowest car in the field, while Dick Simon, the only car bumped, stood as the first alternate. Qualifying for the day lasted less than 45 minutes.\n\nCarburetion Day\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Thursday, May 22, the final scheduled practice session was held. All 33 qualified cars except Phil Krueger took practice laps. First alternate Dick Simon also took laps. Krueger's crew discovered a water leak and elected to stay in the garage to rebuild the engine. At 11:43 a.m., a major crash occurred. A brake rotor on Dennis Firestone's car exploded, blowing his left rear tire. He spun wildly out of turn four. Roberto Moreno was following closely behind, and veered to the inside in attempt to avoid the crash. Both cars spun into the inside wall, and Firestone slammed into the pit-entrance barrier, splitting the car in half. Moreno tagged the inside wall, and continued to spin through the pits, running into the back of George Snider's car, then crashing into the parked car of Josele Garza. Snider was pushed into the grass strip dividing the track from the pit lane, and hit that backside of that wall. Garza's teammate Johnny Parsons avoided the incident only because his crew had just dispatched him out of the pits seconds earlier.\n\nNone of the drivers were seriously injured, however, Firestone's car was destroyed, and the team had no back-up car. Two pit crew members were treated for minor injuries, as well as one spectator. The following day, Firestone's car was formally withdrawn from the starting field. George Snider and Roberto Moreno announced they would be driving back-up cars in the race. Both of those cars were moved to the back of the grid joining Mario Andretti. After Firestone withdrew, the first alternate Dick Simon was awarded the 33rd starting position.\n\nRick Mears led the speed chart for the afternoon, with a hand-timed lap of 212.7 mph (342.3 km/h).\n\nPit Stop Contest\n\n[edit]\n\nThe semifinals and finals for the 10th annual Miller Pit Stop Contest were held on Thursday May 22. The top three race qualifiers and their respective pit crews were automatically eligible: Rick Mears, Danny Sullivan, and Michael Andretti. However, Mears declined the invitation. Bobby Rahal (who qualified 4th) took that empty spot.[22] On Friday May 16, pit stop contest preliminaries were held to fill the fourth and final spot. Emerson Fittipaldi was the fastest and advanced to the semifinals.[22]\n\nTwo semifinal matches were held. The fastest two teams (measured by elapsed time) would advance to the final round, regardless of the respective head-to-head results. Teams were required to change two tires and simulate a fuel coupling. In the first semifinal, Danny Sullivan clocked in at 12.253 seconds, and Bobby Rahal finished in 13.206 seconds. In the second semifinal round, Emerson Fittipaldi faced Michael Andretti. Sullivan and Rahal advanced to the finals. For the final round, teams were required to change all four tires and again simulate a fuel coupling. Danny Sullivan (Penske Racing) led bychief mechanic Chuck Sprague, defeated Bobby Rahal (Truesports) led by Steve Horne. Sullivan won the event for the second year in a row, and it was Penske's fifth win overall in the event.[23]\n\nSemifinals Finals 1 Danny Sullivan\n\n(Penske Racing) 12.253 3 Bobby Rahal\n\n(Truesports) 13.206 1 Danny Sullivan\n\n(Penske Racing) 20.288 3 Bobby Rahal\n\n(Truesports) 22.734 20 Emerson Fittipaldi\n\n(Patrick Racing) 14.456 18 Michael Andretti\n\n(Kraco Enterprises) 15.292\n\nStarting grid\n\n[edit]\n\nRow Inside Middle Outside 1 Rick Mears W Danny Sullivan W Michael Andretti 2 Bobby Rahal Al Unser W Kevin Cogan 3 Tom Sneva W Roberto Guerrero Al Unser Jr. 4 Ed Pimm Emerson Fittipaldi Johnny Rutherford W 5 Randy Lanier R Pancho Carter Jacques Villeneuve R 6 Danny Ongais Josele Garza Tony Bettenhausen Jr. 7 Arie Luyendyk Geoff Brabham A.

A few days later, he crashed his already-qualified car, and it was damaged beyond repair. The car was replaced with a back-up car, and was moved the rear of the field.\n\nGeorge Snider and Roberto Moreno were both involved in the multi-car crash on Carburetion Day. Both primary cars were damaged beyond repair. Their cars were replaced with back-up cars, and moved to the rear of the field.\n\nAfter Dennis Firestone withdrew his wrecked car, Dick Simon was added to field in the 33rd position as the first alternate\n\nQualified cars withdrawn\n\n[edit]\n\nDennis Firestone; wrecked on Carburetion Day and withdrawn.\n\nAlternates\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst alternate: Dick Simon (#23) – Bumped – Named to starting field on 5/23\n\nSecond alternate: none\n\nFailed to qualify\n\n[edit]\n\nDerek Daly (#28) – Incomplete qualifying run due to rain\n\nRick Miaskiewicz R (#19) – Waved off\n\nSteve Chassey (#56/#65) – Waved off\n\nSteve Bren R (#25)\n\nSpike Gehlhausen (#10)\n\nRupert Keegan R (#56/#65) – Did not make an attempt\n\nJan Lammers R (#98) – Did not make an attempt\n\nHerm Johnson (#28) – Wrecked in practice, injured\n\nMike Nish R (#44/#45)\n\nJohn Paul Jr. (#31) Paul withdrew after a few days of practice after being sentenced to prison for his involvement in drug trafficking with his father, John Paul, Sr.\n\nRain delay\n\n[edit]\n\nSunday, May 25\n\n[edit]\n\nThe race was scheduled for Sunday, May 25. Despite a forecast of only a 15% chance of precipitation,[24] race morning saw overcast skies and steady rain. Track drying efforts began around 10:45 a.m.[24] EST. The track was close to dry, and spectators began filing into their seats. The cars were then wheeled to the pits, in preparations for a start. At 1:15 p.m., however, the rain resumed, and threatened to wash out the entire day. The rain stopped, and track drying efforts started a second time. The rain returned once more, and at 3:35 p.m., officials rescheduled the race for Monday. During the delay, ABC-TV diverted its programming for several minutes in favor of live coverage of Hands Across America.\n\nGrim memories of the tragic 1973 race were still in many people's minds, and all involved were determined to make certain the race would not be hastily put on in a rushed, last-minute, fashion. In addition, officials were uncommitted on how late they would permit a start, and if they would aim for a 101-lap race (the minimum distance for the event to be official), or insist on adequate time for a full 200-lap race before sunset. The weather forecast for Monday (80% chance of rain) was yet another concern.[24]\n\nMonday, May 26\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Monday, May 26, there was no chance to hold the race, as it rained all day. The infield turned into a sea of mud, and most of the spectators had since departed, going home to their jobs. Authorities estimated Monday's attendance at a paltry 5,800 spectators. Those who did arrive merely milled around, as most of the infield was impassable, concession stands were out of food, and souvenir tents were empty and abandoned. Some visited the Speedway museum.\n\nAt 3:20 p.m., officials announced that the race was going to be postponed, but did not yet announce the date or time to which it would be rescheduled. Unsubstantiated rumors even circulated about canceling the race outright.[25] ABC television was scheduled to cover the race live for the first time, but did not commit to live coverage on Tuesday. Track officials were faced with the possibility of running the race on Tuesday in front of empty grandstands, and without live TV coverage. Weather forecasts for Tuesday and Wednesday were not promising,[25] a substantial amount of the track staff was unavailable,[25] and the sloppy conditions made parts of the facility impassable. Around 6 p.m. on Monday evening, a deal had been struck to reschedule the race for Saturday, May 31.[25]\n\nMid-week\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the week, teams spent time resting and relaxing, while others prepared for the next race at Milwaukee. Track crews worked diligently to clean up the infield, and make it passable for Saturday. As a result of the postponement, a special thirty-minute practice session was arranged on Friday, May 30. Participants were held to a 120 mph (190 km/h) speed limit, and it served mostly as a leak check exercise. Some drivers, including polesitter Rick Mears, as well as Bobby Rahal, did not even participate. The five-day delay wound up being a popular choice by nearly all of the participants.[25] It allowed them to rest and unwind, and regroup for race day without the uncertainty that was looming over them of when the race would start.\n\nFor the weekend, the Rex Mays 200 at Milwaukee, originally scheduled for Sunday June 1, was pushed back one week to accommodate the Indy rain delay. The 1986 race marked the first time since 1973 that the race was pushed to another day, and the first time since 1915 that 'not a single wheel had turned' all weekend because of rain. It also marked the first time since 1967 the race was held May 31; until 1971, when the race was always held on May 30, if that day was a Sunday, it was held the ensuing Monday, May 31. As of 2021, it is the most recent \"500\" to be held on May 31, and is the longest postponement in Indy from scheduled race day by weather in history. (The 2020 was postponed 12 weeks by restrictions from a global pandemic, but there were no weather-related postponements.)\n\nRace summary\n\n[edit]\n\nStart\n\n[edit]\n\nSaturday, May 31 saw sunny skies and temperatures in the low 80s. Traditional pre-race ceremonies were retooled slightly, with some replacement performers. The Purdue band was absent, while Robert McFarland,[26][27] scheduled to sing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\", had departed and was replaced by John S. Davies, the artist-in-residence at the Indianapolis Opera.[28][29] A smaller balloon spectacle was also hastily arranged, after all of the original balloons had lost their helium by Monday afternoon. An army band from Fort Benjamin Harrison was brought in to accompany the performances, and to perform \"Taps.\" Mary F. Hulman gave the starting command just minutes before 11 a.m., and the field pulled away for the parade and pace laps.\n\nOn the final pace lap, Tom Sneva veered off-course at the exit of turn 2. Further down the backstretch, a massive smoke bomb was set off by some unruly spectators. The yellow flag was displayed, and the start was waved off. The next time by, the field was red-flagged, and halted on the frontstretch. Sneva's crash was cleaned up, but it was determined that the field had burned an unnecessary four laps of fuel. A decision was made to replenish each of the 32 remaining cars' pitside fuel tanks with 3 gallons of methanol. The red flag wound up delaying the start by over a half-hour.\n\nAt 11:34 a.m., Tony George gave the command to restart the engines, and the field assembled for two pace laps. The field was straggling through the fourth turn to take the green, and Michael Andretti jumped into the lead from the outside of the front row. He set a new all-time record for the first lap at 202.940 mph (326.600 km/h), the first time the opening lap was run over 200 mph (320 km/h). After a postponement of six days, and after another half hour delay due to the Sneva crash, the race was finally underway.\n\nFirst half\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter charging from the 30th starting position, Mario Andretti's day was short-lived. On the 15th lap, he brought out the yellow when he stalled in turn three with an ignition problem. Michael Andretti set the early pace, leading the first 42 laps. Mario later returned to the track, but his car lasted only four additional laps, and he finished 32nd.\n\nThe first half of the race saw record average speed, with only two yellows for 10 laps, and no major incidents. The second yellow on lap 52 came out for debris when Michael Andretti lost a mirror. Rick Mears came to the lead by lap 49, and held it until the next round of pit stops. On lap 83, Bobby Rahal took the lead for 19 laps, and led at the halfway point.\n\nSecond half\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnny Parsons spun out of turn two on lap 102, and came to a stop along the inside wall. The car suffered minor damage, and Parsons was uninjured. After another long stretch of green, Rich Vogler crashed in turn three on lap 135.\n\nOn the 135th lap, Rahal (1st) and Cogan (2nd) pitted under caution. Rahal's crew nearly made a critical error, and did not change the left-front tire (it had not been changed yet in the race). Rahal had to pit once again the next time around to correct the oversight. Since the field was under caution, the consequences were not quite as serious, but he still fell from 1st to 4th.\n\nOn the restart, Rick Mears resumed as the leader. Short-pitting due to poor handling, 4th place Michael Andretti was the first of the leaders to pit again (on lap 163). Mears led all the way until his final scheduled pit stop on lap 165. Moments later Roberto Moreno brought out the caution by stalling in turn four. After Rahal and Cogan cycled through their final planned stops on lap 166, Mears again found himself up front. Michael Andretti (at the tail-end of the lead lap in 4th place) actually led the field behind the pace car as the field went back to green with 31 laps to go. Observers noted that the three leaders would have to complete the final 34 laps on one tank of fuel. Without another caution, it was feared that they might need a splash-and-go stop for fuel in order to make it to the finish.\n\nFinish\n\n[edit]\n\nWith 14 laps to go, Rick Mears led Bobby Rahal and Kevin Cogan. Fourth place Michael Andretti was still clinging on to the tail-end of the lead lap, running just ahead of Mears. The leaders approached a string of slower cars, and Mears was experiencing handling difficulties in traffic. Mears got caught up behind a slower car, and Rahal pounced. Down the backstretch, Rahal got by Mears to take the lead and raced towards turn 3. Cogan made a daring pass around the outside of Mears in turn four to take second place. Down the frontstretch, Rahal now found himself caught behind the slower car of Randy Lanier. Cogan diced back and forth, and slipped by Rahal going into turn one.\n\nWith less than 13 laps to go, Cogan was now in front. He opened up a three-second lead. Cogan's car was visibly loose in the turns, and on several occasions nearly clipped the outside wall in turn 2. Rahal was having trouble keeping up with the hard-charging Cogan, while Mears had slipped to third and appeared to be having some handling difficulties. With 7 laps to go, fourth place Michael Andretti ducked into the pit area for a splash of fuel. Suddenly on lap 194, Arie Luyendyk who was running 11th, spun exiting turn four. His car whipped around and lightly tagged the inside wall near the entrance of the pits. The yellow flag came out, and the field was bunched up behind the pace car. Cogan's lead was erased. There was some conjecture that the race could finish under yellow, with Cogan the certain winner. With the help of the yellow, the fuel concerns were now lessened.\n\nSafety crews were able to clear the incident quickly. Cogan led, with Rahal second, and Mears third, nose-to-tail on the track. With 21⁄2 laps to go, the lights on the pace car were turned off, signifying that the field was ready to go back to green. Cogan, Rahal, and Mears picked up the pace in the north chute, and came out of turn four for a restart with two laps to go. Rahal got the jump on Cogan out of turn four, and took the lead mid-way down the frontstretch. Rahal led at the line, and dove in front of Cogan going into turn one.\n\nDown the backstretch, Rahal pulled out to a 1-second lead. Mears set up to pass Cogan in turn three, but Cogan held off the challenge. Rahal took the white flag; his speed on the 199th lap was a noteworthy 203 mph (327 km/h). Rahal pulled out to a 1.4-second advantage, and won his first Indianapolis 500. Cogan and Mears finished second and third, in what was the closest three-car finish at the time. Rahal's final lap was an all-time record 209.152 mph (336.598 km/h), the fastest race lap to-date in Indy 500 competition.\n\nRahal completed the 500 miles (800 km) in 2 hours, 55 minutes, 43.470 seconds; becoming the first driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 in less than three hours. His average speed of 170.722 broke Rick Mears' 1984 record. Rahal later claimed that his fuel warning light had come on during the final lap, and a post-race inspection showed that only two gallons of methanol fuel remained in his tank.[30]\n\nBox score\n\n[edit]\n\nFinish Start No Name Team Chassis Engine Qual Laps Status 1 4 3 Bobby Rahal Truesports March 86C Cosworth DFX 213.550 200 170.722 mph 2 6 7 Kevin Cogan Patrick Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 211.922 200 +1.441 seconds 3 1 4 Rick Mears W Penske Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 216.828 200 +1.881 seconds 4 8 5 Roberto Guerrero Bignotti Cotter Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 211.576 200 +10.558 seconds 5 9 30 Al Unser Jr. Doug Shierson Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 211.533 199 Flagged 6 3 18 Michael Andretti KRACO Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 214.522 199 Flagged 7 11 20 Emerson Fittipaldi Patrick Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 210.237 199 Flagged 8 12 21 Johnny Rutherford W Alex Morales Motorsports March 86C Cosworth DFX 210.220 198 Flagged 9 2 1 Danny Sullivan W Penske Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 215.382 197 Flagged 10 13 12 Randy Lanier R Arciero Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 209.964 195 Flagged 11 29 24 Gary Bettenhausen Leader Card Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 209.756 193 Flagged 12 20 8 Geoff Brabham Galles Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 207.082 193 Flagged 13 22 22 Raul Boesel Dick Simon Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 211.202 192 Flagged 14 33 23 Dick Simon Dick Simon Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 204.978 189 Flagged 15 19 61 Arie Luyendyk Provimi Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 207.811 188 Crash T4 16 14 15 Pancho Carter Galles Racing Lola T86/00 Buick V-6 209.635 179 Wheel Bearing 17 10 66 Ed Pimm Curb Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 210.874 168 Electrical 18 17 55 Josele Garza Machinists Union Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 208.939 167 Flagged 19 32 9 Roberto Moreno R Galles Racing Lola T86/00 Cosworth DFX 209.469 158 Stalled 20 15 81 Jacques Villeneuve R Hemelgarn Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 209.397 154 Main Bearing 21 25 59 Chip Ganassi Machinists Union Racing March 86C Cosworth DFX 207.590 151 Engine 22 5 11 Al Unser Sr. W Penske Racing Penske PC-15 Ilmor-Chevrolet 212.295 149 Vibration 23 16 25 Danny Ongais Panavision March 86C Buick V-6 209.158 136 Ignition 24 21 14 A.

Visibly frail and lacking strength, he managed to arrive in victory lane to celebrate with his driver Bobby Rahal. Trueman was interviewed in victory lane by ABC-TV reporter Jack Arute, and took a swig of the traditional milk. According to Arute, Trueman was clinging to his shoulder, as he barely possessed the strength to stand on his own. After the cameras were turned off, he whispered to Arute \"I can go now\".[32] Due to the rain delay, the traditional victory banquet was canceled. A makeshift victory luncheon was held in its place on Sunday June 1 at the Speedway Motel. The top three finishers were invited to the private reception. Later, Rahal's crew celebrated with a lunch at the nearby Red Lobster.[33]\n\nThe city of Columbus held a victory celebration downtown on June 5. Over 300 Red Roof Inn employees took part in a parade down Broad Street. Trueman was too sick to attend. On June 11, Trueman succumbed to his illness, at the age of 51.\n\nRahal and the Truesports team rode the wave of success to five additional wins during the CART season, and clinched the 1986 CART championship. The team made it back-to-back titles by winning the 1987 CART championship as well.\n\nKevin Cogan suffered through his second major disappointment at Indy, following the misfortunes of 1982.[34] Despite winning the season opener at Phoenix, he faded as a contender during the season. He also was asked several times, during the month of May, about his accident in 1982 with Andretti and Foyt, leading Cogan to reportedly exit a press conference early. Race winner Rahal, on Cogan's redemption story, remarked afterwards, \"1982 was a bum rap. The drivers treated him unfairly. He suffered through some rough times . . . I can't imagine what it must have been like to go to a race and have people boo you.\"(28)\n\nBroadcasting\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nThe race was carried live on the IMS Radio Network. Paul Page served as the chief announcer for the tenth year. It was Page's thirteenth year overall as part of the network crew. Lou Palmer reported from victory lane. Bobby Unser, Page's frequent booth partner on NBC Sports, joined the broadcast for the first and only time as \"driver expert.\"\n\nRon Carrell and Jerry Baker swapped places, with Carrell moving to the north pits (where he remained until 1990) and Baker moving to the high-profile Turn 1 location. Baker has remained in that location until 2017 (except 2010 and 2013 when it was vacant) as he would depart the crew and join the public address crew for 2018 when it was decided that Turn 1 would not be used in 2018 but due to a new broadcast booth debuting in 2019 named after Sid Collins, Turn 1's broadcasting location would be reinstated.. Gary Gerould (one of Page's NBC colleagues), made his first appearance as a pit reporter, sharing duties in the south pits with Lou Palmer.\n\nLuke Walton reprised his traditional duty of introducing the starting command during the pre-race, however, he did not have an active role during the race.\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nThe race was carried in the United States on ABC Sports on live, flag-to-flag coverage for the first time. Jim McKay moved to the host position, while Jim Lampley served as announcer.\n\nThe initial live broadcast set for Sunday, May 25 was rained out. The telecast was filled with interviews, talk, and highlights of previous races. The broadcast returned on Saturday, May 31 for the live coverage of the race.\n\nThree pit reporters served on the crew, joined by Donna de Varona, who was slated to serve as a roving reporter, conducting interviews and other features. However, she appeared only on the original Sunday telecast, and did not return on Saturday. Dr. Joe Randolph was also announced as part of the team, slated to report from the medical center, but he never appears on-air.\n\nThree RaceCams were used (none were utilized in 1985), with defending champion Danny Sullivan the highest-profile driver to feature one. For the first time, the broadcast carried all of the pre-race ceremonies live, although they omitted coverage of the invocation.\n\nThe broadcast has re-aired numerous times on ESPN Classic since the mid-2000s.\n\nABC Television Booth Announcers Pit/garage reporters\n\nHost: Jim McKay\n\nAnnouncer: Jim Lampley\n\nColor: Sam Posey\n\nJack Arute\n\nLarry Nuber\n\nAl Trautwig\n\nDonna de Varona (May 25 only)\n\nDr. Joe Randolph (not utilized)\n\n1985–86 USAC Gold Crown Championship\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1985–86 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one sanctioned race. The schedule was based on a split-calendar, beginning in June 1985 and running through May 1986. Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in top-level Indy car racing, and ultimately ceased sanctioning races outside of the Indianapolis 500 following their 1983–84 season. Subsequently the Gold Crown Championship would consist of only one event annually; the winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the de facto Gold Crown champion, as it was their lone points-paying event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART, and the Indy 500 paid championship points separately (on a different scale) toward the CART championship as well.\n\nBobby Rahal, by virtue of winning the 1986 Indianapolis 500, also won the 1985–86 USAC Championship.[35]\n\nFinal points standings (Top five)\n\n[edit]\n\nPos Driver INDY\n\nPts 1 Bobby Rahal 1 1000 2 Kevin Cogan 2 800 3 Rick Mears 3 700 4 Roberto Guerrero 4 600 5 Al Unser Jr. 5 500\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Page described the finish of IMS Radio Network:\n\nThe final roar of the racing engines...Bobby Rahal accelerates...and Bobby Rahal has won his first Indianapolis 500.\n\nKevin Cogan responding to Sam Posey for an in-race radio interview with only 3 laps to go:\n\nI'm kind of busy right now Sam, I'll talk to you afterwards.\n\nSam Posey on ABC-TV after being snubbed by Kevin Cogan:\n\nI wouldn't want to talk to me either.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\n1986 Chevrolet Corvette pace car\n\nWinning car owner Jim Trueman\n\nRace-worn helmet of Bobby Rahal on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n28.
