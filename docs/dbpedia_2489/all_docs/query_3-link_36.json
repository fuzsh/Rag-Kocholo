        "text": "October 19,2014 - Randy Cabral didn't need to win on Sunday to notch another NEMA championship, but you wouldn't have guessed it the way he raced through the field and took the lead in the 25 lap feature at Thompson's World Series. It was his sixth win of 2014. He also added to his record 10 wins at the Connecticut oval, while winning his fifth championship in 7 years.\n\nCabral, of Kingston, MA. led a Bertrand Motorsports assault, with his teammates finishing second and fifth.\n\nCabral could have clinched the championship with a decent finish in qualifying, but heats for the midgets were cancelled on Saturday due to a lengthy rain delay. NEMA started Sunday with a 20 minute warm-up session.\n\nIt only took Cabral 8 laps to run down and pass early leader John Zych of Mendon, MA. Zych stayed within a few car lengths of Cabral. When the caution came out on lap 14 for a spin by Jim Santa Maria of Burlington, CT, it allowed Zych the opportunity to restart alongside Cabral.\n\nZych regained the lead until another caution 3 laps later. This one for a slowing Bethany Stoehr of Bridgewater, MA, who had a solid top 5 run going until the car broke. On the restart, Zych's car bobbled and shot to the infield entering turn 1. He slid back up onto the track in the middle of traffic. Everyone was able to get by, but Zych was done due to steering problems, retiring to pit road.\n\nCabral then opened a comfortable lead, but that was negated by the final caution on lap 21 for an incident involving Scott Bigelow of E. Hampton, CT that landed him against the inside retaining wall just out of turn 4.\n\nThe single file restart put second place driver and Cabral teammate for the day Cole Carter right on Cabral's bumper. Carter stayed with Cabral through the first and second turn, but Randy turned up the heat on the backstretch and cruised to victory.\n\nCarter finished second, followed by Danny Cugini of Marshfield, MA in third, Jim Chambers of Atkinson, NH fourth and Cabral teammate Todd Bertrand fifth.\n\nCabral wins his fifth NEMA championship in 7 seasons, all of which accomplished by driving equipment owned by Tim Bertrand. After starting the season with 2 DNF's, he rarely finished out of the top 3, picking up 5 wins.\n\nHe had been point battling another consistent finisher, Avery Stoehr of Lakeville, MA. Stoehr had never finished out of the top 10 all season until Sunday - 7 of those were top 5s with 2 wins along the way.\n\nChampion Cabral and NEMA Lite champion Ryan Krachun of Neshanic Station, NJ will be honored at the annual awards banquet on November 22 in Marlborough, MA. The Northeastern Midget Association has long considered Connecticut's Thompson Speedway the ultimate \"separate the men from the boys\" facility. While any Thompson checkered is a treasure, the World Series is definitely the biggest plum.\n\nFour time champion and current point leader Randy Cabral of Plymouth looms as the man to beat when NEMA makes its annual appearance at the Thompson World Series on Oct. 18/19. Qualifying is scheduled for Saturday Oct. 18 with the 25-lap feature part of the busy Sunday, Oct. 19 agenda.\n\nTen victories, including five World Series triumphs, make Cabral the all-time Thompson maestro. Last year, Cabral charged to second place, then made a surprise pit stop for an adjustment before the halfway point, and then made a heroic run to the front again but fell short to John Zych and Bobby Santos. Zych’s historic run capped a brilliant championship season for the JZ Motorsports team.\n\nThis year, Cabral enters the World Series with a 101 point lead over the young Avery Stoehr. If Cabral is able to start both the heat and feature events, he will wrap up the 2014 Championship.\n\nThompson’s long Midget history, however, is filled with surprises. Considering the last few years have been some of the most competitive seasons in NEMA’s 60+ year history, it is safe to consider the possibility of another surprise. Cabral’s teammate Todd Bertrand (Bertrand 39), Seth Carlson (Feigel 71), Paul Scally (Scally 30), Avery Stoehr (Stoehr 15B), Zych (Zych 9), Jim Santa Maria (Santa Maria 54) and last week’s winner Ryan Bigelow (SantaMaria 99) are all coming to Thompson with high hopes.\n\nNEMA and Thompson have a relationship that goes back to 1960 when the legendary Dutch Schaefer was the winner. Since then, Thompson has helped write a ton of NEMA history and a credible part of that is World Series related.\n\nGreg Stoehr, driving for John Zahar, passed brother Russ in the closing laps to win in 1994. In 2001, Joey Payne, who like Greg Stoehr started last, passed the same Russ Stoehr on the final lap en route to the checkered. The latter was Gene Angelillo’s 100th NEMA win. A Nokie Fornoro romp in 2010 proved to be the last Midget ride for one of the sport’s greatest competitors."
