They were married in 1952, and after living in Hawthorne, California, they moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 1963 and raised their four children.\n\nGeorge was a good son, brother, husband, father, friend, and neighbor. He took great pride in serving his country as a mechanic in the Air Force during the Korean War, working as a firefighter for the Los Angeles Fire Department for thirty-one years, and establishing George Bender Plumbing in 1958.

A decorated combat veteran, he died of a stroke. He was born in 1926 in Borger, Texas. Survivors include his wife of 42 years, Edith Jouanin Bernard; sons Hugh Bernard of Annapolis, Joel Bernard of Alexandria, and Jacques Bernard of Vienna; daughter Mary Bernard Santos of Jacksonville, Florida; five grandchildren; and a sister and five brothers.\n\nHe joined the Marine Corps in 1944 and served in the Pacific and china as an enlisted man. He joined the Army in 1947. In 1948 he was made an honorary member of the 555th, an African American parachute regiment known as \"Triple Nickel.\" He was commissioned an infantry officer in 1949.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Korean War, he was a platoon leader with L Company, 21st Infantry, receiving the Distinguished Service Cross for action at Chochiwon, Korea. The citation said, \"Lieutenant Bernard's aggressive attacks on the enemy tanks and machine-gun emplacement inspired the outnumbered men of his command to fight with him, until out of ammunition, against overwhelming odds.\"\n\nAfter Korea, his military career took him to Germany, Ranger School at Ft. Benning, Georgia, and the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He also helped develop the curriculum at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1960 he was assigned to Laos as part of the White Star Mobile Training Teams. Colonel Bernard In 1972 he was assigned the task of restructuring the Army ROTC program at the University of California at Berkeley. He retired from the Army in 1978, after which he ran a consulting firm that specialized in Army readiness and U.S./French military relations.\n\nComments from Volney Warner (life member 24th Infantry Division Association)\n\n\"I lost a warrior friend yesterday. Carl Bernard died comfortably in his bed reading a book on Korea. Synopsis of our early association follows, as done for his children and in preparation for my eulogy at his funeral. Carl was indeed the bravest combat soldier that I have ever known and a dear friend for many years worth remembering. Great men also die! - Vol Warner\n\nKorea -\n\nI reported in to L Company, 21st Infantry as a replacement 2nd Lieutenant fresh out of West Point at the end August 1950. Carl had already distinguished himself in battle in July as one of the few survivors of Task Force Smith. As 1st Lieutenant Company Exec, Carl was now tasked with fitting me and several of my classmates into the remnants of Task Force Smith, then holding a section of the Naktong Perimeter. Carl took one look at the lot of us and remarked, \"The war is over. The ring knockers are here.\" We called him \"Peep Sight\" because he had broken his glasses and refused to go to the rear to get another pair. Instead, he put a thin strip of white tape across the offending lens, which obscured his vision but improved his aim.\n\nAs for weaponry, he often carried a .45 with one round in the chamber as alternative to capture. He wore a bedraggled World War II wool knit cap and sweater which he claimed, as did the Ghost Dancing Sioux before him, to be \"magically bullet proofed.\" No bullet would ever have his name on it as long as he was so garbed. The Division MPs fined him 25 dollars in the rear area for failure to wear a steel pot, but it took an order from Ridgeway to get him to comply. Those soldiers who survived the initial North Korean onslaught with him worshipped the ground he fought on and the rest of us loved him for what he was and would follow him anywhere. The company lost about 200 soldiers mostly killed/captured and some were wounded from July 1950 to July 1951.\n\nWhen Carl was sent to the rear for a break as an L-19 observer, he continued to keep track of us on the ground like an overhead mother. When the going got tough on the ground, he came forward to join the fight, even once arriving in a \"borrowed\" armored vehicle for added fire support. He adjusted \"danger close\" artillery support one day on the Chinese contesting our real estate, so close that it splattered us with hot fragments but separated their body parts and obviated our fixing bayonets.\n\nWe never had time to appropriately record his heroic efforts. Pencil and paper was in short supply in those days and the enemy just over the next hill mass. So each year those of us in L Company, plus wives who will listen to us, meet for three days somewhere to relive (and embellish) our exploits and discuss who will toast the company from the \"last man standing bottle,\" before L Company falls in again in the Great Hereafter.\n\nVietnam:\n\nWhile working in the White House as part of Ambassador Komer and Ambassador Leonhardt's staff, I was dispatched at their direction to Vietnam to make and independent analysis of the effects of Tet 31 January 1968 on the Pacification Plan--presumably as requested by President Johnson.\n\nOf course, I visited Carl at Hau Nghia as part of my tour of the Provinces. I arrived, briefcase in hand, for a short in-brief at the Team House, reminiscing that my good friend Reed Jensen, one of Carl's early predecessors had been killed there by the VC in 1963. After a few uncharitable, and no doubt correct, comments about the inability of the nearby US division to control the area, Carl insisted we take a tour of his domain. So we jumped in his jeep, with him driving, and started eastward along the unimproved road toward Saigon---he with his pistol, me with my briefcase.\n\nWe had proceeded no more than a mile when I noticed a wide swath through the adjacent rice paddy, crossing the road to our front obliterating past tire marks and then coursing as far as we could see toward Saigon. Carl decided to ask the adjacent Regional Force Outpost what units had gone by them in the middle of the night. They reported seeing nothing (but their radios has disappeared). Since the outpost had reported nothing, Carl was immediately suspicious that a large enemy unit had \"harvested the rice\" by marching through it, and threatened the locals to silence as they passed. Carl then said, \"Let's go cross country and see if we can find them.\" I replied, \"Let's call the ARVN Regiment and let them go find them, I'm just here on TDY!\" I lost the argument so away we went.\n\nAbout one mile later, we took some incoming AK rounds and had to dismount behind the Jeep for cover. Carl dug an M-79 (shotgun 40mm) out of the rear seat and we tried to engage, at the same time calling the Regimental Commander who appeared on the scene shortly thereafter. About four of us were standing behind the paddy barrier talking strategy when a sniper knocked down the Regimental surgeon and an NCO standing about four feet from us. I immediately got down behind the paddy dike and was amazed to see Carl and his ARVN colonel counterpart remain standing and exposed despite sporadic incoming AK fire. An ARVN fire team ran them off shortly thereafter with the Regiment in hot pursuit. Welcome to mini-Tet May 1968!\n\nI asked Carl and the Colonel why on earth they did not take cover and get down behind the paddy dike. The Colonel's reply was that \"The VC/NVA always shoot low, so if you stand tall you only get hit in the legs. If you get down, you will be shot in the head.\" The two of them were clearly playing \"chicken.\" As in Korea, there never was a bullet that had Carl's name on it. Next day the battle for Cholon was begun in earnest.\"\n\nBeaulieu, Dona Alfred \"Don\"\n\nDona Alfred \"Don\" Beaulieu, 84, passed away in Birchwood Terrace Nursing Home in Burlington on Wednesday, November 28, 2012.

His American story is one of heroism and valor. A hero is a man of distinguished courage or ability. To those who knew Fred, his abilities were many. Heroes are missed greatly, but their legacy is a brilliant example of citizenship and friendship.\n\nFred passed away July 28. Village Green will miss his constant presence around here. Fred and his beloved wife Karen always walked the Green. They smiled and waved. It was just their nature. Neighbors recall Fred's good deeds and uncompromised friendliness. His 'Dearest Friends' were important to him. On limited occasions Fred reminisced about his experiences in Texas as a boy or things he’d done in his several stations in life. Fred went to college and worked many jobs, finishing his illustrious career as a NASA contractor. His unassuming nature seemed as odds with his friendly style.\n\nFred was everyone's pal. He was also in great shape. As an example, Fred frequented our park for spontaneous pull-ups. Not bad for a guy in his 80s. To Fred recognition was more suited for the self-absorbed. VG awarded Fred ‘Patriot of the Year’ a few years back. He picked up sticks and trash. He even raked pine cones for his friends. One VG neighbor remembers Fred fixing a lawn mower. He helped others due to selfless devotion. Fred also collected cans to finance a friend's medical treatment.\n\nOlder folks have stories to share. Some stories are worthy of remembering and retelling. Fred once shared his Korean War story. He didn't talk about it much though. Heroes like Fred assume duty is more important than boasting. Fred's lifelong interest in airplanes led to pilot training while serving in our nation's Air Force. He answered his duty call in faraway Korea. His bird was a B-29 bomber.\n\n1st Lieutenant Beissner was co-pilot on October 23, 1951 during a daylight bombing raid. His Superfortress was one of 9 bombers that attacked Namsi Airfield. These WWII-era bombers were slow. The jet age was beginning and the Russian MIG-15 was a state-of-the art example of speed and agility. The Americans entered MIG Alley around mid-day. MIGs swarmed our planes and shot down six. Fred's plane was lost. Ultimately he was rescued after 6 hours. It was an epic aerial battle and published in a book called Black Tuesday over Namsi.\n\nAfter the war Fred's continued interest in planes led to advanced degrees and eventually a job at NASA Langley. He worked there 22 years. He and Karen moved to VG in 1976 and loved this place. Fellowship included eating and drinking Fred's margaritas, an indulgence people described as \"wicked\". Karen and Fred made Pepper soup together. Their approach was pure teamwork and fun. To Fred, life was delicious and best served warm and hearty. Thanks Fred for many years of smiling and waving. The Green lost a great American and friend.\n\nBencina, Louis C.\n\nLouis C. Bencina\n\nLouis C. Bencina, 81, of Eastlake, passed away peacefully October 16, 2011, at home.
