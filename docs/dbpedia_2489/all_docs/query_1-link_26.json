        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, May 29— When 73‐year‐old Anton (Tony) Hulman calls out the traditional “Gentlemen, start your engines!” at II A.M. tomorrow (12 noon E.D.T.), that order will start the 60th running of the Indianapolis 500, America's annual love affair with auto racing.\n\nBut as 10,000 multicolored balloons soar into the sky, Hu!man's order also will signal the end of the “Mad 30 Days of May,” the tense period of preparation and buildup for race drivers, car builders, mechanics, race officials, promoters, sponsors and an army of others.\n\nFor the pageant‐rich race, with a purse of more than $1 million and an attendance of approximately 300,000, is one or tne greatest sports spectacles in the world (less devout observers also regard it as the biggest barbecue in the world, afloat on an ocean of beer).\n\nThis is the race that has brought the American public such folk heroes as Ray Harroun, the first winner in 1911; Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, the American ace of World War I aerial combat; Rodger Ward, a two‐time winner who abruptly quit because “it isn't fun anymore\"; and Wilbur Shaw, Mauri Rose and Louis Meyer, and, in recent years, A. J. Foyt, all of whom won the race three tinie‐A'.\n\nEven Tony Hulman, after 30 years of running this show, is tense. Cynical critics have long suspected that. Hulman had to read a palmed cue card for those four words. But it's not a joke, it's true:\n\n“I'm just as scared as I ever was,” Hulman said a few days ago in a retrospective interview. “Why, I have to write down my speech so I won't say something else. I have done it for years, but I get so nervous.”\n\nThe race, wIth a field of 33 cars arranged in 11 rows of three cars apiece, will run 200 miles around the 2¼mile rectangular course of Indianapolis Motor Speedway (\"Just remember to keep turning left,” the late Bill Vukovich used to advise. Barring an unusual number of yellow caution signals, the race will run a hit more than 3 hours ri minutes.\n\nThis is a contest of attrition as well as speed. As always, no more than 10 or 12 of the 33 starters will be around at the finish. And in a way,. that small list of survivors dramatizes the two strategies that ire evrdent on the track.\n\nIn the application of the first strategy, most of the contestants run on she principle of completing as many ,laps as they can without burning out or breaking up the car.. Obviously; the objective there is to win a bigger share of the purse.\n\nThe other strategy is the more spectacular. About eight, possibly 10, drivers are going to race flat‐out, running as hard as they can within the limitations of their fuel supply‐280 gallons, not of gasoline, but of an esoteric alcohol blend.\n\n. Most years the same eight or 10 drivers are in contention in the last 50 miles. Then the careful husbanding of fuel and the split‐second timing of pit stops begins to count.\n\nIn sizing up the drivers who have a realistic chance to win, Indy's equivalents of horse racing's railbirds have to start with Foyt, a 4‐1 favorite.\n\nFoyt, whose cantankerous exterior hides an inner wall of irascibility, is favored because of his superb talent and fine equipment‐a car of his own design, the Coyote, and an eight‐cylinder engine, the Foyt, that he has adapted from the old Ford racing engines.\n\nFoyt also wants to win. More than any other driver here, Foyt has an abundance of what athletes call desire. Foyt Won this race in 1961, 1964 and 1967, and he wants to be the first man to win it a fourth tithe.\n\n19 In a Row\n\n“Super Tex” also holds a longevity record here: tomorrow will mark his 19th consecutive Indianapolis 500.\n\nOn Foyt's level are two other drivers—Johnny Rutherford, the 1974 winner and runner‐up last year, and Mario Andretti, the 1969 winner.\n\nRutherford. a congenial Texan driving for the Britainbased McLaren racing team, is riding with some of the best equipment on the track. He is as race‐wise as anyone here. Rutherford will be 'starting tomorrow from the pole position — the inside spot in the first row of starters; in 1974, when he ‐won, he came “up from the 25t1 starting position.\n\nAndretti starts with some of the most keenly developed and versatile talents in racing. And on top of that he is blessed this year with an excellent machine prepared by Roger Penske. the best car Mario has had in five years.\n\nAndretti actually turned in the fast qualifying time189.404 miles an hour—but he did not win the pole because his run was not made on the first qualifying day, May 15, when the pole was at stake. That weekend he was in Europe for the Grand Prix of Belgium.\n\nPenske, a racing master who has long enjoyed the reputation of having “the unfair advantage,” has come up this year with an eyepopping device‐an on‐board pneumatic jack that raises all four corners of the car simultaneously. That kind of action makes it possible to change three tires in fewer than 18 seconds.\n\nThe jack idea is not new. They were using it here 20 years ago on front‐engine racing cars, but it disappeared with the advent of the rearengine racer. What Penske has done is adapt it to mode ern rear‐engine cars.\n\nNext are the Unser brothers‐Al, who won in 1970 and 1971, and the older Bobby, who won in 1968 and last year.\n\nAl Unser, driving for the Vel's‐Pamelli Jone! racing team, will run a Parnelli car powered by an English‐built Cosworth engine. This may be the quickest engine here, but there are questions about its durability.\n\nBobby Unser and his chief mechanic broke up with Dan Gurney's All‐America Racers last season, and he has not been running so fast as he used to. But he still has to be reckoned with because of his stature here.\n\nAdd Penske's other driver, Tom Sneva, who qualified his McLaren Offenhauser for third starting position. Next. Gordon Johncock, winner of the accident‐infested race of 1973, who will be starting from second position.\n\nThen there is young Duane (Pancho) Carter Jr., who succeeded Bobby Unser as Gurney's No. 1 driver. Pancho, the son of an old‐time Indy race driver, will drive the same Eagle‐Offy in which Bobby Unser won last ran\n\nThat makes eight drivers with reasonable chances to win. If any one other than those happens to come in first, it will be because the favorites were wiped out by mechanical failure, accidents or, possibly, a shortage of fuel.\n\nSpeed Restrictions\n\nSpeeds will not be so quick this year ‘as they have been in years past. The reason is that since the fiasco of 1973, the United States Auto Club has systematically imposed new restrictions to cut speed.\n\nFirst, there Is a pop‐off valve that limts the amount of air sucked into the intake manifold, thus slowing the speeds. Second, the wings, or air foils, have been reduced in size, forcing drivers to go a little easier in the turns.\n\nAnd finally, USAC is limiting each car to 280 gallons of fuel, which means the driver has to nurse his supply. Most cars at speed get between 1.8 and 2 miles to the gallon. This explains why new design changes are addressed to making the ??? more slippery to use less fuel. “Unless you have a stop watch,” Gurney says, “you can't tell the difference between 180 and 190 miles an hour.’"
