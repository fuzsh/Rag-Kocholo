Zeke would later become Frank's first employee when he formed Kurtis-Kraft. During his time at Thorne Engineering in Burbank, California, Zeke worked on a variety projects including the occasional side projects.\n\nOne interesting side project was the modification of a car for a young Bill Pollack. Bill would later win the first grand prix at Pebble Beach in 1951. Bill also designed the racecourse in Southern California known as Willow Springs.\n\nEd enlisted into the Army Air Corps during the beginning of World War II and served in the eighth air force in Europe. Zeke suffered from Polio and was unable to serve in the military. He continued to work for Joel Thorne, whose shop was now making aircraft parts for the war effort.\n\nThe War Years During Zeke’s time working for Joel Thorne, he met a young Frank Kurtis who had a rented space in the Thorne shop.

Zeke suffered from Polio and was unable to serve in the military. He continued to work for Joel Thorne, whose shop was now making aircraft parts for the war effort.\n\nAfter World War II was over, Frank Kurtis started Kurtis-Kraft and it was at this time that Zeke became his first employee. Following World War II Ed joined Zeke at Kurtis-Kraft. Both were part of a small crew that constructed a reported 500 midget cars. Zeke was also part of the team that built the legendary Novi engine powered Indy car.\n\nBecause of Ed's background as an aircraft mechanic, he suggested to Zeke one day that they should add Dzus fasteners to the Kurtis midget they were working on instead of the currently used 'nut plates'. Thus resulted in the first use of Dzus fasteners on a racecar. During their time at Kurtis-Kraft, they started a racecar repair and fabrication shop they operated during their free hours of nights and weekends. It was called Justice Brothers Racecar Repair & Fabrication. They built a midget car for themselves during this time and after racing it once at Gilmore Stadium in Los Angeles, they sold the car for a $2,500 profit.\n\nThey subsequently invested this money into the oil business. In 1946, the Justice Brothers attended their first Indianapolis 500. Zeke was a crewmember on the team of Bayliss Leverett. The brothers also sponsored this car. 4 years later, they won the race as sponsors of Frank Kurtis' factory Indianapolis 500 entry with driver Johnnie Parsons. In 1952, they scored a second place finish with Jim Rathmann driving for Andy Granatelli and his brothers Joe and Vince.\n\nDuring this time, the Justice Brothers had moved to Jacksonville, Florida and had become involved in the formation of a new organization known as NASCAR. They had met Bill France, Sr. by selling him their oil products for use at his service station. They became the first multi-car sponsor in NASCAR with their companies’ logo appearing on virtually every car. Their attendance and participation in the very beginning of NASCAR has appeared in many books including Smokey Yunick’s 3-volume autobiography. Smokey was a close personal friend of Zeke Justice.\n\nOne of the many notable victories they achieved in NASCAR was at the inaugural Southern 500 held at the new Darlington racetrack in Darlington, South Carolina. Darlington Raceway was the first 'Super Speedway' built for NASCAR racing. Johnny Mantz delivered the second major victory for the Justice Brothers in 1950 by driving car owner Hubert Westmoreland’s Plymouth to victory in NASCAR's first 500 mile race. The Justice Brothers were the sole sponsor on Westmoreland and Mantz's car.\n\nAfter World War II was over, Frank Kurtis started Kurtis-Kraft and it was at this time that Zeke became his first employee.
