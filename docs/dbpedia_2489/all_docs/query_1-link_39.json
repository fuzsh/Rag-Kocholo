It's been two years already, and I can't believe it. It seems like just yesterday we were hanging out at the shop, and raising hell. When Caitlyn does come, and gets old enough to understand, I will tell her all the stories that you and I had. You were taken far too early from us, and just thinking about it makes me tear up. I'm going through a lot of stress right now, and I really wish you were here to talk to about it. You would understand. You always did. In the time we got to know each other, you became a Brother to me. I know things got rocky for a while, but it always seemed that when we did see each other it was like nothing ever happened. I miss you. Please keep an eye on my Daughter, and keep watching over my shoulder. I love you man.

I am sure you know how much you are missed. I think of you and your family often. I pray that God continues to watch over all of the drivers and fans. So could you put in some encouraging words for a few of your friends who are struggling. Ask God to make them happy and keep them safe. And help heal those who have been hurt. I just wish you were still here because your friends could use some friendly advise from a person that was so kind and generous as you. It is still hard for me to go to the track but one of your friends encourged me to go back. He said that you would not want anyone to stop going because of what happened. I still start shaking every time I see what appears to be a bad wreck because I was there the night you had to leave us. We will never understand why you had to go but those who knew Billy or knew of Billy knows there is another angel in heaven watching over everyone. You will always be missed!

I never met Billy but my son, Brian, and I observed the van in the pits at the Grove with the open trailer and I told my son, that is how they did it back when A.J. Foyt, Smokey Snellbaker, Jud Larson and the others. He must have been quite a man. I just wish I would have stopped and talked to him because from all that I have read and heard, he was quite a man. The world needs more like him. RIP Kid.

John Wickard 3:11 AM on April 7, 2008\n\nKyle well put buddy, Billy is very missed and I feel words cant describe how we all feel now that racing season is here without him! I carry Billy with me every time my car hits the track, and always will as long as I have a car, I think about him and I only hope he is looking down on us with a smile. I miss you buddy and thank you for all that I have learned from being your friend when you were here and now that you are not, Your buddy John W. kyle 8:31 PM on March 31, 2008\n\nAs i sit here just remembering a good friend and thinking of all the good times with him, and all the lessons learned from him it is sad but warming all in the same all the things you can learn from life if you let yourself. Its hard to believe that you can become so close with someone in the matter of 6 months but its not the quantity of time its the quality, and the time i had with billy was alot of fun and learning, not just about racing but life and myself. He was a great, fun loving guy, with a heart the size of the world. He taught me to work hard and play harder, to be sincere but not take life too seriously, and if nothing else to have fun with life and racing. He didnt have alot but to him he had the world, and to most of us we forget about all the things we do have and just how blessed we are to get to do things others dont. I wish i could have had 6 more months with Billy but i cant be thankful enough for the 6 that i spent getting to know him and all he taught me. God truly places people in our lives for reasons, and i know he was in mine for one. I will never forget him. Thanks Billy I appreciated it. heather, scott, maddie 11:25 AM on March 31, 2008\n\nHi billy we miss you and can't wait for the birth of your baby girl. she will be here any day now. can't wait to meet her.

Luv ya buddy, your friend John Mark Andrews 8:33 PM on February 9, 2008\n\nBill, I keep wanting to call you and say whats up but I have to remind myself that I can't anymore. I have spent a little time with your parents, probably more than when we were growing up, and I see in them every part of you. Its a strong reminder of who my friend is. Here or not, you are a friend. A friend who helped and passed on knowledge to his friends. We all miss you. I have some stories of late that I know you would get a kick out of. I guess I will have to hold on to them a little while longer. The picture of my wedding is inside the lid of my toolbox at work with the wedding party together. Everyone is dressed up in their tuxes and dresses with smiles. Even you. Its the first thing I see when I open the box to start work every day. I'm very glad you were a part of that special day.

Donovan 2:15 PM on September 18, 2007\n\nBilly I will miss you Cody Fye 12:58 PM on September 18, 2007\n\nI am Sorry to read the news about Bill I only had the oppurtuntiy to watch him race a few times. But i am a avid sprint car fan and I help Work on Bob Garveys Small Block modified #11 Who races at clearfield Raceway park in clearfield Pa also i work with Karl Baker Who races the # 51 410 Sprint car who races at port royal speedway, sportsman speedway, sharon speedway, and lincoln speedway i understand how hard this loss is and i am happy to say that we will be supporting the # 47 on our cars for the remander of this racing season on both cars. .... 5:49 PM on September 16, 2007\n\nI started going to the track with my father when i was little. I always picked the lower numbered cars to route for because I thought the #1 car would finish first. Now that I am older i have learned this is so not true. But to this day, i still believe that every driver has a talent... one that I wish I had. I would love to drive around, whipping those turns like you did. It's from people like you who I learn that life is fun. It's not about how you dress or what you look like, because we all know people at the tracks are different in every way, but the drivers are the entertainers... i'm sorry you had to leave us this way... but at least you did it while you were doing something you had a passion for. watch over the tracks. never forget the memories. R.I.P. STEVE M 11:26 PM on September 15, 2007\n\nBilly. Thank you for your hard work and dedication.

Your Friend John Hot Shoe Fan 11:19 AM on September 15, 2007\n\nHey Billy, racing was rained-out last night at the Grove, so you didn't miss anything. But as I left the track, I thought to myself that it would'nt have been the same without you there anyway. Denise 7:36 PM on September 13, 2007\n\nI did not know you Billy but I used to be at the Grove every Friday night but not for a long time. Been about 15 years maybe. But with all I have read and have been there the night racing lost another up and coming talent in Daryl Gohn, I had to write. With all the bigger sponsors, even in our local racing in Central PA anymore, I was glad to see you were a true racer who loved the sport. You seemed to be what I remember how the local dirt track racer should be. I was close friends with a family who had race cars for years and my dad was on the pit crew for awhile but, now he, and the car owner are also now racing in Heaven!! Such a shame this had to happen, but as I see it, God needed another Angel and called on you!! RIP Billy.

Behind was the big flag pole with The America flag at half staff. Some clown sent a message to the jockey's on board computer screens & told them to only drive counterclockwise around the complex. Not everyone knew what to do. A college graduate came to me and showed his message to me and asked what that meant. I explained it to him. I did five polish victory laps for you and then i thought i better get to work and be productive. billy wouldn't want me srcewing around, on the job. Hats off to Roadway, R.I.P.

I attended the viewing on Saturday and It was just great to see the send off that your son Billy received!! as the song says(only the GOOD die young) gives a new meaning to the phrase, because you did a great job raising Billy, form the time I met him in T-ball and little league, he was always a great kid!and grown into a super person .You can be proud of him and what he has done in the short time he spent here on earth, He sure will be missed by so many!! I know he'll be waiting for you to join hime in Heaven one day. God Bless you all!1 Dave Albright Ashley (cleanup crew at Williams Grove Speedway) 11:11 PM on September 9, 2007\n\nTo the Kimmel Family and Julie, I have had you in my thoughts and prayers since sunday night when the accident happened. I personally did not know Billy to say he was a friend, but i can say that i have spoken to him while he would go through the line at the concession stands in the infield or i worked afterwards cleaning the grounds up. He was always very polite to me and eveytime i saw him he had a smile and i always told myself that is a true racer it didn't matter what he did on the track at the end of the night he had a smile on because he did what he loved doing and that was racing i could see that in him and in his racing. I love all underdogs i only wished i could have gotten to know him better. The only thing that comes to mind is he is with GOD taking the checkered flag up there in heaven and he left us here doing what he loved and worked so hard to do. GOD Speed Billy you will be missed. WITH LOVE ASHLEY Linda Beavers 9:21 PM on September 9, 2007\n\nPlease know that you have been in our thoughts and prayers unceasingly. You have been added to many church prayer lists in the Winchester area and will be continually in a lot of people's prayers. We normally pitted close to Billy at the Grove and enjoyed his presence there. We really think he is in the loving arms of God now, but his presence at the track will be sorely missed. If you need ANYTHING, please do not hesitate to contact us. Love and prayers to Julie, also. God does provide, all we have to do is ask.

Blake (CactusCrew) A friend 3:38 PM on September 8, 2007\n\nTo Billy's family, girlfriend, friends, follow racers, coworkers and race fans: I was at the funeral home this afternoon your support today during a very difficult time was amaizing, the amount of individuals that came out to remember this outstanding, and wonderful young man was so increadibly heart felt, the stories that were shared, the smiles it brought to everyone, along with the tears, was overwelming. We that knew Billy will never forget the way he never let things get to him, the handshake and smile in the pits. He was a great person to know, if you didnt have the pleasure of knowing Billy, it is everything you have read times a million times over. He will be missed everyday, and loved evrey second.

GodSpeed buddy. Gordon Motorsports urc #18 Steve Miller Motorsports 1:05 PM on September 6, 2007\n\nIt was my pleasure to know Billy for only a short time. In that time he shared information on the latest chili cookoff news, his racing and engine program, and gave me my first taste of Trailer Trash Chili. Every time you saw him, you would be greeted with a smile, a wave, or a handshake. Even in the race car when he passed our trailer on his way onto the track, he would wave a greeting. I hope his parents can take some small comfort in knowing that they raised a fine young man who made friends everywhere he went. It always made me smile to see Billy and Julie walking through the pits hand in hand. Their happiness was contagious and obvious. Julie, I hope all the great memories you two had together will help you through this very difficult time. They will be yours forever. Billy wasn't the fastest guy on the track, just the nicest. At the end of the day that made him the biggest winner of all. I deeply regret whatever part my car played in this unspeakable tragedy. --Steve Kim Berkheimer 12:39 PM on September 6, 2007\n\nMay god bless the Kimmel family and friends.... Rest in peace Billy. Steve and Connie Lenhart 12:09 PM on September 6, 2007\n\nWe did not know Billy; however, we know both of his parents. Loosing a child has to be the worst thing anyone can go through.
