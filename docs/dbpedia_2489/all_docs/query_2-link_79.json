        "text": "Chris Economaki, whose gravelly broadcast voice and prolific pen — specifically, his manual Royal typewriter — narrated the rise of auto racing from county-fair dirt tracks to a global multibillion-dollar business, died on Friday in a nursing home in Wyckoff, N.J. He was 91.\n\nHis death was announced by National Speed Sport News, which Mr. Economaki owned, edited, published and transformed into, by most estimations, the bible of motor racing. He also wrote a column for it for 74 years.\n\nMr. Economaki maintained a romance with racing from the time he was a child sneaking over, under or through a fence into a raceway near his home in Ridgewood, N.J. He was soon selling photos he took with his Kodak Brownie camera and hawking the earliest editions of National Speed Sport News, then called National Auto Racing News, a weekly tabloid. By 14, he was writing a column, “Gas-O-Lines,” for the paper.\n\nHe introduced his distinctive spoken voice in 1951 to announce races at various tracks. It reminded some of a rumbling racing engine. A decade later, hired by ABC, he became one of the first television commentators in the sport. He forged a niche by explaining what mechanics and tire-changers did at pit stops.\n\nMr. Economaki reprised the role at CBS, ESPN and other networks, channels and radio stations. When Hollywood directors needed a racetrack announcer or commentator, they turned to him. He twice played himself in movies, in “Six Pack” (1982) and “Stroker Ace” (1983).\n\nMr. Economaki was a fixture in the sport in all its variations, showing up at Indianapolis, go-cart tracks, the Grand Prix circuit and drag races. Bill France Sr., who was often called the father of Nascar, was his patron. The champion driver Mario Andretti said, “If he wasn’t aware of you, you simply were not a factor in the sport.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
