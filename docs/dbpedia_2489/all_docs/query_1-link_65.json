She passed away on May 21, 2024, in Havre, Mont. Her sudden departure has left a void that cannot be filled, and has deeply impacted her family and friends.\n\nMadi was a radiant soul who brought joy to everyone she encountered. Her captivating beauty was only surpassed by the warmth of her heart. With her gorgeous long red hair cascading down her back and hazel eyes that sparkled with kindness, she had an enchanting presence wherever she went. Her beautiful smile and infectious laughter could brighten any room. She loved people, and she touched so many more than she could ever know.\n\nFrom early childhood into adulthood, Madi’s endearing nature shone brightly through various stages of life. As a child, playing dress-up alongside big sister Alex, or, later, cheering passionately for Powell County Cheerleaders during high school years – every memory reflects the vivacious spirit that defined Madi. She was the best big sister to her four younger siblings, always being there for them. Madi attended grade school in Helena and Deer Lodge, graduating from Powell County High School in 2013.\n\nMadi was pursuing nursing studies at MSU/MT Tech before becoming a devoted stay-at-home mom after welcoming Blakely, Knox and Zephyr into this world – Madi exemplified resilience amidst unexpected turns in life’s journey.\n\nHer love for being a mother was her greatest joy; she loved her three babies more than anything in the whole world. This was evident in every smile she shared with her children while taking them to the park or creating art together at home. She loved building with Knox, and her way of fixing Blakely’s hair was so beautiful. Madi found immense fulfillment in nurturing their young hearts and minds. With the time she had with Zephyr she was so in love, his time on earth was short, but this precious baby boy touched all of us.\n\nShe lived life to its fullest through simple pleasures like spending time with loved ones or embarking on adventures – camping under starlit skies, and playing games with family and friends were some of her favorite pastimes. Madi’s spirit exuded vitality as she embraced each day with enthusiasm and always looking beautiful – encouraging others to “Stay Wild” and savor life’s precious moments.\n\nThe bond between siblings held special significance for Madi as evidenced by cherished memories created alongside sisters and brothers during festive seasons spent making Christmas cookies together or simply reveling in each other’s company throughout their lives.\n\nMadi’s legacy is carried forward by her two beautiful children: Blakely Antila (daughter), Knox Antila (son). She leaves behind her grieving parents, Marcie and Jeff Rahm and Shannon and Daylen King; sisters, Alex King, Olyvia King and Molly Rahm; brothers, Ozzie King and Will Rahm – all of whom cherished her dearly.\n\nThe loss of our precious Madi girl reverberates deeply within our hearts as we grapple with the reality that we will never again witness her radiant smile nor hear the melody of her laughter filling our lives once more.\n\nMay you rest peacefully now dear Madi – cradling your beloved baby boy close while looking down upon us from above as the angel you are.\n\nYour gentle spirit will forever remain etched within our souls. We love you endlessly.

Cecil passed on June 20. His young life was spent in Grassy Butte, N.D., and Sidney, Mont. He had an affinity for horses, which started in childhood. He and his sister, Cleo, rode to grade school on horseback where they had a stable to keep the horses during the day. He was a renowned horseman and trained many excellent working horses throughout his life. There was one he failed to break, and it had a career as a professional bucking horse.\n\nCecil loved the Lord, his family and his country. He served in the United States Air Force for four years. It was there he converted to Christianity, and he served the Lord the rest of his days.\n\nAfter leaving the military, he received a degree from St. Paul Bible College and then went to school to become a Radiology Technologist, which helped pay for the babies that followed. He married Eva Ramer and they had four children, who they raised on ranches in Montana, Texas, California and Oregon. He was a wonderful Dad and the hardest working man we\n\nSee Neckels page 8\n\nNeckels from page 3\n\nhave ever known. While ranch life wasn’t easy, the days were fun when working with Dad.\n\nHe retired from ranching and moved to Idaho where he worked on seasonal fires and local ranches. He and Eva then moved to Deer Lodge where he was very active in his community. He was a member of the Honor Guard, worked at Jewell Funeral Home, was active in the Tractor Club with his restored Farmall H, and was always willing to lend a helping hand to friends and family. He attended the Lutheran Church, the Mennonite Church in Gold Creek and First Baptist in Deer Lodge.\n\nHe had a love for learning, a quick wit, a great sense of humor, and an enduring interest in his children and grandchildren’s lives. We will miss his daily phone calls and texts. We rejoice in his love for the Lord, and we are thankful he has been released from his earthly body, which he wore out with a life well lived.\n\nHe is survived by brothers, Howard (Jarita) and John Neckels; his wife, Eva Neckels; sons, Bill (Sheila) Neckels and David (Carina) Neckels; daughter, Brenda (Kevin) Myers; grandchildren, Amanda (Mike Tyree) Neckels, Rachael (Matt Edens) Neckels, Tasha (Torey) Owen, Tyrel Azbill and Teagan Azbill; great grandchildren, Wyatt Neckels, Kailey Neckels, Tilly Jo Neckels, Addison Jayne Neckels, Reilly Owen and Maverick Azbill; his many beloved nieces and nephews; and his adopted family, Craig and Nicole Blubaugh.\n\nCecil was preceded in death by his sister, Cleo Strickland; daughter, Rosalie Neckels; and grandson, Benjamin Neckels.\n\nCecil’s services were held June 28. He was laid to rest with Military Honors at Hillcrest Cemetery in Deer Lodge.\n\nMemorials in honor of Cecil are suggested to the Powell County Veterans Honor Guard, 409 Missouri Ave., Deer Lodge, MT 59722, or to a charity of the donor’s choice.\n\nPlease visit axelsonfuneralhome.com to offer the family condolences or to share a memory of Cecil.\n\n​Arnold “Arny” Leo Cordova March 8, 1962 - June 21, 2024\n\nArny Cordova, 62, passed away at home in Deer Lodge on the afternoon of June 21 after a 10-year battle with kidney failure.\n\nHe was born in Embudo, N.M., to Leo Cordova and Carolina Cudney, and was raised in Rock Springs, Wyo.

At the time of his death, he was working on another of his multiple projects he so enjoyed. A memorial service and celebration of his life will take place at 11 a.m., Saturday, July 20, at the GHS gymnasium in Philipsburg.\n\nJack was the youngest child born to Jennie Marie (Ward) and Charles Bill Byam, on Jan. 29, 1947, in Elk City, Idaho. When Jack was a young boy, the family moved from Idaho to Montana where Jack would live the rest of his days. Jack attended school in Philipsburg through the tenth grade. At that time, Jack’s father suffered a work-related accident that left him temporarily unable to work. Jack quit school to help support the family.\n\nJack married Colleen Marie Rose on Nov. 11, 1967. Colleen would often laugh and say her mother warned her about getting tangled up with “that Jack,” as he liked to drive his car on the sidewalk.\n\nDespite the warnings and Jack’s wild antics, Jack and Colleen were married for 39 years until Colleen’s passing on Nov. 23, 2006. Not a day went by that he did not miss her.\n\nBum was a true “Jack of all trades.” He was a master welder and mechanic and was often found in his shop working on his latest project, many times for someone else. From working in a sawmill alongside his best “pard,” Leroy Jacobson, to operating his own logging truck, to placer mining in Idaho and Nevada, Jack could do just about anything.\n\nFor many years, Jack was a millwright at Contact Mining in Philipsburg, working alongside two of his oldest friends, Bill Antonioli and Dave “Wildmeat” Harris.\n\nHe worked at MT Resources in Butte and cut posts in the woods with his four-legged sidekick, Hijoma, by his side. In later years, Jack worked for Granite County as well as the state highway department. Always willing to give of himself, Jack served on the Philipsburg Volunteer Fire Department for many years, and even held the title of “Chief” for a time.\n\nJack was many things, but most of all he was a friend and a helper. Jack would do anything for anyone, never expecting anything in return. A knock at his door with a need for help was energetically met with “let me get my boots on.” Quick with a joke, a funny story or invaluable life advice, Jack left everyone with a smile. He touched the lives of everyone who knew him.\n\nBum will be remembered for his firm handshake, his wit, but more than anything, he will be remembered for his heart, and his profound dedication to raising his girls. How lucky are we that are left behind to have had the privilege of his friendship and joy?\n\nJack is survived by his three daughters Amy Byam (Tony Lotton), Missoula; Mary Jo Carstensen (Chuck Adam), Stevensville; and Carrie Gillen (Jerad), Lewistown. He is also survived by his grandson, Kyle Jacobson (Mackenzie) of Colville, Wash., with whom he shared a very close and special bond, even serving as Kyle’s best man at his wedding. Other survivors include great-grandchildren Bradlee, Dean, and Everlee Jacobson; former son-in-law, Mike Carstensen, and grandson, Zane Carstensen; grandchildren, Emma and Jack Gillen; granddaughter, Erica Schwenk, and great-grandchildren Hazlee and Holden Schwenk and McKinley Gamet; and Angela Jacobson and Jim Pederson, who Bum loved like they were his own. He also leaves behind many dear, beloved friends too numerous to mention, including Chuck Houtz and Scott McDonald.\n\nJack was preceded in death by his wife, Colleen, parents, Jennie and Charlie “Bill” Byam, brother, Norman “Pete” Byam, sister, Norma Key, and brother-in-law, Wayne Key, and dear friends, Leroy Jacobson, Curtis Smith, and Don Schroeder.\n\nIn honor of Bum, and in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Philipsburg Senior Citizens Center or the Philipsburg Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n“The loss is immeasurable, but so is the love left behind.”\n\n​Thomas (Tom) Eder - 1946 - May 24, 2024\n\nTom Eder passed away on Friday, May 24, with his immediate family by his side.

We would love to have his friends and family attend.\n\nPlease bring a chair, your favorite beverage, a side dish and your best good stories about Tom. He loved a good party.

In 1989 Tony moved to Spearfish, S.D., to work at Pope & Talbot where he met his future wife, Samantha Sheufelt.

Tony later worked at Walmart and other locations in Spearfish before moving back to Deer Lodge in 2020.\n\nTony enjoyed sports (LA Rams!), motorcycles and dragons.\n\nHe also liked “rock hounding,” searching for interesting rocks and crystals.

He is also survived by his siblings Tori Gray, Stephanie (Rob) Littleton and Joe (Penni) Gray as well as a large extended family.\n\nTony was preceded in death by his parents and his son Cory.

He leaves a lasting legacy to all the people in his life.\n\nRem was many things in life: fourth generation Montana cowboy, rancher, high school teacher, luthier and bronco buster, was even a doctor for three days with his sister Dr. Francine Mannix; served on many state and county boards, including President of Montana State Grange and was in his 22nd year as Powell County Commissioner, and he served Powell County well. Even though he held three degrees and graduated from Montana State, he was a man of few words, but when he spoke, his words were well thought out, and what he had to say was worth listening to.\n\nRem was a man of integrity, honesty, and kindness, strength, character, who loved the Lord and his family, and it can be said of him: 2 Timothy 4:7 “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 “Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day...”\n\nHe is now rejoicing in Heaven with his dad and mom; our beautiful granddaughter, Lane; and our fun-loving grandson, (Dr) Joshua; many friends and family who have gone before.\n\nOur family as well as many, many friends and people who knew him will miss him always.\n\nA celebration of his life, a life well lived, is set from noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday, June 22, in Garrison at the 45 Barn.

Lastly, she was employed with the State Department of Justice, Title and Registration Bureau.\n\nWhile in Deer Lodge she married Dan Roberts, and their two children were born, Jamie and Matthew Roberts. Later she married Ron Brown, and they had two sons Steven and Taylor Brown.\n\nOver the years, Kathie was involved in her children’s activities. She served as a board member of the Babe Ruth Baseball, USAW Wrestling and AAU Wrestling Clubs, as well as being a member of the Warden Booster Club. Her children were also involved in 4-H clubs, exhibiting and showcasing their prize steers at the fair.\n\nHer retirement years were spent doing the things she enjoyed most: reading, cooking, cross stitch, crossword puzzles, her elephant collection, watching horse races, family visits and crocheting. She spent many hours crocheting baby blankets for the newborns in the family and made many hats for the residents of the Ivy. She taught her granddaughter, Sierra, how to crochet and oversaw Sierra’s creation of potholders earning Sierra a blue ribbon at the fair.\n\nKathie enjoyed countless hours with her family and was loved by all for her conversation, quick wit, laughter and intelligence.

Born on Nov. 22, 1949, in the scenic town of Mendocino, Calif., Mike’s journey through life was marked by a deep love for his family, a passion for country music and a commitment to service.\n\nMike is survived by his devoted wife, Marianne Anderson, with whom he shared a lifetime of love and adventure. He was a proud father to his sons, Jeffrey and James Anderson, and a doting grandfather to Michael, Marisela and Tyler. Although his father, Eugene Anderson, and his mother, Beth Anderson (Welker), along with his brother Scott Anderson, preceded him in death, Mike’s legacy continues through his brothers, Sherman, Robert and David Anderson.\n\nAfter attending high school in Philipsburg, Mike honorably served his country as a Navy veteran aboard the USS America, a Kitty Hawk class supercarrier. Mike’s entrepreneurial spirit also led him to be involved in several family-owned businesses. His professional life was best characterized by his role as the Director of Plant Services at Clover Park Technical College. There, his leadership and generosity touched many lives within his community.\n\nMike’s creative soul found its true expression in country music not only as a singer but also as a song writer. He and his bands were a staple in the Montana, Wyoming and Western Washington music scenes. When he wasn’t strumming his guitar and singing for his fans, early on, Mike could be found racing motocross, riding snowmobiles or out on the boat waterskiing with his wife and sons. Later in life he could usually be found on the golf course and then, most notably, cherishing moments with his grandchildren, his beloved wife and their pets.\n\nThose who knew Mike would describe him as loving, generous and creative - a man who lived his life with a warmth that drew people to him. As Helen Keller once said, “What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.” Mike’s memory and the melodies he created and shared will forever resonate in the hearts of those he loved.\n\nMike’s passing, due to natural causes stemming from Alzheimer’s and Dementia, truly marks the end of an era. His spirit, however, will continue to inspire all who had the privilege of knowing him. Mike Anderson’s life was a melody of love, service and joy—a song that will echo for generations to come.\n\nNorene Joy (Daley) Lynch\n\n​July 1948-April 21, 2024\n\nOn April 21, Norene Joy (Daley) Lynch, 75, loving wife and mother of two children, passed away after prolonged illness in Helena.\n\nNorene was born in July of 1948 in Grand Rapids, Minn., to Gene and Dorothy Daley, and together with her two older brothers relocated to Butte then Deer Lodge as a young girl.
