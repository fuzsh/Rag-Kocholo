Photographers, teachers and others who have to cut paper can now\n\ndo so without danger of losing a finger in the process. Designed to supplant the traditional knife-blade paper cutter, an ingenious device called the Nikor Safety Trimmer\n\nwill soon be generally available. It has a wood base 21 inches square, with a raised\n\nbar along one side. The bar serves as a guide for an enclosed shearing wheel which\n\ncuts the paper by rotation. A clever pulley arrangement built into the moving cutting\n\nunit turns the cutting wheel at a fast speed. Price of the trimmer is $24.50, and it will\n\nbe distributed by Burleigh Brooks, Inc., New York City.\n\nQUICK ON THE DRAW? Policemen, bank guards, target shooters\n\nand others who have a legitimate use for sidearms will be\n\ninterested in a new kind of pistol and revolver holster being\n\ndistributed by Firearms International Company, Washington,\n\nD. C. With this holster you don't \"draw\" — the weapon leaps\n\ninto your hand. This happens since its side springs open when\n\nthe hand closes over the grip. Since this swinging action means\n\nthat the holster can't be concealed, its use by criminals is most\n\nunlikely. Other advantages of the holster are that the pistol cannot be dropped, pulled\n\nout by anyone but the shooter, or discharged accidentally while being brought into\n\nSlug thaf plug into payoff water ... hit him on\n\nthe nose.

Included are fish hooks,\n\nfish eyes, wood, enamel, carving knife, brushes, etc., with instructions and photographs.

Write H\n\nI.\n\nUtica, N.Y.\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\n•\n\nJuly, 1948\n\nTO HELP YOU KEEP SOLVENT. A way of keeping your finances straight has been worked\n\nout by Legionnaire W. P. Machemehl, of Houston, in a new form of checkbook called\n\nthe Chec-Count. The book contains 250 checks imprinted with the user's name and\n\naddress. Each sheet of checks has a form which gives an immediate picture of one's\n\nfinances. As checks are written, information carried into the form provides a simple\n\nbookkeeping system helpful in figuring out budgets, taxes, etc. Easily understood\n\ninstructions are included.\n\nSIMPLIFYING PIPE- SMOKING. Now you can fill that pipe without digging into your old\n\ntobacco pouch. A new wrinkle in pouches, called the Phil-O-Matic, does this work by\n\nmeans of a piston built into one end of a plastic pouch. Tobacco feeds into the pouch\n\nend when the piston is pulled out, and when the piston is released a spring tamps the\n\npipe-bowl full. Made by the Phil-O-Matic Company, Springfield, Ohio, the automatic\n\npouch\n\nwill retail at $1.95.\n\nTAKING THE WORK OUT OF WINDOW SCREENS. A new development in window screens eliminates the need for removing them\n\nwhen windows have to be washed. A new screen, called the\n\nDurall, has a tension design which eliminates heavy side frames\n\nswing freely. A simple twist of the thumb\n\nscrews at the bottom of the screen releases it from the sill,\n\ngiving easy access to the window pane. The Durall screen is\n\nall-metal, made of aluminum, and can be installed from the\n\ninside of the house. Manufacturer is The New York Wire Cloth\n\nso the screen can\n\nCompany, New York\n\nCity.\n\nNO-GLARE HEADLIGHTS. Legionnaire Herbert W. Schwartz of Chicago, has been granted\n\ntwo patents on a device which directs headlight rays out and down to the ground.\n\nHis invention consists of visors which can be attached to sealed beam headlights so\n\nthat the upper half of the lens is covered. Schwartz-Light Visors sell for $3 a pair and\n\ncan be attached in a few minutes.\n\nTO KEEP YOUR LINES STRAIGHT. If you're troubled with electric\n\ncords which snake around your rooms there's a remedy in a\n\nnew gadget called the Reel-Away. Made of brown bakelite, it\n\nis less than four inches in diameter and is only an inch and a\n\nquarter high. It may be attached to the cord of any electrical\n\ndevice without disconnecting the cord. The cord is placed across\n\nthe bottom section, the top is replaced, and by winding the\n\nbottom the excess cord is wound inside the reel. The Reel-Away,\n\nwhich sells for 59c, is the invention of George Eypper, a WW2\n\nveteran, of 150 E. 50th Street,\n\nNew\n\nYork, N. Y.\n\nONCE OVER LIGHTLY. National Lead Company, makers of Dutch Boy paints, have announced \"a revolutionary flat oil paint\" in a new product called Wonsover. Said to\n\nhave unusual density, it provides complete covering power in a single coat. Washable,\n\nit covers wallpaper, woodwork, ceiling, brick and water-mixed paints.\n\nMOTOR\n\nWHEN YOU\n\nPUT ON THE DOGS. Preparing frankfurters at the\n\naccomplished in a tasty, quick and simple manner by\n\nmeans of a new, midget electrical cooker made of plastic. Frankfurters are placed on the carbon electrode prongs in the lower\n\npart of the cooker, and when the lid is closed extensions on\n\ntable\n\nOIL\n\nis\n\neither side of the lid automatically serve as a switch. The current flows through the frankfurter which contains a salt solution that sets up a resistance, thus cooking the frankfurter from\n\nthe inside to the outside in about two minutes.\n\ntuqws msr\n\nSTAYS TOUGH.\n\nYour car's engine needs\n\nHOTTER THAN HOT. Westinghouse engineers are working to develop a superfire, one\n\nthat will burn faster, give off more heat and waste less fuel than any ever built. Such\n\na fire is needed, they say, to drive the engines of the newest jet planes and tomorrow's\n\ngas turbine locomotives and ships.\n\ninstant protection during\n\nwarm-up...\n\nlasting safety\n\nfor all kinds of driving.\n\nPennzoil gives you both!\n\n21 -INCH FISHING ROD. A short, convenient fishing rod which\n\nis said to have the responsive action of a 5-foot rod is the Stubcaster now being introduced. Unlike other short rods, the\n\nStubcaster has a patented coil spring which gives it an action\n\nlike that of the long fellows. Breaking down to 14 inches, the\n\nrod can be carried in a traveling bag or even a briefcase, and it\n\nwill of course fit inside any tackle box. With it the fisherman\n\ncan cast overhand, underhand or sidearm. Only 2V2 feet of\n\nswinging space is needed. The rod is made of high tension, oiltempered spring steel, plated to resist rust, and the handle is\n\npolished aluminum and plastic. Made by Waltco Products,\n\nChicago, the Stubcaster sells for $5.95 without reel.\n\nj.c.k.\n\nInquiries concerning items in Previews should be addressed to Previews Editor,\n\nAinerican Legion Magazine,\n\n1\n\nPark Avenue,\n\nNew\n\nYork, N.

Its\n\ntossing hump was swollen with rage,\n\nand one horn was already rusty with\n\nblood from where\n\nman up\n\nit\n\nhad\n\nkilled a\n\nwo-\n\nthe street.\n\n\"Corran!\" the Spaniard gasped.\n\n\"Run everybody!\" He didn't seem to\n\nrealize that the bull was almost upon\n\nhim now. He hadn't let himself look\n\nback, and he didn't know how\n\nincredibly fast a fighting -bull\n\nis. Then he heard the hard\n\nhooves on the pavement\n\nterrifyingly close, and\n\nhe\n\ntried to\n\nmake\n\nhis\n\nfaster. And suddenly he felt himself boosted into the\n\nair, almost gently. When he came\n\nweakening legs run\n\ndown\n\na\n\nstiletto\n\nhorn was spiked\n\nkilling him in-\n\nthrough his chest,\n\nstantly.\n\nPanic took over the Gran Via. Picture thousands of screaming people\n\nin the big street— in the part that most\n\nresembles Times Square— scrambling,\n\nclawing, even fighting their own families to get to a place of safety away\n\nfrom the maddened beast. For dozens\n\nalong the' sidewalks in back of the\n\nbull it wasn't difficult to get out of\n\nthe square and up the street. Others\n\nslipped into the doorway of the Becquer Theater and stayed motionless\n\nhoping the bull would pass them by.\n\nBut for fifty people caught in the\n\nbottleneck made by two large buildings it was a nightmare. They were\n\nherded and jammed into the wedge\n\nlike sheep in a corral. There was no\n\nway out if the bull decided to charge.\n\nIt was twenty yards away, still standing over the man it had killed, studying the cornered crowd as though\n\ntrying to decide which part of it\n\nwas most\n\ninviting.\n\nA\n\npoliceman\n\nin a safe position in a\n\ndrew\n\nit\n\ndoorway\n\nhis pistol but replaced\n\nhelplessly\n\nwhen he saw\n\nhe would have\n\nto fire di-\n\nrectly into the crowd.\n\n\"No one move!\" He commanded the\n\nfrightened people. Bulls are attracted\n\nby movement and sound, and perhaps\n\nif they didn't move, the bull wouldn't\n\ncharge. They all froze. It made a ridiculous and terrifying charade— the\n\njammed crowd\n\nsilent in different seri-\n\nous attitudes as though having their\n\npicture taken, and confronting them a\n\ngiant animal looking as though it were\n\nonly waiting to get its breath before\n\nannihilating them.\n\nInside the Becquer Theater a hundred yards away people were laughing uproariously at a comedy on the\n\nscreen, oblivious to what was taking\n\nplace outside. Even Diego Fortuna\n\nand his pretty wife, Pili, managed to\n\nforget the sick baby at home and to\n\nlaugh at the antics of Laurel and\n\nHardy— or Fat and Thin as they were\n\nknown\n\nin Spain.\n\nDiego spent most of his afternoons\n\nin the movies these days. What else\n\nwas there for a matador whom they'd\n\ncalled \"too old\" to do? Old! Was\n\nthirty-eight old? It was Luis Morales\n\n—the big Malaga bull critic— who had\n\nstarted it. The best Diego wished for\n\nhim was that he have open wounds on\n\nhis feet and be made to carry the mail.\n\n\"It might have been a good corrida\n\nyesterday,\" Morales had written in\n\nthe Liberal thz-ee years before, \"Except for the annoying creaking of old\n\nFortuna as he swung his cape.\"\n\nIt had been that and\n\nthat only,\n\nFortuna felt, that had started all the\n\nother critics down on him. They all\n\ncalled him \"the Creaker\" afterwards,\n\nand overnight he was ruined. Of\n\ncourse, Diego knew that he hadn't had\n\nthe best season of his life that year\n\nDIEGO\n\nback\n\nreached one cautious hand\n\nAs he did the bull\n\nof him.\n\ntook an ominous step toward him\n\nby any means. But everyone had offseasons. It wasn't because he was old.\n\nEven Joselito and Belmonte had had\n\ntheir off-seasons. It could happen to\n\nanyone. All he needed was one good\n\nfight in Madrid with decent bulls and\n\nhe'd be back on top. For two seasons\n\nnow he hadn't been able to get a fight\n\nin Madrid, or any place for that matter.\n\nNocturnals and second-rate festivals\n\nwere offered to him, but he wasn't\n\nthat low yet. Yet. Meanwhile his dapper suits were fraying, his tailor-made\n\nshirts were welted with repairs, and\n\nhe and his wife had to move to a\n\ncheaper apartment. A very cheap\n\napartment. Then the baby came and\n\nthere were bills, and now the baby\n\nwas sick and there would be more\n\nbills. What the devil did his manager\n\nthink he was doing? Why wasn't he\n\ngetting fights? He — Diego Fortuna —\n\nthe \"Wild Boar of Leon\" — could still\n\nfight better than any of these young\n\npups that were coming along with\n\ntheir filigrana tricks. That wild boar\n\nbusiness was just propaganda. He felt\n\nfear like any other torero. He was\n\nreally a gentle, quiet little man. He\n\nwas no wild boar, but in his best days\n\nthere was no one who could control\n\nand dominate a bull the way Diego\n\nFortuna could. And grace! He reeked\n\nof grace. He wasn't a gypsy but they\n\nused to say that Fortuna had more\n\n\"gitaneria\"— more gypsiness— than\n\nCagancho. The name \"El Jabato de\n\nLeon\" on the billboards used to be\n\nmagic. It could be again if his manager\n\nmake the fool empresarios\n\nforget this \"old\" business!\n\ncould only\n\nMaybe he would have\n\nto take\n\na nocturnal or two after\n\nJust a couple to take care of the\n\nFortuna fighting nocturnals! But\n\nhe had lost a lot of cartel. What made\n\nhim admit it to himself was today when\n\nhe came to the theater. Before sitting\n\ndown he had said to the usher:\n\n\"Chico, the bebe at home is sick. If\n\nthey call here, I am to be paged.\" He\n\nstill spoke with the quiet confidence\n\nof a top-flight matador.\n\nWho shall I page! It had come to\n\nthis. Three or four seasons ago Diego's\n\nlean, sensitive face had been as well\n\nknown to very Spaniard as Alfonso\n\nThirteenth's. Every aficionado has had\n\nhis photograph tacked on the wall —\n\ngenerally the one in uniform where he\n\nwas smiling his shy little-boy smile\n\nand with the famous recalcitrant lock\n\nof hair over his forehead.

For ex-\n\nbirths,\n\nCombination grocery-meat\n\nmilk\n\ndealers,\n\ndepartment\n\nstores, drug stores, and lumber-building materials dealers have a far\n\nlower death rate than the average. At\n\nthe shaky end of the list are heating-plumbing shops, ice cream stands,\n\nample:\n\nstores,\n\nelectrical-supply\n\nstores,\n\nradio\n\nand\n\ncombination stores, and women's accessories stores.\n\nStreets of America, veterans are establishing business beachheads.\n\nThere's no point to\n\nall this\n\ndreary\n\nhistory, of course, unless, like a doctor, you learn something from dis-\n\nsecting a cadaver.

Just as\n\nthe average human today knows that\n\nhis chances of succumbing to heart\n\ndisease or cancer are high, so the GI\n\nretailer can readily learn what diseases his business is most likely to be\n\nsusceptible to.

The men were the most\n\nresponsible leaders of America's newest big-time spectacle, midget auto\n\nracing. They formed a National Automobile Racing League to control their\n\nmany new member associations from\n\ncoast to coast.

Factories\n\nare finding it hard to get suitable men\n\nfor training. Recently one of our largest\n\nmanufacturers told me that his plant\n\nIf\n\nhad hired 35 men as special trainees for\n\ncritical hand finishing, the art that makes\n\nthe difference between just a good gun\n\nand a really fine one.

You get good\n\npay for doing good work, but you must\n\nnot delude yourself with the false idea\n\nthat there is anything dramatic in the\n\nwork. And if you happen to be one of\n\nthe million gun bugs with an idea how\n\nto make a better gun, remember that\n\nmanufacturers figure\n\nit\n\ncosts\n\nthem about\n\n$200,000 just to tool up for a new pistol!\n\nAny new ideas you may have — if they\n\nactually happen to be new, which isn't\n\nlikely — must be good to get attention.\n\nThe arms industry isn't large as Ameri-\n\ncan industries go.
