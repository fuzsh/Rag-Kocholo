        "text": "Ninety-two-year-old auto racing enthusiast Donald Smith is a walking encyclopedia of names, dates and numbers.\n\nIn the long life of the Air Force veteran and former iron worker, there are two numbers, however, that tell an incredible story: 500 and 71.\n\nThe 500 stands for the Indianapolis 500 — \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" — while the 71 stands for how many consecutive times he's attended the marquee event.\n\nOn Sunday, that number will increase to 72 when Smith, who will be sitting with several family members in Stand J, Section 29 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, watches the green flag wave and the cars roar down the straightaway, beginning at 12:19 p.m.\n\n\"When I went to my first Indy race in 1948, to see somebody be able to manipulate a car that fast was just an exciting thing to watch,\" said Smith, who was 19 at the time. \"After that I never missed a year. Nothing could keep me from going.\"\n\nFamily occasion\n\nAlthough he's temporarily wheelchair-bound after a knee replacement in January, Smith won't let that stop him.\n\n\"We have 16 of my family going. They come from New Mexico, California, Florida and here in Erie, and we all meet there each year,\" he said. \"They'll help me get up the 48 steps to my seat.\"\n\nSmith, who has lived in Erie his entire life, has six children, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. His wife of 55 years, Mary Smith, died in 2004 at age 78.\n\n\"They're all racing fans,\" he said, beaming. \"And the family part of going there is what makes it so special.\"\n\nSmith said that he has very good seats — \"They're 28 rows from the track, and have good protection,\" he said — but that wasn't always the case.\n\n\"During my first seven Indy 500s I watched from a 20-foot platform that I built in a tree,\" he said. \"But in 1953 they cut the tree down, so for the next six years I paid $5 to watch from the top of a farm truck.\"\n\nIn 1959 he bought tickets to watch from scaffolding inside the track, and sat there for three more years before moving to his present location, where he's sat for 56 years. And it's a good thing that he moved.\n\n\"The year after I moved, a driver named Roberto Guerrero lost a wheel and it went into the stands and hit the person who was sitting in the very seat where I used to sit,\" he said. \"He didn't see the wheel flying at him, and it killed him.\"\n\nSmith has seen considerable change since his first Indy 500, including ticket prices, of course.\n\n\"Back in 1959 they were $7 per seat, but now they're $94,\" he said. \"I initially had four seats together, and later added two seats nearby, and now have six altogether.\"\n\nHe has a scrapbook that contains all of his tickets from over the years.\n\n\"They're very nice; they have a picture of the previous year's winner on them,\" he said, pointing to some of the tickets.\n\nRacing career\n\nA former race-car driver himself, Smith won more than 200 races in 58 years before retiring at age 77. Most notable was a win at the Philadelphia Grand Prix in 1994, and he won the prestigious Rene Dreyfuss Memorial Award in Sebring, Florida, in 1996.\n\n\"I set all the speed records at the Philadelphia Grand Prix, and I was only the third person to win the Dreyfuss Award in Sebring,\" Smith said. \"In Sebring they presented the trophy to me in front of 100,000 people, but nobody in Erie ever knew about it except my family, because I don't like to brag.\"\n\nAlthough Smith lived in Erie, he did very little racing locally.\n\n\"I started in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and later on all over the country,\" he said. \"I only raced autocross in Erie. I never had time for the stock cars.\"\n\nBut he did have an involvement in local racing.\n\n\"I was chief scorer at a track that used to be on West 26th Street where Champion Ford is now, and also for the stock car races they used to have at Veterans Stadium in the '50s.\"\n\nOne of Smith's most cherished memories from his racing career took place in Erie, though.\n\n\"Of all the races that I won, the one that I'm most proud of was the 24-minute autocross that I won in 1961 at a track that used to be where the Lord's parking lot was on West 12th Street,\" he said.\n\n\"We had about 30 cars in the race, and you had to pick out of a hat the time that you ran, and it took all day to run the event. You could go up to 60 miles per hour on that track, and you had to change a tire and a wheel during the race. It was a thrill to win it.\"\n\nIndy memories\n\nSmith is very knowledgeable of Indy cars and the drivers, and has a quick, textbook-like recollection of every race that he's attended. He also has his special memories.\n\n\"My all-time favorite driver was A.J. Foyt,\" he said. \"I also liked Duane Carter and Cal Niday, a one-legged driver who had a terrible crash in 1955. But the greatest driver was Mario Andretti.\n\n\"Foyt set the most open-wheeled records, but the fact that Andretti was able to do Formula One and become the world champion makes him the greatest American racer that ever lived.\"\n\nSmith's favorite Indy 500 was the 1960 race, he said. \"It was thrilling. Rodger Ward should have won the race, but he didn't; Jim Rathmann won it.\n\n\"My other favorites were in the previous year, 1959, when Rathmann should have won it but Rodger Ward won, and in 1961, when A.J. Foyt and Eddie Sachs had a big duel at the end that Foyt won.\"\n\nHe's also witnessed several terrible accidents over the years.\n\n\"I've seen several drivers die there,\" he said. \"One of the worst accidents that ever occurred there was in 1964, when Dave MacDonald's car, which used gasoline, and Eddie Sachs' car hit together, and they both caught fire, killing them both. I was 100 yards away, and have it all on 8 mm film. It was terrible.\n\n\"But the worst year of all was 1955, when Bill Vukovich, one of my heroes, died. Vukovich, who had won the race the two previous years, was leading by one full lap, and went over Rodger Ward's car that had broken an axle and had gotten turned sideways. Vukovich's car rolled over 12 times and landed upside down and caught fire, and he was killed. It was very depressing for me.\"\n\nAccidents aside, the Indy experience is quite a treat for racing fans like himself, Smith said.\n\n\"The two things that will amaze you the most are that they can put 400,000 people in one place for a sporting event, and that the cars go by so fast that they look like airplanes flying on the ground.\"\n\nSmith's moment\n\nAlthough his 71 consecutive races is likely a record, Smith, surprisingly, has never received an award at Indy. The only recognition he has ever received was to be mentioned during the pre-race driver's meeting at the track in 2017, upon his 70th consecutive race.\n\nSmith's daughter, Kim Smith, 61, from New Mexico, was with him at the time.\n\n\"There were 10,000 people there on Saturday morning, and we were up in the stands, and the CEO of the Verizon-IndyCar Series announced his name and that he had been there 70 years in a row, and the drivers stood up and gave him a standing ovation,\" Kim Smith said.\n\nChoking up over the memory, Donald Smith said, \"When it quieted down, I put my hands up like a megaphone and yelled to them, 'Good luck to all drivers, Godspeed, tally ho.' That's my call sign when I say goodbye to somebody, which came from fighter pilots flying English Spitfires during the Battle of Britain in World War II.\"\n\nKim Smith will be attending her 33rd Indy 500 with her dad on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm really proud of my father for his unbelievable accomplishment,\" she said. \"I love the family part of it, and seeing how excited my dad gets. He's so knowledgeable and has such a great memory, he can tell you everything. He's one of the greatest dads in the world.\"\n\nIndy 500\n\nSunday, noon\n\nTV: WICU\n\nListen: GoErie interviews and podcasts\n\nHometown: Erie\n\nAge: 92\n\nQuick facts:\n\n• Air Force veteran\n\n• Former iron worker\n\n• Raced cars regionally for more than 50 years\n\n• Attended his first Indy 500 in 1948\n\n• Has attended every Indy 500 since\n\nDonald Smith"
