        "text": "The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum is home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fameâ€”where we honor the most notable names in racing history. The IMS Hall of Fame helps preserve the memories and legacies of prominent personalities across the world of motorsports and the entire automotive industry.\n\nThe IMS Hall of Fame was originally founded in 1952 as the Auto Racing Hall of Fame, under the auspices of the Contest Board of the American Automobile Association (AAA). Then, in 1962, IMS Owner and President Anton Hulman Jr. moved the Hall of Fame from Detroit to Indianapolis, where it joined the Museum.\n\nThe name was officially changed to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2018, and the criteria for enshrinement was expanded to include stars of the Brickyard 400 and United States Grand Prix.\n\nEach year, a committee of more than 130 drivers, team owners, journalists, and historians select the new inductees from a ballot of nominees. The selected individuals are then officially inducted into the Hall of Fame at the annual Induction Ceremony."
