        "text": "Roger McCluskey accepts his trophy after winning at Pocono. - Photo courtesy of Jerry Nelson\n\nLong Pond, Penn. (July 30, 1972) – Roger McCluskey finally accomplished what he started out to do nearly one year ago.\n\nThe Tucson, Ariz., driver, who finished 11th in Saturday’s Schaefer 500 championship race, look the lead early in the race Sunday and coasted to an easy victory in the second annual Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono International Raceway.\n\nMcCluskey, who collected 10,000 in purse money for his victory, guided his 1970 Plymouth Superbird to a record time of 127.035 miles per hour. He picked up 1,000 points but has not clinched this year's USAC stock car title.\n\nLast year McCluskey needed only a victory in the Pennsylvania 500 to wrap up his third straight United States Auto Club late model stock car championship. But his car hit the wall on the 173rd lap of the 200-mile race and he lost the decision and the point championship to Butch Hartman.\n\nSunday's pre-race duel between the top USAC drivers and NASCAR darling Richard Petty lasted only 256 miles. Petty, the lone million dollar winner in auto racing, dogged McCluskey, Hartman, Wally Dallenbach and Ramo Stott.\n\nPetty, who was paid a $3,000 appearance lo add glamor t the field, led for 13 laps. But the Randleman, N.C. driver who has won 143 starts since joining NASCAR in 1958, was plagued in the early going by several tire changes.\n\nHe finally was eliminated from the race on the 102nd lap when his 1972 Plymouth blew a left tire and the car's oil line ruptured.\n\nWith Petty out, the race settled down to an apparent duel between McCluskey, who sat on the pole with a qualifying speed of 148.177 miles per hour and Hartman, who went into the race third in the point standings behind McCluskey.\n\nBut Hartman dropped out of contention on the 130th lap when he pitted, and his crew took 3 minutes and 6 seconds to change the entire distributor.\n\nFrom there on it was a one-man show.\n\nFive cars were eliminated from the starting field of 40 right off the bat when Steve Arndt spun in the third straightaway. He was out of the race along with Dick Beinlich, Paul Sizemore, Ken Reiter, H.L. Wilson and Leroy Austin.\n\nAl Unser, who was prematurely declared the winner of the Schaefer 500 before a mass of confusion was finally cleared up, dropped out of Sunday's race after completing 40 laps with clutch failure.\n\nMcCluskey, who won another $7,120 in Saturday's race, lost the lead only when he was in the pits. But while he was on the track there was no stopping him.\n\nAt various points he had lapped the entire field except for Hartman, who ended up second — a final victim of lapping — and his interval between his closest challenger nearly three minutes. He ended four laps down.\n\nDave Marcis, another of the NASCAR drivers who made an appearance in the USAC-sanctioned race, stayed in contention for a while. Rut his 1972 Matador was experiencing carburation trouble and he soon fell behind.\n\nWhether he finished in the top running was elementary, since he was bound to be a victim of penalties. While the pace car was out during yellow flag time, the Skyland, N.C. driver continuously passed slower cars on the track.\n\nUnder USAC rules, cars must fall in line behind the pace car on the yellow flag.\n\nBut under NASCAR rules, with which Marcis is used to dealing with, a driver is allowed to pass slower ears under the yellow. He was finally dropped from fourth to fifth place in the standings.\n\nThe attrition rate, like Saturday's race, took its toll on the drivers. The main thing which the cars went through like peanuts was tires. This was probably due to the fact that the stock cars were not using tires prepared for the sometimes rough Pocono International Raceway surface.\n\nThere were only 17 cars running at the end.\n\nResults –\n\n1.

(July 17, 1973) - The son of the defending champion in the Huron Challenge Cup Championship, Tim McDonough of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, powered his 1970 Chevrolet Nova to victory lane at State Fairgrounds Speedway here Tuesday night as he claimed the main event over a tough field of 24 other competitors.\n\nTim McDonough, who placed second in the first running of the classic last year at State Fairgrounds Speedway, returned this year and earned a total of $715 in the event, which was witnessed by the largest racing crowd ever at the track - over 7,000 people.\n\nThe sellout crowd saw a total of 40 cars from South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa compete in the second running of the $4,215 classic with Miller’s Willie Yost turning in the fastest qualifying time at 26.83 seconds.\n\nThe 20-year-old driving ace from Cedar Rapids made the long haul to Huron this year without his father, Bill McDonough, who won the race last year. The elder McDonough's car has not been working properly since being involved in a recent crash at Oskaloosa. Iowa. Tim and two other drivers completed all of the laps in the main event with Bob Kosiski of Omaha, Neb., and Arlo Becker of Atkins, Iowa, earning second and third respectively. Kosiski drove a 1971 Chevrolet Camaro and Becker a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle.\n\nMcDonough's fastest qualifying time of 27.22 seconds placed him among the top eight, giving him a good starting position in the 50-lap main event.\n\nBecker started the race in the pole position and jumped off to an early lead but McDonough soon put his 454 cubic inch powered racer in the lead for the victory.\n\nSheldon Reding of Harrold, Miller’s Bob Tong and Roger Swenson of Watertown were all one lap behind the top three finishers and placed fourth through sixth respectively. Leo Ray of Rapid City and Pukwana’s Carroll Priebe were two laps down to earn seventh and eighth.\n\nRounding out the top 10 finishers in the main event w ere Britt Williams of Pierre in ninth place and Butch Murner of Rapid City in tenth.\n\nKosiski, who earned the most money during the races with $735 in earnings, was the winner of the trophy dash, which was composed of the eight fastest qualifiers in time trials. His victory came only after the fastest qualifier, Yost, was forced out of action before even one lap was completed.\n\nKosiski, Yost and Reding all made contact in the front straightaway when the green flag went out. forcing Yost into the cement wall. His car suffered considerable damage and had to be scratched for the night.\n\nYost's qualifying time of 26.83 seconds was not a new record at State Fairgrounds Speedway. Kosiski was the second fastest qualifier at 27.00 seconds, followed by Murner at 27.03 seconds and Reding at 27.17 seconds.\n\nAlan Gregg of Pierre had a respectable night, winning the first heat and the consolation. The consolation race was composed of those cars not competing in the main event.\n\nThe second heat found Huron’s Dennis Gross leading all 10 laps but being forced to hold off a persistent Bob Tong of Miller for first place.\n\nA similar battle came in the third heat between Roger Mulder of Sioux Falls and Roger Swenson with Mulder leading all the way for first place.\n\nKosiski was the winner of the fourth heat by a respectable margin.\n\nMartha Wideman, the woman race car driver from Lufkin, Texas, had a somewhat dismal evening with her car. Despite this, she gained many new friends with her friendly personality as evidence when she let Yost drive her car in the consolation race. She was sixth in the first heat and Yost placed seventh in the consolation with her car.\n\nSouth Dakota Senator Harvey Wollman of Hitchcock served as the grand marshal for the challenge cup race, being an honorary flagman and also driving the pace car.\n\nResults –\n\nTrophy dash – Bob Kosiski, Omaha, Neb.\n\nHeat #1 – Alan Gregg, Pierre\n\nHeat #2 – Dennis Gross, Huron\n\nHeat #3 – Roger Mulder, Sioux Falls\n\nHeat #4 – Bob Kosiski\n\nConsolation – Alan Gregg\n\nFeature –\n\n1.
