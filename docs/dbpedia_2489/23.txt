AT his 34th Indianpolis 500, Pancho Carter finally sits at the pole today when that American paean to the automobile vrooms off the starting line.

The crowd of about 400,000 will, as usual, make up the largest one-day turnout at any sports event in any stadium in the world. But they will not hear Duane Carter Sr. talking.

The senior Carter, an outstanding Indianapolis driver in the 1950's, shouts instructions.

''He don't hear me, of course,'' says the father. ''But I tell him what to do - stay away from this guy, you're too close.''

In this apple-pie event, Carter has been the most closely watched driver - not only by his father, but by other drivers, by the American automobile industry, by corporations.

Carter qualified in a car powered by a Buick V-6 engine and raced it to a four-lap record average of 212.583 miles an hour. The No. 2 car, driven by Scott Brayton, also has a Buick engine. Thirty of the remaining 31 cars are powered by the British-built Cosworth.

To some people, Carter's record could herald the return of the American car as a racing machine, to its former symbol of an America on the move. It was an image that became tarnished in the gas crisis of the mid-1970's and by growing concern with pollution.
