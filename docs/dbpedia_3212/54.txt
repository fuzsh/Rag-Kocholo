Jobs in Nottingham

Situated in the East Midlands, the City of Nottingham is probably best known for its importance in the legends of Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.

The history of Nottingham goes back much further, however. In the 7th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Mercia. An 11th century castle was constructed on the River Leen and the settlement gradually developed into a thriving community.

During the 1400s, Nottingham began to export religious sculptures carved from alabaster and then, during the Industrial Revolution, the city experienced significant growth.

Textiles were one of Nottingham's major exports, particularly fine lace. But after World War II, this industry fell into steep decline, as it did across the rest of the country when global competition began to increase.

These days, Nottingham is the home of several of the UK's best-known companies in retail, manufacturing, engineering, technology and finance, making it a great place to find vacancies.

Boots the Chemist, for example, was founded in Nottingham in 1849 and is still headquartered there today. Other companies include Experian, E.ON UK, John Player & Sons, Gala Group, Siemens and Vision Express.

HM Revenue and Customs and the Driving Standards Agency are both based in Nottingham, as are a number of bioscience and pharmaceutical companies.

Meanwhile, Atos Origin has offices in Nottingham - they write software for ticket machines and departure boards at train stations - and other tech companies include Reuters, Crytek and Serif Europe.
