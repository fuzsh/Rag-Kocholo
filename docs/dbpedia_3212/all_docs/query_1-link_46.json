        "text": "The majority of staffers at Crytek UK, which is developing Homefront: The Revolution, have reportedly stopped going into work because of financial issues at the parent game company. According to Kotaku's inside sources, Crytek UK workers put in grievance letters this week with the company and stopped reporting to work. Crytek — which owns multiple studios spread out across the world — is under allegations of failing to pay staff on time, with estimates of over 100 people leaving the company in the past few months. It's unclear how many people permanently exited Crytek UK this week or are just waiting for conditions to improve.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere are rumblings that Deep Silver is discussing with Crytek what will happen next with Homefront: The Revolution. Some Crytek UK employees are reportedly hoping that Deep Silver purchases the Nottingham-based studio outright. IGN has reached out to Deep Silver and Crytek about the situation but didn't hear back from either before publication.\n\nCrytek has previously denied the reports of financial problems at the company. Homefront: The Revolution, meanwhile, is scheduled to release next year on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nEvan Campbell is a freelance news writer who streams games on his Twitch channel, talks about Nintendo weekly on the NF Show, and chats about movies and TV series on Twitter."
