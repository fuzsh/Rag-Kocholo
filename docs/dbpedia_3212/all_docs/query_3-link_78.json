        "text": "Players Experience Intense Tactical Combat in the Volatile but Visually Stunning Overgrown Urban Rainforest of New York City\n\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Get ready to become the deadliest hunter on the planet. Today Electronic Arts Inc. (NAS: EA) and award-winning developer Crytek GmbH announced that Crysis 3, the only game that arms players with the superpowers of the series' signature Nanosuit,is available now at retail stores and Origin.com. Powered by Crytek's proprietary CryENGINE®, Crysis 3 is celebrated by critics for its unparalleled visuals, dynamic tactical gameplay and its deep multiplayer suite. Crysis 3 launches with strong reviews from the world's top game critics, among them: 92% from GameStar Germany, 9 out of 10 from GameTrailers, 90% from CD Action in Poland, 85% from Games Master in the UK and a 9 out of 10 from Multiplayer.it in Italy. Additionally, the New York Daily News has stated that Crysis 3 is \"the most beautifully and technically marvelous video game to date\", giving the game a perfect 5 star review.\n\nRetailers around the world are also getting ready for this week's big launch, with Bob Puzon, Vice President of Merchandising at GameStop stating that \"Crysis 3 is tracking to exceed Crysis 2, making it the biggest launch in the franchise history.\"\n\n\"With its exciting combination of sandbox gameplay, intense tactical warfare and powerful weapons including the signature Nanosuit, Crysis 3 delivers the best of what the Crysis franchise is known for and is the pinnacle of the series,\" stated Cevat Yerli, CEO of Crytek. \"By leveraging the power of CryENGINE we are able to create a Crysis 3 experience that is not only visually stunning but also rich in gameplay and narrative, complete with an enhanced multiplayer suite that will provide fans plenty of fun beneath the Liberty Dome of NYC.\"\n\nDeveloped by Crytek and powered by the proprietary cutting edge CryENGINE technology, Crysis 3 is the next installment in the award-winning Crysis franchise. The series is known for its spectacular visuals, dynamic, open gameplay and its signature Nanosuit that grants players unique powers to assess, adapt and attack in any situation. In Crysis 3, players return to the fight as Prophet on his quest to save mankind. Set in New York, the city has been encased in a Nanodome that has turned this once thriving metropolis into a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands and raging rivers. Seven distinct and treacherous environments become known as the 7 Wonders. This dangerous new world demands advanced weapons and strategies, including the enhanced Nanosuit which provides players a tactical advantage. In addition to the powerful Nanosuit, players wield the devastating Predator bow and cutting-edge alien weaponry to become the deadliest hunter on the planet.\n\nCrysis 3 also contains a robust multiplayer experience featuring 12 visually stunning maps and eight heart-pounding gameplay modes including the all new Hunter mode. An asymmetrical, time based mode, Hunter mode pits 2 players vs. 10 (2 vs. 14 on PC) in matches that begin with two cloaked hunters stalking 10 opposing CELL troopers. Armed only with enhanced Nanosuits and the lethal Predator bow, hunters must systematically stalk and kill the CELL operatives, who in turn must work together as a team as they fight to stay alive before the round ends. The twist is that once a CELL trooper is killed, that player will then respawn as a hunter, joining the others in their attempt to eliminate the remaining CELL operatives before the clock strikes zero. Crysis 3 multiplayer will also feature the debut of the New York Feed, a brand new in-game social feed that will showcase the accomplishments of gamers and their friends while offering dynamic challenges to complete.\n\nCrysis 3 is available now in North America for the Xbox 360® videogame and entertainment system, PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system and PC via Origin.com and will be available in Europe on February 22.
