Do us a favour and have a read of this:\n\nhttp://www.avforums.com/forums/pc-gaming/1197995-console-vs-pc-gaming.html\n\nWith a bit of luck you'll be gone long enough so that those of us who want to discuss Crysis 2 on the Xbox 360 can carry on doing so in the preview thread.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to this game and I don't want to see the thread descend into a format snore.\n\nWut? I never said it will have a low frame rate. As it stands I am not a \"fan boi\" or get involved in those type of threads. For someone who bought an xbox because he liked the controller do you really think I care about higher frame rates etc?\n\nAlthough if I could afford a top end PC gaming rig or if you donated me one I could compare the 2 for ya.\n\nFrom the EA Extranet.\n\nXbox 360 Exclusive Demo Gives Gamers an Early Look at One of the Most Anticipated First Person Shooters of 2011\n\nGuildford, UK.  January 21, 2011  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ERTS) and award-winning developer Crytek GmbH, today announced the Crysis 2 Multiplayer Demo. Starting January 25, the multiplayer demo will be available exclusively on the Xbox 360® videogame and entertainment system for Xbox Live Gold Members and will allow them to experience the unparalleled gameplay variety offered by the franchises signature Nanosuit in a multiplayer setting. In 2010, Crysis 2 was honored with over a dozen awards from critics around the world, in recognition of its intense, addictive and stunning multiplayer. Crysis 2 multiplayer catapults players into a war-torn Manhattan where two teams fight to the death; each using the powers of the Nanosuit to be fast, be strong and be invisible. Maps will be set across Cryteks stunning recreation of New York City, presenting players with vertical gameplay that allows them to strategize, attack and defend from above and below.\n\nCrysis 2 offers a fresh, new take on multiplayer  one that will stand out and establish the game as a top contender in the first person shooter genre, said Cevat Yerli, CEO of Crytek. The Nanosuit gives gamers a sense of power they have yet to experience in any other shooter and having New York City as a backdrop will present a different type of playground with even more possibilities.\n\nThe Crysis 2 Multiplayer Demo will feature the Skyline map , and two game modes; Team Instant Action and Crash Site. Team Instant Action pits two teams against each other as they kill as many opponents as possible to earn higher ranks. In Crash Site, players will battle for control of alien drop pods, earning points by guarding their pods and keeping enemies at bay . Developed by Crytek UK, Cryteks specialist multiplayer studio, Crysis 2 multiplayer will include six gameplay modes and 12 maps set across recognizable locations in New York City. Throughout the campaign, players can earn up to 50 multiplayer ranks and a variety of different upgrades to their weapons and their Nanosuit. To learn more information on the Crysis 2 Multiplayer Demo, please visit Crysis 2 - EA Games.\n\nGamers who pre-order Crysis 2 will receive a copy of the Limited Edition of the game which includes bonuses such as a camouflage skinned SCAR assault rifle and early access to the Holo Decoy attachment, a weapon attachment that projects a moving holographic mirror of the player*. Platinum Dog Tags displaying a players multiplayer rank and stats will also be available with the Limited Edition along with a Bonus XP award which can be used to boost a players rank*.\n\nBuilt on Cryteks new state-of-the-art multiplatform game development system, CryENGINE®3, Crysis 2 will be available for the Xbox 360® videogame and entertainment system, PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system and PC on March 25, 2011 in Europe.

Obviously there will be a difference, and I wouldn't compare it maxed out on consoles to maxed out on PC, because the hardware cost is far different, so it's not a fair comparison. But I was really surprised at how big a difference there was, I would have expected all 3 platforms to run it to the best of their ability, in terms of graphics and frame rate, rather than being overworked.\n\nBut then again, that was a few months ago now, so they have probably optimised it a lot since then."
