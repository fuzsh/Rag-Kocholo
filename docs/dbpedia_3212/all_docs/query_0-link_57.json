        "text": "Willmott Dixon Group in collaboration with Arup has been selected to complete the construction of a £40 million ($62 million) development named as Nottingham One in central Nottingham, UK.\n\nPreviously known as Southreef, the development has been renamed as Nottingham One. Its construction was stalled in 2008 during recession. The development is already structurally complete, with Willmott Dixon undertaking further £5 million ($7.7 million) to complete it.\n\nNottingham One will include 237 residential apartments as well as office, restaurant, leisure and retail facilities. The development is already partially occupied. Willmott Dixon will complete 42 apartments, along with façade and internal works to a further 34 apartments, plus five commercial units to deliver Grade A office space adjacent to the City Council offices.\n\nLocated on the edge of the Creative Quarter district and Southern Gateway business district, the Nottingham One will feature Grade A Office space, which will be available to conduct new businesses. The development also provides office facilities from 7,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet, and is already the UK headquarters for Crytek, the German video gaming company.\n\nThe project is scheduled to complete by December 2013."
