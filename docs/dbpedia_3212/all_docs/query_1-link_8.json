        "text": "A UK-based videogame design team operated as part of the Crytek Studios development group family, Crytek UK is the reincarnation of acclaimed studio Free Radical Games (a company founded by several ex-Rare members.) Free Radical went on to be a development force in the gaming industry, with titles such as the TimeSplitters franchise entries. The company was acquired by Crytek on February 4, 2009 and integrated into Crytek's studio network under the name Crytek UK.\n\nBased in Nottingham, Great Britain, the company leverages and contributes to Crytek technology (including the CryEngine line of next-generation development suites) to create titles for modern gaming platforms."
