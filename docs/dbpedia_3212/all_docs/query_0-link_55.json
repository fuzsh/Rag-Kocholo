        "text": "Shared Vision: Training & Career Development in Nottingham\n\nThe Current Job Market and Employment Opportunities in Nottingham\n\nAlthough relatively small in size, Nottingham is one of the most important economic centres of the East Midlands, as well as one of the most dynamic job markets in the region. Historically, Nottingham was known as a market town that depended heavily on export trade. After the Industrial Revolution, the city became a leading centre in textile manufacturing. This sector has been largely replaced by a varied job market.\n\nThere are approximately 32,000 registered businesses in Nottingham, which provide more than 170,000 jobs and generate revenues to the value of Â£30 billion a year, mainly in the retail, entertainment, and health care sectors. Some important firms in these fields who have set up their head offices in Nottingham, including Boots the Chemist, Gala Group, Vision Express, and Bell Fruit Games. Other important employers are in the financial services and software development industries, such as Experian, Capital One, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, Sherif Europe, Crytek UK, Monumental Games, Heart Internet, and the Nottingham Building Society.\n\nIn recent years, research and development companies have become an important source of local employment, particularly those involved in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Since 2005, the city is one of the designated UK Science Cities, and this fact is an indicator of the potential opportunities for investment, growth, and development existing in Nottingham. Lastly, Nottingham is home to a renowned science park, BioCity, which is the largest of its kind in the United Kingdom.\n\nProfessional career development in Nottingham\n\nThose interested in pursuing a degree in a business related discipline have two major educational providers to choose from. Nottingham University has its own business school, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in management studies, finance, modern languages with business, entrepreneurship, international business, corporate strategy, and innovation. The school has strong ties with local employers, which means that students have an opportunity to put their skills to work through internships and placements. Similarly, Nottingham Trent University runs programmes in strategic management and international business, along with executive MBA courses and professional doctorates.\n\nOther training opportunities exist in the form of government funded modern apprenticeships. Nottingham city council is a good source of information in this respect. Alternatively, you can contact the South Nottingham College and enquire about their business administration and management apprenticeships.\n\nThe Executive Education division at the Nottingham University Business School is a good source of corporate training and professional development opportunities. The school offers open and customised training programmes designed to help businesses and organisations successfully face the challenges of the modern business environment. Courses include leadership for responsible business, risk management, and coaching and mentoring in the workplace. On a similar note, the Business School at Nottingham Trent University offers business consultancy services, short courses, and executive development, together with bespoke corporate training solutions that can also be delivered in-company or on a one to one basis. The school also offers a postgraduate certificate in professional coaching practice. Further coaching, mentoring, and business training opportunities can be found by contacting the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAs you would expect from a major urban centre with a diversified economy, Nottingham offers a large range of business networking opportunities. Most of the main networking organisations have a local chapter in Nottingham, and this includes BNI, the Business Network UK, and Forward Ladies Business Networking. In addition, there are a number of events organised by the Rotary Club of Nottingham, the Nottingham Network Group, Synergy Network, and the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce.\n\nYou'll find more information about business training companies and services on Actual Nottingham.\n\nFurther Considerations: Although not all positions require you to be able to drive, having a drivers license is an advantage, especially if you have no points taken off. If you have undergone advanced driver training that is an even greater advantage. Even if the location you would like to work at is near public transport there may be times when travel to less easily accessible locations is required such as visiting potential clients or company meetings. Being able to drive improves your prospects and makes you more versatile than a candidate who doesn't drive. More information on learning to drive and advanced driving lessons can be found on this site.\n\nScript error: /var/www/html/svtc.org.uk/include/pfxml/PFLinks28.xml is not writable.
