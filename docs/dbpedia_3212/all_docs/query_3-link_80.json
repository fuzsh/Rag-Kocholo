We are looking for a Senior Voice Engineer to join us in creating amazing dialogue for our future titles. As the name would suggest this role requires a great amount of technical expertise but also great people skills. You will be working face to face with actors, directors as well as all other associated teams so a degree of social ambidexterity is a must (which is a pretentious way of saying being able to speak comfortably with game development professionals just as easily as those without any knowledge of the area).
