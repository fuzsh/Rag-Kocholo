        "text": "Homefront: The Revolution has hardly had an easy ride during development. The original game wasn’t well received by reviewers and didn’t exactly sell like hotcakes either, meaning that it was always a somewhat unlikely candidate to spawn a sequel. Still, duties were handed over to what was then known as Crytek UK before a string of difficulties. With the bankruptcy at THQ, restructuring at Crytek, and re-branding by Koch Media, the developer would continue work on its Homefront sequel under a new name – Dambuster Studios.\n\nThe tumultuous events of the last few years make it understandable that the hands on demo at Gamescom is a little bit ropey, but there’s still plenty of promise to the direction that Dambuster are taking the gameplay in. Set in Philadelphia, the heart of the four-year Korean occupation in America, it pits your rag tag band of resistance fighters against a well organised and technologically advanced force.\n\nIn contrast to the original, however, Dambuster are creating a semi-open world for you to play in, replete with a day-night cycle and changeable weather. While the heart of Philadelphia is locked down tight, in order to try and create a serene and peaceful environment for the Korean dignitaries in a Green Zone, the areas surrounding it see the local population living in abject squalor, just trying to get by. That Yellow Zone, however, is a kind of buffer to the sheer carnage and chaos of the Red Zone, where the resistance fighters most actively battle against the KPA forces in the abandoned ruins left by a previous uprising.\n\nIt was into the Red Zone that the playable demo took me, starting off with a fast and furious hit and run attack on a KPA patrol. As the armoured vehicle rounded the corner, I pulled the lever to roll a few flaming barrels of oil down onto the unsuspecting enemies, caused a few explosions, shot a few soldiers and drones before making a break for it before reinforcements arrived. This is the kind of guerrilla warfare that The Revolution tries to capture, of planning a surprise attack, executing it and then turning tail to avoid capture or worse.\n\nOf course, that’s just one option open to you, and strapping an improvised explosive onto the back of a little RC car lets you drive a bomb underneath the APC to blow it up instead. That’s just one of the combinations that you’ll be able to create from the handful of items, in order to gain the upper hand, but you’ve also got a fairly free hand to modify you weaponry as well.\n\nBorrowing a practically identical interface to the Crysis series, you can swap out scopes, underslung attachments and barrels on the fly for a variety of slightly outlandish effects. Swap out the barrel on a shotgun to create the Inferno Launcher, which gouts fire at your foes rather than a spray of shot, or the Freedom Launcher, which adapts a marksman rifle to fire rockets. You might not be as technologically advanced as the KPA, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be inventive.\n\nAs we made our escape, a call came in requesting support elsewhere in the Red Zone, and I set off across the map to try and help out. Philadelphia isn’t a truly open world environment to explore in Homefront, but is split up into a number of large maps for you to roam around and play in. There’s to be an even split between the four desolate, wartorn Red Zones and the four decrepit city slums of the Yellow Zones, where it will be interesting to see how different a tone Dambuster can create. At the heart of all this will be the single Green Zone, reserved for the most audacious of assaults into the very heart of the occupying government.\n\nThe aim, as in most open world shooters these days, is try start to exert control over the world in front of you. Homefront is no different in that regard, with Strike Points where you unlock weapons caches, capture communications equipment and attack each zone’s most heavily fortified strongholds – in this case, featuring a gas station that pumps clouds of poison into the nearby air. Currently they’re rather simplistic, sometimes just requiring you to go there and press a button, but there’s scope for them to be more complex and involved, and there’s the pleasing fact that they don’t stop enemy patrols from coming into an area, but merely establish a greater resistance presence to attack them.\n\nWhile it’s best to get around undetected, lest you find yourself in a pitched battle with KPA air patrols, there are faster and more rudimentary means as well. The area has been designed with getting around on a motorbike in mind, with plenty of ramps to ride up and leap off, if you need to move around the world quickly. Arguably, the Red Zone I saw – admittedly with areas locked off for Gamescom – was really only on the cusp of being big enough to justify hopping onto a bike, but it’s nice to have the option.\n\nAnd that’s really a key part of this Homefront revival, to put more options in your hands as to how to tackle the enemy. You might have more luck simply avoiding the enemy than springing a surprise attack on them, or perhaps it’s easier to head in with a crossbow and stealthily take enemies out one by one instead of a head on assault on the front gates of a compound. We’ve seen such elements at play before, of course, but this setting puts them into a slightly different light, with the need to know when to cut and run. It’s a concept that holds a lot of promise, so here’s hoping that Dambuster can deliver on that vision."
