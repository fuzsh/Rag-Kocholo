        "text": "IT’S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY, but somehow Homefront: The Revolution is set to see the light of day. The first-person shooter has gone through several upheavals during its development. The sequel was announced soon after the original’s launch, but unfortunately, that plan was put into jeopardy after the development team, Kaos Studios, was shuttered and THQ went bankrupt.\n\nEventually, Crytek UK took the reins of the project, but that was soon on shaky ground as Crytek, having financial troubles, had to sell the Homefront property to Koch Media, owner of publisher Deep Silver. Crytek UK was then folded into a new team called Dambuster Studios.\n\nWhat’s remarkable about this turbulent ride is that Homefront: The Revolution maintained its initial vision all the way through. And now, just five months from release, the shooter looks surprisingly good. It’s more forward-thinking than the original as it takes place in Philadelphia after the Greater Korean Republic invades the United States and takes it over. The focus has always been on creating a sandbox military game where players are part of a resistance cell.\n\nThe co-op mode features teams of four who have to work together.\n\nJOIN A FOUR-PERSON SQUAD: In the multiplayer co-op experience, players make their own avatar, who is different from the protagonist in the solo campaign. Players join together in teams of up to four and engage in missions aimed at weakening the grip of the Korean People’s Army on the city of Brotherly Love.\n\n“Every time you go out something is different,” said C.J. Kershner, the senior narrative designer. That means patrols will arrive at different times, enemy positions will switch around as players creep through the bombed-out wasteland of Philadelphia. “It’s a David vs. Goliath scenario. You aren’t going to be a one-man army.”\n\nBut a four-person squad can stand up pretty well against the KPA as long as there’s teamwork involved. I experienced this firsthand in the demo session earlier last week. I was in a squad during the Enemy at the Gate mission, where the team had to hack a few satellites and ambush a KPA patrol.\n\nThe most important thing to have when entering the world of Homefront: The Revolution is a scout. Someone needs to climb to the second or third floor of a building and be the overwatch as the team traverses the terrain. The lookout can spot KPA soldiers hiding behind cars or standing atop porch roofs. Stealth and guerrilla tactics are important in combat. Players need silencers on guns or they’d otherwise alert nearby forces.\n\nOverwatch is an important role for a squad.\n\nAN URBAN VERSION OF FAR CRY: From what I played, the game reminds me a lot of an urban Far Cry. Instead of random wildlife giving players trouble, there are soldiers and mechs that randomly roam around the map and raise hell. Players should know that whatever well-made plans they have, the team must be prepared to improvise as soon as someone is spotted. They need to toss Molotov cocktails to burn heavy soldiers alive. They must hack Wolverine mechs and turn them from threats to allies.\n\nPlayers need to rely on ambushes and hit and run tactics. Of course, allies will lose health and die, but they can be brought back to life any number of times on easy mode and up to three times on normal difficulty. Also, the squad must know that they are going into the mission with limited resources. After every skirmish, it’s vital they loot enemy bodies for ammo. Elsewhere, they have to scavenge wrecked cars for materials so that players can craft items such as C4 bombs on the fly.\n\nPersonally, I died a few times during the mission mainly because I was trying to do stupid things. For instance, during the Enemy at the Gate mission, we found motorcycles stashed away in the building. We were supposed to take them to the next area. I roared down the street running over hapless KPA soldiers, but I wanted to be clever and turn the moped into a bomb that could blow up an armored vehicle. Ideally, I would have stuck some C4 onto the bike and drove it into a checkpoint. Kershner said that players can do that sort of thing. It’s one of the benefits of building a sandbox world.\n\nFire is one of the fastest ways to kill a heavily armored foe.\n\nWHEN PLANS GO AWRY: Unfortunately, I didn’t have any C4. My plan was to crash the motorcycle into the car and toss a Molotov to make it explode. The only problem was that I messed it all up. Instead of ramming the vehicle into the target, I basically drove to them and parked it. Instead of tossing the projectile at the vehicle, I accidentally threw it against a wall. It was a disaster and my teammates had to save me.\n\nIt may have been better if I lured the soldiers to an area with an explosive. Aside from handheld bombs, players will find destructible objects such as propane tanks that explode when shot. Players can also pick up stronger weapons by looting fallen foes or by pillaging support crates that the rebellion sends once players complete an objective.\n\nIt’s a fun experience with a lot of potential for chaos and YouTube-ready moments.\n\nCustomization includes cosmetic items and weapons.\n\nMAKE YOUR OWN HERO: The sandbox world shows promise, but the other aspects of the multiplayer look good as well. The multiplayer offers progression and character creation system that’s fairly deep. Players can design their own avatar and give them their own backstory. Some may be teachers. Others could be ex-gang members. On top of that, players can spend the in-game currency they earn doing co-op missions and buy Gear Crates that have random items, weapons and cosmetic items. It’s reminiscent of Halo 5: Guardians’s REQ system.\n\nAlthough I like the direction the franchise is going with Homefront: The Revolution, I do wish there were some elements the team could make different. Although some items in the environment are destructible, not everything is. I know a world where you can destroy almost anything is asking a lot (One of the few places they’ve done it is Red Faction: Guerrilla), but it would have made the ambush elements more interesting and created new gameplay opportunities. It would make an already interesting sandbox world more dynamic.\n\nBut from what I’ve seen of the co-op experience, Homefront: The Revolution is on track to be one of the more surprising shooters when it’s released on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Mac on May 17.\n\nImages courtesy of Deep Silver"
