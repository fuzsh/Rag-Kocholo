        "text": "Sega Europe has announced today it has acquired Crytek Black Sea and added the studio to the ranks of Halo Wars 2, Total War, and Alien: Isolation developer Creative Assembly, reports GamesIndustry.biz.\n\nThe studio, based in Bulgaria’s capital, will now be called Creative Assembly Sofia.\n\nCrytek Black Sea was established in 2008 after Crytek’s purchase of Black Sea Studios (Knights of Honor, Worldshift). Crytek Black Sea was developing Crytek’s free-to-play MOBA Arena of Fate up until their closure in December 2016. The studio was one of five shuttered by Crytek following a lengthy period of financial strife for the German software company.\n\n“The acquisition of Crytek Black Sea further enhances Sega Europe’s development capabilities and strengthens our ability to output diverse and engaging content for our IP,” said Sega Europe president and COO Jurgen Post, confirming Creative Assembly Sofia will be working exclusively on content for Creative Assembly.\n\nAccording to Post the studio “will prove an invaluable asset given the multitude of unannounced titles currently in the works.”\n\nWith the addition of Creative Assembly Sofia, the global Creative Assembly team has reportedly now grown to over 500 people.\n\nFounded in 1987 Creative Assembly is based in West Sussex, UK. The developer previously operated an overseas branch in Brisbane, Australia but that was re-branded Sega Studios Australia and subsequently closed in 2013.\n\nThe recently-released Halo Wars 2 is Creative Assembly's latest game; you can check out the review here."
