        "text": "Videogame students are being given something to get their teeth into with the launch of a competition inspired by vampires, graveyards and Gothic horror.\n\nThe Off the Map competition is a unique collaboration between Crytek, the British Library and Nottingham Trent University’s annual GameCity festival.\n\nIt has been inspired by material linked with the British Library’s major autumn exhibition, Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination and will challenge degree-level computer programmers and game designers from across the UK to develop videogame-based entries using Crytek’s state-of-the-art CRYENGINE technology.\n\nParticipants can use content from the following themes, which are connected with the British Library’s exhibition:\n\nEngravings and drawings of Whitby, North Yorkshire – used by Bram Stoker as a setting in his classic horror story of Dracula\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s 1842 gothic short story, The Masque of the Red Death\n\nFonthill Abbey – the once stunning 18th century country house in Wiltshire, of which only a fragment remains today.\n\nGameCity director Iain Simons said: “Possibilities for competition entries are endless, really. They might follow a traditional format of adventure or shoot ’em up, or come up with a three-dimensional fly-through simulation.\n\n“Judges will be looking for the most innovative and interesting ways to interpret the British Library exhibits. Once inspired, students can go in any direction they wish, but only if they are brave enough!”\n\nCrytek’s director of global business development, Carl Jones, was thoroughly impressed by last year’s results.\n\n“We watched the students’ projects develop from mere ideas to amazing game structures and final entries. It was very impressive to see participants develop a deep and clear understanding of our Cryengine and general game development.\n\n“Now that Off the Map returns for a second year, we are even more excited to see what everyone’s talent and dedication brings.”\n\nInitial submissions must be made by 5pm on Monday August 4 and the winners will be revealed during the GameCity9 festival in Nottingham in October.\n\nTim Pye, curator of English and Drama at the British Library and of the exhibition, said: “It is always exciting to see researchers using our collections in new and often surprising ways, and Off the Map is a great example of this.\n\n“From Edgar Allan Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death, to Stoker and Whitby, the British Library’s Gothic collections are all extremely evocative, and will provide rich pickings for games designers. We can’t wait to see the results.”\n\nThe competition follows the success of the first Off the Map challenge, won by students from Leicester’s De Montfort University after they developed a stunning recreation of 17th century London inspired by the British Library’s map collections, using the cutting-edge three-dimensional Cryengine technology from Crytek.\n\nTo find out more about the challenge, please visit the GameCity/Off the Map website at http://offthemap.gamecity.org\n\nGameCity is a Nottingham Trent University project run by its School of Arts and Humanities to bring together public and private sector organisations to pioneer innovative thinking and to deliver major research and inclusion projects.\n\nGoing beyond simply playing games, GameCity offers new ways to interact with videogame culture.\n\nTo contact GameCity email info@gamecity.org, telephone 07887633751 or write to GameCity, Antenna, 9 Beck Street, Nottingham, NG1 1EQ.\n\nTo find out more about GameCity visit www.gamecity.org or follow the team on Twitter @gamecity and Facebook www.facebook.com/gamecity.nottingham\n\nAbout the British Library\n\nThe British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and one of the world's greatest research libraries.
