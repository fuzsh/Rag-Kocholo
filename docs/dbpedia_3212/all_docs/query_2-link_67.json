        "text": "Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360.\n\nDevelopers: Crytek Frankfurt (Singleplayer) and Crytek UK (Multiplayer)\n\nCompletion: Main Story completed on Veteran Difficulty (8h 18m)\n\nBackground: Completed Crysis three times, didn’t complete Crysis 2 (roughly 60% of story)\n\nYou may like Crysis 3 if you like: Crysis, Crysis 2, First Person Shooters in general\n\n*Spoilers for The Karate Kid(2010 film) ahead*\n\nWhen you see Dre (Jaden Smith) getting bullied by a chinese boy, you know the film is going to end with Dre beating the Chinese boy using karate and the girl they were fighting over supporting Dre in the last fight. You know that Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) will agree to teach Dre karate. And that is what actually happens; except that Dre learns kung fu from and not karate. Still, you do watch the movie and enjoy seeing Dre learn kung fu.\n\n*Spoilers end here*\n\nIf you’ve seen any of Crysis 3’s trailers or followed it otherwise, you know that your character Prophet is a badass and is going to save the world from an alien threat (temporarily so if the developers want to make more sequels). After all, he is the guy in the suit. Effectively, you ‘know’ what is going to happen in the story. But you still pick up a copy of Crysis 3 off a shelf at the local games store. And when you finish the game, you realise what you ‘knew’ didn’t matter. Not even a bit.\n\nBy placing the emphasis on the journey rather than the somewhat clichéd story, Crysis 3 manages to do something perfectly that its predecessors strived to; it makes you feel believably empowered. In the previous two iterations of the Crysis series, the strength and adaptability provided by the nanosuit in combat made you feel like a total badass; Crysis 3 takes this a notch higher by adding in the predator bow. At this point, you might be feeling,”Awww, c’mon. Do all games these days (read: Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider) gotta have bows? Is it like a fad or something? A nanosuit-wearing supersoldier wielding a bow, seriously? What could possibly be a nuttier idea?” Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe advantage of the predator bow lies with the fact that it can be fired while in cloak mode without losing power. This makes it a go-to weapon for players who prefer playing stealthily. Combine this with nanosuit upgrades to reduce noise of footsteps, cloaking time and power drain speed in cloak mode and you have the perfect predator.\n\nCrysis 3 makes no attempt to force one playstyle over another; players who prefer going out all guns blazing freely do so with any consequence whatsoever. Aggressive players are likely to enjoy most guns; the sound effects are well done and bullet impacts are satisfying. The Typhoon in particular deserves a special mention. All guns, except use-and-throw alien weapons, feature one or more attachments so you that you can adjust to the requirements of combat on the fly. Similarly, nanosuit modules can be changed at the tap of the button without interrupting the often frantic pace of combat. Overall, it makes for a smooth and polished experience with nearly zero compromise.\n\nThe reason for using ‘nearly zero’ is that the choice of nanosuit upgrades is usually a no-brainer; as a result there is no incentive to even try out all of them. In exchange of maintaining balance, the design of the module system sacrifices a bit of flexibility. For example, I picked up the sensor upgrade for faster hacking first and then didn’t buy any of the three alternatives until quite some time.\n\nThe level designs themselves feel organic and act like small sandboxes; overall the levels are linear but there is a lot more freedom when compared to the suffocating Crysis 2 levels. There is also more verticality; I can’t recollect jumping around so much in all my combined playthroughs of Crysis and Crysis 2. This creates a lot of tactical options for tackling enemies. Hacking also adds another dimension to the combat; hacked turrets are usually placed strategically and can finish most of the job for you.\n\nSadly, the AI is dumber than ever. Playing on Veteran (I played the previous games on Soldier), I didn’t face even a semblance of a challenge on most levels. It is a shame that the aliens closely resemble those from Crysis 2 instead of the original Crysis; the humanoid design of the Ceph Grunts doesn’t alter the pace or style of combat in any significant way. There is also a lack of variety in enemies. Overall, kills are fun but rarely satisfying. Also, Ceph AI glitches intermittently, less so than Crysis 2 but frequently enough to be annoying.\n\nIf you are even remotely acquainted with the Crysis series, you might be a tad bit surprised as to why I still haven’t commented on Crysis 3’s graphics. After all, the original Crysis had a fearsome reputation of taxing all but the most hardcore gaming rigs. Crysis 2, while more accomodating, was equally gorgeous with all settings turned to max. Both have them have been considered as heavyweights for benchmarking purposes along with the likes of Battlefield 3 and Batman: Arkham City. As fine as its pedigree is, Crysis 3 is Crytek’s finest yet; bringing back the Best Graphics crown back to the house of Crysis in style.\n\nFrom the gorgeous cascading streams of water to the blades of grass waving with the breeze, Crysis 3’s environments are a sight to behold. With trees growing across buildings and the earth slowly reclaiming a dilapidated New York City, the combination of urban and jungle landscapes is visually arresting and makes the atmosphere feel almost ethereal at times. The game is not short of moments when you just want to let go to soak in the glorious scenery.\n\nWithout throwing about a lot of tech jargon (half of which I myself might not understand), I’d like to say that tesellation and high-res textures really shine through and are thankfully included with the main game. The extensive use of motion capture and detailed facial animations make the characters look so real, you’d be forgiven to mistake the game for a movie (this actually happened with a few guests). To clarify, I talking about in-game character models here not just cutscenes.\n\nCrysis 3’s story is the most heartfelt and simple yet; as a result I connected with it much more than the previous two instalments. The narrative is linear and tight and does a good job of explaining things. Unfortunately, the logs and recordings one finds littered throughout the campaign are repetitive and uninteresting and don’t provide a lot of additional insight into the story. As mentioned earlier, despite the story being somewhat clichéd, I enjoyed it thoroughly, particularly the excellent voice acting for Prophet and Psycho. The story is punctuated by a few truly spectacular set pieces and is well paced. This cuts the campaign length short to about 7-8 hours.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It complements the onscreen action well without drowning out the ambient noise (a complaint I had with Crysis 2). The main theme song ‘New York Memories’ is particularly neat and compliments the tone of the game well.\n\nI forgot to mention the control scheme; it’s so perfect that you’ll hardly notice it.\n\nWhat I felt about Crysis 3:\n\nThe Crysis series is very close to my heart. My first ‘gaming computer’ (read: AMD HD 3450 graphic card, 2GB RAM) was built to play Crysis and it did so admirably well at 1440×900. It was the first FPS that I genuinely enjoyed and I played it three times. Three years later, it managed 20-30 fps on Crysis 2 despite a few driver issues. My brother managed to complete the game; I was a bit north of halfway in the campaign when my my save files got corrupted. I didn’t replay it. My recent build was made to handle two games in particular : Crysis 3 and GTA V. While playing Crysis 3, I’ve often stopped to just watch. I became a bit emotional a couple of times too, the game is that gorgeous.\n\nCrysis 3 refines the formula of the Crysis series to a great extent. The storytelling is genuinely great, the music is awesome, the combat has been fine-tuned to perfection and the graphics can only be described as ‘drool-worthy’. It is disappointing to see the lack of variety and intelligence in enemies sorely hurting the game’s prospects for Game of the Year.\n\nOverall Score : 9.1/10 (Amazing)\n\nPositives:\n\nInsane graphics – beautiful high-res textures, lighting – urban jungle setting\n\nGreat level design with a variety of possible playstyles\n\nBeautiful character models with amazing facial animation and motion capture\n\nGreat story with excellent voice acting\n\nFantastic soundtrack\n\nPredator Bow, guns and attachments all rock (typhoooon!!!)\n\nEye-popping GRAPHICS!\n\nSo-So:\n\nUninteresting upgrades\n\nRepetitive recordings and logs\n\nNegatives:\n\nEnemies/AI lacking in quality and variety\n\nToo short\n\nCeph AI glitches\n\nIdiosyncrasy: Arrows disappear after some time"
