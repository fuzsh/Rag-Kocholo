        "text": "What me back then? I'm pretty sure you're confusing me for someone else.\n\nIt's exactly because the difference and how have much more netcode intensive entities, as ships on space is still not updated to increase that player number. Elite itself doesn't has things like multi-crew (that are undeniably net-code intensive the way they were done), has a limit if i'm not mistaken of 32 Players per area. Side of that i believe it's quite possible, i heard one interesting podcast where one actual Dev-Ops Network Engineer for living (not CIG employee), at the end of last month, that was in touch with the devs on Germany responsible for the Netcode ongoing work for SC was discussing about, how they are going to reach those numbers, it was quite a more detailed tech talk about Netcode and how on CIG side they have this planned and are working on it... To be quite possible to achieve.\n\nI wish i could find a link to that, i'll have to see if it got recorded, so you could get more informed on the matter, it was very interesting.\n\nNo it was not you back then it was Mr.Nowak (and I was very precise about it) and my intention was just to show you that even back then 1,5 year ago we have similar discussion about netcode issues,well as you can see the same problem is not solved and it's almost not visible progress in that area at all.....About the multi-crew ships as I know that is a bit different story in theory as CR said before they suppose to occupy different server and calculate all operations from that multi-crew there first and then send them to \"main\" server,when they are in instance with other players they should see them basically same as small 1 crew ship which is in theory possible but we yet need to see how that works in RL....\n\nNo it was not you back then it was Mr.Nowak (and I was very precise about it) and my intention was just to show you that even back then 1,5 year ago we have similar discussion about netcode issues,well as you can see the same problem is not solved and it's almost not visible progress in that area at all.....About the multi-crew ships as I know that is a bit different story in theory as CR said before they suppose to occupy different servers and calculate all operations there first and then send them to \"main\" server,when they are in instance with other players they should see them basically same as small 1 crew ship which is in theory possible but we yet need to see how that works in RL....\n\nFar what Germany is working on, it isn't finished (this is why the player counts are what they are), is a zone system that lets each ship be its own instance, the interior. A multi-crew capital ship with 20 players inside will still count as 1 player on the instance, as it's not going to process it's interior, but it's still streaming to that instance and vice-versa. This is something done before, where even if you are on a city map and enter X shop, you enter its instance on the background, it's something then that if applied correctly to SC will allow for this intensive netcode content doesn't sacrifice the instance it is on, letting those player numbers to happen. It seems quite complex, but it's not something that wasn't done before were CIG is \"shooting in the dark\" on, but it's something that has to be done correctly. The zone system will not be on SC 2.0 Alpha last i heard of, so this is why i was wondering that the player counts will likely not be any close to the the final number they aim.\n\nFar what Germany is working on, it isn't finished (this is why the player counts are what they are), is a zone system that lets each ship be its own instance, the interior.

Star Marine and the Alpha FPS are not different games, one is simply more polished than the other. The same gameplay mechanics are there, what is not there, are the environments, this is why things look so out of place, and things like when guns are fired they have no hitbox on walls, neither animations or the right lighting, are things related to the environment the FPS combat is taking place on than actually the mechanics of it being working or not. I mean it's not a hard conclusion to get to, well, unfortunately you can't get to it so it seems.\n\nThere was, you just didn't see it. Side of that, that's your opinion. You see nothing, i see the first steps of the PU happening.\n\nWho cares? CR didn't say they didn't count. What he did say was that they would not add any stretch goals that would effect the release of the game.\n\nNo it was not there, no one saw it. Exactly you saw a tech demo, that is what a first step is.\n\nSrry but Crytek is responsible for the netcode in their own engine and don't forget that very same company(Branch) made games like Crysis 1,2,3,warface,far cry...and none of this games was so popular as a MP games,guess why....\n\nYeah Crytek has its fails with the engine, specially got a bit stuck when they almost got Bankrupt... was it last year? Now that Amazon saved them and it's entering the gaming industry Cryengine development seems to be catching up. Side of that it's said Crytek is working with CIG, may it be on that? I really don't know, i know they are involved tough.\n\nWho cares? CR didn't say they didn't count. What he did say was that they would not add any stretch goals that would effect the release of the game.\n\nNo it was not there, no one saw it. Exactly you saw a tech demo, that is what a first step is.\n\nAnd that quote slowly died over 2014 up to its end, the thing that should have been done was being direct on the letter about the ending of the stretch goals update on the game dates. While that wasn't done the backers expectations in terms of dates got re-adjusted for reality. Even today if CR said 2.0 is coming out next week, i believe most active backers around (including me), would not take his word for it. This is why people try to reach the developers directly more and get their comments on this, as things are more realistic there on their internal timeframes.\n\nAs far i would go, was call SC 2.0 a Tech Demo for PU, but by itself, it can be already considered a game, that will be expanded upon for the PU no doubts there, not the game it's meant to be yet, but also not the small demos of X and Y part of the game we had until now.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSo you are saying that CIG's past and history of development does not count? wow. So in other words you don't want people to learn from history. I have to say I don't think I ever expected someone to say that with out joking. You also clearly don't want CIG to be held accountable to what they say or their past. That is a great way for a project to fail.\n\nGame development does not go as perfectly and pretty as some people imagine it, on the case of SC there have been clear fails, things that should not have been said or done. At the end of the day, the game development continues, and that is what really matters. If some people out there want public crucifixions and go banana's over things the company or some people on the company say/do, well.... you won't find me there, unless of course, there are strong reasons to do so, outside the shell of dramatization.\n\nOn its whole point, the several parts of the game working together on a single place, on a larger map, some content inside of it and....\n\nFor the first time people will actually play something that approaches a bit how SC is meant to play at the end.\n\nPretty sure this the whole PU will be built upon SC Alpha 2.0, expanding it, adding the last module for planetside and let the landings happen, add the hangars to it... And so on. No more a Star Citizen that plays on separate demos of X parts of the game.\n\nQuite honestly, unless a draw I picture i can't see how some people can't get to see how they are trying to shape this to. Maybe the prefer ignore that so it's easier to attack the development of the game... I don't know anymore.\n\nI guess conspiracy theories about how it's all a lie, a scam, etc... are more fun to post about?\n\nNo one has called it a lie or a scam. Only you have said that.\n\nIt was also you that said that CIG would show us at CitizenCon, well that didn't happen. You have now changed your tune to saying that CIG clearly have more to show because they didn't wow us at Citizencon, something that has no basis on logic.\n\nOf course the PU will be built from SC 2.0 that is what CIG has said, you are not exactly saying anything new or unknown, why you think people don't see that is well...yet another illogical leap that you have taken. There is nothing to ignore because CIG have not released anything, remember the FPS module that was reviled a year ago and now has been indefinitely delayed, why should people expect anything else from CIG? What has CIG done to show that they can make quality work? The answer is nothing, its just delay after delay and then release junk. As soon as CIG\"s own pattern changes, you will see a change in peoples response to the hot air spoken by CIG, actions speak loader then words and so far words is all CIG have.\n\nYeah Crytek has its fails with the engine, specially got a bit stuck when they almost got Bankrupt... was it last year? Now that Amazon saved them and it's entering the gaming industry Cryengine development seems to be catching up. Side of that it's said Crytek is working with CIG, may it be on that? I really don't know, i know they are involved tough.\n\nAnd that quote slowly died over 2014 up to its end, the thing that should have been done was being direct on the letter about the ending of the stretch goals update on the game dates.

This is why people try to reach the developers directly more and get their comments on this, as things are more realistic there on their internal timeframes.\n\nLOL no they did not, CIG was still giving unrealistic dates through most of this year, heck they still are. Are you even following this game? It makes ZERO difference what happened in dec 2014 because CIG never stated anything had changed. So no that quote didn't slowly die, because quotes don't die, they can only be retracted or contradicted, something CIG didn't bother to do until mid of this year, when it was clear they were bogged down by feature creep. So in other words you don't care that you can't trust the word of the CEO of this game. They are not internal timeframes, that was only the public line after failing at AC and other dates, it was a line that was created by the backers and CIG picked it up in order to over their failure.\n\nAs far i would go, was call SC 2.0 a Tech Demo for PU, but by itself, it can be already considered a game, that will be expanded upon for the PU no doubts there, not the game it's meant to be yet, but also not the small demos of X and Y part of the game we had until now.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNo it can not be considered a game, it has no gameplay. Its has no trading, no mining, no well anything that had to do with activity or accomplishing anything. Its not a game, its even less of a game then AC, at least AC has a score board.\n\nGame development does not go as perfectly and pretty as some people imagine it, on the case of SC there have been clear fails, things that should not have been said or done. At the end of the day, the game development continues, and that is what really matters. If some people out there want public crucifixions and go banana's over things the company or some people on the company say/do, well.... you won't find me there, unless of course, there are strong reasons to do so, outside the shell of dramatization.\n\nNo one said it did, but its not some mysterious magical thing that people keep making it into as an excuse for CIG's failures. And that is all it is, excuses for CIG's ineptitude, and lack of focus on actual gameplay instead of selling more ships.\n\nThe rest of what you said has nothing to do with anything, just your hyperbole. This is the real world, a companies history matters, a companies behavior to its backers matters. Just because people are critical of CIG, it does not mean they are going lol \"banana's\", in fact the only one jumping off the deep in, has been you.\n\nSo again you don't care if CIG has lied, you don't care that you can't trust the word of the CEO (CR). Sorry but many people do care, you might be willing to stick your fingers in your ears and go \"la la la\" and pretend that no of CIG's history happened, but that is not how the rest of the world works."
