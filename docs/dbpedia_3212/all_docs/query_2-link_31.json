        "text": "Homefront: The Revolution is a first-person shooter video game developed by Dambuster Studios and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was released on May 17, 2016 in North America and May 20, 2016 in Europe. The game's storyline is continued in three stand-alone campaign DLC, The Voice of Freedom, Aftermath, and Beyond the Walls.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSetting[]\n\nHomefront: The Revolution is not a continuation of the original Homefront, but rather a re-imagining of the premise. The story takes place in an alternate history setting in which the digital revolution of the 1970s took place at North Korea's Silicon River, a region along the Ryesong River, instead of the \"Silicon Valley\" of Northern California. In 1977, North Korea's original government falls out of favor after a series of devastating floods and Kim Il-sung resigns from office and replaced with a more moderate Premier, Lee Dong-won. Combining business acumen, a technological edge, and the strict order imposed by the Kim dynasty, North Korea has become the most powerful and influential nation on Earth, controlled by the APEX Corporation and led by a Steve Jobs-like figure named Joe Tae-se.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, after years of multiple conflicts in the Middle East under Presidents George W. Bush and John McCain, is a pariah state amongst the international community as well as suffering from massive war debt from purchasing weapons technology from APEX and is in severe economic conditions. In 2025, the United States' economy collapses, forcing the USA to default on their debt to North Korea. Joe Tae-Se's son, APEX CEO and North Korean Premier John Tae-se, (with the approval of the international community) use this as a pretext to invade and occupy the country, using a backdoor installed in all APEX technology to shut down the United States military. Although initially presented as an international humanitarian effort to restore stability to the United States after the economic collapse, the Koreans proceed to strip mine the country for its natural resources to repay the debt and proceed to brutalize the populace in response to a national resistance movement against the occupation. The game takes place in Philadelphia in 2029, four years into the occupation. The new Philadelphia is a heavily policed and oppressed environment, with civilians living in fear as the Korean People's Army patrol multiple districts in the city, aided by American collaborators led by Mayor Simpson.\n\nStory[]\n\nThe game follows Ethan Brady, a new Resistance member whose Resistance cell is expecting a visit from Benjamin Walker, \"The Voice of Freedom\" and leader of the national Resistance against the KPA occupation. Brady's cell is attacked in a KPA raid, and every member of the cell except for Brady are tortured to death by the KPA. Walker arrives, saving Brady and killing the KPA, but ends up wounded in the fight. Brady leaves to make contact with another Resistance cell, but while he's gone the KPA raid Walker's safehouse and capture him. Brady attempts to rendezvous with the new cell, but is mistaken for a Korean spy, beaten unconscious, and nearly tortured by the Resistance, being saved at the last moment when his identity is established. Brady joins the new Resistance cell led by the big-hearted, blue-collar Jack Parrish, whose field commander is volatile, ruthless former criminal Dana Moore. Two other key figures in the cell are Dr. Sam Burnett, a pacifist medical doctor who believes in nonviolent resistance but works with the Resistance anyway in order to treat the victims of the KPA's brutality, and James Crawford, a Resistance spy operating within the KPA ranks as an American collaborator. The Resistance's primary focus is finding Ben Walker and rescuing him.\n\nBrady is sent to work for Ned Sharpe, the Resistance's armorer. However, the armory is raided by KPA forces, during which Ned is killed and the Resistance's weapons stockpile destroyed by a Goliath robot. Brady succeeds in destroying the Goliath and stealing its robot brain, and Parrish comes up with a plan to reprogram the brain and use it to take control of a Goliath, with which the Resistance can break into Independence Hall where Walker is being put on trial by the KPA. Resistance technician Heather Cortez successfully reprograms the robot brain, while Parrish and Brady steal a Goliath from the KPA. However, the Goliath is sabotaged by a mole within the Resistance, ruining the plan to break into Independence Hall.\n\nCrawford comes up with an alternate plan, in which he will pretend to capture Brady so he will be taken inside Independence Hall for the trial, at which point Brady can break free with Crawford's help and disable the Hall's defenses from inside. The plan seems to work, and the Resistance storms into Independence Hall, only to discover there is no trial occurring and the courtroom is actually a sealed trap. Mayor Simpson appears on a video projector to show that Crawford has betrayed the Resistance, and also that the KPA have mentally broken Ben Walker, who gives a national speech calling for the Resistance to surrender. The Resistance manages to escape the trap thanks to Heather storming the Hall with the repaired Goliath, but in the resulting fight Heather is killed and the Goliath destroyed. The KPA proceeds to launch retaliatory strikes against all Resistance outposts in Philadelphia, resulting in the Resistance's near collapse.\n\nAlthough initially heavily demoralized, Parrish and Moore come up with a final last-ditch plan to storm City Hall and capture Mayor Simpson so he can be forced to read a message denouncing the KPA occupation on national TV, just like Walker was forced to denounce the Resistance. Moore sends Brady to release the criminals and killers from the KPA's prison zone to help provide the firepower needed to storm City Hall. The attack on City Hall succeeds, however Mayor Simpson refuses to read the message given to him, stating that the KPA will kill everyone in Philadelphia with nerve gas if they feel they are losing control of the city, claiming that they have secretly already done so with Boston and Pittsburgh. Moore loses control and executes Simpson on live TV in retaliation for Simpson's sexual abuse of her while she was his prisoner. In desperation, Parrish gives a speech urging the American people to rise up against the KPA. Despite lacking Ben Walker's eloquence, Parrish's heartfelt speech succeeds in spurring the people of Philadelphia to rebel.\n\nParrish, Moore, and Brady celebrate their success, but are interrupted by a disgusted Dr. Burnett, who informs them that the KPA are gassing the city, just as Mayor Simpson warned would happen. Feeling that violence has only provoked mass murder, Burnett abandons the Resistance and goes to try to help evacuate the city. Parrish, Moore, and Brady attempt to use the Resistance's captured Surface-to-Air missile launchers to shoot down the airships deploying the nerve gas, only to find that the airships are protected by a swarm of automated drones. Parrish and Brady go to confront Crawford, hoping he knows how to shut down the drone defenses. A frightened Crawford claims the KPA discovered his status as a double agent and forced him to betray the Resistance, and tells Parrish how to shut down the drones in exchange for protection. A disgusted Parrish instead abandons Crawford, leaving it up to Brady to decide whether to spare the traitor or execute him.\n\nWith only a few minutes left until the airships gas the city, Parrish, Moore, and Brady storm Independence Hall where the drone control station is located, only to be stopped by a Goliath. Parrish is shot several times, while Moore grabs an explosive pack and sacrifices herself in order to suicide bomb the Goliath and destroy it. An injured Brady makes a final push to the drone control station, but is overpowered and nearly choked unconscious by a KPA officer before he can deactivate the drones. However, Parrish overcomes his injuries long enough to arrive to kill the KPA officer and save Brady, who sends the signal to shut down the drones. This allows the Resistance to shoot down the KPA airships before they can gas most of the city. Brady helps support the wounded Parrish, the two of them walk outside to watch the airships being shot down, with Parrish declaring that the revolution has begun.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nHomefront: The Revolution is a first-person shooter game set in an open world environment with many districts to explore. The player has to scavenge parts from buildings and stashes to create/modify weapons and equipment. The KPA's weapons are all fingerprint-locked and as such they have a sizable advantage over the resistance. There are also side missions where the player will be called off to carry out tasks like assassinating a high-ranking KPA general or steal a KPA drone. Another new feature introduced was the enhanced ability to modify weapons such as adding a foregrip or a sight in the middle of a firefight or to convert a rifle to a LMG and vice-versa. [1][2]\n\nUnlike the first Homefront, which features a competitive multiplayer mode, The Revolution features a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode known as \"Resistance Mode\". This mode is separated from the main campaign and has its own characters, progression, classes and perks.\n\nWeapons[]\n\nGear[]\n\nGear & Clothing in Homefront: The Revolution (Multiplayer only) Headgear APEX Helmet | Combat Helmet | Skater Helmet | Tactical Helmet | Knit Cap/Beanie | Punk Helmet | Anarchist Helmet | Shock Trooper Helmet | Lawman Hat | Shinobi Cap | Back from the Dead Helmet Eyewear Tactical Shades | Heart Sunglasses | Goggles | Welding Goggles | Biker Goggles | Respirator | Back from the Dead Respirator | Ballistic Mask | Hockey Mask | Sports Mask Neckwear APEX Gorget | Scarf | Bandana | Folded Scarf | Face Scarf | Bow Tie Body Armor APEX Armor | Improvised Vest | Flak Vest | Tactical Vest Pouches\n\nMaterials[]\n\nBatteries\n\nChemicals\n\nPropellant\n\nIgniter\n\nVehicles[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDuring development, people over the age of 18 were able to apply to have their face scanned into the game for NPC models.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
