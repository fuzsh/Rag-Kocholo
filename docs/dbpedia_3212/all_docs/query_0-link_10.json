        "text": "25th September 2009. Crytek UK and GameCity are proud to announce an extraordinary and totally unique collaboration for GameCity Squared, 2009’s iteration of the World’s best loved videogame festival. Not content with allowing players to sample gameplay through the safety of a monitor, for two full days, the entire Festival arena in the Market Square will be transformed into a live, full-scale recreation of the Crysis universe – and you can play it for real.\n\nCrysis: LIVE! pitches each player inside a real-life tropical jungle, complete with exotic flora and fauna, where they’ll need to use the famous ‘Nanosuit’ to avoid deadly enemy soldiers and reach their top secret objective. Crysis : LIVE! Is the only real-life game available that enables players to BECOME INVISIBLE.\n\n“This is a terrifying departure from previous events for the festival, we’re really excited to be able to collaborate with Crytek UK on making this amazing project happen”, says GameCity Director, Iain Simons.\n\nThe game is created, designed and directed by Rob Yescombe – Crytek UK’s Narrative Designer. “A lot of games are extensions of childhood classics”, says Yescombe. “Crysis: LIVE! is like Hide and Seek for the 21st Century – good old fashioned fun but with a Crytek UK twist. I don’t want to spoil too much. You really need to play it”.\n\nYescombe - who also created last year’s legendary Resident Evil: LIVE! - is delighted to be hosting the game in Nottingham. “The folks here really embrace the sentiments of GameCity – which is taking games out of the bedroom, and getting everyone involved; meeting each other, sharing experiences and exchanging stories. It warms the cockles of my heart. I love it.”\n\nCrytek UK are also delighted to announce their further sponsor support of the festival, further increasing their investment in the Cultural reputation of the city.\n\nKarl Hilton, MD of Crytek UK commented, “Crytek is really happy to be a sponsor for Gamecity squared. Nottingham has been the cradle of many successful software companies over the years and Gamecity recognises and contributes to the formidable reputation of the city as a centre of technical excellence in the games industry. Crytek is proud to be part of Nottingham and is looking forward to contributing towards making Gamecity a great success.”\n\nCrysis : LIVE! Runs at GameCity Squared from 29-30 October. GameCity Squared happens all over Nottingham from 27-31 October, 2009.\n\nMedia enquiries to: Alison Beasley, Lincoln Beasley PR.
