On October 29 - 30, Crytek UK will section off an area and create \"a real-life tropical jungle, complete with exotic flora and fauna\" for folks to take part in a real life version of the PC game. In fact, those attending will even be able to try on an actual Nanosuit and, somehow, become invisible while playing this real-life version of the PC title. Crytek UK's Narrative Designer, Rob Yescombe, describes the game as \"Hide and Seek for the 21st Century â€“ good old fashioned fun but with a Crytek UK twist.\" Who's going?[Via Big Download]",
