        "text": "Previously known as Southreef, the development is already structural complete and partly occupied, but stalled in 2008 during the recession and property market downturn. However, it has a bright future under new ownership and a new brand, Nottingham One, with Willmott Dixon taking the £5 million contract to complete it by December 2013.”\n\nWorking in collaboration with project management and engineer consultant, Arup, Willmott Dixon will complete 42 apartments, along with façade and internal works to a further 34 apartments, plus five commercial units to deliver Grade A office space adjacent to the City Council offices. It’s a huge boost for the city as Nottingham One is a pivotal part of the City’s Eastside master plan, being located on the edge of the Creative Quarter district and Southern Gateway business district.\n\nNick Heath, operations director at Willmott Dixon, said: “Nottingham One is a big part of the city’s growth plans, becoming a major focal point on one of the City’s main arterial routes.”\n\nDeputy Leader of Nottingham City Council Graham Chapman said: “This development is a prime example that the market is recovering and Nottingham is a great place to do business. It is really positive news that the scheme is progressing after so many months of stagnation and that a final completion date has now been given. The Southern Gateway Business District is a great place for business with excellent communication links to Nottingham’s transport system and in particular the tram. We are delighted to have Grade A Office Space available to new businesses and look forward to welcoming them to the city.”"
