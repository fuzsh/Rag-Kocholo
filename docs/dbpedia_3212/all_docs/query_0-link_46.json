        "text": "Site Planning Manager jobs\n\nManufacturing businesses need a strong link between their sales and marketing team and those doing the manufacturing and sourcing the raw materials and components. It is no use expecting productivity to simply be able to be increased to satisfy demand; there are so many factors to consider that a large jump in productivity could easily fail to meet it.\n\nThe site planning manager will be tasked with liaising regularly with the sales team and gathering information that will be used to turn productivity up or down. As well as signed off purchase orders that are definitely going ahead, there is also a need to keep abreast of future campaigns and promotions, as these can have huge effects on throughput. The site planning manager will use the demand information to keep the production and procurement teams informed of present and potential demand, so that they can put the wheels in motion for deciding on staffing levels, warehousing and storage needs and, most importantly, securing a supply of raw materials.\n\nAs demand can go down as well as up, the site planning manager’s input will be vital in reducing surplus production, which is costly both in terms of storage costs and reduced cash availability. Certain products, such as non-preservable foodstuffs, simply cannot be overproduced more than the bare minimum of slack, as this is direct waste with no potential for ale at a later date.\n\nThe skills required\n\nCommunicating with the various players in the supply chain will be an everyday occurrence to the site planning manager. Interpreting sometimes tentative information into information that’s usable by the production and procurement teams will require a good sense for expressing probability and certainty so that they can best decide on their next steps.\n\nYou’ll also need excellent IT skills in the shape of using common supply chain solutions as well as the normal office environment packages such as word processors and spreadsheets. These will be the channels via which you arrive at your throughput calculations and present your conclusions to the players in the supply chain.\n\nSite Planning Manager Jobs in Nottingham\n\nSituated in the East Midlands, the City of Nottingham is probably best known for its importance in the legends of Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.\n\nThe history of Nottingham goes back much further, however. In the 7th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Mercia. An 11th century castle was constructed on the River Leen and the settlement gradually developed into a thriving community.\n\nDuring the 1400s, Nottingham began to export religious sculptures carved from alabaster and then, during the Industrial Revolution, the city experienced significant growth.\n\nTextiles were one of Nottingham's major exports, particularly fine lace. But after World War II, this industry fell into steep decline, as it did across the rest of the country when global competition began to increase.\n\nThese days, Nottingham is the home of several of the UK's best-known companies in retail, manufacturing, engineering, technology and finance, making it a great place to find Site Planning Manager vacancies.\n\nBoots the Chemist, for example, was founded in Nottingham in 1849 and is still headquartered there today. Other companies include Experian, E.ON UK, John Player & Sons, Gala Group, Siemens and Vision Express.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs and the Driving Standards Agency are both based in Nottingham, as are a number of bioscience and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nMeanwhile, Atos Origin has offices in Nottingham - they write software for ticket machines and departure boards at train stations - and other tech companies include Reuters, Crytek and Serif Europe.\n\nCast UK’s supply chain opportunities\n\nPeople approach Cast UK for many reasons, whether seeking more job fulfilment or simply relocating with the family, so it’s good to know that we always have the complete range of positions available nationwide.\n\nWe are a growing force in logistics, procurement and supply chain recruitment, partly because these are the only sectors we deal with.
