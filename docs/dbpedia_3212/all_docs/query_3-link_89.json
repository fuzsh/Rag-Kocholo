        "text": "A new game played while wearing virtual reality headgear could encourage more people to take up rock climbing, it has been suggested.\n\nGerman games developer Crytek has created The Climb for use on Oculus.\n\nJamie Smith, of youth climbing development organisation ClimbScotland, hopes it makes young people consider taking up the pursuit for real.\n\nHe said: \"It is awesome to see climbing being developed into a standalone game.\"\n\nThe Climb challenges players to complete solo climbs at locations around the world.\n\nCrytek's other games are mainly \"shooters\" such as Warface or combat-related challenges Ryse and Arena of Fate.\n\nMr Smith, team leader at ClimbScotland which is part of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said it was refreshing to see a game focused entirely on climbing.\n\nHe said: \"Climbing has played a part in many mainstream video games over the last few years, such as Tomb Raider and Assassins Creed, and it's great to see it being given a more realistic approach here.\n\n\"It has a long way to go, though, before it approaches the real thrill of climbing, and we hope the launch of this game and others like it will inspire players to give it ago for real.\""
