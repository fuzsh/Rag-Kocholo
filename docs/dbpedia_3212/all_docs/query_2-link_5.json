        "text": "Frankfurt (Germany), August 11th, 2014 – Crytek's CRYENGINE technology was in full flow recently as games using the groundbreaking development tool went on show at ChinaJoy 2014.\n\nThe annual Shanghai-based expo is the largest conference of its kind in Asia, and attracted thousands of visitors to the city's International Expo Center between July 31st and August 3rd. Among the upcoming titles being shown off to players and press were three CRYENGINE-powered projects; Monster Hunter Online and Legend of Yulong 2 from Tencent Games, and King of Wushu from Snail Games.\n\nAlready a well-known name with gamers around the globe, Monster Hunter Online had a huge presence at ChinaJoy as Tencent shared a demo of their new installment in the hit franchise. Players were treated to exclusive maps, missions and monsters created specifically for the expo, further hyping the imminent arrival of the stunning MMORPG. Tencent also offered a glimpse of the breathtaking world they're building with CRYENGINE for Legend of Yulong 2; another major MMO project in the pipeline. A video of gameplay footage released during ChinaJoy quickly caused a stir among fans of the original game and showed how Crytek's engine is helping the developers to take the series in a dazzling new direction.\n\nFinally, CRYENGINE was also humming under the hood of Snail Games' slick martial arts MOBA, King of Wushu – the first announced Chinese CRYENGINE game for Xbox One and PC . Unleashing the traditional world of Chinese martial arts in an arena setting, King of Wushu is billed as offering a fast-paced, action spin on traditional MOBAs.\n\nCRYENGINE is now available on Steam for a low monthly subscription, meaning developers everywhere can tap into its power as they work to achieve their vision.
