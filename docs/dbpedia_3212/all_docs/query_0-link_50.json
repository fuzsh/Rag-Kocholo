        "text": "When I started playing computer games in the eighties, a major city-wide event celebrating this emerging pastime would have been all but inconceivable. Tabloid-led mainstream thought tended to slot interactive entertainment somewhere between football hooliganism and mass unemployment as a desirable cultural phenomenon.\n\nThankfully things have changed. Five years ago, Nottingham launched GameCity, a four-day celebration of game culture mixing in-depth keynotes on professional development with big public events in the town square. One minute you could be learning about the intricacies of coding physics on an Xbox 360, the next you could be attending a massive music concert dressed as a zombie. It's this diversity that puts GameCity up there with, say, Austin's amazing SWSX festival, as a truly contemporary and inclusive exploration of the digital arts.\n\nThis year's GameCity kicks off on Wednesday at a variety of venues around Nottingham. And with most of the events free, it would be churlish not to experience at least some of the fun. To get you in the mood, here are ten highlights from the programme that no gamer with access to the East Midlands should even consider missing...\n\nThe Guardian Gamesblog Breakfasts\n\nWednesday to Saturday, 9.30-10.30am, The Broadway\n\nOkay, so we had to start with a plug. Each morning of the festival, I'll be hosting a live 'studio debate' in the cafe bar at the Broadway cinema. A panel of handpicked games industry celebrities will be on hand to tackle the key topics of the day, answering questions and discussing issues put forward by our audience. The events are free, but you'll be able to purchase a delicious full English breakfast as you query – and perhaps even shout at – the greatest minds of our gaming generation. And me.\n\nCrysis 2 and Lego Universe game demos\n\nWednesday to Saturday, 10am-6pm, GameCity Lounge\n\nThese two wildly contrasting new titles will be playable throughout the festival. Crysis 2 is set to be one of next year's biggest FPS releases, and the multiplayer component is being built by Crytek's UK office, based in this very city. Meanwhile, Lego Universe is a fascinating MMO based around everyone's favourite building bricks. Just drop in and play when you like.\n\nAdam Saltsman's Ideas Bucket\n\nWednesday to Friday, 10am-6pm, GameCity Lounge\n\nIndie developer Adam 'Atomic' Saltsman, the creator of the brilliant browser game Canabalt, will be creating a whole new title at the show, based on ideas from Gamecity attendees. The final project is set to be designed and coded with help from renowned musical game reviewer, Rebecca Mayes. Have you ever seen a computer game being conceived and written? No? Now's your chance\n\nBraid Director Commentary with Jonathan Blow\n\nWednesday, 4-8pm, Council House Ballroom\n\nThe developer of Braid, one of this generation's most important indie games, will be talking through the development of his agenda-setting title. The offbeat puzzle platformer was one of the first independently produced projects to be released on Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade, introducing console gamers to the delights of the previously esoteric indie dev scene. An amazing opportunity for any wannabe developers.\n\nOne Laugh Left\n\nWednesday, 6.45-11pm, The Forum, £3\n\nA comedy night hosted by Ste, Simon and Ann, the presenters of the award-winning One Life Left radio show. As well as seeing this trio of serious-minded games insiders trying (and possibly 'exhausting') their luck at stand-up, you'll catch the likes of Perrier Award-winner Wil Hodgson and 'Goring and Stokes' from The Edinburgh hit show 'Nerds of a Feather'. It's funny because it's about video games.\n\nInvitation to a Spy Party\n\nThursday, 10.45-11.45am, Council House Ballroom\n\nChris Hecker is an absolute game development star, a fascinating writer and speaker on games technologies and a leading advocate of the indie development scene. He'll be showing off his new project, Spy Party, at this event, and talking through its creation.\n\nListening to LIMBO\n\nThursday, 5-7, the Antenna club\n\nThe ambiguous monochrome Xbox Live adventure title LIMBO was one of the unexpected hits at this year's E3 show in Los Angeles, stealing plenty of column inches from the industry's mega-budget Triple A behemoths. The game's sound designer Martin Stig Anderson will be at GameCity to discuss the title and talk about the techniques used by the development team to conjure its unique atmosphere. A real coup for the festival.\n\nJames Hannigan in Concert and Conversation\n\nThursday, 7.30-9.30pm, St Mary's Church\n\nGameCity always puts on decent music events, and this should be a rather stately and atmospheric example. Composer James Hannigan has scored the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings games as well as Command and Conquer 3, and will be talking about his approach to game soundtracks, in between performances of his key works. The 14th Century St Mary's Church should make a suitably gothic, Hogwartsian venue.\n\nKinecting with Rare\n\nFriday, 2.30-3.30pm, Council House Ballroom\n\nHere's a chance to gain a unique insight into Microsoft's Kinect technology, courtesy of Nick Burton, Executive Producer of Technology and Communications at Rare. The veteran UK developer is responsible for key launch title, Kinect Sports, and has worked closely with Microsoft for a number of years, overseeing the whole avatar system on Xbox Live. If you're interested in the future of motion controlled gaming, this is where you'll need to be."
