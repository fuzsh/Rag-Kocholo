It was granted its city charter in 1897 as part of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nNottingham is home to the National Ice Centre, the National Water Sports Centre, Trent Bridge Test cricket ground, two Football League teams, Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and Nottingham Panthers ice hockey team. Over 60,000 students attend the city’s two universities Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham.\n\nCulturally, there are two large-capacity theatres, numerous museums and art galleries, the Broadway Cinema and several live music venues, including the Nottingham Arena and Rock City, both of which regularly host major UK and international artists.

East Midlands Airport is 13 miles south-west of the city.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, much of Nottingham’s prosperity was founded on the textile industry; in particular, the city became an internationally important centre of lace manufacture.\n\nElectric trams were first introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until the trolleybus network was expanded in 1936. The city’s road network was improved between 1922 and 1932 and trams were reintroduced after 68 years when a new network opened in 2004.\n\nIn the sporting world, Nottingham is home to the world’s oldest professional football club, Notts County, which was formed in 1862. The town’s other football club, Nottingham Forest, (under manager Brian Clough) had a period of success between 1977 and 1993; winning the First Division, four League Cups, a UEFA Super Cup and two European Cups.
