        "text": "Johnmichale's first job in the industry was at Free Radical Design in January 2006, moving from the North of England to Nottingham to start a career in computer game development. A far cry from his home town and home environment he had been raised in.\n\nAn interest in games from a very young age both from a creation and playing point of view forged a healthy obsession with programming, a Bachelors and Masters degree later and the dream of working in the games industry was fulfilled. The hard work was just beginning.\n\nWorking on a high end AAA first person shooter title from the get go, transitioning to work on unreleased Star Wars titles and a short stint at Codemasters in 2009 working on a racing game had left him in no doubt that it was going to be fun, challenging and a changing environment to work in. Moving back to the recently acquired Free Radical studio, now under the name of Crytek UK he got to work on some amazing titles.\n\nFast forward 7 years, after moving to id Stoftware in 2015, he's now working at one of the most prestigious studios in the world, on a different continent, on titles for IPs that gave him nightmares after late night play sessions in dark rooms while his parents thought he had been sleeping."
