        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96 on Thursday.\n\nHer husband, Prince Philip, died on April 9, 2021, at the age of 99.\n\nPhilip and the Queen were married for 73 years and were third cousins through Queen Victoria.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96 on Thursday.\n\nHer funeral will be a national holiday and following it, Queen Elizabeth II will be buried in the King George VI memorial chapel in Windsor, according to The Telegraph.\n\nThe body of her late husband, Prince Philip, who died at age 99 on April 9, 2021, will be moved from the Royal Vault beneath St. George's Chapel to join her.\n\nPrince Philip was the husband of Queen Elizabeth II for more than seven decades and the longest-serving British consort in history.\n\nWhile he was never given the title of king — potentially because he would have outranked the Queen's title, or because of his non-British nationality — he had royal roots long before getting engaged to then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947.\n\nHe and Queen Elizabeth II were also directly related through Queen Victoria.\n\nPhilip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark\n\nPhilip was born on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921 as Philippos Schleswig-Holstein Sonderburg-Glucksburg, according to Reuters.\n\nAs the British royal family's website says, Prince Philip was the fifth child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg, who was of British descent.\n\nPhilip's dad, Prince Andrew, was the younger brother of King Constantine I of Greece and the grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark. Because of his father's Greek and Danish roots, Philip was known as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.\n\nPrince Philip wasn't a resident of the Greek island Corfu for very long.\n\nPolitical instability amid the Greco-Turkish War caused the King of Greece, Constantine I, to abdicate the throne, and Prince Andrew and Princess Alice were forced to leave Corfu with their family in December 1922.\n\nKing George V of England sent a Royal Navy ship to transport the family from Corfu. Then-18-month-old Prince Philip \"was carried to safety in a cot made from an orange box,\" according to the British royal family's website.\n\nPrince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II were cousins through Queen Victoria\n\nPhilip's mother, Princess Alice, was born in 1885 in the presence of her great-grandmother Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, according to Town & Country. Windsor Castle — where Prince Philip's mother was born in the 19th century — is where the duke died.\n\nPrince Philip was related to Queen Victoria as a great-great-grandson through his maternal side, and his future wife was related to the same queen through her paternal family.\n\nKing George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, was a great-grandson of Queen Victoria.\n\nThat made Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth third cousins.\n\nThen-Princess Elizabeth and Philip met for the first time when they were children\n\nThe future Queen and duke first met when in 1934 at the wedding of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark to Prince George, Duke of Kent. At the time, then-Princess Elizabeth was 8, and Philip was 13.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was 13, she visited the Royal Naval College with her family and met Prince Philip again. At the time he was a cadet-in-training, according to the BBC. After the encounter, they started writing letters to each other.\n\nPhilip was described in the press at the time as \"a blond Greek Apollo,\" \"a Viking,\" and \"handsome as any film star,\" according to Town & Country.\n\nThe two announced their engagement in July 1947, shortly after Elizabeth turned 21. The same year, Philip became a naturalized British subject and renounced his Greek and Danish Royal title, according to the royal family.\n\nPhilip also adopted the family name of Mountbatten. His uncle, Prince Louis, changed the family name from Battenberg to Mountbatten during World War I.\n\nPrince Philip and then-Princess Elizabeth married on November 20, 1947, at Westminster Abbey, and Prince Philip gained the titles Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich."
