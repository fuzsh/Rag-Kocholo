        "text": "It has beenannounced that Prince Henrik of Denmark's title will be changing. Queen Margrethe's husband, who is currently known as Prince ConsortHenrik, is to have his titled simplified to Prince Henrik.\n\nThe Royal House ofDenmark made the official announcement about the title change on August 15 and explained that the recently 'retired'81-year-old made the decision himself.\n\nPrince Consort Henrik's title will be simplified\n\n“It was his RoyalHighness's own decision to change his title to the less formal PrinceHenrik. Prince Henrik believes it is better suited to his currentsituation after retirement,” said the Royal House communicationsdirector to The Local.\n\nQueen Margrethe's grandchildren help her celebrate her 76th birthday\n\nThe title changecomes after the royal has spoken openly about wanting to be referredto as King. “I have alwayssaid that I should be a partner, but I am not considered as a partnerbecause I'm not on the same level as my wife which is completelyincomprehensible. All the queens in the history of the world havemade their husbands King consort. Why should I be under my wife? Idon't accept it! I will never accept it,” he told Dutch reportersin 2015.\n\nHenrik has openly discussed his frustrations at not being referred to as King Photo: Getty Images\n\nSpeaking about thesituation with French newspaper Le Figaro last October, he added: “Idecided to call myself Prince Consort in order to find a place inDanish society and a purpose and position in my work as prince,” heremarked.\n\n“It makes me angrythat I am subjected to discrimination. Denmark, which is otherwiseknown as an avid defender of gender equality, is apparently willingto consider husbands as worth less than their wives.”\n\nSign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
