        "text": "So great to have such a large and clear photo from an event that took place such long time ago. So thank you Stig for posting that photo and also for adding the detail of the Empress above. I have to admit that it does look like a part of that diamond and pearl parure she had, but since it was part of the jewels that were sold I cannot see how she managed to salvage a \"small\" piece of it. If I am not mistaken she was photographed wearing something like this in her hair pre-revolution also. The acceptance of the Norwegian throne for Prince Carl (Haakon VII) in 1905 comes to mind - but I could be wrong on this (as I have been on other things). It almost also look like a crown with ribbons hanging to the sides - but this is probably just in my imagination.\n\nWhat I have always found strange ever since I saw this photo from the ball is the fact that Queen Alexandrine is seen not wearing a tiara. It is a fact that she unfortunately did not favour grand jewels, but even so. Then I read yesterday in a newspaper report that she was described as wearing a tiara to the ball. Could it be that she had at some point removed it during the event? I doubt that is the case of course, but it is interesting to see such a difference in a newspaper report and the actual photo from the event. Makes you wonder how much one can actually trust those reports.\n\nAlso, I am curious about the Queen Dowager (Queen Louise). Because of the white hair it is very difficult to see whether she is a wearing a tiara or not - though it does look like there might be something nestled in the hair. Does anyone have a clue of what she might have worn? Did she still have access to the Nassau Pearl tiara at this time?\n\nPrevious Message\n\nPrevious Message\n\nI (and no doubt many others) would love to see a clearer image of the aigrette worn by Empress Marie.\n\nThis detail of the bigger original photo (which I posted some years ago) is a bit clearer:"
