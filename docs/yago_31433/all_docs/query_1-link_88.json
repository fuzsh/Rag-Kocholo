        "text": "Thanks for the news, long time not heard from the Douairière Edouard de Lobkowicz née Princesse Françoise de Bourbon de Parme. She shares ranks with his youngest brother Prince Sixte-Henri de Bourbon de Parme, regarding him as the chef of \"true Carlism\", so sadly not on speaking terms with her Dutch nephews and nieces.\n\nHer son Prince Charles-Henri de Lobkowicz lives some 50 km north of me, at the the Château du Boszt. I have met him a couple of times when he visited the family De Chabannes la Palice (our mayor and his family) at their château here in Lapalisse. I have never seen the Princess Françoise with him. Here a video of the Prince showing his residence in the Bourbonnais (Allier): EMISSION : Le chaÌ‚teau du Bostz - YouTube\n\nPrince Charles Henri Lobkowicz instead is at least on speaking terms with his Parma cousins; i.e. he attended the weddings of Princess Carolina in 2012 and of Prince Jaime last year.\n\nH.R.H. Princess Yolande of Bourbon-Parma, née Princess de Broglie-Revel, passed away on 2 September 2014. She was 86.\n\nBorn as Princess Yolande Marie Gonzague Thérèse de Broglie-Revel, she was the daughter of Prince Joseph de Broglie-Revel and of his wife, née Marie Marguerite de la Cour de Balleroy.She was married from 1951 till they divorced in 1966 to HRH Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma (born in 1926, son of Prince René and of Princess Margrethe, née Princess of Denmark). They became parents of two sons and three daughters (of whom two predeceased their parents).\n\nShe is survived by her former husband, her sons Eric and Charles-Emmanuel, her daughter Sybil, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as by her brother Prince Amaury de Broglie-Revel and his family.\n\nParma\n\nBroglie\n\nShe was a niece of Charlotte and Felix by virtue of her marriage to Prince Michel, whose father was Prince Felix's younger brother (as well as a brother of Empress Zita of Austria and many other siblings).\n\nBy virtue of her marriage to Prince Michel, Yolande was also a sister-in-law to King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania.\n\nBts, I have to make a correction on one point of my previous post: Michel and Yolande didn't divorce in 1966 but only in 1999. In 1966 they officially separated, but didn't divorce for the following 33 years because the deeply religious Princess Yolande didn't agree to the divorce. The main reason for their separation was Prince Michel's affair with Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, started in the early 1960s when she was still married to Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia; Michel and Maria Pia eventually married in 2003.\n\n.\n\nToday, September 27, the family attended the holy mass for the knights 'Cavalieri degli Ordini Dinastici' at the 'Basilica Magistrale Costantiniana di Santa Maria della Steccata' in Parma, Italy, and they attended the presentation of the book \"Les Bourbon Parme, Une famille engagee dans l'historire\" (written by Princess Maria Teresa) at the Biblioteca Palatina in Parma.\n\n** ppe gallery 1 ** ppe gallery 2 **\n\nAnd in the evening a gala dinner was held at the Teatro Regio in Parma:\n\n** ppe gallery 3 **\n\nPrincess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Parma has written a new book, which is entitled \"The Bourbon-Parmas, A Family Engaged In History\". As she is close to them, The Marchioness of Sala, Prince Jaime and Princess Viktoria as well as Princess Margarita attended the book's signing:\n\nMaria Teresa de Bourbon-Parme présente son livre à Parme\n\nMore photos from magazine Oggi.\n\nLa gran riunione dei duchi di Borbone Parma: che eleganza, tra cerimonie e cocktail | People\n\nCountess Roger de La Rochefoucauld, née HRH Princess Isabelle of Bourbon-Parma, passed away on 26 February 2015.\n\nShe was born in Paris on 14 March 1922, the only child of Prince Sixte of Bourbon-Parma and of his wife, née Hedwige de La Rochefoucauld.\n\nHer father was one of the many children of Duke Roberto and Duchess Maria Antonia of Parma, as well as a brother of - among the others - Duke Xavier of Parma, Empress Zita of Austria and Prince Félix of Luxembourg. Her mother was the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Doudeauville.\n\nShe married in 1943 to her distant relative Count Roger de La Rochefoucauld (1915-1970), a grandson of the 3rd Duke d'Estissac. They had five sons together, the eldest of whom died as an infant. They divorced in 1966.\n\nShe is survived by her sons Sixte, Hugues, Charles and Robert and their families.\n\nParma\n\nLa Rochefoucauld\n\nPrince Carlos has borrowed a sum of 990.988 Euros from his mother, princess Irene of The Netherlands. The sum is mentioned in the 'kadaster' as a mortgage for a house in the Achipel neighbourhood in The Hague. He bought the house 3 years ago with his wife for a total sum of 1.025.000 euros.\n\nOfficially the prince lives in a different house than his wife, apparently he is listed in a house in the Benoordenhout in The Hague. However, somebody else is living in that house.\n\nPrinses Irene leent haar zoon Prins Carlos fors bedrag! - Bekende Buren\n\nOn Tuesday 18 September 2015 it was five years ago that the previous Duke of Parma and Piacenza died. The life of Prince Charles Hugues Marie Sixte Robert Louis Jean Georges Benoît Michel de Bourbon de Parme was remembered last Saturday, in the Basilica Santa Maria della Steccata, where he is interred. The Knights and Dames of the royal and ducal dynastic Orders of the House Bourbon-Parma assembled together. In two weeks time the Duke and a delegation of his family will visit Parma, including another Mass in memory of the late Duke.\n\nA picture of the present Duke with his late father.\n\nThe *eccentric* prince Sixte-Henri of Parma released a statement that eh will not attend a dinner which is also attended by 'certain character' from a 'branch of usurpers who seized the Spanish throne'. Now who on earth would he mean\n\nMarlene Koenig has the statement on her blog:\n\nRoyal Musings: Gee - no names please\n\nIt must be the only time I have ever agreed with something the prince said; the claims of Luis Alfonso de Borbon are IMHO rediculous indeed.\n\nPrince Sixte-Henri de Bourbon de Parme has a point however. A Spanish gentleman, descendant from a side-branch of the Royal House of Spain, only linked to France via his grandmother Emmanuelle de Dampierre, suddenly sees himself as the head of the Royal House of France, starting using the propers arms of the Kings of France, creating himself Duc de Touraine, Duc d'Anjou and Duc de Bourbon, creating his sons Duc de Bourgogne and Duc de Berry, one for one titles which belong to the House of France to which neither that gentleman nor his family belongs to...\n\nPrince Sixte-Henri might be seen as a fool here on the forum, he is -in foolishness- supremely bypassed by that Spanish clown, Luis Alfonso.\n\nPanayotis Skinas, former husband of Princess Chantal of Bourbon-Parma, has died on 22 August 2015, aged 78.\n\nHe was born in Athens on 8 March 1937 and married in 1977 to Princess Chantal of Bourbon-Parma, the daughter of Prince Louis (himself one of the youngest sons of Duke Roberto I) and of his wife, née Princess Maria of Savoy (daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele III and Queen Elena of Italy). They became parents of a daughter and a son, Hélène and Alexandre, before divorcing in 1986. Later Princess Chantal remarried to François Henri des Georges.\n\nPanayotis SKINAS avis de dÃ©cÃ¨s et obsÃ¨ques - Paris-7eme-Arrondissement 75007 - Paris - ÃŽle-de-France\n\nPanayotis Skinas, * 1937 | Geneall.net"
