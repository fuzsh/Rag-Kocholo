        "text": "Princess Margaret of Denmark was the fifth child of Prince Valdemar of Denmark and his wife Princess Marie of Orléans. Extensively connected to European royalty, she was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth of England, as well as rulers of Russia, Greece, Hanover and Orléans. She married Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, with whom she would have four children. The couple resided mostly in France but were forced to flee the Nazis during World War II. Escaping through Spain to Portugal to New York, the princess worked making hats while her husband worked at a gas company and her oldest daughter as a shop clerk to make ends meet until the war was over and they were able to return to Paris.\n\nThe Cote d’Azur estate where Princess Margaret and René made their home was recently listed for sale at a no-reserve auction that was to take place May 16. Overlooking the French Riviera and known as La Carriere, the stunning villa melds rustic charm with modern luxury, while the walls provide the ultimate in privacy and security. The list price, prior to auction, was $12 million.\n\nArched windows and stone accents give the villa a unique and enduring style. Warm colors on the walls provide an inviting atmosphere. Antique high-beamed ceilings and a majestic fireplace add grandeur to the living room. Five bedrooms and six bathrooms offer plenty of room for family and guests. A spacious kitchen and gorgeous formal dining room are perfect for entertaining. Multiple terraces offer generous views of the Riviera, the Villefranche Bay and Cap Ferrat, plus the turrets and ramparts of the castle-like surrounding fortress. The landscaped grounds include mature trees, beautiful gardens and a pool surrounded by a stone grotto. The pool complex includes a detached studio.\n\nLa Carriere is in the town of Villefranche sur-Mer, nestled between Nice and Monaco. An international airport is only 15 minutes away. ¦"
