In 2011, in recognition of her services, the Netherlands Red Cross set up the Princess Margriet Fund, which works to help populations at risk to prepare better for natural disasters. To mark the Princess’ 75th birthday in 2018, the Red Cross and the University of Twente established a chair in her name.
