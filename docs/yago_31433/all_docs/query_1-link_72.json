In 1817, a treaty was signed, leaving the duchies to the Bourbons.\n\nFour months after Napoleon’s death, in 1821, Marie Louise married morganatically her lover, Adam-Adalbert, Count and Lord of Neipperg (1775-1829). The couple had two children out of wedlock: Albertine, Countess of Montenuovo (1817-1867) and\n\nWilhelm Albrecht, Count of Montenuovo, later created Prince of Montenuovo (1819-1895). The couple also hadMarie-Louise had a second daughter, Mathilde, Countess of Montenuovo, in 1822.\n\nAfter Neipperg’s death Marie-Louise married morganatically, in 1834, her grand chamberlain, Charles-René, Count of Bombelles (1785-1856).\n\nShe died in December 1847 in Parma and her status as Duchess of Parma and Piacenza passed to Prince Charles of Parma, the grandson of the last reigning Duke of Parma."
