        "text": "Prince Michel de Bourbon-Parme, decorated war hero, businessman, race car driver, author and longtime Palm Beach resident, died Saturday, July 7, 2018, at his summer home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.\n\nHe was 92 and the husband of Princess Maria Pia de Savoia, daughter of King Umberto II of Italy.\n\nBorn Michel Marie Xavier Waldemar Georg Robert Karl Eymar de Bourbon-Parme on March 4, 1926, in Paris, he was the son of Princess Margaret of Denmark, a granddaughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Prince René of the deposed dukedom of Bourbon-Parme.\n\nHe was raised in France and, at age 15, fled with his family from Nazi invaders. They settled in New York, where his mother worked in a hat shop. The prince was enrolled in a Jesuit boarding school in Montreal but was forced to return home after a schoolboy prank led to his expulsion.\n\nBack in New York with his family, he decided to join the war effort.\n\n“My parents tried to talk me out of it,” he told the Palm Beach Daily News in an interview. “But I wanted to get Hitler out of France.\n\nHe was 17.\n\n“I walked into the French Embassy and they laughed at me,” he recalled. “They said ‘We have no French army here, but maybe we can send you to school.’ So I went into the American army and was sent to Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning by train. It was a hell of a trip. It was July 1943. Fort Benning was the hottest place on Earth.”\n\nBy the following December, Prince Michel had earned his commission as a second lieutenant.\n\n“After the ceremony, a man approached and asked if I’d like to join the OSS [Office of Strategic Services]. He said I’d do a lot of traveling and probably see action soon. I asked about the pay, and he told me it was double what I was making then. I said ‘I’m in.’ ”\n\nThat man was William Casey, later director of the CIA, who, coincidentally, also became a Palm Beach resident later in life.\n\nFrom Fort Benning in Georgia, he went to what is now Camp David for training in covert ops. From there he was sent to England and joined the Jedburghs, a top-secret paratrooper group. Each Jedburgh unit comprised a trio of officers from the United States, England, Belgium, Holland or France who were dropped behind enemy lines.\n\nFor every 10 men who served with the Jedburghs, only two came home. Eighty percent of them “just disappeared,” the prince said in the Daily News interview.\n\nPrince Michel remembered the exact date — June 8, right after Normandy — that he was dropped and the names of his comrades, Thomas McPherson from England and Sgt. Brown, the radio operator.\n\nTheir mission was to prevent, by whatever means necessary, Germany’s Das Reich armored division from reaching Normandy.\n\n“I remember blowing up a bridge just as the first tanks were coming across and watching them all drop into the deep river,” Bourbon-Parme recalled.\n\nThe Das Reich did not reach Normandy in time to help the German ground troops.\n\nMission accomplished. The war in Europe would end within a year.\n\nThe Pacific war, meanwhile, still raged, and offered the prince, still a teenager, his next adventure, a jump into French Indochina with five others. Their mission was to find out what the Japanese were doing.\n\nIn June 1945, the six troopers dropped — in broad daylight — into the rice paddies of Hue. As they gathered the supplies that were dropped after them, they were captured by the Vietcong, who were just starting the guerrilla offensive that would become the Vietnam War.\n\nThe prince was held for almost a year. He escaped once and was recaptured. The second time, all six left together and began the long trek through the jungles of Vietnam, heading for Thailand. Two weeks later, the six had become two — three men killed in an ambush and the fourth dragged off and eaten by a tiger as he slept— as they crossed the Thailand border.\n\nNow barely 20, the prince returned to France to be reunited with his family.\n\n“It was wonderful to see them again,” he said. “But I was a different person than the one who left. That kind of experience changes you forever.”\n\nFor his military service, France bestowed on him its highest honor for heroism, the Legion d’honneur, as well as the Croix de Guerre. England awarded him the British Military Cross.\n\nAt the age of 20, he began his civilian life, driving race cars, negotiating contracts for French companies, starting a family.\n\nPrince Michel was married twice. His first marriage, in 1951, to Princess Yolande de Broglie-Revel, the daughter of Prince Joseph de Broglie-Revel and Marguerite de La Cour de Balleroy, produced five children but ended in divorce in 1999.\n\nIn 2004, he married Princess Maria Pia de Savoia, daughter of King Umberto II of Italy and Princess Marie José of Belgium. The couple put their longtime Pendleton Avenue home on the market last year.\n\nAt the request of his son, Charles de Bourbon-Parme, the prince detailed his life’s adventure in a 2010 book titled Un Prince Dans La Tourmente (A Prince in Torment).\n\nIn addition to his wife, Prince Michel is survived by his children, numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His daughters Princess Inés and Princess Victoire predeceased him, the former in 1982 and the latter in 2001.\n\nA service with full military and French national honors will take place at 10:30 a.m. Friday at Les Invalides in Paris."
