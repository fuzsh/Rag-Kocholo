The only daughter of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark, and Princess Marie of Orleans, as per an arrangement at the time of her parents marriage, she was raised Catholic while her brothers were Protestant. In 1921, Princess Margaret married Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, a son of Robert I, Duke of Parma and a brother of Empress Zita of Austria and Prince Felix of Luxembourg. The couple had four children, including Queen Anne of Romania and Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, and resided in quite reduced circumstances in France until the Second World War, when they lived in exile in the United States, where Prince René worked at a gas company, Princess Margaret made hats and Princess Anne worked at Macy’s. The family returned to Paris after the war and the couple continued to be active at royal events including the Wedding of Crown Prince Leopold of Belgium and Princess Astrid of Sweden, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Princess Ingrid of Sweden’s Wedding in 1935, King Christian X’s Silver Jubilee in 1937, and King Frederik IX’s 70th Birthday in 1969. Princess Margaret passed away in Copenhagen the day after her 97th birthday in 1992, the last surviving grandchild of King Christian.\n\nBourbon Parma Tiara | Floral Tiara | Boucheron Pearl Circle Tiara | Chaumet Bourbon-Parma Tiara | Pearl Earrings\n\nBourbon Parma Tiara\n\nFloral Tiara\n\nBoucheron Pearl Circle Tiara\n\nChaumet Bourbon-Parma Tiara\n\nPearl Earrings\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
