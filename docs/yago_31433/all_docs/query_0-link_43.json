        "text": "VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday evening in Monaco, the Grimaldis were out and about at the annual Red Cross Gala. Here’s a look at some of the jewels worn by Princess Charlene and the other guests!\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrince Albert II and Princess Charlene were the only two members of the princely family at this event, as per usual. The gala is an annual charity event that has been held in Monaco since 1948.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCharlene wore a summery green evening gown with a cape, a style that always looks elegant with her lovely broad shoulders.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nShe added a pair of eye-catching statement earrings to her ensemble.\n\nVALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a good close-up of the earrings from Friday’s gala. They are by Repossi, and they feature diamonds and pearls set in gold. There’s also another smoky gemstone set in the stud portion of the earring.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nFriday marked Charlene’s second outing in the earrings. She wore them previously at the Golden Nymph Awards (the closing ceremony of the annual Monte-Carlo Television Festival) in June 2018.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nFor the Red Cross Gala, she kept the rest of her jewels to an absolute minimum, wearing only a slender golden band with a cross detail on her left hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThere were a few other bejeweled guests of note, too. Appropriately, as Charlene wore Repossi jewels, Gio and Alberto Repossi were in attendance.\n\nVALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDame Shirley Bassey was there, sparkling in a major suite of diamond and emerald jewels.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAnd there were more royal connections, too. Charles-Emmanuel of Bourbon-Parma attended the gala with his wife, Constance. He’s the son of the late Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, who had a notable racing career. (That also means that Charles-Emmanuel is the grandson of Prince Rene of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark; his aunt was Queen Anne of Romania.) Constance wore an intriguing set of jewelry, which looks to be set with dark purple amethysts, for the gala on Friday.\n\nSTF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Margaret’s extensive jewelry collection contained a whole lot of one favorite stone: July’s birthstone, the mighty red ruby. Today, we’ve got a closer look at her delicate ruby and diamond girandole earrings.\n\nChristie’s\n\nThe earrings are a classic example of the girandole style. (A “girandole” was originally an elaborate light fixture with several branches for candles, like a small chandelier.) The stud portion of each earring is set with a ruby, as is the largest drop.\n\nSTF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe earrings were favorites of Margaret’s for nearly her entire life. They feature prominently in her pensive 26th birthday portrait, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1956.\n\nGetty Images\n\nShe often wore the earrings for appearances at film premieres and theatrical performances, where she met some of the most famous stars of the era. In 1958, she wore the earrings to meet Sophia Loren and William Holden at the premiere of The Key.\n\nCentral Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nShe also wore the earrings to meet Julie Christie and Geraldine Chaplin after the premiere of Doctor Zhivago in April 1966.\n\nCentral Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nFor both the Doctor Zhivago premiere and the 1972 Royal European Preview of Lauren Bacall’s stage musical, Applause, Margaret paired the girandole earrings with her ruby flower brooch.\n\nKIM KULISH/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 1996, Margaret wore the girandole earrings during a visit to the United States, where she met with former First Lady Nancy Reagan during a dinner for the British Museum Development Trust at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\nChristie’s\n\nAfter her death in 2002, the earrings were some of the numerous jewels from her estate that were sold at auction. In 2006, a buyer purchased the earrings, as well as a fitted leather box from Wartski, for 54,000 pounds.\n\nDPA Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy\n\nThe former royal family of Greece no longer has a throne, but they do still have an impressive jewelry collection — thanks, in part, to Queen Anne-Marie’s Danish royal descent. Today, we’ve got a look at one of the Danish royal heirlooms now in Princess Alexia’s jewelry box: Queen Alexandrine’s Ruby Bow Brooch.\n\nAlbert Nieboer/DPA Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy\n\nIn his book on Denmark’s royal jewels, Bjarne Steen Jensen describes the piece as “a large, asymmetrical bow set with rubies and diamonds.” He notes that the brooch’s design is typical of styles popular at the turn of the twentieth century, around the same time that the future King Christian X of Denmark married Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nIndeed, the published list of wedding gifts received by the future Queen Alexandrine notes that she received a diamond and ruby brooch from her new husband in 1898. Jensen speculates that this bow brooch may have been that gift, especially because the colors of the piece — red and white — are Denmark’s national colors. In the family portrait above, Queen Alexandrine wears the brooch pinned to the bodice of her gown.\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nJensen notes that Alexandrine wore the brooch often throughout her life, and that she often sported it on special occasions. One such moment came in 1937, when King Christian celebrated his silver jubilee. She wore the brooch pinned to the bodice of her dress for a celebratory reception at parliament; it’s hidden in the photograph above by the large cuff of her jacket.\n\nWhen Alexandrine died in 1952, she left the brooch to her daughter-in-law, Queen Ingrid. Jensen speculates that she may have left the brooch specifically to Ingrid because it could be worn with the Danish Ruby Parure. Indeed, Ingrid did sometimes wear the bow brooch with the rest of the royal rubies, but she also wore it for less formal occasions, including a visit to a Viennese museum in 1962 (pictured above).\n\nDPA Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy\n\nThe brooch is now worn by Ingrid’s granddaughter, Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark. Alexia actually wore the brooch during Ingrid’s lifetime, for a luncheon held during Queen Margrethe II’s 60th birthday celebrations in April 2000. Ingrid died a few months later, and Alexia has continued to wear the brooch in the years since her passing, mainly at royal events in Denmark. In 2004, she wore the brooch for the royal wedding of her cousin, Crown Prince Frederik, and Mary Donaldson.\n\nAlbert Nieboer/DPA Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy\n\nShe wore the brooch for another Danish family wedding — the nuptials of Prince Joachim and Marie Cavallier — in May 2008.\n\nAlbert Nieboer/DPA Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy\n\nAnd in April 2010, she pinned the brooch to the waist of her gown as she attended a dinner at Fredensborg Palace to mark Queen Margrethe’s 70th birthday."
