        "text": "Michel Bourbon-Parme is the son of Prince Ren√© of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark. He grew up in Paris, where his father worked for a propane gas tank manufacturer. In 1940, Prince Michel and his family fled the German invasion and left for New York. Aged 17 he joined the U.S. Army and volunteered for the OSS (American equivalent of SOE). He subsequently joined Operation Jedburgh and was part of Team Quinine. They were a group of three (with Maj. Tommy Macpherson and Sgt Arthur Brown) who parachuted into Nazi-occupied France, where Michel operated as a saboteur. He also fought in the Vietnam war and almost starved to death."
