        "text": "The couple resided mostly in France but were forced to flee the Nazis during World War II. Escaping through Spain to Portugal and then New York, the princess made a living making hats while her husband worked at a gas company and her oldest daughter as a shop clerk to make ends meet until the war was over and they were able to return to Paris.\n\nArched windows-and-stone accents give the villa a unique and enduring style. Warm colours on the walls provide an inviting atmosphere. Antique high-beamed ceilings and a majestic fireplace add grandeur to the living room. Five bedrooms and six bathrooms offer plenty of room for family and guests, while a spacious kitchen and gorgeous formal dining room are perfect for entertaining.\n\nMultiple terraces offer generous views of the Riviera, the Villefranche Bay and the impressive Cap Ferrat, plus the turrets and ramparts of the castle-like surrounding fortress. The rooftop deck has a jacuzzi. The landscaped grounds include lush gardens, mature trees, beautiful gardens, plus a pool surrounded by a stone grotto. The pool complex also has a detached studio.\n\nCôte d’Azur refers to the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea in southern France. One of the world’s first resort areas, it has long been a summer destination for Europe’s royalty, world celebrities, and artists, including Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. About half of the world’s super yachts visit the region every summer. With more than 310 days of sunshine a year, the 71 miles of coastline and beaches are home to 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.\n\nPrincess Margaret died in 1992.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Top 10 Real Estate Deals."
