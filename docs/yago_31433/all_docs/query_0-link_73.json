        "text": "Prince William met Kate Middleton in 2001, when they were both students at the University of St Andrews, in residence at the St Salvator's Hall. The two began seeing each other in 2003 and announced their engagement in October of 2010, after William proposed to Catherine in Kenya. The couple were married on April 29, 2011.\n\nUpon their engagement in 2017, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle confirmed that their relationship was \"definitely a set up.\" Harry revealed he and Meghan were introduced by a mutual friend, but the couple chose to protect their matchmaker's privacy. However, E! reported soon after, that their mutual friend, Violet von Westenholz, introduced the couple.\n\nViolet's father is a baron (Piers Von Westenholz) and a good friend of Prince Charles. She's \"been in Harry's trusted inner circle of friends for years,\" according to E!. Her younger sister, Victoria, was previously even considered one of the prince's potential girlfriends. Harry and Meghan met through a blind date in the summer of 2016, and got engaged in Botswana, and their wedding is planned for May 19, 2018.\n\nPrince Christian of Hanover first met Alessandra de Osma in 2005, when she was his tour guide during one of his visits to Peru–but they didn't start dating until years later. Their first appearance as a couple was in 2011, Hola reports. They were engaged in April 2017, according to PopSugar. This marked the second wedding for the couple; they first said \"I do\" in a civil ceremony in London in November 2017. The couple had their formal ceremony in Lima, on March 16, 2018.\n\nPrince Charles met Camilla (then Camilla Shand) in 1971 at a party; the couple were introduced by Charles' college girlfriend, Lucia Santa Cruz, the daughter of the former Chilean ambassador to London, reports PopSugar. While chatting at the party, Camilla reportedly made a joke about her and Charles' ancestral connections,\"My great-grandmother was the mistress of your great-great-grandfather. I feel we have something in common.\"\n\nThe two began dating almost immediately, and parted ways when Charles left for the Royal Navy. When he arrived home eight months afterward, Camilla was engaged to Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she married in 1973. Although Charles married Diana in 1981, he and Camilla were rumored to have carried on an affair throughout his relationship with Diana, which supposedly lead to the couple's divorce in 1995. After Diana's tragic death in 1997, Parker Bowles and Prince Charles continued their romance, and the two wed in 2005.\n\nPrince Carl Phillip met Sofia Hellqvist met at a luncheon thrown by mutual friends of theirs, and both speak about their first meeting as \"love at first sight,\" reports Hello!\n\n\"I don't think I knew the magic of love before I met Sofia,\" said Carl Phillip, \"But ever since I met her, I've seen how love can change a person.\"\n\n\"I completely agree,\" said Sofia. \"Carl Philip is definitely the right person for me. He's my best friend.\"\n\nMette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby met The Crown Prince Haakon of Norway during a party at the Quart Festival, Norway's largest music festival. The two later met again and started dating, and were married in 2001.\n\nPrior to becoming Norwegian royalty, Mette-Marit was a waitress and a single mother, reports Marie Claire, making this meeting a real life Cinderella story.\n\nAmerican supermodel Kendra Spears was introduced to her groom, the eldest son of the Aga Khan IV, at the age of 26. The two were introduced by none other than Naomi Campbell, and were dating for only four months before Rahim proposed. The couple were married in 2013, and have since welcomed a son.\n\nZara was introduced to rugby player Mike Tindall by her cousin, Prince Harry in 2003, when they were all in Sydney for the Rugby World Cup. Mike had been dropped from his team and was wallowing at a pub when Harry made the introduction, reports Popsugar. The two dated for eight years, and were married in 2011.\n\nWhen asked if she believes in Prince Charming during an interview leading up to this couple's 2012 wedding, Stephanie Lannoy remarked, \"Not only do I believe in it, I also think I found it. I remember the day I met Guillaume I told a friend–who by the way is going to be maid of honor at our wedding–I had found an exceptional man with whom I shared many things in common. I really did not think such a man could exist. So of course I believe in Prince Charming.\"\n\nThe South African Olympic swimmer met Prince Albert II of Monaco (the son of Grace Kelly) in 2000, when she was in Monaco for a competition. The couple dated for years and made their first public appearance in 2006, at the Olympic Games in Torino. The two wed on July 2, 2011.\n\nKing Felipe met Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano in 2002, when she was on assignment as a journalist for CNN, reporting on an oil slick on the shoreline of Galicia. Letizia was there to report on the disaster, while Felipe was there to visit those affected. The pair connected and were married in 2004; they now have two daughters together.\n\nPrince Abdullah II met Rania Al Yassin at a dinner party his sister was hosting. At the time, Rania worked for Apple in Amman. The two were engaged just two months later, and Abdullah II ascended the throne in 1999 and became the King of Jordan, just a month before the couple wed. Upon their nuptials, Rania became the Queen of Jordan.\n\nThe prince of Bhutan met Jetsun when she was 7 years old and he was 17, at a family picnic. According to reports, he told her that if they were both still single as adults that they would marry. He kept his promise; on October 13, 2011, the couple married in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.\n\nDiane Von Furstenberg, now fashion royalty, met Prince Egon von Fürstenberg at a birthday party in Geneva, when she was 18. The designer told Over the Moon, \"I wasn’t particularly interested at first. There were plenty of other young, good looking men around and he was still in school at Lausanne. But we ran in the same circles, and the more I got to know him, the more my feelings began to change. I’d say the turning point was on a ski trip we took to Megeve. The car got stuck in the snow and Egon rushed to get help. It turned out not to be a big deal, but I couldn’t help but be charmed by his helplessness and how he wanted to protect me. Before I knew it, I was very much in love."
