        "text": "Always a planner, the Queen of Denmark in 2003 commissioned an artist to construct an elaborate glass sarcophagus that she envisioned as the final resting place for herself and her husband.\n\nReflecting Margrethe's artistic sensibilities, the four-tonne tomb that rests upon silver elephants in Roskilde Cathedral took 20 years to complete.\n\nBut when the sarcophagus with room for two was almost finished, Prince Henrik announced his wife would be spending eternity alone.\n\n\"If she wants to bury me with her, she must make me a king consort,\" he told Danish magazine Se og Hør in 2017.\n\n\"Finished. I do not care.\"\n\nThe schism between the queen and her French-born consort was decades in the making.\n\nDespite falling \"madly in love\" when they met in London in 1965, having two sons together, and representing the hopes and dreams of Danes for a generation, the relationship was riddled with jealousy and resentment.\n\nThe girl who dreamed of being an artist was never meant to rule.\n\nBorn into a war-torn nation that constitutionally banned women from wearing the crown, Margrethe had an unlikely ascension to the throne.\n\nBut once she was there, the queen put her country before everything else — even her marriage.\n\n\"Denmark is more important to me than anything else. I do not think I have ever even flirted with the idea of putting my marriage before the throne,\" she told biographer Anne Wolden-Ræthinge.\n\n\"All over Denmark I had already been met with such great expectations and received so much kindness and respect.\n\n\"To turn my back on all this would be to fail everyone who depended on me.\"\n\nAfter five decades on the throne, Margrethe is now abdicating in favour of her son, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nThe 6-foot tall chain-smoking monarch is expected to dedicate her retirement to the things she loves most: languages, the arts and taking long walks around Copenhagen alone.\n\nDespite the personal sacrifices she made to wear the crown, Margrethe said she never once regretted her surprise role.\n\n\"It is not a life sentence, but a life of service,\" she told the BBC.\n\nBorn into a royal family who never expected her to rule\n\nThe arrival of Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid in April 1940 came with a somewhat subdued announcement.\n\nHer parents — Frederik, the eldest son of Denmark's King Christian X, and Ingrid, the only daughter of the crown prince of Sweden — had been under virtual house arrest inside the Amalienborg Palace since the invasion of Adolf Hitler's forces.\n\n\"Church bells were tolled throughout Copenhagen, but due to the present situation, no guns were fired,\" the British United Press remarked of the royal baby's arrival.\n\nThe cherubic little princess, known affectionately as Daisy, was not destined to rule her country.\n\nAccording to rules of succession set out in 1853, only male heirs were entitled to inherit the throne, and it was thought that the crown would be passed instead to her uncle.\n\nThe childhood of Margrethe and her two younger sisters Benedikte and Anne-Marie was spent playing, drawing and exploring the grounds of the royal palaces, where the eldest princess painted an undersea mural in one of the bathrooms.\n\nBut Frederik's ascension after World War II signalled a shift in the House of Glücksburg.\n\nThe father of three daughters began the complicated process of adapting Denmark's constitution to allow his progeny to rule — a change that would require approval from two successive parliaments and the Danish public.\n\nIn 1953, Danes voted in a referendum to make Margrethe the heir presumptive and future queen.\n\nIt would be almost two decades before that inevitability became a reality, but Margrethe has publicly recalled how her fate changed on that day.\n\n\"[Becoming queen] has been my purpose in life since the age of 13,\" she told Wolden-Ræthinge in 1989.\n\n\"I am, I am yours! My task now is my country, for my country, for my Danes.\"\n\nThe teenaged princess was a dedicated student, spending a year away at boarding school in England before graduating high school with exemplary marks and a flair for languages.\n\nAt 18, Margrethe was given a seat on the State Council, where she practised the intricacies of royal diplomacy and chaired meetings on her father's behalf.\n\nThe princess launched herself into every aspect of young royal life, training with the Danish Women's Flying Corps and jetsetting around the world with her Scandinavian cousins to rub shoulders with Hollywood stars.\n\nMargrethe's thirst for knowledge drew her to Cambridge University to study archaeology, a passion she'd discovered during childhood \"excavation holidays\" in Italy with her grandfather, the Swedish king.\n\nIt was this pursuit of prestigious education and travel that would lead Margrethe to her future husband.\n\nThe young royal meets her loyal consort and takes the throne\n\nIn 1965, a 25-year-old Margrethe was studying political science at the London School of Economics when she was invited to a dinner party.\n\nThere, she met Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who was working as the French embassy secretary.\n\n\"Apart from the fact that I found him very likeable, I did not really take much notice of Henri,\" she told her biographer.\n\n\"He was just a young man I met occasionally, and in fact, I believe it was he who noticed me, and not the other way round.\"\n\nThey were reunited several months later at a wedding in Scotland, and Margrethe said she then \"fell in love with a bang\".\n\nAfter dating in secret for a year, Henri proposed with a \"moi et toi\" ring — two enormous diamonds sitting side by side.\n\nTo marry a future queen, Henri was forced to make many sacrifices, which he claimed to be happy to do in the name of love.\n\nHe changed his name to Henrik to sound more Danish, he converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism, and he gave up his fledgling diplomatic career.\n\nThe couple had two sons: the heir to the throne, Frederik, in 1968, and the spare, Joachim, the following year.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, 1971, Margrethe's father King Frederik gave his annual address to the nation to wish his subjects well for the year ahead.\n\nJust two weeks later, he was dead.\n\nMargrethe ascended the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female monarch of Denmark since her namesake ruled the Scandinavian kingdoms in the 14th century.\n\n\"My beloved father, our king, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders,\" she said in her first speech.\n\n\"May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.\"\n\nAs queen and prince consort, Margrethe and Henrik immediately began to modernise the Danish monarchy.\n\nBoth artists and intellectuals, they opened up their court to Danes of all walks of life, travelling the country to get to know their subjects.\n\nMargrethe gave televised press conferences and travelled the world with her husband, meeting heads of state and politicians.\n\nKnown for her colourful and flamboyant fashion sense, Margrethe wanted to be a queen of Danish hearts as well as the arts.\n\nThe queen weaves a legacy beyond her royal duties\n\nWhile juggling her roles as a mother and reigning monarch, Margrethe also established a reputation as a talented artist.\n\nShe became captivated with JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings while reading it as a bedtime story to her two sons in the early 1970s.\n\nInspired by Tolkien's work, Margrethe painted a series of water colours depicting the landscapes of these imaginary worlds.\n\nShe sent another series of ink sketches to the author under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer, and they were eventually published in a new edition of Tolkien's epic story in 1977.\n\nMargrethe maintained this passion for the arts throughout her reign, dabbling in painting, textiles, decoupage, embroidery, costuming and set design.\n\nHer scenery and costume design has graced the stages of the Royal Danish Ballet and Copenhagen's Tivoli, while her paintings and embroideries have been exhibited in museums and churches across Europe.\n\nAccording to the Royal House, the queen still blocks out a day each week to dedicate to her crafts and regularly bestows her loved ones with her own creations, hand stitching evening bags for her friends, linens for the Christmas table and advent calendars for the grandchildren.\n\nFor many Danes, Queen Margrethe has been the mother to a nation.\n\nWhile she has long been a warm presence, always eager to chat to her subjects, she also had a no-nonsense manner and was not afraid to scold Danes for their bad behaviour.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed havoc across the globe in 2020, she lectured her subjects about the need to stay home.\n\n\"Sadly, not everyone is taking this seriously,\" she said in a grumpy televised address.\n\n\"Some are still hosting celebrations and birthday gatherings. This is not acceptable behaviour. It is thoughtless, and first and foremost inconsiderate.\"\n\nThis direct approach and her willingness to weigh in on controversial topics that her royal contemporaries largely avoided has been widely appreciated by her subjects.\n\n\"She isn't afraid of telling people off a bit. It only adds to her popularity and respect,\" Danish fashion designer Julie Brøgger told Vogue.\n\nNot all of Margrethe's quirks have been so fully embraced by the public.\n\nA chain-smoker since her late teens, the queen has often been publicly chided for encouraging her subjects to indulge in — or at least not to give up — the habit.\n\nIn 2001, medical journal The Lancet published an article by a Belgian professor who linked Margrethe's ascension to a slowdown in the decline of smoking-related deaths among Danish women.\n\n\"The queen is very popular in Denmark and a known cigarette smoker. As a role model for women, the queen's example could offer an explanation for the unusual mortality in Danish women,\" the author concluded.\n\nAt the time, Margrethe laughed off the criticism.\n\n\"I smoke wherever there's an ashtray,\" she told reporters, cigarette in hand.\n\nWhen Denmark's smoking laws were overhauled in 2006, the royal family announced the queen \"will now only smoke in private\", but she was frequently spotted puffing away on family walks through the countryside or strolls to the local market.\n\nShe reportedly kicked the lifelong habit once and for all after major back surgery last year.\n\nThe queen's husband earns nickname of 'world's grumpiest royal'\n\nAs many a noble in-law can attest, life on the fringes of the royal family is not always easy. For Henrik, the proximity to power was incredibly testing.\n\nThroughout his 50-year marriage the prince consort vented his frustrations in increasingly public fashion.\n\nHe had struggled to acclimatise to Danish culture and adopt the language, but more painful than jokes about his foreign accent was the underlying sense that he would always be an outsider.\n\nAs the years went on, he began to complain about his lack of freedom and status.\n\n\"The first hint came around his 50th birthday when he said on TV he found it difficult to ask his wife for pocket money for cigarettes,\" Henrik's biographer Stephanie Surrugue told The New York Times in 2017.\n\nWhile he saw himself as the queen's equal, he was never portrayed to the public as such.\n\nIn 2002, Margrethe asked her son, Crown Prince Frederik, to represent her at a ceremony on New Year's Day. Henrik took it as a personal insult.\n\nThe prince consort told the tabloids he felt degraded and humiliated having been \"relegated to third place in the royal hierarchy\", before storming off to France to \"reflect on his life\".\n\nThe abrupt departure sparked rumours of a royal divorce, but Henrik eventually returned after three weeks at his chateau.\n\nRoyal reporters recall this episode as one that somewhat charmed the Danish public, and for a while at least, the pair appeared to have set aside their differences.\n\nAt Margrethe's Ruby Jubilee in 2012, the queen toasted her husband for his support throughout her 40 years on the throne.\n\n\"Right from the first day I had my husband at my side,\" she said.\n\nBut Henrik never seemed to shake his hurt feelings about the title he felt he had earned in exchange for sacrificing his career and his home country.\n\nStyled in accordance with Danish royal tradition as prince consort, Henrik wished for his wife to call him her king.\n\nInstead, in her 2016 New Year's Day speech, Queen Margrethe announced that her husband was retiring from life as a public royal, and would henceforth \"throttle down\" his official engagements.\n\nHenrik's private frustrations continued to spill into the public in the subsequent years.\n\n\"My wife has decided that she would like to be queen, and I'm very pleased with that,\" he fumed in a particularly inflammatory interview with Se og Hør in 2017.\n\n\"But as a person, she must know that if a man and a woman are married, then they are equal.\n\n\"She's the one playing me for a fool.\"\n\nAfter half a century as Denmark's mother, Margrethe will rest alone\n\nIn 2017, when Henrik announced that he did not wish to be buried with Margrethe, the queen said she accepted his decision.\n\n\"It is no secret that the prince for many years has been unhappy with his role and the title he has been awarded in the Danish monarchy. This discontent has grown more and more in recent years,\" her communications chief, Lene Balleby, told the tabloid BT.\n\n\"For the prince, the decision not to buried beside the queen is the natural consequence of not having been treated equally to his spouse – by not having the title and role he has desired.\"\n\nA month later, Margrethe's office announced that her husband had been diagnosed with dementia.\n\nAnd on February 13, 2018, Henrik was moved to Fredensborg Palace, a lavish home on the shores of Lake Esrum, where the Danish court said he wished to spend the remainder of his life.\n\nHe died later that day, with his wife and sons by his side.\n\nHowever she truly felt about her husband's rejection of their burial plans, Margrethe honoured his request and had his body cremated.\n\nHalf of his ashes were scattered across Danish seas, while the rest were placed in a private part of the gardens at Fredensborg Palace.\n\nTheir relationship was as passionate as it was volatile, but the details of his funeral contained one last romantic gesture for his wife.\n\nRather than having the flowers placed in vases, they were spread on the floor of Christiansborg Palace Church in what courtiers described as a \"blooming garden\".\n\nThe arrangement was a nod to Henrik's wedding speech during which he declared: \"I came from a country of flowers into a blossoming garden … But the girl, however, was the garden's single most beautiful adornment.\"\n\nMargrethe has said that when her time comes, she still wishes to be buried in her glass sarcophagus.\n\nShe'll lie in her tomb in Roskilde Cathedral alone, but the Danish people, who she always put first, will be able to visit the woman they thought of as the mother of a nation."
