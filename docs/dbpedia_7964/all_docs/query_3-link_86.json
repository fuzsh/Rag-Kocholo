        "text": "Offering an accessible introduction to the study of film genres and genre films, this book examines the use of genre in cinema from its beginnings to the present day.\n\nThis book explains the various elements of genre, the importance of genre in popular culture, problems of definition, Hollywood and the studio system, ideology and genre, national cinema and genre, authorship and genre, and debates about representation. The book also provides an in-depth examination of four key genres: the Western, the horror film, the film musical, and the documentary film. Each chapter provides a historical overview of the genre and a summary of important critical debates, and concludes with a case study that builds on the historical and theoretical aspects already introduced and provides a model for subsequent analyses. Featured boxes throughout the text highlight specific cycles, filmmakers, and trends, and each chapter concludes with a list of suggestions for further reading.\n\nFilm Genre: The Basics is an invaluable resource for those new to studying film and for anyone interested in the history and ongoing significance of film genres and genre films.\n\n“Barry Keith Grant’s Film Genre: The Basics is smartly structured, encyclopedic in range, and compellingly written. A highly readable book from an established expert in the field, it is readily accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic as well as to those who have been immersed in it for years. . . Grant’s book is a substantial, even monumental one that will provide a genuine contribution to discourse on the topic.” William Luhr, Professor of English and Film, Saint Peter’s University, USA\n\n“Grant’s book provides an engaging, authoritative introduction to film genre through the interwoven contexts of Hollywood history, literary antecedents, international iterations, and key critical and theoretical issues at stake. This illuminating study explores a range of film genres from the earliest examples to those of the present day.” Cynthia Lucia, Professor of Media Studies, Rider University, USA"
