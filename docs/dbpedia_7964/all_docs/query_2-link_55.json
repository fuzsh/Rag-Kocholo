        "text": "The film industry, also known as the motion picture industry, consists of the technological and commercial institutions involved in the filmmaking. These institutions in filmmaking include production companies, studios, screenwriting, actors, crews, and film directors. Cinema of the United States, commonly referred to as Hollywood has dominated the film industry and has also had major effects on cinema worldwide. Hollywood is the primary source of most commercially successful movies in the world and currently generates hundreds of movies every year. Hollywood movies have a global appeal because of the use of English as a universal language. The Chinese market has bought into Hollywood despite the country’s censorship of most films. Due to the success and the quality movies it produces, some film industries around the world have adopted names inspired by Hollywood.\n\nBollywood\n\nBollywood is part of the larger Indian Film Industry based in Mumbai and produces the Hindi language based films. Bollywood, formally referred to as Hindi Cinema, is the largest film producer in India accounting for 45% of the net film revenue. Bollywood produced 252 films out of 1969 films in India in 2014. Bollywood has become part of the Indian's story by influencing the music film. With the sales of Hindi movies worldwide especially in the Asian countries, Middle East, Africa, and Europe, Bollywood continues to generate a lot of revenue. Hindi actors have also gained significantly through the improved income from sales of their movies.\n\nPollywood\n\nPollywood is a Punjabi Cinema industry in India and Pakistan which produces films in the Punjabi language. Pollywood has become synonymous with the Indian Punjab especially in the 21st century because of the quality and number of Punjabi film it produces. Punjabi cinema has grown from producing five movies in 1997 to producing over 100 films annually. Pollywood currently spends a lot of money and uses home-grown stars and Bollywood actors in its film production. The gross earnings for the film industry have also increased significantly with some movies bringing in more than $10 million.\n\nLollywood\n\nLollywood is a Pakistan-based film industry which borrowed its name from Hollywood. The film industry started in 1929 and since then the studio has continued to manage indigenous production while in competition with some of the major production centers in Mumbai and Kolkata. Lollywood is currently producing some of the most intriguing films in Pakistan including Waar, Na MaoomAfraad, and the system among other famous films.\n\nChhollywood\n\nChhollywood is a film industry in Chhattisgarh state in central India. Chhollywood produces films in Chhattisgarhi language. Chhattisgarh State was established on October 30, 2000, as a direct influence of the Chhollywood producing Satish Jain blockbuster movie. Currently, Chhollywood is capable of doing a complete film work and only sends it to Mumbai for censor certificate. The digitalization has helped the film industry to cut on the cost of production.\n\nConclusion\n\nHollywood has not only influenced film industries in Asia but also the world over. Most of the film industries have associated with Hollywood to promote and market their films both locally and abroad. The strategy has worked because of the quality films that met the audience’s expectations."
