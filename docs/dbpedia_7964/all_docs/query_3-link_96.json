        "text": "Film Genre Theory\n\nGenre Theory involves classifying a film into a category that contains other films that have similar aspects. These could be similar narratives, characters, filming techniques, or other formal features. The word genre comes from the French (and originally Latin) word for ‘kind’ or ‘class’ ”. There are a variety of ways, reasons why, and how to define genre. Some people may group by period, country , director, or purpose. While others assign genre by story content, literature, performance, budget based, racial identity, artistic status, etc (Chandler 2). By grouping these films together, it provides a structure by which they can be evaluated relative to each other and to the genre as a whole. This page will cover a few of the genres used in cinema today.\n\nThe War Film Genre\n\nThe War Genre of film is one where the narrative or primary plot of the movie is focused, or has in the background, a war that mankind has fought. This genre has undergone quite a transformation throughout its history in the way it portrays its characters and war in general. Starting with All Quiet On The Western Front (1930), a film based on a book written by a soldier during World War I, war was presented to its audience as something terrible and difficult for the human psyche to cope with. The genre as we know it today began to take shape though when World War II started. Studios in Hollywood moved away from focusing on the horrors of war and instead focused on the heroes of war. They accomplished this by casting big actors and focusing on American victories and triumph. For example, films like Flying Tigers (1942), Reunion In France (1942), The Fighting Seabees (1944), Back To Bataan (1945), & They Were Expendable (1945) were all made before the end of 1945 (the last year of World War II) and all starred John Wayne where he played a character that was a member of the US Military during the war. Many other prominent actors, like Wayne, acted in numerous films with World War II as their backdrop.\n\nThe post-WWII era saw a time when the war film was still popular and still portrayed in a similar way. The late 1940s through the 1960s featured such well known World War II films as Twelve O’Clock High (1949), Battleground (1949), Sands Of Iwo Jima (1949), Stalag 17 (1955), To Hell and Back (1955), The Enemy Below (1957), The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967), Where Eagles Dare (1968) & Patton (1970). These films continued to project the morally superior Allies narrative that was, in the late 1960s, over 20 years old. The culmination of this effort manifested itself in the 1962 epic war film, The Longest Day. Based on a cinematic retelling of the Allied invasion of Normandy, this three hour, $10 million black & white film featured the biggest names in acting from the United States, England, and Germany. Stephen Ambrose called it “…an epic spectacle of the turning point in the war in the West, The Longest Day remains one of Hollywood’s most remarkable logistical achievements.”¹\n\nIn the late 1960s however, the genre began to change how it was portrayed as the Vietnam War was beginning to takes its toll on the United States and Hollywood. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the genre had undergone a complete transformation. Directors began to portray the protagonists in their movies as individuals with mental/emotional issues, presumably due to their participation in combat. Memorable films like The Deer Hunter (1979), Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1987), & Full Metal Jacket (1987) bring the premise of the genre full circle back to All Quiet On The Western Front (1930) by focusing on the traumatic events and emotions that war brings with it.\n\nThe early 1990s became a dark age of sorts for the war film genre as Hollywood had abandoned them in favor of other genres like science fiction. The late 1990s though witnessed the best the genre had to offer yet as directors began to combine the self-avowed glory of the WWII and post-WWII films with the trauma of the post-Vietnam films. With CGI technology, special effects, and highly detailed and choreographed sets, directors took war films one step further by integrating a level of realism that film viewers had never experienced. This movement started with Spielberg’s epic retelling of D-Day in Saving Private Ryan (1998) and was followed by films like The Thin Red Line (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Tears Of The Sun (2003), Jarhead (2005), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), The Hurt Locker (2008), Act Of Valor (2012), & Lone Survivor (2014) bringing the film viewer to the present day depictions of the genre. ¹ Ambrose, Stephen E. “‘the Longest Day’ (1962): “blockbuster” History. (academy Award Winning War Film).” Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television. 14.4 (1994). Print.\n\nThe Science Fiction Film Genre\n\nScience fiction is such a large umbrella term. The text assigned for the class characterizes sci-fi as dealing “with adventures in outer space or intrusions from extraterrestrials” (Corrigan 93). This isn’t adequate though, even for a brief characterization of these types of films. Granted, there are these invasion-type movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still or Invasion of the Body Snatchers. There are also adventures in outer space like Star Wars or Star Trek. This doesn’t take into account other kinds of stories or conventions used.\n\nOther conventions that define the genre better are the use of speculative technologies that don’t exist in the real world or how a scientific discovery changes the way that societies carry out their lives. The narrative and the characters are secondary to the ideas that permeate the world they inhabit. Science fiction is a genre where ideas reign supreme.\n\nIt’s where current social trends can be taken to extremes like the social order that is shown in the film adaptations of The Time Machine or Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. Both of these stories cover the topic of how social class divide could become more extreme as time goes on. They are a commentary on the systems we have in place and how making them exaggerated leads to new insights into their structure. Judge Dredd, Robo-Cop, and Elysium are grittier, more on-the-street versions of this kind of film.\n\nFrom Elysium, where underground medical treatment is sought by the impoverished protagonist:\n\nIt’s a genre that is able to make ideological points about topics that otherwise may never be broached via allegory. This can be seen in movies like Enemy Mine or the aforementioned The Day the Earth Stood Still where xenophobia, or an initial distaste for those perceived as different, is something that ought to be curbed and checked, be it alien life forms, different cultures, or ethnicities. District 9 is a great example of this as well where the aliens sectioned off was a commentary on apartheid in South Africa.\n\nHere is Young Spock dealing with harassment due to having mixed heritage:\n\nIt’s where we can reflect on what effect technology has and where that technology may lead us. This can be seen in the multitude of robot and artificial intelligence films like A.I., Bicentennial Man, The Matrix Trilogy, I Robot, Her, Blade Runner, or Transcendence. Another film that does this is the original Gojira where the destruction of Japan, the anger of the infamous kaiju monster, and the new weapon of mass destruction dubbed “Water Destroyer” are all commentary on the effects of nuclear war in a post World War II era.\n\nIt’s a genre where a future can be considered that has the worst happen to the world and only post-apocalyptic nomads are left. Examples of this include The Road, Mad Max, or World War Z. It’s also where one can find immense hope in the world and how we can solve our problems with our own ingenuity. This can be seen in the utopian society of Star Trek or the sense of wonder and achievement of discovery in works like Primer and Europa Report.\n\nThere are many subgenres within science fiction as well. There is hard science fiction, which may be considered more highbrow, where the science takes center stage and the narrative is secondary. For example, the prequel Prometheus may fit into this category more so than Alien since the theory of the origins of life on Earth, Panspermia, has a more prominent role than any of the characters. Then there’s soft science fiction, where the characters are more important. Here, the scientific concepts are a convenient substitute for magic that is used to simply drive the plot forward or make it so that the world operates as the writer wishes. This includes space operas, like Star Wars or Star Trek, where the characters and plot drive the film but happen to do so on a galactic scale.\n\nThere are independent films like Pi or Primer, that still count as science fiction without much in the way of special effects, and there are bigger budget movies like Sharknado or Transformers where seemingly the only focus is on special effects.\n\nThere are other films that mix science fiction elements in but are not entirely science fiction. Films such as these include Cowboys vs. Aliens, where the western genre is mixed with science fiction, Cabin in the Woods, where the horror genre is combined with sci-fi, and Melancholia , which is more of a literary, psychological analysis that is set on the backdrop of the end of the world due to a massive meteor that can’t be stopped. There are even films that attempt to not only mix genre, but media. One notable example of this is Edge of Tomorrow, where the try-fail-try-again sense of a video game is well portrayed in film form.\n\nSummarily, science fiction is a very diverse classification of film. As discussed above, there is much variety. The main characteristic of the genre is the use of science to portray a world that is different than known reality in some way. That may be somewhat of a tautology that uses the definitions of the words ‘science’ and ‘fiction’, but it’s really the only common thread among all of the films described here.\n\nHere’s a trailer for a pretty cool and goofy science fiction flick from the ’80s:\n\nCorrigan, Timothy. A Short Guide to Writing about Film. New York: Longman, 2010. Print.\n\nAdventure Film Genre\n\nFilms including excitement, danger, traveling around the world, or to other worlds, overcoming challenges, with a main hero character are things that come to mind when thinking of the adventure film genre. These films have targeted the mainly male audience in the past with mainly men heroes, but in the modern era we find many strong female roles as well. “Under the category of adventure films, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles (similar to the epics film genre), searches or expeditions for lost continents, “jungle” and “desert” epics, treasure hunts and quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often set in a historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary adventure heroes (Robin Hood, Tarzan, and Zorro for example), kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy”. Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) , was an affectionate return and tribute to the early days of Saturday morning matinees and cinema, with comic-book archaeology hero Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) battling the Nazis while searching for the sacred Ark of the Covenant – the first in a very successful trilogy of films (Filmsite). The adventures the characters go on frequently take the viewer around the world to many different locations, and to many different types of challenges that the hero has to overcome. Some are mental, others physical in nature, but all challenge the hero to the edge of their character. A perfect example of this is in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in the 3 trials scene. Indy must have the agility and courage to get through the first obstacle and then the faith to cross the gorge, the wisdom to cross the stone floor, and finally the humility and wisdom to choose the right cup to save his fathers.\n\nBelow is the clip for the 3 trials:\n\nThe following clip is the famous scene that begins Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThis genre includes the evolution of Swashbuckler films as well. In the 30s, this is represented by films like The Count of Monte Cristo(1912, 1934 1974, and 2002). Next came the early pirate film, Sinbad, the Sailor (1947). Swashbucklers of the 50s included Spartacus (1960) and nowadays the most popular would be the Pirates of the Carribean film series. Johnny Depp plays, Captain Jack Sparrow, not your average pirate, in his quest for glory and a ship of his own. This is a funny scene with Jack Sparrow from the first movie, The Curse of the Black Pearl.\n\nFor Those Looking to improve your knowledge of film here is a list of some of the best films in the adventure genre throughout history.\n\nThe Boxing Film\n\nThe boxing film has been a significant genre in Hollywood, with more than 150 full length films since 1930. During the span of years between 1975 and 1985 the boxing film, Rocky had enormous success at the box office prompting 5 more films over the years. This film starring Sylvester Stallone was the rags to riches story, appealing to the American public as a direct representation of the American Dream. At about the same time Robert Dinero was releasing his critically esteemed film Raging Bull in 1980. “The fundamental problems or conflicts in the boxing film can be organized into four categories: body versus soul, opportunity versus difference; market values versus family values; and anger versus justice. These four related conflicts shape the more apparent conventions of plot, character, and setting” (Grindon 2) The themes of overcoming adversity against all odds and believing in oneself were very inspirational to millions of viewers. In all of the boxing films the main character experiences a roller coaster effect. They start out low work there way up and then get cocky and brought back down to Earth or they lose someone close to them which drives them to almost quit, and then they overcome the adversity to face there greatest challenge yet which is embodied in a lethal opponent. They give everything and face many close calls throughout the fight and then they reach deep and pull out the impossible or at least get close to doing so as Rocky does in the first chapter of the series.\n\nGrindon, Leger. “Body and Soul: The Structure of Meaning in the Boxing Film Genre.” Cinema Journal Summer 35.4 (1996): 54-69. JSTOR. Web. 2 Aug. 2014.\n\nHeres a great list from IMDB. The list had 190 titles, so I’m only including the top 25"
