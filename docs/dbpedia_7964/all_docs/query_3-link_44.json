        "text": "Film Genres. Tim Dirks, 1996-2002.http://www.filmsite.org/genres.html (Last accessed: 3 April 2002).\n\n\"Film Genres are categories, classifications or groups of films that have similar, familiar or instantly-recognizable patterns, techniques or conventions that include one or more of the following: setting, content, themes, plot, motifs, styles, structures, situations, characters (or characterizations), and stars. The main genres are the western, crime (gangster), horror, the musical, science fiction and comedy. Other genre categories include action/adventure, thrillers, epics (costume dramas), war movies, and the women's picture (melodrama). By the end of the silent era, many of the main genres were established: the melodrama, the western, the horror film, comedies, and action-adventure films (from swashbucklers to war movies). Musicals were inaugurated with the era of the Talkies, and the genre of science-fiction films wasn't generally popularized until the 1950s.\"\n\n√∏\n\n...Site includes Epic/Historical Films\n\nhttp://www.filmsite.org/epicsfilms.html [Last accessed 3 April 2002).\n\n\"Epics/Historical Films often take an historical or imagined event, mythic, legendary, or heroic figure, and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by grandeur and spectacle and a sweeping musical score. Epics, costume dramas, historical dramas, war film epics, medieval romps, or 'period pictures' are tales that often cover a large expanse of time set against a vast, panoramic backdrop. In an episodic manner, they follow the continuing adventures of the hero(s), who are presented in the context of great historical events of the past. Epics are historical films that have become expensive and lavish to produce, including elaborate and panoramic settings, on-location filming, authentic period costumes, inflated action on a massive scale and large casts of characters.\n\n\"Epics often rewrite history, suffering from inauthenticity, fictitious recreations, excessive religiosity, hard-to-follow details and characters, romantic dreamworlds, ostentatious vulgarity, political correctness, and leaden scripts. Accuracy is sometimes sacrificed: the chronology is telescoped or modified, and the political/historical forces take a back seat to the personalization of the story. Epics often share elements of the more elaborate adventure films genre. They may be combined with other genre themes, including epic westerns, epic science fiction, or epic dramas or war films for example.\n\n\"Epics are often called costume dramas, since they emphasize the trappings of a period setting: historical pageantry, costuming, locale, spectacle, decor and a sweeping visual style. They often transport viewers to other worlds: ancient times, biblical times, the Middle Ages, the Victorian era, or turn-of-the-century America. Unlike true historical epics, period films choose a specific historical period, and then superimpose fictional characters or events into the setting.\"\n\n...of related interest:\n\nWar and Anti-War Filmshttp://www.filmsite.org/warfilms.html\n\nBiographical (Biopic) Epics:\n\nhttp://www.filmsite.org/warfilms.html"
