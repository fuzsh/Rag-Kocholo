Buzz soon takes Woody’s place as Andy’s favorite toy and Woody becomes jealous.\n\nWoody decides he’s going to get rid of Buzz, but as the two toys begin to fight, they get lost. This story follows their adventure as they try to make their way back to Andy.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Animated movies like “Toy Story” are usually written for a younger audience, which means the story and vocabulary are not complicated. Even though the movie is mainly for kids, adults enjoy it a lot, too.\n\n2. Finding Nemo\n\nGenre: Family\n\nDescription: “Finding Nemo” is an animated film about a clownfish named Marlin who loses his son Nemo.\n\nOn the way, he meets another fish named Dory. Together, they set out on an exciting adventure to find Nemo across the ocean! I don’t want to reveal any spoilers, but it’s a great film to watch for all ages—one of the best movies of all time!\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: It’s very popular worldwide, and the storyline is easy to follow. Plus, the vocabulary isn’t complicated.\n\n3. Cast Away\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nDescription: Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks)—who travels around the world fixing problems at FedEx centers—has to go to Malaysia on business and is forced to leave his girlfriend Kelly behind on Christmas.\n\nAfter his plane hits a terrible storm and it crashes in the Pacific Ocean, he wakes up on an island with nothing with him except a volleyball.\n\nChuck names the ball Wilson and talks to him every day to fight his loneliness. The movie follows Chuck and Wilson as Chuck struggles to survive being stranded.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Most of the dialogue in this movie is a monologue (one person speaking), so it’s very easy to follow. The actor Tom Hanks is also known for his clear and slow voice, which is perfect for any English learner to understand.\n\n4. (500) Days of Summer\n\nGenre: Romantic Comedy\n\nDescription: This movie shows a young architect named Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meeting Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel).\n\nHe falls in love with her right away, and over the next few months, they spend a lot of time together, even though Summer tells him she doesn’t believe in love.\n\nDespite how much time they spend together, Summer doesn’t feel the same about Tom.\n\nA couple of years later, they meet again, and she explains that he was right about love and that she has met someone else.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: The English is very simple to understand, and it’s a narrative from one person’s perspective, so it’s easy to follow. It’s not your typical love story and catches the audience’s interest.\n\n5. Despicable Me 3\n\nGenre: Family / Comedy\n\nDescription: In the previous movies, Gru started as the world’s most evil supervillain (bad guy).

But, pretty soon, he is kicked out of the squad for failing to do his job.\n\nThen one day, he is visited by his mysterious twin brother, who now wants to become a villain and asks for Gru’s help.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Even though the main story is about Gru, the real stars of this movie are the three girls he adopted. The youngest sister’s lines are short but very funny, making her a good model for English learners who are just starting.\n\nIt may be best for beginners to focus on the three sisters and their speech, as most of the other characters have accents that are not standard for English.\n\n6. The Boss Baby\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nDescription: Tim Templeton is a seven-year-old child who gets all the love and attention from his perfect parents. But one day, he discovers that his parents have brought another baby to their house.\n\nOver time, Tim is ignored by his parents as the strange suit-and-tie-wearing baby takes away all their affection.\n\nThen, both brothers have to put aside their rivalry and join in fighting a common threat—puppies.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: The film is a unique mix of casual English and business language. As the baby is supposed to be a manager in a business corporation, he uses words like “closers” (people who finalize a business deal) and “power nap” (sleeping for a short time to energize yourself for work).\n\nAt the same time, Tim and the rest of the babies use basic English language.\n\n7. The Son of Bigfoot\n\nGenre: Fantasy\n\nDescription: Adam is a boy who lost his father when he was a baby and grew up to be a lonely teenager who has almost no friends in school.\n\nDespite being bullied, he pretends to be happy so his mother won’t worry about him.

You will also see how school authorities like principals use special words like “detention” and “suspended” to assert their power. There are scenes where many marketing words are used along with scientific terms, making this movie best for high-beginner to intermediate-level learners.\n\n8. The LEGO Batman Movie\n\nGenre: Action / Comedy\n\nDescription: In this film, Batman faces a challenge from Joker, his worst enemy.\n\nBatman discovers that he cannot stop the Joker alone and has to team up with others in Gotham City. He also discovers that he has accidentally adopted an orphan boy as his son.\n\nBatman always goes through the same kinds of problems, but this time it’s funny rather than serious. He is challenged by his loneliness, and he learns a lot about responsibility and relationships.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Most characters use casual English. But some characters, like Alfred, always speak with a formal, British accent. Learners who like comics a lot and are fans of superheroes will love this movie.

He’s famous for his natural dialogue and funny lines, which makes this movie really enjoyable to watch and easy to follow.\n\nYou’ll also be able to pick up a lot of great English vocabulary related to computers, technology and social networks.\n\n10.

This movie is packed with inappropriate humor and is not for kids, but it is really funny.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: It’s a comedy that relies a lot on its visuals, which makes it much easier to understand the dialogue between the characters.\n\nAll the characters use everyday English, making this movie an excellent way to learn modern American slang.

He suddenly discovers he’s very fast at running, which wins him a college scholarship (even though he’s not very smart).\n\nThat scholarship results in him living through all kinds of crazy experiences, from going to war to running across the country.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: This is a perfect movie to learn English, as the speech is slow due to Forrest Gump’s mental problems.

The characters use a lot of military vocabulary—like “no man’s land” (a piece of land unoccupied by any nation) or “snipers” (special soldiers who use a gun to kill people from a distance).\n\n25. Logan\n\nGenres: Action\n\nDescription: Wolverine, a powerful character from the X-men movies, discovers a girl, Laura, who is an incredible warrior.\n\nAfter her mother dies, Wolverine promises to protect Laura from a military group.

Since the pace of these conversations is often fast, this movie is best for advanced learners.\n\nApart from that, American culture, geography and accents are featured heavily in this movie. The characters talk about comic books, and there are scenes in public areas and various locations in the USA that are important conversation topics.\n\n26.

It also highlights the differences between some speech common in African-American communities and what is considered to be standard American English.\n\nOn a cultural level, “Get Out” deals with the issue of current racism in the US and the history of racism in the country.\n\n27. Split\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nDescription: Three teenage girls have been kidnapped and forcefully kept in cells by a criminal who has 23 different personalities.\n\nThe plot shows how the different personalities interact and how they can be manipulated by other people.\n\nUltimately, a hidden personality takes over the criminal’s mind, and everyone has to work together to stop him.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Since the same actor has to play the roles of 23 different people, learners can see how people of different genders and age groups might talk differently.\n\n28. Loving Vincent\n\nGenres: Drama\n\nDescription: Vincent van Gogh was one of the most influential painters of the 20th century.\n\nHe was deeply troubled in his life and had to go to mental asylums (hospitals for mental illnesses) many times.\n\nThis movie tries to capture the last days of his life through the eyes of Armand, the son of a postman who was close to Vincent. Before committing suicide, Vincent had given him a letter that had to be delivered to his brother Theo.\n\nThis is a hand-painted animated film that mimics the style of van Gogh’s paintings. The film has won many awards around the world and is truly one of a kind.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: Apart from its artistic brilliance, the film is perfect for showing the differences between some of the major English accents. Its vast cast of characters speaks in British, Scottish and Irish accents. Try to compare these accents with the standard American accents spoken in most other movies in this list.\n\nThis movie is also great for reviewing vocabulary for objects usually found in rural areas, such as “hay,” “barn” and “field.”\n\n29.

You’ll be able to have long conversations with your English-speaking friends about these movies and understand pop culture references to them.\n\nIt’s best for advanced learners looking for a challenge since you’ll have to distinguish between actual English words and words the movie has made up, like “Jedi.”\n\n30. Lord of the Rings\n\nGenre: Fantasy / Adventure\n\nDescription: “Lord of the Rings” is another one of the most outstanding film series in this magical category.\n\nSet in the lands of Middle Earth, there are three primary races—dwarves, humans and elves—with other races such as hobbits, orcs and werewolves.\n\nThe series follows the dark plot of a rebellion led by Sauron, the most horrible being across all the lands.\n\nTo oppose this evil, a small group of fighters take on a brave mission—to destroy a ring that is said to hold the powers of Sauron, and bring peace back to Middle Earth.\n\nWhy this movie is great for English learners: The movies are quite long, which means you’ll have enough content to study with for weeks (or maybe even months).\n\nNow that you have 30 English movies that you can watch to learn the language, what are you waiting for?\n\nGet some popcorn and start watching!\n\nAnd One More Thing...\n\nIf you like learning English through movies and online media, you should also check out FluentU.
