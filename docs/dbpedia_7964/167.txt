The American Film Showcase brings award-winning contemporary American documentaries, feature films and animated shorts to audiences around the world, offering a view of American society and culture as seen by independent filmmakers. Funded by a grant from the State Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, the Showcase highlights the value of film in fostering understanding and cooperation, dialogue and debate.

Through the American Film Showcase, U.S. Embassies in 40 countries organize film screenings, discussions and workshops in all areas related to film, such as production, writing, animation, distribution and independent financing.
