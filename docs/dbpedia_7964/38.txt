Every year, the Library of Congress and its National Film Registry select 25 films that showcase the depth and diversity of the American experience. These titles are added to an ever-growing list of films recommended for preservation based on their cultural, aesthetic and historical merits. People are invited to nominate recommended titles, and the final list is curated by the librarian of Congress.

Below are the titles in the registry connected to Latino culture, listed by year of release. Films range from Oscar-nominated productions to documentaries and home movies, in both English and Spanish.

“We have so many stories to tell,” says Mexican American filmmaker Gregory Nava, who has two films listed in the registry: El Norte (1983) and Selena (1997). “As Latino filmmakers, our mission is to bring the heart and soul of our culture to the audience, so that people can see who we really are.”

The complete list of films can be found on the National Film Registry’s website.
