Jamie Lee Curtis to Receive Honorary Doctorate From American Film Institute

American Film Institute (AFI), U.S. national arts organization dedicated to the preservation and advancement of the moving image as an art form. The AFI oversees an extensive operation that maintains archives and databases, trains young professionals in film and television production, and operates a state-of-the-art media laboratory.

Origin of the American Film Institute

In 1965 Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act that created the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), an independent federal agency charged with supporting the arts in the United States. In 1967 the NEA, with contributions from the Motion Picture Association of America and the Ford Foundation, established the American Film Institute as an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the heritage of film and television and increasing the recognition and understanding of the moving image as an art form. One of the AFI’s first projects was an effort to locate and preserve 250 rare and historically significant American films. Since then the AFI has served as a national resource for the many individuals and institutions actively involved in the art of the moving image.

The AFI directs many educational programs from its campus in the Hollywood hills overlooking Los Angeles. Founded in 1969 as the Center for Advanced Film and Television Studies, the AFI Conservatory is a graduate program that trains aspiring filmmakers in one of six disciplines: directing, producing, screenwriting, cinematography, editing, and production design. The Los Angeles campus also offers workshops for directors, screenwriters, and cinematographers. The Louis B. Mayer Library on campus houses the AFI Archive, which comprises rare and unique materials from across decades of cinema and television history.

Film preservation and the AFI Catalog of Feature Films

The AFI was at the forefront of late 20th-century efforts to preserve motion pictures. Under the aegis of the National Center for Film and Video Preservation (founded in 1984 with support from the NEA), it coordinated efforts to locate and acquire historically important films and television programs and then passed them on to the Library of Congress. The AFI also gathers, organizes, and makes accessible comprehensive documentation on America’s moving image heritage. Another initiative of the National Center for Film and Video Preservation was the research and publication of the AFI Catalog of Feature Films, a comprehensive decade-by-decade compilation of all feature-length motion pictures produced in the United States since the 1890s, which has evolved into an extraordinary online database of the same name.

The AFI Silver Theatre

The AFI sponsors many programs and events to increase public awareness of the art of the moving image. From 1973 to the early 2000s the AFI National Film Theater at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., served as a national cinema that offered many annual screenings, retrospectives, thematic series, and tributes. Since 2003 that function has been filled by the AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Centre in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland. The anchor of the facility is the restored Silver Theatre, a historic movie house built in 1938.

AFI festivals and awards

The AFI stages a number of significant film festivals. The most prominent of these is AFI Fest, which began in 1987 as the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival and is held annually in Los Angeles. The Silver Theatre hosts the AFI European Union Film Showcase and the AFI Latin American Film Festival.

To celebrate the creative evolution of this visual art form, the AFI annually presents the AFI Life Achievement Award to an individual whose talent has, in a fundamental way, advanced the art of filmmaking. The first recipient was director John Ford in 1973. Other recipients include Orson Welles (1975), Frank Capra (1982), Gregory Peck (1989), Sidney Poitier (1992), Steven Spielberg (1995), Martin Scorsese (1997), Tom Hanks (2002), Meryl Streep (2004), Mike Nichols (2010), Jane Fonda (2014), Denzel Washington (2019), and Julie Andrews (2022).

In 2000 the organization began presenting AFI Awards “to recognize the films and television programs which contribute to our collective cultural legacy.” Each year 10 films and 10 television programs are honored.
