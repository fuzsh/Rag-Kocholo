        "text": "In the opening scene, Mrs. Henderson, a wealthy Brit, leaves the funeral of her husband, shortly before World War II. Before the chauffeur drives her home she takes her rowboat out alone where we see and hear her crying out her grief in the distance. But the loss that affects subsequent plot appears to be the death of her son at the age of 21 in World War I. She visits his grave in a battle field cemetery in France twice during the film, and near the end of the film she delivers a monologue touching on the futility of his death to a group of soldiers ."
