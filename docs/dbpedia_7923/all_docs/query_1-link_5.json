        "text": "Based on the 2005 film of the same name that starred Judi Dench and the late Bob Hoskins, it was originally due to star Janie Dee, who has withdrawn for what are cited as \"personal reasons.\"\n\nBennett is reunited with director Terry Johnson, who also directed her in End of the Rainbow and La Cage Aux Folles. She received Olivier Awards for her performances in the musicals She Loves Me and Hairspray.\n\nThe musical, which has a score by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain and a book and direction by Terry Johnson, will also feature Emma Williams, Sarah Bakker, Katie Bernstein, Rhiannan Chesterman, Lizzy Connolly, Victoria Hay, Samuel Holmes, Lauren Hood and Matthew Malthouse.\n\nSet in 1937 London, the show revolves around recently widowed eccentric, Laura Henderson, who is looking for a way of spending her time and money, when her attention falls on a run-down former cinema in Great Windmill Street. Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo present a bill of non-stop variety acts. But as war looms, something more is required to boost morale and box office… When Mrs. Henderson comes up with the idea of The Windmill Girls – glamorous young women posing as nude statues – audiences flock."
