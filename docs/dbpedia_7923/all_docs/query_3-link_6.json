        "text": "Widely regarded as one of the greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, Toby Edward Heslewood Jones was born on September 7, 1966 in Hammersmith, London. His parents, Freddie Jones and Jennie Heslewood, are actors as well. Toby has two brothers: Rupert, a director, and Casper, a fellow actor. He studied Drama at the University of Manchester from 1986 to 1989, and at L'École Internationale de Théâtre in Paris under Jacques Lecoq in Paris from 1989 to 1991. Naturally, his career began on the stage (and continues there), but film and television roles came soon after his studies.\n\nToby made his film debut with a small role in Sally Potter's experimental take on Virginia Woolf's novel, Orlando (1992), starring Tilda Swinton. Other small film roles included the doorkeeper in Les Misérables (1998) and a memorable turn as the Royal Page in Auf immer und ewig (1998) with Drew Barrymore.\n\nRoles in the acclaimed Victoria & Albert (2001) and the Helen Mirren-starring Elizabeth I (2005) were balanced with film work, from his voice role as Dobby the House Elf in Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens (2002) to supporting appearances in Der Duft von Lavendel (2004) (co-starring his father, Freddie), Wenn Träume fliegen lernen (2004) and Lady Henderson präsentiert (2005).\n\nHe continued stage work during this period, appearing on Broadway in The Play What I Wrote in 2003, a year after winning the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the London production.\n\nKaltes Blut: Auf den Spuren von Truman Capote (2006), directed by Douglas McGrath and released in 2006, was Toby's first starring role. His acclaimed portrayal of Truman Capote remained mostly in the shadow of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance of the author in 2005's Capote (2005).\n\nA steady stream of film roles followed with appearances in Der Mann, der die Welt veränderte (2006), Der bunte Schleier (2006), Nightwatching - Das Rembrandt-Komplott (2007), Der Nebel (2007), and Die Girls von St. Trinian (2007). Toby then appeared in three successive films that could have been commercial breakthroughs: kid-lit flop City of Ember - Flucht aus der Dunkelheit (2008), the Oscar-nominated Frost/Nixon (2008), and Oliver Stone's W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008).\n\nHe reprised the voice-role of Dobby in Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010), appeared in the St. Trinian's sequel, as well as the Charles Darwin biopic Creation (2009) and Dustin Lance Black's post-Milk (2008) directorial outing, Virginia (2010). More Hollywood roles followed with appearances in The Rite - Das Ritual (2011), Your Highness - Schwerter, Joints und scharfe Bräute (2011), and his first big live-action breakthrough as Red Skull's biochemist Dr. Arnim Zola in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).\n\nEven before Toby was announced as Claudius Templesmith in the adaptation of the novel Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012), his star was on the rise after Captain America, with roles in three Oscar-nominated films: Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), My Week with Marilyn (2011), and Die Abenteuer von Tim und Struppi - Das Geheimnis der Einhorn (2011). Though chances are he will forever be known by many as Claudius, the announcer for The Hunger Games with the booming voice and penchant for ending his statements with the phrase, \"And may the odds be ever in your favor!\"\n\nToby followed up this massive success with his mesmerizing tour-de-force interpretations as a sensational multifarious \"chameleon\" of substantial acting mastery in films such as Red Lights (2012) for Buried - Lebend begraben (2010) director Rodrigo Cortés, Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Die Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire (2013) reprising his role as Claudius Templesmith, Peter Strickland's Berberian Sound Studio (2012), Susanne Bier's Serena (2014) and Journey's End (2017). Among others, The Girl (2012), a BBC/HBO co-production in which he starred as Alfred Hitchcock, Titanic (2012), The Secret Agent (2016), Wayward Pines (2015), Zeugin der Anklage (2016) and Sherlock (2010) are also included in the brilliant performances of his exquisite TV work.\n\nToby lives in London with his family.\n\nEnglish film actor, director and author Andy Serkis is known for his performance capture roles comprising motion capture acting, animation and voice work for such computer-generated characters as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001-2003) and Der Hobbit: Eine unerwartete Reise (2012), the eponymous King Kong in the 2005 film, Caesar in Planet der Affen: Prevolution (2011) and Planet der Affen: Revolution (2014), Captain Haddock / Sir Francis Haddock in Steven Spielberg's Die Abenteuer von Tim und Struppi - Das Geheimnis der Einhorn (2011) and Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars - Episode VII: Das Erwachen der Macht (2015). Serkis earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film Die Moormörderin von Manchester (2006), and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll (2010). In 2015, he had a small role in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Serkis has his own motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium Studios in London, which he will use for his directorial debut, Mogli: Legende des Dschungels (2018).\n\nAndrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was Serkissian, was a medical doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent time around the Middle East, and for the first ten years of his life, Andy traveled between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes. He attended St. Benedict's School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe's play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life.\n\nInstead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in Der Herr der Ringe: Die Rückkehr des Königs (2003), which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team's effort around Serkis's work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis's work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production.\n\nSerkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum's physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he'd go the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in King Kong (2005), which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture.\n\nApart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 30 über Nacht (2004), and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), among other film performances. On television, he starred as 'Vincent Van Gogh' in the sixth episode of Simon Schama's Power of Art (2006), the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Tintenherz (2008). At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007), a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project.\n\nAndy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne, and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (born on 19 June 2004), who is now also a movie star. Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is a pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London. Andy Serkis lives with his family in North London, England.\n\nPeter Dinklage is an American actor. Since his breakout role in Station Agent (2003), he has appeared in numerous films and theatre plays. Since 2011, Dinklage has portrayed Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011). For this he won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2011.\n\nPeter Hayden Dinklage was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Diane (Hayden), an elementary school teacher, and John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman. He is of German, Irish, and English descent. In 1991, he received a degree in drama from Bennington College and began his career. His exquisite theatre work that expresses brilliantly the unique range of his acting qualities, includes remarkable performances full of profoundness, charisma, intelligence, sensation and insights in plays such as \"The Killing Act,\" \"Imperfect Love,\" Ivan Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\" as well as the title roles in William Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" and in Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya.\"\n\nPeter Dinklage received acclaim for his first film, Living in Oblivion - Total abgedreht (1995), where he played an actor frustrated with the limited and caricatured roles offered to actors who have dwarfism. In 2003, he starred in Station Agent (2003), written and directed by Tom McCarthy. The movie received critical praise as well as Peter Dinklage's work including nominations such as for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the \"Screen Actors Guild\" and Best Male Lead at the \"Film Independent Spirit Awards.\" One of his next roles has been the one of Miles Finch, an acclaimed children's book author, in Buddy - Der Weihnachtself (2003). Find Me Guilty - Der Mafiaprozess (2006), the original English Sterben für Anfänger (2007), its American remake Sterben will gelernt sein (2010), Penelope (2006), Die Chroniken von Narnia - Prinz Kaspian von Narnia (2008) and X-Men: Zukunft ist Vergangenheit (2014) are also included in his brilliant work concerning feature films.\n\nHis fine work in television also includes shows such as Entourage (2004), Life as We Know It (2004), Nemesis: Der Angriff (2005) and Nip/Tuck: Schönheit hat ihren Preis (2003). In 2011, the primary role of Tyrion Lannister, a man of sharp wit and bright spirit, in Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011), was incarnated with unique greatness in Dinklage's unparalleled performance. The series is an adaptation of author George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and his work has received widespread praise, also highlighted by his receiving of the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at The 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards (2011), The 67th Primetime Emmy Awards (2015), The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards (2018) and The 71st Primetime Emmy Awards (2019) as well as of the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at [error].\n\nDinklage, among others, has also voiced Captain Gutt in Ice Age 4 - Voll verschoben (2012) and The Mighty Eagle in Angry Birds - Der Film (2016), starred in the comedy horror film Knights Of Badassdom (2013) while his tour-de-force interpretations as a multifarious \"chameleon\" of substantial mastery and artistic generosity also include film and TV gems such as Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), Three Christs (2017) and I Think We're Alone Now (2018).\n\nTimothy Leonard Spall is an award-winning classical character actor who was born on February 27, 1957, and raised in London. The son of blue-collar parents, Joseph L. Spall, a postal worker, and Sylvia R. (Leonard), a hairdresser, his interest in acting happened early and Spall auditioned and earned a spot with the National Youth Theatre.\n\nThe young actor showed great promise at RADA where he portrayed the title roles in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\" In 1979 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and stayed for approximately two years performing in such plays as \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" \"Cymbeline,\" \"The Three Sisters,\" \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle.\" With other rep companies, he appeared in, among others, \"The Merchant\" and \"St. Joan.\"\n\nMaking his minor debut in a filmed version of the play The Life Story of Baal (1978), Tim went on to play featured roles in offbeat films such as Quadrophenia (1979), Remembrance (1982), Der Missionar (1982), Die Braut (1985), Body Contact (1987), Robinson Crusoe - Reise ins Abenteuer (1988), Der Priestermord (1988), Dream Demon - Traumdämon (1988) and 1871 (1990)\n\nIn the 1990's, Timothy surged forward largely through his association with prolific writer/director Mike Leigh, appearing in a number of his award-winning, working-class features. Those included his doomed chef Aubrey in Das Leben ist süß (1990); brother/uncle Maurice in Lügen und Geheimnisse (1996) (BAFTA Award nomination); the vulnerable performer Richard Temple in the Gilbert & Sullivan biopic Topsy-Turvy - Auf den Kopf gestellt (1999) (another BAFTA nomination); and the benign taxi driver Phil in All or Nothing (2002). He also worked for other noted directors including Ken Russell in Gothic (1986), Clint Eastwood in Weißer Jäger, schwarzes Herz (1990), Bernardo Bertolucci in Himmel über der Wüste (1990), and Kenneth Branagh in Hamlet (1996) (as Rosenkrantz).\n\nTim impressed on the small screen as well during this time, accentuated by his starring work on series TV as the luckless Frank Stubbs Promotes (1993) as well as the comedies Nice Day at the Office (1994) and Outside Edge (1994), and his BAFTA-nominated TV roles in Our Mutual Friend (1998), Shooting the Past (1999) and Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise (2001).\n\nA battle with myeloid leukemia sharply curtailed Tim's momentum for a time, but he returned healthy into the millennium in superb lead and support form to create arguably his most hissable cinematic character. As the cowardly, half-blooded wizard Peter Pettigrew, Tim inhabited the role in several of the nine \"Harry Potter\" blockbusters from Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban (2004) to Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011). He also earned superb notices as: one of the charitable Cheeryble brothers in Nicholas Nickleby (2002); gullible banker Mr. Poe in the wild Jim Carrey adventure comedy Lemony Snicket - Rätselhafte Ereignisse (2004); humorous Simon Graham in the Tom Cruise starrer Last Samurai (2003); evil queen henchman Nathaniel in the delightful Disney film Verwünscht (2007); the villainous Beadle in the dark musical Sweeney Todd: Der teuflische Barbier aus der Fleet Street (2007); the over-anxious lawyer starring role in the family dramedy Reuniting the Rubins (2010); Sir Winston Churchill in The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010); werewolf hunter Sid in the horror comedy Love Bite - Nichts ist safer als Sex (2012); eccentric painter J.M.W. Turner portrait in Mike Leigh's Mr. Turner - Meister des Lichts (2014) (Cannes, London Critics Circle, New York Critics Circle and National Society of Film Critics winner); the co-lead with Juno Temple in the social drama Away (2016); legal combatant David Irving in the Holocaust-themed Verleugnung (2016); part of an upper-class couple (opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in the dark social comedy The Party (2017); a syndicated boss in The Corrupted - Ein blutiges Erbe (2019); and as artist L.S. Lowry opposite Vanessa Redgrave playing his mother in the biopic Mrs Lowry & Son (2019).\n\nTim's more recent notable TV outings have included his Fagin in the mini-series version of the Dickens classic Oliver Twist (2007), the title role in the TV-movie The Fattest Man in Britain (2009), and as Eddie in the series The Street (2006), Lord Blandings in the comedy Blandings (2013) and Lord Wallington in the dramatic mini-series Summer of Rockets (2019).\n\nThe father of three children, one of his children, Rafe Spall, is a prolific actor in his own right.\n\nJohn Mark Galecki was born in Bree, Belgium, to American parents; his father was stationed there while serving in the U.S. Air Force. When he was three years old, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he grew up with his parents, Mary Lou and Richard Galecki, and siblings, sister Allison (1980) and brother Nick (1982). His father was of Polish descent, and his mother's ancestry is Irish and Italian. His mother was a mortgage consultant and his father became a teacher for blind veterans in a VA hospital outside of Chicago. When Galecki was sixteen, his father died in an accident.\n\nHis mother recalled in an interview with People magazine that Galecki was a very artistic kid; at only 4 years old, he told her: \"Mom, I'm gonna be on T.V., and I don't mean when I grow up.\" Two years later, when their attempts to distract him with sports failed, Galecki's parents took him to open auditions at local theaters in Chicago. He landed his first role in \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" and more parts in other productions followed. By age 11, he was already known as an excellent actor in Chicago's theater scene evidenced by him receiving a Joseph Jefferson Citation nomination for portraying John Henry in \"The Member of the Wedding.\"\n\nIn 1989 he was cast in his first movie, a holiday film called Jessica und das Rentier (1989), but his big break was in another Christmas movie as Chevy Chase's son Rusty Griswold, in Schöne Bescherung (1989). On the set, Chase took a liking to him, and Galecki recalled in a later interview that Chevy Chase showed him some tricks for comedic timing.\n\nBy that time, his whole family had moved from Chicago to L.A. to support his career. But within 10 months they realized they missed Chicago too much, and moved back home. Galecki, still just 14, was under contract on a show with Robert Urich called \"Mann der Träume (1990)\", so he stayed in L.A. Although he was living alone in a studio apartment, he never got into trouble and was a good kid. He recalled living alone in L.A. without adult supervision as \"not fun\" and \"quite intimidating and lonely, to be honest. But I've always been happiest when I'm working, so...\" He bought a motorcycle with a mirrored helmet so he could get to work and back, at Paramount studios.\n\nIn 1991 Galecki was picked by Roseanne Barr to play her son in the made for T.V. movie Die Mütter-Mannschaft (1991). She liked him so much she asked him to come on her sitcom for what started as a one-off appearance, but soon turned into the important recurring role of David Healy. His family was religious viewers of the show and he was somewhat intimidated at first to be working with his television heroes. However, before long, it was his heroes that praised him: Roseanne said he showed \"great vulnerability.\" John Goodman said: \"If he was one of those little stuffed bears at a carny, he'd have a Wuv me t-shirt on. People just want to take care of him.\" Galecki also became very close friends with co-star Sara Gilbert and the show's executive producer Eric Gilliland.\n\nAfter Roseanne (1988) he worked on a number of diverse roles, from funny Ira alongside Christopher Walken in the 1997 dark-comedy Suicide Kings (1997) to a drug-addicted student in 2003's Bookies (2003), and he played gay characters in Don Roos's Bounce - Eine Chance für die Liebe (2000) and The Opposite of Sex - Das Gegenteil von Sex (1998). He never stayed far from the television industry as he made guest appearances such as Laurie Freeman's younger lover in Norm (1999) (where he once again worked with Laurie Metcalf, his former Roseanne cast mate), as a golfer in My Name Is Earl (2005), as Hope & Faith (2003)'s younger brother in the sitcom of the same name, and as hilarious party-boy Trouty on My Boys (2006). In 2006 he returned to his theater roots as he took on the role of conflicted but sweet male escort Alex in Douglas Carter Beane's play \"The Little Dog Laughed,\" for which he received a 2007 Theatre World Award for Outstanding Browdway Debut.\n\nIn 2007 he was back on the small screens, starring as Leonard Hofstadter in the sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007). Not only was Chuck Lorre, a former producer for Roseanne, a producer of the new show, but Sara Gilbert and Laurie Metcalf both made guest appearances.\n\nGalecki is a self-admitted motorcycle \"nerd,\" and rides a Harley Davidson Softail Deluxe. Although he never went to college, he has said: \"I'm not dead! We should never stop learning. We should never stop absorbing,\" and so he learned how to play the cello in his early twenties. He likes traveling around the world, painting, music (he also plays bass), and hiking with his dog Vera.\n\nHe always has been very private about his personal life and little is known about past relationships. It has only been confirmed that he dated actresses Laura Harris and Kaley Cuoco. He isn't on twitter, and Galecki once said, \"I don't understand the current frame of mind in our society that seems to say that any action is not of value until it's broadcast somehow.\"\n\nHe still lives in Los Angeles but is often spotted in Chicago, where his siblings still live."
