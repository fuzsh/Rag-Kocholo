        "text": "ROCKLAND — The Strand Theatre will present a free Member Appreciation screening of Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005), starring Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, on Monday, Aug. 19, at 5:30 p.m. Free popcorn and fountain drinks will be offered. Current Strand Theatre Members, as well as those who become Members prior to the screening, are invited to attend. Memberships may also be purchased in the lobby immediately prior to the show.\n\nWith some money in her pocket after the death of her husband, Mrs. Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) buys a theater and hires the irascible theater manager Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run the business, despite bad blood between the two. Henderson has a hit on her hands when she decides to add beautiful nude women to the stage shows at her Windmill Theatre. Though they are touched by tragedy, Henderson and her company bravely keep the theater active during the 1940-41 Blitz of London.\n\nThe film is rated R.\n\nNo regular-admission tickets will be available for this show. For more information about the Strand’s Membership program, visit RocklandStrand.com, call 207-701-5053, or email anne@rocklandstrand.com.\n\nThe Strand Theatre, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, became a nonprofit in January 2014 and is now operated by Friends of the Strand Theatre. Memberships, as well as donations, grants, and sponsorships help pay the operating expenses for the wide range of cultural and educational programming the theater offers to the community.\n\nThe Strand Theatre is located at 345 Main Street, Rockland."
