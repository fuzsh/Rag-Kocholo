        "text": "With the recent influx of Broadway transfers pouring into the West End, one after another, great British made musicals may seem few and far between. Whilst The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 3/4 may have bucked the trend this summer, I can’t be the only one who wishes for more. So this week, I’m throwing it back to a great British made musical which definitely deserved more then it’s limited run back in 2016.\n\nBased on the 2005 film of the same title, Mrs. Henderson Presents tells the true-life story of Laura Henderson and how she changed the fortunes of her struggling Windmill Theatre by controversially introducing nude chorus girls to her show, Revudeville. The film’s cast included Judi Dench, Bob Hoskins, and Will Young. With its truly British feel stemming from the characters ‘we can do it’ determination to keep going as the second world war begins, some heartfelt romantic and tragic moments, characters you could really feel for and some incredible music from Geoge Fenton and Simon Chamberlain, Mrs Henderson was a wonderful gem of a musical.\n\nThe show originally opened in Bath in 2015, before transferring to London’s Noel Coward Theatre in February the following year, where it enjoyed a limited run. The cast included Tracie Bennet as Laura Henderson, Ian Bartholomew as Vivian Van Dam, Emma Williams as Maureen and Samuel Holmes as Bertie.\n\n(Interesting Fact: The cast also included Sam O’Rourke, who would later that same year join Williams and Bartholomew once more to return to The Noel Coward with Half A Sixpence)\n\nMy Top Five Numbers\n\n5. The Lord Chamberlains Song\n\nThis hugely comical number takes place as Mrs Henderson tries to get permission from the Lord Chamberlain to put nude girls on stage. Every show had to have permission to run before any performances could take place in those days. Here the lord Chamberlain (played by Robert Hands, who can now be seen playing Nick in Come From Away) struggles to accept the idea as all he wants is for theatre to stay pure and clean, but Laura Henderson is a very convincing lady and certainly will not take no as an answer.\n\n4. Rubens and Renoirs\n\nDetermined to convince his chorus girls to appear on stage on the nude, Revudeville producer Vivian Van Dam takes the girls to an art museum to see the work of the greats, those who celebrated the female form in their paintings. As the girls would have to stay still on stage to meet the Chamberlains rules, Vivian tells them that they would be real-life paintings, goddesses in their own rights, respected and worshipped from the circle and stalls.\n\n3. Living In A Dream World\n\nPerformed by Ian Bartholomew in the role of Vivian Van Dam, this beautiful and heartbreaking ballad acts as a true reality check. Inside the Windmill theatre, it was almost as if they tried to pretend that the war was not happening, but this character has to face the truth. He knows that people want to bury their heads and worry only about their own little problems but you have to open your eyes and look at the bigger issues sometimes.\n\n2. Mrs Henderson Presents\n\nThe second song in the show and one that really gives you a taste of what the characters are about. We see people running in and out of the theatre to audition for a part in the show and builders scurrying around to get the theatre refurbished on time. Vivian Van Dam is the voice of wisdom to Laura’s lack of theatrical knowledge as she delights over the auditionees and Bertie as he brings the professional touch.\n\nIf Mountains Were Easy to Climb / Innocent Soldier\n\nOkay, I couldn’t decide between these two for the top spot as they are both beautiful for different reasons. If Mountains Were Easy to Climb is performed near the end of the show by Emma Williams in the role of Maureen. This character goes through a lot in the show, moving from ‘tea girl’ to a leading lady, with a fair amount of personal troubles also. This song shows her at her lowest as she vows to go on. The Windmill has given her a home, and a determination. She states that life wouldn’t be worth doing if it was easy, we are destined to be challenged and to win over difficulties.\n\nInnocent soldier is performed by Maureen and her fellow windmill girls as they reflect on the war and what it has done to the world they thought that they understood. They mourn the loss of the soldiers who were told that it was right to fight, those who left and never came back. This song is as beautiful as it is heartbreaking and I feel that it is an important moment in the show, taking the girls out of the theatre and into the harshness of reality."
