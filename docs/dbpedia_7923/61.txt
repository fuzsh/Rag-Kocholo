Director: Stephen Frears

Writers: David Rose (idea), Kathy Rose (idea)

A filthy rich London widower of social means (Judi Dench), buys a rundown old stage theater in London and reopens it with the help of a brilliant but demanding theater producer (Bob Hoskins). After initial success they run into financial difficulty, so during WWII they open an all nude girl review show. CR

Yes, Mrs Henderson Presents is based on a true story! I was surprised that there had been a full nude showgirl stage show back in the early 1940s. But it happened for real at the Windmill Theater.

It's a good movie as it functions as a spicy behind-the-scenes look at how a stage theater is run. In that way it reminded me of The Chorus Line, and that's where the similarities end. We do get to see some of the musical revue numbers performed, complete with nude beauties in the background. The undressed women were not allowed to move, at all, that was the law. They got away with being nude in a very clever way...you'll just have to see the movie to find out how they did it.

The only thing I found shocking is Bob Hoskins in a full nude shot, ugh! I did not need to see that! Though to be fair it was brief and for comic relief. And the movie does have it's funny moments but the comedy is of the intelligent from circumstance type, not slipping on bananas kind.

Judy Dench, Bob Hoskins and Christopher Guest were all spot on and dressed to the nines to boot. But it's the lovely ladies and the splashy shows they put on that's the real eye catcher.
