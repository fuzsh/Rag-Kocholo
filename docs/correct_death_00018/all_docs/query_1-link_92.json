        "text": "Near the end of his fourth term in office, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau went for his famous walk in the snow on Feb. 28, 1984 and announced the next day he would not run again. The city had a blizzard that day but whether he actually went for a walk might be questioned. It seemed to be a rhetorical device he often employed.\n\nIn his memoirs, Trudeau said he decided to run for the Liberal leadership in 1968 following Lester Pearson’s resignation after going for a walk in the snow during which he “agonized over whether to stand for the leadership of the Liberal Party.” He said his final decision to retire was easier.\n\nAsked by reporters why he would not run again, Trudeau responded: “I had a good day yesterday … and it seemed like a good day to have a last day.” In fact, he would serve four more months.\n\nHis most difficult political decision may have been in 1979, after announcing his resignation as party leader on Nov. 29, nearly six months after Joe Clark’s Tories beat his Liberals. The Clark ministry was likely to be short-lived and Trudeau seemed ready to pass the reins to another Liberal so they could be in place in time for the next federal election.\n\nHowever, Clark’s time in office was shorter than expected (273 days) and there was pressure on Trudeau to stay.\n\nJohn English reports in Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, that on Dec. 16, the Liberal leader went for “a walk to think about his future” during which he “trod the empty, snow-covered streets of Ottawa.”\n\nGoing for a walk in the snow was clearly a trope that Trudeau liked to use. (He also said he went for a walk along the beach in Toronto in November when he decided to announce he would not stay on as leader before reversing himself the next month.)\n\nStephen Clarkson and Christina McCall wrote in the second volume of Trudeau and Our Times that the Liberal leader decided to delay his leave from politics when he “came to realize that history would judge (him) as disappointing.”\n\nTrudeau maintained that he stayed on as leader because he was convinced that his leadership was necessary to defeat the growing threat of separation in Quebec. Clarkson and McCall said his advisers convinced Trudeau that only he could beat the Progressive Conservatives and then confront René Lévesque’s Parti Québécois. (There is a reason they subtitled their second volume, The Heroic Delusion.)\n\nThere was also the sense, as George Radwanksi said in his 1978 biography, that Trudeau’s prime ministerial legacy was “unfulfilled.” By most accounts, Trudeau was not convinced that he had left his mark on Canada and needed another term.\n\nThat should seem ludicrous. He was the fourth-longest serving prime minister at 11 years and 45 days, when he lost in 1979 and passed legislation that went far in achieving what he considered a Just Society.\n\nDuring his time in office he entrenched and expanded the welfare state that began with his predecessor Lester Pearson, increased immigration, liberalized laws on abortion, contraception, and homosexuality, banned capital punishment, and implemented official bilingualism and multiculturalism policies.\n\nIt is difficult to think of another prime minister with a larger or longer lasting legacy. But it wasn’t enough.\n\nTrudeau won his fourth mandate and second majority in February 1980 and resolved to focus on a handful of issues and “govern in this term as though it would be my last.” He focused on five issues: international peace, energy, the economy, the Constitution, and fighting the Quebec sovereignty referendum.\n\nIn May, the sovereignty side lost with just 40 per cent of the vote in Quebec. Coming out of that fight with a victory, Trudeau turned to repatriating the Constitution and imposing the National Energy Program, which exacerbated regional tensions.\n\nTrudeau would get a new “made-in-Canada” Constitution with its Charter of Rights and Freedoms on his second try. In 1971, he failed to get the Victoria Charter amendments to the 1867 Constitution ratified when Quebec opposed it. In April 1982 the new Constitution Act was proclaimed, without Quebec’s approval.\n\nThree of his major goals were achieved halfway through the mandate.\n\nNew finance minister Allan MacEachen’s budgets failed to put Canada’s fiscal house in order and Trudeau’s peace initiative to end the Cold War went nowhere. But overall he considered the term as success.\n\nDespite flirting with running again, Trudeau’s walk in the snow in 1984 led him to the conclusion that, “I had done what I had come into politics to do.” After 15 years and 164 days in office over four non-successive ministries, he profoundly changed Canada and had finally created what he considered “a just society.”\n\nPaul Tuns is the author of Jean Chrétien: A Legacy of Scandal."
