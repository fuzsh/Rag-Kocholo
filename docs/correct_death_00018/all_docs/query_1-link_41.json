        "text": "Pierre Trudeau, the flamboyant politician who led Canada for more than 15 years in which he shocked, thrilled and inspired his nation, died yesterday, aged 80, from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer.\n\nCanada was yesterday preparing for a state funeral and a lengthy period of mourning for Trudeau, who was recently voted the most important Canadian of the 20th century.\n\nTrudeau was the country's prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and, after a nine-month interlude, from 1980 to 1984. His relaxed style, his habit of speaking his mind and his marriage to a woman 29 years his junior all contributed to \"Trudeaumania\" at home, and global celebrity.\n\nHis death was announced by Roy Heenan, a partner in his Montreal law firm. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interrupted regular viewing to broadcast a special programme about Trudeau's life.\n\nTrudeau was a French Canadian who changed his country from a monocultural English-dominated state to a bilingual and more tolerant place. In so doing, he defused a growing Quebec separatist movement.\n\nHe became unpopular in western Canada for his insistence on holding down prices that the region could charge the rest of the country for oil and national gas. At one point, when confronted by a crowd of hecklers who barracked him on the subject, he famously raised his middle finger at them in an insouciant salute.\n\nOutside Canada he will probably be best remembered for his easy going celebrity, his acerbic sense of humour and his wedding at 51 to the 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair. The marriage soon turned sour, as she cuckolded Trudeau, once disappearing after a Rolling Stones concert to become a temporary groupie.\n\nEven in his twilight years, he was irrepressible. At 71 he was named on a birth certificate as father of a girl born to Deborah Coyne, 36, a Liberal party constitutional expert.\n\nTrudeau's friends said he never fully recovered from the death of his third son, Michel, who was swept into a lake by an avalanche in 1998 while on a ski trip in British Columbia. Trudeau brought instant sex appeal to a staid political culture, driving around Ottawa in a convertible car, and dating a string of beautiful women.\n\nHe also led the drive to distance Canada from British apron strings, enshrining a Charter of Rights in a new constitution in 1982. In a supreme act of irreverence, he once turned a balletic pirouette behind the Queen's back."
