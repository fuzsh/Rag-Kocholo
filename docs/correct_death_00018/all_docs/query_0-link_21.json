        "text": "Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism, died yesterday in Montreal. He was 80.\n\nMr. Trudeau suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Trudeau altered his country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen and women proud that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.\n\nMr. Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the Conservatives. Finally, in 1984, after a meditative walk in the snow, he chose to step down.\n\nMr. Trudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political equivalent of the paroxysms evoked by the Beatles. During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation. Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.\n\nMr. Trudeau supervised the process by which Canada replaced its ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his country at odds with the leadership of Canada's neighbor.\n\nWhile firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Mr. Trudeau saw to it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
