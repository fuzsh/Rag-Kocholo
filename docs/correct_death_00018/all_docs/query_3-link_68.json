        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDuring a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Modi expressed concerns about the anti-India activities of Khalistanis in Canada. Trudeau defended the Khalistanis, refusing to acknowledge the problem and stating that his country will always defend the freedom of peaceful protest. This is not the first time Canada has protected Khalistanis, as Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, refused India's request to extradite a Khalistani terrorist in 1982.\n\nCanada is known for maple syrup, poutine, the Caesar cocktail and, increasingly now, Khalistanis. The Canadian government, it appears, would be proud of all. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Canadian PM Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the recent G20 Summit in Delhi and conveyed India's “strong concerns” about the continuing anti-India activities of Khalistanis in Canada, Trudeau chose to defend Khalistanis.\n\nModi told Trudeau that Khalistanis are promoting secessionism and inciting violence against Indian diplomats, damaging diplomatic premises, and threatening the Indian community in Canada and their places of worship while being in nexus with drug and human-trafficking syndicates. Refusing to acknowledge the problem, Trudeau said his country will always defend the freedom of peaceful protest. He chose to call protests that enact assassination of former Indian PM Indira Gandhi, display AK-47s and glorify violence and terrorism as peaceful. He also said that the whole Sikh community can't be blamed for the actions of a few, but also refusing to commit to take action against those few.\n\nWhen Justin Trudeau defends Khalistanis, he is just emulating his father, who was Canada's PM twice, from 1968 to 1979 and then from 1980 to 1984.\n\nHow Trudeau's father protected the Kanishka bombing mastermind\n\nIn 1982, when India asked Canada for extradition of a Khalistani terrorist wanted in India for killing of police officers, Canada, under Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau's father, made a ludicrous excuse and refused.\n\nTerry Milewski, a reputed Canadian journalist who had worked as a senior correspondent with CBC News and has reported extensively on Khalistani movement for decades, narrates the incidents in one of his books thus:\n\n\"Canada can't be compared to Pakistan as a springboard for Khalistani militants in the past forty years, but it has offered them the great advantage of a congenial legal and political environment. The meek Canadian response to the Khalistani challenge was a frequent target of Indian politicians as far back as 1982, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi complained about it to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\n\n\"Not much came of it. Quite the reverse, in fact. It was Pierre Trudeau’s government which refused the 1982 Indian request to extradite Talwinder Parmar to India for murder, on the quaint grounds that India was insufficiently deferential to the Queen. That is not a joke. Canadian diplomats had to tell their Indian counterparts that the extradition protocols between Commonwealth countries would not apply because India only recognized Her Majesty as Head of the Commonwealth, and not as Head of State. Case closed!\"\n\nTalwinder Parmar, who was the head of Khalistani terror organisation Babbar Khalsa, would go on to bomb an Air India plane, called Kanishka, in 1985, which blew up midair off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard.\n\nIn hindsight, many would blame Pierre Trudeau for the Kanishka bombing, the biggest aviation terror strike after the 9/11 attack, because the story got murkier after Parmar was saved by Trudeau from Indian authorities. Parmar started preparing for the bombing. \"Parmar told his followers in 1984 that \"Indian planes will fall from the sky.\" That same year, his number 2, Ajaib Singh Bagri of Kamloops, B.C., cut the air with his hand as he made this pledge to the founding convention of the World Sikh Organization: \"Until we kill 50,000 Hindus, we will not rest!\",\" Milewski wrote in a CBC report.\n\nWhile Parmar and his accomplices made the bomb and tested it, Canadian authorities were aware of the activities through informers. One informer even told the police that Parmar promised him to pay a suitcase full of money if he would plant the bomb on the plane.\n\nA paid Canadian police informer said he recorded a few Sikhs on Vancouver Island discussing an attack on Air India. He told the CBC in 1987 that he used an RCMP \"body pack\" to tape conversations with suspected Sikh drug dealers in Port Alberni and Duncan. \"I was wearing a body pack and my van was wired, so the RCMP actually have a transcript of a tape telling them of a plot against Air India days to a week before it happened.\" Canadian secret agency officials even followed Talwinder Parmar and his accomplice Inderjit Reyat to the site of test-bombing on Vancouver Island and witnessed the test bomb go off.\n\nThe police and spy agencies made light of all the information that was pouring in about the planning to bomb an Air India flight. None of the informers was deemed reliable. Some key evidence was even lost or destroyed by Canadian authorities. The trial into the case resulted in the acquittal of the accused for lack of evidence. Parmar was killed by the police in 1992 when he had sneaked into Punjab from Pakistan.\n\nA commission of inquiry was set up under Justice John Major which gave a report in 2010, blaming Canadian police and spy agencies of grave negligence and botching up the investigation. Canadian authorities should have known that Air India Flight 182 was a terrorism target, Major said, adding the failure of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Canada’s spy agency Canadian Security and Intelligence Services (CSIS) to prevent the tragedy was “inexcusable.”\n\nCanada: Khalistan referendum held in Surrey a day after PM Modi raises concerns with Trudeau\n\nSikhs turned up in large numbers at a Khalistan referendum event in Canada just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed New Delhi's strong concerns the same day about continuing anti-India activities in the North American nation to his counterpart Justin Trudeau at the G20 Leaders' Summit. The vote to weigh support for Khalistan, a separate homeland for Sikhs in India, was held on Sunday in the British Columbian province of Surrey at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara where its former president Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead in June. The outlawed Pro-Khalistani group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which organised the referendum, said more than 100,000 people attended the event, the Global News channel reported.\n\nIndian diplomats on target\n\nA few months ago, Khalistanis in Canada painted a target on Indian diplomats after the killing of a Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjer in Surrey. A poster sparked outrage across India as it called India's high commissioner to Ottawa Sanjay Kumar Verma and consul general in Toronto Apoorva Srivastava as “killers” of the Khalistan Tiger Force chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nThe poster was tweeted by Milewski. \"This is extremely dangerous. Khalistanis are whipping up anger targeting Indian diplomats they call \"Killers\" of \"Shaheed\" (martyr) Hardeep Nijjar, shot in a mafia-style hit in Surrey BC June 18. There is zero evidence of any Indian role. Grossly irresponsible,\" Milewski said.\n\nCanada has been downplaying the Khalistani threat even when Indian diplomats have become the targets. Such posters can't be justified in the name of freedom of expression. In 1984, an Indian diplomat in the UK, Ravindra Hareshwar Mhatre, was kidnapped and later killed by British Kashmiri terrorists who were associated with the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front.\n\nThe compulsion of votes?\n\nTrudeau's doubling down on the Khalistan issue, instead of admitting it and promising to take required action, is known to be due to his dependence on Sikh votes. \"How Canada has dealt with the Khalistani issue has long been a concern for us. Quite frankly, they seem to be driven by vote-bank politics,\" External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had remarked.\n\nKhalistani terrorism had gained momentum in Western countries in the late seventies with one Jagjit Singh Chauhan, who had migrated to the UK after losing an election in Punjab, promoting it in various ways, even printing Khalistani dollars. The Khalistan movement became a sort of immigration scam with a large number of people from Punjab managing to get asylum in Western countries on the pretext of state oppression.\n\nThough the Khalistan movement died down in India, it kept flourishing in Western countries as the governments did not consider it a threat to their interests. In Canada, Sikhs, who comprise nearly 2 per cent of the total population today, can be easily mobilised into rallies and parades by Khalistanis who have captured most of the gurdwaras which are the centres of community activity. This gives them an outsized influence on the community affairs.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP, a party which is Trudeau's alliance partner, is a known Khalistani sympathiser, which is another reason why Trudeau can't afford to act against Khalistanis.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister Jaishankar has warned that rising Khalistani activity with links to drug syndicates is not good for Canada either. Sikh militants had in 1986 threatened to kill then Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and blow up the Toronto subway system, according to documents declassified in 2007.\n\nAn anonymous letter received by police in early July 1986 laid out the terrorist attacks that would unfold if Talwinder Parmar, who masterminded the Kanishka bombing, and others in jail at the time were not released.\n\n\"On July 8, 1986, the first indication of retaliation against the Canadian government emerged in the form of an anonymous letter to kill Prime Minister Mulroney, blast the Toronto subway system, movie theatres, banks and commercial malls,\" said an RCMP letter outlining the threat. This letter to a counterpart at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service was among thousands of formerly secret papers released as part of the massive disclosure at the Kanishka bombing inquiry.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n20 fast-growing micro-cap stocks that are making it big among retail investors\n\nThis battle royale is taking 3 studios, 400 million gamers beyond enemy lines\n\nDon’t just look overseas; Indian deep-tech should mine the domestic market: Lip-Bu Tan\n\nWhat connects Donald Trump, Nvidia share slide and Taiwan?\n\nWhy the Jammu area is becoming an epicenter of terror\n\nNow is the time for Nirmala Sitharaman to make this critical move\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
