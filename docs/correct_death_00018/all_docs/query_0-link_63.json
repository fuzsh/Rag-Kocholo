        "text": "Justin Trudeau is Canada’s 23rd Prime Minister and the leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nHis parents\n\nJustin Trudeau was born at 9:27 pm EST on Christmas Day, 1971, at the Ottawa Civic Hospital, to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who was, at the time, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada and Margaret Sinclair. Trudeau was christened with his father's niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather at Ottawa's Notre Dame Basilica on the afternoon of January 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance.\n\nHis parents married on March 4, 1971 in Vancouver. Nearly thirty years separated them; Margaret Sinclair, born in Vancouver on September 10, 1948, was only 22 whereas Pierre Elliott Trudeau was 51. The couple has 3 children: Justin the eldest, Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973) and Michel (October 2, 1975 – November 13, 1998). His parents announced their separation on May 27, 1977 when Justin Trudeau was five years old and they divorced in 1984.\n\nJustin Trudeau has three half-siblings, Kyle (1984) and Alicia (1988), from his mother's remarriage with Fred Kemper, and Sarah Elisabeth, from his father's later relationship with Deborah Coyne.\n\nPredominantly Scottish and French Canadian descent\n\nJustin Trudeau is predominantly of Scottish and French Canadian descent. Trudeau's grandfathers were businessman Charles-Emile Trudeau and Scottish-born James Sinclair who served as minister of fisheries from 1952 to 1957.\n\nSome of his maternal grandmother's ancestors were colonists in Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, including Francis James Bernard, the founder of the first Singapore Police Force in 1819. The Singapore Chronicle, the first newspaper in Singapore, was established with Bernard as owner, publisher and editor in 1824 and he opened up Katong, now a densely populated residential enclave, by being the first cultivating a coconut estate there in 1823. Bernard had married in 1818 Trudeau's 4th great-grandmother Esther Farquhar, eldest daughter of Scotsman William Farquhar, a noted colonial leader of Singapore, by Farquhar's first wife, Antoinette « Nonio » Clement, daughter of a French father and an ethnic Malaccan mother, which makes Trudeau the first Canadian prime minister to have verified non-European ancestry.[1]\n\nsource\n\n[1] Wikipedia accessed on April 18, 2016\n\nJustin Trudeau, a cousin of Hillary Clinton, Stephane Dion, Madonna, Celine Dion, Justin Bieber, Xavier Dolan, Ryan Gosling, Angelina Jolie and Camilla, Queen of the United Kingdom…\n\nperche-quebec.com has discovered that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has many family ties with other celebrities in politics (Hillary Clinton, Stephane Dion), the film industry (Ryan Gosling, Angelina Jolie, Xavier Dolan), and music (Madonna, Celine Dion, Justin Bieber, Alanis Morissette). All those celebrities have in common French-Canadian pioneers, and in particular Percheron pioneers.\n\nFor instance, the Percheron pioneer Zacharie Cloutier, an ancestor of most of the celebrities mentioned before, who was born in Mortagne-au-Perche (France).\n\nAs strange as it may seem, there is nothing exceptional about those family ties. As the Percheron pioneers were among the very first French settlers to arrive in what was then known as New France, most of North Americans with French-Canadian ancestry have Percheron blood and are more or less related.\n\nFamous cousins of Justin Trudeau\n\nsource & infographics perche-quebec.com\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has many family ties with the famous descendants of those Percheron pioneers.\n\nperche-quebec.com has found out not less than:\n\n• 350 links with Fabienne Thibeault\n\n• 149 links with Justin Bieber\n\n• 130 links with Diane Dufresne\n\n• 114 links with Isabelle Boulay\n\n• 113 links with Marc Ouellet\n\n• 110 links with Ryan Gosling\n\n• 94 links with Madonna\n\n• 90 links with Andre Gagnon\n\n• 85 links with Xavier Dolan\n\n• 84 links with Diane Tell\n\n• 76 links with Angelina Jolie\n\n• 72 links with Celine Dion\n\n• 56 links with Jack Kerouac\n\n• 50 links with Jean Paul Lemieux\n\n• 19 links with Alanis Morissette\n\n• 18 links with Hillary Clinton\n\n• 12 links with Lynda Lemay\n\n• 10 links with Camilla, Queen of the United Kingdom\n\n• 6 links with Stephane Dion"
