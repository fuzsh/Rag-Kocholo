        "text": "Canada's charismatic prime minister from 1968-1984 unified and redefined the country.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving prime minister of Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism, died yesterday in Montreal. He was 80.\n\nTrudeau had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer and, more recently, pneumonia.\n\nThroughout his career, Trudeau succeeded in altering his country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.\n\nTrudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two spans during the years 1968 to 1984, interrupted by a nine-month hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving Western leader of the postwar era.\n\nTrudeau was propelled into power in June 1968 by an enthusiastic electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political equivalent to the paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles. During his time in office, he determined the substance and tone of the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation. Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.\n\nTrudeau supervised the process by which the country replaced its ties to Britain with a constitution of its own. He fostered economic and cultural nationalism that often put him and his country at odds with the leadership of Canada's only neighbor.\n\nWhile firm in promoting a unified Canada, he was also sensitive to the needs of the mostly French-speaking Quebec. Trudeau saw to it that the role of the French language was reinforced when the entire country was made officially bilingual in 1984.\n\nTrudeau recognized Communist China long before the United States did. He led sometimes quixotic campaigns for world peace and nuclear disarmament while allying himself closely with such Socialist leaders as Olav Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of German Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.\n\nBut for most Canadians, his greatest achievement was his successful struggle against the Quebec separatist movement. After bombings, bank robberies and kidnappings by terrorists, and after he was scorned as an apostate to Quebec's cause, he ultimately won the support of most Quebec voters, who sided with him in a referendum in 1980 that took the wind out of the sails of the independence movement.\n\n\"Reason before passion,\" was his personal motto, and he used it in arguing, on economic and moral grounds, that Quebec should stay within the Canadian federation. The separatist challenge was a major crisis in Canadian history, and his admirers say he saved Canada by defeating the movement.\n\nIn his heyday, Pierre Trudeau ran his country with a panache that was aggressivel un-Canadianly immodest. He wore rakish hats, drove sports cars, flaunted his learning and his wit, dated celebrities like Barbra Streisand and toured the discos. At 52 he married a former flower child, Margaret Sinclair, who was then 22. The couple separated in 1974, after three years of marriage, and were divorced in 1984 with Trudeau getting custody of the children.\n\nIn a country so devoted to understatement, Trudeau's ascendancy marked a radical departure. His success was compared to the transformation of presidential style and leadership that took place in Washington in 1960 when John F. Kennedy was elected president.\n\nF"
