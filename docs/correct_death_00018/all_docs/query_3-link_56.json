In fact, here’s how close Dominic LeBlanc is to Trudeau: he used to be his babysitter.\n\nThat friendship is one reason LeBlanc, 47, has been appointed Government House leader. Simply put, Trudeau trusts him. Expect to see a lot of the affable Acadian in the coming months as the Liberal government tries to shepherd a raft of legislation through Parliament while revamping the way the institution itself works.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDominic LeBlanc is Trudeau's go-to guy.

He’s described as humorous and welcoming – with friends in all parties.\n\n“He knows when to bring in humour to lighten things,” says Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux. “He is prepared to work with people – political partisans. He is open to building consensus.”\n\nConservative MP Tony Clement, who has occasionally grabbed dinner with LeBlanc, notes: “He’s got the prime minister’s ear. I wish him well. It’s not an easy job.\n\n“There is some common ground but there’s frequently divergent interests,” says Clement. “He will have to (put) his bon vivant style to good use.”\n\n**\n\nAs a teenager in the 1980s, Dominic LeBlanc did his weeknight homework on Parliament Hill.\n\nAfter classes at Lisgar Collegiate, he’d walk to his father’s workplace on the fourth floor of the Centre Block, find a spare office, and pull out his school books. At the time, LeBlanc Sr. was a cabinet minister in prime minister Pierre Trudeau’s Liberal government.\n\nHomework done, he’d have supper with his father in the parliamentary dining room. By about 10 p.m., the two would leave for their home in the Glebe. “I literally grew up hanging around a lot of these buildings,” LeBlanc recalls.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnother youngster hanging around the Hill became a fast friend: Justin Trudeau.\n\nTheir fathers had known each other during Quebec’s student movement in the 1950s. Their mothers – both of whom ultimately separated from their political spouses – became close friends in the 1970s, and remain so.\n\nWhen Pierre Trudeau took his sons on a trip to Atlantic Canada in the summer of 1979, he stayed with the LeBlancs.\n\nOn weekends in the early 1980s, Margaret Trudeau took the Trudeau boys skiing to Mont Tremblant; Dominic LeBlanc was often there with his mother.\n\nHe became like an older brother to the three boisterous Trudeau boys (he’s four years older than Justin).\n\nHe babysat them – both at 24 Sussex Drive and at Margaret Trudeau’s nearby home in New Edinburgh. They played childhood pranks, such as riding around the neighbourhood on their bicycles (with RCMP security guards in tow), ringing doorbells, then fleeing.\n\nYears later, when Pierre Trudeau died, Dominic LeBlanc was an honorary pallbearer at his funeral. He extended the same honour to Justin Trudeau in 2009, when LeBlanc’s father, Romeo, died.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the summer of 2012, when Trudeau was considering a run for the Liberal leadership, he and his family took a 10-day vacation in New Brunswick, staying at LeBlanc’s home.\n\nThe two men spent a long afternoon at Captain Dan’s, a wharfside pub in Shediac, where Trudeau revealed his leadership plans.\n\nLeBlanc, who had been considering his own leadership bid, quickly dropped that idea.\n\n“At that point, I had no doubt that (Justin) was absolutely the best option for the party and for the country,” he says. “So I enthusiastically suited up to help him in the leadership.”\n\nToday, LeBlanc is tasked with setting a new tone of civility and co-operation in the House of Commons, a chamber some feel is tarnished by years of excessive partisanship.\n\nTrudeau has also instructed him to forge a new relationship with the Senate, whose future members will be appointed as Independents and where existing “Senate Liberals” no longer sit in the party’s caucus.\n\n“I hope that we set a different tone, in the sense that we recognize that every single person who is sitting in that House of Commons – from the Independents to the opposition members – was chosen by their constituencies,” said LeBlanc.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I think if opposition members in committees, for example, make amendments to government legislation that strengthens it, it’s not a defeat for us. It’s not a humiliation or a showdown. It’s actually a legislative process working well.”\n\n**\n\nLeBlanc’s father, Romeo, was press secretary to prime ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau; a member of Parliament and cabinet minister; a senator; Speaker of the Senate; and finally governor general.\n\nBut Dominc LeBlanc says his passion for elected office wasn’t a direct transplant from his father, who was “much more impressed” when he graduated from law school.\n\n“When I told him I wanted to run, he was helpful and supportive, obviously. But it wasn’t a pressure I felt coming from him.”\n\nThe political bug came partly from Jean Chrétien who, after becoming Liberal leader, ran in a 1990 byelection in Romeo LeBlanc’s former constituency. Chrétien turned to Dominic, just 23, to drive him around the riding.\n\n“He used to joke that you never put more than $10 of gas in your car. Because you want to stop and put $10 or $20 in your car at a whole bunch of different gas stations to meet people.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen Chrétien won power in 1993, Dominic LeBlanc went to work for him in the Prime Minister’s Office, staffing the Atlantic desk.\n\nHe left in 1996 to get his master’s degree at Harvard law school, thinking he might want to teach law some day. But now politics was in his blood. In the 1997 federal election, he ran in the New Brunswick riding his father, and then Chrétien, had held.\n\nHe lost to the NDP. But by the summer of 2000, he was ready to run again – and received advice from a party icon.\n\nThat August, he and his father went to a fishing lodge with Pierre Trudeau and his youngest son, Sacha. One incident from that trip – which LeBlanc politely declines to discuss today – was documented in a 2002 interview he gave to a New Brunswick newspaper.\n\nLeBlanc had spotted Pierre Trudeau sitting alone on a lakeside dock and joined him. “I hadn’t even been nominated but he knew I wanted to run, and he asked me why I wanted to,” LeBlanc told the Times & Transcript.\n\n“He told me to be careful not to take myself too seriously. He said a great deal of politics is theatre and you can succeed if you don’t take yourself too seriously, as long as you take the hopes and problems of people seriously.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLeBlanc, who has portraits of Pearson and Trudeau on his office wall, now speaks of the importance Trudeau Sr. had in his life.\n\n“He was a large part of my imagination as a kid growing up. He was a larger-than-life figure in my childhood, because he was my dad’s boss, he was my dad’s friend, and he was my friend’s dad.”\n\nAll of which brings him back to Justin Trudeau.\n\n“The bond of friendship is a multi-generation one, if you look at our fathers and our mothers even now,” LeBlanc says.\n\n“I have a deep understanding of the values that are important to (Justin) and I think I have a good understanding of the way that he wants to operate the government.\n\n“And it comes from literally knowing him since we were children.”\n\nmkennedy@ottawacitizen.com\n\nTwitter.com/Mark_Kennedy_\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
