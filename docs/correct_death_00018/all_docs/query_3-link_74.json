        "text": "Less known, though a subject of controversy since his death in 2000, was his deep devotion to the Catholic faith. It was something he held dear — and largely kept private — throughout his life, even during his years as prime minister from 1968 to 1984.\n\nJohn English, one of Canada’s best historians, didn’t set out to fuel the Trudeau and Catholicism fires. His job was to write the definitive, official account of the life of one of Canada’s most famous men. But, as he discovered after sifting through hundreds of private letters written by and to Trudeau, he could not do justice to the one subject (Trudeau’s life) without dealing with the other (his faith).\n\nWhat emerges in this first volume — dealing with Trudeau’s early years from his birth in 1919 to becoming leader of the federal Liberal party — is that the politician cannot be divorced from his religion. Even when Trudeau was viciously attacking Quebec priests and bishops, as he did often in the heady political debates of 1950s and ’60s Quebec, he was using the same language, thought categories and basic beliefs as his opponents. The church had shaped him far more than we ever knew, even though he was to later reject some of its basic moral teachings on sexuality.\n\nTrudeau grew up in the ultramontane Catholicism of early 20th-century Quebec. The church and state were two sides of the same coin in the largely francophone province. Trudeau went to Catholic schools, notably College Brebeuf in Montreal, where he was formed in his faith by Jesuit priests/teachers who instilled in him a love of literature and philosophy, not to mention intellectual rigour, and a deep piety. But there was more to his classical Jesuit education than that. The young Trudeau, arguably the brightest student in his class, was exposed to the French Catholic understanding of Quebec history and the church social teachings as expounded in the papal encyclicals of Leo XIII (Rerum Novarum) and Pius XI (Quadragesimo Anno). He also learned about economic and political theories such as corporatism promoted by French intellectuals as a third way between capitalism and communism for structuring society.\n\nTrudeau’s university studies in Montreal (law at the University of Montreal), Harvard, the Ecole libre des science politiques (Paris) and the London School of Economics broadened his intellectual and theological range. He was deeply influenced by the personalist theories of French Catholic philosophers such as Emmanuel Mounier and Jacques Maritain, along with the thought of Cardinal John Henry Newman, at the same time as he studied under the famous British communist intellectual Harold Laski.\n\nWhat emerged from his long studies and numerous bouts of globetrotting (funded by the wealth left to him by his late father, Charles Trudeau) was a highly educated, erudite, passionate but terribly conflicted young man. His personality — contrarian, arrogant at times, charming and flamboyant — made him a person with incredible leadership potential but also given to dilettantism. At times, he even enraged his closest associates for his seeming fickleness.\n\nThe young Trudeau liked to dabble. During the Second World War, he escaped overseas service and rode the Quebec countryside on his Harley Davidson, espousing French nationalism and even participating in anti-Semitic protests. Later he travelled through many countries behind the Iron Curtain and came back defending Communist economics and downplaying their oppression of basic human rights.\n\nYet even on his travels, he sought out companionship from priests and missionaries. In his studies, he asked permission from the bishop to study texts on the Index of Forbidden Books and his early love affairs were tinged with fervent prayers and tension over the limits placed on intimacy by his church.\n\nIn the 1960s, Trudeau became a child of his times, reflecting its more casual attitudes towards sex, fashion and music. Politically, he began to reject the nationalism of his youth and developed a “functional politics” that saw Canadian federalism as the best channel for the development of Quebec’s potential. He railed against the stifling political culture of his province and included the Quebec church on his list of those who, as he saw, kept Quebeckers from maturing politically, culturally and economically.\n\nThrough it all, however, he remained a Catholic, if unorthodox at times. His dissent made him the target — quite rightly — of Catholics on both sides of the political spectrum who accused him of promoting a secular agenda, on one hand, and on the other ignoring the church’s preferential option for the poor.\n\nEnglish, having at his disposal Trudeau’s private papers, the Trudeau family’s private archives and unprecedented access to many of his subject’s closest friends, has in this first volume sketched the most comprehensive picture of Trudeau yet published (which is saying much, considering the mountain of books about or by Trudeau). We see in all his ideals, talents, gifts, flaws and faith, a man whose conflicting elements would meld to create one of Canada’s most dominant, if unpredictable, political leaders.\n\nTrudeau’s intellectual development framed within his faith"
