        "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau must have been feeling the heat.\n\nMr Trudeau will not attend Fidel Castro's funeral in Cuba this week, despite the decades-long friendship between his father and the former Cuban communist leader.\n\nCanada will be represented by Governor General David Johnston at a memorial service in Havana on Tuesday.\n\nMr Trudeau's decision comes after his initial statement on Castro's death was mocked worldwide.\n\nOver the weekend, the hashtag #trudeaueulogies trended after the prime minister's office released a statement, external referring to \"Cuba's longest serving President\" as a \"remarkable leader\" for whom the Cuban people had \"a deep and lasting affection\".\n\nOn Monday, his Canadian political opponents called Mr Trudeau \"naive\" for ignoring human rights abuses in the Caribbean nation.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented a \"dark legacy\", external under Castro that included the punishment of dissent and the incarceration of political opponents.\n\nMr Trudeau tersely conceded to journalists on Sunday that Castro was a dictator and that \"there certainly were significant concerns around human rights\".\n\nHe added: \"The fact is Fidel Castro had a deep and lasting impact on the Cuban people\".\n\nCastro's critics have been pressuring Mr Trudeau and other world leaders to snub the controversial former leader's funeral.\n\nUS President Barack Obama, external and UK Prime Minister Theresa May are not attending. The prime minister's office says Mr Trudeau's schedule is preventing him from making an appearance.\n\nCuban-Canadian musician Luis Mario Ochoa, who fled Cuba in 1990, said Mr Trudeau had made the right decision to forgo the event.\n\nThe musician said it made no sense that Canada would recognise the \"pain\" and oppression he experienced under the Castro regime by granting him asylum, while having Mr Trudeau pay tribute to Castro in official statements.\n\nBut with Mr Trudeau's decision to skip the funeral, Mr Ochoa said he's \"willing to forget and forgive\" the earlier remarks.\n\nCanada and Cuba have long-lasting diplomatic ties."
