        "text": "Pierre Elliott Trudeau (18 October 1919 - 28 September 2000)[1] was a Canadian politician and the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, serving from 1968-1979, and from 1980-1984.\n\nAs Minister of Justice in Lester B. Pearson's cabinet, Trudeau introduced the Criminal Law Amendment Act to Parliament, which, among other things, decriminalised homosexuality, and stated publicly in its defence, \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\".\n\nThe announcement of his entry into the leadership race to succeed Pearson triggered \"Trudeaumania\", which followed him through his first election. As Prime Minister, he instituted both policies of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism. He lead the country through the October Crisis, when Marxist terrorist group the Front de libération du Québec kidnapped British Trade Consul James Cross and Quebec Labour Minister Pierre LaPorte, though at the cost of invoking the War Measures Act.\n\nHe opened Canadian relations with Communist China prior to American President Richard Nixon doing so; A trip to Cuba saw a lifelong friendship begin between him and Fidel Castro. On the domestic side, Trudeau worked to counter the separatist ambitions of Quebec. His final achievement in government was the Patriation of the Canadian Constitution, ending the ability of the British Government to amend it, and giving Canada the full responsibility to do so.\n\nHe resigned from the position in 1984, and was succeeded by John Turner, who was in turn defeated by Brian Mulroney in the next election. Trudeau remained a prominent figure in politics, such as when he objected to Mulroney's proposed Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. On 4 November 2015, his son Justin Trudeau became the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nTBW\n\nMemorials and Monuments[]\n\nGravesite[]\n\nTrudeau was buried in the Trudeau family crypt in St-Rémi-de-Napierville Cemetery, in the town of St-Rémi, Quebec.
