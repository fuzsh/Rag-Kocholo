        "text": "Montréal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL) is one of Canada’s most important transportation centres. Located a short ride—typically 20 minutes—west of downtown Montréal, the airport is named in honour of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada and father of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAirlines servicing the Montréal-Trudeau International Airport offer year-round, non-stop flights from nearly 150 destinations across Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. This means that for millions and millions of people around the world, Montréal is accessible within one or two flights. In fact, approximately 20 million passengers pass through the airport during an average year.\n\nPerhaps you’ll be one of them soon?\n\nLanding in Montréal\n\nArriving Internationally/from the USA\n\nSince 2016, visitors from other countries who fly to or transit through Canada need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). Exceptions include U.S. citizens and travellers with a valid Canadian visa. The application is completed online and costs $7. Apply now for an eTA!\n\nEveryone arriving via an international flight must pass through border services. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is responsible for providing integrated border services in Canada, including customs, immigration, and luggage inspection services. Expect to answer simple questions around the purpose of your travels, where you’ll be staying, and what you’ll be doing in Canada. Depending upon your citizenship and the number of arriving flights, this process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours.\n\nArriving domestically\n\nIt’s straightforward. Follow the signage to either the baggage carrousel or the exit.\n\nTransportation options to/from the airport\n\nPublic transit\n\nWith 24-hour service, seven days a week, 365 days a year, the 747 shuttle service offers convenient transportation between the airport and downtown, and with ample space for your luggage.\n\nTwo route options are available from the airport. The short route is direct, offering a single stop at Lionel-Groulx Métro station. The long route offers 11 stops, including Lionel-Groulx and Berri-UQAM Métro stations, plus stops at hotels on René-Lévesque Boulevard. Ask your driver which route is being served.\n\nDon’t miss this step! Whether you’re leaving the airport or going to the airport, it’s best to get your ticket before boarding. At the airport, buy a ticket at one of the four vending machines in the international arrivals area. If you’re downtown, visit any of the Métro stations. You can pay in cash, by debit card, or with VISA or MasterCard credit card. You will need the 24-hour ticket, which currently costs $11. (Note: it is possible to purchase a ticket on board, but you’ll need exact fare: $11 in coins.)\n\nAt the airport, you’ll catch the 747 shuttle bus a few meters from the exit at Door 28. Simply look for the signs.\n\nTaxi\n\nYou can nab a taxi at the arrivals level at Door 23, where a dispatcher will assist you. The current flat rate to downtown Montréal is $48.40 (confirm rate here). Drivers accept cash or cards.\n\nFor travellers with limited mobility (such as wheelchair users), there are also a certain number of adapted taxis that are available. Simply ask the dispatcher.\n\nUber\n\nThe cost of an Uber trip from YUL to downtown depends on factors that include the type of ride you request, the estimated length/duration of the trip, and current demand for rides. You can see an estimate of the price by entering your pickup spot and destination in Uber’s price estimator. When you request a ride, you’ll see your actual price in the app based on real-time factors.\n\nThere are two possible locations for passenger pick-up:\n\n• Door # 8 - Departures level\n\n• Door # 21 - Arrivals level\n\nFollow the instructions provided in the app and it will tell you where to meet your driver.\n\nLimousine\n\nReady to roll into Montréal in style? For limousine service, head to the terminal located at Door 24 on the Arrivals level. You’ll need to place an order on site by providing your first name, destination, and a valid email address before boarding a vehicle.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to book limousine service prior to arriving at YUL. However, limousines are usually available at the door at all times.\n\nDeparting Montréal\n\nWhen departing from the Montréal-Trudeau International Airport, it’s helpful to know that travellers to domestic and international pass through the same security area: Checkpoint A. Head to the departures level and access any of the entrances between 1 to 6. For international flights, it is recommended to arrive three hours before your scheduled flight time.\n\nTravellers flying directly to the USA will head to the departures level and use entrances 7 to 12. Keep in mind that you’ll pass through USA border control before boarding your flight, so budget enough time for this process. It is recommended to arrive three hours before your scheduled flight time."
