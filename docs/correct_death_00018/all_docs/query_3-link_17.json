        "text": "WHEN I first came to New York, in 1985, a friend and I were sitting in what was then called the Kenny Scharf Room downstairs at the Palladium and this hip-looking old guy walked in with a gorgeous chick on each arm.\n\nIt was Pierre Elliott Trudeau.\n\nThat's my lasting memory of the late Canadian prime minister, whose recent death has been mourned fanatically in my native land, which I happened to visit last weekend. The television, radio and newspaper coverage of his legacy was nonstop. Beating the separatists. Bilingualism. Creating a national charter of rights. And most impressive of all, making Canada cool. He would have been 66 when I saw him, retired after almost 16 years in power and still making the scene.\n\nThe man had style. Almost everything about him was the antithesis of the two men jogging for the presidency in this country. Not just his slightly pink politics and subversive sense of humor. ''An exciting party,'' he once declared, ''should have both blondes and brunettes.'' But he would never have shown up for a debate in the same suit and tie as his opponent.\n\n''Style is the man himself,'' Trudeau said, quoting Buffon, an 18th-century French aristocrat and polymath with whom he no doubt identified.\n\nAl Gore and George W. Bush play it pathologically safe. The archive pictures of Trudeau reprinted after his death are a rogue's gallery of sartorial bravado. Half the time he looks more like a pimp than a prime minister. A fedora and cape for a football game. A full-length fur to go ice-skating. A white jacket with the collar spread way outside the lapel for a photo op with Ronald Reagan. Ascots, buckskin fringe jackets, striped sailor shirts, berets, Eskimo garb -- he pulled it all off. In the worst fashion excesses of the 70's, he still looks hip.\n\nNo consultant told him to make a red rose in his lapel his signature. He just did.\n\nTelevised coverage of the Liberal Party convention at which Trudeau won the leadership was playing in the background of my sixth-birthday party. It must have had what Mr. Bush might call a ''subliminable'' effect, because 10 years later I had a big red Trudeau poster on the wall next to my bed, no doubt hoping that some of his legendary mojo would rub off.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
