He had died a week earlier in an avalanche while backcountry skiing with friends in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park in British Columbia, where he was living and working at a mountain resort. He was 23.\n\nThe image depicts four grief-stricken people — but, to Mahoney, it is all about Margaret Trudeau.\n\nShe looks striking, for one, with the large crucifix she is wearing and her black pillbox hat and long black veil, and she is being supported — held up, probably — by her surviving children.\n\n“She has her arms around both her sons and they have got theirs around her,” he said.\n\nPierre Trudeau looks to be off to the side, somehow remote from the rest.\n\n“He is there, but he is not physically connected to the rest of them,” Mahoney said. Pierre and Margaret Trudeau divorced in 1984, during his final months as prime minister.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMahoney said he didn’t completely grasp the power of the photo until he was editing what he had shot. “I was just following them down the stairs of the church and trying to frame them properly. It was more about capturing the entire scene,” he recalled.\n\n“It’s in the editing process, more than when you are shooting, that you start to notice the expressions on the faces of your subjects.”\n\nFrom the time of his son’s death until his own death in 2000, Pierre Trudeau “was never the same man,” Justin Trudeau observed in his 2014 memoir, Common Ground. “My own opinion was that the lights began to dim in my father’s soul when Michel died.”\n\nDespite an extensive search, Michel Trudeau’s body was never recovered. The family called off the search and, later, had a chalet built nearby as a memorial to a son and brother.\n\nsschwartz@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBrownstein: Margaret Trudeau leaves no stone unturned in compelling confessional\n\nHistory Through Our Eyes: March 7, 1985, all eyes on Pierre Trudeau\n\nArcher: Introducing the Montreal Gazette's Photographic Memory series\n\nMore from our Photographic Memory series\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
