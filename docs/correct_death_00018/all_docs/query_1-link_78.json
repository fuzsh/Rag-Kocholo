Pierre faced levels of public revulsion that were virtually unprecedented. Even the pro-Trudeau columnist Tami Nolan greeted his 1984 departure with the prediction that he “would be remembered for all time as the most reviled personally.”\n\nCanada in 1984 had a debt load, an international reputation and a military that were in measurably worse shape than when Trudeau started. Most notably, Trudeau faced a revitalized Conservative opposition that would swiftly hand his Liberals one of their most humiliating defeats.\n\nBut for all the messes left behind by 16 years of Pierre Trudeau, Canada in 1984 lacked many of the most potent national crises that now define his son’s third term. Below, a quick guide to how Canada in the wake of its first Trudeau was arguably in better shape than today.\n\nHouses were actually quite affordable\n\nThis is probably the most immediate disparity between modern-day Canada and the Canada of 40 years ago. When Pierre Trudeau left office, it was pretty easy for Canadians to afford a respectable house, even if they only earned a single middle-class income. In mid-1984, the average price of a Canadian home was an inflation-adjusted $220,000 — about one-third of the current average.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nInternal government reports at the time claimed that Canadians were “among the best housed people in the world” — and they had the figures to prove it.\n\nWhat’s more, this was all due in large part to Liberal policy. The government of Pierre Trudeau had pursued an extremely aggressive housing strategy on all fronts: A record-breaking increase in subsidized affordable housing, along with a barrage of incentives and tax credits to spur private-sector homebuilding.\n\nAt the peak of the boom, in 1974, Canada built 257,243 new homes. It’s a rate of homebuilding that has never been surpassed, even as the overall Canadian population has nearly doubled.\n\nImmigration was lower than usual (instead of higher than ever)\n\nThese days, even sober-minded economists are saying that Canadian immigration policy has lost all touch with reality.\n\n“In no version of reality can housing supply respond to an almost overnight tripling in the run-rate of new bodies,” BMO economist Robert Kavcic wrote in one recent report. “Immigration is excessive. Full stop,” wrote an economist for Scotiabank.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe reason is an absolutely unprecedented surge not only in conventional immigrants, but in refugee claimants, foreign students and temporary foreign workers. Canada is currently one of the top five fastest-growing countries on earth; and all of its competitors in that regard are extremely high birthrate countries located in the developing world.\n\nPierre Trudeau, by contrast, slowed Canadian immigration to an absolute trickle throughout his tenure. The same prime minister who popularized Canadian usage of the term “multiculturalism” was also extremely willing to slash immigration targets and even refugee quotas in response to economic concerns.\n\nImmigration was in steady decline for the latter half of Trudeau’s premiership, and in his final year had dropped below 100,000 per year. The 89,000 immigrants that came to Canada in 1983 would account for roughly three weeks’ worth of migration at current numbers. In just the third quarter of 2023, Canada counted a record-breaking population increase of 430,635, almost all of it by immigration.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nFired scientists at Winnipeg lab worked closely and covertly with Chinese government, CSIS report says\n\nCanadians' paycheques are smaller due to 'Trudeau's sneaky new payroll tax'. Here's what to know\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe military was weakened, but not in utter crisis\n\nBoth Trudeaus treated the Canadian Armed Forces as an afterthought (as have most Canadian prime ministers of the last 40 years). But the military of 1984 wasn’t nearly as shambolic as today mostly because it was still coming down from a mid-century high.\n\nPierre started out in 1968 with a Canadian military that was at the absolute apex of its Cold War strength; multiple European bases, domestically manufactured fighter jets, deployments in Cyprus and the Middle East, an aircraft carrier, 100,000 personnel, even nuclear weapons (although those were controlled by the U.S.).\n\nWhen Pierre left, the military was smaller and received a much slimmer share of the federal budget, but Canada was still spending two per cent of GDP on defence — a benchmark it isn’t even close to meeting today.\n\nJustin Trudeau, by contrast, inherited a military that was already underfunded, understaffed and beset by procurement issues. Nine years later, all of those have gotten so much worse that the Canadian Armed Forces is basically running on safe mode.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe scandals and corruption weren’t quite as brazen\n\nThe defining scandal of the 1984 general election was that in Pierre Trudeau’s final days, he had approved roughly 200 patronage appointments to Liberal Party stalwarts — including making cabinet minister Bryce Mackasey the ambassador to Portugal.\n\nNone of the appointments were illegal; they just seemed skeezy, particularly when Trudeau’s successor John Turner refused to reverse them. “You had an option, sir,” Progressive Conservative Leader Brian Mulroney would memorably tell Turner during the 1984 leaders’ debate.\n\nNowadays, the ArriveCan scandal alone threatens to dwarf the relative political malfeasance of making 200 patronage appointments. While the details are still coming out, it could well involve tens of millions in misallocated federal monies. Add to that a series of scandals involving alleged political interference in the justice system (the SNC Lavalin scandal, the Brenda Lucki affair) as well as no shortage of patronage appointments.\n\nJust last year, Ottawa spent weeks being wracked by controversy that the Liberals’ special rapporteur for foreign interference was David Johnston, a former governor general who literally used to ski with the Trudeau family.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPer-capita GDP still wasn’t too far off the Americans\n\nFalling Canadian productivity is not a Justin Trudeau phenomenon; for decades, Canada has been incrementally generating less and less economic output per worker.\n\nUnder current conditions, this effectively means that Canada is set to see relatively stagnant living standards even as much of the rest of the world gets richer. And in recent years, this has been particularly noticeable when comparing Canadian per-capita GDP to figures in the United States. Last June, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe calculated that if Canada had kept up the same productivity growth as the United States, we’d all be making an extra $5,000.\n\nBut in 1984 — regardless of whether Pierre Trudeau had anything to do with it — the wealth and living standards of the average Canadian were much closer to those of the average American.\n\nAccording to figures compiled by the World Bank, in 1984 Canadian per-capita GDP was US$13,930.50, as compared to the U.S. figure of US$17,121.20 — a gap of just 19 per cent. In 2022, the most recent year for which they have data, Canadian per-capita GDP was US$55,522 to US$76,329 for the Americans — a gap of 28 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDebt accumulation, however, was arguably higher under Pierre Trudeau\n\nBoth Trudeaus stand out for their reckless disregard for fiscal responsibility. In just nine years, Justin Trudeau has effectively doubled the federal debt, with COVID spending representing a significant chunk of that.\n\nBut the elder Trudeau still managed to run up the national credit card at levels that remain jaw-dropping.\n\nThe federal debt stood at an inflation-adjusted $170 billion when Pierre took office in 1968. By the last full year of his tenure, it had grown to an inflation-adjusted $381 billion — an increase of 220 per cent.\n\nBy the final years of his premiership, Trudeau was running up deficits that were as high as eight per cent of GDP. In Trudeau’s last federal budget, the deficit was an inflation-adjusted $79 billion — way higher than the $40 billion Ottawa is forecasting for this year.\n\nAnd Pierre Trudeau managed to accumulate these kinds of deficits while overseeing a country of only 25 million — and with way lower built-in entitlement costs, such as health care.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nOne of the more overlooked aspects of the Liberals’ just-proposed Online Harms Bill is that it would empower judges to detain Canadians merely on the suspicion that they’re going to say something hateful online. A new category of peace bond proposed by the bill would “allow a judge to impose conditions on an individual where there are reasonable grounds to fear that they will commit a hate propaganda offence or hate crime,” according to a Trudeau government backgrounder. The peace bond would not need “evidence that an offence has actually been committed,” as it is “a preventative measure to protect all people.”\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA routine divorce case in Vancouver was recently complicated by revelations that one of the lawyers involved had cited fake civil precedent that had been concocted by an AI engine. A B.C. Supreme Court decision noted that Chong Ke, the lawyer for the respondent in the case, had used ChatGPT to research precedent for the case – and didn’t appear to be aware that the AI engine had simply provided a series of fictitious cases. “It led to opposing counsel expending considerable time and expense to determine whether the cases existed or not,” it read.\n\nGet all of these insights and more into your inbox by signing up for the First Reading newsletter here.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nGet the latest from Tristin Hopper straight to your inbox\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
