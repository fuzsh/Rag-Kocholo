But not alone.\n\nTrudeau flew into Vancouver at 6:30 p.m., hopped in a car and drove to St. Stephen’s Roman Catholic Church in North Vancouver, where “the most eligible bachelor of international politics” married Margaret Sinclair of West Van.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nOnly a dozen family members were at the ceremony — and no members of the press. Even his cabinet ministers were kept in the dark.\n\n“The (marriage) was kept so secret that only one of the bride’s four sisters, the bridesmaid, knew of the wedding until the last minute — the others thought they were dressing up for a ‘family portrait’,” reported The Province.\n\n“Rev. John Swinkels, the Roman Catholic priest who performed the ceremony and the wedding photographer had been told that Margaret Sinclair was marrying a ‘Pierre Mercier’.”\n\nProvince photographer Bill Cunningham lived near the Sinclair home in the British Properties. He got a tip something was up, and arrived to find Pierre and Margaret leaving the Sinclair house.\n\nCunningham’s memorable photo of the beaming couple being showered in rice took up most of the front page of the March 5 paper, under the giant headline “PM SECRETLY WEDS W. VAN. GIRL HERE.”\n\nThe Sun’s headline was “After Secret Wedding Here, PM Honeymoons at Whistler”. It ran several pages of photos, some by wedding photographer Fred Schiffer, others by The Sun’s Ken Oakes from the reception at the Capilano Golf and Country Club.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBoth papers played up Margaret’s age, 22. That was 29 years younger than Pierre.\n\n“He may be old but he’s a young man at heart,” said Margaret’s mother Kathleen, who was two years younger than her new son-in-law. “They are very well suited to each other and it has been a happy courtship.”\n\nB.C. newspaper legend Ma Murray predicted marriage would make Trudeau “a hell of a lot smarter”.\n\n“God, he should have done it 30 years ago,” said the 83-year-old Murray. “He’s going to have a hard time living up to the requirements of a 22-year-old bride, but I wish him lots of luck.”\n\nAccording to the papers, the couple met in Tahiti in 1967, where the Sinclair family was on vacation. Pierre knew Margaret’s dad James, who was a prominent west coast Liberal.\n\nMargaret worked in Ottawa in 1969, and that August Sun photographer Dan Scott took a photo of Trudeau and Margaret having an “intimate dinner” at a restaurant atop Grouse Mountain.\n\nBut the PM’s name continued to be linked with many women, including singer Barbra Streisand, until his surprise wedding.\n\nSun columnist Allan Fotheringham recalled his first encounter with Margaret in March 1968, when he noticed a “charming little smasher bouncing up and down with excitement” at the prospect of seeing Trudeau.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Her eyes sparkled and she kept asking her girlfriend ‘Do you think he’ll remember me?’” Fotheringham wrote.\n\n“When Trudeau appeared she jumped in front of him, kissed him on both cheeks and asked, in shy wonderment, her face turned up to his, if he remembered. He did indeed.”\n\nThe papers reported that Margaret had made their three-tiered wedding cake herself. They noted that the wedding party went through six bottles of champagne at the reception. And they wrote the couple sped off in an RCMP cruiser.\n\nThe couple honeymooned at Whistler, where the Sinclair family had a cabin. Trudeau joked to the hordes of reporters that met him on the slopes that marrying Margaret was his “first centennial project” for B.C., which had entered Confederation in 1871.\n\nThe Sun asked Montreal astrologer John Manolesco to make some predictions about the marriage.\n\n“Rummaging through his charts and astrology books, Mandolesco forecast there will be two children in the marriage — and all the signs point towards girls,” said The Sun story.\n\n“In short, he said, the marriage between Trudeau the Libra and Margaret the Virgo will be successful.”\n\nJust over nine months after the marriage, Margaret gave birth to a son, Justin, on Christmas Day, 1971. The couple would have two more sons, and separated in 1977.\n\njmackie@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
