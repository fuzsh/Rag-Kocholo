        "text": "It was as the Liberals' energy and resources minister that Lalonde made his mark, with the National Energy Program.\n\nArticle content\n\nMarc Lalonde, the Liberal cabinet minister considered the right hand man of then-prime minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, died on Sunday at the age of 93.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted to the news on his Twitter account on Sunday night. “I remember him and my dad sitting around our dinner table, having long and engaging debates on anything and everything — including our country, its people and its future,” he tweeted.\n\nElected for the first time in 1972 in the federal riding of Outremont, Lalonde was already familiar with the mechanics of power, having worked as principal secretary for prime ministers Lester B. Pearson and the elder Trudeau.\n\nBorn the son of a farmer in Île-Perrot, Lalonde studied law in Montreal and then at Oxford. His education was marked by the Action catholique movement, where many future leaders were active and discussed the future of Quebec prior to the Quiet Revolution.\n\nHis aquiline profile and serious demeanour projected the image of a serious and rigorous personality.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

However, it was within the ranks of the federal Liberal Party that Lalonde would make his mark.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1968, Lalonde worked alongside Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson and was one of the key players behind the surprise candidacy of Pierre Trudeau during the party leadership race in 1968.\n\nOnce he became prime minister, Trudeau kept Lalonde in his entourage, beginning an association that would see the latter become a mainstay of the Trudeau administration. As principal secretary, no decision or nomination was made without his say so.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Lalonde was Trudeau’s political body man, dealing with backroom work, imposing discipline and deciding who gained access to the leader.\n\nDuring the 1970 October Crisis, Lalonde was the liaison with the Quebec government during the imposition of the War Measures Act. While he would not hesitate to confront Trudeau over a divergence of opinion, he was nevertheless in tune with his boss’s view of Quebec within the federation.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn October 1972, Lalonde was elected MP for the Montreal riding of Outremont and became health minister, a portfolio he held until 1977. With the election in 1976 of the Parti Québécois government, Lalonde was also tasked by Trudeau to oversee federal-provincial relations.\n\nAs health minister, Lalonde tabled a report that argued good health was a result of a healthy lifestyle. “This idea, now widely accepted, managed to change and save lives in Canada and through the world,” Justin Trudeau wrote.\n\nLalonde was named justice minister in 1978 and continued to oversee the Liberal caucus in Quebec, ensuring Trudeau’s leadership remained unquestioned.\n\nHowever, it was as energy and resources minister that Lalonde made his mark with the National Energy Program. Aimed at ensuring petroleum self-sufficiency, the policy was reviled in the western provinces as unwarranted state intervention in the energy industry.\n\nAfter moving to the finance portfolio in 1982, few observers felt Lalonde would remain in Ottawa once Trudeau announced his departure from politics in 1984.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen John Turner was voted to the Liberal leadership, it was clear Lalonde’s political weight in Ottawa was diminished and, while still finance minister, he campaigned for the job of secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. He failed, a public defeat that left a bitter taste.\n\nLalonde left politics in July 1984 and returned to the practice of law with the firm Stikeman Elliot, where he specialized in commercial law. He represented Canada in numerous commercial disputes such as that between Canada and Brazil over the production of regional jets. Lalonde also represented certain companies in their dealings with Ottawa. Eyebrows were raised when Lalonde, a former health minister, worked as a lobbyist for a cigarette manufacturer.\n\nLalonde returned to the political scene in 2005 when he agreed to co-preside over the Quebec campaign of prime minister Paul Martin. He made headlines again in 2008 in connection with the payments of thousands of dollars by arms dealer Karlheinz Schreiber to former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Lalonde had worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for Schreiber.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJustin Trudeau’s tribute to Lalonde on Sunday night noted that whether in the portfolios of “finance, justice, sports or status of women … he worked hard to improve the lives of Canadians.”\n\nFederal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos noted that Lalonde “dedicated his life to improving the lives of Canadians by defending the rights of minorities and reinforcing our public health system. Thank you for all you have done for our country.”\n\nRachel Bendayan, the Liberal MP in Outremont riding, wrote that Lalonde was “one of the best Outremont MPs, one of the best justice ministers. … A great leader, a great Liberal, a great friend to me. Thank you, dear Marc Lalonde, for all you have done for our community and our country.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nAuthor and musician Dane Lanken had 'a mind full of wonder'\n\n‘International rock star’ of medical research Charles Scriver has died at 92\n\nMontreal TV personality Don McGowan remembered as a consummate pro\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
