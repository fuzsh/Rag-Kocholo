        "text": "Concrete also exacerbates heat waves because it radiates heat even after the sun goes down, keeping temperatures up overnight and prolonging hot stretches.\n\nAnother compounding factor is age. Because older people are more susceptible to heat, and Canada’s population is rapidly aging, summers are getting much more difficult for seniors.\n\nAnd because heat builds up in sick and elderly people over time, the longer the heat wave, the more deadly it becomes.\n\nHeat may be the most visceral effect of climate change. Unlike projected sea-level rise or distant melting polar ice caps, urban heat waves are already killing Canadians.\n\nIII\n\nI arrived in Montreal in April, under grey skies and with snow lingering on the streets, so it was difficult to picture the city under a beating sun.\n\nBut at the Montreal Heart Institute’s integrative human physiology laboratory, there’s a climate-controlled chamber that acts like a time machine. Professor Daniel Gagnon can recreate the precise conditions of any heat wave — the hot and dry Australian heat wave last January that had highs of 46 degrees or 1995’s hot and humid heat wave in Chicago, when temperatures reached 39 degrees, but with the humidity, it actually felt like 56 degrees.\n\nHumidity, beyond making the heat feel worse, actually thwarts your body’s ability to cool itself.\n\n“For the sweat to evaporate, there needs to be room in the air to accept the sweat,” said Gagnon. “The more humid it is, the less room there is for the sweat to move from the skin into the air.”\n\n“Even though somebody can produce a lot of sweat, it won’t evaporate,” he said. “It’s a much more stressful environment…that way of losing heat is just completely blocked. It just drips and it doesn't provide any cooling power.”\n\nSince the sweat has nowhere to go, it stays on the skin’s surface and you end up sweating less as a result.\n\nAs we wrapped up, removing the wires and sensors, I felt light-headed. I had to be helped up as I walked, on unsteady legs, out to the scale to weigh myself.\n\nAfter compensating for the water I drank while inside, we were able to determine that I sweat out a whole pound during my 90 minutes in the chamber. It became clear just how easy it is — even for a (relatively) young and healthy person like myself, and even in the humid heat where you sweat less — to become dangerously dehydrated.\n\nIV\n\nSixty-six people died from the heat in Montreal in the first week of July 2018. Eighty-nine across Quebec.\n\nYet zero in Ottawa. Zero in Ontario.\n\nThe Ottawa River, which divides the two provinces, didn’t separate two major weather systems last summer. Heat and humidity ignore political borders.\n\nSome speculated that a lack of air conditioning caused more people to die in Quebec.\n\nStatistics Canada data seem to bear this out. Only 53 per cent of households in Quebec have central air or use a window unit, while 83 per cent of Ontarians have some form of A/C at home. In Montreal, 65 per cent of households have A/C, while in Ottawa it’s 82 per cent and 87 per cent in Toronto.\n\n“Somebody who has a weak heart and is exposed to high temperatures for a couple of days, they tend to have heart attacks.”\n\nBut could this really account for the stark difference in deaths between the two provinces?\n\nDr. David Kaiser, a preventive medicine specialist with Montreal public health, doesn’t think so.\n\n“It’s because of the way things are counted,” he said.\n\nRather than being an issue of more people dying in Quebec, the death discrepancy reflects the fact that Montreal health-care workers count better. They’re finding the kinds of heat-related deaths that are surely occurring in Ontario as well but remain hidden because no one is looking for them.\n\nThis is because people who die during heat waves are not dying from heat stroke, a medical diagnosis that is coded into medical records, Kaiser said. If you only count deaths by heat stroke, you’re missing the vast majority.\n\n“If somebody comes to the emergency room who is 75 years old, has underlying heart disease and he’s dehydrated and…has a heart attack due to his low-blood pressure, he will be coded as a heart attack. And we won’t be able to get any further information out of medical records,” Kaiser explained.\n\n“If the coroner doesn’t have information that he had an elevated body temperature, signs of heat-related illness, heatstroke and shock, they won’t count it as a heat-related death.”\n\nPeople who die in heat waves are often already very frail, and this can obscure for health-care workers the role that heat might have played to hasten their demise.\n\nKaiser, who heads a team of specialists planning for Montreal’s next heat wave, says cities across the country cannot address the problem of heat-related deaths unless they’re counting them correctly.\n\n“If you don’t have the data, then you don’t solve the problem. And you can only solve problems for things you can measure, right? So if you’re not measuring, you’re not going to do anything about it,” he said.\n\nOntario’s chief coroner’s office declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe best strategies … are the ones that will reduce — even by one degree — the maximum heat that we’re going to have in our cities 30 years from now,\n\nMost cities have protocols that kick in when heat waves strike. But in addition to standard measures extending hours at public pools and opening cooling centres, Montreal implements “active surveillance” for heat-related deaths across the heathcare system.\n\nFor every death they encounter, emergency room workers, paramedics and coroners fill out forms that ask about pre-existing health conditions, whether the patient had air conditioning, and even what the room temperature is when people are found dead at home.\n\nThe questionnaires provide key information that allows public-heath workers to determine whether heat played a role in the death. By tracking heat deaths in real time, Kaiser and his team can identify neighbourhoods or even buildings where there’s an elevated risk.\n\n“The primary objective is to identify where people are dying during heat waves, so that we can deploy resources,” said Kaiser. “If we’re able to use unfortunate deaths that occur during a heat wave to identify specific buildings, specific locations where more people are at risk, we can have an impact.”\n\nThis active surveillance system was put in place in the early 2000s after the European heat waves that killed tens of thousands in Paris. There are already signs of improvement. During the last heat wave in 2010, Montreal recorded 103 deaths — a rate of 9.3 deaths per million people per day. Last summer, even though the heat wave was longer and more intense, the death rate dropped by 31 per cent, down to 6.4 deaths per million people per day.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to definitively credit a single program, the active surveillance, improved public awareness and outreach to vulnerable areas all played a role in limiting the number of heat deaths.\n\nSeen that way, the deaths in Montreal aren’t a reflection of failure, but of improvement.\n\nYet, these kinds of public-health emergency actions will not suffice on their own. In the long run, the city itself must change to handle the heat.\n\nV\n\nThe reasons why people are dying in Parc-Ex and not TMR are both social and environmental. Many in Parc-Ex can’t afford A/C. But their need for A/C is greater because of the lack of tree cover and cooling greenery.\n\nNo heat-wave response will make Parc-Ex any cooler. That’s why Kaiser at Montreal public health says we have to think beyond improving emergency procedures and work between heat waves to reduce the impact of the next.\n\n“The best strategies you can put in place today are the ones that will reduce—even by one degree—the maximum heat that we’re going to have in our cities 30 years from now,” he said.\n\nThis means dramatically reducing global emissions, but also reducing heat locally, so the hot neighbourhoods are a few degrees cooler.\n\n“From a public-health perspective, it’s an important strategy to be able to link environmental interventions to health,” said Kaiser.\n\nVI\n\nTwo summers ago in Phoenix, Arizona, it was so hot they had to close the airport because planes couldn’t get the lift they needed to take off.\n\nWith temperatures hitting 48 degrees every summer, the city is coping with the most extreme effects of urban heat waves in North America.\n\nAnd in a place where virtually everyone has A/C, the limitations of the “best way” to beat the heat are becoming evident.\n\nWhen temperatures rise, everyone turns up their air conditioning. This puts enormous stress on the electrical grid, resulting in rolling blackouts or brownouts. Then no one has A/C, and those whose lives depend on it are in peril.\n\n“Here, in this neighbourhood, we’ve had issues with the power, because everyone wants to crank up their A/C…and it’s too much power, so the power falls off,” said Maggie Messerschmidt, a local organizer with The Nature Conservancy.\n\nMesserschmidt has been working with marginalized communities in Phoenix as part of the environmental organization’s efforts to link ecological concerns with public health. This dovetails with the efforts the local public-health authority has been making to depoliticize climate change.\n\nTheir strategy: don’t make it about the environment. Make it about saving lives.\n\nWe’ve had issues with the power, because everyone wants to crank up their A/C … and it’s too much power, so the power falls off,\n\nThe Nature Conservancy (which works in Canada through Nature United) has been holding workshops in Phoenix and asking people how they cope with heat and what they need to cope better.\n\nAt one meeting, Messerschmidt was told: “There’s no power. Sometimes it goes out for hours. Or, it could be minutes. We don’t know how long it’s going to last. We had to make sure to keep our kids and our elderly people safe…But there’s no cool areas in this neighbourhood. The parks, they’re hot because there’s no shade over the playground.”\n\nThis is when Messerschmidt talks about the research they have done on greening and how outdoor spaces can be made cooler so they’ll be more useful during a power outage.\n\n“We’re thinking about nature-based solutions,” she said. “We built a shade structure in the community garden and did some tree plantings at people’s homes.”\n\nThe group also installs green roofs, or if that’s not possible, transforms dark surfaces, which absorb heat, into light ones that reflect it, as a way to combat urban heat islands."
