        "text": "Pierre Elliott Trudeau's final journey home drew hundreds of Canadians who lined the route of his funeral cortge. They waved flags, sang the national anthem and saluted one of Canada's most inspirational and charismatic leaders.\n\nSchools and offices emptied as people in several Ontario and Quebec communities lined the train tracks for a glimpse of history as it passed.\n\nJOIN THE DISCUSSION: Share your thoughts on Pierre Elliott Trudeau\n\nIt was a train that brought Trudeau to Ottawa to win the Liberal party leadership more than 30 years ago. And it was a train that took him home to Montreal.\n\nMany people reached out to touch the side of train No. 638 and to shake hands with Trudeau's sons, Justin and Sacha. The last car, carrying Trudeau's flag-draped coffin, was curtained in black.\n\nMany in the crowd clutched red roses, a signature bloom Trudeau wore in his lapel.\n\nJacques Hebert, one of the few family friends on the train, was moved by the crowds. \"What we have seen today is proof, if we needed proof, that (Trudeau) was very important in the hearts of all Canadians,\" he said.\n\nIn Alexandria, Ont., halfway between Ottawa and Montreal, Trudeau's two sons leaned out and accepted flowers and small flags as the train slowed down.\n\nMontreal bids adieu to native son\n\nThe crowd broke out in French and English renditions of O Canada when the black hearse carrying Trudeau's casket arrived at Montreal's City Hall.\n\nJustin, who frequently broke down on Monday, kissed his father's mahogany coffin. The more composed Sacha gently touched the casket.\n\nCuban President Fidel Castro slipped into City Hall Monday evening to pay his respects to his old friend. Trudeau was the first NATO leader to visit Cuba to the chagrin of the United States.\n\nCastro has declared three days of mourning in Cuba and ordered all flags to fly at half-mast.\n\nRELATED STORY: Montreal prepares for Trudeau's state funeral\n\n<>>\n\n\"I just feel we're alone now, with no one to protect us,\" said one woman with tears in her eyes.\n\nOfficials have promised to try to keep the doors open until everyone in line has said goodbye to Trudeau.\n\nIt was the same overwhelming turnout in Ottawa over the weekend, where two days of public visitation drew more than 60,000 people.\n\nOn Sunday night, the doors to the Hall of Honour where Trudeau lay in state remained open until nearly 4 a.m. so tens of thousands of mourners could bid farewell.\n\nRELATED STORY: Early morning of mourning for Trudeau\n\n<>>\n\nEarlier on Monday, hundreds of people stood in silence as a Guard of Honour brought Trudeau's casket out of the House of Commons and down the steps of Parliament.\n\nTears rolled down Justin Trudeau's face during a final 19-gun salute. A military band played Auld Lang Syne as a black hearse left Parliament Hill. Some people sang the national anthem. Others applauded.\n\nCards and flowers continue to pile up at the Centennial Flame in front of Parliament. It has become a memorial to Trudeau, filled with roses and notes of gratitude.\n\nMargaret Trudeau stopped by the flame Monday to read some of the tributes to her former husband.\n\nIn addition to mourning Trudeau's death, Margaret was reminded that Monday is the birthday of her son, Michel, who died in an avalanche in 1998. He would have been 25.\n\nOvercome by grief, she fell to her knees on the lawn of Parliament Hill, and was led away by family members.\n\nYOUR SPACE: Your Letters on Pierre Elliott Trudeau\n\nBooks of condolence have been opened in government buildings in many cities, including Vancouver, Toronto, Winnipeg, Montreal, and St John's. The federal government has also set up a Web site for messages of sympathy.\n\nWEB LINK: Send a message of condolence via the federal government\n\nTrudeau, who believed passionately in one Canada held together by a strong federal government, was both reviled and revered. But political opponents said he was always respected.\n\nHe led the Liberals from 1968 to 1984, serving as prime minister from 1968 to 1979, and from 1980 to 1984.\n\nHis legacy includes the Official Languages Act and patriation of the Constitution.\n\nPIERRE ELLIOTT TRUDEAU: Defining Moments\n\nWhen he was 52, Trudeau married Margaret Sinclair and they had three sons, Justin, Sacha and Michel, before divorcing in 1984.\n\nA look back A nation mourns The journey home <>>\n\nLast winter, Trudeau was admitted to hospital for more than a week, battling a bout of pneumonia. In early September, his family confirmed he was not well.\n\nTrudeau died of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease at his Montreal home Thursday."
