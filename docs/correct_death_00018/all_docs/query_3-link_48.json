        "text": "Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, led the tributes to Friends actor Matthew Perry, who was found dead in a jacuzzi in his Los Angeles home.\n\n“Matthew Perry’s passing is shocking and saddening,” Mr Trudeau, who went to school with the Hollywood star, said.\n\n“I’ll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them,” he added.\n\n“Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved and you will be missed.”\n\nMr Trudeau and the actor attended Rockcliffe Park Public School, an elementary school in Ottawa, Canada, where Mr Perry once recounted how he “beat up” the future Canadian leader.\n\nOnce one of the biggest television stars in the world, Perry, 54, was discovered after apparently drowning in a hot tub at his home.\n\nIt was reported that Mr Perry had previously played a two-hour game of pickleball at the Riviera Country Club near his home in Pacific Palisades.\n\nSources told entertainment website TMZ that the actor was in good spirits during the game. The website said he was a devotee of the sport and had even created a shrine at his home.\n\nHe was known to have suffered from serious health issues as a result of prescription drug addiction.\n\nAccording to TMZ, on the day he died Mr Perry sent his assistant to collect a new iPhone and a pair of glasses.\n\nTwo hours later the assistant returned and found the actor unresponsive and called the emergency services.\n\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said officers arrived at his £5.5 million mansion at 4.10pm in the afternoon and were investigating his death.\n\n“We responded to the 1800 block of Blue Sail Rd for a death investigation of a male in his fifties,” the force said.\n\nMr Perry played Chandler in all 234 episodes of the iconic sitcom Friends, which ran for 10 series from 1994 to 2004.\n\nFriends transformed his life, catapulting him and his co-stars to fame as it became one of the most successful shows in TV history, paying each of the five stars $1 million (£824,500) per episode by the end of the tenth series.\n\nBut while Mr Perry enjoyed professional success, his personal life was troubled as he battled with addiction to painkillers, which was triggered by a jet ski accident.\n\nHe was hooked on Vicodin, at one point taking 55 pills a day, checking into rehab 15 times.\n\nIn his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, published in November 2022, Mr Perry said he attended 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and underwent stomach surgery 14 times, which he said made his bowels look like “the topography of China”.\n\nOn Sunday, Matthew Perry’s family, friends and fellow celebrities mourned his death.\n\n“Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend,” Perry’s family said in a statement.\n\n“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother,” the family added.\n\nThey thanked his fans by saying: “You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love.”\n\nThe lead co-stars of Friends – Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Courtney Cox – are yet to publicly comment on the passing of their co-star.\n\nMr Perry was three years older than Mr Trudeau but the two knew each other in school.\n\nAppearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2017, Mr Perry recalled beating up Mr Trudeau.\n\n“I was reminded of this by my friend Chris Murray, who was also in the fifth grade in Canada. He reminded me we actually beat up Justin Trudeau.”\n\n“We both beat him up. I think he was excelling in a sport that we weren’t, so it was pure jealousy. And we beat him up.”\n\nThe actor said he was not proud of his behaviour in bullying Mr Trudeau, whose father Pierre, was the Canadian prime minister at the time.\n\nYears later, Mr Trudeau made light of the incident.\n\n“I’ve been giving it some thought, and you know what, who hasn’t wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch?”\n\nOther leading showbusiness figures paid tribute to the Friends star including Paget Brewster, whose character Kathy briefly went out with Chandler in the series.\n\n“He was lovely to me on Friends and every time I saw him in the decades after. Please read his book. It was his legacy to help,” she wrote on Twitter.\n\n“He won’t rest in peace though. He’s already too busy making everyone laugh up there.”"
