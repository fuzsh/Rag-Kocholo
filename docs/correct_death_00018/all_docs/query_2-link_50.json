        "text": "Remaking Canada\n\nPierre Trudeau appeared suddenly on the political horizon, blowing in with\n\nthe exuberant spirit of the 1960s. Not everyone liked this brilliant, enigmatic man,\n\nbut no one was indifferent. Winning his first election as Prime Minister in 1968,\n\nhe set out to remake Canada.\n\nThough generally failing in the economic arena, he had a strong and coherent\n\nsocial vision. He fought for a powerful, centralized state, equality of French and\n\nEnglish as official languages, multiculturalism and social tolerance. His legacy\n\nis crowned by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, enacted in 1982:\n\nthe same year that Canada repatriated the Constitution under his leadership.\n\nThe past is to be respected and acknowledged, but not to be\n\nworshipped. It is our future in which we will find our greatness.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, 1970"
