        "text": "MONTREAL — Fidel Castro paid his respects yesterday to Pierre Trudeau, a man the Cuban president considered a friend, capping an emotional day as the former Canadian premier's body was brought to Montreal by train past thousands of mourners.\n\nEarlier, Trudeau's ex-wife broke down in tears and fell to her knees while visiting tributes to Trudeau at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where his body had been on view for several days.\n\nCastro was greeted by applause by mourners lined up inside Montreal's city hall to view Trudeau's casket. Castro viewed the body, then waved to hundreds of people gathered outside the building, some shouting, \"Viva Castro.\"\n\nCastro planned to attend Trudeau's funeral today in Montreal. Trudeau first visited Cuba as prime minister in 1976 and the two met often since, even after Trudeau left politics.\n\nTrudeau died Thursday at 80, and the country has since been wrapped up in remembering his political legac flamboyant lifestyle.\n\nOver the weekend, an estimated 60,000 people paraded past his coffin at Parliament Hill."
