        "text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he was \"devastated\" to learn of Brian Mulroney's passing.\n\n\"He never stopped working for Canadians, and he always sought to make this country an even better place to call home,\" Trudeau said in a statement Thursday evening. \"I'll never forget the insights he shared with me over the years – he was generous, tireless, and incredibly passionate. As we mourn his passing and keep his family and friends in our thoughts, let us also acknowledge – and celebrate – Mr. Mulroney's role in building the modern, dynamic, and prosperous country we all know today.\"\n\nA life in pictures: Remembering former prime minister Brian Mulroney\n\nDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\nMulroney died Thursday at the age of 84. Mulroney was Canada's 18th prime minister and held the position for the Progressive Conservatives from 1984 to 1993.\n\n\"On behalf of my mother and our family, it is with great sadness we announce the passing of my father,\" his daughter and Ontario MPP and Treasury Board President Caroline Mulroney said on social media. \"He died peacefully, surrounded by family.\"\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told reporters in Toronto that the last time he spoke to Mulroney was six weeks ago after hearing his health had taken a turn for the worse.\n\n\"A husband, a father, a brilliant businessman, a prime minister and a statesman,\" Poilievre said. \"He was the son of an electrician who despite his modest beginnings, rose to extraordinary heights.\"\n\n\"It wasn't electoral success that defined his career. It's what he did with it,\" Poilievre added. \"As prime minister, he unleashed free enterprise, he crushed inflation, he signed one of the most important free trade agreements in the history of the world with the United States of America. On the world stage, he stood firmly on the side of freedom and against communism in the Cold War.\"\n\nPoilievre also brought up Mulroney's work when it came to dealing with South Africa and its apartheid government.\n\n\"Nelson Mandela singled out Brian Mulroney, and by extension all Canadians, for his essential role in applying crippling sanctions against the apartheid regime that helped bring that racist system to an end.\"\n\nWhen asked what advice Mulroney had given him personally, Poilievre said he told him to \"give people hope,\" reminding him of the high inflation rates that Canadians dealt with through the '80s.\n\n\"He said, 'We can turn this around,' and he did. As a result, millions of Canadians had the opportunity to work hard and own a home and live the Canadian dream,\" Poilievre said.\n\nIn a social media post, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he was saddened by the news of Mulroney's passing.\n\n\"He made an important contribution to Canada, including protecting our environment – leading the world in tackling acid rain and banning chemicals that were destroying the ozone layer,\" Singh wrote.\n\n\"He was also a strong opponent of Apartheid, leading the efforts to sanction South Africa by Commonwealth nations.\"\n\nFormer Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien spoke at length about Mulroney from Ottawa Thursday evening.\n\n\"He was prime minister for two long terms and I was an opponent of him all my political career, but in politics, opposition is opposition. It's like playing hockey: you can fight on the ice, but have a beer together after that, and we had a lot of things in common,\" Chretien said of his predecessor. \"He took the Conservative party in very bad shape – you know, they had not been in government since in the thirties – and he built it back. But his greatest success was to break in (to) Quebec.\"\n\nIn a statement released Thursday night on X, formerly known as Twitter, former prime minister Stephen Harper said, \"History will record that Mr. Mulroney's premiership was transformational.\"\n\n\"Prime Minister Mulroney fought to secure the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, from which Canada has benefitted immensely ever since,\" Harper wrote.\n\nHe also brought up Mulroney championing significant international environmental measures, including the Montreal Protocol and the Canada-U.S. Acid Rain Treaty, as well as being the first Canadian Conservative leader to win back-to-back majority mandates since Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\n\"Canada has lost a historic figure, and we mourn his passing with all his many friends and associates,\" he said.\n\nFormer Quebec premier Jean Charest said Mulroney \"was one of the greatest prime ministers\" in Canadian history.\n\n\"He was an exceptional leader. A visionary. And a statesman whose influence had a significant impact on the international stage,\" Charest said on social media. \"I remember him as generous, passionate, and deeply attached to Canada. Our country owes Prime Minister Mulroney a profound debt of gratitude.\"\n\nBloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet called Mulroney a great Quebecer. Writing in French, Blanchet said Mulroney was perhaps the last prime minister to attempt to sincerely reconcile Quebec and Canada.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May described Mulroney as the \"greenest\" prime minister in Canadian history.\n\n\"He was always so very kind and generous as a leader and a friend,\" May wrote on social media. \"Deepest sympathy to the whole family.\"\n\nFormer Ontario premier and current ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae offered condolences to Mulroney's wife and family.\n\n\"When my brother died, Brian Mulroney was the first political leader to call, as he was when I was elected premier in 1990, when I was defeated, and at so many other moments,\" Rae, former federal Liberal MP, posted on social media. \"He was my friend, despite our differences.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Mulroney was a \"giant\" who \"had a way with words like no one else.\"\n\n\"Brian was also so generous with his time,\" the Progressive Conservative wrote. \"When faced with tough decisions, I often leaned on him for advice and benefited from his experience and his political instincts. He was a role model to me and taught me to be a better leader.\n\nFormer MP and interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose recalled Mulroney telephoning her during her \"toughest moment in politics.\"\n\n\"Only two people called me and he was one of them,\" Ambrose wrote in a statement. \"He encouraged me, he told me stories about his tough times, and his kind gesture was forever in my heart. I understood then why people have such incredible loyalty to him.\"\n\nConservative MP John Nater rose in the House of Commons at approximately 6:20 p.m.to speak about Mulroney's death.\n\n\"It is obviously with great regret that this House has learned of the passing of Canada's 18th prime minister, the Right Honourable Martin Brian Mulroney,\" the Ontario MP said. \"Obviously all members join us in wishing the Mulroney family our deepest sympathy at this time as they deal with the loss of this great statesman who has done so much for our country. I join all Canadians in offering our condolences.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters later Thursday evening, Trudeau spoke of Mulroney's guidance during NAFTA renegotiations during the Trump presidency. Mulroney had signed the initial North American Free Trade Agreement in 1992.\n\n\"He was incredibly generous and effective in advising me and our government on the renovation and renegotiation of NAFTA during some very challenging years,\" Trudeau said. \"He was an extraordinary statesman and he will be deeply, deeply missed.\""
