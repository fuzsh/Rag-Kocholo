        "text": "Canada held a state funeral for former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau today, ending five days of national mourning for the flamboyant intellectual who led the country through one of its most tumultuous periods.\n\nThousands lined the streets of Montreal, the largest city in the French-speaking province of Quebec and the hometown of Mr. Trudeau, for the largest state funeral in Canada's history. Many Canadian and foreign dignitaries, including former President Jimmy Carter and President Fidel Castro, attended a Roman Catholic Mass inside the 19th-century Notre-Dame basilica in Montreal's old quarter.\n\nPrime Minister Jean Chretien, a friend and disciple of Mr. Trudeau's, was the first speaker during the two-hour service. The last and most emotional one was Mr. Trudeau's eldest son, Justin, 29, who urged Canadians not to abandon Mr. Trudeau's vision of a Canada unified under its English and French ancestries. That vision elevated Mr. Trudeau above other Canadian politicians, but it has become frayed from the realities of politics and an increasingly restless Quebec.\n\nMr. Trudeau served as prime minister for most of the period from 1968 to 1984. After stepping down, he spoke out on a few memorable occasions against a new generation of political leaders who no longer share his views of Canada.\n\n''He came back to remind us of who we are and what we're all capable of,'' Justin Trudeau said, switching effortlessly between English and French, as his father used to do. ''But he won't be coming back anymore. It's all up to us, all of us, now.''\n\nIn the days since Mr. Trudeau died on Thursday, at 80, after bouts with prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease, a reflective mood has swept much of the country as Canadians weighed his legacy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
