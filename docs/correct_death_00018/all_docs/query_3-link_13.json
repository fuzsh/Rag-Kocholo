        "text": "(1919–2000). Within three years after he first held public office, Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the head of the Canadian government. In April 1968 the bilingual Liberal party leader became Canada’s 15th prime minister.\n\nJoseph Philippe Pierre Ives Elliott Trudeau was born in Montreal, Que., on Oct. 18, 1919, the second of three children. A graduate of Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and the University of Montreal Law School, Trudeau studied political economy at Harvard University, the University of Paris, and the London School of Economics. He also traveled extensively.\n\nIn 1950 Trudeau founded a social-reform magazine called Free City that opposed the Union Nationale regime in Quebec. He wrote several books, including Two Innocents in Red China (published in 1961) and Federalism and the French Canadians (1968).\n\nIn 1952 Trudeau opened a labor-law practice in Montreal. He joined the law faculty of the University of Montreal in 1960. Five years later he was elected to the House of Commons as a “new wave” Liberal. Trudeau was made parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1966 and in 1967 was appointed the minister of justice and attorney general. As minister of justice, Trudeau was successful in passing measures for stricter gun control and the reform of laws against abortion and homosexuality.\n\nAn opponent of Quebec separatism, Trudeau gained the Liberal party leadership on pledges of a “united Canada” and a “free and just society.” He became the third French Canadian prime minister in April 1968, after Pearson retired.\n\nTrudeau’s popularity—particularly with younger voters—was demonstrated when he won a parliamentary majority in the June 1968 general election. He introduced legislation to streamline the government and to promote bilingualism. His government remained in office after an election in October 1972 that was the closest in Canadian history. Although it fell in May 1974 on the issue of rising inflation, Trudeau regained unchallenged control of Parliament in the July election. Throughout the 1970s, however, he was criticized for the country’s increasing economic and domestic problems. The Liberals lost in May 1979, and Joe Clark, leader of the Progressive Conservatives, formed a new government.\n\nIn the election of February 1980, in a stunning political comeback, Trudeau gained his fourth term as prime minister. He achieved his longtime plan to reform Canada’s constitution. Under his leadership, Canada became a fully sovereign state in 1982. Trudeau spent his next two years in office concentrating on gaining greater economic independence for Canada, seeking more international disarmament talks, and improving trade relations with other countries, especially Third World nations. Trudeau announced his decision to retire in early 1984 and officially resigned on June 30 after a new party leader was chosen. Trudeau died on Sept. 28, 2000, in Montreal."
