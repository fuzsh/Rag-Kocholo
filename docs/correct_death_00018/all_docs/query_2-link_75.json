        "text": "June 26, 2024\n\nCanada must readjust its foreign policy to adapt to changing global conditions, and ground that policy in its history. It must be orderly, flexible and in the country’s long-term interests.\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nAs Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces questions about his own political future, it’s worth remembering his father’s famous walk in the snow 40 years ago — and what fuelled his decision to quit.\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nJustin Trudeau has been in power for almost a decade, achieving some of his objectives and stalling on others. What will be his legacy, and is constitutional reform in the cards in the next two years?\n\nAugust 3, 2023\n\nLike everyone whose marriage breaks up, nothing is ever quite the same after. What impact Justin Trudeau’s marital breakup will have on his life and career will be revealed in the months to come.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nQueen Elizabeth harnessed goodwill from Canadians mostly as an individual, rather than as the hereditary head of an institution. But her death will lead to debate about the relevance of the monarchy.\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in Canadian history. His father had invoked its predecessor, the War Measures Act, more than half a century earlier.\n\nNovember 2, 2021\n\nThe constitutional reform agreement reached in November 1981 has produced a bitterness in national relations that lingers to this day and imposes on Canada a cost that has weakened the nation.\n\nAugust 18, 2021\n\nIs Justin Trudeau correct about the importance of this election? Nobody has a crystal ball to foresee what the government will do in the future. But it’s certainly important to Trudeau’s legacy.\n\nJune 10, 2021\n\nHow did a national leader whose animating political spirit was protecting human rights come to adopt a passive acceptance of Canada’s worst face of colonialism?\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\nA new book argues that the War Measures Act was a response to the threat young people posed to authorities.\n\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\nPierre Trudeau’s contribution to the remaking of Canada cannot be questioned. Throughout the 1980 to 1982 constitutional debates, he reminded Canadians of their country’s basic values.\n\nAugust 26, 2020\n\nAn intense controversy over sending Canadian teens to Cuba to cut sugar cane in the 1970s raises questions about why WE Charity’s international development approach hasn’t been controversial for years.\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\nWith COVID-19 radicalizing the already radical presidency of Donald Trump, Canada may be forced to confront its dependence on the U.S. more directly and with greater urgency.\n\nNovember 6, 2019\n\nThere’s a different Trudeau in office in 2019 than there was in 1972, but Justin Trudeau is also leading a minority government, just as his father did — and the Canada-U.S. relationship is key.\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n\nGiven entrenched characteristics of Canadian electoral politics, the 2019 election is unlikely to deal in any meaningful way with concrete solutions to the important problems of our times.\n\nJune 23, 2019\n\nThe ugly turn in Canadian-Cuba relations stemming from Canada’s new visa requirements puts at risk decades of creative, productive connections between Cuban and Canadian people.\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\nThe notwithstanding clause in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms has seldom been used. But it’s not totally gathering dust, and now Ontario Premier Doug Ford is threatening to wield it."
