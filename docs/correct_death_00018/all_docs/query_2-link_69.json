        "text": "Prime Minister of Canada 1968-1979 and 1980-1984\n\nChairman 1995\n\nBrilliant, eloquent, humourous but profound, Trudeau agreed to fill in the vacuum made by the resignation of Chancellor Schmidt as Chair in 1995, on the condition he would serve just one year, overseeing the plenary meeting in Tokyo that was shaken by the death of Takeo Fukuda. He issued no Communiqué from that meeting as he felt that deliberations without Prime Minister Fukuda could not be justified by the Council.\n\nBorn 18 October 1919 in Montréal, Canada. Died 28 September 2000 in Montréal, Canada."
