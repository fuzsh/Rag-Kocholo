        "text": "Before Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, there was Pierre Elliott Trudeau, his father and Canada’s 15th PM.\n\nWith his embracing of the Khalistani elements in Canada, Justin Trudeau ensured that ties with India nosedived. The trigger for the plunging relations was his unsubstantiated claims that India was behind the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nAnd before Justin Trudeau's visit to India, first in 2018 and then in 2023 for the G20 Summit, came his father's.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn January 1971, Pierre Trudeau toured India for five days. He rode a camel, petted a bullock, went up the Ganges and into a locomotive factory and saw the Taj Mahal, wrote Gar Pardy, a Canadian Foreign Service official who served in New Delhi during the visit.\n\nThe bad blood in Indo-Canada ties, in fact, began with Pierre Trudeau.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the Khalistani issue, India’s first nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes too brought in some amount of sourness in the ties.\n\nWHEN AN EXPLOSION STUNNED TRUDEAU SR\n\nThe Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor allowed the use of unenriched uranium to generate nuclear energy. This was beneficial to developing nations, like India, that didn't have enrichment facilities. But by lowering the entry barrier, it also gave access to plutonium, and in turn, nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States and Canada collaborated on India's civil nuclear programme for cheaper nuclear power and the Canadian-Indian Reactor, US or CIRUS nuclear reactor. The CIRUS reactor was commissioned in July 1960 and built under Homi Jehangir Bhabha's leadership with Canadian collaboration.\n\nThen Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said the programme was for peaceful purposes and if India tested a nuclear device, Canada would suspend its nuclear cooperation.\n\nIn 1974, three years after Pierre Trudeau's visit, India detonated a nuclear weapon at their Pokhran test site using plutonium from the CIRUS reactor, according to a Stanford University research paper.\n\nIndia said it was a \"peaceful nuclear explosion\" and didn't violate the terms of the agreement with Canada. But Pierre Trudeau's Canada withdrew all support for India's nuclear energy programme and recalled Canadian officials working on another reactor in India, according to a Columbia University research paper.\n\nA US State Department report in February 1972, which was declassified in 2005, analysed that the terms of the Canada and the US agreements do not explicitly bar the use of the reactors for \"peaceful\" nuclear explosions. “Agreements with both the US and Canada limit the use of the CIRUS reactor to peaceful purposes, but the language of agreements do not preclude 'peaceful' nuclear explosions\", the State Department report said.\n\nBut it took years for the freeze in nuclear ties to melt. In 2010, a Nuclear Cooperation Agreement was signed between the two countries during the visit of PM Manmohan Singh to Canada for the G20 Summit.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the Pokhran nuclear test that soured relations. Pierre Trudeau’s refusal to act against the Khalistani elements was a major blow to Indo-Canadian ties and resulted in the worst terror attack on Canadians.\n\nPIERRE TRUDEAU AND KANISHKA BOMBING\n\n\"Sikhs have been a significant part of the Canadian mosaic since the late 19th century. Their numbers increased dramatically with the mid-1970s changes to the Immigration Act,\" wrote Gar Pardy, a retired Canadian Foreign Service official, in Ottawa Citizen in 2018.\n\nNow, at over 7.7 lakh, Sikhs form about 2 per cent of Canada's total population and are a politically influential community.\n\nThen there were terrorists from Punjab who took refuge in Canada after the crackdown on militancy in the 1980s. One such terrorist was Talwinder Singh Parmar. He fled to Canada after killing two police personnel in Punjab in 1981.\n\nadvertisement\n\nParmar, a member of Khalistani outfit Babbar Khalsa, called for attacks on Indian missions abroad and communal killings.\n\nIndia requested that Parmar be extradited but the government headed by Pierre Trudeau turned down the request. Not only that, even intelligence warnings sent from India went unheeded.\n\nIndia's intelligence agencies sent an urgent message to the Canadian authorities on June 1, 1985, seeking security measures against a possible airplane attack by Khalistani terrorists, according to media reports.\n\nThen it happened. On June 23, 1985, a bomb in two suitcases was set off on Air India Flight 182 (Kanishka), flying from Toronto to UK's London, killing all the 329 passengers on board. Most of those killed were Canadians and the Kanishka bombing remains the worst terrorist attack in Canada's history.\n\nParmar, whom Pierre Trudeau shielded, was the mastermind of the Kanishka bombing. He was killed by police in Punjab in 1992. In June this year, posters honouring Parmar were seen at various locations in Canada.\n\nEveryone arrested for the Kanishka bombing, including Talwinder Singh Parmar, were let off and only one person was convicted. Inderjit Singh Reyat was given a prison term of 15 years. “Canada’s inadequate and inept response to these bombings never met the Indian government’s expectations,” wrote Pardy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPIERRE TRUDEAU AND QUEBEC CRACKDOWN\n\n\"The meek Canadian response to the Khalistani challenge was a frequent target of Indian politicians as far back as 1982, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi complained about it to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,\" wrote Terry Milewski, retired CBC correspondent and author of 'Blood for Blood - Fifty Years of the Global Khalistan Project'.\n\nIn what is nothing but a clear example of Pierre Trudeau’s double standards, though he didn't act against the Khalistani terrorists, his term in office was marked by a crackdown and the defeat of the French separatist movement in Quebec.\n\nThe French-speaking population sought to break away from Canada but Pierre Trudeau oversaw a crackdown against the legitimate democratic movement in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Civil liberties were suspended and troops were moved into Quebec. There were no-holds-barred raids on homes and offices and over 500 people were detained.\n\nJustin Trudeau's policies on Khalistanis reflect his father's. Trudeau Jr has political compulsions too. His government is propped up by the New Democratic Party (NDP) led by Jagmeet Singh.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau lacks the political conviction of his father. Trudeau senior was a lawyer, constitutional scholar and activist. There is no comparison between the two. (Justin) Trudeau is more enamoured by identity politics. It's easy for him to latch onto any little group that wants different treatment,\" Ujjal Dosanjh, a former Canadian minister, tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut because of Canada's patronage, after decades of being invisible, the Khalistani threat is again rearing its head. And, India will never forget the Air India Kanishka bombing.\n\n“Today, Justin Trudeau owns the legacy of the [Kanishka] bombing, no matter what efforts are made to turn the page in Canada’s relationship with India,” wrote Gar Pardy.\n\n(With inputs from Rishabh Sharma)"
