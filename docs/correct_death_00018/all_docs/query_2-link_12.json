        "text": "Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the long-serving Prime Minister of Canada who successfully defended his vision of federalism and a unified nation against the aroused forces of Quebec separatism, died today. He was 80 years old.\n\nHe died of prostate cancer, according to The Associated Press, which quoted Roy Heenan, a senior partner in the Montreal law firm of Heenan Blaikie, where Mr. Trudeau worked.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Trudeau succeeded in altering his country's traditionally staid and fusty image with atypical flamboyance. He was a dashing figure who made his countrymen proud that a Canadian was so highly visible on the world stage.\n\nMr. Trudeau was prime minister for nearly 16 years, serving two spans during the years 1968 to 1984 interrupted by a nine-month hiatus during which his Liberal Party lost its majority to the Conservatives. When, finally, in 1984 he chose to step down after a meditative walk in the snow, he was the longest serving western leader of the postwar era.\n\nHe had been propelled into power in June, 1968, by an enthusiastic electoral surge that came to be known as Trudeaumania, a political equivalent to the gushing paroxysms evoked by the rise of the Beatles. Lyndon Johnson was then in his last year as president of the United States and by the time Mr.Trudeau retired, four more men had occupied the White House.\n\nIn this remarkable span, the second longest tenure of any Canadian Leader after William Lyon Mackenzie King, who held office for nonconsecutive 22 years between 1921 and 1948, Mr. Trudeau determined the substance and tone of the evolving debate that came to define Canada as a modern nation. Long after he left office, Canadian politics were still being pursued within the national agenda he had shaped.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
