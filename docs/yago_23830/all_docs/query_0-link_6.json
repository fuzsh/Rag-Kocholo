        "text": "Using the background of a murder trial, director Henri-Georges Clouzot gives a series of slice-of-life sketches, via flashbacks, detailing a young provincial girl’s adventures in Paris and the eventual murder of her lover and her own suicide. It stars Brigitte Bardot, forced into one of her most dramatic roles.\n\nBardot is a dissatisfied smalltown girl who goes to Paris. Instead of working, she sinks into a Bohemian life and first affairs with intellectual characters. Her sister’s boyfriend falls for her but she is capable of having other affairs while theirs is on. They finally fight and part. But she tries to come back to him.\n\nBardot is her morally blind, pleasure-ridden sexy self in most of the production and is then called on to have big dramatic moments. Though they are mainly outbursts, she seems to have been whipped into shape by Clouzot. She has some savvily done nude and love scenes."
