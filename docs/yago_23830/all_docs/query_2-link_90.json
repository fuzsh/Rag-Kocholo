He contributed to many projects as either the writer, director, producer, or a combination of the three.\n\nHis first feature film was Tout pour l'amour (1933) and as a sole director the first was the 1942 mystery The Murderer Lives at Number 21 (French: L'Assassin Habite au 21), which featured Clouzot as both screenwriter and director.[1] After the release of The Raven (French: Le Corbeau), Clouzot found himself barred from making movies until 1947.[2] Clouzot was later embraced by international critics and audiences following the release of The Wages of Fear (French: Le Salaire de la Peur) and Diabolique (French: Les Diaboliques).[2]"
