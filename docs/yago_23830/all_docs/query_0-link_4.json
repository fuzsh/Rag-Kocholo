        "text": "The Criterion Odyssey\n\nSpine #960\n\nWriter: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Vera Clouzot, Simone Drieu, Jerome Geronimi, Michele Perrein, Christiane Rochefort\n\nDirector: Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nStar: Brigitte Bardot, Sami Frey, Charles Vanel, Paul Meurisse\n\nCinematography: Armand Thirard\n\nDistributor: Kingsley-International Pictures\n\nRelease: November 2, 1960\n\nCountry: France\n\nOkay, here’s the truth.\n\nAfter I finished “La Verite” the first time, I was mightily impressed by what I had just seen, but still felt an overall coldness to the material. What was I missing? From theme to content to visuals, it was everything I could have wanted in this type of film. After a second viewing, things became clearer – this is a work that I greatly admire on an intellectual level, and yet there is nothing in its 130 minutes that emotionally engages me.\n\nBrigitte Bardot stars as Dominique, a woman who shot her sometimes-boyfriend Gilbert (Sami Frey) to death. She claims she went to his apartment to kill herself, and is now on trial. But it isn’t just the specifics of the murder which appear to be on trial – every aspect of Dominique’s lifestyle are brought into the spotlight for judgment by both the jury and, based on the size of the crowd watching, all of Parisian society.\n\nThe film was co-written by Henri-Georges Clouzot (who also directed), Vera Clouzot, Simone Drieu, Jerome Geronimi, Michele Perrein, Christiane Rochefort, and their point of view is clear from the start: while Dominique is on trial in the film, they are putting the restrictive, moral-but-not-humane French society through the same process. The film’s title is translated as “The Truth” and, in a bit of on-the-nose obviousness, the filmmakers are intent on showing that there is no single, simple truth to be had.\n\nWith the above as the filmmakers’ thesis, the easy move, of course, would have been to deify Dominique, turning her into an all-around “good” person who just happens to be young and Bohemian. But director Clouzot has never been interested in good people. Though often, annoyingly, reduced to the title of the French Hitchcock, he is much more insidious in his approach to character. He uses the trappings of other genres, primarily thrillers, but whereas most American genre films have a distinct line between heroes and villains… someone you can easily root for, he takes pleasure in blurring them. In all his best work – “Le Corbeau,” “The Wages of Fear,” “Diabolique” – everyone is guilty.\n\nAnd here is no exception. Dominique is a horrible human being. And yet many of the things that I hate about her as a person are not the things that the hoard of writers have those in the courtroom judge her for… and that is a very important distinction. In doing this, the movie can have it both ways – we can still implicate Dominique in our own minds while also being frustrated by the legal system and rush to judgment by society.\n\nAgain, on an intellectual level, I am so onboard with this. Reading the above paragraphs, “La Verite” sounds like a frickin’ masterpiece, no? Well, here is where the twist comes in: the implementation of those ideas greatly hobbles the film. I was sitting there the whole time thinking “Wow, what a smart idea” instead of just engaging.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this. The first is the structure conjured by the above. We have a flashback showing how something really happened, and then cut to the courtroom to hear the prosecutors’ interpretations of said event. At first it engages, but after the hour mark, this becomes repetitive and hurts the tension mightily. The movie is already long at 130 minutes, but feels much longer, and the above is why. Again, intellectually, I get why the filmmakers did this – poor Dominique must listen to a bunch of interchangeable, judgmental old men narrate her own life, demeaning her consistently, and every time she attempts to argue for herself, her words are waved away. But that didn’t stop me from checking the time on my cell phone with every cut back to court.\n\nAnd then there is Dominique herself. I have no problem with a morally reprehensible character anchoring a film, nor do I take issue with someone of simple motivation being the lead. That said, Dominique is blah. The filmmakers were obviously leaning into Bardot’s personality in the press when creating her character, but aside from her sex appeal, there is nothing of note there. The flashbacks, which were an opportunity to define Dominique or bring her more dimension, fail to bring any type of specificity to her. She likes her sister’s boyfriend, she likes dancing, she likes sex, she likes music, she likes sleeping in… and that’s about it.\n\nAll other attempts at characterization offer only frustration. The most egregious of these is the little book Dominique keeps with her where she has written on every page some variation of “Mrs. Dominique Tellier” (Gilbert’s last name). What are we, in seventh grade here? I get that the filmmakers want us to understand that she is not mature emotionally, but this is ridiculous.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilbert is arguably an even more vile, despicable person but the writers easily succeed in giving him three dimensions. He has wants and needs beyond his desire for Dominique, and every time he makes a horrible choice, the filmmakers give him a monologue so he can explain his motivations for doing what he’s doing. He even gets a better arc… when he’s with Dominique he stagnates in every other aspect of his life, but when they are broken up, he flourishes.\n\nFrey is very good in the role, and shares ample sexual chemistry with Bardot (they had an affair that ultimately ended her marriage during production). And Bardot is fine throughout. Sure, in several early sequences you can see the performance wobble, but she turns in some very good work during the third act. A documentary on the disc features a man who says that Bardot’s work in the second half of the film is some of the best acting ever on film, which is laughable – she’s good and the movie was smart to cast her so they could lean into her persona, but come on now. Reviewers at the time also were kind to Bardot’s performance, but frustratingly gave every bit of credit to Clouzot… almost as if he physically stuck his hand into her and puppeteered the entire thing. Oh, sexism.\n\nBardot and Frey are best in a perfect little scene that is my second favorite of the film. Frey’s Gilbert makes extra money by playing the organ at a local church, and is currently providing the musical backdrop for a wedding when Dominique heads up into the balcony to talk to him. They begin an argument, climaxing with Gilbert losing his cool and stamping his hands against the keys, horror movie style, while everyone at the wedding stares up at them in shock.\n\nThat said, my favorite moment, which perfectly encapsulates the themes Clouzot and his screenwriters were going for, happens in the court. The prosecutor tries to dismiss Dominique’s suicide attempt from years before by reading only part of the physician’s write-up on the incident. The defense attorney corrects him, reading the next several lines of the form, which then casts the incident in a different light. This would be good enough, but then the prosecution grabs the form back and reads further, flipping the script once more.\n\nAnd in case I didn’t make it clear earlier, the movie looks astonishingly beautiful. Clouzot and his regular cinematographer Armand Thirard do wonders with depth in the courtroom, and their interpretation of Paris at night is a wonder to behold. And the restoration and transfer are stunning, thanks to Criterion, Sony, The Film Foundation and RT Features. I actually think that it may look better now than it did when first released.\n\nSo is “La Verite” a success when it comes down to it? Well, yes and no. It has all the hallmarks of classic Clouzot, but failed to engage me like his other films in the collection. Still, it’s definitely worth a watch for the things that do work… but maybe rent it instead of buying.\n\nCover: F. Ron Miller has reimagined the painting from the original poster with a blunt, black background. Jeez, Criterion is sure skewing dark with their covers of late, no? Still, Bardot’s face is fascinating to look at and I like the shock of the red type of the title. It will definitely stand out on store shelves.\n\nI award it four salsa records out of five.\n\nEssay: Ginette Vincendeau provides some great insights into how Clouzot and his co-writers attempted to balance their themes with Dominique’s character. Vincendeau obviously liked the movie more than me (she calls it a masterpiece, which is generous), but we share many of the same opinions on the content, and her writing style is aces.\n\nI award it five understandably bitter sisters out of five.\n\nExtras: Pretty slim pickings.\n\nWe get an hourlong documentary about Clouzot. It purports to look into the darker side of his persona, but the first half in particular feels like nothing but propaganda – with actress Michele Ressi as the only person willing to criticize him (and her words cut straight to the bone). The second half is more balanced as it investigates his late-career creative implosion and his fraying legacy. But in general, this is a beginner’s guide to Clouzot, and if you are a beginner, then you definitely shouldn’t be choosing “La Verite” as your first film from his oeuvre.\n\nA short interview with Clouzot from 1960 about “La Verite” where the interviewer attempts to demean Bardot’s acting ability and Clouzot stands up for her talents. ‘Tis fine.\n\nA section of a longer 1982 documentary on Bardot where she talks about the film. She doesn’t give much insight into her process or Clouzot. I get why Criterion didn’t try to interview Bardot today (what with the racism and everything), but I feel like they could have found a newer interview, or at least one with more insight."
