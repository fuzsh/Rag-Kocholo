        "text": "SAT OCT 19 | 6:45PM | THE RANCH THEATER AT CAC\n\nCatherine Deneuve, playing awfully close to type, stars as Fabienne, a reigning queen of French cinema who has just published her long-awaited memoirs. For the occasion, her daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche) arrives in Paris with her American husband (Ethan Hawke) in tow. There, the long-buried friction between Lumir and her mother’s versions of their lives’ stories erupt into full bloom. Though Hirokazu Kore-eda’s followup to last year’s much-admired (and Palme d’Or-winning) Shoplifters is his first film shot outside of his native country and language, he remains dedicated to excavating the fundamental contradictions that uphold families, the unknowns of the people who know us best."
