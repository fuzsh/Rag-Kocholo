        "text": "Like Rashomon before it, H.G. Clouzot's La Vérité puts subjectivity under the microscope in a tightly controlled courtroom drama that explores the slippery nature of truth. Dominique (Brigitte Bardot) is standing trial for the murder of her former lover, Gilbert, and the judicial process is used as a framing device to relay her story through flashbacks as we, along with the jury, are invited to divine the truth from the hearsay. It's probably down to my own bias against courtroom drama, the artistic potential of which I find inevitably limited by its already dramaturgical nature and the fact that lawyers are essentially actors, but here, it felt particularly intrusive. The flashback sequences, recollections of events leading up to the fatal…\n\n\"You love being touched.\"\n\n- Gilbert Tellier\n\nClearly. And why not?\n\nOK, so let's get this out of the way up front. Brigitte Bardot was absolutely stunning in her heyday, and it's easy to see why she was a huge box office draw. She really is an astonishing on-screen presence. More recently her vitriolic ugly side has been exposed, and while I'll not go into that here, it's clear she has some strong ideals that are not aligned with my own.\n\nRight then, back to the movie.\n\nHow to describe this... I'll go with \"Witness for the Prosecution, au Francaise\". This is like a creamy, dreamy revelation of a movie for me that just screams 60s France. New Wave, yeah...…\n\nA young woman is charged with the murder of an up-and-coming orchestra conductor. At her trial, we learn about her younger life and her relationship with her parents and, particularly, her sister. She’s painted as being shallow, lazy, sulky, lacking in virtues and intensely jealous of her sibling.\n\nWhenever an especially pertinent part of the case is touched upon by the prosecuting counsel, we’re shown it via flashback. Such scenes, I believe, we can take to be the objective truth and they serve as a counterpoint to the rhetoric of the court, embodying the shades of grey that are typically omitted in legal contests.\n\nThe film takes an (appropriately) honest look at people in their late teens/early 20s; their lives,…\n\nI know this is acclaimed but I found this courtroom drama by Clouzot to be a little heavy-handed. The central conceit, a justice system that is uniformly condemning of a woman on trial for murder for her sexually-free lifestyle is not always believable, at least in how its portrayed. It’s clear Clouzot sees this as a metaphor for the hypocritical bourgeoisie’s stance against and fear of young people and especially women who were adopting a devil-may-care rebellious Left Bank culture. It’s just so unrealistic as to what would happen in a courtroom that it detracted from the impact of the theme.\n\nI much preferred the flashbacks that told the story of the woman on trial, Dominique (Brigitte Bardot in a…\n\n\"To judge love, you must be capable of love.\"\n\nSimply one of the best courtroom dramas. Somehow reminds me of Witness for the Prosecution, but La Verite is more serious and bitter. Not only depicted the trial room atmosphere successfully, but La Verite also explores the dark lethal side of suicide and love. We learn about Bardot's character and her past life in the courtroom. Here, she's depicted as lazy, narrow-minded, moody, lack in morals and virtue. Every immoral character, you name it. The positive side about her is she's an out-going person, maybe too much that she'd say yes to every date offer.\n\nBrigitte Bardot was accused of premeditated murder. The focus of the trial is not whether she…\n\nA blistering courtroom drama from Henri-Georges Cluzot (Wages of Fear, Les Diaboliques) and starring a never better Brigitte Bardot, this slow burn tells in flashback not how a promising young composer was murdered - Bardot admits to it in the very first few shots - but why.\n\nFor a very simple and linear narrative structure, the film manages to really get under the skin of our protagonists - Bardot is a bohemian who wants to do nothing and be nothing, all the while railing against modern (for the times) societal norms and structures. Packing the courtroom with aging white man allows the film to place Bardot as a cypher for every single generational issue that had arisen at that time…\n\n“You judge me, but you’ve never lived or loved.”\n\nComing at the beginning of the Nouvelle Vague, Clouzot’s La Verite seems a bit stodgy in comparison to what his younger colleagues were up to, but the courtroom drama has enough going for it to make it a notable achievement for the director’s later period.\n\nThe center of the film is, of course, Bardot’s Dominique and her efforts to reject the conventional lives of her family. Striving to find meaning in bohemian Paris, she steals Gilbert (Sami Frey), the boyfriend of her sister, Annie (Marie-Jose Nat), only for an extremely tempestuous love affair to develop, leading to Gilbert’s murder. The film alternates between flashbacks to the events leading up to Gilbert’s…"
