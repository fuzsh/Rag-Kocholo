        "text": "The stumbling French Netflix remake of “The Wages of Fear,” a 1953 thriller by Henri-Georges Clouzot, whetted my appetite for re-watching that touchstone tale of desperate men taking on a suicidal job, each for his own grim reasons.\n\nBut none of my streaming services have it available. Max has it, I think Criterion restored it and has it on their channel. So I went in search of the second famous version of that classic story, William Friedkin’s epic “Sorcerer,” a 1970s updating that is as bathed in lore as any movie of that era.\n\nFriedkin’s budget-buster opened a month after “Star Wars,” and the Internet is filled with hot-take reviews (many of them “performed” on youtube) about “the best movie you never heard of/saw” and the like. “Sorcerer” exists in a few versions, never got that much attention when it came out, and Friedkin lamented its fate every chance he got, right up to his death last August.\n\nPoking around, I found a full-length cut used on European TV online and dove back into this world. Because if nothing else, “Sorcerer” is a half hour shorter than the original “Wages.”\n\n“Sorcerer” is a film greatly-enhanced in memory by its signature scenes, down-and-out men driving huge, beater ten-wheeled trucks loaded with volatile nitroglycerine over an ancient, rickety rope and wooden plank bridge in the middle of the South American jungle. That iconic image made one helluva poster. I used to own one.\n\nBut the movie’s biggest failing, highlighted by the latest French adaptation, may be relying too much on the structure of the source novel. What we remember is the movie that begins roughly half an hour AFTER Friedkin’s movie’s limited (title and two distributing studios) opening credits.\n\nFriedkin spends a lot of screen time and travel money taking us from Veracruz to Jerusalem to Paris and then downmarket New Jersey to introduce the four men who wind up driving those trucks. One (Francisco Rabal) is an assassin. Another (Amidou) is a survivor of a Palestinian team that blew up an Israeli bus. A third is a French banker (Bruno Cremer) whose life and lifestyle are a fraudulent house of cards he flees rather than take a colleague’s way out — suicide by pistol in his Porsche in the parking lot of a swank restaurant.\n\nNone of these sequences are in English, and none are subtitled. Bad move.\n\nThe fourth character is the wheelman (Roy Scheider) for a low rent Jersey mob, guys who rob Catholic priests counting all their parish’s Sunday offering one ill-advised afternoon. One of those priests happens to be another mobster’s brother.\n\nIt takes over 16 minutes for Friedkin to let us meet our leading man, Scheider, 16 minutes for him to abandon the challenging (you can still follow it) opening episodes that have foreign dialogue and no subtitles translating it.\n\nAnd while those introductions “explain” how these mugs landed some place in the no man’s land of southern Panama/northern Colombia, and contain some action (the bus bombing and man-hunt, the Jersey robbery and botched getaway), those explanations are utterly unnecessary.\n\nAdd in ten minutes of how the distant oil well blows up, the time/cash pressures of “the company” dumped on in-country engineer (Ramon Bieri), and Friedkin has dawdled away a quarter of his movie before getting to anything resembling “the story.”\n\nThis blunder, repeated in the new Netflix version and borrowed from the even longer 1953 French film and thus obviously taken from the novel, strips away the mystery of the anonymous, lost-on-purpose men drinking in a muddy cantina in the middle of nowhere where no one could find them.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot should have watched how B. Traven and John Huston set up “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre” (1948). Don’t over-explain. But if you want to establish that one man’s a killer, one’s a driver and another a bomb maker, let us glimpse their background in tiny doses in flashbacks.\n\n“Sorcerer” truly gets underway with the offer of enough money to maybe escape this hellhole, just for risking your neck for cheapskate capitalists.\n\n“You read about this place in travel brochures?”\n\n“I heard it had a healthy climate.”\n\nThe half-spoiled-by-the-heat-and-damp nitro is selected as the quickest/cheapest way to blow out a wellhead fire. It can’t be transported by helicopter. Too much vibration. “Too dangerous.”\n\nSo…they decide on ancient, beaten to death trucks to cover 218 miles of swamp, mountain and mud roads? As if that won’t be even bumpier? “Sorcerer’s” “Marxist” anti-capitalist theme is expressed in that decision. It’s cheaper to pay locals a pittance to try and survive a trek in barely-running trucks than it would be to do things safely.\n\nThe “driver’s test” comes first, winnowing-out any candidate who isn’t deft at driving a stick and handling a hulking cargo carrier.\n\n“Teamster?” the guy trying to pass himself off as “Juan” something or other (Scheider) is asked.\n\n“Greyhound.”\n\nThe drivers are picked, and there’s a mad scramble to scavenge parts from a long line of rusted-out hulks to get two trucks in shape to make the journey. Not sure how a banker is supposed to know how to work on a gasoline engine (the trucks sound and smoke like diesels), set the valves and whatnot.\n\nThe pencil-thin mustached assassin Nilo (Rabal) is a last minute replacement. And they’re off, facing rain, ruined pigpath roads, roadblocks, natives in open revolt against the government and that signature bridge of despair.\n\nDespite all the “introduction” the characters are given, we don’t really “know” them and the performances have a “just get through this just like this poor sap I’m playing” doggedness.\n\nThe conflicts come from predictable places. The men are rivals, and there isn’t a lot of compassion, because if only one truck or even one driver makes it, he gets everybody’s “share” of the cash on offer.\n\nConsidering how little we ever “know” these guys, why waste all that screen time “starting” their horrific “adventure?”\n\nOne of the most interesting pieces of lore about the film is how that prologue was chopped out and some of the scenes establishing how each man ended up in the jungle were sampled as flashbacks, all of it done by the film’s European distributor without the filmmaker’s knowledge. Friedkin rightly raised hell about that much shorter “International cut,” but that distributor was onto something. That structure works to better effect in many a thriller.\n\nThis isn’t Scheider’s best performance, or for that matter Friedkin’s best film, no matter the degree of difficulty it took to make it.\n\nFilmed mostly in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, the “legend” of “Sorcerer” is that it is a Hollywood “Fitzcarraldo,” an “Apocalypse Now” without Vietnam combat, a masterpiece and an epic undertaking about which we say “They don’t make’em like that any more.”\n\nEvery time I see a digitized automobile flip over a just-ducking Tom Cruise or some other impossible “stunt” created on a computer, I think of “Sorcerer.” That damned bridge was built, with cables tightened and loosened to make trucks teeter to the brink of tumbling off it.\n\nWhile “Wages of Fear” is still considered the greatest man’s man action thriller of them all, I’d say “Sorcerer” has turned out to be more iconic.\n\nWatch any trek-by-vehicle movie and they’re imitating “Sorcerer” more than “Wages of Fear.” Whole “road trips” on TV’s “Top Gear” and “The Grand Tour” have been homages to this film, and other TV shows imitate them imitating “Sorcerer.”\n\nFriedkin insisted on calling this his “greatest film,” in some sort of “Look what they did to my masterpiece” Orson Welles spin. It isn’t. He made “The French Connection,” “To Live and Die in LA,” “Killer Joe” and “The Exorcist,” for Pete’s sake. And he was the one who insisted on those ill-advised opening episides that cripple the picture.\n\nBut “Sorcerer” is still important, iconic and damned suspenseful when it works. Just don’t confuse what’s memorable about it — an image that can summed up in one great poster image — for the movie building up to that, and struggling to an anti-climax after it.\n\nRating: PG, violence, nudity\n\nCast: Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, Amidou and Ramon Bieri.\n\nCredits: Directed by William Friedkin, scripted by Walon Green and William Friedkin, based on a novel by Georges Arnaud.
