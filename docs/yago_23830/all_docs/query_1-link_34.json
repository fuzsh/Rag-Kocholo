        "text": "When I decided to watch La Verite (The Truth), I had no idea what to expect. I couldn’t even remember where or when I got my copy from. It’s just been sitting there for a long, long time, waiting for me to watch it. When the opening credits rolled and Brigitte Bardot’s name came up, I still had no idea what to expect, but I was a little intrigued to see what she was all about. I wasn’t sure what was coming, but I know I definitely did not expect a courtroom procedural to follow. None the less, that’s what I got. Except, what I got was a courtroom procedural like none I’ve ever seen before.\n\nOn trial and called to the witness stand, Dominique (Brigitte Bardot) is being accused of murdering a talented young conductor and composer, Sami Frey as Gilbert Tellier. Her testimony then leads to flashbacks that fill the movie, leading up to the murder.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Dominique, the black sheep of the family, moves into a small Parisian apartment with here goody-goody sister, Annie (Marie-José Nat). Refusing to work or really take any responsibility for her life, Dominique is soon spending her days in a cafes with a group of local ne’er do wells.\n\nInitially pursuing Annie, Gilbert is immediately infatuated with her more exotic and liberated sister. Soon, he too is hanging out with the less desirables and wrestling with his inexplicable attraction to Dominique, while also disapproving of every lifestyle choice she makes. Knowing that he will end up dead, and that Dominique is the prime suspect, means every second that they’re together in the flashbacks is some impressively tense and anxious stuff.\n\nI’m pretty sure this is the first Brigitte Bardot performance I’ve ever seen, and straight away, I got it. I’ve heard of her all my life, but until now, I probably wouldn’t have been able to pick her out of a line up. Now, I know exactly who she is and why she’s an icon. She’s so good in this movie that you totally believe it when Gilbert keeps going back for more, no matter how terribly she treats him.\n\nThe apartment buildings in French movies from this time and earlier always have that same look of romantic dilapidation. The paint is peeling off the walls, to floors and staircases look like too many people have walked on them for them to still be standing, the doors and windows appear to offer absolutely no security from the outside world. Yet these apartment buildings always look like they would be the most amazing, interesting places to live. Watching a movie like La Verite, or Shoot the Piano Player, or Breathless, or The Million, the characters might technically live in near poverty, but I’ll buggered if I’m not just a little jealous of them.\n\nA little melodrama, a little erotic thriller, a little murder mystery, a little French new Wave, all of these little things add up to so much more than the sum of their parts. La Verite pulls off a great trick of basically giving away it’s ending in the first few minutes, but somehow keeps you compelled and guessing for the next two hours. Even without that, Bardot seems like she could make anything compelling and watchable. So the fact the story holds itself together so well is just an added bonus really."
