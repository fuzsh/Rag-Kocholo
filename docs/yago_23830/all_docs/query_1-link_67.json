It begins with a passage from Robert Browning's poem, \"The Pope\": \"What does the world, told a truth, but lie the more.\" The four principals—Courtenay Foote, Myrtle Stedman, Herbert Standing, and Adele Farrington—are presented as both their contemporary characters and their allegorical characters.\n\nWriter-director Lois Weber credited painter Adolphe Faugeron’s La Vérité, or The Truth, as her inspiration for Hypocrites. Interviewed in the 3 Apr 1915 Los Angeles Herald, she said, “From the day that I saw the reproduction of Faugeron’s painting, The Naked Truth [sic], I regretted my inability to teach on the screen the lesson I saw in his painting….Every obstacle we had been taught to avoid in pictures confronted me in the execution of this idea—the introduction of religious subjects, the different and many times double exposures requiring experimentation that would cost time and money, the necessity for an enormous cast, and last but not least, the introduction of the figure of ‘Truth’ in the only guise I could consider if I were to be as honest as Faugeron. Added to which was the fact that we had no permanent studio and were liable to move at any time. As a matter of fact, we did move three times during the making of the picture.” What completed the project was Weber’s casual introduction to seventeen-year-old Margaret Edwards, who possessed an “exceptional education and physical and mental training.” Edwards’ “upbringing” and “purity of mind and unconsciousness of self made her appearance as ‘Truth’ so natural a thing, that her part in the work was the last thing ...\n\nMore Less\n\nThis film is alternately known as The Hypocrites.

We were all so imbued with the spirit of the play that the atmosphere during its entire construction was most reverent and uplifting. As ‘Truth’ was always a visionary figure (since Truth is spiritual), she was photographed alone, with no one present but myself to direct her [and the cameraman], and it shall always be a pleasure for me to remember how earnestly she strove to impersonate the lofty and symbolic character for which I had cast her.” Edwards is always seen as a wraith, created by double exposure.\n\nThe 26 Sep 1914 Motion Picture News noted that Weber and Phillips Smalley, her then husband and frequent collaborator, had completed the filming of Hypocrites, set to be five reels in length. In his Moving Picture World review, Hanford C. Judson also called it a \"five-reel picture.\"\n\nItems in the 10 Oct 1914 and 17 Oct 1914 issues of Motion Picture News cited a 19 Oct 1914 release date. The 10 Oct 1914 Motion Picture News review of the film stated, “The photography in this feature is really wonderful, showing what the expert camera man can do. Not content with double and triple exposure, George W. Hill has produced even sextuple exposure to make this picture more marvelous. In fact, the photography is of such merit that it has been brought favorably to the attention of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, Pa.” The 7 Nov 1914 Variety noted that when the unclothed actress walked toward the camera, “a shadowy trick…does not permit of the nude figure too long in sight at any time.” Cameraman Dal Clawson reportedly invented visual techniques used in the \"Truth\" scenes, which were filmed by George W. Hill.\n\nAs suggested by early reviews of the picture, Weber may have re-edited Hypocrites before it was released two months later. It officially opened on 20 Jan 1915 at the Longacre Theater in New York City. According to the 6 Feb 1915 Motography review of the opening, “It was rumored that if you did not see this Bosworth film on the night of its first showing, you might not have an opportunity thereafter, as [notorious anti-vice activist and former U.S. Postal Inspector] Anthony Comstock was to be one of the evening’s guests and after that—who knows? Mr. Comstock was one of the guests, but the film is still showing and will continue to do so until New York and commuters from Jersey will all have come and seen.” The 13 Feb 1915 Moving Picture World noted that the Longacre run of Hypocrites “created more comment and aroused more enthusiastic press notes than almost any other motion picture yet shown in New York.” After considerable attention by the press and local censorship boards, the nude scene was deemed acceptable in most parts of the country.\n\nHypocrites was re-issued in 1916. A forty-nine-minute copy of the film from the American Film Institute Collection in the Library of Congress is extant and widely available.\n\nLess\n\nGabriel, a pastor, denounces hypocrisy from the pulpit, thus incurring the enmity of his restless modern congregation and one of the church elders, who tells three other older man he wants the pastor's resignation.

When Gabriel’s statue of Truth is unveiled for the monks and local villagers at a festival, only a young female choir singer (clothed as a nun in this period of the film), a fallen woman, and a child are capable of gazing at the Truth; the rest, led by the angry abbot, rush forward and murder him. Gabriel, followed by the naked Truth holding a mirror, watches a campaigning politician, then sees him taking crafty, and later observes a society gathering, which devolves into gambling, drinking, and adultery, and finally a man proposing to a young heiress, but only interested in her money. Finally, Truth holds her mirror up to Gabriel himself, allowing him to see his true self. Gabriel follows her through a set of gates. At that moment, he is found dead in his church after the dream, and only the fallen woman and the choir singer mourn. The next day, the town’s newspaper reveals the parishioners’ shock at finding a newspaper—a sacrilege on the Sabbath—in their dead minister’s lap.\n\nLess"
