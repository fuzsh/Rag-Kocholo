        "text": "Charming, sweet and still very Kore-eda…\n\nI thought the whirlwind of the festival would be over in the current Covid crisis, but with cinemas now opening up here in New Zealand, the annual festival still gives the opportunity to experience film in the cinema. I had a mix of excitement and trepidation when this film was announced. The excitement because Kore-eda is a favourite director of mine for his family dramas that display the complexity of relationships; the trepidation from the change of location and language to France where perhaps his cultural perspective of Japan wouldn’t translate so well to a film that is set in Paris with actors who are not Japanese.\n\nI really should learn to have a lot more faith in Kore-eda’s skills in weaving a story and creating characters that feel real and as flawed as those he creates for Japanese cinema. The premise for this story takes place in Paris where Lumir (Juliette Binoche), her husband Hank (Ethan Hwake) and their daughter Charlotte (Clémentine Grenier) come to visit Lumir’s mother Fabienne (Cathernie Deneuve) an actress who has just published a memoir called ‘La Vérité’ and is current filming a small sci-fi with an up and coming actress Manon (Manon Clavel). It’s in this backdrop that Kore-eda weaves the delicate strands of story, drawing you into this small world where he plays with truth, lies and how they hold lives together.\n\nThat the main languages are French and English are used to an advantage and become an important point. Hank doesn’t speak French, so has to rely on translations from his wife which are not always perfect. This perhaps aligns the audience more with Lumir and Charlotte, subtitles making us bilingual and complicit in conversations he can’t be part of. The script itself was originally written in Japanese and translated by Lea Le Dimna, Kore-eda’s Japanese-French interpreter. That the subtleties of Kore-eda’s work have been captured so clearly is a testament to her skills and her understanding of his work and his methods on set.\n\nOf all the characters, Fabienne is the most fun and quirky and DeNeuve clearly relishes the role with playful glances and witty dialogue. Juliette Binoche’s Lumir is a little more serious and down to earth, her job as a screenwriter contrasting with that of her actor husband Hank who is far easier going. It provides some nice tensions between the two of them, perhaps reflecting the relationship Lumir has with her mother. The daughter Charlotte feels a little like the glue holding the family together, just on the edge of questioning what she is told, she is a point of affection for all the characters and not averse to some innocent exaggerations herself.\n\nThe film within the film is based on ‘Memories of my Mother’ by Chinese author Ken Liu and is about a dying woman who travels into space at the speed of light, returning at intervals to see the daughter grow up and become old. The few scenes that we see remind me a little of ‘After Life’, snapshots of a longer story, brief scripted interactions that makes the main story feel more realistic. It has been a short film once before and Kore-eda selected this and its themes of motherhood, memory and time overlap perfectly with those Kore-eda is writing about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CKk94z4QApY\n\nPerhaps using acting as a way of expressing this might seem a little on the nose but it really is the perfect way of showing off the themes in a way you can observe it happening. It’s not something we think about in our own lives, we are too deep in our own narratives to see it for ourselves. This film provides a step back and shows us, with affection, not judgement, the difference between truth, honesty and memory.\n\nThere is a wonderful interplay between truth and memory through the film, neither of which seems reliable as they are simply angles of an experience through the lens of time. There are the truths that we tell ourselves, ones we tell other people; we can use truth as a way to weaponize our feelings and use it to heal each other. Seeing these perspectives with the medium of film permanently captures moments of emotional truth and untruths, and nothing as bold as an outright lie throughout.\n\nThe Truth (La Verite) is available as VOD during the festival as long as you are New Zealand based with a New Zealand Credit card."
