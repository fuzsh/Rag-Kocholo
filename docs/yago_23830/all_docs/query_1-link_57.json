        "text": "Description\n\nMirroring the political strife and genocide in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa, this film opens as preparations are being made to end a decade of civil war in a fictitious country. A peace agreement is about to be signed and celebrated in a night of reconciliation with a laying down of arms. As the powerful drumming begins, both rebels and government forces gather, bringing with them years of rage, grief, hope, suspicion, and bitterness. In this first feature film, Fanta Régina Nacro boldly presents the sometimes unintentional but inhuman behavior inherent in all people. Also released as La nuit de la vérité. Prince Claus Fund Film Grant, Rotterdam International Film Festival. Best New Screenwriter, San Sebastian International Film Festival, 2004. Nominated for Jury Award, Tribeca Film Festival, 2005. In Dyula, French, and Mooré with English subtitles. Directed by Fanta Régina Nacro. Burkina Faso. Some World Cinema titles may contain mature themes or content. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nLength: 96 minutes\n\nItem#: BVL56825"
