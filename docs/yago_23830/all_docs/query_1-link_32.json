Henri-Georges Clouzot directed the crime thriller. Macario Gómez Quibus is the artist for the poster.\n\nThe poster measures 27.5\" x 39\" and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. The poster was in very good condition prior to restoration with some pinholes around the edges from theatrical display and some minor fold and edge wear. It was folded at the time of printing but the folds are much less noticeable after linen-backing. Linen-backed posters are stored flat and are rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.\n\nPlease look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.\n\nThis very rare and collectible poster, printed in 1970 to promote the initial, Spanish theatrical release of La Vérité, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
