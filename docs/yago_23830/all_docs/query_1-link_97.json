        "text": "Birgitte Bardot’s role of the young and impetuous Dominique Marceau is widely acclaimed as her best performance ever. Dominique’s rash break with her bourgeois background and a series of affairs with young Paris intellectuals ends with the charge of having killed Gilbert, a promising young conductor.\n\nWas it a crime of passion, an act of desperation or simply an accident? Witness statements and the suspect’s account present an increasingly complex image of the relationship between Dominique and Gilbert.\n\nImpulsive\n\nThe Oscar-nominated La vérité, known internationally as The Truth, delves into Dominique’s past and her struggle to find a foothold in the city. Clouzot (Le salaire de la peur, Les diaboliques) paints a perceptive portrait of an impulsive young woman who is misunderstood and mistreated by those around her. As such, La vérité levels harsh criticism against a hypocritical and moralistic society.\n\n4K restoration by Sony Pictures Entertainment, in partnership with The Film Foundation and RT Features."
