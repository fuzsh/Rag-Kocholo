        "text": "A UN Women programme to strengthen dialogue and ensure women’s meaningful participation in Syria’s future.\n\nThe Issue | Our Solutions | Partners | News & Stories | Publications & Guiding Documents\n\nThe Issue\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict in Syria, Syrian women have been pushing for a Syrian owned and led inclusive political solution to a protracted conflict that has entered its 11th year. In the face of continued crisis, Syrian women continue to exercise leadership roles across the country and in the UN-led political process. They have made vital contributions in humanitarian assistance and peacemaking efforts, healthcare and education — serving as breadwinners of their families, as humanitarian first responders, leaders in displacement camps, and as peacebuilders.\n\nTo date, the Syrian crisis has left nearly 12 million people in the country requiring urgent humanitarian assistance, 4 million dependent on cross-border aid, 5.7 million forced to flee and reside as refugees far from home, along with an additional 6.6 million people displaced inside the country. The conflict has disproportionately impacted Syrian women and girls. Of those who need humanitarian aid, half are women and girls. Syrian women have higher rates of poverty than men; they face increased risk of gender-based violence; and they shoulder the responsibility of caring for their children and other family members.\n\nCurrent context\n\nGlobally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a spike in violence against women in the midst of lockdowns and quarantine measures, while women and girls, particularly refugee women, have found their livelihoods threatened. Women are taking on extra burdens of unpaid care work, while 70% of healthcare workers are women, adding to the immense pressure women are facing in the current context. In Syria, the COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the risks and hardships for millions of people inside the country and for refugees around the region. In response, Syrian women have swiftly engaged in humanitarian and awareness-raising activities, with some joining the UN Special Envoy for Syria and others to urge a nationwide ceasefire.\n\nDespite their leadership across the country, Syrian women continue to face challenges in political life. Although there have been positive gains in recent past—including the inclusion of nearly 30% women in the Constitutional Committee, amendments to the Personal Status Law, increased participation in training and skills development activities, and a rise in female entrepreneurship in the country since the beginning of the conflict—women’s direct participation in the high-level political efforts and the percentage of women in parliament continue to remain disappointingly low and discriminatory legislations still exist.\n\nOur Solutions\n\nBuilding and leveraging the influence of women as peace actors and decision-makers is critical in working for a just future for Syria. Women leaders and women’s civil society, including those supported by UN Women, have continuously advocated for the meaningful participation of women and inclusion of gender perspectives in the political process since the early days of the crisis.\n\nIMPACT OF COVID-19\n\nAlthough lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel have posed significant challenges to the participation of the WAB in the ongoing political process, continued to meet in over 30 virtual sessions, engaging with high-level UN officials, the EU, Member States, and other stakeholders in 2020\n\nThe WAB has also continued to provide advice to the Special Envoy, through a mixture of virtual and in-person meetings, and their inputs have often been acknowledged in his briefings to the Security Council and others.\n\nIn support of Syria’s political process under Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and in line with the UN Security Council's landmark resolution 1325 (2000), which enshrines the essential role of women in securing and maintaining peace, UN Women has been bolstering Syrian women’s leadership in peace-making since 2013. This has included support to the Office of the Special Envoy (OSE) for Syria, strategic engagement and logistical, technical, translation and interpretation support to the work of the Women’s Advisory Board (WAB) in close collaboration with the OSE, as well as support to Syrian civil society. UN Women further engages in international coordination and research on gender equality and women’s rights in the context of Syria’s political process.\n\nPartners\n\nThese efforts are implemented in close collaboration with the Office of the Special Envoy for Syria, the broader Department of Political and Peacekeeping Affairs (DPPA), with the generous support of the European Union (EU) and the Governments of Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nNews and Stories\n\nLearn more:\n\nFrom where I stand: Monira Hwaijeh\n\nVideo: Meet members of the Women’s Advisory Board: Asma Kaftaro | Noubhar Moustafa | Munira Hawyjeh\n\nSyrian women’s peace efforts: Crucial yet unrecognized\n\nVideo: Women on the Frontlines of Conflict Resolution: Syria\n\nCrisis update: Women of Syria, eight years into the crisis\n\nThe second UN-EU conference on Supporting the future of Syria and the region starts in Brussels\n\n“It Takes a Woman” to build peace in Syria\n\nWomen of Syria, a strong constituency for peace\n\nPress Release: Syrian Women's Advisory Board shares experience in exploring solutions for peace\n\nA snapshot of UN Women’s work in response to the crisis in Syria\n\nSyrian women rise above differences and forge a statement of unity\n\nStatement by UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka on the establishment of the Syrian Women’s Advisory Board to contribute to peace talks\n\nConference of Syrian women, convened by UN Women and the Netherlands, ends with strong recommendations for upcoming peace talks\n\nVideo: Women of Syria: An appeal for peace\n\nPromoting Syrian Women’s Engagement in the Syrian Political Process\n\nStatement: “The inclusion of women and gender equality must be an integral part of any political solution and transitional arrangements for Syria” – Executive Director\n\nPublications & Guiding Documents\n\nEighteen Years on: Assessing the Implementation of the UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security Agenda in the Arab States Region\n\nWomen on the Frontlines of Conflict Resolution: Community Voices from Syria, Iraq and Yemen\n\nDocuments guiding the inclusion of women in the UN-led political process:"
