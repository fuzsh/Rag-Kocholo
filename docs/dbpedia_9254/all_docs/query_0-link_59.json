        "text": "Known for pop music hits like “Potential Breakup Song,” Aly and AJ recently released songs “Sanctuary” and “Slow Dancing.” Now, these artists have an appearance slated for 2022’s Governor’s Ball music festival. In addition to being musicians, Aly and AJ are actually sisters with a close sibling relationship.\n\nAly and AJ are known for their Disney Channel stardom and ‘Potential Breakup Song’\n\nThe sibling duo Amanda and Alyson Michalka, known as Aly and AJ, rose in popularity with their 2007 album, Insomniatic. Between Disney Channel original shows, clips of songs like “Potential Breakup Song” and “Like Woah” played on the television network.\n\nTen years later, the artists returned with their EP, Sanctuary, and an explicit version of the “Potential Breakup Song.” They also debuted A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun, earning millions of Spotify streams in the process.\n\nAly and AJ are actually sisters\n\nAly and AJ have different personalities, but these artists are sisters. Alyson Renae Michalka was born on March 25, 1989. Amanda Joy (AJ) Michalka was born on April 10, 1991. In 2022, Aly turns 33 years old and AJ turns 31.\n\nAly and AJ’s zodiac sun sign is Aries. That also makes the Michalka sisters about 33 years old in 2022. Although they are proud sisters, sometimes these artists joke with fans about their sibling relationship.\n\nThese artists wouldn’t be the only set of siblings who rose in popularity from Disney Channel, as Dylan and Cole Sprouse starred in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\n\nBrothers Nick, Joe, and Kevin Jonas appeared as the boy band named the Jonas Brothers, eventually starring in the Disney Channel series Jonas. Aly and AJ have since taken a step back from Disney to focus on other acting projects and their music created under the same band name — Aly and AJ.\n\nAly and AJ released ‘A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun’ in 2021\n\nIn 2021, the artists premiered their fourth studio album, A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun. When it came to “Sanctuary,” the artists simultaneously worked on acting-related projects — Aly stars in CW’s iZombie, while AJ leads ABC’s Schooled, a spinoff of The Goldbergs.\n\n“We weren’t able to be with each other as much as we would have in the past,” Aly said during an interview with Rolling Stone. “We had to be open to the idea of not having the security of each other being in the room at the same time, which we rely on a lot.”\n\nRecently, Aly and AJ released their single, “Dead on the Beach,” introducing a new, country-inspired sound to their repertoire. Additionally, the sister duo is slated to perform at New York City’s Governor’s Ball music festival in 2022."
