        "text": "James Cronin is content for rugby to be at the kernel of any conversation or more specifically that any focus relates to his exploits on the pitch rather than sideline issues, so to speak.\n\nFor the last month or so injury, sustained against Leinster in a Guinness Pro12 match, and contractual conjecture, thrust him front and centre into the media spotlight.\n\nHe proved his fitness for Munster initially and on Sunday should get an opportunity to win a third cap for Ireland if sprung from the bench during the Six Nations Championship match against Wales.\n\nThis comes on foot of agreeing a new three-year contract with Munster after the initial indications were that he would sign for London Irish. The 25-year-old loosehead prop offered an insight into what’s been a tumultuous few weeks.\n\n“Well I was in talks [with other clubs], Munster then got back onto me the day they found out and put a good offer on the table.\n\n“I was happy then so I took it. If there’s big offers out there then you’re going to have a look. It’s natural. But I was happy enough to sign for Munster for three years. If you’re playing well in any sport you’re going to be wanted and luckily for me I was wanted at home.”\n\nJoe Schmidt has been in regular contact since he picked up the injury. The initial prognosis was three to four weeks, something that the player conveyed to the Irish coach. He was named in the extended Ireland squad and last weekend proved his fitness in a Pro12 game against Benetton Treviso.\n\n“I knew I needed game time and Joe rang me (last) Wednesday (week) to say he was sending me back (to Munster) and I had no issues because I believe they had a horrible enough fitness session at the Aviva on Friday; so I was happy enough to play 60 at the club.”\n\nIt removed any lingering doubts in relation to his fitness. There were no concerns in terms of his form. “I’m pretty happy with how my season’s going. Up until the Leinster game I thought my form was pretty good.\n\n\"The club was happy with me, Anthony Foley was happy with me and the feedback I got from Joe and the rest of the coaches they're all pretty happy with how I'm going. I wouldn't be here otherwise.\"\n\nHaving made his Ireland debut on the 2014 summer tour to Argentina and won a second cap against Italy in last season's Six Nations, the Corkman is looking forward to a chance of running out in the green jersey at the Aviva stadium.\n\n“It is very exciting, my first home international. It is all new to me even going up to the Shelbourne (hotel, where the team are based for the two nights prior to a match and the night of the game).\n\n“I am really concentrating on the game. I am fortunate enough to have two caps for Ireland. If selected, there will be a big crowd coming up.”"
