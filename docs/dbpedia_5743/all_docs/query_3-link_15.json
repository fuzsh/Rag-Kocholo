Kent Professorship in Life Sciences #3\n\nSEE Division\n\nPhD: Florida State University, 1991\n\nPhone: 225-578-7218\n\nLab Phone: 225-578-7221\n\nOffice: A306 Life Sciences Annex\n\nLab: A359/A361 Life Sciences Annex\n\nE-mail: jcronin@lsu.edu\n\ncronin lab\n\nArea of Interest\n\nMy research interests center on the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions. This stems from both an applied interest in the biological control of plant pests by natural enemies and a theoretical interest in the behavior, population dynamics and persistence of species comprising ecological communities. In my research program, I advocate a spatial approach to understanding these trophic interactions.\n\nMy current research interests focus on four broad areas\n\nBiogeography of plant invasions. I am particularly interested in the factors that influence invasion success over broad-geographic and temporal spatial scales. My research focuses on the invasive grass, Phragmites australis. We have explored the effects of latitude, natural enemies (i.e., herbivores, pathogens), higher trophic levels, soil microorganisms, plant genetics (ploidy, genome size, and genotypic variation), plant defensive chemistry, and climate change on invasion success and interactions with other members of the recipient community. More details about this research can be found by clicking here.\n\nCauses for predator-prey population cycles. Understanding the mechanisms promoting stability of predator-prey interactions has been a longstanding interest of mine. I have been studying a model system involving the cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus) and its parasitoid (Anisopteromalus calandrae) that is known to exhibit outbreak cycles in the laboratory. My colleagues and I have been performing experiments to test the underlying causes of these outbreak cycles. Specifically, we are interested in whether changes in the age structure of the prey (specifically, the duration and variability of prey development time) affect predator-prey population cycles and stability (for more details, click here).\n\nDensity-dependent dispersal and population dynamics. Dispersal can have major consequences for individual fitness, population dynamics, and species’ distributions. Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal at both the patch and landscape levels is vital for population management and conservation. The paradigmatic view of dispersal is that it becomes more frequent as density increases. However, the pattern of density-dependent dispersal can take many forms. My colleagues and I are using mathematical models and experiments to assess how different forms of dispersal can affect population dynamics and stability of competing species and predators and their prey.

My primary study system includes the planthopper Prokelisia crocea and its egg parasitoid Anagrus columbi that coexist among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass in the tallgrass prairies of North Dakota. My students and I have experimentally examined how cordgrass patch and landscape structure influenced host and parasitoid foraging and dispersal behavior, extinction risk, and population dynamics. My colleagues and I have also developed behavior-based landscape-level models to understand the effects of habitat heterogeneity on the population dynamics of interacting species. Offshoots of this work involved the effects of invasive exotic plants on the population dynamics of native fauna, and the use of stepping stones and corridors in promoting connectivity among habitat fragments. More details on this research project can be found by clicking here.\n\nFire history and oak-cynipid community structure. Along with my old friend and former postdoc advisor, Warren Abrahamson, we are studying the effects of time-since-fire on cynipid gall wasp community structure. Our work is being conducted at Archbold Biological Station in central Florida. More details on this research project can be found by clicking here.\n\nRoseau cane (Phragmites australis) Dieback in the Mississippi River Delta. This is a multi-departmental collaboration among scientists at LSU that focuses on the widespread die-offs of Roseau cane (Phragmites australis) in the Mississippi River Delta. Our team is exploring the effects of multiple stressors (e.g., invasive scale insects, soil toxins, plant pathogens and climate change) on the health of this plant species. More details on this research project can be found by clicking here.\n\nI welcome inquiries from prospective graduate students interested in research opportunities in my laboratory. Possible areas of study include all aspects of plant-insect interactions, insect predator-prey interactions, spatial and landscape ecology, invasion biology, and conservation biology.\n\nSelected Publications\n\ncomplete publications list\n\nHarms, N.
