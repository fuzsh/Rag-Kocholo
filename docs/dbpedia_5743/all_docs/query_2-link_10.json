James has keen interests in the roles metabolism and the immune system play in disease progression. In particular, James’ group focuses on the aberrant cell signalling pathways that lead to chronic inflammatory diseases and resistance to chemotherapy in cancer.",

        "text": "PM-249 Human Immunology\n\nThe course is designed as an introduction to immunology and the human immune system. The course covers the fundamentals of immunology including functional perturbations associated with disease and experimental approaches to the study of immunology.\n\nPM-280 Skills for Researchers\n\nThe modern scientist graduate is expected to have gained extensive laboratory-based experience and this is certainly essential for any student intent on pursuing a research-based career. Skills for Researchers provides students with the opportunity to acquire the core skills to be able to conduct, analyse, interpret and present scientific experiments. A proportion of the module will be spent in the laboratory gaining hands-on experience. Skills acquired in this module will form the basis for future experimental work, including the final year project. Students will have the opportunity to provide feedback to peers and engage with a variety of online learning materials.\n\nPM-280C Sgiliau i Ymchwilwyr\n\nDisgwylir i'r myfyriwr gwyddonol modern graddedig ennill profiad helaeth mewn labordy ac mae hyn yn sicr yn hanfodol i unrhyw fyfyriwr sy'n bwriadu dilyn gyrfa yn seiliedig ar ymchwil. Mae Sgiliau i Ymchwilwyr yn rhoi cyfle i fyfyrwyr gaffael y sgiliau craidd i allu cynnal, dadansoddi, dehongli a chyflwyno arbrofion gwyddonol. Bydd cyfran fawr o'r modiwl yn cael ei wario yn y labordy yn ennill profiad ymarferol. Bydd sgiliau a gaffaelir yn y modiwl hwn yn sail ar gyfer gwaith arbrofol yn y dyfodol, gan gynnwys prosiect y flwyddyn olaf. Bydd myfyrwyr yn cael cyfle i roi adborth i gyfoedion ac ymgysylltu ag amrywiaeth o ddeunyddiau dysgu ar-lein.\n\nPM-300 Medical Genetics\n\nThe course is designed to provide an advanced study of the identification of human genes and the determination of the influence of human genes upon disease and health status. Gene identification provides targets for the development of new pharmaceuticals and the range of variation present in the population.\n\nPM-344 Capstone Project\n\nThe aim of this module is to provide a capstone experience to students¿ learning, through participating in their own enquiry-based research project, with guidance from an academic supervisor. The project may be laboratory or non-laboratory based, but it will always involve a research question that is drawn from the literature, and focused on a topic relevant to the life sciences. It will ask a research question and involve the critical analysis of research findings. Students will refine their oral and written communication skills to a graduate level through an oral presentation and dissertation on their research findings and conclusions.\n\nPM-347 Human Immunopathology\n\nThe module aims to provide students with a greater understanding of the human immune system and the causes of a range of diseases associated with immune dysfunction including autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders and neurological conditions.\n\nPM-378 Biomedical Laboratory Techniques\n\nThe module will provide practical and in depth theory of applications and equipment available to MSci students in the biomedical research laboratories based at the Medical School. The module will provide guidelines and rationale for experimental design, and data and statistical analysis.\n\nPM-378C Technegau Labordy Biofeddygol\n\nBydd y modiwl yn darparu damcaniaeth ymarferol a manwl o¿r cymwysiadau ac offer sydd ar gael i fyfyrwyr MSci yn y labordai ymchwil biofeddygol sydd wedi'u lleoli yn yr Ysgol Feddygaeth. Bydd y modiwl yn darparu canllawiau a rhesymeg ar gyfer cynlluniau arbrofol, a dadansoddiad data ac ystadegau.\n\nPMGM14 Cancer Genomics\n\nThis module covers the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer development, growth and metastasis, and the differences between different cancers. It will explore the different molecular and cellular actions of anti-cancer treatments, the genomic factors affecting response and resistance to treatment, and the research approaches to anti-cancer drug design and development. Broad situations which confer a high cancer risk to a person and/or to other members of the same family will be discussed in the context of how genomic information may be integrated into cancer screening programmes. This module will prepare the students to interrogate the cancer data sets from the 100,000 Genomes Project as well as to interrogate cancer genomic datasets in general.\n\nPMGM23 Cancer Genomics\n\nThis module covers the molecular mechanisms that underlie cancer development, growth and metastasis, and the differences between different cancers. It will explore the different molecular and cellular actions of anti-cancer treatments, the genomic factors affecting response and resistance to treatment, and the research approaches to anti-cancer drug design and development. Broad situations which confer a high cancer risk to a person and/or to other members of the same family will be discussed in the context of how genomic information may be integrated into cancer screening programmes. This module will also prepare the students to interrogate and interpret various cancer data sets.\n\nPMNM11 Nanomedicines, pharmaceuticals and advanced therapeutics\n\nThis module will explore the history and development of molecular medicines and pharmaceuticals, providing the basis for an advanced understanding of next generation therapeutic approaches. Using landmark technology and chemical development phases informed by separation science and mass spectrometry, the module uses an application driven approach to provide the student with an extensive knowledgebase of drug development, the pharmaceutical industry and nanotherapeutics. Students will be able to characterize and map the path of a drug from administration, to metabolism and elimination, and critically evaluate drug design and delivery approaches. Traditional small chemical entities used in molecular medicine will be outlined, using drugs such as taxols and tamoxifen as exemplars. Common target oncology and non-oncology disorders will provide the context; with students encouraged to explore targeted nanoparticle fabrication, drug encapsulation and release profiling, from early first generation drugs such as Abraxane to second generation biologically targeted SMART delivery systems. Future molecular medicines such as antibody drug conjugates and kinase inhibitors will be taught by guest lectures from industry and clinicians, covering the spectrum of drug development to delivery and clinical considerations.\n\nPMZM15 Nanomedicines and Therapeutics\n\nThe module will explore the history and development of molecular medicines. Using landmark technology and chemical development phases, the traditional small chemical entities using in molecular medicine will be outlined, using drugs such as taxols and tamoxifen as exemplars. The common target oncology and non oncology disorders will outlined and their respective targets for such medicines detailed alongside drug modes of action and delivery (IV and oral). Further exploration of targeted nanoparticle delivery, from early first generation drugs such as Abraxane to second generation biologically targeted SMART delivery systems, will expand the knowledge to future molecular medicines such as antibody drug conjugates and kinase inhibitors. Excitingly the module will include guest lectures from industry and clinicians, covering the spectrum of drug development to delivery and clinical considerations."
