        "text": "RESEARCH\n\nAlthough I have interests in all areas of ecology and evolution, research in my lab primarily centers on the interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. In particular, I am interested in how habitat fragmentation and features of the landscape influence the movement behavior, spatial distributions, and temporal dynamics of herbivore and natural enemy populations. My research in this area has led to important insights regarding predator foraging theory, the stability and persistence of predator-prey interactions, and the development of effective corridors for threatened and endangered species.\n\nCurrent Research Projects\n\nPast Research Projects"
