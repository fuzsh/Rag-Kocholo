        "text": "My work ethic and dedication started long before I ever played water polo. I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was in the 1st grade. I always had to work harder in school than my peers. I took that dedication to learn to read with me when I play water polo. My career in water polo began in the 8th grade at the local summer pool where I had been swimming. I started in the field that first summer until our goalie got injured. I volunteered to be the goalie and that is when I found my position. I practice and play for the West Suburban Water Polo club in the summers and fall. I swim for my high school team in the winter (JV my freshman and sophomore year and Varsity my junior year). I was the starting varsity goalie my sophomore year. This opportunity made me more of a team leader. My sophomore year we finished 19-11-1 and were ranked 20th in the State of Illinois. That year really improved my skills. That summer I made the 16U Junior Olympic team for the West Suburban Water Polo club. This team took third in the Midwest qualifier and competed in the Gold division of the Junior Olympics in San Jose California. I just completed my Junior year. Our team finished 19-9 and ranked #17 in the State. I made the All Sectional 2nd team and was the highest ranked goalie. My save percentage was 55.3% and I had 25 save game which is the 2nd most in State history."
