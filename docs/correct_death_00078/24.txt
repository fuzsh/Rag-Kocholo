Sir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815 - 6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada. He served from 1867-1873, and again from 1878-1891.

His time in office saw the expansion of Canada from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts; the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway; the creation of Canada's first spy service, the Western Frontier Constabulary, its first federal police force, the Dominion Police, and the famed North-West Mounted Police; and he began the slow transformation of the Canadian Militia into an organised force. Macdonald was the dominant force behind the British North America Act and Canadian Confederation.

While Macdonald supported suffrage for women and the Aboriginal people of Canada, he disagreed with extending the vote to people of Chinese descent because of what he perceived as irreconcilable cultural differences. Modern criticism has been raised over his role in designing and passing restrictive legislation pertaining to the Indigenous population of Canada, the implementation of the Residential School system, as well as his role in ending the Red River and North-West Rebellions.
