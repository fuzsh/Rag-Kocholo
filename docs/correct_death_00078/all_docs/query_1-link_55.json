Macdonald by the Rt. Hon. Brian Mulroney”, MacDonald and Laurier Days.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION\n\nMacdonald’s family came to Canada from Scotland when he was only five years old. They settled in Kingston, Upper Canada. Kingston, in the 1820s, with a population of 3,000, was one of the most important settlements in Upper Canada and had the best schools available in the area. At fifteen, Macdonald left school to start his legal training in the law office of a prominent Kingston lawyer, George Mackenzie and, at the age of twenty, became qualified to practice as a lawyer and opened his own law office. He had a successful law practice before entering politics, initially at the municipal level. Shortly after his political debut, Macdonald ran as a representative for Kingston for the Legislative Assembly in 1844 and won.\n\nAn early painting of Sir John A.

No. 1960-123-1, C-004811\n\nFAMILY LIFE\n\nIn 1843, Macdonald met and married his first wife, a cousin named Isabella Clark. The marriage was happy at first, but became Macdonald's greatest source of grief after his bride developed a debilitating, mysterious illness. The disease would ebb and flow for the better part of 13 years, and eventually claim her life. Their first child, John Alexander, died tragically after 13 months. Their second son, Hugh John Macdonald, would go on to become premier of Manitoba.\n\nPortrait of Isabelle Clark Macdonald - 1852, 1852, From the collection of: Canadian Heritage\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nPortrait of Isabelle Clark Macdonald, by William Sawyer, 1852\n\n\"Macdonald was a charismatic leader and a dedicated politician. His political rise was swift. He was a moderate conservative during a time when provincial politics were very unstable and parliamentary gridlock led to frequent elections.\"\n\nEARLY POLITICAL LIFE\n\nIn 1844 John Alexander Macdonald became the elected member for Kingston in the Legislative Assembly of Canada (Ontario and Quebec), beginning a distinguished 47-year political career during which he would become the first prime minister of Canada in 1867.\n\nIn this context Macdonald's political views proved cautious; he defended the imperial prerogative and state support of denominational education, and opposed the abolition of primogeniture (which stipulated that when a property owner died without leaving a will, his eldest son would inherit everything). Above all, he emerged as a shrewd political tactician who believed in the pursuit of practical goals by practical means.\n\n(The Canadian Encyclopedia)\n\nDaguerreotype portrait of John A. Macdonald cased in a gold locket, From the collection of: Canadian Heritage\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThis is a daguerreotype portrait of John A. Macdonald cased in a gold locket which was possibly carried by Macdonald himself. The locket also contains portraits of his first wife Isabella and his son Hugh John, both copied from oil paintings. When this portrait was made, John Alexander Macdonald was the newly elected member for Kingston in the Legislative Assembly of Canada (Ontario and Quebec), just beginning a distinguished 47-year political career during which he would become the first prime minister of Canada in 1867.\n\nCredit: Library and Archives Canada, Acc. No. 1968-086 / PA-121571\n\nTHE CONFERENCES AND CONFEDERATION\n\nMacdonald is often seen as the principle architect of Confederation, having drafted 50 of the 72 resolutions that established the framework for a united Canada. He was also one of the leading speakers in favour of the union at all three Confederation conferences (Charlottetown, Québec and London). He used persuasion and compromise to get the delegates to agree on the terms of Confederation. Together, Sir John–who was knighted for his role-and Sir George-Étienne Cartier made the case for Confederation that resulted in the birth of a nation.\n\nCanada's Fathers of Confederation, From the collection of: Canadian Heritage\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFathers of Confederation at Fanningbank, Lieutenant Governor's residence Credit: George P.

Macdonald is remembered for his role in the expansion of Canada’s boundaries from sea to sea, the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the creation of the North-West Mounted Police, and the development of a National Policy that levied high tariffs on imported goods to shield Canadian manufacturers from American competition.\n\nSir Sam Steele - RCMP, From the collection of: Canadian Heritage\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nSir Sam Steele: A great frontier hero, Mounted Policeman, and soldier of the Queen.

He died on June 6, 1891, soon after winning his fourth election.\n\nPacific Express, From the collection of: Canadian Heritage\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nMembers of the train crew pose with a westbound Pacific Express, at the first crossing of the Illecillewaet River near Glacier, B.C., 1886.

Confederation, the CPR, and the protective tariff were not his ideas, but he was brilliant and tenacious in achieving his goals once convinced of their necessity. As a politician he early developed shrewdness and ingenuity. […] He was particularly concerned with maintaining the British connection to Canada, including the tradition of parliamentary supremacy, against the threat of American economic and political influences, such as the doctrine of constitutional supremacy.

MACDONALD TODAY\n\nMonuments, tributes, schools, bridges, roads and an airport have all been built or named to honour the life and legacy of Sir John A. Macdonald. In addition, every year on the anniversary of his birth—January 11—Canadians mark Sir John A. Macdonald day. It is a day not only to learn more about this extraordinary man’s role in building our country, but to reflect on the fact that from the very beginning, Canada was a vision built through coalition and conciliation.
