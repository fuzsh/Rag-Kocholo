        "text": "Article content\n\nIt is doubtful that official Ottawa will ever see a replay of the emotional events that unfolded 125 years ago this week as Sir John A. Macdonald passed into history at Earnscliffe.\n\nLate on the evening of June 5, 1891 the night before Macdonald’s passing, the doctors released a statement. The end was near. MPs were quickly informed. It fell to the Old Chieftain’s comrade, Sir Hector Langevin, to share the news in the chamber.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

News we have had from Earnscliffe is that the first minister has had a relapse and that he is in a most critical condition. We have had reports from medical men and they do not seem to believe that he can live many hours more.”\n\nA reporter, his name now lost to history, later described the scene over the next 24 hours at Earnscliffe.\n\n“Members of the family gathered about the bedside of the dying statesman, waiting patiently for dissolution … The patient lay unconscious. Nature no longer asserted itself; life’s fires burning low, flicked and smouldered as though the soul would leave its tenement at each successive break. No would recognize in the dying man one vestige of resemblance to the great political leader who had guided the destinies of Canada for nearly half a century.\n\n“At 10 o’clock it was evident that the end was near at hand … At 10:15 death came peacefully to the aged Premier. He was unconscious to the last.”\n\nSir John A.’s funeral was held at St. Alban’s Church on King Edward Avenue. But this service came after MPs paid tribute to the fallen prime minister in the only venue that truly mattered to him: the political arena as represented by the Commons.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn the afternoon of June 8, the walls of the chamber were draped in black. On Macdonald’s desk were white roses and carnations, placed carefully on a special cushion which bore the simple words “Our Chief.”\n\nIt fell to Sir John A.’s opponent, Wilfrid Laurier, to find the words that would help define the first prime minister before history.\n\n“It is almost impossible to convince the unwilling mind,” Laurier said, “that it is true, that Sir John Macdonald is no more, that the chair which we now see vacant shall remain for ever vacant … As to his statesmanship, it is written in the history of Canada. It may be said without any exaggeration whatever, that the life of Sir John Macdonald, from the date he entered Parliament, is the history of Canada.\n\n“Before the grave of him who, above all, was the Father of Confederation,” Laurier concluded, “let not grief be barren grief; but let grief be coupled with the resolution, the determination that the work in which the Liberals and Conservatives, in which (George) Brown and Macdonald united, shall not perish, but that though a united Canada may be deprived of the services of her greatest men, still Canada shall and will live.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn recent years it has become a simplistic cottage industry to attack and demean Macdonald. Sir Wilfrid Laurier University has ordered that his statue be removed from their campus; protesters in Macdonald’s home community of Kingston have burnt him in effigy and the Chief Justice of Canada’s Supreme Court has been publicly contemptuous of him from the safety of her non-elected perch.\n\nBut what these revisionists cannot take away from Macdonald of Kingston is the fact, and just as Laurier predicted, the resolution and determination of Canadians, as personified by Sir John A. has indeed lived on.\n\nOne-hundred-and-twenty-five-years after his death, no one can deny Sir John A. his greatest legacy: Canada itself.\n\nArthur Milnes is the co-editor of Canada Transformed: The Speeches of Sir John A. Macdonald. His next book, Canada Always: The Defining Speeches of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, will be published by McClelland and Stewart later this year.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
