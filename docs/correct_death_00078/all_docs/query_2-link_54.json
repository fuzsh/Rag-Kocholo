    "text": "John Allen MacDonald Sr., of Shaftsbury, Vermont, passed away on December 18, 2016 after living a full and happy life. He was 89.John was born in Marlboro, Vermont, son to Wallace MacDonald and Effie Moore MacDonald on April 2, 1927. After his father's death, when John was still an infant, his mother moved the family to the Moore family farm in Island Pond, Vermont, located in the Northeast Kingdom, where John spent his childhood. The Moore family farm became his \"roots,\" and has remained a special place to John throughout his life. He graduated from Brighton High School in Island Pond, Vermont, and thereafter enlisted in the Air Force during World War II.After serving in the Air Force, John went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at the University of Vermont, finishing his degree at New York University. John had a successful career working in research and development, manufacturing, sales, and management for several companies retiring from BP Corporation. He spent a large portion of his career developing innovative applications for Teflon heat shrinkable roll covers for the paper industry and fluoropolymer linings used in chemical processing for petroleum, drug and chemical industries, and was awarded patents for his work in that field. He was highly regarded by those that he worked with in the industry for his knowledge, honesty, and integrity.Above all else, John was a family man. He was introduced to his wife, Allison, on a blind date set up by his college roommate and close friend Frank Chapman, who is Allison's first cousin. John and Allison were married for 64 years and she was the love of his life. John's love for his family was unconditional and came without judgement. He was universally loved by his family, friends, peers, and all who came to know him well. His unique smile was his hallmark. He loved to laugh, was kind, genuine, and lived life without pretense. He instilled in his sons important values including \"don't judge a man until you've walked in his shoes.\" He was filled with both love and pride for his grandchildren, and was adored by them in return. His leadership, values, and love can never be replaced, but he will live on in our memories forever.John is preceded in death by his mother and father, Wallace and Effie MacDonald, and his two sisters, Irene and Patricia.John is survived by his wife Allison of Shaftsbury, VT, his sons John A.
