    "text": "At Confederation, Canada was a small country of approximately 4 million people comprised of what’s now southern Ontario and southern Quebec plus Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The purchase of Rupert’s Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1870 and the entry of British Columbia into Confederation a year later increased Canada’s land mass tenfold; its Indigenous population similarly grew from an estimated 20,000 to 100,000. Macdonald’s plan was to turn Canada into a mighty nation befitting its new size by welcoming settlers from Europe and elsewhere to farm the largely empty Prairies. To do this would require a railway and the co-operation of the native people.\n\nTo the south lay the powerful United States. With a population ten times Canada’s and better transportation links (including the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and a vast and growing web of railways), the U.S. had opened much of its western lands to settlement before Canada even existed. The westward progress of this unorganized torrent of trappers, Buffalo hunters, goldminers, farmers, ranchers, sheepherders, merchants and assorted other fortune seekers was far from peaceful.\n\nBy and large, American settlers entered Indigenous lands ahead of any formal government presence and without negotiation with the original inhabitants. What treaties were signed between native tribes and the government were often abrogated as soon as it was in the best interest of white settlers to do so. Forced migrations, as authorized by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, further contributed to the dislocation and grievous harm experienced by native Americans. The Trail of Tears, for example, uprooted 16,000 mostly Cherokee natives from Georgia and relocated them to Oklahoma, an area with an entirely different climate and geography. This process – what might be considered a “settlement first, negotiation second” approach – inevitably led to conflict and war.\n\nIn 1890, as part of its regular census of the native population, the U.S. Congress requested a calculation of all lives lost in the more than 40 individual wars between Indigenous tribes and American settlers or government troops since signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The government’s best estimate for this hundred-year period put the death toll at 45,000 natives and 20,000 white soldiers and settlers. A more recent academic study using advanced statistical methods raises the native death toll to 60,000.\n\nLooking only at conflicts in the American West between 1850 and 1890 – the period most relevant to the settling of Canada’s Prairies – the Encyclopedia of Indian Wars calculates that 6,600 whites and 15,000 natives were killed or wounded in battles during this four-decade span. It should be noted that the above figures do not include the loss of life caused by government policies carried out at gunpoint outside of war. The Trail of Tears, for example, is estimated to have caused 4,000 to 8,000 native deaths, an astounding casualty rate of 25-50 percent.\n\nStanding in stark and, from the Canadian perspective, greatly uplifting contrast to these appalling figures is a companion document to the 1890 U.S. Congress report, concerning the Canadian experience. Significantly, it makes no mention of any death toll arising from “Indian Wars” in this country. This was not an oversight. Since the British conquest of New France in 1761, there were no significant wars in what is now Canada prior to the Riel Rebellion of 1885. And this solitary armed conflict was a Métis uprising notable for its lack of large-scale native participation; the First Nation death toll from the entire conflagration was no more than a few dozen.\n\nSuch a long and, it must be said, happy period of peaceful relations between Indigenous and white populations in Canada was largely the result of British policy that sought to make and keep treaties with native communities. Recall that one of the American Revolution’s underlying causes was the British colonial government’s determination to prevent white settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, a commitment made in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The British approach is best characterized as “negotiation first, settlement second.”\n\nAs Canada’s first prime minister, Macdonald was extremely proud of this legacy of peaceful co-operation and co-habitation. And he was determined to maintain such a policy while overseeing the settlement of Canada’s West. In 1870 Macdonald sent the Rev. Jean-Baptiste Thibault as his emissary to natives throughout the former Hudson’s Bay Company lands. Thibault’s instructions (see page 45) clearly reflect his Conservative government’s fervent desire to avoid an American-style invasion of the Prairies:"
