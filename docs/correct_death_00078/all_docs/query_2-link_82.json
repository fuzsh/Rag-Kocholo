    "text": "John A. Macdonald (1815-1891) began his political career in 1843 as a city alderman. The next year, the by then well-known lawyer handily won election as Kingston’s Member of Parliament. Just two years earlier, the Act of Union had joined the two provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, naming them Canada East and Canada West, respectively. Macdonald was a member of the Legislative Assembly when in 1844 the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Affairs of Indians in Canada submitted its report. Mandated in October 1842 by Sir Charles Bagot, then governor general of the Province of Canada, the Commission held 15 months of hearings. The resulting voluminous document, known to historians as the “Bagot Report,” recommended “that the true and only practicable policy of the Government” was “to endeavor, gradually, to raise the Tribes within the British Territory to the level of their white neighbours; to protect them to undertake the offices and duties of citizens.”\n\nThe story of Sir John A. Macdonald and the First Nations is both very complex and very large. The contradictions of his Indian policy include his ruthless repressive measures immediately after the unrest of 1885, when his administration ruled the North-West Territories as a police state. Deliberately his government withheld food rations to force uncooperative Plains First Nations to move onto reserves. In contrast, in 1885 Macdonald extended the federal franchise to adult male Indians in Central and Eastern Canada if they met the property requirement, without obliging them to give up their Indian status. Peter E. Jones, MD (Queen’s), the third son of Peter Jones, served in 1885 as chief of the Mississaugas of New Credit. He congratulated the prime minister on the granting of the vote: “My Dear Sir John, – I should have written to you some time ago to thank you for making the Indian a ‘person’ in the Franchise Bill … I now thank you on the part of the memory of my father and on the part of myself, as for many years we advocated and urged this step as the one most likely to elevate the aborigines to the position more approaching the independence of the whites.” Macdonald wanted the male First Nations who met the property qualifications to become involved and have some influence on the laws and policies that affected them. Macdonald took a much milder approach in Central Canada than he did toward the First Nations on the Plains.\n\nOnly about 15,000 North American Indians were living in the Union of the Canadas in the early 1850s, representing less than 1 percent of the total population of approximately 2 million. The non-Indigenous population outnumbered the self-identified Indigenous by over a hundred to one. Many British colonists expected the Indians to disappear. For example, as the young Sandford Fleming, later to become known worldwide as the inventor of standard time, wrote in his diary in 1845, “They are dying away every year and it is supposed their race will soon be extinct.” The pressure on their remaining lands became intense. Lord Bury, who served as the superintendent general of Indian Affairs in 1855, noted how the British Canadian settlers “forcibly squat upon their lands and plunder their timber.”\n\nIn office as Attorney General of Canada West, Macdonald in at least one instance worked for recognition of a First Nations treaty right. Just a month and a half after the passage of the crucially important Gradual Civilization Act in June 1857, he gave his legal opinion of Treaty Twenty-Two, the British agreement of 1820 with the Mississauga for their three small reserves at Twelve Mile (Bronte) Creek, Sixteen Mile (Oakville) Creek, and the Credit River (the southern and northern sections of the Credit Reserve). When consulted that summer, Macdonald stated that these lands were not an outright purchase, but instead a surrender in trust to the government, and consequently, “The profits of the land until sold, and the amount of money received on sale of any portion of it must be expended for the benefit of the Indians, according to the terms of the Trust, as specified in such deed.” Thanks to his intervention to protect their revenues from an 1820 trust agreement, Macdonald would have some creditability in this Anishinaabe community.\n\nMacdonald’s only real Indigenous contact before entering politics had been with the Mohawk community of Tyendinaga located on the Bay of Quinte between Belleville and Kingston. The young lawyer first met the Tyendinaga Mohawk in the winter of 1832-33 after his employer sent his legal apprentice to set up a branch law office in the village of Napanee, 50 kilometres west of Kingston. One of his earliest acquaintances was a Tyendinaga Mohawk culturally unrepresentative of his community. John Culbertson was the son of a Scottish fur trader and a daughter of John Deserontyon, the founder of the Iroquois settlement on the Bay of Quinte. John Culbertson’s wife was non-Indigenous, the daughter of a British Loyalist family. In 1836 the entrepreneurial Culbertson, totally fluent in English, convinced the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada to give him approximately 800 acres of the Mohawk Tract, thus using his knowledge of his mother’s culture and language for personal enrichment. Without paying a cent Culbertson obtained from the colonial authorities a huge portion of his people’s land for personal speculation. He then proceeded to have village lots surveyed for sale at a village site for non-Indigenous settlers, naming it “Deseronto” after his grandfather.\n\nIn 1839 Macdonald, then 24 years old, represented a Tyendinaga Mohawk named Brandt Brandt in a murder trial. John Culbertson acted as his Mohawk interpreter. In his cross-examination in the Kingston courtroom, the young lawyer cleverly extracted an important admission from the Crown’s principal witness: the murder occurred in a darkened house when everyone was drunk, which made it impossible to be certain who held the knife used in the murder. The Kingston Chronicle described Macdonald’s defence as “ingenious.” Although the jury ruled manslaughter, the judge only imposed a six-month sentence on Brandt. No evidence exists that Macdonald had any further significant contact with Indigenous people from the 1840s to the mid-1850s.\n\nNamed attorney general of Canada West in 1854, John A. Macdonald continued his ascent of the top rungs of the ladder of Canadian political power. As the First Nations comprised only a tiny proportion of the total population–and did not have the vote–Macdonald paid them little attention. An indication of Macdonald’s relative indifference to the First Nations was noted by Sarah Taekema in her 2020 M.A. thesis for the University of Victoria, “Sir John A. Macdonald’s Influence on the Development of Canadian Indigenous Policy, 1844-1876” (page 89). As attorney general for Canada West Macdonald had great influence in making appointments. In early 1855 he had wanted fellow Conservative John Langton to take over the Indian Department, but Langton, who wanted a senior financial post, turned down the offer. Instead, he accepted to become the new chair of the Board of Audit. Attorney General Macdonald understood and wrote him on 6 February 1855 to say he was “worthy of a better office than settling the quarrels of demoralized Redmen, with still more demoralized Whites.”\n\nTwo years later, in the spring of 1857, the member from Kingston rose in the Canadian Assembly then sitting in Toronto to introduce one of the most important bills in the history of Canadian Indian policy, the Act for the Gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in the Canadas. The legislature, which alternated between Quebec City and Toronto in the 1850s, was then in Toronto. The Parliament Buildings of the Union of the Canadas dominated the waterfront between “John” and “Simcoe” Streets, both named after John Graves Simcoe, Upper Canada’s first lieutenant governor, and founder of Fort York in 1793. The three undistinguished looking redbrick Georgian buildings stood in a wide-open space that fronted on Toronto Bay. Today thousands pass daily by and through the small park that now stands on the site of the legislature, immediately to the east of the headquarters of Canada’s national English-language broadcaster, the CBC, totally unaware of the creation on this site of the first consolidated Indian Act."
