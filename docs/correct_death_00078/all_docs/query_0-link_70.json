While proceeding towards her destination through a terrible gale, the engine suddenly stopped. The captain was suspicious that one of the ropes of the rigging had become wound around the wheel thus preventing its operation. An examination substantiated the captain’s suspicions. To remove the obstruction was a problem in the heavy gale, and boisterious seas. A staging was erected over the stern of the vessel, and with the aid of torches, the rope was cut off after eight hours of tedious labour, and the vessel with her cargo, safely reached port.\n\nMarine Review, April 18, 1895.

While the searchers wore looking for the body of Lorn Thom, a young boy who was drowned in the river that morning, a thirteeen- year-old girl named Alice Wood who had a sister by drowning at Almonte a year ago, and had herd of this method of locating a body, brought a loaf of bread to the men who were grappling for the body and told them to cast the bread on the water and follow it until it stopped. This they did. The loaf of bread floated downstream, while the littfe girl knelt on the shore and prayed for success. After going 200 yards the loaf circled six times and then sank. The body was exactly underneath the spot where the loaf stopped and was immediately brought to the surface.\n\nThe Lanark Era\n\nLanark, Ontario, Canada • Wed, Apr 29, 1908Page 1\n\nAmong beliefs current among sailors in our own country is the notion that it is unlucky to turn a loaf upside down after helping oneself from it, the idea being that for every loaf so turned a ship will be wrecked. It is said that if a loaf parts in the hand while being cut it bodes dissention in the family—the separation of man and wife. Again, it has long been a widespread belief that the whereabouts of a drowned body may be ascertained by floating a loaf of bread down stream, when it will stop over the spot where the body is.\n\nA curious account of the body thus recovered near Hull appeared some years back in the Gentleman’s Magazine: “After diligent search in the river had been made for the child, to no purpose, a two-penny loaf with a quantity of quicksilver [mercury] put in it, was set floating from the place where the child was supposed to have fallen in, which steered its way down the river upward of a half a mile, when, the body happening to lie on the contrary side of the river, the loaf suddenly tacked about and swam across the river, and gradually sank near the child, when both the child and the loaf were brought up with the grapplers ready for the purpose.”\n\nA correspondent of Notes and Queries maintains that it is a scientific fact that a loaf and quicksilver indicates the position of the body, as the weighted loaf is carried by the current just as the body is. This practice, too, prevails on the continent; and Germany the name of the drowned person is inscribed on the piece of bread, while in France loaves consecrated to St. Nicholas, with a lighted wax taper in them, have generally been employed for that purpose.—Notes and Queries.\n\n— Weekly Expositor, vol.

He weighed 230 pounds. He was half way across the river when he took the seizure and sank in 15 feet of water. John Drummond, son of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Drummond, and Ken Williams, son of Mr. and Mrs. Omar Williams, went to his rescue and although they are both only 12 years of age, they dragged him to the shore.

What if we all suddenly were told the exact date and means of our deaths? While this is, of course, impossible, careful consideration of this hypothetical scenario can shed light on our motivations as individuals and societies – and hint at how to best spend our limited time on this Earth.\n\nThis is the second story I have found that someone almost died and then a few years later they passed away. The first story happened in Carleton Place.. read-A Carleton Place Tale to Send Shivers Up Your Arm — The Sad Tale of Margaret Violet King\n\nOnce again , they need to be remembered……\n\nAlmonte-May 4,1928\n\nA remarkable escape from drowning was the experience on Sunday afternoon of little Hubert Horton, aged two years and eight months, son of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Horton.\n\nPlaying with his sister Mary, three and a half years of age, on the bank of the river on the Island opposite the home of his grandfather, M r. Thomas Proctor, little Hubert slipped off a rock into the swollen waters of the Mississippi.\n\nHis sister tried to pull him out but she could not reach him and she ran sobbing to tell her parents of the accident.This all took time as she passed by her paternal grandfather’s home, the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Albert W. Horton, the child’s cries attracted their attention, and Albert Junior, the young man who has become well known as the goaltender of the Almonte Hockey Club, managed, between the sobs of the youngster, to grasp the story that his little nephew had fallen into the river.\n\nAlbert rushed to the spot and saw Hubert’s hat floating above the water about thIrty-five feet from the shore. He is a strong swimmer and throwing off his coat and boots he dived into the water and soon reached the child.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. A. A. Metcalfe, the nearest physician, had been summoned and as he reached the place Albert Horton had just succeeded in landing the drowning boy. The latter had been about fifteen minutes In the water. The child was taken into his grandfather’s home, but it was two hours before he was brought back to consciousness.\n\nIt was Monday night before he was able to be tak en to his own home. He is now thoroughly recovered. Undoubtedly what saved the little boy’s life was that he was wearing a heavy winter coat, which acted like an air bladder for a time. Fortunately the long rubber boots which he wore, were kicked off in his struggles, or they would no doubt have weighed him down.\n\nIt is curious that his father, Kenneth Horton, had a somewhat similar escape from drowning when he was a child. He was rescued from the river by Mr. Newton. The rescue on Sunday afternoon by Albert H Horton was a particularly fine bit of work! At this season of the year the waters of the river are treacherous and cold and he was severely handicapped with his clothes.\n\nSo what happened to young Hubert Horton? He passed away 4 years later from extensive burns from a fire.\n\nHubert James Horton\n\nSHARE\n\nHORTON, Edward Arthur (Ted) – In hospital, Ottawa, Ontario on Monday, August 24, 1987, Edward Arthur (Ted) Horton, in his 57th year.

The boy had secured permission to attend the Star theatre and was returning from there at about five o’clock, accompanied by a playmate Jackie Harper, when the fatal accident occurred. The boys when last seen before the accident were playing with a kitten on the lawn before the Bates & Innis mill.\n\nAccording to the story of Jackie Harper the boys, when passing over the bridge became interested in the water plunging over the stop-log at the edge of the bridge. Boy like, they scrambled into the railing and watched the water take the drop. Intensely interested David leaned over the edge of the railing just a little too far and losing his balance fell into the seething waters.\n\nJackie, alarmed at seeing his comrades’ predicament ran to Mr. Alexander McDiarmid’s for help which was immediately secured but not before the lad was drowned. The body was recovered in less than fifteen minutes.\n\nDavid George was the second son of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Warren. Mr. Warren, who is a traveller for the Mount Forest Carriage Co. was at the time of the accident at the firm’s headquarters in Mount Forest. He received word of the death at 6.30 and by 6.45 was motoring to Toronto where he took the train arriving here early Sunday morning.\n\nAlso read-Clippings of the Robertson Warren Family — Gail McDowell\n\nThe funeral was held on Monday afternoon from the home of the child’s parents to the 8th line cemetery, Ramsay.

J. Warren of Carleton Pl. Dead\n\nWell known Sportsman Passes After Brief Illness of Pneumonia\n\nWilliam J. Warren died on Monday at his home in Carleton Place after being ill only a few days. He had been under the doctor’s care for some weeks but his case was not considered serious and a rapid recovery was looked forward to. However, a few days ago he caught a cold that is so prevalent and when he developed pneumonia his strength failed him and he gradually grew weaker until he passed away. He was the son of the late James and Mrs Warren and was born in Carleton Place in 1883. He was one of the best known sportsman in the Ottawa Valley and his keenest delight was in horse racing. During the Old Home Week in Carleton Place in 1924 he was placed in charge of horse racing and it was due to his untiring efforts and his keen wisdom and fairness that the event was such a huge success. He was a familiar figure in baseball and hockey and dearly loved both games. For any years he was a member of the executive of both these branches of sport and during all the years he was a member he never missed a meeting, unless unavoidably absent from town. For many years he was the representative for the Mount Forest Carriage Company and in the performance of his duties he travelled from coast to coast. Of a very jovial disposition he had a host of friends both at home and abroad and it has been said that he one of the best known and most popular travellers on the road. In politics he was an ardent supporter of the Liberal-Conservative party and he will be greatly missed the local councils. In religion he was a devout member of Memorial Park Church and was always active in church work. In the political sphere, in sports, in fraternal circles and in all things pertaining to the welfare of the town, his death had made a void that will be hard to fill. He leaves to mourn his widow, three sons and one daughter, a little boy was accidentally drowned in the Mississippi river a few years ago.

Bates and J.A. Innes took over the woolen mill built by Archibald McArthur in 1871. Located on a man made island in the Mississippi River in Carleton Place, this 4 story stone mill had several owners before they purchased it in 1907. It was built of rubble wall construction – with exterior and interior walls of one foot thick limestone blocks with another foot of gravel between. The turbine wheels are still visible today, mounted on free standing timbers outside the stone walls to prevent the end of the mill from being shaken and damaged.\n\nOur calendar features several well known Bates and Innes logos – they were famous for their “OV Brand”, (Ottawa Valley), “Pure Wool Underwear, Weight and Warmth for the Out-of-Doors Man”.\n\nIt also advertises “Velvoknit – Distinguished for its Softness and Fineness”.\n\nDuring World War One, the firm was busy meeting military needs for blankets, underwear, cloth and knitted puttees. They were the first mill in Canada to use flat-lock seams on heavy rib combinations.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the mill ran night and day in all departments, providing military blankets, underwear, puttees and and a long run on a 40 ounce knitted duffle cloth, with water proofing treatment that was used in naval pea jackets. The wheeling yarn department turned out tens of thousands of pounds of yarn for the Canadian Red Cross to be hand knit by the women of Canada into warm socks, mitts and sweaters for the men overseas.\n\nBates and Innes ceased operations in 1963, due, in part, to the introduction of synthetic fibres. The property is currently for sale and awaits a buyer with vision to restore and operate this historical building.\n\nCarleton Place and Beckwith Heritage Museum\n\nRemembering local Almonte Scouts — Jack Lyons and Harold McGrath\n\nPosted on by\n\nAlmonte Gazette May 1950\n\nThe Mississippi River once again exacted its grim toll, when two care-free boys, Jack Lyons age 15 and Harold McGrath, age 14 drowned in its icy waters about 4.30 p.m. on Saturday. Both were members of a Boy Scout patrol which had gone up the river to Andrews’ Point where they planned to spend the night.\n\nThe purpose of the trip was to try tests for proficiency badges. In the group were Assistant Scoutmaster Peter Griffin; Patrol Leader, John Graham; Troop Leader, Donald Pink; Patrol Leader, Billy Ritchie, and Scouts Jerry Sinett, Lenis Davey, Jack Lyons and Harold McGrath.\n\nAbout 4.30, the boys entered an aluminum canoe and crossed the river up stream. They were soon lost to sight and there was no other boat at the camp a t the time. Both boys were thoroughly familiar with the river but when they did not return for supper at 7 p.m., concern was felt for their safety. A little later, John Graham returned to camp in a skiff with an outboard motor and he and Mr. Griffin set out to search the upper river.\n\nThey found the empty canoe at the second inlet and realized that the boys were lost. O.P.C. Donald Osborne was notified by telephone at 9 p.m. and at 9.10 the fire siren sounded and 15 boats carrying some 50 men and boys started up river. The search went on all night and at 7.55, Sunday morning, the bodies were found a few feet apart and about 60 feet from shore about half a mile above camp.\n\nO.P.C. Scott of Perth was in charge of the dragging operations. On hand when the bodies were found was John Lyons, father of Jack Lyons and he assisted in the hardest task that he will probably ever have to do—that of helping to lift the lifeless body of his son into the boat.

When found the light aluminum craft was floating in an upright position. There is some difference of opinion, as to whether it would right itself if it had capsized. The fact that two pairs of rubber boots were in the canoe when it was found would lend credence to the theory that the craft didn’t turn over.\n\nIt may be that one boy lost his balance and was thrown out and the other jumped in to save him. There were no witnesses to the accident and no one will ever know exactly what happened.

Wilson, 14-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. W. Scott Wilson of the eighth line of Ramsay, was accidentally drowned today while wading in the Mississippi river at Glen Isle. With another teen-age companion, Robert Rivington, young Wilson, a poor swimmer, was wading in the river when he fell into an eight-foot hole in the river bottom.\n\nRivington, who (managed to reach shore, sounded the alarm and John Cram of Glen Isle and Elmer Reid went out in a boat. After a search Cram managed to recover the body, but by then it had been in the water about two hours. Dr. A. Downing, coroner of Carleton Place, ordered the removal of the body to the Combs funeral home, Almonte. His parents moved to the district 18 months ago from the West, where they had farmed.\n\n1942, Thursday July 16, The Almonte Gazette, front page\n\nGlen Isle Scene Of Sad Fatality Ramsay Boy Drowned While Swimming In Mississippi River\n\nRobert G. Wilson, 14, son of Mr and Mrs W. Scott Wilson of the 8th line of Ramsay, was drowned Sunday afternoon while swimming in the bay at Glen Isle, about two miles from Carleton Place. The youth, accompanied by a neighbour, Robert Rivington, of approximately the same age, was wading into the river when he stepped into a hole and sank out of sight. The Wilson boy was a fair swimmer and it is thought he got excited when he suddenly found himself in deep water. He is said to have gone down three times.\n\nThe Rivington lad held his footing and got safely ashore. He immediately went for aid but it was some time before he found anyone. John Cram and Elmer Reid, both of Glen Isle, guided by Rivington, rowed to the spot where the Wilson boy went down but it was almost two hours before the body was recovered. Artificial respiration was applied but when Corner Albert Downing, Carleton Place, arrived he pronounced life extinct.\n\nRobert Wilson was born in Watson, Sask., and moved here with the family some years ago. He was popular at the High School in Almonte where he was in attendance. He is survived by his parents and a brother and sister, Lennox and Kathleen. The funeral, which was largely attended took place Tuesday afternoon from the family home to the Auld Kirk Cemetery, with Rev W.J. Scott of Bethany United Church, Almonte conducting the service. Six young friends of deceased acted at pallbearers, namely, Billy Pierce, Jack Gilmour, Jerry Guthrie, Jimmy Metcalfe, Billy Naismith and Bobby Rivington. Among the floral offerings were pieces from the Almonte High School pupils and pupils of S.S. 6 & 7, Ramsay, and the U.F.W.O. The sympathy of the whole community goes out to the bereaved parents and the brother and sister.\n\nDocumenting History — Lawrence Timothy Madden\n\nPosted on by\n\nI document history good or bad, because every single person needs to be remembered.\n\nJuly 22,1954\n\nLawrence Timothy Madden, son of Mrs. John Madden and the late Mr. Madden drowned in the Mississippi River, two miles above Almonte, about 5.45 Monday evening while bathing with his brother, Desmond, 22 years old, an employee of the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario, who was home on vacation from Niagara Falls.\n\nThe victim couldn’t swim at all and the older brother was such an indifferent swimmer that when he saw his brother slip into deep water ahd disappear, he felt it better to get help than to try to rescue him himself. He ran to the home of Jas. B. Turner whose farm borders the river and help was sought in Almonte by telephone.\n\nMr. Don Berry whose father is caretaker of the town hall, heard the call that had -been sent the provincial police, detachment stationed here, and having a fast motor boat was able to get to the scene quicker than others who were forced to go around by road and drive through & long lane across fields to the river bank. Mr. Berry was able to locate the body lying face down in some ten feet of water.\n\nHe brought it to shore and by this time Provincial Police Constable J. A. Ellis and others had arrived. Dr. O. H. Schulte had been called and the Provincial officer, the doctor assisted by others tried artificial respiration for some time but decided it was no use.\n\nThe accident, which happened so simply, was a great shock to everyone -who knew the Madden family. The boys left home on the 12th line of Ramsay expecting to take a dip before supper and it is said when they did not return on time the mother had a premonition of evil. Dr. J. A. McEwen, Lanark County coroner of Carleton Place was called and decided that an inquest was unnecessary.\n\nThe young man who met death so tragically had attended high school here until early in the Spring when he decided to stay at home and help his brother, Joe, with the farm work. He was a member of St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church and of the Holy Name Society.\n\nDeceased is survived by his mother, six brothers and three sisters, namely, Joseph on the farm; Desmond of Niagara Falls; Gerald, also with Hydro; Leo (his twin), Bernard and Raymond at home; and Misses Mary of Ottawa; Kay of Almonte and Dorothy at home. The father, John Madden, died ten years ago. The funeral was held on Thursday morning a t 10 o’clock from the family home in Ramsay Township to St. Mary’s Church, Almonte, for requiem mass. Interment was in St. Mary’s Cemetery.\n\nThe Ottawa Citizen\n\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada\n\n29 Jul 1954, Thu • Page 7\n\nWhen Lawrence Timothy Madden and his twin brother Leo Michael were born on August 3, 1936, in Ramsey, Ontario, their father, William, was 40, and their mother, Loretta, was 40.
