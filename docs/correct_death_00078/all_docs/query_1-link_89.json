But others advocated to have the statue remain, arguing claims that Macdonald perpetuated genocide were inaccurate and that removing the statue would be erasing history.\n\nWhile councillors Bob Hawkins (Ward 2) and Lori Bresciani (Ward 4) argued the city hadn’t done broad enough public consultation before recommending the statue come down, other members of council urged colleagues to defer to those most affected.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Given what we’ve heard today,” Coun. Daniel LeBlanc (Ward 6) said, “I think it is incumbent on us as a city to side with the people who were harmed by Macdonald’s policies or we side with Macdonald himself.”\n\nIn the end, council voted 7-4 to have the statue relocated to storage until a more fulsome legacy review is complete and decision can be made on where to place it. The decision was a cause for celebration for those who had long advocated for the statue’s removal, but even those who agreed the statue should be removed, didn’t all agree on how it should be done.\n\nDespite being the centre of public debate for months, the statue was quietly whisked without warning in the early hours of April 13.\n\nIn an interview later that day, Emmaline Hill, manager of social and cultural development with the city, said while the statue’s removal went ahead without any spectators present, steps were taken to ensure some level of presence or ceremony wasn’t required in keeping with reconciliation or the city’s relationship with the Indigenous community.\n\nAccording to documents the Leader-Post subsequently obtained through a freedom of information request, the city consulted elder/knowledge keeper Larry Oakes.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut Star Andreas, an Indigenous woman who long advocated for the statue’s removal, was disappointed in the lack of ceremony.\n\n“We wanted to do a ceremony because it’s a part of healing. We wanted jingle dress dancers there and drums there,” Andreas said in a Sept. 10 interview.\n\n“They did it in a secretive way,” she said. “I even asked the city to call me when they had it done because we wanted a ceremony.” She says she never got a call.\n\nWhile the statue sits in storage, the debate continues as residents share thoughts and opinions on what should be done with it next. On the city’s Be Heard website, hundreds of comments have been posted by residents since the statue came down. The ratio of those for and against compared to those who spoke at the March 31 city council meeting appears to be flipped as residents are perhaps emboldened by the veil provided by an online forum.\n\n“It’s absolutely disgusting that these events are taking place. We are removing great figures of Canadian history,” wrote ‘Proud Canadian.’\n\n“You should be ashamed for removing Sir John A.’s statue,” Tommy Cranmer wrote. “Put him back in another prominent place so we can honour and thank him.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut others continue to affirm the decision to find a new place for the bronze statue, stating that no matter what good Macdonald did, the harm done to Indigenous people outweighs it, and other Canadian cities have followed suit. A statue of Macdonald was removed from a downtown Kingston, Ont., park in June.\n\nWhile the future resting place of the statue is still unknown, one thing is certain — even in its absence, the harmful legacy of John A. Macdonald has not been forgotten.\n\njackerman@postmedia.com\n\nThe news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
