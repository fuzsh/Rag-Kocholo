A survivor of the Sixties Scoop, she told council how the legacy of Macdonald impacted her and her family and reminded council of its commitment to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. “I’m asking council to act now on this commitment by acknowledging the ongoing harm in our community caused by having this statue in our city square,” she said. Most who spoke to council, did so in favour of the statue’s removal, acknowledging the need to make Victoria Park a safe and welcoming space for all. But others advocated to have the statue remain, arguing claims that Macdonald perpetuated genocide were inaccurate and that removing the statue would be erasing history. While councillors Bob Hawkins (Ward 2) and Lori Bresciani (Ward 4) argued the city hadn’t done broad enough public consultation before recommending the statue come down, other members of council urged colleagues to defer to those most affected.\n\nHeadline News Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

Daniel LeBlanc (Ward 6) said, “I think it is incumbent on us as a city to side with the people who were harmed by Macdonald’s policies or we side with Macdonald himself.” Photo by TROY FLEECE / Regina Leader-Post In the end, council voted 7-4 to have the statue relocated to storage until a more fulsome legacy review is complete and decision can be made on where to place it. The decision was a cause for celebration for those who had long advocated for the statue’s removal, but even those who agreed the statue should be removed, didn’t all agree on how it should be done. Despite being the centre of public debate for months, the statue was quietly whisked without warning in the early hours of April 13. In an interview later that day, Emmaline Hill, manager of social and cultural development with the city, said while the statue’s removal went ahead without any spectators present, steps were taken to ensure some level of presence or ceremony wasn’t required in keeping with reconciliation or the city’s relationship with the Indigenous community. According to documents the Leader-Post subsequently obtained through a freedom of information request, the city consulted elder/knowledge keeper Larry Oakes.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content But Star Andreas, an Indigenous woman who long advocated for the statue’s removal, was disappointed in the lack of ceremony. “We wanted to do a ceremony because it’s a part of healing. We wanted jingle dress dancers there and drums there,” Andreas said in a Sept. 10 interview. Photo by TROY FLEECE / Regina Leader-Post “They did it in a secretive way,” she said. “I even asked the city to call me when they had it done because we wanted a ceremony.” She says she never got a call. While the statue sits in storage, the debate continues as residents share thoughts and opinions on what should be done with it next. On the city’s Be Heard website, hundreds of comments have been posted by residents since the statue came down. The ratio of those for and against compared to those who spoke at the March 31 city council meeting appears to be flipped as residents are perhaps emboldened by the veil provided by an online forum. “It’s absolutely disgusting that these events are taking place. We are removing great figures of Canadian history,” wrote ‘Proud Canadian.’ “You should be ashamed for removing Sir John A.’s statue,” Tommy Cranmer wrote. “Put him back in another prominent place so we can honour and thank him.”\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content But others continue to affirm the decision to find a new place for the bronze statue, stating that no matter what good Macdonald did, the harm done to Indigenous people outweighs it, and other Canadian cities have followed suit. A statue of Macdonald was removed from a downtown Kingston, Ont., park in June. While the future resting place of the statue is still unknown, one thing is certain — even in its absence, the harmful legacy of John A. Macdonald has not been forgotten. jackerman@postmedia.com The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
