His statue, erected 128 years ago, has been vandalized numerous times, including a decapitation in 1992 and several instances in which it was splashed with blood-red paint.\n\nA committee composed of the city’s urban affairs, heritage and cultural departments along with external experts studied the question of whether the statue should be reinstalled. A public consultation was held in December.\n\nIn a presentation to the city’s executive committee Wednesday, the group recommended the statue not be returned to its former site. It suggested instead that the ornate pedestal and monument that surrounded the statue be maintained, along with a plaque outlining its historical significance, and a new spot be found in a local cultural institution to display the statue of Macdonald.\n\nThe city’s executive committee adopted the recommendation.\n\n“The future of this statue, while it reminds us of a certain era, also invites us to be in step with today, to be able to take a critical look at our history while preserving our heritage,” said Ericka Alneus, executive committee member responsible for culture and heritage.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShe noted the city was aware the decision would not be universally applauded.\n\nQuebec Culture Minister Mathieu Lacombe was among the first to criticize the choice.\n\n“The position of our government is very clear: We must not rewrite history. You have to live with this story for better and for worse. I think it’s important,” he said.\n\nPressed to clarify whether he believed the statue should be put back in place, Lacombe said he was going to “let the mayor (of Montreal, Valérie Plante) do her job, but if you ask me the question as to whether we must rewrite history or not, I think it’s important to live with our history.”\n\nAlneus said the decision not to reinstate Macdonald to his former pedestal was an “exceptional case.” The city does not intend to replace historical monuments every time they’re vandalized or people lodge complaints.\n\n“I think in this case, we made the most enlightened decision, knowing the weight that it carries,” she said. “This was a figure who was considered extremely offensive.”\n\nThe committee recommended a public call for proposals for a “multidisciplinary project allowing a wider reinterpretation of the monument” at Place du Canada to be launched by the end of the year, asking Montreal artists to participate. Proposals from members of the Indigenous artistic community would be especially welcome, Alneus said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe city is in talks with different institutions to decide where to place the statue, along with an interpretive panel that will reflect all aspects of its history.\n\nAlthough Macdonald was considered the key figure in Canadian Confederation — he served as prime minister from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 to 1891 — modern historians have criticized some of his government’s legislation and programs, including the creation of the Indigenous residential school system in 1883, the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, the hanging of Métis leader Louis Riel and the starving of Indigenous communities to drive them out of the way to facilitate completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nAcross Canada, other statues of Macdonald have been removed or vandalized in recent years. The city of Kingston, Ont., decided to take his likeness down in 2021. Charlottetown, P.E.I., took similar measures the same year after the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school for Indigenous youth.\n\nPresse Canadienne contributed to this report.\n\nrbruemmer@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nOpinion: Montreal's Sir John A.
