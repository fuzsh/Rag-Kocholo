The only Wandless was\n\nthe infant death of Olivia Sarah, who was also listed as Wanless. This database is meant as a finding aid only; you have to get the actual records from the relevant genealogical society (the codes in the last column; the OCFA site explains all this) or on film from the LDS or the Ontario Archives.\n\nI sorted this database first by county and then by cemetery name, so you can see groupings of families. Use your browser’s Find function to find a particular name if you don’t know where they’re buried.\n\nSearch OCFA yourself and watch their site for updates to their database. Also check the Ontario Cemetery Project which has many headstone pictures.\n\nDeaths from various sources:\n\nSt. Thomas, Elgin county, Ontario – newspaper indexing project of the St. Thomas Times Journal\n\nhttp://www.elginogs.ca/newsindexes/timesjournal\n\n18 March 1930, page 9 column 1: Died – George Wanless, (born Quebec), 16 March 1930 at Sandwich\n\n27 February 1930, page 12 column 4: Died – Mrs. May Wanless (born Exeter), nee Southcott, wife of Alex.
