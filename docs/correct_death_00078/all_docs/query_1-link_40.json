There ought to be schools named after them.\n\nBut it was not only through their military alliances that indigenous peoples helped shape the Canada that Macdonald would bring together under Confederation. They also created trade networks and commercial relations. The French traders established ties of kinship. The English and Scottish traders of the Northwest Company and the Hudsonâ€™s Bay Company continued to intermarry with the indigenous population."
