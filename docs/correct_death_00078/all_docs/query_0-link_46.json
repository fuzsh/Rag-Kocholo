    "text": "Notes\n\nPreface\n\n1. One Western Ontario resident semi-affectionately called it “the War o’Twelve” in a conversation some years ago, using an expression apparently inherited as an oral tradition from his ancestors.\n\n2. So complete was the disorder that in only one case was I able to identify two adjacent pages as remaining in their original sequence—and even then, only because their mold stains matched.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. During the British period la rivière à Gervais came to be transliterated as Jarvis Creek, a reflection of the local French pronunciation of the name.\n\n2. Petite Côte: literally, Little Coast. In North American idiom however a côte was a settlement, a group of French-Canadian ribbon farm lots.\n\n3. With nineteenth- and twentieth-century urbanization on both shores we have inherited a street pattern whose grain follows that of the underlying farm-lot system. Not all the streets line up—in fact, most do not, thanks presumably to those fun-loving stake-movers—but some do, forming one of the unconscious cross-border links that characterizes our lives. One particularly striking example is a pair of streets opposite the downriver end of Belle Isle, both called Meldrum. They carry the name of a man whose career was significant on both sides of the river. George Meldrum, a Detroit merchant, was appointed by the British as an official of the District of Hesse.\n\n4. The Ottawa River for most of its length became the boundary between the new provinces. The terms Upper and Lower in the Canadas refer to their relative elevations above sea level; they do not mean northern and southern, as in Michigan.\n\n5. The attaching of Detroit to Kent rather than to Essex was the product of a remarkable rationalization. When the counties were created, Kent alone was described loosely in the proclamation as all those parts of “the country commonly called or known by the name of Canada” not already assigned to other counties. It appears that this specious justification could equally have been applied to the other occupied posts, if the British had wished to gerrymander Kent County that far.\n\nChapter One\n\n1. John Graves Simcoe to Home Secretary Henry Dundas (n. d.); Shortt and Doughty, 18:413. For town read township. This confusing contraction continues in North American usage today.\n\n2. Quaife, 2:369.\n\n3. Stuart to his son James, July 3, 1802; A. H. Young, “The Revd. Richard Pollard, 1752–1824,” OHS 25:457.\n\n4. An infertile part of the Petite Côte settlement came to be known during the eighteenth century as La Côte de misère (Misery Settlement).\n\n5. Even as late as 1811 it seems that Hands was still engaged in trade, in addition to all of his public offices; at that time he was involved in a dispute with Angus Mackintosh over the proceeds of sugar sales.\n\n6. WDM, May 7, 1827.\n\n7. Craig to Gore, February 7, 1810; Young, “Pollard,” 458.\n\n8. Bishop Plessis to Gore, Quebec, December 31, 1808; MP, 23:66.\n\n9. Gore to Plessis, York, January 28, 1809; MP, 15:52.\n\n10. Fraser to Askin, Detroit, November 10, 1807; Quaife, 2:582.\n\n11. John Askin began distilling at his establishment in Detroit as early as 1800.\n\n12. Robert Nichol to Askin, Fort Erie, October 19, 1804; Quaife, 2:438.\n\n13. John Askin Jr. to Askin, St. Joseph Island, November 11, 1807; Quaife, 2:583.\n\n14. One minot equals five pecks; Quaife, 2:402, note 46.\n\n15. The merchants of the West must have felt themselves isolated indeed. John Askin Jr., writing in January 1811 from icebound St. Joseph Island to his brother Charles, newly arrived at Queenston, remarked on Charles’s novel means of transportation from Lower Canada: “The steam Boats must be an expeditious way of voyageing.” By contrast, two weeks later Askin wrote his father to assure him that Captain John Fearson, master of the Saguinah, was still living; Fearson had gone aground at St. Joseph Island in the fall of 1810 and had been icebound, and unheard from, all winter.\n\n16. Draft of William Hands Sr. to George Heriot, Sandwich, June 1, 1808; MHC, 20-108.\n\n17. The land on which the Western District Grammar School, the “Stone College,” was built is still used for public purposes. In 1998 an archaeological investigation carried out after the demolition of the 1915 General Brock Public Elementary School recovered evidence of this former occupation of the site.\n\n18. The Assembly met in the provincial capital, located first at distant Newark (later called Niagara, now Niagara-on-the-Lake), then at equally distant York (modern Toronto).\n\n19. Smith to Askin, July 24, 1800; Quaife, 2:298. The merchant firm of Meldrum and Park originated on the Detroit side. William Park elected to transfer to Sandwich, while George Meldrum remained in Detroit.\n\n20. This was to be expected in an area laid out in the British grid system of two-hundred-acre, brick-shaped farm lots superimposed on the land in disregard of geographical features, as distinct from the water-oriented French system in the Detroit River settlement.\n\n21. The division of Sandwich Township did not actually happen for another six decades.\n\n22. In practice, a piece cut from the scalp including the whorl of hair at the crown was accepted as proof of the killing of the wolf. The claimant took his scalp to the nearest magistrate, who issued a wolf scalp certificate that could be approved for payment by the Court of Quarter Sessions. Wolf scalp certificates therefore circulated like cash.\n\n23. Craig, 143. The title “Commodore,” often applied to Grant, appears not to have been a rank but a nickname.\n\n24. RBA, Eighth Report, 139.\n\n25. Monforton to Askin, Sandwich, July 24, 1807, and petition, Monforton to Gore, both translated by the editor; Quaife, 2:558.\n\n26. Nichol to Askin, Niagara, February 15, 1804; Brigadier General E. A. Cruikshank, “Some Letters of Robert Nichol,” OHS 20:41.\n\n27. Somewhat similarly, Thomas Talbot’s settlers came to be grouped by their national origins.\n\n28. It was just as well, since the so-called Shawnee Township had been purchased by the Crown in 1796 and set aside as a native reserve. As for the islands, since the international boundary had not yet been surveyed through the delta, it was not possible to say which were British and which were American.\n\n29. McDonald to Selkirk, January 1810; F. C. Hamil, “Lord Selkirk in Upper Canada,” OHS 37:44.\n\n30. The traditional belief has been that the creator of these works was Catherine. However the only one known to be signed is the well-known View of Amherstburg in 1813, which is inscribed “M. Reynolds.” It seems reasonable that both daughters were involved, particularly since at least one other of Thomas Reynolds’s children was inclined toward the arts; Robert Reynolds was the builder of Bellevue, the fine neoclassic house on the south edge of Amherstburg.\n\n31. McKee to Askin, Amherstburg, June 7, 1806; Quaife, 2:521. The reference is probably to William Elliott, who was a captain (not yet a colonel) in the First Essex Militia.\n\n32. Askin to Alexander Grant, Strabane, June 27, 1807; Quaife, 2:552–53.\n\n33. Baby to Gore, Raleigh, December 18, 1807; MP, 25:231.\n\n34. The appointment of county lieutenants in Upper Canada was another reflection of the British desire to foster an aristocracy in Canada. County lieutenants, themselves magistrates, were intended to influence the appointments of other magistrates, as well as the affairs of the county militias. Baby briefly (for only five and a half months in 1807) enjoyed the lieutenancy of Essex. He was both preceded and succeeded by Alexander Grant.\n\n35. Claus to Gore, Amherstburg, April 20, 1808; MP, 15:48.\n\n36. Claus to Gore, Amherstburg, May 22 and May 26, 1808; MP, 23:61, 62.\n\n37. Something of the scale and the rapid growth of the Indian Department’s operation in the western District can be gleaned from the following: St. Joseph Island at the head of Lake Huron was visited by nearly 1,300 natives, of three different tribes, in a six-month period in 1803–4. On June 2, 1808, ninety-five packages of presents for distribution to the natives were delivered at Amherstburg on board the Camden, and Matthew Elliott reported that 5,000 natives visited Amherstburg for presents that fall. Two years later, in 1810, he declared that annual presents had already been given to 6,000 natives, and the year was not yet over.\n\n38. This must have been a heady moment for Elliott, who was almost simultaneously reelected to the Legislative Assembly.\n\n39. Claus diary, Amherstburg, July 2, 1808; MP, 23:47.\n\n40. Gore to Craig, York, February 20, 1809; MP, 15:53.\n\n41. Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, to Craig, London, April 8, 1809; MP, 23:69.\n\n42. These annual appointments, traditionally made in July, became effective five months later, on Christmas Day.\n\n43. Report of Lieutenant Colonel Bruyeres, Quebec, August 24, 1811; MP, 15:54.\n\n44. Report of Major General Glasgow to Prevost, Quebec, September 18, 1811; MP, 15:55.\n\nChapter Two\n\n1. A. Gray, acting deputy quartermaster general, to Sir George Prevost, Montreal, January 13, 1812; MP, 15:70.\n\n2. Brock to Prevost, York, February 6, 1812; DRICSD, 16.\n\n3. William Hull to Secretary of War Eustis, Washington, March 6, 1812; DRICSD, 19. For “the Miami of Lake Erie” read “the Maumee.”\n\n4. Ibid.\n\n5.

The gentleman in question was in all likelihood François Baby.\n\n15. Brock to Prevost, Fort George, July 3, 1812; MP, 15:94.\n\n16. The rest of the province was defended by the militia units of the various counties.\n\n17. Pattinson, Askin’s son-in-law, was a fellow merchant.\n\n18. Hull to St. George, “Camp Spring Hill” (Springwells?), three miles below Detroit, July 6, 1812; MP, 15:96.\n\n19. St. George to an unnamed recipient (probably Brock, on internal evidence), Amherstburg, July 8, 1812; MP, 15:97; also DRICSD, 44.\n\n20. Ibid.\n\n21.

Hatch; negative photostat in 20-135, (118) B9–C1, MHC. The landing was very competently planned and executed. In their echelon formation the boats would have presented only a minimal target to defenders as they emerged from early-July-morning mist on the water and were carried by the current toward the mill on the Canadian shore. For a further discussion of the mill, see chapter 10, note 25.\n\n24. Hull to Eustis, Sandwich, July 15, 1812; DRICSD, 60. The native leaders included The Crane, Walk-in-the-Water, Blackhoof, and Blue Jacket.\n\n25. St. George to Brock, Amherstburg, July 15, 1812; MP, 15:103.\n\n26. Ibid.\n\n27. Matthew Elliott to William Claus, Amherstburg, July 15, 1812; MP, 15:105.\n\n28. An American, Surgeon’s Mate James Reynolds, captured on the Cuyahoga and imprisoned on shipboard at Amherstburg ever since, kept a journal of what little he could see and hear from that moorage. On July 19 he saw a band of armed natives rush past the prison ship, and about two o’clock he heard gunfire. At dusk they returned, and began whooping and firing around the ship. This was the aftermath of a second, and equally indecisive, skirmish at the Canard.\n\n29. Captain Roberts to Brock and to Colonel Baynes, both written at Fort Mackinac, July 17, 1812; MP, 15: 109 and 108, respectively.\n\n30.

Charles Askin, journal, August 15, 1812; Quaife, 2:711.\n\n56. Bacon, 70. The building in question appears to have been built by Jacques Duperon Baby, perhaps about 1760. It had probably been the residence of his son François from the time of François’ marriage in 1795, and in 1812 was being replaced with a mansion of solid brick, then under construction a little to the east. The old building, of squared timbers held together by wooden pins driven through its major mortise-and-tenon joints, could have been demolished very quickly by driving out the pins and then simply pushing against one wall, to expose the battery built behind it.\n\n57. Richardson, 29.\n\n58. One of the legends clinging to the War of 1812 is that General Brock marched his men through François Baby’s new house in a continuous circuit, in the back door and out the front, to persuade the Americans that the British regular-army force was larger than it really was. However implausible this story (and its variations, which turn up all over the world), it obviously has a local basis in fact, involving not the Baby House but the approach to Detroit from downriver.\n\n59. McCay, August 16, 1812.\n\n60. Ibid.\n\n61. Richardson, 37 (66 in Casselman edition).\n\n62. Brock to Prevost, Headquarters, Detroit, August 16, 1812; MP, 15:132.\n\n63. Acting Quartermaster General Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Myers, Seventieth Regiment, to Prevost, Fort George, August 17, 1812; MP, 15:133; also in DHCNF, 3:185.\n\n64. Jacques Baby, Matthew Elliott, and William Caldwell, militia general orders, headquarters, Amherstburg, August 18, 1812; DHCNF, 3:188.\n\n65. Hull to Eustis, Fort George, August 26, 1812; DRICSD, 184, and Richardson, 40.\n\n66. General Peter B. Porter to Governor Tompkins, Black Rock, August 30, 1812; DHCNF, 3:222. Lieutenant Colonel Myers, at Fort George on August 30, reported to Brock a deficiency of 22 prisoners, out of a group of 465 that had been counted at Amherstburg. Among the possible explanations are that they escaped, that the count at Amherstburg was inaccurate, or that twenty-two residents of the Western District who defected to the Americans were actually shot.\n\n67. Baynes to Brock, Montreal, September 10, 1812; DHCNF, 3:249.\n\n68. Hull to Eustis, Fort George, August 26, 1812; DRICSD, 184, and Richardson, 40.\n\n69. The “friends” promised by Robert Dickson in February had indeed arrived from Mackinac with a fleet of canoes filled with native warriors. According to John Richardson, among them were Sacs, “a race of men whose towering height, athletic forms, and nobleness of feature, might recall the idea of the Romans in the earlier stages of their barbarity.” Another group had a name which in English meant Devoted Men. Costumed in soft white leather decorated with stained porcupine quills with “much taste and ingenuity,” the Devoted Men were always ready to demonstrate their scorn of physical pain; one of them cut a piece of flesh from his thigh and “gave it to the dogs.” (Richardson, 60.)\n\n70. Brock to Procter, Fort George, September 17, 1812; DHCNF, 3:271.\n\n71. Brock to Prevost, Fort George, September 18, 1812; DHCNF, 3:276.\n\n72. Brock to Prevost, Fort George, October 9, 1812; MP, 15:162.\n\n73. Brock to Procter, n.d. (probably October 11 or 12, 1812); DHCNF, 4:65.\n\n74. John Richardson describes Isaac Brock as “tall, stout and inclining to corpulency; he was of fair and florid complexion, had a large forehead, full face, but not prominent features, rather small greyish-blue eyes, with a very slight cast in one of them—small mouth, with a pleasing smile and good teeth. In manner he was exceedingly affable and gentlemanly, of a cheerful and social habit, partial to dancing, and although never married, extremely devoted to female society.” (Richardson, 68.) The authenticity of the celebrated tunic worn by Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights, with its bullet hole precisely between the button rows on the chest, is cast into question by the consideration that two such tunics survive in Canadian collections. Moreover, eye-witness accounts published by Cruikshank (DHCNF, 4:83 and 4:108) do not have him shot so symmetrically. The portraying of a hero sometimes departs a little from reality.\n\nChapter Three\n\n1. Procter to Sheaffe, Sandwich, January 13, 1813; MP, 15:215.\n\n2. Prevost to Dickson, Quebec, January 14, 1813; MP, 15:219.\n\n3. Richardson, 75.\n\n4. Ibid., 79. John Richardson’s depiction of the Americans’ misery continued: “They still retained their summer dress, consisting of cotton stuff of various colors, shaped into frocks, and descending to the knee: their trowsers were of the same material. They were covered with slouched hats, worn bare by constant use, beneath which their long hair fell matted and uncombed over their cheeks; and these together with the dirty blankets wrapped around their loins to protect them against the inclemency of the season, and fastened by broad leathern belts, into which were thrust axes and knives of an enormous length, gave them an air of wildness and savageness, which in Italy would have caused them to pass for brigands of the Apennines. The only distinction between the garb of the officer and that of the soldier was, that the one, in addition to his sword, carried a short rifle instead of a long one, while a dagger, often curiously worked and of some value, supplied the place of the knife. This description may be considered as applicable to the various hordes of irregular troops sent forth throughout the war from the States of Ohio and Kentucky. The equipment was ever the same, and differing only inasmuch as their opportunities of preserving or renewing it were more or less frequent.”\n\n5.

One of the ironies of the War of 1812 is that the American fleet might well have been shattered, along with American intentions, by Barclay’s reconnaissance itself. The Queen Charlotte was within about fourteen miles of five American vessels at one point on June 16; no longer needed at the east end of Lake Erie now that the British had lost the Niagara Peninsula, the five were being moved to Presqu’Ile from Buffalo by Perry. If the Charlotte had spotted the Americans, she could easily have destroyed them, putting an end to American superiority on Lake Erie for the season.\n\n14.

The niceties of war were such that while several of the American officers with their British prisoner counterparts were delayed on the Canadian shore, they dined at John Askin’s. Some were even accommodated by him at Strabane until the fourteenth.\n\n31. John Strachan to the Hon. John Richardson, York, October 12, 1813; Spragge, 50.\n\n32.

Prevost to Earl Bathurst, Headquarters, Montreal, November 4, 1813; DHCNF, 8:136. Procter was tried on five charges by a court-martial at Horse Guards, London, on September 9, 1815. He was found not guilty of improperly delaying the withdrawal from Sandwich, but guilty of improper conduct of the retreat, improper placement of supplies, failure to fortify a defensible position, and improper deployment to receive an attack. He received a public reprimand.\n\n35. Sir Gordon Drummond, administrator of Upper Canada, to Prevost, St. Davids, December 18, 1813; MP, 15:452.\n\n36.

The problem with supplies was not solved by the return to the Thames of the plundering expedition, whose members had failed to commandeer the expected quantity of provisions. Sickness in the Detroit garrison was another difficulty.\n\n3. Matthew Elliott to Major J. B. Glegg, Burlington Beach, January 31, 1814; MP, 15:484.\n\n4. Lieutenant Colonel Colley Lucas L.

Most authorities are agreed that the spelling is McDouall, not McDonall, although the handwritten name is open to interpretation and both renderings have reached print.\n\n9. What was left of her sunken hull silted in over the years to become “Nancy Island” in the Nottawasaga River. Excavated and stabilized, the remains of the Nancy recently became the central object in the Nancy Island Historic Site, Wasaga Beach, Ontario.\n\n10. Brigadier General Duncan McArthur to the secretary of war, Headquarters, Detroit, November 18, 1814; DHCNF, 2:308.\n\n11. Lieutenant Colonel W. James to Colonel Harvey, Burlington, November 21, 1814; MP, 15:678.\n\n12. This was Fort Covington, named for the American General Leonard Covington, who died during the war.\n\n13. There are several parallels between the War of 1812–14 and the Vietnam War of the 1950s to the 1970s. Henry Clay’s War Hawks and their congressional opponents had their counterparts in the Hawks and Doves of the Vietnam era. Both adventures were widely unpopular in the United States (the War of 1812 particularly in New England, where business was business, and trade with the Maritimes continued), and both fell well short of fulfilling American aspirations.\n\nChapter Five\n\n1. John Askin Sr., diary, March 29, 1815; MP, 32:468. Askin himself declined to attend, citing his “advanced term of life and weak state of health.” He died the following month.\n\n2. As late as May 29, the American commandant at Amherstburg was maintaining that his orders were to continue to occupy Bois Blanc Island and Fort Malden, and the British would-be occupants were forced to wait elsewhere for the bureaucracy to resolve the problem. To accommodate the men of the Thirty-Seventh Regiment, the magistrates of the Western District allowed them the use of the Western District Grammar School at Sandwich. It was a masonry building, capable of housing up to 130 men, and could be made defensible on short notice, if necessary. (Fortunately, one further potential source of misunderstanding was avoided: confusion over which Bois Blanc Island was meant, since there was another one, close to Mackinac Island.)\n\n3. Captain Edward Collier to Commodore William Fitzwilliam Owen, Moy, May 5, 1815; MP, 16:16. In one widely held American view the 1783 Treaty of Versailles set the boundary at the middle of the navigable water, not the middle of the river; and since the channel ran between Bois Blanc and the Canadian mainland, the island was American. Owen Sound on Georgian Bay, charted in the course of this survey, was named by Owen in 1815 for his brother, Sir Edward W. C. R. Owen. The city of Owen Sound was named for Captain Owen himself on his death in 1857. Bayfield, in Huron County on Lake Huron, was named for Henry Wolsey Bayfield, who took over the survey when Owen was recalled to England in 1817.\n\n4. Anthony St. John Baker, British chargé d’affaires to the United States, to Sir Gordon Drummond, administrator of the Canadas, Philadelphia, May 25, 1815; MP, 16:117.\n\n5. Drummond to Henry Bathurst, third earl of Bathurst, secretary of state for war and the colonies, Quebec, August 15, 1815; MP, 25:630.\n\n6. Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall of the Thirty-Seventh Regiment to Assistant Military Secretary Will Gibson, Drummond Island, October 4, 1815; MP, 16:311.\n\n7. Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson to Lieutenant Colonel Addison, military secretary, Commissary General’s Office, Quebec, July 22, 1816; MP, 16:491. Although construction resumed at the western British posts by the late summer, at Drummond Island the major effort was not new fortifications but making existing buildings habitable for the coming winter. Similarly, at Amherstburg a commissariat store and bake shop were added to the complex of buildings.\n\n8. At the time the post was called Fort Collier, after Captain Edward Collier, participating in the Great Lakes survey.\n\n9. Report of fortifications &c in Upper Canada and Lower Canada, Engineers’ Office, Quebec, November 20, 1816; MP, 16:548.\n\n10.

James to Robinson, Sandwich, September 20, 1815; MP, 16:277.\n\n13. Many of the details of this story seem implausible. Why was the native hunting squirrels from a canoe? Why would a squirrel hunter raise his gun to threaten an occupant of a nearby boat? How, if he was aiming at the passenger, was he shot in the back by a fellow passenger? Against these assertions is the statement of a young Kickapoo lad. According to the boy, no one had raised his gun against the passing Americans; he maintained that the deceased had been steering the canoe, not holding a gun, and had had his back to the Americans. A troublesome impression persists that the story of the threat from the canoe to the American boaters was fabricated, and that the native was shot merely for sport.\n\n14. American currency was used on both sides of the Detroit frontier at this time, as was sterling and, to a lesser extent, other countries’ legal tender.\n\n15. McDouall to Major General L. de Watteville, Drummond Island, March 26, 1816; MP, 16:448.\n\n16. McDouall to de Watteville, Drummond Island, May 4, 1816; MP, 16:452.\n\n17. The Rush-Bagot Convention of 1817, which resulted from these discussions, bears the name of Richard Rush, Monroe’s successor as secretary of state.\n\n18.

Memo re new works and improvements proposed for the Canadas and approved by Major General Sir James Carmichael Smyth, March 31, 1826; MP, 23:414.\n\n25. The perceived need for security against civil unrest in Upper Canada perhaps reflected the provincial administration’s unease over the anti-government outcome of the election of 1824. For the first time a clearly anti-government majority was produced in the Assembly, which was attributable in large part to voters in the west, whose heads were thought to be filled with Yankee democratic notions.\n\n26. William McCormick to Adjutant General of Militia Nathaniel Coffin, March 22, 1822; McCormick Family Papers, 20-148, MHC.\n\n27. James to Major General Sir F. P.

John Askin Jr. to William Claus, Amherstburg, August 12, 1818; MP, 16:632.\n\n37. The Ojibwa were willing to sell, as long as a number of reserves were set aside. They asked the British to name a price, to be paid in annual installments for fifty years, half in cash and half in clothing, the price to be in addition to their annual presents. They also asked for a blacksmith, and for training in farming.\n\n38. John Askin Jr. died on January 1, 1820, and William Caldwell on February 20, 1822.\n\n39. Clearly those four hundred who helped put out the fire on Drummond Island on June 25, 1820, were only those who happened to be there on that day.\n\n40. Captain Owen to Captain W. Baumgardt, H.M.S. Prince Regent, Hydrographic Office, Kingston, August 4, 1816; MP, 16:505. Georgian Bay appears not to have been considered part of Lake Huron.\n\n41. Something of the informality of this arrangement is suggested by Askin’s offer to swear in the new appointee himself.\n\n42. McDouall to Military Secretary Addison, Drummond Island, June 19, 1816; MP, 16:469.\n\n43. Thomas Gummersall Anderson to William Hands Sr., Drummond Island, May 14, 1828; Hands Family Papers, 20-108, MHC.\n\n44. A coalition had been negotiated between the competing North West Company and Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821, in the hope that the new partnership’s operatives could be effective in the American Northwest, the territory of the American Fur Company. In the end, fashion turned the tide, when silk replaced felt as the favored material for hats, and the market for beaver pelts declined in the 1830s.\n\n45. In the end, the expense and inconvenience of locating and maintaining a replacement for Drummond Island at either Sault Ste. Marie or St. Joseph Island persuaded the British to substitute their existing post at Penetang (Penetanguishene) on Georgian Bay.\n\nChapter Six\n\n1. Wilkinson Family Papers, 20-235, (209) B10, MHC. Although found in the surveying records of John and Alexander Wilkinson, the authorship of this note is clear; it was datelined Port Talbot, November 29, 1824, and signed with the initials T.T.\n\n2. A measure of the seriousness of the problem: the previous autumn it was reported to Assistant Adjutant General Colley Foster that there were no shipwrights to be found in British North America above Lake Ontario.\n\n3.

In subsequent years the eroded and collapsed church at Colchester became the raw material for a chapel, intended to preserve the memory of the original.\n\n12. Ironically, whereas Pollard earlier had responsibility for the Michigan Territory as a mission field, two days after the opening of his newest church a missionary from Ohio made a customs declaration from the River Thames, whither he had journeyed, “in order to take charge of the congregation of Christian Indians living on this River” (letter to Collector of Customs William Hands Sr., June 13, 1820). The English Church at Sandwich was named St. John’s Church on September 25, 1838.\n\n13.

James May to Moses David, Detroit, March 12, 1805; Solomon Sibley Papers, Burton Historical Collection. James Henry of Detroit was a community leader, a merchant as well as a multiple public officeholder.\n\n30. Linking by Jews with the established church seems not to have been regarded as particularly traumatic; British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s father converted to Anglicanism, and in Canada, Isaac Hellmuth became Anglican bishop of Huron. Moses David’s remains were exhumed from his private grave in 1978 and moved to Shaar Hashomayim Congregation’s burial ground. Curiously, David’s connection to the English Church was found not in the records of St. John’s Church, but rather in a typed transcript of a note of a vestry meeting preserved in the Macdonald Historical Collection; the location of the original of this document is unknown.\n\n31.

The circumflex in the variant Baby is a frill that appears to have been added by a governmental clerk, not by a family member, in the late nineteenth century.\n\n36. Alexander Mackintosh to Grant & Kerby, Moy, March 17, 1824; letter book, Mackintosh Family Papers, 20-137, MHC.

Jacques Baby to William Hands Sr., York, August 30, 1824; Hands Family Papers, 20-108 (29), C3, MHC.\n\n38. This creek seems to have been an alternative outlet for the Grand Coulee, whose main channel, where present Giles Boulevard is located, passed behind Sandwich before discharging into the Detroit River below the town. The gully at Baby’s was labeled “Ravine and outlet of grand coulee” on a map by John A. Wilkinson in 1853.\n\n39. Other obstructions, such as stakes (presumably where farmers tied up their boats), were also to be removed. While the justices were at it they directed that traffic venturing out onto the ice be protected by the placing of stakes as markers at the various water holes broken by the inhabitants close to the shoreline.\n\n40.

The surviving octagonal King House must be a replacement of the late 1850s for the first residence, inspired by the phrenologist Orson Squire Fowler’s book A Home for All; or, the Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building, first published in 1848.\n\n25. The westernmost corner of the parallelogram of the 1790s survives as a triangle bounded on the north by Cabana Road, on the west by Huron Church Road/Line, and on the east by Howard Avenue.\n\n26. The “dogleg” in Tecumseh Road results from this adherence to the line, eastward from the Huron Church Line, before offsetting to the south to follow a straight line affording a minimum forty arpents’ depth, regardless of the windings of the shore.\n\n27.

John Sandfield Macdonald, a future prime minister of the province of Canada and subsequently the first premier of Ontario, was traveling with and assisting Archibald McLean, a future chief justice of Upper Canada, sitting for the first time as an associate judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench, whose circuit included Sandwich.\n\n32.

François Baby was one of the two members representing Essex County in the Upper Canada House of Assembly, 1820–30.\n\n36. Jameson, 2:85.\n\n37. The Argo, built in Detroit by Shadrack Jenking, of Sandwich Township, had a hull fashioned from two dug out logs, decked over, with a little sidewheel steam engine amidships. She was described as “cranky,” that is, badly working, lurching, or shaky. She was so low-powered that once when a passenger, attempting to climb over the paddle box, put his foot through the plank covering and caught it in one of the buckets on the paddle wheel, his foot stopped the engine. The passenger then extricated the offending foot without injury and the boat proceeded on its way.\n\n38. In its first phase the plot encompassed village lots in two ranges, laid out on either side of the river road, beginning just east of François Baby’s mansion and extending to the edge of the Ouellette farm. A third range in the rear can be inferred, but the evidence of the lot numbering system shown on a later map, dated 1853, is ambiguous.\n\n39. It could well be that Austen and his family were part of that wave of British immigration that brought cholera to North America, yet the same James Austen proved to be ancestral to the automotive industry that would dominate the future city through the twentieth century.\n\n40. Although the original part of Church Street survives, only a short section of Assumption Street remains at the time of writing, an east-west alley behind the Hilton Windsor hotel, serving the Cleary International Centre.\n\n41. Shirreff, 216.\n\n42. The partnership of Murray and Crawford almost immediately dissolved; William Murray continued to operate the Pavilion House on his own.\n\n43. WDM, July 14, 1835.\n\n44. The road had a bend in it because of a structure on the water’s edge, possibly Baby’s old ferry house. The mouth of the creek that discharged westerly into the Detroit River seems to have figured strongly in the development of Baby’s ferry landing and hence the origins of Windsor. It had eroded the river bank at the northeast corner of Baby’s frontage, diminishing the usefulness of that portion of his property for agriculture but also creating a natural harbor, protected by the headland between the north bank of the creek and the river. It was on the tip of that headland, on Baby’s side of the line between his farm and Ouellette’s, that the ferry house is thought to have been located.\n\nHowever, there is another, more sinister explanation for this bend. Wilkinson’s survey, carried out just three days before Baby’s petition for the water lots, shows the road to the ferry landing running 66 feet along the Baby/Ouellette lot line from the main road, then changing course 21 degrees westerly for a further 145 feet to the end of Baby’s wharf. This configuration would place the end of the wharf well away from the projection of the lot line, permitting ferry departures without encroaching over the line, but also making approaches by the competing ferry to a landing next door exceedingly difficult.\n\n45. Court of Quarter Sessions correspondence, report in the hand of John A. Wilkinson, July 11, 1835; Western District Records, 20-248, MHC. Statute labor was roadwork required to be performed annually by the residents of a township.\n\n46. WDM, August 22, 1835.\n\n47. This incident provided an opportunity, rare perhaps, for the offender’s nephew, Clerk of the Peace Charles Baby, to assert himself within the family. In his draft of a letter to his uncle François, Charles at first wrote that François was “requested,” which he amended to “required,” to remove them immediately.\n\n48. SWH, September 16, 1840. The British Queen was the former Pavilion House, renamed in honor of Queen Victoria’s accession to the throne in 1837.\n\n49. SWH, September 16, 1840; also QBR, 6:239, and 1:438. Other details will be found in JPD, passim, July 24, 1839, through August 10, 1841.\n\n50. The old landing was rendered virtually useless anyway by a disastrous fire on April 15, 1849, caused when a pile of cedar on Baby’s wharf was ignited, possibly by a spark from the stack of the steamer Hastings. The opening of Ferry Street seems to have entailed at least partially filling the gully at the outlet of the Grand Coulee, causing a problem with drainage. Narcisse A. Janette, proprietor of the two farm lots to the west of Baby’s, complained on December 4, 1849, that Baby had had a ditch dug across the front not only of his own property but of Janette’s as well.\n\n51. Field notebooks; Wilkinson Family Papers, 20-235, MHC.\n\n52. Lack of coordination between the owners of adjacent subdivisions led to mismatched cross streets, as is particularly evident today in the vicinity of City Hall Square.\n\n53. No doubt this is what prompted Denis Parent, the owner of lot 88, to retain John A. Wilkinson to subdivide his frontage, just as Joseph McDougall had done on lot 85. The subdivision layout was similar, and modern Parent Avenue was the result.\n\n54. SCE, September 13, 1836. Sadly, not only the inspiration for the name Windsor, but even the circumstances surrounding the calling of the meeting, remain the subjects of speculation. The preceding issue of the Emigrant, which must have carried the announcement of the meeting, has been lost. The following issue carried the obituary of John Dougall (James’s brother, the other “J” of J. and J. Dougall), whose death at Montreal had taken place on August 28. The notice, communicated to the paper almost certainly by James, referred to John as “the father” of “the flourishing village of Windsor.” However, James’s own obituary, published after his death in 1888, not only ascribed the naming to him, but added these words, which have caused problems ever since: “Then John Hutton, who kept the only hotel in the place, jumped up and said he would call his house (Windsor Castle).” This is clearly wrong; not only were there other inns at The Ferry in 1836, but innkeeper John Hutton apparently was not. Hutton’s name has not been found until 1839, in Sandwich Township (at Moy), and not until late 1842 at Windsor. Further complicating the mystery, S. T. Probett, not John Hutton, announced the opening of his “Windsor Castle Ale & Beer House” in the Sandwich Western Herald and Farmers Magazine, on May 29, 1838, not in 1836. Probett’s Windsor Castle stood “on the ferry wharf, between the two tailor shops,” by his description, but judging by the well-known photograph (taken years later, of course) perhaps “at the ferry wharf” might have been more accurate, since it is obviously on the south side of Sandwich Street, on dry land.\n\n55. Mackay’s Canada Directory used the name Front Street in 1851, but apparently that designation failed to take hold. Sandwich Street was renamed Riverside Drive in 1935.\n\n56. WDM, October 14, 1829.\n\n57. The formerly sharp corners of this offset are now rounded off.\n\n58. Confusingly, John Alexander Wilkinson’s son, also a surveyor, was named Alexander John.\n\n59. The extra width of the later London Street, so conspicuous in modern University Avenue, provided for a horse trolley service as well as road traffic.\n\n60. Although Prescott is known to have been in England from 1799 onward, the possibility that he issued a license of occupation cannot be ruled out.\n\n61. Shirreff, 194.\n\n62. SCE, May 9, 1835.\n\n63.

The reference to Canadians should be read as French Canadians, as a later passage in the same source makes clear: “The French Canadians cannot be relied on.” At this time the French-Canadian residents seem not to have viewed the Patriot War as their cause, preferring to regard it as directed against the Anglo oligarchy. Possibly the blacks expected by Prince were from two such militia companies known to have been based at Chatham, in Kent County, in 1839.\n\n4. James Hamilton to J. B. Askin, Windsor, December 30, 1837; Sanderson, 1:44.\n\n5. JPD, February 24 and 25, 1838.\n\n6. Both prongs of the attack had been planned for February 22, George Washington’s birthday.\n\n7. JPD, March 3, 1838.\n\n8. By luck, both had been captured by Prince the day after the Battle of Pelee Island, on the Canadian shore a little west of the Colchester town site.\n\n9. There was a precedent for this locally conceived, unilateral border closure: the justices’ similar action during the cholera epidemic of 1832. A story in the Sandwich Western Herald of June 26 that the Second Queen’s Light Infantry was to be disbanded on July 1, leaving the frontier very weakly defended, probably hastened the magistrates’ decision to impound the small craft, although they must have known that the editor meant July 31.\n\n10. JPD, November 1, 1838.\n\n11. JPD, December 1, 1838.\n\n12. Although this William Johnson was described as a teacher, he might have doubled as the Reverend William Johnson, of Sandwich. See SCE, May 2, 1835.\n\n13. Henry Grant, the editor of the Sandwich Western Herald, identified Captains Sparke and Bell in his account of the Battle of Windsor as members of the Provincial Volunteer Militia—presumably an alternative name for the Incorporated Militia. Also, John Prince identified Captain Fox of the Third Essex (Prince’s own regiment) as Michael Fox in his diary in 1836, but as W. Fox in 1839; that same year he referred to a Lieutenant M. Fox.\n\n14. Since the second wave of Patriots had chosen this particular spot to take their repose, perhaps it is just as well that Dougall, before entering the fray, had providentially emptied his safe of twenty thousand dollars, which he stuffed into his pockets before departing for the orchard. Small wonder that he grandiosely offered the aforementioned hundred-dollar reward—which figure, on due Scottish reflection later in the day, appears to have been reduced to twenty-five dollars. It was generally acknowledged afterward that the fatal bullet was fired by Pierre Marentette, a Sandwich blacksmith who was an ensign in Thebo’s company.\n\n15. Prince did not arrive on the scene until after Hume had been murdered. Since the latter had been at Prince’s Park Farm behind Sandwich that morning before departing for the scene of battle, how can this discrepancy be resolved? The known evidence suggests that the two took different routes, and that Hume used the shore road (modern Riverside Drive), while Prince, perhaps on the lookout for a rebel descent on Sandwich from the rear, followed the frozen-over headwaters of the former Rivière à Gervais, later called the Grand Coulee, which originated behind the hamlet of Windsor (the site of modern Giles Boulevard) and flowed westward across the Park Farm before discharging into the Detroit River below Sandwich.\n\n16.

Lieutenant Dionysius Airey was a brother of Colonel Richard Airey, commanding at Amherstburg.\n\n21. Documents; Captain Thebo’s testimony.\n\n22. There had been so many shootings that Prince momentarily lost count; in his own dispatch the next day he wrote, “Of the brigands and pirates 21 were killed besides four who were brought in just at the close and immediately after the engagement, all of whom I ordered to be shot upon the spot, and which was done accordingly.” By placing their reliance on the dispatch, many authorities have since fallen into the same error.\n\n23. JPD, December 14, 1838.\n\n24. Observation based on the use of a recognizably different batch of ink.\n\n25. John Prince to Colonel Chichester, December 19, 1838; Documents. Edward Alexander Theller was a Detroit wholesale grocer, physician, and druggist who was among the crew of the schooner Anne at Elliott’s Point.\n\n26. SWH, January 8, 1839.

This was obviously not the best-advised sort of speech to make, and its motivation perhaps lies in a carefully worded introduction to its published form by the editor of the Western Herald: “On his health being drank with deafening acclamations, he addressed them in an eloquent and affecting speech, he himself being much affected at the time.” Prince and what he often called “grog” were by no means strangers.\n\n29.

Chronic symptoms such as Prince’s—frenetic activity and high self-esteem, in contradictory combination with withdrawal from the world, a desire to escape, feelings of guilt, and suicidal tendencies—have been identified with a psychological condition, manic-depressive disorder.\n\n3. Davenport’s given name is also frequently spelled Lewis.\n\n4. The name Park Farm occurs frequently in England, and so cannot with certainty be said to allude to the park lots at Sandwich. The property is not known to have taken its name from any previous owner named Park.\n\n5. In the sources Orin is also rendered Orrin, and Stanborough as Stamborough.\n\n6. However, in 1834 John Prince did present the Reverend William Johnson with a service of communion plate and a damask tablecloth for the use of the English Church.\n\n7. The letters JPWD customarily followed the name of any justice of the peace of the Western District; therefore in this instance they cannot be taken to mean John Prince specifically.\n\n8.

One such dissenter was George Duck of Howard Township in Kent, who although unnamed, was described in a letter to the Emigrant as a “quack” lately arrived from England, who had as yet “very few ducklings.”\n\n12. For the rest of his life Prince saw leadership as a burden, thrust on his unwilling shoulders by those who crowded around him. It was such an onerous duty that on October 16, 1836, he confided to his diary: “House full. Positively distracted with company. Worried to death. I occasionally wish for death.”\n\n13. At $25 a share, Prince’s investment was $12,500, an astronomical sum in 1836. Note also that the shares were sold in American funds.\n\n14. JPD, September 20, 1836.

Rankin, instantly recognizable even into old age by his own abundant mane, added his own testimonial: “I think (without presumption) I ought to be a good judge.”\n\n22. Attention called simultaneously to the mineral potential of the north shores of Lakes Huron and Superior by the director of the recently established (1842) Geological Survey of Canada, William Edmond Logan, and to that of the south shore of Superior by Dr. Douglas Houghton, Michigan state geologist, led to much prospecting activity in the area in the mid-1840s. Alexander Wilkinson of Sandwich was one who participated in mineral surveys at this time.\n\n23. The visible, architectural parts of this organ survive, preserved among the holdings of Windsor’s Community Museum. The Huguenot Church in Charleston, South Carolina, has a virtually identical, contemporary instrument by the same maker, still in use and “now one of Charleston’s musical treasures,” in the words of that parish’s history.\n\n24. George Moffatt, formerly engaged in the fur trade in the western country, was a Montreal merchant and politician at this time.\n\n25. Namesake great-grandson of Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs Alexander McKee; a brother of Rankin’s wife, Mary.\n\n26. Although development was pursued over the remainder of the decade, activity tapered off by the mid-1860s because the ore proved not to be as good in depth as it appeared at the surface.\n\n27. Prince’s own mining property of about ten square miles, southwest of Thunder Bay, was the subject of a speech in the summer of 1847. A silver vein on Prince’s property was worked, but not during his lifetime. The mineral rush of the mid-1840s led to the creation of a kind of Southwest-Northwest axis over the next two decades or so. Prince himself moved north in 1860, and there he encountered names familiar from below: William Bampton, innkeeper of Chatham and Windsor in the 1840s and 1850s, was doubtless related to Charles J. Bampton, Soo innkeeper in the 1860s; likewise Joshua and Joseph Coatsworth at Bruce Mines, and Caleb Coatsworth of Romney; and Solomon T. Thebo of Sandwich in the 1830s had his counterpart in Solomon Thomas Thebo, whom Prince encountered, first at Shebandowan in 1859 and later at Killarney.\n\n28. Deputy Treasurer Wood of the Western District Council had defaulted and absconded in 1848, and his possessions were sold at auction to pay his debt.\n\n29. Ironically, he had ignored this precept as recently as January 30, when he guaranteed the honesty of County Treasurer George Bullock. Perhaps he did so on the tenuous ground that Bullock was also proprietor of the Amherstburg hotel where the Masonic Lodge, which Prince had recently joined, held its meetings. Considering the W. R. Wood episode of recent memory, he should have known better.\n\n30. JPD, September 24, 1850\n\n31. In 1847, a projected fishing village on an old townsite where the Communication Road ended at Rondeau Bay was laid out for Prince, possibly in exchange for legal services, by a then bankrupt surveyor, Richard Parr. The village was named Shrewsbury, probably alluding to the Prince family’s ancestral home in Shropshire (Salop), England. Shrewsbury appears on William Billyard and Richard Parr’s 1847 map of the Western District, but not on the competing surveyor Charles Rankin’s map of the same year.\n\n32. The Great Southern Railroad was eventually built, but not completed to the Detroit River until the early 1870s. A decade later its operation passed to the Michigan Central, and subsequently to the New York Central, Penn Central, and, most recently, Conrail.\n\nChapter Ten\n\n1. Jameson, 2:30.\n\n2.

Nogging was material used for filling the timber frame of a building, concealed from view by cladding. The Duff-Baby House and the John Prince House both had brick nogging, whereas a decidedly humbler dwelling on the River Canard appears to have employed straw for this purpose.\n\n5. Several major buildings on the Canadian side of the Detroit frontier have been designed by Detroit architects. Assumption Church was perhaps the first in this tradition, built posthumously from an 1834 plan by Robert Elliott.\n\n6. In this type a partition runs the length of the house under the roof ridge, dividing the front from the back and necessitating two heat sources. Each stove vents via a stovepipe to a chimney at the opposite end, in order to radiate as much heat as possible inside the building.\n\n7. Guillet, 155, quoting MacTaggart, 1:310–11.\n\n8.

SCE, February 14, 1835; also WDM, January 16, 1835. The ice was commonly used for a wide variety of traffic, but the winter of 1836 must have been unusually cold. On February 1 that year two millstones weighing 1,800 pounds, plus the men, the horses, and the heavy sleighs required to handle them, crossed the eighteen-inch-thick ice of the Detroit River from the American to the Canadian shore.\n\n11. One such bridge, over Pike Creek in Maidstone Township, was described in 1834 in a specification by surveyor John A. Wilkinson: “20 ft. wide in clear between the centre cribs, there to be 4 cribs in bridge, the wood above water to be oak & bark to be taken off & to be last [at least?] 12 inches square, the flooring to be at least 5 inches thick & to be of good ash, on each side of bridge to be well filled up & substantial, the logs above water to be oak & 1 foot at small end & bark taken off, a hand rail to be made of squared timber & to be made substantial, the whole to be completed by the 6th of Oct. 1834.”\n\n12.

Since water levels prevailing over the Great Lakes are only grossly related to the amount of local rainfall, regional precipitation could sustain marsh conditions in much of the Western District during periods of low water even in the adjacent Lakes.\n\n16. Even as late as the 1840s, cross-hatching in pale blue watercolor over the road allowances was widely used on Essex County township maps produced by John and Alexander Wilkinson. This symbol, resembling railroad tracks, actually signified drowned land. The stabilizing logs seem to have been called facines—possibly a Detroit River French word adapted from the English facings, meaning rolls at the edges of a garment, which were fashionable at the time.\n\n17. So useful did Wood make himself to the district that he rose in the establishment of positions, building a residence, Thornfield, in 1842. However, he absconded to the United States with district funds in 1848, and his property, including his residence, was sold at a sheriff’s auction. Wood died in St. Paul, Minnesota, after 1856.\n\n18. Jameson, 2:27.\n\n19. Thomas Talbot to the Hon. Peter Robinson, Port Talbot, April 3, 1831; Coyne, 111. The result, present County Road 12 through Forest in Lambton County, turned out to be rather less tasteful than Talbot intended. By comparison, Talbot’s Middle Road, with its twenty-eight course changes as it kept to the height of land across a single township, Orford in Kent, must have engendered transports of delight.\n\n20. Shirreff, 195. The reference is to the Talbot Middle Road. Frogmore was the royal mausoleum at Windsor Castle in Berkshire where, three years earlier, George IV had died.\n\n21. WDM, July 9, 1834.\n\n22. Until recently a footpath crossing Turkey Creek along this mill dam could still be traced in aerial survey photographs, south of Sprucewood and west of Malden Road. A slight discoloration of the vegetation was caused by compacting of the soil.\n\n23. Shirreff, 197.\n\n24. For inclined planes Shirreff probably intended to write treadmills.\n\n25. The Montreuil mill’s predecessor on the site, probably destroyed by the Americans in 1814, had been owned by his father-in-law, Antoine Louis Descomps dit Labadie dit Badichon, and was the one at whose base the American force landed at the beginning of the War of 1812. Similar interstices in the sheathing of the Badichon mill would have given the invaders real concern that small-arms fire awaited them from inside.\n\n26. C.

A story persists of the destruction of the Colborne Furnace that resulted from an explosion at some unspecified date when wet fuel was thrown onto the fire in the smelting stack. This appears to be either pure speculation, or perhaps an embellishment of Patrick Shirreff’s account of the 1833 fire. Colborne, originally laid out by surveyor Peter Carroll, is the antecedent of the present Olinda. One author called Colborne, not Slag Town, as might be expected, but Stag Town, having in mind the number of male employees living on the site while their wives remained far away at home.\n\n31. Mackintosh responded that the Duke of Wellington was somewhat larger than average, 134 tons; most others ranged from 80 to 100 tons. The Wellington drew eight feet three inches when fully loaded. He considered this to be a useful criterion because even she could navigate the St. Mary’s River at the head of Lake Huron, barely scraping her keel over a bar at Lake George.\n\nThe Welland’s competitor, the Erie Canal connecting Buffalo with New York City, completed in 1825, was only half the depth.\n\n32.

For example, a petition for a lighthouse at Hartley’s Point, where the Detroit River enters Lake Erie, was declined.\n\n36. The collision and sinking of the Vandalia, off Point Pelee, on October 27, 1851, was probably typical, except for one point: the Vandalia was the first commercial vessel in the world to have been equipped not with paddle wheels but with a screw propeller. There is a suggestion that the Vandalia, subsequently refloated, continued to operate under another name, a practice that was not unknown at a time when diving bells were beginning to make such salvage operations possible.\n\n37. The shipbuilders’ response to the problem was taken from bridge construction: longitudinal stiffening arches, which became prominent external elements in vessel design from the 1840s into the 1860s. Later, marine design allowed the arches to be concealed inside. Perhaps the most mysterious of all the tragedies were those vessels that were reported “lost on Lake Erie.” It seems possible that after years of flexing, many of them simply disintegrated, even in fine weather, and their fragments simply drifted apart, became waterlogged if they were not so already, and sank without a trace. Even a cargo of organic materials could suffer this fate.\n\n38. The soap-making residue derived by boiling the ashes resulting from burning whatever part of the forest escaped being made into barrels, furniture, fence rails, equipment, vehicles, and buildings—not to mention fuel for the new age of steam power.\n\n39.

As early as 1821 Captain Charles Stuart, a retired army officer and abolitionist, had developed an altruistic plan for a black settlement behind Amherstburg. Stuart’s views undoubtedly influenced those of his nephew, Arthur Rankin.\n\n8. SCE, May 9, 1835. Sans culottes: without trousers.\n\n9. SWH, September 25, 1838.\n\n10. The trickle of black refugees that began following the War of 1812 became a flood after 1850, when the Fugitive Slave Act in the United States imposed heavy penalties on anyone assisting slaves to flee. In the Western District, black settlements came into existence not only in the townships of Dawn and Chatham in Kent, but also in Maidstone, Sandwich, Anderdon, Malden, and Colchester in Essex. By the 1840s, Baptist congregations were meeting in private residences, then in church buildings, such as those in the towns of Sandwich and Amherstburg a decade later.\n\nJosiah Henson’s dream of an exclusively black community was supported by the segregationist Henry Bibb, publisher at Windsor of the Voice of the Fugitive, 1851–54. The opposite, integrationist position was taken, however, by the Provincial Freeman, published somewhat intermittently by Mary Shadd, 1853–59, first in Windsor and later in Toronto and Chatham.\n\n11.

The disease, which brought about a severe loss of body fluids, was spread by a bacterium in contaminated water and food. Victims became dehydrated and, if not effectively treated soon enough, could die of dehydration and shock in a matter of hours.

The name Penuel, also rendered Peniel or Penniel, is taken from a town in (modern) Jordan, the scene in Genesis 32:22–31 of Jacob’s wrestling with the angel.\n\n27. In 1840 another trespass was described by lawyer John Prince as “the old story”; the next year he was in court again, charged with trespassing “again and again” against the same plaintiff as in 1840; and in 1845, below Amherstburg, he committed the blunder of trespassing on a property owned by John Prince himself.\n\n28. SCE, August 15, 1835.\n\n29. Phrenology, the analysis of the contours of the skull to determine personality, arose and became popular in eighteenth-century Austria.\n\n30. The subtleties of conflict of interest appear to have been lost on the justices. Sheriff Lachlan continued to sit in the Quarter Sessions as a magistrate, as late as January 5, 1838.\n\n31. Robert McMurray to Alexander and John McCormick, Gosfield, McCormick Family Papers, January 14, 1823; 20-148, MHC.\n\n32. SCE, January 3, 1835.\n\n33. Under the Act of Union Upper and Lower Canada were combined into the united Province of Canada; the division west of the Ottawa River was thenceforth to be known as Canada West.\n\n34. SWH, March 31, 1841.\n\nConclusion\n\n1. SWH, December 2, 1841.\n\n2. All went off smoothly, except for a squabble for the post of Sandwich Township clerk, between Solomon T. Thebo and Louis Joseph Fluet, the roofer, priest, notary public, conveyancer, general agent, etc., etc. There was also a suggestion that John Dolsen’s naming as district warden, announced by the provincial secretary’s office at Kingston, had been a patronage appointment of a person who was totally unfit for the position.\n\n3. Western District Council minutes, November 14, 1843; Western District Records, 20-248, MHC.\n\n4. Since their formation in 1788 the districts in general had experienced a long process of division, subdivision, and combination. The remote Western District was alone, however, in having undergone only one previous alienation, when the London District was created out of parts of the Western and Home Districts in 1798.\n\n5. In Canadian legal parlance, this legislation is cited as Province of Canada, 12 Vic. c.78–c.81 (i.e., the twelfth year of the reign of Victoria, chapters 78–81).\n\n6. Tilbury West Township had been tentatively transferred from Kent to Essex when Kent was provisionally separated from the Western District in 1847, but its District Council representative seems to have continued to meet with his Kent colleagues through 1851, when the shift to Essex became final.\n\n7. The Essex County courthouse was designed by Albert Jordan, of Detroit, and built by stonemason Alexander Mackenzie with his brother Hope, of Sarnia. The same team was simultaneously responsible for All Saints’ Church in what is now downtown Windsor.\n\n8. The Great Western’s connection with Windsor was the culmination of efforts beginning as early as 1837 to merge the interests of John Prince’s Niagara and Detroit Rivers line with the London and Gore Rail Road (incorporated in 1834 and renamed the Great Western Rail Road in 1845), followed by the reincorporation of the Niagara and Detroit Rivers line in 1846, its amalgamation with the Great Western Rail Road in 1847, a brief revival of the Niagara and Detroit River’s hopes of going it alone in 1850, the fixing of the terminus of the Great Western at Windsor in 1852, and the opening of the line, in sections, through to Windsor by 1854. It became the Great Western Railway in 1853.\n\n9. From this point onward a distinction had to be made between modes of transportation, with the result that a new expression entered the vocabulary. Long before the coming of the railroad, of a winter’s day one could take “the train” from Windsor to Chatham, but what was meant was a train of sleighs, coupled together and drawn by horses on the ice. From 1854 onward, to travel by rail one took “the cars.”\n\n10. The Michigan Central connected Detroit with Chicago in 1852.\n\n11. The car was not opened until the train reached Windsor. This potentially disastrous example of public relations was suppressed for months, eventually coming to public notice not locally but in the Montreal Pilot."
