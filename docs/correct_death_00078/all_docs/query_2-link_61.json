In 1896 he married Margaret Ethel Gladstone. He was a leading figure in the newly-founded Labour Party and was elected as an MP in 1906. He succeeded Keir Hardie as Labour's parliamentary leader in 1911 but resigned in 1914 due to his pacifist beliefs. He was re-elected in 1922 and became the first Labour Prime Minister, serving in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. His cabinet split over the way to tackle economic hardship brought about by the Great Depression. He resigned but was asked to lead a National Government through to 1935. He retired from government in 1937 and died later that year. His funeral was held at Westminster Abbey and he was buried at Spynie in Morayshire alongside his wife.\n\nBirth in 1866\n\nJames McDonald Ramsay was born on 12 October 1866, the son of Anne Ramsay, domestic servant.
