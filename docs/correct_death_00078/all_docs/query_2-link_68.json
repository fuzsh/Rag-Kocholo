    "text": "Pacific Scandal\n\nJohn A Macdonald was forced to resign because of the pacific scandal. . Even though he went through humiliation of doing nothing illegal he still decided to resign. At the time it was completely legal to give money to the people being elected to Prime Minister. Sir Hugh Allan had given $350 000 to help build the railway as he was the builder. But people thought it was a bribe and that lead to Jhn resigning."
