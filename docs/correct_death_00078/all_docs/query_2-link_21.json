    "text": "She found Kirk Parish Records placing John Alexander's birth in Glasgow Parish, the boundaries of which fell north of the Clyde, and crucially included the Brunswick address. It doesn't provide certainty but may help settle the debate.\n\nKevin Febers, one of the last owners of the Mitre Bar, between 1991 to 2002, says: \"It had always been rumoured that the Canadian PM had been born at either 14 or 12 Brunswick Street but we never really knew for sure if that was the case.\n\n\"The Mitre was number 12. The apartments were long gone, they were removed in the 1950s.\"\n\nThe derelict Mitre Bar is due to be demolished this spring but Prof Boswell says he has been speaking to the new developers Mace and Mercer Real Estate about their plans.\n\nHe says: 'I think there is in fact some growing recognition that there should be a greater awareness of Macdonald's roots in Glasgow.\n\n\"Mace and Mercer are very excited about the prospect of recognising Macdonald in some way whether it's through a simple plaque or a statue or some other feature of a re-developed downtown area.\"\n\nThere is already a plaque commemorating Macdonald several blocks away at Ramshorn Kirk where John A was baptised.\n\nIt was placed there decades ago by the Archaeological and Historic Sites Board of Ontario.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to have done much to raise awareness of his existence.\n\nPresiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament Tricia Marwick, who attended bi-centenary events in Kingston, Ontario, said: \"I think what is important is that we recognise famous Scots, people who've gone abroad and done wonderful things.\n\n\"Ultimately it's a matter for Glasgow City Council whether or not they want to honour one of their own who went to Canada.\""
