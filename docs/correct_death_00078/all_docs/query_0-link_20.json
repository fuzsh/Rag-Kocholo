    "text": "Born on 24 Apr 1885 in Nepean Twp, Carleton, Britannia Bay, Ontario, Canada. James McGee died in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, on 18 Jun 1972; he was 87.\n\n- from https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.2.1/39HY-J98 Saskatchewan history book - JAMES MCGEE MCAMMOND (by E. McAmmond, son)Among the many homesteaders coming into the Mountain View Municipality in 1905, was my father, James McGee McAmmond; born in 1885 at Brittania Bay, Ontario, outskirts of Ottawa, where he received his education. He came to Carberry, Manitoba in 1903 to help his uncle, George Shillington, harvest. In the fall of 1904 his older brother, Will, filed on a homestead for himself, S.W. 4-32-16-W-3rd and one for Dad, by proxy, on N.W. 4-32-16-W-3rd.The following spring, April 1905, Dad left Saskatoon with a team of oxen (Buck and Bright), a wagon, a plough and enough 12\" lumber to build a shack and arrived in the district now known as Engen. The ground was still covered with snow except for the tops of the knolls, which were black with ash from the fire in the fall of 1904. Not a tree, just space and the iron stakes which marked the land number. He spent the first night in the Kingsland area with Bal and Alf Carrick, who were living in a tent. Jonathon Armstrong was there and directed him to his homestead. Dad lived in a tent while he was building his shack, 10' x 12', with lumber and then they covered it with sod.That first year Dad broke 10 acres for himself and 10 acres for his brother, Will, who was working in the hardware in Saskatoon, \"Tackaberry & Norris\", and helping to grub stake Dad to get both claims started. He worked with Tom and Jack Henderson putting up hay. Due to the lack of feed they could only work the oxen half days and turn them loose on the prairie to graze. The only feed was in Henderson's slough. Tom and Jack were his nearest neighbours and Jack was the first to be married in the district. The water they used was hauled from Ernie Clarke's slough. At that time pollution was scarcely ever heard about.Bannock and syrup was a very staple part of their diet. Bannock is a kind of biscuit made without any frills, in a pan on top of the stove and was similar to the Indian Bannock and more like a fried biscuit.Dad had met Ernie Clarke at Carberry, Manitoba and as their homesteads were close, they did things together. In the summer of 1905 they went to Saskatoon to bring out lumber for Will's house. They travelled straight east to Wilson's, beyond Fred Ahren's, and there they got onto the \"Old Bone Trail\". This trail got its name from the large number of Buffalo bones seen along the way. Saskatoon was their nearest post office and was called \"Logan\". It was also the nearest store and so they loaded up with many supplies. A typical grocery list would be 100 pound bag of flour, rolled oats, baking powder, baking soda, cream of tartar, dried beans, salt port, Roger's Golden Syrup, Wagstaffe's jam, matches and lard; also coal oil for their lamps and lanterns.Dad could watch the settlers travelling west on the township line, just 1/2 mile south of his shack which no doubt helped somewhat to relieve the solitude. It was hard to keep track of the days, so one Monday one of Dad's neighbours came over to see why this Methodist boy wasn't working that morning. Dad had worked all day Sunday, thinking that Sunday was Saturday!Wood was scarce so they cut and hauled from either the ravines west of Herschel, or went north far enough to find native poplars. They called it the \"60 mile bush\". These trees were cut green in winter and hauled home whole, budded out in spring and seeded all the sloughs in the neighbourhood when the wind blew the cotton around.About 16 years later these same natural bluffs were beautiful at that time, especially in spring, and my brother and sister and I wandered around on holidays, shooting crows and gophers in their vicinity. Then when we were chilly on the raw spring morning, we would drop in to visit Ralph and Mrs. Bridge. This couple was without a family and seemed to enjoy the sight of kids. Mrs. Bridge would be churning her butter in a wooden churn or making cottage cheese on the old black coal and wood stove but would stop and get out the cookie jar and warm up some milk for us. This assured her of another visit on some future Saturday.Dad's first crop in 1906, wheat and oats, was not the best due to dry weather. Then in 1911 the crop was frozen. In the fall of 1906, he and Ernie Clarke went again to haul grain for George Shillington, who had now moved to Delisle, but as it was so cold (60 degrees below zero) for some time, they left and went to Prince Albert to work in the lumber camp.After the death of Dad's mother, his father and youngest sister, Lydia, came out west in June of 1907 to keep house for him and Uncle Will. They were a musical family and loved to sing. Will played a trombone, but unfortunately while marching around the shack playing sheet music on the trombone clip, Will's little sister stepped down into the cellar for a moment and left the trap door open. Yes, you guessed it! The trombone was irrepairable and Uncle Will sustained bruises but worst of all, their much needed entertainment in those days came to a halt.On one occasion Dad got a cinder in his eye, and had to walk 40 miles to Tessier to see the doctor, only to find on his arrival that the doctor was away. As he returned home, he discovered Nature had taken over, and the particle came out on its own.In the fall of 1907, Dad and Bill Martin worked on the Evan's threshing outfit, 10 miles east. In 1908, Will was married in Saskatoon to Aunt Charlotte, who had come from the east. Dad worked on building the round house at Biggar in 1909 and the same year his sister, Lydia, married A.O. Routley, a local homesteader on the N.E. 30-31-16-W-3rd. This was the breaking up, so Dad went back east and married Victoria Alice Bullman of Ottawa, on February 8, 1910. She was a spirited, hard-working, brave soul to come to these prairies without any guaranties of comfort or wealth and took her place as a devout mother, as I can affirm.These women had to be courageous. I will mention just one of the times she needed to be. She and Aunt Charlotte set off for Rosetown in a buggy with the horse, \"Old Tom Schemer\", hitched to it. As it was a long way to go, they felt the need of good progress; however \"Old Tom\" took them into Green Lake (Cole's slough) and by the time they were out and going they were wet-eyed, mosquito bitten girls!The following summer, 1910, Dad met with an accident which left him handicapped for the rest of his life. On July 12, he rushed from a sidewalk in Saskatoon, to subdue a frightened horse driven by a lady who appeared in grave danger. In so doing, the horse's shoe struck his knee cap and cracked it. Subsequently, blood poisoning, as then known, set in and by the time he was able to walk again, it had healed in a semi-rigid position. Looking back, I think of the problem he had doing chores in the deep snow on the old farm, but I never heard him complain.They had the good years and the bad (1915 versus the dirty 30's) and raised 7 children: Robert, now of Meadow Lake, Sask.; Filby Bedwell of Merritt, B.C.; myself (Ernie), farming what was known as the A.O. Routley farm, purchased in 1954, subsequent to the Routley's move to Ontario; Jean Oldridge, Saskatoon, Sask; Margarette Livingston, Hinton, Alberta; Beatrice Livingston, North Battleford, Sask; and Edith Hinchliff, also of North Battleford, Sask.Many a cold wintery evening was spent in front of the old \"Home Comfort\" kitchen range, while Mother took us with them into the pages of the fine old books (great for character building and sentimental value). Do you remember Nellie McClung and L.M. Montgomery? These books were bought through the T. Eaton mail order service. When there were no more books to read, out Dad entertained us in fine style with his boundless repertoire of poems, songs, stories and ditties garnered through his years. Many times we sang together the songs we all knew as mother played the old organ, which periodically needed new pump straps or old ones repaired. It finally gave way to old age, and other instruments took over as the young grew older.By 1918 the country was well settled, but then the flu epidemic struck, and many died on the prairie that winter. Our neighbours, the Pepper's lost their infant child and newly married daughter. In 1923, a gospel preacher, Gus Storey, came to Herschel and through his messages our parents renewed their faith in God, which remained their greatest treasure until their death. Not only did the gospel change their lives, but it had a definite influence on the lives of their children, who all chose to follow in their footsteps.The years of the dirty thirties were discouraging and hard, and in 1936 our parents, with 2 of the children still at home, moved to Ruthilda to try and make a new start. Unsuccessful, they then moved to Meadow Lake in 1937 to homestead once more. Unfortunately, Mother was unable to enjoy her new home for long, as she passed away in 1943, after a very short illness. Dad remained in the Meadow Lake area, remarried at Meadow Lake in 1947, and passed away in 1972, in the Senior Citizen's Lodge at the age of 87."
