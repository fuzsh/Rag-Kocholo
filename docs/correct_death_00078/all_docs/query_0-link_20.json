He went to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan as a young man and worked in a hardware store and then to homestead approximately the year 1905, ten miles northeast of Herschel. He worked in the hardware during the winter months at Massey's in Saskatoon and to homestead during the summer months. He lived in a sod house and broke the land by means of the oxen and plow.\n\nOn November 18, 1908, he married Charlotte Beatrice Farquhar in Saskatoon. She was born in Clinton, Ontario June 12, 1883.\n\nTheir daughter Marjorie was born September 29, 1909. The family settled on the homestead approximately 1910. Their daughter Dorothy was born September 12, 1915, on the homestead.\n\nDuring the early days of homesteading, William made a trip on foot to Saskatoon, which is one hundred miles from the homestead, taking three days to make the trip. After acquiring a team of oxen, he made another trip to Saskatoon. The farm consisted of a half section of land, and trees were planted around the area where the buildings were located. This made a good windbreak and excellent area for garden, which was always a great success. They had three really good milk cows, Holstein and Herford, and were able to ship cream to Kerrobert each week receiving a high grade for it.\n\nThe best wheat crop harvested was a yield of 40 bushels to the acre in 1915. That was what William called the year of the bumper crop. His memory was very good and he could relate the crop yield for each year of farming.\n\nIn the year 1918 they built a seven roomed house and red hip roofed barn. Cars became popular in the district in 1917-18 at which time William bought a 490 model Chev, and after the new house was built he turned the old house into a garage to house the car.\n\nA good spirit of friendship prevailed in the district and some highlights of activity in the community were picnics and a trip to Herschel hills to pick saskatoons.\n\nWilliam served as Secretary-Treasurer for Engen School District for many years, where his two daughters attended. The girls drove a shetland pony to school hitched to a two wheeled cart in the summer and in the winter hitched to a home-made jumper. From the time the pony left the gate to go to school she would trot the whole way there.\n\nWilliam farmed until 1925 and rented same for three years to Dave Hollingsworth and the family went to live in Saskatoon. During this time he worked at Stephen's Bakery. They returned to the farm in the spring of 1929 and lived there until approximately 1935 when they sold the farm and moved to Saskatoon and later to Edmonton, Alberta. About the year 1956 William and Charlotte moved to White Rock, B.C., where he passed away January 4, 1959. His wife then moved back to Edmonton, where she resided until her passing July 17, 1969.\n\nMarjory, their oldest daughter, was married in 1933 to a young businessman in Saskatoon, J.W. (Bill) Brown, Manager of Dominion Rubber. They moved in the 40's to Edmonton were Bill pursued the Real Estate Business and had a very good appliance business, Sun Appliances, which a few years ago he sold to some of his associates and retired to a farm out of the city, near Fort Saskatchewan. There he started up with his son-in-law, Peter Kozak, who had worked with Bill in appliances, but who's heart had always been on the farm. Peter is married to Marjory and Bill's only daughter, Oralee, and they have five children.\n\nMarjory and Bill's eldest, W.H. Brown, with his wife, Gerda, spent 12 years in Africa as missionaries, leaving there on furlough not long prior to Idi Amin's terrorism, and slaying of so many people. They later took Spanish and are doing a very good work as missionary co-ordinators for a larg missionary oriented Church in Vancouver, \"Glad Tidings\". Besides these activities, he is, with his wife Gerda, Superintendant of a Mexican Bible College.\n\nDorothy, Will's youngest daughter, who as well as had Marjory, took her high schooling in Saskatoon. Dorothy was active as Church Pianist in Elim Tabernacle, and there met her husband George Scott. Rev. Scott ministered in Viscount Pentescostal church for less than a year after they were married, due to his untimely passing. Dorothy worked as a secretary for a number of years in Saskatoon, and moved to Edmonton about the same time as the Browns, were she worked for a number of years as secretary to Premier Manning. After moving to Edmonton she met and married Mr. Lawrence Sullivan, and they have a daughter, Marsha, Mrs. Paul Ellis of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nThe Shillington-Kerfoot Family Tree lists William Oliver McAmmond's birth place as Britannia Bay, Ontario, Canada.\n\n251. James McGee McAMMOND (Barbara SHILLINGTON6, Ann KERFOOT5, George4, William3, George2, Thomas1). Born on 24 Apr 1885 in Nepean Twp, Carleton, Britannia Bay, Ontario, Canada. James McGee died in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, on 18 Jun 1972; he was 87.\n\n- from https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.2.1/39HY-J98\n\nSaskatchewan history book - JAMES MCGEE MCAMMOND (by E. McAmmond, son)\n\nAmong the many homesteaders coming into the Mountain View Municipality in 1905, was my father, James McGee McAmmond; born in 1885 at Brittania Bay, Ontario, outskirts of Ottawa, where he received his education. He came to Carberry, Manitoba in 1903 to help his uncle, George Shillington, harvest. In the fall of 1904 his older brother, Will, filed on a homestead for himself, S.W. 4-32-16-W-3rd and one for Dad, by proxy, on N.W. 4-32-16-W-3rd.\n\nThe following spring, April 1905, Dad left Saskatoon with a team of oxen (Buck and Bright), a wagon, a plough and enough 12\" lumber to build a shack and arrived in the district now known as Engen. The ground was still covered with snow except for the tops of the knolls, which were black with ash from the fire in the fall of 1904. Not a tree, just space and the iron stakes which marked the land number. He spent the first night in the Kingsland area with Bal and Alf Carrick, who were living in a tent. Jonathon Armstrong was there and directed him to his homestead. Dad lived in a tent while he was building his shack, 10' x 12', with lumber and then they covered it with sod.\n\nThat first year Dad broke 10 acres for himself and 10 acres for his brother, Will, who was working in the hardware in Saskatoon, \"Tackaberry & Norris\", and helping to grub stake Dad to get both claims started. He worked with Tom and Jack Henderson putting up hay. Due to the lack of feed they could only work the oxen half days and turn them loose on the prairie to graze. The only feed was in Henderson's slough. Tom and Jack were his nearest neighbours and Jack was the first to be married in the district. The water they used was hauled from Ernie Clarke's slough. At that time pollution was scarcely ever heard about.\n\nBannock and syrup was a very staple part of their diet. Bannock is a kind of biscuit made without any frills, in a pan on top of the stove and was similar to the Indian Bannock and more like a fried biscuit.\n\nDad had met Ernie Clarke at Carberry, Manitoba and as their homesteads were close, they did things together. In the summer of 1905 they went to Saskatoon to bring out lumber for Will's house. They travelled straight east to Wilson's, beyond Fred Ahren's, and there they got onto the \"Old Bone Trail\". This trail got its name from the large number of Buffalo bones seen along the way. Saskatoon was their nearest post office and was called \"Logan\". It was also the nearest store and so they loaded up with many supplies. A typical grocery list would be 100 pound bag of flour, rolled oats, baking powder, baking soda, cream of tartar, dried beans, salt port, Roger's Golden Syrup, Wagstaffe's jam, matches and lard; also coal oil for their lamps and lanterns.\n\nDad could watch the settlers travelling west on the township line, just 1/2 mile south of his shack which no doubt helped somewhat to relieve the solitude. It was hard to keep track of the days, so one Monday one of Dad's neighbours came over to see why this Methodist boy wasn't working that morning. Dad had worked all day Sunday, thinking that Sunday was Saturday!\n\nWood was scarce so they cut and hauled from either the ravines west of Herschel, or went north far enough to find native poplars. They called it the \"60 mile bush\". These trees were cut green in winter and hauled home whole, budded out in spring and seeded all the sloughs in the neighbourhood when the wind blew the cotton around.\n\nAbout 16 years later these same natural bluffs were beautiful at that time, especially in spring, and my brother and sister and I wandered around on holidays, shooting crows and gophers in their vicinity. Then when we were chilly on the raw spring morning, we would drop in to visit Ralph and Mrs. Bridge. This couple was without a family and seemed to enjoy the sight of kids. Mrs. Bridge would be churning her butter in a wooden churn or making cottage cheese on the old black coal and wood stove but would stop and get out the cookie jar and warm up some milk for us. This assured her of another visit on some future Saturday.\n\nDad's first crop in 1906, wheat and oats, was not the best due to dry weather. Then in 1911 the crop was frozen. In the fall of 1906, he and Ernie Clarke went again to haul grain for George Shillington, who had now moved to Delisle, but as it was so cold (60 degrees below zero) for some time, they left and went to Prince Albert to work in the lumber camp.\n\nAfter the death of Dad's mother, his father and youngest sister, Lydia, came out west in June of 1907 to keep house for him and Uncle Will. They were a musical family and loved to sing. Will played a trombone, but unfortunately while marching around the shack playing sheet music on the trombone clip, Will's little sister stepped down into the cellar for a moment and left the trap door open. Yes, you guessed it! The trombone was irrepairable and Uncle Will sustained bruises but worst of all, their much needed entertainment in those days came to a halt.\n\nOn one occasion Dad got a cinder in his eye, and had to walk 40 miles to Tessier to see the doctor, only to find on his arrival that the doctor was away. As he returned home, he discovered Nature had taken over, and the particle came out on its own.\n\nIn the fall of 1907, Dad and Bill Martin worked on the Evan's threshing outfit, 10 miles east. In 1908, Will was married in Saskatoon to Aunt Charlotte, who had come from the east. Dad worked on building the round house at Biggar in 1909 and the same year his sister, Lydia, married A.O. Routley, a local homesteader on the N.E. 30-31-16-W-3rd. This was the breaking up, so Dad went back east and married Victoria Alice Bullman of Ottawa, on February 8, 1910. She was a spirited, hard-working, brave soul to come to these prairies without any guaranties of comfort or wealth and took her place as a devout mother, as I can affirm.\n\nThese women had to be courageous. I will mention just one of the times she needed to be. She and Aunt Charlotte set off for Rosetown in a buggy with the horse, \"Old Tom Schemer\", hitched to it. As it was a long way to go, they felt the need of good progress; however \"Old Tom\" took them into Green Lake (Cole's slough) and by the time they were out and going they were wet-eyed, mosquito bitten girls!\n\nThe following summer, 1910, Dad met with an accident which left him handicapped for the rest of his life. On July 12, he rushed from a sidewalk in Saskatoon, to subdue a frightened horse driven by a lady who appeared in grave danger. In so doing, the horse's shoe struck his knee cap and cracked it. Subsequently, blood poisoning, as then known, set in and by the time he was able to walk again, it had healed in a semi-rigid position. Looking back, I think of the problem he had doing chores in the deep snow on the old farm, but I never heard him complain.\n\nThey had the good years and the bad (1915 versus the dirty 30's) and raised 7 children: Robert, now of Meadow Lake, Sask.; Filby Bedwell of Merritt, B.C.; myself (Ernie), farming what was known as the A.O. Routley farm, purchased in 1954, subsequent to the Routley's move to Ontario; Jean Oldridge, Saskatoon, Sask; Margarette Livingston, Hinton, Alberta; Beatrice Livingston, North Battleford, Sask; and Edith Hinchliff, also of North Battleford, Sask.\n\nMany a cold wintery evening was spent in front of the old \"Home Comfort\" kitchen range, while Mother took us with them into the pages of the fine old books (great for character building and sentimental value). Do you remember Nellie McClung and L.M. Montgomery? These books were bought through the T. Eaton mail order service. When there were no more books to read, out Dad entertained us in fine style with his boundless repertoire of poems, songs, stories and ditties garnered through his years. Many times we sang together the songs we all knew as mother played the old organ, which periodically needed new pump straps or old ones repaired. It finally gave way to old age, and other instruments took over as the young grew older.\n\nBy 1918 the country was well settled, but then the flu epidemic struck, and many died on the prairie that winter. Our neighbours, the Pepper's lost their infant child and newly married daughter. In 1923, a gospel preacher, Gus Storey, came to Herschel and through his messages our parents renewed their faith in God, which remained their greatest treasure until their death. Not only did the gospel change their lives, but it had a definite influence on the lives of their children, who all chose to follow in their footsteps.\n\nThe years of the dirty thirties were discouraging and hard, and in 1936 our parents, with 2 of the children still at home, moved to Ruthilda to try and make a new start. Unsuccessful, they then moved to Meadow Lake in 1937 to homestead once more. Unfortunately, Mother was unable to enjoy her new home for long, as she passed away in 1943, after a very short illness. Dad remained in the Meadow Lake area, remarried at Meadow Lake in 1947, and passed away in 1972, in the Senior Citizen's Lodge at the age of 87."
