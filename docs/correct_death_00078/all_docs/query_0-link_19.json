He subsequently lived with his family at Fort Colvile, Washington, and was sent to Lower Canada for schooling. He inherited the family’s farm at St. Andrews, Canada East, in 1853. He was in British Columbia for the Cariboo gold rush, selling out in 1862 to return to St. Andrew’s. Active in the militia against the Fenians, he was appointed a captain in the Wolseley Expedition. In Manitoba he acquired land in Ste Agathe, but became active in Indian affairs. In 1877 he became Indian agent in southeastern Saskatchewan and western Manitoba, based first at Swan River and then at Fort Qu’Appelle. He negotiated several Indian treaties and was part of the Qu’Appelle Syndicate, organized in 1881 among NWMP officers to acquire and deal in land. After the North-West Rebellion of 1885, he remained with a reorganized Indian Department as superintendent in the Qu’Appelle Valley. He supported Indian farming and was capable of opposing policy that he did not regard as appropriate for the Natives, becoming an Indian advocate in their continual struggles with settlers. Both his advocacy and his mixed-blood background hampered his promotion within the department. He was eventually transferred to Winnipeg to work as a clerk. He died in Winnipeg.

A small, family only memorial, as per her specific request, was held for Lilian Edith Margetson on Saturday, May 22nd, 2010 in the Chapel at St. Mary’s church in Kerrisdale. Lilian is fondly remembered by her two sons and daughters-in-law, Bruce (Marian) and Keith (Penny), four grandchildren, Ian, Mariko, Kiku and Joe and one great-grandchild, Emmett. Nephew Stephen Peake and nieces Wendy Doyle, Mary Scott and Jill Wright will also miss her as will her great-nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her husband, Alan who was the love of her life, and as well as by her two sisters Gladys Peake and Helen Wilton. Lilian was born in London, England, though the family moved to Lethbridge, Alberta, when she a mere toddler. She remained a prairie girl until her early school years, when the family moved again, this time to Vancouver. It was always with great pride and enthusiasm that Lilian would recount her life in the most beautiful city in the world, for it was here that she worked at Spencer’s Department Store and where she met Alan at St. Paul’s Church. It was those depression years that forged a great partnership and marriage. Lilian was an active and hardworking member of Kiwassa. She was a cracker-jack bridge player and enjoyed the theatre, ballet and traveling. Sports were a big part of her life and though an avid NHL fan, she was a diehard BC Lions supporter and a season ticket holder for many years. But Lilian will be remembered by her immediate family as the dancer. When she heard music, her toes would tap and she was known to grab you by the arm and swing and sway across the dance floor. No flowers by her request, but if you would like to remember her, please make a donation to your favourite charity.”\n\nBaby Margetson (daughter of Alan Richmond Margetson)\n\n“British Columbia Death Registrations, 1872-1986; 1992-1993”, database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK6G-V75Y : 8 November 2017), Baby Margetson, 1943.\n\nEnid Mary Margetson (daughter of Jean Francis Osborne Macdonald)\n\nEnid Mary (Margetson) Oram, death notice, Published in Vancouver Sun and The Province on Aug. 24, 2005; http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/vancouversun/obituary.aspx?n=enid-mary-oram-margetson&pid=14934099: “Oram, Enid Mary (nee Margetson) Born November 5, 1912, in the west end of Vancouver, passed away August 18, 2005, at Surrey, B.C.
