Is anybody familiar with this cemetery? Thanks! Mary - 23 September 2006 I lived in a place in Martinez, CA in 1957 called Starkey's Camp. It was located on a creek and was basically a row or circle of small white houses. The driveway was all gravel. I believe it must have been very cheap housing in that we did not have a bathroom in our house. There was a public shower room (cost a dime) and a public restroom. My question is: What kind of housing was this originally? I'm thinking it was originally built for migrant farmers and their families, but would like to confirm this. Thank you.

Can anyone guide me to a location or website to continue my search. (I have looked at many websites already.)\n\nI have an original \"summons\" (or notification) from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County, dated May 12, 1888. The document was to notify my great-grandfather that his first wife was divorcing him. I would like to check county records, to see if there is any more information on either my great-grandfather or his first wife. The (3-page, 2-sided) document is mostly legible and provides the town, month and year of their marriage, but the town no longer exists in Texas. Also, I suspect that his first wife's maiden name was misspelled. Any of this information, including her correct name would be helpful in filling-in the details of his life between immigration and marriage to my great-grandmother.\n\nThe clerk's signature is L. (B., I think) WITTINGER, but the deputy clerk's signature is not legible. A number at the top of the document is \"No. 1413\". I am not sure if that is the record number, or court number. The divorce is between Mary HIRT and Rudolf HIRT. However, her signature appears as \"Marie Hirt\". Her maiden name appears as either \"Arystin\" or \"Aeystin\". I have wondered if her name may have been \"Austin\". Other information from the document: Mary HIRT was a resident of California, and resided in California more than six months prior to the date on the document. I would appreciate any response to my query. Barbara Boucher - 9 April 2006\n\nHOGAN\n\nGLORIA NADINE HOGAN I am looking for the obituary or cemetery where my great cousin was buried.

She was born in Antioch, California where she lived with her parents and at least one older sister - Anna. Her parents immigrated from Denmark around 1878-79 and sailed around Cape Horn. Josephine later moved to Los Angeles circa 1918 where she married John R. REILLY who was my maternal great-grandfather.

His mother is Edith M Thorne, 8/11/1873-11/28/1952, daughter of John Thorne and Mary E Albertson who resided in Contra Costa County for a long time. Their grandson Charles Edgar Jones was living with them in the 1900 and 1910 census. Edith was divorced by 1900 and living in Oakland and working for the YWCA. Edith married a Charles Jones born about 1869 in CA. I believe his father is my gguncle, Charles Edwin Jones b1868 CA and died 1940 in Anchorage Alaska. He is found in the 1900 census of Alaska as married. He married another woman in Alaska about 1901. His port of embarkation for Alaska was San Francisco. He was a barber. The circumstantial evidence that he is the father of Charles Edgar Jones fits nicely. I can see a scenario where Edith and Charles have a baby, get divorced, child goes to the grandparents and Edith goes to Oakland and Charles goes to Alaska. Can anyone help me? Are there any Thorne family members still around that might remember Edith's husband and what happened to her son?? Cheri Astrahan.2 April 2004\n\nUPDATE: This is a follow-up of my previous query. Edgar Charles Jones, son of Edith M Thorne, was born in Lafayette, Contra Costa Co, CA on 7/3/1892 per his WWII draft registration. He was living in 1941-1942 in Sacramento, apparently single doing odd jobs. He died in Redwood City, San Mateo Co, CA 1/9/1969. The CA death index lists his mother's maiden name as Green, but I think this is an error. He is not found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses. Where is he? Why didn't he register for the WWI draft registration. Where was he between 1910, when last found in the census living with his Thorne maternal grandparents and 1941? Are there any members of the Thorne family still in the area that might know what happened?\n\nCheri Astrahan.21 September 2007\n\nJOHN\n\nI am looking for evidence that my grandmother, Alice JOHN was born in Nortonville, Contra Costa County in 1877.

Her husband name was John Kelly, they had two children Mary Ann (My grandmother) and Jim Kelly. They had lived previously in Nolm Alaska and got the last boat out during the World Influenza Epidemic around 1918. Ellen is buried alone in St. Mary's Cemetery in Oakland. I am trying to find any information on her husband John. I know he worked for Standard Oil in Richmond, and that they weren't divorced but no really together anymore. Her brother is also a mystery. He supposedly died in a home Little Sisters of the Poor due to alcoholism but I cannot find him.\n\nI guess if anyone has access to a census and can tell me if they show up on it between 1920 and 1960 it would be greatly appreciated. Also if the census reveals any additional information that can help me locate his death certificate, like a birth date, death date, obituary.

Married Margarita ESPINOSA on 4 November 1877 at St. Catherine's in Martinez, Contra Costa County, California. The Contra Costacounty marriage license indicates that Francisco was 26 years old and Margarita was 17.\n\nIn the 1880 Contra Costa County Census Francisco MARTINEZ'es age is 24 and Margarita is 19.\n\nFrancisco and Margarita had two sons, Francisco Alejandro, born about 1878 and Manuel Visitacion MARTINEZ born 2 July 1880. Frank Jr. appears on the 1880 census, age 2.Manuel was born several days after the census was taken.\n\nOn 12 Jan 1890, at age 9, Manuel MARTINEZ was admitted to St. Vincent's School for Boys in Marin County, his mother Margarita or Margaret was at San Francisco County Hospital. Since I have not been able to locate Francisco and his son Frank after the 1880 census I am assuming that they were in an accident at around this time. Margarita died in 1939 in Tracy, San Joaquin County, California. Manuel Martinez died in Marin County,California in 1950.\n\nHelen Eberle - October 1, 2005\n\nMARTINEZ I am looking for descendants of Maria de Mercedes Martinez who married Enrique Welch.

Thanks, Mrs. Dixie Young.27 July 2002 MAYFIELD\n\nI am researching the name of Uriah Mayfield, who left Adams County, Illinois sometime around 1855 and I believe he may have went west to California, his immediate family remained in the Adams County area of Illinois and is well documented in that area. His grandson, Uriah Lamont Mayfield was my grandfather. I have found a Uriah Mayfield, age 56, born in Kentucky, enumerated with the family of John and Polly Stern, on page 382, of the August 9, 1870 census of Township two, Martinez Post Office, Contra Costa, County, California. The census record for the Stern children reflects that the family was in Illinois in 1855 and arrived in California by 1858, which is consistent with the disappearance of Uriah Mayfield from Adams County, Illinois and may be an indication that he traveled to California with this family. His occupation is listed as a cook and would suggest that he may have been employed by the Stern family in that capacity; however, although the value of the Stern property indicates that the family isn't poor, I don't believe the property value indicates a large farming operation. Another possibility is that Uriah Mayfield was simply boarding with the Stern family and was employed elsewhere.\n\nIn any event, I live in Illinois and any assistance anyone in the Contra Costa area of Martinez, California can give me on the whereabouts of Uriah Mayfield would be greatly appreciated. I am particularly interested in finding out where he died and is buried, or if he he had any family in California.
