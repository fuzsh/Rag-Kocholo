His father’s name was Jesse J. DUGAN, and one of his brothers was Michael W. Dugan, my deceased father. I am interested in finding out about his life there: was he married, did he have any children, and are there any living relatives still in Contra Costa?

Barbara Quein. 18 February 2001\n\nI am looking for information on George Robert HEBER. Born 21-May 1909 Kern County California and died Feb-1972 in Contra Costa California. We think he was married 3 times. Once to Jean Francis ALFORD. She died 14-Apr-1956. We are wondering if there are any children from his marriage or marriages. Thank you, Karen S Johnson-Heber Kennesaw, GA (6 November 2004)\n\nHIGGINS\n\nHINKLE\n\nI have an original \"summons\" (or notification) from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County, dated May 12, 1888. The document was to notify my great-grandfather that his first wife was divorcing him. I would like to check county records, to see if there is any more information on either my great-grandfather or his first wife. The (3-page, 2-sided) document is mostly legible and provides the town, month and year of their marriage, but the town no longer exists in Texas. Also, I suspect that his first wife's maiden name was misspelled. Any of this information, including her correct name would be helpful in filling-in the details of his life between immigration and marriage to my great-grandmother.\n\nThe clerk's signature is L. (B., I think) WITTINGER, but the deputy clerk's signature is not legible. A number at the top of the document is \"No. 1413\". I am not sure if that is the record number, or court number. The divorce is between Mary HIRT and Rudolf HIRT. However, her signature appears as \"Marie Hirt\". Her maiden name appears as either \"Arystin\" or \"Aeystin\". I have wondered if her name may have been \"Austin\". Other information from the document: Mary HIRT was a resident of California, and resided in California more than six months prior to the date on the document. I would appreciate any response to my query. Barbara Boucher - 9 April 2006\n\n\n\n\n\nAm looking for Zayna Kindt HOLM and any family members.

Edgar Charles Jones, son of Edith M Thorne, was born in Lafayette, Contra Costa Co, CA on 7/3/1892 per his WWII draft registration. He was living in 1941-1942 in Sacramento, apparently single doing odd jobs. He died in Redwood City, San Mateo Co, CA 1/9/1969. The CA death index lists his mother's maiden name as Green, but I think this is an error. He is not found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses. Where is he? Why didn't he register for the WWI draft registration. Where was he between 1910, when last found in the census living with his Thorne maternal grandparents and 1941? Are there any members of the Thorne family still in the area that might know what happened?\n\nCheri Astrahan.21 September 2007\n\nKEELING\n\nKELLY\n\nKINGSBURY\n\nI am seeking information on Willard Belmont KINGSBURY.

As of 1942, he was at 623 Sixth Avenue. I am looking for Obituaries, picture, signature and any other information (stories, habits, education...) about Dr. Weatherbee, his practice and/or his family. His wives were - Almeda/Mada Young? (?widow of Herbert Young, b.~1881-d.May 23, 1966), Ethel Siple (dgtr of Peter and Flora, mar ~1919, div), Isabella (div.1915). Lewis had no children, but had adopted/step daughters - Thelma Weatherbee (born ~1913), Fay Belle Leroy (1897-1957), Patricia Franklin (of Santa Cruz in 1957) - who may be leads to more information. The Lincoln (Maine) Historical Society is gathering research for their next publication - our medical history. LBW is from Lincoln and graduated from our local academy. We want to include his biography but have gaps in our info.

WRISTEN is buried in Brentwood, CA. There was a long standing family tradition of keeping the \"C\" as the middle initial, and his intermediate ancestors may be buried there.\n\nThe family Bible of Thomas J. WRISTEN, the father and grandfather of many of these persons, is known to have been in the possession of Mrs. Eva OLSON (deceased daughter of Albert Chesterfield WRISTEN) of Brentwood, CA. The location of this Bible is now unknown. WRISTEN/WRISTON is a very unusual surname. There are approximately 250 WRISTEN/WRISTON in the phone books of the United States and eighteen in Canada. I have a family tree covering approximately 2550 persons of this family to share.\n\nCecil C. Wristen . 29 January 2002\n\nMarilyn Hansen"
