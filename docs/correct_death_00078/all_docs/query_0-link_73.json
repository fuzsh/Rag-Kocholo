Great-grandchildren, Hannah,Emelia, Steve, Kaden, Jason, Liam, Liev and brother Terence. Predeceaseby Peggy his wife, and son Steven.\n\nPeter was an orchardist in East Kelowna much of his life. He joined the Navy in 1943 and as he would say made it 20' up the jetty when war ended. He was a staunch leftist, and there will be a few who will recall some heated debates. He loved to hunt, fish, travel the backroads and build rock gardens. After selling the orchard and after Peggy died he moved into a little house in Joe Rich on the Radomske property; he loved the country life. He was well into his 70's and still picking apples for his dear friend Elsie G. In the later years living next to family, his great-grandchildren and drives up Hwy 33 were his greatest joys.

June 2005. :\n\nCatherine Dyson and daughter Ruth Dyson flew to New York and visited Alice Morad about 1946. Alice had been working for Rand McNally for some years prior to time as she spoke about seven languages and was useful to Rand McNally in their map making. Alice was living in a house at that time and also had a small private school that she operated out of her home.\n\nCatherine knew the whereabouts of her mother Alice as a wife of one of the directors of the orphanage in England where Catherine was raised had visited with Alice earlier. The wife apparently was very impressed with Alice's abilities.\n\nCatherine feels that Alice would have been in the USA prior to 1940 so won't likely be picked up on the (Canadian) National Registration File of 1940. A search for Alice Morad on the latest released census of the USA (1930) unfortunately has not been successful. A photo of Alice was taken during their visit with her in New York..

Settler Dies\n\nMrs. Florence Dyson, widow of Arthur Dyson, succumbed yesterday in the Kelowna Hospital at the age of 92 years. She had been a local and district resident since 1927.\n\nSurvived by seven children - most of whom reside in the city and district - 31 grandchildren and 35 great grandchildren, the late Mrs. Dyson was one of the earliest settlers in central Alberta, and cherished her membership in the Southern Alberta Oldtimers' Association.\n\nBorn at Swansea, Wales, June 19, 1865, she spent most of her life in England at Ipswich. At the age of 19, she came with her mother and the family to Calgary, going a little later to a homestead in the Red Deer district. This was in 1884.\n\nIn 1892 she married Arthur Dyson of the North West Mounted Police in Calgary. In 1904 she went to South Africa, to the Transvaal, to join her husband, who was serving with Col. Steel in the Canadian Mounted Rifles. He died in South Africa in 1910 and was buried there.\n\nLater that year, Mrs. Dyson returned to Calgary. She came to the Kelowna district in 1927 to live with members of her family and for the past 18 years she had been residing at her home at 766 Sutherland Ave.\n\nLeft to mourn are: five daughters, Mrs. H.R. (Nina) Perry, East Kelowna; Mrs. E.R. (Ella) Cherer and Mrs. Muriel Snelgrove, both of Kelowna; Mrs. I.H. (Nora) Abercrombie, Calgary; and Mrs. C.B. (Peggy) Boyer, Enderby, and two sons, Terence and Spencer Dyson, both of East Kelowna. Besides the 31 grandchildren and the 35 great-grandchildren, she also leaves one brother, Frank Hudson, Fort St. John, B.C.\n\nFuneral service will take place Saturday afternoon at 2:30 at the chapel of Kelowna Funeral Directors, with Rev. J.E.W. Snowden of the Okanagan Mission-East Kelowna Anglican Parish officiating.

We have quite a bit of\n\ninformation on Arthur and his family. I have checked it against the profile\n\non our Web Page.\n\nThe original material was filed by Mrs. Ella Ruth Cherer a daughter of the\n\nsubject. I believe the material was filed sometime in the 1940's.\n\nArthur and Florence Hudson had 7 children. Ruth was no. 2. She married\n\nGeorge C. Cherer. They moved to Kelowna B.C.\n\nThere is also a letter on file from two of her brothers - Terrance Dampier\n\nDyson and Spencer Dampier Dyson.\n\nThe question of Arthur's birth and death which are in the profile you saw\n\nwere provided to us by his daughter too. You wouldn't think she would make a\n\nmistake.\n\nI would suggest you make arrangements to visit the Memorial Building some\n\nMonday and check our records. We meet from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. unless its a\n\nholiday. Please give me a telephone call. (SEE No. below)\n\nYou might also consider joining our Society as you would seem to qualify. We\n\nwould appreciate receiving a family tree showing your direct connection to\n\nArthur and Florence. I presume your parents are Terence and Honor Flower or\n\nSpencer and Margaret Caruthers, as we only have the names of 2 boys and 5\n\ngirls and their husbands.\n\nIf you can provide us with a complete family tree showing the families of\n\nall your Aunts and Uncles and your cousins and their children. If you have\n\nchildren or grandchildren they should all be included.\n\nWould it be possible that any of the other members of your family would be\n\ninterested in becoming members of our Society?\n\nYours Aye\n\nJames A.N.
