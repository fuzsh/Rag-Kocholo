View Tribute Book\n\nJohn Francis MacDonald left our world on April 4, 2020. John was born in Washington Heights, on November 12, 1943, to Myles Joseph and Honorah MacDonald. He often spent childhood summers at the beach. He and his siblings sifted beach sand for loose change and sold crabs to workers on the subway extension line. John was known for being generous in all things and for a wonderful sense of humor. John had a big heart matched by a big smile. He grew up in a large family, where weekends often involved moving furniture in a small apartment to make room for traditional Irish dancing. John met his wife, Marguerite MacDonald (Randles), when they were 14 years old. They married in 1965, at age 21. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from City College of New York, and a master's degree in computer science from New York University. He was proud of being married for nearly 55 years - his dedication to Marguerite and life with her, filled with laughter and surrounded by good friends, was the defining quality of his life. John had four children and six grandchildren: Jonathan MacDonald and his son Eamon; Adam MacDonald and his partner Cat Spoerry and their children Maya and Connor, Meredith MacDonald and her husband Christian Spencer and their children Moira, Kieran and Niamh; and Allison MacDonald. He passed away peacefully at home, and he enjoyed many of his favorite things in his final weeks - Allison's cooking, Irish music, sunshine on his deck, laughter, and time with Marguerite. John considered himself fortunate and blessed to have shared his life with his wife and children. He also leaves behind four siblings and three sisters-in-law: brother Myles MacDonald and his wife Meg Shatilla; sister-in-law Sharon MacDonald, widow of William MacDonald; sister Ellen Hallahan, widow of Jack Hallahan; and brother Charles MacDonald and his wife Judy MacDonald; and sister Margaret Truszkowski, widow of Paul Truszkowski. He had few cousins, but many nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his parents, several aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews, and dearly missed sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law. He will be welcomed to the heavenly kingdom by them, as well as his beloved brother William MacDonald. John was a hard worker and dedicated to his family. His career in engineering and project management led him to travel the world, from his early days with Howe Richardson through his retirement from IBM. John loved meeting people from all different countries. His home was filled with international gifts. He truly cared about his colleagues, about their families and their well-being, and spent his career in management tried to lift up others and make opportunities for them to advance. He moved to New Jersey in 1975, raising his children in Bloomfield, N.J., before moving to Randolph, N.J. in 2003. John's family loved how he made pancakes on Saturdays and egg sandwiches on Sundays. He took long walks daily with his family to Brookdale Park, and that's where he shared his greatest gifts - companionship and conversation. After moving to Randolph, N.J., John passed countless happy hours at Shongum Lake. He was instrumental in assisting with his grandchildren as they were introduced to the sand, water and sunshine. He loved to cook, especially chopping vegetables with Allison, or grilling on the deck with Adam and Jonathan. John joined St. Matthew's Parish in Randolph, where he and Meredith were lectors for several years. On a trip to Haiti with other parishioners, he saw firsthand the great need for resources. He was very touched by seeing the dedication of the Missionaries of the Poor. Though John had already traveled the world, this trip to Haiti inspired him, and he gave very generously to support the health and education of the children of Cap-Ha√Øtien. John often prayed the rosary through the long treatments of his illness and found comfort in the Blessed Mother. A celebration of his life will happen at a later date. Gifts in his memory may be made to Catholic Relief Services or to a charitable organization of your choice that serves the most needy of the world."
