He served from 1867-1873, and again from 1878-1891.\n\nHis time in office saw the expansion of Canada from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts; the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway; the creation of Canada's first spy service, the Western Frontier Constabulary, its first federal police force, the Dominion Police, and the famed North-West Mounted Police; and he began the slow transformation of the Canadian Militia into an organised force. Macdonald was the dominant force behind the British North America Act and Canadian Confederation.\n\nWhile Macdonald supported suffrage for women and the Aboriginal people of Canada, he disagreed with extending the vote to people of Chinese descent because of what he perceived as irreconcilable cultural differences. Modern criticism has been raised over his role in designing and passing restrictive legislation pertaining to the Indigenous population of Canada, the implementation of the Residential School system, as well as his role in ending the Red River and North-West Rebellions.\n\nLegacy [ ]\n\nMemorials and Monuments [ ]\n\nGravesite [ ]\n\nMacdonald's gravesite in Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston, Ontario, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.[1][2] On 1 July 2020, two plaques at the site were vandalised.[3]\n\nSir John A.

Macdonald started a petition drive asking the city not to remove the monument in 2018, citing the statue's historic value as the first statue of Macdonald in Canada, and the first statue in Gore Park. There were fears the statue would be removed to accommodate construction of Hamilton's new Light Rail Transit system.[5]\n\nThe statue was toppled on 14 August 2021.[6][7][8]\n\nMacdonald Monument [ ]\n\nThe Macdonald Monument was opened on 6 June 1895, and was located at Place du Canada, in Montreal, Quebec.
