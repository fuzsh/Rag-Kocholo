Deceased was formally a resident of Crocker's Cove, being a member of the Dean Family and after her marriage resided on the island until the death of her husband and up to the closing of the lighthouse when she came to reside in Carbonear some fifteen months ago. During those forty-six years on the island with her esteemed husband and grandfather, Capt. Henry, she proved herself a devoted mother to a family that outlived her and lovingly lives in her \"memory sweet\". All who visited the island from time to time during these years will never forget the hospitality extended by our lighthouse friends. During her illness she was attended to by Rev E. E. Rusted of St. James Parish,\n\nLeft to mourn are four daughters. Mrs. J.T.

Mr. Forward was 71 years of age and for forty six years had lived with his family on the island, attending to the light-house there. He was active all along but bronchitis developed which caused his death after a week's illness. The deceased was well known and highly esteemed, his open and bright manner winning many friends who will deeply regret his passing. He leaves to mourn his passing his widow [formerly Miss Dean of Carbonear], three sons William and Mark of Bristol's Hope and Harry at Sydney, and four daughters Mrs. Gilbert, of Flatrock, Bay-de-Verde, Mrs John T Ash of this town and Mrs Frank Pike and Miss Fannie at home and sister Mrs William Godden of St John's. The funeral was held o n Sunday afternoon from the residence of his nephew, Mr John Forward, Crockers Cove and was largely attended by friends from neighboring places. Interment was made at the C of E Cemetery at Carbonear; the Rev. E E. Rusted was conducting the service. To the sorrowing family The Standard extends its sympathy.\n\nOn Friday morning, March 23, the Angel of Death visited the Light House on Carbonear Island, and took away the soul of the keeper, Mr. Henry Forward. Mr. Forward was 71 years and for the past 44 years has lived with his family on the Island, always keeping his light shining brightly to guide the wandering seaman home to port. A few weeks ago Mr. Forward was in to Carbonear and seemingly in the best of health, but a slight cold set in, which quickly developed into pneumonia, and before many days had passed the soul of Mr. Forward departed from this world to the heavenly home above.\n\nThe funeral took place from the Public Wharf, Crocker's Cove, on Sunday evening, and long before the appointed hour crowds could be seen wending their way from all the neighboring settlements to pay their last respects to one who was known and respected by many. The late Mr. Forward leaves to mourn their sad loss a large number of relatives and friends, to all of whom our heartfelt sympathy is extended.\n\n(Contributed by Renee Frampton)\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nIn memory of my dear father, Mr. Henry Forward, who died on Friday morning last, the 23rd.\n\n\"One less at home!\n\nThe charmed circle broken - a dear face,\n\nMissed day by day from its usual place\n\nBut cleansed, saved, and perfected by grace,\n\n\"One more in heaven!\"\n\n\"One less on earth!\n\nIts pain, its sorrow and its toil to share\n\nOne less the pilgrim's daily cross to bear\n\nOne more the crown of the blessed to wear\n\nAt home in heaven!\"\n\n-inserted by his daughter Mrs John T Ash.\n\nIn loving memory of the late Mr. Henry Forward, who died on Friday last, the 23rd.\n\nA happy home we once enjoyed,\n\nHow sweet the memory still;\n\nBut death has left a loneliness\n\nThis world can never fill\n\nWe miss you sorely father dear,\n\nNow that we are all alone,\n\nOur aching hearts are longing,\n\nIf you could only come home.\n\n-inserted by his wife and children.\n\nOther papers please copy\n\n(Contributed by Renee Frampton)\n\nGARLAND, Edgar Clarence - 69 Wolfville, died January 17, 1996 in Camp Hill Medical Centre, Halifax.

William Thoresby narrative:\n\n(ref. to Mrs Pike, Mrs Reed, Mr. Burt, Jonathan Moor, Mr Davis, Mr Taylor, Rev Stratten, Mr. Goss, Mr Kemp, Mr Israel, Sean King, Mrs Lilly, George Vey, more & more)\n\nhttp://www.mun.ca/rels/meth/thoresby.html\n\nBrother Hudson has sent me a sketch of the experience of his deceased wife, which I am (if spared) to read tomorrow after sermon. Feb. 5th. I walked from Blackhead to Adam's Cove, to attend the funeral of Elizabeth Hudson; she died of a fever which she caught when on a visit at her relations. I don't remember that ever I saw a more affecting scene than on this day; the people were afraid of coming near the corps [corpse]. When the remains of the deceased was brought to the door, the people stood at so great a distance, that my mind was very much pained, to think that she who had gone at all hours by night and day to attend the sick, and now scarsely [scarcely] any would come near her, who had been so kind to many of them when living! After we had sung a hymn at the door, I said to the women, if you are afraid and unwilling to bear the pall, I will; by speaking thus several came near, and at the church there was a great concourse of people. I read prayers and then preached; the people were much affected: I believe all were in tears. After preaching in the evening, I gave tickets to the society, and joined four new members: Lord help them to endure to the end. I have enjoyed a portion of comfort and peace in the past day - Lord make me thankful. I shall here insert a sketch of the life and death of Elizabeth Hudson, who died on the second of February, 1797: - E.H. was the daughter of Mr. Clemens Newell, a respectable planter of Fresh-Water-Cove: Here she was born; and twenty-six years ago, she was convinced of sin; from that time she sought the Lord in good earnest, and before long, the Lord gave her a sence [sense] of his favour, and shed abroad his love in her heart. She was now more determined than ever to wage war against the world, the flesh, and the devil; and through God's grace, she has been a faithful servant of Christ to the end. Twenty-five years ago, she was married to John Hudson, of Adam's Cove; they received each other with prayer, and in the fear of God; both of them were determined to serve God in spirit and in truth. The deceased has been diligent in all the means of grace, both public and private, going through all kinds of weather, frost and snow, winter and summer, to worship her God; and he did not let his faithful handmaid go a warfare at her own charge but frequently caused her to sit under the droppings of the sanctuary, and gave her that fruit which was sweet to her taste. She manifested an ardent desire after the happiness of all around her, often inviting her neighbours to come to Christ; she prayed with and for the afflicted and unconverted. Thus she went on till the Lord afflicted her body, and called her soul to eternal repose. She was confined to her room fourteen days, during that time, she manifested a Christian spirit, in bearing her affliction with patience and resignation to the divine will. The last words she repeated were,\n\nGod of love that hear'st the prayer,\n\nKindly for thy people care;\n\nWho on thee alone depend:\n\nLove us, save us to the end!\n\nAnd for ever, and for ever,\n\nAnd for evermore, Amen.\n\nI preached her funeral sermon to a crouded [crowded] church, the scene was affecting, all present were in tears.\n\nContributed by John Philip Newell\n\nHUNT, Lillian Grace\n\nBorn: Tue Dec 14, 1926, Hampton, Newfoundland\n\nDied: Wed Sep 26, 2012\n\nFuneral Service 3:00 PM Sat Sep 29, 2012\n\nLocation: Tinant Funeral Chapel\n\nOn Wednesday, September 26, 2012, Lillian \"Grace\" Hunt of Drayton Valley, Alberta passed away peacefully in her sleep at the age of 85.

This area then known as the Canadian Labrador is now known as the Quebec Lower North Shore.\n\nThe record reads, May Buried: William May of Point Rose, Fortune Bay, Newfoundland, fisherman of the schooner \"Ripple\" aged thirty years, died on the twentieth day of July, nineteen hundred and five and was buried on the twenty-first of the same month of the same year. By Me, J. G. Ward M.A., Priest, Witnesses: Thomas Morel and Edwin Grant\n\nAlthough it does not specify where the burial took place it was sure to have been the Blanc Sablon area, probably Blanc Sablon where there is an old cemetery by the shore. J. G. Ward was travelling in that area at the time, the St. Clement's Mission headquarters were at Mutton Bay. The other reason I know it was Blanc Sablon is that the witnesses were Thomas Morel who worked for a Jersey Co. in Blanc Sablon and Edwin Grant who worked for Job Brothers in Blanc Sablon.\n\n(Contributed by Sharon Chubbs-Ransom\n\nCoordinator of the Quebec Lower North Shore GenWeb / Coordinatrice du \"Genweb\" de la Basse Côte Nord du Québec\n\nhttp://www.rootsweb.com/~qclns/)\n\nPOSTED JULY 10, 2016 BY BILLINGSLEY FUNERAL HOME LTD.\n\nIn Loving memory of Mrs. Beatrice Moore.
