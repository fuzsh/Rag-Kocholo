Macdonald was the first prime minister of Canada who served from 1867–1873 and 1878–1891.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on John A. Macdonald or alternatively, you can download our 23-page John A. Macdonald worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nJohn Alexander Macdonald was born on January 10 or 11, 1815, in Glasgow, Scotland, to Hugh Macdonald and Helen Shaw. They later moved to Canada when he was five years old.\n\nHe got his basic education at the Midland District Grammar School, and at a private school in Kingston, where he excelled in rhetoric, Latin, Greek, grammar, arithmetic, and geography.\n\nHe had shown great potential at age 15 as an apprentice in a law firm (articling) and soon managed a branch legal office in Napanee, Ontario by 17.\n\nAt 19, Macdonald opened his own office in Kingston, before being called to the Law Society of Upper Canada two years later.\n\nIn December 1837, as a militia private, he took part in the attack on the rebels at Montgomery’s Tavern. The following year, he attracted attention after defending accused rebels, including Nils von Schoultz, leader of an attack on Prescott.\n\nAfter becoming a lawyer, he practiced in the field of commerce, also venturing into business such as real estate beginning in the 1840s, a warehouse firm for 25 years, and insurance in 1887.\n\nRoad to Political Career\n\nBeginning in 1843, Macdonald entered politics, serving as alderman in Kingston for three years. He was then elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada to represent Kingston when he was 29.\n\nAs a supporter of Conservative politics, he advocated Great Britain’s prerogative and state support of denominational education. In later years, he was involved in the creation of a new political alliance, the Liberal-Conservative Party.\n\nHe opposed the abolition of primogeniture – the eldest son would inherit everything if the property owner died without leaving a will.\n\nIn 1847, Macdonald served in his first Cabinet post as receiver-general in the administration of W.H. Draper.\n\nMacdonald then assumed the post of attorney general of Upper Canada and later on succeeded Conservative leader Sir Allan Macnab as joint-premier of the Province of Canada, along with Étienne-Paschal Taché and then with George-Étienne Cartier.\n\nMacdonald also played a key role in the Confederation of British North America in 1867, bringing together four new provinces of Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, forming the new Dominion of Canada.\n\nHe advocated a strong, highly centralized, unitary form of government.\n\nApplying his constitutional expertise, Macdonald led the drafting of a federal system of a centralized government.\n\nOn July 1, 1867, Lord Monck, the first Governor-General of the Dominion, appointed Macdonald as the first prime minister of Canada.\n\nFirst-term Prime Minister\n\nIn his first administration from 1867 to 1873, he was hailed as the “nation builder.”\n\nIn this period Manitoba, the present-day Saskatchewan Alberta, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island joined the Confederation.\n\nThe Intercolonial Railway between Québec City and Halifax went underway and plans were laid out to construct a transcontinental railway to the Pacific coast.\n\nMacdonald’s government granted provincial status, signed for a system of separate schools and the equality of the French and English languages.\n\nHis administration was not without controversy as he was involved in the Pacific Scandal where he was alleged to have received large campaign contributions in the 1872 elections.\n\nDespite the dismissal of the accusations, Macdonald was forced to resign in late 1873 and was defeated in the subsequent election.\n\nBut, following the business depression in Canada, new PM Alexander Mackenzie was labeled ineffectual.\n\nSecond-term Prime Minister\n\nTaking advantage of the ongoing political unrest, he advocated a policy of the “readjustment” of the tariff – this helped him return to power in 1878.\n\nThe new tariff system protected Canadian manufacturing by imposing high tariffs on foreign imports, especially from the United States.\n\nThe completion of the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway was seen in November 1885, during his second administration.\n\nMacdonald did not expect that Canada could look forward to independence from Britain and expected an economical partnership with the mother country. Yet during his time, Canada moved closer to independence.\n\nLegacy and Personal Life\n\nMacdonald was responsible for Indigenous policy: the development of the residential school system and the resulting famine of Indigenous populations in the West due to him capitalizing on prairies and taking lands for the railway system.\n\nMacdonald also tried to extend the federal vote to all Indigenous males, complied with the same conditions as other British subjects but passed legislation to exclude those of Chinese origin.\n\nMacdonald was married twice and had three children, two of whom died due to incurable illnesses.\n\nHe served as the Canadian Prime Minister until his death on June 6, 1891.\n\nJohn A.
