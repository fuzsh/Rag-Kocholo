In 1817 a provincial “Act to Establish a Police in the Towns of York, Sandwich and Amherstburg” gave the magistrates in Quarter Sessions the power\n\nto make, ordain, constitute, and publish such prudential rules and regulations as they may deem expedient, relative to paving, keeping in repair, and improving the streets of the said town, regulating slaughter-houses and nuisances, and also to enforce the said town laws relative to horses, swine, or cattle of any kind running at large in the said town; relative to the inspection of weights and measures, firemen and fire companies.1\n\nThrough the late 1820s and particularly the 1830s in Kent County the response of the provincial authorities to population growth through immigration was to open new townships in the north, and the long-delayed settling of the Chatham town site. At the same time in Essex County a new township, Anderton (now known as Anderdon) was created in the place of the Huron Reserve, and urbanization associated with the easy crossing of the upper Detroit River led to even stronger connections with Detroit.\n\nLate in 1824 came the beginnings of a change in the settling of Upper Canada, with the formation of the Canada Company, capitalized among its London subscribers at one million pounds. The purchase by the new company of all the unsold crown reserves across the province, for resale to settlers, held out the prospect that the government would have the funds to pay long-deferred war loss claims. (Probably because of remoteness from markets, land in the Western District was valued below that in any other organized part of the province: four shillings per acre in March 1826.) One-quarter of the clergy reserves in Upper Canada were similarly made available in July 1827. At last the evils of the crown and clergy reserves and the absentee land ownership that Robert Gourlay had chronicled ten years before could begin to be dealt with, and over time the number of united townships would diminish as their populations increased.\n\nIn 1825 the townships of Sandwich, Maidstone, and Rochester continued to be united for municipal purposes, because the latter two lacked sufficient population to elect their own township officers; and the Court of Quarter Sessions mandated that anyone residing on the St. Clair River, but not in the townships of Sombra or Dawn, should remain on the assessment rolls for those townships. In Essex County, Maidstone and Rochester were still united townships in 1832, testifying to the importance of the checkered crown and clergy reserves in these and the three townships to the east in delaying their development, blocking communication, and hence impeding cohesiveness, within the district. Reflecting this reality, in 1835 the clerk of the peace was ordered “to request the attendance of the different Magistrates at the April Sessions to take into consideration the propriety of building fireproof offices in the two Counties of the District.”2 Two sets of county offices, rather than the usual Upper Canadian practice of one set for the district. Once again separatism had briefly bubbled to the surface, but for twelve more years the issue would remain unresolved.\n\nEssex: the Huron Reserve\n\nHalfway up the Detroit, the Huron Reserve had remained since its creation in 1790 as an obstacle between the upper and the lower settlements, and it was a tempting target to those of expansionist sentiments. Any enmity between Sandwich and Amherstburg over the location of the district seat was dissipated in the face of the towns’ perceived self-interest. In August 1819 the inhabitants of the two vicinities joined in petitioning Lieutenant Governor Maitland to recommend the purchase of the Huron Reserve, for a number of reasons: the Hurons, although deserving of great consideration for their war services, were not the original occupants; the population of the reserve was no greater than ninety; and the land, which was of little use to them, was a barrier to the improvement and security of the Detroit frontier. Those signing the petition freely admitted to their private interests in gaining access to the land between Petite Côte and Amherstburg, although they suggested that the public-spirited reasons they advanced were sufficient cause to do away with the Huron Reserve.\n\nFactionalism among the native population, both inside and outside the reserve, was a significant factor in weakening their position. In 1829 an Ottawa chief from near modern Toledo, with Ojibwa and Pottawatomi support, laid claim to part of the Huron Reserve. The basis was the wording of the McKee Purchase of 1790, which conveyed the reserve to the “Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottowatomy and Huron Indian Nations of Detroit.” However, at a council at Amherstburg, Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne found that the Hurons’ exclusive right to the tract had been arranged among the native groups themselves following 1790.\n\nHuron Indians leaving their residence near Amherstburg, Upper Canada, on a hunting excursion, by William Bent Berczy.

National Gallery of Canada.\n\nThe outsiders having been rebuffed, several government offers to purchase the reserve from the Huron residents ensued, until on August 13, 1833, through the agency of Amherstburg Superintendent of Indian Affairs George Ironside Jr., documents were signed at Amherstburg conveying the reserve to the Crown, for the microscopic sum of five shillings.3 It was to be surveyed, in preparation for opening it to settlement, “as there are several gentlemen of means now in this neighbourhood who have deferred purchasing elsewhere, waiting an opportunity to locate on this desirable tract.”4\n\nOne contributor to the Canadian Emigrant was moved to quote Shakespeare in describing the Huron Reserve as it then was:\n\nFie on’t! O fie! ‘tis an unweeded garden,\n\nThat grows to seed; things rank, and gross in nature\n\nPossess it merely.\n\nThe writer, noting that the tract was inhabited by only about twenty Huron families, added these observations: “As the Reserve now remains, the law makes us but the servants of the Huron—he is exempted from every tax—performs not even statute labor—our indurstrious [sic] population, forsooth, must repair his bridges—toil upon his 7 mile roads—while the desidiose, painted Huron basks in the sunshine, and ruminates over his pipe how to gull us again.”5 The residents, led by their chief Splitlog, tried to get the best deal for themselves. They requested four hundred acres of riverfront land for each man in the tribe, which would have rendered the interior as undesirable as any other waste lands.\n\nThose natives signing the 1833 indenture, however, “Indians of the Wyandot or Huron Tribe, residing in the Western District of the Province of Upper Canada,” among them Adam Brown and Joseph Warrow, were nowhere identified as having any formal status as representatives of the inhabitants of the Huron Reserve.6 At a subsequent hearing before Alexander Chewett, John L. Williams, and John A. Wilkinson, six Huron chiefs then living on the reserve were present, a completely different group from those who had signed the document conveying the reserve to the Crown. The chiefs reported that in 1829 the government had asked two of them, Splitlog and Thomas Clarke, to invite those Hurons living across the Detroit to move to the reserve, but they had also received a contradictory proposition from the government, to sell the land. “We the Chiefs know that the Govt, of the U. S. drive off all the Indians but are aware that the B. Govt, are more generous to the Indians than that. The Indians are not anxious to go back into the Wilderness, but remain with the Civilized Inhabitants.”7\n\nThe young men of the reserve were negotiating with Indian Superintendent George Ironside Jr., without consultation with the chiefs. The chiefs, in addition to many other residents of the reserve, were opposed to the deal. They alleged that Ironside persuaded the young men to sign the paper approving the sale, against their will. Clearly there were two factions on the Huron Reserve: the cautious old chiefs and the headstrong young men. Over the next few years, probably with the aid of renewed agitation by the non-Huron signatories to the treaty of 1790, the contest was resolved in favor of the young. Early in May, 1835, the Indian Department’s remaining store of presents was sold off. By September the reserve was being surveyed into lots, in preparation for their sale the next spring.\n\nDespite a journey by Splitlog to Quebec in December 1835 to try to have the treaty of 1833 annulled, the Brown/Warrow (“progressive”) faction concluded another treaty on February 2, 1836, to replace that of 1833. This one was more limited in its scope, reflecting the dissension in the Huron band. The “progressives” undertook this time only to give up certain unoccupied properties, generally in the southeastern part of the reserve, leaving their own personal holdings as well as those of the Splitlog “conservatives” undisturbed. The description was cumbersome, however, and a more elegant solution, on paper at least, offered itself: the Huron Reserve would be divided into three blocks. Block “C,” the southernmost third (except the stone quarry), would be sold off for the benefit of the native population of Upper Canada generally. However, the northernmost third, Block “A,” would be sold to benefit those who would be left in possession of Block “B,” in the middle, plus the stone quarry in Block “C.”\n\nSplitlog was outraged to see two-thirds of the Huron Reserve disposed of without his consent. The current lieutenant governor, Sir Francis Bond Head, met with the Ottawa chief Charloe at Gustavus Armison’s inn at Amherstburg, where the proposal was cobbled together. Splitlog, however, refused to sign, leaving Head to conclude the treaty with the Brown/Warrow faction alone. The days of the Huron Reserve were numbered.\n\nThe difficulty over the reserve could be largely attributed to factionalism within the Huron band, but it could be ascribed in part also to perceived ambiguity in the treaty of 1790. Thomas Paxton of Amherstburg claimed Fighting Island, saying he had acquired it about 1826 from the Huron band as personified by the Splitlog faction. The conveyance of 1790 included only the mainland, not any adjacent islands, he maintained, so that he need not deal with the Crown.8 Furthermore, according to Paxton, the surviving document was fraudulent, a substitute for a lost original which, he alleged, made no provision for reserves at all. Nevertheless, presumably out of his inherent nobility of spirit, Paxton had paid yearly gratuities of £12. 10s. to the Huron claimants to the island. Shortly a rebuttal appeared: the notorious William Lyon Mackenzie was behind the Splitlog faction in claiming Huron ownership of Fighting Island, the statements regarding a bogus 1790 treaty were utterly false, and £12. 10s. seemed an odd amount to pay as an annual gratuity. Paxton continued to maintain that the McKee Purchase document was spurious, and the matter ended for the moment in a standoff.\n\nJohn Prince figured in the disposition of the question of the Huron Reserve. A group led by Splitlog spent a morning visiting Prince at the Park Farm, and on August 31, 1837, “The sale of The Indian Reserve nr. Amherstburg took place.”9 The area continued to be occupied by native families for some years, but in reality the Huron Reserve had become a township, which speedily acquired a name: Anderdon.10\n\nEssex County: The Southern Tier\n\nEarly in 1819 the inhabitants of Amherstburg petitioned Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland to be made secure in their land titles, since they had discovered “that in strict contemplation of law, the grantees have only an estate for their own lives therein.”11 There was no reference to the process by which they had made this discovery, the drive to move the district seat from Sandwich to Amherstburg. By 1819 that campaign had run out of momentum, and was lost. If the residents of the military reserve on which Amherstburg came into being were to be granted clear titles, there would have to be agreement as to the exact extent of their properties, and this could be accomplished only through a survey. Thomas Smith of Petite Côte, who had twice laid out the town of Detroit (first with alterations by Judge Woodward in 1796, then following the fire of 1805), was engaged to carry out the work.\n\nWhen the current commanding officer at Fort Malden showed Smith a plan of Amherstburg, the need for a new survey became clear: the map showed no directions, no distances, no lot numbers. There was a rough schedule of lots in existence, but it was so unreliable that Smith decided to divide the area into sections and develop a new lot numbering system. He had considerable experience with such situations, including the ruins of Detroit in 1805, and a dispute in Sandwich Township in 1816 between Julien Parent and John Askin. In Detroit he laid down a base line, “to regulate every point of the horizon.… This I attempted in my own Country, but failed; and I lament the state that it is in, still progressing in confusion. The lines travel with the moveable meridian, and my house today will become yours tomorrow, according to the system established by Mr. P[arent] and Mr. Askin.”12\n\nThe Amherstburg survey began on June 13, 1820, working north from the upriver boundary of the Caldwell property (modern Simcoe Street). The job was substantially finished eleven days later. “The Inhabitants as a grateful Memorial of this event named two of the Principal Streets and requested them to be entered on the Plan.”13 By July 3 Smith could reflect, “Here ends the Survey and mensuration of every parcel of ground in the Town of Amherstburg, and which was performed by double days when the Heat of the Weather was Intolerable, and the Inhabitants falling sick in every quarter.”14 Looking back on his task late in the year, he wrote: “The confused state of the Town caused a great deal of trouble and loss of time. Boundaries were altered—Property had changed names—Lots with two numbers, others none, many Blanks & the Proprietors unknown.”15\n\nBy 1822 the police regulation for Amherstburg, adopted in 1817, was found to be in need of strengthening. Thenceforth hogs running wild in the town would be impounded and, if their owners failed to pay the fine, the offending beasts would be sold at auction. (The law, in its mercy, did provide, however, that any profits realized would go to the owners.) In 1828 the justices approved amendments providing, among other things, that there be no firing of guns in Amherstburg without the written order of the local magistrates. Amherstburg’s importance was increasing. A market was established in the town by a provincial act in 1831, and wharfage fees were provided for by another. The justices accordingly appointed a clerk of the market to collect fees, keeping a quarter as his remuneration.\n\nDespite all of this, however, in 1833 Amherstburg impressed Patrick Shirreff less with its accomplishment than with its potential:\n\nThe houses are almost entirely of wood, arranged into streets at right angles with each other, and almost all bespeaking poverty and meanness. There are Catholic, Episcopalian, and Presbyterian places of worship, besides schools, and the population is about 500. Most of the inhabitants are of French descent. Trade is very limited, and thought to be declining. Every vessel passing up and down the Detroit comes within 100 yards of the pier, which is at all times accessible to the largest class. Fort Maldon [sic], a paltry mud erection, is situated on the banks of the Detroit, about half a mile from the village, and the military reserve around the fort, which is the best of pasturage, is occupied as common. Amherstburgh is one of the oldest places in Canada, situated in its finest climate, the best British post on Lake Erie, and in beauty and healthiness of situation, inferior to no place in America; yet every thing, with exception of two handsome residences below the town, seems in a state of listless decay. I have no doubt there are better days in store for Amherstburgh.16\n\nAnna Jameson, in 1837, found much to agree with in Shirreff’s observations of four years before: Amherstburg “contains about six hundred inhabitants, has a good harbour, and all natural capabilities; but here also progress is lacking. There is a wretched little useless fort, commanding, or rather not commanding, the entrance to the Detroit river on our side, and memorable in the history of the last American war as Fort Malden.”17\n\nThe reason for these depressing descriptions is clear: as the years following the War of 1812 became decades, the military importance attached to Amherstburg declined. By 1835 the town was seen (albeit by the Sandwich newspaper) as a backwater whose progress was impeded by the “worse than useless” Huron Reserve. If only the reserve were done away with, thought the Canadian Emigrant, the back settlement could be united with the front, which would “give to Amherstburgh a neighbouring Yeomanry, who will save it from utter dilapidation.”18 Indeed, so much importance had Fort Malden lost as peace descended that Barrackmaster William Duff offered the buildings of the military establishment for rent, subject to their resumption by government in case of war.\n\nIn the southern tier of townships east of Amherstburg, other communities were coming into being. William McCormick, who might be thought of as a small-scale Thomas Talbot, had property interests in Colchester, Gosfield, and Mersea (including his beloved Pelee Island, first leased in 1815 and purchased, although with a defective title, in 1823).19 As he acquired Pelee Island and other lands in the county, McCormick was developing a vision of himself as a landlord, and he drew up a list of terms to attract settlers. Those locating on his mainland properties were assured that there would be no rent to be paid for seven years, no tithing, and what were described as only moderate taxes. Furthermore, an occupant could improve his holdings or not, as he pleased.\n\nThe regulations for those who set foot on McCormick’s own part of paradise, Pelee Island in Lake Erie, south-southwest of Point Pelee, were a good deal more stringent. On Pelee, cutting timber or hunting or fishing without the proprietor’s permission were forbidden, as was allowing livestock to run wild. Dogs doing mischief among the livestock were to be shot, and persons doing the same would pay double the value of any animals other than their own that died in consequence. Matters pertaining to fences and owners’ marks on livestock were normally within the purview of a township, which Pelee was not (it was part of Mersea), but by his regulations McCormick arrogated them to himself. Pelee Island was William McCormick’s micromonarchy.\n\nMcCormick was a shopkeeper-cum-entrepreneur who had served as Colchester’s post-master and, from 1816 onward, as a magistrate of the Western District. On April 2, 1834, he was appointed lighthouse keeper on Pelee Island, and that summer the family removed their residence from the mainland to the island. Once there, McCormick turned his attention to lumbering, particularly the export of red cedar to Sandusky, Ohio, for use as railroad ties. After the Patriot War, during which William McCormick and his family took refuge on the mainland, they returned to the island in the summer of 1839, but his health failed and on February 20, 1840, he died. Some months before his death he drew up a will, in which he left each of his children three hundred acres of land on the island. No survey of the island at the time existed, and when the oldest son arranged to have it done in 1847, he totally ignored his father’s will and claimed much of the valuable timber land for himself. In retaliation, the remaining members of the family initiated a lawsuit, whose result was a verdict which denied all title of the island to the McCormicks. It was not until 1865 that the government gave the McCormick family legal possession of the island.\n\nWilliam McCormick’s lighthouse on Pelee Island began service in 1834. Its flame glowed dimly through the glass panes of the lantern, which would have been smaller than those appearing in this photograph, taken about 1909. Pelee Island Heritage Centre.\n\nSurveyor John Alexander Wilkinson received instructions from the Surveyor General’s Office late in 1839 to inspect certain lots in Colchester Township, “pointing out at the same time any particular advantages they may offer as the site of a village.”20 The bureaucratic mind was at work; the lots in question were the same ones that had been set aside as a town site when Thomas Smith first surveyed the New Settlement in 1787. Wilkinson’s inspection, carried out soon after receiving his instructions, revealed\n\nBanks on an average from 25 to 30 feet high, perpendicular & composed of Yellow Sand and gravel in layers, great appearance of Iron Ore on a layer of clay.… The land cleared about 43 chs. [chains] from the Lake to the Woods.… The bay has a point to the N. W. on lot no. 71, and is open to the S. E. & S. W. & S.… In the spring of the Year When the ice begins to move its direction is towards the S. E. and frequently from the effect of the wind towards the shore, which would be directly towards the pier, should one be erected, large piers with ice fenders could be formed, but It would be at a great cost. £5000. would make a good & safe harbour for Small craft.21\n\nLate in 1840, despite Wilkinson’s admonition about an indifferent, inadequate, and expensive harbor exposed to ice damage, he was instructed to produce a detailed survey. Wilkinson’s survey, carried out on September 4, 1841—almost two years after his first directive—elicited objections from the Surveyor General’s Office: neither his field notes nor his diary were sworn to, and his charges were excessive. Wilkinson’s reply must have been a model of its kind: affidavits had never before been required; wind and rain had slowed the work, “as also the local etraction of the needle by iron ore”; timber for stakes was hard to come by because the land had long since been cleared; and the miserable road from Sandwich to Colchester rendered the charge for wagon hire quite reasonable.22\n\nThe village of Colchester arose not so much out of real necessity, but as a community laid down where planning theory suggested one ought to be, with the result that soon its modest potential as a Lake Erie port was eclipsed by a competitor. In October 1834 James King, his wife, and two sons were passing through Cobourg, on their way from Montreal to the London or Western District, in search of a suitable property of one or two hundred acres. Their way was smoothed by a letter of introduction: “Mr. King is a Gentleman and a Scholar, being the Master of 7 Languages, he and his amiable Lady have for Several years last past Conducted a Seminary here [Montreal] with great Credit to themselves and to the entire Satisfaction of a large circle of friends.”23 By 1836 they reached Gosfield Township, where at a site on Lake Erie they saw the potential of a lake port serving the surrounding area. There they built a house in 1843 and a school the following year.24 There was never much doubt as to Kingsville’s name; John A. Wilkinson used it when he recorded his arrival at the spot on January 20, 1850, to begin the town plan.\n\nEssex County: The Northern Tier\n\nAbove the Huron Reserve, much of the activity associated with urbanization focused on Sandwich Township. Following the inception of the British Regime, Sandwich Township gained a block of British-style lots in the form of a parallelogram, behind the French-Canadian ribbon farms of the Côte des Hurons. Standard British two-hundred-acre lots oriented to the compass were overlaid later, when the two Talbot roads, which intersected at Maidstone Cross, became another layer in the sequence of survey patterns. Sandwich thus became perhaps the most complex township in the province.25 Adding to its distinctiveness was the blurring of the line between church and state. At least as late as 1823 the term L’Assomption Parish, or simply L’Assomption, was still in use to denote the settlement opposite Detroit. As in Louisiana, this was a blending of meanings of the word parish: both an ecclesiastical and a civil district.\n\nIn 1824 Surveyor of Roads John Gentle’s report for a realignment of the road from the town of Sandwich to Petite Côte was disallowed; a signpost was considered by the magistrates to be sufficient to deal with its mires and its windings. The issue was escalated when no less than the Grand Jury became exasperated with the condition of the road to Petite Côte, which they pronounced impassable even in midsummer. The problem, of course, was the low and marshy shore in the ancient Petite Côte settlement, which made it difficult to determine exactly where water left off and land began. As described, the farm lots in the first concession were of a uniform forty arpents’ depth, but the location of the back ends was therefore uncertain. On January 11, 1825, the magistrates found it necessary to order that the location of the line between the first and second concessions be determined by a survey, as a prerequisite to applying statute labor to open the road allowance. Two years later the justices went one better by ordering that roads be laid out between the first and second concessions of Sandwich Township, in both directions from the Huron Church Line. Even today the deviations of Malden Road from a straight line betray that it parallels the shore of the Detroit River—or what was arbitrarily deemed to be the shore. The road behind the first concession upriver from the Huron Church Line, modern Tecumseh Road West, began like its downriver counterpart by following a course that was roughly parallel to the shore, forty arpents inland, at the back of the Huron Mission lands and a seigneury granted in the middle of the eighteenth century.26\n\nThe layout of Sandwich Township changed substantially with the coming of the Talbot Road West. The ill-fitting parallelogram of the back concessions (see the pre-Talbot Western District map) was almost entirely replaced, leaving only the western corner surviving. Blocks of crown and clergy reserve lots were set aside, outlined in pink or gray, respectively, on the original of this 1843 map. Off the ridge given over to Talbot’s road and his settlers, cross-hatching in some road allowances denotes drowned land. Wilkinson Family Papers, Macdonald Historical Collection/Archives of Ontario.\n\nPatrick Shirreff, who had had to stretch a little to find kind words for Amherstburg following his visit in 1833, had to work even harder after seeing the district seat: “Sandwich is also on the Detroit, sixteen miles above Amherstburgh, and derives its only importance from being the county town. The houses compose an irregular street, running along the river, and chiefly occupied by French. The trade of Sandwich is more limited than that of Amherstburgh, and I do not think it has the same chance of progressing.”27\n\nNegative views of the town manifested themselves several times over the next few years. The Sandwich Canadian Emigrant editorialized that new arrivals would be welcomed as laborers and servants: “They have no opposition to dread from our present laborers, as generally speaking they are too lazy to earn any more at a time than suffices to purchase whiskey to make them too independent to work until the bottle is empty.”28 Two years later a meadow opposite the residence of William Hands was subdivided into twenty-four quarter-acre town lots, which, in the view of the Emigrant, would “add greatly to the Town, and if the example was followed by a few others, Sandwich would soon be aroused from its present dormant state.”29 At what in 1837 Anna Jameson described as “the chief place in the Western District,” with a population estimated at not much over four hundred, she “saw sufficient to convince [her] that Sandwich makes no progress.”30 John Sandfield Macdonald, at the time a twenty-four-year-old law clerk assisting at a Sandwich sitting of the Court of Queen’s Bench, had little to say in praise of the town: “on our side of the River are to be seen but a few scattered houses here and there, sufficient evidence indeed of the lack of energy displayed by the people of the Western District.”31 Clearly the focus of activity in Sandwich Township had moved elsewhere, and the elsewhere in question was the crossing, upriver.\n\nSandwich was depicted from Springwells, Michigan, on August 13, 1833, in this view attributed to William R. Wood, a would-be architect and art teacher recently arrived in the Western District. Mill Street bisects the town, with the adjacent Duff-Baby mansion dominating all. At the left, beside the windmill, is a building that soon became John Prince’s brewery. At the right is the 1819 courthouse and jail, as well as the English Church, with the Western District Grammar School, the “Stone College,” in front. Macdonald Historical Collection.\n\nLife on the Detroit frontier was characterized by a flourishing ferry business, and the ferries ensured that Sandwich Township would be more directly linked with Detroit than with any other part of the Western District. As early as 1802 Joseph Mailleaux leased a ferry, a little downstream from François Baby’s, to Etienne Pacquet. François Baby’s wharf, sheltered in the outlet of the creek near the east edge of his farm, might well have been in use as a public ferry landing by 1804. Certainly by 1809 it was leased to Jean Baptiste Bonvouloir, ferryman; Bonvouloir conveyed his interest in the enterprise to Jean Louis Biron in 1818. The service at the upper Detroit River crossing evolved into competing services with their Canadian landings on the fronts of the adjacent François Baby and Charles Ouellette farms, opposite Detroit. Jean Baptiste St. Amour was granted a license on January 11, 1820, to operate rowboats (sail-driven when the wind was right) running from the foot of Woodward Avenue in Detroit to a landing on the front of the Ouellette farm. Three months later, “Uncle Ben” Woodworth, of the ambitiously named Steam Boat Hotel in Detroit, was licensed to operate a flat-bottomed boat and passenger boats from the foot of Randolph. In 1825 Baby’s fleet, a scow and seven rowboats, was replaced by the horse-powered Olive Branch, which was brought from Cleveland by its owners, David C. McKinstry and Captain John Burtis of Detroit. The Olive Branch, a sidewheeler, was driven by two horses on a turntable set flush with the deck but enclosed by a circular wall to restrict their vision, so that it resembled “a sort of cheese-box on a raft,” not much longer than it was wide.32\n\nWhen the horse-powered ferry began service between Detroit and the Baby landing opposite, a change of scale as well as pace came over the cross-river connection. The heyday of the dugout canoes and flat-bottomed boats was over. For the first time a vessel existed that was large enough to transport substantial cargos, even loaded wagons with their teams attached, as well as numbers of passengers—which posed a problem that had not previously been of much concern to Collector of Customs William Hands. However, through the good offices of his friend in the provincial oligarchy, Inspector General Jacques Baby, a cross-border accommodation was reached that proved to be entirely characteristic of the region: “you may, until you are otherwise directed, permit the Boat intended to Ply between your Port of Entry and Detroit to pass & repass free from Tonnage Duty, on your ascertaining that the same permission would be extended to a British Vessel in the Port of Detroit to be so exclusively employed.”33\n\nEarly in 1827 the magistrates, sitting in the Court of Quarter Sessions at Sandwich, heard the petition of John Burtis, master of the Olive Branch, for an Upper Canadian license for his operation, consisting of the horse ferry plus a wharf and a ferry house at Baby’s landing. He maintained that several unlicensed people were already operating canoes and small boats as ferries, and further that no license had yet been issued for any ferry operating in Sandwich Township. Burtis’s application was referred on to the lieutenant governor, with a recommendation that it be approved—although Magistrate Alexander Mackintosh had a different view of the matter. Mackintosh hastened home from the courthouse that day to dash off a letter to Attorney General John Beverley Robinson, informing him that although Burtis was in reality American-born, he had been “whitewashed” as a British subject by François Baby, on part of whose property Burtis had erected his ferry facilities. Mackintosh added that Burtis had transferred his right of tavern-keeping to an American, deceitfully taking out a license in his own name; “This is the manner those fine subjects get to windward of us.”34 Mackintosh’s real reason for opposing the Burtis application was that he had an interest in St. Amour’s competing ferry, operating from the Ouellette farm, next upriver from Baby’s.\n\nAn 1821 view from The Ferry toward Lake St. Clair, by John Elliott Woolford.

Courtesy of Art Gallery of Windsor.\n\nFrançois Baby, with the unhappy experience of 1812 in mind, must have been particularly conscious of the importance of the site opposite Detroit. Impelling him toward the commercial exploitation of the crossing was the prospect that the Welland Canal, bypassing the Niagara River between Lakes Erie and Ontario, first opened in 1829, would generate economic expansion over the whole Great Lakes region. Moreover, Baby had the capital and the political connections required.35 The rivalry between the Baby-Burtis and the Ouellette-St. Amour ferry services continued, although Baby’s greater financial resources maintained him in the lead. The first steam ferry on the river (and the first steamer built in Michigan), the Argo, was built for Burtis at Detroit in 1830 by Shadrack Jenking, a resident of the Canadian shore near Moy. Originally intended to run the length of the river and north as far as the foot of Lake Huron, the Argo (two whitewood logs joined by a light deck, powered by a four-horsepower engine) proved unsatisfactory for long trips, and in September 1832, Burtis having leased his interest to Louis Davenport, the Argo became a cross-river successor to the Olive Branch. However, the Olive Branch did not disappear that easily. She was acquired by Pierre St. Amour (Jean Baptiste’s son), and continued in service from the rival Ouellette landing for some years—literally as well as figuratively in the shade of the Argo.\n\nBy 1831 the name Ferry appeared, as a term to distinguish the landing from the rest of Sandwich Township. The development of The Ferry or Sandwich Ferry into something more than a handful of taverns was assured by the arrival from Scotland, by way of Montreal and York, of James Dougall. Situated on the line of communication with Detroit, and blessed as it was with Dougall’s business acumen, the venture flourished. So profound was the effect of the new level of activity at Sandwich Ferry that the town of Sandwich itself began a gradual decline from which it never recovered. Later ferries reinforced this effect, beginning with Davenport’s Argo as a successor at Baby’s to Burtis’s Olive Branch, followed by the Lady of the Lakes, running every fifteen minutes, it was claimed, from the wharf of the Union Hotel (the refitted and expanded premises of the late Pierre St. Amour at the rival Ouellette landing) in 1834. Davenport’s United replaced the Argo beginning in 1836, so it must have been the United that Anna Jameson described as “A pretty little steamer, gaily painted, with streamers flying, and shaded by an awning.”36 Baby’s own Alliance appeared in 1842, and a second Argo entered service in 1848.37\n\nOn April 10, 1832, the petition of fifty-four people was laid before the Western District Court of Quarter Sessions, calling for the realignment of the road in front of François Baby’s, together with a report on the subject by Surveyor of Highways William Elliott. After some alterations, the next day the magistrates gave their approval. Although Elliott’s report has been lost, both the nature and the purpose of the realignment seem clear. The straightening of the river road, formerly a path following the curving crest of the riverbank, was related to the laying out of a village plot on Baby’s river frontage, on farm lots 79 and 80. The new alignment, back from the crest, increased the profitability of the venture by permitting the sale of building lots on the north side of the street as well as the south. The plot, designed by none other than Thomas Smith, then living out his old age in Petite Cote, was no doubt at least partly motivated by Baby’s desire to profit from a new immigration, already happily personified by just such as James Dougall.\n\nInsertion for a fee seems evident in this 1837 lithograph, City of Detroit, Michigan, Taken from the Canada shore near the Ferry, by W. J. Bennett. Although most of the vessels are larger than life, and prominently named, one, unidentified, in the middle distance on the right, is a modestly scaled twin-stacked sidewheeler with a tentlike structure on its upper deck. This is probably the new ferry United, which carried Anna Jameson during her visit. In the foreground is James Dougall’s wharf, but not his store with its sign; perhaps Dougall also resisted paying for inclusion. Courtesy of the Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library.\n\nSmith’s plan was distinguished by its modesty as well as its simplicity; its chief feature was that its long axis was parallel to the river, with a lane leading down to Baby’s landing at the east edge of his farm.38 On August 6, 1832, Baby succeeded in selling his first village lots, near the ferry landing, to a blacksmith, wheelwright, and wagon maker named James Austen.39 Vital Ouellette (son of Charles, who had died of cholera on August 4) was not far behind; on Christmas Eve Joseph McDougall, another entrepreneur recently arrived in the District, acquired an acre of Ouellette’s lot 81 fronting on the river. However, before implementing his plan he must have seen greater opportunity nearby. Within three years McDougall took action that fundamentally altered the way the community was evolving.\n\nThe Quarter Sessions’ constant struggle with the maintenance of roads and bridges must have been a concern to settlements such as François Baby’s, at The Ferry. In 1832 the Sandwich Canadian Emigrant editorialized that the road masters had been negligent in allowing bridges along the river road, including the one at Baby’s, to go unrepaired. It appears that no less than François’s own nephew, Surrogate Court Registrar Charles Baby, had been trotting his horse across the bridge when the unfortunate animal fell through a hole in the west end, throwing the younger Baby and dropping him seventeen and a half feet onto his back at the bottom of the ravine. This was one of three such holes in the same rotting structure. Two years went by, and still no repair; in 1834 the Emigrant noted that the bridge had fallen away along both edges, leaving only a narrow passage along its median.\n\nNevertheless, Baby’s village plot was soon expanded, across the front of his own residence, as far as the western edge of his property. Two new streets forming a cross were laid out, called Assumption and Church, oriented toward Assumption Church in a gesture apparently meant to demonstrate Baby’s power in the parish.40 The hamlet was off to a solid beginning. Even in 1833 Sandwich Ferry impressed Patrick Shirreff more positively than had any other community in the district:\n\nAbout a mile and a half above Sandwich is the ferry at Detroit, at which there are fifteen or twenty houses on the Canadian side of the river, and several brick buildings were being erected at the time of my visit. This place will soon eclipse Sandwich, and may rival Chatham. Detroit is the great market of Western Canada, and the ferry possesses advantages, in proximity and access during winter, above every other situation.41\n\nBy 1835 Sandwich Ferry could boast a population of perhaps two hundred. Beginning with Austen’s wagon and blacksmith shop—to which a lumberyard was soon added—stores, taverns, a shoe shop, a sheet metal shop, tailors, bakeries, a brewery, a carpentry shop, and a saddlery all sprouted up. This growth attested to the economic buoyancy of the times. Richmond, as Sandwich Ferry or Sandwich Steam Ferry was being called by 1835 (other names in contention had been Belle Vue or Belle-Vue, Montpelier, and, in tongue-in-cheek deference to its preeminent citizen, Babylon), was the nucleus of a scattering of occupancies spreading out along the river road from Verhoeff and Jasperson’s store, warehouse, and forwarding establishment on farm lot 87 (roughly Glengarry Avenue) on the east to John G. Watson’s similar operation on lot 75 (Crawford Avenue) on the west. Where only a few months previously, according to the Sandwich Canadian Emigrant, the place had been hard to distinguish from the adjacent farms, it had become a flourishing town, offering good fare, splendid taverns, and handsome accommodations to overnight guests such as families on their way to Michigan. Included among the noted establishments were the old St. Amour stand; Joseph House’s new Mansion House; the former Labalaine’s (by 1835 ferry master John McLane’s) Pig & Tinder Box; Robert Mason’s Crown & Anchor Tavern; and William Murray and Lemuel Crawford’s Pavilion House.42 Prominent among the mercantile operations related to the docking facilities were the grocery and provision store of L. and H. Davenport, and the store, warehouse, wharf, and forwarding establishment of J. and J. Dougall.\n\nYet, trouble was brewing in Richmond. On July 14, 1835, François Baby’s petition to the lieutenant governor for the water lots in front of his farm was endorsed by the magistrates, who noted that “the Water lot or lots opposite the land still unsold by him and in his possession will not be attended with any inconvenience to the Public.”43 How wrong they were. Title to Baby’s water lots would enable him to charge tenants for the use of facilities built on the shore, and would also interfere with the competing ferry on the adjacent Ouellette farm. The Ouellette ferry’s figure-eight course would have made approaching its mooring almost impossible without encroaching on Baby’s water lots. The ferries followed a figure-eight route, in order to be heading into the current as they eased toward their landings on each shore. Such a course also carried them across the strongest part of the current, midstream, with minimum effort. That summer John A. Wilkinson laid before the Quarter Sessions, in response to the petition of more than twelve freeholders of Sandwich Township, his survey of a road from the main highway in Richmond to the public ferry wharf, as near to the line between lots 80 and 81 as possible, between the Mansion House, on the Ouellette farm, and the Pavilion House, on François Baby’s.44 “I have been informed,” wrote Wilkinson, “that this Road has not only been in Use as a public highway for Many Years, but that Statute Labour has been expended in reducing the Hill and making the Road passable. It appears that Mr. Baby intends to shut up this road if not prevented by the Magistrates.”45 Baby appears to have had plans for his frontage that did not include access from the Mansion House to his wharf; in his view the road was privately owned and he could do as he pleased with it. On August 22 the magistrates “Ordered, that a complaint … grounded on the Information of Joseph House [proprietor of the Mansion House] for a supposed stopping up of a High way leading to the Ferry in the Township of Sandwich be discharged, the Court being of opinion that it has no jurisdiction in the Case.”46\n\nLess than two years after Joseph House had bought property on the Ouellette farm and built his Mansion House, he had had enough, and on April 13, 1836, he sold out to two newcomers, John Drew and John Dods. The ultimate trigger could well have come that February, with Baby’s acquisition of title to the water lots in front of his (Baby’s) property. At first the new owners of the Mansion House joined in the game, buying a property on Baby’s side of the line, behind Austen’s wagon shop. However, relations soon deteriorated, and Baby found himself charged with maintaining a nuisance, in the form of two trees left standing since 1832 in the realigned road allowance across his frontage.47 For good measure, William Murray, the proprietor of the Pavilion House, was charged with keeping a bear in a cage outside his premises, to the discomfiture of passersby.\n\nYet these annoyances were the connivings of amateurs, who soon discovered that they were dealing with a professional. As feared, Baby blocked all public access from the road to the ferry landing by adding another building astraddle the pathway between the Pavilion House on his side of the line and the Mansion House on Ouellette’s, forcing traffic to use a new route down the bank west of the Pavilion House and well away from Ouellette’s ferry landing. To compound the mischief, Baby had a high fence built on the lot line, blocking virtually all light from the windows on the westerly face of the Mansion House, an L-shaped building whose longer arm abutted the same line. The process culminated in the case of Drew et al. v. Baby, heard in the Court of Queen’s Bench on September 10, 1840. Baby, as the Sandwich Western Herald reported, had been\n\ninduced, from motives and considerations best known to himself, to build an addition and a screen to the house now known as the “British Queen,” which addition and screen occupied the whole of the ground used for so long a period as a public highway.… After having occupied the Court for nearly a whole day, the case was left in the hands of the Jury, who found a verdict of two hundred and fifty pounds damages for the plaintiffs.48\n\nRetrials ensued, but in 1841 the presiding judge found Baby guilty of “a very injudicious and high-handed act, deliberately committed by him, with a view to advance his own interest at the expence of his neighbour,” and upheld the award.49\n\nBaby, perhaps something less than contrite, carried on with his own plans for Windsor’s development. He built the ferry Alliance and in 1843 obtained a lease in his own name for its operation. In June 1845 he had surveys carried out for a new ferry landing. The result was that on December 28, 1849, notice was given of Baby’s application to stop up the old road leading to the landing on the line between farm lots 80 and 81, because of a new road he had opened about twenty yards to the west, where his tormenters on the Ouellette farm could no longer annoy him. The new road even had a name; Ferry Street had been born.50\n\nMeanwhile, on September 23, 1835, surveyor Wilkinson had been working for Joseph McDougall on an assignment that eventually proved at least as important as the one carried out by Thomas Smith for François Baby three years earlier: “Laid off Lot No. 85 in the 1st Con. of Sandwich, in a town plot.… The street through centre of lot called McDougall Street.”51 In addition, several cross streets extended as far as the side lines of the lot. When the justices of the peace approved McDougall Street they set the future community at the crossing on a course that it would follow for generations. Whereas the long axis of the Baby subdivision ran crosswise of Baby’s property, lots 79 and 80, and was thereby limited to their combined width, McDougall’s ran lengthwise of his single farm lot, and could be repeated far back into the interior, with cross streets extending as far as the side lines wherever desired. Moreover, it could be duplicated on adjacent lots, and that is precisely what eventually happened. The McDougall model was reproduced endlessly in the future Windsor, even in the interior behind the original Baby pattern.52\n\nThe infant Windsor was, in the language of the day, “a go-ahead town.” Railroad fever was beginning to grip the populace. The railroad in prospect in 1836 would run between the Niagara and Detroit Rivers. Along the shore in Sandwich Township, those proprietors farthest to the east fancied themselves to be in the best position to profit from a connection with Detroit.53 There was talk of a twenty-thousand-dollar “Railroad Mansion House” to be built at McDougall’s South Detroit development. Joseph McDougall was selling individual building lots in his subdivision at one hundred to six hundred dollars each. The Emigrant reported that whereas two years earlier a typical farm in the first concession between Sandwich and The Ferry brought £375–500, in 1836 a farm could not be had for less than £2,000. The buyers were reported to be American speculators, each vying for the most advantageous position in advance of the coming of the railroad.\n\nMcDougall’s layout, dubbed South Detroit, for a time added to the profusion of names attached to the burgeoning cluster of would-be communities at the crossing. However, it must have been obvious that these hamlets would soon coalesce, and that a single name would have to be agreed upon. Accordingly, a meeting in Hutton’s Tavern on September 10, 1836, called “for the purpose of naming the village at the Ferry … resulted in its being called WINDSOR.”54\n\nThe river road was characterized in various ways during Windsor’s birth process, “main” (whether as an adjective or a proper noun) being a common factor: Main Street, the main highway, the Main Road, and the like. However, a change came about, seemingly in 1839. On December 7 surveyor John A. Wilkinson referred to “Sandwich Street,” and thereafter Sandwich Street it was.55\n\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s, while the fundamental shift in focus upriver from the town of Sandwich to the crossing was taking place, many of the roads in the Windsor area that are now taken for granted were coming into existence. The process began with a road leading to a settlement well back from the river, in the second concession. The Grand Marais, the great marsh, that in the 1790s had connected Little River with Turkey Creek in Sandwich Township, must have been marginally navigable water at least through the first decade of the nineteenth century. Enlarging the channel to improve surface drainage from its vicinity could well have improved navigation for a time, but once the marsh was drained, the channel, having lost its water supply, would have diminished rapidly, and the community strung along its banks would have found itself isolated from the rest of the settlement. On July 9, 1821, John Gentle, surveyor of roads for Essex, reported to the magistrates assembled in the Court of Quarter Sessions that “the Road on the Marrai” was laid out, as close to the ditch as possible. The justices approved the road, but ruled that the farmers’ side-line fences could be left up until the grain was harvested that autumn. Grand Marais Road is, therefore, perhaps surprisingly, one of the oldest roads in Windsor.\n\nIn July 1827 Surveyor of Highways William Elliott reported to the Quarter Sessions that, in response to a petition, he had traced a path for the continuation of the Talbot Road West from the Irish Settlement to Bedford Street in Sandwich, by way of the Huron Church Line and Centre Street (respectively, present Oldcastle, Sandwich Street, Huron Church Road, and Prince Road). Although they had previously authorized statute labor to be expended on Centre Street, the magistrates now changed their minds, responding that the route should be along the Huron Church Line all the way to the Detroit River. The residents along the Talbot Road West had a reason for wanting their settlement connected to Sandwich, so much so that they petitioned again in October, this time for fifty pounds to aid in building the road. A stage line—Chauncey Beadle, proprietor—was chartered in 1827 to begin a service between Sandwich and Queenston, by way of the Talbot Road West. So urgent was this connection that the district granted the fifty pounds to permit the work to be done by contract, and the inhabitants of the Irish Settlement were also exempted from paying their 1827 taxes. Despite Father Joseph Crevier’s reluctance to move the Assumption Church fence, the Quarter Sessions ordered the Huron Church Line road to be opened on December 14, 1828. Five years later the panel of magistrates heard the application of the residents of Sandwich Township for a road in the first concession along the Huron Church Line, the baseline of the ribbon-farm surveys. The inhabitants supported their claim to a road extending along the line to the Detroit River by maintaining that the map by which surveyor Mahlon Burwell had been governed in his survey for Talbot’s road in 1816 showed a road allowance along the line. The magistrates were not so sure, however; their approval of the petition was conditional on there actually being such an allowance. At the same time, the opening of roads in the allowances between the concessions east of the Huron Church Line (present Tecumseh Road and Third Concession Road) was approved.\n\nThe eastern portion of Tecumseh Road in Windsor began in 1829 as an extension, laid out by William Elliott, of the road “in the rear of the first concession in the parish of L’Assomption, commencing from André Pelletier’s” on lot 75.56 The original road between the first and second concessions, eastward from the Huron Church Line, had run parallel to the river, north of the surveyed line, and in fact a settlement had grown up along the deviant path. This would not do, and on January 11, 1831, thirty-four petitioners asked the magistrates that statute labor be expended to open the road allowance (the straight line between the concessions) from the Huron Church Line eastward as far as the side line between Charles Jannette’s and François Baby’s farms, that is, between lots 78 and 79, where it would join the easterly portion of the road. This notion was soon set aside in response to objections from the residents of the settlement along the existing path across the rear of the first concession, and on May 10 Surveyor of Highways Elliott laid before the Quarter Sessions a report of a road he had laid out from André Peltier’s house on lot 75 back to the second concession. On May 21 the justices’ authorization for a road between the Janette and Baby farms was rescinded because Elliott’s proposal was approved. The connection along present Crawford Avenue between the two parts of Tecumseh Road was made, and deviation had triumphed.57\n\nHoward Avenue in modern Windsor is a hybrid. It began as a road on the line between farm lots 86 and 87, from the Detroit River to the Grand Marais, which was approved by the Quarter Sessions in 1830. It appears that the opening of this road, straddling the side line, must have proceeded northward from the Grand Marais to a point about halfway to Tecumseh Road, where it offsets to the east to proceed along the central axis of lot 87. The reason for this is that early in 1832 the owners of the lot, Peter Frederick Verhoeff and George Jasperson, two merchants recently arrived in the district, granted to Louis St. Amour a right-of-way through their property from St. Amour’s land in the second concession to the river road, subject only to the proviso that he should not forget to shut the gates along the way. So began one of the important future links between The Ferry and its hinterland, a route that makes the transition from a former rural road extending along the side line between farm lots, to an urban street running down the middle of one of the lots, to an urban subdivision (Aylmer and Glengarry linked by The Horseshoe, products of the 1850s related to the coming of the railroad).\n\nThe realization, however dim, of the eventual need for multiple east-west connections in Sandwich Township, across the grain of the farm-lot pattern, was coming about by 1844. In response to a complaint of the Grand Jury about the state of the road along the shore from the French Church to Windsor, Alexander Wilkinson prepared a “Sketch shewing the proposed line of Road from Sandwich to Windsor,” on the course of present University Avenue.58 However, in 1844 it was not to be. A petition for the road was confronted with a counterpetition, and the original failed. London Street existed as a short cross street on François Baby’s old farm when it was divided among his heirs in 1853, but the extension to Sandwich was not opened until 1874.59\n\nAlexander Wilkinson’s 1844 map showing a proposed inland road from Sandwich to Windsor. The new Assumption Church, then under construction, was to front on the contemplated road. Upriver, the urban subdivisions were beginning to exhibit a sawtooth back-end pattern that later manifested itself as Windsor expanded into the interior along the lines of the French-Canadian farm lots. Wilkinson Family Papers, Macdonald Historical Collection/Archives of Ontario.\n\nA question of land ownership came to surround Peche Island, a low, barren bank of clay in the upper Detroit River. It appears that Jean Baptiste Laforet occupied the island about 1800, claiming the authority of the then governor in chief, Robert Prescott.60 On Jean Baptiste’s death the island passed to his son and legal heir, Joseph Laforet, and from him to his son Oliver. However, Jean Baptiste also had a natural son, Charles, and by 1834 both Oliver and Charles were living on the island, each with a large family. A petition from Charles to Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne, pleading for recognition of his status as an heir, elicited a response that he would not disturb those whose possession had been granted by the governor.\n\nKent: The Thames Region\n\nIn Kent, the Chatham town site lay dormant, occasional squatters and absentee owners aside, long after being surveyed by Abraham Iredell in 1795, despite its obvious advantages. The location at The Forks was a natural one, the head of navigation on the River Thames where it was joined by McGregor’s Creek, and Iredell’s plan logically followed the sinuosities of these watercourses. However, the abandonment of what proved to be too-expensive efforts to develop Chatham as a defensive outwork for Simcoe’s projected provincial capital, upstream at London, led equally to the deferral of development of the town site until conditions were more favorable. By 1821 even the wooden stakes of Iredell’s plan were rotted away, but the military importance of the site remained, despite the failure of Simcoe’s plan, and accordingly Mahlon Burwell was called upon to carry out a new survey in the summer of 1822. Still, despite continued elaborate plans for fortifications at The Forks, there were precious few settlers other than absentee owners and a few squatters on the broken-front lots along the riverbanks. For practical purposes, despite all the talk over the previous years of Chatham’s rightful status as a district seat, the Chatham town site was moribund.\n\nThe long-awaited change came in 1832, with a surge of immigration into the province. For perhaps the first time, Chatham found itself favorably situated, not only in its own right as a home for a shipbuilding industry and a place for the export of wheat and barrel staves, but also as a transfer point for immigrants on their way to Michigan and elsewhere who found the overland Upper Canadian route shorter and more convenient than traveling by way of Lake Erie or the United States. For those who preferred the water route, the newly formed Thames Steam Navigation Company was happy to provide transportation to or from ports between Chatham and Buffalo—including Sandwich Ferry and Detroit—on board the Thames, built at a princely cost of £4,250.\n\nAs early as 1833 the population of Chatham had grown to about one hundred people, and soon the air was filled with optimism. Patrick Shirreff visited the Chatham town site on his way down the Thames: “Chatham is on the south bank of the Thames. Twelve months ago it was said to contain only five or six houses; now there are nearly twenty. It is visited by steamboats; and from being situated at what may be termed the head of the Thames navigation, it is certain of rising at no distant day.” Shirreff found the question of the location of the district seat, last manifested in 1818, still alive in Kent County: “There is a rumour of making Chatham, instead of Sandwich, the seat of the district courts, which would be a more convenient situation; but the growth of Chatham seems to be independent of this alteration.”61\n\nThe impetus so recently felt in Chatham was attributable at least in part to the Thames Steam Navigation Company, whose share capital was derived principally from Duncan McGregor and Henry Van Allan, with additional financing from William Gaspé Hall of Sandwich Ferry as well as a number of farmers on the lower Thames. A large steamer, the Thames, was built in 1833 by “Mr Jenkinson” (possibly Shadrack Jenking, of Sandwich Township) and moved to Cleveland, where her forty-five-horsepower engine was fitted. The arrival of the 112-foot Thames at Sandwich from Cleveland on June 23 was cause for celebration. An earlier Thames contributed her little fifteen-horsepower engine to another, smaller vessel then being built at Chatham, the Kent, to run between Amherstburg and Chatham. The advent of the age of steam was reflected in the naming of places of accommodation. Claude Cartier called his Chatham inn the Steamboat Hotel; unfortunately, the idea was not unique to him or to Chatham.\n\nIn 1835 the Sandwich Canadian Emigrant followed up its rhapsodic description of developments on the Canadian shore across from Detroit with a companion piece on Chatham: “Should the Thames be made navigable to London, and a rail-road be constructed from thence to Port Stanley, or a canal from Janette’s to Two Creeks on Lake Erie, we know of no town in the province which in any way compares with Chatham.” Chatham’s rapid development in the last year again raised the question of separation. “In a few years it will, no doubt, be made the District Town for a new District to be formed from the northern and eastern townships, which will add to its importance.”62 One indicator of the spectacular growth of Chatham was the change in the number of inns and taverns: through 1831, zero; in 1832–34, two; in 1835, three; in 1836, six; and in 1837, nine. Indeed, Chatham was proclaimed a port of entry by Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne, on the strong recommendation of the Quarter Sessions at Sandwich.\n\nConcurrent with such a surge was an increase in social problems. On January 24, 1835, a meeting was held in Claude Cartier’s inn at Chatham to establish the Chatham Vigilant Society for the Suppression of Felony. The purpose of the society seems to have been to apprehend felons, as well as to indemnify members against losses through crime by regular assessments on its participants.\n\nAt Chatham a balance had unconsciously been struck between raw commerce and grace. Anna Jameson’s relief was evident as she emerged from the gloom of the forest in 1837 to encounter a community as prettily situated: “The first view of the beautiful little town of Chatham made my sinking spirits bound like the sight of a friend.”63\n\nShipping and shipbuilding were essential components in Chatham’s development. Although freight was usually moved in humble sailing vessels, passengers expected to be transported in steamers. Perhaps the pride of the fleet was the stylish, speedy, and profitable Brothers, which carried many an immigrant family to the Chatham area, as well as others to the Detroit River settlement. Other well-known Chatham-built steamers included a second Kent, launched in 1841, and, ten years later, the Ploughboy (named for a racehorse). By late 1842 the population of the area was about 1,000, and a year later it was close to 1,100, of whom about 75 lived in North Chatham, a suburb-in-the-making across the Thames. Chatham acquired boosters, who saw it as the very hub of the Western District, in their view soon to replace Sandwich as the district seat. Much of this growth, of course, was owed directly to shipping, and the more astute entrepreneurs were quick to link their land-based businesses to marine transport; plank sidewalks appeared outside the Royal Exchange Hotel, and the path leading from the hotel to the Brothers’s wharf was macadamized, to encourage travelers to patronize both, to the benefit of their common owners, the Eberts brothers. With this kind of enterprise it was small wonder that Chatham’s population reached 1,500 by 1845, or that it was incorporated as a village in 1850 and a town in 1855.\n\nOther hamlets—Louisville, Kent Bridge, Howard Bridge, and Thamesville—developed in Kent County during the 1820s and 1830s, scattered along the Thames above Chatham where crossings were practicable. Howard Bridge enjoyed a brief few years following the opening of a rough bridge in 1826, bolstered by the implementation of stage service between Niagara and Sandwich in 1828, but it lost much of its importance in 1834 when a bridge was built across the Thames at Chatham, leading the road beside the Thames across the river at that point instead, and the village disappeared in the 1840s.\n\nThe habitable portions of the lower townships in Kent were filling up. In 1833 Thomas Talbot wrote to Commissioner of Crown Lands Peter Robinson, “I am to beg of you not to sell any but the Clergy Lots in the Township of Howard, for I have located every Lot except the Clergy and Canada Compy’s Land, in Howard.”64 Perhaps half of Kent was considered to be unproductive land because of the need for drainage: “Already do we see strong, healthy, laborious settlers seeking for land in Raleigh and Tilbury, and after wading for days through water, give up the hope in disgust of obtaining a favorable lot.”65\n\nKent: The Northern Townships\n\nBy the 1820s, population pressure had created a demand for new townships in the Western District. Little land was available in the Essex Peninsula except for the Huron Reserve, and that had been the subject of a petition for its opening to settlement in August 1819. In Kent County, however, there was all the land north of the line of the 1790 McKee Purchase, running west from the Moravian Reserve to the Chenail Ecarté.66 The expansion of settlement in Kent County began as early as 1796, when the Shawnee Township was purchased, but it gained momentum with the Amherstburg council late in 1818, which led to tentative agreements of March 1819 and May 1820 to purchase the lands north of the Thames. Final agreement was delayed until July 1822, but that technicality did not hinder a committee of the Legislative Assembly, which on March 24, 1821, recommended that new, “unorganized townships,” as they were called, including Zone, Dawn, and Sombra, be added to the County of Kent, and the Province Division Act received royal assent and became law. The conveyance of the lands north of the 1790 purchase, between the townships of Sombra and London, agreed to in principle by George Ironside Sr. in 1820, was finalized by Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs William Claus on July 8, 1822. Even six months before the purchase was finalized, there were already fifty-three settlers in what was still being called “Indian land.”\n\nWith the signing at Amherstburg in 1825 of one last treaty, a provisional agreement with the Ojibwa nation for the purchase of about 2,200,000 acres bordering the upper St. Clair River and the southeast shore of Lake Huron (reservations excepted), the thirty-five-year process of the Crown’s acquiring of lands including the Western District was complete. Nearly half of the latest acquisition—the Huron Tract, as it came to be known—was speedily conveyed to the Canada Company, in lieu of a portion of the clergy reserves in the townships already surveyed and opened to settlement.\n\nSombra Township, linked since its creation with the Townships of Dover East and West for assessment purposes, found itself standing on its own in 1826. It was not until July that Clerk of the Peace Charles Askin called to the justices’ attention that the January town meeting in Dawn had not included Sombra; whereupon the Quarter Sessions appointed township officers for Sombra, as well as for “Sinclair” (the St. Clair River) and for Walpole Island. However, Howard and Orford, and Camden and Dawn, continued paired as united townships, sharing township officials.\n\nJuly 10, 1827, was the last time that Amherstburg was the scene of a signing of a conveyance of native lands to the Crown. Four reservations were set aside from the purchase, all in the Western District: one at the mouth of the Au Sable River, another at Kettle Point, and two on the St. Clair River. One of the St. Clair River reserves was just north of Sombra Township, while the other was south of the rapids at the outlet of Lake Huron.\n\nThe northern fringe of the district, fronting on Lake Huron, had gone virtually unorganized and unsettled until early 1829, when a retired British naval officer, Henry Jones, settled a group of about fifty in a tract at the mouth of Perch Creek. Jones, inspired by a British industrialist and utopian socialist and supported by Sir John Colborne, created a communal settlement, Maxwell, where his charges shared an enormous, one-story central building with a common kitchen and dining area as well as separate quarters for each family. It was a noble venture, evoking memories of the altruistic Baldoon experiment, but a disastrous fire in the main building rendered it even more short-lived. However, it did begin the opening up of the northernmost part of the Western District.\n\nBy 1832 Dawn had fifty-two families, and Zone had twenty-eight. Mills were established where Bear Creek crossed the line between Dawn and Zone, and a settlement sprang up, called Thomasville by the inhabitants in deference to one of the mill owners, John Thomas.67 The residents of the vicinity mentioned encountering a curious oily slate that would burn, a finding that a quarter of a century later would lead to an oil industry.\n\nBy 1833 crown lands were being advertised for sale in the new townships of Moore and Sarnia, on the St. Clair River. These, together with Plympton and Enniskillen, testified to the popularity of Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne; all of these new townships bore names associated with his past career. Within Sarnia Township, Port Sarnia was laid out at the same time.\n\nWriting in 1833 to the editor of the Sandwich Canadian Emigrant, Henry Jones Jr. complained that immigrant settlers passing through Chatham on their way to Sarnia or Plympton were referred to his father’s vicinity—that is, to the commune begun in 1829. Henry Jr. added that as a result many who encountered the charred ruins of Maxwell were crossing to Michigan in disillusionment and disgust. Others had somewhat different interpretations. A story originating in the Montreal Abstract asserted that of 208 British immigrants who arrived at York, only 54 went on to Plympton, and that as a result charges were brought against the agent who was responsible. Thomas Talbot, a somewhat less idealistic colonizer, dismissed the whole matter; Jones Sr., in his opinion, was “a discontented bore.”68 To encourage the settling of the northern townships it was “Ordered—That Taxes of poor Emigrants of the townships of Camden Dawn & Zone, amtg. to 16/3 ½ cy (amounting to sixteen pounds, three and one-half shillings currency) be remitted.”69\n\nThe raw quality of the Bear Creek settlement, on the fringe of the wilderness in 1834, was apparent to visitors from older parts of the district. William Cosgrove, of Chatham, wrote to William Hands: “I have lately been in the Township of Dawn adjoining Bear Creek on a pedestrian Tour and I think I can speak feelingly as to the bad state of the roads there particularly adjoining the Upper Mill.… The Inhabitants in that quarter deserve every encouragement from their industry & public spirit which bids fair to outvie the River Thames Settlement in a few Years.”70 The Canadian Emigrant agreed; the editor could find not a single magistrate in Camden, Dawn, Zone, Sombra, Brooke, or Enniskillen Townships, and he noted that path masters and other township officials had to travel eighty miles to take their oaths of office. Even more seriously, he remarked that criminals frequently went unpunished because of the difficulty of getting them to justice at Sandwich.\n\nBy 1835 there was a demand for expanded service in the northern townships. Claude Gouin wrote Postmaster Hands from Sombra:\n\nYou remarked that you hoped we had taken Steps for the Establishment of a Post Office on the St. Clair; Mr. Henry Jones wrote me a few days ago that there ought to be a Post office at My Place and one at the Forks of Bear. Now If You think Me a fit Person to fill that office, will thank you to recommend Me to the Post Master General. It is not for any profit I apply for the Situation, it is Merely to have My Own Letters Free.71\n\nA few days later Hands learned that Gouin had a competitor seeking the Sombra postmastership: Neil Campbell, “Located in as desirable a place as any in the Township and half way from Chatham to the Rapids of St. Clair.”72\n\nSome attention was devoted to roads and bridges in the northern townships—the river road through Sarnia Township, and another beside the north branch of Bear Creek (modern North Sydenham River) in Sombra, for example. By July 1835, however, four thousand pounds granted by the province for roads in 1833 and 1834 was exhausted, and a further request for a road in Plympton had to be refused for lack of funds.\n\nSarnia Township was attracting the attention of absentee speculators. Samuel Street of Niagara was one, whose attempted purchase of 14,777 acres in 1834 was opposed by Captain Richard Emeric Vidal, lately retired from the Royal Navy and settled on the St. Clair River, on the ground that the land was worth more than the 1s. 10d. per acre that Street was offering. After a year of haggling, a total price of £4,494. 13s. 5d. was agreed upon.\n\nBy 1835 a hamlet on the east bank near the upper end of the St. Clair River had come into existence and acquired a name: “Buenosayres.”73 It appears that the name must have been speedily withdrawn and replaced by Glasgow at a meeting of the inhabitants held about October 14, and that at another public meeting between November 16, 1835, and January 6, 1836, Glasgow was succeeded by a name less likely to lead to confusion with other world capitals: Port Sarnia.\n\nAnother of the communities coming into being on the St. Clair River in 1835 was Corunna, in Moore Township—place-names, like many others, having connections to Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne.74 Wallaceburg, at the forks of Big Bear Creek, was also laid out early in 1835, as a subdivision by the owner of lot 13 in the second concession of Sombra Township. One of the advantages of which Wallaceburg could boast was “a good, substantial floating bridge on Bear Creek,” at that location.75 Froomfield (originally Froomefield, or Talfourd’s, after settler Froome Talfourd) sprang up by 1836. Uneasy and perhaps embarrassed at their own lack of familiarity with the new, northern townships, the authorities at Sandwich asked surveyor John A. Wilkinson to obtain a map of the area.\n\nIn October 1836, dissension similar to that accompanying the evolution of the Huron Reserve into Anderdon Township in Essex County marked the surrender of land in Zone Township, on the north side of the River Thames.76 Zone was part of the Moravian Reserve, whose population declined as the disaffected moved away to Missouri.\n\nBy March 1837, Wilkinson’s plan for Corunna having been considered by the bureaucrats in Surveyor General John Macaulay’s office, they had certain deficiencies to call to his attention. The plan was not signed; the accompanying field notes were not notarized; dimensions were given for one of each type of block shown on the plan, but not for all, which was an irregular practice; and the department was being billed for the whole survey, which was to have been shared with an adjoining property holder. Mistakes in Wilkinson’s arithmetic were called to his attention, and by mid-May the unfortunate Wilkinson’s plan had fallen under the eye of Lieutenant Governor Head, who likewise did not like what he saw. Diagonal streets were to be eliminated, along with all irregularly shaped blocks. The central square was to be adjusted to the new plan, and riverfront lots were to be reserved for use as a market.77\n\nWilkinson, perhaps understandably, was not in the best frame of mind on receiving this news. His efforts of 1836 having been swept aside, he had to start over again. He began on June 1, 1837, by pulling up and collecting the old stakes and throwing them into the St. Clair River. The task of re-doing the Corunna survey began on June 5 with the hiring of a crew, and the glow began to return: “King’s birthday kept. Rainy & heavy mist. Engaged two men to commence tomorrow. Drank a bottle of wine among the party to the health of his Majesty Wm. 4th with cheers, Queen Adelaid[e] & all the royal family with cheers, the Hon. John McCauley and Surveyor General, deputies, etc., etc., etc.”78\n\nCommunities, like their residents, take on personalities that reflect their experiences as well as their origins, and in consequence each develops an identity of its own. Those in the Western District demonstrate that Uppermost Canada was anything but the monolith of popular perception."
