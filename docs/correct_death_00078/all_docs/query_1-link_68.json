        "text": "Over the course of several installments of Torontoist’s Historicist column, I looked at the histories of several long-defunct Toronto newspapers, a project I’m considering expanding into a full book about the medium’s glory years. This piece was originally published on August 27, 2016.\n\nFront page of the second edition of the Telegraph, May 22, 1866.\n\nWhile it only lasted six years, the Telegraph filled an important role in shaping one of Toronto’s most powerful newspaper publishers. The experience taught John Ross Robertson the pitfalls of being caught up in party politics, and provided a dry run for the eventual success of the Telegram.\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1841, Robertson’s passion for muckraking journalism manifested itself early on. While attending Upper Canada College, he launched College Times in 1857. In its debut edition, he criticized school leadership for approving a land deal, which threatened a student playground. To avoid expulsion, he changed the paper’s name. Within the next decade, he published one of Canada’s first sports periodicals (Sporting Life), a satirical paper (The Grumbler), and a railway guide.\n\nHired as city editor of the Globe in 1865, Robertson developed such a nose for local news that he won a contest among the paper’s reporters by gathering 150 stories in a single day. He implemented a policy of publishing lots of short local news stories instead of a few long-winded articles on major events. But he wasn’t happy at the paper, thanks to publisher George Brown’s insistence on publishing lengthy political diatribes at the expense of Toronto news. Robertson soon regarded his boss as “the most notable charlatan this country has ever known.”\n\nThe Telegraph, May 21, 1866.\n\nRobertson’s unhappiness led to his becoming co-owner of a new evening newspaper. Launched on May 21, 1866, the Telegraph attempted to serve as an independent conservative-leaning counterpoint to the Globe, which was the mouthpiece of the emerging Liberal party. The Telegraph’s prospectus advocated stronger connections with Great Britain over political union with the United States, confederation of the British North American colonies ASAP, a renewal of the reciprocity free trade treaty with the Americans, encouraged better management of public land, and political reform within the U.K., and promised “unswerving support” to interests which promoted the development of Toronto regardless of their political leanings.\n\nThe Telegraph quickly developed a flair for breaking local news, echoing developments in the popular press south of the border. The paper’s sensationalistic style was well-reflected when Robertson’s personal reports of the Red River Rebellion in 1869 and 1870 were carried across North America. They also aroused the wrath of provisional government leader Louis Riel, who imprisoned Robertson and Globe reporter Robert Cunningham at Fort Garry for a week. Both were then expelled by Riel for being “dangerous characters.”\n\nLaying of the cornerstone of the registry office on Albert Street by Tommy Church (left) and John Ross Robertson (centre), 1915. Toronto Public Library.\n\nRobertson’s fiercely independent nature led him to criticize groups he was allied with. Although he was a staunch Orangeman, he had no stomach for a row which broke out between the Orange Young Britons and a similar group of young Irishmen in September 1870. Reputedly caused by the desire to avenge a slight, a fight started at a tavern of ill-repute down by the Queen’s Wharf (near present-day Bathurst and Front) turned into a riot. Unlike past battles between Orangemen and the Irish, authorities stepped in and charged several Young Britons. Robertson condemned the fighters, calling them “young rowdies.” The Young Britons were not amused: During a meeting at St. Lawrence Hall on September 19, 1870, an R. Reynolds claimed that the “Orange and the Green” lived in peace and harmony (a ridiculous claim given the history of battles between the two), a peace which had been attempted to be interrupted by the foul and atrocious articles which have recently been printed in certain newspapers in this city.” Members of the group sent intimidating letters to the Telegraph, threatening to destroy the office. Cooler heads prevailed.\n\nThe Telegraph joined other Toronto newspapers in waging war with their printers in 1872. The Nine-Hour Movement was an international effort to shorten the work day for labourers. Toronto’s newspaper owners, led by Brown, formed the Master Printers’ Association (MPA) to resist the demands of the Toronto Typographical Union. The Telegraph dutifully printed MPA propaganda, portraying the printers as unreasonable in demanding a nine-hour work day. “This assault on the press is but the forerunner of the coming attack on employers and employed in all branches of industry,” one missive declared, “and the importance of firmly resisting it can hardly be overestimated.”\n\nEditorials predicted a strike, which began on March 25, 1872, would quickly collapse and save the Dominion from commercial collapse, but the workers hung in, culminating in a 2,000-strong march and mass rally in Queen’s Park on April 15. After Brown arranged the arrest of strike leaders, the federal government swung into action. Within days, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Trade Union Act, which legalized labour unions. The result left organized labour allied with Macdonald’s Conservatives for several years.\n\nAn early satirical look at John A.Macdonald, the Grumbler, May 7, 1864.\n\nThe Trade Union Act was probably added to the growing antagonism between Macdonald and Robertson. The PM had hoped that, despite its independence stance, the Telegraph would eventually be moulded into a reliable party organ. In 1869 co-owner James Cook promised stronger support to the party in return for financial aid. But, despite its shaky finances, Robertson regularly attacked the Tories. Macdonald, who felt the Telegraph was becoming “a mere blackmail sheet,” withdrew support after Cook’s departure in 1871.\n\nIn a May 3, 1872 editorial, the Telegraph asked “Who Are the Conservatives?” The ensuing rant declared that the Tories should have crushed Riel’s provisional government instead of talking with them, had given too much support to British PM William Ewart Gladstone (a Liberal!) in negotiating the Treaty of Washington, and generally betrayed the sort of conservative principles Robertson stood for. If anything, Robertson found more to admire in the views of Canadian Liberals (or Reformers, as he still referred to them) aligning with British Conservatives.\n\nThe leaders of the Conservatives have abandoned and destroyed their party, and that a new party is forming of Canadians of truly conservative tendencies, and formed of the old Reform party, who have obtained their reforms, and the truest of the Conservatives who cannot be bought by office to sacrifice their principles, and will strive to uphold the honour of Canada at the expense of turning against their old leaders.\n\nSuch editorials, along with failed attempts to buy out Robertson, had led Conservative party brass to fund the launch of the Mail in March 1872. According to a May 6 Telegraph editorial, several writers “were bribed away by the promise of larger salaries on a new organ, which was to subserve the cause the Telegraph had so unwisely repudiated.” The same editorial complained that agents of Macdonald had bribed printers during the strike to either leave the Telegraph or damage its printing equipment. Robertson viewed these events as a conspiracy which was “the most perfidious that ever smirched the annals of any government.”\n\nWithout Conservative support, the Telegraph drowned in debt. Eliminating its morning edition in May 1872 didn’t help, and the paper folded within a month.\n\nDespite their mutual loathing, Robertson soon resumed his professional relationship with Brown, serving as the Globe’s London correspondent for three years. The inevitable end came when Robertson arranged a dinner for Brown to meet members of the British press, during which the sullen Globe publisher muttered that the bill had better not show up in Robertson’s expense account. He soon returned to Canada as business manager of The Nation, a weekly paper run by members of Canada First, a movement dedicated to defining Canada as a proudly British Protestant nation.\n\nGoldwin Smith in his study at The Grange, 1909. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 690.\n\nWhile at the Nation’s office in March 1876, Robertson received a letter hand delivered by Toronto mayor Angus Morrison from one of the paper’s owners, Goldwin Smith. When Robertson arrived at Smith’s home library at the Grange, he was told that Smith was withdrawing from the Nation. “Tell me, Robertson,” Smith asked. “What chances would an evening newspaper have in Toronto?”\n\nSmith, along with fellow Liberal and Canada First member Edward Blake, had previously backed the Liberal, an attempt to compete with the Globe, which lasted four months. That paper’s assets were still up for sale, and were offered via middlemen to Robertson. Smith envisioned a politically independent paper, one “for the masses and not the classes.” Robertson had contemplated a similar publication since returning from London.\n\nIn the prospectus for the new paper, Robertson promised it would be “a newspaper, not an organ; it will have no patron but the public.” Handbills with the prospectus teased a publication full of fresh news, discussion of public issues presented “freely, honestly, and in a spirit of justice to all parties, opinions and men.” Dubbed the Evening Telegram, the paper vowed to live up to the speed implied in its name by adding stories up to press time, beating the morning papers on some items by up to 18 hours.\n\nDebuting at 4 p.m. on April 18, 1876, the initial print run of 3,480 copies sold out within an hour. The paper quickly turned a profit, thanks to Robertson’s decision to sell classifieds for a penny a word, half the standard rate. Ad revenue blossomed, which allowed Robertson to cut the paper’s price in half a year after its launch. Its financial success also ensured that Robertson could continue to maintain his independence from rigidly toeing the Conservative party line during the remainder of the Macdonald era, which allowed the Telegram to evolve into the voice of conservative, working-class Toronto.\n\nNext: The News of Toronto\n\nSources: Toronto Workers Respond to Industrial Capitalism 1867-1892 by Gregory S.

This piece was originally published on March 19, 2011.\n\nThe Empire Building, Adelaide Street West. Toronto Called Back From 1892 to 1847 by Conyngham Crawford Taylor (Toronto: William Briggs, 1892).\n\nNineteenth-century Toronto journalism was often a war field of conflicting political outlooks. Some newspaper proprietors, such as George Brown of the Globe, had deep ties with the parties of the day but (usually) kept their publications separate from the official party apparatus. Not so with the Empire, whose operations were maintained by the federal Conservatives. For just under a decade, the Empire provided morning readers with the news as filtered by the prime minister and his associates. But, as reporter Hector Charlesworth noted in his memoirs, “a newspaper established and conducted primarily by an official partisan junta has in its system the seed of death from the outset.”\n\nAdvertisement announcing the launch of the Empire. The Mail, December 17, 1887.\n\nStarting in 1872, the Conservatives used their sway with the proprietors of the Mail to present Torontonians with the party’s viewpoints that fell in step with the party line. Tory brass was happy with this relationship until the mid-1880s, when, like a stereotypical teen, the Mail’s editors printed opinions on topics like commercial union with the United States that were not shared by party officials. When the Mail declared its editorial independence from any party, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and other Tory leaders looked for a means to get their message across without any questions. While there were other Conservative-leaning papers based in Toronto, such as the Evening Telegram, their proprietors were too independent-minded to ever follow party requests to the letter.\n\nThe party’s solution: why not launch our own daily rag?\n\nWhen the Empire debuted on December 27, 1887, its premiere editorial made no attempt to hide its political ties:\n\nThere can be no misunderstanding the wishes and intentions of the owners and management of THE EMPIRE. It is proposed to strengthen by all legitimate means the hands of the Party and the Government that have controlled the politics of the Dominion (with the exception of a term of five years) ever since the foundations of Confederation were laid. Believing that the public affairs of Canada have been, on the whole, wisely and ably administered under the premiership of Sir John A. Macdonald and holding that the remarkable progress of our country has been due in large measure to his far-sighted and patriotic administration, THE EMPIRE will extend to the Leader and his Government its fullest confidence and heartiest support…There is no necessity, here and now, for enlarging on the liberal, enlightened and patriotic policy that has placed Canada in the front rank among civilized countries. It is sufficient for our purpose to say that a Government and a party formulating, promoting and adhering to such a policy deserves well of the country and should count upon the support of all who are able to rise above the plane of purely partisan politics.\n\nContent-wise, the Empire focused on pushing key Conservative platforms, such as the National Policy. Foreign items and agricultural news often took up more space than local news and lifestyle items that may have mattered little to the paper’s audience of die-hard Tories outside of the city. Rival papers were quick to pounce on the Empire, though some, like Saturday Night, expressed not venom but pity for the pressures the paper’s editorial staff had to work under:\n\nThe task of the partisan editor is still more difficult, because he must be eternally weighing not what is right but what is expedient. It is his function to say that which is best suited to the party’s interests, no matter whether it is right or wrong. It is his business to declare what the party desires the public to believe, and it is frequently a task of great magnitude to find an excuse for wrong-doing, or to palliate transgressions which are capable of no defence.\n\nEven jokes in the Empire had to be carefully vetted so that party hacks and potential supporters wouldn’t be offended.\n\nFront page coverage of the death of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, the Empire, June 8, 1891.\n\nHow much of a guiding force Macdonald provided the paper was proven when the Old Chieftain fell fatally ill during the spring of 1891. The paper’s coverage of his fight against the Grim Reaper was best summed up by Douglas Fetherling in his book The Rise of the Canadian Newspaper: “The Empire behaved with the special lack of dignity reserved for distant relations, eager to emphasize their membership in the family.” While other Toronto papers counted down the minutes to Macdonald’s death, the Empire acted as if his “amazing vitality” would carry him through the severe strokes he had suffered. Hints were also dropped that dastardly Liberal leader Wilfrid Laurier, by pursuing “disloyal and degrading” pro-American policies, caused Sir John to over-exert himself in the name of protecting Canadian independence. Headlines screamed “A RAY OF HOPE!” when every other paper indicated the opposite was true. For a week after Macdonald died, the Empire displayed its grief by printing thick black bars around every column and interviewing every human being who had ever had contact with the prime minister.\n\nSample page celebrating the Empire’s fifth anniversary, December 31, 1892.\n\nThe pitfalls of working for a party-run organ were always apparent to the Empire‘s employees. As the Conservatives fell into disarray amid a five-year-long game of musical prime ministers to fill out Macdonald’s term, no member of the paper’s staff was safe from incurring the wrath of any disgruntled politician who felt his prominence within the party gave him free rein to interfere in editorial content. Important stories without any political relevance could be suppressed by the whims of party officials. The situation was, in the words of Hector Charlesworth, “like trying to conduct a Sunday school picnic in a jungle.” In his thirteen months as an Empire reporter, Charlesworth saw at least two city editors pass through. He was himself dismissed for three weeks in the fall of 1894 to placate an incensed politician, was rehired, then decided he’d had enough and went back to his previous employer, the Toronto World.\n\nFront page coverage of the death of Prime Minister Sir John Thompson, the Empire, December 13, 1894.\n\nBy 1895, party officials had mended fences with the Mail and determined there was no good reason to keep the Empire alive in a market overflowing with morning papers. New Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell had a reputation for letting floundering projects sink (he had favoured killing the Canadian Pacific Railway at one point) and losses of up to $150,000 a year at the Empire could not have impressed him. Rumours of the paper’s fate swirled around newspaper circles until the announcement was made that as of February 7, the Mail and the Empire would merge. The Empire‘s farewell editorial on February 6 was brief — it stated the merger, told creditors their payments were still due, and that subscribers would receive the new paper, for which “there is every assurance will faithfully maintain the policy in political matters hitherto advocated by the Empire.”\n\nThe Empire‘s employees came out on the losing end of the merger, as their faith in the Conservative party went unrewarded. While the Mail‘s staff, whose paper had faced liquidation before the merger, was guaranteed continued employment, workers at the Empire were left to fend for themselves. Bowell refused to offer temporary clerkships in Ottawa during the upcoming session of the House of Commons, which led to one of the paper’s enemies, Liberal Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat, finding jobs at Queen’s Park for the displaced employees.\n\nAd from the final edition of the Empire, February 6, 1895.\n\nIronically, the Empire‘s last major gesture was to reach out to its ideological polar opposite. When a fire destroyed the offices of the Globe in January 1895, the Empire cleared space in its building for the Liberal-leaning paper to continue publishing without missing an issue. When the Empire published its final edition, the Globebestowed front-page condolences on those being tossed out of work in light of the “exceedingly pleasant relations between the staffs of the two journals” after the fire.\n\nThose “pleasant relations” were long in the past when the Globe later caused the Empire name to fade from Toronto’s newsstands for good. A month after buying the Globe in 1936, George McCullagh consolidated Toronto’s morning paper market by purchasing the Mail and Empire. When the merged paper debuted on November 23, the Mail achieved its ultimate victory as its name remained in the masthead, while the Empire‘s was consigned to the trash heap.\n\nThe final word on the Empire goes to a Saturday Night editorial that appeared the week the paper expired in 1895:\n\nWhen one picked up the Empire in the morning no surprises were to be expected. If looking out of the window one sees an organ-grinder, the first few notes settle the question of what is to be played; so on opening that thoroughly respectable but now deceased sheet we always knew what was coming.\n\nNext: Of Mail and Empire.\n\nSources: Candid Chronicles: Leaves from the Note Book of a Canadian Journalist by Hector Charlesworth (Toronto: Macmillan, 1925), The Rise of the Canadian Newspaper by Douglas Fetherling (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1990) and the following newspapers: the December 27, 1887, June 5, 1891, and February 6, 1895 editions of the Empire; the February 6, 1895 edition of the Globe; and the December 31, 1887 and February 9, 1895 editions of Saturday Night.\n\nOver the course of several installments of Torontoist’s Historicist column, I looked at the histories of several long-defunct Toronto newspapers, a project I’m considering expanding into a full book about the medium’s glory years. This piece was originally published on November 22, 2014.\n\nAdvertisement for the Mail, 1890s. Toronto Public Library.\n\nWhat’s in a name? In the case of the Globe and Mail, it’s a combination of two historical Toronto newspapers that clashed politically. Most people are familiar with the Globe as a solo act—founded by George Brown in 1844, it evolved into the unofficial voice of the Liberal party. Yet the 64-year odyssey of the Mail and its offshoots as a conservative counterpoint to the Globe shouldn’t be ignored, even if its present-day descendant rarely acknowledges its existence beyond the masthead.\n\nAs the 1860s drew to a close, the Conservative party looked to back a newspaper that equalled the power and journalistic quality of the Globe. “I have long thought that a good paper of Liberal-Conservative cast [as the party was then known] was greatly required in Toronto,” Prime Minister John A. Macdonald wrote to a colleague in February 1869. It took nearly three years for Macdonald to achieve his goal.\n\nThough Toronto had several Conservative-friendly papers in the early 1870s, none appealed to the party. Its traditional mouthpiece was the Leader, which launched in 1852. Publisher James Beaty spread himself thin through his interests in contracting, leather merchandising, and federal politics, which resulted in a paper that was past its prime. “It failed to recognize the journalistic truth that progress is essential to prosperity,” the Mail observed in 1881, “and that this can only be achieved by enterprise and energy on the part of conductors of a journal, combined with a liberal outlay of capital.” The upstart Telegraph, founded by future Telegram publisher John Ross Robertson in 1866 was, according to Macdonald, “a mere blackmail paper, and the sooner it is crushed, the better.”\n\nThe first home of the Mail, King Street west of Bay Street. Half Century Anniversary Number of The Daily Mail and Empire (Toronto, Mail and Empire, 1922).\n\nFollowing the Conservatives’ loss in the December 1871 Ontario provincial election, Macdonald canvassed the business community for money to battle the Globe. Defeated premier John Sandfield Macdonald and editor Thomas C. Patteson laid the groundwork for an authoritative, distinguished, lively publication. They purchased a brick building on the north side of King Street west of Bay whose previous occupants included a Bank of Montreal branch.\n\nWhen the Mail debuted as a morning paper on March 30, 1872, Patteson published a 12-point “abridged prospectus” on the editorial page. He vowed to steer clear of “unthinking partisanship” and the voices of “violent and revolutionary assailants of the Constitution” in favour of moderation. Taking a dig at its rivals, Patteson promised that “parliamentary reporting will be attempted on fairer principles than have characterized the performances of some newspapers.” While editorial writers would toe a pro-Tory line, reporters were instructed to be impartial. Local news and city hall coverage would be presented “with all the zeal and activity consistent with good taste and the privacy of peoples’ own business.” The paper would be rounded out with coverage of arts, business, science, and sports.\n\nFront page of the Mail, March 30, 1872.\n\n“It may be well to say that persons interested in the welfare of The Mail are not blind to the obstacles which beset the launching of their enterprise,” Patteson wrote. “But they know that every successful experiment has passed through its period of probationary difficulty…If, growing with our country’s growth, The Mail should ever be credited with having been instrumental in the development of our native strength and resources, the object of its originators will have been served.”\n\nThe paper quickly made an impact on the competition. The Telegraph folded within months, while the Leader lingered on another six years. The Mail also benefitted from a major miscue by Globe management. While George Brown led the campaign against the Toronto Typographical Union’s push for labour reforms for printers and its participation in the Nine-Hour Movement, the Mail became a union shop. (Later, the Mail was the subject of a successful labour boycott campaign, which led to the defeat of candidates the paper backed during the 1886 municipal election.)\n\nThe Mail’s close ties to the Conservatives proved problematic when the Pacific Scandal broke. The defeat of the Tories in the 1873 federal election turned the Mailinto an opposition paper backing a tarnished party. Patteson also had to soothe party hacks incensed by the lack of coverage of their insignificant events. When officials in Cobourg felt short shrift was given to local banquet in May 1875, Patteson shot back that it was difficult to “please everyone bent on self-glorification” and that he ultimately would “offend a larger or smaller number of persons every day, and bear the brunt of it in addition to the other labours devolving on him.”\n\nJohn and Charles Riordon. Paper in the Making by George Carruthers (Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-operative, 1947).\n\nCirculation stagnated and financial losses piled up. Among its largest creditors was John Riordon, whose pulp mill near St. Catharines supplied newsprint to both the Mail and the Globe. In October 1874, Patteson, over the objections of several shareholders, pleaded with Riordon to take out a mortgage on the paper. By November 1877, Riordon, who was owed $26,000, had little choice but to take complete control of the struggling paper. Though Patteson briefly remained as editor, the real power behind the Mail lay with Riordon, his brother Charles, general manager Christopher William Bunting, and treasurer William James Douglas.\n\nThe paper’s fortunes quickly improved. John Riordon promised to continue supporting the Conservatives, which proved wise after John A. Macdonald returned to power in 1878. Journalists like E.E. Sheppard and Philip Dansken Ross received early career boosts. The layout was revamped for easier reading. Its advertising base was extended outside Toronto thanks to the efforts of Anson McKim, who was sent to Montreal in 1879 to gather new clients. McKim and the Mail soon found themselves offering rates and circulation numbers for other Ontario papers that out-of-province advertisers hoped to place spots in. When several papers decided they no longer wanted to be represented by a rival publication, McKim broke away from the Mail in 1889 to form Canada’s first national advertising agency.\n\nThe Riordons envisioned themselves as paper and publishing moguls along the lines the New York Herald’s James Gordon Bennett (whose paper they had an agreement with to use cable dispatches for breaking international news). The Riordons noted that Bennett successfully launched a separate evening newspaper, the New York Evening Telegram. Their equivalent, launched in May 1881, was the Evening News, which took several years to find its identity as a muckraking working-class journal.\n\nThe Mail Building, circa 1891. Toronto Old and New by G. Mercer Adam (Toronto: Mail Printing Company, 1891).\n\nWhen the News debuted, both papers were housed in the new Mail Building at the northwest corner of King and Bay. Designed by architect Richard A. Waite, who later designed the Ontario Legislative Building in Queen’s Park, it was the tallest building in the city for several years. Its tower included a public observation deck for visitors to take in the growing city. A 35-foot-tall flagstaff topped the structure.\n\nThe Mail Building survived three substantial fires during the mid-1880s. The first, which broke out in the basement paper storage area on May 24, 1884, inflicted most of its damage on another tenant, Bell Telephone. Six switchboard operators were rescued by volunteers who erected a ladder from an adjoining building. Among those offering assistance was city councillor Harry Piper, who delayed his visit to the opening of Toronto’s first zoo. “With his coat off, a cigar in his mouth, and wearing his glossy silk hat, he assisted the men to get the hose to work,” the Mail reported, “and when it was found that the water would not reach the roof he piloted the men up the north stairway to the composing room, from the door of which they were enabled to play directly on the flames.”\n\nBefitting all the old stereotypes about how British Torontonians saw themselves, the Mail’s coverage gave the impression that the crowd watching the blaze from King Street was as anxious about the fate of a flag erected to mark Queen Victoria’s birthday as saving the women nearly trapped inside. While the crowd yelled “Save the flag!” one man offered $50 to anyone who grabbed it for him as it fluttered down. The flag survived the ordeal, as did the Mail. Because little of its office space was affected, the paper published its next scheduled edition.\n\nJohn Riordon barely enjoyed the new building. He retired from the print business in 1882 following a head injury sustained while falling off a horse, and died two years later. Charles Riordon was less amenable to Tory policies than his brother, allowing his staff to display a growing independent streak. This accelerated with the appointment of Edward Farrer as editor in 1885. A man suspected of fabricating his background, Farrer was an advocate of commercial and political union with the United States, which put him at odds with the Conservatives.\n\nThe Mail’s first major breach with the Tories occurred with its coverage of the aftermath of the Northwest Rebellion. It disagreed with the Macdonald government’s decision to execute Louis Riel over fear of inflaming nationalist sentiment in Quebec. Both Farrer and Bunting were prejudiced against Catholics and French Canadians, sentiments which soon dominated the editorial page. Farrer, sometimes assisted by Goldwin Smith, argued that a battle was looming between Catholic doctrine and secular control of the legal and legislative apparatus.\n\nCartoon by J.W. Bengough, Grip, September 11, 1886. The monkey on the left is either C.W. Bunting or Edward Farrer.\n\n“Looking with a single eye to the future welfare of Canada,” observed a September 20, 1886 editorial, “we believe the time has come for compelling the Roman Catholic Church to keep within her proper sphere.” It argued the church had no right to play a role in government policy or interfering with English-speaking settlers in French areas, and criticized Macdonald for not standing up against the church’s power. The editorial ended with a vow to remain “an earnest advocate of Conservative policy” but one free to criticize party actions.\n\nMacdonald had enough. He green-lit cutting ties with the Mail. “The working relationship between us and the Conservative party has broken down,” a January 8, 1887 editorial declared. “Nothing remains for us but to accept the logical development of our former departure, and make The Mail an independent journal, serving neither party and criticizing both with the freedom born of a complete deliverance from political ties.”\n\nIndependence suited the Mail. “I cannot think that Canada has ever had a greater newspaper than was the Mail during this period of separation from the Conservative party,” wrote veteran journalist J.S. Willison decades later. “The Mail,” historian Paul Rutherford has observed, “realized the ideal of quality journalism: full of news and features, boasting a superb editorial page devoted to ‘a cause, and not a party.’ The Mail’s crusades tapped the malaise, the anxiety of a bourgeois public upset by social change and national stagnation, to such an extent that it might fairly be called the leading organ of the ‘classes’ in Ontario.”\n\nThe Mail reshaped itself into a proto-modern paper, especially in its Saturday edition. Pages were better defined by subject matter. Photographs were introduced via a special illustrated supplement in 1893. But its greatest innovation was the publication of several of Toronto’s first enduring newspaper columnists.\n\nLeft: Photo of Henry Horace Wiltshire, the Mail and Empire, February 15, 1911. Right: header for The “Flaneur,” the Mail, January 12, 1895.\n\nHenry Horace Wiltshire was an English journalist who, after a two-decade stint at the Times of London, joined the Mail in 1884. Three years later, he launched “The Flaneur,” a compendium of commentary on local and world news that would be comparable to a Victorian blog. Wiltshire drew on articles from other publications, observations from his travels, and submissions from readers. “I propose to ask your attention for about half an hour each week while touching in a more or less chatty manner on subjects of social, political, or literary interest forming current topics of conversation in this or in other lands,” he wrote for “The Flaneur’s” debut on December 17, 1887. “I shall express opinions and sometimes speak plainly, but with no intention either to proselytize or preach.” He felt the column’s title reflected “one who endeavours to evolve some interest from the talk at the clubs, the trivialities of society and the badinage and rough humour of the streets.” Those who didn’t care for his content were urged to flip the page. Not many did; Wiltshire, as writer or editor, maintained the column until his death in 1911.\n\nThe Mail, August 19, 1893.\n\nAnother popular column was “Woman’s Kingdom.” Initially filled with domestic and beauty hints, the column gained influence after Kathleen Blake Watkins (later known as Kit Coleman) took over in 1889. Kit injected her opinions on literature, politics, religion, and science, demonstrating that female journalists were just as opinionated as their male counterparts. “I simply detest fashion,” she noted in an 1892 column, “and I think it is paying us women a poor compliment to imagine we cannot take an interest in the highest and the very deepest questions of the day.” Kit eventually travelled the world for the paper, covering social issues In England and the battlefields of the Spanish-American War. She held down her Saturday post until a salary dispute caused her departure in 1911.\n\nFarrer continued his anti-Catholic crusade on the editorial page, culminating in the paper’s support of the “equal rights” movement which proposed to curb constitutional protections for Catholics and French Canadians. The Jesuit Estates Act, which compensated the order in Quebec for land the crown confiscated after the British conquest in the 18th century, particularly aroused the Mail’s wrath. The paper backed the Orange Order, whose mission it saw in an 1889 editorial as “defending British and Protestant civilization against the assaults of the Roman Catholic priesthood.” The paper’s fervour cooled after Farrer moved over to the Globe in 1890, as did its support for commercial union with the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives found themselves back in the same situation they faced in 1872: the need for a reliable outlet for their opinions. After contemplating working with other Tory-leaning papers, the party decided to launch a paper that they completely controlled. Enter, on December 27, 1887, the Empire. Over the next seven years, it provided partisan coverage that went to absurd lengths, especially in its fawning coverage of the dying days of John A. Macdonald in 1891.\n\nFront page of illustrated supplement section, the Mail, February 2, 1895.\n\nBy the mid-1890s, both the Empire and the Mail faced financial difficulties. As the Mail’s editorial stance drifted back toward the Tories, Conservative party officials debated the merits of continuing the Empire in a market where seven daily papers fought for readers. Stories of backroom deals to merge the Mail and Empire circulated among their rivals.\n\nThe Empire played down the rumours by presenting a brave face on its editorial page. “The Empire will never betray the trust committed to it, or make any move that might create a danger that it would become a weathercock journal, governed by caprice,” it declared on January 15, 1895. Behind the scenes, despite the urgings of Conservative officials for a merger, there were obstacles to a deal. One was price. The other was a feeling that the surviving paper needed to stand behind the principles of the Empire and remain firmly in the Tory camp.\n\nThe rumours carried on until readers opened their morning papers on February 6, 1895.\n\nNext: The Conservative Empire.\n\nSources: Brown of the Globe Volume Two: Statesman of Confederation, 1860-1880 by J.M.S.

But this was the Empire, an experiment in direct newspaper ownership by the Conservative party, and a federal election campaign was on.\n\nAmid the sea of text that Saturday morning, readers caught this eye-catching headline:\n\n“For several days anxious enquiries have been made as to the date when Sir John Macdonald would address a Toronto audience,” the paper reported. There may have been legitimate anxiety among local Tories. When the campaign began two weeks earlier, the prime minister had intended to use Toronto as his base of operations. But the avalanche of mail from candidates and party officials, along with the 76-year-old leader’s increasing infirmity, had kept Macdonald off the hustings. He skipped a large rally in Toronto the week before, leaving it to several cabinet ministers to excite the faithful.\n\nBut after that false start, Macdonald was finally coming. The date: February 17. The venue: the Academy of Music on King Street. Located where University Avenue now crosses the south side of King, it was the city’s first fully electrified building. The rally would witness the last great speech Macdonald made.\n\nThe Empire’s headline also hinted at the problems festering among the Liberals. Former leader Edward Blake was unhappy with the party’s direction regarding a key campaign issue. Following his defeat in the 1887 election, the party pursued a policy promoting “unrestricted reciprocity” with the United States. The idea was to loosen the heavy tariffs on goods Macdonald’s government had applied via the National Policy since the late 1870s. What unnerved Blake was the fervour displayed by policy architects like Oxford South MP Sir Richard Cartwright toward a potential effect: a commercial union with the Americans which could lead to full annexation.\n\nBlake decided not to run again in his West Durham riding. He ordered the Liberal-dominated Globe to print a letter in late January 1891 outlining his issues with the Liberal stance on trade. Globe editor John Willison, realizing the damage the letter could inflict, stalled as long as he could. It took a visit by Blake’s successor, Wilfrid Laurier, to Blake’s home, Humewood, near St. Clair Avenue, to convince the former leader to wait to publish the letter until the campaign was over.\n\nCartoon by J.W. Bengough depicting John A. Macdonald and Oliver Mowat. Grip, March 7, 1891.\n\nAs for Cartwright, he loved irritating the Conservative press even if his comments made fellow Grits grimace. “No other leading Liberal had his legendary capacity to make comments and take actions that could so disastrously embarrass the party, especially when it came to Canadian-American relations,” observed Christopher Pennington in his book The Destiny of Canada: Macdonald, Laurier, and the Election of 1891. “Cartwright, to the great delight of the Conservatives, never seemed to appreciate the patriotism of most ordinary Canadians.” During a speech in Boston on January 30, Cartwright noted that Canadian land and resources potentially added up to “the addition of half a continent for commercial purposes, and the creation of a complete new tier of Northern States.”\n\nLike Cartwright, fellow Liberal loose cannon Edward Farrer had once backed the Tories. But now he was the chief editorial writer at the Globe, where he endorsed economic union. Before the election, both men travelled south to discuss future political and trade scenarios with American officials. So did Macdonald, who held secret talks with US Secretary of State James Blaine in January 1891. The PM couldn’t keep his mouth shut, and thought he could outfox the Liberals with a limited free-trade deal. When the Empire leaked details, Blaine denied any discussions. With that plan scuttled, the Tories framed the election around loyalty. Would Canadians back a party aiming to sell us to the Americans, or one who remained true to the country and the British Empire? As the famous campaign poster put it, the Conservatives offered “the old flag, the old policy, the old leader.”\n\nWhile Macdonald was holed up, he prepared the campaign manifesto, whose loyalty-stressing conclusion contained one of his most famous quotes:\n\nAs for myself, my course is clear. A British subject I was born—a British subject I will die. With my utmost effort, with my latest breath, I oppose the veiled treason which attempts by sordid means and mercenary profit to lure our people from their allegiance. During my long public service of nearly half-a-century, I have been true to my country and its best interests, and I appeal with equal confidence to the men who have trusted me in the past, and to the young hope of the future, with whom rests its destinies for the future, to give me their united and strenuous aid in this, my last effort, for the unity of the Empire and the preservation of our commercial and political freedom.\n\n“Knowing that his end was near,” observed biographer Richard Gwyn, “and knowing also that most Canadians knew it, Macdonald by these devices was challenging voters to stay with him, their founding father, in the last he would ever make to them to remain Canadian rather than become Americans.\n\nRally day was unseasonably warm. By 6 p.m. thousands had gathered on King Street outside the Academy of Music, a throng later estimated to be around 15,000. Pushing and shoving reigned. Sharp-dressed attendees were caked in mud and slush up to their knees. The hot rumour was that Macdonald had damaging goods proving an alleged conspiracy by the Globe to sell out the country.\n\nThis rumour worried one man in the crowd. John Willison feared that whatever the Prime Minister had on his paper might spark a riot leading back to the Globe’s office at Yonge and Melinda. He arranged for 50 police officers to protect the paper while he watched the rally unfold.\n\nFront page, the News, February 18, 1891.\n\nPolice were overwhelmed at the Academy, where the crowd cut off carriage traffic. They barely held the throng back when Tories given advance tickets were admitted just after 6 p.m. When the main doors opened at 7 p.m., around 4,000 people squeezed in. “The standing ways and aisles were all blocked, and pyramids of men were piled up in the corners,” the News reported. Several women fainted during the surge. Seats were ripped out to make more room. A gas lamp outside was destroyed, causing a gas rupture which forced organizers to turn on the electricity inside.\n\nSome people tried alternative methods to get in, creating money-making opportunities. One person charged a quarter to lead attendees one by one through a back staircase into the rafters. Another levied a toll (which rose from a nickel to a quarter) to scale a fence with a ladder. Among those who took the latter route was opening speaker Charles Tupper, who couldn’t enter via the front door when the crowd failed to give him space. The heavy-set, heavily dressed politician had a few antsy moments on the ladder and almost fell into a pile of bricks during his descent.\n\nMacdonald arrived via carriage from the Queen’s Hotel (now the site of the Royal York) around 7:35 p.m. It took 10 minutes to enter the building, as the crowd outside demanded a speech. Rally chairman W.R. Brock finally formed a wedge to let the PM in. Inside, Macdonald saw a hall covered in mottos. There were the patriotic (“Canada for the Canadians”), the flattering (“Hail to Our Chieftain”), and a few cheap shots at annexationists.\n\nBrock’s attempt to start the rally at 8 p.m was delayed by the audience’s euphoria. As Tupper was delayed by his ladder journey, future Toronto mayor Emerson Coatsworth warmed up the room with a brief talk. When Tupper finally appeared onstage, the audience hooted and hollered for eons. “I always knew our great leader was a very popular man, but I never appreciated it fully until I attempted to gain entrance to this hall tonight,” Tupper noted. He then joked, “I think the best thing we can adopt on the present occasion is a little unrestricted reciprocity in the way of order.” He sat down until police calmed the overexcited crowd, which included a few hecklers who were ejected.\n\nTupper roused the crowd with a long speech outlining Tory accomplishments over the previous 13 years and attacking annexationists. He found it difficult to stop talking, but he reached a point where he conceded, “I must not take up more of your time.”\n\nThen the headliner took the stage. The Empire described the scene:\n\nThe old man stood up, and as, in the fullness of his years, he leaned slightly forward there was a sudden outburst from the audience that fairly shook the building from its vaulted roof to its foundations. The entire gathering arose and yelled. Handkerchiefs, hats, umbrellas, walking sticks, programmes, and in fact everything within reach, were waved by the audience. The enthusiastic uproar was deafening. The grand old man stood there motionless as his heart throbbed within his honoured breast. This was one of the rewards that fall to the lot of a man who has spent his whole life labouring for the benefit of his race. It was a proud minute for Sir John.\n\nWhen the cheering finally stopped, someone yelled, “For he’s a jolly good fellow,” prompting the audience to erupt into song. It took the pinning of a bouquet to Macdonald’s jacket to bring silence to the hall.\n\nLeft: cartoon, the News, March 6, 1891. Right: cartoon, the World, March 5, 1891.\n\nMacdonald appeared frail and couldn’t be heard beyond the first few rows. He joked about his condition, referring to himself as “the aged leader—perhaps the weak and inefficient leader.” When the crowd shouted, “No! No!” Macdonald replied, “But the honest and well-intentioned leader.” He discussed the years he spent in Toronto while out of office during the mid-1870s, and how the National Policy benefitted the city’s manufacturing sector. He gradually slipped into attacked the treasonous annexationists among the Liberals, a threat he probably knew he was overplaying.\n\nThen he pulled out what everyone had waited for: a pamphlet written for an American client by Edward Farrer that showed how Canada could be brought to heel economically. Proofs of the pamphlet were stolen by a printer loyal to the Tories. The work was intended to discuss Canadian-American relations from the viewpoint of an imaginary American, was not authorized by the Liberals, and was not intended for public consumption. When Macdonald got hold of it, he showed it to the governor general, Lord Stanley (of hockey cup fame), who felt it was slight.\n\nStill, its mere existence provided attack material for Macdonald. He suggested Farrer might be in the crowd—which he was, standing next to Willison. “I am very glad that he is, because he will hear what I have to say,” Macdonald gloated. He portrayed the pamphlet as a sign of sinister intent. He also depicted Sir Richard Cartwright, not Laurier, as the true architect of Liberal policy. “I do not think he can,” he told the supportive audience, “in any decency, keep the title he got from the Queen when he becomes Senator for Ontario.” He ended his speech by promising to show the Americans that Canadians valued their nation. “I would say,” he concluded, “the sooner the grass was growing over my grave the better, rather than that I should see the degradation of the country which I have loved so much and which I have served so long.”\n\nSeveral men sitting on the platform then erupted into an impromptu ditty called “We Will Hang Ed Farrar on a Sour Apple Tree.” More cheers and songs followed until the crowd finally dispersed around 11 p.m. Macdonald held an informal reception on the platform before returning to his hotel.\n\nThe city’s Tory papers were ecstatic. The official organ, the Empire, hyperbolically called the rally “the greatest political meeting ever held in Canada….One that will exist without a peer in the political history of the Dominion.” The World felt that “the interior of that building presented a sight the inspiration of which cannot be conveyed into print.” The Telegram advised caution, feeling that calling leading Liberals traitors wasn’t justified: “Tin sounds loudest in Sir John’s thunder. Its roar is largely artificial, but the shrill small note of truth is in it.”\n\nAt the Globe, Willison spent the night figuring out how to address Macdonald’s charges. Front-page coverage was given to a Laurier speech in Montreal. On the editorial page, Willison dismissed the credibility of the treason charges. Farrer was given an editorial page column to defend himself. He admitted writing the pamphlet, discussed its origins, and felt no shame about it. He was free to write whatever he wanted in his off-hours.\n\nMacdonald embarked on a grueling tour of Ontario over the next week, using Toronto as his base. After a speech in Kingston on February 24, personal secretary Joseph Pope was alarmed by his leader’s appearance. As historian Donald Creighton put it, Macdonald’s face was “grey, grey with fatigue, grey with another kind of fatigue which was the final exhaustion of a life.” Suffering from bronchitis and other ailments, he rested in both Kingston and Ottawa.\n\nMacdonald was at his Ottawa home, Earnscliffe, when the results began rolling in on March 5. He went to sleep around 10 p.m., having heard only a fraction of the returns. Fears that the public was tired of the Conservatives proved unjustified—while they lost a few seats, the party maintained a healthy majority and increased its percentage of the popular vote. Macdonald’s platform had carried off one last victory.\n\nSir John A. Macdonald statue, Queen’s Park, 1910. Toronto Public Library.\n\nPostscript\n\nWhen Parliament resumed on April 29, 1891, Macdonald brought his son Hugh, who was elected as MP for Winnipeg, into the House of Commons. A series of strokes beginning on May 12 gradually deteriorated the prime minister’s condition. At 10:25 p.m on June 6, 1891, Joseph Pope met with reporters hovering outside Earnscliffe: “Gentlemen, Sir John Macdonald is dead. He died at a quarter past 10, without pain and in peace.”\n\nFour men filled out Macdonald’s term. The first, Sir John Abbott, reluctantly accepted the job for the next year and a half. His replacement, Sir John Thompson, may be best known for dying of a heart attack after sitting down for lunch at Windsor Castle in December 1894. Charles Tupper was Thompson’s logical successor but Governor General Lord Aberdeen (and Lady Aberdeen) despised him. When Mackenzie Bowell flopped as PM, Tupper took over for the 1896 election campaign, becoming Canada’s shortest-serving leader.\n\nThe Liberals quickly dumped unrestricted reciprocity as a party policy. Edward Blake’s letter was printed following the election, and was as unflattering as party brass feared. Blake took a seat in the British House of Commons representing an Irish riding in 1892. That same year, Edward Farrer left the Globe, thanks to Ontario premier Oliver Mowat’s irritation over his annexationist views. Farrer remained associated with the party and became one of Laurier’s trouble shooters.\n\nThe Academy of Music survived extensive damage caused during the rally. It was soon renamed the Princess Theatre. Destroyed by fire in 1915, it was rebuilt only to be demolished in 1930 to make way for the southern extension of University Avenue.\n\nOn the issue of treason during the campaign, Christopher Pennington offered this summary:\n\nThe truth is that both the Conservatives and Liberals acted patriotically during the campaign. They simply had contrasting ideas for the future of the country, ideas rooted in different but equally legitimate conceptions of the meaning of Canadian nationalism. The clash of these ideas was the real “great issue” of the election of 1891.\n\nSources: John A. Macdonald: The Old Chieftain by Donald Creighton (Toronto: Macmillan, 1955); Nation Maker: Sir John A.

Beyond his role in the 1891 campaign, the piece noted that while Farrer was an excellent journalist, he stirred up anti-French and anti-Catholic feelings during his editorship of the Mail, especially in the aftermath of the Northwest Rebellion. Macdonald also made the list, for his policies towards First Nations during this era.\n\nA February 26, 1891 Mail editorial addressed its take on the scandal involving its former editor. Here’s how it opened:\n\nNothing could mark the malignant madness of faction more signally, or more shamefully than the means which in this contest has been taken, when arguments failed to blacken the character of opponents. Are the confidential concerns of our printing house, the sanctity of the desks containing our private correspondence, and the common laws of honesty which forbid to steal or wittingly to receive stolen goods, to be given to the winds in order that a party leader may gain a political victory over his opponent? Practices like these are becoming more common in our elections, and it is time for social morality and its independent organs to protest.\n\nProtest maybe, but this has never stopped such leaks and stories into the present.\n\nThe Empire, February 21, 1891.\n\nFew topics were left untouched in the Empire‘s pro-Conservative propaganda.

Notes on the candidates:\n\nFrederick Charles Denison, who had led Canadian troops in Sudan in the mid-1880s, won his seat by the largest majority of any candidate in Ontario. He would not finish his term, dying of stomach cancer in 1896.\n\nGeorge Cockburn‘s resume included a stint as principal of Upper Canada College. He represented Toronto Centre from 1887 to 1896.\n\nEmerson Coatsworth would represent Toronto East for one term, before being defeated by Telegram publisher John Ross Robertson in 1896. He later served as the city’s mayor in 1906-1907.\n\nNathaniel Clarke Wallace served as MP for York West from 1878 until his death in 1901. He was also a high-ranking member of the Orange Lodge.\n\nWilliam Findlay Maclean was the only unsuccessful candidate of this quartet…for the moment. Losing to former Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie, Maclean won a by-election the following year after Mackenzie died and stayed in office through 1926. Party ties would explain the Empire’s endorsement, as Maclean published the rival Toronto World.\n\nThe Empire, March 6, 1891.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Empire’s victory coverage was overflowing with ecstasy. By contrast, the Globe‘s front page ran the tiny one-column headline “A Black Eye.” Though happy that the Tories won, the Telegram extended condolences to local losing Liberal candidates, “Liberalism chose blameless men for its standard bearers in the city,” an editorial observed. “In Centre Toronto their candidate [lawyer James Kerr] was especially strong, but the party’s policy was heavy a load for its unfortunate victims.”\n\nThis is an expanded version of a piece originally published as a “Historicist” column on Torontoist on November 1, 2008.\n\nClose up of Queen’s Hotel (site of Royal York Hotel), October 21, 1915. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1231, Item 1108a.\n\nFor over a century-and-a-half, the northeast corner of Front and York Streets has offered tourists and dignitaries a place to lay their head. Its central location and easy access to a major transportation hub made the intersection an ideal spot for a hotel ever since the first passenger train pulled out of a nearby platform in 1853. The Royal York carries on a tradition of hospitality with a regal moniker from its predecessor, the Queen’s Hotel.\n\nSwords Hotel, Front Street, circa 1855-1857. Toronto Public Library, JRR 342 Cab III.\n\nThe first elements of the hotel were built in 1844 as four row houses designed by John Howard, who later bequeathed High Park to the city. After a decade housing Knox College, the homes were combined and opened for business as Sword’s Hotel around 1856 (while the hotel appears to have officially opened in August 1856, ads calling for workmen suggest it was leased to operated as a hotel as early as November 1855). Most of the early clientele were government officials—when the colonial capital was moved to Quebec City the following year, operator Patrick Sword followed. A decade of expansions and name changes followed, with the name “Queen’s Hotel” permanently adopted after Thomas Dick, who had owned the land since the early 1840s, assumed management in 1862.\n\nToronto Called Back From 1894 to 1847 (Toronto: William Briggs, 1894)\n\nFrom the mid-1870s the hotel was operated by Henry Winnett and Thomas McGaw, who also operated the Queen’s Royal Hotel in Niagara-on-the-Lake.\n\nWriting room at the Queen’s Hotel, possibly between 1908 and 1912. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 540.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the hotel had gained a reputation as one of the city’s most fashionable spots. Its location near the Ontario legislature (which was located on the north side of Front Street between John and Simcoe until moving to Queen’s Park in 1892) and several incarnations of Union Station brought in tourists, businessmen, and politicians. Among those whose names graced the hotel’s register were the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII) and several of his siblings, Grand Duke Alexis of Russia (Alexei Alexandrovich), numerous Governors-General, and American Civil War figures Jefferson Davis and William Tecumseh Sherman. The Queen’s offered over 210 rooms, 17 private parlours, a fine restaurant, croquet and tennis courts, and private gardens. It was one of the first Canadian hotels to provide phones and running water in each room.\n\nQueen’s Hotel, 19o8. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 333.\n\nSome observations from a profile of the hotel published in Toronto Illustrated in 1893:\n\nIn every respect The Queen’s is the most prominent, fashionable and best known hotel in the Dominion. It is largely due to this realization of its superiority that has caused it to be so liberally patronized by royalty and the nobility as well as by the prominent people of Canada and the United States. This hotel is more like the finest seen at fashionable watering places like Saratoga than the usual city hotel…Facing the lovely bay and lake, it is ever cool and pleasant in summer, commands a magnificent view, and is surrounded by umbrageous shade trees, floral parks with fountains, etc. so that the premises continually remind one of country surroundings in the city.\n\nTwo men beside a buffet at the Queen’s Hotel, possibly between 1908 and 1912. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 542.\n\nFine furniture, such as the buffet these two gentlemen begrudgingly posed in front of, was a highlight of the hotel. The city archives note that this piece, carved from black walnut, was built by Toronto-based Jacques and Hay for display at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876.\n\nAll images of pamphlet: Toronto Public Library.\n\nThis pamphlet, published in 1926, gives a sense of how the hotel marketed itself during the Roaring Twenties, and a glimpse of the new Union Station rising across the street.\n\nClosing of Queen’s Hotel, 1927. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1244, Item 3171.\n\nAs the new Union Station neared completion, the Canadian Pacific Railway scouted the neighbourhood for a site suitable to build a grand hotel. The Queen’s Hotel’s location made it an ideal acquisition, which the CPR made in February 1927 for just over $1 million. The new owners announced that the Queen’s would remain in business until the end of the Canadian National Exhibition in September. The new hotel’s name was revealed at the end of June, prompting an anonymous historian to complain to the editorial page of The Globe:\n\nBut why is it necessary to use a new name instead of continuing with the old one…which for many years occupied the site and was so well and favourably known. Besides being a suitable name, it would preserve the historical continuity of the old hostelry which filled so large a place in this city’s life in days gone by. There may be some important reasons why the name cannot be carried on, but they are not apparent to an ordinary citizen.\n\nDemolition of the Queen’s Hotel, 1927. Toronto Star Photo Archive, Toronto Public Library, tspa_0113510f.\n\nThe last guests checked in on September 10, 1927. That evening resembled a school reunion, as frequent guests, long-term residents, and hotel staff gathered to send off the Queen’s. In an interview with The Star, the hotel manager indicated that the impending closure had not sunk in for regular clientele:\n\nI expect that we shall have some difficulty getting rid of them, too. It’s strange how many still cling to the old house. There are people who come here because they come here because they came here when they were children, as their fathers did before them; you can find the same names on our books as there were in the first year the hotel opened. I have had a number of letters from people saying what a shame it is that the Queen’s should be pulled down; one man even wanted a question asked in parliament about it.\n\nAs another reporter summed up the night, “Oldtimers stepped in on tiptoe as if there were a coffin in the parlour and laid on it rare orchids of anecdotes and fragrant wreaths of memory.” An orchestra closed the final dinner with a round of “Auld Lang Syne.”\n\n“To be reproduced in the C.P.R.’s palatial hostelry, the renowned Red Parlor at the Queen’s Hotel; Toronto; where royalty has rested and other distinguished visitors from all over the world have enjoyed comforts. It was a favorite room of the late Sir John A. Macdonald and if its walls could they could unfold state secrets.” Photo likely taken in September 1927. Toronto Star Photo Archive, Toronto Public Library, tspa_0113511f.\n\nThe last person to check out the following day was long-time “Red Parlor” resident Charles Bland. His lodgings, named for the colour of its carpeting and decor, had previously been reserved for dignitaries, but was most associated with Sir John A. Macdonald, who favoured it for cutting political deals whenever he was in town. “Mr. Bland did not give his reactions to the shock of departure,” the Star reported, “but it needed no great effort of imagination to get an idea of what it meant to be torn from such a room. Even an iconoclast who scorned the past would be delighted with it…Old as it is, it is the acme of present-day comfort.”\n\nThe Globe, September 10, 1927.\n\nWhile there were indications that the Red Parlor would be duplicated in the Royal York, its furnishings were among the 30,000 decor items, some of “unusual historical importance,” that were auctioned off over four days starting on September 20. Demolition began quickly and the Queen’s successor opened for business less than two years later, in June 1929.\n\nIn their final thoughts about the Queen’s Hotel, The Star believed that “[T]he Royal York…will no doubt have many glories in addition to a tunnel from the station, but perhaps on the tongues of the spielers in the tourist buses it will have no greater fame than this. ‘On this site stood the Queen’s.’”\n\nSources: Lost Toronto by William Dendy (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1993); Toronto Illustrated 1893 (Toronto: Consolidated Ilustrating Co., 1893); Toronto Past and Present by C.

Keep in mind while reading this that “current” means the 2011 federal campaign, not 2019 (see update section).\n\nWhy is Bob Rae so happy? The Globe and Mail, June 19, 1985.\n\nThroughout the current election campaign, Conservative leader Stephen Harper has blasted the opposition parties for conspiring to form a “reckless” coalition government that would ruin the nation’s stability, despite his own participation in talks to form an alliance in 2004 with horrifying socialists in the NDP and unholy separatists in the Bloc Québécois. While the long-term results of Harper’s fear-mongering and of other candidates’ denials regarding their willingness to form governing alliances are yet to be determined, it is not necessarily true that a coalition would result in disaster. Heck, if it wasn’t for a coalition, Harper might not be campaigning to retain his role as Canadian prime minister.\n\nSince the colonies that formed Canada gained responsible government in the mid-19th century, coalitions, or written accords between parties, occasionally dotted the political landscape. The following three examples show the benefits and pitfalls of forming ruling alliances: one formed a nation, one nearly tore it apart, and one broke four decades of uninterrupted rule by the same party.\n\nThree figures of the Grand Coalition: Sir John A. Macdonald, George Brown, and Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché. Library and Archives Canada.\n\nGovernment: The Great Coalition\n\nWhen: 1864 to 1867\n\nWhere: The United Province of Canada, composed of Canada West (Ontario) and Canada East (Quebec)\n\nParties involved: Pretty much everyone—Clear Grits, Liberal-Conservatives, Bleus, and some Rouges\n\nLeaders: Premiers John A. Macdonald (Canada West), Étienne-Paschal Taché, followed by Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau (Canada East)\n\nWhy: Deadlock. The government of the United Province was designed so that, instead of dividing seats by population, each half had equal representation. Unfortunately, like a relationship on the rocks, one half frequently disagreed with the other. By the dawn of the 1860s, the double majority that was effectively required to pass legislation rarely occurred, which led to a succession of short-lived governments. Frustration grew in English-dominated Canada West over its proportion of seats, as its population surpassed that of French-dominated Canada East. When the movement toward uniting the British North American colonies gained steam, a committee headed by Clear Grit leader George Brown looked into the constitutional difficulties the United Province faced. A crisis point was reached when a government headed by Liberal-Conservatives Macdonald and Taché fell by two votes on June 14, 1864. Rather than grant a dissolution of the legislature, Governor General Lord Monck suggested that the fallen government leaders talk to Brown. Despite his deep enmity toward Brown, Macdonald insisted that he be brought into any new government. When Macdonald announced the proposed coalition a few days later, the legislators, as historian W.L. Morton described in his book The Critical Years, reacted with joy:\n\nThe House, wearied of piecemeal and sterile politics, wearied of a prolonged crisis, rose cheering, and leaders and backbenchers alike stumbled into the aisles and poured onto the floor. The leaders shook hands and clapped shoulders; with a spring the little Bleu member for Montcalm, Joseph Dufresne, embraced the tall Brown and hung from the neck of the embarrassed giant. The tension of years of frustration broke in the frantic rejoicing.\n\nResults: Within a few months, the coalition organized conferences in Charlottetown and Quebec City to woo the Maritime colonies into a permanent union. Under the new government framework, seats in the House of Commons were roughly divided by population. Once confederation was achieved in 1867, the coalition dissolved to fight for seats in the Dominion of Canada’s first federal election.\n\nA typical cartoon from the Unionist camp during the 1917 election campaign. The Telegram, December 14, 1917.\n\nGovernment: The Union Government\n\nWhen: 1917 to 1921\n\nWhere: Dominion of Canada\n\nParties involved: Conservatives, pro-conscription Liberals, a few independents\n\nLeaders: Prime Ministers Robert Borden (1917 to 1920) and Arthur Meighen (1920 to 1921)\n\nWhy: As the First World War entered its fourth year, casualties among Canadian troops outpaced the number of fresh volunteers. Under pressure from Great Britain (which experienced two coalition governments during the war) to provide more manpower, Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden determined that, despite the objections he knew would arise from farmers bemoaning the loss of family labour and Quebec voters who despised military officials who refused to create French-only battalions, conscription was required. Borden hoped for support from all parties when a conscription bill was introduced in May 1917 and began coalition talks with Liberal leader Wilfrid Laurier. A sticking point was Laurier’s wish to hold an overdue election as a referendum on the issue (Canadians should have voted in 1916, but Borden received a year’s reprieve from the governor general due to the conflict), which Borden felt would be a waste of energy better expended for the war effort.\n\nHarsh words directed at the “quitters” in Quebec, along with the extension of the federal vote to women for the first time (under certain conditions), are among the highlights of this Unionist ad. The Telegram, December 10, 1917.\n\nBy the end of August 1917, conscription was law. Despite objections from some highly partisan members of the Tory caucus (whom Borden felt lacked “the spirit which prompted our young men to cross the sea and go over the parapet. All of them are backward and cowardly”), Borden assembled a cabinet in mid-October that included a handful of pro-conscription Liberals and independent MPs. When an election was called, Borden’s coalition ran under the Unionist banner against Liberals still loyal to Laurier. During the campaign, Unionist propaganda demonized Quebec and anyone else who didn’t support conscription, and tarred Laurier for forcing an election the country didn’t need. To warp the vote their way, the government enfranchised female relatives of soldiers and disenfranchised anyone who emigrated to Canada after 1902 from certain so-called enemy nations. After the votes were cast on December 17, the Unionists won 153 seats. The Liberals won all but three of the 65 seats in Quebec, but only captured 20 outside of la belle province.\n\nResults: Conscription proved problematic, as most conscripts sought exemptions to service (which led the government to cancel all exemptions in April 1918), and riots broke out in Quebec. After the war ended, the government continued to wield a heavy hand as it attempted to crush postwar outbreaks of labour unrest such as the Winnipeg General Strike. After Borden’s retirement in 1920, new Prime Minister Meighen hoped to forge the coalition into a new permanent party and campaigned during the following year’s election under the banner of the National Liberal and Conservative party. It wasn’t to be, as Meighen finished third behind William Lyon Mackenzie King’s Liberals and the new Progressive party. Long term, Quebec proved its capacity for a long memory by refusing to provide the majority of its federal seats to the Tories until John Diefenbaker’s landslide victory in 1958. During the Second World War, the Conservatives again proposed a coalition government, but King refused to go along.\n\nDavid Peterson and Bob Rae sign the accord under which they soon governed Ontario. The Toronto Sun, May 29, 1985.\n\nGovernment: Liberal-NDP Accord\n\nWhen: 1985 to 1987\n\nWhere: Ontario\n\nParties involved: Liberals, New Democrats\n\nLeaders: Premier David Peterson, NDP leader Bob Rae\n\nWhy: After 42 years in power, the wheels fell off the Big Blue Machine. Whether it was due to the Progressive Conservative party’s rightward shift under new leader Frank Miller, outrage from the party base over outgoing Premier William Davis’s announcement of full funding for Catholic schools to grade 13, or general fatigue with the party having been in power for so long, May 2, 1985, was not a good night for Ontario Tories. Though the Tories wound up with the most seats, the seat numbers (52 PC, 48 Liberal, 25 NDP) made it all but impossible for Miller to provide a functional government. With Bob Rae in a kingmaking position, talks began between the NDP and the other parties. Though the progressive party traditionally found the Liberals more odious than the Tories, the rightward tilt of the government-in-waiting Miller was assembling (which included fresh-faced ministers Ernie Eves, Mike Harris, and Bob Runciman) made Liberal leader David Peterson a more attractive partner. Key NDP officials were nervous about forming a proper coalition, worried that the party would be subsumed into the Liberal fold or experience heavy losses in the following election as the federal NDP had after it propped up Pierre Trudeau’s government from 1972 to 1974. An accord was reached whereby for two years Peterson would be premier, the NDP would not trigger any non-confidence votes, and both parties would support legislation for programs ranging from reforming rent regulations to pay equity for women.\n\nOn June 18, 1985, the Miller government was defeated on a non-confidence vote over its throne speech. After his defeat, Miller launched a vicious attack on the opposition, suggesting that Peterson and Rae were engaged in unnatural acts to kill his government, and that Ontario would be “held economic hostage by a Liberal and NDP lynch mob.” He also noted that the NDP had “prostituted themselves for power” and warned that the accord would be the party’s death warrant. The next day, Miller advised Lieutenant-Governor John Black Aird to ask Peterson to form a government instead of dissolving the legislature for another election.\n\nResults: As per the accord, legislation for pay equity and other issues of shared importance to the Liberals and the NDP passed, and Ontarians were spared an election for two years. Peterson reaped the benefits of the accord, as he led the Liberals to a landslide victory in 1987. Though the NDP lost four seats, Bob Rae became leader of the opposition thanks to a total collapse of the Tories under Miller’s successor Larry Grossman.\n\nAdditional material from The Critical Years: The Union of British North America 1857-1873 by W.L.
