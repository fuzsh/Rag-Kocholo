    "text": "Edith O. Dwyer, 80, of East Jordan, Mich., and formerly of Morenci, Mich., died March 2, 2021, at her daughter’s home in East Jordan.\n\nShe was born Jan. 14, 1941, in Morenci, the daughter of Jerald and Pauline (Schaeffer) Johnson. She was the third of five children and was raised to work and cherish the country life.\n\nEdith went to Morenci High School and it was there that she met her future husband, Duane. She and Duane married right out of school and moved to Lincoln Park and then to New Boston as he worked for Ford Motor Company.\n\nEdith raised her children in New Boston, but moved with Duane back to her roots in Morenci in 2001. In Morenci she was an active member of the Garden Club and was known locally for her beautiful gardens. She spent many a day beautifying her home with plants and flowers. She was an avid canner of the rich produce from her yearly gardens.\n\nHer daughter Jodie was born in 1963 and Edith was thrilled to be a mother. Though she couldn’t have a large family, she and Duane adopted a son, Mitchell, in 1969. The whole family enjoyed boating, hunting, fishing, canoeing and travel. Duane often said that Edith was the best fishing partner he ever had. She wasn’t afraid to bait a hook or land a catch. On one particular fishing trip Edith and Duane went to a remote fishing camp in Canada and were blessed to find themselves fishing and lodging with hockey star Gordie Howe and his sons.\n\nEdith nurtured her daughter and other local girls by volunteering in a leadership position with the Girl Scouts. She enjoyed bowling with her many friends, enjoying the highest average most any particular night.\n\nShe suffered with Stargardt Disease from an early age. This rare disease affected her eyesight and rendered her legally blind for much of her adult years.\n\nEdith had a wonderful sense of humor and was a friend to all. She was compassionate to her neighbors and total strangers. She visited and offered food to anyone whom she heard was in need.\n\nShe and her friend Yvonne had a small housecleaning business for a number of years as well as working for a local orchard making donuts and Christmas wreaths. Edith was always busy and worked from sun up until sundown.\n\nEdith and Duane welcomed and hosted many of Jodie and Mitch’s friends. The Dwyer household was a refuge for anyone who befriended their children. Even when Mitch was tragically killed in 1988 by a drunk driver, Mitch’s friends were forever welcome at the Dwyer house.\n\nWhen Duane passed away in July of last year, Edith moved in with her daughter and her husband in East Jordan and lived out her final days relaxing in her recliner and spending hours watching the fire in the hearth.\n\nEdith loved her seven grandchildren. Since her eyesight restricted her reading from a book, she made up beautiful stories to her grandchildren. They looked forward to her visits and thoughts of new fictional adventures.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter Jodie (and Jeff) Crane of East Jordan; grandchildren Joshua Atwood of Brooklyn, N.Y., Jenna (and Kevin) Atwood-Tarczon, Janie Atwood and Julie Atwood, all of Portland, Ore., Jordan (and Anny) Atwood of Bozeman, Mont., Jilliann Atwood of Detroit, Mich., and Joseph Atwood of East Jordan.\n\nIn addition to her husband and her son, she was preceded in death by her parents and her siblings, Samuel, Robert, Audrey and Raymond.\n\nEdith will be buried with her husband and son in Morenci’s Oak Grove Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions are suggested to the Oregon Center for the Blind, Moms and Tots of Ellsworth or Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n\nArrangements are by Gaylord Community Funeral Home & Cremation Service."
