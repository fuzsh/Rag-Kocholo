One of the Fathers of the Confederation, Macdonald has also served as Prime Minister to the country for nineteen years, one of the longest term served, second only to William Lyon Mackenzie. Macdonald passed away in 1891 in Ottawa and was buried in Kingston's Cataraqui Cemetery. Considered one of the most beautiful and oldest cemeteries in the city, it is an apt final resting place for the iconic leader. The Macdonald's gravesite, along with the cemetery, was deemed a National Historic Site of Canada in 2011.",
