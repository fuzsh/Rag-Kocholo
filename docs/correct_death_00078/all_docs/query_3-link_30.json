        "text": "Sir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815 - 6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada. He served from 1867-1873, and again from 1878-1891.\n\nHis time in office saw the expansion of Canada from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts; the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway; the creation of Canada's first spy service, the Western Frontier Constabulary, its first federal police force, the Dominion Police, and the famed North-West Mounted Police; and he began the slow transformation of the Canadian Militia into an organised force. Macdonald was the dominant force behind the British North America Act and Canadian Confederation.\n\nWhile Macdonald supported suffrage for women and the Aboriginal people of Canada, he disagreed with extending the vote to people of Chinese descent because of what he perceived as irreconcilable cultural differences. Modern criticism has been raised over his role in designing and passing restrictive legislation pertaining to the Indigenous population of Canada, the implementation of the Residential School system, as well as his role in ending the Red River and North-West Rebellions.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nMemorials and Monuments[]\n\nGravesite[]\n\nMacdonald's gravesite in Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston, Ontario, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.[1][2] On 1 July 2020, two plaques at the site were vandalised.[3]\n\nSir John A.

English sculptor George Edward Wade was selected for the project. The statue was shipped from London, placed, and covered prior to the unveiling.\n\nPrime Minister Sir John Thompson unveiled the statue on 1 November 1893, to the sounds of the crowd cheering and the 13th Battalion band playing \"Hail to the Chief\".\n\n20th Century[]\n\nThe statue was moved in 1907 to its current location in Gore Park, where it remains to this day.[4]\n\n21st Century[]\n\nHamilton members of the Sir John A. Macdonald started a petition drive asking the city not to remove the monument in 2018, citing the statue's historic value as the first statue of Macdonald in Canada, and the first statue in Gore Park. There were fears the statue would be removed to accommodate construction of Hamilton's new Light Rail Transit system.[5]\n\nThe statue was toppled on 14 August 2021.[6][7][8]\n\nMacdonald Monument[]\n\nThe Macdonald Monument was opened on 6 June 1895, and was located at Place du Canada, in Montreal, Quebec. It was also sculpted by Wade.[9]\n\nOn 29 August 2020, the statue was toppled and subsequently decapitated by protesters affiliated with the Coalition for BIPOC Liberation, at the culmination of a protest around defunding of the police.[10]\n\nBellevue House[]\n\nMacdonald's residence from 1848 to 1849, Bellevue House, is a National Historic Site of Canada.[11]\n\nPopular Culture[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nVariants[]\n\nThe following list is of explicit appearances of Sir John A.
