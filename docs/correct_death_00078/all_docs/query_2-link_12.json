        "text": "(1815–91). The first prime minister of the Dominion of Canada was Scottish-born statesman Sir John A. Macdonald. He held that office from 1867 to 1873 and again from 1878 to 1891. Macdonald had a genius for leadership. He was guided throughout his career by his loyalty to the British Empire and his wish to maintain Canada’s independence from the United States.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, on January 11, 1815, John Alexander Macdonald was only five years old when his family moved to Canada. He was able to attend school only to the age of 15, but he continued reading on his own. Macdonald found work in a law office and was admitted to the bar at 21. Eight years later, in 1844, he was elected to the Canadian Assembly. Almost at once he became one of the leaders of the Conservative Party, winning a cabinet position within three years.\n\nBy 1864 the union of Upper and Lower Canada, formed in 1841, was fast drifting into chaos because of party warfare and petty jealousies. Macdonald’s political tact made him the leader in the negotiations that in 1867 brought about the establishment of the Dominion of Canada, and he became the first prime minister. That same year he was also knighted in recognition of his services to the British Empire."
