        "text": "Please click here to be connected to the livestream of the Funeral Mass.\n\nJohn C. \"Jack\" MacDonald, age 89, of Audubon, PA passed away peacefully on Friday, March 5, 2021.\n\nJack was born in Newtown Square, PA, and was preceded in death by his parents, John and Marie (Githens) MacDonald and his three older sisters.\n\nJack has been a resident of Shannondell at Valley Forge for nine years and was a member of St. Teresa of Avila RC Church. He was a former resident of King of Prussia, where he was a 50-year parishioner of Mother of Divine Providence RC Church, where he taught catechism as a new member of the community.\n\nJack was drafted by the U.S. Army and was sent to Korea, proudly serving with the 7th Infantry Division from 1952 to 1954, and rose to the rank of Sergeant. Following his honorable discharge from the Army, Jack went to college on the G.I. Bill and graduated from St. Joseph’s University in 1960, earning a Bachelor of Science Degree in Finance. He then began a long and successful career in business, retiring as the Chief Financial Officer for Gallagher Fluid Seals, Inc.\n\nJack was an accomplished runner and enjoyed daily morning runs through Valley Forge National Park before going to work. He loved competing in annual distance runs including the Philadelphia Half Marathon and the Broad Street Run. Jack also volunteered as a Community Diabetes Representative for the former Montgomery Hospital. He was a loyal Philadelphia sports fan and was passionate about the Flyers and Eagles.\n\nJack enjoyed reading, playing bridge, discussing current events, traveling with his wife and taking ocean cruises with his entire family of twenty-two. Above all, however, Jack loved and cared deeply for his family.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory, are his beloved wife of 60 years, Helen A. (Schick) MacDonald of Audubon, PA; daughter, Maureen (Rich) Grisan of Rochester Hills, MI; son, Jack (Linda) MacDonald of Atherton, CA; daughter, Maryellen (Tom) Charno of Hockessin, DE; and daughter, Mara (Rob) Stern of Audubon, PA. Jack, or “Pop-Pop”, is also survived by twelve grandchildren, Richard, Sean and Jack Grisan; Hunter, Grace and Hallie MacDonald; Thomas, Matthew, Luke and Michaela Charno; and Alexa and Andrew Stern; as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nGiven the current health crisis, Jack will be laid to rest in a private Mass of Christian Burial on Wednesday, March 10, 2021. A Celebration of Jack’s life will be held when Covid restrictions are lifted. The Mass will be livestreamed on Wednesday, March 10 at 10:00 AM. The Mass will also be recorded and will be available to watch after it has concluded.
