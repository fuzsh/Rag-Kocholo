This interpretation of the figure and the heritage of John A. Macdonald is, however, far from consensual. The evolution of awareness and values among Canadians, the production of new studies on the historical period, and the recent discoveries of unidentified remains in proximity to former Indian residential schools have helped to uncover a darker side of Macdonald’s heritage: his policies promoting the assimilation and genocide of Indigenous peoples.
