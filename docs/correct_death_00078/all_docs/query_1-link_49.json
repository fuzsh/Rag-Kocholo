Nevertheless, a new revamp is so meticulously critical of its former resident that Parks Canada even took pains to note that the mahogany used in Macdonald’s furniture might have come from Caribbean slave plantations.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

This week, Tristin Hopper takes a journey inside the thoughts of Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nMonday\n\nTake a moment to imagine every place you’ve ever lived: Every student rental, every basement apartment, every starter home. Now imagine that — 130 years after your death — one of those places is turned into a curated, government-funded monument into what a jerk you were. I lived at Bellevue House for, like, a year; my only real memory of the place is that it’s where my infant son died, you ghouls.\n\nI never asked to be remembered like a George Washington or Simon Bolivar, but did they have to go through my toiletries to point out how even my comb was an icon of oppressive, imperialist colonialism? I’m not going to pretend my record stands up to modern scrutiny, but I can assure you that I was able to at least clip my toenails or brush my teeth without feverishly plotting the subjugation of others.\n\nTuesday\n\nSince we’re on the subject of historical narratives, can I point out that my premiership didn’t have “kill the Jews” rallies in Toronto and Montreal every weekend? Canada in that era had plenty of anti-Catholic rallies and some anti-Asian riots, but nobody wanted those people dead. I mean, we weren’t animals.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOh, and if you were convicted of raping and killing a bunch of people in my day, guess what happened? Boom: Hangman’s rope. No faint hope parole hearings; you just put him in the ground as quickly as possible and we all got on with our lives.\n\nBut you’re all much more civilized than me, aren’t you? It’s obviously way more humane to keep the guy in a resort-like prison for a few years before releasing him into the community while warning young women to keep an eye out for the “high risk to reoffend” criminal suddenly in their midst.\n\nWednesday\n\nI’ve noticed drug addiction is also a big deal these days. Hey, guess who knows a little something about addiction? Me, your first prime minister; a guy with such a bad drinking problem that he once lit himself on fire while setting out the final terms of Confederation in London.\n\nI know you don’t want to hear my old-fashioned, retrograde ideas, but I will point out that my comparatively long life was owed in part to the fact that I quit drinking in my 50s. You see, being blasted on alcohol all the time was bad for my health and familial relationships, so my final years were spent sipping milk instead of chugging gin.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNaturally, this was extremely problematic in that it stigmatized my alcohol use and adopted a harmful, abstinence-based approach to my addiction. Just something else to keep that in mind the next time you’re defacing a statue of me.\n\nThursday\n\nIt’s been said that I operated within a uniquely corrupt era in Canadian political history. And I’m not going to pretend they don’t have a point: I’d like to see you try to knit together a bunch of disparate colonies into a centralized confederation without at least a little bit of graft and palm-greasing. Hell, the entire point of the Senate was to be a harmless warehouse for party hacks when you were done with them.\n\nBut even my most unscrupulous instincts must tip their hat to what is now possible. In the 1870s all I had to play with were the occasional patronage post and railway contract. My God what I could do in a government that hands out multi-billion-dollar subsidy contracts to German carmakers without blinking an eye. They didn’t even publish the terms! Do you have any idea how many laws I would have needed to break in the 19th century to do anything close to that?\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFriday\n\nIt is a longstanding Canadian tradition for ex-prime ministers not to comment on the actions of a successor, so I will not stoop to political commentary. But I can suggest that Canada should more closely observe my example of how to treat the privileged son of a longstanding prime minister.\n\nDuring both the Red River Rebellion and the North West Rebellion, I put my son Hugh John into a uniform and sent him right to the front lines. He survived both, and then embarked on an ignominious political career of constantly failing to capitalize on my name and legacy (aside from a few months where he managed to become Premier of Manitoba).\n\nI mean, the kid had no political instincts or talent at governance; it was far better to pass him over in favour of people from less notable lineages who had both of these things. It would have been really dumb to, say, give him unchecked federal power for 10 years just because he reminded people of me.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nGet the latest from Tristin Hopper straight to your inbox\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
