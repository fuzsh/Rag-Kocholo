        "text": "6 June 1891\n\nIn was the spring of 1891. The Conservative Party of Sir John A. Macdonald had just won a bruising election campaign, defeating the Liberal Party under its new leader, Wilfrid Laurier. It was a close call. While retaining a majority in the House of Commons, the Conservatives lost five seats while the Liberals picked up ten. The main campaign issue was trade policy, with Macdonald favouring protective tariffs under his National Policy with the Liberals endorsing reciprocity, i.e., free trade with the United States. Emphasizing continuity, the Conservatives fought and won under the slogan “The Old Flag, The Old Policy, The Old Leader.”\n\nAnd old he was–at least by 19th century standards. At age 76, Sir John was perhaps not as sharp as he had been. But he was still a formidable campaigner on the hustings and a redoubtable speaker in the House. Late Friday night, 22 May, 1891, he was playing defence. The Liberal opposition was condemning the conduct of Sir Charles Tupper, the Conservative-appointed Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, for highly partisan speeches during and following the 1891 General Election. Intervening on a few occasions, Macdonald calmly followed the debate while leaning against the black leather cushion of his armchair, one leg crossed over the other in his usual fashion, with a smile playing on his face.\n\nIt was his last appearance in the House of Commons, the end of a political career that had lasted almost a half century. He had been the last Premier of the old Province of Canada and the first of the new Dominion of Canada after Confederation in 1867. He had held that position for all but five years in the intervening period.\n\nDuring the evening of Wednesday, 27 May, Sir John suffered a mild stroke that left him weak and caused some minor numbness. The effects passed. The general public was not informed. At about 4:15pm on Friday, 29 May, Macdonald was struck by a second, far more serious stroke that left him paralyzed and without speech.\n\nShortly afterwards, Sir Hector Langevin received an urgent message mid-debate in the House of Commons. He immediately crossed the floor to speak to Wilfrid Laurier. The two men conferred and briefly left the Commons’ chamber together. On their return, Sir Hector rose to address the Speaker. His voice trembling, he said: “We have known that for the last few days the premier has been lying ill at his residence. I have the painful duty to announce to the House that the news from Earnscliffe just received is that he has had a relapse and that he is in a most critical condition. We have reports from the medical men attending on the right honourable gentleman, and they do not seem to believe that he can live many hours longer.” With that, Langevin introduced a motion to adjourn the House, seconded by Wilfrid Laurier.\n\nThe stricken prime minister laid in a wide brass-framed bed in an airy room immediately above the main entrance of his residence, Earnscliffe. The bedroom was reportedly furnished in good taste. It contained a large wooden cabinet, a few chairs, and an old-fashioned sofa. The centre of the room was covered by large Turkish rugs. The chamber’s walls were covered with paper of “a subdued tint.”\n\nSir John was attended by three physicians—Dr. R.W. Powell, Sir James Grant, and Dr. Wright—who posted regular bulletins on the gates to Earnscliffe. At 8:00pm on the 28th, Dr. Powell announced that while Sir John was conscious, his condition was critical. The next morning, the doctors reported that Macdonald was growing weaker. However, he was still conscious and could make his needs known.\n\nTelegrams began to pour into Earnscliffe from around the world enquiring about his state of health and offering words of support. These included cables from Queen Victoria, Lord Dufferin, Canada’s governor general from 1872 to 1878, and Lord Stanley, the then incumbent. Police were stationed near the approaches to Earnscliffe to prevent vehicles from disturbing Sir John’s rest.\n\nOver the next few days, Sir John gradually weakened. Occasionally, he took some beef tea or milk for sustenance. By 3 June, his only nourishment was small quantities of diluted champagne. At 4:00pm on Friday, 5 June, he lapsed into unconsciousness. He never awoke. Sir John A. Macdonald died at 10:15pm on Saturday, 6 June 1891. At his bedside was his wife, Lady Macdonald, and son, Mr. Hugh Macdonald (who had just been elected MP for Winnipeg) and Mrs. Macdonald, the Hon. Edgar Dewdney and Mrs. Dewdney, Mr. Joseph Pope, his private secretary, Mr. Fred White, his ex private secretary, Ben Chilton, the prime minister’s trusted messenger as well as other close friends and family.\n\nShortly after his death, the undertaker arrived at Earnscliffe and immediately began the process of embalming Sir John’s body at the residence, a process that took close to six hours. His features were reportedly almost lifelike, except for an extreme paleness of his cheeks. A plaster cast of his face was reportedly taken by Mr. Hamilton McCarthy of Toronto.\n\nAt 2:00pm Sunday, his body was transferred to a casket, and his remains were moved downstairs to the dining room and placed on a pedestal. The room was draped with violet and white hangings. The steel casket was finished in rosewood with silver rods extending its whole length. It had a full glass top with silver edging. Sir John’s body, dressed in the formal gold-laced uniform of an Imperial Privy Councillor, laid on white satin. Lady Macdonald maintained an overnight vigil beside the casket. With her was Mrs. Hugh Macdonald. Close friends came to pay their respects.\n\nOn Parliament Hill, the Canadian Ensign flew at half mast from the Victoria Tower. Inside the House of Commons, great black wreaths hung from the railings of the galleries surrounding the Commons chamber, and over the Speaker’s chair. The central clerk’s table, where the golden mace rested during sittings of the House, was covered with black crepe. Sir John’s seat was also wreathed in black. A pillow of white roses, lilies, and carnations with the inscription “Our Chief,” was placed on his desk. Leading members of both parties, including Sir Hector Langevin and Wilfrid Laurier rose to pay tribute to the late prime minister. Langevin said that “by the death of Sir John Macdonald, Canada has lost its greatest statesman, a great patriot, a man of which any country in the world would be justly proud. Her Majesty, our gracious Queen, never had a more devoted and loyal subject.”\n\nAt midnight 8 June, Rev. J.J. Bogart, the rector of St. Alban’s Church where Sir John and Lady Macdonald worshiped, gave a short service at Earnscliffe. At 5:00am on 9 June, Lady Macdonald bade her husband goodbye for the last time. Sir John’s remains were conveyed from Earnscliffe to the Senate chamber to lay in state. Accompanying the hearse in the first carriage of the procession were the chief mourners, including Macdonald’s son, Hugh. Lady Macdonald did not join the process or the subsequent funeral services. (During the late Victorian period, it was customary for women to not attend funerals.)\n\nAt 10:00am, Lord Stanley, the governor general, entered the Centre Block via the Speaker’s private entrance to meet waiting members of government. They formed a procession to Sir John’s bier with the governor general in the lead carrying a wreath with the inscription “In Loving Memory, Stanley of Preston and Constance Preston.” He placed the wreath at the foot of the casket and then looked for the last time on the visage of his friend and prime minister. On the casket itself was a wreath of white roses and sprigs of trailing fern from Queen Victoria. Its simple inscription read “From Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, In memory of Her faithful and devoted servant.”\n\nAfter the dignitaries had paid their last respects, the public was admitted to the Senate chamber. Some 15,000 people filed through the Senate chambers during the next twenty-four hours. Police constables had trouble keeping order. There were reports that some women fainted in the crush. Members of the Dragoon Guards, the Ottawa Field Battery, the Governor General’s Foot Guards and the 43rd Rifles stood guard.\n\nShortly after noon on the following day, 10 June, police closed the door to the Senate chamber. The last person to view Sir John’s remains was Mr. C. A. Provost of Montreal. After he had paid his respects, the lid on the casket was closed, revealing a simple inscription on its top: “John Alexander Macdonald, Born 11th January 1815; Died 6th June 1891.”\n\nAt roughly 1:15pm, Sir John’s remains were then carried in procession to St. Alban’s Church for the funeral service. The cortege left the eastern gate on Parliament Hill and then towards the church via Elgin Street, Maria Street (Laurier Avenue), Theodore Street (Laurier Avenue), King Street (King Edward Avenue) to Daly Street. Emblems of mourning and back bunting decorated windows and buildings. Thousands watched the sombre procession, led by representatives of the Dominion Police, the Dragoon Guards, and the band of the Governor General’s Foot Guards. The casket was carried in a hearse drawn by six richly caparisoned horses. The official pallbearers were members of the Cabinet. In the first carriage were Mr. Hugh Macdonald, and his small son John Alexander “Jack” Macdonald, named after his illustrious grandfather. Dignitaries, including the governor general, lieutenant-governor generals, senior members of the clergy, judges, parliamentarians, and members of Ottawa’s City Council followed.\n\nAfter the funeral service at St. Alban’s, Sir John’s remains were conveyed to the CPR station which was also draped in mourning colours. At 4.20pm, the state funeral trained left Ottawa bound for Kingston, Sir John’s home town. The train car carrying the casket was lined with mahogany. The chief mourners followed in a private car called the Cumberland. Two parlour cars, the Ottawa and the Matapedia, brought Privy Councillors to Kingston. A special train was also organized to bring hundreds of additional Ottawa mourners to Kingston the following day in time for the committal of Sir John’s mortal remains.\n\nAt Carleton Place, Smith’s Falls, Perth and Sharbot Lake, the funeral train stopped to permit people to pay their respects. After arriving in Kingston at 10:20pm, six representatives from “A” Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery, carried the Sir John’s casket from the station to the city hall where he laid in state for public viewing from midnight until 2:00pm the next day.\n\nAt 2:30pm on 11 June, Kingston’s bells began to toll. At 3:00pm, the funeral procession left city hall, beginning the journey to Cataraqui Cemetery. The military bands struck up the Death March as the casket was carried out of city hall and laid in a hearse drawn by eight black horses wearing palls (heavy black cloths). Eight mounted batterymen provided a military escort. As in Ottawa, thousands lined the route to the cemetery to bid adieu to the great statesman.\n\nAt the cemetery, the Venerable Archdeacon Jones performed the traditional graveside service. Rev. Bogert of St. Alban’s in Ottawa uttered the timeless words: “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.” Sir John A. Macdonald was laid to rest alongside other members of Sir John’s family—his father, mother, first wife, brother, and sister. His final resting place was a hole eight feet deep, in which there was a hollow square of solid masonry. After the casket was lowered, two sandstone slabs were lowered over the top. Iron bolts fastened the limestone cover to the masonry sides to secure the tomb against grave robbers.\n\nA guard comprised of members of “A” Company RCA kept watch over the grave for thirty days.\n\nFrom coast to coast, newspapers wrote glowing tributes about Sir. John A. Macdonald’s contribution to the creation of a modern Canada. One such tribute was written by the Montreal Gazette. It read “Sir John Macdonald’s work is all around us…From Atlantic to Pacific, from the international boundary to the Artic Ocean, the task of his life…the founding and building up of a strong and rich Northland in the new world—is an evident accomplished fact.”\n\nFor more than a century, this was the generally accepted assessment of Sir John’s career. He was the father of modern Canada. And he was so honoured. His statues almost litter the Canadian landscape. Roadways, schools, and government buildings bear his name. He is also immortalized on the $10 bill of the Frontier Series of banknotes that is in current circulation.\n\nHowever, in more recent years the darker side of his legacy has come to the fore, especially the treatment of Indigenous peoples during his time in power. The building of the trans-Canada railway pushed aside the Plains First Nations. Starving from the virtual extirpation of the buffalo, officials of his government refused to gave them food unless they moved to reservations. It was also Macdonald’s government that began the residential school system for Indigenous children that aimed at assimilating Canada’s First Nations. This system only ended in the 1990s. Indigenous languages were supressed, and the resident children suffered harsh discipline; many experienced physical and sexual abuse. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada called the residential school system cultural genocide. The unmarked graves of hundreds of Indigenous children who died in residential schools are still being discovered.\n\nSir John has also been linked to the slave trade through his second wife, Agnes Bernard, who he married in 1867. Lady Macdonald was the daughter of Thomas Bernard, a prominent Jamaican plantation and slaveowner who owned 100 slaves in 1828 at his Belle Vue estate. On Emancipation Day in 1832, he owned sixteen slaves, and would have received compensation for them from the British government. He died in 1850 when Agnes was 16 years old. It seems, however, that at his death his wealth was greatly diminished causing his wife and daughter Agnes to leave Jamaica, first for the United Kingdom, then later to Canada in 1854. They moved in with Agnes’s brother Hewitt Bernard who had given up the planation a few years earlier to make a living in Canada. A lawyer by training, Hewitt Bernard became John A. Macdonald’s private secretary. It was through him that Agnes was introduced to the widowed Macdonald. There is no indication that Agnes Macdonald brought much wealth to the marriage. From all accounts, Sir John A. Macdonald died a relatively poor man.\n\nSo, there lies today’s conundrum. How to continue to give due recognition to Macdonald’s towering contribution to the building of Canada, while acknowledging the pain inflicted by his government upon others, especially Canada’s Indigenous peoples.\n\nSources:\n\nBrantford Expositor, “Sir John Is Still Alive,” 5 June.\n\nDaily Citizen, 1891. “Farewell to Our Chief,” 11 June.\n\n—————-, 1891. “The Last Sad Duty,” 12 June.\n\n—————-, 1891. “In Memory of the Chief,” 15 June.\n\nGazette (Montreal), 1891. “Sir John Macdonald,” 6 June.\n\n———————–, 1891. “Lying in State,” 10 June.\n\nHouse of Commons Debates, 1891. “Illness of Sir John A.
