    "text": "Sir Hugh John Macdonald inherited his father’s physical characteristics. He had a small build, reddish-brown hair, clear blue eyes, and the infamous prominent Macdonald nose. He also grew up to have his father’s charm and easy-attitude.\n\nMacdonald's name was supposed to be that of his older brother—John Alexander Macdonald Jr.—who passed away two years before his birth. Isabella, Hugh John’s mother, begged for the name but lost the argument with Sir John A. Macdonald’s family and settled with Hugh John Macdonald.\n\nHe grew up in Kingston and Toronto. His father—the first Prime Minister—became the Attorney General of Ontario and was often absent during Macdonald’s childhood. Macdonald played at his neighbour’s most days as his mother was bedridden due to her deteriorating health.\n\nWhen his father was home, the two cherished their time together, often playing cards in the evenings.\n\n“He knows the value of cards as well and Hugh looks after his own interests sharply,” wrote Sir John A. Macdonald in a letter.\n\nAt seven-years-old, Hugh John's mother passed away, so Macdonald was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, James Williamson and Margaret Williamson—who he viewed as his parents. As he grew older, Macdonald became interested in military service and served on several occasions. But, because of his father his military life was short lived. In 1872, Macdonald was called to the bar and after that, he begrudgingly practiced law with his father.\n\nHis first marriage\n\nMacdonald married Jean King, a lady his father deemed unsuitable. Jean was not only Roman Catholic, widowed, and older than her husband-to-be but Sir John assumed she’d interfere with his son’s career. Without the Macdonald family’s blessing, the two were married and Macdonald opened his first law office in Kingston.\n\nSir John eventually warmed up to the new couple and, when he discovered that Jean was pregnant, he was delighted to welcome a new generation of Macdonalds. But in April 1881, the slowly constructed family bond broke when Jean died. Shocked and devastated, Hugh John sent their young daughter Daisy to live with her grandfather so Hugh John could rebuild his life.\n\nBy 1883, Macdonald, 33, settled in Winnipeg, but travelled to Toronto to marry his second wife Agnes Vankoughnet (later referred to as Lady Agnes Macdonald). The couple welcomed a son named Jack a year later in Winnipeg. Macdonald started a law practice with James Stewart Tupper and William Johnston (Willis) Tupper—sons of Prime Minister Charles Tupper. Throughout the years of his law practice, the partners changed several times."
