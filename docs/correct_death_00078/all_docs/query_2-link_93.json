Sir John Macdonald, K.C.B., age 68. 1883 297\n\nINTRODUCTORY\n\nSO MANY accounts of Sir John Macdonald have ap-\n\npeared during the past twenty-five years that it\n\nseems almost a work of supererogation to recite once\n\nagain, even in the most general way, the familiar story of his\n\nlife. Yet it may perhaps be convenient to the readers of these\n\npages that they should have under their hand, for purposes\n\nof ready reference, a brief summary, in chronological form,\n\nshowing the salient features of his public career.\n\nJohn Alexander Macdonald, second son of Hugh Mac-\n\ndonald and Helen Shaw, was born in Glasgow on the nth\n\nJanuary, 1815. In 1820 his parents emigrated to Canada\n\nand settled at Kingston, where he studied law, being ad-\n\nmitted to the bar of Upper Canada in February, 1836. In\n\nMarch, 1843, ne was elected to the Kingston town council,\n\nand in October, 1 844, to Parliament where, save for the period\n\nbetween 1878 and 1887, he continued to represent Kingston\n\nuntil his death, forty-seven years later.\n\nOn the 1 1 th May, 1 847, Mr. Macdonald entered the cabinet\n\nof Mr. W. H. Draper as Receiver General, becoming Com-\n\nmissioner of Crown Lands later in the same year. Early\n\nin 1 848 the ministry of which he was a member, having been\n\ndefeated at the polls, resigned office. Mr. Macdonald re-\n\nmained in opposition until 1854 when, on accession to power\n\nof the coalition government formed by a junction of the\n\nfollowers of Robert Baldwin with the Conservative party in\n\nUpper Canada and the moderate section of the French\n\nCanadians, he became Attorney General for Upper Canada,\n\nwhich position, with the exception of eight days in August,\n\n1858, and twenty-two months in 1862-1864, he continued\n\nto hold until Confederation in 1867, and thereafter, under\n\nthe title of Minister of Justice, until November, 1873.\n\nIn 1855 a reconstruction of the cabinet brought in Mr.\n\n(afterwards Sir George) Cartier, who speedily became, in\n\nxix\n\nxx INTRODUCTORY\n\neffect, the leader of the French Canadian ministerialists.\n\nBetween Macdonald and Cartier there grew up a political\n\nand personal friendship which endured until the latter’s\n\ndeath, in 1873.\n\nOn the retirement of Sir Etienne Tache from office in\n\nNovember, 1857, Mr. Macdonald succeeded to the premier-\n\nship, which he resigned on the occasion of the 4 ‘Double Shuffle”\n\nin August, 1858, to resume office a few days later as Attorney\n\nGeneral for Upper Canada in the cabinet of Mr. Cartier, which\n\nhe held until May, 1862, when the Cartier-Macdonald Gov-\n\nernment went out of power on their militia policy. Their\n\nsuccessors’ tenure of office under John Sandfield Macdonald\n\nwas brief. In less than two years, the Liberal-Conservative\n\nparty was again in the saddle, under the premiership of Sir\n\nEtienne Tache, Mr. John A. Macdonald being the Upper\n\nCanadian leader, with Mr. Cartier occupying a similar posi-\n\ntion as regards the French section of the Province. Within\n\nthree months of its formation, this administration in turn\n\nsuffered defeat in Parliament.\n\nThus, within three years, three ministries had been de-\n\nfeated and two general elections had failed to give either\n\nside a governing majority. From this impasse resulted\n\nConfederation. By agreeing to sink all personal and political\n\ndifferences for their country’s good, John A. Macdonald and\n\nGeorge Brown formed a coalition government under the\n\nnominal leadership (i) of Sir Etienne Tache and (2) of Sir\n\nNarcisse Belleau, which effected the union of the Provinces\n\nof Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick under the name\n\nof the Dominion of Canada.\n\nOn the ist of July, 1867, Mr. Macdonald, who had been\n\nentrusted by the Governor-General with the formation of the\n\nfirst Dominion cabinet, was sworn into office by Lord Monck,\n\nas Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In the general\n\nelections immediately ensuing, his government was triumph-\n\nantly sustained in all the provinces except Nova Scotia,\n\nwhich returned eighteen members out of nineteen, pledged t >\n\ndo their utmost to detach Nova Scotia from the newly\n\nformed confederation. The account of how this attempt\n\nfailed, owing to the winning over of Joseph Howe, the leader\n\nof the Liberal party in Nova Scotia, is set forth in Sir John\n\nMacdonald’s correspondence of the period.\n\nINTRODUCTORY xxi\n\nThe general elections of 1872 a hard-fought battle\n\nresulted favourably to the administration of Sir John Mac-\n\ndonald, which, despite considerable losses in Ontario, ob-\n\ntained a working majority throughout the Dominion a\n\nnoticeable change taking place in Nova Scotia, where a\n\nrepresentation of eighteen Liberals and one Conservative,\n\ngave place to twenty Conservatives and one Independent.\n\nIn 1873 came wnat us ed to be called the “Pacific Scandal,”\n\nresulting in the downfall of Sir John Macdonald’s Govern-\n\nment and the accession to power of Mr. Alexander Macken-\n\nzie, whose ministry lasted from 1873 to l8 7 8 > wnen Macdon-\n\nald was restored to his old position at the head of affairs\n\nby the overwhelming majority of eighty-six in a House of\n\nCommons consisting of two hundred and eleven members.\n\nMr. Mackenzie’s majority in the old Parliament ranged from\n\neighty odd at its beginning, to between fifty and sixty at\n\nits close. This remarkable change in public opinion was\n\ndue to several causes, chief among which may be set down,\n\nthe cry of hard times, a demand for protection to native indus-\n\ntries, and the personal popularity of Sir John Macdonald.\n\nOn the formation of his second Dominion administration,\n\nSir John Macdonald took the portfolio of the Interior, which\n\nhe held from 1878 until 1883, when he became President of\n\nthe Privy Council, remaining such until 1889. In November\n\nof that year he exchanged the Presidency of the Council for\n\nthe onerous Department of Railways and Canals, which he\n\ncontinued to administer until his death on the 6th of June,\n\n1891. His second term of office as First Minister thus lasted\n\nnearly thirteen years, in the course of which many questions\n\nof importance arose, some calling for the exercise of the\n\nhighest statesmanship. Among these may be enumerated:\n\n1. The inauguration of the National Policy.\n\n2. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway,\n\nincluding the extension to that Company of financial assist-\n\nance in their day of need, and of unflinching support by the\n\nexercise of the power of disallowance against the attempts\n\nof those, principally in the Province of Manitoba, who sought\n\nto expose the newly launched enterprise to the danger of\n\nforeign competition.\n\nI 3. The colonization and development of the great\n\nNorthwest.\n\nxxii INTRODUCTORY\n\n4. The second Riel uprising, its suppression and its con-\n\nsequences.\n\n5. The passage of a Dominion Franchise Act.\n\nThroughout his long career, Sir John Macdonald enjoyed\n\nin a remarkable degree, not merely the confidence and\n\nesteem, but, in the vast majority of instances, the personal\n\naffection of his followers. To their steadfast loyalty is to be\n\nascribed, in no small measure, the success which attended his\n\nefforts in the building up of this great Dominion stretch-\n\ning from sea to sea. He lived to see the fruition of al-\n\nmost all his great designs, and when the inevitable hour\n\nof departure drew near, it found him happy in the reflection\n\nthat he had carried to successful completion a great and\n\nabiding work; ready, as he expressed it, to sing his Nunc\n\ndimittis.\n\nElsewhere I have dwelt upon Sir John Macdonald’s\n\ndeep-seated affection for the United Kingdom, and his desire\n\nthat the tie which binds us to the mother country might\n\nremain unimpaired. Holding these views, the policy of\n\nunrestricted reciprocity with the United States, which\n\ndeveloped during his later years, and which he believed to be\n\nincompatible with the maintenance of Canada’s connection\n\nwith Great Britain, was to him in the highest degree\n\nrepellant. The imperative necessity for defeating a policy\n\nfraught with such disastrous possibilities to the State,\n\nstimulated his weary frame for his last fight in support of\n\nBritish connection. This was the issue in the general elec-\n\ntions of 1 891 in which Macdonald won, though at great cost,\n\nfor there can be little doubt that the exertions he underwent\n\nin that arduous campaign, held during the most inclement\n\nseason of the year, materially hastened his end.\n\nSir John was twice married in 1 843 to his cousin Isabella\n\nClark (she died in 1857) by whom he had two sons: John\n\nAlexander who died in childhood, and Hugh John, born in\n\n1850, now the Hon. Sir Hugh John Macdonald, Kt. Hugh\n\nalso married twice, first in 1876 to Jean King, by whom he\n\nhad one daughter, Daisy, now the wife of George Gainsford,\n\nEsquire, of Winnipeg, and second, to Agnes Gertrude Van-\n\nkoughnet by whom he had one son, who died unmarried in his\n\n2 ist year.\n\nSir John married, en seconde noces y Agnes Bernard, daugh-\n\nINTRODUCTORY xxiii\n\nter of the late Hon. T. J. Bernard, a member of the Privy\n\nCouncil of Jamaica, who survived her husband upwards of\n\ntwenty-nine years, passing away recently at a ripe old age.\n\nTo their union was born one daughter, the Hon. Mary Mac-\n\ndonald, who is unmarried. In recognition of the services of\n\nher distinguished husband, Lady Macdonald, shortly after\n\nSir John’s death, was created, by her late Majesty Queen\n\nVictoria, a peeress in her own right, under the style and title\n\nof the Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe.\n\n“Harry my boy,” once observed Sir John Macdonald to his\n\nfriend Colonel H. R. Smith, the late Sergeant-at-Arms of\n\nthe House of Commons, ”never write a letter if you can help\n\nit, and never destroy one.” The latter injunction he himself\n\nscrupulously fulfilled, for during many years he carefully\n\npreserved every written communication, letter or memor-\n\nandum that he received. Very seldom indeed was this rule\n\ndeparted from. As a consequence I found myself at his\n\ndeath confronted with an appalling mass of papers, the\n\nletters alone numbering many thousands. Many of these\n\nwere, or had been, arranged in some sort of fashion, but all\n\nhad to be gone over, read, and re-classified, a labour that will\n\nnever be understood or appreciated by any one who has not\n\nundergone a similar experience. In the preparation of my\n\n“Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald” I used about 250 of the\n\nmore important of these letters, and in my “Day of Sir John\n\nMacdonald,” perhaps 25 more. The reflection that a collec-\n\ntion of papers, so intimately related to the history of Canada\n\nin the making, demanded a wider publicity, has led to the\n\npublication of this volume, which contains, in round numbers,\n\nfive hundred letters written by or to Sir John Macdonald,\n\nnot one per cent, of the total number preserved by him.\n\nWhile the relative importance of the published letters, bears\n\na much higher ratio to the mass than is indicated by their\n\nnumerical proportion, it is needless to say that much of\n\ninterest remains. Sir John Macdonald’s correspondence\n\nwith each of the first six Governors-General of the Dominion:\n\nLords Monck, Lisgar, Dufferin, Lome, Lansdowne, and\n\nStanley of Preston; with Sir George Cartier, Sir John Rose,\n\nxxiv INTRODUCTORY\n\nSir Charles Tupper, Sir George Stephen, Sir Donald Smith,\n\nSir John Thompson and many other public men, would, in\n\nmost cases, fill a volume in some cases several volumes\n\nnot to speak of papers bearing on such large public questions\n\nas Confederation; the acquisition of the Northwest; the\n\nhistory of the Intercolonial and Canadian Pacific Railways;\n\nthe Riel uprisings; the Washington Treaty of 1871; the\n\nvarious fisheries negotiations with the United States; in\n\nrespect of all of which subjects the papers are very volumin-\n\nous. The bulk of these must await another hand and a\n\nlater day. Within the limitations assigned to the present\n\nwork, every care has been taken to make this collection a\n\nrepresentative one, and by a process of judicious selection,\n\nto throw as much light as possible upon the more important\n\nissues of the periods in which they were written. Sir John\n\nMacdonald’s correspondence with the various Governors-\n\nGeneral of his time, are particularly rich in historic interest,\n\nas also are many letters which passed between him and his\n\nleading colleagues, and others whose names will readily\n\nsuggest themselves. Due prominence has been given to the\n\nstory of what is perhaps the greatest monument to his\n\ncourage and resolution the Canadian Pacific Railway as\n\ndisclosed in his correspondence with Sir George Stephen,\n\nJohn Henry Pope, and W. C. Van Home.\n\nWhile occasionally, and for special reasons, I have in-\n\ncluded in this collection a letter which has appeared in\n\nmy “Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald” or elsewhere, the rule\n\nwhich I originally proposed to myself, not to republish in\n\nthis volume any correspondence which had already seen the\n\nlight, has been very generally adhered to.\n\nIn the preparation of this work, there has been very\n\nlittle ”editing”. While occasionally, by reason of irrelevancy,\n\nlack of interest, or their essentially private and personal\n\ncharacter, portions of letters have been omitted in certain\n\ndesignated places, it is rare indeed that a passage has been\n\nwithheld on other grounds. In truth, there is very little in\n\nanything Sir John Macdonald left behind him which might\n\nnot eventually be proclaimed upon the housetops. In sur-\n\nveying the record of his long and active career, nothing is\n\nmore striking than the serene consciousness of his own\n\nintegrity, that led him to preserve for the judgment of poster-\n\nINTRODUCTORY xxv\n\nity, his correspondence, not merely with the outside world,\n\nbut also with political colleagues and intimate personal\n\nfriends.\n\nJOSEPH POPE.\n\nOttawa, August, 1921.\n\nLEADING EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD\n\nBorn in Glasgow\n\nParents emigrated to Canada\n\nEntered upon the study of the law\n\nCalled to the Bar of Upper Canada\n\nAppointed a Commissioner to enquire into the\n\nlosses arising out of the Rebellion of 1837-8\n\nElected to Kingston Town Council\n\nElected to the Provincial Legislature\n\nAppointed Queen’s Counsel\n\nMember of the Executive Council\n\nReceiver General\n\nCommissioner of Crown Lands\n\nResigned with his colleagues\n\nAttorney General of Upper Canada\n\nPrime Minister of the Province of Canada\n\nResigned with his colleagues\n\nPostmaster General\n\nResigned\n\nAttorney General of Upper Canada\n\nResigned with his colleagues\n\nAttorney General of Upper Canada\n\nKnight Commander of the Bath\n\nA member of the Queen’s Privy Council for\n\nCanada\n\nPrime Minister of the Dominion of Canada\n\nMinister of Justice\n\nResigned\n\nPrime Minister\n\nMinister of the Interior\n\nSworn of Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Most\n\nHonourable Privy Council\n\nPresident of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada\n\nReceived the Grand Cross of the Bath\n\nMinister of Railways and Canals\n\nDied\n\nxxvi\n\nnth January, 1815\n\n1820\n\n1830\n\n6th February, 1836\n\n28th November, 1840\n\n28th March,\n\n1 4th October,\n\nnth December,\n\nnth May,\n\n21 st May,\n\n8th December,\n\nloth March,\n\n1843\n\n1844\n\n1846\n\n1847\n\n1847\n\n1847\n\n1848\n\nnth September, 1854\n\n26th November, 1857\n\n29th July,\n\n1858\n\n6th August,\n\n1858\n\n7th August,\n\n1858\n\n7th August,\n\n1858\n\n23rd May,\n\n1862\n\n3oth March,\n\n1864\n\n29th June,\n\n1867\n\nist July,\n\n1867\n\nist July,\n\n1867\n\nist July,\n\n1867\n\n5th November,\n\ni8?3\n\n1 7th October,\n\n1878\n\n1 7th October,\n\n1878\n\nI4th August,\n\n1879\n\n1 7th October,\n\n1883\n\n25th November,\n\n1884\n\n28th November,\n\n1889\n\n6th June,\n\n1891\n\nPART I\n\n1840 1867\n\nCORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD\n\nPART I\n\n1840-1867\n\nTHE earliest letter written by Sir John Macdonald that I\n\nhave been able to discover is dated the 28th November,\n\n1840, accepting appointment as a commissioner to investi-\n\ngate certain claims arising out of the Rebellion of 1837-8.\n\nFrom Mr. John A.

In the first\n\nsession of the Legislature of the United Provinces of Upper\n\nand Lower Canada, an amending Act was passed (4 & 5 Vic.,\n\nCap. 39) enlarging the scope of the Commission. Even after\n\nthis, nothing appears to have been done, and it was not until\n\n1845 that legislation (8 Vic., Cap. 72) designed to meet the\n\ncase was enacted. By this time Mr. Macdonald had ceased\n\nto be connected with the Commission, presumably because in\n\nthe interval he had been elected to the Legislature.\n\nSir John Macdonald’s public career may be said to have\n\nbegun on the i4th October, 1844, on which day he was\n\nelected a member of the House of Assembly of the Province\n\nof Canada for Kingston to support the Draper-Viger Ad-\n\nministration in their conflict with Messrs. Baldwin and\n\nLafontaine. His opponent, Mr. Anthony Manahan, had\n\nbeen a member of the old Legislature of Upper Canada. 1\n\nWhen the next General Elections came round, Mr. Mac-\n\ndonald appealed to his constituents as a cabinet minister.\n\nAmong the issues of that contest was the question of univer-\n\nsity endowment, to which he attached a good deal of im-\n\nportance, 2 as did his electors, to judge from the following\n\nletter, evidently written in response to enquiries as to his\n\nattitude with respect thereto.\n\nFrom the Hon. John A. Macdonald to a committee of his\n\nconstituents.\n\nKingston, loth December, 184.7.\n\nGENTLEMEN,\n\nIf I were an independent candidate, and not connected\n\nwith the Government, I should feel no difficulty in answering\n\n1 Touching upon this gentleman, an old acquaintance of my late chief wrote to\n\nme on the appearance of my Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald hereinafter alluded\n\nto in this volume as Memoirs:\n\n“You speak of Mr. Anthony Manahan being represented as an ‘uncouth and\n\nilliterate person.’ Such is not the case. He was a gentleman, highly educated,\n\nand a leading Roman Catholic in Kingston. In politics he was a Tory, but opposed\n\nto the ‘Family Compact.’ I remember him very well, and when a boy was fre-\n\nquently at his house.”\n\n2 Memoirs, Volume I, p. 54.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD 3\n\nthe questions contained in your favour of yesterday. But,\n\nsituated as I am, it must be obvious to you that I can have\n\nno right or authority to pledge the administration of which\n\nI am a member, to any cause or on any subject, without their\n\nconsent.\n\nIn my answers therefore to your enquiries, you must con-\n\nsider me as expressing only my individual opinions, and not\n\nin any way as binding on the Government, or the present\n\nAdministration. At the same time I may be permitted to\n\nsay that the previous course of the Government has been\n\nsuch as to prove to the Roman Catholics of Canada its\n\nanxious desire to secure, to that large and influential body,\n\nequal rights and privileges with any other denomination.\n\nWith these remarks I proceed to answer your enquiries.\n\nFirst. As to my views on the University question, I have\n\nonly to say that they remain the same as when I introduced\n\nthe University Bill last session. That measure proposed\n\nto vest the endowment in a Board of Trustees selected from\n\neach of the Universities of Upper Canada. That there\n\nshould be paid annually out of the endowment, to\n\nKing’s College 3000\n\nQueen’s College 1500\n\nRegiopolis College 1500\n\nVictoria College 1500\n\nand that out of the surplus that would accrue, any other\n\ncolleges hereafter established should be endowed.\n\nSecond. It is my intention to claim for the college of\n\nRegiopolis the proportion above specified of the endowment\n\nthat is to say, the same amount as to any other college in\n\nUpper Canada, except King’s College, which it is thought has\n\na fair claim to a preference, inasmuch as it is to surrender\n\nthe whole of the endowment, and to receive only a small\n\nportion of its present income. It has been also ascertained\n\nthat the measure could not be carried through the Legisla-\n\nture, were the income of King’s College reduced below 3000;\n\nand it was thought better to yield this point, than to risk the\n\nloss of the measure.\n\nThird. It is the fixed intention of the present Administra-\n\ntion, and of myself as a member of it, to bring before the\n\nLegislature at its next session, bills similar to those intro-\n\n4 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nduced by myself at the last session, and to exercise all our\n\ninfluence to get them passed into laws. And I have no\n\nhesitation in declaring that I will oppose any measure not\n\ncontaining the same principle of an equitable division among\n\nthe different colleges in Upper Canada.\n\nYour question respecting the Common School Bill is too\n\nvague in its terms to admit of a precise answer. You do\n\nnot point out in what manner the present law prevents\n\nRoman Catholics from having separate schools in corporate\n\ntowns and villages, nor do you suggest any mode by which\n\nthe School Bill can be altered so as to remove the disabilities\n\nyou complain of. It was the evident intention of the Legisla-\n\nture, in passing the School Act, to enable both Catholics and\n\nProtestants to have separate schools, if they desired it, and\n\nto give such separate schools a share of the public appropria-\n\ntion, accdr)ding to the number of children of each persuasion.\n\nShould the present School Bill, from some defect, Hot carry\n\nout this fair and equitable intention of the Legislature, I\n\nshall be ready to support any act amending it in this respect.\n\nI am strongly in favour of affording children of the earliest\n\nage the means of religious as well as secular education; and\n\nsuch was the design of the Legislature in establishing separate\n\nschools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYour obedt. and humble servant,\n\nJOHN A. MACDONALD.\n\nSir John Macdonald’s well known solicitude for the high\n\ncharacter of the Bench manifested itself in the early stages of\n\nhis career. Almost his first act as attorney general was to\n\noffer the chief justiceship of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nUpper Canada to his old-time opponent, Robert Baldwin. 1\n\nUpon Mr. Baldwin’s declinature of the office, Mr. Macdonald\n\naddressed himself to his former leader, Mr. Draper. 2\n\n1 Memoirs, Vol. I, pp. 85-6.\n\n2 The Hon.

MACDONALD.\n\nJ. H. Hagarty, Esq., Q.C.\n\nIn 1858 Canada adopted a policy of incidental protection\n\nwhich was further developed in 1859, thereby more or less\n\nprejudicially affecting certain manufacturers in the United\n\nKingdom. These persons appealed to the Duke of New-\n\ncastle, at that time Secretary of State for the Colonies, who,\n\nin transmitting their memorial to the Governor-General, took\n\noccasion to lecture the Canadian Government on the evils of\n\nprotection a course which the ministry very naturally re-\n\nsented. Their reply was in the form of a Minute of the\n\nExecutive Council, based upon a memorandum of the Hon.\n\nA. T. Gait, 1 then Minister of Finance. The ministry took the\n\nground that the responsibility for the administration of the\n\naffairs of Canada was upon them, and that they could not\n\nallow any feeling of deference which they owed to the Imper-\n\nial Authorities, in any manner to impair the right of the\n\npeople of Canada to decide for themselves as to the mode\n\nand the extent to which taxation should be imposed. 2\n\nIt is perhaps worth while pointing out that the Duke’s\n\ndespatch does not profess to embody anything more than his\n\nown ill-considered judgment. When a Secretary of State\n\nfor the Colonies conveys the views of the Imperial Cabinet\n\nto a Colonial Governor, it is customary to make the fact\n\nquite clear. In the present instance the Duke does not\n\nallude to Her Majesty’s Government at all, save to indicate\n\nthat they did not propose to interfere with the legislation\n\nunder review. It would not be the first occasion on which an\n\nImperial Secretary of State has sent off despatches without\n\nthe knowledge or approval of his colleagues.\n\n1 Afterwards The Hon. Sir Alexander Gait, G.C.M.G. A colleague of Sir John\n\nMacdonald. One of the Fathers of Confederation. Finance Minister in the first\n\nDominion Cabinet. First High Commissioner for Canada in London (1880-1883).\n\nDied, 1 9th September, 1893.\n\n* For this State Paper see Canada Sessional Papers, 1860, No. 38, pp. 4-12.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD 7\n\nSir John Macdonald thus alluded to the affair in a speech\n\ndelivered by him at the time:\n\nA representation was made by the Sheffield cutlers against our scale of\n\nduties, and they protested, in language which we very properly resented,\n\nagainst our right to encourage manufactures in Canada. I have in my\n\nhand a memorial, sent by the Chamber of Commerce, of Sheffield, in 1859,\n\nto the Duke of Newcastle, from which I shall read one or two pages, giving\n\ntheir so-called reasons for such a protest:\n\nHere is a direct statement that we have not the right to raise our rev-\n\nenue, except as they in Sheffield conceive it for their interests! While\n\nwe admire the policy of Great Britain, and are quite willing to act with it\n\nas far as the interests of the country will allow, yet as Ministers of Canada,\n\ndependent on her people, we should have been altogether wanting in our\n\nduty if we had not protested. We said we had the full right to raise our\n\nrevenue in our own fashion, according to our own ideas. Yet what do we\n\nfind? That this Chamber of Sheffield makes a long quotation from the\n\nGlobe, just as the Washington Constitution did, to show that on Colonial\n\nprinciples, as well as Imperial, we ought to alter our policy. These are\n\ncomplaints that I think we have a right to make.\n\nWhile the Duke of Newcastle does not appear to have been\n\nvery tactful in his relations with Canada, it is but fair to his\n\nmemory to say that on this occasion he admitted his mistake.\n\nFrom the Hon. A. T. Gait to the Hon. John A. Macdonald.\n\nLondon, iflh December, 1859.\n\nMY DEAR MACDONALD,\n\nI have written Carder an account of my interview with the Duke of\n\nNewcastle. After discussing the other matters with which I was charged,\n\nI told him I feared there existed some misapprehension as to our com-\n\nmercial policy which I should be glad to remove. He at once ” owned up ”\n\nand said he had been in the wrong, with a good deal more to the same effect.\n\nI trust he may send out a despatch to the same effect.\n\nSidney* has gone to the Continent to make postal arrangements. I trust\n\nhe will confine himself to the males, but this I doubt. I would not consent\n\nto being left here all alone, so you need not expect him before you see me,\n\nunless you either come yourself or send Vankoughnet, 2 who must be very\n\nlonesome in Quebec.\n\niThe Hon. Sidney Smith, Postmaster General in the Macdonald-Cartier and\n\nCartier-Macdonald administrations (1858-1862). Died, 2yth September, 1889.\n\n2 The Hon. Philip Vankoughnet, a colleague of Sir John Macdonald, 1856-1862.\n\nChancellor of Ontario from i9th March, 1862, until his death, yth November, 1869.\n\n8 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nEverything looks favourable here and I think I shall make the Consols\n\ngo, as both Baring and Glyn appear very hearty about it now. I only\n\npostpone it till I see Gladstone, who unfortunately is out of town.\n\nRemember me most kindly to Vankoughnet and Sherwood.\n\nEver faithfully,\n\nHon. J. A. Macdonald. A. T. GALT.\n\nP. S.\n\nBy the way, you have blighted Smith’s hopes and mine by not having\n\nsent an answer to the despatch about our uniform. Smith was to have\n\nworn his on the Continent, but we cannot get it as the Colonial Office have\n\nno reply.\n\nNot long afterwards, a further occasion of difference with\n\nHis Grace of Newcastle arose. In the summer of 1860 the\n\nPrince of Wales (afterwards King Edward VII), then a lad\n\nof 1 8, visited Canada under the guidance of the Duke of\n\nNewcastle, who gave much offence by his refusal to allow\n\nthe Orange societies of Upper Canada to participate in the\n\nwelcome to the Prince. This action on the Duke’s part was\n\na source of great annoyance to Mr. Macdonald, not only as\n\nthe leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party in Upper Can-\n\nada but also as member for Kingston, where the Orangemen\n\nwere particularly enthusiastic in their demonstrations of\n\nloyalty to the Heir Apparent; and prepared to receive him\n\nwith great eclat. This time the Duke stuck to his guns,\n\nand in consequence of the refusal of the Orangemen to lay\n\naside their regalia and dispense with party emblems during the\n\nPrince’s visit, the steamer bearing the Royal party on their\n\nway west, passed by the town. Nor could the combined\n\ninfluence of the Governor-General and Mr. Cartier induce\n\nHis Grace to repair what was designated at the time by the\n\nsympathizers with the Orange societies as a “wanton insult.”\n\nFrom the Hon. G. E. Cartier 1 to the Hon. John A. Macdonald\n\nPrivate.\n\nToronto^ nth September, 1860.\n\nMY DEAR MACDONALD,\n\nI have just telegraphed you the result of my interview with the Duke\n\nand Sir Edmund.

One of the Fathers of Confederation; Prime Minister of the Province\n\nof Canada (1858-1862); Minister of Militia and Defence in the first Dominion\n\nCabinet. Died, aoth May, 1873.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD 9\n\nKingston again. The Duke finds, however, that the programme of\n\narrangements connected with the Prince’s visit in other localities in U. C.\n\ncannot be interfered with without causing disappointments to localities\n\nwhich have made preparations in the expectation of the Prince’s visit.\n\nThe Duke has expressed that physical impossibility would be the only\n\nthing in the way of revisiting Kingston. He authorized me to convey\n\nhis mind and feelings to you. Poor Sir Edmund feels deeply for you and\n\nyour people. In conversing with me I saw tears coming from his eyes.\n\nIf you will allow me to repeat the suggestion which I make in my telegram\n\nrespecting the sending of a deputation from Kingston, requesting that\n\nthe Prince should visit it, I will add to you that I think it would be con-\n\nducive to a great deal of good if such deputation could be sent. Supposing\n\nthat the deputation should not succeed in securing a revisit to Kingston\n\nby the Prince, the courteous answer, which, I am sure, would be given,\n\nwould tend to smooth the troubled waters. The Prince leaves to-morrow\n\nmorning for London at II o’clock. I enclose you a programme of the\n\narrangements as now settled, and you will see at what place any deputation\n\nfrom Kingston would be able to meet the Prince and suite. I have seen\n\nyour Mayor, Mr. Strange, to whom I have communicated the substance of\n\nmy telegram to you. He is to remain here in case a deputation comes\n\nfrom your city.\n\nI write you in haste,\n\nYour devoted colleague\n\nGEO. E. CARTIER.\n\nThe Honourable John A. Macdonald,\n\nAttorney General,\n\nKingston.\n\nWhen it is considered that a protectionist policy was\n\nadopted by the Parliament of Canada in 1858, and extended\n\nin 1859 at the instance of the Government in which Mr. A. T.\n\nGait was Finance Minister, his advocacy in England three\n\nyears later, of free trade, as indicated in this letter from him,\n\naffords a striking illustration of his erratic character.\n\nFrom the Hon. A. T. Gait to” the Hon. John A. Macdonald.\n\nLondon, 3rd October, 1862.\n\nMY DEAR MACDONALD,\n\nI duly received yours from Quebec, and would have written but Sup-\n\nposed you would not have returned from Cacouna.\n\nIn regard to what you say about my talking free trade here, I have no\n\ndoubt it may do me some damage in Canada, but I think if you were here\n\nyourself and saw the growing feeling respecting separation, you would feel\n\nit as I do, a matter of duty, to urge all you could on behalf of Canada.\n\nYou have no doubt seen the proceedings at Manchester and, I hope, will\n\napprove of my speech, which is fairly enough reported in the Times. I did\n\nio CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nnot know a living soul in Manchester and was fairly in the lion’s den. It\n\nreally required some nerve to speak, especially as I knew I was to be fol-\n\nlowed and attacked by Ashworth and others. However, the effect was\n\nvery good, and by far the larger part of the meeting were on my side. I\n\nhave no doubt my presence there will go far to stop the constant irritating\n\nreference to Canada in the Manchester meetings. The press both there\n\nand in London has generally dealt fairly with me, but the Times is resolved\n\nto break me down if it can, and has published two leaders since slashing\n\nme in its usual style. I had yesterday sent a reply to its article of the ist\n\ninstant (which really is too bad), in which, without showing temper, I\n\nhave calmly disproved its attacks. Having given me a direct challenge,\n\nit cannot fail to publish my letter, but will no doubt concoct some new\n\ndose for my benefit. It is not very pleasant but in some respect flattering.\n\nI shall return by the steamer of the 25th and hope to see you soon after.\n\nRemember me to all friends, and\n\nBelieve me,\n\nEver yours,\n\nA.

S.\n\nMacdonald-Sicotte Government (1862-63;) and of the J. S. Macdonald-Dorion Gov-\n\nernment (1863-64). In June, 1864, he joined the coalition cabinet formed by Mac-\n\ndonald and Brown, and in November of the same year was elevated to the Bench\n\nas Vice-Chancellor of Upper Canada, from which he resigned in 1872 to become the\n\nPremier of Ontario; this post he continued to fill until 1896, when he entered the\n\nDominion arena, becoming Minister of Justice in Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet;\n\nthere he continued until 1897, when he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of\n\nOntario, in which office he died, igth April, 1903.\n\n3 The Hon.

First Lieutenant-Governor of the North West Territories.\n\nSat for various constituencies in the Legislative Assembly and afterwards in the\n\nParliament of Canada. Died, 29th May, 1905.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD u\n\nOpposition, on the basis of effecting a settlement of the\n\nsectional difficulties between Upper and Lower Canada, the\n\nsolution of which, the leaders of both parties agreed, was to\n\nbe found in a confederation of all the British North American\n\nProvinces. This policy had long been advocated by Mr. Mac-\n\ndonald, as presenting the only feasible scheme for curing\n\nthe evils under which Canada laboured. Five years before\n\nthe date we are here considering, he was a leading member of\n\na ministry which despatched a mission to England to ascer-\n\ntain the views of Her Majesty’s Government on the subject\n\nof a union of the British North American Provinces. Two\n\nyears later (i9th April, 1861) from his place in the Legislature\n\nhe thus expressed himself:\n\nThe only feasible scheme which presents itself to my mind as a remedy\n\nfor the evils complained of, is a confederation of all the provinces. 1 In\n\nspeaking of a confederation, I must not be understood as alluding to it in\n\nthe sense of the one on the other side of the line, for that has not been\n\nsuccessful. . . . The fatal error which they have committed and it\n\nwas, perhaps, unavoidable from the state of the colonies at the time of the\n\nrevolution was in making each State a distinct sovereignty, in giving to\n\neach a distinct sovereign power except in those instances where they were\n\nspecially reserved by the constitution and conferred upon the general\n\nGovernment. The true principle of a confederation lies in giving to the\n\ngeneral Governmgnt-alLtJig^principjes jind ^powers of sovereignty, and in\n\nthe provision that the subordinate or individual States should have no\n\npowers but those expressly bestowed upon them.\n\n1 In the light of this explicit statement, it is amusing to find Mr. O. D. Skelton\n\nin his Life and Times of Sir Alexander Gait, p. 401, representing Sir John Macdonald\n\nas an eleventh-hour convert to the policy of Confederation, which ‘he opposed to the\n\nlast.’ In giving utterance to this statement Mr. Skelton appears to have drawn his\n\ninspiration from Sir Richard Cartwright, an unsafe guide where Sir John is con-\n\ncerned. Sir John’s opposition, as set forth above and elsewhere (see especially\n\nPope’s Confederation Documents, pp. 54-55,), was not to confederation, but to the\n\nfederal system. As is well known, his preference was for a legislative union.\n\nWhen he realized that this, in view of Lower Canada, was impracticable, he\n\nlaboured for the creation of a strong central government, giving to the provinces\n\nonly such powers as were specifically delegated, the residuum remaining with the\n\ncentral authority. In this his policy prevailed, for despite the loose use of the word\n\n‘federal’ Tn the negotiations which resulted in Confederation, our Confederation\n\ncompact is not really a federal union, but is based on the opposite principle from\n\nthat underlying the Constitution of the United States, where the powers not\n\nexpressly delegated to the central government, nor prohibited by the Constitution\n\nto the States, are reserved to the States respectively.\n\nLord Chancellor Haldane in an Australian appeal before the Privy Council (Law\n\nReports, Appeal cases 1914, Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia\n\nv.

It is a great and patriotic achievement putting an\n\nend to the bitter party animosities and intense personal antipathies that\n\nhave characterized public life in Canada for so many years; effecting this\n\ntoo, by the only honourable and enduring means, the removal of the cause,\n\nthe settlement of the disturbing sectional questions. Yourself, Gait, and\n\nBrown and (as Brown justly says in his speech) especially Tache and\n\nCartier, deserve the thanks and gratitude of the country for making in the\n\ninterest of the country what must have been to all of you a great sacrifice\n\nof personal feeling.\n\nI am quite sure that in what you have done you will have the approval\n\nof every man whose interests are not antagonistic to those of the country.\n\nIt must also be no small satisfaction to you, and especially to Gait, that\n\nthe movers of the unhandsome and unfair attack upon him have been so\n\nutterly discomfited. I notice you said in the House that the Intercolonial\n\nhad not been named in the discussions with Brown. Naming it would\n\nhave been very superfluous. Without it there can be no federation. It is\n\nthe keystone, the very foundation stone. The early carrying out of this\n\nenterprise seems at last probable. It must now be placed on a broad and\n\nsafe basis. I beg of you to take care that the control is kept in the proper\n\nhands and that no opening or opportunity is left for 2 scheming.\n\nI wrote you about a fortnight ago but you have had something else to do\n\nthan answer private letters.\n\nI remain my dear Macdonald\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nD.

The delegates from the Maritime Provinces\n\nwere, on this occasion, the guests of the Canadian Govern-\n\nment, which despatched a special steamer to convey them to\n\nQuebec, and otherwise made provision for their comfort.\n\nThe Macdonald correspondence during the years 1864-66\n\nlargely relates to the development of this great scheme.\n\nFrom the Hon.

Canada, on the whole, seems to take up\n\nthe scheme warmly, but yet we shall meet with considerable\n\nopposition. Dorion, 1 you see, has come out with a manifesto\n\nagainst it. Sandfield Macdonald 2 will join him, and I hear\n\nthey are beating up for recruits everywhere. It is of the\n\nutmost importance that between now and the time of the\n\nmeeting of Parliament nothing should be done to strengthen\n\nthe hands of the Opposition, or to give them the opportunity\n\nof getting up a new cry. With this view, I cannot too\n\nstrongly impress on you the necessity of carrying out the\n\npolicy of not in any way giving any party the slightest con-\n\ntrol over the construction of any portion of the Intercolonial\n\nRailway. Brown’s confession of faith in favour of the road\n\nat Toronto has astounded his supporters, and dismayed a\n\ngood many of them who have hitherto been educated by\n\nhim to oppose it by every means and at every stage. They\n\nare powerless in consequence of his desertion, but there is a\n\nmuttered growl about it that I don’t like. Were it suspected\n\nthat any considerable portion of the road for which Canada\n\nis going to pledge itself was given away to contractors with-\n\nout the consent or sanction of the Government, a storm\n\nwould at once arise which could not be allayed, and would\n\nperil the whole scheme.\n\nI intend to commence next week to draft the Bill to be\n\nsubmitted for the consideration of the Imperial Government,\n\nand shall be glad to get from you such hints or suggestions\n\nas may occur to you.\n\nHave you formed any plan as to the mode in which you\n\nwill submit the subject to your Parliament?\n\nIn looking over our resolutions, I see a mistake has crept\n\nin.

As\n\nto the two questions you ask me, I do not think there will\n\nbe anything to prevent the same person sitting in the General\n\nand in the Local Legislature, except the inconvenience to the\n\nmember himself. I presume that the number of General\n\nand Local representatives, in each section, will be the same.\n\nThe Government will, of course, assume the responsibility of\n\nmapping out Upper Canada into electoral divisions, and I\n\nshould think it quite clear that Grey will have another\n\nmember. I quite agree with you that the present Parlia-\n\nment is fully competent to deal with the questions without\n\nprevious appeal to the public. It is very evident, as you say,\n\nthat, at a general election, issues would arise in almost every\n\n16 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nconstituency other than the main one of Confederation or no\n\nConfederation.\n\nThe House will probably meet early in January.\n\nI am,\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJOHN A.

Confidential.\n\nSt. Louis Hotel,\n\nSaturday evening.’ 1\n\nMY DEAR MACDONALD,\n\nI have been thinking over the defence matter in connection with my\n\nbeing in England, and it does appear as if it would be strange that the fact\n\nof my being in England was referred to in the Hudson’s Bay Minute and\n\nnot in that on the defences, as to which verbal communication would be of\n\ninfinitely more consequence than in the other. I cannot but think that if\n\nwe wish to know our exact position in England on this question before the\n\nmeeting of Parliament, and without being committed to anything, my be-\n\ning in England affords the best opportunity for it. I am entirely in ac-\n\ncord with the rest of, the Government as to the ground that ought to be\n\ntaken and maintained, and as to the end sought to be attained. I differ\n\nonly from the tone in which the Minute is written.\n\nOf course it is painful to both of us to find ourselves in a Government\n\nwith gentlemen who have not perfect sympathy with each other, but had\n\nyou or Gait or Cartier been in my present case, I think I would have in-\n\nsisted on your names being referred to in the handsomest possible manner.\n\nHad I been in a Cabinet with my own political friends, I could only have\n\nregarded any hesitation in the matter very gravely. In the present case it\n\nis different. We could not expect to form such a combination without\n\nfeeling it jar occasionally, and indeed there has been much less of it than I\n\nhad fully expected to encounter. I am not, therefore, complaining\n\nwhatever is done in the matter, I will not complain but I thought it only\n\nright to say to you thus I feel about it.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGEO. BROWN.\n\nHon.

Macdonald.\n\nPrivate.\n\nHalifax, December ijth, 1864.\n\nMY DEAR MACDONALD,\n\nI was glad to learn by your note of the I4th ultimo, that you had quite\n\nrecovered your health and that Richard was himself again. I was not\n\nsurprised, that the incessant fatigue and mental labour to which you\n\nwere so long subjected, should have told seriously upon you. We all\n\nregretted deeply that we were deprived of the pleasure of your society\n\nat Toronto.\n\nI quite concur in the alteration respecting the power of the Local Legis-\n\nlature to alter the constituencies of the House of Commons. I have\n\nconsulted Henry and McCully on the point, and they all agree to\n\nthe proposed alteration. I have already informed Mr. Gait that we concur\n\nin restricting the power of the local Government to tax lumber, to New\n\nBrunswick.\n\nI shall be very glad to receive your proposed draft of the Act as soon as\n\nyou can send it, and will offer you any suggestions I think desirable. Under\n\nexisting circumstances Canada had better pass the Act as near the report\n\nof the Conference as possible, and then the other Provinces should endeav-\n\nour to pass transcripts of it.\n\nI fear that the Government of New Brunswick has decided not to submit\n\nthe question to the people [sic, Legislature?] until after an appeal to the\n\npeople. They might do the necessary work of the session very soon and\n\ndissolve at once, and thus not much time would be lost, but the precedent\n\nis a bad one.\n\nWe have met a strong opposition here but we have the press pretty much\n\nwith us, and I hope we will be able to carry it through if properly sustained\n\nby the British Government. I wish very much Lord Monck would induce\n\nthe Colonial Secretary to authorize our Lieutenant Governor to appoint\n\ntwo or three additional Legislative Councillors if found necessary to carry\n\nthe Bill through the Upper House. I will send you a Colonist with our\n\nspeeches at the Confederation meeting last Friday night. It was a great\n\nsuccess. Many influential men previously opposed were convinced, and\n\nhave since come out in favour of the scheme.\n\nWill you let me know what you hear from the British Government? The\n\nexecutive department may, I think, be safely left to your judgment.\n\nTwelve executive councillors, much as you have them at present would, I\n\nthink, meet the case, but I quite agree with you that it is desirable to have\n\nthem in the Act. I would not distribute them locally at all. It will be\n\nan element of weakness in my opinion. Would it be practicable to provide\n\nfor surrendering local Governments? I suppose not, although I think it\n\nvery desirable.\n\nI hope Mr. Brydges will be able to give me an early assurance that he\n\nwill construct the Truro and Moncton line under the terms of our resolu-\n\ntion, to be amalgamated with the Intercolonial after confederation. It\n\nneed not be published until after your legislation is perfected. Mr.\n\n1 8 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nFleming i will locate the line, and an arrangement for the rest of the line to\n\nCanada, contingent upon the Confederation taking place. It will damage\n\nme seriously if this matter be imperilled by the want of Canada’s consent.\n\nYou can at all times rely upon me to any extent.\n\nEver yours faithfully,\n\nC. TUPPER.\n\nHon. J. A. Macdonald.\n\nFrom the Hon. John A. Macdonald to Thomas Swinyard, Esq?\n\nQuebec, iqth December, 1864..\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nI am much obliged for your letter of the 13 th and I hope\n\nyou will not fail, whenever you think the subject of any\n\nimportance or interest, to write me.\n\nI quite agree with you as to the importance of satisfying\n\nour American neighbours that Canada is in earnest in vin-\n\ndicating the majesty of the law, and in suppressing with all\n\npromptness and vigour, any attempts to infringe it. You\n\nwill see that Gilbert McMicken has been appointed stipen-\n\ndiary magistrate, with full powers to organize a detective and\n\npreventive police force, for the purpose of watching and\n\npatrolling the whole frontier from Toronto to Sarnia, and I\n\nhave specially instructed him to put himself in communica-\n\ntion with the American authorities at Buffalo and Detroit.\n\nHe is a shrewd, cool and determined man, who won’t easily\n\nlose his head, and who will fearlessly perform his duty.\n\nThe Governor-General has also called out, for service,\n\nbetween 1,500 and 2,000 Volunteer Militia, who will be\n\nstationed at the proper points, for the purpose of preventing\n\nand putting down the first attempt that may be made to con-\n\ntinue these aggressions on the United States.\n\n1 Afterwards Sir Sandford Fleming, K.C.M.G., at that time Engineer in charge\n\nof the surveys on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government and the Governments of\n\nCanada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, preliminary to the construction of the\n\nIntercolonial Railway, upon which the Maritime Provinces set great store as the\n\nmaterial link connecting them with the Upper Provinces. Provision for its early\n\nconstruction forms Article 145 of the British North America Act, 1867. Owing to\n\nvarious delays, the Intercolonial was not opened for traffic until 1876.

Died, 25th February, 1915.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD 19\n\nThe unhappy and mistaken decision of Coursol at Mon-\n\ntreal 1 has had a most unfortunate tendency. From the fact\n\nof his being called ‘Judge’ Coursol, his decision is considered\n\na judicial one in the United States. He was however merely\n\nacting in his capacity as police magistrate, and altogether\n\nmistook his duty, when he presumed to judge as to his right\n\nto discharge those prisoners. It was his duty to assume\n\nthat he had the authority under the statute, and the question\n\nof jurisdiction should only have been brought up to be\n\nsolemnly decided by the Superior Courts. A new process\n\nhas been issued, however, and it is hoped that these men,\n\nor the majority of them, will be rearrested, and the discredit\n\nthrown upon the administration of justice in Canada,\n\nremoved.\n\nThe general order 2 of Gen. Dix was most unfortunate\n\nand uncalled for. It did not affect us in any measure as\n\nCanadians, but it was a direct insult to the sovereignty of\n\nEngland. I am quite sure that it was issued in the irrita-\n\ntion of the moment on hearing of the release of the St. Al-\n\nbans raiders, and will meet no countenance or support from\n\nthe United States Government.\n\nWe must perform our duty, however, irrespective of the\n\nsmiles or frowns of any foreign body, and will never be hur-\n\nied into extra exertions by proclamations like those of Gen.\n\n1 This refers to a raid made on St. Albans, Vermont, by a band of Confederate\n\nsoldiers, twenty-five, or so, in number, headed by one Bennet H. Young, a lieutenant\n\nin the Southern army. The plot was organized in Chicago, from which point the\n\nmain body of the marauders proceeded direct to their destination through the\n\nUnited States, Young and three others going by way of Canada. On the igth\n\nOctober, 1864, they met in St. Albans, where they plundered three banks, attempted\n\nto fire the town, and escaped to Montreal. They were arrested with a view to their\n\nextradition under the Ashburton Treaty, but discharged by ‘Judge’ Coursol on tech-\n\nnical grounds. They were immediately re-arrested and tried before the Superior\n\nCourt at Montreal, but again set at liberty, the Court holding that they were belli-\n\ngerents and, as such, not subject to extradition. Subsequently fresh arrests were\n\nmade, and the venue changed from Montreal to Toronto, but with no substantial\n\nresults, and the latest prosecutions came to nothing.\n\n2 United States Major General of Volunteers, John A. Dix, Commanding the\n\nEastern Department, which included Vermont, on the I4th December, 1864, issued\n\na Proclamation instructing all military commanders on the frontier, in certain\n\nspecified cases, to cross the boundary line between the United States and Canada\n\nin pursuit of offenders. This order, having been disavowed by the President of the\n\nUnited States, was withdrawn three days after its appearance.\n\n20 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nDix, or prevented by any feeling of indignation from carrying\n\nour laws into full force.\n\nI am,\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOHN A.

I hear of no meetings against it, and\n\nas yet there have been no petitions transmitted adverse to\n\nthe policy. Under these circumstances the Government\n\nhave a right to assume, as well as the Legislature, that the\n\nscheme, in principle, meets with the approbation of the\n\ncountry, and as it would be obviously absurd to submit the\n\ncomplicated details of such a measure to the people, it is not\n\nproposed to seek their sanction before asking the Imperial\n\nGovernment to introduce a Bill in the British Parliament.\n\nThe Conservative Association should, however, prepare for\n\nthe elections, as they cannot be very far off, should the\n\nConfederation scheme be carried into effect.\n\nI am not sorry to learn that Dr. Parker’s 1 popularity is on\n\nthe wane. With a good deal of cleverness he is very super-\n\nficial, and is soon found out. This opinion is of course entre\n\nnous.\n\nI am,\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJOHN A.

Macdonald.\n\nConfidential.\n\nGrand Trunk Office,\n\n21 Old Broad Street, E. C.\n\n18 February, 1865.\n\nMY DEAR MR. MACDONALD:\n\nI was taken to the Colonial Office yesterday by the British North\n\nAmerican Association in whose proceeding I have taken no part since\n\nyour friend Mr. Holton and others denounced it as a Grand Trunk institu-\n\ntion.\n\nLord Shaftesbury, Lord Wharncliffe, and the rest, wanted me to assist\n\nthem to push Cardwell on in some settlement of the North West Territory,\n\nas to which reports are constantly coming perhaps exaggerated of\n\npossible massacres, and certain Yankee occupation.\n\nWhen I was in Canada last, I consulted you and Mr. Cartier, and many\n\nothers, as to what was best to be done politically with the North West\n\n1. Should it remain as it is a wilderness, as Mr. Robert Lowe recom-\n\nmends ?\n\n2. Should it be an independent Colony? or\n\n3. Should it be annexed to Canada?\n\nYour views and Mr. Carder’s were in favour of a separate Crown\n\nColony. Mr. George Brown’s view was in favour of a Colony having a\n\ncommon Customs house with Canada, but a separate Government.\n\nHow far Confederation has modified either views I should be glad to\n\nknow.\n\nCardwell asked me to remain after the deputation had gone, and I\n\ngathered the impression generally that he was very anxious to get you\n\n(Canada) to take all the responsibility, so that he would have no vote to\n\nask for, for the erection of a Crown Colony.\n\nIt seems to me as an outsider, that it would be a great mistake for\n\nCanada to take the responsibility of governing the North West, as part of\n\nherself, and especially on the question of defence ist. against the Indians,\n\nand 2nd against the Yankees but of course if you see your way to doing\n\nit those of us who simply want to see the country settled, could make no\n\nobjection but if you really want the British Government to found and be\n\nresponsible for a new Colony, you had better let me know, and I will put\n\nthe idea into the minds of our friends who wish it.\n\nOf course I write confidentially, but there is no reason why you should\n\nnot mention the fact that I have written, to Mr. Cartier or Mr. Gait\n\nor Mr. Brown should you desire it.\n\nI never like to intrude myself in Canadian affairs, as I have had so many\n\nsnubbings for doing it therefore if any offer of service, and request for\n\nX A leading English railway magnate; President of the Grand Trunk Railway\n\n(1861-1863); a member of the Imperial House of Commons.

The idea is at present very crude and may\n\nbe utterly Utopian, but influential as Bright is at present with the Govern-\n\nment of the United States, I can see, tho’ somewhat mistily, that we might\n\nmake him of great service in suggesting, and then negotiating some mea-\n\nsure, based on the theory which neutralized your Lakes, but would save\n\nCanada the cost of an excessive military preparation, and prevent her soil\n\nbecoming like portions of Holland, Prussia, and of Northern Hindustan,\n\nfor example, the battle field for human passions, to be laid waste whenever\n\nEngland choses to quarrel with the States, or the States with England\n\napart from Canadian questions.\n\nFaithfully yours\n\nE.

Mr.\n\nTilley should have called his Parliament together, and, in\n\naccordance with the agreement of the Conference at Quebec,\n\nsubmitted the scheme. Whatever might have been the\n\nresult in the legislature, the subject would have been fairly\n\ndiscussed and its merits understood, and if he had been\n\ndefeated, he then had an appeal to the people. As it was,\n\nthe scheme was submitted without its being understood or\n\nappreciated, and the inevitable consequences followed.\n\nI regret to find that the course of events in New Bruns-\n\nwick has frightened the legislature in Nova Scotia. In\n\nCanada you see that we carried the Address, in both Houses,\n\nby majorities of nearly three to one, and we now send four\n\nof our Ministers to England to take stock, to use a mercantile\n\ni Colonel the Hon. John Hamilton Gray, C.M.G., at that time Premier of\n\nPrince Edward Island.\n\n24 CORRESPONDENCE OF\n\nphrase, with the British Government, and to see what can\n\nbest be done.\n\nWe intend also to arrange, if possible, the subject of\n\ndefence. I do not at all despair of carrying out our great\n\nproject sooner or later. I quite agree with you that the\n\nBritish Government will carry their point, if they only\n\nadopt vigorous measures to that end, and we shall spare no\n\npains to impress the necessity of such a course upon them,\n\nwith what success remains to be seen.\n\nYour course in the crisis in Prince Edward Island was\n\nonly what we anticipated from a soldier and a gentleman,\n\nand long after present events have lost their interest, it will\n\ndwell in the memories of your family and your friends.\n\nPray present my best regards to those of the Prince Ed-\n\nward delegation whom you may meet, always excepting\n\nMessrs.

Macdonald, Cartier, Brown and Gait, proceeded to\n\nEngland for the purpose of talking over with Her Majesty’s\n\nGovernment certain questions relating to Confederation,\n\nDefence and the future relations of the Colonies to the\n\nmother country. They returned early in July.\n\nFrom the Hon. C. Tupper to the Hon. John A. Macdonald.\n\nHalifax,\n\nApril 9th, 1865.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nI intend to-morrow night to move the following resolution, and I am\n\nanxious that you should fully understand our position.\n\n“WHEREAS, under existing circumstances, an immediate Union of the\n\nBritish North American Provinces has become impracticable;\n\n“AND WHERAS, a Legislative Union of the Maritime Provinces is de-\n\nsirable, whether the larger Union be accomplished or not;\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD 25\n\n“RESOLVED, that in the opinion of this House the negotiations for the\n\nUnion of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, should\n\nbe renewed in accordance with the Resolution passed at the last session\n\nof the Legislature.”\n\nYou are well aware that I was very sanguine when in Canada that the\n\nQuebec scheme could be carried here. I knew that it would be exces-\n\nsively easy to excite our people on the question of taxation, but the organ\n\nof the Opposition being conducted by Mr. McCully,i secured the support\n\nof the two leading journals which influence public opinion, and with the\n\nGovernment and Messrs. Archibald 2 and McCully in favour, and Mr.\n\nHowe 3 neutralized as an Imperial Officer, if he did not assist, I knew no\n\neffectual opposition could be raised to our arrangements. A number of\n\nthe leading merchants here, many of them supporters of the Government,\n\nwere strongly opposed to Confederation with Canada, and they were\n\njoined by several of the members in Opposition to the Government, but\n\nit would not have given us the slightest trouble, had not Howe assumed\n\nthe leadership of the party, allowing his name to be freely used as opposed\n\nto the measure. Mr. McCully was then deposed from the editorial charge\n\nof the Morning Chronicle, and Mr. Howe putting Annand 4 forward as the\n\nostensible editor, took his place. Both Archibald and McCully have re-\n\nmained as true as steel, but it is doubtful if they could bring over two\n\nvotes in the Assembly, and the hands of the Government have been more\n\nthan correspondingly weakened by the alliance on this question with their\n\nopponents, and although apparently numerically strong, we have been\n\nparalyzed by the introduction of the assessment for the support of schools\n\nto such an extent as to shake the confidence of their supporters in the\n\nprospect of success in case of an appeal to the people. At this conjunc-\n\nture, when an appeal to the people had been adopted as a war cry, Tilley\n\nannounced his determination to yield to that demand, and followed it up\n\nby a dissolution. Had he succeeded by great sacrifices and exertions, we\n\ncould, I think, have secured a bare majority, but the moment he failed I\n\nfound that all my ingenuity would be required to avert the passage of a\n\nhostile Resolution. Here, as in New Brunswick, the opponents of Con-\n\nfederation profess to favour a union of the Maritime Provinces, although\n\n1 The Hon.

B. as well as in P. E. Island. As I\n\nknew the Opposition would bring this forward as a counter proposal,\n\nand that two thirds of our House must go for it, I thought it better to\n\nbring it forward in a subsidiary form. If adopted it will promote the\n\nlarger union, and place it on a better footing, and if lost it will remove the\n\nquestion out of the way of Confederation. Any negotiation under it must\n\nhave a good effect upon N. B., and it will leave us in the best position\n\nto agitate the subject. Twelve months will, I believe, find a decided\n\nmajority in the present Parliament being in favour of Confederation.\n\nWhile any resolution in favour would have been negatived after it was\n\ndecided against in New Brunswick, a majority of the members are favour-\n\nable, and unless I am deceived, a few months will bring the constituencies\n\nright, as they will be kept free from committing themselves.\n\nEver yours,\n\nC.

Nothing had been heard\n\nfrom you when I left, but I am on the lookout for a letter from you now.\n\nWe had the memo, of the first conversation between Cartier and Gait and\n\nMr. Cardwell. Our friends seemed to be pushing their arguments home.\n\nI trust that you may succeed the country is depressed beyond example\n\nand men talk of annexation, who a few months ago would have resented as\n\nan insult any imputation of the sentiments they now openly profess. Our\n\nQuebec conference has ‘certainly had a marked influence in directing men’s\n\nthoughts to the alternatives before the country. If you succeed Con-\n\nfederation goes on, and the reciprocity treaty be renewed we shall settle\n\ndown to work out our destiny as a portion of the Empire, with a future\n\nas a monarchy in the dim distance. But if you fail, and our farmers are\n\nagain placed in a position of inferiority as compared with those in the\n\nUnited States we shall be republicans in our own day, I think.\n\n1 Afterwards Sir Alexander Campbell, K.C.M.G.

Langevini has\n\ngenerally had some little axe to grind, but everyone else has been resting.\n\nWe got Chapais 2 to advertise for tenders for the Governor’s residence by\n\ndint of pushing. The day has not yet arrived for opening them I think.\n\n. . . . Kingston is dreadfully dull more so than usual, or I am\n\nmore struck with it half a dozen people in the street and every fellow with\n\na look of despondency.\n\nI look for you about aoth of June.

Macdonald.\n\nGovernment House,\n\nHalifax, 20th September, 1865.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nAmidst the hurry and worry of parting, I must thank you for your good\n\nwishes towards myself as Mandarin of Hong Kong.\n\nI wish before I left, the Delphic Oracle had spoken out a little more\n\nplainly in reference to the Intercolonial Railway.\n\nI have done my best to forward the Confederate cause by squeezing\n\nas much as possible of civility and frankness out of Lord Monck’s last\n\nnarrow and somewhat reluctant avowal of Canada’s willingness to abide\n\nby any course England may suggest.\n\nIn matters of that kind it has always seemed to me the best states-\n\nmanship to speak out boldly and frankly if one means to make a con-\n\ncession and so get full credit for it. I almost begin now to think that\n\nthere may be something in the suspicions of the Anti Federals as to the\n\npossible postponement of the Intercolonial by an Ottawa Parliament!!\n\nI wish I could have run up to Canada for a week or ten days. It would\n\nhave afforded me and Lady MacDonnell [sic] to have renewed our ac-\n\nquaintance with some of our friends at Quebec and Montreal. Lady\n\nMacDonnell sends her love to Monsr. Cartier at which I am furious.\n\nAs yet I have no idea who will administer here. I hope he will be able\n\nto complete some of my projected reforms and he will find an ample field\n\nfor improvement. I hope we shall meet again and you will always find\n\nme ready to brea"
