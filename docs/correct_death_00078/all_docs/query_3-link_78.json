        "text": "Sir John A. Macdonald (11 January 1815 – 6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nSourced quotes\n\nAs for myself, my course is clear. A British subject I was born — a British subject I will die. With my utmost effort, with my latest breath, will I oppose the ‘veiled treason’ which attempts by sordid means and mercenary proffers to lure our people from their allegiance.\n\nFebruary 3, 1891 as the 1891 election was called, fought largely over the issue of free trade with the United States.[1]\n\nSimple: As for myself, a British citizen I was born and a British citizen I will die. With my hardest effor, with my last breath as I die, I will oppose the hidden treasons which attempts by shameful means and bribes to lure our citizens away from Britian.\n\nLet us be English or let us be French... but above all let us be Canadians.[2]\n\nSimple: There are different groups of people in Canada, but we should all be Canadians first.\n\nYes, but the people would prefer John A. drunk to George Brown sober.\n\nResponding to a heckler. (from John A: The Man Who Made Us by Richard J. Gwyn)\n\nHe hoped that Britain and Canada would have \"a healthy and cordial alliance. Instead of looking upon us as a merely dependent colony, England will have in us a friendly nation, a subordinate but still a powerful people to stand by her in North America in peace or in war.\" - 1865[3]\n\nSimple: He hoped that Britain and Canada would have a strong alliance. And instead of them looking at us as a merely self-governing colony, England will see us a friendly nation and ally, a submissive, but still strong people to stand by her.\n\nI get sick ... not because of drink [but because] I am forced to listen to the ranting of my honourable opponent.\n\nDuring the election of 1863, Sir John A. Macdonald threw up during a campaign speech and when his opponent pointed this out, Macdonald shot back with this answer.[4]\n\nSimple: I get sick...not because I get drunk, but because I have to listent to my opponent talk.\n\nUnsourced quotes\n\nWe must protect the rights of minorities, and the rich are always fewer in number than the poor.\n\nSir John A. Macdonald said this in the privacy of the Quebec Conference of 1864 when they were constructing the Senate.\n\nThe scheme as a whole has met with almost universal approval.\n\nTalking to the legistlature about confederation.\n\nSimple: Almost everyone has agreed/accepted the plan (for Confederation.)\n\nI would be quite willing, personally, to leave that whole country a wilderness for the next half-century but I fear if Englishmen do not go there, Yankees will.\n\nLetter to Sir Edward W. Watkin-1865.\n\nSimple: For the next 50 years I would be willing to leave the west as a wilderness, but I fear if we do not settle it, the Americans will.\n\nI say that there is a deliberate conspiracy, by force, by fraud, or by both, to force Canada into the American Union.\n\nSpeech, Academy of Music, Toronto-1891.\n\nSimple: I believe there is a plan by violence, fraud, or both to force Canada to become part of America.\n\nAnyone can support me when they think I'm right. What I want is someone that will support me when I am wrong.\n\nYes, In my Canada the rich will always be a minority\n\nAsked if he believe in minority rights.\n\nAin't I the old devil though?\n\nAfter being read aloud a long list of political mistakes.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n\nJohn A. Macdonald on Wikipedia\n\nJohn A. Macdonald on Wikimedia Commons"
