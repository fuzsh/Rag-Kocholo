View Tribute Book\n\nIt is with profound sadness that the family of John “Jack” Allan MacDonald, age 63, announce his passing on Sunday May 30th in Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. Jack will be dearly missed by his loving wife of 41 years, Beverly MacDonald; sons Ross (Erin) MacDonald, New Glasgow, Steven (Erin) MacDonald, New York; grandchildren Emily, Alex, Liam and Luke. He is also survived by his mother May MacDonald, MacLellan’s Mountain; sisters Darlene Campbell MacDonald, Barbara MacDonald, Dorothy (Kevin) Lamey, brother Clarence MacDonald (Gillian Marks); sister-in-law Karen Cummings and numerous nieces and nephews. Jack is predeceased by his father John “Jack” MacDonald; brother David MacDonald, sister Margaret Lamey; father-in-law Ken Atkinson and mother-in-law Marion Atkinson. Ever the entrepreneur, Jack built a thriving heating and plumbing business before retiring early to travel with Beverly and enjoy life at Eden Lake. Jack’s voice and grin brought life to every room he was in. Jack was the heart of his beloved Eden Lake community. He enjoyed the simplest pleasures of lake life and made everyone feel like family when they arrived. When not working, you could often find him fishing and hunting with his lifelong friend Craig Fraser, tending to his impressive garden, or tinkering at a project on the tractor. Some of his proudest moments in life were making sweet memories with his grandchildren Emily, Alex, Liam and Luke who he adored with all his heart. Children flocked to Jack, and he became known to many around the lake as “Papa Jack”. If you would like to honor Jack’s memory, please consider donating to a children’s charity of your choice. A celebration of life will be held at a later date when we can all gather safely. www.angusfuneralhomes.com"
