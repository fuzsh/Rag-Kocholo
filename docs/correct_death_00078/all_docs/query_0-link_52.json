He was (not surprisingly) a dentist, and I know he served in Holland during the war. He died in 1979, but because I am not a direct descendent (he died childless) the National Archives have not given me much to go on. Also, I am looking to find out any information on my own uncle, David Andrew Hubbell, who signed up to fly as a gunner with the RCAF but was told that there were too many already and that he should try his luck with the Army. He joined up the army, and was in training to be part of the Canadian force to take part in the invasion of Japan, but of course the war ended before they even left the Niagara area. Unfortunately I don't know his regiment. He died of leukaemia shortly after his discharge in 1946. Since I was born in 1961, I never met him and since my own father died in 1984, I don't have a lot of ways of finding out about him. Can anybody remember David? Finally, t this is an RCAF (I know it is not army!!) question. I had a distant relative from Kitchener who died in the war, George Henry Hubbell, who was a lfight officer in 420 Squadron. He died June 1 1943 or therabouts. The only info I can find on his demise is in the official history of the RCAF where two aircraft were listed is missing over the Bay of Biscay after being jumped by two German JU 88s while on their way to a new base in Tunisia.

My name is Gianluigi Castellari and Iï¿½m the president of the Twinning Committee of Russi. Russi is a town (and a Commune) 16 km far from Ravenna, in Emilia-Romagna, North-East of Italy. Iï¿½m developing a research about the Liberation of our Commune made by the Canadian Army on December the 3rd 1944, in order to celebrate the Canadian regiments involved in it. I already have many information. I read the book by Farley Mowat ï¿½The Regimentï¿½ (but only in Italian and in abridged edition), where an entire chapter is about Russi and the ï¿½Chuckleï¿½ operation with the crossing of the river Lamone (northern border of Russi). I also read the official report of the Canadian Army about it. I found that many Canadians dead during the Liberation of our town are buried in the cimitery of Villanova di Bagnacavallo (but only those belonging to the 5th Armoured Division) and Iï¿½m still searching for the others (specially those of the 1st Infantry Division). Unfortunately I have only very few photographs and no film. I need help. 1 - I know the name of the 3 men that first entered Russi: - Sgt. F.C. CROUSE - F.79547 - Carleton and York Regiment - Lieut. R.B.SAVAGE - Carleton and York Regiment - Pte. C.W.KITCHEN - G.1551 - Carleton and York Regiment and the name of the officer that certified that: - Lieut. F.G.J.BLACK - Carleton and York Regiment Browsing the web site of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission I unfortunately found that Lt. R.B.Savage died in Holland on April 13th 1945. But the others didnï¿½t die in war. I would like, above all, to know if they are still alive and where do they live now. Anyway I would like to contact some relatives of all of them (including Savage); 2 - Iï¿½m searching for photos and films concerning the passage of Canadian troops through Russi and our Commune (1st Infantry on the West side and 5th Armoured Division on the East side) between December 1st and December 12th 1944, although some troops remained in Russi until January or February 1945. I know that in Montreal there is the ï¿½Candian Army Filmï¿½ but it has neither a web site nor an e-mail address: I would like to be connected with it or with anyone that could have something of interesting; 3 - Does a diary of each regiment or of each brigade exist? Where can I find them and get a copy of the chapters about Russi? 4 - I would like to buy an English unabridged edition of ï¿½The Regimentï¿½ by F.Mowat: can you tell me where I can find it? I shall be grateful to anyone that send me useful suggestions about my research.

They were authorized in 1866 in Dunnville Ontario. My great grandfather had enlisted sometime in the early 1890's and in all probability was a \"boy solier\". He was born on the Six Nations land and always claimed to be native, although he was not registered (his wife Alice Dolittle was). I am trying to trace my roots and my great grandfather's life before he married in West Lorne in 1898 was unknown until I got this lead. His name was Frederick Edwards he served in WW1 service number 123538, he was \"one hell of a soldier\" so I've been told because of his medals, Military medal plus two bars and others I can't recall. His records indicate his previous enlistment as 37th Regiment for six years. This was before he went to West Lorne in 1897. My research has lead me to the Haldimand Rifles.
