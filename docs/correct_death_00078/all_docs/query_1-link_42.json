Macdonald. On Aug. 29, 2020, a protest held in support of defunding police turned ugly at Place du Canada and the statue was brought down. The head of the statue came off when it was toppled.\n\nPhoto by John Mahoney / Montreal Gazette\n\nSince then, the city of Montreal has been silent on the issue of whether the statue should be returned to its location in Place du Canada. Although Macdonald was considered the key figure in Canadian Confederation — while he served as prime minister from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 to 1891 — modern historians have criticized some of his government’s legislation and programs, including the creation of the Indigenous residential school system in 1883.\n\nIn a release, the city said a public presentation will be made by the department of planning and development at city hall Wednesday morning during a meeting of the executive committee."
