Macdonald statue Wednesday Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThree years after it was pulled down and damaged during a protest at Place du Canada, the city of Montreal will announce Wednesday what it will do with the statue of Canada’s first prime minister.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city announced Montreal’s executive committee will reveal its plans concerning the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald. On Aug. 29, 2020, a protest held in support of defunding police turned ugly at Place du Canada and the statue was brought down. The head of the statue came off when it was toppled.\n\nSince then, the city of Montreal has been silent on the issue of whether the statue should be returned to its location in Place du Canada. Although Macdonald was considered the key figure in Canadian Confederation — while he served as prime minister from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 to 1891 — modern historians have criticized some of his government’s legislation and programs, including the creation of the Indigenous residential school system in 1883.\n\nIn a release, the city said a public presentation will be made by the department of planning and development at city hall Wednesday morning during a meeting of the executive committee.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nJohn A.
