        "text": "Given that he died in 1891, the facts of Sir John A. Macdonald’s life are unchangeable. The story of his life, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. During his life and for well over a century after his death, he was regarded as Canada’s foremost founding father and one of this country’s most colourful characters. Confederation was very much Macdonald’s singular achievement – the product of his masterful skill at negotiation, plus plenty of patience and resolve. He was also noted for his sunny disposition and lively sense of humour. A fondness for the bottle and being caught in a serious political scandal may have tempered history’s judgement, but only to the degree that such flaws revealed his humanity.\n\nLately, however, Macdonald has come to be defined by a completely different story. As a result of his participation in the Indian residential school system as well as the white settlement of the Prairies, it is now common to hear Macdonald’s legacy described as a black stain on Canada’s past. In 2018 Victoria, B.C. removed a statue of him from in front of City Hall following an official statement that identified Canada’s first prime minister as “the leader of violence against Indigenous peoples.” With similar motivation but somewhat less formality, last summer an angry mob tore down and decapitated a statue of Macdonald in Montreal, scrawling a profane slogan on his plinth.\n\nQueen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Macdonald’s home for much of his political career, recently removed his name from the school’s Faculty of Law building. Sir John A. Macdonald High School near Halifax, Nova Scotia, is doing the same thing. “Our current name does not align with [the school’s] values, nor does it reflect our school community,” the school’s principal told local media. Native rights activist Pam Palmater of Ryerson University goes much further in indicting Macdonald, claiming he was “responsible for genocide against Indigenous peoples.” It is now an open question whether Macdonald’s name will remain on any of the innumerable other schools, buildings and landmarks christened in his honour.\n\nFor most of Canada’s history, Macdonald was considered a nation-builder worthy of celebration and veneration. Today he’s a war criminal, at least to hear some tell it. One storyline has given way to another. But a proper and balanced consideration of Macdonald’s life as it was actually lived reveals that, through his own actions and policies, Canada’s first prime minister was directly and deliberately responsible for saving the lives of untold numbers of Indigenous people. It is easily argued, in fact, that no Canadian politician before or since has had such a salutary impact on Canada’s native population. Given the temper of our times, this isn’t likely to be a popular notion. But that doesn’t make it any less true.\n\nAvoiding War and Abiding by Treaties\n\nCanada’s treatment of its Indigenous people – and Macdonald’s role in it – is best understood in comparison with that of the native population in the United States. Given the arbitrariness of the Canada/U.S. border, we can consider the divergent experiences on either side to constitute a natural (if, for some, tragic) experiment. The results very much favour Macdonald’s Canada.\n\nAt Confederation, Canada was a small country of approximately 4 million people comprised of what’s now southern Ontario and southern Quebec plus Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The purchase of Rupert’s Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1870 and the entry of British Columbia into Confederation a year later increased Canada’s land mass tenfold; its Indigenous population similarly grew from an estimated 20,000 to 100,000. Macdonald’s plan was to turn Canada into a mighty nation befitting its new size by welcoming settlers from Europe and elsewhere to farm the largely empty Prairies. To do this would require a railway and the co-operation of the native people.\n\nTo the south lay the powerful United States. With a population ten times Canada’s and better transportation links (including the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and a vast and growing web of railways), the U.S. had opened much of its western lands to settlement before Canada even existed. The westward progress of this unorganized torrent of trappers, Buffalo hunters, goldminers, farmers, ranchers, sheepherders, merchants and assorted other fortune seekers was far from peaceful.\n\nBy and large, American settlers entered Indigenous lands ahead of any formal government presence and without negotiation with the original inhabitants. What treaties were signed between native tribes and the government were often abrogated as soon as it was in the best interest of white settlers to do so. Forced migrations, as authorized by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, further contributed to the dislocation and grievous harm experienced by native Americans. The Trail of Tears, for example, uprooted 16,000 mostly Cherokee natives from Georgia and relocated them to Oklahoma, an area with an entirely different climate and geography. This process – what might be considered a “settlement first, negotiation second” approach – inevitably led to conflict and war.\n\nIn 1890, as part of its regular census of the native population, the U.S. Congress requested a calculation of all lives lost in the more than 40 individual wars between Indigenous tribes and American settlers or government troops since signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The government’s best estimate for this hundred-year period put the death toll at 45,000 natives and 20,000 white soldiers and settlers. A more recent academic study using advanced statistical methods raises the native death toll to 60,000.\n\nLooking only at conflicts in the American West between 1850 and 1890 – the period most relevant to the settling of Canada’s Prairies – the Encyclopedia of Indian Wars calculates that 6,600 whites and 15,000 natives were killed or wounded in battles during this four-decade span. It should be noted that the above figures do not include the loss of life caused by government policies carried out at gunpoint outside of war. The Trail of Tears, for example, is estimated to have caused 4,000 to 8,000 native deaths, an astounding casualty rate of 25-50 percent.\n\nStanding in stark and, from the Canadian perspective, greatly uplifting contrast to these appalling figures is a companion document to the 1890 U.S. Congress report, concerning the Canadian experience. Significantly, it makes no mention of any death toll arising from “Indian Wars” in this country. This was not an oversight. Since the British conquest of New France in 1761, there were no significant wars in what is now Canada prior to the Riel Rebellion of 1885. And this solitary armed conflict was a Métis uprising notable for its lack of large-scale native participation; the First Nation death toll from the entire conflagration was no more than a few dozen.\n\nSuch a long and, it must be said, happy period of peaceful relations between Indigenous and white populations in Canada was largely the result of British policy that sought to make and keep treaties with native communities. Recall that one of the American Revolution’s underlying causes was the British colonial government’s determination to prevent white settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, a commitment made in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The British approach is best characterized as “negotiation first, settlement second.”\n\nAs Canada’s first prime minister, Macdonald was extremely proud of this legacy of peaceful co-operation and co-habitation. And he was determined to maintain such a policy while overseeing the settlement of Canada’s West. In 1870 Macdonald sent the Rev. Jean-Baptiste Thibault as his emissary to natives throughout the former Hudson’s Bay Company lands. Thibault’s instructions (see page 45) clearly reflect his Conservative government’s fervent desire to avoid an American-style invasion of the Prairies:\n\nTo avoid repeating the violence associated with the settling of the American West, Macdonald appointed Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris to negotiate with native tribes before widespread white settlement took place on the Canadian Prairies. This process consumed nearly a decade, but by 1877 seven numbered treaties had been signed covering all 30,000 natives residing in the southern portions of what are today Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. In exchange for relinquishing their broader land rights, the First Nations received reserves in their traditional territory and benefits including food, medicine, education and agricultural training.\n\nThe native chiefs who signed these treaties were well-aware of the alternative to British-style negotiation. This was not only because thousands of U.S. natives had fled across the “Medicine Line” into Canada to escape conflict with the U.S. Cavalry, but because many Canadian tribes traditionally roamed south of the border and had seen firsthand the violence.\n\nWhile Macdonald is today frequently accused of perpetrating genocide against Indigenous people, in his own time the prime minister was repeatedly rebuked by the Liberal Opposition for being overly generous in his native policy. In 1885, for example, he was criticized for placing native reserves on their traditional territories, which, in some cases, was prime farmland close to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Liberal MPs, such as New Brunswick’s Peter Mitchell, felt this was a waste of good farmland and demanded Macdonald forcibly relocate the natives farther north so white settlers could more profitably take the land, a proposal disturbingly similar to the Trail of Tears. Macdonald opposed such a policy on moral grounds. As he said in the 1885 House of Commons debates (see page 2,426):\n\nThis nation-wide policy was so successful that in 1885, when a particularly deadly smallpox outbreak killed 3,000 residents of Montreal, the Kahnewake native reserve across the river reported “but very few cases” of the disease. Everyone on the reserve had already been vaccinated by the federal government.\n\nUntold numbers of Indigenous people died throughout the Canadian West prior to the 1870s as a result of smallpox. Yet due to the commitment of Liberal and Conservative administrations, the death toll among native Canadians from the disease by the 1880s and beyond was close to zero. As University of Saskatchewan historian and notable Macdonald critic James Daschuk wrote in his widely-cited 2013 book Clearing the Plains, the federal government “virtually eliminated smallpox as a major cause of mortality among First Nations.” Smallpox vaccination on the Prairies is one of Canada’s great public health success stories and it saved many, many native lives. Macdonald deserves his share of the glory.\n\nFamine Relief for Plains Natives\n\nThe gravest charges against Macdonald’s legacy involve his role in the famine among the Indigenous population of the Prairies following the collapse of North America’s buffalo herds in the late 1870s. The claim that Macdonald was responsible for a “state-sponsored attack on Indigenous communities” by denying food relief in order to open the Prairies to white settlement is forcefully made in Clearing the Plains. Perhaps the most stinging indictment comes from Macdonald’s own words. Daschuk twice quotes Macdonald from 1882 saying his government was “doing all we can, by refusing food until the Indians are on the verge of starvation, to reduce the expense.” This line is also repeated in many current-day condemnations of Macdonald as evidence of his lack of compassion for Indigenous people.\n\nThe near-extinction of the continental buffalo herds caused tremendous hardship for Canada’s western Indigenous communities, which depended on the meat, bones and hide of the buffalo for much of their sustenance and supplies. While this outcome was widely predicted in the late 1800s, it occurred much faster than anyone expected. Responsibility for this calamity cannot be laid at Macdonald’s feet. Rather, it was the result of rampant American hunting aimed at the buffalo’s eradication to facilitate settlement and farming, as well as U.S. military tactics to starve out certain native tribes, plus environmental changes.\n\nThe buffalo die-off occurred just as Macdonald’s government was completing the numbered treaties process – deals Daschuk admits were largely fair and “reached from positions of mutual strength.” As a result, some treaties included explicit clauses for government aid; Treaty Six, for example, makes the following provision:\n\nThis was the largest famine relief program Canada had provided up to that point. That it occurred in the midst of a severe economic recession in Eastern Canada makes its scale all the more impressive. In fact, such a commitment to public aid in Canada would not be equaled until the Great Depression, nearly 50 years later. In his 1880 Annual Report of Indian Affairs, Edgar Dewdney, Indian Commissioner for the North-West reported that nearly all 30,000 natives under treaty in western Canada were receiving some form of federal food aid.\n\nAcquiring a sufficient supply of food, shipping it across the continent and distributing it throughout the sparsely populated West, where there was as-yet no railway, was a daunting logistical task. Like many massive government programs implemented on short notice – including the current response to the COVID pandemic – the famine relief program was bedevilled by allegations of incompetence and corruption, as Daschuk’s book amply details. And while corruption and incompetence are never acceptable, there is no evidence Macdonald personally or politically benefitted from these problems.\n\nRather, Macdonald’s famine relief program suffered from a constant barrage of political attacks regarding the overall cost to taxpayers. The Liberals wanted to spend less on the native file. Much less. Let’s return to that damning quotation in which Macdonald appears to boast about keeping the native population “on the verge of starvation, to reduce the expense.” While this appears callous and inhumane, it doesn’t tell the whole story.\n\nMacdonald made these remarks during debate on the 1882 budget. Liberal MP David Mills, who later sat on the Supreme Court of Canada, was arguing that the $294,524 set aside for “Supplies for destitute Indians,” was excessive and should be lowered. “I believe a barbarous population like the Indians may be made wholly dependent upon Government” through handouts, Mills asserted. He was, in essence, proposing that any money spent on native famine relief was money wasted because it would engender a culture of dependency. To this Macdonald retorted “When they fall into a state of destitution, we cannot allow them to die for want of food.”\n\nMacdonald’s statement about keeping natives “on the verge of starvation” was meant to acknowledge the Opposition’s complaints about costs. But the full exchange reveals a deeper concern for the wellbeing of natives and their treaty rights. In a similar exchange, this one in the 1880 House of Commons debates (see page 1,942) Macdonald frames the issue as a moral one:\n\nIt is also true that the collapse of their traditional way of life due to the disappearance of the buffalo led to many tragic outcomes for Western Canada’s Indigenous people, in particular an increased susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis. But eradicating this disease was far beyond Macdonald’s control; there would be no effective treatment for tuberculosis (or “consumption” as it was usually called at the time) until the discovery of streptomycin in 1944. In fact tuberculosis was also a major killer of non-native Canadians in urban areas throughout Macdonald’s time; between 1850 and 1900, for example, it was the leading cause of death among adults in Toronto.\n\nResidential Schools\n\nResidential schools also figure prominently in popular claims that Macdonald was responsible for a “genocide” of Indigenous people. In fact, the first such schools appeared in Canada in 1695, long before Macdonald’s tenure. And their application to western Canada cannot properly be regarded as a government plot to permanently eliminate native culture. Under the seven numbered treaties, the federal government was obligated to build and staff such schools only when requested to do so by native leaders, or, as Treaty Six clearly states, “whenever the Indians of the reserve shall desire it.”\n\nAnd they clearly did desire it: during Macdonald’s tenure as prime minister no fewer than 185 on-reserve day schools and 20 residential schools were built. This reveals a strong interest among native leaders to have their children given a western-style education, as well as a preference for local over residential schools at this time. And attendance was entirely voluntary.\n\nAlthough the Progressive movement across North America at this time was pushing governments everywhere to make schooling universally compulsory, Macdonald resisted this for native children. Without parental support, he believed, native education would not succeed. Accordingly, it was left up to native parents to decide whether their offspring should go to school. This policy continued long after Macdonald’s death.\n\nAs late as 1920, attendance at all native schools in Canada was still entirely voluntary, as that year’s Indian Affairs Annual Report (see page 106) makes plain. Within day schools, the dropout rate from Grade 1 to Grade 2 was more than 70 percent; only 46 native students across Canada chose to continue to Grade 6 at on-reserve day schools. Attendance in the residential school system was similar. In 1920 about half of all students in those schools returned home permanently after Grade 1. At Alberta’s 19 residential schools, for example, native enrollment fell from 310 in Grade 1 to 171 in Grade 2 to 11 in Grade 6. These schools were not prison camps – anyone who wished to could leave. And many did."
