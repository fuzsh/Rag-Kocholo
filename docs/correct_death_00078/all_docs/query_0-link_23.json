After the outbreak of war in 1939, he was attested to the Canadian Active Service Force and promoted to the rank of major. When the active component of his regiment was redesignated to become an Anglophone armoured unit, he requested a transfer to the infantry and became the Deputy Commanding Officer of Régiment de la Chaudière in England.\n\nIn December 1943, he became the Commanding Officer of the Royal 22e Régiment in Italy.\n\nHe was in command of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade at the end of the war in Germany, in the rank of brigadier (now brigadier-general). He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on three occasions. He was the Canadian Military Attaché in Moscow after the war until 1948 when he was appointed Commander for the East Quebec Area.\n\nDuring the Korean War, he commanded the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade from April 1953. He signed the truce at Panmunjon on Canada's behalf on 27 July 1953.\n\nHe became commander of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade in 1954 and Commander of the Eastern Quebec Area in 1956. In 1958 he was made Vice-Chief of the General Staff.\n\nAs a major-general, he commanded the British 4th Division from 1961 to 1963, as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1964 he was made Chief of Operational Readiness. As a lieutenant-general, he was Commander, Mobile Command from 1965 to 1966, comprising the Canadian land forces in Canada and, at that time, the close air support forces, as well.\n\nIn July 1966, Allard was promoted to full general. From 1966 to 1969, he was Chief of the Defence Staff. He was the first francophone to occupy this position. It was under his supervision that the Canadian Forces were integrated.\n\nHe was heavily involved in the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces. He is also remembered for the implementation of a significant expansion of French-language units (FLUs) in the Army (the creation of a French-language brigade at CFB Valcartier with units of all arms and services), in the Air Force (the creation of French-language squadrons) and in the Navy (the creation of French-language ships).\n\nIn 1985, he published his memoirs, with English translation in 1988 The memoirs of General Jean V. Allard, written in cooperation with Serge Bernier. He retired to the city of Trois-Rivières, where he and his wife lived out their days. Simone died on 24 April 1995. He died the following year, on 23 April 1996 ANDERSON, Raymond M A 3 December 1930 6 November 2008 Ray died peacefully at the Victoria Hospice in the presence of his family after a short but courageous battle with cancer. He was born on the family farm near Frenchman's Butte, Saskatchewan and was predeceased by his father Oscar and mother Mary. He is survived by his wife Sylvia (nee Shearer), sons Ross and Gordon (Norma), his daughter Janet, his granddaughters Karyn, Melissa and Alisha. He also leaves behind his sister Estelle, her sons Robin (Patty) and Rick (Sandra), his sister-in-law Norma Shearer and many aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces. Growing up in rural Saskatchewan, Ray began teaching before going on to study at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon and then the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. There, he studied physics and joined the Canadian Officers' Training Corps, gaining his commission in the Royal Canadian Artillery in 1952, and graduating two years later. He served widely in Canada and Germany, latterly as an Air Observation Post pilot and instructor. Leaving the Canadian Army as a captain in 1964, Ray and his family moved to Victoria where he resumed his career in education. He taught and tutored many students before deciding to retrain in the new field of computing. After a course of study at the University of Victoria, he then began to work for the Provincial Government as a computer programmer and later as a systems analyst. There, he made a large personal contribution to the transformation of the Government Superannuation and Vehicle Licensing systems from a paper-based to electronic operation. He finally retired from the BC Systems Corporation in 1995 after many years of dedicated and successful service. Ray will be remembered for all those he knew for his kindness, patience and generosity. He was married to Sylvia in Winnipeg in 1957 and they celebrated 51 years of happiness together. He was a highly accomplished musician, playing the accordion from youth, and had an abiding interest in current affairs and science. He had many fond memories of his service in 1 RCHA, especially in Iserlohn, Germany as well as flying with the Air OP. He was a member of Mensa and the Air OP Association. He was extremely proud of his children and was especially supportive of all their activities. A devoted husband, father and grandfather, he will be greatly missed by his family and many friends. Ray's family would like to pass on their deepest thanks to the staff of the Victoria Hospice for their care and consideration. There was no service by request. Peter was born in Northern Ontario and after Junior Matriculation worked for a year in the Sudbury district nickel mines. Not convinced there was much future underground, he returned to school and finished his Senior Matriculation. He immediately applied and was selected for RCAF aircrew training.\n\nHis qualifications followed the usual route: Chipmunks at Centralia; Harvards at Penhold; and wings on the T-33s at Portage. He completed the F-86 Sabre OTU at Chatham, New Brunswick and was posted to 4 Fighter Wing with 444 Squadron at Baden-Soellingen, Germany. In Baden, Peter met and married his lifetime partner Jane.\n\nWhen the CF-104s were introduced, 444 was the first Air Division Squadron to disband and Peter found himself in Downsview, Ontario as an Administrative Officer. A chance conversation with Neil Coward convinced him to transfer to the Canadian Army in November 1964. He completed Officer Training at the Service Corps School in Borden.\n\nHis Army flying followed with training on the L-19s and the CH-112 helicopters at Rivers, Manitoba. Still at Rivers, he was posted to 1 Transport Helicopter Platoon, RCASC. When the unit split East and West during the summer of 1966 Captain Armstrong went with the Western Detachment in Edmonton. From Edmonton, Peter moved to St. Hubert, Quebec in 1968 to HQ 10 TAG in the new Tactical Evaluation Section, evaluating helicopter squadrons, CF-5 squadrons, a Buffalo light transport squadron and the Air Reserve Otter squadrons. In 1970 he qualified on the CH-118 Iroquois and the new CH-135 Twin Huey at Petawawa and was sent back to Edmonton in December 70 to the new 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron as the unit's Standards Officer.\n\nAfter three years in 408 Sqn, he left for NDHQ and the Directorate of Flight Safety. From DFS he graduated from the CF Command and Staff College and joined 403 Squadron as a Flight Commander and then Chief Instructor. After four years in Gagetown, New Brunswick, he moved to Winnipeg and Air Command Headquarters in the Flying Training Section and then to 550 Tac Hel. While there, a chance opportunity arose and Major Armstrong accepted the position of DCO 444 Sqn at the Canadian Brigade in Germany.\n\nHis final posting back in Canada was as the Wing Operations Officer at Portage La Prairie. From there he took his release 30 years from the date he joined the military. He joined the Civil Service after and worked as the Safety Officer at Base Winnipeg. In retirement Pete and Jane\n\ntravelled extensively and wintered in Texas. Unfortunately, he struggled with ALS and passed away 5 Jun 21.\n\nIn Peter's own words: \"It's difficult to remember the hard rock mines, but it is a pleasure to remember the Davis', the Cowards, Allinghams, Swains, Zeggils, Halls, Grants, Bartleys, Waldrums, Simmons', Flaths, Homes, and the many pilots, officers and gentlemen that this enjoyable career has had the fortune to be associated with.\"\n\nHis official obituary was published in the Winnipeg Free Press Saturday 12 Jun 2021. Major-General Douglas Roger Baker was born on 22 January, 1931 in Toronto. He first enrolled in the Canadian Army Reserves (45 Anti-Tank Regiment) as an officer cadet in 1948. He was commissioned as a Lieutenant with 2nd Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (2RCHA) in October 1950, and served with that Regiment in Korea.\n\nHe completed his pilot training in Rivers and upon graduation served with the Air Observation Post Flight Shilo, as Detachment Commander. He was promoted Captain and returned to regimental duty with 2nd Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery in Winnipeg in 1956.\n\nAfter attending the year long Artillery Staff Course in 1957, he was employed as an Instructor-in-Gunnery at the Royal Canadian School of Artillery, Shilo. He attended the Canadian Army Staff College from 1961 to 1963 and he was promoted Major in August 1963 and appointed Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (Operations) 2nd British Division in Germany.\n\nHe returned to Canada in 1965 as a Battery Commander in 4th Regiment RCHA stationed in Petawawa. Promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in 1967, he once more returned to Germany this time to command the 1st Regiment RCHA. On completion of this tour in 1969 he was appointed Commandant of the Canadian Forces School of Artillery in Shilo, which was amalgamated with the Combat Arms School in Gagetown in 1970, where he became Director of the Arms Division of the Combat Arms School, in November 1971, then became Deputy Commandant of the School.\n\nHe was promoted Colonel in 1972 to command Canadian Forces Base Shilo and in 1975 he attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, England.\n\nPromoted Brigadier-General in 1976 he became Director General Recruiting, Education and Training in National Defence Headquarters Ottawa until July 1979 when he was appointed Commander of the Combat Training Centre in Gagetown.\n\nIn July 1980, on promotion to Major-General, he moved to St Hubert, Quebec where he became the Deputy Commander of Mobile Command and the Division Commander for Exercises RV 81 and RV 83.\n\nMajor-General Baker has the following decorations: Commander of the Order of Military Merit, Korea Medal, UN Service Medal (Korea), Jubilee Medal, Canadian Forces Decoration. He is married to Beverley Lewis and has a daughter, Dianne and two sons, Fred and Geoffrey.\n\nDouglas Baker of Orillia, passed away at the Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital on Tuesday, January 21, 2020, in his 89th year. Beloved husband of Beverley Baker, loving father of Dianne Watchorn (James), Fred Baker (Kathleen) and the late Geoffrey Baker and surviving wife Kathleen. Cherished grandad of Michael (Sabrina), Rebecca (Patrick Kong), Matthew (Rozlyn Young), Carrie (Michael Akister) and Ryan. Loved by his great grandchildren Emma, Alessandra, Benjamin, Elizabeth, Madeline and Emmett. A celebration of life will take place at a later date.\n\nGeneral Baker was one of Canada’s greatest Gunners of the Cold War – admired and respected by all. Peter was born on Gloucester, UK, but seeking adventure, he packed his bags and immigrated to Canada in the summer of 1951. He worked at several ventures in Western Canada, including the University of Manitoba’s farm, a stint as a miner in Saskatchewan and at a fiberglass company in Edmonton before deciding on the Army as a possible career. It was in Edmonton that he met and married Gwendolyn Carol Fleury in 1954.\n\nHe enrolled in the Royal Canadian Artillery as a gunner the same year. Following his basic training and demonstrating the necessary aptitude, he was selected for officer training the following year at the Royal Canadian School of Artillery in Shilo, Manitoba and graduated in 1956. 2Lt Baldaro spent 2 years on regimental duties in Winnipeg before training as an Air Observation Post pilot at RCAF Station Centralia, Ontario and at the Canadian Joint Air Training Centre in Rivers, Manitoba. He received his ‘wings’ 13 May 1960. He and his course mates were the first of 17 serials to train as pilots on the Centralia-Rivers stream.\n\nLieutenant Baldaro spent the next 3 years in Germany serving with the Air OP Troop of 3 RCHA. He was promoted Captain in 1963 and remained with the Regiment when they rotated back to Canada in 64. In 1965 he attended the Artillery Staff Course and spent the next two and a half years instructing at the RCSA, Shilo before returning to Germany to serve with 1 RCHA’s Air OP Troop in Soest and Lahr. When the Air OP Troop was disbanded, Peter first had to return to Canada for his helicopter qualification before going back overseas to join 444 Tac Hel Sqn.\n\nIn 1973 he and his family were back in Canada at CFB Southport, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nPeter had the position of maintenance test pilot for the Kiowa and Musketeers fleets. He was promoted Major in 1977 and by then had moved from his flying position to that of Manager of the Officers’ Mess until his retirement in 1979.\n\nPeter and his wife Carol lived on and operated a small hobby farm for a period while Peter was employed full time as manager of the Co-Op Store in Portage and Carol worked for the City of Portage and then Manpower Canada. Once both retired, they move back to live in Portage where Peter passed away in the summer of 1992. The consummate Officer and Gentleman ‘departed the fix’ April 7, 2019.\n\nFrank was a 49-year veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces who rose through the ranks from BOY soldier to Colonel. He was extremely proud of his service and encouraged all veterans to be proud of theirs. He served 14 months in Korea with the 81st Field RCA and 4 RCHA. He understood PTSD. His wings were ARMY WINGS. His life in the air began November 11, 1959 on a Chipmunk in Centralia. He flew L-19s as an Air OP Officer with the military and Cessnas for 17 years as an instructor at Confederation College Thunder Bay. His last flight in a light aircraft was September 2017 in an L-19 he had first flown in March 1960. In his words “a sentimental journey”. He was a Gunner, helicopter pilot, base safety officer, reservist, 55+ year member of the Royal Canadian Legion. His presence will be missed by KVA Unit 13, 11th Field Regiment Senate, NAFR and Masons. He canvassed for Cancer, barbequed sausages at fund raisers and supported the growth of young officers through 1ABA*. He travelled to all 10 provinces and 3 territories. His favourite vacation destinations were Nova Scotia, Scotland, New Zealand and OZ, as much for what each has to offer as for the friends and family he visited. He signed his organ donor card and had 8 years remaining on his 10-year passport! He was a mentor and friend. If you met him, you will remember him.\n\nAs part of the ‘Memory Project’ and as a great story teller, he spoke to both elementary and high school students, service groups and veterans’ organizations. He spoke of war, peace, and how Winnie the Pooh met John McCrae’s horse, Bonfire, during WW I.\n\nHe was the only son of Willard James Bayne and Alice Gaston Worton, brother to Marian Jordan of Ottawa. Father of David, whose sudden death in 2014 left a big gap in Frank’s life. Sadly missed by daughters Francine in Texas, Nancy, Shirley both in Ontario and Donelda in Alberta. Their mother Gladys Globe Bayne resides in Barrie. He was honoured to be step-dad to Cindy, Candy and Melissa. These 8 children brought 20 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren into the family circle.\n\nHis LAST wife, Lynn Borthwick of Guelph, convinced him that the five 90th birthday parties she organized in 2017 were his Celebrations of Life. When family and friends from across North America and points overseas participated in the festivities, he understood.\n\nHis family will gather graveside with bag pipes and trumpet at a date in the future.\n\nDonations to Soldier On Canada or The Frank Bayne Ubique Award for ‘Esprit de Corps’ at Confederation College (1-807-475-6460) will honour both his military and civilian careers.\n\nArrangements entrusted to GILCHRIST CHAPEL – McIntyre & Wilkie Funeral Home, One Delhi Street, Guelph, (519-824-0031). Barry was born and raised in Guelph, Ontario. He was an RMC graduate of the Class of 54 in Civil Engineering. Commissioned in the Royal Canadian Engineers, his very first posting took him to Korea as part of Canada's contribution of peacekeepers after the armistice had been signed by the belligerents the previous year.\n\nHe returned safely to Canada, completed his BSc at Queens University before being posted to the RCE School of Military Engineering in Chilliwack, BC. Always interested in aviation, Barry obtained his private pilot's licence while there and indulged his passion by purchasing a Luscombe 8F aircraft.\n\nHe managed to convince his RCE masters and completed his Army pilots' training at the Brandon Flying Club and Rivers, Manitoba, graduating on LAPC Course 23 in Aug 58. Then in 1960, Captain Blair received his helicopter qualification with the US Army at Camp Wolters, Texas and Fort Rucker, Alabama.\n\nThere being no flying positions available on his return to Canada, he was posted to Montreal and a Works detachment. While there, he kept up his fixed wing continuation flying in a rented Beech V-tail Bonanza and also occasionally acted as the personal pilot of General Rockingham, GOC of Quebec Command.\n\nBarry next returned to B.C. as the Adjutant of the School in Chilliwack. He managed to maintain proficiency on continuation flying and instructing at the Chilliwack Flying Club. In 1963-65 he attended the two-year staff college course in Kingston and still managed to find the time to obtain a multi-engine rating and did some moon light charters for the Kingston Flying Club. After Kingston, Major Blair was posted to Gagetown to command the RCE's 2 Field Squadron. 1 AOP Troop allowed him occasional access to their L-19 aircraft.\n\nHe separated from the Army in January 66 and joined the Federal Department of Transport. He began his 10 years in the Civil Service as a construction engineer and ended as Director General Air Navigation Systems. As Deputy Director General, Civil Aeronautics from 1979 to 1983 his responsibilities included airport standards and regulations, air carrier standards and certification, pilot training and licensing, airworthiness, including construction and maintenance, aviation medicine, accident investigation and the operation of 100 fixed and rotary wing aircraft fleet.\n\nAs Director General Air Navigation Systems, Transport Canada 83-89, Barry managed the vast and complex Canadian Air Navigation System, one of the world's largest. The organization consisted of 6000 employees, including air traffic controllers, flight service specialists, pilots, electronics engineers, technicians and others. DOT (and later Transport Canada) insisted Blair maintain a current Airline Transport Rating, allowing him to continue flying the Department's Jet Rangers and other aircraft, including their Bombardier 601 Challenger jet.\n\nPrior to leaving Transport Canada, Blair was tasked by the Minister of Transport to study the Air Navigation System which was in need of considerable new financing to upgrade their facilities. Barry recommended to take the ANS out of the Department and form a not-for-profit corporation. The government of the day agreed and Nav Canada was eventually born 1 Nov 96.\n\nIn 1989 he established his own firm, Blair Consulting Services, Inc. specializing in aviation consulting services. His work involved both national and international assignments for governments and industry in the fields of air navigation systems, airports, civil aviation regulations, organizational issues, training and marketing of aviation related products. For his tireless efforts, he received an International Civil Aviation Organization Director's Award of Achievement \"for his outstanding work to improve the safety and efficiency of international civil aviation\". Also in 1990, the Board of Directors of National Transportation Week presented him with the National Award of Achievement for \"innovative initiatives which have brought about significant and lasting benefits to transportation in Canada\".\n\nMajor Barry Douglas Blair passed away 3 Aug 21 at the Perley and Rideau Veterans' Health Centre in Ottawa. A private burial service and celebration of his life will take place with the immediate family at a later date. A full obituary was published in the Ottawa Citizen 14 Aug 2021. Wayne was born in Montreal and received his first taste of the military in The Black Watch Cadet Corps, and then in the Canadian Grenadier Guards (Militia). After completing High School in 1960, he enrolled in the Canadian Army (Regular) and successfully completed the Officer Candidate Programme at the the Royal Canadian School of Infantry at Camp Borden, ON. Commissioned as a 2Lt in The Canadian Guards, his first field posting was with their 2nd Battalion at Camp Petawawa in 1961. Subsequently, he was attached posted to The Guards’ 1st Battalion in Soest, Germany in October 1962 as augmentation for the ‘Cuban Crisis’. Wayne stayed with the 1st Battalion as they were on a normal rotation back to Canada in December of that year. He spent a year with them in Camp Picton as a platoon commander.\n\nIn early 1964, Lt Brocklehurst successfully completed the RCAF aircrew selection process and joined 5 other Army officers for ab initio flying training on the Chipmunk aircraft at RCAF Station Centralia, ON. In the spring, his course (now down to 4 candidates) proceeded to Rivers, Manitoba for their Army Pilot training on L-19 and L182 aircraft at the Army Aviation Tactical Training School (AATTS) at the Canadian Joint Air Training Centre (CJATC). Wayne successfully completed the Light Aircraft Pilot Course (LAPC #38) and was awarded the coveted Army Aviation Flying Badge 21 Aug 64. By Christmas of that year, he completed his Rotary Wing training at the Basic Helicopter Training Unit, also situated at Rivers.\n\nFor the next 5 years, Captain Brocklehurst had a hectic and varied flying career. Immediately after his helicopter training, he completed the Fixed Wing Instructors Course on the L-19 in Jan 65 and started instructing students (including Joe Oakley on LAPC 41). During that summer he flew a few months for the Army HQ Training and Liaison Flight at Uplands, ON piloting their L182s. During the fall and winter, he was back instructing at Rivers until spending 4 months at 3 FTS at RCAF Station Portage la Prairie to undertake the Multi-engine Conversion and Instrument Rating Course. Wayne remained at Rivers until Jun 67 doing periodic instructing and liaison-type missions including spending the summer of 66 towing gliders at the Regional Air Cadet Glider School at Red Deer, AB. Somehow, he managed to find time while stationed at Rivers to qualify as a parachutist.\n\nJun 67 saw Wayne being posted to Winnipeg and the Air Navigation School where he flew the C-47 Dakotas for one year. In Aug 68 he reported to St Hubert, QC, qualified on the CC-115 Buffalo aircraft at the OTU and was posted to 429 Tactical Transport Squadron, until ending his ‘flying days’ at St Hubert by Christmas 1969.\n\nUpon integration of the Forces 1968-69, Wayne opted to remain an infantryman rather than accept the 32A Pilot classification. From St Hubert, Wayne returned to the 2nd Battalion, The Canadian Guards at Petawawa. Prior to the Battalion being reduced to nil strength, in the summer of 1970 Wayne was instrumental in the organization of the final ceremonies. He carried the Queen’s Colours during their last Trooping the Colour Ceremony on Parliament Hill and deposited those Colours in Government House.\n\nOvernight The Guards Battalion became the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment with Wayne as the adjutant. He next was seconded to the United Nations in New York for a period before becoming a Company Commander with the 3rd Mechanized Commando in Baden, Germany circa 1973-75. From there, he was privileged to attend the 46- week Australia Command and Staff College course conducted at the Australian Defence College, Weston Campus in suburban Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nIn 1979 Wayne was at the Directorate Land Requirements at NDHQ covering a NATO weapons desk. Concurrently he was commanding the “Changing the Guard” tasking. He reorganized the previous ‘public duties detachment’ to become the Ceremonial Guard that exists today. By the summer of 81, he had organized, recruited and equipped the Ceremonial Guards’ Band. He only managed to appreciate his final creation for a few short weeks before being promoted to Lt Col and posted to Gagetown as the Base Administrative Officer. Wayne’s final assignment was back in Petawawa as the Deputy Commanding Officer of the Canadian Airborne Regiment.\n\nLt Col Brocklehurst retired from the Forces in 1985 and became a director with Emergency Planning and Preparedness Canada until 2009. In his 69th year, he passed away at his home in Toronto following a challenging struggle with cancer. His ashes are interred at the Mount Pleasant Cemetery.\n\nBuchanan, William Kent (Buck) Major – It is with deepest regret that The Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery announces the passing of Buck Buchanan on 13 September 07 at the age of 92 in Ottawa, ON. He served with the Royal Canadian Artillery during World War II with 1st Medium Regiment in Italy and the 664th Air Observation Post Squadron Royal Canadian Artillery in NW Europe. After World War II he was posted to Royal Canadian Artillery School in Shilo.\n\nBUCHANAN, William Kent (Buck) Major EM CD Royal Canadian Artillery Passed away after a courageous four-month battle, with his devoted Nan by his side, at Salvation Army Grace Manor in Ottawa, on Thursday, September 13, 2007 age 92 years. Buck graduated in Physics from University of Toronto in 1936 and by 1939 had enlisted in the Royal Canadian Artillery to serve in WWII with the 1st Medium Regiment in Italy and the 664th Air O.P.

After the War he pursued a career in the Army, teaching on both sides of the pond at the Khaki University in the UK and later at The Royal Canadian School of Artillery in Shilo after he had graduated from The Military College of Science, Shrivenham, UK. (1950). He returned to M.C.S. to complete the Guided Missile Course (1957) and later was seconded to the Defence Research Board. After retiring from the Army in 1964 he enjoyed a second career working until 1986 as a Systems Engineer with Computing Devices & General Dynamics Canada. He then found time to tinker and travel and visit his wandering offspring in Western Canada, USA and Australia. He is survived by his \"manager\" and beloved wife of 64 years, Nan, two sons Alan (Mary), and Bob (Helen), and three daughters Betty-Ann (Dan), Sue (Rusty) and Sheila (Joe). Predeceased by his son Jim. He leaves behind seven much-loved grandchildren, two great grands and many cherished nieces and nephews. Buck, with his dry wit and understated competence, will be missed not only by his immediate and extended family but also by an army of good old friends with whom he shared life's trials and joys. Many thanks to the Salvation Army Grace Manor and the staff who cared for him in the last few months. Rest, old soldier, your life's work is done. Harry Stephen was born in Delisle, Saskatchewan. Having a spirit of adventure, he joined the Canadian Army 12 April 1945 and was posted to Vernon, British Columbia to become part of the Pacific Force. The Second World War ended before he was posted overseas and he elected to remain in the Permanent Force. He was assigned to the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in Shilo, Manitoba in January 1946 and was promoted to Corporal in 1947. He was posted to Currie Barracks in Calgary in 1947 and made Company Orderly Sergeant. When the\n\nRegiment went Airborne in 1948, Corporal Chatry was chosen for Glider pilot training and was sent to the Royal Canadian Air Force School of Aviation Medicine in Toronto and then to Rivers, Manitoba for flight training. He graduated from the #1 Glider Pilot's Course in 1949 and returned to Rivers to join Glider Flight and instruct other pilots. Promoted to Sergeant in the early 50s, he closed Glider Flight in 1955 and returned to Calgary where he was appointed Acting Company Quartermaster of A Company, Second Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Promoted to Staff Sergeant in 1956 Chatry was posted to Camp Borden as Small Arms Instructor. Posted back to the Second Battalion in 1964 he joined Reconnaissance Platoon and after a jump injury was attached to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment for almost a year. Returning to the Regiment in 1965 Warrant Officer Chatry was posted to the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade in Germany as Brigade Sergeant Major. Later that same year he was transferred to the First Battalion and posted to Hemer, Germany where he was in charge of C Company and then Headquarters Company. When the First Battalion rotated back to Canada, Warrant Officer Chatry stayed in Germany with the Second Battalion, later returning to the First Battalion now stationed at Currie Barracks, Calgary, Alberta in 1968. After working at Regimental Headquarters for a year, Harry Chatry retired from the military in 1969.\n\nUpon his retirement, he and his wife Hope settled in Chilliwack, BC. Together they created a new and successful work chapter as a real estate duo, known as the ‘Team’. They also owned several successful Chilliwack businesses.\n\nThereafter, he and Hope took up singing with the Heritage Singers, bringing joy to many retirement homes in the region.\n\nHarry passed away peacefully in his sleep on April 23, 2018. He is survived by his son Gordon (wife Pamela), daughter Leslie (husband Ken), many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister Velma Leys (husband Martin).\n\nHarry was predeceased by his wife Hope and his daughter Sharron. The family expresses sincere gratitude to Laara Kayler for her care for Harry. Bill was born in Santa Maria California on 28 June 1937. Shortly thereafter he moved to Canada with his parents and grew up in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. On completing high school, he was accepted at Royal Roads Military College in Victoria. After completing two years he was transferred to the Royal Military College in Kingston Ontario. He graduated with a degree in Commerce and Economics in 1960 and was commissioned into the Canadian Armoured Corps.\n\nBill’s military career spans some 22 years in the Canadian Regular Forces and another 11 years in the Reserve Forces culminating in his command of the 1st Hussars Armoured Regiment in London Ontario and finally command of London Militia District as a Colonel. He had seen service in Europe, Cyprus and the USA before leaving the regular forces in 1980 to join Diesel Division General Motors of Canada Ltd. As Sales Manager for the USMC Light Assault Vehicle (LAV) project, Bill directed the strategy and sale for GM. Upon this success, he took over management of Defence Sales for the Division, a position he retained for 12 years.\n\nAs Sales Director Bill was directly involved in overseas sales in Saudi Arabia, Australia, and New Zealand as well as starting sales activities in several other countries such as Taiwan and Thailand. In addition much of GM’s success in Canada and the USA can be attributed to his sales strategies.\n\nIn 1992 Bill was posted to Saudi Arabia as General Manager of the Branch of GM of Canada and remained as director for International Sales. He remained in this capacity until his retirement from GM in 1998.\n\nOn retirement from GM, Bill started his own consulting firm and has been contracted to such companies as British Aerospace and Alvis PLC as well as a firm in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBill has been an active supporter of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps Association (Cavalry) since his retirement from the Regular Force in 1980. He has served the association as Vice President Central, President, Past President and was serving on the Executive as Advisor on Council.\n\nBill is survived by Heather Ann (nee Hately) and his sons, Stuart, Doug and Jay and six grandchildren. Doug and Jay are serving officers in the Canadian Armed Forces. Bill and Heather Ann live in Florida but spend their summers at their cottage near Kingston Ontario.\n\nDouglas Hawley Clark was born and raised in Ontario. At the tender age of 14 he joined the 33rd Medium Regiment in Cobourg, ON. Enjoying his time in uniform, he enrolled in the Regular Force at 20 years of age. He received his junior officer’s training at the Royal Canadian School of Artillery and was commissioned as a 2Lt in the RCA. He remained at Shilo learning the gunner trade and doing some instructing until Nov 53 when he joined 3 RCHA in Petawawa as a gun position officer. In 1954 2Lt Clark served in Korea as part of the peace keeping and monitoring force. He returned to Canada with 4 RCHA to Debert, NS.\n\nHis stay in the Maritimes was short lived as Knobby was selected for flying training, beginning in May 55 at the Brandon Flying Club in Manitoba. He successfully completed the ab initio phase and proceeded up the road to the Light Aircraft School at the Canadian Joint Air Training Centre in Rivers. He graduated with Course #15 on 24 Nov 55. November and December were two eventful months in the young officer’s life. He married 12 Nov, received his Wings 24 Nov, promoted Lt on 3 Dec and was posted to 2 Air OP Flight RCA in Shilo, Manitoba.\n\nHe remained with 2 Air OP Flight until the summer of 58 flying Austers in support of the RCSA, Shilo and the RCHA Regiment in Winnipeg. While still with 2 Air OP, Knobby received his helicopter transition in Fort Rucker, Alabama during the fall of 57, returning to Shilo in Feb 58.\n\nAt the end of that summer, Lt Clark did a month long on-job training at Winnipeg to be a public relations officer. He went on to graduate from the US Army PR School in Fort Slocum, NY before being posted to the Brigade in Germany. During this ground tour, he managed some continuation flying with the Brits and their Austers of 652 Sqn in Detmold, Germany.\n\nAs a Captain, Knobby was posted back to 2 RCHA in Winnipeg in the summer of 1960 and remained on regimental duties until February 1963. While in Winnipeg he managed to do his continuation flying at the Winnipeg Flying Club. From 2 RCHA, he was posted back to Shilo with 3 Air OP Troop. After the busy concentration exercises of 64, Captain Clark did a 6- month United Nations tour of duty in Cyprus, again managing to keep up his flying currency in Beirut.\n\nA few months after returning to Canada and the Shilo Air OP Flight in the Spring of 65, Knobby joined five other Army pilots at the RCAF Training Command HQ in Winnipeg as the winds of integration began to blow. The following year and promotion to Major, Clark moved again, this time to Petawawa to command 4 Air OP Troop from Aug 66 until Jul 67. The “best years of my army career” came to an abrupt end when he was select to attend the US Marine Staff College in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nUpon his return to Canada and a public relations position in Ottawa, Major Clark declined an offer of a helicopter posting to Gagetown, NB to provide stability for his growing children. He remained in Ottawa and the Public Relations field until retiring in 1978.\n\nHe and Barbara moved to Kingston, ON where Knobby worked for the St. Lawrence Parks Commission as the general manager of Old Fort Henry for 10 years. He was a volunteer at Fairfield House in Amherstview, serving on the executive and as a tour guide. He also became a 30-year member of the Garrison Golf and Curling Club.\n\nMajor Clark died peacefully, just shy of his 90th birthday. He was predeceased by his partner Barbara Mackay Macfarlane and leaves to mourn sons Robert, Richard and Steven and daughter Heather. As per his wishes, a private family service and internment has taken place.\n\nA full obituary was published in the Kingston Whig Standard Saturday, 28 Aug 21.\n\nMajor Clark’s ‘Air OP Reminiscences’ can be found in the Artillery section of our website. Lauriston \"Butch\" H. Colwell began his Regular Force military career as a Sapper in the Royal Canadian Engineers, achieving the rank of Corporal before commencing officer training in Sep 60 through the Officer Candidate Programme (OCP). He trained at the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps School (RCAC(S)) at Camp Borden ON, graduating from Phase One of the Course in Dec 60 as the top student. He was commissioned in due course as a 2Lt in the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) (8CH) Regiment after completing nine months of Armour training. In late 63 he was selected for Army Pilot training and commenced flying in early Jan 64 on Chipmunks at RCAF Station Centralia ON, successfully completing said training in May 64. From Centralia he proceeded to the Army Aviation Tactical Training School (AATTS) at CJATC, Rivers MB for advanced fixed-wing training on the Cessna L-19 Bird Dog commencing mid-May 64 and graduating in Aug 64 with the award of the coveted Canadian Army Flying Badge. He then underwent basic helicopter flying training at the Basic Helicopter Training Unit (BHTU) in Rivers, graduating as a qualified basic Rotary Wing (RW) pilot in Dec 64. It was back to AATTS once again end-Mar 65 for the two month RW Tactical Course after which, as a now fully qualified tactical helicopter pilot, Butch joined the Helicopter Troop of the 8CH Recce Sqn in 4 CIBG at Fort Chambly West Germany for a three year stint of duty. No finer attestation to his flying ability than glowing comments from some of his fellow recce pilots such as: \"he was an excellent recce pilot because he had the remarkable skill to put himself into the right place and at the right time\" and (this in addition from a legendary and accomplished fellow recce pilot and tactical RW instructor) \"he was a very competent individual and one of the smoothest helicopter pilots I have ever flown with\" could be given.\n\nIt is known that Butch did a subsequent tour of duty with 403 (HOT) Sqn in CFB Gagetown NB commencing in 1972, lasting in all likelihood, for three years. Butch retired from the Canadian Military to become an employee of Transport Canada in the Flight Safety field, in which he reportedly became a true expert. It was during a briefing he was giving on that very subject in Winnipeg 30 Oct 86 that he experienced a fatal heart attack that ended his short life at the young age of 50, leaving his wife Betty, family and so many friends and acquaintances to mourn. May he forever rest in peace knowing that he will not soon be forgotten by anyone who ever had the privilege of knowing and serving with this fine officer and gentleman.\n\nOn Thursday, April 2, 2020, at the age of 82, Vic took his leave for blue skies and fair winds, a victim of Covid 19. He will be deeply missed by Patricia, his wife, best friend, travelmate and partner in so many things. Life will never be the same without him. He will be lovingly remembered by his daughters Lee-Anne (Chuck) and Liese as well as his stepson Ian (Becca) and stepdaughter Krista (Jeff). His grandsons Bob, Benjamin and Jacob will have fond memories of time spent with him. Predeceased by his brother Richard (Ingrid) he leaves behind his sister Jean (Jack), and brothers Reginald (Paulette), Frank (Simonne), Gary (Dona) and many nieces and nephews.\n\nVic and Pat had been in Africa on safari when the virus struck with a vengeance. They made their way back to Ottawa by the skin of their teeth before the borders began closing around them. In voluntary isolation, his health deteriorated by the day and by the tenth day he went to hospital and passed away two days later.\n\nVic had a full, exciting and successful life, serving Canada for 39 years in the Royal Canadian Artillery. Not only did his service take him right across Canada but he spent time in Germany, Italy, the UK, the USA, Norway, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand. He enjoyed all the postings, all the challenges that he faced but his favourite by far was his time as an Air Observation Post Pilot.\n\nUpon retiring Vic maintained his military affiliation, actively involved with the Conference of Defence Associations, the Canadian NATO Defence College Association, the North Atlantic Council, RUSI Vancouver, Air OP Pilots Association and the Ottawa Gunners. He made his mark in so many projects but one, most important to him was the Honour House in New Westminster, BC. His vision and drive provided the impetus to get it off the ground. More recently, his efforts and involvement in launching the Canadian Army Aviation website gave him much satisfaction.\n\nOn a personal level Vic was loved and admired by friends and family, old and new. He enjoyed being out on the golf course, would never refuse a chance to go flying, was a somewhat unique bridge player, loved a fine meal with his favourite folks, was an enthusiastic traveller and truly appreciated a single malt scotch. With that – raise a glass to Vic!\n\nThe family would like to thank the doctors and nurses in the ACE Unit of Queensway Carleton who treated him with such care and respect right up to the end. It is hoped that a Celebration of Life can be held at a later date, arrangements to be made at Beechwood Cemetery.\n\nStan was born in southern Saskatchewan. Fleeing the dustbowl region of 1930-31, the family moved briefly to Bowden and Olds in Alberta and Grand Forks and Rutland, BC, before settling in Stettler Alberta.\n\nThe local armory in Stettler was home to B Squadron, King’s Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC). In 1947 at the age of 18, Stan joined the unit as a Trooper. During his four years of parading and training with them, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant. In early 1951 Stan joined the Regular Force with the Lord Strathcona’s Horse (RC) and once again started as a Trooper but advanced quickly to a senior NCO position.\n\nIn April 53 Sgt Cote sailed to Japan and served in Korea as a Tank Liaison Officer and managed 2 troops of Sherman tanks. The Regiment served a year in theater until the Truce ended the conflict. The Strath’s returned to Calgary where Stan would spend four years with them, including a period during 1955-56 when he completed officer training and was commissioned as a Lieutenant, subsequently attended short leadership courses at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nIn 1958 Lt Cote joined the Army’s No. 1 Ground Liaison Group at HMCS Shearwater, Nova Scotia. The following year he was posted aboard HMCS Bonaventure as a Carrier Borne Ground Liaison Officer. He thoroughly enjoyed his nearly four years with the Senior Service, for months at a time, serving aboard the destroyers HMCS Iroquois, Micmac, Sioux and Nootka plus HMCS Cape Scott (a naval maintenance vessel). This period included a number of cruises to Bermuda, the US east coast and into the Caribbean.\n\nIn Sep 61 he was posted back to the Lord Srathcona’s, serving in numerous regimental roles as 2IC C Squadron, Regimental Transport Officer and Battle Capitan. One year later, Stan was promoted Capitan and began his Army aviator training at RCAF Station Centralia, Ontario and at Rivers, Manitoba. In 1963 he had completed his training and was qualified on the Cessna L-19, Hiller CH-112 and Piper PA-28 and PA-22 light aircraft.\n\nWhen Capt Cote completed his tactical helicopter training in Sep 63, he was posted in May 64 to the Fort Garry Horse Recce Squadron in Soest, Germany. The six Hiller CH-112s of the Helicopter Troop were relatively new to the Brigade with challenging flying in a multitude of roles, often in very marginal weather. Stan enjoyed his tour in Northwest Europe and returned to Canada in late 1967.\n\nThe late 60s and early 70s saw the major expansion of the Forces’ rotary wing fleet with the purchases of the CH-118s, CH-136s and the CH-135s. Capt Cote was ideally qualified for this introductory period, serving multiple roles as a new squadron’s Operations Officer, Base Duty Officer, Chief Test Pilot and, on one occasion, acting Commanding Officer.\n\nIn Feb 77, Stan was finally pried from the cockpit and reported to NDHQ in the Directorate of Individual Training. During this supposed ‘desk job’ Capt Cote managed to maintain his flying currency by assisting 450 Sqn operations when they were short of crews. During this period, helicopter emergency landing pads at several Ottawa area hospitals were designed in-part or in-whole by Stan.\n\nThe very competent and well-respected Capt Cote left the CF in May 85 after 38 years of Service. In Feb 86 he went on to spend eight years consulting with the firm ADGA working on the ongoing maintenance and modifications of the CF-18 aircraft fleet. In Jul 94, Stan finally retired from a lifetime of service to all branches of the military, a combined military and civilian service of 46 years.\n\nStan and family retired in the Ottawa area. He passed away at the Civic Hospital 26 Apr 23 after many years battling prostate cancer. He was 93 at his time of passing. He requested that there not be any service held nor obituary published.\n\nStan will be very greatly missed by everyone who had the privilege of knowing and especially serving with this remarkably friendly, competent officer and gentleman. May he now rest in peace.\n\nBASH ON, BASH ON, THE ROYAL CANADIAN ARMOURED CORPS\n\nJohn Clinton was born in Calgary in 1923 to an American father and a Scottish born mother. He began his military career in the latter stages of WWII in the RCAF taking flying training. Immediately post war he continued his education, earning a Bachelor of Physical Education from Carleton University in Ottawa and was the school’s athlete of the year 1948. While there he also served on the student’s council as the athletics representative. Later, and while still serving in the military, Cowen returned to his Alma Mater and obtained a BA in Journalism. It was also in Ottawa that Clint met and married Margaret Mary McGoey 24 Dec 1948.\n\nIn the following year it appears he completed officers training at Camp Borden, commissioned as a Lt in the Lord Strathcona's Horse and was posted to their home station in Calgary. Probably due to his RCAF background, Clint was selected for the Light Aircraft Pilots course #3. The ab initio training was conducted at the Brandon Flying Club Jul through Nov 51 and the army aviation phase at the Light Aircraft School in Rivers, Manitoba mid Nov to early Mar 52.\n\nBarely home one month from his flying training, Lt Cowen joined the Regiment's B Squadron for their year long deployment to Korea 52-53. In 1954 he embarked upon a one year assignment at the Royal Armoured Corps Centre at Bovington Camp, Wareham, Dorset. Margaret and their three children accompanied Clint to the UK.\n\nBack in Canada at the home station in Calgary, Clint resumed regimental duties as a Captain. It was during this period that Cowen deployed to Nevada with other troops of the Strathcona’s and QOR of C to partake in the infamous Desert Rock Nuclear Tests in Nevada.\n\nIn 1959 he attended the Australian Army’s Command and Staff College course conducted at Fort Queenscliff, Victoria. He and Margaret returned to Calgary in 1960 as Clint became the editor of the Regimental newsletter ‘The Strathconian’ for a year.\n\nIn 1961 he was a member of the newly reorganized Recce Sqn during their year-long deployment on UN Duties in Egypt. On his return to Canada in 62, he was posted to Ottawa at Army Headquarters serving the GS Branch in the Directorate in the Directorate of Military Training. Promoted to Major in the fall of 62, Clint remained at AHQ until mid-65 when he and family once again crossed the Atlantic where Clint was to serve two years at the UK War Office in London.\n\nThe family once again established in Ottawa and Maj Cowen did a peacekeeping tour in Cyprus before returning to the new CFHQ in the Directorate of Reserves. In 1968-69 he was with the NSAWS in Carp, Ontario. He terminated his military career back at CFHQ at their Command Post in the mid-1970s.\n\nOnce out of uniform, Clint and Margaret went off to Finland, purchased a new 32 foot motor-sailer and spent 2 years sailing around Europe. He returned to Ottawa with the boat via South America, the Caribbean and the Great Lakes. He then resumed his working life as a civilian assistant editor for various DND publications.\n\nMajor JC Cowen served in the Air Force, joined the Army and was ‘Captain’ in his own Navy living a fascinating, but all too short life. He passed away in Ottawa at 58 years old. Many believed his cancer was directly related to his exposure to the Nevada nuclear tests. He was survived by his wife Margaret, sons Bruce and Stuart and daughter Lorraine. In 1941 Ted enlisted in the Canadian Active Service Force at 18 years old. He would have seen service in NW Europe and remained on active duty at the end of hostilities. By 1948-49 he was Commissioned from the Ranks as a Lt. in the RCASC. The above data has not been verified.\n\nIn 1951 he was assigned to the Corps Training Company of the RCASC School. The following year he was promoted Captain and joined 54 Tpt Coy on their return to Borden from Korea. Ted became the unit’s 2 I/C and then Composite Platoon Commander preparing the Company for the upcoming move to the CIBG in Germany. By the fall of 53 the unit replaced 55 Tpt Coy and was well established in the Soest area and renumbered as 2 Tpt Coy, RCASC.\n\nCaptain Crosbie returned to Canada at the end of 1954 (probably to attend Army Staff College). Selected for pilot training to enhance RCASC presence in army aviation, he completed LAPC 22 in May 1958.\n\nHe joined the second group of officers to take Hiller training at Camp Walters, Texas. From there, they proceeded to Fort Rucker, Alabama for H-34 and H-37 qualifications. He completed his two year tour with the US Army, along with other RCASC pilots, at Fort Knox, Kentucky flying the H-34s with the 64th Transportation Corps Helicopter Company.\n\nCaptain Crosbie returned to Camp Borden, was promoted Major, and then went off to serve with the Canadian Base Units Middle East during the period 1962-63. Directly from Egypt, Ted was posted to the North West Highway System in Whitehorse, Yukon to command 19 Coy RCASC. Abruptly in 1964 the Government decided to turn over the military’s maintenance of the Alaska Highway to the Federal Department of Public Works. Major Crosbie was the military’s overall chairman of the smooth handover process and received accolades from the Ottawa HQs of both departments.\n\nFrom Integration onward, Ted served in Ottawa at NDHQ’s Directorate of Equipment Requirements-Air. As a LtCol he steered the initial Light Observation Helicopter procurement team.\n\nHe retired around 1972 to the Manotick area and later moved to London, Ontario where he passed away peacefully at London Health Sciences Centre, Westminster Campus on Saturday September 6, 2003 in his 81st year. Beloved husband of Marjorie Crosbie of London. Dear father of Deb Wilkins (Bob) of Port Stanley, Colleen Crosbie of Montreal, Roger Crosbie (Colleen) of Oakville, David Wiggins (Mary Main) of Morriston and Kate Wiggins (Roma Harris) of London. Grandfather of 7 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. ZM198 LtCol REM (Bob) Cross PPCLI was born in Humboldt SK 11 Oct 18. He took his Last Flight in Delta BC 3 Oct 93 at the age of 74 and is interred with his wife Betty (Woodruff), whom he married in England 12 Jun 43, in Lot 79 of Block 103 at the Boundary Bay Cemetery in Tsawwassen BC. Research has determined that Bob enlisted as a Pte in the Calgary Highlanders (rising to the rank and appointment of Acting Platoon Sergeant-Major) and later transferred to the Vancouver Highlanders. As a Lt, he arrived Overseas 25 Dec 1941 where he was wounded in Italy. Reportedly he was a CANLOAN officer for most of WWII and later with the Canadian Pacific Force 1944-45. Following the War he served at the Royal Canadian School of Infantry in Camp Borden ON, rising to the rank of Capt, after which he was posted to CJATC Rivers MB 26 Oct 50 in the rank of Maj. He was also awarded the Canadian Efficiency Medal in Dec 47. Bob fought in the Korean War where he commanded C Company 1 PPCLI. He was awarded the CD as a PPCLI Major in Jul 58. Subsequently, he attended the Canadian Army Staff College after which he served in numerous appointments in Army HQ Ottawa (Military Training, Joint Warfare), the last being in the Directorate of Land/Air Warfare in Sep 60. As a LtCol he was posted once again to CJATC Rivers MB in 1961 where he assumed the appointment of Officer Commanding Ground Training Wing (OC GTW), until 1965. Where he went from Rivers and also when he retired are unknown at this time.\n\nNote authored by the Co-ordinator of the Editorial Board: Exhaustive research to date has failed to turn-up any factual information on how and where LtCol Bob Cross qualified for and was subsequently awarded the Canadian Army Flying Badge. What is known is that in Edition 23 of the Canadian Army (Regular) List dated 31 Mar 60, Maj Cross does not have the PL qualification; but, in Edition 24 dated 30 Sep 60, he does: ergo, he must have qualified during the period 1 Apr-30 Sep 60. During this period, Maj Cross was serving in AHQ Ottawa in the Directorate of Land/Air Warfare (DL/AW). As he does not show-up on any regular Light Aircraft Pilot Course being conducted at CJATC Rivers MB during the period in question (nor does anyone that the author has spoken to that was there at the time remember him being there), it is probable that he underwent a Senior Officers' Pilot Flying Course (SOC) whilst serving on Staff in Ottawa, in preparation for his promotion the following year (12 Nov 61) and subsequent posting to CJATC as the Officer Commanding Ground Training Wing (0C GTW) in 1961. The author's thinking is that it would be entirely appropriate for an officer filling that position at CJATC to be either a qualified Parachutist or Canadian Army Pilot, both of which Cross now was.\n\nWhile the foregoing may not prove anything definitively, until further information is forthcoming to dispel or dispute the above hypothesis, it will be assumed that Lt Col Cross qualified for his Army Pilot Wings on an SOC conducted in OW during the Apr-Sep 60 timeframe. It is with a heavy heart that we share that LGen Louis Cuppens passed away suddenly on December 16, 2022 while in Florida.\n\nLouis was born in Nijmegen in the Netherlands during World War II.

Hoping for aircrew training when called-up at the age of 17, he found himself instead in the Army in Ireland. Volunteering for para-training, he ended up with the Parachute Regiment. But shortly after the heavy losses during Operation Market Garden, Fred applied to become a glider pilot. During the next two years he undertook elementary flying training plus basic and heavy glider courses at six different flying training schools throughout the UK. His next to last course in 1947 at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford included six British and five Canadian candidates (Grace, Nicolls, Beach, Bisset and Gunton).\n\nIn early spring of 1948, he and his mates were nearing the end of their military service. The Canadians, believing to be at the forefront of an expected Airborne Force, encouraged Fred and fellow Sgt, John Crewdson, to consider coming to the ‘New World’. These two sailed to Halifax and signed-up with the Canadian Army and were immediately assigned to the Joint Air School (later to become the Canadian Joint Air Training Centre 1 Ap 49) at Rivers Manitoba.\n\nA hectic year and a half of flying ensued, including sporadic powered flights on Tiger Moths, Chipmunks, Austers and occasionally as co-pilots of the tow aircraft. But the plans for a full-fledged glider unit were fading so Fred left Rivers and enlisted in the RCAF.\n\nSoon he was at 1 Flying Training School at RCAF Station Centralia, Ontario checking-out on Harvard and C-45 Expeditor aircraft. Fred’s course completed Gunnery School in Trenton, Ontario just as the Korean conflict erupted. His course was destined to become instructors and upon completion of his Flying Instructor upgrade, he went to RCAF Gimli, Manitoba to instruct on the Harvard. After nearly three years on the ‘yellow peril’, wheels were in motion for his transfer to Air Transport Command. His move to ATC was delayed when injured in a traffic mishap, but in the hospital, Fred met and later married his young RN, Elaine Campbell from PEI.\n\nIn the spring 1954 he completed his operational training on the C-47 Dakota and C-119 Boxcar and joined 435 Sqn in Namao, Alberta. His time with the squadron included a year in Keflavik, Iceland as Detachment Commander of the No.1 Overseas Ferry Unit. He returned to Canada to 436 Sqn which operated the C-119s from Dorval and then Downsview airports. The unit’s world-wide flying included supplying the northern radar sites and supporting United Nations in Egypt, supplying the Canadian troops from an airfield in Capodichino, Italy.\n\nIn 1960 Fred was fortunate to be one of the RCAF’s first Captains sent to Lockheed in Georgia USA to train on the new C-130 Hercules. In the ensuing 12 years the C-130s revolutionized air transport by supporting the North, UN Operations and world-wide emergency relief operations. A few postings interrupted his leadership and instructor’s role on Squadron; a 1961 stint at ATC HQ in Trenton, and a one-year command of the Hall Beach, DEW Line site Mar 66 to Mar 67.\n\nMajor Dimond retired from military life at the end of 1972 and immediately joined Transport Canada in Toronto as an inspector and later became their Regional Director General of Air Navigation Services.\n\nFrederick Bert Dimond served Transport Canada until June 1990. He passed away in Markham, Ontario in 2003 in his 78th year. He was survived by his wife Elaine, son Stephen and daughters Carole-Anne, Patty and Janet. Elaine passed away in 2021 and is interred alongside Fred in the New London Cemetery, Queens County, PEI. Major-General Doucet was born November 12, 1929, at Robertville, N.B.

Harvey Charles Ellery was born in Ladysmith BC in Aug 1944, the youngest of the children in the family by many years. At the age of 17, being quite handy as a woodworker, he helped his father build the family home in Ladysmith.\n\nHarv’s taste for military life started at a relatively early age when he became a Sea Cadet. After Cadets he enrolled in the Reserves, joining The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary’s) in Victoria BC. He then joined the Canadian Army (Regular Force) in Jan 63 under the Officer Candidate Programme, undergoing officer training at the Royal Canadian School of Artillery (RCSA) in Shilo MB for one year after which he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. Harv served The Guns faithfully and expertly from 63 to almost the end of the decade during which time he served at the RCSA, 3 RCHA in Winnipeg and 1 RCHA in Hemer West Germany with 1 CIBG. He also found time to qualify as a Jumper during this period when he attended a Basic Parachutist Course in Jan 66. Later in his career, he completed a tour of duty with the UN in Cyprus. While serving as an Artillery Officer, he applied to become a Canadian Army pilot. As luck would have it he was eventually accepted for aircrew training and commenced ab initio flying training at Primary Flying School CFB Borden in the spring of 69, graduating in Jun 69. Subsequent flying training on the Tutor aircraft at CFB Gimli MB and a successful Cessna L-19 Bird Dog Conversion Course at 4 FTS in Rivers MB saw him graduate as a fully qualified Canadian Forces pilot and be awarded the coveted Canadian Army Flying Badge in Jun 70. After a short breather, he was off on another flying course, this one being the Air OP Section Commander’s Course at the RCSA in Shilo from Aug to Oct 70. After that it was back to work for a living! Flying tours thereafter saw him, amongst others, serving on 444 Tactical Helicopter Squadron in Lahr Germany and 408 Squadron in Edmonton.\n\nIn addition to the tours of duty and training mentioned in the above paragraph, Harv reportedly commanded the Junior Leader’s School while in Germany, instructed on helicopters at CFB Portage, flew as a test pilot on both fixed and rotary wing aircraft at Portage, commanded the Base Rescue Flight at CFB Moose Jaw SK and instructed at the Survival School at CFB Edmonton. He definitely was not idle during his Regular Force Service nor did he lack for a variety of employment!\n\nHe joined the Reserves after retirement from the Regular Force in which his substantive rank was Maj, and served as a member of the Reserves, reportedly, on a “call-out” basis. During this time of his Service he was promoted to the rank of LCol. Also, during this tenure he is reported to have commanded both the Air Cadet Camp at Whitehorse YK and the Cadet Camp at Dundurn SK.\n\nHarv was an explorer and outdoorsman at heart. On retirement from the Forces, he and his wife took up residence in Gibbons AB. LCol Harvey Charles Ellery passed-away in the spring 2022, in Gibbons, leaving behind to mourn his loving wife Claudette and two of his three daughters Christine-Anne and Kari-Anne. He was predeceased by Lianne his other daughter.\n\nHarv Ellery was a highly respected Gunner Officer and Forces Pilot. He will be greatly missed by all those who knew him, served with him and otherwise were lucky enough to call him a friend. May he rest in peace in the big hangar in the sky with all his mates who have preceded him.\n\nEnd of Mission\n\nStand Easy Lt Col David R Ely, 57 and retired army officer who was manager of the Boeing of Canada Vertol Division.

He entered the Active Force from the Non-Permanent Active Militia on September 1, 1939 and served in unique roles with the Canadian Army's Air Observation Posts as outlined in the citation for his appointment as a Member or the Order of the British Empire. He continued to serve with the Canadian Army after the war and reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He died on August 18, 1968.\n\nOct. 1939 Lieutenant 9th (Toronto) Field Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery, Aldershot\n\nOct. 1940 Captain 9th Battery, 2nd Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery Overseas\n\nMar. 1943 Major, subsequent training included a Royal Air Force course\n\nMar. 1943 1st Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, Canadian Army Overseas.\n\nMay 1944 B.

Rank of Lieutenant Colonel\n\nAug. 1962 Retired from the Canadian Army and joined Boeing Aircraft, Vertol Division, Morton, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.\n\nMember, Order of the British Empire\n\nMajor Ely entered the Active Force on 1 September 1939 from the Non-Permanent Active Militia. In 1942 he was one of three Canadian Officers to qualify as an Air Observation Post pilot and in 1943 he was returned to England to assist in the formation and training of three Canadian Air Observation Post squadrons being formed for First Canadian Army. He was appointed to command 664 Canadian Air Observation Post Squadron, and as pilots finished their initial training he organized the squadron and carried out its unit training. When this unit was fully trained, he was ordered to turn it over to a junior officer and make himself available to form and train 665 Canadian Air Observation Post Squadron. This he did, and was then called upon to form 666 Canadian Air Observation Post Squadron in a similar manner. The latter squadron he took to the theatre in May 1945 as Squadron Commander. His outstanding ability and his unflagging interest in the development of these squadrons, despite the fact that it probably would have been more to his advantage to have served in the field, where he had been recommended to command a field regiment, contributed in large measure to the rapid development of these units, which became available to 21 Army Group at a critical time, when fresh divisions were arriving from Italy and no other Air Observation Post squadrons were available. This officer has shown unstinted zeal, energy and efficiency in the performance of his duties, and is considered worthy of high recognition. Russell Joseph Everett was born in Lennoxville in Quebec’s Eastern Townships. He attended the local high school and then went on to study at the elite Bishop’s College School in his home town. He participated in the COTC program from 39 until 41, when young Everett joined the Active Service Force. He completed officer training in Petawawa before going overseas in 42 as a 2Lt with the 7th Canadian Medium Regiment, RCA.\n\nDuring Aug 44, while pushing inland from Normandy, Lt Everett earned the Military Cross for his gallant actions.

He was survived by his wife Fran, one son and two daughters.\n\n“On 12 Aug 44 Lt RJ Everett was acting as an AGRA representative with the Polish Armd Div on an armoured recce Southeast of ST SYLVAN. Communication difficulties necessitated taking his carrier along with the tanks. Due to this Lt Everett had to climb alternatively between the tank and the carrier in order to pass fire orders. In spite of this and the fact that they were under heavy shell and mortar fire he carried out his task to completion. Lt Everett by his actions showed courage and fortitude under most difficult circumstances. Throughout the campaign in North West Europe his officer has shown marked initiative and aggressiveness. He has shown himself to be an unusually capable officer and has made a contribution to the success of his unit over and above that which might normally be expected.” Signed H Crerar GOC-in-C First Cdn Army.

Gower, Gerald Freeman, passed away on 06 December 2011 in Lower Truro at the age of 78. Gerald always taught that it was important to leave a place better than you found it and practiced this throughout his life. His distinguished and exciting career in the military and especially the many loyal and lifelong friends he met during his career were enormously important to him. Gerald began his long military career as a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force. At the age of 19 Gerald became one of the first people to join the Mach Busters club (broke the speed of sound) in a Sabre jet in Grostenquin, France, while serving with the RCAF’s #2 Fighter wing. After transferring to the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery he continued his career as a pilot. Over the course of his career Gerald mastered the flight of Jets, helicopters, L-19 and other aircraft. By the time his military career ended he had logged more than 8500 hours in flight.\n\nMEMORIES OF GERALD GOWER RCA PLT - WRITTEN AND CONTRIBUTED BY LGEN LWF CUPPENS (RET’D) CMM, CD\n\nI had the privilege of calling Gerry Gower my friend during my 38 year career in the CF and thereafter. I recall well (I was a mere 2Lt in 1 RCHA) in the early 1960s when I first met him. He and his wife Ann made me welcome in their home and family—this was to last till his end of earthly life.\n\nHe was a known excellent Air OP pilot and I was just a Gun Position Officer (GPO). He stood out among the officers as dedicated, caring and a model to be emulated. Most of us subalterns sought his advice.\n\nIn 1964 I was transferred to 2 RCHA (Germany) and reported to the CO LtCol Chick Sills. 1 RCHA was to replace the 2nd Regiment in 1966. As I recall the Air OP Flt had pilots Adams, Whalen and Leggett at that time.\n\nIn 1966 and when 1 RCHA arrived in Germany, Gerry Gower was among the many who deployed there. He took me (passenger) flying on many occasions whether just local in the Deilinghofen area or to our deployment areas in Soltau, Munsterlager and Sennelager etc.\n\nBusy as a GPO and later A/RCPO, Gerry and I remained as friends.\n\nIn 1968 when I was chosen to be an “Army pilot”, Gerry flew me to Marville France so that I could take the Service Flight to Canada.\n\nUpon graduation as a pilot I was assigned to 2 RCHA Air OP Troop at Gagetown NB—Gerry was the OC of the Air OP Troop along with me and Lloyd McMorran. He carried out my indoctrination and declared me “fit to fly” just in time to be deployed to 5 RALC for the “October Crisis”. He even flew to Valcar"
