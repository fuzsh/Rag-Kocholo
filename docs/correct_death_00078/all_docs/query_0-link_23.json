    "text": "LCol Richard Blair “Dick” Rogers, OMM, CD passed away on Saturday, September 24, 2016 at the age of 77 years. Dick was born in Woodstock, NB on August 17, 1939. He joined the Royal Canadian Engineers in 1957 and trained in Chilliwack, BC before transferring to the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery where he was commissioned as an officer in 1960 in Shilo, MB. He served 37 years; 18 as a gunner and 19 as a pilot. The Funeral Service was held at York Funeral Home’s T. Gordon MacLeod Memorial Chapel on Wednesday, September 28, 2016 with interment in the Field of Honour at Forest Hill Cemetery.\n\n\n\nEulogy for LCol RB Rogers delivered by Lieutenant-General Lou Cuppens CMM, CD, RCA.\n\n“Today I proudly wear my medals and decorations, presented to me by the government of Canada and others, in honour of a veteran and friend, LCol Dick Rogers. You will note that I also wear a poppy in his honour and in remembrance of his service to Canada as a soldier and airman.\n\n\n\nLet me introduce myself, I am Lou Cuppens a retired LGen, smart enough to select NB as my place of retirement after 38 years of service as a soldier and airman.\n\n\n\nLCol Rogers’ wife Liz asked if I would say a few words about LCol Rogers’ military service at this ceremony of remembrance and I shall do so.\n\n\n\nAs I was preparing this address, I noted that there are similarities in Dick’s career and mine. We both became commissioned in the Royal Canadian Artillery, we both served in 1 RCHA in Germany and we both obtained our army flying badges at CFB Rivers, Manitoba. He served for 37 years and me for 38 years and as I look at Dick’s bio-sketch he was five years older than me and started and ended his career five years ahead of me.\n\n\n\nI first met Dick while undergoing officer training at CFB Shilo, Dick was at that base completing his promotion examinations. I encountered Dick again as I was completing my air observation pilot course at CFB Shilo. We used the aircraft that belonged to his Air OP Troop at Flewin Field, CFB Shilo.\n\n\n\nOur paths crossed again when he was posted to 422 squadron at CFB Gagetown in 1973. I was an instructor pilot in the sister squadron on the same base. Thereafter, Dick was transferred to Germany as a pilot with 444 Sqn and I encountered him on several occasions during HQ 10 Tactical Air Group inspections of that squadron.\n\n\n\nIn 1980 Dick was the deputy commanding officer of 403 Sqn when I was assigned there as commanding officer. We were a team that led Canada’s finest helicopter squadron for two years before he was transferred to Ottawa to a desk job and thereafter as deputy commander of 450 Transport Helicopter Squadron.\n\n\n\nOnce again Dick was transferred and this time to Montreal Quebec as a LCol and the senior staff officer operations and training at 10 Tactical Air Group headquarters. Yes, I arrived there one year later as a BGen and commander of 10 Tactical Air Group.\n\n\n\nBeing such an outstanding officer and pilot, I selected him to command our favourite squadron 403 Sqn at CFB Gagetown. He was decorated as an officer within the order of military merit, an award granted to only a few.\n\n\n\nHe excelled as a commanding officer and led the squadron through a myriad of challenges. The reward for such excellence was an assignment to NATO in Brunsum in the Netherlands for three years and then Dick retired and returned to his native New Brunswick.\n\n\n\nNot one to be idle, Dick immediately became involved in his community and in many projects in the area. He eventually became a counselor and did even more for the citizens of New Maryland.\n\n\n\nHaving briefly traced his military career, I wish to highlight several things about this veteran and great leader.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, those who had the privilege to know Dick will know well that he was the epitome of a true gentleman in every sense of the word. His gentlemanly spirit was seen in his leadership style and in every undertaking. With polished manners and the ‘sense of the right approach’ Dick easily won the respect and admiration of those with whom he served and his subordinates.\n\n\n\nDick was meticulously neat. His attire was always impressive and his penmanship was without equal. He was truly a role model for the young officers and airman under his guidance and leadership.\n\n\n\nDick was the consummate aviator. He loved to fly. He loved to instruct flying and he respected the domain of aviators.\n\n\n\nDick displayed the utmost respect for veterans. He just could not do enough to feature them and salute them for their sacrifices.\n\n\n\nI mentioned earlier, that I had the privilege of having Dick as my deputy commanding officer and what a privilege it was. He was totally in my confidence, his advice was sound and timely, and he was so very loyal. I treasure the years that we had together as partners, we were quite the team.\n\n\n\nDick was a christian man and proudly displayed it. When he and Liz decided to marry, he asked me to be his ‘best man’ and I did so with great joy and pride.\n\n\n\nTime does not allow me to speak of his drummer skills so you should ask family and others about his skill on the drums. He loved to play and did so for many years including at the Nova Scotia Tattoo.\n\n\n\nBefore my eyes become tearful and my speech shows my emotions, I will conclude with a few thoughts. Dick is now in a better place, he gave the cancer a good fight, and now he is at his final reward. We celebrate with much love and respect his self sacrificing service to Canada and know that he has left his mark on many of us here today. We will remember him always.\n\n\n\nSo as an artilleryman and aviator, I will close with this greeting, Dick, good shooting, end of mission, stand easy. Aerospace control, flight plan closed; now flying with the angels. Amen”\n\n\n\n"
