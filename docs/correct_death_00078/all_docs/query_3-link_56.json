        "text": "Memorable Manitobans: Hugh John Macdonald (1850-1929)\n\nHugh John Macdonald\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nLawyer, MP (1878-1882), MP (1891-1896), MP (1896-1897), Premier of Manitoba (1900), MLA (1900-1903), judge.\n\nHugh John Macdonald\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nBorn at Kingston, Ontario on 13 March 1850, the only surviving son of Sir John A. Macdonald and Isabella Clark, he was educated Queen’s College (Kingston) and the University of Toronto (BA 1869). He took part as a private in the Wolseley Expedition, against his father’s wishes, after which he studied law in his father’s office until 1872 when he was called to the Ontario Bar. He came to Winnipeg in 1882 and formed a law partnership with J. Stewart Tupper. He served as a Lieutenant and Captain in the 90th Battalion, Winnipeg Rifles during the 1885 North West Rebellion.\n\nHe was Conservative MP from Winnipeg from 1891 to 1893 and from 1896 to 1897, serving briefly as minister of the interior in the Tupper Cabinet of 1896. During this period he was closely connected with Lord and Lady Aberdeen. He was chosen to lead the Manitoba Conservatives in the 1899 provincial election, became MLA for Winnipeg South and Premier (also Attorney-General) at a January 1900 by-election. He served only briefly (8 January to 29 October), then contested the federal seat of Brandon against Clifford Sifton. When he lost, he retired to private life.\n\nHe was created a Knight Baronet in 1913. From 1911 to 1929 he sat as police magistrate for the City of Winnipeg, coming down hard on aliens and the strikers of 1919. Like many sons of distinguished fathers, he was often elevated to positions beyond his capabilities. Macdonald served as President of the Manitoba Club from 1896 to 1899 and the St. Andrew’s Society of Winnipeg from 1897 to 1898. He was a founding member, in 1905, of the St. Charles Country Club. He served on the first Advisory Board for the Winnipeg Foundation in 1921, and was a Bencher for the Law Society of Manitoba.\n\nHe died on 29 March 1929 and was buried in the St. John’s Cathedral Cemetery. He is commemorated by Hugh John Macdonald School and Macdonald Youth Services in Winnipeg. His former home at 61 Carlton Street is operated as Dalnavert Museum and Visitors’ Centre. There are papers at the Archives of Manitoba.\n\nMacdonald chronology:\n\nSee also:\n\nSources:\n\nWho’s Who in Western Canada: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Living Men and Women of Western Canada, Volume 1, edited by C.
