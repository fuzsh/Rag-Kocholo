        "text": "Tributes have been paid to well-known Sutherland author and historian John Macdonald of Little Rogart, who died yesterday.\n\nMr Macdonald’s family said he died “suddenly but peacefully” at Seaforth House, Golspie, on Sunday, December 17.\n\nMr Macdonald (87) spent nearly half a century collecting information about the parish of Rogart, its history, customs, culture and stories.\n\nIn 2019 he received an honorary fellowship from the University of the Highlands and Islands in recognition of his work in history, music and crofting politics.\n\nHe is the author of “The Empty Stalls: Shepherds and Sheep Farms of Sutherland” and “Looking Back from the Croft Gate”. He also used to write a very popular monthly column for the Am Bratach magazine.\n\nThe Rogart community hopes to establish a John Macdonald archive in the vestry of St Callan’s Church, should they succeed in acquiring the building from the Church of Scotland.\n\nRogart Heritage Society posted on social media: \"John was an inspirational founding member of Rogart Heritage Society who, for decades, collected, conserved and published the history of our parish, its people and their stories.\n\n\"He will be hugely missed by us and by folk around the world whose lives he touched: by those of us who were stirred by his passion for local history; those who read his books and anyone who enjoyed his music and talks on a multitude of topics.\n\n\"He was always generous with his knowledge and helped many with their research. It was a privilege to have known and to have worked with John.\"\n\nGolspie Heritage Society posted: “It was with great sadness that we learned today of the death of John Macdonald, Rogart.\n\n\"John was a true gentleman and shared his considerable knowledge with all of us. He was also a great entertainer and was always on hand to give a tune or a story.\n\n\"He will be sorely missed by us all and we send our deepest condolences to his family at this sad time.”\n\nClyne Heritage Society posted: “It is with great sadness that we have received the news that Rogart's finest, John Macdonald, has passed away peacefully and so soon after the passing of his wife, Gena.\n\n\"John was a staunch member and friend of our society, but was the driving force behind Rogart Heritage Society and everything to do with history and heritage in his beloved parish.\"\n\nClyne Heritage Society shared a picture of Mr Macdonald signing the first edition of his book 'Rogart - the Story of a Sutherland Crofting Parish' after its AGM in March 2004, where he was the guest speaker.\n\nThe post continued: \"He never failed to entertain in his own, quiet, unassuming, but very knowledgeable way. He was such a lovely, kind, generous man and will be greatly missed.\"\n\nMr MacDonald’s death comes just over a month after his wife Gena, passed away on November 14.\n\nHe is survived by his children Liz, Andrew and Stephen, grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
