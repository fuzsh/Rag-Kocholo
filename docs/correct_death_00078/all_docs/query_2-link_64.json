He also used to write a very popular monthly column for the Am Bratach magazine.\n\nThe Rogart community hopes to establish a John Macdonald archive in the vestry of St Callan’s Church, should they succeed in acquiring the building from the Church of Scotland.\n\nRogart Heritage Society posted on social media: \"John was an inspirational founding member of Rogart Heritage Society who, for decades, collected, conserved and published the history of our parish, its people and their stories.\n\n\"He will be hugely missed by us and by folk around the world whose lives he touched: by those of us who were stirred by his passion for local history; those who read his books and anyone who enjoyed his music and talks on a multitude of topics.\n\n\"He was always generous with his knowledge and helped many with their research. It was a privilege to have known and to have worked with John.\"\n\nGolspie Heritage Society posted: “It was with great sadness that we learned today of the death of John Macdonald, Rogart.\n\n\"John was a true gentleman and shared his considerable knowledge with all of us.

He was such a lovely, kind, generous man and will be greatly missed.\"\n\nMr MacDonald’s death comes just over a month after his wife Gena, passed away on November 14.\n\nHe is survived by his children Liz, Andrew and Stephen, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nDo you want to respond to this article?
