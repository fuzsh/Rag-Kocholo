        "text": "Sir John A. Macdonald Day is held every year on January 11. The Right Honourable Sir John A. Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of Canada and one of the architects of Confederation.\n\nEvery January 11, Canadians organize activities and events in his honour. Teachers and youth leaders often use this day as an opportunity to teach young people about our first prime minister and the founding of our country.\n\nSir John A. Macdonald Day was established as an Act, the Sir John A. Macdonald Day and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day Act, which came into effect in March 2002.\n\nThis web page includes links to different organizations that have a wealth of information about Sir John and provide information about Sir John A. Macdonald Day activities. We invite you to visit these sites for ideas on what you can do to celebrate Sir John and learn more about Canada."
