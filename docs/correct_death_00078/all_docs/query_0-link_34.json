        "text": "Des and Jean Moore Clippings thanks to the Moore gals.\n\nSOME PEOPLE make a decent wage racing automobiles while others sell them. And, of course, there are still others who put in their regular 40 hours, plus a little overtime here and there, repairing what those of us who don’t know better, do to cars. And then there’s Ken Carter, a Canadian. He jumps automobiles over school buses. Let me repeat that.\n\nKen Carter jumps a car, a used car In need of repair, over school buses. Two buses as a matter of fact. And if everything works according to design, Ken Carter usually lands on what he calls a cushion. That’s three more cars just to the rear of the last bus. It breaks the fall, you see.\n\nHE’S SCHEDULED to take his stunt driving act to Five Flags Speedway Sunday for a performance after the stock car race which starts at 2:30 p.m. With a little luck, Ken Carter should be up and over around 4 p.m. If you happen to show up for the races, you won’t be able to miss Ken Carter. Just look for the white school buses that have such things as, “The Mad Canadian, “Suicide Auto Jump,” and “Death” written in bold letters on the side. There’s also a hangman’s noose painted on the suicide rig for that little extra something.\n\nCarter, a veteran of 18 years at his chosen profession, got into school bus jumping because, well, because it just seemed like the thing to do at the time. He had been working with Joey Chitwood, but then sprang out on his own in 1963. First it was one bus, then two, and now he’s going for the big one … a leap over two buses and onto another ramp. As it is now.\n\nKen Carter and his car sail some 150-feet for five or so seconds to the waiting three cushion cars. THE RAMP-TO-RAMP jump, to really dress up his act, will probably come sometime next year. He has the ramp ready at his home in Miami. That jump, Ken Carter figures, will put him in Guinesses’ book of world records. He will have gone farther than any man has in an automobile …in the air that is. “I can’t tell you why I do it,” Ken Carter said Saturday sitting in a motel room. “It’s like asking why we are here. “I suppose you want to be No. 1 in your field.\n\nIt’s something to perfect.” He also feels that he is performing a service of a sort. Ken uses old used cars in his act, cars that might have some defect. By his demolishing them, he sees it as keeping possibly unsafe autos out of the hands of youngsters and off the streets. “A CAR to me is a lethal weapon. And I’ve never had an accident.\n\nI know what to do when I’m on the road.” Usually Ken and Mike McDonagh, his mechanic and traveling mate, drive from show to show, about 60 a year, in his two buses, pulling the ramp. He and Mike, whom he calls “The Wrench,” also use the buses for a home away from home. “But, not right now. The bus has got a hole in it,” Ken Carter said. Evidently the victim of a misplaced zoom.\n\n“You really have to get psyched up to go over the buses,” Ken said. “You have to wait for the right moment. “And the right speed. Otherwise, you’ll miss the crash cars and then you’ve got a real problem. “You don’t want to land on the bus.\n\nIf you do, it’s a hard hit on the track upside down in a car without a roll bar.” THE TOP of bus No. 4 (he’s gone through numbers one, two and three already this year) has the scuff marks of a few misses. . Once he ran out of gas coming off the ramp, a very unfortunate miscalculation for a man who works hard at his vocation. But then, that’s all in the past now.\n\nKen Carter is working for the ramp-to-ramp job. And maybe a television appearance and a couple of shows at the big speed factories, like Indy and Daytona. And who knows. Maybe three buses..\n\nPensacola News Journal\n\nPensacola, Florida • Sun, Oct 29, 1972Page 2\n\n” Ken Carter, commonly called “The Mad Canadian,” has an obsession. And he is determined to satisfy his obsession even if it kills him which it could. “I have this thing about the Guiness Book of World Records,” said Carter. I’ve got to be in it” Carter may get in it but not in the category he prefers. If things go right he will be listed by Guinness two years from now in the following manner: “Longest Jump in a Jet-Propelled Automobile: Ken Carter, one mile across Lake Champlain, July 4, 1976.” If things go wrong the Guiness listing will be: “Shortest Lifespan for a Naturalized Citizen of the United States: Ken Carter, 19 seconds, July 4, 1976.” Carter, you see, plans on leaving the Canadian side of Lake Champlain in a car. He plans on arriving on the American side of Lake Champlain in the same car and receiving his citizenship papers.\n\nThat is what he plans. “No, I’m not crazy,” said Carter, resting in his Pensacola motel room with his cane and a telephone by his side. “A crazy person can’t earn $100,000 a year. .\n\nNamath isn’t crazy. . .Sinatra isnt crazy.” Sinatra? Frank Sinatra? Old Blue Eyes? What has he got to do with it? “All of us are in the same business,” said Carter. “We are in the business of entertaining people.” Neither Ali, Namath nor Sinatra will be at the Five Flags Speedway Friday night, but Carter will. And he will be doing his business as usual.\n\nHe will attempt to jump 12 trucks in an ordinary street car, leaving from one ramp and arriving on another. ‘ Carter has mixed success at this sort of thing. He jumped 13 trucks on Nov. 17 of last year in front of ABC television cameras to establish the unofficial and uncontested world record for truck-jumping at 1 17 feet. However, he was trying to jump 12 trucks before 43,000 spectators in Houston’s Astrodome on Jane.\n\n10 and a funny thing happened.He was going too fast and he couldn’t believe he overjumped “the whole damn thing.” That’s why he bought the cane. ‘ His left leg is not mending too well. Carter is 37 and the bones may be getting a little brittle. He has been trying to make cars fly for 20 years and admits he has got to stop one of these days. That’s why everything is aimed toward “the big jump” over Lake Champlain.\n\n“So I keep going out and breaking bones,” said Carter. “It’s worth it as long as I can let the people know about what is going to happen on July 4, 1976. “You will have four major news stories in 1976,” added Carter, who then listed them in order of importance: “The Bicentennial. . .the Olympics. . .your Presidential election –and my jump.” If you feel as if you have read something similar to this you have.\n\nThe last time, however, it was “the Evel American” instead of “the Mad Canadian.” And it was Snake River Canyon instead of Lake Champlain. And it was a guided missile known as “the jetcycle” instead of a jet-powered car known as “the Challenger.” “I wont have any built-in safety factors like Knievel had,” said speaking of Evel’s relatively soft descent to the ground by parachute when his attempt failed. “When the car crashes and it will crash I’ve just got to hope I’m on dry land and the car’s body holds together.” Carter’s car and he will be displaying a prototype of the Challenger Friday night at the Five Flags Speedway will be equipped with parachutes. According to Carter, the car will leave a slightly elevated ramp at 300 miles per hour and never be more than 300 feet above the water or ground whichever it hits first Subsequently, the parachutes will slow it down some but it still is going to come to a very sudden stop.\n\nIronically, Carter will be required to immediately ship the car back to the Canadian side of the lake. Customs regulations view his jump as an illegal entry into the United States. After all, we can’t have people constantly jumping across Lake Champlain, because there’s no telling who they are or what they might be bringing with them other than a trunk load of insurance policies. Surely there must be an easier way to get citizenship papers? “But I have to be recognized,” said Carter, who has been jumping out of Fort Lauderdale, where he lives on a residence visa from Canada. “Everything is a battle for recognition from the Academy Awards to the Heisman Trophy..\n\nUnited States\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola\n\nPensacola News Journal\n\n1975\n\nApr\n\n10\n\nThe Toronto Star\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada • Sat, Sep 18, 1976Page 133\n\n“I want to be recognized on the street,” said the heavy-set Canadian with rebellious black hair. “I want to hear people say: There’s Ken Carter the guy who did it ” Yes, but why not be Ken Carter, the guy who did something else? Why does “it” have to be jumping the width of a one-mile lake in a machine which has wheels instead of wings? “When I was a kid, I remember jumping my bicycle over a saw horse,” said Carter, rubbing his broken leg. “Every kid enjoys that. . “I joined a thrill show when I was 17 and it was just like joining the circus,” he said.\n\n“I got my boyhood wish and I’ve worked hard at it for 20 years. “I’m in the crash business but I constantly think about safety.” – In fact, Carter claims he is getting paranoid about waiting , until July 4, 1976, for his appointment with the record books. He has a growing fear some ordinary mishap will rob him of his chance. – “I’m afraid I’ll step off the curb and somebody will run me, over,” he said, rubbing his leg with greater force. “And food poisoning scares me.\n\n“I couldn’t stand it if something prevented me from making . that jump.” Yes but why? Tell us one more time. “Well, there’s the peace.” Come again? “When I jump 12 trucks, like I’ll do Friday night, I’m in the -air for about five seconds,” said Carter. “And that five second ride is what everybody is looking for peace and serenity.\n\n“But, when I jump the one-mile width of Lake Champlain, it will be about a 19-second ride,” he said, squeezing the leg, perhaps for good luck. “Just think 19 seconds. “Now that will really be peace and serenity.” : ‘ . As long as it’s not too much peace and serenity..\n\nPlans are under way for a $500,000, nine-city competition tour involving famed motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel and automobile stunt man Ken Carter for the fall of 1975. The Journal learned Wednesday that Dallas promoter Sam Copland is planning the nine-week “head-to-head” competition and was preparing to announce the event when Carter appears on the Mike Douglas television show April 27. “Yes, it is in the mill,” said Copland by phone from his Dallas headquarters. “This is going to be big.. “We’re going to dance in the street.” According to Carter, who will perform at the Five Flags Speedway Friday night, he and Knievel will compete for nine consecutive weeks in nine different cities.\n\nHe said the new Superdome in New Orleans and the Astrodome in Houston will be two of the sites, while the other cities will include Los Angeles, New York and St. Louis. “For the first eight weeks,” said Carter, “Knievel and I will get $25,000 each per week. Then, on the ninth week, the winner will get an additional $100,000.” Carter will use a car, while Knievel will be on a motorcycle. “Winning,” accordingto Carter, will not be based solely on who can jump the farthest but will be judged on the “best overall performance.” Carter, who has appeared on network television twice in the last year, admitted it is a great opportunity for him but also said it would be good for Knievel, who has not performed since his failure to cross the Snake River Canyon last year.\n\n“Knievel has got to come out of his shell,” said Carter. “He has been rediculed and has to live with himself.”\n\nThe Ottawa Citizen\n\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada • Mon, Oct 25, 1982Page 17\n\nCarter returned to stunt driving and on July 1, 1983, attempted to jump a pond in Peterborough, Ontario. The jump failed when the car began to fishtail on the runway and ramp, which ultimately put him in the water. Carter vowed to try the jump again and on September 5, 1983, made another attempt. His car, a 1982 Pontiac Firebird bodied car fitted with a homemade rocket, overshot its target landing ramp and landed on its roof. Carter was killed instantly. He is buried in Montreal.\n\nA 2016 musical docudrama by John Bolton, Aim for the Roses, documents an album created by Mark Haney that was inspired by Ken Carter. It includes scenes from The Devil at Your Heels, and also shows footage from events after the St. Lawrence jump including Carter’s fatal crash at Peterborough.\n\nDo You Remember?

As I listened to the roar of the heavier tires, and watched them throw my tire sensor system out of whack, I had to laugh at some old memories.\n\nMy late husband Angelo used to argue that winter tires were “for people from Toronto who have to call in the army to shovel the sidewalks when it snows.” That was until one day he backed down my father’s snowy Miltimore driveway in Bromont and removed part of his fence. Not content with believing his Delta 88 could do such a thing he attempted to reverse again, only this time he hit the mailbox.\n\nThrough the years as he got older he began to realize living in a rural area needed snow tires. One day I overheard Angelo tell my oldest son Sky to get his head out of the sand and put some winter tires on his car. I just smiled and realized things just take time to sink in. It was similar to that proudest moment of being a parent when my child agreed it was finally cold enough to wear a hat.\n\nArthur Knight, my late Dad, always insisted that you kept bags of sand in the trunk for traction in case you got stuck in the winter. His 70s Ford Pinto was loaded to the brim with bags of sand, and when I went to visit him he always insisted on tossing some in my trunk too.\n\nIt was supposed to add weight, and if I ever got stuck, the sand could be used for traction, he said. I never actually got stuck, so I never had to use the sand. He said he learned the hard way hitting every ditch on the Brome Pond road one winter with no sand or salt in the trunk and a bunch of lightweights riding in his car with him. Somehow I doubt that a couple of sandbags, add or subtract anything is meaningful to the traction of a vehicle today that already weighs a few tons when empty, plus a few hundred pounds with a driver and passenger. But, weight was significant in the days of rear wheel drive, because most of the weight was in the front. I can well remember in my youth, the only way I got up an icy hill (not having heeded my father’s advice about the sand) was to have a couple of my friends climb into the trunk to put some weight over the back wheels.\n\nEvery year AAA publishes advice for winter driving and putting sand or litter in the back of a car is always on the list. I personally prefer cat litter because it’s relatively inexpensive (non clumping, non scented) and provides decent traction.\n\nI decided to look this traction myth up on Snopes.com and the page was completely blank. Had Arthur Knight had it all wrong? I found a few discussions on a few automotive boards and one man had this to say.\n\n“So while extra weight generally improves traction, the only safe place to put it is in between the wheels. That’s why, for traction, we suggest car-pooling. In fact, when recruiting car-poolers, you could start by putting up a sign at Weight-Watchers.”\n\nAfter more research I decided to go back to Snopes where I found another link about the topic. Again the page was blank and the lone entry was about a woman called *“The Human Couch”.\n\nWord on the street goes that a very large woman had to be brought to the ER after she had experienced shortness of breath. While they attempted to undress her an asthma inhaler fell out of one of the folds of her arm. A shiny new dime was under her breast and a TV remote control was found somewhere else on her body. Her family was extremely grateful that she was okay, and that they found the remote.\n\nIt’s easy to see I don’t care for Winter one bit, and if there is one good thing that comes out of snow, cold and ice is the fact I haven’t seen a mosquito in a really long time.\n\n*( Brown, Mark.

Here a decision had to be made,-West to the intersection with High St. (destination diner???) or East to the intersection with Bell to check out Curb Service.\n\nWith no luck; back to Brundage’s to swing west on Lake Ave to pass the riverfront, Canoe Club and beyond the high school to reverse course. We must have found this occupation amusing and interesting because we did this circuit many times without (for the most part) or (never having) any “luck”? To break the pattern, a 180 at the town line would suffice, or if something of interest was spotted (seldom), a 180 would be performed at that point.\n\nAt times we must have peaked the interest of the local gendarmes, for-on one of the many occasions when two (or more) cars were racing down the town line, the race ends at the Hwy 7 junction with a 3 car formation. When the dust settled, it was determined that the third car was occupied by Chief Cornell. A little chagrined (and soon out of pocket), they answered to the ensuing charges with an amount almost equal to a weeks wages.\n\nIt seemed a little ludicrous as these jalopies could barely attain a speed of 50mph but they were dangerous in other respects. Two cars racing down the Town Line neck and neck, approaching highway 7; whether it was late braking or no braking; the driver one of the vehicles failed to stop and careened through the intersection and crashed the embankment on the other side, crushing his car and a portion of himself-his upper arm broken in several places.\n\nThe remedy was a complete arm cast (screws and rods) that he wore for several (6) months and the good news:- he became the best one armed pool player in CP. In order to keep these cars on the road, we all had to become back yard mechanics with varying degrees of competency-some much better than others. Take for instance, an evening drive to Perth and we are all commenting to the driver about his inability to properly steer the car . His solution was to apparently let the car drift to one side and then counter that with the encouragement of a drift in the opposite direction. Worked well for the most part as he only clipped two opposite direction cars. They were barely “grazings” so no stop was made by either party-especially since we would be long gone by the time anyone could turn around. I believe someone else took over the driving for the remainder of the outing.
