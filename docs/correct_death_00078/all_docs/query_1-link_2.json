        "text": "Sir John Macdonald (born January 11, 1815, Glasgow, Scotland—died June 6, 1891, Ottawa, Ontario, Dominion of Canada) was the first prime minister of the Dominion of Canada (1867–73, 1878–91), who led Canada through its period of early growth. Though accused of devious and unscrupulous methods, he is remembered for his achievements.\n\nMacdonald emigrated from Scotland to Kingston, in what is now Ontario, Canada, in 1820. He was called to the bar in 1836. After the British Parliament united Upper and Lower Canada as Canada West (now in Ontario) and Canada East (now in Quebec) in the Act of Union of 1840, Macdonald was elected to the assembly of the Province of Canada as a Conservative for Kingston in 1844. From 1848 to 1854, while his party was in opposition, Macdonald worked at promoting the British America League, designed to unify Canada and strengthen its ties to Great Britain. Growing sympathy for reform led him to bring about a coalition government in 1854 with Sir George Étienne Cartier, leader of Canada East, out of which developed the Liberal-Conservative Party (forerunner of the Conservative Party), with Macdonald as its leader. He became prime minister of the Province of Canada in 1857.\n\nIn June 1864 Macdonald and Cartier joined with their chief opponent, George Brown, in order to further the scheme of confederation of British North America. After conferences in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in Quebec, and in London, the British North America Act was passed (1867), creating the Dominion of Canada, and Macdonald became its first leader. He was created Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in that year in recognition of his services to the British Empire."
