Write to us: letters@ottawacitizen.com\n\nArticle content\n\nDifferent angles on the algae bloom\n\nRe: The blob that ate the canal: Parks Canada weed harvester to begin work Monday, June 20.\n\nBlair Crawford’s article exposes the ugly side and negative environmental effects of this natural phenomenon in the Rideau Canal. Although the algae invasion, as reported, does not pose a risk to our health, it is an eyesore not worthy of a UNESCO-designated World Heritage title. However, we can also find beauty if we look beyond the water surface. The canal’s green blobs and weeds create an imaginary landscape of algae galaxies, abstract patterns and an apocalyptic-like habitat.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

Its reflective surface showcased the surrounding architecture and nature as beautifully distorted abstract tableaus. As I walked north from Pretoria Bridge to Plaza Bridge, getting closer to the urban core, the reflections changed from forms to shapes. The site was a creative, healthy paradise.\n\nPost-algae bloom, a week after my first visit, that creative healthy paradise was disappearing. The site had changed, with weeds and algae appearing on the water surface, making it difficult to see any reflections. However, the site of weeds dancing gracefully just over the surface offered another unexpected creative outlet.\n\nDuring my third visit, by June 16, the reported green blobs made it almost impossible to see any reflections or creative healthy paradise. Instead, the changed landscape appeared like a system of algae galaxies underwater. Green and yellow elongated, gaseous-like structures illuminated by fading sunbeams expanded from the unsightly blobs on the surface. Also, the ducks and fish navigating through this web of blobs and weeds in search of food, or perhaps oxygen, reminded me of the scavengers from films depicting an apocalypse.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFortunately, this will not be the case for the species inhabiting or benefiting from the existence of this UNESCO World Heritage and National Historic Site of Canada, as the weed harvester is on its way.\n\nAlexei Quintero, Ottawa\n\nLinear park now includes a wasteland\n\nBearing witness to the wasteland created on the Byron Linear Park and the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway by the removal of the urban forest, I am dismayed. What price have we paid to run the LRT through this pristine parkland? No passengers will board from the north side of the line in this area as there are few residences here, and maybe a few in the high-rent district to the south.\n\nAny successful, effective transportation system needs a bilateral access. Sorry for the 20/20 hindsight but this devastation is a travesty.\n\nRichard Christie, Ottawa\n\nDrive-in not a good use of the Greenbelt\n\nI was sorry to read about the opening of a drive-in theatre at Wesley Clover Park, in the NCC Greenbelt, because it means yet another reduction in green space, which the Greenbelt was meant to preserve.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe are a growing city, having recently reached one million. But unfortunately they are not manufacturing green space anywhere in our city, so every loss hurts even more.\n\nWhat is confounding is that the NCC’s Greenbelt Master Plan talks about preserving green space in the nation’s capital, and sets as a goal “the reduction of non-federal land uses” within the Greenbelt. I think creating a drive-in theatre in the Greenbelt contradicts this stated goal.\n\nAlex Cullen, Ottawa\n\nCycling track will hurt efforts to green the city\n\nOttawa residents on Scott Street and neighbouring streets such as Carleton Avenue have been given notice by the City of Ottawa of sewer and water main work. With that announcement came a proposal for a raised cycling track on the south side of Scott, which will severally affect residents’ driveways, gardens, shrubs, old trees, flower beds and fences.\n\nAt the zoom meeting held May 28, residents pointed out to Patrick Chamney, senior engineer for the city, and Coun. Jeff Leiper, that the north side of Scott Street already has in place a sidewalk and cycling path.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis proposal is very stressful for residents who have been living here for more than 30 years and are trying to help green Ottawa with their gardens. They will be hit hard by the proposed implementation of this track down the south side of Scott. This is not helping to green Ottawa, folks; it’s just adding stress to residents’ lives during these pandemic times.\n\nLeslie Cain, Ottawa\n\nIs there a plan to dispose of all those masks?\n\nOn my regular morning and evening walks, I notice the clear skies with no jet contrails, quietness of the traffic, and people complying with the COVID-19 personal distance requirements.\n\nThe downside is seeing the increasing number of single-use masks lying around: mask pollution. As the masks are now a necessity for many parts of our lives in Ottawa, is there some plan to provide a sanitary and safe disposal method rather than discarding them on the ground? For safety reasons, individuals who see a mask on the ground will be reluctant to pick up and dispose of it properly.\n\nPerhaps this is one more item to add to Ottawa Public Health’s information “to do” list.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBob Whitelaw, Ottawa\n\nTreat drug addiction as a public health problem\n\nRecently, Mayor Jim Watson called for a safe drug supply. Ottawa Council backs this initiative.\n\nLess than four per cent of Canadians use illicit drugs and fewer than two per cent of the population has a problem resulting from hard-drug use, notably heroin and cocaine. The consequences, however, which can include overdosing and death, place a heavy social and economic burden on society.\n\nWhat Canada needs is smart solutions that aim for long-term improvements. Based on credible research and analysis of the situation as a whole, we must take into account human psychology, cost effectiveness, and potential benefits. Let’s start by understanding what motivates people, and especially the young, to use illicit drugs. Programs that address the reasons for the behaviour are far more likely to work.\n\nThat said, it is about time we start treating drug use and drug addiction for what it is: a public health problem with the priorities being treatment, rehabilitation and harm-reduction programs.\n\nI have long advocated that all drugs should be decriminalized, not unlike alcohol and tobacco. Think of the revenues that would flow to governments from this. It has been estimated these revenues total more than $2 billion a year, most of which now flows into the pockets of criminals and organized crime.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEmile Therien, Ottawa, public health and safety advocate\n\nFirearms group is fear-mongering\n\nRe: Open Letter To Canadians, June 22.\n\nThe full-page open letter advertisement from a gun rights activist group may be an exercise in free speech, but it is also a demonstration of fear-mongering and paranoia. The government of Canada is not embarking on a full-scale confiscation of personal property. Gun owners who hunt, target-shoot or maintain rural properties will not lose their possessions.\n\nWith the support of a majority of Canadians, the government is making illegal the ownership of military-level assault weaponry and other implements of mass killing. It is the safety of future generations in Canadian society on whose behalf they are acting.\n\nVictor Suthren, Merrickville\n\nTrudeau government is undermining property rights\n\nThanks for sharing the open-letter advertisement from the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights. The landmark case they are engaging in will have impacts on those who own any type of property. I have engaged in conversations with family members who just assumed this was an NRA-style fight.\n\nWe elect a government to follow our democracy and protect our rights. Sadly, this one has driven a firearms organization to the courts to determine where the government went wrong.\n\nWilliam Davie, Ottawa\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
