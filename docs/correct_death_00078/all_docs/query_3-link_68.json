        "text": "Nation-builder\n\nSir John A. Macdonald was the chief architect of modern Canada. In his youth, British North America was a patchwork of separate colonies; by the time of his death, Canada stretched from sea to sea. Shrewd and charismatic, Macdonald persuaded New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to join Qu√©bec and Ontario in forming Confederation in 1867. He was the main author of the young country's constitution and its first Prime Minister.\n\nMacdonald devoted his later career to expanding the country, tying it together with a transcontinental railway, and populating it with white settlers. To these ends, his government implemented policies designed to displace, control, and assimilate Indigenous people while also working to prevent Asians from immigrating and voting. These policies and their legacies have made Macdonald a deeply controversial figure.\n\nIf we wish to form... a great nationality, commanding the respect of the world, able to hold our own against all opponents, and to defend those institutions we prize... this can only be obtained by a union of some kind between the scattered and weak boundaries composing the British North American Provinces.\n\nJohn A. Macdonald, 1865\n\nI have reason to believe that the agents as a whole... are doing all they can, by refusing food until the Indians are on the verge of starvation, to reduce the expense.\n\nSir John A. Macdonald, 1882"
