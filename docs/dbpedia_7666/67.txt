Former Register reporter and Total Buzz blogger Norberto Santana Jr. on Wednesday launched the Voice of OC Web site, where he is editor in chief.

The site bills itself as “Orange County’s Nonprofit Investigative News Agency.” It debuts with a full menu of stories, including a heavy portion of governmental reporting.

We wish Norberto well with the endeavor, and look forward having a few more reporters crawling through the brush to hold those in power accountable.
