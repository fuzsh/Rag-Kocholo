In a move to widen and strengthen its coverage of local government issues, the Register has announced a content-sharing partnership with Voice of OC, an investigative nonprofit news agency.

Stories from Voice of OC will supplement and complement the extensive reporting efforts of Register journalists who cover government at the city and County of Orange level, said Steve Green, Register assistant managing editor/local.

“‘We’ve been impressed with Voice of OC, whose reporters have produced more than 3,500 stories on local government in Orange County since 2010,” said Green. “Voice of OC does a great job covering daily happenings at the County of Orange and in city governments, and our readers will benefit from our arrangement.”

“Bolstering civic journalism produces better government for taxpayers,” said Voice of OC Editor in Chief Norberto Santana Jr.

Voice of OC is funded from a variety of sources including contributions from individuals, such as its chairman, attorney and philanthropist Wylie Aitken.

It has also secured funding from journalism foundations such as the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Ethics and Excellence in Journalism; as well as non-journalism groups such as the Orange County Employees Association and the California Endowment, a private health foundation.

Terms of the deal, in which the Register will pay for Voice of OC content, were not disclosed.
