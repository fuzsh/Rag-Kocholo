        "text": "The following statement is from more than a dozen organizations representing thousands of working journalists and First Amendment advocates. Orange County Press Club’s Board of Directors agreed to join our colleagues in standing up for a free press.\n\nJournalism is not a crime. Our community of journalism associations, media unions and First Amendment advocates stands in solidarity with Los Angeles Times reporter Alene Tchekmedyian and all journalists who are threatened or harassed by law enforcement.\n\nToday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff suggested that Alene is a subject in a criminal investigation into a leaked video showing a deputy kneeling on an inmate’s head. In recent weeks, Alene has reported on claims alleging that the Sheriff obstructed justice and retaliated against whistleblowers who raised concerns about the incident. This escalation comes after a years-long history of the Sheriff harshly criticizing many local journalists just for doing their jobs, including Cerise Castle, Josie Huang, Maya Lau and others.\n\nFor over 50 years, the Supreme Court has upheld the First Amendment right to publish information of public concern received by members of the press or public. For the Sheriff to suggest otherwise is an unconscionable attempt to deter the press from exercising its long-established right to report on abuses of power.\n\nWe condemn these outrageous attacks on newsgathering, and we remain committed to supporting journalism that reports on the facts without fear or favor.\n\nMedia Guild of the West, The NewsGuild-CWA Local 39213\n\nLos Angeles Times Guild\n\nGreater Los Angeles Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists\n\nFirst Amendment Coalition\n\nRadio Television Digital News Association\n\nAsian American Journalists Association, Los Angeles\n\nOnline News Association Los Angeles\n\nCCNMA Latino Journalists of California\n\nLos Angeles Press Club\n\nNational Association of Black Journalists of Los Angeles\n\nNational Association of Hispanic Journalists\n\nNational Press Photographers Association\n\nOpen Vallejo / Informed California Foundation\n\nWe Make KPBS (SAG-AFTRA)\n\nSPJ San Diego\n\nSPJ Northern California\n\nACLU of Southern California\n\nSusan E. Seager, Adjunct Clinical Professor of Law, Press Freedom clinic at the University of California, Irvine School of Law\n\nOrange County Press Club\n\nCalifornians Aware\n\nMedia Alliance\n\nThe Orange County Press Club is saddened to learn that our colleague Dennis Brosterhous has died.\n\nSince 2015, Brosterhous had served as a copy editor for Los Angeles Times Community News in Fountain Valley, helping publish The Daily Pilot and Times OC. Working the night shift, Brosterhous answered calls from feverish reporters needing an eleventh-hour edit on a story.\n\n“I can’t tell you how lucky the younger people at the Daily Pilot were to have their work edited by a journeyman like Dennis. He was never judgmental; he took pride in pointing out our errors but did so in the manner of a teacher, not a critic,” Los Angles Times assistant managing editor John Canalis said.\n\nBrosterhous worked hard all his life and never retired.\n\n“I wish he had, but this is a hard line of work to give up once it’s in your blood,” Canalis added.\n\nA Sun City resident, Brosterhous worked as a copy editor and designer for The Press-Enterprise in Riverside from 1998 to 2009.\n\nBefore that, he served as managing editor of The Sun City News and its sister community newspapers (Menifee News and Perris Valley News), according to his resume.\n\nBrosterhous earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Southern California and an associate’s degree in English/Journalism from Long Beach City College.\n\nColleagues also described him as decent, funny, and smart. Brosterhous was an avid Dodgers fan and looked forward to attending games with his children for his birthday or on Fathers’ Day.\n\n“He was so kind to us cub reporters and always willing to help out on a tight deadline,” Los Angeles Times reporter Faith E. Pinho said.\n\nThe new year’s Orange County Press Club Board of Directors welcomes two new members and a new president.\n\nDaniel Langhorne will serve as the press club’s new president, new board member Brandon Pho will serve as vice president, and Shawn Raymundo joins the board for the first time.\n\n“I’m humbled by my fellow board members’ confidence in me to lead the Press Club as its next president,” Langhorne said by email shortly after his election by the board Thursday.\n\n“We’re committed to defending the First Amendment, mentoring the next generation of journalists, and diversifying our ranks to reflect the communities we cover.”\n\nLanghorne has served on the Board of Directors since 2018. He is currently executive editor for the Laguna Beach Independent and engagement editor for a nonprofit newsroom, The War Horse. As an Orange County Press Club scholarship winner, he believes the Press Club plays an important role in fostering the skill and talent of young journalists, who are needed more than ever.\n\nIncoming vice president Pho is a reporter for Voice of OC covering North Central Orange County. Pho was the senior editor for his college newspaper, The Daily Titan at Cal State Fullerton, where his work garnered first place honors at the Los Angeles Press Club and the College Media Association.\n\n“It’s an honor to join the OC Press Club Board of Directors — and as Vice President, at that,” Pho said.\n\n“I’m encouraged by the support I’ve gotten from the rest of the board and am chomping at the bit to outreach and expand our local press corps to include younger, Gen-Z journalists such as myself, as well as newsmakers with something new to say about our fast-changing region.\n\nPatty Marsters continues as the board’s treasurer and administrator of the annual awards contest. She has served on the board of the Orange County Press Club since 1998, acting in many roles. For the past several years, she has focused her organizational skills on putting together the annual Excellence In Journalism contest. After 24 years at OC Weekly, she moved on to the similarly LW Weekly, the newspaper for Leisure World Seal Beach. She also mentors aspiring writers at Newport Harbor High School and co-leads a multilevel Girl Scout troop.\n\nBradley Zint will continue as board secretary. He is the assistant director of communications for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. Prior to joining the Diocese, he worked in newspapers, marketing and for B2B publications. Much of his newspapering career was spent at the Daily Pilot, part of the Los Angeles Times Community News division based in Orange County. In his role at the press club, he focuses on the annual awards dinner and organizing events for working journalists.\n\nThe other 2021-22 board members include:\n\nSHAWN RAYMUNDO\n\nShawn Raymundo is a city editor for the San Clemente Times and is running for a seat on the Press Club Board for the first time. Here is his candidate statement:\n\nI’m an Arizona State University alumnus with a bachelor’s degree in Global Studies. During my time at ASU, I worked for the school’s newspaper The State Press, where I held various positions including reporter, photographer and news desk editor.\n\nPrior to living in South Orange County, I spent three years in the U.S. territory of Guam, working as the government accountability reporter for the Pacific Daily News. There, I covered the island’s legislature and governor’s office.\n\nNow, with Picket Fence Media, I’m reporting on the city of San Clemente while also managing the production of the newspaper. My time here has allowed me to cover a range of issues such as nuclear waste and utilities, transportation and mobility, coastal environment, and the never boring subject of local government.\n\nI believe I can be a great fit for the Press Club, and would enjoy the opportunity of collaborating with a group of talented journalists from the area.\n\nBEN BRAZIL\n\nBen Brazil is a features writer for TimesOC. He previously covered Huntington Beach for the Daily Pilot. Before joining the Daily Pilot in September 2016, he was a reporter for City News Service, a Southern California-based news service.\n\nHANNAH FRY\n\nHannah has served as an OC Press Club board member for five years and most recently served as club President. She has advocated for press freedom both locally and statewide and has helped organize events such as the annual Journalism Awards Gala. Hannah is a Metro reporter covering Orange County for the Los Angeles Times. She joined the newspaper eight years ago as a reporter for the Daily Pilot, a Times Community News publication. Hannah covered breaking news for The Times for two years and was part of the team that was a 2020 Pulitzer finalist for its coverage of a boat fire that killed 34 people off the coast of Santa Barbara.\n\nKATHY HOBSTETTER\n\nKathy is an international journalist and has been an OC Press Club board member for five years. Her publication, the iJump Sports Business Journal, has always been based in Orange County. The journal covers the international show jumping horse business, which has a financial impact of millions on the economy and the people and businesses who are in the sport. She has lived in Orange County since 1965. She enjoyed promoting and writing about a wide variety of subjects and she wrote extensively as a freelance journalist before opening her own magazine.\n\nSONYA QUICK\n\nSonya Quick is a digital editor, reporter and educator with more than 15 years of experience in news. She is digital editor at Voice of OC where she manages online fundraising, marketing, engagement, digital storytelling and user experience. In addition to working at Voice of OC, she teaches digital journalism at Chapman University. Previously, she worked for eight years at the Orange County Register as a digital and engagement editor, reporter, infographics storyteller and as the Register’s first mobile editor. She has more than decade of experience in leading efforts to create more connected journalism across devices, social platforms and audience types. Her career of work includes editing, reporting, designing infographics, researching data, developing mobile apps, refining user experiences, managing fundraising efforts, engagement on social media, guiding newsroom groups towards transformation and designing complete marketing roll-outs.\n\nDAVID N. YOUNG\n\nDavid is a working journalist and internationally recognized public affairs strategist who has worked in a variety of public capacities throughout his career. Currently, he is an editor with Community Media Corporation and has formerly served as editor of the Catalina Islander, the Seal Beach Sun and other publications.

This amendment may actually restrict existing press freedoms rather than expand them, turning this bill on its head and into something that hurts the very people it was written to help.\n\nMany of our organizations — an unprecedented coalition of press associations, labor unions, and journalism advocacy groups — had endorsed SB 98 prior to this amendment, and others were actively considering doing so. But as now amended, we must withhold any endorsement and are prepared to actively oppose SB 98 until its intent to protect journalists is restored.\n\nWe do not enter this political debate lightly. During the past two years, working conditions for California journalists have steadily deteriorated as many of our newspaper, television, radio, digital, freelance and student media colleagues covering protests have been arrested, detained or assaulted by law enforcement while on the job, including while covering the March 25 protest at Echo Park Lake in Los Angeles. Throughout California in the past 12 months alone, we have documented at least 36 incidents where police have injured, detained, arrested and violated the constitutional rights of clearly identifiable journalists.\n\nSB 98, as originally introduced by Sen. Mike McGuire, would have modestly extended existing state protections for journalists working in disaster areas to also apply to journalists covering civil disturbances. But an amendment added by the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 20, 2021, would require journalists to seek permission of a police commander to enter closed areas around protests — a hurdle that doesn’t currently exist under state law. This is a clear attempt to hobble this bill. Journalists should not need permission from a police commander to cover protests, just as law enforcement-issued press credentials should not be required in order for journalists to exercise their First Amendment rights in a public forum.\n\nWe are aware that law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, have been lobbying on SB 98 in recent months. We would point out that the Sheriff’s mishandling of press freedoms — the department’s deputies tackled and arrested KPCC’s Josie Huang last fall and have injured others — is one of the reasons our coalition formed in the first place.\n\nWe urge all First Amendment supporters in the California legislature to remove the amended language or strengthen SB 98 in a way that protects the vital activities of the press and the people’s right to receive information regarding matters of public concern. We encourage Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign a genuinely strengthened version into law.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAsian American Journalists Association, Los Angeles chapter\n\nCalifornians Aware\n\nCCNMA: Latino Journalists of California\n\nIBEW Local 45\n\nJournalism and Women Symposium, Southern California (JAWS SoCal)\n\nLos Angeles Press Club\n\nMedia Alliance\n\nMedia Guild of the West, NewsGuild-CWA Local 39213\n\nNational Association of Black Journalists of Los Angeles\n\nNational Association of Hispanic Journalists\n\nNational Press Photographers Association\n\nNational Writers Union\n\nOnline News Association Local Los Angeles\n\nOrange County Press Club\n\nPacific Media Workers Guild, The NewsGuild-CWA Local 39521\n\nRadio Television Digital News Association\n\nSociety of Professional Journalists, Greater Los Angeles chapter\n\nSociety of Professional Journalists, Northern California Chapter\n\nWe Make KCRW – SAG-AFTRA"
