        "text": "George Ellery Hale, Caltech Astrophysics, and the Hale 200-inch Telescope, 1920-1948\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOsterbrock, D. E.\n\n1998-05-01\n\nCaltech and the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar are two of George Ellery Hale's many creations in Southern California. He brought the California Institute of Technology into existence in 1920; Palomar Observatory was built for it. However, even before Hale had \"secured\" the funds for the 200-inch, astrophysical research had been underway on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, and it intensified after the Rockefeller grant came through. Interactions between the campus, Palomar Mountain, and Mount Wilson Obervatory (one of Hale's earlier creations) played important roles in determining the course of Caltech astrophysics. Changing funding patterns (from private philanthropy to drought, then \"defense\" weapons-development programs, and then governmental agencies designed to support scientific research) will be briefly described. The 18-inch Schmidt, built at the Caltech (200-inch Telescope) Shop, went into operation in 1936, the first research telescope on Palomar. The 200-inch, essentially completed, was dedicated in 1948 and went into operation for regularly scheduled research observations near the end of 1949. Its coude spectrograph was completed and put into regular use in stages from 1950 to 1952, Among the most important leaders of Caltech astrophysics up to 1948 and the years immediately after it when the 200-inch went into full operation were Robert A. Millikan, Max Mason, and Lee A. DuBridge. Some of the astrophysicists who worked at Caltech and Palomar were Albert Einstein, Richard C. Tolman, Fritz Zwicky, Ira S. Bowen, John A. Anderson, Sinclair Smith, John Strong, William A. Fowler and, just at the end of this period, Jesse L. Greenstein. Some of the key staff personnel were Russell W. Porter, Don O. Hendrix (on loan), and Byron Hill.\n\nHigh contrast stellar observations within the diffraction limit at the Palomar Hale telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMennesson, B.; Hanot, C.; Serabyn, E.; Martin, S. R.; Liewer, K.; Loya, F.; Mawet, D.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nWe report on high-accuracy, high-resolution (< 20mas) stellar measurements obtained in the near infrared ( 2.2 microns) at the Palomar 200 inch telescope using two elliptical (3m x 1.5m) sub-apertures located 3.4m apart. Our interferometric coronagraph, known as the \"Palomar Fiber Nuller\" (PFN), is located downstream of the Palomar adaptive optics (AO) system and recombines the two separate beams into a common singlemode fiber. The AO system acts as a \"fringe tracker\", maintaining the optical path difference (OPD) between the beams around an adjustable value, which is set to the central dark interference fringe. AO correction ensures high efficiency and stable injection of the beams into the single-mode fiber. A chopper wheel and a fast photometer are used to record short (< 50ms per beam) interleaved sequences of background, individual beam and interferometric signals. In order to analyze these chopped null data sequences, we developed a new statistical method, baptized \"Null Self-Calibration\" (NSC), which provides astrophysical null measurements at the 0.001 level, with 1 Ï uncertainties as low as 0.0003. Such accuracy translates into a dynamic range greater than 1000:1 within the diffraction limit, demonstrating that the approach effectively bridges the traditional gap between regular coronagraphs, limited in angular resolution, and long baseline visibility interferometers, whose dynamic range is restricted to 100:1. As our measurements are extremely sensitive to the brightness distribution very close to the optical axis, we were able to constrain the stellar diameters and amounts of circumstellar emission for a sample of very bright stars. With the improvement expected when the PALM-3000 extreme AO system comes on-line at Palomar, the same instrument now equipped with a state of the art low noise fast read-out near IR camera, will yield 10-4 to 10-3 contrast as close as 30 mas for stars with K magnitude brighter than 6. Such a system will provide a unique and\n\nUrania in the Marketplace: The Selling of Mt. Palomar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRumstay, Kenneth S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe 200-inch Hale telescope atop Mt. Palomar is one of the most iconic scientific facilities ever constructed. The world's largest optical telescope for over a quarter-century, it served as a symbol of hope for America during the Great Depression and in the post-war years. In 2016 we celebrate the eightieth anniversaries of the completion of the mirror blank, the start of construction of the dome and mounting, and the beginning of astronomical research at Palomar Observatory by Fritz Zwicky (with the 18-inch Schmidt camera).During its construction, and for many years after \"first light\" in 1949, the Hale telescope was prominently featured in numerous magazine advertisements. Most of these represented companies directly involved in its construction, notably Corning Glass Works, which was justly proud of its magnificent accomplishment. But companies only vaguely linked to the project, or not at all, also co-opted the mystique of \"the World's Largest Eye\" to promote their goods or services. Surprisingly, in light of the fact that it bore responsibility for fabricating the complex and innovative mounting, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company appears to have run only a single advertisement (in The National Geographic Magazine) touting its contribution to the project.Examples of magazine advertisements spanning the period 1936 to 1959 are presented.This work was supported by a faculty scholarship grant from Valdosta State University.\n\nDon Hendrix, master Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories optician\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOsterbrock, Donald E.\n\n2003-06-01\n\nDon O. Hendrix, with at most a high-school education and no previous experience in optics, because an outstanding astronomical optician at Mount Wilson Observatory. He started making Schmidt-camera optics for spectrographs there in 1932, and ultimately made them for all the stellar and nebular spectrographs used at the prime, Newtonian, Cassegrain, and coudÃ© foci of the 60-inch, 100-inch, and Palomar Hale 200-inch telescopes. He completed figuring and polishing the primary 200-inch mirror, and also the Lick Observatory 120-inch primary mirror. Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatory designers Theodore Dunham Jr., Rudolph Minkowski, and Ira S. Bowen led the way for many years in developing fast, effective astronomical spectrographs, based on Hendrix's skills.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: Palomar Transient Factory SNe IIn photometry (Ofek+, 2014)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOfek, E.

We selected 19 SNe IIn for which PTF/iPTF has good coverage of the light-curve rise and peak; they are listed in Table 1. Optical spectra were obtained with a variety of telescopes and instruments, including the Double Spectrograph (Oke & Gunn 1982PASP...94..586O) at the Palomar 5 m Hale telescope, the Kast spectrograph (Miller & Stone 1993, Lick Observatory Technical Report 66 (Santa Cruz, CA: Lick Observatory)) at the Lick 3 m Shane telescope, the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (Oke et al. 1995PASP..107..375O) on the Keck-1 10 m telescope, and the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (Faber et al. 2003SPIE.4841.1657F) on the Keck-2 10 m telescope.

Kent; Crawford, Sam; Loya, Frank; Moore, James\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA phase-shifting Zernike wavefront sensor has distinct advantages over other types of wavefront sensors. Chief among them are: 1) improved sensitivity to low-order aberrations and 2) efficient use of photons (hence reduced sensitivity to photon noise). We are in the process of deploying a phase-shifting Zernike wavefront sensor to be used with the realtime adaptive optics system for Palomar. Here we present the current state of the Zernike wavefront sensor to be integrated into the high-order adaptive optics system at Mount Palomar's Hale Telescope.\n\nPALM-3000: EXOPLANET ADAPTIVE OPTICS FOR THE 5 m HALE TELESCOPE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDekany, Richard; Bouchez, Antonin; Baranec, Christoph\n\n2013-10-20\n\nWe describe and report first results from PALM-3000, the second-generation astronomical adaptive optics (AO) facility for the 5.1 m Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. PALM-3000 has been engineered for high-contrast imaging and emission spectroscopy of brown dwarfs and large planetary mass bodies at near-infrared wavelengths around bright stars, but also supports general natural guide star use to V â 17. Using its unique 66 Ã 66 actuator deformable mirror, PALM-3000 has thus far demonstrated residual wavefront errors of 141 nm rms under â¼1'' seeing conditions. PALM-3000 can provide phase conjugation correction over a 6.''4 Ã 6.''4 working region at Î»moreÂ Â» = 2.2 Î¼m, or full electric field (amplitude and phase) correction over approximately one-half of this field. With optimized back-end instrumentation, PALM-3000 is designed to enable 10{sup â7} contrast at 1'' angular separation, including post-observation speckle suppression processing. While continued optimization of the AO system is ongoing, we have already successfully commissioned five back-end instruments and begun a major exoplanet characterization survey, Project 1640.Â«Â less\n\nAn off-the-shelf guider for the Palomar 200-inch telescope: interfacing amateur astronomy software with professional telescopes for an easy life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClarke, Fraser; Lynn, James; Thatte, Niranjan; Tecza, Matthias\n\n2014-08-01\n\nWe have developed a simple but effective guider for use with the Oxford-SWIFT integral field spectrograph on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. The guider uses mainly off-the-shelf components, including commercial amateur astronomy software to interface with the CCD camera, calculating guiding corrections, and send guide commands to the telescope. The only custom piece of software is an driver to provide an interface between the Palomar telescope control system and the industry standard 'ASCOM' system. Using existing commercial software provided a very cheap guider (<$5000) with minimal (<15 minutes) commissioning time. The final system provides sub-arcsecond guiding, and could easily be adapted to any other professional telescope\n\nThe PALM-3000 high-order adaptive optics system for Palomar Observatory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBouchez, Antonin H.; Dekany, Richard G.; Angione, John R.; Baranec, Christoph; Britton, Matthew C.; Bui, Khanh; Burruss, Rick S.; Cromer, John L.; Guiwits, Stephen R.; Henning, John R.; Hickey, Jeff; McKenna, Daniel L.; Moore, Anna M.; Roberts, Jennifer E.; Trinh, Thang Q.; Troy, Mitchell; Truong, Tuan N.; Velur, Viswa\n\n2008-07-01\n\nDeployed as a multi-user shared facility on the 5.1 meter Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, the PALM-3000 highorder upgrade to the successful Palomar Adaptive Optics System will deliver extreme AO correction in the near-infrared, and diffraction-limited images down to visible wavelengths, using both natural and sodium laser guide stars. Wavefront control will be provided by two deformable mirrors, a 3368 active actuator woofer and 349 active actuator tweeter, controlled at up to 3 kHz using an innovative wavefront processor based on a cluster of 17 graphics processing units. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with selectable pupil sampling will provide high-order wavefront sensing, while an infrared tip/tilt sensor and visible truth wavefront sensor will provide low-order LGS control. Four back-end instruments are planned at first light: the PHARO near-infrared camera/spectrograph, the SWIFT visible light integral field spectrograph, Project 1640, a near-infrared coronagraphic integral field spectrograph, and 888Cam, a high-resolution visible light imager.\n\nSpectroscopic classification of PS17chm with Double Spectrograph on Palomar 200-inch telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlagorodnova, N.; Kupfer, T.; Burdge, K.; Kasliwal, M.; Adams, S.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe report the classification of PS17chm, discovered by the by the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients (see Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560, and http://pswww.ifa.hawaii.edu ). The observations were performed on UT 2017-04-19 with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP; range 350-1000nm, spectral resolution R 4000) on Palomar 200-inch (P200) telescope.\n\nWIRC-POL: A near-IR spectro-polarimetric imager at Palomar Observatory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNilsson, Ricky; Tinyanont, Samaporn; Mawet, Dimitri; Knutson, Heather; WIRC-POL Team\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory is the largest equatorial-mounted telescope in the world. Combining a large aperture, extremely stable tracking, and no differential motion of optics, it introduces low and stable instrument polarization, making it uniquely suited for time-resolved polarimetry. Its prime focus currently hosts the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRC), which is being refurbished with a new H2 detector, 32 channel readout electronics, grism, focal-plane mask and polarization grating. This will transform it into WIRC-POL â a machine for high-precision photometry, and slitless low-resolution (R~150) spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry. Two key science programs are starting in 2017: (1) a large spectro-polarimetric survey of approximately 1000 LTY field brown dwarfs, probing atmospheric composition, physical properties, and cloud dynamics at the L-T transition, and (2) a survey of transiting exoplanets, using the high photometric stability and slitless spectroscopy mode to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from spectra obtained in transit and secondary eclipse, and search for transit-timing variations in multiple planet systems. Here we present an overview of the instrument upgrades and the exciting scientific questions we aim to address.\n\nHigh resolution broad-band spectroscopy in the NIR using the Triplespec externally dispersed interferometer at the Hale telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErskine, David J.; Edelstein, J.; Sirk, M.; Wishnow, E.; Ishikawa, Y.; McDonald, E.; Shourt, W. V.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nHigh resolution broad-band spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths has been performed using externally dis- persed interferometry (EDI) at the Hale telescope at Mt. Palomar. The EDI technique uses a field-widened Michelson interferometer in series with a dispersive spectrograph, and is able to recover a spectrum with a resolution 4 to 10 times higher than the existing grating spectrograph. This method increases the resolution well beyond the classical limits enforced by the slit width and the detector pixel Nyquist limit and, in principle, decreases the effect of pupil variation on the instrument line-shape function. The EDI technique permits arbi- trarily higher resolution measurements using the higher throughput, lower weight, size, and expense of a lower resolution spectrograph. Observations of many stars were performed with the TEDI interferometer mounted within the central hole of the 200 inch primary mirror. Light from the interferometer was then dispersed by the TripleSpec near-infrared echelle spectrograph. Continuous spectra between 950 and 2450 nm with a resolution as high as ~27,000 were recovered from data taken with TripleSpec at a native resolution of Ë2,700. Aspects of data analysis for interferometric spectral reconstruction are described. This technique has applications in im- proving measurements of high-resolution stellar template spectra, critical for precision Doppler velocimetry using conventional spectroscopic methods. A new interferometer to be applied for this purpose at visible wavelengths is under construction.\n\nHigh-resolution broadband spectroscopy using externally dispersed interferometry at the Hale telescope: Part 1, data analysis and results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErskine, David J.; Edelstein, Jerry; Wishnow, Edward H.; Sirk, Martin; Muirhead, Philip S.; Muterspaugh, Matthew W.; Lloyd, James P.; Ishikawa, Yuzo; McDonald, Eliza A.; Shourt, William V.; Vanderburg, Andrew M.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHigh-resolution broadband spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths (950 to 2450 nm) has been performed using externally dispersed interferometry (EDI) at the Hale telescope at Mt. Palomar. Observations of stars were performed with the \"TEDI\" interferometer mounted within the central hole of the 200-in. primary mirror in series with the comounted TripleSpec near-infrared echelle spectrograph. These are the first multidelay EDI demonstrations on starlight, as earlier measurements used a single delay or laboratory sources. We demonstrate very high (10Ã) resolution boost, from original 2700 to 27,000 with current set of delays (up to 3 cm), well beyond the classical limits enforced by the slit width and detector pixel Nyquist limit. Significantly, the EDI used with multiple delays rather than a single delay as used previously yields an order of magnitude or more improvement in the stability against native spectrograph point spread function (PSF) drifts along the dispersion direction. We observe a dramatic (20Ã) reduction in sensitivity to PSF shift using our standard processing. A recently realized method of further reducing the PSF shift sensitivity to zero is described theoretically and demonstrated in a simple simulation which produces a 350Ã times reduction. We demonstrate superb rejection of fixed pattern noise due to bad detector pixels-EDI only responds to changes in pixel intensity synchronous to applied dithering. This part 1 describes data analysis, results, and instrument noise. A section on theoretical photon limited sensitivity is in a companion paper, part 2.\n\nSpectroscopic classification of Gaia17apq and Gaia17apv with Double Spectrograph on Palomar 200-inch telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlagorodnova, N.; Adams, S.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe report the classification of Gaia17apq and Gaia17apv (SN2017cao and SN2017cat), discovered by the Gaia ESA survey. The observations were performed on UT 2017-03-16 with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP; range 350-1000nm, spectral resolution R 4000) on Palomar 200-inch (P200) telescope.\n\nTWO DISTANT HALO VELOCITY GROUPS DISCOVERED BY THE PALOMAR TRANSIENT FACTORY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSesar, Branimir; Cohen, Judith G.; Levitan, David\n\n2012-08-20\n\nWe report the discovery of two new halo velocity groups (Cancer groups A and B) traced by eight distant RR Lyrae stars and observed by the Palomar Transient Factory survey at R.A. {approx} 129 Degree-Sign , decl. {approx} 20 Degree-Sign (l {approx} 205 Degree-Sign , b {approx} 32 Degree-Sign ). Located at 92 kpc from the Galactic center (86 kpc from the Sun), these are some of the most distant substructures in the Galactic halo known to date.

Keck Observatory 10 m Keck I telescope indicatemoreÂ Â» that the two groups are moving away from the Galaxy at v-bar{sub gsr}{sup A} = 78.0{+-}5.6 km s{sup -1} (Cancer group A) and v-bar{sub gsr}{sup B} = 16.3{+-}7.1 km s{sup -1} (Cancer group B). The groups have velocity dispersions of {sigma}{sub v{sub g{sub s{sub r}{sup A}}}} = 12.4{+-}5.0 km s{sup -1} and {sigma}B{sub v{sub g{sub s{sub r}{sup B}}}} =14.9{+-}6.2 km s{sup -1} and are spatially extended (about several kpc), making it very unlikely that they are bound systems, and more likely to be debris of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Both groups are metal-poor (median metallicities of [Fe/H]{sup A} = -1.6 dex and [Fe/H]{sup B} = -2.1 dex) and have a somewhat uncertain (due to small sample size) metallicity dispersion of {approx}0.4 dex, suggesting dwarf galaxies as progenitors. Two additional RR Lyrae stars with velocities consistent with those of the Cancer groups have been observed {approx}25 Degree-Sign east, suggesting possible extension of the groups in that direction.Â«Â less\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: BzJK observations around radio galaxies (Galametz+, 2009)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalametz, A.; De Breuck, C.; Vernet, J.; Stern, D.; Rettura, A.; Marmo, C.; Omont, A.; Allen, M.; Seymour, N.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nWe imaged the two targets using the Bessel B-band filter of the Large Format Camera (LFC) on the Palomar 5m Hale Telescope.

While low-resolution spectroscopic observations are incapable of observing the fine-scale structure of the spectral lines, the SpeX and TripleSpec spectral channels can be binned to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We observed HD 209458b's 2011 September 9 (UT) secondary eclipse for ~8 hr, resulting in 1210 exposures of 10 s each in an ABBA nodding sequence.

It is approximately 43 feet long, with a diameter of 10 feet at the forward end and 14 feet at the aft end. Weight at launch was approximately 25,000 pounds. In principle, it is no different than the reflecting telescopes in ground-based astronomical observatories. Like ground-based telescopes, the HST was designed as a general-purpose instrument, capable of using a wide variety of scientific instruments at its focal plane. This multi-purpose characteristic allows the HST to be used as a national facility, capable of supporting the astronomical needs of an international user community. The telescope s planned useful operational lifetime is 15 years, during which it will make observations in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared portions of the spectrum. The extended operational life of the HST is possible by using the capabilities of the Space Transportation System to periodically visit the HST on-orbit to replace failed or degraded components, install instruments with improved capabilities, re-boost the HST to higher altitudes compensating for gravitational effects, and to bring the HST back to Earth when the mission is terminated. The largest ground-based observatories, such as the 200-inch aperture Hale telescope at Palomar Mountain, California, can recognize detail in individual galaxies several billion light years away. However, like all earthbound devices, the Hale telescope is limited because of the blurring effect of the Earth s atmosphere. Further, the wavelength region observable from the Earth s surface is limited by the atmosphere to the visible part of the spectrum. The very important ultraviolet portion of the spectrum is lost. The HST uses a 2.4-meter reflective optics system designed to capture data over a wavelength region that reaches far into the ultraviolet and infrared portions of the spectrum.\n\nPalomar 60-inch SEDM classification of optical transients\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFremling, Christoffer; Blagorodnova, Nadejda; Neill, James D.; Walters, Richard; Cannella, Christopher B.; Kulkarni, Shrinivas R.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe report the classification of the following bright transients.

E.\n\n1999-05-01\n\nGrowing up in Chicago, George Ellery Hale, later the prime spirit in founding the AAS, was a precocious boy scientist. He was deeply interested in spectroscopy and astrophysics from an early age. His wealthy parents encouraged Hale's aspirations with magazines, books, and instruments, and he acquired his first telescope when he was 14. He knew as mentors classical astronomers S. W. Burnham and George W. Hough, but he preferred astrophysics and designed his own Kenwood Physical Obseervatory around a grating in a Rowland circle mounting, fed by a heliostat, both built for him by instrument-maker John A. Brashear. For his undergraduate thesis at MIT, Hale invented and (at Harvard College Observatory) demonstrated the spectroheliograph. With it, and a high-quality 12-in refractor at his later Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory (at the same site, the Hale family home, 4 miles from the present Hilton Hotel where the SPD, HAD and AAS are meeting) Hale did excellent solar research, especially on promineneces, flocculi, and the near-ultraviolet spectrum of the chromosphere. As a teen-ager and a young adult Hale traveled widely, and met several important piuoneer solar physicists, including Charles A. Young, Jules Janssen, Samuel P. Langley, and Henry Rowland. Hale designed Yerkes Observatory for solar and stellar research, and headed the solar work himself. One of his aims always was to compare other stars with the sun. Hale's telescopes, instruments, methods, and resulting papers will be described and illustrated by numerous slides.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: R-band light curves of type II supernovae (Rubin+, 2016)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRubin, A.; Gal-Yam, A.; De Cia, A.; Horesh, A.; Khazov, D.; Ofek, E.

They show amazingly strong activity of this unusual object, also at the present, very large distance from the Sun. The radio observations document in detail the release of various molecules from the comet's icy nucleus. Of particular interest is the observed emission from methanol ( CH 3 OH ) and hydrogen cyanide ( HCN ) molecules, never before detected in any comet this far away. Comet Hale-Bopp still going strong Just over 18 months after its perihelion passage on April 1, 1997, Comet Hale-Bopp (official designation C/1995 O1 ) is continuing its outward journey through the Solar System. It is now about 1,000 million kilometres (6.7 AU) from the Sun and the Earth, i.e. almost at the same distance as when it was first discovered in July 1995. After having traversed the northern sky in 1996 and 1997, the comet passed the celestial equator in late June 1997 and is now seen in the southern constellation Volans (The Flying Fish), i.e. just east of the Large Magellanic Cloud. It can only be observed from southern latitudes. The comet's brightness has decreased by a factor of more than 10,000 since it was at its brightest in March 1997, just before perihelion. However, the magnitude is still around 9 - 10, or only about 20-40 times fainter than what can be seen with the unaided eye. Hale-Bopp is therefore visible in binoculars to southern observers as a fuzzy object with a diameter of a few arcminutes. New observations from La Silla Several telescopes at La Silla are following the evolution of the activity of Comet Hale-Bopp as it recedes from the Sun. In particular, the comet is observed monthly with SEST , a 15-m diameter submillimetre telescope operated jointly by the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden) and ESO; it is the only\n\nHubble Sees Material Ejected From Comet Hale-Bopp\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThese NASA Hubble Space Telescope pictures of comet Hale-Bopp show a remarkable 'pinwheel' pattern and a blob of free-flying debris near the nucleus. The bright clump of light along the spiral (above the nucleus, which is near the center of the frame) may be a piece of the comet's icy crust that was ejected into space by a combination of ice evaporation and the comet's rotation, and which then disintegrated into a bright cloud of particles.\n\nAlthough the 'blob' is about 3.5 times fainter than the brightest portion at the nucleus, the lump appears brighter because it covers a larger area. The debris follows a spiral pattern outward because the solid nucleus is rotating like a lawn sprinkler, completing a single rotation about once per week. Ground-based observations conducted over the past two months have documented at least two separate episodes of jet and pinwheel formation and fading. By coincidence, the first Hubble images of Hale-Bopp, taken on September 26, 1995, immediately followed one of these outbursts and allow researchers to examine it at unprecedented detail. For the first time they see a clear separation between the nucleus and some of the debris being shed. By putting together information from the Hubble images and those taken during the recent outburst using the 82 cm telescope of the Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain), astronomers find that the debris is moving away from the nucleus at a speed (projected on the sky) of about 68 miles per hour (109 kilometers per hour). The Hubble observations will be used to determine if Hale-Bopp is really a giant comet or rather a more moderate-sized object whose current activity is driven by outgassing from a very volatile ice which will 'burn out' over the next year. Comet Hale-Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995 by amateur astronomers Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp. Though this comet is still well outside the orbit of Jupiter (almost 600 million miles, or one billion kilometers from Earth\n\nPalomar 13: An Unusual Stellar System in the Galactic Halo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCÃ´tÃ©, Patrick; Djorgovski, S. G.; Meylan, G.; Castro, Sandra; McCarthy, J. K.\n\n2002-08-01\n\nWe report the first results of a program to study the internal kinematics of globular clusters in the outer halo of the Milky Way. Using the Keck telescope and High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, we have measured precise radial velocities for 30 candidate red giants in the direction of Palomar 13, an object traditionally cataloged as a compact, low-luminosity globular cluster. We have combined these radial velocities with published proper motion membership probabilities and new CCD photometry from the Keck and Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes to isolate a sample of 21 probable members. We find a systemic velocity of s=24.1+/-0.5 km s-1 and a projected, intrinsic velocity dispersion of Ïp=2.2+/-0.4 km s-1. Although modest, this dispersion is nevertheless several times larger than that expected for a globular cluster of this luminosity and central concentration. Taken at face value, it implies a mass-to-light ratio of Î¥V=40+24-17 based on the best-fit King-Michie model. The surface density profile of Palomar 13 also appears unusual compared to most Galactic globular clusters; depending upon the details of background subtraction and model-fitting, Palomar 13 either contains a substantial population of ``extratidal'' stars, or is considerably more spatially extended than previously suspected. The full surface density profile is equally well fitted by a King-Michie model having a high concentration and large tidal radius, or by a Navarro-Frenk-White model. We examine-and tentatively reject-a number of possible origins for the observed characteristics of Palomar 13 (e.g., velocity ``jitter'' among the red giant branch stars, spectroscopic binary stars, nonstandard mass functions, modified Newtonian dynamics) and conclude that the two leading explanations are either catastrophic heating during a recent perigalacticon passage or the presence of a dark matter halo. The available evidence therefore suggests that Palomar 13 is either a globular cluster that is now in\n\nTesting Fundamental Physics with Distant Star Clusters: Analysis of Observational Data on Palomar 14\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJordi, K.; Grebel, E. K.; Hilker, M.; Baumgardt, H.; Frank, M.; Kroupa, P.; Haghi, H.; CÃ´tÃ©, P.; Djorgovski, S. G.\n\n2009-06-01\n\nWe use the distant outer halo globular cluster Palomar 14 as a test case for classical versus modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Previous theoretical calculations have shown that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion predicted by these theories can differ by up to a factor of 3 for such sparse, remote clusters like Pal 14. We determine the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of Palomar 14 by measuring radial velocities of 17 red giant cluster members obtained using the Very Large Telescope and Keck telescope. The systemic velocity of Palomar 14 is (72.28 Â± 0.12) km s-1. The derived velocity dispersion of (0.38 Â± 0.12) km s-1 of the 16 definite member stars is in agreement with the theoretical prediction for the classical Newtonian case according to Baumgardt et al. In order to exclude the possibility that a peculiar mass function might have influenced our measurements, we derived the cluster's main-sequence mass function down to 0.53 M sun using archival images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We found a mass function slope of Î± = 1.27 Â± 0.44, which is, compared to the canonical mass function, a significantly shallower slope. The derived lower limit on the cluster's mass is higher than the theoretically predicted mass in the case of MOND. Our data are consistent with a central density of Ï0 = 0.1 M sun pc-3. We need no dark matter in Palomar 14. If the cluster is on a circular orbit, our spectroscopic and photometric results argue against MOND, unless the cluster experienced significant mass loss. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M.

P.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWe present quantitative measurements of cometary [C I] 9850 Ã emission obtained during observations of comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) in 1997 March and April. The observations were carried out using a high-resolution (Î»/ÎÎ»~40,000) Fabry-PÃ©rot/CCD spectrometer at the McMath-Pierce Solar telescope on Kitt Peak. This forbidden line, the carbon analog of [O I] 6300 Ã , is emitted in the radiative decay of C(1D) atoms. In the absence of other sources and sinks, [C I] 9850 Ã emission can be used as a direct tracer of CO photodissociation in comets. However, in Hale-Bopp's large, dense coma, other processes, such as collisional excitation of ground-state C(3P), dissociative recombination of CO+, and collisional dissociation of CO and CO2 may produce significant amounts of C(1D). The long C(1D) radiative lifetime (~4000 s) makes collisional deexcitation (quenching) the primary loss mechanism in the inner coma. Thus, a detailed, self-consistent global model of collisional and photochemical interactions is necessary to fully account for [C I] 9850 Ã emission in comet Hale-Bopp.\n\nThe Wisconsin/GSFC Hale-Bopp Observing Campaign\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScherb, F.; Roesler, F.

We have designed and fabricated a camera specifically for high resolution imaging. This camera has now been pressed into service at the prime focus of the Hale 5 m telescope. We have concentrated on two techniques: the Non-Redundant Masking (NRM) and Weigelt's Fully Filled Aperture (FFA) method. The former is the optical analog of radio interferometry and the latter is a higher order extension of the Labeyrie autocorrelation method. As in radio Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), both these techniques essentially measure the closure phase and, hence, true image construction is possible. We have successfully imaged binary stars and asteroids with angular resolution approaching the diffraction limit of the telescope and image quality approaching that of a typical radio VLBI map. In addition, we have carried out analytical and simulation studies to determine the ultimate limits of ground-based optical imaging, the limits of space-based interferometric imaging, and investigated the details of imaging tradeoffs of beam combination in optical interferometers.\n\nCoordinated Observations of Comet Hale-Bopp between 32 and 860 GHz\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBieging, J.

L.; Sievers, A.; Thum, C.; Wink, J.; Zylka, R.\n\n1997-12-01\n\nThe concept of simultaneous multifrequency continuum observations, successfully tested on Comet Hyakutake, was applied to Comet Hale-Bopp, using the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (HHT) with the four color bolometer between 250 and 870 GHz; the IRAM 30m telescope at 250 GHz; the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer near 90 and 240 GHz; and the MPIfR 100m telescope at 32 GHz. Near-simultaneous measurements were done between 1997 February 15 and 1997 April 26, mainly concentrated in mid-March shortly before perigee of the comet. The measurements gave the following preliminary results: (a) interferometer detection of the nuclear continuum emission. The derived mean diameter is of the order of 50 km. (b) a radio halo with a gaussian HPW of ~ 11 arcsec , corresponding to a diameter of 11000 km at geocentric distance of 1.2 A.U. (c) a spectral index (SI) of ~ 3.0 of the total signal, indicating a particle size distribution in the radio halo between 0.1 and 3 mm. Assuming an average cometary density of 0.5 g cm(-3) , the mass contained in the nucleus is about 3x 10(19) g and 10(12) g in the particle halo, inferred from the SI. A more detailed analysis is under way, which includes corrections for the various calibration scales at the different telescopes and the possible contamination of the observed bolometer signal by molecular line emission. We will report on the results of this analysis and the implications for the mm -- submm wavelength radio spectrum of Comet Hale-Bopp.\n\nThe Hale Effect\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGray, Katti\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOhio State University's (OSU) Frank W.

M.; Morgenthaler, J. P.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWe present quantitative measurements of cometary [C I] 9850 A, emission obtained during observations of comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) in 1997 March and April. The observations were carried out using a high-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda approx. 40,000) Fabry-Perot/CCD spectrometer at the McMath-Pierce solar telescope on Kitt Peak. This forbidden line, the carbon analog of [O I] 6300 A, is emitted in the radiative decay of C(1D) atoms. In the absence of other sources and sinks, [C I] 9850 A emission may be used as a direct tracer of CO photodissociation in comets. However, in Hale-Bopp's large, dense coma, other processes, such as collisional excitation of ground-state C(3P), dissociative recombination of CO+, and collisional dissociation of CO and CO2 may produce significant amounts of C(1D). The long C(1D) radiative lifetime (approx. 4000 s) makes collisional de-excitation (quenching) the primary loss mechanism in the inner coma. Thus, a detailed, self-consistent global model of collisional and photochemical interactions is necessary to fully account for [C I] 9850 A emission in comet Hale-Bopp.\n\nDiscovery and Classification of Optical Transient in M81 : P60- M81-081203\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKasliwal, M.

Through direct imaging we have discovered a brown dwarf and two low-mass stellar companions to the young solar-type stars HD 49197, HD 129333 (EK Dra), and V522 Per and confirmed a previously suspected companion to RX J0329.1+0118 (Sterzik et al.), at respective separations of 0.95\" (43 AU), 0.74\" (25 AU), 2.09\" (400 AU), and 3.78\" (380 AU). Physical association of each binary system is established through common proper motion and/or low-resolution infrared spectroscopy. Based on the companion spectral types, we estimate their masses at 0.06, 0.20, 0.13, and 0.20 Msolar, respectively. From analysis of our imaging data combined with archival radial velocity data, we find that the spatially resolved companion to HD 129333 is potentially identical to the previously identified spectroscopic companion to this star (Duquennoy & Mayor). However, a discrepancy with the absolute magnitude suggests that the two companions could also be distinct, with the resolved one being the outermost component of a triple system. The brown dwarf HD 49197B is a new member of a growing list of directly imaged substellar companions at 10-1000 AU separations from main-sequence stars, indicating that such brown dwarfs may be more common than initially speculated.\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory: Introduction and Data Release\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSurace, Jason Anthony\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a synoptic sky survey in operation since 2009. PTF utilizes a 7.1 square degree camera on the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope to survey the sky primarily at a single wavelength (R-band) at a rate of 1000-3000 square degrees a night, to a depth of roughly 20.5. The data are used to detect and study transient and moving objects such as gamma ray bursts, supernovae and asteroids, as well as variable phenomena such as quasars and Galactic stars. The data processing system handles realtime processing and detection of transients, solar system object processing, high photometric precision processing and light curve generation, and long-term archiving and curation. Although a significant scientific installation in of itself, PTF also serves as the prototype for our next generation project, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Beginning operations in 2017, ZTF will feature a 50 square degree camera which will enable scanning of the entire northern visible sky every night. ZTF in turn will serve as a stepping stone to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).We announce the availability of the second PTF public data release, which includes epochal images and catalogs, as well as deep (coadded) reference images and associated catalogs, for the majority of the northern sky. The epochal data span the time period from 2009 through 2012, with various cadences and coverages, typically in the tens or hundreds for most points on the sky. The data are available through both a GUI and software API portal at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at Caltech. The PTF and current iPTF projects are multi-partner multi-national collaborations.\n\nISO's analysis of Comet Hale-Bopp\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n1997-03-01\n\nThe European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory ISO inspected Comet Hall-Bopp during the spring and autumn of 1996. The need to keep ISO's telescope extremely cold restricts the spacecraft's pointing in relation to the Sun and the Earth and it ruled out observations at other times. The analyses of the 1996 observations are not yet complete, but already they give new insight into the nature of comets. Comet Hale-Bopp is believed to be a large comet with a nucleus up to 40 kilometres wide. It was discovered in July 1995 by two American astronomers working independently, Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp. At that time, the comet was a billion kilometres away from the Sun, but 200 times brighter than Halley's Comet was, when at a comparable distance. Comet Hale-Bopp will make its closest approach to the Earth on 22 March, and its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on 1 April 1997. Some scientific results from ISO The discovery of Comet Hale-Bopp occurred before ISO's launch in November 1995. When first observed by ISO in March and April 1996, the comet was still 700 million kilometres from the Sun, and almost as far from the Earth and ISO. With its privileged view of infrared wavebands inaccessible from the Earth's surface, ISO's photometer ISOPHOT discovered that carbon dioxide was an important constituent of the comet's emissions of vapour.ISOPHOT measured the temperature of the dust cloud around Comet Hale-Bopp. In March 1996, when the comet was still more than 700 million kilometres from the Sun, the dust cloud was at minus 120 degrees C. When ISOPHOT made similar observations in October 1996, the comet was 420 million kilometres from the Sun, and the dust cloud had warmed to about minus 50 degrees C. Intensive observations of Comet Hale-Bopp were also made by ISO's Short-Wave Spectrometer SWS, the Long-Wave Spectrometer LWS, and the ISOPHOT spectrometer PHOT-S. Results are due for publication at the end of March. They will give details about the composition\n\nSimulated Guide Stars: Adapting the Robo-AO Telescope Simulator to UH 88â\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAshcraft, Jaren; Baranec, Christoph\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRobo-AO is an autonomous adaptive optics system that is in development for the UH 88â Telescope on the Mauna Kea Observatory. This system is capable of achieving near diffraction limited imaging for astronomical telescopes, and has seen successful deployment and use at the Palomar and Kitt Peak Observatories previously. A key component of this system, the telescope simulator, will be adapted from the Palomar Observatory design to fit the UH 88â Telescope. The telescope simulator will simulate the exit pupil of the UH 88â telescope so that the greater Robo-AO system can be calibrated before observing runs. The system was designed in Code V, and then further improved upon in Zemax for later development. Alternate design forms were explored for the potential of adapting the telescope simulator to the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, where simulating the exit pupil of the telescope proved to be more problematic. A proposed design composed of solely catalog optics was successfully produced for both telescopes, and they await assembly as time comes to construct the new Robo-AO system.\n\nPalomar College: A Technological Transformation.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHalttunen, Lynda Gavigan\n\n2002-01-01\n\nOffers advice for colleges intending to undergo software conversions, asserting that sufficient resources are key to a smooth process.

R.; Santana, F. A.; Simon, J. D.; CÃ´tÃ©, P.; Stetson, P. B.; Kirby, E.; Djorgovski, S. G.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nWe present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry for the Milky Way globular cluster Palomar 13. We triple the number of spectroscopically confirmed members, including many repeat velocity measurements. Palomar 13 is the only known globular cluster with possible evidence for dark matter, based on a Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer 21 star velocity dispersion of Ï = 2.2 Â± 0.4 km s-1. We reproduce this measurement, but demonstrate that it is inflated by unresolved binary stars. For our sample of 61 stars, the velocity dispersion is Ï = 0.7+0.6 -0.5 km s-1. Combining our DEIMOS data with literature values, our final velocity dispersion is Ï = 0.4+0.4 -0.3 km s-1. We determine a spectroscopic metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.6 Â± 0.1 dex, placing a 1Ï upper limit of Ï[Fe/H] ~ 0.2 dex on any internal metallicity spread. We determine Palomar 13's total luminosity to be MV = -2.8 Â± 0.4, making it among the least luminous known globular clusters. The photometric isophotes are regular out to the half-light radius and mildly irregular outside this radius. The outer surface brightness profile slope is shallower than typical globular clusters (Î£vpropr Î·, Î· = -2.8 Â± 0.3). Thus at large radius, tidal debris is likely affecting the appearance of Palomar 13. Combining our luminosity with the intrinsic velocity dispersion, we find a dynamical mass of M 1/2 = 1.3+2: 7 -1.3 Ã 103 M â and a mass-to-light ratio of M/LV = 2.4+5.0 -2.4 M â/L â. Within our measurement errors, the mass-to-light ratio agrees with the theoretical predictions for a single stellar population. We conclude that, while there is some evidence for tidal stripping at large radius, the dynamical mass of Palomar 13 is consistent with its stellar mass and neither significant dark matter, nor extreme tidal heating, is required to explain the cluster dynamics. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a\n\nBernhard Schmidt and the Schmidt Telescope for Mapping the Sky\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolfschmidt, G.\n\nBernhard Voldemar Schmidt (1879--1935) was born in Estonia. He ran an optical workshop in Mittweida, Saxonia, between 1901 and 1927. Astronomers appreciated the quality of his telescopes. Starting in 1925, working freelance in Hamburg Observatory, he developed a short focal length optical system with a large field of view. He succeeded in inventing the ``Schmidt Telescope'' in 1930, which allows the imaging a large field of the sky without any distortions. Shortly after Schmidt's death, the director of the observatory published details on the invention and production of the Schmidt Telescope. After World War II, Schmidt telescopes have been widely used. The first large Schmidt telescope was built in 1948, the ``Big Schmidt'' (126 cm), Mount Palomar, USA. Schmidt telescopes are also important tools for cosmology. The result of the Palomar Observatory Sky Surveys (1949--1958, 1985--1999) is a data base of about 20 million galaxies and over 100 million stars, supplemented in 1971 by the ESO Schmidt for the southern sky. Also high resolution spectrometers can be fitted to the Schmidt telescope. The 80 cm Schmidt telescope of Hamburg Observatory, planned since 1936, finished 1955, is on Calar Alto, Spain, since 1975. Combined with two objective prisms, it was used for a Quasar survey project.\n\nHubble Images of Comet Hale-Bopp\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis is a series of Hubble Space Telescope observations of the region around the nucleus of Hale-Bopp, taken on eight different dates since September 1995. They chronicle changes in the evolution of the nucleus as it moves ever closer to, and is warmed by, the sun.\n\nThe first picture in the sequence, seen at upper left shows a strong dust outburst on the comet that occurred when it was beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Images in the Fall of 1996 show multiple jets that are presumably connected to the activation of multiple vents on the surface of the nucleus. In these false color images, taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, the faintest regions are black, the brightest regions are white, and intermediate intensities are represented by different levels of red. All images are processed at the same spatial scale of 280 miles per pixel (470 kilometers), so the solid nucleus, no larger than 25 miles across, is far below Hubble's resolution. The Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 was developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and managed by the Goddard Spaced Flight Center for NASA's Office of Space Science.

PTF11kmb was discovered in data taken with the 48 inch Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory (P48) on 2011 August 16.25 at a magnitude r=19.8mag. A spectrum was taken with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the 10m Keck I telescope on 2011 August 28, showing SN features consistent with a SN Ib at a redshift z=0.017. The source PTF12bho was discovered in P48 data on 2012 February 25.25 at a magnitude of r=20.52mag. A spectrum taken with LRIS on 2012 March 15 yields z=0.023 based on the SN features. We obtained R- and g-band photometry of PTF11kmb and PTF12bho with the P48 CFH12K camera. Additional follow-up photometry was conducted with the automated 60-inch telescope at Palomar (P60) in the Bgri bands, and with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Faulkes Telescope North in gri. PTF12bho was also observed with the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) and the Swift X-ray telescope (XRT) on 2012 March 17.8 for 3ks. We obtained a sequence of spectra for both PTF11kmb and PTF12bho using LRIS on Keck I, the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the 10m Keck II telescope, and the Double Spectrograph (DPSP) on the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory (P200) spanning 2011 Aug 28.5 to 2014 Jul 2.5. We obtained deep imaging of the fields of PTF11kmb using WFC3/UVIS on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through program GO-13864 (PI Kasliwal) in 2015 Jul 12. This program also covered the field of SN 2005E (2014 Dec 10). (1 data file).\n\nIt Started with George Ellery Hale\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParker, E. N.\n\n1999-05-01\n\nWith his invention of the spectroheliograph, showing the structure and activity of the surface of the Sun, and with his spectroscopic determination of the magnetic character of the sunspot, Hale initiated a line of research that has brought us deeper into the mysteries of the Sun with each passing decade. The flare is perhaps the most spectacular aspect of the activity, along with the more recently discovered coronal mass ejection. However, we must not overlook the spectacular revelation, by Grotrian, Edlen, and Lyot, that the outer atmosphere of the Sun has a temperature of a million or more degrees K, providing both radio and X-ray emission. It is all too often forgotten in these heady times that, while we have a number of plausible ideas about how things work, there is not yet a clear understanding of why a late main sequence star should exhibit such effects. Magnetic fields generated by some form of MHD dynamo appear to initiate the suprathermal activity in all its many forms. The intensely fibril form of the magnetic fields seems to be a clue to the nature of the dynamo process, and the first observational priority now is to develop a 4m telescope with an adaptive optics system that can properly resolve the individual fibrils at the visible surface (0.1\" or better)to determine their behavior. Indeed the nature of the sunspot, the faculae and plages,the microflare, etc. all lie at the limits of telescopic resolution. The varying brightness of the Sun seems to be a byproduct of the magnetic activity, and besides the consequences for the climate at Earth, provides another baffling clue to the puzzle. We cannot guess what further marvels will be discovered before the puzzle is resolved in hard scientific terms, but we may be certain that Hale would have been enchanted, and probably leading the charge, were he alive today.\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory: High Quality Realtime Data Processing in a Cost-Constrained Environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSurace, J.; Laher, R.; Masci, F.; Grillmair, C.; Helou, G.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a synoptic sky survey in operation since 2009.

We present results from Palomar 5 m observations of the open cluster NGC 2420 in which we measure some of the sources of noise that will be present in an astrometric search for extrasolar planets. This is the first time that such a large aperture has been used for high-precision astrometry. We find that the atmospheric noise is 150 micro-arcsec hr(exp 1/2) across a 90 sec field of view and that differential chromatic refraction (DCR) can be calibrated to 128 micro-arcsec for observations within 1 hr of the meridian and 45 deg of zenith. These results confirm that a model for astrometric measurements can be extrapolated to large apertures. We demonstrate, based upon these results, that a large telescope achieves the sensitivity required to perform a statistically significant search for extra solar planets. We describe an astrometric technique to detect planets, the astrometric signals expected, the role of reference stars, and the sources of measurement noise: photometric noise, atmospheric motion between stars, sky background, instrumental noise, and DCR. For the latter, we discuss a method to reduce the noise further to 66 micro-arcsecond for observations within 1 hr of the meridian and 45 deg of zenith. We discuss optimal lists of target stars taken from the latest Gliese & Jahreiss catalog of nearby stars with the largest potential astrometric signals, declination limits for both telescope accessibility and reduced DCR, and galactic latitude limits for a sufficiant number of reference stars. Two samples are described from which one can perform statistically significant searches for gas giant planets around nearby stars. One sample contains 100 \"solar class\" stars with an average stellar mass of 0.82 solar mass; the other maximizes the number of stars, 574, by searching mainly low-mass M stars.

The field of view was 6 arcmin. Spectra with good signal-to-noise were obtained for the emission lines [O I] 6300 Angstroms, HÎ± (6563 Angstroms), and [C I] 9850 Angstroms. On several of these nights, complementary [O I] 6300 Angstroms observations were simultaneously obtained with the Wisconsin HÎ± Mapper (WHÎ± M) at Kitt Peak. Additional [O I] 6300 Angstroms observations were also obtained in September 1996. These [C I] 9850 Angstroms observations are the first extensive data set of this cometary line.

Through illuminating thoughts and reflections based on observations, for instance, of sea waves, Mr. Palomar discovers that they induce a peaceful and inspirational state of mind that prevents coronary and mental illnesses, and also holds the key to capturing the complexity of the world reducing it into its most elementary mechanisms. In this contribution I will survey some of Mr. Palomar's thoughts while he observes the sky and speculate on others that he might have explored if he shared our contemporary knowledge of the cosmos. I will also discuss the thoughts of other authors on how, cosmological thinking affects the human condition.\n\nThe Palomar Testbed Interferometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nColavita, M.

PTI implements a dual-star architecture, tracking two stars simultaneously for phase referencing and narrow-angle astrometry. The three fixed 40 cm apertures can be combined pairwise to provide baselines to 110 m. The interferometer actively tracks the white-light fringe using an array detector at 2.2 microns and active delay lines with a range of +/-38 m. Laser metrology of the delay lines allows for servo control, and laser metrology of the complete optical path enables narrow-angle astrometric measurements. The instrument is highly automated, using a multiprocessing computer system for instrument control and sequencing.\n\nLOOKING ALONG HALE ALII AVENUE TOWARD SHIPYARD AREA.

M.; Nordsieck, K. H.; Scherb, F.; Mierkiwicz, E. J.; Morgenthaler, J. P.; Oliversen, R. J.\n\n1998-09-01\n\nA series of unique observartions of CO and its daughter products that were obtained simultaneously as part of the University of Wisconsin/Goddard Space Flight Center Hale-Bopp campaign are presented. CO is the second most abundant volatile species in the coma of comets, one that actually dominates production at large heliocentric distances, however its photchemical evolution is poorly understood due to the lack of good emission line tracers in the visible. On 8 April, 1997, we obtained wide field simultaneous observations of CI (1657 Angstroms) intensity and polarization from a sounding rocket, OI (6300 Angstroms) emission using the Wisconsin HÎ± Mapper (WHaM) facility, and measurements using the McMath-Pierce Solar telescope of CI (9850 Angstroms) emission at different points in the inner coma. Combined, these data contain information on the radial distribution, source function, equilibrium structure, photochemical lifetime of CO, and the outflow speed of its C and O daughter products. Combined, these results suggest rapid dissociation of CO in the collisionally thick inner coma of Hale-Bopp, followed by a high velocity outflow of the daughter products. Both results suggest some discrepancies with expectations, and we discuss their implications.\n\nNotes on Species of the Lichen Genus Canoparmelia Elix & Hale in South Korea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJayalal, Udeni; Joshi, Santosh; Oh, Soon-Ok; Park, Jung-Shin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDetailed descriptions of five species of the lichen genus Canoparmelia Elix & Hale. are presented.

S.\n\n1997-06-01\n\nThe comet Hale-Bopp has provided a great opportunity to astrophysicists. It is bright and it has been available for observations for a long period of time. A good number of large telescopes all over the northern hemisphere have been deployed for observations of this comet. Within a month of its discovery came the first result that the comet was quite active even when it was beyond Jupiter. Jets of gas and dust continued to stream out one after the other. This created the suspicion that the magnitude estimates may turn out to be only the limits rather than the actual values. The anxiety, so created disappeared only when the comet reached the visibility limits in late 1996. By the time it reached the perihelion on April 1, it was not fooling around anymore and kept up the promise of a 'civilized comet', the one that could be located without a finding chart. As is well known, the magnitude after the perihelion passage, would be slightly higher than the estimated value. The two-tail structure was first noticed a few months prior to the perihelion. The gradation in colour from blue of the ion tail to yellow of the dust tail was quite conspicuous. A simple binocular could easily resolve the two. Interestingly, just after the perihelion, there was a flare and the associated storm on the sun due to which a temporary increase in the solar wind particle density can occur. It would be extremely interesting to find the related effects on the tail, especially on the ion component. The solar and cometary physicists are (as on April 26th) eagerly looking forward to monitoring the changes. The ion tail has grown to about 15 degrees in the sky and is expected to get disrupted after the solar storm. On the other hand, the dust tail which grew to a full length of 45 degrees offered a glorious sight in the evening sky. The new moon at the time of perihelion enhanced the spectacle. In the middle of April quite suddenly, a third tail, a sharp yellow one, showed up. This was attributed\n\nNeptune Clouds and Methane, from Ground-Based Visible and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy with Adaptive Optics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTice, D. S.; Irwin, P. G. J.; Houghton, R. W. C.; Fletcher, L. N.; Clarke, F.; Hurley, J.; Thatte, N.; Tecza, M.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nObservations of Neptune were made in June/July 2012 with the SWIFT integral field spectrometer at the Palomar Observatory's 200-inch Hale Telescope. Spectral resolutions for observations between 0.65 Î¼m and 1.0 Î¼m were R â¥ 3250. Palomar's PALM-3000 adaptive optics system enabled images of the full Neptunian disc to be recorded at a spatial scale of 0.08\"Â·pixel^-1 with a seeing of approximately 0.30\" - 0.40\". Retrievals of cloud properties and methane abundance in the highly dynamic atmosphere were obtained with the general-purpose retrieval tool, NEMESIS. The short wavelengths of the observations allowed for good characterisation of the scattering particles' optical properties in the many cloud and haze layers of the upper Neptunian atmosphere. A region of relatively low methane absorption and high collision-induced hydrogen quadrupole absorption at 825 nm further constrains spectral properties of clouds as distinguished from those of methane absorption.\n\nThe Oxford SWIFT Spectrograph: first commissioning and on-sky results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThatte, Niranjan; Tecza, Mathias; Clarke, Fraser; Goodsall, Timothy; Fogarty, Lisa; Houghton, Ryan; Salter, Graeme; Scott, Nicholas; Davies, Roger L.; Bouchez, Antonin; Dekany, Richard\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe Oxford SWIFT spectrograph, an I & z band (6500-10500 A) integral field spectrograph, is designed to operate as a facility instrument at the 200 inch Hale Telescope on Palomar Mountain, in conjunction with the Palomar laser guide star adaptive optics system PALAO (and its upgrade to PALM3000). SWIFT provides spectra at R(â¡Î»/âµÎ»)~4000 of a contiguous two-dimensional field, 44 x 89 spatial pixels (spaxels) in size, at spatial scales of 0.235\", 0.16\", and 0.08\" per spaxel. It employs two 250Î¼m thick, fully depleted, extremely red sensitive 4k X 2k CCD detector arrays (manufactured by LBNL) that provide excellent quantum efficiency out to 1000 nm. We describe the commissioning observations and present the measured values of a number of instrument parameters. We also present some first science results that give a taste of the range of science programs where SWIFT can have a substantial impact.\n\nSearch for optical pulsations in PSR J0337+1715\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nStrader, M. J.; Archibald, A. M.; Meeker, S. R.; ...\n\n2016-03-20\n\nIn this study, we report on a search for optical pulsations from PSR J0337+1715 at its observed radio pulse period. PSR J0337+1715 is a millisecond pulsar (2.7 ms spin period) in a triple hierarchical system with two white dwarfs, and has a known optical counterpart with g-band magnitude 18. The observations were done with the Array Camera for Optical to Near-IR Spectrophotometry (ARCONS) at the 200\" Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. No significant pulsations were found in the range 4000-11000 angstroms, and we can limit pulsed emission in g-band to be fainter than 25 mag.\n\nVibration and aeroelastic analysis of highly flexible HALE aircraft\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, Chong-Seok\n\nThe highly flexible HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) aircraft analysis methodology is of interest because early studies indicated that HALE aircraft might have different vibration and aeroelastic characteristics from those of conventional aircraft. Recently the computer code Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE Aircraft (NATASHA) was developed under NASA sponsorship. NATASHA can predict the flight dynamics and aeroelastic behavior for HALE aircraft with a flying wing configuration. Further analysis improvements for NATASHA were required to extend its capability to the ground vibration test (GVT) environment and to both GVT and aeroelastic behavior of HALE aircraft with other configurations. First, the analysis methodology, based on geometrically exact fully intrinsic beam theory, was extended to treat other aircraft cofigurations. Conventional aircraft with flexible fuselage and tail can now be modeled by treating the aircraft as an assembly of beam elements. NATASHA is now applicable to any aircraft cofiguration that can be modeled this way. The intrinsic beam formulation, which is a fundamental structural modeling approach, is now capable of being applying to a structure consisting of multiple beams by relating the virtual displacements and rotations at points where two or more beam elements are connected to each other. Additional aspects are also considered in the analysis such as auxiliary elevator input in the horizontal tail and fuselage aerodynamics. Second, the modeling approach was extended to treat the GVT environment for HALE aircraft, which have highly flexible wings. GVT has its main purpose to provide modal characteristics for model validation. A bungee formulation was developed by the augmented Lagrangian method and coupled to the intrinsic beam formulation for the GVT modeling. After the coupling procedure, the whole formulation cannot be fully intrinsic because the geometric constraint by bungee cords makes the system statically\n\nStructurally Integrated Antenna Concepts for HALE UAVs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCravey, Robin L.; Vedeler, Erik; Goins, Larry; Young, W. Robert; Lawrence, Roland W.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis technical memorandum describes work done in support of the Multifunctional Structures and Materials Team under the Vehicle Systems Program's ITAS (Integrated Tailored Aero Structures) Project during FY 2005. The Electromagnetics and Sensors Branch (ESB) developed three ultra lightweight antenna concepts compatible with HALE UAVs (High Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). ESB also developed antenna elements that minimize the interaction between elements and the vehicle to minimize the impact of wing flexure on the EM (electromagnetic) performance of the integrated array. In addition, computer models were developed to perform phase correction for antenna arrays whose elements are moving relative to each other due to wing deformations expected in HALE vehicle concepts. Development of lightweight, conformal or structurally integrated antenna elements and compensating for the impact of a lightweight, flexible structure on a large antenna array are important steps in the realization of HALE UAVs for microwave applications such as passive remote sensing and communications.\n\nWarm Spitzer and Palomar near-IR secondary eclipse photometry of two hot Jupiters: WASP-48b and HAT-P-23b\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nO'Rourke, Joseph G.; Knutson, Heather A.; DÃ©sert, Jean-Michel\n\n2014-02-01\n\nWe report secondary eclipse photometry of two hot Jupiters, WASP-48b and HAT-P-23b, at 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m taken with the InfraRed Array Camera aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope during the warm Spitzer mission and in the H and K{sub S} bands with the Wide Field IR Camera at the Palomar 200 inch Hale Telescope. WASP-48b and HAT-P-23b are Jupiter-mass and twice Jupiter-mass objects orbiting an old, slightly evolved F star and an early G dwarf star, respectively. In the H, K{sub S} , 3.6 Î¼m, and 4.5 Î¼m bands, respectively, we measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.047% Â± 0.016%, 0.109%moreÂ Â» Â± 0.027%, 0.176% Â± 0.013%, and 0.214% Â± 0.020% for WASP-48b. In the K{sub S} , 3.6 Î¼m, and 4.5 Î¼m bands, respectively, we measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.234% Â± 0.046%, 0.248% Â± 0.019%, and 0.309% Â± 0.026% for HAT-P-23b. For WASP-48b and HAT-P-23b, respectively, we measure delays of 2.6 Â± 3.9 minutes and 4.0 Â± 2.4 minutes relative to the predicted times of secondary eclipse for circular orbits, placing 2Ï upper limits on |ecos Ï| of 0.0053 and 0.0080, both of which are consistent with circular orbits.
