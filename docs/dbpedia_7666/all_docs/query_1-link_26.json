        "text": "If a candidate is successful in the testing process, his or her name will be ranked on an employment list in score order. (For example, if a score of 94 is the highest score, all candidates receiving 94 are placed in \"rank 1\"; if 91 is the second highest score, all candidates receiving 91 are placed in \"rank 2\"; etc.). Successful candidates remain on the employment list for the period stated on the exam bulletin.\n\nDOR hiring supervisors may interview candidates on an employment list, but can only hire candidates within the top three reachable ranks of the list.\n\nWhen applying for positions, it’s very important to follow directions as described in the Job Advertisement and apply by the final filing date. Applications received by the final filing date are reviewed by the hiring supervisor and the most qualified candidates are notified of their interview date, location, and time. The interview usually involves a panel consisting of the hiring supervisor and one or two other managers or subject matter experts asking candidates several job-related questions specific to the position. The hiring process concludes with DOR selecting the most qualified candidate for the position.\n\nThe selection process for every state position requires an evaluation of an applicant’s education, experience, abilities, and knowledge. To apply for an exam, candidates must complete an examination application (California State Examination/Employment Application Form 678), available when setting up a profile on CalHR’s CalCareers page.\n\nExaminations consist of various testing methods and are described on the \"examination bulletin\" or announcement. The most common tests consist of oral and written components. Applicants that aren't yet State of California employees are eligible for \"open\" exams only. Candidates should review the exam bulletin for:\n\nMinimum qualifications for entrance to the exam\n\nCivil Service classification information\n\nExamination and position information\n\nCalHR Exam Search Results"
