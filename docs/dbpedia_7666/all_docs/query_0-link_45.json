        "text": "The Hollywood Reporter editor-at-large Kim Masters has been chosen as one of the recipients of this year’s Distinguished Journalists Awards, which are handed out by the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.\n\nMasters will be honored along with five other local journalists and a First Amendment activist at the group’s 42nd annual Distinguished Journalists banquet, set for March 1 at the Omni Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAlso being recognized are Robin Abcarian, columnist at the Los Angeles Times; 89.3 KPCC reporter Sharon McNary; ABC7 Eyewitness News reporter Miriam Hernandez; and Norberto Santana, founder and publisher of the Voice of OC.\n\nAdditionally, the Freedom of Information Award will be presented to Kelly Aviles of Californians Aware, a nonprofit organization that supports open government, free speech and protected reporting. Rob Eshman, former editor-in-chief and publisher of the Jewish Journal, also will be honored at the gala.\n\nThe Distinguished Journalist Awards are presented to journalists who “demonstrate good news judgment, a strong sense of ethics and a passion for getting the story right.”\n\nMasters recently broke the news of sexual harassment allegations against former Amazon Studios head Roy Price and wrote a detailed story of alleged misconduct by Pixar/Disney creative head John Lasseter that prompted his leave of absence."
