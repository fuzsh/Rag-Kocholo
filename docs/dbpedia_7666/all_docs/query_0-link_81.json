With l­ittle luggage but plenty of excitement, the thirty-­year-­old Samoan boarded the steamer Manapouri, which would take him to Sydney by way of Suva, Fiji. From Australia, it would take eight long weeks and a dramatic passage through the Suez Canal before he would fi­nally reach the northern German port city of Bremerhaven. Months ­earlier, Wilhelm Solf, the governor of German Samoa, had de­cided to send Taylor on a ten-­thousand-­mile journey to improve his German language skills and learn about German culture. Since Solf spoke only basic Samoan, he and his fellow German officials depended on Samoans—­many of mixed-­ race heritage—to do the translating and interpreting crucial for ­running the colony. Taylor was born in 1871 in Motoʻotua near Apia, the biggest town on ­Samoa’s most populous island of Upolu, to an En­glish f­ ather and a Samoan ­mother. ­A fter his f­ather moved to New Zealand, Taylor was ­adopted by German-­speaking parents. ­Because Taylor was fluent in Samoan and En­glish and also spoke good German, he was hired in 1900 as an interpreter for the new German administration. With his gift for languages and winning personality, Taylor became a power­ful broker in Samoa. Over the course of a de­ cade of colonial ser­v ice, Taylor would build a close personal relationship with Solf that transcended ­matters of work and even the colonial rule of difference. It was partly ­because Taylor was on good terms with the governor that he was allowed to travel to Germany. During his six months in Germany, Taylor spent most of his time at the German Colonial School in Witzenhausen, but he also visited other German cities. In a tailor’s shop in nearby Hannover, he bought three tailored shirts,\n\n2\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nFigure 1. ​Charles Thomas Taylor (1871–1911), 1905, Wellington, New Zealand. ​FamilySearch.\n\nthree tailored slacks, three suits, a blanket, and an umbrella.1 In May 1902, Taylor paid a visit to the nearby Wartburg, where a famous pre­de­ces­sor had done impor­tant translation work nearly four centuries ­earlier. And ­later that summer, Taylor re­united with Solf in the spa town of Bad Kissingen, where Solf was spending his home leave. However, beyond this meeting and sending Taylor some pocket money, Solf wanted ­little to do with his trusted interpreter during their overlapping stay in Germany. ­After their meeting, Taylor asked Solf if he could visit him in Berlin, the empire’s capital and largest city. To Taylor’s disappointment, Solf rejected Taylor’s wish b ­ ecause, as he explained to him in a letter, such a big city as Berlin would, without proper guidance, pose a g­ reat danger for Taylor.2 Solf further justified his decision by reassuring Taylor that he had only his best interests for his “colonial c­ areer” in mind.3 Undeterred, Taylor hoped for more opportunities to travel. He not only wanted to see Berlin but wanted to explore other parts of the world as well. As Taylor would soon find out, Solf’s affection for him had further limits. Months before his scheduled departure to Samoa, Taylor had asked Solf to change his original ticket, which had Taylor returning on the same itinerary, from Bremen to Apia via Sydney. Solf had plans to return to Samoa across the Atlantic, making diplomatic visits in the United States. Anxious to accompany his boss to visit the other colonial power in Samoa, Taylor asked in a letter written in German: “­Couldn’t I go with you, Mr. Governor, via Amer­ i­ca? That way, I could see more of the world.” 4 With an insistent and per-\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n3\n\nsonal tone, Taylor appealed to the governor of German Samoa to take him along in his circumnavigation of the world. Unfortunately for Taylor, Solf again politely declined his request. But the Samoan interpreter continued his travels. In the years following his return to Samoa, Taylor took his two young ­daughters to vacation in Wellington and visited Tonga twice. Then, in summer 1909, he petitioned for a second extended stay in Germany—­which Solf rejected. Taylor’s travels and Solf’s denials capture the global aspirations of Samoa’s workers at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury and, at the same time, their limitations. Colonialism created new opportunities for Samoans—­such as traveling around the world—­but also circumscribed the extent and purpose of their movements. Samoans in the age of empire had to navigate their way through strong crosscurrents. Multilingual mediators like Taylor became ­adept at managing and, at times, even manipulating the expectations of Euro-­ American colonial officials like Solf. In a strategic appropriation of Solf’s paternalist self-­description as the “­father” of all Samoans, Taylor repeatedly fashioned himself as the German governor’s son to further his personal interests. Yet as governor and employer, Solf did have the final word with regard to Taylor’s travel plans, his work conditions, and even his finances. Charles T. Taylor was among the first Samoans to visit Germany, but he was not the only Pacific Islander who traveled the world at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury. From the 1880s on, thousands of contract workers from New Guinea, Kiribati, and China endured thousands of miles at sea to work on coconut plantations in Samoa. In the de­cades before World War I, several groups of Samoan and fellow Polynesian performers visited Eu­rope and North Amer­i­ca to provide ethnographic edutainment to metropolitan audiences. And the first Samoan ­women, who worked for the U.S. Navy in American Samoa, journeyed across the Pacific to receive medical training in San Francisco. As this book w ­ ill show, ­these wide-­ranging movements ­were both old and new. Samoans had been “travel-­happy” ever since their ancestors had settled in the South Pacific roughly three millennia e­ arlier.5 Yet as Samoa ­became a target of Eu­ro­pean and U.S. colonialism in the late nineteenth ­century, long-­grown paths of spatial and social mobility ­were curtailed even as new ones opened up.\n\n• ​• ​•\n\n4\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nLong before the Eu­ro­pean age of empire, Samoa had been at the crossroads of ­people on the move. Located halfway between Hawaiʻi and Australia, Samoa emerged as one of the cultural centers of Oceanian life. Genealogy, trade, and occasional war linked Samoans with fellow islanders, particularly in Fiji to the southwest and Tonga to the south, and as far away as the Marquesas Islands in the eastern Pacific. Austronesian voyagers from the western Pacific had first settled on this group of volcanic islands as they expanded a shared oceanic culture, known as the Lapita. Likely the direct ancestors of most Polynesians, the Lapita ­people ­were highly mobile seaborne explorers, who, starting around 1,500 BCE, spread from northern New Guinea across eastern Melanesia into central Polynesia, including Tonga and Samoa. Archaeologists, who found shards of Lapita pottery in the Mulifanua lagoon in northern Upolu in the late 1960s, date the earliest ­human presence in Samoa to around 800 BCE.6 Over three millennia, Samoans had come to share a collective identity (Samoa ‘uma), which would shape their encounter with foreign newcomers (papālagi) in the nineteenth ­century.7 Like other islanders, Samoans sustained their Oceanian culture through travel and movement. According to fa’a Samoa (the Samoan way of life), Samoans demonstrate kinship by traveling to see relatives for impor­tant life events and conduct diplomacy by consulting with allies in times of crisis.8 Samoans call ­these traveling parties malaga, which also refers to travel, movement, and mobility more generally. More than ­simple travel, malaga are crucial to maintaining vā—­t he “links, pathways, and networks that ­people reestablish as they move.”9 As a central princi­ple of the Samoan moral economy, vā denotes spaces in between ­people, places, and environments that need to be in balance and reciprocal. By moving back and forth between relational spaces, Samoans nurture social harmony and ensure the integrity of their culture. According to Damon Salesa, the popularity of malaga increased throughout the nineteenth ­century as new ­people, places, and objects ­were incorporated into the practice. A ­ fter 1899, colonial and Samoan governments alike ­were “concerned with restricting and regulating malaga for, as much as any Samoan practice, malaga troubled colonial intentions of controlling and disciplining Samoans and Samoan politics.”10 Yet Samoans would not be easily contained. By the close of the nineteenth ­century, colonial bound­aries around space, race, and po­liti­cal sovereignty threatened Samoan traditions of mobility and cultural exchange. As colonial boundary-­makers introduced new spaces that\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n5\n\nseparated ­people, Samoans continued to spin their own webs of social, economic, and environmental relationships. Wherever they went, Samoans sought to reconstitute existential relational spaces threatened by the forces of colonialism. To understand the “rewiring of Samoa” in the context of unpre­ce­dented global interest in the islands at the end of the nineteenth ­century, it is essential to follow the workers who ­were busy updating old wires and laying new ones.11 Building on their long-­grown practices of mobility, Samoans extended malaga from their villages and islands to the wider Pacific world and beyond. In ­doing so, Samoans enlarged their lifeworlds even as colonial officials sought to narrow their paths and visions. The nineteenth ­century brought fundamental changes to the culture of mobility that Samoans had created over generations. As Eu­ro­pe­ans and Americans scrambled for the Pacific as one of the last colonial frontiers, scores of outlanders visited and settled on Pacific islands such as Samoa, beginning with the beachcombers. In the early nineteenth c­ entury, Euro-­American sailors who had escaped the hard work of whaling ships settled in Samoa, where they ­were joined by criminal escapees from New South Wales and Tasmania. Beachcombers became crucial mediators between islanders and outlanders, introducing new tools, such as metal goods and r­ ifles.12 Hard on their heels followed the missionaries. Even before the first Eu­ro­pean missionaries sailed for the South Pacific, the Samoan sailor Sio Vili brought Christian beliefs home in the late 1820s from visits to Tahiti and other Pacific islands.13 Not long ­after, in 1830, Rev. John C. Williams, the first emissary of the London Missionary Society, landed in Sapapaliʻi (Savaiʻi) together with a group of Tahitian and Rarotongan teachers. Apart from bringing the gospel to Samoa, Williams also built himself a trading vessel, established a general store in Apia, and began exporting coconut oil in 1842.14 Within years of the missionaries’ arrival, many Samoans had converted to Chris­tian­ity and ventured to other parts of the Pacific to spread the gospel. Samoan ­missionaries who followed in the footsteps of Vili initiated new forms of ­movements brought about by Euro-­American colonialism. By mid-­century, Euro-­American trading h ­ ouses and shipping companies joined Christian missions in reshaping the ways in which Samoans moved about their home islands and beyond. By the 1850s, Samoa had become the target of coconut colonialism: the extension of initially informal and subsequently formal Euro-­American control over tropical islands to extract their resources, such as coconuts.15 In 1857,\n\n6\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nthe Hamburg-­based trading h ­ ouse J. C. Godeffroy & Sohn established its Pacific headquarters in Apia on Upolu’s northern coast. Within years, Godeffroy & Sohn expanded its trade in tropical fruit, especially coconuts, copra, and cocoa, from Samoa to New Guinea and the Marshall Islands. Shipped to San Francisco and Hamburg, copra—­t he dried endosperm or meat of the coconut—­was pro­cessed into vegetable oil, margarine, and soap. At the same time, British and American merchants opened the first trading stores, turning Apia into a bustling commercial center for trans-­Pacific trade. In the 1860s, Godeffroy & Sohn and its successor com­pany, Deutsche Handels-­und Plantagen-­Gesellschaft der Südsee-­Inseln zu Hamburg (DHPG), began to purchase land from Samoans around Apia and along the northwestern coast of Upolu. In return, Samoan chiefs (matai) received foreign goods, such as metal wares and r­ ifles, which they used to expand their po­liti­cal influence over rivals. Throughout the 1870s, a vicious cycle of selling land for arms destabilized the economic and po­liti­cal systems of Samoa. In a series of violent clashes, German, British, and American officials and settlers allied with dif­fer­ent Samoan parties competing for royal titles and po­liti­cal power. Recurrent fights between Malietoa Talavou and his nephew Malietoa Laupepa over the rightful successor to the Malietoa title had subsided with Talavou’s death in ­November 1880. However, civil war broke out again soon ­a fter, as holders of other paramount chiefly titles—­Mataʻafa Iosefo and Tamasese Titimaea—­ and the two h ­ ouses of the Samoan legislature (Taʻimua and Faipule) openly challenged Malietoa Laupepa’s title. With the po­liti­cal and military support of the German Empire, Tamasese Titimaea crowned himself “king” of Samoa in November 1884, only to be attacked by Mataʻafa Iosefo, who enjoyed the support of a majority of Samoans. In June 1887, delegates from G ­ reat Britain, Germany, and the United States convened in Washington, DC, to negotiate a new colonial arrangement in Samoa. But the predominance of German interests—­especially in trade—­ combined with Anglo-­American disagreements prevented a more lasting solution. Samoans themselves w ­ ere never asked to join the debate about the ­f uture of their islands. More than anything, outlanders consistently misunderstood Samoan politics, which was based on local and genealogical sources of authority—­what Malama Meleisea has described as Samoa’s “unitary system of dispersed power.”16\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n7\n\nShortly a­ fter the inconclusive Washington conference, Tamasese Titimaea was again crowned “king” over all Samoa with German backing. Most Samoans, however, disputed Titimaea’s ascension to power ­because he failed to unite all four paramount chiefly titles (pāpā) to claim the paramountcy (tafaʻifā). Undisturbed by Samoan objections, German naval officials declared war on Malietoa Laupepa, Titimaea’s most formidable challenger to the paramountcy. With substantial support from the Imperial German Navy, Titimaea prevailed over Laupepa and his supporters in September 1887. German officials then deported Laupepa and his chief advisors to Jaluit Atoll in the German Marshall Islands, eigh­teen hundred miles from Samoa. In December 1888, German troops attacked the supporters of Mataʻafa Iosefo, who had continued his challenge to Titimaea’s claim to power. Underestimating the battle-­hardened skills of Iosefo’s troops and the challenging terrain, the Germans suffered a devastating defeat, with 56 out of 140 troops killed, and had to retreat. German soldiers eventually prevailed and exiled Iosefo, but not without serious damage to their reputation and considerable public outcry throughout the German Empire.17 In January 1889, U.S. consul William Blacklock called for warships to defend U.S. interests against escalating shelling by German ships. On March 11, 1889, three U.S. battleships u ­ nder the command of Rear Admiral L. A. Kimberly arrived in Apia. Events began to spin out of control as the decades-­long proxy conflict threatened to turn into all-­out war between Germany, ­Great Britain, and the United States, with Samoans caught in the line of fire. Then, on March 15, a tropical cyclone sank three German and three American warships, which had been dangerously eyeing each other in the harbor of Apia. Hundreds of Samoans died in the cataclysmic storm, along with ninety-­two Germans and sixty-­t hree Americans.18 Still in shock, the colonial powers agreed to a system of tripartite rule over the islands at a conference held in Berlin in the early summer of 1889. ­Under this so-­called tridominium, sovereignty over the Samoan islands and their forty thousand residents was not split along territorial lines but shared equally among the three “­great powers.” In real­ity, most Samoans outside the municipal district of Apia continued to live ­under their traditional laws, while the three consuls w ­ ere busy determining which national laws applied to which non-­native colonists. Throughout the ten-­year life span of the Samoan tridominium, the treaty powers w ­ ere constantly trying to change the\n\n8\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nstatus quo to their advantage but managed to avoid direct military confrontation. As I have argued elsewhere, the tridominium was a deliberate strategy of deferral, designed to regulate the transition of colonial rule over Samoa from three to eventually two powers.19 In early 1899, Mataʻafa Iosefo, who had returned from his exile, defeated his opponents and reinstalled himself as paramount titleholder of Samoa. In December 1899, the unpre­ce­dented experiment in tripartite rule came to an end. A trilateral convention divided Samoa between Germany and the United States, while ­Great Britain gained exclusive rights over nearby Tonga and further German concessions in the Solomon Islands. In 1900, the two biggest western islands, Upolu and Savaiʻi, officially became part of German Samoa. ­Under Governor Wilhelm Solf’s administration, Samoan cultural practices ­were tolerated, while German officials stepped up their control over po­liti­cal ­matters through a flurry of regulations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy took control over the major island to the east, Tutuila, in 1900, along with the smaller Ma­nuʻa islands in 1904.20 As a coaling station run by a small group of naval governors, American Samoa entered a historical trajectory connected to, yet distinct from, neighboring Upolu and Savaiʻi. Outlanders had succeeded in dividing Samoans’ long-­grown unitary system of decentralized power into two separate colonies. Most importantly for po­liti­cal self-­determination, Samoans had suddenly lost their ability to play off one colonial power against the ­others. A ­ fter de­cades of proxy wars, international treaties, and hundreds of casualties, a new era had begun for Samoans as they strug­g led to keep millennia-­old kinship networks and travel routes alive. When world war reached the shores of Samoa in August 1914, German authorities did not put up a fight against the overwhelming show of force by marines from ­Great Britain and New Zealand. New Zealand occupied German Samoa during the war and took over the islands ­u nder a League of Nations mandate into the 1920s and beyond. In the fall of 1918, the flu pandemic that trailed the millions of casualties of the world war hit Samoa especially hard, killing one out of five Samoans in New Zealand–­controlled Western Samoa within months. By contrast, nobody died in the neighboring U.S. territory. Many in Western Samoa blamed the staggering h ­ uman toll on the botched response by New Zealand administrators and called for greater self-­determination. By the mid-1920s, the Mau movement began to challenge colonial administrations head-on through international lobbying,\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n9\n\npublic demonstrations, and economic boycotts.21 Western Samoa would gain its formal in­de­pen­dence in 1962, the first colonized Pacific island to do so. American Samoa, by contrast, remains an unincorporated territory of the United States to this day.\n\n• ​• ​• This book tells the story of Samoa’s relations with the rest of the world from the closing de­cade of the nineteenth c­ entury u ­ ntil the end of World War I through the eyes of working ­people like Charles T. Taylor. Thousands of workers—­locals and newcomers—­laid the foundation for Samoa’s integration into the world. In­de­pen­dent Samoan producers who sold surplus copra to traders ­were essential to the prosperity of German and American Samoa. So ­were the thousands of Melanesian, Micronesian, and Chinese contract laborers who picked and pro­cessed coconuts and cocoa, tapped rubber trees, and weeded plantation grounds. Workers also built the colonial infrastructure necessary to connect Samoa internally and with the rest of the world: trails, roads, docks, and even a radio station. Cash crops found their way to market on ­t hese very roads and docks. Samoans and mi­grants from around the Pacific forged new connections with one another and the wider world b ­ ecause and in spite of colonial regimes of difference. As Samoa was drawn into the orbit of Euro-­American empires at the turn of the twentieth ­century, the islands’ working ­people extended their networks and interests outward, into the wider Pacific and beyond. Even as they ­were coerced co-­makers of colonial globality, workers in Samoa created their own way of relating to the world, which—­inspired by Oceanian intellectual Epeli Hauʻofa—­I call Oceanian globality.22 Confronted with coconut colonialism, Samoans and other islanders counterposed their own definition against the limiting form of globality that colonial officials and cap­i­tal­ists sought to force on them. In ­doing so, they filled the foreign and abstract notion of global space with their own culturally specific and relational meaning. Over the course of the nineteenth ­century, the makers of Oceanian globality strug­gled to extend their shared values of social reciprocity into the wider world. Crucially, the global connections that bound Samoa to Euro-­American traders, planters, and politicians depended on the very local connections that Samoan, Melanesian, Micronesian, and Chinese workers made with one another.\n\n10\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nIndeed, most Samoans did not distinguish between the “global” and the “local” in any meaningful way b ­ ecause their far-­reaching malaga ­were ­designed to attend to interpersonal relationships all along. But even though Oceanian cosmopolitanism had deep roots, Samoan travels at the turn of the twentieth ­century—­f rom Sydney to Munich to San Francisco—­were unpre­ce­dented.23 Through traveling and meeting fellow Pacific Islanders around the world, t­ hese globe-­trotting Samoans grew increasingly aware of shared strug­gles against colonial exploitation. Samoans realized their version of Oceanian globality in dif­fer­ent ways, from projecting their malaga into the world to entering into a Polynesian Confederacy with their Hawaiian and Tongan kin in 1887.24 Ultimately, as Samoans became more conscious of the global dimensions of colonialism, they began to challenge outlander rule over their islands more directly in the wake of World War I. The de­cades before and a­ fter 1900 formed an impor­tant transition period for Samoans and many other Pacific Islanders. As new means of communication and travel sought to annihilate space and time, the turn of the twentieth ­century brought profound economic, po­liti­cal, and social change to the Pacific. Samoa in 1889 and Samoa in 1919 w ­ ere very dif­fer­ent places. First, the islands had lost their formal po­liti­cal in­de­pen­dence as ­Great Britain, Germany, and the United States strug­gled over control. A ­ fter 1900, the forty miles of ocean separating the islands of Upolu in German Samoa and Tutuila in American Samoa became an international boundary. Initially, the border was weakly policed and easily crossed; over time, however, it hardened into a substantial barrier that slowed down exchange between Samoans in the western islands and ­t hose in the eastern islands. As Samoans adjusted to formal colonial rule ­after 1900, the economic and po­liti­cal trajectories of German and American Samoa began to diverge, with far-­reaching consequences for their po­liti­cal status and migration patterns. Second, the patchy array of foreign-­owned copra plantations in the 1880s experienced explosive growth in the following de­cades. As a result of an expanding plantation agriculture, Samoa became home to a diverse group of ­people from around the Pacific world. Besides the forty thousand Samoans who lived on the islands, several thousand mi­grant workers came to work on Samoan plantations from other parts of the Pacific, particularly the Gilbert Islands (now part of Kiribati), the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea. Beginning in the early twentieth c­ entury, they w ­ ere joined by several thou-\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n11\n\nsand more from China. As a result, Samoan farming practices came ­under increasing pressure from a growing plantation economy dominated by foreign traders and worked by mi­grants from China and other Pacific islands. Third, Samoa became increasingly entangled in shipping, communication, and entertainment networks that encircled the globe at the end of the nineteenth c­ entury. The expansion of copra plantations and regular shipping lines tied Samoa ever tighter to global trade networks. Workers erected new hospitals, administration buildings, and a coaling station for the U.S. Navy in Tutuila. Radio stations in American and German Samoa connected the islands to imperial metropoles and warships, and offered easier access to news. For their part, Samoan performers in ethnographic shows used the new infrastructure to travel to distant places, becoming cultural ambassadors in the pro­cess. And the new languages of the colonizers created new forms of employment for Samoans, who became interpreters and clerks. Uncovering the aspirations of workers on plantations, on show stages, and in governor’s offices reveals a social world beyond the control of colonial officials and, too often, beyond the purview of historians. Coconut Colonialism is a history from way below and far away, but it is also a history from close up. It traces the strug­gles of workers in Samoa from the plantation grounds up and across thousands of miles of land and sea, while staying firmly anchored in the South Pacific. For both islanders and outlanders at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury, Samoa was not at the margins of world history but, to the contrary, at the very center of events. For U.S. naval strategists in the 1890s, Pago Pago on Tutuila was a harbor “so central, and other­wise so suitable in case of operations in that quarter, that it is recommended to be retained.”25 Samoa’s global importance in the age of empire deserves renewed attention from historians of globalization, colonialism, and capitalism. Histories of modern capitalism and globalization are typically set in Eu­rope or its settler colonies, and more recently in China.26 But Pacific islands, in general, and Samoa, in par­tic­u­lar, are ideal places to rethink the history of colonialism and the colonial roots of globalization.27 During the Eu­ro­pean age of empire, the Samoan islands emerged as objects of imperial competition over access to tropical cash crops, shipping lines, and coaling stations in the South Pacific. Given ­these Euro-­American claims on Samoa, the general terms of its integration into global cir­cuits of trade, migration, and information w ­ ere often beyond the direct control of workers on the\n\n12\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nislands. What set colonial Samoa apart from other plantation colonies at the time, however, was the fact that Samoans ­were able to protect a communal land base on which they continued sustainable farming. With their own food supply secured, Samoan farmers sold their surplus production of coconuts and copra to foreign merchants in German Samoa and the U.S. Navy in American Samoa. As a result, Samoans exercised considerable power in shaping their relationship with the rest of the world. The globalization of Samoa at the turn of the twentieth ­century also adds a new chapter to the history of modern capitalism.28 Recent works by historians of capitalism have focused on commodities, railroads, and slavery in North Amer­i­ca and around the world.29 To date, ­t here are very few histories of capitalism that engage with the Pacific and its extensive networks of trade, agricultural production, and l­ abor.30 Most significantly, the story of l­ abor in Samoa offers a new take on the transformation of the global countryside at the turn of twentieth ­century. This pro­cess took place in many parts of the world, at dif­fer­ent times and u ­ nder dif­fer­ent circumstances, but was generally linked to colonization proj­ects by power­f ul states and companies.31 The expansion of commercial plantation agriculture in Samoa and the recruitment of contract laborers from all over the Pacific to work on ­t hese plantations was part of this global transformation. By the close of the nineteenth ­century, Samoa had joined other Pacific islands, such as Fiji and Hawaiʻi, to become part of a tropical plantation complex built in the long shadow of ­legal slavery.32 As the Samoan case shows, Pacific islands deserve more scholarly attention as one of the major postemancipation commodity frontier zones, marked by globally traded cash crops and unfree ­labor regimes.33 Despite several global commonalities, local particularities made the Samoan case dif­fer­ent from ­others. To be sure, rural cultivators around the world preferred local trade and farming over long-­distance markets.34 But few farmers, especially in Euro-­American colonies, ­were able to resist growing outside demands and thrive at the same time. Facing mounting pressures to sell their land and their ­labor power, Samoan farmers w ­ ere able to hold on to their sustainable farming practices for a number of reasons. First, Samoa remained at best partially integrated into global commodity chains at the turn of the twentieth ­century. Steamship and communication lines improved access to the South Pacific, but other tropical cash crop zones—in the Ca­rib­ bean and in Africa—­were geo­graph­i­cally closer to major consumer markets\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n13\n\nin North Amer­i­ca and Eu­rope. Second, Samoans had a long history of violent re­sis­tance against colonial intervention, which made colonial officials hesitant to enact more aggressive methods of extraction. Last but not least, colonial officials pursued paternalistic policies that protected Samoan ways of life from w ­ holesale commodification by more aggressive planters. Although this policy of paternalism undermined long-­standing po­liti­cal structures, it did help Samoans adapt to global trade largely on their own terms. As Samoans held their own in this precarious balance between external pressure and internal change, they developed new bonds of solidarity with one another and with non-­Samoans. Workers ­were prominent actors in the dramatic expansion of capitalism to Samoa and to the Pacific more broadly. In the eyes of plantation o ­ wners and colonial officials, the “­labor question” was central to colonialism, its po­ liti­cal economy, and the integration of Samoa into cap­i­tal­ist trade networks. In Samoa and elsewhere in the Pacific, unfreedom and coercion survived the ­legal abolition of Atlantic slavery as dif­fer­ent postemancipation ­labor regimes came to coexist. Euro-­American cap­i­tal­ists introduced wage l­abor on large copra and cocoa plantations, putting pressure on in­de­pen­dent Samoan farmers to sell their surplus crops for export, often ­under coercive conditions. At the same time, foreign-­owned plantations attracted mi­grant workers from neighboring Pacific islands and as far away as New Guinea and the Gilbert Islands. Faced with widespread Samoan re­sis­tance to land enclosure and wage ­labor, plantation o ­ wners resorted to recruiting more and more contract laborers, including thousands from China. Samoan islanders and this diverse group of newcomers engaged in vari­ous forms of manual and intellectual ­labor. In their own ways, all of them w ­ ere involved in shaping Samoa’s relationship with the wider world. Asking big questions in a small place, the case of Samoa shows that historians need to focus on workers’ strug­gles and do so from a global perspective.35 Workers in colonial Samoa faced physical and emotional challenges in their dif­fer­ent work environments. Melanesian, Micronesian, and Chinese workers on copra plantations, for example, confronted a form of l­abor that strained not only their bodies, through heavy lifting and long work hours, but also their minds, through the monotony of the work rhythm. Some plantation workers developed what colonial doctors called “coolie legs,” painful ulcers on their lower legs, resulting from constant standing, walking, and\n\n14\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\ncarry­ing crops on plantation grounds. Meanwhile, workers who helped build the coaling station in Tutuila developed their own, no less exacting relationship to the natu­ral environment. As they cut into the hillside to gain soil for the land fill stretching into the bay, workers used shovels, carts, and often their bare hands to ­handle the dirt. Although the workers with leg ulcers and dirty hands ­were not pre­sent when international treaties about the ­f uture of Samoa w ­ ere signed, they w ­ ere the ones who turned the islands into contested 36 terrain in the first place. Samoan government employees who helped translate and interpret documents and speeches experienced very dif­fer­ent demands. While they did not face the same physical challenges, their personal proximity to the center of colonial power taxed them in emotional ways. Some developed such intimate relationships with their employers that lines of authority became blurred. And for t­hose Samoan w ­ omen and men who joined ethnographic show troupes to travel to the United States and Eu­rope, working acquired yet another meaning. Theirs was a movable workplace that took them from their home islands to unfamiliar places to be exhibited in front of unfamiliar audiences. Over time, their par­tic­u­lar kind of performative l­ abor enabled forms of sociality with fellow colonized p ­ eoples unimaginable at home. Like their counter­parts in other parts of the Pacific, working p ­ eople in Samoa sought social interactions with their colleagues.37 ­W hether on the plantation grounds or in the government hospital, l­ abor was rarely a solitary endeavor. Chinese plantation workers had dens where they smoked opium and gambled. Samoan soldiers shared the same barracks. And Samoan performers in ethnographic shows spent almost e­ very moment of their worldwide travels together. Inspired by Thomas Andrews, I ­w ill refer to the contested terrain of social and material interactions in which working p ­ eople in 38 Samoa participated as a workscape. Dif­fer­ent workscapes enabled dif­fer­ent forms of interaction, giving rise to dif­fer­ent forms of sociality. Samoans in Savaiʻi who w ­ ere farming to feed their ­family members followed time-­tested ways of l­ abor organ­ization according to gender, age, and status. Meanwhile, construction workers who transported soil from cut to fill for the U.S. Navy coaling station in Tutuila followed the commands of their white bosses—at least most of the time. Occasionally, states of sociality turned into more robust bonds of solidarity in a contested workscape. Through shared experiences, workers came to\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n15\n\nacquire a sense of common interests that became the basis for collective action. In most cases, the kinds of po­liti­cal acts workers engaged in ­were far from revolutionary. For instance, plantation workers intentionally worked more slowly than their employers required, ethnographic performers demanded opportunities to earn additional cash through the sale of craftwork, and construction workers struck for better wages. In rare moments, however, concerted po­liti­cal action took the form of economic boycotts that threatened the very foundations of colonial rule, such as when a charismatic matai from Savaiʻi or­ga­nized a power­ful movement in the early twentieth ­century. It was not u ­ ntil the early 1920s when the social bonds forged in the crucible of l­ abor congealed into a more sustained solidarity movement among Samoans, who directed their demands for cultural autonomy and re­spect against both the U.S. Navy and the New Zealand civil administration. By analyzing the bonds of solidarity that emerged in dif­fer­ent workscapes in Samoa in the preceding de­cades, Coconut Colonialism maps out the understudied l­abor roots of the anti-­colonial Mau movement.39 Due to the multiracial and transitory nature of l­ abor in Samoa, solidarity among workers did not emerge primarily from an awareness of common goals. Instead, workers shared a sense of vulnerability to cultural, economic, po­liti­cal, and environmental change. To varying degrees, workers ­were drawn into a colonial world beyond their control. Samoan families, for instance, had to deal with the commodification of their natu­ral resources, from food crops such as coconuts to the very lands they lived on. The thousands of mi­grant workers who came to Samoa from all over the Pacific world ­were exposed to dif­fer­ent kinds of vulnerabilities. Bound by contract to their employer, they had to obey ­orders, work hard, and endure regular physical and financial punishment. B ­ ecause most contract laborers came alone, they could not rely on the social networks that sustained Samoan communities. Even though workers experienced dif­fer­ent degrees of vulnerability in the face of coconut colonialism, they came to share a common understanding of themselves as structurally exposed to forces beyond their control. While it would be too much to speak of a class consciousness shared by all workers in Samoa, this sense of solidarity in the face of shared vulnerability emerged clearly on several occasions at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury. Solidarity materialized, for instance, when Samoans protested against the continuing commodification of their food supplies by German plantation\n\n16\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\n­ wners seeking quick profits. In protecting their own agricultural economy, o Samoans slowed down the advance of commercial plantations on their islands and, indirectly, mitigated the further exploitation of plantation workers from elsewhere. Likewise, Samoans who participated in ethnographic shows in Eu­rope and North Amer­i­ca w ­ ere vulnerable to exploitative man­ag­ers, aggressive audiences, and local authorities. By socializing with fellow ­people on display, such as hula dancers from Hawaiʻi, Samoans recognized their own vulnerabilities as participants in the politics of colonial repre­sen­ta­tion. Yet when they laughed and danced with fellow Polynesians in faraway Chicago, Samoan performers also transcended official protocols and ­shaped their own form of Oceanian globality.\n\n• ​• ​• Samoan history at the turn of the twentieth ­century has usually been told from the perspective of the Eu­ro­pean and American diplomats whose voluminous rec­ords are readily accessible. In an influential study, Paul Kennedy characterized the negotiations, conferences, and treaties involving the islands as “the Samoan Tangle.” 40 Rather than approaching Samoan history at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury as a diplomatic tangle, Coconut Colonialism puts Samoa’s entanglements in the global webs of capitalism and ­labor mi­ oing so, the book relies on the foundational gration front and center.41 In d work of Samoan, New Zealand, and Australian historians writing in the late 1960s and 1970s. James W. Davidson wrote the first po­liti­cal history of the newly in­de­pen­dent Western Samoa, but only his opening chapters focus on the period before World War II, with scarce attention to the experience of working p ­ eople.42 Richard P. Gilson, while broadening his view to include culture and religion, ends his account of multicultural Samoa with partition in 1899.43 Malama Meleisea does highlight the role of workers in colonial Samoa, but aside from his impor­tant oral history of Melanesian workers, he did not produce a major monograph or analyze forms of l­abor beyond plantations.44 Other studies of ­labor in Samoa tend to focus on specific groups of mi­g rant workers—­for example, ­t hose from Micronesia, Melanesia, and China.45 In contrast, Coconut Colonialism connects the experiences of all workers in colonial Samoa together in a Pacific and global context. More recently, Patricia O’Brien has put Samoa back on the world stage with her biography of Taʻisi O. F. Nelson.46 However, O’Brien’s study of an influential\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n17\n\nbusinessman, plantation owner, and charismatic politician has l­ittle to say about the everyday experiences of working ­people and their own global travels. One of this book’s main arguments is that the thousands of lesser-­ known workers on plantations and show stages at the turn of the twentieth ­century ­were the trailblazers for Nelson’s anti-­colonial lobbying and the success of the Mau movement. ­Earlier than many of their counter­parts, historians of the Pacific islands have worked to overcome the national, racial, and cultural bound­aries erected by outlanders since James Cook.47 Two major fault lines dating back to Euro-­ American colonization of the late nineteenth c­ entury continue to run right through the Samoan archipelago t­oday: the international date line and the border between (Western) Samoa and American Samoa. The international date line, created in 1884 at a conference in Washington, DC, represented the counterpart to the zero meridian at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, Great Britain. With the Atlantic world foremost on their minds, conference delegates solved the geometric “prob­lem” by drawing the line right through the m ­ iddle of the Pacific Ocean. As far as Euro-­A merican delegates w ­ ere concerned, ­t here w ­ ere too few islanders living in the region to ­matter. In fact, representatives from the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi ­were the lone voices from the Pacific in Washington. Since 1884, Samoa jumped across the date line not once but twice. Only eight years l­ater, Samoa celebrated two consecutive Fourths of July to join the eastern side of the line. American merchants had lobbied for the time alignment since the creation of the date line, hoping to facilitate business with their main shipping destination in San Francisco. And over a c­ entury l­ ater, on December 30, 2011, Western Samoa jumped back west across the date line. That Friday was simply skipped on Upolu and Savaiʻi, forcing hundreds of surprised residents to move their birthday parties.48 Samoan prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi had argued that the date switch would improve business relations with major trading partners in Australia, New Zealand, and China. Since hundreds of thousands of Samoans lived in Australia and New Zealand, crossing the date line would also make it easier to communicate with ­family and friends in the diaspora. Considerations of po­liti­cal economy had influenced Samoa’s first jump across the date line in 1892, and they did so again in 2011. In both cases, workers seeking opportunities for a better life bound Samoa closer to other parts of the Pacific.\n\n18\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nLikewise, the international border between the in­de­pen­dent nation-­state of (Western) Samoa and American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States, was the product of colonial boundary-­makers. Since the Tripartite Convention of 1899, which created German and American Samoa, an international border has separated the western islands of Savaiʻi and Upolu from their eastern neighbors, Tutuila and Ma­nu’a. With the stroke of a pen in distant Washington, long-­standing po­liti­cal, economic, and genealogical links among the islands of Samoa ­were put u ­ nder strain. Through this rewiring of Samoa from the outside, Apia gained in economic significance while the paramount titleholders of Tutuila and Ma­nu’a lost po­liti­cal influence vis-­à-­v is their counter­parts in Upolu and Savaiʻi.49 During the influenza pandemic of 1918–19, the international border allowed the U.S. naval administration to more effectively quarantine Tutuila and Ma­nu’a from Western Samoa, likely saving hundreds of lives. Since Western Samoa gained its in­de­pen­dence in 1962, the border has served to separate an in­de­ pen­dent Pacific country from a colony of the U.S. empire. While American Samoan nationals are f­ ree to move to fully incorporated parts of the United States for work or f­ amily visits, Samoans in (Western) Samoa traveling to American Samoa face the comprehensive and changing border regime of the U.S. empire. To understand the differential distribution of rights and resources across the border between Upolu and Tutuila t­ oday, Coconut Colonialism analyzes the intertwined colonial trajectories of Western and American Samoa together. To date, ­t here is no book-­length study that brings together the histories of Western and American Samoa during the crucial time when the islands redefined their relationship to the world at the turn of the twentieth ­century. Both the international date line and the international border are products of Euro-­A merican colonialism that continue to affect migration, trade, and f­ amily networks in postcolonial Samoa and still-­colonial American Samoa. Given renewed attention to the Pacific Ocean and its ­peoples, historians of the region need to build more bridges to national and international conversations without losing sight of the very local traditions of genealogy, identity, and connection.50 Beyond Samoan and Pacific history, Coconut Colonialism pushes historians of the United States and Germany to broaden their horizons ­toward the Pacific. Despite rising interest in the history of German and U.S. colonialism in recent de­cades, t­ here has been no book on Samoa that situates the\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n19\n\ni­slands within the region and within the histories of the two colonial empires.51 This book offers a detailed analy­sis of Samoa’s role in both German and U.S. colonial proj­ects, highlighting the central role played by working ­people. For a long time, scholars of U.S. and German l­abor history have ignored the experiences of workers beyond the imperial center and without citizenship. This study of German and American Samoa is part of a growing wave of scholarship that tries to break that silence.52 Workers in Samoa played impor­tant roles in the expansion of global trade and shipping networks, which fueled cap­i­tal­ist production and consumption in metropolitan markets. And some Samoan workers even traveled to Berlin and New York to entertain German and American spectators anxious to see exotic islanders from the Pacific. Th ­ ese cultural workers collapsed distinctions not only between center and periphery but also between colonizer and colonized. In sum, historians of German and American history have a lot to learn by turning their eyes ­toward the South Pacific.53\n\n• ​• ​• Samoa at the turn of the twentieth c­ entury was riven by tensions over trade, ­labor, and mobility. To flesh out the intimate dynamics of working in Samoa, Coconut Colonialism is structured topologically, linking par­tic­u­lar themes to par­tic­ul­ ar kinds of places. Theme and place come together in five dif­fer­ent workscapes. Each chapter captures a global pro­cess within the local context of Samoa: the commodification of the Samoan economy (Chapter 1), unfree ­labor migration (Chapter 2), the performative ­labor involved in ethnographic shows (Chapter 3), the construction of transportation and communication lines (Chapter 4), and the ­careers in the colonial ser­v ice (Chapter 5). Chapter 1 opens with the tropical fruit that sparked outside interest in the Samoan islands in the nineteenth c­ entury: the coconut. Samoans resisted Euro-­American coconut colonialism by holding on to their vibrant farming practices, which acted as a safeguard against their exploitation as wage laborers on plantations. In insisting on the limits of commodification of natu­ ral resources, especially food crops such as coconuts, Samoans succeeded in protecting long-­standing ways of life. At the same time, Samoans also adapted selectively to the new colonial world by performing occasional wage ­labor on plantations and, especially, by founding copra cooperatives. In both German and American Samoa, this form of worker mutualism was aimed at greater economic self-­determination on the part of the power­ful Samoan producers.\n\n20\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nWhile the cooperative movement eventually gave in ­under po­liti­cal coercion, it helped form the nucleus of a more sustained challenge to colonial rule in the 1920s. Chapter 2 sketches out the colonial world made by copra, the dried meat of the coconut. As the main cash crop of the islands, copra structured the lives of thousands of Melanesian and Chinese plantation workers and in­de­ pen­dent Samoan producers. Plantation workers strug­gled to turn shared sociality into the more concrete bonds of solidarity that would enable them to resist their exploitation in more lasting ways. Moving across lines—­spatial, racial, and even spiritual—­was one of the main strategies of re­sis­tance pursued by workers. Chinese workers defied the coercive conditions on large copra plantations by ­running away, appealing to their home government, and sometimes resorting to physical vio­lence. Workers from Micronesia and Melanesia created communities of cultural kinship with one another in a related but distinct islander society. ­Those mi­grant workers who made Samoa their home ­after their contracts had expired often intermarried with Samoans to form multicultural families still vis­i­ble t­ oday. Chapter 3 follows the travels and travails of Samoan performers who participated in ethnographic shows in the United States and Eu­rope at the turn of the twentieth ­century. No less than the workers cutting copra on the islands, the men and ­women who left their homes to enact Samoan culture abroad played a crucial role in the making of empire in Samoa. Easily the most mobile of all workers, troupe members charted out their own pathways on unfamiliar terrain and, in the pro­cess, complicated lines of authority and cultural authenticity. Balancing the exploitation of the colonial gaze against opportunities for travel and self-­representation, Samoan performers became power­ful diplomats of their own. Over time, they learned to circumnavigate the demands of their Euro-­American man­ag­ers by reinterpreting their participation in ethnographic shows as diplomatic missions and making friends with fellow colonized p ­ eoples, finding new forms of solidarity out of earshot of colonial officials. The building of the material infrastructure of empire in Samoa is the focus of Chapter 4. Shipping and telegraph lines presaged Samoa’s entry into an age of deepening global connections, a pro­cess bookended by the two date line crossings in 1892 and 2011. Despite their aura of annihilating time and space, new technologies such as the telegraph and radio still required man-\n\nI n t roduc t ion\n\n21\n\nual ­labor. Communication and shipping lines helped link Samoa to Euro-­ American audiences and markets while giving islanders l­ittle control over the terms of interaction. But construction workers who built the roads, telegraph lines, and U.S. naval station in Tutuila w ­ ere far from mere auxiliaries of Euro-­American colonialism. By contrast, ­t hese construction workers not only regularly fought for better working conditions but also succeeded in making the new material environment their own. In the end, the building of infrastructure went hand in hand with the building of structures of solidarity among t­ hose who did the work. In the fifth and final chapter, the white-­collar counter­parts to the blue-­ collar plantation workers take center stage: soldiers, interpreters, and nurses. Colonization brought new forms of employment to the islands. Many of the workers in the colonial ser­v ice w ­ ere of mixed-­race heritage and used their intermediary positions to become power­f ul brokers between colonizers and the colonized. Interpreters like Charles T. Taylor gained po­liti­cal clout in German Samoa b ­ ecause of their proximity to colonial power. Female nurses like Grace Pepe received training from the U.S. Navy in Tutuila and California, turning them into essential brokers between Samoan traditional healing and Euro-­American medicine. Above all, soldiers, interpreters, and nurses in the colonial ser­vice used their acquired skills not only for individual advancement but for po­liti­cal activism as well. With their intercultural education and personal networks, ser­v ice workers emerged as leaders of the anti-­colonial re­sis­tance movement that shook Samoan society ­after World War I. Coconut Colonialism is a book about ­those who ­shaped Samoa and its place in the world. It covers the span of three de­cades, from 1889 to 1919, to tell the story of Samoa’s fraught integration into global capitalism and its lasting effects into the pre­sent. Workers, merchants, and colonial officials play major roles in this story, as do plantations, ships, and show stages. Tracing the experiences of workers in Samoa moves the narrative far beyond the Samoan islands of Upolu, Savaiʻi, and Tutuila, to cities like San Francisco, Berlin, and Shantou. As it turns out, interpreter Charles T. Taylor, whose global travels opened this introduction, was only one of many Samoans who moved thousands of miles and remade their home islands in the pro­cess. The journey into this contested past begins in the South Pacific with the tropical fruit at the center of Samoan culture and, eventually, global commerce: the coconut.\n\n1 COCONUTS\n\nAs nourishment for body and mind, the coconut has fed Samoans for millennia. Coconut trees are among the most widespread plants in the South Pacific, providing Samoans and other Pacific Islanders with both calories and canoes. A medium-­sized coconut yields more than fourteen hundred calories and is rich in iron, potassium, and saturated fat. Coconut trees are highly versatile plants whose entire organism—­from the palm leaves to the roots—­can be used for dif­fer­ent purposes. B ­ ecause growing coconut trees (niu) required ­little attention, Samoans w ­ ere fond of saying: “Give a coconut a day and it ­will give you a lifetime.”1 A well-­k nown story from Samoa and other parts of Polynesia explains the origins of the coconut tree. According to oral tradition, a beautiful girl named Sina had a pet eel (tuna) who fell in love with her. Afraid, Sina ran away, but the eel followed her to a pool in a neighboring village. Before village chiefs could kill the eel, Sina granted him his last wish: cut his head off and plant it in the ground. From her planting grew the first coconut tree. The face of the eel—­two eyes and a mouth—­can be seen in the three round marks of the husked coconut.2 The round form of the coconut with its three indentations also resembles a h ­ uman head, an association that influenced even Samoan plantation pidgin: “White man coconut belong him no grass he stop [The white man’s head is bald].”3 And when Portuguese explorers brought back the first coconuts to Eu­rope in the mid-­sixteenth ­century, they called the fruit coco, or grinning face. The coconut’s anthropomorphic appearance was matched by its g­ reat practical use for h ­ umans. Shells served as drinking cups and to carry w ­ ater, the palm and midrib ­were used to make baskets, and fiber from the husk (coir) was plaited into sennit to build h ­ ouses and canoes.4 The husking and split-\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n23\n\nting of nuts, followed by the grating and squeezing of the meat inside, w ­ ere arduous and time-­consuming ­labor pro­cesses. As a consequence, the time invested in the preparation of a coconut tended to correlate with the special occasion or the status of the guests to be served.5 An average ­family coconut grove was less than one acre in size but could yield up to sixty nuts per tree per year.6 Coconut trees took between five and eight years to mature, but some trees bore fruit for up to seventy years, longer than the average life expectancy of Samoans at the time. Samoans did not plant coconut trees in a par­tic­u­lar order or distance from one another, but they made sure to plant them close to taro and yam fields to have quick refreshment available for workers.7 That way, Samoans knew that no spot on their islands was further than half an hour from the nearest coconut, which could provide food and drink in times of need.8 While coconut trees ­were owned by the families on whose ground they stood, passersby had the right to pluck a few nuts to refresh themselves.9 Fallen nuts ­were usually left to themselves and ­were ­free to be picked up by anyone who found them.10 To harvest the fruits while they w ­ ere still green, Samoan men climbed up coconut trees that grew as tall as a hundred feet. Using only a sling wrapped around their feet as support, they hugged the tree trunk with their arms and scaled the tree like a caterpillar. Once at the top of the tree, the climber plucked the green fruits from their stems and dropped them onto the ground.11 Mature coconuts could be more con­ve­niently picked up from the ground and collected in baskets, usually made out of coconut leaf midribs.12 Ripe coconuts also made better copra. Traditionally, young w ­ omen carried the harvested fruits in two baskets, one in back and one in front of their bodies, connected with a stick across their shoulders.13 Filled to the top, two baskets of coconuts could weigh up to 150 pounds. Young men then pro­cessed the coconuts, to make use of their individual components. First, the husk of the coconut was split off and removed by pounding the nut against a sharpened wooden stick (meleʻi) rammed into the ground. Next, the young Samoans straddled a wooden stool (‘ausaʻalo) to scrape the open coconut against the seashell-­like part of a coconut shell fastened to the stool’s point. The scraped-­off pieces of the coconut kernel ­were then collected in a vessel or on a leaf placed below the stool. Fi­nally, the scrapings ­were poured into a strainer and the juice squeezed into a bowl for further mixing with other foodstuffs.14\n\n24\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nFigure 2. ​Samoan man ­under coconut tree near Pago Pago, Tutuila, 1884. ​ [Pango Pango (sic).

Experienced in this noncapitalist mode of agricultural production, Samoans gradually seized the new opportunities that presented themselves with the increasing presence of Euro-­A merican missionaries and traders beginning in the 1830s. A ­ fter the introduction of commercial agriculture by German traders in the 1860s, Samoans fought to maintain their economic and cultural autonomy and to shape the copra economy according to their own values and interests.\n\nCopra World The origins of foreign copra plantations in Upolu and Savaiʻi in the mid-­ nineteenth c­ entury w ­ ere bound up with the sale of Samoan land. Soon a­ fter the first outlanders de­cided to stay on the islands, Samoans began leasing and selling them land, likely unaware that the buyers expected exclusive and indefinite access.15 According to one Samoan historian, the possibility that Samoans “could lose in perpetuity, in return for one payment in cash or kind, control over the land, authority over the conduct of its occupants and jurisdiction over the f­ uture transfer or inheritance of land they bestowed, was outside their experience or comprehension.”16 A trading com­pany from distant Germany played a major role in the alienation of Samoan land. In the mid-­nineteenth c­ entury, the German trading h ­ ouse J. C. Godeffroy & Sohn began its business activities in the South Pacific, establishing its headquarters in Apia in 1857.17 From Apia, Godeffroy & Sohn expanded its trade in tropical fruit throughout Polynesia and into Melanesia and Micronesia. In its early years, the trading ­house relied on local Samoan producers to supply the increasingly valuable cash crops. In the mid-1860s, the young and energetic Godeffroy man­ag­er Theodor Weber took advantage of a series of environmental disasters to purchase twelve acres of land from starving Samoans and set up the first cotton plantation.18 During the global cotton famine caused by the U.S. Civil War in the mid-1860s, a few Samoans worked for wages on t­ hese cotton plantations.19 By 1868, when the cotton boom began to subside, the firm owned twenty-­five hundred acres, almost 1 ­percent of the total land area of Upolu.20 A ­ fter its reor­ga­ni­za­tion into the Deutsche Handelsund Plantagen-­Gesellschaft der Südsee-­Inseln (DHPG) in 1878, the German firm continued to prosper.21\n\n26\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nBy the 1870s, copra had become Samoa’s main export to Eu­rope and North Amer­i­ca, where it was pro­cessed into a variety of products, including high-­ quality soap, margarine, and even dynamite.22 Driven by growing demand for copra, the DHPG dramatically expanded its plantation holdings by purchasing land from Samoans at war. Trading land for firearms and other supplies, Weber managed to purchase around twenty-­five thousand acres of prime plantation lands during the Malietoa succession war between Talavou and Laupepa (1869–1872).23 At the same time, the Central Polynesian Land and Commercial Com­pany—­a group of land speculators based in San Francisco—­acquired claims to an area of more than 300,000 acres, or nearly half the land area of all the Samoan islands.24 Samoan land became so scarce ­after this rush in the 1870s that at the beginning of the twentieth ­century, an acre of land was selling for up to £500 ($100).25 Samoans ­were divided over ­t hese escalating land sales to outlanders. Many feared that foreign owner­ ship would undermine long-­standing ways of life based on sustainable agriculture, while some welcomed the considerable profits they reaped from the sales. ­These profits usually came in the form of imported ­rifles, which matai used to gain an advantage over their rivals. The result was what outside observers innocently called “civil war,” which belied the active support Euro-­American traders and plantation ­owners provided to dif­fer­ent sides of competing Samoan parties. Fueled by demand for copra in the United States and Eu­rope, the vicious cycle of selling Samoan land for arms accelerated. Land sales had far-­reaching consequences for Samoans and their relationships with outlanders. Euro-­American planters ­were so desperate for Samoan land (and regulations so minimal) that newly “land-­conscious” Samoans ­were able to sell the same parcels of land to several buyers.26 As a result of widespread fraud, the area claimed by Euro-­American speculators amounted to a ­grand total of 1.7 million acres, or more than twice the overall area of Samoa.27 In 1893, a land commission installed by the colonial powers recognized only about 8 ­percent of ­t hese outlander claims to Samoan lands, but ­t hese included 35 ­percent of overall cultivable land and 60 ­percent of cultivable land in the plantation ­belt between Apia and Mulifanua.28 De­cades ­after the G ­ reat Māhele in Hawaiʻi, Samoans fought their own strug­gle against colonial enclosure.29 Selling land also increased the power of Samoan men over ­women and of matai over t­ hose without title. Since owner­ship of property conferred social\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n27\n\nprestige, the increasing commodification of plantation land intensified conflicts between and within Samoan families.30 With the arrival of Euro-­ American cap­i­tal­ists and their ideas about private property, claims to land owner­ship in colonial Samoa moved from genealogical title to usufruct ­occupation. In American Samoa, Euro-­American settlers and the U.S. Navy used the common law doctrine of adverse land possession, based on individual land titles derived from at least ten years of cultivation, to undermine customary Samoan land tenure, based on ­family (‘aiga) and village (nui) rights.31 Besides the German com­pany and a handful of Euro-­American merchants, another group ­rose in size and power in colonial Samoa: Samoans of mixed-­ race descent (afakasi). As the interracial offspring of Samoans and Euro-­ American newcomers, the first generation of mixed-­race Samoans was born in the early nineteenth c­ entury. As outlanders arrived in greater numbers and de­cided to stay, the mixed-­race population of Samoa expanded. Interracial liaisons and marriages ­were often motivated by economic interests. Euro-­ American men sought out marriages with high-­ranking Samoan w ­ omen to gain access to coveted land. ­After establishing a foothold in Samoan ­family and village networks, ­t hese newcomers w ­ ere able to expand their landholdings or establish trading stations. Their interracial offspring ­were usually classified as “Eu­ro­pean” by Euro-­A merican law, which allowed them to hold land, enter into individual contracts, and participate in po­liti­cal self-­ representation. Generally accepted by other Samoans, mixed-­race Samoans used their language and intercultural skills to seize new opportunities presented by coconut colonialism. For colonial officials, mixed-­race Samoans became “troublesome half-­castes” ­because they muddled the colonial rule of difference by crisscrossing well-­defined bound­aries of race, class, and culture. Furthermore, many Samoans of mixed-­race descent traveled widely within Samoa and beyond, which challenged restrictions on mobility passed by c­ olonial administrators.32 Among the mixed-­race Samoans was a young man by the name of Taʻisi Olaf Fredrick Nelson. Born in Safune (Savaiʻi) in 1883, Nelson was the fourth child of a Swedish merchant and a Samoan m ­ other. Twelve years younger than interpreter Charles T. Taylor, Nelson likewise grew up between Eu­ro­ pean and Samoan cultures and languages. When he was a young teenager, Nelson quit the Marist B ­ rothers’ Commercial School and began working for\n\n28\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nthe DHPG as an office clerk. While ­t here, he learned basic accounting skills and gleaned insights into the po­liti­cal nature of business in Samoa, both of which would be crucial for his f­uture c­ areer in business and politics. Tellingly, Nelson refused to speak German, even though his superiors at the firm had ordered him to do so.33 In February 1900, four years into Nelson’s job at the DHPG, the German flag was raised over Upolu and Savaiʻi. Nelson’s DHPG man­ag­er had been suspicious of his loyalty to the German kaiser for years, and a recent kerfuffle between Nelson and a group of German marines at the Lindenau restaurant in Apia had made m ­ atters worse. When the German judge ordered Nelson and his friends to pay fines as punishment for the public confrontation, Nelson was fired from his job. As O’Brien wryly notes, Nelson’s dismissal from the DHPG a mere week ­after formal annexation “did not help endear the new German regime to him.”34 In retrospect, Nelson’s firing from the DHPG set him up for a successful business ­career. ­After he returned to his birthplace of Safune on Savaiʻi, the seventeen-­year-­old joined his ­father’s prospering trading com­pany and was made ju­nior partner in 1905. In 1908, Nelson returned to Apia and worked hard to extend the network of trade stores his ­father had started in the 1870s. With an expanding trade empire of his own, Nelson would once again run afoul of German po­liti­cal and economic interests in the context of Lauaki’s Mau a Pule. Mixed-­race Samoans, like Nelson, ­were innovators in the commodification and cultural transformation of Samoa—­contested pro­cesses that colonial administrators preferred to control.35 As in other colonies at the time, it was ambitious Samoans of mixed-­race descent that would ­later emerge as leaders of decolonization.\n\n• ​• ​• ­ fter partition in 1899, the Samoan l­abor system was subjected to severe A strains by the increasing demands of colonial administrators and foreign plantation ­owners. Samoa’s communal social and economic system increasingly clashed with the new plantation system introduced by Euro-­American traders, who pursued their own economic interests and desperately needed workers. The famed Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who had moved to Samoa in 1889, understood this gradual transformation of the Samoan ­po­liti­cal economy as well as anyone. In his plantation estate in Vailima, Ste-\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n29\n\nvenson exploited the social hierarchies among the Samoan workers he employed by presenting himself as a caring f­ ather and welfare cap­i­tal­ist.36 German colonial officials, who had formally taken over the main islands of ­ ere acutely aware of the long-­grown and complex Upolu and Savaiʻi in 1900, w nature of the Samoan l­abor system. Widespread Euro-­American ste­reo­types about the alleged laziness of colonized ­people, in general, and Samoan “communism,” in par­tic­u­lar, did not stand the test of social real­ity. In a letter to a German geographer from the fall of 1906, Governor Solf defended his policy of protecting Samoan ways of life from overly aggressive planters: The assumption that the Samoan does not work is wrong. . . . ​­Every young Samoan, who is working for planters, is, of course, missing with his ­labor power inside his community. The Samoan idea is that every­ body who is working outside of his community owes his pay to the community ­because his ­labor power is withdrawn from the community. Hence, the ­little interest of Samoans to work for foreigners. For they have to, according to the communistic outlook of their community, give back to the community part or all of what they earn. In addition, working as a servant for pay is seen as despicable.37 Forcefully changing this deeply ingrained ­labor system, Solf reasoned, would lead to nothing but economic disaster for the white settlers. Samoans would stop buying imported goods and rely on f­ amily farming to satisfy their basic needs. Most importantly, Solf warned, Samoans would refrain from cutting copra for the white traders. In light of the recent Herero rebellion in German Southwest Africa, Solf reassuringly added, Samoans would threaten the lives of the white settlers only in cases of “utmost outrage.” They would, however, more readily destroy foreign plantations, Solf concluded. While social rank, age, and gender determined the kinds of l­abor Samoans ­were engaged in before the colonial era, German and American colonial officials and plantation o ­ wners tried to impose their own bound­aries on Samoa’s social landscape. Samoans ­were increasingly reduced to laborers who ­were expected to produce cash crops in ever greater quantities. To be sure, Samoans had always produced a small surplus of food crops to have a reserve in case of environmental disasters and to host malaga.38 But before 1830,\n\n30\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nSamoan agricultural production was geared ­toward securing livelihood, not making a profit. As in most Oceanian socie­ties, social prestige in Samoa came from “the generous distribution, not the accumulation of wealth.”39 Most ­Samoans continued to practice their sustainable farming regardless of the increasing presence of outlanders and sold their surplus crops to ­Euro-­American traders. And occasionally, Samoans worked on larger Euro-­ American plantations to earn cash. Coconut colonialism changed Samoan economic, social, and cultural practices in profound ways. Beginning in the 1830s, Euro-­American traders and missionaries introduced new goods into the Samoan economy, some of which, like firearms and ammunition, quickly became indispensable to Samoan warfare and politics. Other new manufactured goods (mea palagi, or “foreign goods”) included such diverse objects as umbrellas, watches, and sewing machines. Many of t­hese manufactured goods ­were sold by Euro-­American traders in their own stores or in stores owned by large plantation companies. A German trade report from May 1900 documented some of the imported goods that changed everyday life among Samoans: “­Every eve­ning, one can see a lamp burning in ­every Samoan hut, nearly ­every Samoan ­family owns as part of their inventory a sewing machine, which is expertly handled by the w ­ omen and girls. Extraordinarily high is the demand for umbrellas, which serve as protection against rain and sunshine, at the same time, however, are also seen as a symbol of certain refinement and therefore are very popu­lar with both sexes.” 40 Samoans needed cash to pay for t­ hese desirable goods as well as for government taxes and church ser­vices. Additionally, missionaries raised substantial amounts of cash through donations and sports competitions, which ­were used to finance the construction of new church facilities and schools. A critical observer quipped in the 1890s that missionaries rang a big bell three times a day: “the first bell: a summons for the natives to bring to the priest all the taros which they have gathered, the second: all the coconuts and bananas, the third: fresh fish.” 41 In a trade report from April 1898, German consul Rose worried about the large sums of money Samoans ­were donating to the Christian missions, such as the London Missionary Society (LMS).42 For instance, losers of cricket matches, hosted by the mission on two or three after­noons a week, had to pay 1 shilling ($0.25) to the church’s construction fund.43 Some missionaries—­like the LMS in Malua and the Catholic mission\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n31\n\nin Vaia—­operated their own plantations, albeit on a much smaller scale than the DHPG.44 As colonial officials and traders ­were quick to notice, British, French, and American missionaries w ­ ere formidable cap­i­tal­ists in their own right. Missionaries also introduced Samoans to new crops, agricultural techniques, and accounting practices. Mission school plantations proved to be impor­tant training grounds for Samoan farmers, who learned more efficient cultivation practices and gained work experience. Since accounting skills ­were indispensable to the management of construction proj­ects, such as the large churches built by missionaries around Apia, Samoans ­were trained in basic commercial practices.45 Christian missionaries had a lasting impact on Samoans’ rhythm of work. By the end of the nineteenth c­ entury, most Samoans began their labor-­free Sundays by attending church ser­vice before they enjoyed their elaborate meals and found time to relax.46 Apart from the missionaries, the colonial administrations also demanded cash from Samoans for school and marriage fees, dog and gun licenses, head taxes, and fines. New means of transportation, such as boat launches and buses, and new forms of entertainment, such as dances and restaurants, cost money as well. Samoans also began saving cash as insurance against environmental disasters, such as droughts, pests, or volcanic eruptions. The gradual emergence of a cash nexus by the close of the nineteenth ­century made new commodities and ser­vices available to Samoans but also confronted them with new challenges. Over time, Euro-­American money became part of the Samoan system of reciprocal exchange.47 Since the Samoan po­liti­cal economy was based on the mutual exchange of food and fine mats for ceremonial reasons and to enhance one’s social prestige, cash money was merely a new kind of currency. If fine mats remained qualitatively dif­fer­ent from cash, many Samoans by the late nineteenth ­century had ­adopted the Euro-­American approach in mea­ sur­ing the value of fine mats in exclusively monetary terms for their own exchange transactions.48 Traders w ­ ere mostly interested in copra, so Samoans increased their production whenever they needed cash or wanted to purchase goods in the trading stores. This new need for cash made copra production more impor­tant to the Samoan economy and contributed to a more regular and regimented work rhythm on copra plantations. And as more and more ships came to call at the islands, Samoan ­women earned cash by selling\n\n32\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\ncraft products, such as baskets, ornaments, and clothing, to visitors.49 By the turn of the twentieth ­century, Samoans had incorporated the rules of the cash crop economy into their own system of economic exchange, so much so that a New Zealand soldier in 1914 complained of Samoans selling fruit “at exorbitant prices.”50 Before the arrival of outlanders, l­abor in Samoa was associated with status, age, and gender. In general, the ­labor of Samoan men tended to be heavier and dirtier, while Samoan w ­ omen performed lighter and cleaner types of ­labor. If masculine l­abor was largely utilitarian, aimed at the production of food and tools, feminine l­abor was predominantly ceremonial, producing kava and fine mats (‘ie tōga).51 Fine mats played a crucial part in a range of social and po­liti­cal events, such as marriages, funerals, visiting parties (malaga), and formal apologies (ifoga). The ­labor of producing fine mats thus provided w ­ omen with a degree of influence in po­liti­cal and economic m ­ atters, which w ­ ere usually dominated by men. Most importantly, Samoan ­women performed most of the reproductive l­ abor necessary to sustain f­ amily life and Samoan society as a w ­ hole. They not only regulated biological reproduction but also cared for the social reproduction of their ‘aiga. Outside their families, Samoan men and ­women rarely worked alone but formed ­labor groups according to their gender. Untitled men belonged to the ‘aumāga, a voluntary society and cooperative work group that represented the main ­labor force in Samoan villages.52 Its main function was to provide manual ­labor and particularly military ser­vice to the village. The ‘aumāga was usually headed by the manaia, the son of the village’s paramount matai and his most likely heir, who had a vested interest in proving his dedication to ser­ vice. The male work group was engaged in a wide range of community activities, such as cutting copra to raise money for the church, maintaining village roads, building h ­ ouses, ferrying passengers and cargo, planting and harvesting taro, fishing, cooking, and serving kava at village council meetings ( fono). Besides work, the ‘aumāga offered an arena for socializing for young men who played cricket and drank together. The female counterpart of the ‘aumāga was the aualuma. It originally consisted of the female servants of the taupou, the ­daughter of the leading matai in a village. Headed by the taupou, the aua­ aughters of the fono members as well as the luma brought the ­sisters and d ‘aumāga together. In contrast to the practical ­labor performed by the ‘aumāga, its function was largely ceremonial, such as entertaining guests on malaga.\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n33\n\nOccasionally, members of the aualuma assisted in the construction of ­houses by carry­ing cane leaves and baskets of pebbles or weaving thatching sections and blinds. As a result of the increasing presence of missionaries in Samoa ­after the 1830s, the aualuma assumed responsibility for the public health of the village, especially its infants, and helped raise money for the church.53 Overall, reproductive l­ abor was a decidedly communal affair in Samoa. Since the ­house­hold was the basic unit of production and the center of Samoan life, individual h ­ ouse­holds in a village cooperated in food production and cash cropping. House­holds also pooled resources to contribute to the village church and ­family ceremonies. ­Family members maintained the surrounding ­house­hold area, prepared food, took care of livestock, produced ­house­hold items, gathered fruit and seafood, and hunted for pigeons.54 Daily social reproduction, carried on by Samoan ­women, was thus inextricably linked to the production of copra, carried on by Samoan men. As the guardians of f­ amily life, w ­ omen guaranteed the continuity of cultural practices as well as the material foundations of Samoan society. Gendered forms of Samoan ­labor underwent a major transformation ­under coconut colonialism. The increasing presence of missionaries and traders had dif­fer­ent effects on Samoan men and w ­ omen. On the one hand, Christian concepts of specifically masculine and feminine duties and responsibilities denigrated forms of ­labor outside the ­house­hold that Samoan ­women traditionally performed, such as lagoon fishing. On the other hand, the need for cash to pay for new goods gave a boost to traditionally masculine forms of ­labor, such as heavy plantation ­labor and military ser­vice. ­After 1900, Samoan men by and large s­ topped fighting one another in large and drawn-­out wars; quit the manufacture of handcrafted tools, including fishhooks and weapons; and went fishing far less frequently. Instead, they increasingly focused on producing cash crops and went to secondary school to train for the new white-­collar occupations on which colonial administrations depended.55 By contrast, mission schools for girls, such as the boarding school run by the LMS in Papauta, taught Samoan girls basic literacy and numeracy, childcare, and h ­ ouse­keeping. Domestic work and nursing, two of the new paths to social mobility open to Samoan girls, w ­ ere primarily seen as interim occupations that would bridge the time between the end of school and marriage. Heavi­ly influenced by the doctrine of separate spheres, missionaries (and, to a lesser extent, colonial officials) regarded Samoan higher education\n\n34\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nas the exclusive domain of boys. As wealth and education along the colonizers’ model became the new ave­nues for prestige and status, they remained barred to most Samoan ­women. U ­ ntil the 1920s, only a select few Samoan ­women had ­careers of their own as domestic workers or nurses.56 As missionaries imposed their doctrine of separate spheres and plantation ­owners expanded their cash crop economy, Samoan w ­ omen saw their traditional forms of ­labor both marginalized and domesticated. ­Because many ­Samoan ­children attended mission schools, Samoan m ­ others did not have to spend as much time supervising their ­children in the mornings. Instead, new ­house­hold tasks emerged: sewing, washing, ironing, cooking, baking, and cleaning the new appliances and furniture that decorated many Samoan homes by the early twentieth ­century.57 Cooking in the earth oven (umu) remained the duty of Samoan men, both on the islands and in ethnographic shows abroad. In addition, w ­ omen w ­ ere often called to help men in food production, as well as copra cutting and drying at peak times. At the same time, Samoan men handled the marketing of the cut copra and received the payments. Hence, Samoan men retained their dominant position in the social hierarchy and gained additional power in the economic realm through cash cropping and preparing for white-­collar jobs that required higher education. In sum, Samoan men’s work was oriented ­toward the cap­i­tal­ist ­future—­owning and managing land, earning cash, receiving higher education—­while the work of most w ­ omen remained entrenched in the pre-­capitalist past—­gardening and domestic work.58 Despite ­these diverging gender trajectories, Samoan ­women seized the new opportunities that the colonial world presented. For example, Samoan girls ­were highly sought a­ fter as domestic workers in the h ­ ouse­holds of wealthy Euro-­American plantation o ­ wners, colonial officials, and missionaries. Some Samoan ­women also washed clothes and cooked for the young, male, and predominantly single plantation workers from Melanesia and China. A group of Samoan w ­ omen in Leone, Tutuila, even produced tapa cloth (siapo) for local sale and export.59 Led by master artist Kolone Fai’ivae Leoso, the Samoan artists produced thousands of siapo in multiple colors. In the late 1920s, ­ other they sold their siapo to Mary J. Pritchard, the ­daughter of a Samoan m and white American f­ ather, who exported Samoan products to traders in Ho­ omen’s committees continued the long tradition nolulu.60 Fi­nally, Samoan w of female-­only work groups and church ­women’s auxiliaries. Founded in 1919\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n35\n\nby Dr. Mabel Christie, the ­women’s committees ­were initially set up to improve public hygiene in American Samoan villages. The committees also spread to Western Samoa and broadened their mandates to include fund­rais­ ing, making them leading actors in the Mau movement against American and New Zealand colonial rule in the mid-1920s.61\n\nMaking Samoans Work As in most Pacific colonies at the time, Samoans ­under German and American rule ­were not directly forced to work for the export economy.62 It was the very strength of the Samoan agricultural economy and the military muscle it supported that forced colonial officials in both German and American Samoa to pursue a strategy of accommodation. This paternalistic policy of salvage colonialism was most vis­i­ble in the German-­controlled part of the islands. Governor Solf fashioned himself into the “­father” of his Samoan “­children,” protecting them from the corrupting influence of Euro-­American cap­i­tal­ist modernity—­especially in the form of wage ­labor and consumer commodities.63 In Solf’s eyes, his duty in Samoa was “merely to guard it as what it is—­a ­little paradise—­and to do my best to keep the passing serpent out of our Garden of Eden.”64 Using the colony as a living experiment in social engineering, German colonial officials deemed Samoans worthy of protection from the brutal forces of coconut colonialism they themselves had helped unleash.65 Not incidentally, Solf’s policy left Samoans firmly tied to small-­scale agriculture and at a safe distance from some of the new opportunities that colonization opened up. And while Solf’s salvage colonialism aimed to maintain order among the colonized, the paternalism practiced by plantation o ­ wners sought to extract as much of their l­abor power as pos­si­ ble. ­A fter a violent revolt by the Herero and Nama in German Southwest Africa broke out in the spring of 1904, Solf’s less overtly confrontational “native policy” gained even more legitimacy in the eyes of Euro-­A merican settlers and the colonial press.66 Since Samoans ­were not forced to work and continued to rely on sustainable farming, it is l­ittle won­der they found the cash incentives of plantation ­labor insufficient. Most Samoans remained landholding producers, and only a small number performed casual day ­labor on foreign-­owned copra plantations. If subaltern workers are, by definition, forced to sell their ­labor power,\n\n36\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nthen Samoans did not belong in this category.67 Accustomed as they w ­ ere to the sporadic nature of communal l­abor in ser­vice of their families, most Samoan men found it hard to adjust to the radically dif­fer­ent time and l­abor discipline prevailing on large-­scale Euro-­American plantations. Perhaps the most significant difference lay in the ability of Samoan workers engaged in farming to choose the timing and intensity of their l­abor tasks. Plantation ­labor, by contrast, demanded continuous physical exertion to produce crops that would not directly benefit one’s community but instead be shipped to distant markets in San Francisco and Hamburg. Samoans quickly came to realize the fundamental difference between their traditional agricultural ­labor as ser­vice to one’s community (tautua) and the alienating l­ abor required on foreign-­owned plantations (gālue). Workers attached dif­fer­ent meanings to their ­labor, which influenced their willingness to perform it. In d ­ oing so, Samoans reshaped the forces of colonial globality, which pressured them to become plantation workers, into Oceanian globality, centered around the core values of their moral economy. ­Under the official policy of salvage colonialism, German colonial officials ­were constantly preoccupied with boosting copra production. Their concerns ­were understandable ­because throughout the nineteenth ­century and into the colonial era, Samoans ­were, by far, the largest producers of copra. In 1896, Samoans produced as much as 80 ­percent of the overall copra exports that year on their ­family plantations.68 The remaining 20 ­percent w ­ ere produced by the DHPG, the largest foreign trading com­pany operating in Samoa at the time. Given Samoans’ preponderant role in copra production and their general unwillingness to work on foreign plantations, Euro-­American plantation ­owners, traders, and colonial officials sought to devise dif­fer­ent means for increasing agricultural output. Throughout the nineteenth ­century, violent conflicts among competing Samoan parties, fueled by Euro-­American colonialists themselves, had put severe limits on the time and resources Samoans could devote to food production, sometimes resulting in famines.69 During the turbulent years of the tridominium between 1889 and 1899, German diplomats in Apia regularly reported on the relationship between war and economic stagnation. German consul Biermann noted in April 1894 that during times of Samoan war, agricultural production was interrupted, forcing many Samoans to consume their coconuts instead of selling them as dried copra. Even worse, the\n\nC o c on u ts\n\n37\n\nconsul observed, Samoans had to be supplied with provisions from German plantations, which offered the only sources of food in times of war. As a result, Biermann concluded, the copra trade came to a halt, plantation output decreased, Samoan purchasing power declined, and imports and exports ­ ecause continued warfare among Samoans—­f ueled in no small dropped.70 B part by the competing interests of the colonial powers—­had a negative impact on agricultural exports, the pressure to ensure po­liti­cal stability on the islands increased. Po­liti­cal tension subsided in 1899, when Samoa was divided into a German part in the west and an American part in the east. Driven by the economic interests of German traders and plantations o ­ wners (especially the DHPG), the German colonial administration lost l­ ittle time in exerting pressure on Samoan farmers. On August 31, 1900, only a few months into formal annexation, Governor Solf passed a regulation requiring ­every Samoan head of f­ amily to plant fifty coconut trees a year. On average, it took around six thousand mature Samoan coconuts to produce a single ton of copra. Samoan officials w ­ ere appointed to inspect plantations on a regular basis and punish individuals who failed their quota.71 This stricter policy was hard to enforce, but it did lead to a considerable increase in the number of coconut trees in German Samoa. By 1908, ­there w ­ ere 455,280 coconut trees on German plantations, of which more than 90 ­percent belonged to the DHPG.72 Between 1900 and 1913, more than one million new coconut trees w ­ ere planted in Savaiʻi and Upolu. Over the same period, however, overall copra output did not increase significantly.73 This was mainly due to the fact that most Samoans, while following the official mandate to plant new trees, did not substantially increase their workload and produced and sold only as many coconuts as they needed to survive and earn cash. Even so, Samoan stands of coconut trees covered three times the area of Eu­ro­pean copra plantations.74 In line with Solf’s salvage colonialism, Samoan landholdings, on which sustainable farming depended, had come to be legally protected. To secure the “natu­ral fruit lands of Samoans,” the Berlin Act of 1899 had prohibited the sale of all lands outside the municipal district of Apia.75 In November 1907, a regulation passed by the German colonial administration confirmed this ban in princi­ple but enlarged the area in which the sale of Samoan lands was allowed.76 From then on, no Samoan lands ­were to be sold outside the “plantation district”—an\n\nCommerce, 1964 / 546 Anhang.\n\nFigure 3. ​Map of DHPG plantations in German Samoa, 1900.

In addition, e­ very Samoan was guaranteed at least 3.2 acres of land to cultivate. Its good intentions notwithstanding, the regulation clearly benefited the largest landholder outside the plantation district: the DHPG.77 The German com­pany now enjoyed a “virtual mono­poly of land which other Eu­ro­pe­ans could buy.”78 A DHPG business report from 1907 duly noted that the com­pany could proceed to sell the majority of its uncultivated lands at a profit.79 Other strategies the colonial administrations pursued to increase agricultural production among Samoans included restrictions on Samoan travel, the introduction of copra kilns, and head taxes. Samoans had a long tradition of visiting relatives in other villages and islands to strengthen the bonds of ­family and forge po­liti­cal alliances. Visiting parties (malaga) ­were treated to huge displays of generosity punctuated by po­liti­cal conversation and the ceremonial exchange of goods. ­Because some malaga could last for weeks, the economic burden on both hosts and guests could be ­great. At the same time, malaga allowed families suffering from food shortages to temporarily relieve their plantations and helped them address local economic crises.80 In any case, Samoans rarely approached cultural traditions such as malaga in purely economic terms. A Samoan matai interviewed in the early 1930s defended this comprehensive outlook on life, shared by many Samoans: “The white ­people condemn many Samoan customs as being wasteful. Their idea is that customs that interfere with working and making money are bad. But such customs give plea­sure to the Samoans and are almost their only form of amusement. To travel and to entertain ­t hose who travel makes life in­ter­est­ ing. A life filled with nothing but work would not be worth living.”81 Euro-­American colonial officials had dif­fer­ent views. Intent on putting the new colony into value, they saw Samoan malaga as a quaint nuisance at best and an inexcusable waste of time and resources at worst. As a result, in 1903 Solf reached an agreement with the U.S. naval administration in American Samoa that prohibited Samoans from g­ oing on malaga between Upolu and Tutuila. In line with his policy of paternalistic preservationism, Solf refused to ban all Samoan malaga outright.82 Samoans experienced the partition of their islands in 1899 most directly when they went on malaga to visit relatives across the new interimperial boundary between Upolu and Tutuila. ­These trips, while not impossible, became increasingly troublesome\n\n40\n\nC o c on u t C ol on i a l ism\n\nas German and American authorities stepped up control of population movements.83 At the same time, Solf and other high-­ranking colonial officials ­adopted the practice of visiting dif­fer­ent parts of the colony, often to ­great effect. The ban on visiting parties caused considerable opposition among Samoan matai, who saw one of their traditional privileges threatened. The first Mau movement led by Lauaki Namulau‘ulu Mamoe in 1908 emerged partly in response to this ban on malaga, as did the second Mau movement against New Zealand rule in the mid-1920s. The introduction of copra kilns by colonial officials was another attempt to increase Samoan copra production. While the larger trading companies like the DHPG had been using copra dryers and kilns since the early 1890s, Samoans continued to rely on the traditional method of drying coconut meat in the sun.84 On average, green copra yielded up to 68 ­percent dried meat.85 Compared to sun drying, kilns made the drying of coconuts more reliable and efficient. Up to five days of drying coconuts in the sun could be reduced to one day in the kiln, using the shells as fuel.86 Colonial officials followed the DHPG in giving preference to the “plantation copra” over the “trader copra,” primarily ­because of its higher quality and storage life.87 In the fall of 1907, a member of the German Colonial Economic Committee recommended to the German Colonial Office that it purchase copra kilns and rent them out to Samoans during the rainy season.88 Shortly thereafter, a DHPG man­ag­er wrote to Governor Solf about the need to increase the use of copra kilns among Samoans. The DHPG, the man­ag­er noted, had “already"
