For example, a messaging app may request access to your contacts to find friends who are using the same app. After you grant or deny access, you can change access later.\n\nGo to Settings > Privacy & Security.\n\nTap a category of information, such as Calendars, Reminders, or Motion & Fitness.\n\nA list appears showing the apps that requested access. You can turn access on or off for any app on the list.\n\nGo to Settings > Privacy & Security, then tap App Privacy Report.\n\nThe App Privacy Report shows you how apps are using the permissions you granted them and shows you their network activity.\n\nTo turn off the report and delete its data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > App Privacy Report, then tap Turn Off App Privacy Report. You can return to this Settings screen to turn the report on again."
