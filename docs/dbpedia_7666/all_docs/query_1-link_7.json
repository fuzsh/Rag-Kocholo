        "text": "See the Treatment section of the Voice Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nIntervention is conducted to achieve improved voice production and coordination of respiration and laryngeal valving. The ASHA Practice Portal page on Head and Neck Cancer addresses intervention aimed at acquisition of alaryngeal speech sufficient to allow for functional oral communication.\n\nIntervention is designed to\n\nestablish appropriate vocal hygiene routines/practices;\n\ncapitalize on strengths and address weaknesses related to underlying structures and functions that affect voice production;\n\nimprove self-awareness of voice quality and kinesthetic factors (e.g., tension);\n\nfacilitate the individual’s activities and life participation by assisting the person in acquiring new communication skills and strategies;\n\nmodify contextual factors to reduce barriers and enhance facilitators of successful communication and participation; and\n\nprovide appropriate accommodations and other supports as well as training in how to use them.\n\nVoice use within different settings should be considered when determining vocal needs and establishing goals. For example, vocal needs within the workplace may be different from those within the community (e.g., home and social settings).\n\nCollaborating With Other Professionals\n\nSLPs often team with otolaryngologists/laryngologists and other medical professionals (e.g., pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, allergists, endocrinologists, and occupational medicine physicians) and, if appropriate, develop treatment plans to support the medical plan and to optimize outcomes. Collaboration with otolaryngologists/laryngologists is especially important to rule in or rule out underlying pathologies. SLPs can only diagnose functional abnormalities, and only otolaryngologists can diagnose organic pathologies (e.g., nodules, polyps, tumors).\n\nSome individuals develop voice disorders in the absence of structural pathology (e.g., functional aphonia, muscle tension dysphonia, and mutational/functional falsetto) and may benefit from psychological counseling in addition to what can be provided by the SLP. Counseling, direct manipulation of the voice, and use of interview questions can be used to probe possible factors contributing to the voice problem. SLPs refer the individual to the appropriate health care professional(s) to address issues outside the SLP’s scope of practice (ASHA, 2016).\n\nSee ASHA’s resources on collaboration and teaming and interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP).\n\nTreatment Approaches\n\nApproaches can be direct or indirect, and SLPs often incorporate aspects of more than one therapeutic approach in developing a treatment plan.\n\nDirect Approaches\n\nDirect approaches focus on manipulating the voice-producing mechanisms (phonation, respiration, and musculoskeletal function) to modify vocal behaviors and establish healthy voice production (Colton & Casper, 2011; Stemple, 2000).\n\nIndirect Approaches\n\nIndirect approaches modify the cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and physical environments in which voicing occurs (Roy et al., 2001; Thomas & Stemple, 2007). Indirect approaches include the following two components:\n\nPatient education—discussing normal physiology of voice production and the impact of voice disorders on function; providing information about the impact of vocal misuse and strategies for maintaining vocal health (vocal hygiene).\n\nCounseling—identifying and implementing strategies such as stress management to modify psychosocial factors that negatively affect vocal health (Van Stan et al., 2015).\n\nTherapeutic Plan\n\nA therapeutic plan typically involves at least one direct approach and one or more indirect approaches based on the patient’s condition and goals. Some clinicians concentrate on directly modifying the specific symptoms of the inappropriate voice, whereas others take a more holistic approach, with the goal of balancing the physiologic subsystems of voice production—respiration, phonation, and resonance.\n\nClinicians may begin by\n\nidentifying behaviors that are contributing to the voice problems, including unhealthy vocal hygiene practices such as\n\nshouting,\n\ntalking loudly over noise,\n\ncoughing,\n\nthroat clearing, and\n\npoor hydration.\n\nimplementing practices to reduce vocally traumatic behaviors (e.g., voice conservation) and healthy vocal hygiene practices such as\n\ndrinking plenty of water and\n\ntalking at a moderate volume.\n\nUse of personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e., face mask) can potentially cause increased strain on voice and perception of vocal effort (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Please see ASHA's Aerosol Generating Procedures and the Resources section below for further information.\n\nPediatric Voice Treatment Considerations\n\nThere may be differences between treating voice disorders in adults and pediatrics due to differences in anatomy, etiology, and developmental level. According to Braden (2018), anatomical differences between pediatric and adult voice include the following:\n\nlaryngeal size\n\nsize of the vocal tract\n\nstructure (pediatric vocal folds)\n\nPediatric vocal folds are shorter than adult vocal folds.\n\nPediatric vocal folds lack the five-layer structure until adolescence.\n\nstructure (infant vocal folds)\n\nInfant vocal folds are monolayer.\n\nInfant vocal folds have hyaluronic acid distributed evenly (concentrated in adults).\n\nInfant vocal folds have more fibroblasts than adults in the lamina propria.\n\npositioning of the larynx (McAllister & Sjölander, 2013)\n\nThe newborn larynx is located at approximately C4.\n\nThe adult larynx is located at approximately C6-C7.\n\nAs a child’s phonatory structures grow and develop, the respective speaking pitch decreases (decreased frequency of vocal tract formants and fundamental frequency). There is a rapid decrease in mean fundamental frequency in the first 3 years, with another significant change at puberty (McAllister & Sjölander, 2013). Abnormal voice changes may be monitored during adolescence as they may be indicative of a functional voice disorder such as puberphonia. Stridor should also be closely monitored in the pediatric population as it could potentially indicate a compromised airway (Theis, 2010).\n\nMany treatment approaches used for adult populations may be considered for the pediatric population, although adaptations may be needed to meet each child’s developmental level (Braden, 2018). Comorbid developmental disorders such as expressive or receptive language deficits may further complicate treatment of voice in the pediatric population. Some children may not have an internal concept of normal versus abnormal voicing (Hooper, 2004) and, therefore, may have difficulty addressing dysfunction.\n\nAnother consideration is potential difficulties that may occur in obtaining treatment in the school-based setting. Challenges may include\n\ndifficulty obtaining referrals to ENT/voice specialists,\n\ndelays in scheduling pediatrician and/or ENT visits,\n\ndifficulty accessing imaging and medical records,\n\ninsurance coverage or payment for MD visits, and\n\nbarriers in eligibility criteria and determining adverse effects on educational performance.\n\nPlease see Childes et al. (2017) for further consideration of barriers and challenges.\n\nTreatment Options\n\nThe following subsections offer brief descriptions of general and specific treatments for individuals with voice disorders. They are organized under two categories: physiologic voice therapy (i.e., those treatments that directly modify the physiology of the vocal mechanism) and symptomatic voice therapy (i.e., those treatments aimed at modifying deviant vocal symptoms or perceptual voice components using a variety of facilitating techniques). The inclusion of any specific treatment approach does not imply endorsement by ASHA. For more information about treatment approaches and their use with various voice disorders, see Stemple et al. (2010).\n\nTreatment selection depends on the type and severity of the disorder and the communication needs of the individual. Clinicians incorporate functional daily voice needs into goals that reflect inclusion and participation in home, work, and social communities. Linguistic features in some languages may influence the need for specific aspects of voice treatment, such as influences of tonal languages on resonance. In addition, consideration of individuals’ needs, such as gender and/or gender expression or use of regional accents, is an important aspect of goal development.\n\nPhysiologic Voice Therapy\n\nPhysiologic voice therapy programs strive to balance the three subsystems of voice production (respiration, phonation, and resonance) as opposed to working directly on isolated voice symptoms. Most physiologic approaches may be used with a variety of disorders that result in hyper- and hypofunctional vocal patterns. Below are some of the physiologic voice therapy programs, arranged in alphabetical order.\n\nAccent Method\n\nThe accent method is designed to increase pulmonary output, improve glottic efficiency, reduce excessive muscular tension, and normalize the vibratory pattern during phonation. During therapy, the clinician may do one or more of the following tasks (Kotby et al., 1993; Malki et al., 2008):\n\nfacilitate abdominal breathing by initially placing the patient in a recumbent position;\n\nuse rhythmic vocal play with models of accented phonation patterns, which the patient then imitates; and/or\n\ntransfer rhythms to articulated speech, initially being given a model and eventually progressing through reading, monologues, and conversational speech.\n\nConversation Training Therapy (CTT)\n\nCTT focuses exclusively on voice awareness and production in patient-driven conversational narrative, without the use of a traditional therapeutic hierarchy. Grounded in the tenets of motor learning, CTT strives to guide patients in achieving balanced phonation through clinician reinforcement, imitation and modeling in conversational speech. CTT incorporates six interchangeable components (Gartner-Schmidt et al., 2016; Gillespie et al., 2019), as follows:\n\nclear speech\n\nauditory and kinesthetic awareness\n\nnegative practice/labeling\n\nembedding basic training gestures into speech\n\nprosody, projection, and pauses\n\nrapport building\n\nExpiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST)\n\nEMST improves respiratory strength during phonation. Increase in maximum expiratory pressure can be trained with specific calibrated exercises over time, thus improving the relationship between respiration, phonation, and resonance. EMST uses an external device to mechanically overload the expiratory muscles. The device has a one-way, spring-loaded valve that blocks the flow of air until the targeted expiratory pressure is produced. The device can be calibrated to increase or decrease physiologic load on the targeted muscles (Pitts et al., 2009).\n\nLee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT)\n\nLSVT (Ramig et al., 1994) is an intensive treatment developed for patients with Parkinson’s disease. It is designed to maximize phonatory and respiratory function using a set of simple tasks. Individuals are instructed to produce a loud voice with maximum effort and to monitor the loudness of their voices while speaking. The effort that is involved generates improved respiratory support, laryngeal muscle activity, articulation, and even facial expression and animation. Using a sound-level meter, visual biofeedback may be provided to demonstrate the effort necessary to increase loudness. LSVT is provided by clinicians who are trained and certified in the administration of this technique.\n\nFive basic principles are followed in LSVT, as follows:\n\nIndividuals should “think loud.”\n\nSpeech effort must be high.\n\nTreatment must be intensive.\n\nPatients must recalibrate their loudness level.\n\nImprovements are quantified over time.\n\nManual Circumlaryngeal Techniques\n\nManual circumlaryngeal techniques are intended to reduce musculoskeletal tension and hyperfunction by re-posturing the larynx during phonation. There are three main manual laryngeal re-posturing techniques, as follows:\n\nPush-back maneuver—place forefinger on the thyroid cartilage and push back to change the shape of the glottis.\n\nPull-down maneuver—place thumb and forefinger in the thyrohyoid space and pull the larynx downward.\n\nMedial compression and downward traction—place thumb and forefinger in the thyrohyoid space and apply medial compression.\n\nApplying these maneuvers during vocalization allows the individual to hear resulting changes in voice quality (Andrews, 2006; Roy et al., 1997). Care is taken when employing these techniques, as some patients report discomfort.\n\nPhonation Resistance Training Exercises (PhoRTE)\n\nPhoRTE (Ziegler & Hapner, 2013) was adapted from LSVT and consists of four exercises, as follows:\n\nproducing /a/ with loud maximum sustained phonation\n\nproducing /a/ with loud ascending and descending pitch glides over the entire pitch range\n\nproducing functional phrases using a loud and high (pitched) voice\n\nproducing the same functional phrases using a loud and low (pitched) voice\n\nIndividuals are reminded to maintain a “strong” voice throughout these treatment exercises. PhoRTE has a less intensive intervention schedule than LSVT. PhoRTE also differs in that it combines both loudness and pitch when producing phrases (i.e., loud and low pitch, loud and high pitch). Use of PhoRTE has been studied in adults with presbyphonia (aging voice) as a way to improve vocal outcomes (e.g., decrease phonatory effort) and increase voice-related quality of life (Ziegler et al., 2014).\n\nResonant Voice Therapy\n\nResonant voice therapy uses a continuum of oral sensations and easy phonation, building from basic speech gestures through conversational speech. Resonant voice is defined as voice production involving oral vibratory sensations, usually on the anterior alveolar ridge or lips or higher in the face in the context of easy phonation. The goal of resonant voice therapy is to achieve the strongest, “cleanest” possible voice with the least effort and impact between the vocal folds to minimize the likelihood of injury and maximize the likelihood of vocal health (Stemple et al., 2010). The program incorporates humming and both voiced and voiceless productions that are shaped into phrase and conversational productions (Verdolini, 1998, 2000).\n\nStretch and Flow Phonation\n\nStretch and flow phonation—also known as Casper-Stone Flow Phonation—is a physiological technique used to treat functional dysphonia or aphonia (Stone & Casteel, 1982). It focuses on airflow management and is used for individuals with breath-holding tendencies. Individuals are instructed to focus on a steady outflow of air during exhalation. Various biofeedback methods are used, including placing a piece of tissue in front of the mouth or holding one’s hand in front of the mouth to monitor airflow. Voicing is introduced once the individual masters continuous airflow during exhalation. As such, this technique produces a breathy voice quality and a slowed speaking rate. Eventually, this voice quality is carried into trials with spoken words and phrases, and the breathiness is gradually reduced.\n\nFlow phonation (Gartner-Schmidt, 2008, 2010) is a hierarchical therapy program designed to facilitate increased airflow, ease of phonation, and forward oral resonance. It was modified from stretch and flow phonation by eliminating the “stretch” component, which reduced the rate of speech in the original therapy.\n\nVocal Function Exercises (VFEs)\n\nVFEs are a series of systematic voice manipulations designed to facilitate return to healthy voice function. VFEs work to strengthen and coordinate laryngeal musculature and improve efficiency of the relationship among airflow, vocal fold vibration, and supraglottic treatment of phonation (Stemple, 1984). Sounds used in training are specific, and correct production is encouraged. VFEs consist of four exercises—warm-up, stretching, contracting, and power exercises. Exercises are completed twice a day (morning and evening) in sets of two. Maximum phonation time goals are set on the basis of individual lung capacity and an airflow rate of 80 mL/sec. Individuals are advised to use a soft, engaged tone and are trained to use a semi-occluded vocal tract (SOVT) without tension during voice productions.\n\nSymptomatic Voice Therapy\n\nSymptomatic voice therapy focuses on the modification of vocal symptoms or perceptual voice components. Symptomatic voice therapy assumes voice improvement through direct symptom modification using a variety of voice facilitating techniques (Boone et al., 2010) that are either direct or indirect. Symptoms to be addressed may include\n\npitch that is too high or too low,\n\nvoice that is too soft or too loud,\n\nbreathy phonation,\n\nhard glottal attacks, or\n\nglottal fry.\n\nAmplification\n\nAmplification devices such as microphones can be used to increase voice loudness in any situation that requires increased volume (e.g., when speaking to large groups or during conversation when the individual’s voice is weak). As such, voice amplification can function as a supportive tool or as a means of augmentative communication. It can help prevent vocal hyperfunction that may be a result of talking at increased volume or for extended periods of time.\n\nAuditory Masking\n\nAuditory masking is used in cases of functional aphonia/dysphonia and often results in changed or normal phonation. Individuals are instructed to talk or read passages aloud while wearing headphones with masking noise input. Using a loud noise background, the individual often produces voice at increased volume (Lombard effect) that can be recorded and used later in treatment as a comparison (e.g., Adams & Lang, 1992; Brumm & Zollinger, 2011).\n\nBiofeedback\n\nBiofeedback is the concept that self-control of physiologic functions is possible given external monitoring of internal bodily state. Biofeedback may be kinesthetic, auditory, or visual and is intended to provide clear and reliable information in response to alterations in voice production. Thus, patients may make real-time adjustments regarding vocal pitch, loudness, quality, and effort. Ideally, biofeedback helps increase awareness of physical sensations with respect to respiration, body position, and vibratory sensation. This awareness may help individuals understand physiological processes when generating voice.\n\nChant Speech\n\nChant speech uses a rhythmic, prosodic pattern as a template for spoken utterances. It is used in therapy to help reduce phonatory effort that results in vocal fatigue and decreased phonatory capabilities. Chant speech requires pitch fluctuations and coordination of respiratory, phonatory, and resonance subsystems. Speakers habituate to these more efficient vocal patterns. The increased lung pressure required for these tasks may also decrease reliance on laryngeal resistance and reduce fatigue (e.g., McCabe & Titze, 2002).\n\nConfidential Voice\n\nConfidential voice is designed to reduce laryngeal tension/hyperfunction and increase airflow (Casper, 2000). The individual begins with an easy and breathy vocal quality and builds to normal voicing without decreasing airflow. This technique is intended to address excessive vocal tension and to facilitate relaxation in the muscles of the larynx.\n\nInhalation Phonation\n\nInhalation phonation is used to facilitate true vocal vibration in the presence of habitual ventricular fold phonation, functional aphonia, and/or muscle tension dysphonia. Individuals produce a high-pitched voice on inhalation. Upon inhalation voicing, the true vocal folds are in a stretched position, suddenly adducted, and in vibration. Upon exhalation, patients try to achieve a nearly matched voice. This approach eases the way to gaining true vocal fold vibration.\n\nPosture\n\nThe patient is instructed in the technique of sitting with upright posture and with the shoulders in a low, relaxed position to facilitate voice production with less effort. Collaboration with a physical therapist or an occupational therapist may be necessary with some patients.\n\nRelaxation\n\nIn cases of vocal hyperfunction, a variety of relaxation techniques may be useful as a tool to reduce both whole-body and laryngeal area tension. The goal of these techniques is to reduce effortful phonation. Frequently used techniques include progressive muscle relaxation (slowly tensing and then relaxing successive muscle groups), visualization (forming mental images of a peaceful, calming place or situation), and deep breathing exercises.\n\nSemi-Occluded Vocal Tract (SOVT) Exercises\n\nSOVT exercises involve narrowing at any supraglottic point along the vocal tract in order to maximize interaction between vocal fold vibration (sound production) and the vocal tract (the sound filter) and to produce resonant voice.\n\nCup bubble, also known as Lax Vox, is an aerodynamic building task aimed at improving the ability to sustain phonation while speaking. It is done by having a patient blow air initially into a cup of water without voice. Voicing can be added for subsequent trials, and in time, pitch can be altered across and within trials. Eventually, the cup is removed during voicing, and the phonation continues. These exercises are thought to widen the vocal tract during phonation and reduce tension in the vocal folds. Biofeedback increases the individual’s awareness of their healthy voice production (e.g., Denizoglu & Sihvo, 2010; Simberg & Laine, 2007).\n\nStraw phonation is one of the most frequently used methods to create semi-occlusion in the vocal tract (Titze, 2006). Narrowing the vocal tract increases air pressure above the vocal folds, keeping them slightly separated during phonation and reducing the impact collision force. To accomplish this, the individual semi-occludes the vocal tract by phonating through a straw or tube. Resistance can be manipulated by varying the length and diameter of the straw or immersing the opposite end of the straw in water. Individuals practice sustaining vowels, performing pitch glides, humming songs, and transitioning to the intonation and stress patterns of speech. Eventually, use of the straw is reduced and eliminated.\n\nLip trills can be used to create semi-occlusion at the level of the lips. This technique involves a smooth movement of air through the oral cavity and over the lips, causing a vibration (lip buzz), similar to blowing bubbles underwater. Often, the trills are paired with phonation and pitch changes. The focus is to improve breath support and produce voicing without tension.\n\nTwang Therapy\n\nTwang therapy is used for individuals with hypophonic voice. It involves the narrowing of the aryepiglottic sphincter using a “twang” voice to create a high-intensity voice quality while maintaining low vocal effort (Lombard & Steinhauer, 2007). The desired outcome is decreasing phonatory effort and increasing vocal efficiency.\n\nYawn-Sigh\n\nThis facilitating technique uses the natural functions of yawning and sighing to overcome symptoms of vocal hyperfunction (e.g., elevated larynx and vocal constriction). The technique is intended to lower the position of the larynx and subsequently widen the supraglottal space in order to produce a more relaxed voice and encourage a more natural pitch.\n\nTreatment Considerations: Telepractice and Telecommuting\n\nSLPs should take appropriate measures whether services are being delivered in-person or through telepractice. Teletherapy may not provide as reliable sound quality as in-person. Therefore, additional equipment (e.g., microphones) can enhance vocal quality while reducing vocal strain. Additionally, SLPs should take into consideration whether or not the patient is telecommuting for their profession, as there is some emerging research regarding effects of telecommunications on voice (Tracy et al., 2020).\n\nPlease see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice and ASHA’s Telepractice Evidence Map.\n\nTreatment Considerations: Rehabilitation of Professional Voice\n\nAdditional training/education may be necessary to provide professional voice rehabilitation. Clients who use their voice professionally (e.g., singers, voice actors) may have different needs than the usual client with a voice disorder and may seek services from multiple disciplines, including:\n\nan otolaryngologist\n\nan SLP\n\na singing teacher\n\na voice and speech trainer\n\nService Delivery\n\nRefer to the Service Delivery section of the Voice Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nIn addition to determining the type of speech and language treatment that is optimal for individuals with voice disorders, SLPs consider other service delivery variables—including format, provider, dosage, and timing—that may affect treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat—the structure of the treatment session (e.g., group vs. individual; direct and/or consultative).\n\nProvider—the person offering the treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, caregiver).\n\nDosage—the frequency, intensity, and duration of service. Clinicians consider the unique needs of each patient and the nature of the voice disorder in determining appropriate dosage for therapy. Some voice therapy programs will have specific dosage parameters. See De Bodt et al. (2015) for a summary of international practices regarding temporal variables (dosage and frequency) in voice therapy.\n\nTiming—when intervention is conducted relative to the diagnosis.\n\nSetting—location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based, work).\n\nAdams, S.
