        "text": "Voice of OCEA’s Norberto Santana Jr.\n\nA new blog site rolled out earlier this month and thus far has not made too much of a splash. The “Voice of OC”, or what it should more appropriately be called the “Voice of OCEA”, has glossed itself “Orange County’s Nonprofit Investigative News Agency”. Yah right, just like the Liberal OC is “Challenging Orange County’s Right-Wing Noise Machine”.\n\nWednesday must have been a particularly slow news day for Editor-in-Chief Norberto Santana Jr. and the rest of the folks on his staff. Santana wrote a ridiculous post entitled “The Mellowing Effect of Elections in Santa Ana” in which he ridicules the Santa Ana City Council for presenting proclomations and for honoring folks, including veterans, at the city council meeting. I wonder if he’d be complaining if the “Voice’s” sugar daddy Nick Beradino was being honored.\n\nSantana opines, “You can tell we’ve hit election season in Santa Ana just by showing up at a city council meeting and seeing how council members spend their time.”\n\nUhh Norberto the Santa Ana City Council meetings have been filled with all this fluff for decades election year or not. Your bio says you “spent a decade covering local governments across Southern California”, I guess you never made it to Santa Ana for a council meeting.\n\nClick here to read the rest of this post."
