        "text": "Artemis Bell worked as a night custodian at Disney in Anaheim for nearly 10 years. She had hoped the job would give her enough economic security to go back to school for theater studies and to pursue her other creative interests. But financial insecurity meant spending her free time grappling with housing and transportation issues and Artemis’ life goals got put on hold. She found that working with the Disney chapter of the SEIU was sometimes rewarding, but also time-consuming. Last year Artemis decided to leave Disney and is now working as a barista. She is also managing rental properties for a friend. Most importantly she’s working on a low-budget feature film.\n\nRalph and Trina Blair met and fell in love while working the night shift as custodians at Disney. They married and are raising their three daughters and Trina’s son from her first marriage. Housing is so expensive in the region, that even working full time, the couple cannot afford to buy or rent a home, so they live with Trina’s mother in crowded conditions. In 2019, Ralph, with Trina’s help, spearheaded the creation of the SEIU food pantry for Disney workers. Hundreds of people have come to rely on the help. Ralph’s vision was that the people who come to the pantry would not only receive food but information on government services that could help with health care and housing. He also found a way to provide diapers and baby formula to families with infants. After the pandemic, Ralph left his job at Disney, deciding it was more important to stay home and care for the kids full time. Trina has moved to the day shift. She is now working the rides, her favorite is Dumbo.\n\nHeather designs and promotes solutions to inequality in America.
