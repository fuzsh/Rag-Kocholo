        "text": "10 days ago, I earned not just one but two Top Voice badges on Linkedin. It was the result of 3 weeks of experimentation to see if I could figure out what was required to earn such distinction. At the time, I promised to write up how I had gone about it. So, what follows are my heavily illustrated observations and thoughts but I haven't investigated the matter exhaustively, so your own experience may differ.\n\nIn this article I will cover:\n\nWhat is a Top Voice and how do you become one?\n\nGetting invited to contribute to Linkedin's AI-generated articles\n\nThe relationship between your skill set and what topics you are invited to contribute to\n\nFinding opportunities to contribute to topics and articles\n\nOther thoughts, observations and advice\n\nWhat will likely happen to Top Voice badges going forward?\n\nWhat is a Top Voice and how do you become one\n\nAs far as I can tell, you earn the orange badge of recognition from a combination of two things: 1) contributing to Linkedin's AI-generated articles, and 2) having people mark your contributions as valuable by leaving a 'like' (or similar reaction like 'insightful').\n\nLinkedin's so-called 'cooperative articles' are basically draft articles written by AI, to which selected Linkedin members are invited (via notification in the inbox) to contribute to improve the overall article. It looks like this with the article on the left and contributing comments on the right:\n\nLinkedin makes AI-articles on a wide range of topics. For a full list go to the Linkedin Skill Pages overview. If you look at the posts on the page, you will see all the individual skill pages alphabetically (as of 7 months ago).\n\nHow long did it take me to earn my first badges?\n\nWhile I am not sure of the exact weight Linkedin places on the number of contributions versus the number of contributions getting recognition by the community in the form of likes, I can say that in roughly three weeks I estimate that I have written some 20 contributions for roughly 7-8 articles and probably gotten around 7-12 likes (though my most popular contributions appear to since have increased in the number of likes in the past week). All in all, less effort than I had anticipated when I started my experiment.\n\nGetting invited to contribute to Linkedin's AI-generated articles\n\nSo far, I have only been invited to contribute to articles on two topics: Public Relations and Strategic Communication. My guess is that Linkedin invited me to contribute to these two categories, because for each one I have a 85+ number of people endorsing me for said skill on my profile.\n\nI also imagine that me having switched on Creator Mode on my Linkedin profile helped in some way - but I cannot prove that.\n\nI do not have a Linkedin Premium paid account.\n\nThe invitations have shown up in my inbox seemingly at random intervals. At first, I thought Linkedin was using these notifications to appeal to the pride and vanity of their creators (they write stuff like 'You are among a select few experts invited to contribute to this article' - oh my!) to 'get the ball rolling' on contributions, but the last invitation I received was to contribute to an article that already had 38 contributors adding to it.\n\nThe relationship between your skill set and what topics you are invited to contribute to\n\nAs I said above, I imagine that the initial invite to contribute is based on what Linkedin sees you as a recognized expert in already. But I noticed something funny as I was scrolling through my own profile today: Even though I only have badges for being a Top Voice in Public Relations and Strategic Communication, under my skills I am recognized 4 times?\n\nI checked, and there is a Skill Page for Communication Strategy - but not one for Issues Management. So that does not explain why I cannot pick these extra two badges for my profile.\n\nIt is interesting to note that several of the articles I contributed to were around the topics of Communication Strategy and Issues/crisis management - even though they were labelled under the Skill Pages 'Public Relations' and 'Strategic Communication'. I am guessing that caused this 'spill-over effect' to the skill section on my profile.\n\nFinding opportunities to contribute to topics and articles\n\nEach of these AI-written Linkedin collaborative articles ends with links to explore further opportunities. On the left are suggested articles on the same topic as you have just read and on the right are suggestions for other topics or skills that may interest you.\n\nWhen I follow a link to a new article I can contribute to, I see this orange explainer at the top.\n\nIf you are already a badge owner, you might see an encouragement like this urging you on to continue contributing.\n\nSo far I have not come across a single AI-article that I was not able (technically) to contribute to. Which leads me to think that anyone can click into any article and start contributing - you don't have to wait around for Linkedin to send you an invitation via your notifications. Go to the Skills page, find the skill that most appeals to you and review what articles are currently open for contributions - they are typically listed as posts on the page.\n\nOr, you can simply click to explore all collaborative articles, which takes you to a page with a somewhat chaotic stream of endless article suggestions on a wide range of topics for you to consider. I personally don't really like that option.\n\nIt is worth noting that some skills/topics are listed as sub-categories of other topics and so may not appear unless you search for them or find a direct link.\n\nIf you search, or go via the link at the bottom left of an article (as I illustrated above), you can navigate to a specific skill/topic page which looks like this:\n\nOther thoughts, observations and advice\n\n5 days after the badges appeared on my profile, I got an official email from Linkedin, congratulating me and informing me that the badges will remain for a minimum of 60 days. But, if I want to keep them beyond that Linkedin says, I will have to continue contributing to articles - and be recongnized for my contributions (i.e. 'likes').\n\nConsider carefully the 'fight for eyeballs' between contributors\n\nNaturally, if you want to earn yourself a Top Voice badge, it helps if you have something clever and relevant to say.\n\nYou absolutely can game the system by asking friends and colleagues to like all your contributions (I did that on 2-3 occasions in the name of experimentation).\n\nBut if you want your contributions to have a chance to be seen (and hopefully liked) by random readers, you should be aware that each paragraph in an article only has room to display 1-2 (max 3) contributions. The rest get hidden away behind the link 'See more contributions' for each paragraph. And let's face it: Who clicks that?\n\nNoticable increase in profile views, followers and connection requests\n\nIn the past 10 days, the trafic to my profile has gone up significantly. I am not sure whether Linkedin is somehow showing my profile more in the feeds of others or encouraging them to follow me (I don't think so). And because I don't have Linkedin Premium, I cannot see much data about the trafic before compared to now. But there has been a drastic rise in the number of followers and connection requests compared to the months leading up to getting the badge.\n\nTop Voice badges may not be visible if your language is not set to English?\n\nDuring the course of this last week, my friend Anne Frost noted that if she switches her language settings to any other language than English, she cannot see the badges her connections display. I am not sure whether this is a bug - Linkedin is not responding for a comment.\n\nWhat will likely happen to Top Voice badges going forward?\n\nIn the past month since I started my experiment, the average number of contributions to articles have gone up drastically. In late August hardly any articles about PR had more than a handful of contributions. If you look at the list now, it is hard to find any with fewer than 15 and many have upwards of 30 contributors - each contributing several times in an article.\n\nThis is clever gamification on Linkedin's part of course - it speaks to the creators' vanity and gets more people to spend more time on the platform.\n\nThe real question is: Are the people with the orange Top Voice badges necessarily the best experts out there? In many cases probably not. The system is way too easy to 'game', the badge too easy to earn.\n\nBut for a while it is a novelty, just like so many other Linkedin ideas in the past, and that will draw people to contribute to articles. The quality of most of the articles in their basic, AI-written form is mediocre and the layout is horrible - forcing the user to jump from left to right for each paragraph to get the contributed comments as well. But that doesn't make it a single, wellwritten article - it is a bad article with critique in the footnotes. And for that reason I don't think very many users of Linkedin will pay attention to the articles unless a friend or connection of theirs have contributed - and it shows up in their feed.\n\nProfile visibility may entice some creators to keep contributing\n\nAs I said above, earning a badge may have had something to do with the increased attention my profile has gotten this past week - I am not sure. But if more Top Voices confirm something similar, then maybe that is enough of an incentive for certain types of creators to keep contributing to articles - namely the people who use Linkedin to showcase and sell their personal skills, such as consultants and freelancers.\n\nAll in all, I am sceptical however. To me, this smells too much of a gamification initiative by Linkedin and unfortunately does not have the quality aspect that could have made it a genuine and useful benchmark for Thought Leaders and true experts on the platform.\n\nI hope you found this article useful\n\nIf so, please consider giving it a like and/or a comment. 😊🙏\n\nMy name is Jesper Andersen and I am a strategy consultant specializing in Communication Measurement and Evaluation, Public Relations, Communication Strategy and Thought Leadership.
