        "text": "What is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)?\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a mental health condition that causes an extensive preoccupation with perfectionism, organization and control. These behaviors and thought patterns interfere with completing tasks and maintaining relationships.\n\nPeople with OCPD have rigid beliefs and specific ways of doing different tasks. They don’t allow for any flexibility and are unable to compromise with others. People with OCPD often don’t realize their behavior and way of thinking are problematic.\n\nOCPD is one of a group of conditions called “Cluster C” personality disorders, which involve anxiety and fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat is the difference between OCD and OCPD?\n\nEven though they sound similar, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are different conditions.\n\nOCD is an anxiety disorder in which you have frequent unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Examples of compulsions include flipping a light switch a certain number of times or repeatedly washing your hands.\n\nPeople with OCD usually are aware that the condition is causing their behavior and accept that they need professional help to treat it. People with OCPD usually have little, if any, self-awareness of their behaviors.\n\nWho does obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) affect?\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder usually begins in your late teens or early 20s. It’s more common in adults whose highest education level is high school graduation or less.\n\nOCPD is also more likely to affect people with the following mental health conditions:\n\nAnxiety disorders (24%), such as panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nMood disorders (24%), such as bipolar disorder.\n\nMild to moderate substance use disorders (12% to 25%).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow common is OCPD?\n\nStudies suggest that OCPD is the most common personality disorder in the general population in the United States. It affects 3% to 8% of adults.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of OCPD?\n\nThe main sign of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a pervasive preoccupation (obsession) with order, perfectionism, control and specific ways of doing things. These behaviors make it difficult to complete tasks and cause issues with relationships.\n\nSymptoms of OCPD usually begin by early adulthood.\n\nA person with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) may:\n\nBe preoccupied with and insist on details, rules, lists, order and organization.\n\nHave perfectionism that interferes with completing tasks.\n\nHave excessive devotion to work and productivity. This results in neglecting hobbies and spending less time with loved ones.\n\nHave excessive doubt and indecisiveness.\n\nUse extreme caution to avoid what they perceive to be failure.\n\nBe rigid and stubborn in their beliefs and ways of doing things.\n\nBe unwilling to compromise.\n\nBe unwilling to throw out broken or worthless objects, even if they have no sentimental value.\n\nHave difficulty working with others or delegating tasks unless they agree to do things exactly as the person wants.\n\nFrequently become overly fixated on a single idea, task or belief.\n\nPerceive everything as “black or white” (dichotomous thinking).\n\nHave difficulty coping with criticism.\n\nOver-focus on flaws in other people.\n\nAt a glance, people with OCPD usually appear confident, organized and high-achieving. Their exacting standards may even benefit them in certain jobs. However, their inability to compromise or change their behaviors usually negatively affects their relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes obsessive-compulsive personality disorder?\n\nPersonality disorders, including obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, are among the least understood mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers are still trying to figure out the exact cause of them, but they think personality disorders develop due to several factors, including:\n\nGenetics: Scientists have identified a malfunctioning gene that may be a factor in OCPD. Researchers are also exploring genetic links to aggression, anxiety and fear, which are traits that can play a role in personality disorders. People are also more likely to have OCPD if they have biological family members with personality disorders, anxiety or depression.\n\nChildhood trauma: One study revealed a link between childhood traumas, such as child abuse, and the development of personality disorders.\n\nHow is OCPD diagnosed?\n\nOCPD can be difficult to diagnose, as most people with a personality disorder don’t think there’s a problem with their behavior or way of thinking.\n\nWhen they do seek help, it’s often because of anxiety or depression due to the problems created by their personality disorder, such as losing their job or relationships, not the disorder itself.\n\nWhen a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, suspects someone might have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, they often ask broad, general questions that won’t create a hostile, defensive environment. They ask questions that shed light on:\n\nRelationships.\n\nWork history.\n\nReality testing.\n\nImpulse control.\n\nBecause a person suspected of having OCPD may lack insight into their behaviors, mental health professionals often work with the person’s family and friends to collect more information about their behaviors and history.\n\nMental health providers base a diagnosis of OCPD on the criteria for the condition in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\nFor a diagnosis of OCPD, the person must have a persistent pattern of preoccupation with:\n\nOrder.\n\nPerfectionism.\n\nControl of themselves, others and situations.\n\nThis pattern is portrayed by four or more of the behaviors listed in the symptoms section.\n\nHow is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder treated?\n\nIn most cases, people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) don’t believe their behaviors are problematic. However, they might seek help if another issue causes them distress.\n\nPsychotherapy (talk therapy) is usually the treatment of choice for personality disorders. The goal of treatment is to help the person uncover the motivations and fears associated with their thoughts and behavior. In addition, they can learn to relate to others more positively.\n\nTwo specific types of psychotherapy that can help people with OCPD include:\n\nPsychodynamic therapy: This type of therapy focuses on the psychological roots of emotional suffering. Through self-reflection and self-examination, the person undergoing therapy looks into problematic relationships and behavior patterns in their life to better understand themselves and change how they relate to other people and their environment.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This is a structured, goal-oriented type of therapy. A therapist or psychologist helps them take a close look at their thoughts and emotions. They’ll come to understand how their thoughts affect their actions. Through CBT, someone with OCPD can unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to adopt healthier thinking patterns and habits.\n\nWhile there’s currently no medication that can treat personality disorders, there’s medication for depression and anxiety, which people with OCPD may also have. Treating these conditions can make it easier to treat OCPD."
