        "text": "Meet Anthony Ng, Our New Program Officer\n\nAnthony Ng (he/they) is a long-time advocate for immigrant rights stemming from his lived experience as one of 800,000 people eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. His background in community organizing and dedication to social justice brought him to the Weingart Foundation as a participant of the first cohort of the John W. Mack Movement Building Fellows, a Weingart program that strengthens racial justice leaders and the movement building infrastructure in our region.\n\nWe are excited to see Anthony continue this work in social justice as our new program officer for special projects and communication, where he focuses on our areas of special interest including immigrant/refugee integration and rights, housing justice, and strengthening nonprofit effectiveness.\n\nLearn more about Anthony Ng, in this video interview with Program Director Vera de Vera.\n\nApril 20, 2022 (Los Angeles, CA) — The Weingart Foundation, a private grantmaking foundation that partners with communities across Southern California to advance racial justice, welcomes Katie Nguyen Kalvoda, founder and C.E.O. of G3 Ventures; Michael Tubbs, founder of EPIC and Mayors for a Guaranteed Income and former Mayor of Stockton; and Jacqueline Waggoner, President, Solutions Division, Enterprise Community Partners, to the Board of Directors.\n\n“The Board is delighted to welcome these new members, all of whom have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to racial justice,” said Aileen Adams, Chair of the Weingart Foundation Board. “These talented and committed leaders will add valuable expertise, powerful lived experiences, and a deep understanding of the communities we serve. We look forward to working with them.”\n\n“As changemakers and visionary leaders, our new Board members will add tremendous insight to the Weingart Foundation Board,” said Miguel A. Santana, President and C.E.O. of the Weingart Foundation. “Individually, they each have a track record of advancing racial justice. Their innovative leadership on impact investing, alleviating poverty, and creating affordable housing solutions will advance the Foundation’s work.”\n\nKatie Nguyen Kalvoda is the founder and C.E.O. of G3 Ventures, a social enterprise specializing in innovative philanthropy, impact investments, and community advocacy. She is a Board member of the Sisters of St. Joseph Healthcare Foundation and an appointed member of the California Health Facilities Financing Authority. Kalvoda, who lives in Orange County, is a long-time advocate for progressive values in the A.A.P.I. community and serves on the boards of A.A.P.I. Victory Fund and A.A.P.I. Victory Alliance.\n\nMichael Tubbs is the founder of EPIC (End Poverty in California), the founder of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, and Special Advisor to California Governor Gavin Newsom for Economic Mobility. In 2016, he was elected Mayor of Stockton at 26 years old. He was the city’s first African American mayor, and the youngest mayor of any major city in American history. He piloted the first mayor-led guaranteed income pilot in the country.\n\nJacqueline Waggoner is President, Solutions Division, at Enterprise Community Partners, one of the nation’s largest affordable housing nonprofits. From her work on the ground in hundreds of communities nationwide, to advocating for affordable housing at the highest levels of government, Waggoner leads the company’s programmatic, policy and advisory work in alignment with its strategic priorities: increasing the housing supply, advancing racial equity, and building upward mobility and resilience. She has served on a number of public, nonprofit and coalition Boards, including the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority Commission (chair) and its Ad Hoc Committee on Black People Experiencing Homelessness (chair).\n\nABOUT THE WEINGART FOUNDATION\n\nThe Weingart Foundation is a private, nonprofit grantmaking foundation that partners with communities across Southern California to advance racial, social, and economic justice for all. Our vision is a dynamic and effective social change sector that is creating equitable systems and structures needed to achieve justice. Founded in 1951, the Foundation has to date granted over $1 billion to organizations, strengthening their efforts in human services, housing, health, education, and community power building. In addition, the Foundation builds networks and collaboratives with philanthropic, public sector, and community leaders to advance equity and justice together.\n\nMarch 31, 2022 (Los Angeles, CA) — The Weingart Foundation, a private grantmaking foundation, awards 62 grants and one program-related investment, all totaling over $14 million to organizations addressing systemic racism, and providing critical services to communities in need. The Foundation also prioritizes three areas of special interest: housing justice, immigrant and refugee rights and integration, and nonprofit capacity building, by partnering with organizations working in these spaces. The majority of this round of funding, 79 percent, provides unrestricted operating support to 51 non-profit partners and power-building coalitions working on advancing racial justice in Southern California. Of these, 85% are BIPOC-led organizations, one-third of which are Black-led.\n\n“We are proud of the work of our community partners to end systemic racism and to respond to the disparities that it produces,” said Miguel A. Santana, President and CEO, the Weingart Foundation. “The Foundation stands with our partners by investing in their leadership and organizational resilience. We know that when they thrive, our communities thrive. Together, we can advance racial justice.”\n\nForty percent of the nonprofits receiving funding are first-time partners, consistent with the Foundation’s equitable approach of working in communities to learn about and identify non-profits leading impactful work. For example, in South Los Angeles, the foundation awarded grants to three new partners that are Black-led organizations focused on supporting at-risk or systems-involved youth. The Foundation also welcomes three new partners focused on supporting the BIPOC LGBTQIA+ community with leadership development, self-empowerment, and social services.\n\n“LGBTQAI+ youth need safe spaces that celebrate and affirm who they are. With the support from the foundation, ProjectQ will be able to further its mission of supporting LGBTQA+ youth facing homelessness through workshops, job opportunities, and services that build confidence and self-empowerment,” said Madin Lopez, Founder and Executive Director, ProjectQ, a new Weingart Foundation partner.\n\nIn step with the Foundation’s focus on supporting ecosystems that support civic engagement and power building in communities of color, this round of funding continues investments to emerging organizations in Orange County and the Inland Empire, while also including new partners. These nonprofits are part of local coalitions such as the Black Equity Initiative, the Inland Empire Redistricting Coalition, the Orange County Opportunity Initiative, the People’s Redistricting Alliance, and the American Network of Services for Afghan Refugees. These coalitions are working to empower BIPOC youth, voters, and community members to help shape the future of their communities.\n\nThe Foundation also approved a program-related investment (below market rate loan) to A Community of Friends for $750,000 for up to six years in support of their innovative approach to build supportive housing faster and more cost-effectively for people who are unhoused with mental illnesses.\n\n“On behalf of the Weingart Board, we are honored to partner with such effective grassroots organizations working so hard to meet essential needs in their communities. We are also proud of our partnerships with coalitions building power in traditionally disenfranchised neighborhoods,” said Aileen Adams, the Weingart Foundation Board Chair. “Our partners’ dedication to providing critical services–and to structural change–inspires us every day.”\n\nABOUT THE WEINGART FOUNDATION\n\nThe Weingart Foundation is a private, nonprofit grantmaking foundation that partners with communities across Southern California to advance racial, social, and economic justice for all.

In addition, the Foundation builds networks and collaboratives with philanthropic, public sector, and community leaders to advance equity and justice together.\n\nWe want to celebrate the relationships we are deepening with partners that are using bold ideas and bringing positive change in their communities.\n\nWith our partners, we are advancing in three areas that are important to us.\n\nWe support nonprofit organizations filling the gaps of inequity created by unjust systems;\n\nWe strengthen collaboratives and organizations working together to increase the positive impact they can have;\n\nAnd we advance big ideas that bring about long term solutions to our region’s toughest challenges.\n\nWhen it comes to big ideas, we continue to champion bold solutions to homelessness including through our work on The Committee for Greater LA, a group of civic leaders with the shared vision of using the pandemic recovery as an opportunity to advance a more equitable Los Angeles. The Committee recently released research exploring attitudes Angelenos have on the issues of homelessness. Read about what voters are saying in this L.A. Times article and watch the webinar where The Committee shared the findings. Voters have not given up on finding a solution to homelessness in Los Angeles and neither have we.\n\nWhile we do a lot of work in the core Los Angeles region, our work and partnerships extend throughout Southern California. In this video, I highlight some of the work our new partners are leading. You’ll also meet:\n\nJulissa Peña, Executive Director of the Santa Barbara County Immigrant Legal Defense Center\n\nTorie Weinston-Serdan P.h.D., Chief Visionary Officer at Youth Mentoring Action Network\n\nNorberto Santana Jr. Editor-in-Chief, Voice of O.C., and\n\nYongsuk “Jesse” Lee, Co-Founder and Executive Director at Street Company.\n\nWe look forward to working with these partners and many others as we advance social, racial, and economic equity together."
