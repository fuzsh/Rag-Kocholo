        "text": "USDA press releases must adhere to the Associated Press Stylebook except where this document points to exceptions.\n\nA press release is written to encourage media to report on a newsworthy USDA policy, action, or announcement. The department and our agencies’ public affairs directors and OC coordinators are responsible for determining whether a press release is an appropriate form of outreach.\n\nGuidance for writing press releases\n\nUse strong active verbs. Use plain language. In general, a news release shouldn't be longer than one page and no more than two pages. Keep it brief.\n\nAccording to Cornell University, research suggests the ideal sentence length is 15 to 20 words, with 85 percent of the words one or two syllables long.\n\nDon't resort to run-on sentences; instead, use punctuation. Always remember your audience are media professionals. Use plain language, since releases may be used verbatim in media outlets. Always read what you write and have a lay coworker read what you write. If they don’t understand it, chances are your audience won’t either.\n\nNote: the media has significantly changed over the past fifteen years. Today, reporters are likely to be generalists without a strong agricultural or food policy background.\n\nWith rare exception, quotes should be 25 – 50 word maximum.\n\nThe purpose of the quote is to encourage the reporter to include the most important talking point using USDA’s exact words.\n\nReporter’s stories are bound by the newspaper/magazine/broadcast editors’ word/time limits. If you provide too much, you encourage the reporter to paraphrase or pick and choose what part of the quote to include in the story.\n\nThe reporter can be provided a press-background brief to educate them on the details of the program or policy announcement, it doesn’t need to be in the quote.\n\nQuotes from outside principals, partners, or organizations are generally not used unless approved by the deputy director of communications for press operations. Key partnerships can be referenced in the release. Other federal agency quotes are acceptable with approval of the press secretary or their designee.\n\nJargon\n\nDon't use jargon. If you absolutely must use a jargon word, explain it.\n\nWeb addresses/Internet\n\nSay: \"More information is at www.usda.gov.\" There is no need to use a colon before at. If an Internet address falls at the end of a sentence, use a period. Do not capitalize the \"e\" in email. Do not say “click here.”\n\nEnding the Release\n\nEnd news releases with three # symbols, centered, two lines below the last line of the release.\n\nPlace this short EEO statement two lines below the three # symbols: “USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.”\n\nA short note after the text of a news release can be used to provide additional information to the media, such as the availability of photographs, publications or sound bites. Any \"Note to Reporters,\" if needed, should be single-spaced, not exceed 1/3 of a page in length, and start two lines below the #.\n\nFollowing are some specifics to keep in mind when preparing materials. These include some USDA specific directions for formatting the press release.\n\nAcronyms\n\nSpell out U.S. Department of Agriculture and names of agencies and programs in the first reference. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference, do not use it. Often a generic word such as the agency or the program is more appropriate and less jarring to the reader. At other times, you may need to repeat the full name for clarity.\n\n*Note: AP doesn't follow a term with an abbreviation in parentheses, though a well-known abbreviation may be used in follow-ups.\n\nAttribution\n\nUse said. It is a good, clean, four-letter word. Do not use: stated, noted, pointed out, commented, explained, or any other similar word. Use said.\n\nIn the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”\n\nSecond reference and beyond: “Secretary Vilsack”\n\nConjunctions\n\nFollow AP style. When a conjunction such as and, but or for links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma before the conjunction in most cases: “She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching the house.”\n\nCommas in a series\n\nUse commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. He would nominate Tom, Dick, Harry or Jeannette.\n\nPress release contact information\n\nWhen the Secretary of Agriculture or subcabinet officials are quoted, list the Office of Communications at press@usda.gov (the general OC email address) as the first contact with the appropriate agency contact listed second. Do not put a comma between names and phone numbers.\n\nDatelines should be bold, and include city, month (use AP abbreviation), day and year. Datelines on stories should contain the place name, followed in most cases by the name of the state, country or territory where the city is located. AP allows for large cities to stand alone without a state name. See the AP stylebook for a complete list of exempted cities.\n\nIf an announcement is made by a USDA official when he or she is away from Washington, use the city where the official is that day as the dateline.\n\nCapitalize the names of months in all uses.\n\nExample\n\nUSE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7, 2023—\n\nDO NOT USE: (Washington, D.C., January 7, 2023)\n\nFormats\n\nSingle space news releases and other press materials. Justify them left, with 1-inch margins and half-inch indents. Skip one line between paragraphs. Use only Times New Roman 12-point typeface. Use MSWord software, Drupal or another USDA Chief Information Officer- approved content management system.\n\nHeadlines\n\nCenter headlines and boldface them. Do not use all caps. Capitalize the first letter in words except for conjunctions (but), prepositions (of) and articles (a). Follow the same rules for subheads, and put subheads in italics centered below the headline. Headlines and subheads are active tense.\n\nWith headlines that include the Secretary of Agriculture, this is the proper form: “Secretary Vilsack announces…”\n\nDo not use the principal’s first name in the headline.\n\nStakeholders\n\nDon't use the word stakeholders. Instead, describe who you mean, such as farmers, ranchers, commodities groups, members of Congress, private sector partners, public sector partners, or federal agencies.\n\nAP Styleguide Exceptions\n\nIn the first reference to the Secretary: “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack”\n\nSecretary quote should be followed by: “said Secretary Vilsack.”\n\nPurpose\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognizes the need for a skilled, workforce that can provide equitable and high-quality service in all it does. Every USDA employee should have the opportunity to thrive in an inclusive environment that gives them a sense of belonging and develops them so they can make their unique contributions to USDA’s mission. This includes employing a workforce that represents the diversity of people served by USDA and supporting capabilities within every employee to provide excellent customer service to all, especially to individuals who have been unable to benefit from USDA programs and opportunities to improve their lives.\n\nThe words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. As we build and provide services throughout USDA, we want to ensure the services are accessible and welcoming to all customers, employees, and stakeholders. Gender inclusive language or terms are those that are gender neutral and gender equitable. Such inclusive language helps us be more accurate and build trust with each other and our customers.\n\nThis Gender Inclusive Communications Guidebook (guidebook) serves as a resource of commonly used and preferred inclusive language for all internal and external USDA communication. Upon publication, this guidebook should be used as the primary guidance document for the standardization and use of gender inclusive language and terminology for USDA internal and external communications going forward.\n\nThis guidebook supplements the USDA Style Guide and the following Departmental Directives:\n\nDR1410-001, Publications Review and Clearance Policy (01/14/21)\n\nDR1420-002, Printing Policy (09/08/16)\n\nDR1430-002, Use of Logos/Marks at the United States Department of Agriculture (01/08/2013)\n\nDR1440-002, Press Operations (09/07/16)\n\nDR1480-001, Photography Policy (02/07/03)\n\nDR1490-002, Creative, Media and Broadcast Policy (08/04/11)\n\nDR1495-001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (05/23/11)\n\nDR1496-001, Digital Strategy Governance (11/21/12)\n\nDR1497-001, Approval of Communications/Information Products and Services (10/29/14)\n\nThis guidebook serves as a reference document and should be used in conjunction with training and technical assistance [e.g. assistance from employee resource groups and additional guidance documents] provided by USDA. This guidebook is a living document and will be periodically updated as USDA adopts more updated language, or as changes occur to Departmental directives, clearance processes, and other guidance documents and materials.\n\nBackground\n\nIn June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), that employment discrimination based on transgender status or sexual orientation constitutes prohibited discrimination based on sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Accordingly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Bostock decision is a demonstration of the changing views at federal and state levels toward strengthening and improving the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex (LGBTQI+) or other diverse gender identities represented by “plus,” including Two-Spirit, LGBTQI+ people in the areas of employment, health, education, housing and other fields.\n\nU.S. demographic trends demonstrate a shifting perception of gender identity and expression. For instance, research data indicates that about 1 in 5 U.S. adults know someone who goes by a gender-neutral pronoun. By utilizing inclusive language practices, we build upon an organizational culture of respect and belonging for those in the LGBTQI+) community, but also for anyone who in some way challenges the traditional model of gender identity and expression. This is particularly important when data demonstrates that LGBTQI+ Americans face elevated levels of discrimination and mistreatment in education, employment, housing, health care, in places of public accommodations, or from law enforcement. In particular, transgender Americans also experience higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts that are four times and six times higher than the entire U.S. population.\n\nUSDA is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where individuals are respected, trusted, valued, and work together collaboratively to achieve Departmental goals. This also means promoting an equitable environment that embraces the differences of not just its employees, but also of customers and stakeholders. USDA promotes a culture that uses inclusive language in written and oral forms of communication to internal and external audiences. This entails adjusting communications to use terms that do not refer to gender, rather than defaulting to gender-specific terms such as he, she, her and his without awareness of an individual’s preferences. Once an individual makes their preferences known, this should be respected in further interactions. In practice, this allows the individual an opportunity to share how they would like to be identified. For example, sharing one’s pronouns should be a voluntary activity, but using a person’s pronouns is a sign of respect. USDA is committed to the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and equal opportunity for employees and those we serve. This guidebook provides practical direction to achieve this standard the Department.\n\nUSDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are encouraged to engage with employees, customers, and stakeholders by sharing important USDA policies, actions, or announcements. Employees throughout the Department regularly communicate to the public in a multitude of ways and for several purposes. Communications may come from Mission Area or agency Public Affairs Directors; partnership and public engagement liaisons; External Affairs officials, and other teams and program offices across the Department., liaisons in Office of Partnerships & Public Engagement, External Affairs, Internal Government Affairs, Office of Communications (OC) and many others throughout the Department.\n\nVideos and Press Media refers to visual and written communication. Within this guidance, press material refers to all forms of official USDA communication typically in the forms of press releases, videos from USDA senior leadership and communication memos. When communicating with employees, customers and stakeholders, we must ensure that the messages engage a wide range of audience members when possible.\n\nIncorporating inclusive language and genders in USDA press releases, blogs, videos, and speeches must be respectfully considered. For example, when speaking of federal wildland firefighters, one should refer to them as “brave wildland firefighters,” instead of “brave men and women.” Likewise, visuals for press materials should not only represent cisgender people, but also reflect same sex couples and genders that are not normally associated with a particular program or circumstance.\n\nFor the purpose of this guidance, multimedia refers to visual aids and graphics such as pictures, fact sheets, infographics, and other types of visual outreach material. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices are permitted to establish a presence online to share content and engage with stakeholders through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and YouTube. Guidance for the use and clearance of information to be used on these media types can be found in the USDA Style Guide and the Departmental Directives listed in the Purpose section at the beginning of this document. These Directives also outline the clearance processes for publications, print and video outreach.\n\nWhen developing materials, we must be purposeful creating and sourcing images of diverse people in a wide range of roles. In this way, the images we use should represent multiple voices and perspectives. For example, visuals also reflect same-sex couples or genders that are not normally associated with a particular program. This also means providing alternate (alt) text or alt descriptions to convey the context of images as they appear in printed materials or on online platforms. For platforms that do not offer alt text options, alt text should be included within the post itself. For example: [Image description: alt text]. Keep in mind that when using stock images, it is important to use gender, race, age, or other keywords that have been given in the context of the photo. Do not assume the race or gender of an individual based on the image if that information is not included in the image description. If using images of people who have identified their pronouns, this should also be included in alt text.\n\nThe use of emojis, pictograms, or graphic designs, are often used in text and written messages to convey additional ideas or emotions. Social media managers should be cautious when using specific emojis to convey additional meanings. When using emojis, practice using non-gendered faces or if a gendered emoji is used, try to include various genders. More commonly, emojis have been used as a visual representation of the LGBTQI+ community through various icons including the use of rainbows, hearts, and multiple colors to represent skin color, to name a few iterations. Emojis are a valuable communication tool, but they can have multiple meanings that are not appropriate for government use.\n\nHashtags are a way to connect social media content to a specific topic, event, theme, or conversation. They also make it easier to discover posts around those specific topics, because hashtags aggregate all social media content with that same hashtag. Social media managers should always search hashtags before using them to make sure the conversation surrounding the hashtag is relevant and appropriate to your messaging. Social media managers should research hashtags carefully to be sure they are not being widely used in conjunction with inappropriate posts. Media managers should be sure that the conversation and the meaning of the hashtag has not changed from the intended purpose.\n\nSocial media managers should be cautious when using acronyms as part of a hashtag, as the acronym on its own can convey various meanings. Social media managers should consider that many social media platforms will index all terms in a post for discovery in search and trends, regardless if a hashtag is present.\n\nPosting Guidelines\n\nThe USDA encourages the use of various multimedia outlets to foster a more open and transparent relationship with our audiences. These audiences include but are not limited to employees, customers, stakeholders, and members of the public. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices use social media to reach audiences quickly and easily, delivering information through a variety of platforms and formats as part of their integrated communication strategy. Because of this relationship, audiences engage with our content by expressing their thoughts, opinions and ideas through comments, reactions, and direct messages on social media. Social media managers should use best judgment when responding to an individual’s comments and direct messages.\n\nWhen posting content, social media managers should adhere to the guidelines listed in the USDA Social Media Style Guide. Additionally, social media managers should use gender-inclusive language. When posting about USDA employees, social media managers should verify the employee’s pronouns.\n\nThe USDA does not agree with or endorse every comment that individuals post on our social media. Hate speech and harassment toward LGBTQI+ and other underrepresented communities is prevalent in online platforms and needs meaningful content moderation.\n\nSocial Media Manager Responsibilities\n\nIn addition to the following guidance, additional social media guidance on governance may be found in DR 1495-001, New Media Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities. It is the social media manager’s responsibility to assess if a comment is harmful or makes a threat toward an individual or group of people. The social media manager is responsible for communicating any potential and legitimate threat to their Agency. Social media managers should take substantive and meaningful action to prioritize the safety of USDA employees, our customers, underrepresented community members and protected classes. If a social media manager encounters an inappropriate comment or a direct message, such as a negative opinion about LGBQTI+ individuals, then the social media manager may take the following actions:\n\nIf the comment does not warrant a response and is not harmful, then social media managers may ignore the comment. For the benefit of a robust and constructive conversation, USDA will allow comments that relate to the topic discussed within the corresponding post. USDA expects users to show respect, civility, and consideration to all posts and other users.\n\nIf the comment includes false information about the USDA and the social media manager feels that clarification of accurate information is important for the public, then the social media manager may respond to the comment.\n\nSocial media managers should keep in mind the following when responding to comments:\n\nBe polite when responding;\n\nCorrect the message, rather than the individuals who spread it;\n\nUse facts and data when pointing out generalizations and inaccuracies; and\n\nAim to show a different perspective and share positive stories;\n\nIf the comment includes the following content, social managers may hide the comment:\n\nHate speech, including targeted slurs, intended to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected group. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals;\n\nProfanity, obscenity or vulgarity;\n\nNudity in profile pictures; such as material that contains sexual content, which is overly graphic, disturbing, obscene, or offensive or material that would otherwise violate the law if published;\n\nDefamation to a person or people, such as comments that are discriminatory, racist, offensive, obscene, inflammatory, unlawful or otherwise objectionable statements, language or content;\n\nName-calling and/or personal attacks;\n\nComments whose main purpose are to sell a product;\n\nComments that infringe on copyrights;\n\nSpam comments, such as the same comment posted repeatedly on a profile; and\n\nAdvertisements for inappropriate websites or social media accounts;\n\nIf an individual repeatedly makes inappropriate comments that warrant hiding, then social media managers can block the user from the social media page. In these circumstances, it might be best to mute the account that is provoking the harm, and then take actions to block and report the user. Much the same, if the social media manager sees that another user is being attacked, then it is a best practice to report the profile to the appropriate social media platform.\n\nSocial media managers are encouraged to confer with subject matter experts, such as LGBTQI+ Special Emphasis Program Managers (SEPMs), Out and Equal, Equality USDA, and their respective Civil Rights Offices for additional guidance.\n\nGeneral USDA Examples\n\n(a) For those who don’t fall neatly into either category, references to the binary male and female groupings can be alienating. According to the United Nations’ guidelines on gender-inclusive language, “Using gender-inclusive language means speaking and writing in a way that does not discriminate against a particular sex, social gender or gender identity, and does not perpetuate gender stereotypes. Given the key role of language in shaping cultural and social attitudes, using gender-inclusive language is a powerful way to promote gender equality and eradicate gender bias.”\n\n(b) In an effort to eliminate the possibility of misgendering correspondence recipients, it is suggested that the following nouns and pronouns be used through the body of any USDA correspondence, guidance and regulations. Please note that this section is not an exhaustive list of examples that may occur at USDA. It is encouraged that each Agency create their own internal guidebook or implementation plan for use.\n\nThey/them instead of he/she;\n\nSpouse or partner instead of husband/wife to spouse;\n\nFolks or everybody instead of guys or ladies/gentleman;\n\nHumankind instead of mankind;\n\nPeople instead of men or women;\n\nParent instead of mother or father;\n\nSibling instead of brother/sister;\n\nChild instead of son or daughter;\n\nMembers of Congress instead of Congressmen;\n\nCouncilperson instead of Councilman/Councilwoman;\n\nFirst-year student instead of freshman;\n\nChair or Chairperson instead of Chairman;\n\nArtificial or synthetic instead of man-made;\n\nWorkforce instead of manpower; and\n\nFirefighters instead of firemen.\n\n(c) Although well-meaning, the use of particular terms may act in completely altering and discrediting a particular group of people or culture. For example, in some communities, the use of the term “Latinx” in place of Latino or Latina is intended to promote gender language inclusivity. However, in the Spanish language, masculine and feminine nouns are engrained in the language itself and in an attempt to make terms gender inclusive, one may essentially alter the meaning of the language. For these reasons, it is important to know the audience to which you are directing your message.\n\nSummary\n\nThis guidebook is a living document under the authority of the Office of Communications with support from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights and the Office of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. The guidebook will be continually updated as USDA adopts more updated language or changes occur to Departmental Directives, policies, procedures, clearance processes, or other guidance direction.\n\nThe terms and definitions included in this section are from the USDA Departmental Directives Definitions Glossary; the Department of Labor’s DOL Policies on Gender Identity: Rights and Responsibilities; the Human Rights Campaign Glossary of Terms; Executive Order 13985, Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce; the University of Missouri’s Language of Identity inclusive terminology guide; the American Psychological Association’s Inclusive Language Guidelines; or the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) Inclusive Language Guide.\n\nThis appendix provides definitions of commonly used terms related to gender inclusion and other references used in this guidebook.
