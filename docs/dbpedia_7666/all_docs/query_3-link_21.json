Chapter Preface Yes: Racial Profiling Is a Problem How the Hunt for Bin Laden Made US Muslims and Immigrants Threats Seth Freed Wessler\n\n18 20\n\nThe war on terror launched after 9/11/01 has erected a security framework in the United States that makes racial profiling, detainment, and deportation common for Arabs and Muslims. Much of the so-called antiterrorism activities being conducted by local police and federal authorities is fueled by racial profiling rather than real criminal behavior on the part of suspects.\n\nRacial Profiling Is Being Used in Immigration Checks Aura Bogado\n\n26\n\nArizona’s anti-immigration laws and policies, especially SB 1070, are being used to racially profile and harass Latinos and those who look Latino. These laws have resulted not only in the arrest of illegal immigrants but in the harassment of legal, law-abiding citizens.\n\nNo: Racial Profiling Is Not a Problem Racial Profiling Is a Rational Response to Information Walter E. Williams\n\n32\n\nRacial profiling to assess the likelihood of criminality is based on factual criminal data just as racial profiling to assess medical risk is based on medical data.\n\nRacial Disparities in Police Activity Do Not Indicate Racial Profiling Heather Mac Donald\n\n35\n\nThe US Justice Department’s investigations of racial profiling in city police departments ignore racial crime rates and harm minority communities. Such federal oversight drains the limited resources of local police departments and hampers their ability to fight crime.\n\nProfiling on Steroids John F. McManus\n\n46\n\nWhereas Arizona’s policing law, known as SB 1070, does not actually constitute racial profiling, the legally accepted practice of affirmative action is indeed a more obvious form of racial profiling, forcing employers to use race in their hiring practices.\n\nChapter 2: Should Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror? Overview: Perceptions of Racial Profiling by Muslim Americans Pew Research Center\n\n50\n\nAmong Muslim Americans, a majority says they are singled out by the US government’s antiterrorism policies and a sizeable minority reports mistreatment or discrimination. These perceptions are more pronounced among young Muslim Americans born in the United States, as opposed to those born in foreign countries.\n\nYes: Arab Muslims Should Be Profiled in the War on Terror Airport Security: Let’s Profile Muslims Asra Q. Nomani\n\n55\n\nRacial profiling based on race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion is based on a rational threat assessment due to the high number of Muslim plots against airliners and airports. As such, we have to choose pragmatism over political correctness and include racial profiling as one element in America’s fight against terrorism.\n\nConcerns About Racial Profiling Should Not Inhibit Terrorist Surveillance Richard A. Epstein Government responsibility for national security justifies surveillance and the collection of information that is guided by racial profiling, where appropriate.\n\n61\n\nNo: Arab Muslims Should Not Be Profiled in the War on Terror Spooked by the Underwear Bomber: Instead of Body Scanners and Ethnic Profiling We Need Patience and Resilience to Tackle Terrorism Mehdi Hasan\n\n68\n\nAttempts to obtain absolute security from terrorism through the use of body scanners, racial profiling, and military intervention are misguided and should be resisted.\n\nRacial Profiling Is Ineffective in Catching Terrorists Elahe Izadi\n\n72\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 illustrates the uselessness of using racial and religious profiling to try to catch terrorist suspects.\n\nRacial Profiling in the War on Terror Leads to Dangerous Practices Center for Human Rights and Global Justice\n\n76\n\nThe focus on Muslims in counterterrorism operations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with permissive Department of Justice guidelines, has lead to the unjust targeting and entrapment of Muslims based solely on their race and religious affiliations.\n\nChapter 3: What Are the Causes and Consequences of Racial Profiling? Chapter Preface Trayvon Martin: Confronting the Problem of Enduring Racism Doug Bandow\n\n90 92\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin illustrates the ongoing problem of racial prejudice in the United States even though much progress has occurred since the days of slavery.\n\nA Trial in Black and White Kevin Alexander Gray\n\n99\n\nThe trial and acquittal of George Zimmerman illustrates the pervasive racism against African Americans in the criminal justice system and the media, which is reminiscent of slavery or the treatment of blacks during the Jim Crow era.\n\nJustice for the System: There Is No Institutional Racism in Our Courts and Police Stations Ian Tuttle\n\n110\n\nAfrican Americans are arrested, convicted, and incarcerated for crimes at a higher rate than white Americans not because of racial profiling or discrimination but because they commit a higher share of crimes than white people.\n\nRacial Profiling in America Is Part of Systemic Racism Gary Younge\n\n118\n\nAfrican American men are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, and executed because of a system of racism that is embedded in American society.\n\nWe Are All Juan Williams: Associating Minorities with Crime Is Irrational, Unjust, and Completely Normal Shankar Vedantam\n\n122\n\nIt is normal brain functioning to confuse correlation with causation and thus to associate all unusual events, such as terrorist attacks, with a particular minority group, such as Muslims. But that does not absolve people from challenging these illogical assumptions.\n\nRacial Profiling May Increase Crime Among Those Not Profiled Eric Horowitz Recent research suggests that the racial profiling of minority groups in stop-and-frisk policies may increase the feeling of impunity among whites, leading them to commit crimes they otherwise would not commit.\n\n127\n\nChapter 4: What Should Be Done About Racial Profiling? Chapter Preface Racism Against Young African American Men Needs to Be Addressed Barack Obama\n\n131 133\n\nA number of steps should be taken—from retraining police officers to revisiting the use of Stand Your Ground laws in various states and localities—to ensure that young African American men are not being unfairly racially profiled for criminal activity.\n\nFacing Facts About Race Victor Davis Hanson\n\n140\n\nRacial profiling of young African American men does not contribute to higher crime rates, nor do such factors as Stand Your Ground statutes or weak gun-control laws. Such violence is due to an urban culture that fosters a disproportionate amount of crime by African American youths.\n\nThere Is a Need for the End Racial Profiling Act Benjamin L. Cardin\n\n147\n\nThe so-called End Racial Profiling Act is needed to prohibit racial profiling, mandate training of police on racial profiling issues, and allow federal oversight of law enforcement on this matter.\n\nThere Is No Need for the End Racial Profiling Act Roger Clegg\n\n151\n\nAlthough racial profiling should generally not be allowed, it does not make sense for the legislature to prohibit racial considerations in all areas of law enforcement. Thus, the so-called End Racial Profiling Act is bad policy and should not be adopted.\n\nProposed Prohibitions on Racial Profiling Will Hinder Law Enforcement Linda Chavez\n\n161\n\nLegal restrictions on racial profiling need to be carefully constructed and limited to race and ethnicity, but with exceptions for national security operations. Thus, new guidelines being considered by the US Department of Justice that expand the definition of racial profiling and increase the categories protected beyond race and ethnicity should be opposed.\n\nOrganizations to Contact Bibliography Index\n\n164 168 173\n\nForeword\n\nB\n\ny definition, controversies are “discussions of questions in which opposing opinions clash” (Webster’s Twentieth Century Dictionary Unabridged). Few would deny that controversies are a pervasive part of the human condition and exist on virtually every level of human enterprise. Controversies transpire between individuals and among groups, within nations and between nations. Controversies supply the grist necessary for progress by providing challenges and challengers to the status quo. They also create atmospheres where strife and warfare can flourish. A world without controversies would be a peaceful world; but it also would be, by and large, static and prosaic.\n\nThe Series’ Purpose The purpose of the Current Controversies series is to explore many of the social, political, and economic controversies dominating the national and international scenes today. Titles selected for inclusion in the series are highly focused and specific. For example, from the larger category of criminal justice, Current Controversies deals with specific topics such as police brutality, gun control, white collar crime, and others. The debates in Current Controversies also are presented in a useful, timeless fashion. Articles and book excerpts included in each title are selected if they contribute valuable, long-range ideas to the overall debate. And wherever possible, current information is enhanced with historical documents and other relevant materials. Thus, while individual titles are current in focus, every effort is made to ensure that they will not become quickly outdated. Books in the Current Controversies series will remain important resources for librarians, teachers, and students for many years. 11\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nIn addition to keeping the titles focused and specific, great care is taken in the editorial format of each book in the series. Book introductions and chapter prefaces are offered to provide background material for readers. Chapters are organized around several key questions that are answered with diverse opinions representing all points on the political spectrum. Materials in each chapter include opinions in which authors clearly disagree as well as alternative opinions in which authors may agree on a broader issue but disagree on the possible solutions. In this way, the content of each volume in Current Controversies mirrors the mosaic of opinions encountered in society. Readers will quickly realize that there are many viable answers to these complex issues. By questioning each author’s conclusions, students and casual readers can begin to develop the critical thinking skills so important to evaluating opinionated material. Current Controversies is also ideal for controlled research. Each anthology in the series is composed of primary sources taken from a wide gamut of informational categories including periodicals, newspapers, books, US and foreign government documents, and the publications of private and public organizations. Readers will find factual support for reports, debates, and research papers covering all areas of important issues. In addition, an annotated table of contents, an index, a book and periodical bibliography, and a list of organizations to contact are included in each book to expedite further research. Perhaps more than ever before in history, people are confronted with diverse and contradictory information. During the Persian Gulf War, for example, the public was not only treated to minute-to-minute coverage of the war, it was also inundated with critiques of the coverage and countless analyses of the factors motivating US involvement. Being able to sort through the plethora of opinions accompanying today’s major issues, and to draw one’s own conclusions, can be a 12\n\nForeword\n\ncomplicated and frustrating struggle. It is the editors’ hope that Current Controversies will help readers with this struggle.\n\n13\n\nIntroduction “Racial profiling involves targeting an entire group of people for suspicion based on the group’s race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin.”\n\nI\n\nn the debate about racial profiling, one of the key starting points for discussion is the definition of racial profiling. The National Institute of Justice defines it this way: Racial profiling by law enforcement is commonly defined as a practice that targets people for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Creating a profile about the kinds of people who commit certain types of crimes may lead officers to generalize about a particular group and act according to the generalization rather than specific behavior.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) notes the difference between racial profiling and criminal profiling: “Racial Profiling” refers to the discriminatory practice by law enforcement officials of targeting individuals for suspicion of crime based on the individual’s race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Criminal profiling, generally, as practiced by police, is the reliance on a group of characteristics they believe to be associated with crime.\n\nThe ACLU notes that criminal profiling is a legitimate practice of law enforcement: “Racial profiling does not refer to the act of a law enforcement agent pursuing a suspect in which the specific description of the suspect includes race or ethnicity in combination with other identifying factors.” Thus, racial profiling involves targeting an entire group of people for suspicion based on the group’s race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. 14\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne concern about racial profiling in law enforcement is that it is ineffective. For example, imagine the police department of a particular American city assumed drug dealers would be black males in their teens and twenties. This might lead to law enforcement behavior that would single out young, black males for traffic stops, frisks, and surveillance in a manner that was both under- and over-inclusive: drug dealers could be older white males or young Hispanic females— among others—so the policy would be “under-inclusive,” passing over legitimate suspects because of the assumption of racial profiling. Additionally, most young black males are not drug dealers, so the law enforcement strategy would be “overinclusive,” targeting innocent people with suspicion. Furthermore, as the National Institute of Justice notes, “racial profiling is unlikely to be an effective policing strategy as criminals can simply shift their activities outside the profile.” If only young, black males are under suspicion for dealing drugs, then it makes sense to move the drug trade into the hands of young, white females and other demographic groups to avoid detection. Another concern about racial profiling in law enforcement is that it violates civil rights. The ACLU says, “Racial profiling continues to be a prevalent and egregious form of discrimination in the United States. This unjustifiable practice remains a stain on American democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality.” There is a concern that racial profiling unfairly targets minority groups, operating as a bias in law enforcement activities. The Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Critics of racial profiling are concerned that the targets of racial profiling are not given equal protection of the laws. 15\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nEven though there are widespread concerns about racial profiling, not everyone agrees that it is a common practice in the United States. Some argue that law enforcement is unfairly accused of racial profiling when, in fact, they are engaging in legitimate criminal profiling. Additionally, when crime statistics are disproportionally higher for a particular racial or ethnic group, some maintain that targeting this group for enhanced crime surveillance does not constitute egregious racial profiling. Thus, for instance, if young, black males are disproportionately involved in drug dealing, there are those who argue that profiling young, black males in drug law enforcement is one legitimate part of police work on this issue. Thus, even with a consensus on the definition of racial profiling, there is no consensus on whether or not racial profiling constitutes a large problem in the United States or whether action needs to be taken to halt law enforcement practices that profile according to race, ethnicity, religion, and national origin. These debates and others are explored in Current Controversies: Racial Profiling.\n\n16\n\n1\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\n17\n\nChapter Preface\n\nR\n\nacial profiling may or may not be a problem in the United States: the answer depends on how much racial profiling actually exists and one’s perception of the permissible uses of racial profiling in carrying out law enforcement activities. In the United States, surveys of various racial groups show a marked difference in perceptions about police fairness toward racial groups. In addition, a majority of Americans seem to find racial profiling unproblematic when related to national security, such as with air travel or protecting cities and national landmarks. Gallup’s Minority Rights and Relations poll, conducted in July 2013, found that 24 percent of black men under the age of 35 said that the police had treated them unfairly during the past thirty days. Among black males aged 35 to 54, 22 percent said they had been treated unfairly in recent weeks. A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted that same month found that 86 percent of African Americans think that blacks and other minorities do not receive equal treatment as whites in the criminal justice system. In contrast, only 41 percent of whites thought that blacks and other minorities do not receive equal treatment. When asked specifically about their thoughts about racial profiling in airports to stop terrorists, the vast majority of Americans appear to find the practice unproblematic. A USA Today/Gallup poll in January 2010 found that 71 percent of Americans favor the practice of subjecting airline passengers who fit the profile of terrorists—based on their age, ethnicity, or gender—to special, more intensive security checks before boarding US flights. Only 21 percent opposed the practice, with the remainder unsure. Racial profiling in the United States is a contentious issue with respect to counterterrorism activities, law enforcement\n\n18\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\npractices, and immigration enforcement. As the viewpoints of this chapter illustrate, there is a wide diversity of opinions on the issue of racial profiling in the United States and conflicting views about whether racial profiling is a problem.\n\n19\n\nHow the Hunt for Bin Laden Made US Muslims and Immigrants Threats Seth Freed Wessler Seth Freed Wessler is an investigative reporter for Colorlines.\n\nT\n\nen years after Sept. 11, 2001, the animating target of the war on terror is dead, his body cast into the sea. A chapter is closed. Yet, in many communities here in the United States, it seemed the target was never just Osama bin Laden. For Arabs and Muslims in the U.S., and for those lumped carelessly together with them, the war on terrorism has not been an abstraction waged in far off lands, but a fight that’s engulfed communities right here at home. In the long decade since Al Qaeda accomplished the unthinkable, slaughtering thousands and ushering in a global war that’s taken countless more lives, the U.S. has massively expanded anti-terrorism operations within our own borders. The homeland security infrastructure quickly erected in the attack’s aftermath regularly targets men and women who have nothing to do with terrorism, while making racial profiling and mass deportation a regular feature of life. Less than a month after 9/11, George W. Bush launched the Office of Homeland Security, which would soon become the Department of Homeland Security. As the Department of Defense led our military into one, two, and then three wars, the Department of Homeland Security was charged with defending against the barbarians at the gates, or worse, those already in our midst. To fight the menace, DHS consolidated more than 20 agencies into one mamouth department.\n\nSeth Freed Wessler, “How the Hunt for Bin Laden Made US Muslims and Immigrants Threats,” Colorlines, May 4, 2011. Copyright © 2011 by Colorlines. All rights reserved. Reproduced by permission.\n\n20\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nPerhaps the most consequential element of this bureaucratic shift was the decision to move the regulation of immigration and borders into the realm of anti-terrorism. Overnight, decisions about who would be allowed to enter and who would be forced to leave were refracted through a lens of national security. Non-citizens and those traveling through our ports became threats by definition—people to be secured against.\n\nRacial Profiling as National Security Muslims in the U.S. became the most ominous threat, by policy. The Department of Homeland Security created the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), commonly called “Special Registration,” which functioned as a deportation net specifically for Muslims. As Colorlines’ Channing Kennedy wrote in April: Initiated in September 2002, NSEERS functioned like Arizona’s SB 1070, with working-class Muslims as the target. Its first phase required all non-citizen male residents, ages 16 to 65, from a list of “suspect” nations, to register at INS offices. Thousands of families went out of their way to comply with the law, thinking it would be part of the government-sponsored pathways to citizenship that they were already participating in. Instead, in July 2003, the Washington Post reported it as the deportation of “the largest number of visitors from Middle Eastern and other Muslim countries in U.S. history—more than 13,000 of the nearly 83,000 men older than 16 who complied with the registration program by various deadlines between last September and April.”\n\nLast week, the federal government officially ended the NSEERS program. That, says Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Michigan, “is hugely important. A victory. But we have a long, long way.” 21\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nIndeed, a new report released today jointly by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the NYU Law School and the Asian American Legal Defense Fund (AALDEF) finds that even without the explicit racial and religious targeting built into Special Registration, the Department of Homeland Security continues to push Muslims into detention and deportation in equally insidious, but less formal ways. After 9/11 the Bush administration was more than clear that it would use the immigration legal system to target people they deemed to be possible threats. Tareq Abu Fayad, a young Saudi man profiled in the report, has been detained for four years, since trying to enter the country with a valid immigration visa. Agents at the San Francisco airport deemed him a possible terrorist threat because he had saved Al Jazeera articles and September 11 conspiracy theory series on his laptop. He was ordered deported. He appealed the ruling, but a circuit court upheld the order. Sameer Ahmed, an attorney at AALDEF, explains, “After 9/11 the Bush administration was more than clear that it would use the immigration legal system to target people they deemed to be possible threats. The reason they decided to do this, rather than to only use the criminal system, is that the immigration system does not afford individuals the same rights and due process that exist in criminal law.” Fayad could never have been tried criminally because he’d never done anything to warrant criminal charges, but in immigration court the government can have him removed. “We’re seeing a trend where Muslims are being deported, detained and denied entry into the United States for no good reason except tenuous affiliations or unsubstantiated claims,” said Ahmed. Borders and airports are often the points where noncitizens are first detained. Muslims and Arabs now face a 22\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\ndense layer of racial profiling when traveling through airports and borders. Dawud Walid of CAIR explains that for communities in and around Detroit and Dearborn, Mich., which has one of the county’s largest Arab populations, “the issues at the border with border patrol are huge. People coming back from Canada and some are detained for hours, cuffed and asked questions about religious practice, about how many times they pray, ridiculous questions that have nothing to do with crime.” That’s because they have committed no crime.\n\nThe FBI’s Manufactured Threats Of course, in the absence of actual crimes and real threats, the massive domestic security apparatus has simply created them. The FBI, in its search for “homegrown” Bin Ladens, has repeatedly used secret informant-instigators to manufacture terrorist plots and then entice disaffected young men of color to get involved. According to a 2010 investigation by Democracy Now!, an FBI informant allegedly entrapped four black Muslim men from a poor neighborhood in Newburgh, N.Y., pushing them to participate in a concocted attack on a synagogue in the area. Now that U.S. forces have killed [Osama bin Laden], Muslim communities in the U.S. are left wondering what happens next. The government argues that the Newburgh men’s participation in the fake plot proves that they were predisposed to terrorism. “Those who characterize the FBI’s activities in this case as ‘entrapment’ simply do not have their facts straight—or do not have a full understanding of the law,” Attorney General Eric Holder said. But the defense contends that the men would 23\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nnever have committed any act of violence were it not for the FBI’s fabrication of a plot and its concerted campaign to convince them to join it. The broad use of manufactured plots and informants are not the Department of Justice’s only shady homeland security practices. A recent investigation in the Washington Monthly digs into the world of unchecked anti-terrorism training programs for local and state government. The programs, funded with billions in federal dollars, are often run by sideshow figures that make their money purportedly teaching local cops how to spot a terrorist. In one such class in Florida, 60 cops listened as a private-sector anti-terrorism “expert” explained Islam and how to deal with Muslims: “Anyone who says that Islam is a religion of peace is either ignorant or flat out lying. . . . The best way to handle these people is what I call legal harassment.”\n\nThe training efforts, which is one of many around the country, fit squarely within a set of Department of Justice programs meant to use local police to report “suspicious activity” to the feds—suspicious activity explained by an unabashed islamophobe. All of this is the legacy of our government’s hunt for Bin Laden. Now that U.S. forces have killed him, Muslim communities in the U.S. are left wondering what happens next. “This is a time for closure for the victims of 9/11 and in fact for all victims of terrorism all over the world,” said Hassan Jaber, the director of an Arab American social services organization in Dearborn called ACCESS. “The conversation after 9/11, that there is a clash of civilizations, really that was never the case and that theory did not work in real life.” There are sadly few signs, however, that the internal security apparatus constructed to meet that post-9/11 view of the world will die with Bin Laden. “I think the targeting of Muslims has gotten worse during the Obama administration,” says Dawud Walid of CAIR. “Just 24\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nrecently, FBI interrogations, which many people call fishing expeditions, have occurred and we have had people [in Michigan] who were asked by the FBI about their political viewpoints about what’s happening in Arab countries, in the socalled Arab Spring.” The search for terrorists continues.\n\n25\n\nRacial Profiling Is Being Used in Immigration Checks Aura Bogado Aura Bogado writes about racial justice, Native rights, and immigration for The Nation.\n\nD\n\navid de la Fuente might still be alive if his pal David Salazar hadn’t been short on cash one day. Both men lived in Phoenix [Arizona], where they’d settled after making their separate ways north from the Mexican farming village of Colonia Emilio Carranza many years earlier. Salazar and his family came across legally in 1974, while de la Fuente arrived during the 1990s, traversing the desert on foot to cross the border illegally near Nogales, Arizona. De la Fuente, a plumber, and Salazar, a delivery driver, eventually became good friends. Their families grew close, too, often spending weekends and holidays together. But that all changed one morning in May 2009, when Salazar asked de la Fuente for a ride to the ATM. They hopped into de la Fuente’s green Nissan Maxima and drove to a nearby Wells Fargo. As they were about to turn into the parking lot, a Phoenix squad car driving behind them hit its flashers.\n\nAn Arrest in Arizona By Salazar’s account, officer Matthew Prutch asked de la Fuente for a driver’s license. When he produced a fake, Prutch had him step out of the car and handcuffed him. Salazar asked the officer whether he’d pulled them over because of their skin color; Prutch, he says, replied that he was just doing his job. (In his report, Prutch wrote that he ran the Nissan’s plates while following the car and found no driver’s license Aura Bogado, “Did Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s Anti-Immigrant Zeal Kill David de la Fuente?” Mother Jones, July/August 2010.

Prutch then delivered de la Fuente to the police station for booking. From there, the 35-year-old was taken to Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio’s notorious Durango Jail, and charged with using a fake ID. A month later, he was dead. Before SB 1070, the Arizona law that allows police officers to detain anyone they suspect might be in the country without papers, there was 287(g). That’s a 1996 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act under which the feds can deputize state and local law enforcement to capture and detain undocumented immigrants. Some 71 agencies in 26 states operate under 287(g) agreements—Arpaio signed up in 2007. The man who calls himself “America’s toughest sheriff ” has long had a knack for drawing media attention—reviving chain gangs, for instance, and humiliating county inmates by forcing them to don pink underwear. He grew obsessed with illegal immigration in 2005, when the state’s “coyote statute” took effect, making it a felony to smuggle people for profit anywhere in Arizona. As interpreted by then-county prosecutor Andrew Thomas, the law freed sheriff ’s deputies to round up undocumented immigrants—after all, hadn’t these people conspired to smuggle themselves into Arizona? So Arpaio began sending out posses of citizens and lawmen to conduct immigration sweeps. “I’m not going to turn these people over to federal authorities so they can have a free ride back to Mexico,” he told the Washington Times. “I’ll give them a free ride to my jail.”\n\nA Sheriff ’s Focus on Immigration It was Arpaio’s zeal that compelled me to spend five months on his home turf last year. I wanted to see firsthand how his tactics affected the Latino residents who make up 31 percent 27\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nof the county’s population. I heard story after story—from citizens, legal immigrants, and undocumented residents alike—about encounters with deputies and cops determined to play Border Patrol. It got to the point where I raced home in a panic one morning after heading out for a jog without ID—what if a deputy, seeing a Latina running down the street, decided to haul me in? To most anyone who even looks Latino in Maricopa County, the long arm of the sheriff seems inescapable. Native Americans told me they were targeted because deputies mistook them for Latinos. Latinos told me of being stopped randomly on the street and shouted at—or worse—by officers demanding identification. Alex, a third-generation US citizen, was at a Circle K buying water while his parents waited outside. He ran out when he heard a group of Arpaio’s deputies yelling at them to produce their papers. Then, Alex said, they demanded to see his ID, too, explaining, “The law says everyone here has to be legal.” (Fearing retaliation, Alex asked that we not use his real name.) Then there was Celia Alejandra Álvarez, who told me deputies broke her jaw during a raid at the landscaping company she worked for. Álvarez said she was denied adequate medical care during her three-month detention—a common complaint that has been the subject of hundreds of lawsuits against Arpaio. Even after surgery, she added, her jaw still isn’t back to normal—during our interview she paused periodically to readjust it. (In 2008, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care yanked Maricopa County’s accreditation, saying its jails failed to meet national standards.) Maurilio (who also feared giving his real name) is a construction worker who has lived in the United States without papers for 21 years, raising two kids who are US citizens. He said his family was camping at a lake over the Fourth of July 28\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nweekend in 2008, when a fellow camper started yelling something about “too many Mexicans” and called the sheriff ’s office. The deputies, Maurilio and his wife told me, threw him down in the presence of his six-year-old son and shoved his face into the ground. They then yanked his head up by his hair and pepper-sprayed him as they cuffed him. After a few weeks at Durango, he was deported—and immediately headed to the desert to walk back north. To most anyone who even looks Latino in Maricopa County, the long arm of the sheriff seems inescapable. Indeed, Arpaio’s tactics have put his agency at the center of an ongoing civil rights investigation by the Department of Justice. In the fall of 2009, without explanation, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded Arpaio’s authority to arrest people under section 287(g)—although deputies can still check the immigration status of people arriving at the jails. In anticipation of the crackdown, Arpaio held a press conference. “We have arrested 1,600 illegals that have not committed any crime other than being here illegally,” he boasted. “The secret is, we’re still going to do the same thing—we have the state laws, and by the way, we’ll still enforce the federal laws without the oversight, the policy, the restrictions that they put on us.”\n\nThe Death of de la Fuente When David de la Fuente arrived at Durango, his friends and family say, deputies immediately began grilling him about his immigration status. One of his sisters visited twice, as did Salazar. Each told me that de la Fuente was deteriorating quickly. The guards, he told them, kept dragging him back and forth between the prison yard (where temperatures reached 107 degrees) and the frigid jail—leaving him queasy and disoriented. He also complained of severe chest pains, but fearing the guards might retaliate, told his family not to press the authorities about his condition. Eventually, de la Fuente 29\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nwas hauled before a judge, who fined him and put him on probation for giving an alias to the police. After three weeks in custody, he was turned over to federal immigration authorities, who delivered him the next day to Nogales, Mexico, about 700 miles north of his hometown. By that time, he was gravely ill. He arrived in Colonia Emilio Carranza three days later, stumbling and barely able to speak. His family got him to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with acute pneumonia. Based on the stage of his illness, the doctors determined that de la Fuente had contracted it about 15 days earlier—roughly a week into his jail stay—according to medical paperwork and an interview with the hospital director. The doctors did what they could, but de la Fuente was too far gone. His cousins and a sister stood vigil as he dwindled and eventually fell into a coma. He was pronounced dead on June 23—exactly four weeks after the traffic stop. We may never know what exactly happened to David de la Fuente inside Durango. To see his health records, family members would have to file a signed release and affidavit—something they are, not surprisingly, scared to do. What is clear is that Arpaio’s flavor of law enforcement will spread around the state if the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] (which filed suit in May 2010) fails to stop SB 1070 from taking effect. [In 2012, the US Supreme Court upheld the provision of SB 1070 allowing state police to investigate immigration status.] “The intent of the law was that it would be used disproportionately against people who have certain physical attributes,” notes Michael Wishnie, a professor at Yale Law School. “Police on the ground understand that and will act accordingly.” This past September [2009], during my visit to Colonia Emilio Carranza, Norberto Alvarado Santana said little as he showed me his cousin’s grave, in a humble cemetery adorned with plastic flowers and Virgen de Guadalupe figurines. A 30\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nstout, reserved man, he measured his words cautiously before finally breaking the silence. “There’s a word for what happened to my cousin David,” he said. “It’s homicide.”\n\n31\n\nRacial Profiling Is a Rational Response to Information Walter E. Williams Walter E. Williams is the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and a syndicated columnist.\n\nH\n\narvard Professor Henry Gates’ arrest [in July 2009, in Cambridge, Massachusetts] has given new life to the issue of racial profiling. We can think of profiling in general as a practice where people use an observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute. Race or sex profiling is simply the use of race or sex as that estimator. Profiling represents mankind’s attempt to cope with information cost. God would not have to profile since God is all knowing.\n\nRacial Profiling in Medicine People differ by race and sex. Let’s look at a few profiling examples to see which ones you’d like outlawed. According to the American Cancer Society, the lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is about 1/10th of 1 percent, or 1 in 1,000; and 440 men will die of breast cancer this year. For women, the risk of developing breast cancer is about 12 percent, or 1 in 8, and 40,610 will die from it this year. Should doctors and medical insurance companies be prosecuted for the discriminatory practice of routine breast cancer screening for women but not for men? Some racial and ethnic groups have higher incidence and mortality from various diseases than the national average. The rates of death from cardiovascular diseases are about 30 perWalter E.

Cervical cancer rates are five times higher among Vietnamese women in the U.S. than among white women. Pima Indians of Arizona have the highest known diabetes rates in the world. Prostate cancer is nearly twice as common among black men as white men. Knowing patient race or ethnicity, what might be considered as racial profiling, can assist medical providers in the delivery of more effective medical services.\n\nRacial Profiling in Assessing Criminality One might take the position that while it is acceptable for doctors to use race, ethnicity and sex as indicators of the higher probability of certain diseases, it is not acceptable to use race or ethnicity as indicators for other attributes such as criminal behavior. Other than simply stating that it is acceptable to use race or ethnicity as an information acquisition technique in the case of medicine but not in other areas of life, is there really a difference? Surely, race and ethnicity are not perfect indicators of the risk of prostate cancer or hypertension; neither are they perfect indicators of criminal behavior; however, there are concrete factual data that surely indicate associations. Criminologist Marvin Wolfgang says, “For four violent offenses—homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault—the crime rates for blacks are at least 10 times as high as they are for whites.” In a 1999 article, “Capital Cabbies Salute Race Profiling,” James Owens writes, “If racial profiling is racism, then the cab drivers of Washington, D.C., they themselves mainly blacks and Hispanics, are all for it. A District taxicab commissioner, Sandra Seegars, who is black, issued a safety-advice statement urging D.C.’s 6,800 cabbies to refuse to pick up ‘dangerous looking’ passengers. She described ‘dangerous looking’ as a young black guy . . . with shirttail hanging down longer than his coat, baggy pants, unlaced tennis shoes.” 33\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nThe Pizza Marketing Quarterly carried a story of charges of racial discrimination filed in St. Louis [Missouri] against Papa John’s pizza delivery services. Papa John’s district manager said she could not and would not ask her drivers to put their lives on the line. She added that the racial discrimination accusation is false because 75 to 85 percent of the drivers in the complaining neighborhood are black and, moreover, most of those drivers lived in the very neighborhood being denied delivery service. Some years ago, the Rev. Jesse Jackson complained, “There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery—then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.” Here’s my question: Is the racial profiling done by cab drivers, pizza deliverers or Jesse Jackson a sign of racism or economizing on information costs?\n\n34\n\nRacial Disparities in Police Activity Do Not Indicate Racial Profiling Heather Mac Donald Heather Mac Donald is a John M. Olin Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a contributing editor to City Journal, and author of Are Cops Racist? How the War Against the Police Harms Black Americans.\n\nI\n\nn 2000, a deputy attorney general in the [Bill] Clinton administration slapped the Los Angeles Police Department [LAPD] with federal oversight. A 1994 law gives the Justice Department the authority to seek control of police agencies that have engaged in a “pattern or practice” of constitutional violations. Justice’s attorneys never uncovered any systemic constitutional abuses in the LAPD as required by the 1994 law, despite having commandeered hundreds of thousands of documents (and having lost 10 boxes of sensitive records). Nevertheless, for the next decade the LAPD would operate under a draconian federal “consent decree”—a nominally consensual agreement overseen by a court—governing nearly every aspect of its operations, at a cost of over $100 million in contracting fees and in manpower diverted to mindless paperpushing.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Police Oversight The deputy attorney general who forced federal control on the LAPD in 2000 was none other than Eric Holder, who now presides over a Justice Department determined to make the Los Angeles consent decree the model for its future oversight Heather Mac Donald, “Targeting the Police,” Weekly Standard, vol. 16, no. 19, January 31, 2011.

The current assistant attorney general for civil rights, Thomas Perez, told a conference of police chiefs in June 2010 that the Justice Department would be pursuing “pattern or practice” takeovers of police departments much more aggressively than the [George W.] Bush administration, eschewing negotiation in favor of hardball tactics seeking immediate federal control. Perez has hired nine additional attorneys to beef up his division’s search for alleged police agency racism and to sue agencies that don’t capitulate to federal demands. To see what lies ahead for the nation’s police, one need look no further than the Los Angeles Police Department’s past and present travails with the Justice Department [DOJ]. The LAPD consent decree was a power grab from day one. The first thing DOJ demanded as part of its new authority over the LAPD was the collection of racial information on every stop the L.A. officers make—even though the corruption scandal which provided the pretext for the consent decree had nothing to do with race or alleged “racial profiling.” The LAPD is arguably the most professional, communityoriented police agency in the country. The 180-clause decree mired the LAPD’s operations in red tape, apparently on the theory that if cops are left to actually fight crime, rather than writing and reviewing reports, they will run amok violating people’s rights. Today, an L.A. officer can hardly nod at a civilian without filling out numerous forms documenting his salutation for later review. If he returns fire at a gangbanger, his use of force will be more intensely investigated for wrong-doing than the criminal shooting that provoked the officer’s defensive reaction in the first place. The LAPD spent approximately $40 million trying to comply with the decree in its first year and close to $50 million 36\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nannually for several years thereafter. It pulled 350 officers off the street to meet the decree’s mountainous paperwork requirements. Nevertheless, it struggled to meet the fanatical standards for compliance imposed by the federal monitor overseeing the decree, who demanded that virtually 100 percent of the arbitrary deadlines for filing reports be met on time, regardless of whether the supervisors who missed their deadline by a few days were otherwise occupied with a triple homicide investigation. In 2006, the federal court to which the monitor reported deemed the department out of compliance with the decree and extended its term. In 2009, the court ended federal control on many of the decree’s provisions, yet continued federal oversight on issues relating to “biased policing,” among other matters, until January 2011. And now the Justice Department, facing the potential final expiration of the consent decree this month, has made its most preposterous charge against the LAPD yet, in a desperate last-minute bid to retain its power over the force. According to DOJ’s civil rights division, the LAPD does not investigate racial profiling complaints with sufficient intensity. The department seems to tolerate a “culture that is inimical to race-neutral policing,” say the federal attorneys. These accusations are nothing short of delusional. The LAPD is arguably the most professional, community-oriented police agency in the country, having been led for most of the last decade by modern policing’s premier innovator, William Bratton. Moreover, it investigates every racial profiling allegation with an obsessive thoroughness that stands in stark contrast to the frivolity of most profiling accusations. There is no racial profiling complaint so patently fabricated that the department won’t subject to days of painstaking investigation through multiple chains of command. A complainant can outright admit making up the profiling charge in retaliation for being arrested, and the LAPD’s special profiling investigation body, the Constitutional Policing Unit, will continue dili37\n\nRacial Profiling\n\ngently poring over his complaint as if it had been made in good faith. After the department logs a whopping average of 100 hours on each complaint, devoting more resources to these knee-jerk accusations than to any other kind of alleged officer misbehavior, the LAPD’s civilian inspector general will audit the department’s work with a two-part, 60-question matrix, subjecting claims made by arresting officers to a reflexive skepticism unmoored from reality. The goal of this Byzantine process? To find any possible way not to dismiss complaints as unsubstantiated.\n\nA Racial Profiling Allegation A recent profiling allegation and its disposition are typical. A driver who had been cited for tinted windows denied in his racial profiling complaint that his windows were tinted and claimed that he was only stopped because he was black. He said that he was detained for an excessive 45 minutes. The arresting officers estimated that the stop lasted 15 minutes; electronic records revealed that it lasted a reasonable 18 minutes. Department personnel interviewed the complainant twice; the arresting officers were closely interrogated; and the Constitutional Policing Unit [CPU] canvassed local businesses around the stop for video of the interaction. The CPU then made an appointment to photograph the driver’s car to confirm that his windows were not tinted; the driver failed to appear at the appointment and later called the LAPD to say that he wanted no further contact from the department on his profiling complaint. Leaving aside the devastating hole that the complainant blew in his own credibility by withholding his car, the complaint was logically problematic to begin with. If the driver’s windows were tinted, the cops could not have seen his race, especially since the stop occurred at midnight. Indeed, the complainant himself reported that he had to keep his window rolled down during the stop so that the officer could see into 38\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nthe vehicle. But if the windows were not tinted, it strains credulity that an officer would cite a driver for a violation that could be so easily disproven simply by presenting the car. The career attorneys who investigate police departments for constitutional violations are possibly the most leftwing members of the standing federal bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the LAPD’s inspector general Nicole Bershon, after reviewing the voluminous case history, concluded that the accused officer should not be cleared of the profiling charge and that the department should reopen the investigation—though there was nothing more to investigate. Because the car’s windows had not been inspected, she said, the officer’s claim that he could not see the driver’s race before stopping him could not be adjudicated. Bershon, however, rehabilitated the driver’s credibility on a wholly speculative theory: Because the sergeant who logged the profiling charge asked the driver in passing if he was making the complaint to avoid paying the tinting fine, the complainant lost confidence in the process, Bershon hypothesizes, and as a result went AWOL [absent without leave] with his car. Of course, the complainant had already shown enough confidence in the process to sit for two interviews. It was only when it came time to present his car that his painful disillusionment, in Bershon’s imaginary scenario, manifested itself. Predictably, Bershon criticizes the intake sergeant for questioning the complainant’s motives, however flippantly. In an ideal world, to be sure, no police officer would ever express the slightest personal opinion in his interactions with civilians. But a station house is not an ideal world; it is peopled with human beings whose daily exposure to the full, sorry range of human behavior breeds in them a certain degree of cynicism. Regrettably, that cynicism occasionally breaks through the surface. The notion of cutting officers any slack 39\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nfor such failings, which, in light of their public service, are in any case relatively minor, is of course out of the question. It is this insanely credulous and costly process for investigating racial profiling complaints that the [Barack] Obama Justice Department claims to find insufficiently rigorous, in a disturbing harbinger for other police departments. The most damning flaw of the LAPD’s elaborate anti-profiling apparatus, from DOJ’s perspective, is that it corroborates almost none of the already minuscule number of racial profiling complaints that the department receives each year. (In 2009, the department received 219 racial profiling complaints out of nearly 200,000 arrests and over 580,000 citations.) To the Washington attorneys, the paucity of confirmed complaints proves that the investigative process is inadequate, if not in bad faith, since it is a given to the Justice Department staff that the LAPD, like every other police department, routinely violates people’s rights. The possibility that the vast majority of Los Angeles officers are operating within the law is simply not acceptable.\n\nThe Reality of Racial Crime Rates Such a preordained conclusion is not surprising, since the career attorneys who investigate police departments for constitutional violations are possibly the most left-wing members of the standing federal bureaucracy. They know, without any felt need for prolonged exposure to police work, that contemporary policing is shot through with bias. In 2002, for example, a career attorney in the policing litigation section tried to bury a rigorously designed study that showed that black drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike speed at twice the rate of white drivers, a finding of great relevance to DOJ’s thenpending charge that the higher stop rate of black drivers on the turnpike was the exclusive result of biased policing by New Jersey State Troopers. 40\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nThe speeding study was eventually leaked to the press, and the attorney who had tried so hard to suppress it—to the point of hiding its conclusions from his political bosses— resigned. The career staffers who remained, however, were just as committed to the idea that racial disparities in the rate of contact between the police and civilians must reflect officer misbehavior towards minorities, rather than varying propensities for law breaking on the part of different racial groups. During the Bush administration, political appointees to the civil rights division reined in the staff ’s eagerness to investigate police departments for racial profiling, since the profiling studies routinely served up by the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and other activist organizations were based on laughably bogus methodology. Now that those appointees have left the Justice Department, however, the staff attorneys in the policing section are back in control. And the current assistant attorney general for civil rights, after declaring that civil rights advocacy groups will once again function as the “eyes and ears” of the department, has publicly embraced the advocates’ specious methodology for measuring biased law enforcement actions. The real story behind black student discipline rates is higher levels of violence and misbehavior in school. Civil rights activists invariably use population data as the benchmark for police activity—measuring the rate of police stops for various racial groups, say, against the proportion of those groups in the local population. If the stop rate for a particular group is higher than its population ratio, the activists charge bias. Such a population benchmark could only be remotely appropriate, however, if racial crime rates were equal. They are not. In Los Angeles, for example, blacks commit 42 percent of all robberies and 34 percent of all felonies, though they are 10 percent of the city’s population. Whites commit 5 41\n\nRacial Profiling\n\npercent of all robberies and 13 percent of all felonies, though they are 29.4 percent of the city’s population. Such crime disparities—which are repeated in every big city—mean that the police cannot focus their resources where crime victims most need them without disproportionate enforcement activity in minority neighborhoods, but it is crime, not race, which determines such police deployment. This September [2010], Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Perez announced a litigation campaign against school districts for so-called “disciplinary profiling”—disciplining black students at a higher rate than white students. He used student population ratios as the benchmark for appropriate rates of student discipline. “The numbers tell the story,” he said. “While blacks make up 17 percent of the student population, they are 37 percent of the students penalized by out-of-school suspensions and 43 percent of the students expelled.” Actually, those numbers don’t tell the story. The real story behind black student discipline rates is higher levels of violence and misbehavior in school, a reality Perez ignored completely. DOJ’s future assessment of police stops and other enforcement actions will likewise inevitably ignore higher rates of black crime.\n\nA Campaign Driven by Politics DOJ’s assertion that the culture of the LAPD is “inimical to race-neutral policing” exploits this same blindness to the facts of crime. The Justice Department has seized on a single exchange between two cops who were caught on tape discussing a profiling complaint brought against a fellow officer. One says: “So what?” The other responds that he “couldn’t do [his] job without racially profiling.” To the feds, this exchange can have only one meaning: These and other cops are randomly hauling over blacks and Hispanics to harass them. But if the officers were involved in gang enforcement, as almost any of42\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nficer patrolling in the city’s southern and eastern sections will likely at some point be, attention to a suspect’s race and ethnicity is unavoidable, since L.A.’s gangs are obsessively selfdefined by skin color. Until Los Angeles gangs give up their fealty to racial identity, they can expect police officers trying to protect the public from their lethal activities to take their race and ethnicity into account in identifying them. Once the federal attorneys show up in town, for what can be a multiyear fishing expedition through thousands of documents, they rarely disclose to the police department what exactly they are looking for. The greatest beneficiary of the coming campaign against police departments will be the police monitoring business. Police monitors, paid for by the locality but reporting to a federal court, range from attorneys to former police officials; they are ostensibly jointly selected by the locality and the Justice Department, but repeat business depends on not antagonizing their DOJ backers. The industry has already perfected such fee-generating practices as billing eight hours to summarize a one-hour meeting. Detroit’s federal monitor collected from $120,000 to $193,000 a month for her services, for a cool $13 million, which Detroit is now trying to recover after discovering that she consorted with the mayor during her tenure as monitor. The New Jersey State Police spent $36 million to build the racial profiling monitoring system demanded by the Clinton Justice Department and $70 million running it. Oakland’s federal monitor pulled in nearly $2 million for her two most recent years overseeing the financially strapped department, which now allocates 35 officers for internal affairs investigations, but only 10 for homicides. Oakland’s monitor previously worked for DOJ’s pattern or practice section and has just been rehired there, where she can be expected to impose similar staffing priorities on other departments. Now 43\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nthat Assistant Attorney General Perez intends to revive the L.A. model of indefinitely renewable, rigidly prescriptive consent decrees (which Bush officials had tried to streamline), the monitoring business can expect to clean up even further. There are police departments that could benefit from expert advice from actual police professionals on such issues as use of force, but these are unlikely to draw the attention of the Justice Department. Five-man departments in rural areas where the police chief is the mayor’s brother-in-law may well have developed questionable habits, such as walloping suspects who talk back to their arresting officers. Perez has said that he wants to pursue “high-impact” cases, however—meaning big-city departments with a national media presence, even if those departments are already permeated by layers of internal and external safeguards against abuse. DOJ’s attorneys are homing in on the New York Police Department [NYPD], for example, having recently convened a closed-door session with the city’s anti-cop advocates to discuss the multicultural NYPD’s alleged failings toward immigrant populations.\n\nThe Real Abuse If the Justice Department were serious about police reform, it would publish its standards for opening a pattern or practice investigation so that police agencies could take preventive action on their own. It has never done so, however, because it has no standards for opening an investigation; the initial recommendation to do so is based on the whims of the staffers, such as: “I feel like going to Seattle and my Google sweep picked up a few articles on the police there” or “My buddy at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense and Educational Fund called me and asked us to open up an investigation in Des Moines.” Once the federal attorneys show up in town, for what can be a multiyear fishing expedition through thousands of documents, they rarely disclose to the police department what exactly they 44\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nare looking for. Meanwhile, the local press engages in a frenzy of speculation about which racist practices the feds are investigating and pressures the department to cave in to federal control. While DOJ pursues the phantom of widespread police racism, the real abuse in minority communities gets no attention from the civil rights division. In Los Angeles on Halloween 2010, five-year-old Aaron Shannon Jr. was showing off his Spiderman costume in his family’s South-Central backyard when he was fatally shot by two young thugs from the Kitchen Crips gang. Aaron was randomly selected in retaliation for an earlier gang shooting; his family had no known gang ties. DOJ’s pattern or practice attorneys had nothing to say about such grotesque violence even as they were rebuking the LAPD for its alleged inadequacies investigating profiling complaints. And if the LAPD had stopped known gang members around the Shannon home after the Halloween homicide in order to seek intelligence about the shooting, every stop the officers made would have been tallied against the department in DOJ’s racial profiling calculus, simply because the Kitchen Crips and their rivals are black. Though reform police chiefs like William Bratton and the NYPD’s Ray Kelly have brought crime down to near record lows over the last decade and a half, violence continues to afflict minority communities at astronomically higher levels than white communities. For the last two decades, the public discourse around policing has focused exclusively on alleged police racism to avoid talking about a far more serious and pervasive problem: black crime. If a fraction of the public attention that has been devoted to flushing out supposed police bias had been devoted to stigmatizing criminals and revalorizing the two-parent family, the association between black communities and heavy police presence might have been broken. Instead, the Obama Justice Department promises a further retreat from honesty. 45\n\nProfiling on Steroids John F. McManus John F. McManus is president of the John Birch Society.\n\nA\n\ns a guest on a radio talkshow, I was asked for my view about SB 1070, the Arizona law featured in headlines across the nation. I said that I approved what the Arizonans had done because the federal government wasn’t doing its job and the people were simply demanding relief from the flood of illegal immigrants who had poured into their state. Talkshow co-host number one was aghast. Asked why, she swiftly offered, “It’s profiling!” Though I could have correctly countered that it isn’t profiling, I decided on this occasion to take a different tack. “So you don’t like profiling?” I said. “Not at all,” came the reply. “Then you must be opposed to affirmative action, which is profiling on steroids.” Dead silence ensued, interrupted a moment later by cohost number two who offered, “That’s a great argument.” Naming the radio personalities isn’t necessary. The point about profiling having caused co-host number one some deep embarrassment, the program moved on to another topic. Affirmative action is nothing without profiling. It has been enforced by government decrees for decades. In the upsidedown world in which we live, it’s perhaps not surprising to know that the practice grew from a 1964 law whose wording emphatically barred the practice. That’s right; the 1964 Civil Rights Act specifically forbade relying on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin when hiring. Henceforth, employers covered by the act (meaning most throughout the nation)\n\nJohn F. McManus, “Profiling on Steroids,” New American, vol. 26, no. 15, July 19, 2010, p. 44.

Reproduced by permission.\n\n46\n\nIs Racial Profiling a Problem?\n\nwere forbidden to discriminate in any of these manners when hiring, promoting, etc. One of the act’s most outspoken promoters, Minnesota’s Senator Hubert Humphrey, offered to “start eating the pages one after another” if anyone could show that an employer would have to hire on the basis of skin color, national origin, etc. But here’s what happened: The act spawned creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency given power to interpret the law, encourage compliance, and bring charges against an employer deemed to be in violation. One year later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246 mandating the very opposite of what the 1964 act had forbidden. Now, employers were forced to consider the very human attributes they were forbidden to note one year earlier. A madhouse had been erected. Affirmative action, merely talked about for several years, was now law. Its legacy has emphatically heightened race consciousness all across the nation. And Senator Humphrey never ate any of the act’s pages. There’s nothing “equal” about employment when affirmative action is in vogue. There’s no doubt that some of the opponents of the 1964 law took their stand because of personal prejudice regarding race. But others, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for one, rightly opposed the measure claiming that the federal government had no constitutional authorization to establish hiring practices for an employer. He, too, was called a racist, and any hope to defeat the act died amidst widespread focus on charges of racism. Once enacted, the federal government became a legal force in the workplace on behalf of affirmative action, turning on its head the principle that the law must be colorblind and threatening punishment for anyone who refused to comply. The madness extended to hiring and promotion prac47\n\nRacial Profiling\n\ntices in police and fire departments, colleges and universities, and anywhere else federal dollars have paved the way for federal controls. In time, there wasn’t even a need to show dependence on federal dollars in order to dictate to employers whom they could hire and promote. In 1978, Californian Allan Bakke found himself denied entrance to the University of California Medical School, while 16 less-qualified applicants won admission courtesy of an affirmative action program. Bakke sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices demonstrated their cowardice by ruling in Bakke’s favor (he could now go to the medical school) but refusing to void affirmative action. Racial bitterness continued to grow. Later Supreme Court decisions saw Justices White and Rehnquist fasten the term “racial quotas” to the practice. Even their objections weren’t enough to stop it. Affirmative action has also spawned a form of schizophrenia. It has government agencies, educational institutions, and various other employers who are beholden to federal dollars placing completely contradictory claims within their hiring advertisements. The ads read, “We are an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer/ We Believe in Affirmative Action.” There’s nothing “equal” about employment when affirmative action is in vogue. Finally, it must be stressed that Arizona’s SB 1070 doesn’t call for “profiling” any more than numerous already-existing federal and state law-enforcement practices. Under the Arizona law, law-enforcement officials are required to make a reasonable effort (e.g., asking for an ID that would satisfy the law such as an Arizona driver’s license) to determine the immigration status of illegal-alien suspects during “lawful contacts.” That’s not profiling; it’s common sense. Real profiling, the kind featured by affirmative action with all the injustice and bitterness it has brought, continues apace. It should be abolished. 48\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\n49\n\nOverview: Perceptions of Racial Profiling by Muslim Americans Pew Research Center The Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan think tank that provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends.\n\nN\n\nearly 10 years after the 9/11 [2001] terrorist attacks, a majority of Muslim Americans (55%) say that it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United States, and a sizable minority report having experienced specific instances of mistreatment or discrimination in the past year. A majority also says that Muslims generally are singled out by the U.S. government’s terrorism policies. However, reports about these experiences have not increased substantially since 2007 and the number saying it has become more difficult to be Muslim in the U.S. is not significantly larger than it was four years ago. When asked to name the biggest problems facing Muslims in the United States, most cite negative views about Muslims, discrimination and prejudice, or public misconceptions about Islam. Nonetheless, only 16% of Muslim Americans say that the American people are generally unfriendly toward Muslims, while a large majority (66%) views life for Muslims as better in the U.S. than in most Muslim countries. . . .\n\nThe Problems Facing Muslim Americans Negative views about Muslims, discrimination and ignorance about Islam top the list of the problems Muslim Americans say they face. The most frequently mentioned problem is Pew Research Center, “Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism,” August 30, 2011, pp. 43, 46–49. Copyright © 2011 by Pew Research Center. All rights reserved. Reproduced by permission.\n\n50\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\npeople’s negative views about Muslims (29%), including stereotyping, being viewed as terrorists and distrust. One-in-five (20%) cite discrimination, prejudice and unfair treatment as the biggest problem facing Muslims in this country. Another 15% mention ignorance or misconceptions about Islam. Far fewer cite religious or cultural problems between Muslims and non-Muslims (7%) and negative media portrayals (5%). Only 4% of Muslim Americans mention jobs or financial problems, issues that have dominated the public’s list of most important problems for the past several years. Just 4% say that clashes or disputes within the Muslim community are among the most important problems. About one-in-six (16%) Muslim Americans say there are no problems facing Muslims living in the United States today. More than a quarter of Muslim Americans (28%) say that in the past year people have acted as if they were suspicious of them because they were a Muslim, and 22% say that they have been called offensive names. About one-in-five (21%) say they have been singled out by airport security officials because they are Muslim; among those who report having flown in the past year, 36% say they have been singled out by security officials. More Muslim Americans born in the U.S. than those born elsewhere say they have experienced hostility in the past 12 months. Another 13% of Muslim Americans say they have been singled out by other law enforcement officials and 6% say they have been physically threatened or attacked. Overall, 43% of Muslim Americans report experiencing at least one of these kinds of acts in the past 12 months. However, reports about these types of experiences have not increased substantially since 2007 (40% said they had experienced at least one of 51\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nthese acts then). Further, nearly as many (37%) say that someone has expressed support for them in the past year because they are Muslim.\n\nThe Perceptions of Particular Muslim Groups As was the case in 2007, younger Muslims are far more likely to say they have been victims of discrimination or intolerance based on their religion. More than half (56%) of Muslims under the age of 30 say they have been treated with suspicion, called offensive names, singled out by law enforcement of some kind or have been physically threatened in the past year. That compares with 35% of Muslim Americans age 30 and older. More Muslim Americans born in the U.S. than those born elsewhere say they have experienced hostility in the past 12 months (54% vs. 37%). Native-born Muslims who are not African American were especially likely to report having experienced one of the five hostile acts (61%). Among foreign-born Muslims, those born in South Asian countries are more likely than those born in Pakistan to say they have experienced one of these hostile acts in the past year. Muslims who are highly religious are more likely to say that they have been the target of discrimination or hostile acts in the past year than those who are less religious. Fully 55% of those who are highly committed say this, compared with 38% of those who are less committed.\n\nThe Perceptions of Anti-Terrorism Measures A majority (52%) of Muslim Americans believe the government’s anti-terrorism policies single out Muslims for increased surveillance and monitoring, while 34% say they do not think Muslims are singled out. Further, 18% say that being singled out bothers them a lot and an additional 20% say 52\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\nit bothers them some. There has been no increase since 2007 in the percentage of Muslim Americans reporting that Muslims in the U.S. are singled out or that being targeted bothers them. The general public is more divided on this question—as many say that Muslim Americans are not singled out by the government’s anti-terrorism measures (46%) as say that they are (44%). Just a quarter of the public (25%) say they are bothered that Muslims are singled out. Among Muslim Americans, more men than women say that Muslims are singled out by the government’s antiterrorism policies (57% vs. 47%), but there is no difference in the number saying that they are bothered by being singled out. As with experiences of suspicion and hostile acts, the belief that government anti-terrorism efforts single out Muslim Americans is far more widespread among native-born Muslim Americans than those born elsewhere. About seven-in-ten (71%) native-born Muslim Americans say that the government singles out Muslims in the U.S. and 57% say this bothers them a lot or some. By comparison, 41% of foreign-born Muslims say this and only 28% say they are bothered by being singled out. There are no significant differences among foreign-born Muslims based on when they came to the U.S. or where they were born.\n\nThe Muslim Community and Law Enforcement Fully 68% of Muslim Americans say that Muslims are cooperating as much as they should with law enforcement agencies investigating extremism in the Muslim American community, while 14% say they are not cooperating enough; 18% do not offer an answer. A majority of Muslim Americans in nearly all demographic groups agree that Muslims are cooperating as much as they should. 53\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nMore men than women say this (75% vs. 62%). In addition, religiously observant Muslims are more likely than those who are less religious to say that Muslim Americans are cooperating with law enforcement as much as they should (75% vs. 66%).\n\n54\n\nAirport Security: Let’s Profile Muslims Asra Q. Nomani Asra Q. Nomani is the author of Standing Alone: An American Woman’s Struggle for the Soul of Islam.\n\nF\n\nor all those holiday travelers negotiating the Transportation Security Administration’s [TSA’s] new cop-a-feel strategy, there is a difficult solution we need to consider: racial and religious profiling.\n\nThe Taboo of Racial Profiling As an American Muslim, I’ve come to recognize, sadly, that there is one common denominator defining those who’ve got their eyes trained on U.S. targets: MANY of them are Muslim—like the Somali-born teenager arrested Friday night [November 26, 2010] for a reported plot to detonate a car bomb at a packed Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Portland, Oregon. We have to talk about the taboo topic of profiling because terrorism experts are increasingly recognizing that religious ideology makes terrorist organizations and terrorists more likely to commit heinous crimes against civilians, such as blowing an airliner out of the sky. Certainly, it’s not an easy or comfortable conversation but it’s one, I believe, we must have. This past week [November 22, 2010], as part of a debate series sponsored by the New York-based group Intelligence Squared, I argued that U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling. (Taking the opposite stand was a “debating team” that included the former director of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff; Columbia University Asra Q. Nomani, “Airport Security: Let’s Profile Muslims,” Daily Beast, November 28, 2010. Copyright © 2010 by Asra Q. Nomani. Reproduced by permission.\n\n55\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nscholar of Pakistan, Hassan Abbas; and Debra Burlingame, a former flight attendant whose brother was a pilot of one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 [2001].) I realize that in recent years, profiling has become a dirty word, synonymous with prejudice, racism, and bigotry. But while I believe our risk assessment should not end with religion, race and ethnicity, I believe that it should include these important elements, as part of a “triage” strategy that my debate partner, former CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] case officer Robert Baer, says airports and airliners already do.\n\nA Rational Threat Assessment Profiling doesn’t have to be about discrimination, persecution, or harassment. As my debating partner, conservative columnist Deroy Murdock put it: “We are not arguing that the TSA should send anyone named Mohammad to be waterboarded somewhere between the first-class lounge and the Pizza Hut.” Today, the threat has changed, and it is primarily coming from Muslims who embrace al Qaeda’s radical brand of Islam. And more Americans, it seems, are willing to choose racial and religious profiling as one part of keeping our skies safe. At the beginning of the debate, 37 percent of the audience was for religious and racial profiling, while 33 percent were against and 30 percent were undecided. By the end of the debate, 49 percent of the audience was for religious and racial profiling, 40 percent were against and the rest were undecided, meaning that the motion carried. Of course, this “victory” in a scholarly debate doesn’t mean that the motion would necessarily win any broader popularity contests. In the debate, I said, “Profile me. Profile my family,” because, in my eyes, we in the Muslim community have failed to 56\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\npolice ourselves. In an online posting of the Intelligence Squared video, a Muslim viewer called me an “Uncle Tom.” But to me, profiling isn’t about identity politics but about threat assessment. According to a terrorism database at the University of Maryland, which documents 60 attacks against airlines and airports between 1970 and 2007, the last year available, suspects in attacks during the 1970s were tied to the Jewish Defense League, the Black Panthers, the Black September, the National Front for the Liberation of Cuba, Jewish Armed Resistance and the Croatian Freedom Fighters, along with a few other groups. In each of these groups’ names was a religious or ethnic dimension. For that time, those were the identities that we needed to assess. Today, the threat has changed, and it is primarily coming from Muslims who embrace al Qaeda’s radical brand of Islam.\n\nThe Relevance of National Origin and Ethnicity Data in reports released over the past several months from New York University’s Center for Security and the Law; the Congressional Research Service, and the Rand Corporation reveal that over the past decade not only are many defendants in terrorism cases Muslim, but they trace their national or ethnic identity back to specific countries. According to the Rand study “Would-Be Warriors,” the national origins or ethnicities most defendants came from was Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Jordan and Egypt, with a handful from the Muslim areas of the Balkans. To be sure, according to New York University’s Center for Security and the Law “Terrorist Trial Report Card,” an analysis of terrorism cases prosecuted between 2001 and 2009 reveals that identifying race and ethnicity doesn’t mean stereotyping according to country. Among the hundreds of defendants in 57\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nthe study, the largest number held U.S. citizenship. Law enforcement officials familiar with the cases said many of the Americans were ethnically connected to Pakistan, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. The study, however, didn’t look specifically at the ethnicities of the U.S. citizens. According to the study, there were high incidents of cases of passport holders from those countries among the defendants.\n\nMuslim Plots Against Airliners and Airports The track record of Muslim plots against airliners and airports is clear, starting with the 1989 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. After the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, Ramzi Yousef schemed with his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Muslim of Pakistani Baluchi ethnicity, to blow up 12 jetliners traveling from Asia to the U.S., intending to kill as many as 4,000 people. The plan fell apart in 1995 after a chemical fire caught the attention of police in the Philippines, but a test run had already killed one passenger seated near a nitroglycerin bomb on a Philippine Airlines Flight. Three years later, Osama bin Laden [al Qaeda terrorist leader] threatened to bring down U.S. and Israeli aircrafts through the International Islamic Front for Fighting Against the Jews and Crusaders, warning the attacks would be “pitiless and violent” and announcing that “the war has begun.” What makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology. When you combine religion and ethnonationalism, you get a dangerous combination. “Our response to the barbaric bombardment against Muslims of Afghanistan and Sudan will be ruthless and violent,” he said in a statement. “All the Islamic world has mobilized to strike a prominent American or Israeli strategic objective, to 58\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\nblow up their airplanes and to seize them.” A declassified CIA memo written in December 1998 warned: “Bin Ladin preparing to hijack U.S. aircraft.” In 1999, we had a “Millennium bomber,” targeting Los Angeles International Airport. And, in a case that became very personal to me, on Dec. 24, 1999, a group of Pakistani Muslim militants hijacked an Indian Airlines jet from Kathmandu, Nepal, diverting it to Kandahar, Afghanistan, killing one newlywed passenger. In exchange for the passengers, India released Muslim militants, including a Pakistan-British Muslim militant named Omar Sheikh. Sheikh went on to mastermind the 2002 kidnapping of my friend, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, whom Khalid Sheikh Mohammed later confessed to killing. After the Kathmandu hijacking, we had the 9/11 attacks. And since then, we’ve had the “Torrance Plotters,” the “JFK Airport Plotters,” the Glasgow, Scotland, bombers, and the “Transatlantic bombers,” all targeting airlines and airports. More recently, there was the attempt by the “underwear bomber,” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who last Christmas [2009] attempted to blow up explosives in his underwear—a foiled attack that brought the pat-downs of today. In addition to the Portland plot, most recently, we had the package bomb attempt out of Yemen last month [October 2010].\n\nThe Need for Pragmatism Victor Asal, a political science professor at State University of New York [SUNY] at Albany, and Karl Rethemeyer, a professor of public administration and policy at SUNY at Albany, have studied 395 terrorist organizations in operation between 1998 and 2005, and Asal concludes, “What makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology. When you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination.” 59\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nAsal, the son of a Tunisian father, says there hasn’t been enough research done for him to take a stand on racial and religious profiling, but favors “behavioral profiling,” which assesses risky behavior like buying one-way tickets with cash and flying without checked baggage. As attorney R. Spencer MacDonald put it in an article in the Brigham Young University Journal of Public Law, we can have “rational profiling.” I know this is an issue of great distress to many people. But I believe that we cannot bury our heads in the sand anymore. We have to choose pragmatism over political correctness, and allow U.S. airports and airlines to do religious and racial profiling.\n\n60\n\nConcerns About Racial Profiling Should Not Inhibit Terrorist Surveillance Richard A. Epstein Richard A. Epstein is the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at New York University Law School.\n\nI\n\nn the aftermath of the terrorist bombing—no lesser word will do—at the Boston Marathon [April 15, 2013], a major debate has broken out over the proper law enforcement procedures in two key areas: general surveillance and targeted searches. Many insist that a general right to privacy should limit the first, and that concern with racial and ethnic profiling should limit the second. Both of these overinflated concerns should be stoutly resisted.\n\nThe Way Forward on Surveillance The task of unearthing terrorist activities is like looking for a needle in the haystack. Even the best system of oversight and surveillance will turn up an extraordinarily high percentage of false positives, for the simple reason that the odds of any given lead providing useful information, although hard to estimate, may be very small. It takes, therefore, a very large payoff indeed to justify government action in those cases, which is why police surveillance and monitoring should receive high priority only in cases where the risk justifies the large public expenditures and the serious intrusions on privacy of those targeted individuals. At this point, the questions arise of what Richard A. Epstein, “Civil Liberties After Boston,” Defining Ideas, April 30, 2013. Copyright © 2013 by the Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University. All rights reserved. Reproduced by permission.\n\n61\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nkind of surveillance should be used, and when and how law enforcement officials can target particular individuals. The Tsarnaev brothers’ attack at the Boston Marathon has brought forth an insistent public call for an increase in surveillance to detect suspicious activities before it is too late. To be sure, there are always technical difficulties in using surveillance devices. But any objection on that ground should be treated solely as means-ends questions, which can in large measure be answered by improved software in such key areas as facial recognition detection. The moral, social, and constitutional objections are sadly misplaced. Yet, post bombing, intense political opposition has arisen in Massachusetts over the wider use of drones and other surveillance devices at next year’s Boston Marathon. Republican Sen. Robert Hedlund of the Massachusetts Legislature has sponsored restrictive legislation on drones with two key provisions. First, the legislation would prohibit the generalized use of drones in Boston, without the explicit prior approval of local governments, including the Boston City Council. Second, the legislation would “prohibit data collection about lawful peaceful activity,” which in turn would be backed up by public disclosure of drone use. Hedlund’s stated rationale runs as follows: It’s not surprising that you have law enforcement agencies rushing out to use [the Boston bombing and subsequent manhunt] as pretext to secure additional powers but I think we have to maintain perspective and realize that civil liberties and the protections we’re granted under the Constitution and our rights to privacy, to a degree, are nonnegotiable. . . . You don’t want to let a couple of young punks beat us and allow our civil liberties to be completely eroded. I don’t fall into the trap that, because of the hysteria, we need to kiss our civil liberties away. 62\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\nThe Role of Government in Preventing Terrorism Hedlund is dead wrong here—and this is from a writer whose entire career has been devoted to imposing workable and principled limitations on government power. First, the essential task of government is to preserve the life, liberty, and property of all individuals within its jurisdiction against their forcible destruction by other individuals. Second, a system of ex post (after the fact) criminal punishments forms at best only one part of a coherent and comprehensive strategy. It [is] foolish to elevate privacy—itself a complex notion—to that “nonnegotiable” status under a Constitution that also values the protection of life, liberty, and property. Compensation after the fact from terrorists is rarely, if ever, available. And even if it should magically materialize, it does not bring dead people back to life or heal the wounded. Criminal sanctions will not deter suicide bombers, nor can they be meted out in proportion to the mayhem that these people cause. Major ex ante (before the fact) precautions are imperative to stop the endless loss of life and limb that ex post sanctions cannot deter. Nor is there any “pretext” at work in insisting on greater deterrence. It is easy to pooh pooh a major social threat like terrorism by reducing it to the conduct of “young punks,” the very people most likely to engage in violent activity.\n\nThe Need for the Collection of Information Unfortunately, Hedlund compounds his initial error with two further mistakes. His first is constitutional, with the false claim that our rights of privacy under the Constitution are 63\n\nRacial Profiling\n\n“nonnegotiable.” Fortunately, no provision of the United States Constitution requires this rigid and destructive point of view. The basic command of the Fourth Amendment says that, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . .” For these purposes, the operative term is “unreasonable,” which, in light of the weighty interests on all sides of the dispute, requires some public judgment that compares the risks of inaction with those of excessive action. This unavoidable balancing process makes it foolish to elevate privacy—itself a complex notion—to that “nonnegotiable” status under a Constitution that also values the protection of life, liberty, and property. Second, the last thing needed in these difficult circumstances is a squeamishness about aggressive government action. It is wholly unwise to think that we can turn surveillance devices on and off with the flip of a switch, as Hedlund proposes, and still get the information we need. The correct approach is to do exactly what Hedlund would stop: collect troves of information about the conduct of people in public places, which can then be stored for future use. The key protection of civil liberties lies in the restricted access and use of that information. Unauthorized use is subject to severe penalties and should be invoked to allow for the full collection of the relevant information. Indeed, similar activities have to take place in monitoring the Internet use of suspected terrorists—and similar constraints must apply. The information can be collected and reviewed for limited law enforcement purposes, so long as its unauthorized release or use is subject to heavy criminal sanctions. One great advantage of this comprehensive approach to surveillance in public places is that it avoids the risk that the surveillance will be conducted in a discriminatory fashion. The collection of information covers everybody who comes to public places. Yet once the information gathered reveals some 64\n\nShould Arab Muslims Be Profiled in the War on Terror?\n\npotential targets, it then justifies closer surveillance of key individuals who can be singled out by their past activities. As the evidence gets stronger, so too does the case for more aggressive law enforcement actions. Whenever possible, these enhanced government activities should be subject to some kind of independent oversight, similar to the surveillance warrants of the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] courts, which deal with the wiretaps that are in place today.\n\nReasonable Suspicion and the Terry Stop The need for expedited action also applies to individual decisions of law enforcement personnel operating on suspicion, where the immediacy of the situation makes it difficult, if not impossible, to introduce an added layer of judicial protection. It surely makes no sense to stop and frisk a proportionate number of white males for no reason. As far back as 1969, the United States Supreme Court, speaking through Chief Justice Earl Warren in Terry v. Ohio, held, after much handwringing, that a police officer did not have to show probable cause in order to stop and frisk a person on public streets. Reasonable suspicion that unlawful activity might happen was all that was needed to justify what are now commonly called “Terry stops.” Justice John Marshall Harlan tightened the noose still further by noting that whenever the police had enough reason to stop a person, the right to frisking him followed “automatically” given the ever-present risk that the party stopped might be carrying a concealed weapon. This decision has generated many complaints about racial profiling, an issue that the Warren Court was well aware of at the time. There is no reason to sugarcoat the painful choice. These frisks are honest-to-goodness searches and they can be highly intrusive, covering even intimate body parts where 65\n\nRacial Profiling\n\nweapons could be concealed. They are also more likely to be conducted in high-crime areas with a disproportionate number of young African-American males. No one can deny the unhappy fact that a huge number of erroneous searches will take place, for which there is, after the fact, no effective remedy at all. Unsuccessful searches yield no evidence that could be rendered inadmissible at trial. Yet there are no sensible alternatives to the Terry rule. It surely makes no sense to stop and frisk a proportionate number of white males for no reason. In addition, it is virtually impossible to construct an intelligent system of ex post compensation to redress the large number of low-level harms that undoubtedly occurred when an innocent person was frisked. Terry was unusually candid in recognizing that it chose the best of a bad lot, by allowing substantial errors in order to protect against yet greater losses. The Terry court further hedged its bets by announcing that its ruling applied only to this particular case. But history has not worked out that way. Today reasonable suspicion virtually always justifies the search and the frisk that follows.\n\nThe Racial Profiling of Muslims Clearly, the stakes on ethnic profiling are higher than ever after the Boston Marathon—which makes it all the more important to keep the law in focus. Jonathan Chait recently wrote a short piece in New York Magazine entitled: “Profiles in Profiling: From the appalling New York Post to the rest of us.” He observed: The Muslim world has certainly produced more than its share of terrorists. But there is a conceptual fallacy at the root of the nativist paranoia the Post (and other elements of the Murdoch media) have eagerly exploited: One cannot infer from the fact that many terrorists are Muslims the conclusion that many Muslims a"
