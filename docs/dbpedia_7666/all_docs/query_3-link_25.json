First of all, there was word that Warner Communications, Inc. (WCI) was in negotiations to merge PolyGram Records with its own record group, which already includes the Warner Bros., Elektra/Asylum, Atlantic and Geffen labels. Then, equally significant, Motown will leave the ranks of the indies in favor of branch distribution by MCA. Both developments indicate the seriousness of the shake-out now taking place in the distribution arena. If the WCI-PolyGram merger is carried out, the industry will lose one of its branch operations — the very same one that only a few short years ago carried the two best-selling albums of all time, the soundtracks to Saturday Night Fever and Grease. The speculation that the recession has caused such a drop in unit volume that a major branch would have to fold may soon come to pass. Even more serious in its implications for the in- CONTENTS DEPARTMENTS Black Contemporary 23 Classifieds 30 Country 18 Gospei 22 international 27 Jazz 12 Merchandising 14 Radio 16 Video 13 FEATURES Coast To Coast 11 Editorial 3 Executives On The Move 9 Faces To Watch 7 CHARTS Top 100 Singies 4 Top 200Aibums 28,29 Black Contemporary Albums 23 Black Contemporary Singles 24 Country Albums 19 Country Singles 20 Gospel Albums 22 International Albums, Singles 27 Jazz Albums 12 Jukebox Prog^rammer 34 Rock Album Radio Report 17 Top 15 Midlines 14 Top 30 Videocassettes 13 Top 15 Video Games 14 REVIEWS Albums 6 Singles 8 Talent 10 ing Tim6S see story on page 5 dustry is the Motown-MCA plan. The last remaining major independent label, Motown now appears pinched by circumstance. With the recent demise of Pickwick, Motown was forced to assume some dis- tribution responsibilities and rearrange others at a time when its 25th Anniversary albums and the good publicity generated by its recent TV special made its product particularly hot. However, how will the independent distributors continue to exist? A few years ago, the ranks of indie-distributed labels included A&M, Casablanca, RSO, Chrysalis, Arista and Motown; but with this new deal, the last of these will have gone to the branches. Then what? Cash Box certainly does not intend to cast blame about, but the implications of these actions are clear — the record industry is about to undergo a very significant change. Let’s hope that it will end up as something we can all still live with. ON THE COVER MCA recorijing group The Fixx snuck up on the new music- conscious American teens last year with the intoxicatingly dreamy single “Stand Or Fall\" from its debut album, “Shuttered Room.” The song clung tenaciously to AOR lists throughout the country, grow- ing like a vine, until it pulled such other tracks as “Red Skies (At Night)” with it. The result was that \"Shuttered Room” became a certifiable new rock sleeper, hanging on the charts for the better part of this year, until the English band came out with the follow-up, “Reach The Beach.” If “Shuttered Room” served notice that The Fixx was a force to be reckoned with, the success of “Reach The Beach” clearly indicates that the band has arrived. After seven weeks, the first single, “Saved By Zero,” stands at #33 bullet on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart, while the LP has moved to exactly the same position on the Top 100 Albums chart. As The Fixx — Cy Cumin, Adam Woods, Jamie West-Oram and Rupert Greenall — say on the opening track from “Reach The Beach,” “One thing leads to another.” TOP POP DEBUTS SINGLES 64 LAWYERS IN LOVE — Jackson Browne — Asylum /1LBUMS 73 TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE — Quarterflash — Geffen POP SINGLE ELECTRIC AVENUE Eddy Grant Portrait/CBS B/C SINGLE ALL THIS LOVE DeBarge Gordy/Motown COUNTRY SINGLE HIGHWAY 40 BLUES Ricky Skaggs Epic J/1ZZ IN YOUR EYES George Benson Warner Bros.

(WCI) and the PolyGram Group last week revealecf that they are discussing a restructuring that would see WCI gain the controlling Interest In PolyGram Records. The proposed deal would create two com- ■ panles: a Warner/PolyGram company for territories outside the U.S., of which WCI • ■ would own 50%, and a U.S. company, of which WCI would own 80%. Neither company would comment beyond a brief printed statement released , by WCI last Wednesday, June 29, and a WCI spokesman declined to suggest a ' possible timetable for completion of a deal. With the PolyGram group presently ow- ned jointly by N.V. Philips of The Netherlands and Slemans AG of West Ger- many, the proposed merger would see Slemans taking a decreasing role In the , record business. Among the largest changes Inherent In T Talk Dominates ' Top Markets In Spring Arb Book I by Harry Weinger NEW YCRK — Talk radio remained the J dominant format In top markets according to advance Spring '83 Arbitron ratings results. Talk outlets In New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco were #1 respectively, with black/urban and con- \"| temporary music stations running a close second. In another significant trend, t I beautiful music experienced healthy gains . I in New York and Los Angeles, while FM outlet KJQY in San Diego retained its market lead.

In New York, WOR-AM took the top spot ! j from news outlet WINS with a 5.2, up from '-L Winter’s 4.9. WINS dropped from 5.4 to a 4.8. All-news WCBS was also down, 4.6 to -L 4.3. The three-way race for the urban con- temporary share remained tight as WBLS regained its lead and actually tied WOR for ’ #1 with a 5.2, also up from a 4.9. WKTU traded numbers with WBLS, dropping to a (continued on page 16) merger would affect PolyGram’s classics division, which has its own sales staff, or PolyGram Special Imports. WEA Inter- national presently has its own exclusive im- port arrangement with Jem Records for domestic sale of foreign titles. It was stressed that PolyGram Records U.S. will maintain its identify as a self- contained record company, with Guenter Hensler continuing as president and chief executive officer. The Warner/PolyGram company will also succeed WEA International as the home video distributor in most countries outside the United States of the film libraries controlled by WCI. The music publishing interests of both parties — Warner Bros. Music and Chap- pell Music respectively — will not be a part of the proposed merger. Although a WCI spokesman would not single out any overriding factor in that com- pany’s decision to acquire a controlling (continued on page 30) PolyGram To Ship CDs At $11-$12 Wholesale by Michael Glynn LOS ANGELES — On Aug. 1, PolyGram Records will ship between 40,000 and 50,000 digital Compacts Discs (CDs) into its account base in Chicago, officially beginning its CD launch here in the U.S., according to Emiel Petrone, PolyGram vice president, marketing. West Coast, and U.S. Compact Disc coordinator. As previously announced, PolyGram is making available 100 CD titles from its Casablanca, Deutsche Grammophon, Mercury London, Philips, Polydor, RSO and Verve labels as part of the August debut (Cash Box, June 18). In a Cash Box Interview last week, Petrone revealed further details regarding PolyGram’s CD roll-out, such as wholesale pricing, packaging, merchandising, sales and distribution. Focusing first on the latter, he expanded on the plans for the establishment of 200 \"flagship” outlets across the country to preview PolyGram CD product. “We are presently in the process of talking to retailers through our sales (continued on page 13) the proposal are the replacement of WEA International by the new Warner/PolyGram outside the U.S., and the distribution of PolyGram here In the U.S. by WEA Dis- tribution Corp. PolyGram presently main- tains 10 sales offices around the country. and they are expected to be selectively ab- sorbed by WEA. There was also specula- tion that WEA would be moving out of Its present branch offices and into the more modern PolyGram warehouse facilities. It was not known how the proposed Motown Leaves Ranks Of Indies, Signs U.S. Distrib Pact With MCA LOS ANGELES — Following a swirl of speculation, Motown Records last week entered into a U.S. distribution deal with MCA Records Group. The deal, which takes the last of the major Independent labels to the branch system, was signed 1 a.m., Friday, July 1. Motown’s decision to go to branch dis- tribution — which effectively removes the last high-volume label from the ranks of the indies — follows on the heels of similar moves by Chrysalis (to CBS) and Arista (to RCA) and could be a devastating blow to the independent distributors. (The loss of the Chrysalis and Arista accounts was acknowledged as the final blow that caused the demise of the Pickwick in- dependent distribution operation.) No timetable was given for the actual switch from its independent distributors to MCA, nor were there any announcements on arrangements for returns. However, it is believed that Motown’s move to MCA’s (continued on page 30) MTV AT WORK — Columbia Records recently presented MTV executives with platinum albums in recognition for their help in breaking Men At Work and its debut LP, ‘‘Business As Usual.\" Pictured at the presentation are (l-r): John Sykes, director, promotion, MTV; Arma Andon, vice president, product development, Columbia Records; Gale Sparrow, director, programming, MTV; Bob Pittman, senior vice president, programming, MTV; Ray Anderson, vice president, Columbia label promotion; Les Garland, vice president, programming, MTV; Al Teller, senior vice president/general manager, Columbia; Paul Rappaport, director, national LP promotion, Columbia; Bob Sherwood, vice president, marketing, Columbia; and Mickey Eichner, vice president, national A&R, Columbia. I I NEV\\/ YORK — On the eve of the third quar- , ter, retailers contacted by Cash Box see a resurgence of Interest In recorded music fueled by such factors as strong hit ‘ product, exposure of new music via TV and 1^,. radio, a slack off in video games sales, the increasing availability of compact discs and a general upturn In the economy. And 1 while few dealers were willing to go out on a limb and declare that the music industry is at the brink of a full-fledged turnaround, all felt that the recent pickup In business goes ^ far beyond the mega-hit strength of a few L titles. I \"People are getting turned on again,” declared Howard Appelbaum, vice presi- dent of the Kemp Mill Records chain based ■>. in Beltsville, Md. He joined practically everyone in marvelling at the huge success of Michael Jackson’s ’’Thriller,’’ but also 1 noted that lesser hits were showing greater .1 strength than before. ‘“Thriller’ is the I biggest record ever for us, double the ir biggest one before. But even though the gap between that and our #2 record is big, when you look at the Top 20 for us, even #20 sells X amount plus 50% more from the #20 last year.” At Budget Tapes & Records headquar- ters in Denver, chain head Evan Lasky ob- served a significant change in the normal sales pattern where the top-selling album far outsold its immediate competition, and called it a good sign. “Interestingly enough, the difference between the #1, #2 and #3 is pretty big historically, but looJ< at the board: The Police and Def Leppard are tied. If we can have Def Leppard, which has been out a long time, doing as well as a new Police album, that’s a really healthy situation.” Lasky went on to note a fairly even spread in his list of top sellers between brand new releases like “Synchronicity” and Loverboy’s “Keep It Up,” and more mature fare such as “Thriller,” the Flashdance soundtrack, and ZZ Top’s “Eliminator.” “Those are the kind of things that mean unit sales are up,” said Lasky. “When you see the same #1 for 20 weeks, you know that unit sales are dropping. In an economy and price situation where you are dealing with single unit sales, a stagnant Top Five shows that people are coming in in smaller increments every week.\" Norman Hunter, buyer for the 146-store Record Bar chain, also noted a decreasing gap between the top-selling album and the one below it. In his chain’s case, the nearly 6,000 “Thriller’’s sold last week bettered Def Leppard’s “Pyromania” by only 95 pieces. “The current picture is definitely more than a one-record turnaround,” continued Hunter. “For example, the new Men At Work album dropped two spaces this week for us, but not because it’s slowing down, but because other records are speeding up.” Other merchants have witnessed a similar phenomenon. Bob Sturgess, who heads Coconuts T apes & Records stores in Jacksonville, Fla. and Atlanta, reported in- creased sales across the board. “There’s no rise in sales on our #1 or Top 10,” he said. “A lot more artists are being bought.” At Milwaukee’s Radio Doctors, however, (continued on page 26) Senate Approves Bill Regulating Record Rentals WASHINGTON, D.C. — Legislation giving copyright owners of audio recordings and underlying musical works the right to authorize commercial rentals was un- animously approved by the Senate June 28.

S-32, the Record Rental Amendment, was sponsored by Sen. Charles Mathias (R-Md.). Mathias is also the sponsor of a similar bill, still pending, which would revise the first sale doctrine for videocassettes and videodiscs.

The proceedings were organized by the charity Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy. Princess Michael of Kent presented this year’s Silver Clef award to Eric Clapton for out- standing achievement in the British music business. Previous holders of this award have Included Cliff Richard, Pink Floyd, The Who, Genesis, Elton John and The Rolling Stones. This year’s luncheon raised 35,000 pounds ($52,000). Bob Dickins, chairman of WEA Records U.K. was successful in his election to the new council of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Another new member representing the independent labels was Lain McNay, head of Cherry Red Records. McNay, who is calling for tighter control of chart hyping, told Cash Box: \"I want to see much heavier fines for hyping the charts. I think fines of 20,000 pounds ($30, 000) would be appropriate. I would also like to see the BPI made more attractive to independent labels. For instance, a lot of labels that are not members do not know they can get government grants for taking out a stand at MIDEM.” MMG PACTS CELLULOID FOR U.S. DISTRIBUTION — The Moss Music Group has signed an agreement with the French Celluloid label tor distribution here.

Steffen added that while A&M’s CDs will not carry a suggested list price, they are expected to be priced competitively with other manufacturers’ CD product. All A&M CD releases will have a special prefix to differentiate them from their vinyl, analog counterparts. It is also expected that A&M CD product will be packaged in the 6x12-inch configuration that has already been adopted by a number of other labels, including PolyGram and Warner Bros, ALBUM — Joan Jett and The Blackhearts — Blackheart/MCA MCA- 5437 — Producers: Richie Cordell and Kenny Laguna — List: 8.98 — Bar Coded Jett — in all her chunka-chunka, fuzz tone, three-chord rock glory — goes over familiar turf on her third solo album and first for MCA. First of all, there are the by- now-obligatory covers: a buzzing, monotone version of Sly Stone’s \"Ever- day People” and a Chuck Berryish run through Bobby Lewis’ 1961 hit, ’’Tossin’ & Turnin’.” Secondly, there’s feisty Joan’s own pouty rockers, sung In her inimitably raspy bark and given the ap- propriately “dirty” production touch by Messrs. Cordell and Laguna. Lotsa hard rock high points here: \"The French Song,” with its whispery verses and cranking axe; the Sex Plstols-meets- Scorpions ’’Had Enough” and the classic “Coney Island Whitefish,” with Jett howling “Scum bagi” throughout the chorus.

C’EST C BON — Carlene Carter — Epic BFE 38663 — Producer: Roger Bechirlan — List: None — Bar Coded Carlene Carter remains a wonderful puzzle on “C’Est C Bon.\" She never lost the throaty yet supple country quality she I gained in her early teen years singing gospel and bluegrass, yet she wraps that slightly twangy mezzo around modern pop arrangements here, courtesy of keyboar- dist/producer Roger Bechirlan (Elvis Costello, Squeeze, etc.). Bechirian’s band. Blanket of Secrecy, forms most of the I backing group and damned if what ap- pears to be a contradiction in styles turns out to be oddly seductive. “Meant It For A Minute” sounds like Carter’s husband Nick Lowe (even if she wrote it with partner and Noise To Go bassist James Eller), as does the sultry \"Don’t Give My Heart A Break” (which she did indeed write with Lowe and , Paul Carrack). But ‘Tm The Kind A Sugar Daddy Likes” has a light funkiness, “Third ' Time Charm\" is a synth pop ballad and “One Way Ticket” is a brassy pop/rocker. And that’s just to name a few. i EMOTION — DFX2 — MCA MCA-36000 Producers: Howard Steele, Jon Scott and Jim Blake — List: 6.98 — Bar Coded Southern California rock radio (par- , ticuiarly KROQ) listeners will remember the title track from “Emotion” as one of the ' last summer’s most heavily played in- ; dependent records.

It proved to be the ,1 springboard for the brothers Farage, , Douglas and David (hence DFX2), to this MCA mini LP debut. It’s basically garage rock with a nod to Mick dagger in Doug Farage vocals (check out “Something’s ■ Always Happening”).

A 55- year-old housewife from Daly City out- side of San Francisco, Queen Ida, along with her Bon Temps Zydeco Band, had gone from playing at private parties and dances to the stage of the Shrine (and later the US Festival) — all because she kept the music of her Louisiana heritage alive as a hobby while she raised her children. Her award-winning LP was entitled “Queen Ida And The Bon Temps Zydeco Band On Tour,” and the music was a unique blend of a variety of styles and influences from the bayou country of Louisiana. \"The roots of zydeco music come from the French- Canadian,” Ida explains, “Nova Scotia, to be exact. The music was brought into Louisiana by the Acadians (‘cajuns’) when they were forced into exile. “What we have done is take the basic cajun music and build from there. We’ve added a little rhythm & blues, a little Caribbean influence, a little reggae, some country & western, a little rock . . .” And the result has been an infectious brand of very lively, danceable music that defies categorization. The lead in- strument, after all, is Queen Ida’s accor- dion — something that she picked up as a child growing up in Lake Charles, La. “I’ve been playing professionally for about eight years now,” she explains, “but I’ve been around the music since my teens. Back then, though, it was more of a pastime, just something to do. “The music was passed from one generation to the next, and on and on. That’s how it’s kept alive up until now. We’re trying to update it a little — that transition from folk music to something a little more on the commercial side.” And by all accounts. Queen Ida has been very successful at that. She and the band have kept busy since the Grammys — with a European tour (“our best European audience is in Scan- dinavia, where they also have a long tradition of accordion music”) and an appearance at the country segment of the recent US Festival — and now a new LP, “Queen Ida And Her Zydeco Band In San Francisco,” her fifth for the GNP/Crescendo label, is ready for release. In addition, she and the band will ap- pear in the soon-to-be-released film Rumble Fish — a job they got while playing at a party that happened to be hosted by the film’s director, Francis Ford Coppola. “I have been kept so busy that I haven’t actually gotten together with myself on being a music ’star’ yet,” Ida remarks of everything that has hap- pened to her since the beginning of the year. “I’m still just out there. I’m really overjoyed, but I’ve been so busy that I just haven’t had a chance to sit down and have a cup of coffee and a cigarette and look at the Grammy and say, ’Wow! Here’s my Grammy.’” For now, though. Queen Ida and her Bon Temps Zydeco Band — consisting of her brother Wilbur on washboard, (the only member of the band with a Louisiana heritage like Ida), Peter Allen on fiddle and guitar, Dennis Galloway on bass guitar, Gregory Depew on drums and Douglas Drayson on guitar — will remain busy with more of the music that caused San Francisco Chronicle columnist Peter Levine to dub her “Queen Ida — Queen of the Mardi Gras” at the beginning of her career. Lights,” with his ex-wife, Linda Thompson, received much-deserved acclaim and set the stage for \"Hand Of Kindness.” Like that LP, “Hand...” reflects much of Thompson’s personal pain over the break-up of his marriage (listen to “A Poisoned Heart And A Twisted Memory”). But he can take a sad song and make it better ... or at least up- beat, as on the zydeco-like “Tear Stained Letter.” BLACK CONTEMPORARY LONDON STYLE — Bill Summers & Sum- mers Heat — MCA MCA-5432 — Producers: Bill Summers, Steve Roberts and others — List: 8.98 — Bar Coded The title of this LP is quite apt as Sum- mers & CO. take their always-energetic, “Jam The Box” style groove to another tex- tural plateau a la the techno-pop sound that has filled the transcontinental pipeline of late. In fact, one of the standout tracks on this wax is titled “Tech No Bop,” a highly syncopated dancer that combines the funk counterpoint Summers is known for with swirling, clicking and swooning electrical grooves. Other top tunes here include the high-tech romp “City Boy Lover,” the reggae/ska juiced “It’s Over,” the lilting ballad “London Town’’ and the Prince/Time-inflected \"Privacy.” LOVE STEW — Cherl — 21/PolyGram T1- 1-9005 — Producers: Geraldine Hunt and Peter Dowse — List: 8.98 Dance radio and club spinners will eat and gnaw at various slices from Cheri’s “Love Stew.” From the bittersweet, but successful, “Murphy’s Law” single of a year ago to “Working Girl,” the comely duo’s first single, Cheri is growing up and this LP should take them forward in leaps and bounds. In the hands of producers Geraldine Hunt and Peter Dowse, the sidemen lay down a red velvet, seamless carpet of syncopation and texture for these little darlings to traipse through several moods. In addition to “Working Girl,” the cynical “Small Town Lover” and new wavish title track should gain a lot of air- play.

West Coast rock ’n’ roll hasn’t exactly been in favor on radio since then, so what has he got to say? ”1 can’t keep up with what’s been going down/I think my heart just must be slowing down,” says Browne, and underscores his point with a thundering ’60s guitar.

The couple described are a pair of \"spoiled All- American kids” who get by on you-know- who’s dough. George’s cynicism does get balanced a bit in the beach guitar in- strumental section. BLACK CONTEMPORARY MARY JANE GIRLS (Gordy 1690 GF) All Night Long (3:55) (Stone City Music Company — ASCAP) (R. James) (Producer: R.

WAITNG — Fun Boy Three — Chrysalls/CBS B6V 41417 — Producer: David Byrne — List: 8.98 — Bar Coded Each song on this LP has a personality of its own. And under the cap- able production guidance of Talking Head David Byrne, who uses every- thing from pol- ka violin to bar- room piano to synth flou- rishes, each tune closes in on its potential. From the dance/rocky but ethereal cover of the Go-Go’s’ “Our Lips Are Sealed” to the European/folk melodies of “The Tun- nel Of love” the lyrical content remains in- sightful, to the forlorn tone of “The Things We Do.” Since this trio’s departure as the frontline of British 2-Tone group The Specials, these guys have been living up to their moniker. Music’s own \"Fonz” has already made his mark as back-up triller for Chic, Luther Vandross and Roxy Music, even lending his vocal presence to the latter’s recent tour, but Thornton comes into the forefront with this track off his debut solo RCA LP, \"The Leader.” His grace-with-strength vocal is given support, of course, with a well-arranged background chorus. With the track’s mid-tempo dance/urban/pop accent, his former employers may be given stiff competition. QUADRANT SIX (Atlantic/RFC 7-89800) The Lone Wolf (4:50) (Innocenti/Indulgent Music — BMI) (J. Robie) (Producer: J. Robie) “Planet Rock” co-producer John Robie is really on the prowl with this first-rate ef- fort for Q-6. A threatening keyboard figure is repeated throughout the song, while vocalist Kenny Simmons howls out the need to “feed my heart.” Other voices dart in and out, with a drum track and sax growl the only other musical parts. BERNARD EDWARDS (Atlantic 7-89803) Your Love Is Good To Me (3:56) (Chic Music, Inc. — BMI, admin. Warner- Tamerlane Publishing Corp.) (B. Edwards) (Producer: B. Edwards) The members of Chic are gracing us with their well-deserved solo efforts, and bassist Edwards’ outing is a smooth, lean funk track from a forthcoming LP, “Glad To Be Here.” The guitar riff recalls Skyy’s “Call Me” from last summer and thankfully manages to avoid the recycling of Chic’s own “Good Times,” which so many young bands seem to insist on. Edwards keeps it simple and lets the groove glide. 12-INCH SINGLES THE JONZUN CREW (Tommy Boy TB 834) We Are The Jonzun Crew (5:56) (T- Boy/Boston Int’l. — ASCAP) (M. Jonzun, M. Starr) (Producer: M.

Guaranteed to put a little bit of the Bronx in your living room. LEE PRENTISS (MSB 12-182) Love This Way (6:34) )Baby Raquel/Star- loft-Celestial — ASCAP) (M. Garvin) (Producers: M. & N. Garvin) Newcomer Lee Prentiss is sure to score heavy radio response with this hard-hitting dance track. Prentiss’ strong, youthful voice will doubtless draw com- parisons to Stephanie Mills and Evelyn King, and if “Love This Way” is any indica- tion, we’ll be hearing from Prentiss often. JULES SHEAR (EMI America P-B-8163) Whispering Your Name (3:43) (Funzalo Music Co./Juters Music Co. — BMI) (J. Shear) (Producer: T. Rundgren) Jules Shear’s Polar Bears were a clever pop-rock group that never were able to catch on with the main- stream. His solo single, aided by Rundgren’s shimmering production, has a better chance. The mel- ody and vocal start out dramatically like Orbison’s ’’Crying” before Rundgren splashes in the keyboards to strengthen the falsetto chorus.

Likewise, Shelly Rudin has made the sales department into one of the most respected in the business. All three have been crucial in bringing home the hits for PolyGram ar- tists, such as, most recently, Def Leppard, Dexys Midnight Runners and ABC, not to mention the Flashdance phenomenon. We look forward to many more fine achieve- ments from these very worthy people.” Bob Edson Shelly Rudin Cataldo Cash Box/July 9, 1983 9 TALENT ON SI4GE w hispers / Chi-Lites RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL, NYC — Solar/Elektra Records' Whispers did not disappoint a well-dressed SRO crowd that came ready to party up the group's return to the stage at one of New York's great showplaces. Their fine-tuned trademark harmonies, “Old-soul\" choreography, and crack back-up band led by horn player John Parrish took the stage with both fury and sensitivity. The show came complete with emcee Von West, who exhorted the audience in traditional R&B style while the band played a show-bizzy-yet-still funky introductory medley of hits. In its entirety the show's pacing was as balanced as the \"Dancin'/Romancin\"' format of recent LPs. Although the Whispers just celebrated their 20th anniversary in show business, the live set consisted of their most popular material since (and including) the com- eback success of 1979's \"And The Beat Goes On.\" While one may wonder what happened to early 1 970s vocal classics like “Bingo\" and \"Mother For My Children,\" the show never lacked for musical excitement. Fans were in an equal frenzy over dance numbers like the aforementioned “Beat\" and “It's A Love Thing\", and the sweet har- monies of ballads, including \"Say Yes\" and “Lady.\" The twins Walter and Wallace \"Scotty\" Scott acted as group leaders and were in control throughout the 70-minute performance. At one point they invited a woman up on stage to sing , and member Leaveil Degree was given the honors of choosing someone from the front row. Walter and Scotty traded lines in an im- pressive vocal duel for the invited guest's affections, and proved that beyond the clap machines and bank of keyboards the voices live on. There was dancing in the aisles, with a number of people rushing up on stage in the excitement. Added security was evi- dent and a change from last year's practice of couples being brought on stage to dance with the group. Nevertheless, It was a smooth, heartfelt love affair between the Whispers and the crowd. There were roses tossed into the first few rows at the close of the show, and each Whisper took the time to reach down and touch hands. Opening act The Chi-Lites re-kindled some memories with thrilling renditions of their classics including “Oh Girl,\" “Have You Seen Her\" and \"A Lonely Man.\" The drawback to hearing these chestnuts again was their relegation to an obligatory medley format. The three original Chi-Lites — Eugene Record, Marshall Thompson and Robert “Squirrel\" Lester — were in fine form, however, and could also sound as contemporary as they looked with a thum- ping version of theircurrentLARC hit, “Bad Motor Scooter.” harry weinger L acy J. Dalton THE LONE STAR CAFE, N.Y.C. — It's not often that a country singer, male or female, comes out on a club with Lacy J. Dalton's self-assurance and vitality and proceeds to merrily sing straight through, which is pretty much what she did before an appreciative Lone Star audience. The only interruptions came every now and then when she took a slug from the many beer bottles raised her way by fans at the front, and she did this with equal gusto. Then again, as the lyrics to her western swing song, “You Can't Take The Texas Out Of Me,\" state, she takes her Jack Daniels straight. None of this is meant to suggest that Dalton is little more than one hell of a honky tonk girl, though this was ably demonstrated with gutsy renditions of such big hits for her as “Wild Turkey,” in which she threw in a little kazoo accompaniment; her signature song “Hillbilly Girl With The Blues;” and first hit “Crazy Blue Eyes,” which she called the “bad girls” national anthem and said was about “tailing for those mavericks who don't settle down.” But other hit material like “Hard Times” and \"16th Avenue\" showed her range as both singer and songwriter. “Everybody Makes Mistakes,” which she wrote with her producer Billy Sherrill, was especially mov- ing. A lovely, poignant melody and state- ment to begin with, Dalton's clenched tremble, especially in the lower notes of her low range, fully brought out the very real character in her voice, a quality that is hard to come by in any type of music. One other noteworthy difference be- tween Dalton and too many other country acts is that she brings with her a very tight backup group. Her current Dalton Gang was as competent in supporting her on her current single and album title track, “Dream Baby,” the old Roy Orbison ballad, as it was on the hard-edged set-closing rocker, “Dixie Devil,” which Dalton wrote for Charlie Daniels. jim bessman zealous fan ripped it from the staff, then teetered along the narrow rim of the loge before dropping into the awaiting arms of the main floor audience. It was an exciting moment, to be sure, but it's doubtful whether the largely teenage crowd saw it as much more than a wild stunt, certainly not the act of trust that Bono intended it to be. In fact, it wasn’t the only time that the bond of trust that U2 sought to establish with its audience here was broken. As has become increasingly more common at punk and new wave shows, kids were con- tinually rushing onstage to show their af- fection for Bono and the group or merely to grab a few minutes in the spotlight. At times, Bono good naturedly played along, returning the kisses and hugs of a few girls or, in one case, hoisting one of the younger stage crashers aloft on his shoulders dur- ing a tune. Mostly, though, such antics were merely disruptive and distracting. During the mov- ing “Sunday Bloody Sunday,\" a song in- spired by Ireland’s internal strife, Bono halted the number after some knucklehead jumped in front of him and started flailing about. While U2 was visibly agitated by a few in- cidents, it handled the situation as well as could be expected and delivered a stunn- ing set, highlighted by “New Year’s Day,” “I Will Follow,\" “Gloria” and \"Seconds,” as well as “Sunday.” michael glynn L.A. SPORTS ARENA — During U2’s revelatory set at the US Festival less than a month prior to the Island recording group’s triumphant return appearance in Southern California, the intensely energetic lead singer Bono stated emphatically that the Irish quartet was “not an English fashion band.” If anyone in the Sports Arena audience needed a reminder, Bono again made the point clear when he said, “This is not Duran Duran.” Indeed, U2 is as far from the clump of preening synth pop bands overrunning America and Europe as you could possibly get while still falling under that all- encompassing label, “new music.\" Aside from the obvious musical differences (U2 does not resort to innocuous electronic noodlings and pre-programmed discoid rhythms), there is more earnestness and conviction in a single lyric from U2’s several uplifting anthems than in most of their contemporaries’ entire repertoire. That conviction is born of some deeply- held beliefs on the part of the group’s members (three of the four are avowed Christians). Yet U2 never preaches or proselytizes; religious commitment is more often than not expressed simply in terms of a life-affirming idealism, as opposed to the \"chic” cynicism that is more prevalent in punk and new wave. That may make U2 seem naive in the eyes of critical hipsters, but it’s precisely that positivism which gives the band’s music such undeniable force on record and in concert. At the Sports Arena, Bono, guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton, and drummer Larry Mullen put on a truly passionate per- formance, the sort that could only be pulled off by a band that honestly believes in the redeeming power of rock. Because it is still young, exuberance at times won out over the better judgment, particularly in the case of Bono’s grand, but nevertheless sin- cere, gestures. At the US Festival, the singer scaled the dangerously high stage rigging to wave the group’s trademark white flag of peace from the edge of the canopy. Here, he ran through the Arena’s second tier with the flag before an over- GREEK THEATRE, L.A. — Cpen air funk concerts have had their successes. The early Kool Jazz shows and the Budweiser SuperFests have been able to move large stadiums in a house party way. At the re- cent Greek Theatre appearance of two for- midable bands — Cameo and The Dazz Band — funk was in the air, but not nearly as many people had to be impressed. The outdoor venue seemed cavernous, as many of the 4,800 plus seats were con- spicuously empty. But Dazz and Cameo managed to fill the air with a professional, if not exuberant display of black pop musi- cianship. Headliner Cameo fared the best as it hit a tasteful but sparsely decorated stage with an energy level normally reserved for sold- out, screaming, foot-stomping audiences. But the Larry Blackmon-led, Atlanta-based group exhorted the audience to “Just Be Yourself,” let the hair down and not worry about sweating in the chilly night air. Cameo’s smart mixture of moonshine- barrel-funk and new rock whimsiness was a propelling force throughout the set, and the perpetual motion that has become the band’s trademark underscored its deter- mination to make the show a success. Blackmon, with core members Tomi Jenkins, Nathan Leftenant and Charlie Singleton are a galvinizing quartet that could very well lead Cameo into more ad- venturous bookings with arty rock bands using funk and R&B as a base of expres- sion. Even though the band can drop to the slow-dance floor with ballads like the current single, “I Can't Help Falling In Love With You,” it would undoubtedly be a plea- sant surprise among enterprising rock/pop fans. That is not to say that the Dazz Band, with its sophisticated rhythmic grooves, pierc- ing falsettos and gut-level lyrics, was not a good opener. But Dazz, more than Cameo, suffered from audience apathy as an open- ing act. Closing with the Grammy- nominated “Let It Whip,\" the group saved its best for last. michael martinez Supertramp Sets U.S., Canadian Tour Itinerary LOS ANGELES — A&M recording group Supertramp, which Is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, is preparing for a four-month, 56-date world tour taking it across Europe and North America.

Moss — which pioneered budget classical cassettes and handles the Danish Storyville jazz label here — makes its first move into street music with three Celluloid 12-inches by Fab 5 Freddy, Infinity and Grand Master D.St. and the Afrika Bambeataa-produced Time Zone. All are outstanding, and only serve to whet the appetite for other projects under the deal, which includes albums on the OAO label, an independent sister to Celluloid owned by Celluloid head Jean Karakos, New York manager Roger Trilling, recording engineer Martin Bisi and Material members Bill Laswell and Martin Beinhorn. First five albums from OAO are expected in the next two weeks and include titles by Massacre featuring Fred Frith, Fred Maher and Bill Laswell; The Golden Palominos with Anton Feir, Arto Lindsay, John Zorn, Mark Miller, David Moss and Jamaaladeen Tacuma; percussionist Daniel Ponce with Orlando Puntilla and Paquito D’RIvera; guitarist Derek Bailey with George Lewis and Zorn and violinist Billy Bang with a large ensemble con- ducted by Butch Morris and featuring David Murray, Charles Tyler, Sonny Murray and Wilbur Morris.

First Case Using Stronger Copyright Laws Cioses With 11 Convictions NEW YORK — “Operation Copy Cat,” the first tape piracy actions falling within the new increased penalties amendments to the Copyright Law, ended last week with the sentencing of Robert Earl Hill in Wilmington, N.C. to three years imprison- ment and a $9,000 fine for his conviction of criminal copyright infringement and traf- ficking in counterfeit labels for phonorecords. Hill became the 1 1th North Carolinian to be sentenced as a result of the undercover investigation jointly con- ducted by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina and the North Carolina Field Division of the FBI. The other 10 who were indicted with Hill on April 5 had been convicted and senten- ced previously within the past month. They are Julian Clark Tutt, of Kinston, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment for his conviction of criminal copyright in- fringement; Charles Edward Smith, of Monroe, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine for his conviction of criminal copyright infringe- ment; John L. Reed, of Gastonia, who was sentenced to six months imprisonment and three years probation for his convic- tion of criminal copyright infringement; Kenneth Wayne Rogers, of Wilmington, who was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence, four years of proba- tion and a $25,000 fine for his conviction of criminal copyright infringement; Sylvia Shaw Rogers, of Wilmington, who was sen- tenced to one year suspended sentence, two years of probation and a $15,000 fine for her conviction of criminal copyright in- fringement; Amanda Hill, of Kinston, who was sentenced to $1,000 fine and three years of probation including 10 hours a month in community service for her convic- tion of criminal copyright infringement; Robin Rogers, of Kinston, who was senten- ced to one year of probation including 10 hours a month in community service for her conviction of criminal copyright infring- ment; Robin Stroud, of Kinston, who was sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation for his conviction of criminal copyright infringement: Vallen Wright, of Franklin, who was sentenced to probation and a $3,000 fine for his convic- tion of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement; and Johnny Stroud, of Kinston, who was sentenced to one year of probation including 10 hours a month in community service for his convic- tion of aiding and abetting criminal copyright infringement. All of the defen- dants pleaded guilty to felony counts ex- cept for Amanda Hill, Robin Rogers and Johnny Stroud, who pleaded guilty to mis- demeanor counts. The anti-piracy operation climaxed with raids on five locations in the Kinston area on June 29, 1982 and an additional on Oct. 22, 1982. The June 29 raids were on three premises and one vehicle owned or con- trolled by Robert Earl Hill and one location owned by T utt, and netted vast quantities of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, masters, finished product and business records involved in the reproduction and distribution of alleged counterfeit and pirate 8-tracks, cassettes and videocas- settes. Lots, Of Contraband The Oct. 22 raid at the premises of Ken- neth Wayne Rogers and Sylvia Shaw Rogers took in approximately 4,477 audio cassettes, 463 reel-to-reel tapes and 489 video cassettes, which were identified as being used as masters for duplication pur- poses. Wayne Rogers had reportedly operated a record and cassette mail order company for over nine years, during which time he mailed allegedly bootleg product throughout the U.S. and abroad. Under the new Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1982, which was signed by President Reagan on May 24, 1982, sound recording, motion picture and audiovisual pirates and counterfeiters can be sentenced for up to five years Imprison- ment and/or fines up to $250,000, Samuel T. Currin, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, hoped that the sentences in “Operation Copy Cat” would have a deterrent effect on future piracy ac- tivities. “I am pleased that we could bring the first prosecution under the Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act of 1982 in the Eastern District of North Carolina, where sound recording piracy has been a serious problem,\" he said. )ash Box/July 9, 1983 11 Mil :>J} LBU^ xl TOP 30 Zl LBUMS o o 0 O 12 13 14 15 0 Weeks On 7/2 Chari IN YOUR EYES GEORGE BENSON (Warner Bros. 9 23744-1) 1 4 TRAVELS PAT METHENY GROUP (ECM 23791-1) 2 4 JARREAU (Warner Bros. 9 23801-1) 3 13 THE GENIE THEMES & VARIATIONS FROM THE TV SERIES \"TAXI\" BOB JAMES (Columbia FC 38678) 4 6 LOW RIDE EARL KLUGH (Capitol ST-12253) 5 11 STAR PEOPLE MILES DAVIS (Columbia FC 38657) 6 8 FRIENDS LARRY CARLTON (Warner Bros. 9 23834-1) 7 6 THE HUNTER JOE SAMPLE (MCA 5397) 8 13 MIRAGE A TROIS THE YELLOW JACKETS (Warner Bros. 9 23813-1) 10 8 JOURNEY TO A RAINBOW CHUCK MANGIONE (Columbia FC 38686) 13 4 THINK OF ONE . . .

With half of the fest down, two standout shows have already been notched: Miles Davis, and \"A Salute to Coleman Hawkins.” Davis, always musically unpredictable, managed to throw another wrench in the works by coming out sans sidemen Tom Barney (bass) and Mike Stern (guitar), who have both departed the band. Handling a sizable chunk of thesolospace was guitarist John Scofield, although Davis was the one carrying the band this time. Lengthy solos and a clear, precise tone marked Davis' performance throughout the hour-long set . . . Special kudos also go to a non-musician, jazz historian Ira Gitler, for a stunning and invigorating tribute to tenor great Coleman Hawkins. Having organized and co-produced a salute to Lester Young last year, Gitler trained his eye on the Hawk this time out and came up with another winner. Highlights of the show included a re- working of Fletcher Henderson tunes with Hawkins’ solos orchestrated for a sax section by Budd Johnson; a robust \"Woody 'N You” featuring Dizzy Gillespie, and an hour-long tenor spotlight featuring Zoot Sims, lilinois Jacquet, Big Nick Nicholas and Hal “Cornbread” Singer. Also on hand were Benny Carter, Eddie Barefieid, Barry Harris, Tommy Flanagan, Major Holly and Lawrence Lucie. All in ail, a spectacular evening. INDIE ROUND-UP — New York’s Muse label has a new title that’s a must for fans of blues shouter Big Joe Turner, The disc, “Blues Train,” features Turner with Roomful of Blues. Special guest Dr. John puts in an appearance on piano on a rework of \"I Want A Little Girl.” Also out on Muse are “Starclimber” by keyboardist Mitch Farber with Randy Brecker, Steve Khan, Mark Egan, Danny Gotttieb, Gary Campbell and Sammy Figueroa; and \"Yet To Come” by guitarist Line Chamberland with bassist David Frieson and drummer Gary Hobbs . . . Out on Fantasy, which will soon bow its next batch of Original Jazz Classics, are one title each on Fantasy, Prestige and Milestone. From Milestone comes “Encores” by guitarist Wes Montgomery, a collec- tion of eight alternate takes, three of them previously unreleased and all recorded in the '60s. The Prestige addition is “Satin Doll” by pianist extraordinaire Red Garland, featuring two unissued trio sessions from '59 with drummer Specs Wright and bassists Doug Watkins and Jimmy Rowser; while the Fantasy title is “A Little Night Music” by Freddie Hubbard and the outstanding quintet of saxophonist Joe Henderson, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, pianist Billy Childs, bassist Larry Klein and drummer (continued on page 30) SIDRAN IN BOP CITY — Antilles recording artist Ben Sidran (r) recently completed his next album for the label, en- titled “Bop City.\" Sidran is pictured with two of the disc's sidemen, saxophonist Phi!

Sam Moore: Return Of A Soul Man From Obscurity, Drugs by Michael Martinez LOS ANGELES — “I had almost given up — I was just living from day to day,” recalls Sam Moore, from the original Sam & Dave R&B duo, of his bout with drug addiction that lasted more than a decade. “I didn’t care that much about performing, but I’d get numb enough to go on stage to get money to get some more of the stuff.” For the last few years, Moore has been concentrating his energies on revitalizing his health rather than rejuvenating his career, which has languished since the final split with long-time partner Dave Prater in the mid-’70s. Having tried a spectrum of treatment for his drug problem which plagued him since the height of his career with the then major, now classic “Soul Man” single, it wasn’t un- til November 1981 that Moore began his trek back through detoxification. What cold turkey, methadone and other chemical treatments failed to do. Naltrexone, a little- known drug that is essentially experimen- tal, started a nearly two-year process of detoxification. The non-addictive drug blocks the ef- fects of all opiate drugs and, unlike methodone, does not have the nauseating side effects. Those who have been on opiate drugs like heroin, morphine or codeine, and even cocaine, before starting treatment must go through a seven-day detoxification period using either Darvon- N or Clonidine. “I take care of myself now,” Moore said. “I eat well and have gone from 120 lbs. to 200 lbs. and now I’m down to about 183. “I exercise every day,” he continued, “and now I have a chance for recommit- ment to my craft.” But work, in Moore’s words, “has been all too infrequent,” and his trip back to the studio has been one fraught with obstacles. Partner Dave is back on the road with another Sam and has been playing R&B clubs nationwide under the old Sam & Dave moniker, thus his bookings have been sparse. Another factor is the addict image that he is now trying to shed. “A lot of people Sam Moore were surprised to discover I had a habit,” Moore recounts, noting that “word of mouth in the industry became a powerful weapon against me. But you think you’ll be there (on top) all your life.” Looking back on that perspective, Moore’s voice became distant as he reflec- ted on years of small club gigging leading to iittle gain and a growing rift between himself and partner Dave. After recording a string of hits for Roulette, Stax and later Atlantic Records through the late ’50s to the late ’60s, in- cluding “You Don’t Know Like I Know,” “I Take What i Want,” “Hold On I'm Coming,” “Soul Man” and \"When Something Is Wrong With My Baby,” the duo hit a drought, creatively and commercially, leading to the first break-up. “It vjas during that slow period, which scared me to death,” Moore said, “that I realized how easy it was to be vulnerable in this business. “I started getting numb on alcohol and drugs,” he continued. \"I wanted to be ac- cepted by fans and the industry. Just to be with the boys.” And although Moore joined Prater for a second incarnation of the Sam & Dave duo in 1971, the thrill was gone and the vocal magic that had made them soul men legends was a figment of history.

PolyGram to Ship 40,000-50,000 CDs In Launch, Sets $11.75-12.75 Wholesale (continued from page 5) organization to find the outlets among the various chains in the major markets which have the highest store traffic and the most affluent customers,” said Petrone. \"Those will be our ‘flagship stores’ ... In many cases, we’ll have a number of flagship stores in certain cities, such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. For instance, in L.A., we’d have a Tower (store), a Licorice Pizza, a Music Plus, and a Wherehouse. We’re in touch with the Russ Solomons and Lou Fogelmans to determine which locations would be best suited and we’re looking to have those 'flagship stores’ set by the third week of August.” Due to PolyGram’s initially limited supply of CDs for the U.S. (in spite of anticipated production of five million discs at its Hanover, West Germany plant this year), Petrone noted, ”We won’t have the Compact Disc available to racks or one- stops in the beginning. However, limited supply isn’t the only reason. “Approximately 1.5 million Compact Discs will be produced for the U.S. market,” Petrone explained, “but that number may change according to such factors as demand and the number of players produced ... A lot hinges on the coordination between the hardware and software manufacturers. We realize this, which is why we’re going through ‘flagship’ dealers in the roll-out. They’ll be able to most effectively cross-promote and cross- merchandise software and hardware . . . We’re strongly urging that these 200 stores work closely with hardware dealers in their market.” He added that the job of “effecting this relationship between CD software and hardware manufactures” falls upon the recently-formed Compact Disc Group, under Recording industry Assn, of America (RIAA) vice president and executive director Stephen Traiman, who is presently functioning as CDG coor- dinator (Cash Box, June 18). As PolyGram’s senior director. Compact Disc Project, Hans Gout indicated during the launch announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, “flagship stores” will be supplied with an array of point of purchase materials. Among these will be silk banners, posters and a nine-minute audio/visual presentation, providing a description of the digital process and a brief overview of available PolyGram titles. Petrone pointed out that \"PolyGram branches in 14 major cities will be equipped with the a/v presentation.” PolyGram will be packaging its CD titles in a 6x1 2-inch clear plastic, heat-sealed container, which Petrone said would be color-coded by label. The clear pack will allow customers to see the opened jewel box, which serves as the permanent hous- ing for the disc, in addition to a hand- colored illustration, information about the recording and a two-color, generic message summarizing the digital CD technology. “The 6x12 clear plastic packaging, we believe, has a number of advantages,” Petrone stated, holding up a sample. “First, it allows the consumer to see the disc itself, which is attractive and sexy-looking in itself. Second, the 6x12 size tells the dealer he doesn’t have to put under lock and key; two units fit comfortably side by side in existing racks ... Or Individual racks or display modules can be created by the retailer to fit the layout of the store. It’s pretty versatile.” Packaging had been the subject of controversy and debate among manufacturers and retailers some months ago, but it was generally resolved that a 6x12-inch configuration should be the industry standard. \"We had to be sensitive to the middle retailer who wants something pilfer-proof, that would fit into established fixtures,” Petrone explained. “Each of the packages, (from the various labels) will be different.’ For example, we’ve got a plastic pack, while Warner Bros, is utilizing a paper box. However, the size will be standard.” Previously, PolyGram projected that the consumer price range for the CD in the U.S. would be between $17 and $20. Petrone stated that this was based on an anticipated markup of $5 to $7 over PolyGram’s wholesale price of $11.75 for contemporary pop and rock titles and $12.75 for classical recordings. (Eighty of PolyGram’s initial 100 CD titles are classic, which means that the bulk of PolyGram’s premiere Compact Discs will be wholesale priced at $12.75.) Looking toward the future, Petrone concluded, \"Hopefully, by mid-'84, we will simultaneously release albums in the CD, LP and cassette configurations. Quite a bit depends on the number of players sold but we remain very optimistic. By the end of 1983, 650,000 players are expected to be sold just in Europe and Japan ... In the U.S., we’re looking at sales of between 50,000 and 100,000 players by the end of this year. WEA, CBS, A&M and others will all have CD product out this year, totaling approximately 450 titles, 200 of which will be PolyGram. “The Compact Disc Group is talking about exhibits for the Winter CES in Las Vegas and generic merchandising materials for the CD and the CDG will be meeting in August and October to plan those and other things. Everyone has been very responsive. Now we’re actually moving into gear.” y TOP 30 IXIDEOOlSSEnES Weeks On 7/2 Chart 1 48 HOURS Paramount 1139 2 FIRST BLOOD Thorn EMI 1573 3"
