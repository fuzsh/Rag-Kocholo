Plaintiff claimed she was startled, shocked and overwhelmed by a full-length photograph along the steps of the actor portraying “Dexter” with a shocked expression. She became panicked, lost her balance and fell down the steps from the “shockvertisement.” Plaintiff alleged claims for intentionally and negligently Justice creating and placing a tripping and falling hazard Shlomo Hagler in a common walkway causing a dangerous condi- Supreme Court tion for pedestrians. Defendants argued plaintiff’s reaction was an unforeseeable act that did not impose liability on them claiming an action based on fear induced by an advertisement was not cognizable in NY. The court found no evidence Showtime or CBS owed plaintiff a duty of care, noting neither owned or managed the subway stairwell or made special use of it. There was no evidence defendants caused, created or had notice of a dangerous condition as plaintiff admitted it was only her reaction to the advertisement that caused her fall. Defendants were granted dismissal.\n\nowell was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, and DWI, among other things. She was stopped for traffic violations, and the odor of alcohol was detected. Powell stated she did not have anything to drink, but took “... Xanax.” After failing field sobriety tests and refusing a breath test, she was arrested and marijuana and cannabis oil were seized. She was given DWI warnings, stating she wished to speak with a lawyer and given her phone call. Powell was warned again, but Judge refused the test. She argued there was no probable John Reilly cause to arrest her, moving to suppress her refusal City Court to take a chemical test arguing her right to counsel was violated. The court stated trooper’s observation Powell committed traffic violations provided a basis to stop her car, noting he reasonably may have concluded Powell drove her car under the influence. Also, as Powell’s statements were made in response to an investigatory query, Miranda warnings were not required. The court also found Powell’s right to counsel was not violated. Adequate warnings for refusal to submit to a chemical test were given, but Powell persistently refused. Suppression was denied.\n\nNjewadda v. Showtime Networks, 450301/15 (Jan. 29)\n\nlaintiff sued for a declaration he had an easement by prescriptive right, and right-of-way from his parcel to its joinder with County Route 31 via a private drive--Blodgett Road--proceeding through land belonging to defendants. 3 Princesses and A P Trust (3P) and Camp Red Fox Trust moved, but was denied a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to join necessary party Whiteface Resort Holdings. 3P conveyed its property to Guin as trustee of Theanogran Realty Trust (TRT), and WRH was Justice joined as a defendant. A stipulation purporting to Robert Muller join TRT as a defendant was allegedly signed by Supreme Court counsel, but was never filed. 3P moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to join TRT as a defendant. It was undisputed TRT was a necessary party, but while 3P argued the complaint must be dismissed due to plaintiff’s delay in joining TRT, same was found meritless. The court stated TRT was subject to the court’s jurisdiction and should be joined, despite delay on plaintiff’s part, noting no prejudice was alleged from plaintiff’s delay in joining TRT. Dismissal was denied, and plaintiff was entitled to amend the complaint to add TRT as a defendant. McCutchen v. 3 Princesses and A P Trust, 15-1-2014-0159 (Feb. 6)\n\nPeople v. Powell, 17-245892 (Feb. 8)\n\nSullivan | Criminal Law\n\nMonroe | Criminal Law\n\nWayne | Discovery\n\nCounts 11-14 in State Indictment Not Barred By State, Federal Double Jeopardy Protections\n\nCourt Finds Defendant’s Justification Defense Meritless, Finds Him Guilty as Charged\n\nPlaintiff Compelled to Respond to Disclosure Demands Related to Staffing Projects\n\nW\n\nK\n\nS\n\natson moved to dismiss an indictment charging him with robbery, among other things. Prosecutors declined to file opposition, stating a determination of the merits would be left to the court’s discretion. Watson was removed to federal custody and pleaded guilty to 17 charges in the Federal Information (FI), and moved to dismiss the underlying State Indicment (SI) arguing it was barred on double jeopardy grounds. The court noted counts one through 10, including robbery Judge and burglary, in the SI were barred by double jeop- Frank LaBuda ardy from his guilty pleas in the FI, but counts 11 County Court through 14--reckless endangerment, assault and unlawfully fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle--were not mentioned nor charged in the FI. The court stated each of the charges in the FI contained an element that was not an element of any charges in counts 11-14 in the SI as they required proof of physical injury to an officer, among other things. It ruled state prosecution of Watson on counts 11-14 of the SI were not barred by federal or state double jeopardy protections as they fell under CPL §40.20(2)(b) exception and People may proceed with prosecuting Watson on such counts.\n\nurlak was charged with disobeying a traffic control device. He was arraigned and advised of his rights to a trial and to obtain a supporting deposition--he requested same. The supporting deposition indicated an officer observed Kurlak driving approximately 50mph--confirmed by a radar at 53mp--in a 35mph zone. Kurlak testified on his own behalf and did not deny exceeding the speed limit, nor contest the speed attested to by the officer, but raised a justification defense. He claimed Town Justice before being stopped by the officer, a deer jumped Thomas DiSalvo over the hood of his car without touching it, but Town Justice Court he noticed a group of four more deer and sped up to get past them before they darted across the road in the vicinity of his car. On cross-exam, Kurlak stated he did not advise the officer his reason for speeding. The court stated it was difficult to conclude Kurlak had no other choice but to speed up beyond 35mph, finding People presented credible evidence at trial that was legally sufficient, established every element of the offense charged and Kurlack’s commission of it. It found Kurlack’s justification defense meritless, finding him guilty as charged.\n\nPeople v. Watson, 87-2018 (Feb. 8)\n\nPeople v. Kurlak, 18090082 (Feb. 4)\n\nodus Central School District (SCSD) moved to compel plaintiff to respond to discovery demands; the remaining issue was the merit of plaintiff’s objection to SCSD’s demand to produce certain records plaintiff believed were “totally unrelated” to the litigation. Plaintiff was contracted to perform electrical work for SCSD. Work was not substantially completed by a date specified. Plaintiff alleged SCSD unilaterally repudiated the contract by excluding it from the worksite and declaring Justice remaining work was to be performed by others. John Nesbitt It alleged claims including contract breach. SCSD Supreme Court demanded production of all other construction contracts plaintiff was performing at the time it was performing its contract with SCSD--seeking a list of each project, and summaries of the nature and scope. The court concluded disclosure on staffing was relevant to delay damages claims and if plaintiff was overextended due to other ongoing projects, thus, understaffed the SCSD project. Yet, the scope of SCSD’s demands went beyond what may be relevant to establishing such defense, compelling plaintiff to respond to demands regarding project records where staffing was a subject. Eastcoast Elec. v. Sodus Cent. Sch. Dist., 79814 (Feb. 5)\n\nSecond Circuit | Criminal Law\n\nU.S. - SDNY | Contractual Disputes\n\nU.S. - SDNY | Transportation\n\nCourt Erred as to State Recidivist DWAI Offender Conviction; Amended Restitution Upheld\n\nAgreements’ Breach Plausibly Stated; Implied Covenant Claim Restated Breach Claim\n\nTaiwan Not Bound by Montreal Convention; Issue Exits If GE Was Party to Global Contract\n\nA\n\nA\n\nG\n\nfter pleading guilty to securities and mail fraud, and obstructing the Internal Revenue laws Valente was sentenced concurrently to 240 months in prison on the fraud counts, and 36 months on the Internal Revenue count. He was also ordered to pay $8.2 million in restitution. In July 2017, after remand, district court resentenced him to the same terms, and increased restitution to $8,616,113.39. Second Circuit partly vacated, and remanded, district court’s sentence of incar- Circuit Judge ceration as procedurally unreasonable due to an Christopher incorrect criminal history finding. However, the Droney circuit affirmed the court’s amended restitution U.S. Court of order. While rejecting Valente’s claim that district Appeals court erred when assigning criminal history points for a prior state misdemeanor conviction of failing to use a vehicle with an interlock device, Second Circuit held the court erred in determining that Valente’s state court conviction for being a recidivist DWAI offender merited the assignment of two criminal history points under U.S. Sentencing Guideline §4A1.1(b) based on the plain language of Application Note 12 to §4A1.2.\n\nlessi Equipment Inc. (AEI) sells and services hydraulic attachments for excavators. With its assistance, American Piledriving Equipment Inc. (APEI) began developing excavator-mounted equipment. Their agreements in 1996, 2004, and 2012 concerned the sale of APEI’s “Robovib” attachment designed to drive and extract sheet piles and beams. Among other things, under their three agreements, AEI acted as APEI’s exclusive supplier in the northeast United States. APEI’s May 2017 District Judge sale of $163,000 worth of equipment without AEI’s Vincent Briccetti involvement, and similar sales, allegedly breached Southern District the parties’ three agreements. Despite dismissing AEI’s claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, accounting, and specific performance, district court held AEI plausibly stated a contract breach claim based on the three agreements for the sale and distribution of APEI’s excavator-mounted equipment. However, its claim for breach of the implied covenant merely restated its contract breach claim, and no fiduciary relationship between the parties was alleged.\n\nE Aviation Materials LP’s (GE) jet engine was damaged during transport, by China Airlines Inc., from Florida to Taiwan. Transportation was arranged by Expeditors International. Deliveree Evergreen Aviation Technologies billed GE $176,066.57 for repairs due to the engine’s incorrect tie-down. GE’s subrogee Indemnity sued Expeditors and China Airlines under the Montreal Convention for contract breach, breach of bailment obligations, and negligence. District court denied both par- District Judge ties summary judgment. Discussing Mingtai Fire J. Paul Oetken & Marine Ins. Co. v. United Parcel Serv. it found Southern District Taiwan not bound by the Montreal Convention. There was also a genuine dispute whether GE was a party to a Global Air Freight Transportation Contract, and whether that contract independently applied to all shipments by Expeditors on GE’s behalf. Unable to review the entirety of China Airline’s contract of carriage in force at the time of shipment, the court could not conclude that China Airlines was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim that its Conditions of Carriage governed the parties’ dispute.\n\nAlessi Equip.

On Oct. 3 ESG terminated him because a background check revealed open criminal charges preventing his work at NYPH. Garcia claimed the charges were dismissed. Claiming ESG violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to provide him with a copy of his credit report sufficiently in advance of taking District Judge adverse employment action based on that report, William Pauley Garcia sought certification of a class of employees Southern District and prospective employees of ESG who were the subject of a consumer credit report and against who ESG took adverse employment action based on information therein. The court denied ESG’s motion to dismiss or strike Garcia’s class claims, and Garcia’s motion for reasonable attorney’s fees as sanctions under 28 USC §1927. ESG did not show the unsuitability of class treatment, and its assertions as to the lack of numerosity, typicality, and adequate representation were based only on its own view of the merits of class certification.\n\nnsurer Indian Harbor sought a declaration authorizing it to disclaim defense and indemnity coverage to insureds Knockdown Contracting Inc. and MAJ Constr. Inc. based on Knockdown’s failure to cooperate with it in defending Knockdown in Columbia Hick’s Associates LLC’s lawsuit seeking indemnity from Knockdown related to a bodily injury action by Rivera against Knockdown. On competing cross-motions district court denied Indian Harbor, and granted Columbia Hicks, sum- District Judge mary judgment. Noting the three elements to be Carol Bagley Amon shown in order to disclaim coverage based on an Eastern District insured’s lack of cooperation, the court found the record insufficient to support a reasonable inference that Knockdown’s attitude after its cooperation was sought was one of “willful and avowed obstruction.” Beyond Knockdown’s inaction, Indian Harbor did not present evidence supporting the reasonable inference that the Jorge Santiago its investigator located was Knockdown’s principal, or that the investigator advised Santiago of the lawsuit against Knockdown, or advised Santiago that Indian Harbor sought his cooperation with the lawsuit.\n\nLawjobs.com Advantage The Lawjobs.com global network reaches attorneys, paralegals, business development executives, and legal professionals thousands of times a day, including 99% of the NLJ 250.\n\nExperience the new Lawjobs.com today.\n\nWhen results matter\n\nGarcia v.
