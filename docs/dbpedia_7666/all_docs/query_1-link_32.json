We also promote awareness of rare diseases among physicians and other medical professionals.\n\nWe pioneered Patient Assistance Programs in 1987. Today, NORD programs include free drug, co-pay and premium assistance, travel/lodging assistance for clinical trials, expanded or emergency access, and more.\n\nDisease-specific patient organizations are crucial partners in our mission to serve rare disease patients and their families. Thatâ€™s why we provide capacity building and mentorship services to start-up and established organizations.\n\nOur grant programs have resulted in numerous published advances and at least two FDA-approved therapies.\n\nNORD believes in the power of collaboration. It is the foundation upon which NORD was built. NORD works with partners in the patient community, government, academia, and industry who share the ultimate goal of identifying, treating, and curing rare diseases. In addition to the partnerships listed below, NORD works with many national partners to achieve its advocacy goals."
