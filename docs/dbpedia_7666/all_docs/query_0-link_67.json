It aims to explore the emergence and consequences of concepts used to define “Latin America” while at the same time exploring the broad interplay of political, economic, and cultural practices that have shaped Latin American worlds. Latin America, at the crossroads of competing imperial designs and local responses, has been construed as a geocultural and geopolitical entity since the nineteenth century. This series provides a starting point to redefine Latin America as a configuration of political, linguistic, cultural, and economic intersections that demands a continuous reappraisal of the role of the Americas in history, and of the ongoing process of globalization and the relocation of people and cultures that have characterized Latin America’s experience. Latin America Otherwise: Languages, Empires, Nations is a forum that confronts\n\nƒ\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\n\nestablished geocultural constructions, rethinks area studies and disciplinary boundaries, assesses convictions of the academy and of public policy, and correspondingly demands that the practices through which we produce knowledge and understanding about and from Latin America be subject to rigorous and critical scrutiny. “El pueblo” is a concept commonly heard in discussions about Latin America and Latin American history; however, its complex meanings, multiple referents, bumpy transformations—and the distinctive social practices carried out in its name—have not been scrutinized. Paul K. Eiss’s exceptional contribution, with its focus on Northern Yucatn, is to show how much we have missed by not taking “el pueblo’s” distinctive, disputed, evolving, and interpenetrating meanings into account. To do justice to “el pueblo” requires taking its history seriously as well. Struggles to appropriate its banner incorporated a surprising range of social actors. Indigenous Maya, nonindigenous town dwellers, landowners, priests, merchants, and teachers commandeered “el pueblo” for political, economic, and ideological ends. “El pueblo’s” reach extended from village to nation, and from the colonial period into the twenty-first century. In the Name of El Pueblo is testimony to its impact and to its importance.\n\nƒ\n\nA ckn o w l ed g ments\n\none hot day in October 1995 I sat on the ground by a deer carcass, off in the woods somewhere near the Yucatecan pueblo of Tetiz. After a day of tagging along with a hunting party as it pushed through the brush in one-hundred-degree heat, I was covered with dirt, twigs, and small ticks. Another man and I had each been given a trussed deer to carry back to camp in a way working people of the region practice with heavy loads from childhood: hoisted onto the back, with a rope running from the carcass over the forehead and hands. The first couple of times I tried to get the animal on my shoulders, it flopped around and threw me off balance, knocking me over. Finally, I hoisted it up and staggered forward, the coarse, brutal cord abrading my hands and forehead. I made it about one hundred feet before the deer shifted again, snapping my neck back and pulling me down, one last time, atop the carcass. While I\n\nxii\n\nƒ\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nstruggled to get up, my companion continued on his way. “I’ll send help,” he said, leaving me to scribble field notes and take a few photographs to distract myself from my embarrassment. About an hour later, help arrived in the form of a short old man who picked up the deer like it was a bag of feathers, strapped it to his head, and trotted off toward camp. Soon we reached the other men as they rested, pouring hot water over themselves to clean off the dirt and dislodge ticks. Even before my ignominious return, the story of my “dance” with the deer carcass had begun to spread. On arrival, I went with it, reenacting my writhing fall several times, to general mirth. Over the days to come, the story of my pathetic dance began to circulate, and when it is retold, seemingly whenever I return to visit Tetiz, it still, more than a decade later, provokes laughter. I have long struggled under the burden of this book, and if I have succeeded in carrying it or even dancing with it—however clumsily—it is only thanks to the assistance, encouragement, and inspiration of others, most notably the inhabitants of the towns, pueblos, and ex-haciendas of the Hunucm region. In Tetiz, first the late Don Javiel Sosa Chim and then Doa Dulce Mara Sosa opened their houses to me. Over the course of my many visits from the early 1990s forward they and their families treated me as a friend and eventually as a family member. Don Alfredo Quintal and Don Alejandro Tzuc invited me to join their gremios, or guilds, and taught me much about gremios, hunting, and many other things. On Hacienda Nohuayum, the families of Don Honorio Poot Quintal and Don Leonardo Poot Chuc also welcomed me into their households and, like so many others there and in Tetiz, encouraged my efforts at learning Yucatec Maya by indulging me in impromptu lessons and long hours of conversation. Frequent visits and conversations with Don Dionisio, Pedro, and Julio Chim as well as Don Roque Chuc and Doa Tomasa Chuc also provided a wealth of insights into many things, from labor to hunting to religion and especially to the historical memories of what residents call the times of slavery and the times of liberty. In the town of Hunucm, the teacher and poet Anacleto Cetina Aguilar shared his expertise on the history of that town in a memorable series of discussions. In too many ways to recount, the people I encountered during my fieldwork in western Yucatn shared their wisdom with me. Even if most cannot be enumerated here—to protect identities, I generally assign them the names of animals and plants similar to those I have heard used as nicknames according to local custom—I thank them for inspiring every stage of the writing of this book, from conception to completion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n%\n\nxiii\n\nWhile I conducted the bulk of my fieldwork in places like Tetiz, much of my time in Yucatn was spent in the state capital, Mrida, where I conducted archival research. I worked most extensively in the Archivo General del Estado de Yucatn, which has profited immeasurably from the dedicated work of Dr. Piedad Peniche Rivero and of other archival personnel, including Armando Chi, Mauricio Dzul Snchez, Candy Flota Garca, and Andrea Vergoda Medina. I also relied heavily on the extensive newspaper and archival holdings of the Centro de Apoyo a la Investigacin Histrica de Yucatn and am grateful to its director, Jorge Canto Alcocer, as well as to Patricia Martnez Huchim and other personnel for their assistance. I consulted the invaluable Yucatecan newspaper collection of the Biblioteca Menndez and the photography archives of the Fototeca Pedro Guerra. I am indebted to Yucatn’s office of the Secretara de la Reforma Agraria for allowing me access to their documents and especially to Angelina Acosta Esquivel for her guidance there. Alejandra Garca Quintanilla of the Centro de Investigaciones Regionales “Dr. Hideo Noguchi” of the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn provided assistance, friendship, and stimulating conversations about Yucatecan history and culture. Outside the archives, my friends Mercedes Can Castilla, Edwin Carrillo, Lil Fernndez Souza, Alberto Gamboa, Susy Peniche, Carlos Rendn, and Doa Candita Souza de Fernndez made living in Mrida a pleasure, even as they helped me to adapt to living in Yucatn and to understand the complexities of Mexican history and contemporary politics. Above all, from the moment I set foot in Yucatn, Carlos Encalada Gonzlez proved a friend and teacher without equal. To him I owe my command of the Spanish language, many of my friendships and contacts with other Mrida residents, and sincere gratitude for a decade of hospitality, as he invited me to stay at his home for long periods over the course of repeated visits. This project would have been impossible to conceive, much less complete, had I not benefited from the scholarship and direct encouragement of several scholars of Yucatn. The work of Gil Joseph and Allen Wells is an indispensable starting point and a continual source of inspiration for any student of modern Yucatn, and both have offered me considerable feedback as this project has taken shape. I had the good fortune of making the acquaintance of Ben Fallaw, Christopher Gill, Matthew Restall, Terry Rugeley, and Paul Sullivan in the archives in Yucatn; all have shared documents and insights with me, and I have profited both from their scholarship and their generosity. Terry Rugeley also provided insightful feedback on an earlier draft of this book. In the library of the University of Texas at Arlington, Maritza\n\nxiv\n\nƒ\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nArrigunaga Coello has done invaluable work in assuring the preservation of Yucatecan newspapers and other sources, and she helped me obtain access to microfilmed sources on innumerable occasions. I conducted the initial phases of my research in Yucatn as a graduate student in the University of Michigan’s Doctoral Program in Anthropology and History and am profoundly indebted to that program and to those who participated in it. I worked closely with Fernando Coronil, who in graduate seminars, as my dissertation supervisor, and over years of conversation then and thereafter has been a perceptive critic, a supportive mentor, and my friend. From our days as undergraduate roommates through travels in Mexico, graduate school, and ever since Aims McGuinness has been a constant and close friend and interlocutor. His intervention at a critical moment to help me carry this project through to completion is especially appreciated. Similarly, David Pedersen has been a comrade in arms since graduate school, and our collaborative work on questions of value has shaped many of the concerns I brought to this book. I am grateful, in ways too diverse to enumerate, to many others, including Jasmine Alinder, Marty Baker, Chandra Bhimull, David William Cohen, John Collins, Val Daniel, Nick Dirks, Laurent Dubois, Elizabeth Ferry, David Frye, Jim Herron, Britta Kallmann, Webb Keane, Oren Kosansky, Mani Limbert, Alf Luedtke, Setrag Manoukian, Steven Pierce, Anu Rao, Bill Rosenberg, Javier Sanjins, Rebecca Scott, Julie Skurski, Genese Sodikoff, Ann Stoler, Tom Trautmann, Tom Williamson, and Tom Wolfe. I express my gratitude as well to the diverse entities that assumed the burden of funding my research and graduate training: Michigan’s Anthropology and History departments as well as the Doctoral Program in Anthropology and History; the Program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies; the Rackham School of Graduate Studies; the Institute for the Humanities; and the Michigan Society of Fellows. The Jacob K. Javits Foundation provided generous support through years of graduate study, and the Fulbright–i.i.e. Dissertation Research Abroad program funded a lengthy period of research in Mexico. Some aspects of this project were supported in later years by postdoctoral grants from the n.a.e.–Spencer Foundation and by an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation “New Directions” Fellowship. While based in part on research conducted while I was a graduate student in Ann Arbor, I also benefited greatly, as a faculty member, from further support for research and writing from Carnegie Mellon University and particularly from Carnegie Mellon’s Department of History. I am especially grateful to Rick Maddox, Roger Rouse, Judith Schacter, and Donald Sutton for their support and for their comments on and engagement with this project. As\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n%\n\nxv\n\nfriends and interlocutors, Albrecht Funk, John Soluri, and Therese Tardio have also shaped this work in more ways than I can convey. I am grateful to many others as well, including but not limited to Sonya Barclay, Raj Dasgupta, Mary Lindemann, Kate Lynch, David Miller, Lisa Tetrault, Joe Trotter, and Patrick Zimmerman as well as Jay Dwyer at Duquesne University. I also thank Reid Andrews, Alejandro de la Fuente, Len Plotnicov, Lara Putnam, and Phil Watts at the University of Pittsburgh, and James Brooks, the director of the School of Advanced Research in Santa Fe, for their engagement with my work. I am grateful to the late Michael Jimenez, who first turned me toward Latin American history when I was an undergraduate and whom I later reencountered upon my move to Pittsburgh. In our last conversation, Mike asked me a pointed question—about whether writing history is necessarily about finding and telling a story—which has haunted me and provoked the writing of this book. Valerie Milholland, the senior editor at Duke University Press, helped me to carry this project through to publication, offering invaluable insights and encouragement along the way, and making this a much better book. I am also grateful to Associate Editor Miriam Angress, Assistant Managing Editor Mark Mastromarino, and the rest of the staff who assisted me through the processes of revision and production, as well as to the anonymous manuscript reviewers, who provided invaluable feedback and suggestions. David Prout indexed the book, and offered excellent advice in the process. I thank Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology for permission to include in this book revised and expanded versions of two articles I published in those journals (“Hunting for the Virgin: Meat, Money and Memory in Tetiz, Yucatn,” Cul­ tural Anthropology 17:3 (August 2002): 291–330; and “The War of the Eggs: Event, Archive and History in Yucatn’s Independent Union Movement,” Eth­ nology, 42:2 (Spring 2003): 87–108). Finally, I would like to thank my family, whose support and encouragement over the course of many years made it possible for me to complete this book, despite a few staggers, slips, and falls along the way. My wife, Michal Friedman, has lived with this project almost as long as I have, has contributed innumerable insights and critiques, and has shared the burdens and pleasures of carrying it forward over the course of years of research and writing in Yucatn and in Pittsburgh. My parents, Joseph and Marjorie Eiss, have supported my peregrinations in this and other scholarly pursuits, as have the Eiss and Friedman families generally. Last, I thank my daughter, Elena Eiss, for letting me carry her on my shoulders and thus leading me to realize that my dances with deer were just practice for something else.\n\nƒ\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom Archive to Ashes\n\nat the center of the small town of Uc stands a sixteenth-century church and directly adjacent to it a large pile of stones and earth. The mound is probably the remains of an ancient Mayan temple platform—the work, as inhabitants generally say here as elsewhere in rural Yucatn, of los antiguos. Some of the stones, when I first saw the mound, had been rearranged in crisscrossing lines and painted red, white, and green, Mexico’s national colors. Crosses were planted on top of the pile, which sometimes was used for church ceremonies. Uc’s mound was a presence both ancient and modern, a reformed ruin, its stones and earth subject to multiple claims to the land and its past. Located just outside Mrida, the capital of the state of Yucatn, Uc is the gateway to the towns, pueblos, haciendas, and woodlands of what I call the Hunucm region, after one of its principal towns. Located in the\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnorthwestern corner of the Yucatn peninsula, the Hunucm region, which at the beginning of the twentieth century was classified as one of Yucatn’s seventeen administrative districts, is roughly thirteen hundred square kilometers in area. Today, however, the expansion of Mrida has turned the region into a periphery of the capital, one where many Hunucm residents now work. Brisk car, bus, and taxi traffic join Mrida to Uc, with its church, taco and meat vendors, cantinas, small shops, and rows of cinderblock houses. To the south, also adjacent to Mrida and part of the expanding zone of urbanization around the capital, is Umn, today a city in its own right ringed by factories, some of them maquiladoras owned by transnational companies. Farther west, though, the land opens up into a rural hinterland: scrubby brush, fields enclosed by rocky walls, industrial scale hog- and chickenraising facilities, occasional piles of trash, and the crumbling remains of haciendas, many of them now uninhabited. A series of pueblos and towns follow, each with a small plaza surrounded by rows of cinderblock and thatched-roof homes. Farther west and north, there are sparsely wooded lands where cattle graze and where some people still scratch out a living cutting down and burning trees and bushes and planting maize, beans, and squash in the thin but ash-enriched soil. Then there is what locals call savannah, a zone of uninhabited woods leading to swamplands and some higher stands of trees. Finally, there are salt pools and the gulf shoreline: a long stretch of uninhabited beaches and mangrove swamps interrupted only by a few fishing villages, like Celestn on the western coast and Sisal directly north of the town of Hunucm. The inhabitants of the Hunucm region, like those of the rest of rural Yucatn, understand many aspects of their lives in relationship to “el pueblo.” A portion of the region’s population lives in small villages officially denominated pueblos. Those who live on smaller settlements, like exhaciendas, however, also frequently refer to those places as pueblos or aspire, upon sufficient growth, to assume that title; moreover, those who live in populations classified as towns (villas) or even cities (ciudades), like Umn, typically refer to them as pueblos despite their larger size. Municipal institutions of governance, public facilities like schools and town squares, and communal possessions like ejidos, or collective lands, are often referred to as being of el pueblo (as in ejidos del pueblo). Political contests from the local to the national scales are continually waged in el pueblo’s name (i.e., as “the people”), one party or another claiming to represent the true interest of el pueblo against its adversaries or against the government. Religious life is oriented around the pueblos and focused on the veneration of local saints\n\nG U L F\n\nO F\n\nM E X I C O 0\n\n500 Miles\n\nEl Cuyo\n\nProgreso\n\nHunucmá Region\n\nMérida\n\nYu c a t á n\n\nMaxcanú\n\nValladolid Cozumel\n\nR\n\no\n\no\n\nTicul\n\nBay of Campeche\n\nCancún\n\nTizimín\n\nMotul\n\nHunucmá\n\nPeto\n\nQu in ta na\n\nCampeche\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\nVillahermosa\n\ns\n\nc\n\nelaria Cand\n\no\n\nBelmopan\n\nm Usu\n\nac in\n\nBELIZE\n\nt\n\na\n\nérrez la Guti Tuxt San Cristóbal de las Casas\n\nS E A\n\no\n\na\n\nHa nl\n\nT\n\nChetumal\n\nC\n\nComalcalco\n\nBelize City\n\nR I B B E A N\n\nLaguna Escárcega de Términos\n\nA\n\nn\n\nC\n\nr me\n\np\n\nel Ca\n\nm\n\nC iu d a d d\n\nec h e\n\nFelipe Carrillo Puerto\n\nC h i a p a s\n\nMEXICO Huehuetenango\n\nCobán\n\nPuerto Barrios\n\nSan Pedro Sula\n\nG UAT E M A L A 0\n\nPuerto Cortés\n\nHONDURAS\n\n100 miles\n\nXela/Quetzaltenango Guatemala Yucatn and Mexico.

Traditional fiestas, processions, and other festivities, like those of Carnaval, are also organized by pueblo and are understood to be fundamental to the way of life of pueblo inhabitants. Where festivities are performed exuberantly and well, residents feel pride in their pueblo; where they fall into disuse or seem lackluster, older residents in particular feel that something has been lost. Even migrants, who in recent years have left the region in search of work in Mrida, Cancn, and Los Angeles, think of themselves as continuing to be part of el pueblo; they associate with fellow migrants from their home communities, send money to their families, watch videos of religious events in their places of origin, and whenever possible return for the largest annual fiestas, both to see family and friends and to renew a sense of having a pueblo and of belonging to one. El pueblo is ubiquitous in the Hunucm region, so much so that it seems to be taken for granted by residents as a timeless framework for social, political, and religious life. Indeed, el pueblo is a term of exceedingly common usage, not only in that region but throughout much of Latin America, where it is used to refer both to the most intimate forms of communal life and to the broadest mobilizations of partisan and popular politics. The apparent ubiquity of el pueblo, however, masks a complicated historical genealogy. One branch of that genealogy extends back to Spanish precedents, where pueblo refers to rural settlements and populations; such usages reach back at least to the twelfth century and were brought to Yucatn in the wake of conquest and colonization. Another branch reaches across the Atlantic world, to tap into the rhetoric of popular sovereignty, especially that of the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth, with the emergence of collective republican political subjects projected in opposition to ancien rgime and colonial rule, whether in the form of le peuple, in St. Domingue and France; the people, in revolutionary North America; or el pueblo, in the movements of national independence throughout Spanish America, including Yucatn. A third branch— highly important in regions like Hunucm, whose populations are largely descendants of the Maya, many of them Maya speakers themselves—has its roots in indigenous societies, with manifold forms and understandings of community, territory, and sovereignty. Those indigenous concepts endured long after the conquest, even if over time they were eventually translated into pueblo. That act of translation, however, carried with it meanings, practices, and histories that altered the meaning and compass of el pueblo, both within indigenous areas and beyond their boundaries.1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\nTetiz, Yucatn: Procession of the Virgin of Tetiz. Photo by Paul Eiss.\n\nBecause the term pueblo has been in use for centuries in various areas and in various ways, the timing of its emergence as a seemingly unified rubric for communal, religious, and political collectivity in places like Hunucm is open to question. In Yucatn, its consolidation may date only to the early twentieth century, to the years of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) and its aftermath. In that period, el pueblo became both a political subject and a political object—the primary target of governance and mobilization for indigenous insurgents, capitalist modernizers, reformers, and revolutionary leaders, albeit in the service of markedly different agendas. Far from unifying such disparate causes, el pueblo became a focus of contention and an object of struggle, within which divergent conceptions of community and collectivity came into conflict, sometimes with great violence. In Yucatn and Mexico, and perhaps elsewhere in Latin America, el pueblo provided not only a language of solidarity but also of contention. In other words, the examples of Latin America in general and of Yucatn in particular suggest both that el pueblo has a complex past and that it is anything but a timeless or unitary subject. Beginning from those observations, this book is an attempt—to paraphrase Bronislaw Malinowski’s classic study of the Kula exchange in the Trobriand islands—at understanding the hold el pueblo has in places like Hunucm as a framework for defining relations\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\namong people and between people and things.2 As such, my text confronts serious analytical and historical challenges. The meaning of el pueblo is a complex matter in Spanish-speaking contexts, where that term commonly is used to refer to small population sites (typically rural villages) as well as communities (whether inhabiting such population sites or wider collectivities). In addition to its use to refer to places and forms of communal life, el pueblo” as “the people” has come to be a predominant mode for organizing collectively and for imagining collectivity in such realms as labor, politics, religion, and cultural production. Taking their cue from such common-sense understandings, anthropological, historical, and political analyses of the concept of el pueblo have tended to focus on one or another of its connotations, diverging into studies of either place (particular villages or towns and their immediate surroundings), community (whether local or broader), or popular politics (“the people”). Regarding the last and most expansive of el pueblo’s meanings, namely, as a political abstraction, some consider that entity to be a primordial, or originary, framework for collective legal and political right. For Luis Villoro (1998), for instance, el pueblo is anterior to the nation-state and fundamental, in particular, to indigenous rights to self-determination, or communal sovereignty. Others have followed in the path of Edmund Burke, who in 1791 in a critique of the French Revolution described the idea of the people as “wholly artificial, and made, like all other legal fictions, by common agreement.” Recently, in the context of very different analyses, “the people” has been described in ways that, similarly, stress its nature as a political construct characterized by emptiness or artifice: by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri as a “fallacious unity”; by Ernesto Laclau as an “empty signifier” giving expression to the heterogeneous demands of opposition politics; by Jacques Rancire as a “part that has no part” defined by exclusion from the system; and by Enrique Dussel as a “strictly political” category projected in the process of creating a hegemonic bloc.3 Such analyses capture aspects of the workings of “the people,” or el pueblo, in terms of political rhetoric and especially in the context of the unfolding of indigenous movements, and popular movements expressing the heterogeneous demands and identities of opposition politics. In projecting el pueblo, as an abstract, purely political subject, however, the philosophers may be purifying that entity of its complex entanglements in the material and social worlds in which it holds meaning and power.4 For while the diverse meanings of el pueblo might be translated and categorized in distinct\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\nways, in practice these meanings cannot be separated so easily. Consider the following examples: A man hacks away at underbrush, preparing to plant maize in what he has identified, despite the contending claim of a wealthy cattle rancher, as “lands of el pueblo.” A rebel in the early nineteenth century declares a revolution against Spanish rule and issues a proclamation of independence decrying the “enslavement of el pueblo” and calling for its liberation. A pilgrim from the pueblo of Tetiz walks in a religious procession under a hot sun, following a religious icon of the Virgin Mary, whom she calls La Virgen del pueblo (The Virgin of El Pueblo). A woman protesting in support of striking egg farm workers throws stones at a police officer, shouting triumphantly, “You see? El pueblo has balls!” Each of these instances illustrates how variant meanings of el pueblo may be invoked simultaneously. In the first, the cultivator might be referring to a specific town, to the community of people who live in that town, or to a specific set of material possessions, including particular areas of land, attached to that town or community. But he might also be evoking a vision of el pueblo as an impoverished or landless peasantry in contrast to another class of large landholders, or hacendados. In like manner the rebel, in his defense of el pueblo, might be seen as referring to a nation of people native to the Americas, as opposed to Spaniards. But el pueblo in this context might be understood by some listeners as a reference to indigenous peasants and peons who suffered exploitation by Spanish-born and native-born elites alike. The pilgrim in Tetiz might be expressing her devotion to the divine patron not just of a particular town, but also of a particular class of Christians who can be understood as differing from other Christians in terms of class, region, language, and ethnicity. The protester’s sexualized retort to the police officer can similarly be read both as a defense of a particular town and more broadly of a class of impoverished and exploited workers, whether in that town or elsewhere. As these examples suggest, particular references to el pueblo may not correspond to a neat definition of that term, as either place or people or political abstraction. In some usages el pueblo may lodge neatly into one such domain or another, but in others it transcends such schematic distinctions. The heterogeneity of the concept of pueblo not only presents a semantic challenge, but also makes it a difficult subject for historical study. This might seem surprising given the richness of the historical and ethnographic scholarship on Latin America. There is an abundance of work—too much to do justice to here—on indigenous history and communal life, on agrarian\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhistory, on social mobilizations and political struggle, and on race, class, ethnicity, and nation in indigenous areas of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes.5 The scholarship on Mexico is notable for its extent and sophistication, encompassing community-level studies, ethnohistories, and close historical analysis of agrarian insurgency and mobilization, state–society relations, and processes of regional, ethnic, nation, and state formation.6 Within Mexico, Yucatn has been the subject of a most impressive array of studies in every period, with emphasis on the history of the region’s indigenous and working mestizo (mixed-race descendants of the region’s Spanish, indigenous, and African inhabitants) populations. That historiography and the ethnographic literature connect with many of the questions I raise in this study of communalism and el pueblo, affording firm foundations for a work of this kind and a basis for illuminating comparison.7 Despite such points of intersection, a study of el pueblo poses particular challenges to the conventions of historiography. First, there is the problem of scale. El pueblo is a phenomenon that is hemispheric in scope but embedded in locality, making it necessary to transcend the kinds of separation that typically distinguish local or case studies from those broader in compass. Second, there is the problem of periods. The historiography is generally characterized by a tendency to distinguish sharply between colonial and national periods, or even—above all in twentieth-century historiography—to focus on periods of a few years or decades in length, corresponding to political careers or events on the national stage or to important political, economic, and cultural shifts. To study the concept of el pueblo in a way that tracks critical shifts in its use would seem to necessitate, in contrast, a concentration on both the longue dure—reaching back to the colonial period and perhaps even before—and critical political conjunctures, in both the distant and recent past. Third, there is the problem of defining the group or groups under study. Many studies, chiefly social and political histories, tend to focus on specific groups or classes. El pueblo, however, is a concept that both unites particular populations and mediates between, and may even become, an object of contention among, varied groups, for example, inhabitants of certain population sites or communities; distinct class, ethnic, or political groups; municipal, state, and national government officials; and a host of other actors and entities. In the course of grappling with such difficulties of scale, period, and subject, I have made choices that determined the nature of this book. Most importantly, this is neither a transatlantic historical genealogy of el pueblo, nor a focused study of el pueblo in a single community. Rather, I explore how el\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\npueblo came to have its hold over a fairly large, if delimited, region. In doing so, I have adopted a methodology that is heterogeneous, drawing upon the insights of methods that scholars have labeled “microhistory,” “ethnography of history,” and the “history of the present.” The first of these is a method of resonance in Mexico, building upon a large body of community-level studies produced by anthropologists like Robert Redfield and Alfonso Villa Rojas from the 1920s forward, and by ethnohistorians starting in the 1960s.8 Perhaps the best known ethnohistorical work, the first to adopt the label microhistory, is Luis Gonzlez y Gonzlez’s Pueblo en vilo (1968) (literally, “pueblo in suspense”), a comprehensive study of the village of San Jos de Gracia in the state of Michoacn. In subsequent invitations to historians to follow his example, Gonzlez distinguished microhistory from conventional history written in a national frame, which he termed historia patria. Gonzlez playfully, though problematically, proposed the use of the term historia matria to refer to microhistory, to highlight that method’s focus upon “the small world, weak, feminine, attached to its mother; that is, the family, the native soil [terruo], the so-called little country [patria chica].”9 For an in-depth study of el pueblo, microhistory seems to offer much. Its intimate scale might capture the multiplicity of social forces and actors involved in constructing and claiming el pueblo, while its temporal depth might reveal important shifts in conceptions and languages of community and collectivity over the long term. Even so, some microhistories and community studies, including Pueblo en vilo, are marked by questionable assumptions. First, there has been a general tendency to identify microhistory with the study of particular local communities, typically rural villages or towns (a tendency recently challenged by scholars who conceive of microhistory as a more open-ended exploration of “small worlds”).10 Second, there has been a tendency to identify local community with certain stereotyped characteristics. This is perhaps most starkly expressed in Redfield’s classic definition of “folk societies” as “small, isolated, non-literate, and homogeneous, with a strong sense of group solidarity,” within which mentality and behavior are “traditional, spontaneous, uncritical and personal.” Similar characterizations of local community, however, may be found in more recent works, often as a point of contrast with presumably more expansive forms of national identity, or with global or translocal forms of identification that have emerged in the wake of globalization.11 Such assumptions about the nature of certain kinds of communities as local things characterized by homogeneity and solidarity have long been questioned by many anthropologists and historians. Eric Wolf, for instance,\n\n10\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfamously proposed that while apparently isolated or autonomous, peasant ways of life are largely the product of the ways in which they are articulated to wider polities and economic systems—the “larger integral whole” of which they are a part. Subsequent historical and ethnographic literature from a gamut of areas and periods, ranging from eighteenth-century England to the highlands of contemporary Peru, has offered abundant evidence of the ways in which communities—and the concept and language of community itself— are internally contested and strongly shaped by conflicts with supposed outsiders, whether in the form of landowners, ranchers, or government officials and police. As Gavin Smith’s work and E. P. Thompson’s Whigs and Hunters make clear, communalism, including the versions of it advanced in the name of el pueblo, does not stand outside capital or the state. Its manifestations are rather a product of a centuries-old struggle in defense of community, but also over its very nature as well as that of the forces and entities contending with it and over it.12 This book, therefore, is conceived not as a study of community in a specific locale, but as a study of communalism in a defined region. As such, it offers an opportunity to find the large writ small in Hunucm. It uses a narrow spatial compass, focusing on the pueblos, haciendas, and towns of that region, and an extended temporal reach, from the colonial period to the present, to expose how the terms of community were open to contention, challenge, and change by a variety of actors, from indigenous workers and pueblo dwellers to landowners, merchants, and priests to activists and government officials from the municipal to the national levels. Such a tight focus offers a unique perspective on moments of rebellion and insurgency and it opens a window on what James Scott has called “everyday forms of resistance” that present a constant obstacle to capital and state, even as they help to form a symbolically meaningful and morally charged backdrop to those struggles. Moreover, analysis on an intimate scale reveals several other important factors that bear on communalism. One of these is the place of state formation and violence in conflicts over community and capitalism; another is the importance of mestizaje, or race mixing, as an aspect of class and communal transformation for both working-class pueblo residents and gentry of mixed descent.13 While portraying the large writ small, microhistory affords an equal opportunity to consider the small writ large: that is, to explore how apparently local issues (for example, struggles over communal resources like lands or salt pools or disputes over work or politics) represent more than generic acts\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\n11\n\nof resistance and might bear upon, or even shape, expansive entities like capital, state, and nation. In this book I attempt to demonstrate how struggles of the kind that have unfolded in Hunucm, both historically and in the present, might have implications far beyond the context of their initial unfolding. A principal argument of this book is that practices of making or claiming el pueblo—whether in times of struggle or not—were both internally and externally directed. They were internal in that in the pueblos and towns of the Hunucm region, as in other regions, they consolidated el pueblo as a place of habitation and as a corporate or communal entity. Struggles over community and communal possessions were also, however, externally directed, elaborated in dialogue with wider political rhetorics and frameworks of governance that also went under the name of el pueblo. My hope is that a close examination of ground-level struggles over community, capitalism, politics, and history in Hunucm might transcend such distinctions between inside and outside, suggesting some of the ways in which those struggles simultaneously shaped the consolidation of el pueblo as a place of habitation, a form of community, and a collective social and political subject. As such a collective entity, el pueblo exists in time and space, thus presuming awareness among pueblo residents of that enduring existence in past, present, and future—what Ernst Kantorowicz, in his study of medieval political theology, called “sempiternity.” Might the claiming or construction of el pueblo thereby imply a certain kind of shared historical consciousness or, to use Maurice Halbwachs’s term, “collective memory”?14 Here, I draw on a second approach, one that the anthropologist Joanne Rappaport has termed the “ethnography of history.” Anthropologists and historians have explored historical consciousness and historical memory in varied ways and recently have tended to eschew the assumption of shared collective memory, exploring instead the politics of memory both within and between social groups.15 Most recently, some have begun asking about archives themselves: about the nature and politics of their construction and of contending claims over them and the documentation they contain. One example of this kind of work is Rappaport’s own study of indigenous communities of the Cumbal region in the Colombian Andes. In an ethnography of communal archival practices, Rappaport demonstrates how the reading, writing, and performance of history have been critical not only to the defense and reclamation of communal lands, but also to the refashioning of indigenous identity and politics.16 In a similar vein, throughout this book I argue that documents and histories have played critical roles both in communal struggle and in attempts to\n\n12\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nclaim or construct el pueblo as a collective entity. These documents take various forms: from records permanently stored in official archives to ephemeral theatrical performances; from community land titles to petitions against land expropriation; from inscribed guns left behind by insurgents to penal files elaborated in an attempt to discover, document, and incarcerate insurgents; from maps to piles of bones; and from community histories to tales of a Virgin’s miraculous deeds. Such representations of the past are diverse, and none of them is truly collective, if by that term one means a story, like a creation myth, that is shared and recounted by all members of a community.17 Even in the absence of shared stories about the past, however, there may exist shared ways of telling stories. One of the principal aims of my book, as an ethnography of history, is to explore how aspects of communal experience are given narrative form as history. In doing so, I attempt to demonstrate how, even in the absence of a shared collective memory or an official history of el pueblo, pueblo residents and others nonetheless have arrived at coherent and mutually intelligible ways of relating el pueblo’s many pasts. Here we may consider this book’s third aspect, as what Michel Foucault called a “history of the present.” In the present context, such an approach involves writing a historical genealogy of el pueblo in the Hunucm region, featuring the moments and forms of its emergence and transformation. To do so is not to indulge in anachronism—what Foucault called merely “writing the history of the past in terms of the present.”18 Rather, it is to begin by presuming potentially radical difference between present and previous modes of communal and collective identification—whether organized under the name of el pueblo or not. It is to presume as well that those forms of identification have been susceptible to alteration as el pueblo has been appropriated or reappropriated, whether by indigenous communalists, landowners, revolutionaries, government officials, or others. Moreover, I interpret history of the present to imply a reevaluation of the present, as much as it implies one of the past. Conceived in this way, a history of the present becomes a way to facilitate the deepest possible confrontation of past and present, in a way consonant with Walter Benjamin’s challenge to the historian to grasp the “constellation which his own era has formed with a definite earlier one.”19 It may well be that this book, by taking present-day conceptions of el pueblo as its point of departure, begins at the end. Yet it also ends at the beginning. It brings a historical perspective to ethnographic topics—contemporary labor and political mobilizations, the circulation of money and commodities, religious fiestas and processions. Thus, I hope to\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\n13\n\nexpose some ways in which present-day references to el pueblo may represent deep and complex engagements with the past, even if the nature of those engagements may not be immediately apparent. More than just a method, writing strategy, or argument, this aspect of my approach corresponds to my experience in the course of research. While pursuing ethnographic fieldwork, I often felt a jarring sensation as the past seemed to force its way into my perceptions of the landscape and my interactions with those who inhabited it. When conducting archival work, I was equally distracted by my recollection of the words of interlocutors in the field, words that, insofar as I listened to them, guided me and my research in directions sometimes different from those I otherwise might have chosen. The experience of spending part of my life caught between field and archive led me to take interest in and to explore the various ways in which the world is delimited, constructed, and claimed as archive and field. Eventually, it also led me to question what it might mean to divide things, people, and the world in that way. This book is an attempt to ask that question, even if it ultimately leaves the answer, along with el pueblo, en vilo, in suspense. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 explores the changing terms of community and historical memory from before the conquest through the early twentieth century. Chapter 1 takes a conflict from 1856 between an indigenous cacique and a Maya-speaking mestiza landowner as a point of entry for a discussion of changing paradigms of territorial and political community, from kah (the Mayan term for place-based community) to comn (a term that can refer to both “commons” and “commune”) to pueblo. Chapter 2 uses the story of the capture and imprisonment in 1892 of a rebel popularly known as El Rey de los Bosques (King of the Forest) to explore both the rise of a hacienda economy based on the monocultural production of henequen, a large, spiny plant used to produce fiber for rope and cordage, and the transformation of indigenous leaders from legal mediators based in the pueblos into forest-based outlaws and rebels. Chapter 3 begins with the discovery of an inscribed facsimile of a gun found in the aftermath of an insurgent attack on an henequen hacienda in 1913. It reads the gun’s inscription as a document offering insights into the visions of pueblo and patria held by Hunucm’s indigenous communalists as they came to understand their struggle as one aimed at achieving el pueblo’s collective liberation. Taken together, chapters 1 through 3 trace the consolidation of two incompatible visions of community: one of landholding mestizo gentry and government officials with aspirations to enrich themselves and to rule in the name of el pueblo, and\n\n14\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe other of marginalized indigenous communalists who sought to defend communal prerogatives. Moreover, these chapters demonstrate the critical role of historical memory, especially of narratives of communal dispossession and collective liberation, in the elaboration of those visions. Part 2 consists of three chapters that examine the reshaping of el pueblo as a subject of politics and an object of governance from the revolutionary and postrevolutionary periods through the early 1990s. Chapter 4 begins with attempts by Hunucm’s insurgents and Yucatn’s Constitutionalist revolutionary government, in 1915, to end decades of social and political conflict in the region through a novel alliance. Indigenous calls for the recognition and material repossession of el pueblo, however, proved incompatible with government invocations of el pueblo as a passive object of state co-optation and control. The result was the breakdown of the alliance and the onset of renewed repression, which set the stage for intense partisan political conflict in the ensuing years. Chapter 5 focuses on a mass murder in Hunucm that took place in 1920 amid a bitter statewide political conflict between the Yucatecan Socialist and Liberal parties. An exploration of this gruesome event and of its alleged perpetrator, a man some called General and others called Beast-Man, exposes how acts of rhetorical and physical violence came to reshape the terms of historical memory in the region and to recast el pueblo as a partisan political subject. Chapter 6 discusses the comprehensive agrarian and political reforms instituted by President Lzaro Crdenas in the late 1930s, reforms that called for the survey, measure, and mapping of the land and provided a framework for el pueblo’s tight incorporation within and political subordination to the state. But in the wake of these changes, decades of bureaucratic vacillation and community-level resistance would prevent the complete execution of Crdenas’s will. Finally, in the early 1990s, the collective ejidos would be dismantled by neoliberal reformers who claimed to execute Crdenas’s will by finally mapping the ejidos, even as they embraced a vision of state and pueblo that broke radically with his legacy. The turn to neoliberal policies and frameworks of governance from the 1970s forward implied a profound attenuation of el pueblo as a framework of collective political mediation and control. Ironically, the way was thus opened for its reappropriation in populist and popular movements throughout the region that have acted in el pueblo’s name in ways both old and new. Part 3 explores el pueblo’s transformation, in ways reflecting both an awareness of history and its rethinking, in the context of politics, labor, religion, and cultural production. Chapter 7 focuses on an independent union movement that led to a months-long strike and developed into a cooperative\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n%\n\n15\n\nmovement after the strike was broken. Over the next decade union organizers and advisors, pueblo residents, and a Yucatecan theatrical troupe recounted the history of the strike in variant ways, each reflecting different stakes in its retelling. Chapter 8 is a study of the fiesta and guild system surrounding the most elaborate religious cult of the Hunucm region, that dedicated to the Virgin of the pueblo of Tetiz. Here I demonstrate the place of the Virgin and her miracles in the elaboration and performance of historical memory and communal identity, both within the Hunucm region and far beyond its boundaries. Chapter 9 presents the life and works of the Hunucm resident Don Anacleto Cetina Aguilar, as a poet, educator, historian, Mayanist, and opposition political activist. In this chapter I highlight the central role of the recovery of pueblo history and cultural identity as a response to the dislocating effects of contemporary neoliberalism. Nonetheless, as this chapter and the preceding ones demonstrate, el pueblo has remained salient not only as a framework for political subjectivity, but also as a place of habitation be­ fore, beyond, and outside the realm of politics. Postscri pt\n\nEvery year in the pueblos of the Hunucm region—as elsewhere in Mexico— Carnaval’s yearly cycle of festivities reaches its climax and conclusion on Ash Wednesday, with the execution and funeral of the festival’s symbolic patron, Juan Carnaval. Mock mourners wail alongside a coffin containing the figure that is placed in the public square of the pueblos, and Juan Carnaval’s will is presented and read to the audience. The will refers, in comic fashion, to events that occurred over the course of the preceding year: misdeeds of residents and authorities, squabbles and fights, political conflicts. “I leave my suitcase,” Juan’s will might read, “to the mayor, so he can pack up all the money he took from el pueblo!”; “I leave a bottle of aspirin to Don Manuel Cuytun, to help with his hangovers!”; “I leave one goat for the police chief, so he doesn’t have to steal animals from people’s patios!”; and so on. After the final lines of Juan Carnaval’s will are read out and the laughter begins to subside, the mourners perform the action that concludes Carnaval. Someone strikes a match and, as the crowd looks on, sets fire to the will, which quickly burns to a crisp to the amusement and applause of all present.20 When I heard of this spectacle, my feelings were mixed. If only the wills were not burned but stored away each year after Carnaval—at least photocopies of them!—thus forming a carnivalesque, subaltern, and eminently consultable archive of el pueblo’s past. . . . My reaction betrayed problematic\n\n16\n\nƒ\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nassumptions: that is, that the point of documents is to record the past and that the point of archives and historical narrative, whatever their form, is to conserve it. The deliberate destruction of the comical will is, after all, assumed at the time of its drafting and is the condition of its very existence. Like so many other histories of el pueblo, its power derives from performance and witnessing, rather than permanence. Carnival celebrants re-create in this way a meaningful kind of collective organization, communal sensibility, and political claim—one that rises, phoenixlike, from the ashes of its archive. Even if the episodes recounted in the will may soon be forgotten by those who witnessed its reading, the spectacle of the will’s destruction suggests that memory sometimes can take its most powerful form in a repertoire of ways of experiencing, telling, feeling, and performing el pueblo and its histories rather than in the documentary, topical, or factual content of any historical narrative.21 The same might be said of many of the other forms of history I have encountered, including narratives inscribed in archival documents, which are for the most part stored away in repositories that are unavailable to pueblo residents and seem to be of little interest to most of them. Once politically consequential and profoundly meaningful to the communities that produced them, time has made those documents as ephemeral as Juan Carnaval’s will. In their entirety, however, they have played a powerful and pivotal role in the making and remaking of el pueblo: as an object known and a subject that feels and acts; as an entity both material and symbolic; as a subject deeply rooted in the witnessing of this place and this community, yet also the product of so many interactions within and across its unstable boundaries. What follows is one more, perhaps equally transient, invocation of el pueblo, based upon a few of its many stories: from tragedy to redemption; from farce to miracle; from history in the archives to history in ashes.\n\nƒ\n\nchapter one\n\nThe Last Cacique The Archival Landscapes of Kah, Comn, and Pueblo\n\ncacique pascual chac was “not lacking in guilt.” That was the verdict of the criminal court judge Jos Mara Rivero Sols, who on 14 January 1857 passed judgment in the case brought by the hacienda owner Juana Pea. Pea had accused Chac of encouraging a group of pueblo dwellers to clear and plant lands on her hacienda, Tacubaya. Even as the trial concluded, the production of a case file went forward. On Rivero’s desk was a pile of papers: outraged complaints from the hacendada; Chac’s self-defense; the correspondence of courts and government offices; a surveyor’s account of a week-long trudge through Tacubaya and a map; a prosecutor’s denunciations; receipts. Each was a document in its own right, but all now were stitched together as a single case file under the title “Causa por acusacin de Doa Juana Pea contra el casique Pascual Chac.”1 To read this case file historically is to unbind it: to read each of its elements in its own terms, juxtaposing\n\n20\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nthem with documents outside the file. Unbound in this way, the “Causa” opens a window onto the Hunucm region of Yucatn in a time of radical changes, among them the decline of the indigenous leaders called caciques and the rise of hacendados. Once fragmented from its apparent unity into a cacophony of voices indigenous and Spanish, communalist and capitalist, the “Causa” offers an opportunity to explore how different ethnic groups, classes, and political entities coexisted uneasily and then came apart in the wake of national independence, the rise of agrarian capitalism, and caste war. To read the “Causa,” is also to rebind the file: to read the sutured text for signs of the political forces that made stories like Chac’s end in similar ways and in the process helped to transform the landscape that Chac and Pea inhabited. It is to use the “Causa” as an entre into an archival landscape in which documents bound people to place and place to people via contrasting historical narratives told by indigenous populations and Spanish and mestizo gentry. Landscapes in the archive, and archives in the landscape—from the first tree felled at Tacubaya to the last stroke of Rivero’s pen. Th e His tory i n the Landscape\n\nToday the Hunucm region is tightly connected and subordinated to the nearby capital city of Mrida. Five centuries ago, however, it was oriented toward the gulf coast. The shoreline was inhabited by Maya populations that lived in settlements (each called a kah in Maya) active in fishing and salt production. The interior was more sparsely populated and more densely forested. Populations there gathered beeswax, hunted and fished, and cultivated maize, beans, squash, chile, and cotton. They did so through swidden agriculture, as Mayan populations did elsewhere in Yucatn and throughout Mexico and central America (where the plots are called milpas, a Nahua term). They felled trees and brush in the woods, or k’ax, in the dry season, burned the drying refuse as the rainy season approached to create a layer of rich ash over the thin and stony soil, and then planted each forest plot, or kol. After two seasons of cultivation, the kol was abandoned to the forest once again, as only a decade or more of regrowth would make the land cultivable once more. Thus the small kahs of the interior—Kinchil and Dzem, Tetiz, Hunucm, Sihunchn, Yabuc, Samahil, Umn and Dzibikak and Dzibikal, among others—produced a surplus that they traded with coastal populations, providing maize, beans, and cotton in exchange for salt and fish.\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n21\n\nThrough overland routes and maritime trade, the people of coast and interior were linked to central Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, exporting cotton and slaves and receiving a range of finished goods and precious objects in return.2 Centuries had passed since the decline and collapse of the great Mayan city-states of the classic period; the last regional confederation in Yucatn, centered in the city of Mayapn, succumbed to interclan warfare in the 1440s. An era of political fragmentation followed in which noble families, ch’ibal, in Maya, became entrenched as they gained control of the largest kahs. Those kahs were ruled by leaders called batabs, with the batab of a dominant kah, a figure sometimes referred to as the halach winik, exercising dominion over those of neighboring populations. Most lands and other resources like ce­ notes, or sinkholes, and salt pools were attached to the kahs as communal possessions, but others were held as lineage property of the ch’ibals.3 After the Spanish invasion and occupation of the peninsula in the first half of the sixteenth century, Yucatn, where there was no gold or silver to be mined, was spared the heavy influx of European immigration suffered by other regions. Even so, the spread of contagious diseases in areas of dense population, especially along trade routes, decimated coastal areas. In contrast, the kahs of the interior, ranging in population from several hundred to several thousand, survived. To facilitate conversion and tribute collection the Spanish forced survivors to congregate in a few authorized pueblos. Today’s pattern of towns and pueblos thereby took shape, with each congregated kah, or indigenous republic (repblica indgena), based in a core settlement, or pueblo, with a church and plaza and a surrounding street grid.4 Despite such changes, the kah remained an entity grounded in communal possession of forests and other resources. While the conquest brought the elimination of the top levels of the Mayan social and political hierarchy, the batabs, whom the Spanish called caciques, a loanword from the Arawak language, retained many of their powers. They adjudicated disputes, regulated communal agriculture, and oversaw the collection of taxes and tributes. In return they won exemptions from tribute and personal service and enjoyed some Spanish prerogatives like ownership of horses and use of Spanish dress and of the honorific title Don.5 The conquerors imposed some Spanish institutions on their subjects, like the cabildo, or town council, although native elites turned such institutions to their own purposes. Members of leading ch’ibals monopolized positions as officials in the new civil hierarchy (tenientes, alcal­ des, alguaciles, regidores), scribes, and gendarmes (tupil, in Maya).

Native elites also took up positions as assistants to parish clergy and headed religious confraternities (cofradas). Those organizations managed extensive ranches and properties and supported saints’ cults and fiestas in which Christianity was incorporated into native religious practice.6 The kah came to play an intermediary role in the workings of the colonial economy, linking the Hunucm region to Mrida and to the rest of the Spanish empire. Through the institution of encomienda kah members were forced to pay tributes to their Spanish overlords in labor and kind, from turkeys and maize to beeswax. Governors, war captains, and other officials also claimed tributes, as did parish priests. The kahs of the region maintained granaries for the provision of maize to Spanish populations and also rendered tribute in salt and fish. One of the most effective forms of extraction was the repar­ timiento de mercancas, or the forced purchase of goods. The kahs in this way were both subordinated to local Spaniards and articulated to an Atlantic colonial economy through the extraction of products like textiles and wax that Yucatn exported, principally to silver mining areas elsewhere in Mexico.7\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n23\n\nHunucm’s importance to the colonial economy derived from tribute but also from a transport economy. Mrida was connected to Campeche, the region’s only major fortified port city, via the camino real, or royal road, which passed from Mrida eastward and southward through Umn, giving the region its name in this period: Camino Real Bajo. Merchandise imported to Yucatn from Spain or other areas of the empire passed through the region on its way to Mrida, and exports like wax and cotton traveled the same road back to port. The small pueblo of Sisal, northwest of the kah of Hunucm, became a secondary transit route, particularly for the trade in cane liquor, or aguardiente. Spanish merchants demanded that the kahs of the region provide muleteers and unpaid transport services. By the 1720s the exploitative nature of this arrangement would trigger a regional crisis, as batabs and kah officials, who complained bitterly to Yucatn’s governor in defense of their “tired and skinny” mules, began to withhold transport services and even to blockade merchandise. In response, Spanish officials, merchants, and a local priest denounced Hunucm’s batab as a “notorious” cacique who told “a thousand lies.” Facing beatings and imprisonment, the batabs restored the services.8 Over time the Hunucm region came to be important to the Spanish not only for tribute and transport but also for land. Despite protective legislation limiting Spanish acquisition of indigenous lands, ranches, and commercial maize haciendas began expanding west of Mrida over the course of the seventeenth century. From the early 1700s forward, indigenous cabildos sometimes raised funds by selling land to Spaniards, although often with a proviso that the lands in question were unneeded for communal subsistence—in the words of Samahil’s cabildo, “because we have enough other lands to maintain ourselves.” Even indigenous cofradas began to exploit lands commercially, albeit to communal ends, by raising herds of cattle for sale to raise funds.9 Nonetheless, colonial forms of exploitation, the rise of a commercial economy, and even the formation of large cattle ranches and haciendas in formerly communal lands implied neither the destruction of the kahs of Hunucm, nor the elimination of the cabildos and batabs that ruled them. Kah officials in Hunucm, as elsewhere in Yucatn, made the best of their position as intermediaries. They acted as agents of both Spanish exploitation and communal autonomy, retaining significant autonomy in decision making on matters that affected daily life. The sovereignty and integrity of the kahs were nowhere more evident than in the usage of written documents and histories composed by batabs and other officials. Before the Spanish conquest, scribes and their writings\n\n24\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nhad been critical to the workings of Mayan society and culture. Historical accounts of the ch’ibals and community titles of the kahs both legitimized lords and their families and endorsed the territory and sovereignty of the kahs they controlled. While Spanish anti-idolatry campaigns destroyed the vast majority of the codices still extant at the time of conquest, under colonial rule indigenous scribes and their archives continued to play a critical role in guaranteeing the territorial integrity of the kahs. From the sixteenth century through the eighteenth, Mayan scribes wrote and compiled Mayalanguage historical narratives in Latin script, documenting the claims and legitimacy of ch’ibals and the kahs. Moreover, the kahs retained and consulted documents and maps in the context of land sales, inheritance, treaties, and conflicts. Many of those documents were ambulatory texts, narrating walks through forests and fields and noting the presence and location of stone mounds and trees the Maya used as boundary markers. In a document dating from 1735 and relating to the kahs of Umn and Dzibikal, for instance, some fifty-three stone markers are noted. Such walks were rituals of possession that often took several days to complete and led to the production of an extensive body of documentation that legitimated the kahs and the ch’ibals that controlled them.10 Theirs were histories embedded in the land itself: in stone markers, trees, and other landmarks, in ritual walks of possession, and in Mayan documents that made those features and walks into expressions of community, sovereignty, and history. If Mayan scribes brought representations of landscape into the archives, so, too, did they embed archives in the landscape, transforming stones, trees, and wells into historical traces of the kahs and of their sovereign claims. This history was still present in 1856, when cacique Pascual Chac led a group of men into the woods near Hacienda Tacubaya. The testimony of several of the men involved indicates that Chac ordered that a breach be opened in the brush, and then he led the men in. Perhaps when the cacique did so he would follow the ancient customs of the kah: walking the lands with his subjects; noting and naming rocks and trees and telling their histories; and leaving landmarks of his own along the way in an attempt to restore and to reclaim an archive in the landscape. From M es tiz o to Ts’ul\n\nChac, however, found himself in a different landscape from that inhabited by batabs of prior centuries, as it was shared with the likes of Doa Juana Pea. Pea and others of her class were products of the past century of Spanish\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n25\n\nrule in Yucatn and of a shift away from the Spanish tributary regime toward one based on commercial agriculture and ranching. Partly a result of population growth and commercial development in Yucatn, this change also was fostered by reforms enacted by the Bourbon rulers in Spain. From the 1770s forward, those reforms brought the disentailment of corporate bodies like the kahs, the expropriation of community treasuries, the seizure and sale of properties held by kahs and cofradas, and the centralization of tribute collection and governance in the hands of district-level officials called subdelega­ dos. Such measures accelerated the expansion of Yucatn’s emergent commercial capitalism at the expense of indigenous communalists. While sugar cane became dominant in southern and eastern Yucatn, in the northwest commercial maize agriculture and ranching prevailed. Moreover, in swampy lands in coastal regions like Hunucm, gangs of woodcutters cut dyewood (also known as logwood, or palo de tinte) to supply merchants involved in the lucrative trade in dye.11 These developments fostered the growth of Hunucm’s nonindigenous, or vecino (a Spanish term meaning “resident”), population, blurring distinctions between what once, at least in theory, had constituted separate Spanish and indigenous republics. By 1779 the district’s total population of 20,899 was roughly 80 percent indigenous and 1 percent Spanish; the remainder was 10 percent pardo (African or mixed African and indigenous descent) and 9 percent mestizo (here, mixed Spanish and indigenous descent). Most mestizos and pardos were working people: small farmers, artisans, shopkeepers, and the like. A few, however, like Juana Pea’s father, Eduardo Pea, acquired property and capital. They identified with Spanish cultural institutions, and the wealthiest among them wore European clothing, reflected in the appellation gente de vestido. While they spoke Spanish, many also spoke Maya or a mixture of Maya and Spanish. To indigenous residents, they were ts’uls, a Mayan term originally denoting foreigner that came to have status and ethnic connotations, conveying associations of wealth, privilege, and lightness in skin color.12 By the late eighteenth century, kah officials were sharply aware of the threat that the expanding commercial sector posed to kah lands and resour­ces. They lodged petitions with Spanish authorities, claiming the expropriation of communal resources was unjust and a violation of Christian principles. When a cofrada ranch was seized for sale in 1782, Hunucm’s batab and kah officials, identifying themselves as the “old men” of the kah, appealed to the king of Spain for mercy and justice and inquired why cofrada cattle were being slaughtered and other properties “wasted, without any benefit to\n\n26\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nthe Virgin.” In 1819 batabs and kah officials from Hunucm and Tetiz sent Maya-language petitions to Yucatn’s governor, complaining of exploitation by a local priest and warning, “Lord, Tetiz kah will be ruined, since there’ll be no food to eat. . . . Lord, I shall not abandon [those of] my kah, although they are dying.”13 Kah officials put their maps and documents to use in contending with the expanding claims of Spanish and Yucatecan Creole landowners. Perhaps the most protracted conflict, one that began in the 1730s and continued for almost a century thereafter, pitted batabs and officials of five kahs against the owners of an expanding hacienda. In 1815 the leaders of the indigenous republics involved set off, joined by Spanish officials, on a fiveday walk through forest and field to document their contending claims.14 Such efforts met the unflagging determination of local ts’uls to expand their holdings. Initially, their success in securing limited concessions to establish cattle ranches on communal lands depended on their ability to negotiate with indigenous authorities. Indigenous scribes prepared documents in Maya signaling the assent of batabs and other kah officials to such concessions but specifying that members of the indigenous republics would retain the right to use wells, cut firewood, hunt, and make milpa in the lands in question. Eduardo Pea, for instance, promising to permit customary usage of the lands in question and to supply the kah with meat, secured a license to pasture twenty-five head of cattle near Hunucm.15 Negotiations occasionally became complex. When a wealthy landowner from Mrida attempted to title and purchase a cofrada ranch near Kinchil called Santa Mara, he confronted what he called the “custom of the Indians to resist every land sale.” Colonial government officials enlisted the help of local mestizos, Eduardo Pea and another man named Lorenzo Argaiz, as intermediaries. They were to inspect maps and documents held by the kah, interview old indigenous men on the history of Santa Mara, and explore the land itself. Once surveyed the land could be titled and transformed from a communal possession into a commodity that might be bought and sold. The first task, which fell to Argaiz, was to explore the woodlands near Santa Mara and to describe them in writing. More than just a land survey, his record of the sixteen-day task was a heroic narrative. It began with interviews of indigenous people regarding the history of the lands. Confronting “a great deal of variance, between what some pointed out to me with their fingers, and what others did,” Argaiz set off into the woods. There he faced great difficulties, which he described vividly: just how thick the woods were, just how spiny the trees, just how much they resisted his every attempt to strug­gle\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n27\n\nforward, “breaking through the woods” by sheer will. Argaiz repeatedly inserted the phrase “with compass in hand” in describing his wanderings, as if to differentiate himself from the Indians, who were described as confusedly pointing in all directions. Yet Argaiz did not go alone. While kah officials of Kinchil refused to help him, indigenous residents of Santa Mara accompanied and assisted him. On one occasion, as the group neared lands of the kah of Tetiz, Argaiz summoned officials of that kah with a letter he had written in Maya, to which they responded in kind, addressing him with the honorific yum, for “lord.” The next day Tetiz’s batab, along with cabildo members and a scribe, met Argaiz in the woods to converse with him and negotiate the limits of his incursion.16 Beyond that encounter, the grindingly difficult process of mapping Santa Mara was an ongoing process of collaboration with “Indian experts” (indios prcticos). They were the ones who laboriously opened holche’s, a Maya term for “breach” that Argaiz, a bilingual mestizo, used more frequently in his writing than the Spanish equivalent, picado. Day after day, Argaiz’s guides took him deeper into the landscape and its past, teaching him the names of things. Here was a cenote, or sinkhole, “a subterranean lake . . . called Chunpich, the Indians assure me.” Here were the remnants of a kah forcibly depopulated by the Spanish: “The old pueblo of Tzem, of which vestigial ruins remain.” Finally, a much older Mayan site offered mute testimony; Argaiz called it “a mound of stone, fairly large, built by the ancients, by hand.” More than just a matter of learning the lay of the land, the survey had become an exploration of the lay of history in the land. In this, the expert surveyor became the student of his guides. Once Argaiz’s work was complete, the second task, that of producing a record of indigenous testimony in support of the titling of Santa Mara, fell to Pea. First, the kah of Kinchil submitted documents to defend its claims, which immediately were dismissed by a government official as “confused maps, made by Indians or unqualified people.” It was up to Pea to locate other witnesses who might supply presumably credible information about the land’s history and then to translate their Mayan words into Spanish testimony favoring the sale. In the end, the titling and sale of Santa Mara went forward, even though one official voiced suspicions that Pea and Argaiz had engaged in “some kind of confabulation” to drive up the price of the property and perhaps to profit illicitly from its sale. Similar dramas played out often in the Hunucm region in the early nineteenth century, as reforms favoring the titling of lands paved the way for\n\n28\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nthe weakening of the kahs. Government officials now viewed indigenous historical documents, whether ancient maps, treaties, ambulatory land descriptions, or testimony of elders, with contempt, and mestizo gentry, using their intimate local knowledge and expertise in Maya and Spanish, crafted other kinds of documentation. It was their surveys and titles and their transcriptions of indigenous testimony which now held sway. Avid for wealth and power and experienced as middlemen, Hunucm’s mestizo landowners were well positioned to profit from the collapse of the Spanish empire. Taking their cue from Spanish Liberals, who used Napoleon’s occupation of Spain in 1808 as an opportunity to refashion the empire as a constitutional monarchy, Creole liberals in Yucatn militated for the abolition of tributes, of religious taxes, and, most importantly, of the indigenous republics. Such efforts were interrupted for several years by a conservative restoration in Spain. In 1820, however, an army rebellion in Spain forced the reinstatement of the constitution throughout the empire. Hunucm’s gentry joined the cause, led by the influential Pea, who alternately held posts as commanding officer of Hunucm’s militia, town councilman, and mayor (al­ calde). Pea joined Hunucm’s town council in denouncing the district’s subdelegado for persecuting liberals and blocking their attempts to contribute to the “great task of improving our commerce and agriculture,” presumably through the seizure of communal lands and the expansion of cattle ranches and haciendas.17 The new regime offered unprecedented opportunities to secure such alleged improvements. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, Creole liberals like Pea, who soon rose to the coveted post of subdelegado, became staunch advocates of untrammeled agrarian capitalist development. Yucatn’s new government passed a measure limiting communal lands to ejidos located within a one-league radius around the pueblos, classifying lands outside that radius as wastelands (baldos) eligible for purchase. In the Hunucm region, decades-old disputes over communal lands were settled in favor of hacendados and ranchers. Ranchers titled lands they illegally occupied, hacendados and merchants secured lucrative dyewood concessions, and municipal and state officials seized and sold lands still held by cofradas. Ranchers who held concessions expanded them, sometimes transforming ranches into haciendas. On the basis of his license to pasture twenty-five cattle in an area of common lands near Hunucm, Eduardo Pea enclosed lands and erected buildings on a place he named San Eduardo, which soon grew into an hacienda populated by more than three hundred head of cattle.18\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n29\n\nThe transition to national rule also brought new problems or, rather, aggravated old ones for Creole landowners. With the decline of the kahs in the late colonial period, increasing numbers of indigenous residents fled the pueblos, and thus their tax and tributary obligations, for the woods, a phenomenon Spanish officials called arranchamiento. With the abolition of the indigenous republics, the departures increased, as kah residents exercised their right, as supposedly free citizens, to move about at will. Despite their liberal credentials, Yucatecan authorities reacted to such settlements as their colonial predecessors had, namely, by denouncing those who “abused the civil and political liberty of citizens” by living “without restraint outside society, isolated from their priests and judges, dedicating themselves to idolatry, robbery, and carnality.”19 From the 1820s on, the Yucatecan government enacted a series of measures enforcing the payment of rents for use of common lands, disallowed “furtive illegal meetings in the woods,” and forced residents of illegal settlements to relocate to haciendas and recognized pueblos. In the Hunucm region, Subdelegado Pea joined forces with town council officials to destroy unauthorized indigenous settlements and force their residents to move to recognized pueblos and haciendas.20 Eventually, in July 1824, the Yucatecan congress reinstituted the indigenous republics, exhorting their leaders to “contain the dispersion of the indge­ nas to the woods, and provide them with an honest occupation, to make them useful for themselves and for society.” As envisioned by reformers, however, the restored batabs, or caciques, were much diminished. While empowering the caciques to collect taxes and tribute and to enforce church attendance, the congress made no mention of them defending communal lands. Shortly thereafter, the state constitution of 1825 defined structures of governance in the pueblos, instituting ayuntamientos (town councils) in central towns and juntas municipales (municipal boards) in smaller settlements. Notwithstanding their race-blind rhetoric of citizenship, the Yucatecan government segregated local governance, concentrating most power in the hands of the local gentry who controlled the town councils; the restored indigenous republics played a subordinate role.21 Under the new regime, Hunucm’s ts’uls held dominion over the kahs and their leaders. The subdelegado supervised the nomination of caciques. Municipal officials required caciques to supply contingents of men for unpaid labor for public works and road building, and priests called on them to collect religious fees and ensure church attendance. At the orders of indigenous and municipal officials, the tupils, or indigenous police, detained those accused of misconduct and administered corrective\n\n30\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nwhippings and beatings. The caciques thus found themselves in a compromised position. Those who displeased the ts’uls might be deposed or beaten; those who obeyed faced the resentment of their subjects, who sometimes responded to the despotism of their indigenous overlords with insults or even slaps of their own.22 Officials of the indigenous republics also played a role in the gentry’s acquisition of retinues of indigenous men, women, and children as laborers and personal servants; all were typically brought into service once adult males acquired personal debt, as sirvientes. By 1841 in the area of the town of Hunucm, one quarter of the population resided on haciendas and ranches; near Tetiz it was one third. Officials of the republics compelled indebted workers and their families to obey the will of those who held their debts. In 1845, for instance, a Hunucm resident named Evarista Chan refused to accompany her husband to a hacienda that was distant from her family, defiantly declaring that town officials would have to “break her into pieces” first. Rising to the challenge, a councilman ordered tupils to bring her to the Pea household, where they shackled her feet and chained her to a rock for three days.23 The rising fortunes and growing power of Hunucm’s gentry did not, however, make it a class united. The ts’uls of Hunucm were a bickering, fractious lot, competing regularly over land, dyewood concessions, and indigenous servants. They unabashedly used political office as a means of enrichment and even came into conflict with the church, sometimes challenging priests’ authority over the indigenous population. Parish priests complained, for instance, that Pea told indigenous residents they were exempt from paying church fees and encouraged his followers to sack the convent in Hunucm. Despite such rivalries, Don Eduardo made the most of the opportunities of a turbulent era. By the time of his death in 1835, his holdings were immense and valued at more than sixty-four thousand pesos: he owned six cattle and maize haciendas, more than fifteen hundred head of cattle, nineteen salt pools, dyewood stands, a fishing operation in Sisal, and houses and other properties scattered through Hunucm, Tetiz, Samahil, and Sisal. Large retinues of indigenous hacienda workers, muleteers, woodcutters, and cowboys owed him considerable sums of money, which stood as a measure of his power over them as their amo, or “master.”24 Alongside his tenacious campaign for wealth and power, Don Eduardo waged a ruthless domestic struggle aimed at refashioning his family of mestizo origins, one composed of two sons and one daughter, into a dynasty.\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n31\n\nWhen Juana was just twelve years old, her brother Felipe, infamous throughout the region for having an “unbridled tongue,” reported a rumor impugning Juana’s virtue to his father. Don Eduardo gave Juana fifty lashes for her presumed indiscretions and rewarded Felipe with one thousand pesos, with which he was told to construct a luxurious house on Hunucm’s plaza. Instead, Felipe gambled it away and this time found himself put under the lash. Afterward Don Eduardo ordered that Felipe’s hair and eyebrows be shaved off in order to shame him publicly for his dishonorable behavior.25 The patriarchal violence of the Pea family, as much as Don Eduardo’s ruthless quest for power and privilege, led his children on various paths. One son, Angel, proved unable to prosper, repeatedly squandering the wealth entrusted to him. Felipe tried to follow in his father’s footsteps by establishing a power base in Hunucm’s militia, serving as mayor of Tetiz, and acquiring properties. He pursued these activities, however, in a style that led one resident to call him “the most dissolute man, and the most irreligious, pernicious, deceitful, heartless, and disheveled as well.” Felipe seems to have believed that the road to honor, or at least to power, was through the dishonoring of others, and he did so with a vengeance: insulting and brawling with priests, beating and whipping officials of the indigenous republics, wandering through town in a violent, drunken stupor shouting insults and death threats at other gentry, even accusing them of incest. Felipe reportedly insulted every woman he encountered, calling them prostitutes and whores, and he raped the daughters of several notable families, offenses that once earned him a clubbing by a group of women from Tetiz. When Don Eduardo heard of such scandals, he slapped and beat his wayward son, but to no avail. Juana Pea took a different path. She married well, joining her wealth to the rising fortunes of Remigio Novelo, a prosperous landowner, notable, and municipal official and the owner of several haciendas, including Tacubaya, a maize, cattle, and dyewood operation a few leagues north of town. Novelo, who like many other members of the gentry chafed under the Pea yoke, was no friend of Felipe, and when Don Eduardo died in 1835 the antagonism came to the surface. Felipe, who had lived under Don Eduardo’s protection, proved unable to accede to his father’s wealth and power. Felipe held the post of subdelegado as Eduardo’s health failed, but after the patriarch’s death it was Juana’s husband who rose to that position. Felipe wandered the streets of Hunucm screaming that he was the rightful subdelegado and that he had the power to fire town officials and appoint others at will. He took\n\n32\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nto screaming insults at Juana and her husband in public. At night he would get drunk and stand outside Novelo’s house, shouting obscenities at him in Maya—still the language of intimacy and insult in the Pea family. Victory, however, would be Juana’s. Juana Pea and Remigio Novelo had political clout and material wealth, the latter significantly augmented after the inheritance from Don Eduardo, as Juana was declared executor of his estate. They also enjoyed social prestige among the region’s gentry, wide sectors of which became openly hostile to Felipe upon his father’s death. In 1838 the priest in Hunucm brought charges against Felipe for libel in a case that became a charter for Felipe’s social and political demise.26 The priest detailed his offenses against God, the church, and the clergy; municipal officials and militia officers described his public drunkenness and violence; others told of his sexual crimes and obscenities. They recounted Felipe’s “inhumane calumnies” against Doa Juana, hastening to add that her honor was unimpeachable. Even officials of the indigenous republics testified that Felipe had had them publicly whipped. The case file became a compendium of infamy; indeed, as one vecino commented, “To continue relating in detail the excesses and criminal deeds of Pea, one would have to write several volumes.” In the end, defenseless before so many accusers, Felipe blamed his downfall on an alliance between the priest and Novelo, both of whom, according to him, were “desirous of putting an end to my interests, and my existence.” Given his sister’s acumen and power, however, in all likelihood the hands pulling the strings behind that carefully arranged spectacle were Juana’s. By 1856, the year she heard that cacique Pascual Chac had led a group of men into woodlands of Tacubaya, Doa Juana had become the true inheritor of her father’s standing and wealth, as the owner of seven haciendas and ranches and other properties valued at about fifty thousand pesos and the creditor, and ama, of some two hundred indebted servants.27 In the “Causa” compiled a year later there is no record of her reaction to that news or of the memories it might have evoked: of Don Eduardo’s determined rise to wealth and power; of his domination over the caciques and indigenous republics of Hunucm and later that of her husband; of the intimate violence and dishonor of her family life; of her success in building her own prestige through the acquisition of property, lawsuits, and marriage: first to Novelo, and then, following Novelo’s grisly murder by insurgents in 1847, to another wealthy town resident. Perhaps these memories would guide Doa Juana as she responded to Chac, summoning the cacique to speak with her but also turn­\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n33\n\ning to other time-tested strategies that Hunucm’s mestizo gentry used in their dealings with indigenous populations. She would arrange for a land survey, assemble land titles and other documents, and request that the courts begin penal proceedings against Chac and his men. In doing so, she would set in motion the drafting of the “Causa” as one more among the many historical documents with which she and others like her took possession of lands and labor and in the process secured their transformation from mestizos into ts’uls. From Ka h t o Comòn\n\nDoa Juana would not be the only mestizo involved in the “Causa.” Although many of the men who followed Chac into the woods near Tacubaya were members of Hunucm’s indigenous republic and had Mayan names like Cool, Pech, and Canch, there would be others as well, with Hispanic names like Cevallos, Castilla, and Maldonado. Like Pea, these men were mestizos, but they were small farmers, artisans, and shopkeepers, not hacendados or ranchers. In Hunucm, working-class mestizos generally enjoyed a somewhat higher level of income than indigenous residents. Nonetheless, many mestizo men married indigenous women, and their children grew up in Maya-speaking households. When called to give Spanish testimony in court, they often needed translators, which suggests an increasing proximity to indigenous residents in status, occupation, and language.28 Under colonial rule, kah officials had distinguished clearly between the kahnal (Maya for “person of the kah”), who was entitled to work lands of the kah and was subject to tributary obligations, and the vecinoil (a Mayanized version of “vecino”), who was subject only to taxes required of Spaniards and their descendants. In the last years of colonial rule, however, the indigenous republics became more flexible regarding the use of communal lands. In 1815, for instance, when five kahs of the region came to an agreement regarding the “common use of lands,” the signatories to that agreement were batabs and officials of the kahs. The document was recorded as having been ratified, however, “with the entire commune of Indians and residents of color present” (con todo el comn de indios y vecinos de color presente), a formulation that demonstrates comn was being used as a translation of kah into Spanish, but also as a term that referred to a communal entity incorporating working people of mestizo and pardo background who were not members of the republics.29\n\n34\n\nƒ\n\nDISPOSSESSION\n\nThe term comn had a long history in Spain and the Americas as a way of referring both to communal lands and resources and to the community that claimed those resources. As opposed to the concept of ejido, which was legally delimited to a one-league radius around towns and pueblos, the term comn referred expansively to all lands historically used by a population, regardless of distance or location. In the Hunucm region, the term was used to refer to woodlands that residents used for farming or hunting and also to communal wells and to at least twenty-seven named coastal pools where inhabitants harvested salt for their own use or to sell.30 Moreover, in Spanish law and custom there were precedents for relating the size of the comn to population size and subsistence needs, which in theory allowed populations to claim lands not only on the basis of prior possession, as with the kah, but also on the basis of growth or material deprivation. Finally, while the comn, like the kah, was a place-based corporate entity, unlike the kah it was not a corporate ethnic identity but a corporate class entity, capable of embracing both subjects of the indigenous republics and working people of mestizo and pardo descent. In the wake of independence, the comn came to carry political significance as well, a foundation of liberal conceptions of right, popular sovereignty, and commonweal. Even in the face of measures designed to curtail arranchamiento in the early 1820s, residents of some unofficial settlements in the region earned temporary reprieves under the aegis of el comn. Yuca­ tn’s governor ordered the protection of lands near one such settlement for what he describes as the “common good” of the twenty indigenous families that resided there, opining that while not residing in an official pueblo, they did “live [in] and work lands of the comn, forming a true, even if small, pueblo which deserves the same consideration as any other.” To sell such lands, he concluded, would be an “unjust and tyrannical act” that would “enslave those who live there by subjecting them to labor obligations and other seigneurial rights, from which they are now free.”31 Such acts of tolerance were uncommon and became increasingly so in ensuing years. Nonetheless, in land disputes indigenous and working populations in Yucatn increasingly made reference to el comn and at least through the 1830s succeeded in slowing the alienation of communal lands through legal action. In 1834 several municipalities in the area of Opichn, directly south of the Hunucm region, joined forces in a petition against cat­tle ranches, leading one exasperated prefect ( jefe poltico) to denounce the “ancient and ridiculous pretensions” of “malicious and rebellious villains” who\n\nTHE LAST CACIQUE\n\n%\n\n35\n\nclaimed lands adjoining the ejidos as communal possessions. In support of their claims, he fumed, they presented “no other title than tradition, and the possession of insubstantial, confused, and legally invalid documents,” effectively proposing that “each pueblo should be a small independent nation, whether prosperous or miserable.”32 Despite such contemptuous reactions, land conflicts in the Hunucm re­ gion in the same period suggest that kah officials’ appeals to el comn, however ancient in their origins, were contemporary expressions, appropriating liberal political rhetoric to communal purposes. When one landowner claimed alleged wastelands in 1837, Uc’s cacique and kah officials protested that “those woodlands belong to the comn of el pueblo . . . and one of our duties is to avoid any harm that may be done to the comn . . . those woods cannot be sold . . . since the indgenas don’t have any place to make their milpas, and often must rent other lands for that purpose, in addition to the damage that cattle raising will cause to their plots.” In the same year the cacique and officials of Kinchil’s kah defended their comn against an attempt by Felipe Pea to annex an old cofrada hacienda along with its indigenous residents. They denounced the efforts of hacendados to seize areas of the comn without citing representatives of the kah to participate in the surveys. In making their claim, the petitioners evoked not only the kah’s prior possession, but also the prospect of its dispossession: “If the pueblo of Kinchil has grown large, in its number of inhabitants; if from the ejidos that border it, its vecinos provide themselves with wood, charcoal, and other necessities of life; if its lands are scarcely enough to cultivate the grains upon which they depend—is it not clear that the proposal of a few private landowners to buy or rent those lands is to kill [Kinchil’s inhabitants], or at least to enslave them, making them the vassals of the buyer? Is this not clearly opposed to the liberty that the free and philanthropic Government that we enjoy offers, and to the pueblo’s possession, since time immemorial, of its lands?”33 Indigenous residents of Hunucm made a similar appeal in 1844 in an attempt to prevent a rancher from claiming lands of the comn west of Hunucm, the only lands left for their “subsistence, "
