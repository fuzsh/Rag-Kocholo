        "text": "Preview natural voices in Narrator\n\nWe launched natural voices in 10 new locales as part of Windows September 2023 update. Those natural voices include Chinese, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), Japanese, English (UK), French, Portuguese, English (India), German and Korean. With this Windows update, users will be able to preview and listen to the natural voice before downloading a voice model.\n\nOnce downloaded, Natural Narrator voices support text-to-speech on-device and do not require an internet connection. For more information, refer to natural voices section in Appendix A: Supported languages and voices.\n\nNotes:\n\nThere are more improvements and bugs fixed in this release. For more information, refer to Appendix H: List of Issues and Bugs fixed.\n\nTo see the history of narrator updates, refer to Appendix I: History of Narrator Updates.\n\nOther capabilities that are new to Narrator over the last few releases\n\nNarrator Home\n\nEvery time you turn on Narrator, you’ll go to Narrator Home, which gives you one place where you can find everything you need, from changing your Narrator settings to learning the basics of Narrator with QuickStart. Also, when minimized Narrator Home goes into your system tray, so you won’t need to navigate around it when using Alt + Tab to switch between things.\n\nRead by sentence\n\nNarrator can now read next, current, and previous sentences. Read by sentence is available whenever you use a keyboard, touch, or braille.\n\n“Sentence” is also its own Narrator view. Press Narrator + Page up or Narrator + Page down to get to the sentence view, then press Narrator + Left arrow to move to the previous sentence and Narrator + Right arrow to move to the next sentence.\n\nYou can use these new commands on Braille displays by pressing dots 2-3-4 or 2-3-4-7 in command input mode.\n\nNew verbosity levels\n\nNarrator provides five verbosity levels that impact the amount of information you hear when Narrator reads text, such as web sites, and when you interact with controls. Each level is documented in Chapter 4 with a brief description of how you might want to use it.\n\nUse scan mode in your favorite browser\n\nScan mode turns on automatically in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\n\nStandard keyboard layout\n\nWe wanted to make it easier for you to learn and use Narrator, so we’ve introduced a new Standard keyboard layout. The updated layout is more like the keyboard layout you may have experienced in other screen readers.\n\nWhen keyboard commands are mentioned in this guide, they’re for the new standard keyboard layout. Some of the new commands include updates to Narrator’s page, paragraph, line, word, and character commands. You’ll also notice new commands like Narrator Find, list of links, list of headings, and list of landmarks. For some commands, you can now use the numeric keypad.\n\nYou can explore all the new and updated commands in Appendix B: Narrator keyboard commands and touch gestures. Find scan mode commands in Chapter 3: Using scan mode.\n\nNote : Your keyboard will default to the Standard layout. If you want to change this, go to Settings > Ease of Access > Narrator , and choose the Legacy layout. You can also get to your Narrator settings by pressing Windows logo key + Ctrl + N . New Narrator commands will not be available in the Legacy keyboard layout if keystrokes for legacy commands conflict with those used in new Narrator features.\n\nOpen Narrator settings\n\nNarrator key\n\nYou can now choose what modifier key you want to use in Narrator commands. Both the Caps Lock and Insert keys serve as your Narrator key by default. You can use either of these keys in any command that uses the Narrator key. The Narrator key is referred to as simply “Narrator” in commands. You can change your Narrator key in Narrator settings.\n\nUpdated Change View commands\n\nChange View commands are now mapped to the Narrator + Page up and Page down keys. You can also use Change View by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + Up arrow and Down arrow .\n\nImprovements to scan mode\n\nScan mode’s Primary and Secondary Action commands have changed. A Primary Action can be executed by pressing Enter or Spacebar . You can complete a Secondary Action by adding a Shift key to each of those keys ( Shift + Enter or Shift + Spacebar ). You’ll notice this change regardless of the keyboard layout you select.\n\nAdditionally, several new scan mode keyboard commands have been added that allow you to select text. You can learn more about them in Chapter 3: Using scan mode."
