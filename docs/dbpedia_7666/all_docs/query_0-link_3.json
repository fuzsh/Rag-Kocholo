        "text": "I spent this past weekend as a judge for the Selden Ring prize for investigative journalism, awarded by USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It's a great honor to serve as a judge — it's also very challenging to choose among so much great work, all of it deserving of recognition. I am thrilled for the winner, finalists and recipients of a special citation, but I hope that all the newsrooms behind the 74 entries know how good their work is and how essential it is for our democracy. Grateful to Mark Schoofs, Nancy Ruiz and Gordon Stables at USC Annenberg. It was awesome to spend a couple of days with fellow judges Alexandra Zayas, Geoffrey King, Norberto Santana Jr., Sarah Stillman, Kimbriell Kelly and Ken Bensinger. https://lnkd.in/g3bynuiE\n\nCongratulations to the Media Transformation Challenge Class of 2023! On Monday, 27 Fellows shared the final results of their year-long performance challenges, lovingly roasted their coaches, received their graduation certificates and welcomed the class of 2024 in the traditional heads-on Q&A at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg Florida. Some notable outcomes from this year’s Fellows: * A fledgling nonprofit community news org secured 7x its fundraising goal * A large organization grew its video production by 15%, resulting in increases of revenue and subscriber satisfaction * A nontraditional media outlet grew newsletters subscriptions by 25% in 2023 We can’t wait to see how the Class of 2023 builds on these successes in 2024!\n\nAs I settle back into my workflow at Voice Of OC and Chapman University, I can't help but reflect on my growth this year. In 2023, 23 of my photo essays were published in the Voice Of OC, not including other photo coverage for the platform. I also had the opportunity to work as a photo editor for Professor Julie Leopo's introductory photojournalism class over Día de Los Muertos weekend. Alongside Voice of OC publisher Norberto Santana Jr., I helped inform readers of free, public weekend events through the \"Free Things To Do Across Orange County\" series, publishing every Saturday. It took me awhile to find journalism, but I can say with confidence that I have never felt more at home in any industry that I have explored throughout high school and college. Thank you to Julie and Norberto, and the rest of the staff at the Voice of OC. I'm excited for what the future holds! https://lnkd.in/gE3teHPu"
