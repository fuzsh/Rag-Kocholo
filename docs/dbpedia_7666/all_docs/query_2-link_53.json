        "text": "How to contact the Local News Matters newsroom\n\nSocial Media\n\nBCNF Partners & Institutional Funders\n\nBay City News Foundation is grateful to our partners and institutional funders who have helped us grow and do impactful work. They include:\n\nA Note About Our Firewall:\n\nOur organization retains full authority over editorial content to protect the best journalistic and business interests of our organization. We will maintain a firewall between news coverage decisions and sources of all revenue. Acceptance of financial support does not constitute implied or actual endorsement of donors or their products, services or opinions.\n\nWe accept gifts, grants and sponsorships from individuals and organizations for the general support of our activities, but our news judgments are made independently and not on the basis of donor support.\n\nOur organization also may consider donations to support the coverage of particular topics, but our organization maintains editorial control of the coverage. We will cede no right of review or influence of editorial content, nor of unauthorized distribution of editorial content.\n\nOur organization will make public all donors who give a total of $500 or more. We will accept anonymous donations for general support only if it is clear that sufficient safeguards have been put into place that the expenditure of that donation is made independently by our organization and in compliance with INN’s Membership Standards.\n\nBCN Foundation Board\n\nLeadership Team\n\nJournalists\n\nBay City News has been covering the Bay Area for more than 40 years, serving TV, radio, print and digital media. More recently, the launch of Bay City News Foundation — a nonprofit affiliate focused on public service journalism — has broadened the scope of our feature and enterprise work, adding data, context and multi-media elements to our core civic coverage. In the last year, we have worked specifically on equity issues, underserved community coverage and demographic changes that affect the region. We aim to hire staff that reflect our communities.\n\n2023 Interns\n\nBay City News Foundation supports the next generation of journalists with year-round internships and training. We work with San Francisco State, San Jose State, UC Berkeley, Stanford University and others to train and mentor students so they have a professional path toward journalism jobs. A generous seed donation from the Hogan-Newton Fund at the Miami Foundation is helping to “turbocharge” this program by giving substantive mentoring to these interns and we are also grateful to the Arjay and Frances Miller Trust and the Rebele Internship Program for support. Contact us if you are interested in donating to this program or applying for an internship.\n\nPast Interns (2018-2022)\n\nInternships are an important way to give emerging journalists the practical experience they need to learn skills, try out the craft and build the basics of what could become a lifelong career. Bay City News is committed to providing internships to students at different ages and stages of their studies. We have provided a variety of breaking news and enterprise experience and also encouraged interns to take on a bigger project to set their portfolios apart. We have provided opportunities for 22 interns since the program began in 2018. They include:\n\nWomen Do News\n\nBay City News Foundation, the nonprofit that supports Local News Matters, is keenly interested in equity issues and gender parity.\n\nFor starters: Our founder and executive director is female, along with over 50% of our staff, leadership team and board members. We recruit female journalists and journalists of color for our paid internship program, providing them with the mentoring and on-the-job skills they need to thrive on their professional paths.\n\nAnd in 2021, we took on a passion project called Women Do News, an effort to raise the visibility of women journalists by increasing the quantity and enhancing the quality of their Wikipedia entries. Representation matters for credit, career advancement and inspiration to the next generation of women in journalism."
