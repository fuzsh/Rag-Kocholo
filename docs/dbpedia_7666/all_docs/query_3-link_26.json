You can also watch this interview on Youtube. About Ravi: Ravi Best is a New York City based jazz and commercial trumpet player who has performed domestically and internationally for two decades. Most recently, he has been performing, recording, and touring with Kool & The Gang, Blood, Sweat and Tears, The Duke Ellington Orchestra, and Little Steven and The Disciples of Soul, where he had the chance to perform with Sir Paul McCartney, and Bruce Springsteen. He has performed with several Jazz, Rock, and R&B artists such as Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Lenny Kravitz, Queen Latifah, Annie Lennox, Robert Cray, ani difranco, Michael Buble, Clark Terry, Tony Bennett, and Herbie Hancock. He has played in several Broadway shows such as The Heart of Rock and Roll, Merrily We Roll Along, Hell's Kitchen, Diana, The Color Purple, Chicago, 42nd St., Sweet Charity, Annie, and several others. He has made several TV appearances playing in the house band on SNL, Jesus Christ Superstar Live, Jimmy Kimmel Live( Kool and The Gang), Good Morning America(Boyz II Men), The Today Show(Little Big Town), The Late Show(Rufus Wainwright), and The Sherri Show. Ravi was also featured in the Chris Colombus film The Christmas Chronicles. He can also be heard on many recordings such as, Kenny Garrett's Pushing The World Away, Little Steven and The Disciples of Soul's Soulfire Live, and Summer of Sorcery, David Byrne & St. Vincent's Love This Giant, David Murray Octet's Octet Plays Trane, Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy's The Odyssey of Funk & Popular Music, Sam River's Rivbea Orchestra's Culmination, Ani DiFranco's Evlolve, So Much Shouting, So Much Laughter, and Mya's Moodring, The Broadway cast recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar Live In Concert, Heart of Rock and Roll, Diana, Ain't Too Proud, 42nd Street, and Baby It's You.\n\nCindy Blackman Santana is originally from Ohio, came to the East Coast to study at Berklee and at the Hartt School of Music, moved to New York in the late '80s and has played and recorded with a ton of people across the spectrum of jazz and rock ever since. She's made a slew of albums under her own name, including some featuring saxophonist and longtime friend of Burning Ambulance JD Allen; she toured off and on with Pharoah Sanders; she was the drummer for Spectrum Road, a tribute to Tony Williams Lifetime that featured guitarist Vernon Reid, who's also been on this podcast, plus keyboardist John Medeski, and bassist Jack Bruce. And she's probably best known to a lot of people for being Lenny Kravitz's touring drummer for many, many years, but what some people may not know is that she did not play drums on his records — he plays drums on his records. So part of our interview gets into the question of how you make music your own when you're playing someone else's parts.We also talk about her time working with Pharoah Sanders, and recording with Joe Henderson; we talk about her admiration for Tony Williams, and she gives her analysis of the changes in his style over the course of his career and how those manifested in the changes to his kit; we talk about how to lock in with a bassist, the difference in mindset between playing jazz and rock, and much more. This was a really interesting conversation. Unfortunately, it was cut short. Around 45 minutes in, my internet cut out and took our Zoom call with it. So you'll hear a sudden fade right as we start talking about the 2019 Santana album Africa Speaks, on which Cindy Blackman Santana plays. So what I've done is gone back into my archives and pulled up an interview I did with Carlos Santana when that record came out, and we talk about it, and also about her contributions to the band's music and his feelings about playing with her. I think it's a valuable addendum to this conversation, and I hope you enjoy the whole episode. Thanks as always for listening.\n\nSend us a Text Message.Ever wondered how sheer grit & humor can help one navigate the stormy seas of cancer diagnosis and treatment?

Artists like Lenny Kravitz, Anthrax, Gin Blossoms and more interpreted classic KISS songs. KISS was even able to get the biggest act of the 1990's Garth Brooks to perform \"Hard Luck Woman.\" Some artist were pretty straight forward with their covers, while others took big chances, like Toad The Wet Sprocket on \"Rock And Roll All Nite\", The Mighty Mighty Bosstones on \"Detroit Rock City\" and a supergroup made up of Tool, Rage Against The Machine and Faith No More called Shandi's Addiction with their version of \"Calling Dr. Love.\" The guys breakdown the track selection and rank the songs and treat this like a compilation album, so they then rank the compilation album and cover versus the previous reviewed compilation albums.
