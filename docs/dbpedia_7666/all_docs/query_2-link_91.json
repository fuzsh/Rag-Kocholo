        "text": "Leadership Team\n\nJournalists\n\nBay City News has been covering the greater Bay Area and Northern California for more than 40 years, serving TV, radio, print and digital media. More recently, the launch of Bay City News Foundation — a nonprofit affiliate focused on public service journalism published at LocalNewsMatters.org — has broadened the scope of our feature and enterprise work, adding data, context and multi-media elements to our core civic coverage. We have worked specifically on equity issues, underserved community coverage and demographic changes that affect the region. We aim to hire staff that reflect our communities across the fault lines of geography, generation, race and ethnicity, class, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nBay City News Foundation supports the next generation of journalists with year-round internships and training. We work with San Francisco State, San Jose State, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, CUNY, Columbia University, Yale and others to train and mentor students so they have a professional path toward journalism jobs. We also partner with the Emma Bowen Foundation and Dow Jones News Fund to identify high-potential candidates. A generous seed donation from the Hogan-Newton Fund at the Miami Foundation is helping to “turbocharge” this program by giving substantive mentoring to these interns and we are also grateful to the Arjay and Frances Miller Trust and the Rebele Internship Program for support. Contact us if you are interested in applying for an internship. Donate here.\n\n2024 Interns\n\nWelcome the 2024 interns at Bay City News Foundation.\n\nPast Interns (2018-2023)\n\nInternships are an important way to give emerging journalists the practical experience they need to learn skills, try out the craft and build the basics of what could become a lifelong career. Bay City News is committed to providing internships to students at different ages and stages of their studies. We have provided a variety of breaking news and enterprise experience and also encouraged interns to take on a bigger project to set their portfolios apart. We have provided opportunities for 41 interns since the program began in 2018. They include:\n\nWomen Do News\n\nBay City News Foundation, the nonprofit that supports Local News Matters, is keenly interested in equity issues and gender parity.\n\nFor starters: Our founder and executive director is female, along with over 50% of our staff, leadership team and board members. We recruit female journalists and journalists of color for our paid internship program, providing them with the mentoring and on-the-job skills they need to thrive on their professional paths.\n\nAnd in 2021, we took on a passion project called Women Do News, an effort to raise the visibility of women journalists by increasing the quantity and enhancing the quality of their Wikipedia entries. Representation matters for credit, career advancement and inspiration to the next generation of women in journalism."
