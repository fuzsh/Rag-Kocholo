        "text": "Really quite shocking to see what's happening at University of Southern California, as an International Alum it's particularly confusing to see USC make decisions specifically breaching 'American Values' like Freedom of Speech. When you choose to go overseas for research or study, you choose very particular universities and countries that you think will fit the themes, ideas and principles of your intended study -- seeing USC, and many other US Universities, go against Freedom of Speech, Expression and Assembly I think calls into question the value of Communications learning in those environments. How can you safely, fully express yourself in a research paper when there are direct, violent parameters around protest at your own university? Not to say that Australia or the UK do things specifically better, but the US university system, University of Southern California, all the big colleges looking for International Students, profess themselves, and particularly market themselves globally, as bastions of full, unrestrained education, and I think this is a shocking insight for International Alum (and hopefully prospective International Students) as to the strength of that marketing, and the reality of the situation.\n\nThis panel at #IJf24 left me absolutely high with inspiration - watch it here! Changing whose voices are centred in the media, making sure people get to tell their own stories of their own experiences instead of being spoken for and to - this could not be more important. It's the only way journalism can do its job properly, the only way we can rebuild trust, and is ultimately fundamental to our industry's survival. https://lnkd.in/eSA8Z4st\n\n\"Defensive Behavior Invites Aggressive Action!\" It seems like a dialogue from an action-packed Hollywood movie. As if Bane wants to destroy Gotham City and avenge Batman. But in the real movie, it does happen. Bane confronts Batman over his weakness. The weakness that Batman incurs by not fighting back over the years. For years his lackluster attitude towards himself, to Alfred, and Gotham City alike made him take a brutal hit from Bane. A hit that almost cost him his life. Gotham City was in peril. At the mercy of Bane, \"I'm Gotham's reckoning. Here to end the borrowed time you've all been living on!\" Are you ready to avoid your reckoning? You would, by any means possible. If not, nature will compel you to do so! If you succeed, HURRAYY!!! If you Fail, BYE BYE SWEETHEART! It is always a matter of being strong within yourself and your outer self. Otherwise, you will invite tough animals having a tendency to prey on weak or helpless animals. BE STRONG!! Being strong is also gender-neutral. So all the girls out there reading this post, do not obliviate yourself from it. It will invite tough animals' tendency to invade weak mammals like you. In all aspects of life - private, personal, professional, and public. You will become more attractive to men. Men will also become more attractive to women if they are lean and hard. After all, it may come down to 2P's Personality Performance What your Performance becomes your Personality. STOP being sloppy or weak who broadcast a lacking self-respect. \"Rely On Your Own Strength Instead Of Somebody Else's Compassion!\" Chapter 4 of the Boron Letters is hitting hard with every flipping page. https://lnkd.in/d5TE-rP3 #boronletters #strong #batman #gothamcity #copywriting #salesandmarketing #directresponsecopywriting"
