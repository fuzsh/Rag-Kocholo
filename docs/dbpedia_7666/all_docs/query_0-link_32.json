        "text": "It is with mixed emotions that I announce that I will be ending my tenure as President and CEO of the Weingart Foundation effective September 30, 2023. I will embark on a new chapter as President and CEO of the California Community Foundation (CCF) starting October 16, 2023.\n\nI have served the Weingart Foundation for more than seven years, initially as a board member and later as its chief executive. During that time, I am proud to have furthered the Foundation’s commitment to racial, social, and economic justice. Notably, we expanded our impact by integrating our grantmaking and endowment, resulting in over $88 million of mission-aligned investments in our community during the last fiscal year alone. This substantial investment represents more than 10% of the Foundation’s total assets.\n\nWe have also embarked on a journey of truth and reconciliation, a vital step in solidifying our commitment to being an anti-racist foundation. This process has enlightened our understanding of how racist policies contributed to the wealth we steward. This knowledge also grounds our commitment to our mission and the community.\n\nI hold deep gratitude for the Foundation’s dedicated partners throughout Southern California, from Ventura, Orange and Los Angeles counties, the Inland Empire and the Antelope Valley, to South and East Los Angeles. I look forward to maintaining my relationship with these community partners in my new role at CCF.\n\nMy heartfelt appreciation extends to the Weingart Foundation Board of Directors, led by current Board Chair, Monica Lozano and past Chair, Aileen Adams. Equally, I extend my gratitude to the Leadership Team of Joanna Jackson, Vice President of Programs, Tim Ortez, Chief Financial and Investment Officer, and Brian Williams, Chief Operating Officer, and the entire Weingart team. We should all be comforted knowing the Foundation and its mission are in their very capable hands.\n\nI look forward to working with the Weingart Foundation and the broader philanthropic community in the years to come to advance a more equitable and just Southern California for all Angelenos.\n\nWe want to celebrate the relationships we are deepening with partners that are using bold ideas and bringing positive change in their communities.\n\nWith our partners, we are advancing in three areas that are important to us.\n\nWe support nonprofit organizations filling the gaps of inequity created by unjust systems;\n\nWe strengthen collaboratives and organizations working together to increase the positive impact they can have;\n\nAnd we advance big ideas that bring about long term solutions to our region’s toughest challenges.\n\nWhen it comes to big ideas, we continue to champion bold solutions to homelessness including through our work on The Committee for Greater LA, a group of civic leaders with the shared vision of using the pandemic recovery as an opportunity to advance a more equitable Los Angeles. The Committee recently released research exploring attitudes Angelenos have on the issues of homelessness. Read about what voters are saying in this L.A. Times article and watch the webinar where The Committee shared the findings. Voters have not given up on finding a solution to homelessness in Los Angeles and neither have we.\n\nWhile we do a lot of work in the core Los Angeles region, our work and partnerships extend throughout Southern California. In this video, I highlight some of the work our new partners are leading. You’ll also meet:\n\nJulissa Peña, Executive Director of the Santa Barbara County Immigrant Legal Defense Center\n\nTorie Weinston-Serdan P.h.D., Chief Visionary Officer at Youth Mentoring Action Network\n\nNorberto Santana Jr. Editor-in-Chief, Voice of O.C., and\n\nYongsuk “Jesse” Lee, Co-Founder and Executive Director at Street Company.\n\nWe look forward to working with these partners and many others as we advance social, racial, and economic equity together."
