Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries, since colonization of the Americas by European powers began. Its simplest definition is “mixing.” Norms and ideas about racial and cultural mixing have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meanings by different people and peoples, ethnic groups, classes, races, organizations, and institutions at different times in different places. The chapters of this book present an array of perspectives on the realization of these processes, fundamental in establishing and transforming relations of power. The chapters here answer a number of interrelated questions: How have identities been imposed, constructed, negotiated, and interpreted in the Americas throughout the course of globalization? What kinds of challenges to identity (re)construction do the peoples of the Americas confront as they respond to globalization? How do they use identity to empower themselves in a globalizing world? Can autonomous reconstructions of identity and meaning enable disempowered peoples to solve problems inherent to globalization? The authors’ inquiries are fundamentally interconnected. Whether they consider experiences of conquerors or conquered, in history or present times, their chapters illustrate that the politics of identity is central to understanding globalization— and vice versa. The chapters in this book do not pretend to present a unified theoretical perspective. As with all research and writing, there is theoretical perspective embedded in each work. Some authors make their perspective explicit; others do not. Several of the chapters here are based on papers originally presented at the Fifty-Third International Congress of Americanists symposium, “Reconstructing Mestizaje: Political Identities and Responses to Crises of Globalization,” convened in Mexico City in July 2009. Symposium participants undertook critical analyses of “mestizaje” and “globalization,” abstractions often accepted as neutral descriptors of processes seemingly inevitable. They were inspired by the exchange of ideas and wanted to further develop their work. Later, other scholars interested in mestizaje and globalization were invited to contribute chapters.\n\nix\n\nAC KNOW LEDG MENTS\n\nThanks go first and foremost to the authors. The rewarding process of working together to better comprehend mestizaje and globalization and share our insights has been sustained by commitment over time to the project. Authors John Stolle-McAllister, Mònica Martínez Mauri, and Jorge Legoas P. provided extra assistance that is much appreciated. Essential support has also come from Kathleen Black and Rex Wirth. Advice, encouragement, and ideas have come from many good colleagues and friends, among them Gilberto García, John Peña, Jennifer Hackett, John Bort, Bill Harp, Philip Garrison, and Dan Herman. We also acknowledge the helpful comments of the four anonymous reviewers who generously gave their time to provide feedback and suggestions.\n\nxi\n\nMestizaje and Globalization\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts Stefanie Wickstrom and Philip D. Young\n\nAmong their traditional beliefs, Quechua and Aymara peoples of the Andes hold the concept of pachakuti, “literally, the turning about of the times . . . a change of direction” (Delgado-P. 1994, 77), as a turning or reversal of the world (Skar 1994). The Andeans view the pachakuti as a process that does not necessarily take place in a brief span of time but rather builds to a point of climax, of rapid, profound sociocultural change and the emergence of a new world order that has lasting consequences far into the future. Related in Andean Indigenous belief to a world turning or emergence of a new order is the idea of parallel worlds, older worlds that continue to exist alongside the new (see Skar 1994).1 The changes brought about by a pachakuti are not necessarily good or bad; they are radical changes that result in life in a world vastly different from the world that preceded it. A great turning took place, they say, with the ascendance of the Inca. The last great turning occurred with the arrival of the Spaniards, the overthrow of the Inca Empire, and the imposition of colonialism.2 The world is turning again now, they say. The impact of recent changes and reactions to them, beginning after World War II and accelerating from about 1990 on, makes it appear that this is indeed the case. Although variable from region to region and country to country, the Americas (along with the rest of the world) have undergone social, political, and economic changes in the past three decades at a seemingly unprecedented pace.3 Economists and other scholars refer to this recent period of rapid change as globalization. Following World War II, infrastructural and agricultural projects were introduced in many countries of the Americas as globalization opened\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\nmore avenues for economic, social, political, and technological change. Such development projects have usually been imposed and have had destructive impacts on Indigenous peoples and other disempowered populations that are in the way. Most, maybe all, Indigenous peoples are not against development projects per se, but they would like them to proceed (or not) on their terms, not those of the nation-states or multinational corporations driving them. And therein resides the core of the problem. Numerous nation-states have signed agreements (e.g., ILO Convention No. 169, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) to protect the human rights and property of Indigenous peoples. Many nation-states also have provisions in their own constitutions or laws that supposedly protect Indigenous rights and give Indigenous peoples a say in development projects within their territories. But, in the course of planning and implementing development projects, governments (including that of the United States) and multinationals regularly ignore Native rights, often using the “greater good for the greater number” argument. At the same time, processes of globalization have given Indigenous groups, rural dwellers, and other disempowered populations knowledge of and access to high-speed communications and media-making technology, providing them with the means to communicate rapidly with each other and with national and international news media, as well as organizations and audiences supportive of their causes. In this way, globalization helps to make processes of social and cultural mestizaje more evident to more people. It also reveals political and economic consequences that have long been evolving in response to processes of mestizaje, throughout an historical trajectory instigated by the European invasion of the Americas. Today, many marginalized groups are consciously responding to mestizaje as something central to politics and the imposition or transformation of cultural, social, and economic change. Since the 1970s, there has been a shift from the use of (mostly) passive resistance, i.e., “weapons of the weak” (Scott 1985), to more frequent proactive resistance—public protests, media campaigns, organizational networking, internationally legal actions, etc.—which expose to the world the often harsh human rights violations committed by governments and multinationals in the course of implementing development projects such as ever-expanding agri-industry plantations, open-pit mines, hydroelectric mega-dams, and oil production facilities. Disempowered peoples have recognized the power of asserting an ethnic identity and engaging in a politics of identity in resistance.\n\nGrappling with Globalization The chapters in this book examine ways in which economic, social, political, and technological aspects of globalization have influenced the identities of the peoples of the Americas, particularly Indigenous groups, and\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n5\n\nhow they have responded. What, exactly, is globalization and when did it begin? Literally hundreds of books and thousands of articles have been written about globalization.4 The term itself does not have a definition that scholars, politicians, or anyone else seem able to agree on (Steger 2003) nor is there much agreement about when it began. There is also little agreement on whether it is beneficial or not. Globalization involves “almost unrestrained flows of capital, consumer goods, information, and people around the globe” (Brumann 1998, 496), the expansion of networks of social and economic relations, and an increase in interdependencies among political entities that fosters “in people a growing awareness of deepening connections between the local and the distant” (Steger 2003, 13). We might say that, on a global scale, the period beginning in the late 1980s marks the beginning of the current wave of globalization. The dissolution of the USSR and the fall of the Berlin Wall erased Cold War barriers to the internationalization of capital and financial markets. At the same time, technological innovations had been ushering in vast improvements in communication and transportation, with increases in speed and reach and decreases in cost.5 Academic debates in dependency theory and world-systems analysis take a longer view, but when economists and politicians debate the definition of globalization and its costs and benefits, it is this contemporary period upon which most tend to focus, rather than earlier historical periods that displayed parallel economic and social changes and reactions. It is this contemporary period that some Indigenous leaders have referred to as “the new colonialism” (see Gandhi 2001). Some scholars, particularly neo-Marxist sociologists like James Petras and Henry Veltmeyer, have called it, with considerable justification, “the new imperialism” (Petras and Veltmeyer 2004). Whether we take the long view, that globalization begins with the arrival of Europeans, or the short view, that globalization begins about 1989, it has had dramatic and multitudinous effects. It has affected different strata of populations in different ways. Its impacts in urban areas have been different from those in the countryside. It has different effects among different ethnic and racial communities, classes, age groups, and genders. Critics of globalization range from mild to moderate to radical. The latter see no good whatsoever in the processes and policies of the current phase of neoliberal globalization (often referred to as the “Washington consensus,” for obvious reasons). Proponents range from those who see some problems with the current (economic) process (Stiglitz 2001) to those who think that every aspect of globalization is inherently beneficial (e.g., Bhagwati 2004; M. Wolf 2004). The latter often also seem to believe that there actually is, in the real world, something called a free-market economy.6 For a brief but excellent general introduction that goes beyond\n\n6\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\neconomic aspects of globalization to consider political, cultural, and ideological dimensions as well, see Steger 2003. By the 1990s, it had become obvious that earlier predictions about the disappearance of nation-states, or a considerable weakening of their economic and political power, had not come to pass and in all likelihood would not occur (Held at al. 1999). Fears that economic globalization would lead to cultural homogenization had also dissipated in the face of mounting evidence that, in fact, even the opposite could happen (Brumann 1998). Social movements that strengthened group identity— Indigenous social movements, for example—were taking center stage and were focused more often than not on social and political issues rather than economic ones. A renewed emphasis on ethnic and cultural identity, a sharpening of the boundaries of the local as a reaction to the impositions of the global, has emerged. Much of the globalization literature views processes and interactions of globalization from the top down, as it is often initiated and managed by nation-states, governments, transnationals, and multilateral financial and development institutions, but it is analytically more enlightening to view globalization as a series of adaptive processes that involve interchanges between the global and the local. People as individuals and small groups in communities and localities adapt to these impositions. Those “at the top,” in turn, adjust and adapt their own strategies and policies in response to adaptations from below, especially those that take the form of resistance. Globalization is multidimensional, shaped by planned and spontaneous responses, and it involves an ongoing series of adjustments from the global to the local and back again. Globalization may be viewed as both evolutionary and revolutionary.\n\nMestizaje What is mestizaje? The word does not easily translate to English. A language dictionary will define it as “miscegenation,” a term associated with illegitimacy and taboo. Miscegenation refers to race. Mestizaje can be biological or cultural. It can be considered an ideology or a movement, and it has been influential in drawing attention to identity and power in evolving intercultural relations in Latin America. Norms and ideas about racial and cultural mixing throughout the Americas have been constructed and imposed by many different kinds of social, political, legal, religious, and economic institutions, among others. As they have defined them, institutions have also responded for centuries to the sometimes constructive and sometimes destructive influences of intercultural relations and identity politics. The struggle to make sense of mestizaje is ongoing. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe its numerous and often conflictual mean-\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n7\n\nings as it is interpreted throughout the Americas and elsewhere (see, for example, Gruzinski 2002; M. Miller 2004; Pérez-Torres 2006). Our objective here is to provide an introduction to help the reader interpret mestizaje in the chapters that follow. Many chapters in this book treat mestizaje as a cultural phenomenon and a political endeavor tied to identity, but it is important to note that mestizaje continues to be examined as a racial phenomenon (although defining race is now generally understood to be a cultural or political endeavor). Given its own historical, geographical, and demographic profiles at the time it launched its colonial enterprise, Spain was obsessed with biological mestizaje. In Latin America, given what took place there as worlds collided during colonization, the obsession endured and relations of power were constructed on understandings of race and identity espoused by powerful people and colonial institutions. After independence, mestizaje was appropriated by nation-states to legitimize and assimilate chosen expressions of non-European cultures. The work of Spanish ethnologist Claudio Esteva-Fabregat is a twentiethcentury example of a scholar’s attempts to interpret culture on the basis of nineteenth-century ideas about biological evolution and the influence of climate on cultural development.7 He has struggled to set forth an interpretive framework that accounts in some part for the influences of genetics on the development of a pluralistic society in Ibero-America. He contends (as have others interested in biological mestizaje) that the mestizo has an advantageous genetic makeup that promotes survival. In addition, he believes that, given the right climactic and social conditions, mestizaje enables the exertion of an energy that can transform “culture” itself for better adaptive advantage. In the aftermath of the upheavals of colonization, the more fit mestizos grew in numbers while Indigenous peoples were “driven to frustrations of personality that carried with them the mark of confused identity, the loss of control over their reality, and the awareness that their existential style had been stripped of its cultural coherence” (Esteva-Fabregat 1995, 271). He asserts that, given the typical superior genetic makeup of the adventurer-migrant (from Spain or Portugal), the adaptive advantages conveyed by their societies, and a number of other variables resulting from the biological hybridization of the human populations of the region (with the exception of a very few isolated groups), “the native tribes of Ibero-America can be considered today as mestizoized aggregations” (Esteva-Fabregat 1995, 194). He goes on to explain that “under these circumstances, as the Hispanic cultural style tended to reproduce itself and expand on American soil within the framework of political, religious, economic, social, and technological institutions, and as it achieved dominance in the heart of interracial relations, the Natives found refuge in the reducciones run by the missionaries, settlements whose isolation shielded them from the total breakdown of their traditional milieu” (271).\n\n8\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\nWhether they “found refuge” or were enslaved or targeted for assimilation, they and other disempowered peoples of the Americas posed no real problem to development so long as expressions of their cultural heritages did not preclude their directed participation in the new society and economy. Where they survived as slaves, indentured servants, or tenant farmers, their mestizoized identities became acknowledged components of the cultural landscapes of the new nations of Latin America. What many interpreters of mestizaje may leave out of the analysis is agency. Indians, slaves, and campesinos are not simply byproducts of genetic processes and historical transformations. They are people who interpret and influence what is happening to and around them. One particularly fit specimen of Mexico’s mestizo intellectual elite— philosopher, educator, and politician José María Albino Vasconcelos Calderón—popularized a thesis that was to impact thinkers and writers throughout the Americas for decades to come. In La raza cósmica: Misión de la raza Iberoamericana (The Cosmic Race: Mission of the Ibero-American Race),8 published in 1925, drawing upon ideas emerging from his involvement with the pre-revolutionary intellectual group Ateneo de la Juventud,9 José Vasconcelos claimed that, with the blood of all the peoples of the world, Latin Americans were a “cosmic race,” able to redeem themselves from the ravages of colonialism through powers conveyed by a panmestizo identity, which would pave the way for humanity to create a more utopian life than could be established by conquest and empire. Building the future of Latin American nations was up to the mestizos. As were many philosophers of his time, Vasconcelos was influenced by the ideas of Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, and Herbert Spencer and their work on biological evolution. After writing the treatise for which he would be remembered and that would greatly influence understandings of the importance of mestizaje for years to come, Vasconcelos continued to struggle to make sense of the changing American experience and the respective influences of race, language, civilization, imperialism, nationality, and culture. He eventually concluded that “it is proved that evolution may affect species, but has no influence on the development of man and of cultural processes” and rejected The Cosmic Race as an error (Vasconcelos 1963, 81). Perhaps it is fitting that he ultimately discarded the influence of biology, as Vasconcelos’s lifetime (1882–1959) is concurrent with the emergence of the widespread understanding throughout Latin America that mestizaje is as much a cultural phenomenon as a biological one.\n\nInterpretations of Identity and Power Mestizaje has often been an imposed assimilative force that denies people the power inherent in their identities. Today, Indigenous peoples reject the\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n9\n\nmestizo label and insist on their Indigenous identities. Other disempowered racial and ethnic groups and their movements have also questioned and rejected mestizaje as they claim their own identities and engage in politics. States, multinationals, and other elite institutions and powers have responded to identity-based movements that challenge the status quo by co-opting leaders and creating internal factionalism that undermines identity and group solidarity, and thereby political effectiveness.\n\nIndigenismo Indigenismo is not translated into English without losing its most important congeries of connotations. It has been used to connote certain views of Indigenous cultures in Latin America largely imposed from the outside by literati and government officials. It is widely understood to be linked with mestizaje. From the early part of the twentieth century until the 1970s, indigenismo was most visible and prominent as a literary genre in Mexico and the central Andean countries (Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia), and as government policy in Mexico.10 Variations of indigenismo influencing incorporation of Indigenes into the mainstream culture of the nation-state exist in many Latin American countries. Mainstream culture is idealized as mestizo, although “mestizo” is not always a term in common usage (e.g., in Panama the term latino is the common one; in Guatemala, ladino). In literary works, indigenismo conveys “a romantic, folkloric image of the Indian as stoic, abject, and mysterious . . . the Indian as a residual figure—an anomaly—and the mestizo as a modern citizen” (Taylor 2009, 3). Government laws and policies may portray Indigenous cultures as premodern (to put it politely), largely out of touch with the modern world and often manifesting resistance to development and change, i.e., as backward and ignorant (to put it more bluntly). They refused to become mestizo, even though, in the view of the non-Indigenous observer, becoming mestizo would be in the best interests of the nation-state and the Indigenes themselves. This is a view that prevailed until the 1970s and that is still expressed in some nations, in the policies of some governments, and in the writings of some intellectuals. By the end of the 1960s, Indigenous social movements had emerged and were gaining strength throughout the Americas, including in the United States.11 In Latin America, tenets of indigenismo were questioned and criticized by some anthropologists, mostly Mexican, who rejected imposed policies of mestizaje as the means for incorporation into the nation. They argued that Indigenous peoples should be unburdened from the yoke of integrationist policies and have rights to self-determination within multicultural states, with equal rights of citizenship and perhaps special considerations by virtue of their indigeneity. Propositions along these lines were formally set forth in the first (1971) and second (1977) Declarations of Barbados.12 And, as Varese (1982) points\n\n10\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\nout, these criticisms came from not only social scientists but also various Indigenous organizations emerging in the 1970s, and they have continued to gain strength. New Indigenous organizations—from local to regional and in some cases national (e.g., Ecuador)— came into being, as did Indigenous social movements in their own right (not beholden to labor unions or peasant unions or other class-based organizations as in the past). These were and are based on self-identification as Indigenous and culturally distinct from majority national, typically mestizo, cultures. They are movements based in indigeneity.13\n\nIndigeneity Indigeneity currently refers to self-identification as Indigenous and to a largely, though not entirely, internally imposed means of conceptualizing one’s ethnicity as distinct from non-Indigenous. This contrasts with and may be opposed to externally imposed indigenismo. In Spanish it is rendered as indianidad14 (Groupe de Recherches sur l’Amérique Latine Toulouse-Perpignan 1988; Herbert 1977) and sometimes as indianismo, the latter seemingly a revival of the use of the term before indigenismo.\n\nIdentity and Power North of the Rio Grande As the field of Latin American Studies expanded in the United States in the mid-twentieth century, North American chroniclers of development in Latin America typically characterized Indigenous and other marginalized peoples as detrimental to progress (even though their coerced economic and social roles were increasingly indispensable). One interesting example is Martin C. Needler.15 Expressing in 1963 one of the predominant points of view of the time, the young Harvard-trained political scientist wrote: “It can hardly escape observation that the most highly developed countries of Latin America politically are at the same time among the most European in the ancestry of their population. . . . The most Indian and African states, on the other hand, are more frequently found toward the lower end of anyone’s scale of development . . . according to any index used—literacy, level of income, newspaper circulation, or any other” (1963, 19). He allowed that race should not be viewed as an innate biological characteristic but claimed it was an indicator of “a certain cultural history and, even today, a distinctive way of life” (1963, 19). Howard Wiarda, still a prominent scholar of Latin American politics and international relations in the United States, also conveys a story focused on the European contributions to mestizo culture. In his widely read The Soul of Latin America, he asserts the existence of a tradition of political thought in Latin America, “a virtually unbroken string for more\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n11\n\nthan two thousand years” (2001, 350) that originated in Greece, shaped political development of the Iberian Peninsula, and then later influenced and came to Latin America by way of Europe. Like many other elite scholars in the United States and Europe, he believes this tradition of thought defines political culture in the Americas, and he offers constructed interpretations of the history of the major pre-Hispanic civilizations of the Americas as background for understanding development in Latin America. Wiarda mentions Indian labor as a commodity, Indigenous populations as inspiration for ideas of some (mestizo) political theorists (for example, José Mariátegui in Peru), and in the contemporary context, Indigenous people as social movement actors who are now contributing to social, political, and economic development in Latin America. Wiarda’s Latin America “has shown positive genius in absorbing, accommodating, and coopting new ideologies, pressures, and social movements to its dominant and often still prevailing historic political tradition” (2001, 354). In the United States, accommodation of Indigenous identity was rare. The cultures of immigrant peoples who settled Indigenous territories characterized national identity, and the ideologies of non-Indigenous peoples were the basis for the construction of nationhood.16 Native Americans were killed, forcibly assimilated, or confined to reservations as their nations were occupied and their lands and resources expropriated for development throughout the process of nation-building by the new arrivals. Miscegenation was prohibited by norms of the dominant culture and sometimes by law (see Wickstrom 2005 inter alia). Assimilative processes in the United States were likened favorably to a melting pot.17 But that which emerged from the melting pot would be influenced little by Indigenous identities, histories, or cosmovisions. In the aftermath of the civil rights movement, proponents of multiculturalism rejected the melting-pot metaphor and called for respect for “diversity” and acceptance of a multicultural national identity, sometimes represented metaphor ically by political theorists as a “salad bowl.” For a time, in the United States, Canada, and Brazil,18 affirmative action policies that took into account race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (but not the notion of “occupied nations”) were implemented to correct for discriminatory politics and socioeconomic development. In U.S. popular culture, identities of American Indians, newly arrived immigrants, and minority populations are assimilated together into an imagined culture supposedly native to the place. Nonetheless, many peoples—from Métis people and tribal nations living across borders to Chicanos from Aztlán—are engaged in cultural survival, claiming their identities and pre-conquest imaginations, and impacting identity politics: History is myth. Myth is story. Story makes medicine. I am in daily search of these acts of remembering of who we once were because I believe they will save our pueblos from extinction. I believe our pre-\n\n12\n\nWickstrom and Young conquest imaginations offer strategies for building self-sustaining societies today, societies that can disrupt the mass suicide of global consumption.19\n\nInterculturalidad Relations of power in the Americas are persistently influenced by culture and identity as globalization proceeds. In Latin America, the “plurinational state” has begun to talk the talk of “multiculturalism.” Now enshrined in constitutions and special legislation of a number of Latin American states,20 neoliberal multiculturalism accords some de jure recognition of Indigenous peoples’ autonomy. How such accommodations actually impact Indigenous peoples remains to be seen.21 From 1990 onwards, many Indigenous movements have defined and promoted interculturalidad.22 A 1997 publication of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (La Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador, CONAIE) explains: “The principle of interculturalidad respects the diversity of indigenous peoples and nationalities and other Ecuadorian social sectors, but at the same time demands unity amongst these in economic, social, cultural and political arenas to transform existing structures and construct a new plurinational state, characterized by equal rights, mutual respect, peace and harmony between nationalities” (CONAIE in Walsh 2007, 179). Unlike mestizaje, affi rmative action, or neoliberal multiculturality, which promote national unity by giving minorities a chance to participate on imposed terms, interculturalidad emerges from critical interpretation of political, social, and economic development. Whitten and Whitten describe the consciousness of interculturality as “diasporic, global, and dynamic” (2008, 238). Interculturalidad is transformative. It calls for the deconstruction of economic, political, social, and cognitive realities. This deconstruction is prerequisite to reconstruction of sustainable and emancipatory lifeways, formulated with direct input from Indigenous people, based on their experiences and cosmovisions. Indigenous leaders, activists, and organizations throughout the Americas are asserting their world views as essential to making politics, development, and intercultural relations sustainable.23 Variants of interculturalidad are influencing social movements in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; in other parts of Latin America; in the United States; and beyond. Movements based in critical or decolonial interculturalidad demand recognition of the destructive impacts of the assimilation and subjugation of the peoples of the Americas throughout the course of globalization. The endeavor is not multicultural, but intercultural, demanding movement from one cultural system to another (Whitten and Whitten 2008). It is a transition to something new.\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n13\n\nWhat Lies Ahead? Part I— Constructing Mestizaje The chapters in Part I use historical perspective to help interpret the construction of mestizaje in the Americas. They provide insight into the clashes between world views and understandings of them that would be manifest throughout the process of the emergence of nations and mestizo cultures in the “new” world. They offer interpretations of imposed constructions of identity that continue to influence relations of power and expressions of culture. Mexican identity has been created from a partly mythologized past tied to civilizations that battled for control of the Valley of Mexico even before Rome’s empirical project was well underway across the globe. From the “Romanization” of Western Europe and the battles for the Iberian Peninsula between Christians and Moors, through the conquest and Hispanicization of the Americas, to the emergence of pluralism as a normative political ideal in the United States, Rex Wirth contrasts mestizaje with pluralism in chapter 1. He traces the political evolution of what is today Mexico and the construction of mestizaje against the backdrop of evolving European political systems and the emergence of nationhood in the United States rooted in Anglo pluralism. He argues that constructed mestizaje, seen as the basis of cultural identity in Mexico, can also be a basis for interpreting predominant political ideologies. In turn, pluralism, considered to be a political ideology, should be recognized as a basis of constructed cultural identity in the United States. In chapter 2, Sofía Irene Velarde Cruz also looks as far back as ancient Rome in her exploration of mestizaje and cultural legitimacy as she considers how the mixing of Spanish and Indian styles in the religious art of New Spain has been and should be characterized. Her exploration reflects imposed acculturation— then and now— and raises questions about resistance on the part of Indigenous artists in New Spain. Knowing what to make of the pre-Hispanic iconography employed in devotional works of the Catholic faith in the sixteenth century remains a challenge as the peoples of Mexico continue to wrestle with identity. In chapter 3, Iván Pizarro Díaz illustrates changing representations in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Chilean newspaper editorials about “el juego de la Chaya.” Considered by Hispanic observers to be an element of Carnaval, La Chaya is likely an Indigenous festivity with roots in Aymara traditions incorporated into the Christian celebration. Perceptions and judgments of it changed over time through constructions of imaginaries by Chilean social, economic, and political elites engineering the process of nation-building. Pizarro Díaz suggests that its eventual disappearance was brought about not so much by direct repression as by\n\n14\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\neconomic changes accompanying globalization, especially immigration to urban areas.\n\nPart II— Barriers to Empowerment Through Identity The vast assortment of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities of the peoples of the Americas has been reduced to manageability by assimilative mechanisms such as mestizaje and the melting pot. Laws and policies directed at transforming the lives of disempowered peoples are based on imposed identity constructs. In the Americas today, education, development aid, affirmative action, and Indian policy are based on and reinforce ideologies of dominant cultures. Cases examined here suggest these ideologies themselves must be confronted in struggles for well-being, justice, and cultural survival. As we consider how imposed notions of identity distort history, exclude participation, and stand in the way of cultural survival in Peru, in Brazil, and in Cheyenne territory in what today is the United States, we come to better understand common barriers to empowerment through identity. In chapter 4, Mariella I. Arredondo explores the formation, endurance, and reproduction of class- and race-based hierarchies through her interviews with students in middle-class and elite private schools in the city of Arequipa, Peru. She analyzes high school students’ perceptions of intersections among ethnicity, race, class, and culture in Arequipa. She finds that, as rural-urban migration of Indigenous people has intensified, the students’ perceptions are helping perpetuate the exclusion of Indigenous peoples from participation as legitimate citizens—unless they abandon their identities. In the context of globalization and rapid change, urban Ariquipeños of all ages embrace their own unique construction of mestizaje. It does not, however, include immigrants arriving from the surrounding rural regions, who supposedly have no culture. This disguises ethnic and racial prejudice as “cultural difference” and facilitates assimilation on terms imposed by the dominant culture, undermining attempts to implement intercultural education aimed at constructing a just and inclusive society. In chapter 5, Paulo Alberto dos Santos Vieira explores imposed understandings of equal opportunity in his discussion of affirmative action in Brazilian universities. He deconstructs the Brazilian state’s paradigm of “racial democracy,” which has obscured the racist nature of Brazilian society and undermined awareness and redress of racial inequality. He believes contemporary policies of affi rmative action have transformative potential, but that transformation also depends on the black movement’s ongoing challenge to a system that has long prevented subaltern social groups from accessing spaces of power. Jorge Legoas P. and Fabrizio Arenas Barchi consider the experiences of rural campesino-Indigenous communities in Peru in chapter 6. They\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n15\n\nfi nd that, as Peru’s economic and governing systems adapt to international economic and political contexts and accompanying ideologies, in recent years political participation of Indigenous people as citizens in a “culturally diverse” society remains based on a predominant “mestizing” imaginary. They critically examine notions of citizenship and participation imposed by the Peruvian state and non-governmental organizations. They find that discourses of development and democracy continue to characterize rural Andean communities, their members, and their Indigenous, peasant ways of life as “poor” and encourage their transformation and, ultimately, assimilation. In chapter 7, Jennifer Whiteman outlines the forced adaptation of the Cheyenne to changing material conditions during the conquest of the Americas and in what is today the United States. She finds that Cheyenne kinship, ceremony, and spirituality convey collective memory and promote the survival of collective identity even as the Cheyenne continue to be forced to adapt to superstructural changes imposed throughout the processes of globalization. She considers the interpretive significance of historical materialism and mestizaje as a lived process. Marxist theory can help explain what has happened to the Cheyenne, but it does not adequately consider or explain that which “makes a Cheyenne a Cheyenne.” Whiteman’s chapter, focused on forced adaptation and enduring cultural survival, is the transition to Part III.\n\nPart III—Empowerment The chapters in Part III illustrate that autonomous identity (re)creation continues to take place as ideologies related to identity continue to be imposed “from above” and sometimes manipulated for exploitative purposes. Disempowered peoples and their movements can be empowered through their interpretations of change and understanding of their own cultures and identities and of the significance of it all in a globalizing world. In chapter 8, Kathleen S. Fine-Dare warns against the tendency to equate change with loss. She explores the identity politics of cultural performances in Quito, Ecuador. She describes the ongoing construction of indigeneity taking place as people try to make sense of change. She finds that the indigeneity of residents of Quito is largely self rather than outsider imposed. While this affords them greater agency, it has also created new conflicts based in Indigenous identity. In Quito, identity politics is both “realizing and frustrating” the goals of Indigenous organizations. Sabine Kradolfer, in chapter 9, describes another way things are changing for Indigenous people in Argentina. She focuses mostly on the experiences of the Mapuche, who are becoming empowered through their mobilizations in the international arena. Situating their own struggles in the larger frame of the transnationalization of Indigenous movements, they are demanding recognition and respect. The “melting pot” in Argentina is\n\n16\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\nmade up of European immigrant identities. The state never embraced a notion of mestizaje, but international Indigenous rights movements coupled with human rights movements and Indigenous mobilizations in Argentina have compelled it to take multiculturalism into account. In chapter 10, Angela Castañeda introduces us to women who consciously appropriate symbols of Candomblé, a “religion of survival,” to make a living in a global marketplace. She draws attention to the agency of the artist, the entrepreneur, the consumer, herself as a Latina ethnographer in Brazil, and even orixá imagery itself. Mestizaje should be considered a lived process, drawing attention to ways people deal with racial-cultural mixture on a daily basis. Castañeda asks whether Candomblé as a lived practice, and even the orixá themselves as they are marketed, traded, and possessed, might enliven a transformative process of intercultural communication about the sacred and the secular within the global community. In chapter 11, Philip D. Young describes changes he observed in Ngäbe communities and families over the course of the past fifty years in Panama. As contact with the dominant society has increased, he fi nds that educational opportunities, Ngäbe dependence on wage labor in a changing market, and access to cell phones and computers have made Ngäbe women today more independent and more assertive than they were when he began working with Ngäbe people in 1964. The women he has consulted are aware of and claim these changes. In chapter 12, Víctor Bretón Solo de Zaldívar and Mònica Martínez Mauri ask what accounts for the relative success of Indigenous social movements. They compare and contrast Indigenous movements in Ecuador and Panama. They illustrate the transformative power of identitybased collectives, an “Indigenous us,” and the rejection of mestizaje in Ecuador. They show how, despite a similar rejection of mestizo identity in Panama, Indigenous groups in Panama have been handicapped in their attempts to transform national identity politics by their lack of success so far in forming a collective identity. Finally, in chapter 13, John Stolle-McAllister describes the emergence of the Indigenous interculturalidad movement in Ecuador and its impact on national and local politics. As Indigenous movements and thinkers consciously challenge mestizaje, they are boosting a new praxis that may encourage awareness and transformation of the identities of the peoples of the Americas—not just Indigenous peoples— and promote clearer understanding of exploitative forces of globalization. He believes Indigenous interculturalidad may be a transformative force that can empower communities to advance sustainable and equitable development strategies. Chapters in Parts I, II, and III interpret the construction of mestizaje, disempowered peoples’ responses to it and other identity constructs, barriers to empowerment through identity, and transformations in relations of power throughout the course of development as identity facilitates\n\nIntroduction to Key Concepts\n\n17\n\nempowerment. Different theoretical perspectives and methodologies influence the inquiries of the authors of the chapters that follow. We invite readers to consider the research and findings of the authors and draw their own conclusions about transformations of identity and power. This is a good thing, and it will contribute to better understandings of mestizaje, globalization, and the experiences of the diverse peoples of the Americas.\n\nNotes 1. We use the non-standard capitalization of “Indigenous” throughout the book when referencing descendants of the original inhabitants of the Americas, although, where possible, we refer to people by their more specific group names. The term is widely employed by Indigenous people to mark themselves as culturally, socially, and politically distinct from dominant mestizo society, and it is not merely a descriptor of an endemic population. This usage complies with the desires expressed by such groups as the South and Meso American Indian Rights Center to be named in such a way and follows similar standard practices in referring to “Native” Americans and national groups. 2. Since colonial times, the belief has existed that at the time of the next pachakuti the Inca will return. 3. It should be noted, however, that the first fifty years after European contact and colonization of what is now Latin America and the Caribbean was a period during which change was at least as rapid as the current wave of rapid change— and in ways more traumatic and devastating for the Indigenous populations. 4. In 1997, Young supervised an MA-level exit paper by a student in the International Studies Program at the University of Oregon entitled “Globalization: Advocates, Opponents and Rebels” (Bryer 1997), a 110-page review of a sizable sample of the definitions and debates about globalization in the literature of the time—not all of the extant literature, for even then the student found the quantity to be overwhelming. Remarkably, the range of definitions continues to be extensive, and the contentious debates continue. 5. Some scholars, particularly economists, argue that the new technology of communication and transportation is not necessarily a part of the phenomenon of globalization. In a very strict sense, this may be true. However, even globalization characterized as only economic phenomena could not have occurred nor continue to occur without the technological innovations of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. 6. In reality, completely free markets, in which prices are governed only by the laws of supply and demand, do not exist. This is different from free trade, which, in theory, means that goods flow freely across national borders without tariffs or subsidies or other government restrictions being imposed. Free trade is sometimes given a wider meaning to include the free movement of labor, ser vices,\n\n18\n\nWickstrom and Young\n\nand capital as well. International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment policies generally include, in addition to the free movement of goods, the free movement of ser vices and of capital (called direct foreign investment) but not labor. In reality, whether narrowly or broadly defined, there is no completely “free” trade. 7. The editors wish to make it clear that we do not espouse Esteva-Fabregat’s views. 8. See Vasconcelos 1997. 9. Young People’s Cultural Association—literally “Youth Athenaeum.” Athenae are clubs, mostly elite intellectual associations dedicated to culture, art, and literature. They take their name from the sanctuary of the goddess Athena, the goddess of wisdom, the arts, etc. One prominent example, still in existence, was established in 1824 as a private gentlemen’s club in London. 10. The historical trajectory of indigenismo in the Central Andean countries, and especially Peru, differs from that of Mexico. These differences are not explored here. A good source, though not available in English, is Marzal (1993). An English summary of the historical differences between Peruvian and Mexican indigenismo is Jordan-Ramos (2010b), chap. 2. 11. One stimulus to the pan-Indian movement was arguably the publication of Vine Deloria Jr.’s Custer Died for Your Sins in the United States in 1969. 12. Global recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples was finally agreed upon, after years of debate, by the United Nations in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by General Assembly Resolution 61/295 on September 13, 2007. 13. Indigenous social movements have been discussed widely within the conceptual frameworks of the politics of identity (see Brysk 2000; Van Cott 2005; Yashar 1998, 2005 inter alia). 14. There is some question as to whether indigeneity was translated into Spanish as indianidad or vice versa. We currently suggest that indigeneity is an English translation of indianidad, based on the fact that Peruvian intellectual José Uriel García used the term in 1937 to convey what appears to be its contemporary meaning. 15. Needler received his PhD from Harvard in 1960 and went on to teach political science as a Latin Americanist (R. Gomez 1967). His academic career included serving as dean of the School of International Studies at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, and teaching in the Department of Political Science at the University of New Mexico. 16. Scheckel (1998) provides an engaging analysis of American Indians and national identity in what is today the United States. 17. In use since the end of the eighteenth century, the term became popular after a 1909 play of the same name by Israel Zangwill. 18.

An excellent compilation of recent scholarship assessing Indigenous autonomy is González Pérez, Burguete Cal y Mayor, and Ortiz-T., 2010. 22. Interculturalidad translates to English as “interculturality.” We use the Spanish in this chapter for two reasons: first, because we are citing scholars and organizations in Latin America that use the term interculturalidad and share at least a similar understanding of the tenets of interculturalidad employed in Indigenous resistance movements; and second, because the term “interculturality” in English has been used in different disciplines and by different writers to mean a number of different things. The study of critical interculturalidad is becoming more widespread, is being undertaken by more Latin American Studies scholars, and is interpreted and approached from a variety of perspectives. Besides those cited in this chapter, recommended sources on interculturalidad include Dembicz (2004), Saavedra (2007), and Viaña Uzieda et al. (2009). For more on different understandings of interculturalidad, see the introduction to chapter 13 by Stolle-McAllister in this volume. 23. Good examples have been set forth in the Declaration of Quito (First Continental Encounter of Indigenous Peoples 1990) and, more recently, by the Indigenous Peoples Working Group of the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, convened by Bolivian President Evo Morales in Bolivia in 2010. The Working Group declared: “This . . . is a space in which to channel the voices, wisdom, and reclamation of our origins that are present today in Indigenous and First Nations peoples. We aim to encourage and promote Indigenous visions, practices, and relationships of harmony with nature, and to share proposals regarding climate change and the defense of Mother Earth” (Working Group 7 2010).

Map of the Americas. Jennifer Hackett, Manastash Mapping LLC.\n\nCHA P TER ONE\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter Rex Wirth\n\nPeople have been living in the Valley of Mexico for a very long time. The cities of the valley have ranked among the top ten in population in the world since the time of the Roman Empire. Today, Mexico City is one the largest cities in the world. This is a phenomenal comeback because only five hundred years ago the valley suffered catastrophic depopulation as a result of the Spanish Conquest. The decline bottomed out in the mid-1600s, leaving the population base upon which modern Mexico was built: Spaniards who become permanent residents, survivors of African slavery, and the Indigenous population. There is controversy about the numbers, but most agree on the proportions. Eric Wolf (1959), who explored in depth aspects of several of the paths explored in this chapter, synthesized the various estimates and established base populations: the Indigenous population, after a loss of six-sevenths (6/7) of its pre-conquest base, was set at around 2,000,000, Spaniards at 300,000, and blacks at 250,000. Of all of the states in the Americas with both large land areas and populations, Mexico is unique in that the current mestizo population of over 100,000,000 is largely a result of the mixing of the three groups in this original base. This mixing is mestizaje. Mixing and melting are not confined to genetics, but the genetic aspect is of particular importance in instances where it is appropriated and incorporated through political action into the culture. Identities are cultural creations, and it is the mixing of these identities over time that defines a people or a nation. The nations of the United States and Mexico are neighbors, but the population of the United States results from continuous immigration and annexation, whereas that of Mexico developed in situ. Because they\n\n25\n\n26\n\nWirth\n\nrepresent polar extremes on this dimension in the Americas, the uniqueness of the Mexican experience will be developed by contrasting it with that of the United States. The two countries developed in very different conditions because of temporal differences. Mexico was more or less an established cultural entity before the upheavals that ushered in modernity, and those who were Mexicans adapted to change as it took place around them. In the north, culture was built anew. The perspective of “pluralism,” be it melting pot or salad bowl, provides the best window on cultural politics in the United States, but pluralism is a theory, a normative ideal, not a cultural identity. Mestizaje, on the other hand, is a cultural identity that has become a lens for examining existing and emerging patterns of the mixing of peoples and cultures in Mexico. Political scientists frequently use “pluralism” in the construction of general typologies of state governance (usually relating it to some aspect of “democracy”) to classify societies. Mestizaje has not been used in the construction of such typologies. The purpose of the explorations in this chapter is to find out why this has been the case. After a quick trip down the essential historical paths in search of clues, patterns, similarities, and differences, the mestizaje concept will be revisited, reconfigured, and fitted into a more inclusive typology.\n\nAll Roads Lead to Anáhuac By 200 BC, Rome had defeated Carthage in the Punic Wars, and the Celtic peoples of Italy to the north and south of the city had been Romanized, while in the Valley of Mexico, Teotihuacán was emerging as a comparable center of civilization whose influence and legend would develop parallel to that of Rome. The conquests, confl icts, and migrations that swirled around these centers in Mexico and the Mediterranean as they expanded, divided, were invaded, and were displaced by successor states would shape the identities, spawn the legends, and engender the gods of their offspring whose paths meet at Lake Texcoco 1,500 years later.\n\nCaesar to Cortés The last leg of the journey to Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital on the lake, starts in the recently reconquered Moorish city of Seville in that part of Spain still known as the “Land of the Vandals.” To understand the clash of cultures that took place when Hernán Cortés arrived, the origins and paths in Europe that brought the peoples of Spain together on the eve of Columbus’s “discovery” of the Americas must be revisited.\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n27\n\nEven though people had been there for a long time, our journey will begin as control of the Iberian Peninsula passed from Carthage to Rome at the end of the Punic Wars (264 BC–146 BC). Southern France and Catalonia had important maritime centers, but the rest of the area was marginal to the Romans, who concentrated their efforts on expansion into Gaul. With the completion of Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (50 BC) and its “Latinization,” or inclusion into the Roman world, the history of the Western Empire began. Some three hundred years later, it came into its own when Constantine made Christianity the state religion of the empire and then moved his seat of government to Turkey, leaving Rome as the center of the Catholic Church and the Western Empire. From this point on, the history of empire in the West, though there were still emperors, is pretty much the story of the popes at Rome—the Holy See. Throughout the fifth century, Europe was threatened by the Huns. By 450, the Hunnic Empire covered all of Central Europe, stretching from Russia to Turkey. Given the choice between fighting Romans or Huns, the Vandals, who lived in the area of Silesia, chose the Romans and crossed over into Gaul in the fourth century. After some involvement as allies of Rome against the Huns, they moved on into Spain where they established themselves in what is today Andalusia, the Land of the Vandals. Later, when the Romans and their Visigoth allies began to harass them, they attacked the Roman ports, assembled a Teutonic fleet in the Mediterranean, raided coastal areas, and ultimately established an empire in North Africa. They took Carthage in 435 and were living there in oriental splendor when, in 455, they launched their famous sack of Rome. The Vandals were finally defeated and the royal family exiled in Turkey as a result of the “reconquest” of Africa launched by Emperor Justinian of the Eastern Empire in 533. During the Vandal reign, many Moors served in the multiethnic armies they commanded, and it appears that no small amount of mixing took place. Mestizaje, it seems, has a long history. In addition to being scattered throughout North Africa, no doubt many descendants of the Vandals remained in Southern Spain and others returned as part of the Moorish conquest. The Visigoths in Spain were quickly dispatched by an Islamic army out of North Africa in 711, and the advance of the Moors was not stopped until they were turned back outside of Paris by Charles Martel, grandfather of Charlemagne. After coming to the Frankish throne, Charlemagne reestablished the borders of France and set up a series of buffer states (counties), known as the Spanish marches, along the Pyrenees to contain Islam in Iberia. He restored Italy, and the pope crowned him Holy Roman Emperor in 800. Although the Reconquista (reconquest) of Spain is often seen as starting within a couple of decades after the initial invasion with the first Moorish setback, it really started much later after it had fermented in the Spanish marches. During this period, the Goths became more Catholic\n\n28\n\nWirth\n\nthan the pope, and the local fervor to free Christian Europe from Islam exceeded that of the Crusades. The bones of Santiago (Saint James) were discovered on the coast of Galicia in 814, and he was soon elevated to the status of the patron saint of Spain and, particularly, of the Reconquista. Revered as Santiago Matamoros (“Moor Slayer”), he lived as an active presence on the battlefield. Pilgrims began to flock to the site, and a succession of ever-larger churches were constructed to house the remains. This became too much for the Moors, and they burned the cathedral at Compostela in 997 and forced resident Catholics to carry the gates and bells south, where they were incorporated into the Alhambra mosque. In 1026, Christian forces under the protection of Santiago Matamoros took Córdoba and forced the Muslims to carry the gates and bells to Toledo. And so it went, back and forth, with escalating mysticism and animosity. The present-day cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwest Spain was completed during the career of Spain’s greatest hero, the legendary El Cid. When, as a boy at the movies, I saw Charlton Heston riding down the beach as El Cid, I assumed that he was working for Ferdinand and Isabella and that his ride drove the last Moor out of Spain. But that would have to wait another four hundred years, during which time the legends of El Cid grew as Christian soldiers under the protection of Santiago Matamoros waged a holy war that seesawed southward as the Spanish kingdoms consolidated in the north, and the Way of Saint James, to Santiago de Compostela, became the most traveled pilgrimage route in the world. Victory over the Moors was achieved in 1492 by Ferdinand and Isabella. Their marriage had united Leon/Castile and Aragon, bringing the kingdoms that had grown out of Charlemagne’s marches into a unified Spain. With the Moors out of the way and Columbus on his way to the Indies, it is time to turn our attention to the consolidation of Catholic Spain and the cultural mythology that grew up around the unemployed conquistadors and their successors, like Cortés, who would carry it to the New World. Safe from harm and doubt, thanks to Santiago Matamoros, Catholic Spain had no need for scientific justifications. In spite of this, what we call today “blood quantum” became the cultural mechanism for state control and security, and the consolidation and cleansing of the new nation. It was a strange notion. In Baroque Spain, “blood quantum” was a religious concept equated with a natural propensity to accept Christ. Spanish blood, of course, endowed one with the highest propensity, while Moorish blood made it difficult for one to see the light. Bad blood could be overcome with great effort, but beyond a certain point, the absence of good blood would make conversion nearly impossible. Because of this, Moors who had accepted the gospel initially could remain in Spain. By 1515, however, laws were in place that required the removal of\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n29\n\nall Moors, as had been the case with Jews since 1492. Anyone lacking sufficient good blood had to go. Any bad blood, and it is safe to assume that everyone had some, could still corrupt the rest and ferment heresy inside a person, so the defense of the Church and the people required exceptional spiritual force, skill, and will— the Inquisition. Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro was born into this world in 1485. He set out for the Americas in 1504, carry ing with him all the heavy baggage of victorious Spanish Christendom. Guided and protected by Santiago Mataíndios (“Indian Slayer”), Cortés sailed from Cuba and landed on the coast of Mexico in 1519, hooked up with La Malinche (his female translator and guide), and made his way to Lake Texcoco, where our Old World road from the Mediterranean ends.\n\nAztlán to Texcoco It is certain that there were people living throughout central and southern Mexico before the Nahua and the Maya. What they contribute to the cultural mix might be roughly comparable to the pre-Roman peoples of Italy or pre-Carthaginian peoples of Spain and is equally hard to ascertain. Legends and accounts of the early Spanish chroniclers and modern revisionists all reveal a similar pattern. It is the general pattern framed in its mythical context, not the factual details, that is of interest here. The Chicano movement’s revival of the myth of Aztlán with a second “fertile crescent” formed by the Rio Grande and the Rio Gila seems like a good place to start. It is the legendary source of the migration of the Nahua peoples and of successive migrations southward to Anáhuac, the former lake basin areas of the Valley of Mexico, around what is today Mexico City. The Aztecs (Mexica) encountered by Cortés were the last of several Nahua groups to make the trip. Their conquest of the Valley of Mexico took place about the time of the Crusades in Europe. Their route followed the Pacific coast south to the homeland of the Tarascans, today Michoacán, whence they climbed up to the Central Mexican Plateau. By the fi fteenth century, they had consolidated their control of most of the plateau and exercised dominion over an extensive empire. Its capital, Tenochtitlán, was, during the 1400s, one of the largest cities in the world— some say the largest, while others say it was Córdoba. By any count, it was in the top seven and, according to Cortés, the cleanest and perhaps the most beautiful. Although it is probable that people came to the Americas by routes other than the land bridge, the official story told at the Museo Nacional de Antropología (National Museum of Anthropology) in Mexico City is based on the land bridge. Understandings of paths, numbers, magnitudes, accomplishments, consequences, and legends that grew out of the various southward migrations are varied and changing. Chroniclers, historians,\n\n30\n\nWirth\n\nand scientific observers of all kinds are plentiful along the full length of the route. For present purposes, Mexican chronicler Justo Sierra (1969) is the best guide for the New World roads that led to Lake Texcoco because his vantage point during the heady days of Porfi rio Díaz’s triumphant Mexicanism represents a mythical reality that provides continuity with legends of Santiago Matamoros in Spain up to the Mexican Revolution. Sierra’s mystical Mexican adventure, the details of which differ from accepted contemporary archeological and historical accounts, starts in the north. He tells of the population spreading southward over time. As some of the cliff dwellers of the Rio Grande/Rio Gila move eastward toward the land of the Mound Builders of the Mississippi River valley, others head down the Pacific coast. The Mound Builders move southward by land and sea. The seagoing groups settle the Antilles and move on to the Yucatán Peninsula to catalyze Mayan development, while the others move down the coast and up to the Central Mexican Plateau to the area of Teotihuacán. Those who move eastward out of the vicinity of the Rio Grande and Rio Gila merge with westward flows from the Mississippi Valley to form the Chichimeca and move southward through central Mexico. Had the Spaniards not destroyed their entire written record, it seems probable that the rise-and-fall stories of civilizations in the Central Mexican Plateau and the Yucatán Peninsula would be as intricate and inspiring as our “Romantic” notions of Mediterranean civilizations. By the middle of the first century BC, the Yucatán had become one of the most densely populated areas ever. Studies using the latest sensing technology support Sierra’s contention that “scarcely an inch of earth, it seems, was left uncultivated” (Sierra 1969, 36). After a succession of empires, alternating between those of Nahua peoples and others, the Nahuabased Toltec Empire (800–1200) emerged in the basin areas of the Valley of Mexico and spread to cover all of the ancient sites, including Teotihuacán. It set in motion new mythical and religious dynamics that continue to form the nexus of conflict at all levels down to the individual in Mexico to this day. The influence of Santiago Matamoros pales in the face of the mythical Quetzalcoatl, the god-king, prophet-saint of the Toltecs and of modern Mexico. Sometime around the tenth century AD, as Toltec civilization reached its pinnacle, the old blood rites, often associated with cannibalism, were replaced by a New World gospel of light. The social fissure opened by the reforms of Quetzalcoatl led to protracted civil war that was ultimately the undoing of the Toltecs. With the eventual triumph of evil over good, Quetzalcoatl departed, but promised to return. It’s hard to say whether or not the people of Tenochtitlán held the vision of a white god whose return was anticipated when Cortés arrived, but as it was told by subsequent clergy and chroniclers, there was no doubt.\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n31\n\nAs the Old World and New World paths drew ever closer to Anáhuac, the last wave of Nahua, the Aztecs, made their way up to the Central Mexican Plateau. By the eleventh century, they had settled around Lake Texcoco, eventually on two islands in the lake, after being involved in numerous intrigues and conflicts with the Tepaneca, who had emerged victorious out of the fray that undid the Toltecs. The Aztecs mixed and allied with the remnants of Tolteca and began to build their cities and wait for a new day. Their new day was ushered in by Montezuma I, who ruled the Aztec from 1440 to 1469, reestablished Nahua control of the whole Valley of Mexico, and scored military victories throughout the lands as far south as Guatemala. Although he established some colonies, he never attempted to consolidate his conquests. His main interest seemed to be the safety of Aztec merchants and the flow of goods to Tenochtitlán. Fifty years later, Cortés arrived at Anáhuac and entered the domain of Montezuma II. Accompanied by Santiago and wearing the mantle of Quetzalcoatl, he claimed the empire, the prize the conquistadors deserved for returning Spain to Christendom.\n\nMestizaje: The Birth of a Nation Cortés entered the game of musical chairs that had been going on for centuries in the Valley of Mexico. The general pattern seemed to revolve around triple alliances. An alliance would form to unseat a dominant power, after which one of the parties to the alliance would consolidate its power and emerge as the imperial center, only to be undone by the next alliance. Aztecs had consolidated their power, except for the Tlaxcalteca, who were waiting their turn to form the next alliance when Cortés arrived, recruited them, and started a new game. Wrapped in the myth of Quetzalcoatl and through the consummate use of terror and diplomacy, an isolated band of a few hundred Spaniards under the conquistador undid the last empire of Anáhuac. After the fall of Tenochtitlán, the rest of the empire and even the undefeated Tarascans fell like dominos. Within three years, victory was complete and with Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec emperor, reduced to a figurehead, Cortés began to build his capital on the ruins of Tenochtitlán. The revolution (the undoing of the understanding of “who we are”), precipitated by the wrath of the god-king Quetzalcoatl and the taking of the prize for Christendom, might have led to consolidation, but Cortés was fi rst and foremost the conquistador. When a challenge arose in the south, he felt compelled to launch what turned out to be an illfated campaign. By leaving the consolidation of the center to others, he broke the momentum. Completion of the revolution was left to future generations, and New Spain became the project of churchmen and bureaucrats.\n\n32\n\nWirth\n\nAlthough he recovered and eventually returned from Spain as the marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, Cortés’s moment had passed. He and La Malinche had a son named Martín (Krauze 1997), not the first mestizo but certainly the archetype. Accepted as a legitimate heir by the conquistador, he was educated in Spain, which included being in ser vice to the future king. He returned to Mexico with his half brother (better born), also Martín, the second marquis. As Martín the Mestizo, he helped spark the revolutionary struggle of blood and culture that continues today. As the officials of the Real Audiencia took over the government of New Spain, and the clerical orders set out to convert the Indians, the conquest of New Spain in what is today northern Mexico continued. But it was the Indians who lead the conquest. Wearing full armor and carrying the title of captain-general, Indigenous leaders set out to pacify the savage Chichimeca and secure mines and territories for the Crown, worn by the Holy Roman emperor. They rode, as the conquistadors before them, with Santiago and prepared the way for the new gospel of Quetzalcoatl. Cast into the revolutionary caldron, the friars wove a new and powerful mythology. Quetzalcoatl wasn’t Cortés or any other adventurer: he was Saint Thomas (the doubting disciple of Christ), who had moved on from his mission in India centuries before to bring Christianity to the Toltecs. Some versions have him doing Columbus in reverse, but most involve supernatural means. However he got to the Americas, when the Toltecs rejected his message, he departed in the company of the Virgin of Guadalupe to continue his work in the Yucatán. With the Virgin’s return in 1531, both of them were now back among the friars, at the head of the missionary forces consolidating the work of Santiago. With souls to save and evil to eradicate, the old order was re-created in New Spain and the question of “blood” re-emerged. Bartolomé de las Casas made the case for the Indians, essentially arguing “innocent blood,” but the other side took up the Reconquista position of “bad blood.” Although the Indians emerged innocent from the theological wars, they were defined as minor children until they could be trained up. This licensed the Creoles, those born in the Americas to the Spanish, to launch the exploitative caste system. The advantages conferred on whites (Creoles) by blood left the Indians with a status similar to minor children at the other pole of the main axis of mixing/non-mixing that centered on Martín Cortés (the Mestizo). Mestizaje became the center of the revolutionary struggle.\n\nBlack Legends The intensely religious nature of the struggles for emancipation and domination within Spain and between Spain and the rest of the world was conducive to a black-white dichotomy where the only test of virtue was\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n33\n\nvictory. Defeat arose from corruption and victory vindicated anything. Godlike heroes riding a string of triumphs became dev ils when they suffered a defeat, and contemporary problems were laid at the feet of the fallen as they were sucked into the caldron of the “Black Legend.” Cortés was vilified as he had vilified Montezuma and his priests. When his sons returned to Mexico and took up the cause of the Creoles, the second marquis of Oaxaca was arrested with his brother, Martín the Mestizo, and tortured by the Spanish authorities. The Mestizo was spared by the king and lived to see the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which ended the glory days and plunged Spain itself into the realm of the Black Legend as the British and Dutch painted it as retrograde, savage, and bloodthirsty.\n\nNew Spain Before the end of the eighteenth century, the creative and contending forces that would shape Mexico were in place. The Crown had used the Church as the means of pacification and Christianization of the Indians in New Spain. Sierra lays out the pattern of this enterprise by describing the career of the “Peacemakers” (the two apostles who landed in 1523 and the four great bishops: Bartolomé de las Casas, Juan de Zumárraga, Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal, and Vasco de Quiroga). It was officially launched when a contingent of twelve friars, the apostles, was sent to establish colonial outposts. Their numbers multiplied along with the area controlled by the orders, and they amassed wealth over the three centuries until independence. The land-use patterns resulting from their efforts were superimposed upon existing patterns produced by the conquest. Encomiendas had been established when the conquistadors distributed prerogatives and control over Indian labor in specific areas to their men. Their children, the Creoles, came to see themselves as the only legitimate heirs of the conquest and the natural nobility of New Spain. Interest and exclusivity put the Creoles at odds with the ecclesiastical Peacemakers, but their mythological baggage kept them loyal to the Church and the Crown. Finally, universities, established in conjunction with the evangelical and colonizing mission and shunned by the Creoles, became the breeding ground for a new mestizo intellectual class. As the mestizo population grew, these intellectuals were augmented by a petit bourgeois of mestizo shopkeepers and traders. The three elements combined in fruitful ways outside of the center, especially in Michoacán, but external forces in Europe kept the capital in turmoil. When I began this project, I assumed that wars and the displacements they caused would be the key factors, but it turns out to be not war, but marriage. The Hapsburgs had realized this long before Ferdinand and Isabella united the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile that sprang from Charlemagne’s marches. The imperial family of the Holy Roman Empire was\n\n34\n\nWirth\n\nquick to marry into the new line, and by the mid-sixteenth century, Hapsburgs were on the Spanish throne and Mexico was part of the Holy Roman Empire. Charlemagne’s empire, once the Kingdom of the Franks, had passed to Hapsburg control and, with the incorporation of the Low Countries through marriage, encircled Bourbon France. The result of the Hapsburgs’ successful marriage campaign was an empire that included the Low Countries, Portugal, Spain, the Hapsburg domains in the east, and holdings in Italy’s and Spain’s American colonies. Tensions caused by the encirclement of France, combined with the English plunder of gold on the high seas and growing Dutch discontent with their absentee Hapsburg rulers, resulted in continuous warfare that required an ever-larger flow of gold from the Spanish Main to Antwerp. The Hapsburg king of Spain responded with severe measures, involving special emissaries with absolute power and the Inquisition, to stem the insurrection in the north and extract needed resources from the Americas. Viceroys, visitors, bishops, and strong men from the Audiencias and other institutions parlayed success in amassing gold reserves into tremendous personal power, only to be displaced by a new appointee when the gold flow was insufficient. As the sixteenth century drew to a close, the Dutch achieved virtual independence during a truce in the Eighty Years’ War, but the Hapsburg Empire renewed its efforts to retain control of the Low Countries, which continued until 1648 when both the Thirty Years’ War and the Eighty Years’ War ended. Spain lost the Northern Netherlands, and the Spanish (or Southern) Netherlands were cut off from the sea when the Dutch closed the river to Antwerp. As the Westphalian world of the nation-state emerged, Hapsburg Spain was on the ropes. When the Bourbons, through marriage, seized the Spanish throne in 1714, it was over. As the clock ticked down to the French Revolution, the Bourbons completed the construction of the breeding ground for future “strong men” in the New World by introducing French-style centralized government and a standing army into Mexico. As things disintegrated under the pressure of the French Revolution, the British and Americans planned to take over and divide Spanish holdings in the Americas. These plans were upset not so much by Bonaparte’s success on the battlefield as by “family affairs.” Napoleon’s Caesarism made him an instant hit with the descendants of the conquistadors, but his replacement of the Spanish king with his brother Joseph was an assault on Spanish Christendom that could not be tolerated on either side of the ocean. This upheaval left Portugal open to conquest. The English, who could not resist the easy pickings, abandoned their projects in the Americas. Having been hermetically sealed in the bubble of the Reconquista for three hundred years, Mexicans could not accept the idea that they were subject to the will of the “people of Spain”: king, yes; committee, never! This, coupled with the scrapping of U.S./English plans for the\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n35\n\nrest of America, triggered the movement for independence in Mexico, which spread throughout Spanish America in 1810. As the strong-man tradition of military heroes and peacemakers alike turned messianic, the only test of virtue remained success, and the fallen kept the caldron of the Black Legend boiling. When independence was achieved after two decades of struggle, three contenders for the title “Father of the Country” were dead at the hands of their countrymen, and Mexico was under the protection of the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nMexicans, Mestizos, Mexicanism, and Mestizaje After independence the new nation began to work out its identity. To the north, the “Americans” were developing a national identity, “Americanism,” which incorporated considerable diversity in terms of European origins but would exclude slaves and what was left of the Indigenous peoples. In Mexico, the preponderance of the population was drawn from preconquest Indigenous civilizations. The United States of America spun off of the juggernaut of the British Empire while it was soaring to its heights, whereas the United States of Mexico was launched from the final crash that shattered the Spanish enterprise. Born of the Enlightenment, Americanism was built upon the new set of ideas that came to define the Age of Reason, whereas Mexicanism was built upon the cultural remains of two shattered empires and the first truly global system that had grown out of Rome and, in the end, centered on the Spanish Main, through which the wealth of the Far East and the Americas had been funneled to Europe and squandered in the death throes of the Old World order.\n\nRoads to Anáhuac Revisited Systems of representative government that have emerged out of the European Renaissance and Enlightenments have been classified by political analysts in many different ways. Fig. 1.1 presents three of the dominant types (elitist, corporatist, and pluralist) and a fourth (statist) as they relate to developmental conditions and processes. The cell labeled statist has been problematic. Statism is usually considered to be beyond the range of “democracy” and is omitted from consideration, but as observed earlier with the ideas of mestizaje and pluralism, unlike the other established types, the statist type has not been backed by corresponding normative and/or explanatory theories of democracy and civil society. As illustrated in fig. 1.1, England, Germany, France, and the United States are empirical examples of the modal types. Theories of corporatism, elitism, and pluralism are in place to explain the respective\n\n36\n\nWirth\n\n−\n\nEndogenous\n\nExogenous\n\nELITIST (Accommodation)\n\nPLURALIST (Assimilation)\n\nEngland\n\nUnited States\n\nCORPORATIST (Adaptation)\n\nSTATIST (Homogenization)\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nAccessibility +\n\nFigure 1.1. Western systems typology\n\npatterns of representative republican government and civil society, but comparable statist theories have yet to emerge. As a consequence, pluralist analyses have produced negative images of both France and Mexico. So far we have examined mestizaje in terms of its origins in Mexico. Now it will be contrasted with pluralism in the United States. Mexico must be located in the above matrix with the big four. Since a substantial portion of the Old World road to Anáhuac involved France, the developmental sketches of France and Mexico will be revisited in search of patterns upon which to base the elaboration of the required theoretical perspectives, place Mexico in the statist tradition, and lay the basis for a more comprehensive comparative framework and a better understanding of the differences between the United States and Mexico. The first task is to distinguish between different types of acculturation: the pluralist process of assimilation results in an incorporation of diverse individuals under a common creed, while the statist type rests on a more pervasive multidimensional mixing best characterized as homogenization. On the road to Anáhuac, we passed through France with the Vandals as Attila was making his push into Roman territory. At that time, Roman acculturation had been moving forward for over three hundred years. This Latinization was comparable to the Hispanicization of Mexico. Since both of these developments were completed before contemporary theorizing about democracy began during the settlement of North America, they were incorporated, along with feudalism, as part of the constellation of oppression targeted by Enlightenment thought. As the Enlightenment shifted the focus of attention from the corporate group to the individual, rational theories about the establishment and organization of societies began to challenge old notions of social order. Most of the theorists presented in fig. 1.2 based their rational orders (theories of human nature, society, and government) on speculation about\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n37\n\nHierarchical\n\nCooperative\n\nPre-state (evolution)\n\nAnti-state (progress)\n\nCONSERVATIVE (Burke)\n\nLIBERAL (Locke)\n\nStateless (cooperation)\n\nStatist (revolution)\n\nSOCIALIST (Rousseau)\n\nANARCHIST (Hobbes)\n\nCompetitive\n\nEgalitarian Figure 1.2. Democratization of cultures\n\npre-societal conditions in a “state of nature” and imagined that rational individuals had entered into contracts to improve their lot. The different conceptions of the original condition lead to competing conclusions about what is possible and desirable for organized human society. The first of these theorists emerged out of the turmoil (anarchy) of the English Civil War (1642–1651). For Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), the state of nature was war of “all against all” and “life was nasty, brutish and short.” The only sure cure was the all-powerful state. Such ideas were unattractive to Enlightenment thinkers, but being both rational and individualist, they set the mold for the more optimistic theorists who followed. As the Glorious Revolution brought a new king and prosperity to an England where Commons was supreme, John Locke (1632–1704) was able to imagine a more benign state of nature where people were basically nice and got on well most of the time, but scarcity could still cause problems. In these zero-sum and negative-sum instances, the state was needed as an impartial referee, but only in the case of irreconcilable differences between individuals. Because it served merely to ameliorate the already favorable conditions in the state of nature, the state had limited range and could not be allowed to exceed the bounds of necessity. Edmund Burke (1729–1797) defended tradition against notions of contracts, while Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) put forth a contract as the basis of a community. For him, it was not a question of individuals giving up the right of self-defense to create the state in order to secure better protection. Rather, the contract was a social agreement where each would surrender all rights in equal measure to all, making the defense of the rights of others the defense of one’s actual rights. Such an arrangement would not require a state. The conservative, liberal, and socialist cultures that are the basis of the partisan competitions in today’s representative\n\n38\n\nWirth\n\nsystems and of tomorrow’s utopian orders are supported by fully developed theories of society and popular sovereignty, but statism with its pre-modern roots is not. While Hobbes restated the case for the state in modern terms, the statist tradition, like its republican counterpart, dates back to ancient Rome. While the Anglo world became attached to Roman constitutionalism, which called into question the legitimacy of Caesar’s power, the Latin world, and subsequently the Hispanic world, focused on his imperium (the absolute authority of the commander in the field). Under the Roman Republic, sovereignty of command could only be exercised beyond the boundary of Rome, but within the city, various magistrates bore imperium in their persons while in office and exercised it in the context of a hierarchy and a system of checks and balances. The exception to this was the granting of emergency power to a dictator who held absolute power (imperium) over all officials, even in the city. Such power was constitutionally limited to six months, but Caesar ultimately became dictator for life. Was he ambitious? Did he subvert the constitution? Or was he above it and politics, protecting the city as his most recent successor, Charles de Gaulle, and subsequent presidents of France protect their country? Dictator (President) for Life carries an ancient, sometimes honorable heritage, but today “dictator” has become the favorite pejorative in the United States. It has replaced the Black Legend as the mechanism for villainizing and controlling foreign states and leaders. This approach seems to have become current in the Porfirio Díaz era and is now the favorite, not only of Americans but also of constitutionalists everywhere. Dictators often hide behind sham constitutions and elections, but true republicans can detect such deceptions and protect the peoples of the world from them. Such threats to the freedom of the Mexican people have been a constant concern of American policy makers, especially after the Mexican Revolution of 1910.\n\nThe Latin World The world of Caesar’s imperium included all of the Celtic peoples of continental Europe. As with Italy, their incorporation was complete. They became Roman and spoke Latin. Although there was no great physiological distinction between the people of Italy and Gaul, the Celtic tongues had to give way to Latin to forge a single Roman patrimony that would eventually center on France and persist in various forms to the dawn of the twentieth century. Spain, as part of the Carthaginian and Islamic domains during the Roman era, was never fully incorporated, although Spanish, like French and Italian, is a Romance language. France and Italy became the Latin world. But the Americas are a different story. It was Spanish that became the imperial language and the\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n39\n\nglue of the new nations, not Latin. Spain and the imperium of the conquistadors should get the credit, not the Romans (Esteva-Fabregat 1995).\n\nThe New World Although Spanish and Portuguese are the languages of most of the nations of Latin America, only in Mexico do we find conditions for Hispanization that are comparable to those of Latinization in Roman Gaul. Cortés’s conquest of New Spain is even more spectacular than Caesar’s of Gaul, and the catastrophic depopulation of Mexico combined with the lack of immigration created a situation that produced patterns of consolidation and governance similar to those of Gaul. Admittedly, the problem of creating a new race from the remnants of several old ones in a depopulated area is more difficult than melting together remnants of dispersed groups to consolidate their land base, but both Romans and Spaniards faced similar problems and, consequently, followed similar paths. The argument here is that the Latinization in Europe that produced contemporary French culture and institutions is similar to the Hispanicization that produced the Mexican institutions and culture. In both cases the result is a political culture based on identity and propelled by a revolutionary ethic that emphasizes equality for all, unlike pluralism with its emphasis on interests and individual freedom.\n\nContemporary Paths Mestizaje is primarily an endogenous phenomenon, whereas pluralism is exogenous. The division here seems to be mostly between settlers and agents of acculturation. It was never a question of Romans clearing the land and settling Gaul. When Augustus set up the colonial towns of his Roman Empire, the goal was acculturation and incorporation of the Indigenous population, as was the case with the missions in Mexico. In both cases, over a period of about three hundred years, the imperial language gave a new nation its identity. As endogenous myths grew up around universal Christendom, the Holy See provided the glue that held both together during their transition into the post-Westphalian world and precipitated in both protracted struggles against clerical domination. Settlers in what is today the United States, on the other hand, were looking for a new home because of population pressure, displacement, or cultural conflict. Born in the Age of Reason and the era of the nationstate, many of the settlements were founded by radical Protestant groups seeking religious freedom. For them this meant freedom to establish their own exclusive religious political order and precluded freedom for\n\n40\n\nWirth\n\nanyone who disagreed. Colonial governments were not characterized by tolerance; many sought out heretics with zeal equal to that of the Inquisition. For Indigenous peoples, it was conversion or eradication. Pluralism as elaborated by James Madison (Dahl 1967) became the mechanism for forging stability and unity out of this chaos. As applied to religion, it comes down to this: the more sects there are and the more radical they are, the better. All that is required is that they be divested of police power—separation of church and state— so that individuals can live anywhere, join any sect, and start new ones as they wish. All churches and non-churches remain active in the political arena, but they can’t hang Quakers in Massachusetts anymore. Tax law provides for the official pluralistic establishment, and the faithful are out fighting for truth, justice, and their American Way: “Interest cancels interest and the whole remains undisturbed.” There are no more popes, kings, or dictators, not even the sovereign people: only the individual and the rational pursuit of selfinterest, a new mythical basis for the “First New Nation” (Lipset 1996).\n\nStatist France France and Mexico were established cultural entities before the upheavals that ushered in modernity. Rather than building anew, they had to adapt to change as it took place around them. On the Old World road to Anáhuac, we passed quickly through France a couple of times on the way to Spain. It’s time to go back to what was happening there. During the four hundred years that Rome survived after Caesar, Christianity became the state religion. Over time Catholicism gelled into the glue of Latin Gaul. As the last vestiges of Roman authority crumbled, the Franks began to consolidate in Belgium, and, ultimately, in the late fifth century, Clovis converted to Roman Catholicism and united all of France under his rule. This established the state so firmly upon the three hundred years of acculturation that two hundred years of feuding among his sons and successors could not undo it. During this time, the Western Empire had all but disappeared and Italy had been overrun. In the face of this pressure on their way of life, a new dynasty emerged in France to contain the Moors, preserve Christendom, and, ultimately, under Charlemagne, establish the Holy Roman Empire. Imperium and Universal Christendom returned to the West when he was crowned emperor in 800 at Rome. After royal succession had been securely established in Catholic France, the battle over emperorship shifted to the east. The pressure of events and ideas (the Enlightenment) fi nally sparked a revolution in France that sought a return to republicanism and made the people the vessel of sovereignty. This was the beginning of the French cultural adaptation to modernity. Extremism, chaos, and misery that followed revolutionary upheaval\n\nThe Revolutionary Encounter\n\n41\n\nwere finally contained by a return to imperium. Military prowess translated into governing power as Bonaparte became First Counsel of the French Republic for Life and ultimately Emperor"
