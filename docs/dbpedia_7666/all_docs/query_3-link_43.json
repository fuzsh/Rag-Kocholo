On the heels of last year's unjust car impoundment victory, hundreds of community members and allies are expected to turn out on this International Workers' Rights Day to demand real and immediate positive change.\n\nThe May 1 event will highlight two campaigns: meaningful and immediate public education reform, and state driver's licenses for all. This May Day also coincides with the janitors' struggle for a fair labor contract.\n\n\"Janitors are currently fighting to maintain dignified wages and full family healthcare,\" says Marisol Rivera, Vice President of SEIU-USWW Orange County. \"In order for Orange County to prosper, hard-working families cannot continue to be held back. Many of our members are parents and as all parents, they want a better future for their kids. We are in this fight not just for ourselves, but for future generations.\"\n\nThroughout the State of California, 18,000 janitors with the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW) are campaigning for a new contract. The current contract expires on April 30, 2012. In Orange County, approximately 1,500 janitors are impacted by this master contract negotiation.\n\nSince 2001, California has cut the budget for higher education yearly forcing all schools systems to find ways to cut costs and find other revenue sources.[1] \"School districts in the K-12 system have responded to state budget cuts by firing teachers, increasing class sizes, cutting programs, cutting summer school, and emphasizing standardized tests,\" says Carolyn Torres, Education Chair of Chican@s Unidos. \"California's refusal to prioritize and invest in public education has made education inaccessible and unattainable to a whole generation of our youth.\"\n\nIn response, the Orange County May Day Coalition, with Chican@s Unidos leading the effort, has declared a State of Emergency on public education. \"We demand that the educational crisis be treated with urgency and provided the necessary resources to make California a state where education is for all,\" says Torres.\n\nThe State stands to benefit from the issuance of driver's licenses to all Californians regardless of immigration status. Approximately 2.6 million Californians are undocumented[2], and if 2.6 million people are able to obtain a driver's license upon the completion of proper training and testing, California roadways would be safer, more drivers would have insurance, and the State would generate income from the collection of fees and taxes from these additional licensed drivers.\n\n\"All Californians have the ability to improve the economy and public safety, and the State should not only recognize this but should support these efforts. We ask that our state legislators do the right thing and make no delay in ensuring all Californians are able to get a driver's license,\" says Abraham Flores Rojas, Co-founder of Resistencia, Autonomia, Igualdad, Liderazgo (RAIZ).\n\nThe May Day event will begin with a program of education and entertainment at 2 p.m. at Sasscer Park located at 4th and Ross Streets. A march and post-march program will follow. This event is organized by the Orange County May Day Coalition, and is free and open to the public.\n\nLast year, the May Day event drew over 300 participants and after a nearly year-long campaign, the Orange County May Day Coalition, in collaboration with the Orange County Congregation Community Organization (OCCCO), won a new impound policy in the City of Santa Ana, the first of its kind in the County. The new policy has reduced impounds by 75%, according to Santa Ana Police Department statistics.\n\nThe Orange County May Day Coalition is a community-centered coalition of organizations and individuals; member organizations include Chican@s Unidos, DeColores Queer OC, El Centro Cultural de MÃ©xico, OC DREAM Team, OC Peace Coalition, Occupy Santa Ana, RAIZ, SEIU-USWW, and Tonantzin Collective.\n\nFor more information, visit http://ocmdc.org.\n\n### [1] http://keepcaliforniaspromise.org\n\n[2] http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2010.pdf With the recent announcement from CA Attorney General stating that secure communities is optional, we want to let OC sheriff to take the same stand as LA Sheriff Lee Baca.

The first important announcement was made by California Attorney General Kamala Harris as she made it clear that Secure Communities is optional for local law enforcement. This was followed by Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and Los Angeles Police Commission stating publicly that they would no longer comply with Secure Communities. As important as these statements have been, the bigger issue is the existence of 287(g) agreements and the aforementioned program. Such collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has created an environment of fear within the immigrant community. Our community has not felt safe when dealing with police authorities, and by collaborating with ICE, the rift between community and law enforcement grows wider. With these programs, those that end up in deportation proceedings are mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons, not hardened criminals.\n\nWe demand you make a similar announcement regarding Secure Communities and that you end your 287(g) agreements with ICE. By you working with ICE, you are not making our community safer, but rather exacerbating the fear and resentment that already exists towards law enforcement. Your mission statement states that your department is Ã¢ÂÂdedicated to the protection of ALLÃ¢ÂÂ and your vision statement reads that our Ã¢ÂÂtrustÃ¢ÂÂ is your Ã¢ÂÂlegacy.Ã¢ÂÂ If you truly want the community to trust your department, the first step should be a public statement in support of the recently re-introduced Transparency and Responsibility Using State Tools Act (TRUST Act), a bill that would set guidelines regarding Secure Communities and help ensure that our community is truly secure. Nationally, the debate around immigration has been one of criminalizing communities and dehumanizing hard working people who are not criminals. Again, we demand that you not contribute to the continuous criminalization and dehumanization of our community through Secure Communities and 287(g) agreements.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(See also ocprogressiveevents.info/archive/2009.html#NOTICE)\n\nADVICE FOR CONGRESS (TO THE TUNE OF \"SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN\") Verse: You'd better watch out, you'd better not lie, our middle class tax cuts better not die.

(Chorus) Fiscal drop-offs loom ahead; Filling working folks with dread; Programs bleeding, debt proceeding; going further in the red. Something in the budget must give; We make less than we need to live; Put an end to corporate hand-outs ÃÂ it's money right through a sieve. (Chorus) Don't take knives to our Medicare; Workers paid in ÃÂ how can you dare? Tax the wealthy incomes healthy enough to pay their fair share. (Chorus) CEOS want Medicaid's pie They'll make profits while people die Health care shouldn't be a luxury only the rich can buy. (Chorus) ## Twelve days of budget cuts On the first day of budget cuts our Congress gave to me, A cut in SoCIAL Security.

The corporations tell you that the way to fix the debt; Is give the wealthy even more and kill the safety net; But stealing from retirees is not the smartest bet; Oh please vote with your conscience this one time, just this one time Oh please vo-te with your conscience this one time. The Medicare insurance plan is one they'd like to ax; Employer matching funds to them are just another tax; But balancing a budget can't be done on old folks backs; Oh please vote with your conscience this one time, just this one time Oh please vo-te with your conscience this one time. They want you to cut Medicaid so they won't have to pay; Repealing Obamacare will keep their tax at bay; The rich have skated long enough it's time we had a say; Oh please vote with your conscience this one time, just this one time Oh please vo-te with your conscience this one time. The Kochs have gotten tax breaks for importing foreign oil; While no jobs were created for the folks on our own soil; The trickle theory doesnÃÂt work despite how hard we toil; Oh please vote with your conscience this one time, just this one time Oh please vo-te with your conscience this one time. So let the wealthy tax cuts go ÃÂ they've still got Cayman's cash; And save the breaks for working folks so savings we can stash; In banks here in America ÃÂ to help avoid a crash; Oh please vote with your conscience this one time, just this one time Oh please vo-te with your conscience this one time.

David Fraccaro and incubated by the Detention Watch Network.\n\nToday, CIVICÃ¢ÂÂs grassroots, volunteer-based network is vast and growing, with the goal of starting 18 new visitation programs in the next 2 years. With coordinated actions occurring during the month of December in YOUR CITY, STATE, and X other cities, CIVIC advocates are rising up to address the serious effects the U.S. immigration detention system has on human life.\n\nÃ¢ÂÂThis holiday season while people across the country gather with friends and relatives in celebration, thousands of families will be torn apart by immigration detention,Ã¢ÂÂ said Christina Fialho, co-founder/executive director of CIVIC. Ã¢ÂÂAt this very moment, over 32,000 men and women are languishing in our nationÃ¢ÂÂs jails and prisons even though they are not in criminal custody. Furthermore, immigrants detained have no right to a court-appointed attorney, a free phone call, or visitation.Ã¢ÂÂ\n\nCIVIC fights for a right to visitation and connects detained immigrants to a community of support and advocacy on the outside. These innovative visitation programs offer not only friendship, but also connections to legal, medical, and post-release support. Visitation programs create a consistent community presence in otherwise invisible detention facilities, placing CIVIC volunteers in a unique and vital position to protect the human rights of detained immigrants and ensure each person remains connected to the outside world.\n\nThis month, visitor volunteers are supporting hundreds of immigrants, like Ana who was detained for over a year even though she was a victim of human trafficking. Her experience highlights the unnecessary cruelty that plagues the civil immigration detention system. She was torn away from her 8-year old daughter, sexually assaulted by male guards, and thrown into solitary confinement. CIVIC ended AnaÃ¢ÂÂs isolation and abuse by visiting her weekly for over a year, connecting her to an attorney, and reuniting her with her 8-year old daughter.\n\nToday, the Friends of Orange County Detainees and CIVIC demand that the public have a legally protected right to visit and support immigrants in detention.Ã¢ÂÂ said Jan Meslin, Coordinator, Friends of Orange County Detainees.\n\nTo celebrate this Month of Action, CIVIC is hosting a kick-off virtual fundraiser to raise $15,000 by the end of the year, with all proceeds going toward the creation of 3 new visitation programs in 3 months.
