        "text": "In 2021, as we made our way through the second year of a global pandemic, there were amazing people in Orange County who saved lives, raised funds for those in need and educated the county’s future.\n\nWe also witnessed incredible creativity and talent. In one case, the only comparison was to a legend who dominated nearly 100 years ago, and even that failed to capture what the Angels’ Shohei Ohtani accomplished. Spoiler alert: He made our list of top influencers.\n\nOhtani is joined by many other names and faces you’ll know, but the Orange County Register also uses this annual recognition to highlight people who quietly did things that made our lives better, safer or more enjoyable. We gladly were swayed by arguments many of our readers made, so much so that we decided to increase our list from 100 honorees to 125 this year.\n\nAnd just because some people didn’t make the list this year, that doesn’t mean they’re any less important than in a year when they did. Orange County has 3.2 million people, and we try to mix it up a bit.\n\nHere is our list of the 125 Orange County influencers we thought you should know from 2021:\n\nLinda Akutagawa\n\nAs one of 14 members of California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, Linda Akutagawa is overseeing the contentious process of drawing new boundaries for state and federal districts.
