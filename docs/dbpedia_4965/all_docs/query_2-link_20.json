        "text": "MONDAY 4 - 15 - 24\n\nPRETTY COOL MORNING TO MEET UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND / TEACHER.\n\nI HAVE BEEN WRITING THIS BLOG FOR 25+ YEARS WITH ABOUT 1500 DAILY READERS. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. MANY OF YOU ASK ABOUT MY ROUTINE. WELP , I'LL SAY IT AGAIN , \" IT'S HARD WORK AND WORKOUT \".......THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY MOTTO.\n\nEARLY MORNING AT F45 GYM FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS. OF COURSE JUST AS I AM ABOUT TO LEAVE I SEE MY FORMER SENSEI J.C. COME THROUGH THE DOOR. IT WAS SO FUNNY AS I BOW TO HIM WHEN LEAVING. WE TALK AND HE INVITES ME BACK TO HIS DOJO TO HELP HIM TEACH A CLASS. FOR YEARS I DID THIS BUT IT WAS AN HONOR TO BE INVITED BY HIM. AIKIDO IS MY FAVORITE AND BEING WITH HIS CLASS AT MAIN LINE JUDO WAS A BLAST. I GOT TO SHOW MY METHODS TO HIS LITTLE KIDS UP TO OLDER ADULTS. THEY THREW EACH OTHER AROUND LIKE THE OLD DAYS. MAN , DO I MISS TEACHING.\n\nROLL HOME TIRED BUT FEEL GOOD. WELL , NOT TOO GOOD AS MY TEACHER FRIEND SAID \" WATCH WEIGHT \" LIKE IN A MR. MIYAGI VOICE. I AM 290 POUNDS SO HE IS RIGHT. ANYWAY , I SHOWER , SHAVE , AND BEGIN TO MY COMPUTER WORK.\n\nMONDAYS ARE LONG DAYS BECAUSE I SEND OUT \" THANK YOU \" EMAILS TO ALL THE BANDS THAT PLAYED OVER THE WEEKEND. FRIDAY WE DID 122 FANS AND SATURDAY WE DID 160 FANS. THERE WERE FUN NIGHTS. THE NAIL HAS BEEN ON A ROLL AVERAGING A LITTLE OVER 100 PEOPLE EVERY WEEKEND. I ALWAYS SAY \" HARD WORK \" PAYS OFF.\n\nNEXT WAS GROUP EMAILING THE BANDS PLAYING THIS WEEK. ANOTHER 25 BANDS ARE COMING THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CONTINUE TO AVERAGE 2+ BANDS A DAY THAT CONTACT US BUT IT MEANS SO MUCH. I GROUP EMAIL EVERYONE AND BANDS RESPOND IMMEDIATELY THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. ALL SHOWS ARE NOW RECORDED , PREPPED , AND READY. COMMUNICATION IS KEY. THIS WILL BE A LONG WEEK BUT...................I AM THINKING OF HEADING NORTH.\n\nI WANT TO DO ONE MORE THING. LAST NIGHT I SPENT OVER 2 HOURS LOOKING FOR A TRAILER TIRE AND RIM. I RECEIVED OVER 100 EMAILS AND TEXTS ON MY ADVENTURE WITH MULCH , RAIN , AND TRAILER SEVERAL DAYS AGO. THIS MORNING I LIFTED THE TRAILER SIDEWAYS AND PLACED IT ON ITS EDGE. LIFTING THIS 400-500 POUND TRAILER IS NO EASY FEAT BY YOURSELF. I GOT THE RIM AND TIRE OFF TO GET EXACT NUMBERS I NEEDED. I SPEND ANOTHER 2 HOURS SEARCHING AND CALLING TIRE RETAIL STORES. I FINALLY GET ONE IN NEWARK , NEW JERSEY. I PURCHASE 2 RIMS AND 2 TIRES THAT THE SALES REP GUIDED ME TO. BOTH OF US FEEL THIS IS THE RIGHT REPLACEMENTS FOR MY TRAILER.\n\nNEXT I LOAD UP MY CAR WITH TOOLS , LUGGAGE , AND SOME WINE. I HEAD NORTH TO MEET UP WITH WHEELS AND MY YOUNGEST. I SHOULD OF BEEN THERE ON SUNDAY BUT I MADE DO. THIS WAS A NICE GET-AWAY. I ARRIVE IN GREAT TIME TO 75 DEGREES. I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS HERE. I SAY IT 20 TIMES THROUGH OUT THE DAY AND NIGHT. WE UNLOAD AND I SURPRISE THEM BY BUYING LUNCH AT A FAVORITE LOCAL PIZZERIA CALLED JIREH'S.\n\nI SETTLE IN AND DO SOME MORE BAND WORK AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FOR THE MUSIC HERE THIS WEEKEND. IT IS 24/7 WITH ME.\n\nI WATCH SOME TV AND TRY TO NAP. IT NEVER REALLY WORKS.\n\nI DO A 2ND CARDIO WORKOUT AND WALK WITH MY YOUNGEST AND PUP AROUND THE LAKE. AGAIN , ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HERE.\n\nBACK HOME AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR WE DECIDE TO VISIT A LOCAL PUB WE LIKE FOR DINNER. IT IS FUN AND I TELL MY YOUNGEST THERE IS A PRETTY FUN BLUE GRASS SONG NAMED \" BLACK BETTY \" BY RAM JAM. THIS SONG HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE AND THE LEAD SINGER WAS SO HONORED IT GOT A RE-BOOT AND WENT VIRAL. ANYWAY A GUY SHOOTING POOL HEARD ME PLAYING A PART OF THIS SONG TO MY KID SO HE PLAYS IT ON THE JUKE BOX. GIVE IT A LISTEN IT'S PRETTY FOOT STOMPIN' COOL.\n\nWE ROLL OUT AND DRIVE THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL LAKE DEVELOPMENT CALLED AGMAR. MAN SOME COOL HOMES AND THEIR LAKE IS 3X THE SIZE OF OURS.\n\nI DRIVE BACK HOME AND ENTER THE DEVELOPMENT. I PULL OVER AND LET MY YOUNGEST DRIVE AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT. WE SEE BEAUTIFUL HOMES AND DEER.\n\nAT HOME WE SETTLE IN. WE PLAY SOME CARDS ON THE DECK OVERLOOKING THE LAKE AND WE GET VISITED BY A NEIGHBOR AND HIS DOG. THE TWO PUPS RUN AROUND AND PLAY WHICH IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING.\n\nTHEY WATCH AMERICAN IDOL FOR 2 HOURS WHILE I DO COMPUTER WORK , WATCH THE PHILLIES WIN IN 10 INNINGS , COMMUNICATE WITH BANDS , AND PLAY A GAME OF POKER.\n\nAT 10PM WE WATCH AN EPISODE OF DEATH AND OTHER DETAILS. IT WAS VERY GOOD. WE HAVE ONE MORE EPISODE OT FINISH THE SERIES.\n\nEARLIER THEY WATCHED PEAKY F'N BLINDERS. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME THEY ARE WATCHING THIS 6 SEASON SHOW.\n\nFLYERS ARE OUT OF THE PLAY-OFFS SINCE EVERY TEAM ABOVE THEM WON.\n\nALL OF US HEAD TO BED AROUND 11PM-ISH. THE PUP JOINS ME TO WATCH SOME TV. FOR SOME REASON I SLEPT PRETTY DAMN GOOD TONIGHT.....AS PEOPLE READING THIS BLOG KNOW THAT IS RARE.\n\nTUESDAY 4 - 16 - 24\n\nSTART MORNING WALKING AROUND LAKE AND THAN MORNING JOG. AFTER THAT DID SOME GYM STUFF AT A LOCAL PLACE I LIKE UP HERE. I HAVE TO ADMIT THE SPEED BAG IS MY FAVORITE.\n\nBACK HOME AROUND 7AM I START MY DAY. I WONDER WHEN OTHER PEOPLE START THEIR DAY ?\n\nI CONSTANTLY CHECK BAND EMAILS AND RESPOND. I DO THIS 24/7 ALL DAY EVERY DAY USUALLY UP MIDNIGHT......EVERY.........DAY ( THIS INCLUDES WEEKENDS ). I WONDER WHAT OTHER VENUE OWNERS DO ? TO ME , QUICK COMMUNICATION WITH DETAILS IS THE KEY TO GOOD SHOWS AND HAVING A GOOD REP. IN 30 YEARS I ONLY HAD A HANDFUL OF BANDS THAT WERE VERY BAD AT COMMUNICATING. THIS ALWAYS EQUATES TO BAD ATTENDING SHOWS. I ALWAYS SAY , \" THE NAIL HAS HOSTED NOT 100'S OF BANDS BUT 1000'S. \" THIS IS WHERE I GAINED EXPERIENCE AND DATA OVER THE LAST 3 DECADES. DATA NEVER LIES.\n\nA SURPRISE VISITOR IN WHICH I ONLY SAW HIS BOBBING HEAD AND RED NECK. HE WAS STRUTTING ALONG OUR DECK AND I COULD SEE HIM THROUGH THE SPINDLES. HE SAW ME AND REVERSED TO OUR DRIVEWAY. I GOT A NICE LITTLE VIDEO AND POSTED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA OF THIS VERY SHY AND LARGE............TURKEY. FUNNY , I OWN SEVERAL GUNS AND CARRY BUT ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT HE BE SUCH A GOOD DINNER. BUT I LET HIM GO.\n\nMORE COMPUTER WORK , SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF , AND CALLING BANDS.\n\nI POST A LARGE SOCIAL MEDIA AD FOR ALL 22 BANDS PLAYING THIS WEEK. IT TAKES ME ABOUT 2 HOURS TO DO. I DO THIS EVERY WEEK FOR ALL BANDS PLAYING HERE. MOST BANDS (95%) POST EVENT PAGES AND MORE....BUT NOT ALL.\n\nOUR ELDEST TOLD ME BANDS / ACTS CAN BUY \" FOLLOWERS \" ON INSTAGRAM TO MAKE THEMSELVES \" LOOK \" BIGGER LIKE A NATIONAL ACT. I GOOGLE IT AND DAMN IF IT WASN'T TRUE. GOOGLE SAID TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A TRUE FOLLOWING OF 25K OR MORE GO TO SEVERAL OF THEIR POSTS. IF THE BAND HAS ONLY 10-20 \" LIKES \" OR COMMENTS MOST LIKELY THAT BAND BOUGHT FOLLOWERS. MAN , YOU LEARN SOMETHING EVERY DAY. I DON'T GET WHY THE FUCK WOULD ANYONE DO THIS ? ACTUALLY , I DO KNOW AND IT BE COMMON SENSE WHY ACTS WOULD DO THIS.\n\nPHILLIES WITH A NICE PITCHING PERFORMANCE FOR A COMPLETE GAME AND 5 - 0 WIN BY RANGER SAUREZ.\n\nFLYERS LOSE AND ARE OUT OF THE PLAY-OFFS.\n\nI TAKE A 2ND WALK WITH OUR YOUNGEST AND PUP AROUND THE LAKE. WE ALSO WALKED BACK TO CREEKS WITH LITTLE WATERFALLS AND THE WOODS BEHIND THE HOUSE. I HAVE NOT BEEN BACK THERE IN A WHILE. WE VISITED A TINY POND WITH FROG JELLY EGGS....SOME WERE HATCHING TADPOLES.\n\nBACK HOME AFTER OUR 2ND WALK/WORKOUT WE HEAD TO THE BRASS BUCKLE FOR A MEXICAN DINNER. OVERALL , A VERY GOOD DINNER AND DRINKS WITH AN ADORABLE WAITRESS. BUT.........2 THINGS. ONE - THE ASIAN BEEF TACO HAD 2 LARGE PIECES OF UNCHEWABLE MEAT AND SUPER FATTY. I HAD TO PUT THE PIECES IN A NAPKIN. 2ND.......IT WAS VERY PRICEY.\n\nBACK HOME WE SETTLE IN AND PLAY CARDS ON THE DECK OVER LOOKING THE LAKE. IT WAS FUN WITH MUSIC PLAYING AND GETTING A VISIT FOR OUR PUP......ANOTHER PUP NAMED \" BALOO \". THEY WERE ADORABLE PLAYING TOGETHER.\n\nWE WATCH THE FINALE EPISODE OF DEATH AND OTHER DETAILS. IT WAS GOOD. WE ALSO WATCHED PEEKY F'N BLINDERS (2ND TIME AROUND) AND COMMUNITY. ALL WERE GOOD.\n\nTHEY HEAD TO BED AND I CHECK BAND EMAILS AT MIDNIGHT. YEP , NOT SURE IF ANY OTHER VENUE OWNERS DO THIS BUT I DO.......24......FRICKIN'...........7.\n\nHEAD TO BED WITH THE PUP AND SLEEP DECENT.\n\nWEDNESDAY 4 - 17 - 24\n\nTHAT'S A FIRST.........\n\nPEOPLE THESE DAYS ALWAYS POINT FINGERS AT OTHER PEOPLE FOR THEIR PROBLEMS.....VERY RARELY AT THEMSELVES. I'VE ALWAYS SAID , \" POINT IT AT YOURSELF FIRST \".\n\nA NICE DOUBLE WALK AROUND THE HOUSE AND OUR ROAD WHICH IS A LOOP SHAPED LIKE A LIGHT BULB. IT WAS VERY NICE.\n\nMY NORMAL ROUTINE OF WORK , WORKING OUT , AND EMAILING BANDS. MAN , IT IS ALL I DO. OK , THAT IS NOT TRUE.\n\nTALK WITH OUR ELDEST. I THINK IT WAS A GOOD TALK.\n\nPHILLIES WITH THE BEST BULLPEN IN BASEBALL ALMOST BLOW A 7 - 1 LEAD. THEY WIN 7 - 6.\n\n76ERS WITH A VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE COME BACK WIN OVER A GOOD TEAM. THEY BEAT THE HEAT BY 1 POINT.\n\nI STEP OUTSIDE ON THE DECK AND IMMEDIATELY AND UNDENIABLE NOTICE OUR MOST FAVORITE AMERICAN BIRD. A.......FRICKIN'..................EAGLE !!!! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS I EVER SAW AN EAGLE HERE. I TAKE A FAR PICTURE OF IT PERCHED ON A TREE BRANCH OVER HANGING THE LAKE'S PATH. IT FLIES AWAY AND I NEVER GOT TO VIDEO IT. I DID HAVE TIME TO LET WHEELS SEE IT.\n\nDEER EVERY MORNING IS ALWAYS COOL. THEY ARE LITERALLY JUST FEET FROM OUR FRONT DECK.\n\nA VISIT FROM OUR NEIGHBOR AND HIS PUP. THE 2 DOGS PLAYED A BIT.\n\nMY YOUNGEST PURCHASED A PIECE OF ARTWORK FROM A FLEE MARKET SEVERAL DAYS AGO. SHE DECIDED TO PAINT THE FRAME A DIFFERENT COLOR. I HELPED. IT CAME OUT NICE.\n\nOFF TO ISTANBUL GRILL FOR DINNER IN WILKES BARRE. WE LIKE TRYING DIFFERENT PLACES AND THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD. THE RESTAURANT HAS COOL DECOR , GOOD SERVICE , GOOD FOREIGN FOOD , AND BYOB. WE ALSO HUGGED OUR WAITRESS GOODBYE WHEN LEAVING. THIS WAS A COOL EXPERIENCE.\n\nI CHECK IN ALL NIGHT AT THE NAIL FOR OUR ELDEST IS RUNNING THE SHOW BY HERSELF.\n\nWE SETTLE IN AT HOME WITH THE PUP. WE WATCH A MOVIE WITH JOHN CENA CALLED RICKY STANICKY. IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND SOME FUNNY PARTS. WE ALSO WATCH AN EPISODE OF COMMUNITY. I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY TO GOOD.\n\nWHEELS AND YOUNGEST HEAD TO BED.\n\nI CHECK BAND EMAILS , PLAY A GAME OF POKER , AND WATCH HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PHILLIES AND 76ERS.\n\nI HEAD TO MY BEDROOM AND THE PUP FOLLOWS LATER AROUND 2AM. I WATCHED A LITTLE TV BUT SOON TURNED IT OFF.\n\nTHURSDAY 4 - 18 - 24\n\nIT'S TIME........AGAIN.\n\nSTART MORNING WITH NORMAL ROUTINE. I SPEND ABOUT 40 MINUTES SECURING A LARGE ART WORK FRAME MY YOUNGEST PAINTED YESTERDAY. I RE-INSTALLED THE FRAME AND PAINTED IT A 5TH COAT. I THINK IT CAME OUT NICE.\n\nUSING A HAIR DRYER I HEAT UP TWO FLOOR TILES IN THE KITCHEN. THE HEAT RE-ACTIVATES THE GLUE. I REMOVE THEM EASILY AND RE-LAY THEM. IT CAME OUT NICE.\n\nI BEGIN MY LOADING OF THE CAR. I NEED TO HEAD HOME FOR A SHOW AT THE NAIL. I HATED LEAVING BUT DUTY CALLS. I TRULY THINK , BREATHE , AND WORK 24/7 ON NAIL SHOWS AND BANDS.\n\nI MAKE VERY GOOD TIME AND DECIDE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE NAIL BEFORE UNLOADING. I PREP FOR THE NIGHT.\n\nAT HOME I UNLOAD AND SETTLE IN. I IMMEDIATELY GO TO EMAILS. IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS I HAVE 12 NEW EMAILS.\n\nI WALK UPSTAIRS TO PRINT OUT BAND SHEETS. I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND WAS SLIGHTLY WINDED. I SAID TO MYSELF , \" YEP , IT IS TIME TO RE-DIET AND EAT SMART AGAIN \" THE 40 POUNDS I LOST 1 YEAR AGO AND PUT RIGHT BACK ON. I LOVED FITTING INTO OLDER SHIRTS AND PANTS BACK THAN AND NOW I MUST DO IT ALL OVER. THIS IS A SPINNING CIRCLE THAT NEVER ENDS.\n\nIT IS SO HARD TO BALANCE LOVING FOOD AND DRINK OVER BEING HEALTHY AND LIKING HOW YOU FEEL AND LOOK. THIS IS SOMETHING AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT FOR MANY DECADES. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE WEIGHT-LOSS BUSINESS IS A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR MONSTER EVERY DAMN YEAR.\n\nI TRY TOP NAP BECAUSE LATELY I JUST SEEM TO BE FEELING TIRED ALL THE TIME. I AM SURE MY FAT HAS ALOT TO DO WITH IT ALONG WITH MY HORRIBLE SLEEPING HABITS.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL FOR A 5 ACT NIGHT. IT WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD NIGHT FOR A THURSDAY. MUSIC WAS GOOD , PEOPLE WERE COOL , AND THE BARTENDER AN DI MOVED THE SHOW AND PATRONS ALONG VERY NICELY.\n\nREALLY SLIM PICKINGS FOR SPORTS TONIGHT. I DID WATCH THE REPLAY OF THE 76ERS / HEAT GAME. A REALLY GOOD WIN AND NOW THE 76ERS PLAY THE KNICKS IN A 7 GAME SERIES. THIS WILL BE TOUGH.\n\nI HEAD HOME AFTER MIDNIGHT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A YEAR....NO SNACKS OR NIGHTCAPS. I DIDN'T EVEN CHECK MY COMPUTER.\n\nFRIDAY 4 - 19 - 24\n\nIT FELT LIKE A SATURDAY ALL DAY.\n\nCELL PHONE CLIP BROKE TO CONNECT TO MY PANTS......BLOW.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT.\n\nWHEELS AND YOUNGEST COME HOME FROM THE MT HOUSE. THEY DID A TON OF STUFF YESTERDAY.\n\nCONTINUE MY DIET AGAIN. LOST 2 MORE POUNDS IN 2 DAYS. TOTAL OF 4. THE FIRST 20 POUNDS IS THE EASIEST THAN IT PLATEAUS AND BECOMES DIFFICULT. I KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THERE IS SO MANY BENEFITS OF KEEPING THE WIGHT OFF BUT SO DAMN HARD WHEN YOU LOVE FOOD , SWEETS , AND BOOZE ,\n\nDECIDED TO CUT THE LAWN TODAY. WHEELS PULLS UP DRIVEWAY IN VAN AND I STOP TO HELP THEM UNLOAD. YEP , I DO THIS.\n\nSHOWER AND WE HEAD TO A FUNERAL. IT WAS THE OWNER'S WIFE OF THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES. IT WAS VERY NICE AND WELL ORGANIZED. MY ONLY DILEMMA WAS HEARING. SPEAKERS WERE VERY SOFT SPOKEN AND PRETTY TOUGH TO HEAR......AT LEAST FOR ME.\n\nOH , PHILLIES WIN 7 - 0 TODAY.\n\nA NICE BRUNCH AFTER THE CEREMONY WHICH IS LOCATED RIGHT ON THE CHURCH PROPERTY. YOU LITERALLY WALK FROM INSIDE THE CHURCH TO THE NEXT ROOM. WE TALKED TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.\n\nI LEAVE FIRST BECAUSE OF NAIL DUTIES.\n\nWHEELS , YOUNGEST , MOM , AND UNCLE GO TO DINNER AT CASEY'S IN NEWTOWN SQUARE. I MADE SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE.....NO BREAD , NO BUTTER.....BLOW.\n\nAT THE NAIL I RE-OPEN AND THERE WAS A NICE STEADY CROWD WITH GOOD MUSIC TONIGHT. OUR BARTENDERS SINGING AND DANCING BEHIND THE BAR ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.....AND FUN TO WATCH.\n\nTALKED TO BAND MEMBERS AND PATRONS ALL NIGHT. OUR DOORMEN STOPPED BY WHICH IS ALWAYS TO SEE. I GAVE HIM OPEN BAR THE WHOLE NIGHT.\n\nMR. UNLOVED WITH A GOOD SET AND DOING MAGIC TRICKS TO THE PATRONS ALL NIGHT. HE WAS LITERALLY THE LAST TO LEAVE.\n\nA FUN NIGHT OVERALL. I HEAD HOME AROUND 12:30AM. MY YOUNGEST STAYED UP FOR ME SO WE WATCHED AN EPISODE OF RICK AND MORTY. I HAD A SLICE OF PROVOLONE , A HANDFUL OF CASHEWS , AND ONE COKE ZERO/LIGHT WHISKEY DRINK. TECHNICALLY , I SHOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING AFTER 10PM BUT I AM NOT GOING HARDCORE.......YET. I WILL HOLD OFF ON BEER AND PEANUT BUTTER WHISKEY THOUGH.\n\nOFF TO BED AND THE PUP JOINS ME. I SLEPT DECENT.\n\nI KNOW IT IS IN MY HEAD BUT I \" FEEL \" LOSING JUST 4 POUNDS \" FEELS \" BETTER ALREADY. THERE ARE ALOT OF JOKES HERE BUT IT IS A START AND I HOPE I CONTINUE THIS FAT BURNING FATTY FAT FAT JOURNEY. I WANT THAT GOOD FEELING OF WEARING OLD CLOTHS AGAIN , NOT LOSING MY BREATH GOING UP STEPS , AND SEEING MY COCK AGAIN WHEN SHOWERING.\n\nSATURDAY 4 - 20 - 24\n\nGEE , SO SURPRISED , THEY DIDN'T FIT. I GO OUTSIDE WITH WHEELS AND YOUNGEST. THEY HELP ME FLIP THE UTILITY TRAILER ON ITS SIDE ( USUALLY I DO THIS BY MYSELF SINCE I AM 300 POUNDS ). I UNCRATE THE BRAND NEW RIMS AND TIRES ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND THEY DON'T FUCKING FIT. I PUT EVERYTHING BACK IN THE GARAGE........BLOW.\n\nINSIDE I CREATE A LONG EMAIL TO THIS WORLD WIDE TIRE COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND THESE VERY SPECIFIC TIRES AND RIMS.\n\n76ERS BLOW. YOU CAN JUST FEEL THEY WOULD LOSE. MANY PEOPLE PREDICTING 76ERS WIN THIS SERIES AGAINST THE KNICKS. I SAY , \" WHY ? \" THE KNICKS KICKED THEIR ASS ALL SEASON BY DOUBLE DIGIT WINS. I PREDICT KNICKS IN 5.\n\nPHILLIES ALMOST BLOW A 9 - 0 LEAD IN THE 9TH FRIGGIN' INNING. BEST BULLPEN EVER.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT.\n\nBACK HOME WE SETTLE IN AND CHILL.\n\nI HAVE A SALAD AND SOME CHINESE CONCOCTION......BLOW. I LOSE ANOTHER POUND. YEAH !!!!.....BLOW. IT IS NOW 5+ POUNDS LOST IN 3 DAYS.........BLOW.\n\nYOUNGEST WORKS ON A GIFT FOR HER AUNT'S 90TH BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW. IT IS PRETTY GOOD.\n\nALL OF US WATCH AN EPISODE OF PEAKY BLINDERS. THE PUP SNUGGLES WITH OUR YOUNGEST AND I AM ENVIOUS. THEY WERE SO COMFORTABLE. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME WATCHING THIS SERIES.\n\nI HEAD BACK TO THE NAIL AND 3 BANDS ARRIVE EARLY. THERE IS LARGE TRAILERS , MINI MOTOR HOMES , AND EVERYONE IS WEARING BLACK SHIRTS. WHY ?.......IT'S A METAL NIGHT. I START ORGANIZING EVERYONE AT ONCE.\n\nWE START THE SHOW AND TO HELP IT MOVE QUICKER THE FIRST 3 BANDS USE THE HOUSE DRUM KIT AND ONE BAND SUPPLIES THE BACK LINE. THE SPEAKER AMPS PRACTICALLY GO TO THE CEILING.\n\nEVERYONE WAS VERY COOL AND THE BANDS PLAYED ON TIME. THE GOOD THING WAS THE METAL SOUND WAS NOT BAD VOLUME WISE. NOW , MY HEARING BLOWS BUT OVERALL A FUN SHOW. METAL BANDS SEEM TO HAVE THIS BROTHERHOOD.\n\nWE GET DONE A LITTLE AFTER 12:30AM. I ROLL HOME WITH OUR YOUNGEST AND WE CHILL AND WATCH AN EPISODE OF RICK AND MORTY. THIS NEW SEASON IS REALLY BIZARRE AND NOT GOOD IN MY OPINION.\n\nSUNDAY 4 - 21 - 24\n\nBECAUSE OF A GOOD DAY I DID NOT GO CODE-RED...........BUT BOY WAS IT CLOSE.\n\nA VERY HARD DAY FOR DIETING. I LOST 3.4 POUNDS FOR A TOTAL OF 8.4 SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY.\n\nTHE DAY AND NIGHT :\n\nDO ALL MY NORMAL ROUTINE STUFF AND STILL BUMMED THE TIRES FOR MY TRAILER WERE WRONG. I WAS NOT SURPRISED THOUGH.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR ANOTHER 4 BAND NIGHT. I GOT ALOT DONE.\n\nI PICK UP MY PARENTS AND HEAD BACK TO MY HOUSE. WHEELS , YOUNGEST , AND ELDEST JOIN US AS WE HEAD TO A 90TH BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR AN AUNT.\n\nWE ARRIVE AND RIGHT FROM THE START I HAD A REALLY REALLY GOOD TIME. JOKING WITH COUSINS , A LARGE LAY-OUT OF FOOD , AND THE PHILLIES PLAYING. TO ME THERE WERE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS FUN FAMILY GET TOGETHER.\n\n- OUR YOUNGEST CREATED THIS TV/VCR INSTRUCTION GUIDE FOR MY AUNT AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT. IT WAS 4 PAGES AND EACH PAGE HAD ONLY ONE INSTRUCTION.......TURN ON TV , TURN ON VCR , PUSH TV/VCR , TURN OFF. THE REASON FOR THIS IS WE HAVE BEEN TO MY AUNT'S HOUSE OVER 100 TIMES AND EACH TIME SHE FORGETS HOW TO USE THE TV AND VCR. IT WAS THE BEST GIFT OF THE DAY AND MY AUNT SAID , \" IT WAS GOLD \".\n\n- MY AUNT REQUESTING OUR FAMILY WAY OF SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY WAS PRETTY FUNNY. SO , AFTER THE NORMAL HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG WE RE-SANG OUR VERSION. SHE ACTUALLY STARTED CRYING FROM JOY.\n\n- MAKING MY YOUNGER COUSINS LAUGH AND TELLING STORIES IS ALWAYS A PRIORITY FOR ME. BUT , THE BIGGEST WAS TALKING ABOUT THE \" OLE \" DAYS WITH MY AUNT , HER BEST FRIEND , AND MY DAD. THEY AVERAGED OVER 90 YEARS OLD. I BRING UP THE OLD DAYS AND SEE THEM TELL STORIES ABOUT SCHOOL , TEACHERS , 10 CENT MOVIES , GAMES THEY PLAYED LIKE KICK THE CAN , COAL BEING DELIVERED BY HORSE , HOW VALUABLE ICE WAS , AND MORE. THE STORIES WERE NON-STOP FROM THEM. TO ME , I SEE A REJUVENATION.\n\n- ON MY SIDE THERE WERE TONS OF DESERTS , SWEETS , HOAGIES , SANDWICHES , AND MORE. THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR ME TO NOT EAT.........BUT I STAYED ON MY PATH AND ONLY ATE HEALTHY STUFF. I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A CHEAT DAY AND HOUND THE BEJESUS OUT OF THE CHOCOLATES AND HOAGIES BUT I DECIDED AT THE LAST SECOND NOT TO. THE NEXT DAY I AM GLAD TO DIDN'T BUT MAN IT WAS A MINOR TORTURE.\n\n- CLOSE THE VAN DOOR AND LOCK MY ELDEST IN THERE. I FELT SO BAD I HUGGED HER. I THOUGHT SHE GOT OUT THE OTHER SIDE. WE LAUGHED.\n\n- OH , BEFORE WE LEFT , I LOCKED A FRIEND OF MY ELDEST IN OUR BASEMENT.\n\n- HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT ? MY YOUNG COUSIN IS ADORABLE AND 25 YEARS OLD. WE HAD HER LAUGHING THE WHOLE TIME. SHE SAYS TO ME , \" CAN YOU COME TO OUR HOUSE EVERY DAY TO MAKE US LAUGH. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LAUGHTER HERE. \"\n\n- SEEING A FAMILY PORTRAIT FORM 54 YEARS AGO. IT WAS PRETTY COOL BUT ONE ONE BROTHER LOOKED LIKE A HEAVY SET WALDO. WE SENT IT TO HIM. MY ELDEST ADDED A CARTOON PICTURE TO IT.\n\nPHILLIES WIN OVER A BAD TEAM. THESE ARE GAMES THEY MUST WIN.\n\nWE SAY OUR GOODBYES , LOAD MY PARENTS UP , AND HEAD BACK TO OUR HOUSE.\n\nAT HOME WE CHANGE VEHICLES. I MOVE MY PARENTS TO ANOTHER CAR AND DIVERT OUR INITIAL GAME PLAN TO SAVE WHEELS FROM DRIVING THEM HOME.\n\nMY YOUNGEST AND I DRIVE THEM HOME AND DROP THEM OFF.\n\nI HEAD TO SOUTH PHILLY TO DROP OFF OUR YOUNGEST. IT WAS SUCH A JOY TO HANG WITH HER FOR NEARLY A WEEK. OF COURSE , I ASKED HER TO GO BACK TO THE MT HOUSE NEXT SUNDAY BUT I JUST GOT A LOOK.\n\nMY ELDEST CALLS JUST AS WE SEE A WOMAN PLACING A FLAT SCREEN TV ON THE SIDEWALK. SHE LEANED IT ON A RETAINING WALL. WE CAN SEE A SIGN THAT SAYS \" FREE \" TAPED TO IT. MY ELDEST YELLS OUT , \" GO GET IT \" BECAUSE HER TV DOES NOT WORK IN HER BEDROOM ANYMORE. WE TURN AROUND AND SEE THE SIGN FULLY SAYS , \" FREE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK. \" WE DECIDE NOT TO GET IT.\n\nI DROP OFF OUR YOUNGEST AND SAY GOODBYE. SHE CARRIES UP ALOT OF STUFF TO HER APARTMENT BUT I MUST ROLL OUT. I HAVE TO GET TO THE NAIL FOR A 6:45PM LOAD-IN AND IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.\n\nI ARRIVE AT 6:35PM AND BEGIN MY RE-OPENING JUST AS BANDS ARRIVE. EVERYONE IS VERY COOL............................UNNNNNNNNNNNNTIL.\n\nSO HERE IS THE STORY OF ALMOST GOING CODE-RED, PUTTING A YOUNG FAT KID THROUGH A WALL , AND CANCELLING A 4 BAND SHOW. I SWEAR TO YOU MY PATIENCE LATELY HAS BEEN NEAR ZERO AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HELD BACK.\n\nSTORY - FIRST BAND SETS UP , DOES A SOUND CHECK , AND STARTS PLAYING. THE GUITAR PLAYER IS USING A COMPUTER FOR BACKING TRACKS. THIS IS SEMI-COMMON WITH BANDS. SO , THEY ARE MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR SET SO I DECIDE TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH NBA PLAY-OFFS AND SURF ON MY CELL PHONE. I AM SEATED FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND OUT OF NO WHERE I GET THIS SUPER HARD SLAP ON MY BACK. I SPUN OUT OF MY BARSTOOL THINKING A FIGHT HAS STARTED BUT IT IS THE GUITAR PLAYER SCREAMING AT ME \" WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING !!!!!??? \"\n\nSO AT THIS MICRO-SECOND I THOUGHT OF 2 OPTIONS :\n\n1 - BARREL ON THE STAGE , PUNCH HIS COMPUTER , AND FUCKING BODY SLAM THIS FAT KID INTO THE STAGE'S BACK WALL AND THAN CANCEL THE SHOW.\n\nOR\n\n2 - GO RIGHT TO THE MIXING BOARD AND TRY TO FIX IT AND PRETEND ALL IS OKAY. WHEN I SAY THE INFURIATING ANGER I HAD WAS 2ND TO NONE.\n\nI WENT TO THE MIXING BOARD BUT IT WAS NOT OUR EQUIPMENT. WE STOPPED THE SHOW AND OTHER BAND MEMBERS OFFERED ASSISTANCE. WE SPEND ABOUT 15 MINUTES BUT NOTHING WORKS. IT IS HIS COMPUTER AND CONNECTIONS THAT ARE NOT WORKING.......NOTHING TO DO WITH US. I COULD NOT BELIEVE I BIT MY TONGUE AND SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THIS ANGRY POMPOUS FAT GUY. I WAS CODE RED AND DECIDED TO JUST WAIT. IT ENDS UP HE MOPED AROUND FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND LEFT. I WAS GLAD HE DID.\n\nTHE REST OF THE NIGHT WAS PERFECT AND EVERYONE WAS SUPER COOL.\n\nA OLD REGULAR WHO MOVED OUT OF STATE STOPPED IN. IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY SO I TOLD OUR BARTENDER TO BUY A BIRTHDAY SHOT FOR HER. OF COURSE THERE IS A SMALL GROUP AND THEY ASK ME TO TRY A REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER SHOT WITH THEM. THE TWO THINGS I LOVE ( PEANUT BUTTER & CHOCOLATE ). I TELL THEM I CAN'T. AGAIN , ANOTHER TEST FOR MY EATING / DRINKING DIET. I CURSE YOU GODS OF FOOD AND DRINK !!!\n\nSHOW WAS DONE BY 10:45PM WHICH WAS NICE. I'LL TELL YOU I WAS STILL FUMING FROM THAT EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE HARD BACK SLAP. ON ANY OTHER DAY I WOULD USE MY 300 POUNDS TO PUT THAT PERSON INTO A SUBMISSIVE HOLD WITH MY ASS.\n\nWE ROLL OUT AND I HEAD HOME. I TALK TO MY ELDEST AND HER BOYFRIEND AT OUR HOUSE.\n\nI WATCH TV IN THE MAIN ROOM FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES BUT DECIDED TO JUST GO TO BED. I CHECK EMAILS AND PLAY A GAME OF POKER. I WATCH TV FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES MORE AND HEAD TO SLEEP. I SLEPT OKAY.\n\nOH , JUST GOT AN EMAIL FROM WORLDWIDE SUPER STORE TIRES WHERE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD PURCHASE TIRES FROM THEM. THEY CAN'T FIND MY RIMS. I HAVE TO RETURN MINE.\n\nMONDAY 4 - 22 - 24\n\nTHE PAIN :\n\nBEING A PHILADELPHIA SPORTS FAN IS CRUSHING. TONIGHT WAS A CRUSHING HEART BREAKING LOSS. WITH 27 SECONDS LEFT , 76ERS WERE UP 4 POINTS AND CHANCE TO GO UP 5 WITH A FREE THROW. ROB LOWRY MISSES , KNICKS SCORE TWO 3 POINTERS , FOULS OUT THE YING YANG , AND KNICKS WIN. THE ANNOUNCERS AND MYSELF WERE ACTUALLY THINKING , \" THIS IS A GOOD WIN TO TIE THE SERIES \". EVEN MY NIECE'S HUSBAND FROM PORTLAND TEXTED ME , \" ABOUT TO TIE THE SERIES \". THIS LOSS ACTUALLY PUT ME IN A BAD MOOD.\n\nANOTHER 3 HOURS TRYING TO FIND A TIRE AND RIM FOR MY TRAILER. IT JUST DOESN'T EXIST.\n\nOK LET'S MOVE ON :\n\nPHILLIES WIN 7TH STRAIGHT. TONIGHT WAS A SOLID WIN OVER THE REDS WHO BASICALLY HAVE THE SAME RECORD AS US.\n\nTALK ABOUT A CRUSHING LOSS.....THE LAKERS. OMG , WINNING AS HIGH AS 20 POINTS ALL GAME AND LOSE ON A BUZZER BEATER.\n\nLOST ANOTHER POUND. I AM ALMOST AT 10 POUNDS LOST SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY. I KNOW THIS IS WATER / ASS WEIGHT BUT IT IS THE START IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FUNNY ......BEFORE BED , I STAND IN FRONT OF MY FULL TALL MIRROR. I AM JUST IN BOXERS AND LOOK AT MYSELF. I THINK , \" I WONDER IF IT \" LOOKS \" LIKE I LOST WEIGHT ON MY BELLY. \" I TURN SIDEWAYS AND SAY TO MYSELF , \" NOPE \".\n\nWHAT I ATE AND DRANK TODAY :\n\n- SALAD WITH AVOCADO AND 2 HARD BOILED EGGS.\n\n- A GRAIN SNACK BAR\n\n- WATER AND SMALL GLASS OF WINE.\n\n- 2 COLD MEATBALLS.\n\n- PEANUTS AND CASHEWS MIXED WITH SOME PEANUT BUTTER IN A SMALL BOWL.\n\nYEP , THE ABOVE FOOD BLOWS.\n\nELDEST GOES ON A INTERVIEW FOR AN EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHING JOB.

I ALSO POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAT WAS IT ? A FRIGGIN' SQUIRREL NOTCHED A HOLE IN OUR ROOF TO ACCESS THE ATTIC. THIS IS WHY YELLOW INSULATION WAS ON THE GROUND. THE DAMN CRITTER PULLED INSULATION OUT AND FUCKING THREW IT DOWN TO THE GROUND TO MOCK ME **\n\n- DOWN THE LADDER TO GET SUPPLIES.

WE ARE SO GLAD TO SEE THIS KID COME OUT OF HER COMFORT ZONE.\n\nAROUND 12 NOON I GET A CALL FROM AN ECSTATIC KID. SHE THINKS SHE GOT THE JOB. THE DIRECTOR SAID HE WOULD CALL HER BY THE END OF THE DAY AFTER HE TALKED TO THE WOMAN TEACHER WHO INTERVIEWED HER. WE TALK AND THIS KID IS ABOVE THE MOON. IT WAS SO NICE TO SEE HER FEELING SO HIGH.\n\nBY 1PM I GET A 2ND CALL. OUR ELDEST TELLS ME THE DIRECTOR CALLED AND SHE STARTS NEXT WEEK. IT IS OFFICIAL. I WAS DAMN NEAR CLOSE TO TEARS.\n\nSO NOW MY DAY STARTS WITH OUR ELDEST ON CLOUD 9. WHAT A GOOD FEELING FOR A PARENT TO HAVE TO SEE HOW EXCITED THEIR KID IS.

I THINK IT WAS THE COMBINATION OF OUR KID GETTING A JOB , AND THE PHILLY TEAMS WINNING.\n\nFUNNY......I WANTED TO RE-TILE THE NAIL BATHROOM FLOORS BUT WAS DREADING PULLING UP OLD TILES. I STARTED LOOKING FOR WATER PROOF WOOD. THE NEXT DAY I GET A TEXT FROM MY CONSTRUCTION BROTHER ,\" YOU WANT SOME WATER PROOF LAMINATE OF THE NAIL BATHROOM FLOORS ? \"\n\nTHE RAIN CAME BIG TIME FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS.

I DROP IT OFF TO SEE IF THEY CAN MOUNT A NEW TIRE ON MY OLD BENT THE FUCK UP RIM. THE TECH IMMEDIATELY SAYS , \" THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. \"\n\nWE THAN DRIVE TO ASTON ON A FB MARKETPLACE RUN. THE LADY IS A VERY COOL AND SHE KNOWS TRAILERS AND TIRES BIG TIME. SHE FRIGGIN' BUILT ONE FOR HER BOAT. I TALK WITH HER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND IT IS DETERMINED HER 3 BRAND NEW TIRES WILL NOT FIT MY TRAILER'S AXEL. WE WOULD HAVE TO MACGYVER MEANING CHANGE THE AXEL OR BEARINGS. I DETERMINE TO BUY HER 3 NEW TIRES AND RIMS ANYWAY. SHE LOWERS PRICE AGAIN FROM $120 TO $60 TO 50 BUCKS. I MUST MAKE THEM WORK.\n\nWE TRY TO MEET UP WITH A NEPHEW IN ASTON BUT HE IS WORKING.

HE TELLS ME , \" CHRIS , I HAVE CHANGED IP ADDRESSES 10,000 TIMES. THIS SHOULD ONLY TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES. \"\n\n2 1/2 HOURS LATER HE TELLS ME HE'LL RETURN TOMORROW TO TRY AGAIN. GETTING COMCAST TO HELP WITH TEMPORARY PASSWORD CODES WAS DIFFICULT. SO DIFFICULT HE ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR 3 TIMES.\n\nI STAY UNTIL 4:30PM AND DECIDE NOT TO STAY HERE UNTIL THE BARTENDER COMES IN AT 8PM.\n\nI RE-STOP AT THE BANK TO REPLACE THE $200 IN FIVES I JUST FUCKING GOT TO GET $200 ONE DOLLAR BILLS WHICH I ACTUALLY NEEDED. MORE FUCKING TIME WASTED.\n\nI DRIVE BY A 2ND TIRE SHOP I KNOW. I PASS THE PLACE AND SAY TO MYSELF , \" FUCK IT. I'LL GO IN FOR A 2ND OPINION. \" I DRIVE AROUND 2 BLOCKS WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO TRAFFIC AND PARK. I WALK IN AND AFTER A COUPE OF MINUTES LOOKING AT MY RIM THE SALES REP SAYS , \" YEAH , THAT RIM IS SHOT \".\n\nI HEAD HOME AND WITHIN 2 BLOCKS I HIT ALL KINDS OF FUCKING TRAFFIC. IT WAS TOTALLY CLEAR 5 FUCKING MINUTES AGO !!!!\n\nAT HOME I AM SO BUMMED. MY ELDEST TAKES THE CAR TO GO VISIT A FRIEND IN THE HOSPITAL. I CHECK EMAILS AND FEED THE PUP. WE LEND THIS FRIEND OUR TRAVEL ROKU.\n\nTHE UNSEASONABLE 88 DEGREE WEATHER IS A LITTLE MORE PLEASANT WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN. SO , I DECIDE TO TACKLE SOME IDEAS TO MOUNT THESE NEW TIRES ON THE TRAILER SITTING SIDEWAYS IN MY DRIVEWAY. JUST ONE PROBLEM......I LEFT THEM IN THE FUCKING CAR THAT MY ELDEST TOOK !!!! FUCK !!!!!\n\nSO , I DECIDE TO CUT THE LAWN IN WHICH THE GRASS IS PRETTY HIGH. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH IT GREW IN JUST 5 DAYS. I USE MY RIDING MOWER AND GET THE FRONT DONE. I MOVED TO THE BACK YARD WHICH IS THE EASIEST BECAUSE THE SHAPE OF THE LAWN IS A RECTANGLE.\n\nI NEED TO DOUBLE RUN BECAUSE THE GRASS AND CLIPPINGS ARE ALOT. I PUSH ALL GRASS TOWARDS MY FAR FENCE AND THAN..............A LOUD METAL SOUND MAKES ME IMMEDIATELY STOP THE MOWER. IT FUCKING STARTLED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.\n\nWHAT DID I DO ?? I HAVE A METAL WIRE DOG RUNNER IN THE BACK YARD AND NEVER SAW IT. I CUT THE LIVING BEJESUS OUT OF IT AND THE WHOLE 100' RUNNER WRAPPED ITSELF UNDER THE MOWER AND ON 2 OF 3 BLADES. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME ???!!!!!!\n\nI GET MY CAR RAMPS TO DRIVE THE MOWER UP BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM UNDERNEATH TO UNTANGLE THE BIRDS NEST OF WIRE WRAPPED AROUND 2 BLADES. IT IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE !!!\n\nI GRAB SOME GLOVES AND PICK UP THE FUCKING 300 POUND RIDING MOWER AND TILT IT ON ITS BACK WHEELS STRAIGHT UP. I NOW USE ONE HAND TO HOLD THE MOWER IN PLACE VERTICALLY AND USE MY OTHER HAND TO JERK-OFF. SO, 25 MINUTES OF HOLDING THIS DAMN MACHINE STRAIGHT UP TO UNTANGLE THE DAMN 100 FEET OF WIRE. I AM FURIOUS.\n\nI GET IT UNTANGLED , MOVE THE FIRE PIT , 8 CHAIRS , AND A TABLE TO THE SIDE WHERE I ALREADY CUT AND FINISH CUTTING THE LAWN. I WILL FINISH MORE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN THE TEMPERATURES DROP.\n\nBY 8PM I SETTLE IN AT MY DESK TO CHECK BAND EMAILS AND MORE.\n\nSILVER LINING - I CHECK MY SURVEILLANCE VIA MY CELL PHONE AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW.......I AM BACK ONLINE !! I ASSUME COMCAST GOT IT DONE ON THEIR END. I TEXT THE SURVEILLANCE TECH THE NEWS.\n\nELDEST RETURNS AND MAKES A WONDERFUL DINNER OF THICK SALMON STEAKS AND BROCCOLI. IT WAS VERY NICE AND GOOD TOO. WE WATCH ADAM SANDLER AND DREW BARRYMORE IN 50 FIRST DATES. A CUTE MOVIE I SEEN 20 TIMES.\n\nSHE ROLLS TO THE NAIL WHICH I PREPPED AND I HANG OUT TO WATCH THE 76ERS. I USE ALL MY JINXES AND SUPERSTITIONS BUT NOTHING WORKS. WHEELS AND I TEXT HOW NERVOUS WE ARE DURING THE GAME. SHE ALSO VISITED SOME FRIENDS AT THEIR NEW HOUSE. A VERY NICE VISIT.\n\nTHE GAME IS OVER AND IT'S A BRUTAL LOSS ESPECIALLY WITH THE SMUG KNICK PLAYERS AND DICKHEAD NEW YORK FANS AT OUR HOME VENUE. THERE IS NO SPORT'S GOD. I AM JUST SICK TO MY STOMACH. LOSING AGAIN FOR 3 STRAIGHT YEARS AT HOME IN GAME 6 IS CRUSHING TO A FAN.\n\nI PLAY SOME POKER , CHECK EMAILS , AND WATCH A LITTLE MORE TV. I FORCE THE PUP TO DO A FINAL WALK AND HEAD TO BED AROUND 12:30AM. WHAT A FUCKING DAY. I SLEEP OKAY.\n\nFRIDAY 5 - 3 - 24\n\nWHEELS HAS A HECTIC WEEK AND THAN A MUST NEEDED STRESS RELIEF TIME WITH FRIENDS AT A COUPLE OF LOCAL PUBS. I WAS HAPPY FOR HER.\n\nMY ONLY THOUGHT IS I HAVE 4 TRAILER TIRES AND RIMS PLUS SOME ORIGINAL PARTS. I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK. I SPENT ABOUT ONE HOUR AND GOT IT DONE. AFTER 4 WEEKS I FINALLY HAVE MY UTILITY TRAILER BACK. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ON HOW I MACGUYVERED A NEW TIRE & RIM TO THE OLD AXEL.\n\nI FINISH CUTTING MY LAWN AND DO A FULL TRIM WITH MY WEED WHACKER. MAN , I FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE TRIMMER STRING DIFFERENTLY AND IT WORKED REALLY GOOD. OH , I PULLED A THICK TARZAN-LIKE VINE OUT OF A TREE THAT HAD TO BE 50 FEET LONG.\n\nI PREP A FIRE PIT.\n\nTO THE NAIL TO MEET FOR A BEER DELIVERY AND SODA TECH.\n\nI PICK UP OUR YOUNGEST AT THE TRAIN STATION , THAN GET SUSHI FROM VIC'S , AND THAN BACK HOME I CHILL WITH MY KIDS AND THE PUP. IT WAS FUN.\n\nBACK TO THE NAIL WITH MY YOUNGEST. IT WAS A 3 BAND NIGHT WHICH IS RARE BUT I ENJOYED THE EASY NIGHT. THERE WAS GOOD MUSIC AND PEOPLE OVERALL WERE COOL.\n\nBACK HOME MY YOUNGEST MAKES DRINKS WHILE I GET THE FIRE PIT GOING. I CARRY OUT A LARGE CUSHION CHAIR AS A SURPRISE FOR MY KID. WE TALKED AND FINISHED A HALF BOTTLE OF CROWN APPLE. I LOVED EVERY SECOND. THE PUP JOINED US FOR ALITTLE AND THAN WENT BACK INSIDE ON HER OWN. I SWEAR THIS DOG IS A CAT FOR NOT WANTING TO BE OUTSIDE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME.\n\nINSIDE AROUND 2:15AM AND WE WIND DOWN BY FINISHING THE LAST EPISODE OF RICK AND MORTY.\n\nBY 3:15AM WE HEAD TO BED. WE STAYED UP TOO LATE BUT I SO ENJOYED HANGING WITH MY KID.\n\nSATURDAY 5 - 4 - 24\n\nMISSION FAILED..............BLOW.\n\nMY YOUNGEST AND I SPENT ABOUT 45 MINUTES CONNECTING A FLAT SCREEN TV TO A DIGITAL ANTENNA. THE TV SAT ON MY KITCHEN COUNTER AND IT RECEIVES CLOSE TO 70 CHANNELS FOR FREE. SO THIS IS KINDA COOL. WE PREPPED AND LOADED THE TV AND ANTENNA. MY ELDEST JOINED US.\n\nWE TAKE A RIDE TO MY 90 YEAR OLD AUNT'S HOUSE. SHE CALLS US EVERY COUPLE WEEKS ON HOW TO USE HER TV FROM THE 1800'S. IT HAS 2 CHANNELS.......FLINTSTONES AND ANTIQUE ROAD SHOW. I FLIP OUT THE TV'S AND WE BEGIN THE CHANNEL SCAN. SHE ALSO NEEDS US TO CHECK HER 10 INCH TV OUT IN THE KITCHEN. THIS IS A 30 MINUTES PROJECT AT MOST. IF WE DID NOT HAVE TO SCAN FOR CHANNELS IT BE 10 MINUTES.\n\n2+ HOURS LATER I HAVE 3 INDOOR ANTENNAS RUN IN HER BASEMENT ALONG THE CEILING. THERE IS ONLY ONE CHANNEL SHE WANTS......6. WE SCANNED AND GOT 48 STATIONS. GUESS WHICH ONE WOULD NOT COME IN NOW ? YEP.......FUCKING ACTION NEWS CHANNEL 6. WE GET IT TO WORK IN THE KITCHEN BUT NOT MAIN ROOM. MY GOOD MOOD VANISHED AND 2+ HOURS WERE WASTED. ALL THE PREPPING WE DID YESTERDAY MEANT JACK DICK. WE ROLL OUT AND I WILL CHECK OUT COMCAST TV OR SOME OTHER NETWORK FOR MY AUNT AND COUSIN.\n\nWE WALK ACROSS THE STREET TO A EATERY CALLED GREEN EGGS CAFE. I THOUGHT THE FOOD WAS GOOD BUT ELDEST DID NOT. I TELL MY KIDS , \" MAN , THIS WHOLE TV PROJECT RUINED MY DROPPED MY MOOD BIG TIME. \" MY YOUNGEST JOKINGLY REPLIES , \" WELL , LET'S BRING THE MOOD BACK UP !! \"\n\nNEXT WE DROP OFF OUR YOUNGEST.\n\nNEXT WE HAD TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT. THE RAIN IS COMING.\n\nAT HOME WE SETTLE IN. I MUST NAP. I FALL ASLEEP AT 4:45PM AND THE DOG BARKS AT MY FACE TO WAKE ME UP AT 6:07PM. I FEED HER AND HEAD TO THE NAIL.\n\nI CALL WHEELS TO CHECK IN ON OUR. SHE IS HAVING SOME ALARM PROBLEMS THAT I HELP FIX.\n\nTHE RAIN IS FALLING AND I ARRIVE. THE BANDS AND FANS START ARRIVING AND I WAS SURPRISED ON HOW A GOOD CROWD SHOWED UP IN THE RAIN. I BROUGHT THE 2ND BARTENDER IN EARLY. A DOOR MAN HELPS TOO.\n\nTHE NIGHT MOVES ALONG AND IT WAS FUN. ALL MUSIC WAS VERY GOOD AND PEOPLE WERE COOL. I PLAYED WITH PATRONS AS I ALWAYS DO.\n\nI ROLL OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT AND HEAD HOME TO WALK THE PUP . PLAY POKER , AND CHECK EMAILS. I HAVE NO SNACKS OR LATE NIGHT DRINKS. BY 1AM I HEAD TO BED. THOUGH I WON AT POKER I REGRET PLAYING BECAUSE 3 PLAYERS WERE SUPER SLOW AND ELONGATED THE GAME FOR ALMOST AN HOUR. I WAS FALLING A SLEEP.\n\nPHILLIES KEEP WINNING AND GET THIS.....TAKE OVER 1ST PLACE IN MAY. THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED IN A VERY LONG TIME.\n\nI SLEEP PRETTY GOOD.\n\nSUNDAY 5 - 5 - 24\n\nWELP , THIS WAS A CHEAT DAY FOR MY DIET. I DIDN'T WANT TO BUT ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER. I FEEL STRESS HAS ALOT TO DO WITH IT.\n\nWHEELS HAVING FUN WITH SOME NEIGHBORS AFTER A LONG WORK WEEK.\n\nTHREE FB MARKETPLACE PEOPLE HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO MY MESSAGES. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN \" SEEN \" MY MESSAGE. I JUST THINK , \" WHY POST SOMETHING FOR SALE ? \" I FIGURE ALL ARE FAKE ACCOUNTS.\n\nBRING DOWN 5 FULL TRASH CANS OF WEEDS. THEY SHOULD BE PICKED UP TOMORROW.\n\nI AM CURIOUS TO TRY TOWING THE TRAILER WITH THE NEW TIRE. UNFORTUNATELY , WHEELS HAS THE CAR TO PULL IT IN NEW JERSEY.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT. I SPEND ABOUT AN HOUR.\n\nBACK HOME I CHILL. I HAD SHOWS FROM WEDNESDAY TO SUNDAY. ONE MORE TO GO AND I CONCENTRATE ON HOUSE PROJECTS AND CHILLING A BIT. DOUBLE SHIFTS BLOW.\n\nPHILLIES HOLD ON AND WIN AGAIN. BRAVES LOSING PUTS THEM 2 1/2 GAMES UP IN FIRST PLACE. THIS IS UNHEARD-OF FOR PHILLY MAY BASEBALL.\n\nWATCHED A DOCUMENTARY ON NEANDERTHALS. AS FAR AS A TIME LINE , I GOTTA SAY RELIGION AND SCIENCE DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO MATCHING UP. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE : THE BIBLE GENESIS 1 HAS THE EARTH AND HUMANITY ABOUT 6,000 YEARS OLD. THE EARLIEST KNOWN FOSSILS OF NEANDERTHALS WERE 430,000 YEARS AGO. BEST KNOWN WERE 40,000 TO 130,000 YEARS AGO. I WON'T EVEN GET INTO SCIENTISTS AND THEIR BELIEFS THAT OUR PLANET IS BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD.\n\nBACK TO THE NAIL TO FIND OUT OUR 5 BAND NIGHT IS NOW A 2 BAND NIGHT. I WAS QUITE SURPRISED IT WAS A DECENT NIGHT WITH ONE BAND PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS BOTH VISUALLY AND MUSICALLY. I POSTED A VIDEO. SOME PRETTY CRAZY BUT FUN STUFF.\n\nMY 90 YEAR OLD AUNT CALLS BOTH ME AND MY YOUNGEST. SHE NOW GETS CHANNEL 6 ( THE ONE WE WANTED THE WHOLE TIME ) BUT NOT SOME OTHERS. OH......MY.......GOD , WE WERE JUST THERE SATURDAY.\n\nI HAD A GOOD TIME MEETING BAND MEMBERS AND PROMOTER. ALL WERE SUPER COOL.\n\nBACK HOME I SETTLE IN , WALK THE PUP , AND WATCH TV. I MADE A NIGHTCAP , HAD SOME PEANUTS , AND WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE LAST OF US. YES , I FELL ASLEEP IN THIS 1 1/2 HOUR FIRST EPISODE BUT LET ME TELL YOU I WAS SUPER BUMMED THEY KILLED OFF A CHARACTER IN THE FIRST FRIGGIN HOUR !!! WHY ???!!!\n\nOFF TO BED AND SLEPT OKAY. THE PUP JOINED ME.\n\nSUNDAY 5 - 6 - 24\n\nJUST AMAZING HOW FAST EVERY DAY GOES BY. I WANT TO GET 20 THINGS DONE AND CAN ONLY DO 2.\n\nFB MARKETPLACE - ELDEST AND I PICK UP A NEW DESK AND .......FORGET A PART THAT THE OWNER HAD IN HIS POCKET. MY ELDEST DRIVES BACK TO GET IT IN TRAFFIC. IT TAKES 2 MINUTES TO TAKE APART , 1 HOUR TO GET THAT PART , AND 2 HOURS TO PUT DESK BACK TOGETHER. THE SUCKY PART........IT LOOKS TOO SMALL.\n\nOH , THE FB PERSON KNOWS THE NAIL AND HIS SON IS IN A BAND.\n\nSTOP AT DMV TO GET FINGER PRINTED IN A GOOD WAY. OUR ELDEST HAS TO DO THIS BEFORE HER NEW TEACHING JOB TOMORROW.\n\nWE STOP AT IRON HILL BREWERY FOR LUNCH. FOOD WAS OKAY.\n\nGET ALOT OF COMPUTER BAND WORK DONE. MONDAYS ARE THE LONGEST.\n\nTALK TO A COUSIN AND MAKE HIM LAUGH. LOOKS LIKE HE IS DOING ANOTHER HOUSE PARTY. THE THEME , \" COME IN YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT \". I'M INB.\n\nIT WAS NICE TO JUST CHILL TODAY. WHEELS FACETIME'S ME WHILE WALKING THE BEACH. THE CLOUDS CAME IN WITH FOG AND OVERCAST BUT STILL IN THE LOW 60'S. IT LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.\n\nPHILLIES WIN AGAIN. THE PHILLY FANS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. WE ARE JUST NOT USE TO THIS MAY CALENDAR BASEBALL.\n\nI WATCHED THE 3 HOUR LONG ROAST OF TOM BRADY. OVERALL , IT WAS OKAY TO GOOD. I HAVE TO ADMIT KEVIN HART WAS NOT FUNNY.......CLOSER TO ANNOYING. THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING WAS SELLING OUT THE L.A. COLISEUM.\n\nOFF TO BED AND CLOSED THE DOOR. THE PUP WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. SHE BARKED AT THE DOOR AROUND 6:15AM.\n\nTUESDAY 5 - 7 - 24\n\nHOW WOULD YOU WANT TO FEEL ON YOUR FIRST DAY AT THE NEW JOB ? MY HEART FELT GOOD IN THE MORNING BUT WHEN OUR ELDEST CAME HOME IT SANK.\n\nI START THE MORNING MAKING BREAKFAST , LUNCH , AND LOADING THE CAR FOR OUR ELDEST. IT IS HER FIRST DAY ON A NEW TEACHING JOB. I COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPIER FOR THIS KID. I EVEN MADE A SIGN THAT SAID , \" GOOD LUCK , HAVE FUN , LOVE YOU !!! \". THE PUP AND I WAVED FROM THE PATIO AND SHE LEFT FOR HER ADVENTURE. THE KID GOT TEARY.\n\nI GET A TEXT LATE MORNING , \" FEELING AWKWARD BUT GOOD. \" OK , THIS IS GOOD. I GOT TEARY EYED AS SHE TEXTED THIS TO OUR FAMILY GROUP.\n\nELDEST COMES HOME AROUND 5:30PM AND SHE SEEMS UPSET. I CAN NOT TELL IF IT IS HAPPY OR SAD AS SHE CRIES WALKING TOWARDS ME. I SAY , \" I AM SUPER CONCERNED AND NERVOUSLY SAY , \" OH GOD , IS THIS HAPPY OR SAD CRY ? \" SHE REPLIES , \" SAD. \" MY HEART DROPS TO INFINITY. SHE TELLS ME HER DAY AND HOW SHE WAS TREATED. THIS WOULD BOTHER ME ALL EVENING.\n\nI CONTINUE MY DIET AND TRY TO BE GOOD. IT DEFINITELY BLOWS.\n\nWHEELS ROLLS OUT FROM THE BEACH AND MEETS UP WITH OUR YOUNGEST. THEY VISIT MY AUNT AND COUSIN AGAIN TO MESS AROUND WITH THEIR TV. ANOTHER 90 MINUTES. THEY GO OUT TO DINNER.\n\nI TAKE A RIDE TO THE NAIL TO MAKE FOOD , BEER , AND LIQUOR LISTS.\n\nOFF TO RESTAURANT DEPOT. I TALK TO A MANAGER AND REQUESTED PIZZA SHELLS 6 MONTHS AGO. HE TELLS ME THEY SHOULD BE IN NEXT MONTH. I GET ALL MY SHOPPING DONE.\n\nAT THE NAIL I UNLOAD AND DO OTHER STUFF.\n\nAT HOME I UNLOAD AND DO COMPUTER WORK.\n\nOUR ELDEST ARRIVES HOME AND WE TALK OUTSIDE FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. IT WAS A DEVASTATING FIRST DAY. MY HEART DROPPED AND ACHED FOR THIS KID.\n\nWHEELS ARRIVES HOME AND WE UNLOAD. I LET HER TALK TO OUR ELDEST. I ALSO HAVE HER SISTER CALL.\n\nALL THE WORK WE DID WITH GETTING THIS FB DESK AND SETTING IT UP IS FOR NOT. IT IS TOO SMALL. AT 7:30PM I TAKE IT APART AND RE-INSTALL HER OLD DESK.......BLOW.\n\nI ORDER DINNER WITH MY ELDEST AND TREAT HER. HER MOOD GOT BETTER BUT THE TREATMENT OF HER FIRST DAY WAS ON MY MIND STILL. HER BOYFRIEND STOPS OVER LATE NIGHT TO CONSOLE TOO.\n\nPHILLIES WIN A AGAIN AS HARPER HITS HIS 3RD HOMERUN IN A ROW. THIS TIME A GRAND SLAM.\n\nALL OF US WATCH 2 EPISODES OF RESIDENT ALIEN. BOTH WERE VERY GOOD TO EXCELLENT.\n\nI HEAD TO BED AND CONTEMPLATE CALLING THE DIRECTORS OF THE SCHOOL WHERE OUR ELDEST JUST HAD HER FIRST DAY. I SEARCH ONLINE AND CAN'T FIND THE PHONE NUMBER WHEN THE DIRECTOR CALLED ME 2 WEEKS AGO.\n\nI CLIMB IN BED AND MY MIND IS RACING UNTIL 1:45AM. I JUST CAN'T SLEEP. I GET UP AND PLACE A LIQUOR ORDER ONLINE.\n\nGET THIS LUCK - AT 2:30AM I SEARCH FOR MY CLIP BOARD FOR A BEER / FOOD LIST I MADE. I HAD IT ALL DAY AND KNEW I PLACED IT ON THE BACK SEAT FLOOR OF MY VAN. I GO OUTSIDE AND SEARCH MY VAN. I CAN NOT FIND IT. I COME INSIDE AND SEARCH AROUND AGAIN. MIND YOU , IT IS 2 FRIGGIN' 30 IN THE MORNING.\n\nI GO BACK OUTSIDE FOR A 2ND TIME AT 3AM AND OPEN ALL DOORS OF MY VAN. I F'N KNOW THIS STUPID FUCKING CLIPBOARD IS IN THERE. I SLIDE MY HAND UNDER THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT SEAT AND FEEL THE CLIPBOARD. I CURSE. THE DAMN THING SLID UNDER WHILE I WAS DRIVING.\n\nBACK INSIDE I PLACE A BEER ORDER CALL AT 3:05AM. OH , THE REASON WHY I DO THIS IS A LIVE CALL THE NEXT DAY IS WITH A NEW INDIAN EMPLOYEE WHERE I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD HE SAYS . I MADE ONE ORDER WITH HIM AND IT WAS WRONG. I VOWED NEVER TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.\n\nBACK IN BED AROUND 3:15AM AND FINALLY FALL ASLEEP. I WAKE UP AT 5:50AM. I JUST LAY THERE RUBBING MY BALLS AND SCRATCHING MY ASS HOLE. I GET OUT OF BED BY 7:45AM.\n\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 8 - 24\n\nTODAY IS MUCH BETTER AND SMOKING A BOWL HELPED.\n\nDAY 2 OF NEW TEACHING JOB. DAY 1 WAS NOT THE BEST SO WE RELOADED AND GOT BACK ON THE HORSE. WHEELS AND I HELP MAKE BREAKFAST , LUNCH , AND LOAD THE CAR UP. WE ALSO HELP WITH PAYING FOR DOCUMENTATION LIKE PHYSICALS , INOCULATIONS , BACKGROUND CHECKS , FINGER PRINTING , AND MORE. I EVEN SLICED SMOKED TURKEY AT 8AM TO MAKE OUR ELDEST A GOOD SANDWICH.\n\nELDEST ROLLS OUT AND WE HAVE OUR FINGERS CROSSED. I AM SO NERVOUS ON HOW HER 2ND DAY WILL BE.\n\nPHILLIES SHIT THE BED AND LOSE. WORST TEAM EVER. SUCKED US IN BY HAVING 2ND AND 3RD WITH ONE OUT AND COULD NOT MANUFACTURE ONE RUN IN THE 9TH AND FINAL INNING......BLOW.\n\nI WEED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES OUT FRONT AND FILL ONE TRASHCAN. I AM AMAZED HOW FAST WEEDS GROW BACK.\n\nTHE FIRST TEST IS GOOD !!.....SO FAR. I DECIDED TO TEST THE NEW WHEEL AND BEARINGS ON MY UTILITY TRAILER. I CONNECT THE TRAILER AND DRIVE TO OUR LOCAL PARK FOR MULCH. I SPEND A SOLID 30 MINUTES LISTENING TO MUSIC AND SHOVELING REALLY GOOD DARK BLACK MULCH. I LOAD THE TRAILER ABOUT 80%.\n\nOH , I TAKE A LITTLE BREAK AND WALK OVER TO THE BALL PARK AND CONCESSION STAND WHERE THERE ARE WATER FOUNTAINS. I DRINK SOME WATER AND NOTICE A WONDERFUL PLAGUE AND DOCUMENTATION ON WHO THIS PARK WAS NAMED AFTER. IT WAS PRETTY COOL AND NAMED AFTER A WORLD WAR II HERO WHO LIVED IN RADNOR , SERVED THE COAST GUARD , SAVED LIVES DURING AN ATTACK OF HIS SHIP , AND PLAYED IN THE NFL.\n\nSLOWLY DRIVE BACK TO HOUSE WITH TRAILER IN TOW. I DO HEAR A LITTLE NOISE BUT ALL SEEMS OKAY. I UNLOAD MULCH INTO OUR FRONT 3 GARDENS.\n\nFIRST TEXT FROM ELDEST , \" I AM IN TRAINING. \" OH THIS IS A GOOD SIGN OF A BETTER 2ND DAY.\n\nINSIDE I WORK ON A SOCIAL MEDIA POST FOR THE BANDS AND NAIL THIS WEEKEND. I SPEND ABOUT AN HOUR.\n\nI GET A CALL AND OUR ELDEST IS COMING HOME EARLY. MY HEART SINKS BUT SHE TELLS ME ALL IS GOOD. SHE NEEDS TO GET A SHOT AND PHYSICAL AND TODAY WAS A LITTLE SLOW.\n\nI ALLOW A/C TECHNICIANS TO PARK IN OUR DRIVEWAY WHILE WORKING ON A NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY. I OFFERED WATER AND BATHROOMS IF NEEDED.\n\nELDEST COMES HOME AND TELLS WHEELS AND I ABOUT HER MUCH BETTER DAY. IT WAS SO GLORIOUS TO HEAR IT WAS MUCH BETTER. SHE ALSO LOOKED REALLY TEACHER-LIKE IN HER OUTFIT.\n\nWE DECIDE TO CELEBRATE AND TAKE OUR ELDEST OUT TO OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT FELINI'S CAFE. WE HAVE A WONDERFUL DINNER WITH GOOD CONVERSATIONS , FOOD , WINE , AND SERVICE FROM A REALLY NICE WAITER/OWNER. I SO ENJOYED LAUGHING WITH OUR ELDEST AND WHEEL'S.\n\nBACK HOME WE SETTLE IN. OUR KID WANTS TO KEEP THE CELEBRATION GOING BY SMOKING A BOWL WITH HER.......SO WE DID.\n\nALL OF US DO OUR WEDNESDAY FACETIME AND MY GOD IT IS NICE. I JUST ADORE LOOKING AT MY KID'S FACES. IT JUST AMAZES ME HOW FAST TIME IS GOING BY AND HOW ADULT THEY ARE NOW.\n\nWE WATCH 2 EPISODES OF RESIDENT ALIEN. AGAIN.....VERY GOOD. WE ALSO WATCH AN EPISODE OF THE CONNORS. IT WAS GOOD.\n\nI WAS FIGHTING TO STAY AWAKE AROUND 10PM SO I DECIDE TO HEAD TO BED. I DID NOT CHECK EMAILS BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WOULD KEEP ME AWAKE. OVERALL , I SLEPT GOOD. I MAY WANT TO \" SMOKE \" EACH NIGHT.\n\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 - 24\n\nIT TAKES 4 1/2 TRAILER FULLS OF MULCH TO DO ALL OUR GARDENS. TODAY I GOT TRAILER LOAD #3 DONE. SO FAR SO GOOD WITH THE NEW WHEEL AND BEARINGS. I LIKE HOW WHEELS CAME OUT TO HELP WHEN I WAS 2 MINUTES FROM BEING DONE.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL FOR A BEER AND LIQUOR DELIVERY. I ALSO TRIED TO CHANGE A PASSWORD BACK TO WHAT IT WAS FOR OUR INTERNET ACCESS AND OF COURSE IT WAS A NIGHTMARE. I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED IT.\n\nELDEST HAS FRIENDS OVER AND HER CONFIDENCE SEEMS TO BE IN A VERY GOOD PLACE.\n\nBACK HOME WHEELS MAKES SOME BURGERS. EATING THEM WITH NO ROLL KINDA BLOWS. I AM NOT GOING HARDCORE ON DIETING BUT STILL TRYING MY BEST. 15 POUNDS LOST.\n\nBACK TO THE NAIL FOR A NIGHT I KNEW BE BAD......REALLY BAD. THE MUSICIAN HAD A SHIT LOAD OF ACCOLADES AND WAS REALLY GOOD BUT ZERO PEOPLE SHOWED UP. I STOPPED THE SHOW AT 9PM AND WE WERE CLOSED BY 9:45PM. THE PROMOTER DID NOT TAKE MY ADVICE BY ADDING LOCAL ACTS.\n\nBACK HOME IN THE RAIN I SETTLE IN. I SO FELT LIKE DRINKING. WHEELS AND I WATCHED 2 EPISODES OF RESIDENT ALIEN. AGAIN , THEY WERE GOOD.\n\nI HEAD TO BED AND TOSS AND TURN UNTIL 4:30AM. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I TAKE ONE ADVIL AND FALL ASLEEP UNTIL 8:30AM. I EVEN HAD SOME DREAMS IN THERE.\n\nFRIDAY 5 - 10 - 24\n\n4 BARTENDERS DANCING TO THE BAND'S MUSIC BEHIND THE BAR COULD BE THE MOST ADORABLE THING I SAW THIS YEAR. I LOVED IT AND IT MADE ME LAUGH.\n\nRAIN PREVENTED ME FROM MULCHING TODAY. TEMPS DROPPED WHICH IS FINE BUT THE RAIN WAS CONSISTENT. THE LAST TIME I MULCHED IN THE RAIN MY TRAILER TIRE FELL OFF AND I COMPLETELY RUINED THE RIM.\n\nI DRIVE TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT. I GOT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THINGS DONE. I BROUGHT THE PUP WITH ME TOO.\n\nSTOP AND GET GAS. THAN BACK HOME I CHILL.\n\nEMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF CHECKED MANY TIMES EVERY DAY.\n\nNEXT DOOR WEBSITE - OUR PORTABLE CARPET / FABRIC CLEANING MACHINE BROKE SO I HAVE POTENTIAL OF PICKING UP A STILL IN THE BOX BISSELL BRAND NEW ONE FOR.......FREE.\n\nDINNER WITH WHEELS. WE HAVE CHICKEN CAESAR SPINACH WRAPS. THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.\n\nI HEAD BACK TO THE NAIL AND BEGIN FINAL PREP AND THE BANDS AND FANS LOAD IN. I TRULY WAS EXPECTING OVER 120 PEOPLE BUT WE ONLY DID A LITTLE OVER HALF.\n\nI REALLY LIKE OUR BARTENDERS. ALL OF THEM ARE PRETTY DAMN COOL AND FUN TO WORK WITH. PLUS.......THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB.\n\nONE PERSON ORDERED EVERYTHING ON THE MENU PLUS 2 MORE PIZZAS.\n\nJUST 3 BANDS SO THE NIGHT MOVED QUICKLY. I LIKED ALL THE ACTS TONIGHT.\n\nA VERY YOUNG CROWD AND MAN IT MAKES ME FEEL SO OLD. I SO WISH I HAD MY OLD COLLEGE SOCCER ASS BODY BACK.\n\nVILLANOVA FANS ASKING TO PUT ON THE KNICKS GAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE VILLANOVA PLAYERS ON THEIR ROSTER. YEAH.....I SAID NO. I'M STILL PISSED THE 76ERS LOST TO THEM. OH, I WAS HAPPY TH EPACERS BEAT THEM TONIGHT.\n\nPHILLIES WITH A NICE BIG WIN OVER A BAD TEAM. YOU REALLY NEED TO WIN THE VERY WINNABLE GAMES TO STAY IN A PLAY-OFF RACE.\n\nI LET THE BARTENDERS ROLL OUT SINCE THEY WERE GOING TO ANOTHER BAR FOR KARAOKE. I CLOSE BY MYSELF WHICH WAS OKAY. THEY ASK ME TO GO WITH THEM. I WAS 50-50. LAST TIME I WENT I DID HAVE A GOOD TIME AND PAID FOR AN OPEN BAR FOR 25 PEOPLE FOR 2 HOURS.\n\nI HEAD HOME BY 11:30PM AND WAS ABSOLUTELY STARVING. WHAT THE HELL ? I ATE TOO MUCH.\n\nI WATCH TV , HAVE SOME SNACKS , AND MAKE A NIGHT CAP.\n\nBY 12:30AM I WAS TIRED AND WENT TO BED. I SLEPT DECENT BECAUSE I TOOK AN ADVIL.\n\nANOTHER DAY IN THE BOOKS. TIME GOES TOO FAST.\n\nSUNDAY 5 - 11 - 24\n\nWEIRD :\n\n8:30PM - ON THE DOOR FRIDAY NIGHT I VISIONED A MAN JUMPING OUT OF A CAR AND POINTING A GUN AT ME AND THE FRONT DOOR AS I WAS TRYING TO CLOSE IT. I SCREAMED TO PATRONS TO MOVE FROM THE BAR SIDE TO THE MAIN ROOM. I ALSO YELLED TO A BARTENDER TO CALL 911.\n\n10PM - I WALK OUTSIDE AND A GUY COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS , \" MAN , A BLACK SUV JUST DROVE BY WITH A GUY HANGING OUT THE WINDOW LAUGHING. HE SHOT A BEEBE GUN AT US. LUCKILY IT HIT NO ONE. \"\n\nTO ME THIS WAS WEIRD AND ANOTHER VISION HAPPENED AGAIN LAST NIGHT BUT I FORGET IT NOW.\n\nMY PHILLY AUNT CALLS ME 3 TIMES. I FINALLY LET MY YOUNGEST HANDLE IT. SHE WANTED TO BE TAUGHT (AGAIN) HOW TO TURN THE TV ON AND OFF.\n\nPHILLIES WIN AGAIN OVER A BAD TEAM. THESE GAMES MUST BE WON TO STAY IN THE PLAY-OFF HUNT.\n\nCUT THE LAWN TODAY WITH RIDING MOWER AND PUSH MOWER. MAN , OUR GRASS GROWS FAST.\n\nNEXT DOOR - TOOK A RIDE AND PICKED UP AND BRAND NEW , STILL IN THE BOX , BISSELL SPOT CLEANING VACUUM. THE ONE WE HAD IS NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY SO WE THREW IT OUT. THE OLDER GENTLEMAN WHO GAVE IT TO ME WAS SUPER COOL.\n\nTRUMP IN WILDWOOD. GO TRUMP !!!\n\nWHEELS AND HER BROTHER HEAD TO MOM'S HOUSE TO MULCH , PLANT FLOWERS , AND DO YARD WORK. NO ONE EVER HELPS ME.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT.\n\nBACK HOME I RECEIVE A CALL A BACK ORDERED CAPE MAY KEG HAS ARRIVED. I RETURN TO THE NAIL AGAIN FOR PICKUP. THIS IS THE ONE GOOD THING BEING ONLY 3 1/2 MILES FROM WORK.\n\nBACK HOME AGAIN I SETTLE IN AND SHOWER.\n\nBY 5PM WE HEAD TO A BROTHER'S HOUSE FOR A MOTHER'S DAY DINNER. I ARRIVE AND THEY HAVE 10 WORKERS MULCHING HIS PROPERTY. HE GAVE THEM ALL BEERS AT ONE POINT. NO ONE EVER HELPS ME.\n\nA NICE DINNER BUT FOOD RAN OUT.\n\nI ROLL OUT AT 6PM TO HEAD TO THE NAIL WHERE ALL 4 BANDS ARRIVED AT ONCE. YEP , THIS WAS FUN.\n\nKIDS ROLL OUT FROM DINNER BUT STOP AT MCDONALDS FIRST.\n\nTHE NIGHT MOVED QUICKLY AND THE MUSIC WAS COOL. ONE BAND HAD A FLUTE WHICH WAS DIFFERENT.\n\nLITTLE ISSUE :\n\n- GUY COMES TO THE DOOR AND DOES NOT HAVE CASH FOR THE $10 COVER. I DIRECT HIM TO THE ATM MACHINE. HE NEVER RETURN TO PAY. AN HOUR LATER I ASK HIM FOR THE COVER WHEN HE IS OUTSIDE SMOKING WITH FRIENDS. I ASK HIM AGAIN. HE RESPONDS , \" SURE , SURE \" AND DOESN'T PAY. I NOW BLOCK THE DOOR AND AFTER 20 MINUTES HE WANTS TO GET BACK IN. HE PAYS THE COVER. MY ISSUE IS I SHOULD NOT GO HUNTING FOR MONEY OR A PERSON FOR A COVER CHARGE.\n\nLITTLE ISSUE 2 :\n\n- A GUY COMES IN AND I ASK , \" ARE YOU HERE FOR THE SHOW OR JUST COMING IN ? \" HE REPLIES , \" OH , AH , UM , JUST COMING IN FOR A BEER. \" I TELL HIM , \" OK , I WILL PAY YOUR COVER BUT PLEASE IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC DONATE TO THESE HARD WORKING MUSICIANS. \" I WATCH HIM WALK DOWN THE BAR RIGHT TO BAND MEMBERS AND STARTS HUGGING THEM. I AM LITERALLY RIGHT BEHIND HIM AND TAP HIS SHOULDER AND SAY , \" THERE IS A $10 COVER CHARGE TONIGHT FOR THE BANDS \" HE PAYS. YEP , PEOPLE WILL \" SAY \" THEY ARE NOT HERE FOR THE SHOW TO WEASEL OUT OF A COVER CHARGE.\n\nYOUNGEST AND I ROLL OUT AROUND 11:45PM. WE CHILL AT HOME WITH SOME NIGHT CAPS , MOZZARELLA , PRETZELS , AND WATCH SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. WE HEAD TO BED AT 1AM.\n\nELDEST STAYS AT THE BAR WITH HER BOYFRIEND AS ANOTHER FRIEND ARRIVES TO GIVE OUR TRAVEL ROKU BACK.\n\nI SLEPT OKAY BUT MUCH BETTER AFTER I TOOK AN ADVIL.\n\nSUNDAY 5 - 12 - 24\n\nTHIS WAS A FUN DAY , BUT OF COURSE THE GODS HAVE TO FUCK IT UP FOR ME A LITTLE BIT TO KEEP ME IN PLACE.\n\nLET THE DAY BEGIN :\n\nI TAKE A RIDE TO KING OF PRUSSIA TO PICK UP A 50\" FLAT SCREEN TV. IT HAS ORIGINAL REMOTE , POWER SUPPLY , AND HDMI PORTS FOR A ROKU. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE STAND IT SITS ON HAS NO BOLTS TO SECURE IT. THE PICK UP WAS QUICK AND EASY. THE GUY AND HIS SON CARRIED THE TV AND PARTS OUT TO MY CAR.\n\nI ARRIVE HOME AND WHEELS HELPS ME UNLOAD. IN SECONDS I INSTALL AND SECURE THE FOOT STAND TO THE TV. MY YOUNGEST HELPS ME SET IT UP IN OUR ELDEST BEDROOM. WE ACTIVATE ROKU STREAMING IN MINUTES. THIS WAS ALL FREE. ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL FB MARKETPLACE TRANSACTION.\n\nNEXT WE ALL LOAD UP OUR VAN AND GET IN. I GO TO START IT AND HEAR CLICKING SOUNDS. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP BECAUSE THE VAN'S ELECTRONICS WERE ACTING DIFFERENT THE LAST 2 DAYS. WE MOVE TO ANOTHER CAR.\n\nOFF TO MY BROTHER'S HOUSE FOR A REALLY NICE MOTHER'S DAY BREAKFAST/BRUNCH. THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD ( DIDN'T HELP MY DIET ) , FUN CONVERSATION , AND OF COURSE LOTS OF LAUGHS. I ENJOYED MY BROTHER'S DOG AND HIS KIDS PLAYING MUSIC ON THEIR CLARINETS / FLUTES.\n\nI ASKED MY SISTER-IN-LAW BECAUSE SHE IS A VERY SMART CHICK WHY THESE COLLEGE KIDS ARE PROTESTING THE ISRAELI / HAMAS WAR. I TRULY WANT TO KNOW AS I DISCUSSED IT WITH MY YOUNGEST AND OTHERS. MY QUESTION IS , \" BOTH THESE FACTIONS WANT TO KILL EACH OTHER. I CAN'T BLAME ISRAELI BECAUSE THE HAMAS HAD VISCOUSLY AND BRUTALLY KILLED WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE ISRAELI PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE WILL NOT CONCEDE OR TRUCE EVER. SO HOW CAN THE UNITED STATES STOP THIS WAR ? IF THE U.S. STOPS THE FUNDING WILL THIS STOP THE WAR ? I THINK THAT IS THE MAIN REASON THESE COLLEGE KIDS ARE PROTESTING. I UNDERSTAND PROTESTING BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A TOUGH ONE TO WIN.\n\nSHE DID TELL ME ABOUT THE SAME ANSWER AND THIS WAR COULD NEVER BE STOPPED. BUT , MINUTES LATER , SHE SAID BIDEN WAS SPINELESS AND TRUMP COULD STOP THE WAR. I AM NOT A POLITICAL TALKER SO ME AND THE GIRLS JUST DROPPED THE SUBJECT.\n\nSPEAKING OF TRUMP , WILDWOOD HOSTED ONE OF HIS RALLIES. THE NEWS REPORTED 80-100K PEOPLE ATTENDING. WE HAD RENTERS THERE ALONG WITH OUR FELLOW CONDO OWNERS WHO SAID THE NUMBERS WERE VERY HIGH BUT NOT THAT HIGH. ONE RENTER SAID , \" IF THERE WAS 100,000 PEOPLE THAT WOULD FILL A LARGE STADIUM. I WAS THERE AND THERE COULDN'T OF BEEN MORE THAN 20K. SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE TOLD ME THIS TOO. EITHER WAY , TRUMP BRINGS THE PEOPLE. I DON'T GET IT BUT HE DOES. HE IS A ROCK STAR THAT BANGS PORN STARS AND OTHER WOMAN WHILE HIS WIFE WAS PREGNANT. WHO WOULDN'T LIKE THAT ? OH WAIT , MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS WOULD NOT. AHHH WHO CARES THIS IS WHAT HE IS AND STILL GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY. GO TRUMP !!\n\nAGAIN , I AM NOT A BIDEN FAN BUT DEFINITELY NOT A TRUMP FAN EITHER. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE 330 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THESE ARE THE TWO WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR ?\n\nANYWAY , WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME AND I THINK GOING OUT TO RESTAURANTS FOR OVER PRICED BRUNCHES IS OUT OF OUR FAMILY'S FUTURE.\n\nNEXT STOP WAS PEPBOYS TO PICK UP A VAN BATTERY FOR $233.......NICE. I MADE THE GIRL LAUGH BECAUSE SHE ASKED ME IF I AM HAVING PEPBOYS INSTALL IT. I SAID , \" I HAVE DONE SEVERAL BATTERY CHANGES SO I SHOULD BE OKAY. \" SHE RESPONDS , \" I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALOT OF PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE INSTALLING THEIR OWN BATTERIES. ARE YOU SURE ? \" I REPLY , \" WELL , I LEARNED FROM MY LAST 2 TIMES. THE FIRST TIME I INSTALLED A NEW BATTERY AND THE WHEELS FELL OFF. I DID NOT THINK THIS WAS RIGHT. THE 2ND TIME I LOST FEELING IN MY RIGHT ARM. I STILL HAVE NO FEELING IN MY RIGHT HAND. BUT , THE 3RD TIME INSTALLING A BATTERY I WAS OKAY. \"\n\nOH THE BROOMALL PEPBOYS IS ONLY SERVICE NOW , NO GETTING PARTS.\n\nNEXT STOP IS A GRADUATION PARTY FOR OUR YOUNGEST FRIEND. I ADORE THIS GIRL AND SO PROUD SHE GRADUATED PENN STATE COLLEGE. SHE IS ADORABLE AND LIVES THE WORLD THE WAY SHE WANTS. IT IS SO REFRESHING TO SEE HER. SHE IS LIKE A 60'S/70'S GIRL LIVING IN THE PRESENT.\n\nANOTHER FUN PARTY WITH LOTS OF LAUGHS AND GOOD FOOD. AGAIN , NOT HELPING MY DIET. IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH BUT ONE TIME I MADE A ELDERLY GRANDMA SPIT OUT HER FOOD DURING ONE JOKE. THE WHOLE TABLE ROARED. ANOTHER JOKE WAS THIS FAMILY HAD FIRE DAMAGE TO THEIR HOME 6+ YEARS AGO. THAT PART IS NOT FUNNY. THIS WAS THE FIRST PARTY THEY HAVE HOSTED USING THIS HOUSE. AFTER 6+ YEARS CONSTRUCTION WAS ABOUT HALFWAY DONE AT MOST. THEY SHOWED US THEIR BATHROOM AND KITCHEN AREAS ( NO CABINETS OR COUNTER TOPS) SO I TOLD THEM \" YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE YOUR TIME REMODELING. \"\n\nI LEAVE THE PARTY AFTER JUST AN HOUR TO GO HOME AND INSTALL THIS VAN BATTERY. I FIND OUT IT HAS A \" PROFESSIONAL SERVICE ONLY \" BAR BLOCKING THE BATTERY. THE POWER OF GOOGLE HELPED ME. I REPLACED THE BATTERY IN ABOUT 35 MINUTES. I LISTEN TO THE PHILLIES LOSE TO THE WORST TEAM IN BASEBALL IN EXTRA INNINGS......BLOW.\n\nTHE KIDS AND WHEELS ARRIVE HOME JUST AS I FINISHED.\n\nWE LOAD UP THE VAN AND HEAD TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT.\n\nWE HEAD TO SOUTH PHILLY TO DROP OFF OUR YOUNGEST. MAN, DID I TRY TO CONVINCE HER TO COME WITH US.\n\nNEXT WE HEAD EAST. WE MAKE GOOD TIME AND LISTEN TO OUR NEW COMMERCIAL-FREE SPOTIFY SONGS COMPLIMENTS OF OUR ELDEST.\n\nTHE GAME PLAN WAS TO TAKE WHEELS OUT FOR A DRINK OR SOMETHING FOR MOTHER'S DAY BUT SHE DECIDED TO JUST STAY IN. WE UNLOAD , WALK THE PUP , MADE SOME NIGHT CAPS , AND WATCHED 2 EPISODES OF RESIDENT ALIEN. BOTH WERE GOOD AGAIN.\n\nI LIKE THIS BED AND LOOK FORWARD TO SLEEPING IN IT. I SLEPT OKAY. THE PUP JOINED ME.\n\nMONDAY 5 - 13 - 24\n\nTHERE IS JUST SOMETHING MAGICAL WALKING THE BEACH AND GAZING AT THE OCEAN.\n\nMY DAY :\n\nIT IS MIND BLOWING THAT TRUMP ACTUALLY LEADS THE POLLS AS OF TODAY. HE'S BANGING PORN STARS , FAILED BUSINESSES , RIDICULES EVERYONE , IN COURT FOR PROBABLY THE NEXT 2 YEARS , SPEAKS LIKE AN ANGRY CHILD , AND COUNTLESS OTHER THINGS. I GUESS THIS IS COOL TO MORE THAN HALF OUR NATION. GO TRUMP !!\n\nSPEAKING OF TRUMP , I VISITED THE DOG PARK AND THERE WAS A SHIT LOAD OF FENCING BEING TAKEN DOWN FROM HIS RALLY. OUR PUP HAD FUN WITH 8 OTHER DOGS. GO TRUMP !!\n\nMORE TRUMP - BEING INTERVIEWED TRUMP SAYS TO THE REPORTER , \" YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK. BIDEN'S NEW BILL SAYS TO REMOVE ALL \" ..............AND HE JUST TALKS GIBBERISH FOR 5 MINUTES. THEY GET THE DOCUMENTS FOR THE BILL AND THE INTERVIEWER STOPS THE INTERVIEW SO TRUMP CAN FIND WHAT HE JUST CLAIMED ABOUT BIDEN'S NEW BILL. TRUMP COULDN'T FIND IT. THERE WAS SUCH AN AWKWARD SILENCE. GO TRUMP !!!\n\nOH , I LOST MY CAP FOR A POOP BAG HOLDER FOR OUR PUP. I BACK TRACKED 3 DIFFERENT TIMES AND COULDN'T FIND IT.......BLOW.\n\nBACK HOME I DO SOME VERY LITTLE PROJECTS. IT IS KINDA NICE NOT HAVING BIG THINGS TO DO. I ALSO DO ALOT OF COMPUTER WORK WITH BANDS.\n\nMY BROTHER GAVE ME CODES FOR PARAMOUNT+ AND I INSTALLED IT ON MY TRAVEL ROKU. THIS IS A NICE GESTURE FROM HIM. I NOW CAN WATCH 2 SERIES THAT CHANGED FROM PARAMOUNT TO PARAMOUNT + BECAUSE OF GREED. THOSE 2 STREAMING SERIES ARE STAR TREK DISCOVERY (EXCELLENT) AND THE NEW FRASIER (GOOD).\n\nWALK THE PUP ON THE BEACH AT LEAST 3 TIMES TODAY. EVERY TIME IT IS WONDERFUL.\n\nWHEELS TOLD ME IT BE LOW 60 DEGREE WEATHER ALL WEEK. SHE WAS SPOT ON. I AM OKAY WITH LOW TO MID 60'S.\n\nWHEELS AND I WALK THE BOARDS AND I TAKE A PICTURE OF A SHIRT FOR SALE - \" WE NEED A GO AROUND \" TRUMP'S PICTURE IS ON IT. I SEND IT TO A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS A TRUMP FAN. GO TRUMP !!\n\nTHE NEW BOARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL. BACK HOME WE TAKE A RIDE FOR DINNER AT PASTA PESTO BAR & GRILL. I FORGOT HOW GOOD THIS PLACE IS. SERVICE IS VERY GOOD , FOOD IS EXCELLENT , AMBIANCE EXCELLENT , PESTO SAUCE INCREDIBLE ( ALMOST BOUGHT A LARGE CUP OF IT ) , PORTIONS ARE BIG , AND PRICING ....WELL A LITTLE PRICEY BUT REASONABLE. A $28 ENTREE HAS 2 MEALS. SO TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE IT FOR LUNCH. I LOOK AT IT AS EACH MEAL WAS $14.\n\nBACK HOME WE FEED AND WALK THE PUP.\n\nWHEELS GOT CHOCOLATES FOR MOTHER'S DAY. I HAD 2 BECAUSE THEY ARE RIGHT IN THE KITCHEN. I MOVED THEM OUT OF SIGHT TO A WALL CABINET, THAN MOVED THEM TO HER BEDROOM. I JUST CAN'T BE AROUND SWEETS.\n\nWE WATCH 2 EPISODES OF THE CONNORS. THEY WERE GOOD. WE ALSO WATCH AN EPISODE OF RESIDENT ALIEN. THIS SERIES KEEPS BEING CONSISTENTLY GOOD.\n\nWE WATCH THE PHILLIES TIE THE METS IN THE 9TH INNING WITH 2 RUNS. THAN WIN IT IN 10 INNINGS. OH , THIS WAS SO NICE TO SEE AGAINST THE STINKIN' RAT BASTARD METS.\n\nTALK TO OUR ELDEST ABOUT HER 2ND WEEK AT THE NEW JOB. I WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT WAS A GOOD DAY. KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED. THIS IS SO BIG FOR HER CONFIDENCE.\n\nTALK TO OUR YOUNGEST WHEN I WAS AT THE DOG PARK.\n\nMY MOM CALLS ME TO LEARN HOW TO TURN ON HER OUTSIDE SPIGOT. SHE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT WHEN I DIRECT HER TO FIND THE SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE BASEMENT.\n\nA COUPLE OF HOURS LATER SHE CALLS MY BROTHER TO STOP BY AND REMOVE A DEAD RABBIT. IT ENDS UP IT WAS A CAT.\n\nTURN ON CNN TO GET UP TO THE SECOND UPDATES ON THE TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL. I AM SURE THEY ARE LYING WHAT IS BEING SAID IN THE COURT HOUSE IN ALMOST REAL TIME. GO TRUMP !!\n\nIN MY OPINION THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TRUMP WILL BE CHARGED WITH ANYTHING IN THIS PORN STAR CASE. YES , THERE IS A HUGE MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE BUT LIKE TRUMP VOTERS THINK , \" IF THE COCK DOESN'T FIT , YOU GOTTA ACQUIT. \" GO TRUMP !!\n\nTUESDAY 5 - 14 - 24\n\nIT'S LIKE A YO-YO........................\n\nEVERY MORNING THE PUP AND I WALK THE BEACH. EACH TIME IT BRINGS NEW HOPE TO OUR DAY. IT IS MAGICAL AND RELIGIOUS WRAPPED IN ONE.\n\nTOOK A RIDE TO HOME DEPOT AND IT WAS NICE JUST TO CASUALLY STROLL THE STORE AND SPEND $240. I AM GONNA START A PROJECT AT THE NAIL THAT WILL REQUIRE MY YOUNGEST AND MAYBE SOME FORMER BARTENDERS.\n\nI HAVE PASSED ICE CREAM SHOPS AND DAIRY QUEEN 4 TIMES THIS WEEK. MAN , IT'S TOUGH NOT TO STOP.\n\nAT HOME I HAVE SOME LEFTOVERS FROM LAST NIGHT'S DINNER.\n\nOFF TO THE DOG PARK TO CHILL WITH SOME PEOPLE AND THEIR PUPS. IT WAS FUN. I ALWAYS TAKE A VIDEO AND SEND IT TO OUR FAMILY GROUP TEXT. OH , ONE GUY CAMPED AT HICKORY HILL STATE PARK. THIS IS ONE EXIT FROM OUR HOUSE.\n\nOH , I FIND THE MISSING TOP PART OF MY LEASH'S SMALL BAG HOLDER. I WAS SO HAPPY I FOUND IT. THANK YOU SAINT ANTHONY.\n\nBACK HOME I TEST SOME KEYS I MADE , CHANGE SOME SIGNS FOR RENTERS , AND CLEAN SOME TRASH IN THE BACK ALLEY.\n\nAARON NOLA PITCHES LIGHTS OUT AND GETS A SHUT-OUT WIN OF 4 - 0 OVER THE STINKN' DIRT BAG METS.....RAT BASTARDS.\n\nWHEELS AND I SOMETIMES COMPARE OUR CONDO TO THE OTHER ONES HERE. THE ONE SUPER NICE THING......LIMITED STEPS........3. THIS IS PRETTY IMPORTANT NOT WALKING UP 2 OR 3 FLIGHTS OF STEPS EVERY TIME YOU NEED SOMETHING. OF COURSE THE BIG DOWNER IS NOT HAVING A BALCONY TO VIEW THE OCEAN. I ALWAYS SAY , \" WE HAVE A 100 LITTLE GOOD THINGS BUT ONE BAD THING WHEN COMPARING. \" IT'S FUNNY , WHEELS ALWAYS SAYS , \" I WOULD NOT TRADE WITH ANYONE. \" ME.....I TAKE THE FRONT UNIT AND TO THIS DAY WE DROPPED THE BALL NOT PURCHASING IT YEARS AGO.\n\nSETTLE IN AND GET A PHONE CALL FROM OUR ELDEST. SHE IS UPSET AGAIN ABOUT HER NEW JOB. THIS PAINS ME TO NO END AND I FEEL SO BAD. I SPEND ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO CALM HER DOWN AND MAKE HER LAUGH. HER AFTERNOON SHIFT GOES MUCH BETTER.\n\nWHEELS AND I HEAD TO NINO'S FAMILY RESTAURANT. WE HAVE GONE HERE MANY TIMES AND IT NEVER DISAPPOINTS. ITALIAN DISHES ARE GOOD , BIG PORTIONS , AND A BYOB. IT IS ALWAYS HALF THE COST AND TWICE THE AMOUNT OF REALLY GOOD ITALIAN FOOD. PUT IT THIS WAY....YOU ALWAYS BRING HOME LEFTOVERS.\n\nLIKE SOME AMERICANS I AM WATCHING VIA CNN THE SECOND BY SECOND TRIAL ON TRUMP , HUSH MONEY , BANGING A PORN STAR , AND MORE. COWEN , HIS FORMER ATTORNEY , SEEMED PRETTY CALM AND COLLECTED DURING A RANT BY DEFENSE LAWYERS.\n\nTHESE ARE THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THIS JOB. NO OTHER PEOPLE ARE THE BEST. I'M TELLING YOU THE BEST. ONLY I HIRE THE BEST FOR THE BEST JOB. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DURING HIS PRESIDENCY HIRED AND FIRED 65 OF THE \" BEST \" PEOPLE. THIS IS THE MOST FIRED BY ANY PRESIDENT. GO TRUMP !!\n\nTRUMP SAID , \" BANGING A PORN STAR WOULD LOOK COOL FOR MEN BUT NOT WOMEN. \" GO TRUMP !!\n\nI SWEAR TRUMP COULD COME OUT AND SAY I BANGED A LITTLE 12 YEAR BOY AND NOT ONE SUPPORTER WOULD RELINQUISH VOTING FOR HIM. GO TRUMP !!\n\nTRUMP WANTS TO DEBATE BIDEN. BIDEN REPLIES , \" I HEAR YOU'RE FREE ON WEDNESDAYS \". WEDNESDAY IS THE ONLY DAY OF THE WEEK TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN COURT ON HIS 35 CHARGES AND BANGING WOMEN WHILE HIS WIFE WAS PREGNANT.\n\nA VERY NICE DINNER AND WE STOP AT THE DOLLAR STORE ON THE WAY HOME. I NEEDED BATTERIES FOR OUR THERMOSTAT.\n\nAT HOME WE FEED THE PUP AND WALK HER ON THE BEACH. IT IS MAGICAL.\n\nWE SETTLE IN AND FINISH SEASON 2 OF RESIDENT ALIEN. IT WAS GOOD.\n\nWHEELS HEADS TO BED AND I WATCH AN EPISODE OF STAR TREK : DISCOVERY. IT WAS GOOD AND THE LEAD ACTRESS IS SO DAMN ADORABLE.\n\nI RESPOND TO SOME EMAILS AND PLAY A GAME OF POKER. I WON AND HEAD TO BED WHERE THE PUP HAS BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 2 HOURS.\n\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 15 - 24\n\nANOTHER DAY AND YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.\n\nSTART THE DAY LIKE ALWAYS WITH COMPUTER STUFF AND PROMOTING BANDS AND THE NAIL.\n\nTHAN ..........I HAD SOME WIND AND A TINY BIT OF RAIN BUT STILL TOOK THE PUP TO THE DOG PARK.\n\nPHILLIES BEAT UP ON METS AGAIN. THIS IS RARE BUT SO FULFILLING.......FOR NOW.\n\nWHEELS AND I SUPPORT A LOCAL BUSINESS CALLED OLYMPIC GRILL. WE STOP BY TO PURCHASE A SPECIALTY BURGER AND CHICKEN SANDWICH. WE FELT BAD FOR THE OWNER WHO HAD HIS EMPLOYEE CALL IN SICK SO HE WAS BY HIMSELF. I SO KNOW THAT FEELING.\n\nWE THAN GO TO POPPI'S FOR DINNER. FOOD IS GOOD , PORTIONS GOOD , PRICING GOOD , AND DESERT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.\n\nBACK HOME WE WATCH THE PHILLIES , ABBOTT ELEMENTARY , THE CONNORS , AND THE 100,000 PYRAMID.\n\nTHE PUP LAYS ON THE BACK TOP OF THE COUCH BEHIND ME. WE NICKNAME HER \" THE CAT \".\n\nTALK TO ELDEST. SHE A DECENT TO GOOD DAY AT HER NEW JOB. WEEK 2 IS IN THE BOOKS. I SWEAR I AM MORE STRESSED THAN HER.\n\nYOUNGEST DISSES US ON OUR WEDNESDAY FAMILY FACETIME DAY. OK , ONLY KIDDING , SHE WENT TO THE MOVIES WITH FRIENDS TO SEE CHALLENGERS. SHE SAID IT WAS GOOD AND ENDED ABRUPTLY.\n\nI WIND DOWN THE NIGHT STREAMING ON OUR ROKU. MAN , THIS IS A GOOD DEVICE TO HAVE.\n\nOFF TO BED AROUND 12 MIDNIGHT BUT TOSS AND TURN THINKING OF BANDS. I GET UP AROUND 2:30AM UNTIL 3:15AM. I GO BACK TO BED AND SLEEP UNTIL 7:30AM.\n\nWALK THE PUP WHERE I SEE 4 SURFERS AND 2 PEOPLE WALKING THEIR DOGS. THE TEMPS ARE AGAIN IN THE MID 60'S JUST LIKE WHEELS TOLD ME EARLIER IN THE WEEK. SHE KNOWS I LIKE WALKING THE BEACH SO TEMPERATURE IS IN THE EQUATION.\n\nTRUMP CASE OFF EVERY WEDNESDAY.\n\nCNN WILL HAVE THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH BIDEN AND TRUMP....THEY THINK. TRUMP SAID HE WOULD DEBATE ANYTIME ANYWHERE , ANYPLACE \". BIDEN REPLIES , \" HOW ABOUT WEDNESDAY JUNE 18TH ? I HEAR YOU'RE AVAILABLE. BALL IS IN YOUR COURT. \" THIS WAS A DIG ON TRUMP HAVING NO TRIAL OBLIGATIONS ON WEDNESDAY OF EACH WEEK.\n\nTRUMP , \" I HAVE NEVER MET THIS WOMEN. \"\n\nMICRO SECOND LATER - PICTURE OF TRUMP , MELANIA , AND STORMY DANIELS. GO TRUMP !!!\n\nTHURSDAY 5 - 16 - 24\n\nTEMPERATURES ARE NICE AT 68 DEGREES.

THIS WEEK BLEW BY.\n\nWE CLEAN AND LOAD UP. WE ROLL OUT AND STOP AT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE TO PICK UP SOME LAMINATED FLOORING.\n\nNEXT STOP IS OUR YOUNGEST IN SOUTH PHILLY. OUR YOUNGEST PICKS UP SANDWICHES FROM SOUTH PHILLY'S PAGANO'S.\n\nNEXT STOP IS A FACEBOOK MARKET PLACE HOME WHICH IS IN A BEAUTIFUL AREA OF VILLANOVA. I PICK UP TV COAXIAL CABLE FOR MY AUNT.\n\nAT HOME WE UNLOAD AND SETTLE IN. WE DO SOME COMPUTER WORK.\n\nI SHOWER WITH THE PUP. YEP , THIS DOG SO NEEDED A BATH. IF YOU SEEN THE SLOBBER DROOLED ON OUR DOG FROM 2 BULLDOGS AT THE DOG PARK.........WELL , OMG. I ACTUALLY TOLD OUR YOUNGEST NOT TO HUG OR KISS HER UNTIL I BATH THE DOG.\n\nMY YOUNGEST AND I START A SERIES CALLED FALLOUT. FIRST HALF OF THE EPISODE WAS VERY GOOD. IT TAILED OFF A LITTLE BUT OVERALL GOOD.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL TO PREP AND LOAD IN BANDS. I HAVE TO THANK THE BAND CORNERS OF SANCTUARY FOR SUPPLYING EVERYTHING AND HELP RUN SOUND. MY GOD IS WAS SEAMLESS , PAIN LESS , AND STRESS FREE.\n\nA BUNCH OF COUSINS STOP IN WHICH WAS VERY NICE TO SEE.\n\nBACK HOME WE CHILL WITH WHEELS WHO WENT TO THE PHILLIES GAME AND STOPPED AT THE NAIL AFTERWARDS WITH FAMILY. SHE AND FAMILY WERE ON TV AS THEIR SEATS WERE BEHIND HOME PLATE.\n\nWE WATCH AN EPISODE OF COMMUNITY ALONG WITH A NIGHTCAP.\n\nBY 1AM IT IS OFF TO BED.\n\nON A SAD NOTE IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS WHEELS LOST A FELLOW SOFTBALL FRIEND TO CANCER. LIFE IS SHORT MY FRIENDS SO TRY NOT TO BE A DICK IN LIFE.\n\nSATURDAY 5 - 18 - 24\n\nPHILLIES COME BACK TO BEAT LAST PLACE NATIONALS. THEY TIED IT IN THE 9TH WITH A 2 OUT HOME RUN AND THAN WON IT IN THE 10TH ON A SAC FLY. IT WAS FUN AND YOU HAVE TO BEAT THESE WEAKER TEAMS.\n\nDID NOT SLEEP THE BEST.\n\nA FAIR AMOUNT OF OUTSIDE PROJECTS BUT DUE TO RAIN AND SHOWS ALMOST EVERY NIGHT AT THE NAIL IT IS PREVENTING ME.\n\nWHEELS AND YOUNGEST PICK UP DESERTS AT A LOCAL BAKERY , I HEAD TO THE NAIL , AND OUR ELDEST HEADS TO A COUSIN'S GET TOGETHER. OF COURSE I HAD TO STOP AT THE NAIL FIRST.\n\nAT A FAMILY PARTY AND IT WAS FUN WITH VERY GOOD FOOD. ABOUT 40 FAMILY SHOWED UP. I WAS NOT EVEN THERE 15 SECONDS AND I WAS DOING SHOTS OF CROWN ROYAL WITH MY COUSIN , WHEELS , AND 2 KIDS. IT WAS REALLY NICE SEEING EVERYONE. I ATE TOO MUCH........DAMN IT.\n\nI DRIVE MY YOUNGEST BACK TO SOUTH PHILLY AND MAN IT WAS TIRESOME. TRAFFIC WAS BAD AND THE ROUND TRIP TOOK 1 1/2 HOURS. I WANTED TO SLEEP SO BAD BEFORE I HAD A 7 HOUR SHIFT AT THE NAIL.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL WHERE I LET A GUY BOOK THE WHOLE SHOW. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY I DISAGREED WITH HIM BUT HE ASSURED ME IT BE A \" PACKED NIGHT \". WHEN WILL I LEARN. I LET THE 2ND BARTENDER GO HOME AT 9:30PM.\n\nONE BAND DID EXCEL. THEY ARE CALLED MILOU SKY. I SOMETIMES POST A SHORT VIDEO OF A BAND PERFORMING AND CALL IT \" THIS IS WHY. \" I DID IT TONIGHT. I DID NOT KNOW THEY HAD 19+K FOLLOWERS ON FACEBOOK AND 100+K FOLLOWERS ON INSTAGRAM. THAT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.\n\nHEAD HOME TIRED , HUNGRY , AND TIRED. I WATCH SOME TV , MAKE A NIGHT CAP , AND SNACK ON CASHEWS UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP IN MY CHAIR.\n\nWAKE UP AT 3AM AND HEAD TO BED. THE PUP JOINS ME LATER.\n\nSUNDAY 5 - 19 - 24\n\nWELP , THAT WAS A DIFFERENT NIGHT OF MUSIC.\n\nGOT SOME PROJECTS DONE TODAY :\n\n- WENT TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT.

SO , I MADE A SIGN AND LEFT A BLACK SHARPIE - \" MARK YOUR CUP ? \"\n\n- REPLACED A FAUCET STRAINER.\n\n- INSTALLED MY MOTORCYCLE BATTERY AND NOTICED I AM MISSING A SPECIAL ORDER TIRE CAP. IT EITHER FELL OFF OR SOMEONE TOOK IT.......BLOW. OH , I BURNED MY FOREARM WHILE ADJUSTING THE IDLE.\n\n- TEST RODE THE BIKE.......LIKE A GLOVE !!\n\n- WENT ON GARAGE ROOF TO DO A SHINGLE PATCH. I TOOK SOME SHINGLES FROM OUR MOUNTAIN HOUSE ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND FINALLY DID THIS PROJECT. MY ELDEST TOOK A PICTURE OF ME SITTING ON THE ROOF IN A FIRE PIT CHAIR.\n\nIT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING WITH OUR DRIVEWAY BORDERS ALONG THE STREET. I NOTICE A 12 INCH GAP ON THE BORDER WHEN I PULLED UP AND SAID TO MYSELF , \" WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT ? \" IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY LARGE TRUCK SLAMMED THE BEJESUS OUT OF THE 6X6 BORDER AND SEPARATED THESE STREET BEAMS. I CAN NOT IMAGINE ME FIGURING OUT A WAY TO JOIN THESE BACK TOGETHER SO MOST LIKELY I WILL JUST FIND A PIECE TO FILL THE GAP.\n\nTRIED TO NAP. I WANTED TO MULCH OR WEED OUR VEGETABLE GARDEN BUT RAN OUT OF ENERGY AND TIME.\n\nPHILLIES WITH A GOOD WIN OVER A BAD TEAM AGAIN. THESE WINS ARE VITAL FOR PLAY-OFF POSITIONING LATER IN THE SEASON.\n\n2 NBA AWAY TEAMS COME BACK FROM BIG DEFICITS TO WIN THEIR GAME 7'S. IT WAS AMAZING. I ALMOST ALWAYS WANT THE HOME TEAM TO WIN BECAUSE I KNOW THE FEELING OF ATTENDING A GAME AND YOUR TEAM BLOWS IT.\n\n- HAPPY TO SEE THE KNICKS SHIT THE BED AT HOME AFTER LEADING BY 20+ POINTS.\n\n- A LITTLE SAD TO SEE DENVER LOSE TO MINNESOTA AFTER BEING UP 17 POINTS.\n\nOFF TO THE NAIL FOR A CRAZY FUN NIGHT.\n\n- ONE BAND DID THE CONGA LINE AROUND THE NAIL TO THE HARRY BELLEFONTE SONG \" SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE \". THEY ALSO TOOK OFF THEIR SHIRTS ( NOT A GOOD SIGHT ) , SWEAT LIKE THE BEJESUS WHICH MADE THE ROOM SMELL VERY CHEESY IN A NOT A GOOD WAY , JUMPED ON THE BAR , AND HAD HORNS IN THEIR BAND ( THIS IS ALWAYS GOOD ). THEY WERE CALLED HANS GRUBER & THE DIEHARDS ( BEST NAME EVER ). WE POSTED A FB VIDEO OF THEM.\n\n- THEY HAD YOU DO SQUATS DURING A SONG.\n\n- THEY ALSO HAD EVERYONE FORM A LARGE HALF CIRCLE IN FRONT OF THE BAND AND PUT.......A SOCK ON THEIR HAND. IT WAS HILARIOUS.\n\n- ANOTHER BAND HAD A FEMALE LEAD SINGER DRESSED IN SKIN TIGHT CLOTH SPANDEX-LIKE OUTFIT. OK , THIS IS COOL. TO THE GUY WHO SUPPORTED THIS BAND WHO ALSO HAD A SKIN TIGHT CLOTH OUTFIT.......NOT SO GOOD. THIS BAND WAS FUN AND CALLED BOND BREAKR.\n\n- NEXT BAND I THINK HAD 15 BAND MEMBERS , HORNS , LOTS OF SINGERS , AND MORE. OKAY , MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT 7 MEMBERS BUT AGAIN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AND FUN. THEY WERE CALLED NIKKI NAILBOMB AND THE AMORPHOUS BLOB ORCHESTRA.\n\nREALLY DUG THE LAST BAND SO MUCH SO THE CROWD AND MYSELF ASKED THEM TO PLAY LONGER. THE FEMALE LEAD SINGER SHYLY AND EMBARRASSINGLY , \" WE DON'T KNOW ANY MORE \". THEY WERE CALLED DAIZIE DARKER.\n\n- GOOD FINE PERFORMANCES FROM LOCAL BAND THE GERIATRICS.

MY GOD YOU WERE AWESOME IN MY HEADROOM.\n\n- BACK HOME I UNLOAD ALL MULCH ALONG OUR LEFT GARDEN. I ACTUALLY PARK SIDEWAYS ON THE SLIGHT HILL ELDEST COMES HOME BECAUSE A STUDENT HAD \" HOOF & ASS TO MOUTH \". THEY SENT HIM HOME AND SHE SHOWERED FOR 2 HOURS.\n\n- BROTHER-IN-LAW DROPS OFF SLEEPING BAGS , CLOTHES , AND SOME SPARKLING WINE FOR OUR KIDS.\n\n- I RIDE MY MOTORCYCLE TO THE NAIL TO PREP FOR THE NIGHT. THIS WAS SO WELCOMED AS THE COOL AIR COOLED MY SWEATY DISGUSTING FAT BODY. HOW DO WOMEN EVEN HAVE SEX WITH US ?\n\n- I RIDE BACK HOME TAKING THE BACK WAYS. I ENJOY DOING THIS. PLU MY BIKE IS NOT INSPECTED YET.\n\n- I CUT THE LAWN USING THE RIDING MOWER AND PUSH MOWER. I AM DOING THIS BECAUSE THE GRASS IS HIGH ALREADY AND I AM SUPPOSE TO GO AWAY FOR 2 DAYS. KEY WORDS \" SUPPOSE TO \".\n\nUNLOCK THE UTILITY TRAILER AND LOAD IT AND MOWERS BACK INTO THE GARAGE.\n\n- FOUND A REGULAR TIRE CAP FOR MY MOTORCYCLE FRONT WHEEL. I AM KINDA BUMMING THE REALLY NICE CUSTOM ONE IS MISSING.\n\nTRY TO NAP. I AM ALREADY EXHAUSTED AND I STILL HAVE A 6 HOUR SHIFT AT THE NAIL.\n\nGOOGLE ABOUT A PETCOCK VALVE FOR A MOTORCYCLE. IT CONTROLS GAS TO THE CARBURETOR. IF YOU RUN OUT OF GAS THAN YOU CAN SWITCH IT TO \" RESERVE \". THIS GETS YOU ABOUT ANOTHER 25-50 MILES.\n\nNO DINNER , I JUST WASN'T HUNGRY.\n\nI RIDE MY BIKE TO THE NAIL AND A GUY KNOWS VTX HONDAS VERY WELL.\n\n3 ACTS AND A LITTLE DIFFERENT STYLE OF MUSIC.

HE OFFERED TO HELP INSTALL NEW LAMINATED WOOD FLOORS AT THE NAIL. THIS WILL CHANGE MY NEXT 2 DAYS BUT SO WORTH IT.\n\nTHE ACTS WRAP UP AND I CLOSE. I RIDE HOME PEACEFULLY. JESUS THIS WAS A LONG DAY AND NIGHT.\n\nI MAKE A NIGHT CAP , EAT NOTHING , AND HEAD TO BED AROUND 1AM. I REALLY NEED TO SHOWER. I PUT SOME LOTION ON MY LEFT EYE WHICH LOOKS LIKE MIKE TYSON HIT ME.\n\nTUESDAY 5 - 21 - 24\n\nFOUR DOUBLE SHIFTS IN A ROW , A DAY OFF , THAN 5 MORE STRAIGHT DOUBLE SHIFTS.\n\nLET'S SEE WHAT I DID ON MY DAY OFF ?\n\n- UP AT 6:30AM TO SHOWER , CHECK EMAILS , BLOG , AND LOAD VAN.\n\n- BY 7:30AM WHEEL'S BEST FRIEND ARRIVES AND ALL OF US HEAD TO THE AIRPORT.\n\n- 8AM - SEND UP A WAKE-UP TEXT TO OUR ELDEST.\n\n- 8:10AM - SEND A 2ND WAKE-UP TEXT TO OUR ELDEST.\n\n- 8:15AM TO 9AM I CALL OUR HOME AND ELDEST CELL PHONE REPEATEDLY.
