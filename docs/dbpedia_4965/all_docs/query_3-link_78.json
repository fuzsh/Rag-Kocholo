The ideal article for a place will give the reader a feel for what it was like to live at that location at the time their relatives were alive there. Also desirable are links to organizations that may be repositories of genealogical information..\n\nPlease help to improve this page yourself if you can.\n\nThis article is about the county in Connecticut. For the town in Connecticut, see Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nFairfield County is a county in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Connecticut, as well as its fastest-growing from 2010 to 2018 and largest in terms of population.[1] As of the 2010 census, the county's population was 916,829, estimated to have increased by 3.6% to 949,921 in 2017, and decreased to 943,332 in 2019.[2] The most populous county in the state, the county population represents a little over 25% of Connecticut's overall population and is one of its fastest-growing counties. The closest to the center of the New York metropolitan area, the county contains four of the state's largest cities–Bridgeport (1st), Stamford (3rd), Norwalk (6th), and Danbury (7th)–whose combined population of 433,368 is nearly half the county's total population.\n\nThe United States Office of Management and Budget has designated Fairfield County as the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury metropolitan statistical area.[3] The United States Census Bureau ranked the metropolitan area as the 59th most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States in 2019. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has further designated the metropolitan statistical area as a component of the more extensive New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA combined statistical area,[3] the most populous combined statistical area and primary statistical area of the United States.[4]\n\nAs is the case with all eight of Connecticut's counties, there is no county government and no county seat. As an area, it is only a geographical point of reference. In Connecticut, the cities and towns are responsible for all local governmental activities including fire and rescue, schools, and snow removal; in a few cases, neighboring towns will share certain resources.\n\nFairfield County's Gold Coast helped rank it sixth in the U.S. in per-capita personal income by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in 2005,[5] contributing substantially to Connecticut being one of the most affluent states in the U.S.[6] Other communities are more densely populated and economically diverse than the affluent areas for which the county is better known.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFairfield County was the home of many Native American tribes prior to the coming of the Europeans. People of the Schaghticoke tribe lived in the area of present-day New Fairfield and Sherman.[7] From east to west the Wappinger sachemships included the Paugussetts, Tankiteke, and the Siwanoy. There were also Paquioque and Potatuck inhabitants of Fairfield County.\n\nThe Dutch explorer Adriaen Block explored coastal Connecticut in the Spring and early Summer of 1614 in the North America-built vessel Onrust. The first European settlers of the county, however, were Puritans and Congregationalists from England. Roger Ludlow (1590–1664), one of the founders of the Colony of Connecticut, helped to purchase and charter the towns of Fairfield (1639) and Norwalk (purchased 1640, chartered as a town in 1651).[8] Ludlow is credited as having chosen the name Fairfield. Fairfield is a descriptive name referring to the beauty of its fields.[9] The town of Stratford was settled in 1639 as well by Adam Blakeman (1596–1665). William Beardsley (1605–1661) was also one of the first settlers of Stratford in 1639.\n\nFairfield County was established by an act of the Connecticut General Court in Hartford along with Hartford County, New Haven County, and New London County; which were the first four Connecticut counties, on May 10, 1666. From transcriptions of the Connecticut Colonial Records for that day:\n\nThis Court orders that from the east bounds of Stratford\n\nto ye bounds of Rye shalbe for future one County wch\n\nshalbe called the County of Fairfield. And it is ordered\n\nthat the County Court shalbe held at Fairfield on the second\n\nTuesday in March and the first Tuesday of November\n\nyearely. (sic)[10]\n\nThe original Fairfield County consisted of the towns of Rye, Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Fairfield, and Stratford. In 1673, the town of Woodbury was incorporated and added to Fairfield County. In 1683, New York and Connecticut reached a final agreement regarding their common border. This resulted in the cession of the town of Rye and all claims to the Oblong to New York. From the late 17th to early 18th centuries, several new towns were incorporated in western Connecticut and added to Fairfield County, namely Danbury (1687), Ridgefield (1709), Newtown (1711), and New Fairfield (1740). In 1751, Litchfield County was constituted, taking over the town of Woodbury. The final boundary adjustment to Fairfield County occurred in 1788 when the town of Brookfield was incorporated from parts of Newtown, Danbury, and New Milford, with Fairfield County gaining territory from Litchfield County.\n\nOther early county inhabitants include:\n\nJoseph Hawley (born 1603 in England; died 1690), who had emigrated to America in 1629 and then settled in Stratford in 1650, later becoming Stratford's first town clerk. Joseph Hawley's son Ephraim built the Ephraim Hawley House in 1683 in Trumbull that is still standing and serves as a private residence.\n\nThomas Fitch (c. 1700–1774), from Norwalk, was a governor of the Colony of Connecticut.\n\nGold Selleck Silliman (1732–1790) of the town of Fairfield fought for the Americans during the American Revolutionary War and rose to the rank of Brigadier General by 1776. He fought in the New York campaign that year.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Connecticut's prodigious agricultural output led to it being known informally as \"the Provisions State\".[11] In the spring of 1777, the British Commander-in-Chief, North America General William Howe, in New York City, ordered William Tryon to interrupt the flow of supplies from Connecticut that were reaching the Continental Army. Tryon and Henry Duncan led a fleet of 26 ships carrying 2,000 men to Westport's Compo Beach to raid Continental Army supply depots in Danbury on April 22, 1777. American Major General David Wooster (1710–1777), who was born in Stratford, was in charge of the stores at Danbury and defended them with a force of only 700 troops. Sybil Ludington helped rally New York militia to aid in the defense of Danbury. The New York militia included Sybil's father Colonel Henry Ludington. Though they arrived too late to save Danbury from burning, the elder Ludington and the New York militia helped support the Danbury troops and ensuing engagement of the British known as the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. Wooster was wounded at Ridgefield and died five days later in Danbury.\n\nTwo years later during a British raid on Greenwich on February 26, 1779 General Israel Putnam, who had stayed at Knapp's Tavern the previous night, rode away on his horse to warn the people of Stamford. Putnam was shot at by the British raiders but was able to escape. The hat he was wearing with a musket ball hole in it is on display at Knapp's Tavern in Greenwich (which is commonly, albeit somewhat erroneously, called Putnam's cottage).[12] In the summer of 1779, General William Tryon sought to punish Americans by attacking civilian targets in coastal Connecticut with a force of about 2,600 British troops. New Haven was raided on July 5, Fairfield was raided on the 7th and burned. Norwalk was raided on July 10 and burned on the 11th. Norwalk militia leader Captain Stephen Betts put up resistance to the invaders, but was overwhelmed by the powerful British raiders and was forced to retreat.\n\nDavid Sherman Boardman (1786–1864) was a prominent early lawyer and judge in this and neighboring Litchfield County.\n\nOn October 7, 1801, Neheemiah Dodge and other members of the Danbury Baptist Association wrote a letter to then-president Thomas Jefferson expressing their concern that as Baptists they may not be able to express full religious liberty in the state of Connecticut whose \"ancient charter\" was adopted before the establishment of a Baptist church in the state. Jefferson replied in a letter to Dodge and the other members of the Danbury church on January 1, 1802, in which he stated that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provided \"a wall of separation between church and State\" that protected them.[13]\n\nAlthough it is often viewed as an extension of metro-New York City, Fairfield County has had much industry in its own right. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., a milling machine manufacturer, was founded in Bridgeport in 1938. From the early to mid-20th century Bridgeport was in the top 50 largest cities by population. Stamford, Connecticut is an example of edge city urbanization, with many large and important companies having offices there and benefiting from proximity to New York.\n\nAt the height of its influence in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had a distinct presence in the county and county politics. The group was most active in Darien.[14] The Klan has since disappeared from the county.\n\nFairfield County, along with all other Connecticut counties, was abolished as a governmental agency in accord with state legislation that took effect October 1, 1960.[15]\n\nGeography[]\n\nLand[]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 837 square miles (2,170 km2), of which 625 square miles (1,620 km2) is land and 212 square miles (550 km2) (25.3%) is water.[16]\n\nThe terrain of the county trends from flat near the coast to hilly and higher near its northern extremity. The highest elevation is 1,290 feet (393 m) above sea level along the New York state line south of Branch Hill in the Town of Sherman; the lowest point is sea level itself.\n\nThe Taconic Mountains and the Berkshire Mountains ranges of the Appalachian Mountains run through Fairfield County. The Taconics begin roughly in Ridgefield and the Berkshires begin roughly in Northern Trumbull, both running north to Litchfield County and beyond. A portion of the Taconics also is in rural Greenwich and rural North Stamford in Fairfield County and run north into Westchester County, New York, eventually re-entering Fairfield County in Ridgefield. A small portion of the Appalachian Trail runs through Fairfield County; the trail enters Connecticut in the northernmost and least populous town in the county, Sherman, and moves east into Litchfield County, which encompasses the majority of the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut.\n\nThe section of the Taconic Mountains range that runs through Greenwich and North Stamford of Fairfield County is also the part of the Appalachians that is closest to the coast out of the entire Appalachian Mountains.\n\nWater[]\n\nThe agreed 1684 territorial limits of the county are defined as 20 miles (32 km) east of New York's Hudson River, which extends into Long Island Sound with a southerly limit of half way to Long Island, New York. The eastern limit is mostly a natural border defined as the halfway point of the Housatonic River with New Haven County with the exception of several islands belonging wholly to Stratford. The depth of the Sound varies between 60 and 120 feet (37 m).\n\nThe county is home to the Byram River, Housatonic River, Mianus River, Mill River, Norwalk River, Pequonnock River, Rippowam River, Saugatuck River, and the Still River.\n\nPollution[]\n\nThe Still River is polluted with mercury nitrate from the hat industry in Danbury, which has flowed into the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound.[17][18]\n\nThe Housatonic River is polluted with Monsanto chemicals called Aroclor, polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. From circa 1932 until 1977, the river received PCBs pollution discharges from the General Electric plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts.[19]\n\nTemplate:Rivers of Connecticut\n\nMountains and summits[]\n\nRefer to List of Mountains and Summits in Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nLitchfield County (north)\n\nNew Haven County (east)\n\nWestchester County, New York (southwest)\n\nPutnam County, New York (west)\n\nDutchess County, New York (northwest)\n\nNational protected areas[]\n\nStewart B.

Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 16.9% of the population.[27] In terms of ancestry, 18.1% were Italian, 15.9% were Irish, 9.8% were German, 8.7% were English, 5.5% were Polish, and 2.7% were American.[29]\n\nOf the 335,545 households, 36.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.1% were married couples living together, 12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 30.6% were non-families, and 24.9% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.21. The median age was 39.5 years.[27]\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $81,268 and the median income for a family was $100,593. Males had a median income of $70,187 versus $50,038 for females. The per capita income for the county was $48,295. About 5.6% of families and 8.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.4% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.[30]\n\nDemographic breakdown by town[]\n\nIncome[]\n\nSee also: List of Connecticut locations by per capita income\n\nData is from the 2010 United States Census and the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.[31][32]\n\nTown Per capita\n\nincome Median\n\nhousehold\n\nincome Median\n\nfamily\n\nincome Population Number of\n\nhouseholds Bethel Town $36,608 $83,483 $99,568 18,584 6,938 Bridgeport City $19,854 $41,047 $47,894 144,229 51,255 Brookfield Town $58,715 $119,370 $136,682 17,550 6,427 Danbury City $31,461 $65,275 $74,420 80,893 28,907 Darien Town $95,577 $175,766 $211,313 20,732 6,698 Easton Town $63,405 $140,370 $163,194 7,490 2,577 Fairfield Town $55,733 $113,248 $138,067 59,404 20,457 Greenwich Town $92,759 $124,958 $167,825 61,171 23,076 Monroe Town $43,842 $109,727 $119,357 19,479 6,735 New Canaan Town $100,824 $179,338 $220,278 19,738 7,010 New Fairfield Town $39,486 $101,067 $108,720 13,881 4,802 Newtown Town $45,308 $108,148 $120,507 27,560 9,459 Newtown Borough $43,916 $106,141 $109,821 1,941 696 Norwalk City $43,303 $76,161 $93,009 85,603 33,217 Redding Town $65,594 $130,557 $145,833 9,158 3,470 Ridgefield Town $72,026 $132,907 $166,036 24,638 8,801 Sherman Town $48,637 $115,417 $129,177 3,581 1,388 Shelton City $38,341 $80,656 $97,211 39,559 15,325 Stratford Town $32,590 $67,530 $83,369 51,384 20,095 Stamford City $44,667 $75,579 $88,050 122,643 47,357 Trumbull Town $44,006 $102,059 $117,855 36,018 12,725 Weston Town $92,735 $209,630 $242,361 10,179 3,379 Westport Town $90,792 $150,771 $182,659 26,391 9,573 Wilton Town $78,234 $153,770 $181,763 18,062 6,172\n\nRace[]\n\nData is from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates, \"Race alone or in combination with one or more other races.\"[33]\n\nRank Town Population White Black Asian American\n\nIndian Other Hispanic 1 Bridgeport City 143,412 49.8% 35.9% 3.9% 0.6% 11.8% 36.7% 2 Stamford City 121,784 61.0% 15.5% 8.7% 0.3% 16.3% 24.4% 3 Norwalk City 85,145 77.2% 14.0% 4.3% 0.6% 6.0% 20.2% 4 Danbury City 80,101 74.2% 8.7% 6.5% 1.2% 13.0% 25.1% 5 Greenwich Town 61,023 87.1% 2.3% 7.6% 0.2% 3.9% 9.0% 6 Fairfield Town 59,078 92.9% 1.8% 5.0% 0.2% 1.4% 4.4% 7 Stratford Town 51,116 79.5% 14.2% 3.7% 0.5% 4.1% 15.3% 8 Shelton City 39,310 92.6% 2.0% 2.5% 0.3% 3.1% 7.1% 9 Trumbull Town 35,752 91.9% 2.4% 5.4% 0.2% 1.5% 6.0% 10 Newtown Town 27,235 92.7% 2.0% 3.4% 0.5% 3.0% 6.0% 11 Westport Town 26,249 93.3% 1.4% 5.4% 0.1% 1.5% 3.6% 12 Ridgefield Town 24,469 96.0% 1.0% 3.2% 0.3% 0.7% 3.2% 13 Darien Town 20,580 95.2% 0.8% 3.8% 0.1% 1.3% 3.7% 14 New Canaan Town 19,642 96.4% 1.0% 2.5% 0.3% 0.8% 1.8% 15 Monroe Town 19,398 96.9% 0.2% 2.4% 0.1% 0.7% 4.5% 16 Bethel Town 18,584 90.5% 2.5% 5.1% 0.4% 3.5% 7.6% 17 Wilton Town 17,973 93.2% 1.2% 5.7% 0.0% 1.0% 2.8% 18 Brookfield Town 16,339 92.0% 1.6% 6.1% 0.4% 0.9% 4.4% 19 New Fairfield Town 13,847 95.3% 0.6% 0.9% 0.6% 3.6% 6.5% 20 Weston Town 10,142 96.1% 1.7% 3.0% 0.6% 0.8% 2.9% 21 Redding Town 9,058 95.7% 1.8% 2.8% 2.1% 0.3% 2.6% 22 Easton Town 7,452 96.7% 1.3% 2.5% 0.0% 0.0% 2.2% 23 Sherman Town 3,598 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.6% 24 Newtown Borough 2,035 97.7% 0.8% 2.0% 0.9% 0.5% 2.7%\n\nEconomy[]\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, corporations began moving their headquarters to Fairfield County from Manhattan; Thomas J. Lueck of The New York Times said that the trend \"permanently decentralized big business in the New York region.\" During the 1980s many buyouts and reorganizations and an economic recession lead to companies vacating much of the suburban office space in Fairfield County. In 1992 Fairfield County had the headquarters of over 25 major multinational corporations, giving it the third largest concentration of those companies in the United States after New York City and Chicago.[34]\n\nRecently, Fairfield County has been described as a \"hedge fund ghetto\" due to the large concentration of investment management firms in the area, most notably Bridgewater Associates (one of the world's largest hedge fund companies), Aladdin Capital Management, and Point72 Asset Management.\n\nGovernment and municipal services[]\n\nAs of 1960, counties in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. Thus Fairfield County is only a geographical point of reference. All municipal services are provided by the towns, who sometimes will share certain resources through regionalization. In order to address issues concerning more than one town, several regional agencies that help coordinate the towns for infrastructure, land use, and economic development concerns have been established. Within the geographical area of Fairfield County, the regional agencies are:\n\nGreater Bridgeport\n\nSouth Western\n\nThe Valley (partly in New Haven County)\n\nHousatonic Valley (partly in Litchfield County)\n\nCounty municipal buildings[]\n\nSeveral former county municipal buildings are used by other state or local agencies, including:\n\nThe Fairfield County Jail in Bridgeport on the corner of North Avenue and Madison Avenue, still actively used to house prisoners.\n\nThe Fairfield County Court Houses in Bridgeport and Danbury which served the county's judicial needs and housed county deputy sheriff's until December 2000. The court houses are still marked \"Fairfield County Court House\".\n\nLaw enforcement[]\n\nLaw enforcement within the geographic area of the county is provided by the respective town police departments, whereas in other states in the region such as New York and Vermont law enforcement would be provided by the local county sheriff's department. In the less dense areas, such as Sherman, law enforcement is primarily provided by the Connecticut State Police. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff's Department existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, court security, Bailiff, and county and state executions. These responsibilities have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System.\n\nSome municipalities in the county still maintain a sheriff's department to fill the void of the abolishment of the county sheriff's department, such as the City of Shelton which has established the Shelton Sheriff's Department to carry out warrants in the city.\n\nJudicial[]\n\nThe geographic area of the county is served by the three separate judicial districts: Danbury, Stamford-Norwalk, and Fairfield. Each judicial district has a superior court located, respectively, in Danbury, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Each judicial district has one or more geographical area courts (\"GA\"'s), subdivisions of the judicial districts that handle lesser cases such as criminal misdemeanors, small claims, traffic violations, and other civil actions.\n\nFire protection[]\n\nFire protection in the county is provided by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services to a section of the town.\n\nEducation[]\n\nEducation in the county is usually provided by the town governments. The exceptions are the towns of Redding and Easton, which joined to form a regional school district (Region 9).\n\nCrime rate[]\n\nFairfield County has a low crime index of 2050.2 (per 100,000 citizens) as well as a murder closure rate of over 70%.[35] Several Governmental agencies, as well as private security contractors, have made note of Fairfield's low crime rates and the county currently has 6 cities and towns with a percentile safety index of 90% or higher compared to the rest of the continental United States (based on violent and property crimes).[36]\n\nPolitics[]\n\nAs with neighboring Westchester County, Fairfield County was generally a Republican stronghold for much of the 20th century. Urban municipalities such as Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport trended Democratic, while the suburban and rural enclaves tended to lean Republican. However, during the 1990s, the latter areas began to increasingly shift towards Democratic candidates. Today, only Hartford County has a higher concentration of Democratic voters. The last time the county voted for a Republican presidential candidate was in 1992 for George H.W Bush.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Fairfield County, Connecticut[37] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 169,039 35.74% 297,505 62.90% 6,446 1.36% 2016 160,077 38.00% 243,852 57.89% 17,280 4.10% 2012 175,168 44.22% 217,294 54.85% 3,668 0.93% 2008 167,736 40.54% 242,936 58.72% 3,069 0.74% 2004 189,605 47.29% 205,902 51.35% 5,460 1.36% 2000 159,659 43.12% 193,769 52.33% 16,861 4.55% 1996 144,632 41.06% 172,337 48.93% 35,258 10.01% 1992 175,158 42.78% 160,202 39.13% 74,050 18.09% 1988 221,316 59.04% 149,630 39.91% 3,932 1.05% 1984 257,319 65.78% 132,253 33.81% 1,607 0.41% 1980 201,997 54.88% 124,074 33.71% 42,027 11.42% 1976 209,458 58.15% 148,353 41.18% 2,413 0.67% 1972 233,188 64.00% 125,128 34.34% 6,050 1.66% 1968 173,108 51.78% 139,364 41.69% 21,820 6.53% 1964 125,576 39.17% 194,782 60.75% 261 0.08% 1960 167,778 53.39% 146,442 46.60% 6 0.00% 1956 199,841 70.19% 84,890 29.81% 0 0.00% 1952 167,278 60.72% 106,403 38.62% 1,812 0.66% 1948 118,636 54.65% 90,767 41.81% 7,669 3.53% 1944 103,693 50.51% 99,181 48.31% 2,423 1.18% 1940 91,190 49.10% 93,688 50.45% 829 0.45% 1936 67,846 41.56% 87,329 53.49% 8,088 4.95% 1932 72,238 49.92% 64,367 44.48% 8,092 5.59% 1928 71,410 55.81% 55,491 43.37% 1,047 0.82% 1924 58,041 66.22% 18,815 21.47% 10,788 12.31% 1920 55,251 66.48% 24,761 29.79% 3,101 3.73% 1916 25,962 53.78% 20,873 43.24% 1,442 2.99% 1912 13,147 31.53% 15,663 37.56% 12,893 30.92% 1908 24,064 58.99% 14,917 36.57% 1,812 4.44% 1904 23,490 58.22% 15,796 39.15% 1,063 2.63% 1900 21,317 57.10% 15,455 41.40% 560 1.50% 1896 24,489 67.91% 9,726 26.97% 1,848 5.12% 1892 16,190 48.37% 16,125 48.18% 1,156 3.45% 1888 15,549 49.55% 14,984 47.75% 848 2.70% 1884 13,694 48.26% 13,964 49.21% 718 2.53%\n\nHospitals[]\n\nBridgeport Hospital\n\nDanbury Hospital\n\nGreenwich Hospital\n\nNorwalk Hospital\n\nSt. Vincent's Medical Center (Bridgeport) in Bridgeport\n\nStamford Hospital\n\nTransportation[]\n\nMass transit[]\n\nWith Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway increasingly clogged with traffic, state officials are looking toward mass transit to ease the county's major thoroughfares' traffic burden.\n\nNew office buildings are being concentrated near railroad stations in Stamford, Bridgeport and other municipalities in the county to allow for more rail commuting. Proximity to Stamford's Metro-North train station was cited by the Royal Bank of Scotland as a key reason for locating its new U.S. headquarters building in downtown Stamford; construction on the office tower started in late 2006.\n\nAir[]\n\nWithin Fairfield County there are two regional airports: Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford and the Danbury Municipal Airport in Danbury. The county is also served by larger airports such as Bradley International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Tweed New Haven Regional Airport, and Westchester County Airport.\n\nBus service[]\n\nConnecticut Transit's Stamford division runs local and inter-city buses to the southern part of the county.[38] The Norwalk Transit District serves the Norwalk area in the southern central portion of the county; the Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority serves Bridgeport and eastern Fairfield County; and the Housatonic Area Regional Transit agency serves Danbury and the northern portions of the county.\n\nFerry service[]\n\nThe Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry carries passengers and cars from Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, New York across Long Island Sound.\n\nFerry lines in and out of Stamford are also in development.\n\nRail[]\n\nCommuter Rail is perhaps Fairfield County's most important transportation artery, as it allows its residents an efficient ride to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Service is provided on Metro-North's New Haven Line, and every town on the shoreline has at least one station. Connecting lines bring service to New Canaan from Stamford on the New Canaan Branch, and to Danbury from South Norwalk on the Danbury Branch. Many trains run express from New York to Stamford, making it an easy 45-minute ride.\n\nIn the 2005 and 2006 sessions of the Legislature, massive appropriations were made to buy replacements for the 343 rail cars for the Metro-North New Haven Line and branch lines. The approximately 30-year-old cars will be replaced with new cars at a rate of ten per month starting in 2010.[39]\n\nBridgeport and Stamford are also served by Amtrak, and both cities see a significant number of boardings on the \"Regional Northeast Route\" (Boston to Newport News, VA). This route also serves other Amtrak stations in Connecticut, including New Haven, Old Saybrook, New London, and Mystic.\n\nMajor roads[]\n\nBoston Post Road[]\n\nU.S. 1 is the oldest east–west route in the county, running through all of its shoreline cities and towns. Known by various names along its length, most commonly \"Boston Post Road\" or simply \"Post Road\", it gradually gains latitude from west to east. Thus U.S. 1 west is officially designated \"South\" and east is \"North\".\n\nThough contiguous, U.S.1 changes name by locality. In Greenwich it is Putnam Avenue. In Stamford it becomes Main Street or Tresser Boulevard. In Darien it is Boston Post Road or \"the Post Road\". In Norwalk it is Connecticut Avenue in the west, Van Zant St, Cross St, and North Av in the center, and Westport Avenue in the east. In Westport, it is Post Road West from the Norwalk town line until the Saugatuck River and then it becomes Post Road East until Fairfield. In Fairfield it is again Boston Post Road or \"the Post Road\". In Bridgeport it follows Kings Highway in the west, North Avenue in the center, and Boston Avenue in the east. Finally, it becomes Barnum Avenue in Stratford.\n\nInterstate 95[]\n\nThe western portions of Interstate 95 in Connecticut are known as the Connecticut Turnpike or the Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike in Fairfield County and it crosses the state approximately parallel to U.S. Route 1. The road is most commonly referred to as \"I-95\". The highway is six lanes (sometimes eight lanes) throughout the county. It was completed in 1958 and is often clogged with traffic particularly during morning and evening rush hours.\n\nWith the cost of land so high along the Gold Coast, state lawmakers say they don't consider widening the highway to be fiscally feasible, although occasional stretches between entrances and nearby exits are now sometimes connected with a fourth \"operational improvement\" lane (for instance, westbound between the Exit 10 interchange in Darien and Exit 8 in Stamford). Expect similar added lanes in Darien and elsewhere in the Fairfield County portion of the highway in the future, lawmakers and state Department of Transportation officials say.\n\nMerritt Parkway[]\n\nThe Merritt Parkway, also known as \"The Merritt\" or Connecticut Route 15, is a truck-free scenic parkway that runs through the county parallel and generally several miles north of Interstate 95. It begins at the New York state line where it is the Hutchinson River Parkway and terminates on the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge where it becomes the Wilbur Cross Parkway at the New Haven county line.\n\nThe interchange between the Merritt Parkway and Route 7 in Norwalk was completed around the year 2000. The project was held up in a lawsuit won by preservationists concerned about the historic Merritt Parkway bridges. It is now exit 39 off the Merritt, and exit 15 off I-95. The parkway is a National Scenic Byway and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[40]\n\nInterstate 84[]\n\nInterstate 84, which runs through Danbury, is scheduled to be widened to a six-lane highway at all points between Danbury and Waterbury. State officials say they hope the widening will not only benefit drivers regularly on the route but also entice some cars from the more crowded Interstate 95, which is roughly parallel to it. Heavier trucks are unlikely to use Interstate 84 more often, however, because the route is much hillier than I-95 according to a state Department of Transportation official.\n\nU.S. Route 7[]\n\nWith its southern terminus at Interstate 95 in central Norwalk, U.S. Route 7 heads north through Wilton, Ridgefield, and Danbury to points north. In Danbury and almost all of Norwalk, the route is a highway (known as \"Super 7\" in the Danbury area or \"The Connector\" in Norwalk) but it becomes a four-lane road just south of the Wilton-Norwalk border and up to Danbury. There is significant opposition to making the route a limited access highway for the entire length by residents of Wilton and Ridgefield. As a compromise between freeway supporters and opponents, the Connecticut Department of Transportation is upgrading the existing 2-lane section to 4 lanes, with a median in some locations. The state has also bypassed the original 2-lane Route 7 around Brookfield with a freeway, where town officials have long supported an expressway to divert traffic away from the town center.\n\nConnecticut Route 8[]\n\nRoute 8 terminates in downtown Bridgeport from I-95 with Connecticut Route 25 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 25 at the Bridgeport—Trumbull town line and continues north into southeastern Trumbull and Shelton, then beyond the county through some of towns of the Naugatuck River Valley to Waterbury and beyond. Construction of the route provided some impetus for the creation of office parks in Shelton and home construction there and in other parts of The Valley.\n\nConnecticut Route 25[]\n\nRoute 25 starts in downtown Bridgeport from I 95 with Route 8 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 8 at the Bridgeport—Trumbull town line and continues into Trumbull.
