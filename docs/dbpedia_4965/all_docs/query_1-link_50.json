To provide relevant programming, along with great music, we encouraged artists to share their thoughts about current issues such as the Covid19 pandemic, staying creative and connected during the shutdown of music venues, and the raw tensions and inequities of racism and the struggle for social justice. The MMD-Bpt was designed to offer insight, hope, a musical respite and shared musical experiences and thoughts from artists of diverse backgrounds with different points of view. Among the musicians to be featured are Caravan of Thieves, Mystic Bowie, Colorfields, Deep Banana Black Out, the Cosmic Jibarros, Hitch and the Giddy-Up, the Tom Tom Club and the Zambonisand Thomas Hooker School Rising Stars Productions.
