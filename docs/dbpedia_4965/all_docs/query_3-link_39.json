        "text": "The talk will summarize the archaeoastronomy of three sites of the ancient world: Nabta Playa in southern Egypt, the earliest known example of megalithic astronomy in the world, Chaco Canyon and its Great House communities in Colorado and New Mexico, and Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley of Peru. Nabta Playa is in the western desert of Egypt, west of Abu Simbu and was occupied from about 10,000 year BEC to perhaps 2500 BEC when the desert became hyper-arid. Beginning around 5000 BCE, a ceremonial center was built on the western edge of an internally drained lake, providing the nomadic pastoralists water and forage for their herds. They constructed a stone circle, which marks north-south and June solstice sunrise/December solstice sunset. Their most fascinating activity was to place series of megaliths in the sediments of the lake, which are oriented to Arcturus, Sirius, and Î± Centauri. Chaco Canyon in New Mexico appears to have been a major pilgrimage center during the period 1000-1100 CE. The first major astronomical event was the December solstice sun rising above Fajada Butte, as seen from a nearby Great Kiva. Other astronomy involves possible petroglyphs of the 1054 supernova, the 1066 apparition of Halleyâs comet, and a total eclipse of 1097. Great Houses were located to provide views of the sun and moon rising above dramatic features on the horizon, such as the moon at major lunar standstill at Chimney Rock. Machu Picchu is the crown jewel of the Inca empire, encapsulating much of the power and mystery of the astronomy of the empire. The Inca emperor was viewed as the descendent of the sun, and massive ceremonies were established at Cusco and elsewhere to confirm and enhance his status. Evidence of those celebrations are abundant in the archaeological record..

(the Astronomical Leagueâs companion observing program). You can be an important partner in the OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission and contribute observations to benefit future generations! Dolores will show the innovative method that will be used to obtain a sample from asteroid Bennu without actually landing on the asteroid itself and explain why return of a pristine, protected sample is important. The robotic OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral in September 2016. Upcoming Earth Gravity Assist will take place this September to propel the spacecraft out to asteroid rendezvous in 2018 and sample return to Earth in 2023. Already the mission has made important discoveries about Bennu and the orbital evolution of small asteroids. The samples will reveal new information about the oldest solids and organic material in the Solar System. Earth-based astronomical observations, images, spectra and a variety of maps will significantly advance our understanding of asteroid-meteorite connections, providing direct âground truthâ comparisons. This long-term mission serves as a pathfinder for future asteroid missions and provides opportunities for amateur astronomers and public outreach. Target Asteroids! and Target NEOs! enlist amateur astronomers to observe a particular list of asteroids of interest to the OSIRIS-REx science team and future spacecraft designers. While there are much astronomical data available for Bennu, the carbonaceous target of the OSIRIS-REx mission, additional observations of other asteroids allow scientists to learn more about the entire asteroid population and place Bennu in context. Because some of these asteroids will be targets of future spacecraft missions as well, the data submitted will be useful for a long time. OSIRIS-REx Ambassadors share information about the mission with their local clubs and communities. We invite you to join the team! *OSIRIS-REx is an acronym: Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource, Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer\n\nJunoâs principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars. With its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. Juno will let us take a giant step forward in our understanding of how giant planets form and the role these titans played in putting together the rest of the solar system. NASAâs JUNO mission was launched in August 2011 and starts orbiting over Jupiterâs poles on July 14, 2016. JUNO carries instruments that will probe Jupiterâs deep interior and measure the amount of water â a key component of solar system evolution. JUNO is the first spacecraft to fly over Jupiterâs aurora and will measure both the energetic particles raining down on the planet and the bright ânorthern & southern lightsâ they excite.\n\nâSpace weather is driven by the interactions between the solar wind and Earthâs magnetic field, and one of the most important of these interactions is âmagnetic reconnection,â a fundamental process that occurs when magnetic fields interact with plasmas,â said Rice University physicist Patricia Reiff, co-author of a new paper about MMS results thatâs available online this week from the journal Science. For Reiff and her MMS colleagues, including mission principal investigator and Rice alumnus James Burch, vice president of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, this weekâs results are the culmination of a process that began with the initial idea for MMS more than 25 years ago. Reiff said MMS, a collection of four identical spacecraft that orbit in a pyramid-shaped formation about 6 miles wide, is specifically designed to study region of space tens of thousands of miles above Earthâs surface that is a prime location for magnetic reconnection. This region, known as the âmagnetopause,â is where the solar wind â a plasma of positive ions and negative electrons that stream continuously outward from the sun â comes in contact with Earthâs magnetosphere, the region of space dominated by Earthâs magnetic field. âMagnetic reconnection is a fundamental process thatâs responsible for the aurora borealis and australis and space storms here on Earth, as well as for solar flares on our own sun and analogous stellar flares elsewhere in the universe,â said Reiff, a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice who began studying Earthâs magnetosphere more than 45 years ago with instruments left on the moon by Apollo astronauts. âWhen two magnets come together, reconnection is the process whereby the magnetic field rearranges itself to link the north pole of one magnet with the south pole of the other,â she said. Reconnection occurs when the two magnets are not exactly co-aligned. If reconnection occurs in a vacuum or an electrically non-conducting medium like Earthâs lower atmosphere, the process occurs at the speed of light and has no effect on the surrounding medium. But each medium of space measured by MMS â the solar wind and the magnetosphere â contain a fully ionized plasma that is an excellent electrical conductor. The plasmaâs negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions orbit in opposite directions about a given magnetic field line.

(Photo courtesy of NASA KSC) âWhen the field lines of two different magnetic fields meet in space â as they do at the magnetopause â and try to reconnect, these gyrating particles initially resist,â Reiff said. âEach field line tends to retain its own distinct set of orbiting charged particles. Reconnection occurs when the field lines draw nearer one another than the distance of the ions or electrons orbiting them, and when it occurs, the energy released by the merger is transferred to the particles, which accelerate rapidly, sometimes at nearly light speed.â This critical distance, known as the diffusion region, is considerably larger for ions than it is for electrons, and MMS is the first spacecraft designed to probe the much smaller âelectron diffusion regionâ where the electrons become decoupled and reconnection actually occurs. The MMS plasma instruments are much faster than any previously deployed to measure the magnetosphere, and are thus designed to catch reconnection âin the actâ on its most microscopic scale. - See more at: http://news.rice.edu/2016/05/12/nasa-probe-results-could-improve-space-weather-forecasts-2/#sthash.FXN5jNS5.dpuf\n\nIn 1919, astronomers performed an experiment during a solar eclipse, attempting to measure the deflection of stars near the sun, in order to verify Einsteinâs theory of general relativity. The experiment was very difficult and the results were marginal, but the success made Albert Einstein famous around the world. Astronomers last repeated the experiment in 1973, achieving an error of 11%. On August 21, 2017, using amateur equipment and modern technology, I plan to repeat the experiment and achieve a 1% error. The best available star catalog will be used for star positions. Corrections for optical distortion and atmospheric refraction are better than 0.01 arcsec. During totality, I expect 7 or 8 measurable stars down to magnitude 9.5, based on analysis of previous eclipse measurements taken by amateurs. Reference images, taken near the sun during totality, will be used for precise calibration. Preliminary test runs performed during twilight in April 2017 accurately simulated the sky conÂ­ditions during totality, providing an accurate estimate of the final uncertainty.\n\nDr Kate Russo has been engaging in researching the eclipse experience and eclipse planning for several years, starting with her surveys and interviews with eclipse chasers for her first book Total Addiction: The Life of an Eclipse Chaser. She has since surveyed and interviewed hundreds of people about their eclipse experiences. She undertook detailed research before and after the 2012 total eclipse in her home region of Far North Queensland. More recently, she undertook a post-eclipse research workshop at the Eclipse Festival in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Along with trying to put words to the indescribable experience of totality, her research also has real world applications â she undertook detailed post-eclipse interviews with eclipse coordinators in 2012 and 2015 to produce her White Paper on Community Eclipse Planning, which is being used by many communities along the path of totality for the 2017 eclipse. Kate is a Clinical Psychologist by profession, and is an expert in Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. She has taken time out of her psychology career for the foreseeable future to focus on her eclipse research, planning, events and media. She is planning to relocate to the US in 2017 to do a high profile outreach tour along the path of totality.\n\nThe total eclipse of 2017 is the first one visible from the contiguous United States in 38 years. It offers millions of Americans the opportunity to bask in the light of the solar corona for two minutes. The overwhelming majority of 2017 eclipse observers are \"totality virgins\", having never experienced a total eclipse before. Just what is it like to stand in the Moon's shadow and watch daylight diminish to an eerie twilight? And what does the corona really look like? Has the total eclipse been completely over-hyped by the media or is it something even more? There are few events in life that leave a permanent, indelible impression. A total eclipse of the Sun is just such an event. The simple act of recollection can quicken the pulse as vivid memories flood oneâs mind. It all begins with such little fanfare â a tiny notch along one edge of the Sun. An hour passes as the Moon slowly creeps across the Sunâs disk. In the final minutes, daylight grows feeble. A dark curtain rises in the west as the Moonâs shadow races towards you at speeds exceeding a thousand miles per hour. Suddenly, the darkness sweeps over you as the Sunâs light flickers out and totality begins. I will share some eclipse accounts of my own as well as those of others, illustrated with images and video captured around the world with the hope of preparing you for your own experience with totality on August 21.\n\nThe recent completion of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the upgrade to the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, development of adaptive optics on 8 to 10 meter telescopes, and astronomy satellites such as Chandra, HST, Spitzer, Herschel, WISE, and Planck are revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe and documenting its stunning beauty. I will take the audience on a visual, multi-wavelength tour of the Orion region. I will start with the large-scale view of the entire Winter sky from visual to radio wavelengths where we see the expanding Orion-Eridanus superbubble created by Orionâs massive stars over the last 5 to 10 million years. I will then zoom into the cauldron of star formation activity inside and immediately behind the Orion Nebula and show the remarkable images produced by HST, ground-based adaptive optics, and the ALMA array. The new sub-arcsecond resolution data reveals the complex interplay between the violent birth of massive stars and the hundreds of lower-mass ones that may once host future planetary systems.\n\nOf all the known forces of Nature, gravity plays a singularly important role in the Cosmos --- it is the only force that matters on the mind-bogglingly large scale of the entire Universe. It drives the formation of star systems, it forces stars to ignite nuclear fires in their cores, it keeps galaxies bound together, and it tells the story of the beginning of the Cosmos as well as what it's ultimate fate might be. Our modern understanding of gravity is called General Relativity, described by Albert Einstein in 1915. One of the first major astronomical tests of general relativity was the observation of the total solar eclipse by Eddington on 29 May 1919. Since then, we have made remarkable discoveries that build on that early, first test of gravity. In this talk we'll revisit Eddington's observations and the role they played in cementing our understanding of gravity. We'll then leap forward a century, to the modern day, to talk about how a new kind of astronomy -- gravitational wave astronomy -- is transforming our understanding of the Cosmos, and the role that both professional and amateur astronomers are playing in opening our minds to the Gravitational Universe\n\nThe science of meteoritics has seen a renaissance in recent years, as new instrumentation and computational techniques have advanced our understanding. Meteors, from tiny particles observed only with radar, through bodies large enough to glow as they pass through the atmosphere, provide an important window into the debris in our solar system, from dust through asteroids. Much of what we know about the formation and evolution of the Solar System stems from the study of interplanetary dust. In cooperation with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Iâve been operating a network of allsky cameras across Colorado since 2001. Iâll discuss the wealth of information to be found in over 50,000 recorded meteors: fine structure in showers, evidence of new showers, details of the size distribution of bodies in the near-Earth environment, atmospheric dynamics, and much more. Weâll explore what this teaches us about the Solar System, and about potential risks to space-based assets as well as to those of us on the ground. Iâll describe the simple cameras you can build to collect your own data, and how by enlisting one or two friends you can set up your own mini-network that could let you track the next big meteor all the way to the ground, and figure out where meteorites might have landed.\n\nEclipse chasers have long known that whatever eclipse they have just observed, another will again occur with little variation 18 years and 11.32 days in the future. All they need to do is move approximately one third of the way around the world to the west and adjust their latitude by about 200 miles. The Saros series is the pulse of solar mechanics that has made eclipses predictable events even in ancient times. At any one time an average of 38 saros serirs are active, producing eclipses at their regular intervals. In this epoch saros series produce an average of 72 eclipses extending over a 1300 year period. Accordingly, some series are old, some middle aged and some young. Saros series 145 fits in the young classification of this remarkable rythmic order of nature, and on 2017 August 21 will produce only its eighth out a future total of 43 central eclipses. All but two of those being total. A variety of factors contribute to the determination to the type of eclipse a saros will predominately produce, and we are fortunate in that those factors for saros series 145 are most favorable for the production of total rather than annular events. While the series starts with eclipses of brief totality, celestial mechanics are slowly conspiring to bring about great things. By the 25th century celestical circumstances will produce 5 six minute plus and 3 seven minute plus eclipses in the series. While historically the first five totals preceding the series imminent return have had little impact on the history of astronomy, they each have etched unforgettable memories into the conscience of those who found themselves within its path. And while the future for 145 looks brighter than its past, each eclipse of each saros series has its own call to uniqueness."
