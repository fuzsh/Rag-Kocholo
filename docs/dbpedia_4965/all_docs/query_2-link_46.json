        "text": "It’s hard to believe: The Slice of Saugatuck is 12 years old.\n\nThis year’s street festival is set for Saturday, September 7 (2 to 5 p.m.).\n\nOver 4 dozen restaurants, shops and galleries — in the “slice” between Riverside Avenue, Railroad Place and Saugatuck Avenue — will offer samples and tastes.\n\nThe Slice features 7 bands, 4 bounce houses, the Fire Department’s antique engine, a balloon bender, face painter and more. Adults can enjoy 2 beer gardens, and specialty drinks from most restaurants.\n\nTicket sales ($15; children 5-12, $5; sold on-site, cash or credit card) benefit the Homes with Hope food pantry. To date, the Slice of Saugatuck has donated $49,000 to the non-profit.\n\nThe event is sponsored by the Westport Weston Chamber of Commerce.\n\nA small “slice” of the large crowd. (Photo/Dan Woog)\n\n================================================\n\nDo you know a great pediatrician, who is interested in joining a popular Westport practice?\n\nVillage Pediatrics is looking for one.\n\nThere’s a nationwide shortage of pediatricians. But Dr. Nikki Gorman’s group should be a good fit.\n\nInterested candidates — or anyone who knows any candidates — should email nikki.villagepedi@gmail.com.\n\nDoctors and office staff from Village Pediatrics volunteered at this year’s County Assembly dance. Dr. Nikki Gorman is bottom right.\n\n==================================================\n\nThough the war in Ukraine has faded from the front pages of American newspaper, it continues to rage fiercely.\n\nEvery day, there is more human suffering.\n\nYesterday’s New York Times included a story headlined “Long Battle for a Ruined City Takes a Desperate Turn.” It described the struggle for Toretsk, a city in eastern Ukraine under relentless attack by Russian forces.\n\nThe photos were taken by Tyler Hicks. The Times‘ Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer is a 1988 Staples High School graduate.\n\nClick here for the full story, and harrowing images. (Hat tip: Drew Angus)\n\nLyudmilla Petrovna, 74, in a church between Kostiantynivka and Pokrovsk that was damaged by Russian shelling last month. Ms. Petrovna was injured. (Photo/Tyler Hicks for the New York Times)\n\n====================================================\n\n“06880” reports regularly on the continuing saga of 233 Hillspoint Road. Our most recent photo was yesterday.\n\nLooks like just a few finishing touches remain …\n\n(Photo/Mary Sikorski)\n\n==================================================\n\nFentanyl is a real danger.\n\nRecently, a 1-year-old child overdosed on the drug at a Connecticut park. Last week, fentanyl-laced cannabis products were found for sale at a smoke shop in Norwalk.\n\nFentanyl is the primary driver behind the increase in overdose deaths over the last 10 years, and it can hide in plain sight.\n\nOn August 15 (6 to 7 p.m., 90 Post Road West), Positive Directions, The Center for Prevention & Counseling, offers a free workshop for college students from Norwalk and Westport to learn about risks and resources on campus, including how to save a life using Narcan.\n\nAttendees will receive a harm reduction kit, with Narcan, fentanyl test strips and more.

Each of their 4 wings can operate independently. Their muscles are attached to their wings. They can fly forward, backward and upside down. They can also hover and pivot in place.\n\n“They are very efficient predators. They can see nearly 360° with those large eyes. And they eat flies and mosquitoes! Who doesn’t love that?”\n\n(Photo/Lou Weinberg)\n\n================================================\n\nAnd finally … on this date in 1789, the US Department of War was created.\n\n(From Saugatuck to Ukraine, “06880” is where Westport meets the world. Please help us meet our funding goals. Just click here — and thank you!)\n\nOur long blue nightmare is over.\n\nThe sale of 233 Hillspoint Road — site of the former Café de la Plage and Positano restaurants, but since before COVID a half-finished, Tyvek-wrapped, litigation-snarled residential property, and an eyesore and headache for neighbors and passersby — closed earlier this month.\n\nWork has already begun to finish the home.\n\nWho bought it? Read on …\n\nWork resumed this month at 233 Hillspoint Road. (Photo/John McKinney)\n\nThe cat is out of the bag. My identity is public. I am the owner of 233 Hillspoint Road, and have been in contract since mid-July. My name is James Pendry.\n\nI have lived in Westport since the late 1980s. I sent my children to Staples High School.\n\nI was a member of Westport Rotary for years, and have lived in an antique home on the Mill Pond for over 2 decades.\n\nI have logged many hours sipping coffee outside Elvira’s, and many summer days reading at Old Mill Beach. I’d like to think I know the neighborhood.\n\nI know there have been many rumors, many fingers pointed, much outrage and vituperative attacks on everyone from the seller, Planning & Zoning Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals and Building Department.\n\nVirtually everything I’ve heard is the worst form of gossip: false and mean.\n\nFor years, 233 Hillspoint Road looked like this.\n\nUnfortunately, and I guess to disappoint many of you, there is no villain here. There is only a profound lack of communication, the lost years of COVID, and the ill-effects of “silo-ing.”\n\nAt each turn in this drama, every actor was doing the logical and right thing from their specific and singular point of view. Omniscience was required — someone or some authority to look at the big picture, and forge a workable compromise.\n\nThat entity does not exist in the land use departments of the town of Westport — or in the halls of Congress of the United States. The result is the same: missed opportunities, little productive debate, and either no outcome or a bad outcome.\n\nIn the last week we have cleaned up the site, moved the security fence so as not to impede pedestrian traffic, and replaced all the blue skin on the exterior of the building.\n\nThe neighbors, who had sued the previous owner, were gracious enough to meet with me and keep an open mind to some changes. Ultimately, we were able to reach a compromise that each of the plaintiffs and I can abide by.\n\nConstruction will start in earnest, as soon as the ZBA signs off on the compromise reached.\n\nI am hopeful that that can happen at their next meeting.\n\n(“06880” has followed the saga of 233 Hillspoint — and plenty of other real estate and beach news.

Catering options are available too.

Longshore Sailing School puts over 1,000 junior sailors and 250 adults on the water annually, with many coming by way of scholarship. Many adults also go on to become instructors at the school.\n\n“Much of her success is due to the culture she’s created. As all good leaders do, Pimentel has established a staff culture of continuous improvement, collaboration, and empowerment, understanding that accountability and compassion go hand in hand.” (Click here for more information.

The DWW will hang them up, for all to see.\n\nIt’s their “valentine to our town.”\n\n=================================================\n\nIn a town filled with fundraisers, it’s tough to stand out.\n\nThe Westport Woman’s Club has found a unique — and very fun — way: a “Death by Bathtub Gin” murder mystery dinner.\n\nOn Saturday, March 23 (6 p.m.), their Imperial Avenue clubhouse will be transformed into a Jazz Age speakeasy.\n\nA professional troupe of Broadway actors will guide 100 guests through a hunt for the “murderer.” It may well be one of them.\n\nThe night includes cocktails, hors d’oeuvres and a 3-course Italian dinner, as the “murder mystery” unfolds.\n\nFlapper dresses and tuxedos are welcome. A photo booth will have “jazzy” accessories for all. There’s a silent auction too.\n\nTickets are $150.

Click below to listen to the Y’s Men of Westport and Weston production.\n\n=================================================\n\nFor decades, 58 Saugatuck Avenue has been an object of intrigue.\n\nThe tiny brick storefront has housed, at various times, a barbershop, florist, catering kitchen and (perhaps) a pre-Prohibition liquor store.\n\nIt’s been vacant for years though, ever since the previous tenant — a pop-up art gallery — closed.\n\nRecently, it’s gotten a nice (and much-needed) makeover.\n\n(Photos/JD Dworkow)\n\nWhat’s going in?\n\nThe use of the building is up to the owner. Current zoning allows almost any retail use, from another catering kitchen or gallery to a law office, or an artist’s or interior designer’s studio.\n\nOne fairly big drawback: There is absolutely no parking.\n\nThe building has been on the market for months. It’s in a residentially zoned lot (with a 2-family home, also recently renovated) behind.\n\nA zoning permit was recently issued for the storefront, authorizing its continued (non-conforming) retail use.

As always, Garden Club members offer advice on purchases.\n\nOne more idea: If you haven’t finished your Mothers Day shopping (and don’t have a green thumb), you can choose from a collection of gift-ready planters.\n\nThe annual plant sale funds Westport Garden Club displays all over town.\n\n==================================================\n\nYesterday’s glossy New York Times special “Homes” advertising supplement was filled with national real estate listings.\n\nOne — on page 3 — was from Westport.\n\nIt showed the controversial $7.9 million 233 Hillspoint Road home — described, of course, in breathless real estate prose:\n\nThere’s just one thing. If a buyer decides that’s his or her house because of the very cool chimney at the south end: no deal.\n\nThat was part of the reason construction was halted for 2 years.

They wound up being sold by a Westport resident through a map gallery in New York.\n\n“Frank died in Westport in 1978.”\n\n“06880” readers: If you remember Frank Tchitcherine (or his mother’s document), click “Comments” and add details.\n\n==================================================\n\nLongtime Bedford and Staples teacher Donald DiGennaro died peacefully last Sunday, at the Watermark. He was age 86.\n\nThe Bridgeport native — a longtime resident of Trumbull — taught science in Westport for virtually his entire career.\n\nHe was an avid gardener and cook, with a love for Italy and Italian food, and greatly devoted to his family.\n\nDon was predeceased by his wife of 58 years, Theresa; son Leonard, and brothers Philip and Anthony.\n\nHe is survived by his children Philip (Dana Maiocco), Donna Pavitt (David); grandchildren Philip DiGennaro (Sarah), Michael DiGennaro (Kristyn), James DiGennaro, Joseph DiGennaro and Emly Pavitt; great-grandson Donovan DiGennaro, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral services were held privately.

It’s a staging area for Burns Construction, the contractor for a sewage collection system project nearby.\n\nThe company will lay 10,000 feet of pipe, to serve 121 properties on Evergreen Parkway, Tamarac Lane, Lone Pine Lane, Gorham Avenue, Brookside Drive, and a small section of Compo North.\n\nBecause it’s a dense neighborhood with many children — and to avoid impacting residents — Burns and the town’s Public Works Department asked Parks & Rec for permission to use Winslow Park as a staging area.\n\nBurns is stripping the topsoil, to avoid muddying the area. They’ll fence the section in too.\n\nTheir contract runs through December 28. However, the Engineering Department’s Bryan Thompson says, the work may not take that long.\n\nWhen they’re done, Burns will full restore the area, including hydroseeding.\n\nSigns will go up soon in the area, warning of construction vehicles entering the roadway.\n\n================================================\n\n“06880” has reported on the recent work done — after 3 years — on the (too)-large house being built to replace Positano restaurant, at 233 Hillspoint Road.\n\nAs Don Bergmann points out, it’s still not quite right. He writes: “The Blight Board gave the owner … 2 weeks to remove [not lower. as ‘06880’ reported] the chimney and cupola, by March 23.\n\n“The minutes, in draft form, of the Blight Prevention Board meeting on March 9, make this very clear. The removal of both items was to have occurred by March 23. The draft minutes are on the town website for meetings.”\n\n==================================================\n\nAt 7:15 yesterday morning, the Westport Police Department responded to a residence on a report of a disturbing social media post.\n\nThe caller — a local student — felt concerned about going to school, based on the post.\n\nOfficers immediately identified the source of the post. Working with the School Resource Officer and Detective Bureau, they identified the person responsible.\n\nOfficers went to each school until they located the responsible party. By 8 a.m., they determined that there was no threat.\n\n==================================================\n\nLooking for a way to celebrate Earth Day?\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department is sponsoring a “Clean Up Westport” event that Saturday (April 22).\n\nLetters have been sent to more than 2 dozen civic organizations, asking for help.\n\nGroups should call Parks & Rec (203-341-5091) before April 14, specifying the time and site of their effort. The town will then collect bagged garbage from each spot.\n\nBut you don’t have to be part of any pre-set location. Anyone can clean up any litter, anywhere in town.\n\nFree trash bags are available at the Parks & Rec office by the Longshore first tee on April 20, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. There’s a limit of 6 bags per organization, and they must be requested by April 19.\n\n==================================================\n\nThere were 2 sure signs of spring yesterday at Compo Beach:\n\nSand grooming equipment, and a kite.\n\nAnother springtime reminder: Starting Saturday (April 1), dogs are not allowed anywhere on the beach.\n\n=================================================\n\n“What’s Next in Weston” — the Y’s Men of Westport and Weston bi-weekly podcast — continues today.\n\nIt’s Part 2 of a discussion with 1st Selectwoman Sam Nestor of the the town’s grand list, mill rate, home values, and how it all relates to real estate taxes.\n\nClick below to see:\n\n==================================================\n\nDid you know there is only one zoo in Connecticut?\n\nThat it’s 99 years old, features 350 animals, and is just a few miles away in Bridgeport?\n\nThe Y’s Women learned all about the Beardsley Zoo, at a presentation by curators of education Jim Knox and Carolyn Rinaldi.\n\nThey described saving species from extinction, and the reintroduction of wild species into the state and beyond.\n\n==================================================\n\nBassist Rich Zurkowski and his guitarist daughter Chloe bring their instruments — and voices — to this week’s Jazz at the Post.\n\nThere are 2 shows this Thursday (March 30), at 7:30 and 8:45 p.m. (VFW Joseph J. Clinton Post 399). Dinner service begins at 7.\n\nThey’re joined by pianist Jesse Gribbon, drummer Eric Kalb and saxophonist Greg “The Jazz Rabbi” Wall. Reservations are highly recommended: JazzatthePost@gmail.com.\n\n=======================================================\n\nSmart Kids with Learning Disabilities — the Norwalk-based non-profit founded by former Westporter Jane Ross — has grown into an important, influential organization.

She was 91.\n\nThe Medford, Massachusetts native spent her life devoted to her faith, family and friends.\n\nShe served as eucharistic minister, Bible study leader and volunteer in her parishes. Mary also volunteered at CRIS radio. and taught English as a second language at the Mercy Learning Center.\n\nHer family says, “Through hard times and happy times, Mary stayed true to her husband, family, friends and herself. She was a devoted wife to Ed for 39 years, raising their family and then caring for Ed until his death in 1993.\n\n“As the central figure of her large family, Mary was present at just about all her children’s, grandchildren’s and great-grandchildren’s sporting events, school activities, concerts, graduations and parties. Our family was blessed to experience Mary’s love, light, wisdom, compassion and inner strength. She was a role model for all of us on how to ‘do it right’.”\n\nMary graduated from Regis College, and obtained her master’s degree in education from Fairfield University. She worked for the Westport Public Schools as a foreign language teacher for 25 years.\n\nMary passionately followed the University of Connecticut women’s basketball team, and the Boston Red Sox. She loved to travel, read, and play bridge and golf.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated this Saturday (March 25, 10 a.m., Church of the Assumption). Interment will follow in Willowbrook Cemetery.\n\nRelatives and friends may greet the family on Friday (March 24, 4 to 7 p.m., Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Road, Trumbull).\n\nMary is survived by her children Ed (Carol) of Windham, New Hampshire, Ken (Pam) of Epping, New Hampshire, Kevin (Janet) of Sacramento, Sharon of Torrington, Maureen Burdick of Trumbull, and Terri Matsen (Eric) of LaGrange, Kentucky; daughter-in-law Kate Murphy of Newburyport, Massachusetts; grandchildren Kahley Apostolou (Mike); Erin, John and Brian Murphy; Peter, Edward and Mary Grace Burdick; Conor, Nolan, Bridget and Jack Matsen; Jillian and Shane Murphy (Marisa), and great-grandchildren Logan Burdick, and Lyla and Mason Apostolou; brothers John V. Gibbons Jr. of North Kingston, Rhode Island and Robert Gibbons of Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, and several nieces and nephews.\n\nMary was predeceased by her husband Ed, son Dennis, grandson Christopher Stephen Murphy Burdick, son-in-law Carl Burdick, and sister Claire Gibbons Boyle.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory may be made to Down’s Syndrome of Louisville, 5001 South Hurstbourne Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40291 or Wigglewow, 10529 Watterson Trail, Louisville, KY 40299 (a natural dog biscuit company and retail center committed to providing disabled adults with supportive, purposeful employment opportunities).\n\n==================================================\n\nIt’s not often we run a “sky” image as our “Westport … Naturally” feature.\n\nBut it’s not often a photographer captures both the moon and Venus in the same shot.\n\nThe other day, Andrew Colabella did — framed by Saugatuck:\n\n=================================================\n\nAnd finally … in honor of the Earth Day town-wide cleanup (story above):\n\n“06880” is your hyper-local blog. We’re a non-profit (click here for more info about our work). We rely on reader donations. Thank you!\n\nThe Post Road East improvement project has begun.\n\nThe first step — long before installing turn lanes, crosswalks, shoulders and sidewalks on the stretch between Volvo of Westport and New Country Toyota — was the removal of a dozen or so trees.\n\nThey stood for decades in front of Linxweiler House — the former blacksmith shop between Fresh Market and McDonald’s, now owned and operate by Homes with Hope.\n\nThat property looks a lot different today, than it did last weekend:\n\nThe good news: The 2 cherry blossom trees in front of Sakura still stand.\n\n==================================================\n\nOn your mark … get set … and get ready for the 44th annual Minute Man Races\n\nThe popular Westport Young Woman’s League — set for Sunday, April 30 at Compo Beach — includes a 10K run, 5K run/walk, and kids’ fun runs (from 50 yards to 1 mile).\n\nFor professionals, it’s a USA Track and Field-certified event.

He sent “06880” a sample of his work:\n\nIn 2001, he created this 5-foot “egg” for the White House.\n\nIt was signed by 256 members of Congress.\n\nSlava Ukraini!\n\n==============================================\n\nMore progress on the house at 233 Hillspoint Road. Town officials halted construction there in 2019, after finding violations of the building permit.\n\nWorkers yesterday removed several feet from the top of the chimney. It had been built higher than its legal height.\n\n=================================================\n\nIn 2020, COVID forced Saugatuck Elementary School to cancel “The Little Mermaid” at the final dress rehearsal — before the opening curtain.\n\nShe’s back!\n\nA new cast of 125 students in grades 3-5 act, sing and dance — and run the lights and sound, help construct and decorate sets and props, and operate special effects.\n\nSaugatuck alums from 2020 (and even some of their parents) have helped with the show! Set designer Julie Colotti, costume designer Miriam Young, and prop managers Alexandra Dodwell and Amy Kopisz incorporated many original pieces, along with new additions.\n\nAfter his daughter Phoebe returned as a student acting coach, John Nunziato jumped in as artistic designer and special effects consultant.\n\nShows are Friday, March 31 (7 p.m.) and Saturday, April 1 (1 and 6:30 p.m.). Click here for tickets, and more information.\n\n==================================================\n\nYou can’t autograph an Mp3 download.\n\nBut you sure can sign a vinyl album.\n\nVersoFest’s headliners and guests, including producer Steve Lillywhite, Psychedelic Furs front man Richard Butler, and Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth, will autograph copies of their records, for giveaways and auction items during next weekend’s VersoFest.\n\nFestivalgoers can submit their entries for the giveaway starting with the March 30 kickoff concert featuring rising American rock band Sunflower Bean.\n\nSubmissions are open through Sunday, April 2.

(Sure, it was in February. But I just found out. It’s still worth sharing!)\n\nAnd it’s “06880”-worthy because she’s the granddaughter of longtime Westporters Ed and Kay See.\n\nEd — an attorney — was longtime town counsel. He played a key role in Westport’s purchase of Longshore, in 1959.\n\nKay supported many local causes. She was on the Westport Library board, when the new building was built.\n\nThe See family’s stained glass window hangs over the altar of Assumption Church, near the Josê Feliciano window.\n\nEloise See — Ed and Kay’s daughter — is Kaitlin’s proud mother. Sandy is her equally proud uncle.\n\nThe award was even more special, because the presenter was presidential inaugural poet — and Kaitlin’s fellow Harvard graduate — Amanda Gorman.\n\nAlphabet Rockers produces and performs music and dance that promotes racial and gender awareness.\n\n=================================================\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Westport is a beautiful building.\n\nOn April 1 (8 p.m.), its the site too of Damn Tall Buildings.\n\nThat’s the hot bluegrass/indie/roots/old-time/vintage swing/Americana band from Brooklyn. The trio will headline the UU’s Voices Café.\n\nThere’s table or individual seating. Bring your own beverages and snacks, or buy at the sweet treats table. General admission: $25 per person. A portion of the proceeds support the congregation’s Social Justice Council. Click here for tickets (live and livestream), and more information.\n\n==================================================\n\nToday’s “Westport … Naturally” photo proves: There’s nothing like a nice early spring day to put the top down, and enjoy the sun.\n\n==================================================\n\nAnd finally … on this date in 1721, – Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated 6 concertos to Margrave Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Today we know them as the Brandenburg Concertos.\n\n(“06880” is your hyper-local blog. We’re a non-profit, dedicated to bringing the community together.
