        "text": "Moffly Media Evening of Art, Wine & Jazz Powered by BMW of Ridgefield\n\nWith support from Personal Chef Brian Bender\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nSOLO GUITAR\n\nLIVE in the theater – socially distanced, limited capacity seating! To purchase 6 or more tickets, please call the box office 203.438.5795. Please maintain a 6 foot distance from others. Face masks are required at all times.\n\nJoin us in the lobby at 6:30pm for an art exhibit by RPAC Gallery artist Charles Gulbrandsen!\n\nGuitar icon John Scofield is a one-of-a-kind jazz master and a 3-time Grammy award-winning artist with more than 40 recordings to his credit. NPR describes Scofield as “one of the most prolific and admired jazz musicians of his generation.” As a principal innovator of modern jazz guitar, he played alongside Miles Davis for more than three years, and his work has influenced guitar greats since the late ’70s. Scofield is a creative artist of a rare sort: a stylistic chameleon who has forged a consistent, rock-solid aesthetic identity who demonstrates fluency in bebop, blues, jazz-funk, jam band, orchestral ensembles, and various others with ease and enthusiasm. Now he adds yet another credit to his resume: solo guitarist.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the advertised date of a performance is subject to change as we abide by local and federal guidelines. Due to social distancing guidelines your seat choices may be modified and we will do our best to accommodate you. Original tickets will be valid for any rescheduled date or reissued. If you are a ticket holder unable to attend a rescheduled date, there are no refunds; however, exchanges will be available through the box office."
