        "text": "Music Bingo with DJ HALO @ Boxyard RTP\n\nDJ HALO (aka Jeep Ward) has been DJing since 1997 and an intense music nerd for his entire life. Having toured the US and the world over as well as club DJing in the major metro markets of NYC and SF/OAK his tastes and influences are wide-ranging. Expect to be surprised by his selections but he will always give you clues to pick the right answer. Having had a successful morning drive radio show for many years in Bridgeport, CT on 10K watt independent radio station WPKN (recently featured in The New Yorker as “The Greatest Radio Station in The World”) HALO’s hosting will be fast-paced, topical, improvisational, and hilarious.\n\nThe rules are simple, 45-60 seconds of a song is played all of the boards have either song titles that are said in the segment he plays or the artist is recognizable enough that they can be easily identified. Once all have marked their choice the next song is played with 4 rounds of play over the course of the event with any balance of time at the end HALO will DJ. Each round’s play board has 3 varied configurations to each play board so team play is highly recommended as well as more environmentally friendly. Once a player calls bingo it will be verified and the next round’s play boards will be distributed. All songs will be radio-friendly versions so feel free to bring kids!\n\nRounds for August:\n\nFrom a Little Place Called…\n\n– songs that call out a specific geographic location\n\nThe Dream of The 90’s\n\n– songs from the 90’s all genres\n\nIndie Rock Rockin’ It\n\n– indie rock songs from all eras w a focus on the mid-late 2000’s\n\nWeddings Are Cool Brah\n\n– songs that will get you dancing with grandma at your homie’s nuptials"
