        "text": "How y’all doing,,, This is ‘news’ for my readers in Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia; and all you late-nite folk in the Americas. I’ll be doing an overnight show on WPKN FM 89.5 in Bridgeport CT the the wee hours of Sunday morning 2A – 5A 10.26.14. That’s otherwise known as really late Saturday night.\n\nPerhaps you work the late shift.\n\nPerhaps there’s been an evening of poor decisions.\n\nOr maybe it’s a normal sunny mid-day in New Zealand. Anyhow. Let us help you. My good ole buddy JBW and I have dug deep thru our LP stacks to find 3 hours worth of the best bittersweet late 60s and early 70s rock obscurities you’ve never heard. We’ll be playing nothing but vinyl all night and talking in some kinda coded crate-digger sprache . Catch us on the air if yr within 60 or so miles of Bridgeport, or online anywhere in the world at WPKN.org. Just go to WPKN.org and click the ‘Listen Now’ button.\n\nThis Thursday Oct 23 2014 will be my first-ever solo performance. I’ve created a system of pulse-synchronized analog synths and four-track cassette machine that I will manipulate live with a quadraphonic sound system. I will be improvising on the disparate themes of: the creation of the world, the death of a loved one, and the Twentieth Century. The performance is part of the University of Bridgeport/ Housatonic CC “One Plus One” show of art and design-school faculty. Here’s the details from the press release:\n\nUniversity of Bridgeport’s Shintaro Askatsu School of Design & Housatonic Community College Co-Host Faculty Art and Design Exhibition\n\n“One Plus One” Show Opens with Oct. 23rd Reception, from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. at Schelfhaudt Gallery\n\nFaculty members from Housatonic Community College and Shintaro Akatsu School of Design will show their own work in a collaborative exhibit named “One Plus One”. The show features graphic design, painting, photos, sculpture, video art, drawing, digital arts, typography, installation, and illustrations created by 27 faculty members from both schools.\n\nThe opening reception on Oct. 23rd from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. is free and open to the public.\n\nShintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD) on the University of Bridgeport campus is located in the Arnold Bernhard Center (ABC), 84 Iranistan Avenue, Bridgeport, CT 06604.\n\nFor more information about this and other upcoming exhibitions, contact Gallery Director Peter Konsterlie at 203.576.4034, or schelfhaudtgallery@gmail.com.\n\nI’ll be doing the 22 minute piece between 6 and 7. It is free and open to all.\n\nWe’ve covered some fairly obscure + forgotten audio publications here at PS dot com, but this one takes the taart. RADIO EXPRES was a Nederlands DIY radio/audio magazine published from 1932 through 1939, and perhaps longer. Well, it was certainly published for the entire year 1939 (22) issues, since I’ve ended up with that pile of them here. As is typical of ‘radio’ publications in the pre hi-fidelity era, the emphasis is much more on RF than AF, but I still managed to find a few interesting articles of possible use to y’all audio-folk. First off: this cute lil 4-watt Grammafoon Versterker (that’s a phonograph amplifier, btw):\n\nDOWNLOAD THE COMPLETE VERSTERKER ARTICLE (9M PDF):\n\nDownload:GrammofoonVersterker\n\nThe ‘Lampen,’ or ‘tubes’ used are an E99 high-gain triode input stage and an AL5 pentode output tube. Interestingly, these are both 4V filament tubes. The 4V filament is not seen in any US-manufacture audio tubes that I have ever come across.\n\nThe article, penned by one J. L. Leistra, spans two issues of Radio Expres and it is very thorough. It covers all of the theory involved in developing the circuit, and the second part gets into some pretty extensive detail regarding the feedback-based compensation filter. It wraps up with fabrication, layout, and wiring instruction. It’s all written in Dutch, btw.\n\n*************\n\n*******\n\n***\n\nThe only other really interesting audio-bit that I could discern was this 3pp exposition of the then- ‘neu’ Phillips EL5 (incorrectly indicated as an ‘FL5’ in the above image) 18-watt output pentode. The EL5 seems like a tube worth exploring; it’s a high-power, 6.3v filamant audio output tube designed to run ona pretty low plate voltage (250- 275) for such a high powered tube. Could be useful in some situations. Anyone using EL5s? Here’s the whole article for you to…. look at. (unless you read Dutch, of course).\n\nDOWNLOAD: EL5_amp\n\nI’ll leave off with a quick survey of the best part of this run of magazines: the incredible, world-envied graphic design that the Nederlands is still renowned for almost a century later. Enjoy – c."
