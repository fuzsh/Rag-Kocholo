        "text": "Westporters write books on a wide variety of subjects in all sorts of genres. Authors Gabi Coatsworth and Ted Aldrich will share their new books - a memoir and a history with our community. Saugatuck Scribes is a series that showcases Westport writers and their newest books: Love's Journey Home, Gabi Coatsworth; The Partnership: George Marshall, Henry Stimson, and the Extraordinary Collaboration that Won World War II by Edward Farley Aldrich.\n\nMiles Rapoport and state senator Will Haskell will discuss whether it is time for the United States to take the leap and recognize voting as both a fundamental civil right and a civic duty. In 100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting, co-authors E.J. Dionne and Miles Rapoport argue that every citizen has the right to vote and full opportunities to do so—but also the duty to vote, a requirement to participate in our national choices.\n\nWhat do we need to know about Ukraine’s past, to understand what’s happening there today and tomorrow? Professor Wolodymyr Zaryckyj will provide insights into this fascinating and important country that most Americans know only through recent news reports and images. “06880” executive editor Dan Woog will moderate the discussion, and lead a question-and-answer period at the end with Professor Zarycky.\n\nIn order to increase awareness and promote understanding in the arenas of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and gender-identity, TEAM Westport and The Westport Library are co-sponsoring the Ninth Annual Teen Diversity Essay Contest for students in grades 9, 10, 11, and 12 who attend Staples High School or another school in Westport, or reside in Westport and attend school elsewhere. Last year’s TEAM Westport contest focused on stereotypes. Last year’s TEAM Westport contest focused on “Black Lives Matter”.\n\nAlmost Happy authors Dr. Brian Kaplan and Hephzibah Kaplan talk with Elaine Daignault, Westport’s director of Health & Human Services about how to laugh your way to change. Dr. Brian Kaplan spent many years training in whole person approaches to health, well-being, and personal development. Brian has made regular appearances on Sky News, BBC Radio, LBC and local radio and has contributed chapters and forewords to several books.\n\nHephzibah Kaplan is a qualified art therapist, psychotherapy supervisor and artist. She founded the London Art Therapy Centre in 2010, and is its director as well as senior art therapist, supervisor,...\n\nMore\n\nand head of training. She is a recognized national and international teacher and workshop facilitator, and appeared on BBC World News and radio.\n\nDinitia Smith, author of The Prince, discusses her novel with Erica Melnichok. The Prince is a modern retelling of The Golden Bowl by Henry James.\n\nFrom their grand mansion on the Upper East Side to their magical private island in Long Island Sound, everything points to the Woodford family as being perfect and idyllic. Dinitia Smith is the author of four previous novels, including The Illusionist, which was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, and her short stories have been published in numerous magazines.\n\nSelf-taught photographer Tom Kretsch has traveled near and far in search of “Peaceful Places,” those special spots where he can capture images that evoke a soothing and calming moment. From Tuscany to Maine, to right here in his hometown of Westport, Tom uses light, texture, form, and color to create the kind of moments that give a serene aura to his photographs. Join Miggs Burroughs for a look inside Tom’s studio, and see how the magic happens.\n\nMeet author Jai Chakrabarti as he discusses his debut novel A Play for the End of the World with Westport Country Playhouse assistant artistic director, Liam Lonegan. A dazzling debut novel—set in early 1970’s New York and rural India—the story of a turbulent, unlikely romance, a harrowing account of the lasting horrors of the Second World War, and a searing examination of one man’s search for forgiveness and acceptance.\n\nWestport author Lisa Cloherty shares the journey of her two new picture books with fellow author Michaela MacColl. Find out who Katie Spector the Art Collector and Terrance the Hothead are and how they came to be. These two stories may inspire you to write our next Saugatuck Scribes book."
