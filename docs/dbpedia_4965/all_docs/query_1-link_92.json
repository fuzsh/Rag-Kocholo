Its greatest strength may be its role as a group show, where voices emerge in a jumble, and get behind a narrative of acceptance and visibility. Each offers something slightly different: a reframed viewpoint, a personal anecdote put to paper or canvas, a vignette or five that dive into love, sex, joy, and beauty. As they whisper and chatter with each other and with viewers from the walls, City Lights seems to speak with a united voice too. Welcome, the gallery says from every single vantage point. We’re so glad you’re here. Come exactly as you are.” New Haven Arts Paper\n\nSAMESEX Exhibit:\n\nArtists: Christopher Augerson, Mario Baez, Patrice Barrett, Marieta Capobianco, Benjamin Casiano, Darron Copeland, Kevin Cox, Erica Czerwinski, Coco Garner, Andrew Graham, Delayne Gratopp, Kate Henderson, Don Houston, Susan Stinson-Hurwitz, Maxwell Kale, Niki Key, Mia Lipstick, Luis Lopez, Barbara Loss, Samuel McPherson, Ricky Mestre, Nancy Moore, Dale Parson, Adrian Pulido, Jon Puozzoli, Barbara Ringer, Ellen Schindermann, Susan Tabachnick, Richard Taddei, Amanda Walker\n\nSameSex Exhibit explores LGBT themes, same-sex attraction, related feelings and issues of 2019.

Our intention is to engage students during school and after school. It takes several days to create and mount a new exhibit. The learning panels are designed so all teachers, especially the art teacher across the hall from the gallery space, can use or visit the gallery space any time. The content presented is designed to promote art appreciation, transferable skills and increase vocabulary. We also will schedule classroom visits with visiting artists who are exhibiting in the Roosevelt school gallery space. As we receive more funding, we can even spend more time at Roosevelt School.
