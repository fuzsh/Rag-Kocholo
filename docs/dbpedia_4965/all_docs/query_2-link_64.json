Come back. Well, thanks for the invitation, Flint. As hundreds of journalists gather to kick off SEJ's conference, we'll celebrate the strength, smarts and sounds of the Vehicle City. Hear what people learned from the water crisis that could help other communities responding to environmental disaster. Sponsored in part by the C.S. Mott Foundation. Cash-only bar. Coverage.\n\nEmcees:\n\nEmilia Askari, Journalist and Educator, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and Research Assistant, Michigan State University\n\nBrian Bienkowski, Senior Editor, Environmental Health News and The Daily Climate\n\nSpeakers:\n\nKelli Crump, Associate Artist and Audience Engagement Facilitator, Flint Repertory Theater\n\nLaShaya Darisaw, Community Activist\n\nTiara Darisaw, Youth Social and Political Advocate\n\nMona Hanna-Attisha, Pediatrician and Author, \"What The Eyes Don't See: A Story of Crisis, Resistance, and Hope in an American City\"\n\nBruce Lanphear, Professor, Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University\n\nIsaiah Oliver, President and Chief Executive Officer, Community Foundation of Greater Flint\n\nEvening Plenary\n\nFuture of Cars\n\n8:30 - 10:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Factory One, 303 West Water Street, Flint (map)\n\nFactory One is a very short walk from the Riverfront Conference Center. After the program at Factory One, we'll walk back to the Riverfront to catch shuttles back to hotels.\n\nThe panel will look at the big changes ahead, as autonomy, electrification and connectivity come together in the next few years to create the biggest change in car culture since the horse gave way to the horseless carriage. The private car could become obsolete, as consumers hail fleet-owned self-driving cars to get to their destinations. If current trends continue, the mobility traditions in place for more than a century — governing vehicle use, sales, service, branding, competition, parking, fueling and more — will be profoundly altered. This revolution holds promise for the planet. Today's cars are driven only five percent of the time, but electric fleet cars, in addition to being zero emission, will stay on the road 24/7. That means a much-smaller global auto park, perhaps a 70 percent reduction, and a corresponding drop in the need for the parking that currently occupies 50 to 60 percent of urban downtowns. There are a billion parking spaces in the U.S., four for every car on the road! Sponsored in part by General Motors. Coverage.\n\nModerator: Jim Motavalli, Freelance Environmental Journalist; Contributor, The New York Times, Car Talk at NPR; Author; and Radio Host, WPKN-FM\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMichael Ableson, Vice President, Global Strategy, General Motors\n\nJohn DeCicco, Research Professor, University of Michigan Energy Institute and Director, University of Michigan Energy Survey\n\nMichelle Krebs, Automotive Writer; Executive Analyst, Autotrader; and former Senior Auto Analyst and Editor, Edmunds.com"
