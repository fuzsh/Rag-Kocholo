The chemist’s daughter, Nancy Byck Welch located Hugh Karraker, Executive Producer of All Things Bakelite and great grandson of Leo Baekeland through Jessie Fowler, a Bakelite jewelry designer and Costume Jewelry Collectors International.\n\nIn three short videos with interviews from Nancy and family photographs, Director, John Maher and Editor, Craig Mikhitarian, tell the story of Larry Byck and “Dr. Baekeland.” Experience this amazing and until now, unknown story in these three short video clips —\n\nMy Father and Leo – YouTube Video\n\nThe Embed Art Company\n\nAt Perth Amboy, a division of the General Bakelite Company was molding Bakelite (phenolic resin) into household objects. Working as a chemist in the research and development division (R & D), Larry followed his artistic talents by embedding artwork, photographs, lettering, etc. into the resin creating pendants and paperweights. He also found that by dipping Bakelite beads into multiple synthetic coatings of nacre (ground up pearls), he created what appeared to be natural pearls. These creations were sold under the name, Embed Art.\n\nThe business folded in the mid ‘20s. Larry moved with Bakelite to Bound Brook, NJ and found other creative outlets in photography, gardening, music. He also raised a son, Larry and a daughter, Nancy. In 1956, Larry passed away while still working for the Bakelite Division of Union Carbide Corporation at Bound Brook. Nancy possesses a varied collection of her father’s creations.\n\nNancy Byck Welch celebrates Embed Art – YouTube Video\n\nNancy Byck Welch remembers The Anchorage – YouTube Video\n\nBack to top >\n\nLoretta Gardner Memoir\n\nIn this video, Hugh Karraker interviews Loretta Gardner, a former employee of the Bakelite Corporation in Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n\nBack to top >\n\nJoseph Zuccarelli Memoir\n\nJohn Maher interviews Joseph Zuccarelli, longtime employee of The Bakelite Corporation and Union Carbide/Dow.\n\nBack to top >\n\n2009 Roundtable Research Session\n\nIn 2009, John Maher conducts a roundtable research interview with five employees at the Union Carbide/Dow facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n\nBack to top >\n\nWPKN Interview #1 with Pete Stewart (radio)\n\nInterview conducted by Pete Stewart, of Bridgeport, CT’s community sponsored radio station, WPKN, with Director, John Maher and Media Manager, Marc Huberman on April 7, 2017.\n\nBack to top >\n\nWPKN Interview #2 with Pete Stewart\n\n(radio)\n\nInterview with Pete Stewart, of Bridgeport, CT’s community sponsored radio station, WPKN, with Executive Producer, Hugh Karraker and Director, John Maher on April 1, 2019.\n\nBack to top >\n\nWPKN Interview with David Schwartz and Dolly Curtis (radio)\n\nInterview with Dolly Curtis, engineered by David Schwartz of Railroad Dave Radio, on CT’s community sponsored radio station, WPKN with Executive Producer, Hugh Karraker, Director, John Maher and Media Manager, Marc Huberman on April 7, 2019."
