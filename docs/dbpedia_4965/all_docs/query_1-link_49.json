        "text": "May 31, 2014 — Dolly Curtis will interview Ken Karl and Joe and Jack Kochiss regarding the discovery of an 1840 oystering barge from the Eastside River fishing docks in New York City to the Fair Haven section of New Haven on Sunday, June 1, at 10 p.m. on WPKN 89.5 FM .\n\nAfter decades of attempts the oystering barge is about to be moved to a marine museum and restored for its significance. The primary people involved in the project will be talking with Ms. Curtis about the details.\n\nBoaters and historians as well as those who love turning a challenge into a reality may be interested in hearing about the oystering barge. The broadcast takes place live and will be archived on dollycurtis.com.\n\n“We are about to save a 125-year working boat from the late 19th century located by chance right here in Connecticut, unbeknownst to most of us, “Ms. Curtis said. “Also we are trying to fulfill a lifetime dream of Jack Kochiss and that alone makes this of much importance.”\n\nJoe and jack Kochiss are Trumbull residents. Jack worked at Mystic Seaport for 25 years. He became an expert in commercial wooden boats in those many years while he was employed and writing publications and books on working wooden boats. Much of his writings are sought after, out of print and considered the “classics” on these working boats, according to Ms. Curtis.\n\n“In this case we are saving an oystering barge of the late 1890s era from the New York City east side East River docks,” she said. “The wholesale fish markets were located there."
