        "text": "WPKN-FM is a listener-supported, non-commercial radio station broadcasting at 10,000 watts on 89.5 Mhz FM in Bridgeport, CT. The station also broadcasts to the bulk ... See more of Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut, Suffolk County in New York (Long Island) as well as parts of Rhode Island. The station dates back to the early 1960’s when it was affiliated with the University of Bridgeport. For the past 15 or so years, WPKN has not been affiliated with UB, but broadcasts from facilities located on the campus. WPKN’s programming mix is a cornucopia of genres and styles. From the obscure to the recognizable, WPKN is proud of its bold independence and its fearlessness to program without any strings attached. Turn us on and you’ll hear everything from Bluegrass to Haitian voodoo; from lush classical strings to electroclash; from bebop jazz to 60’s psychedelia; from Americana to spoken word. Some of our self-produced talk/news oriented shows such as Between the Lines are nationally recognized. We dare to be different, topical to be challenging and entertaining. All of the station’s programming is controlled by individual DJs and not dictated by any management or staff. Our programming is nearly 100% self-originated and we also maintain close ties with Pacifica Radio. HOW DOES WPKN RECEIVE ITS FUNDING? WPKN receives no corporate or government funding–we are funded by our WPKN listeners through our on-air fundraising events as well as through the support of other non-profit organizations in the form of broadcast NPA’s. HOW CAN I LISTEN TO WPKN ON THE WEB? Access our station on-line via the web and iPhone applications through our home page and also look for us on iTunes Radio, Public Radio Tuner, Wonder Radio and other tuners. ------ Shows: Latino USA, This Way Out, Free Speech Radio News, Alternative Radio, World of Radio, Between the Lines ----- Hosts: Greg Gordon, Lucia Chappelle, Jd Doyle, Glenn Hauser"
