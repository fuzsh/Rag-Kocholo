The museum is located on Montauk Highway at West Gate Road, 3 miles west of Southampton Village.\n\nThis month David Martine talks with Shinnecock mother, grandmother and singer Tina Tarrant about her work exploring the language of the Shinnecock people, a dialect of Algonquin.\n\nTina may be best known as a member of the award winning singing group The Thunder Bird Sisters.\n\nHer grandfather, Chief Thunder Bird, led the cultural revival of the Shinnecock people and started the annual Pow Wow that brings native and non-native people from all over North America to the Shinnecock reservation each September.\n\nTina Tarrant talks with David Martine about researching the language and how she incorporated the language into the modern songs recorded by the Thunder Bird Sisters.\n\nListen here:\n\nMuseum Moment airs on the second Tuesday each month at 11:55 a.m. – just before First Voices Indigenous Radio with Tiokasin Ghosthorse – now originating from WPKN’s Bridgeport studios. The program explores issues of indigenous peoples worldwide. It is distributed nationally by Pacifica Radio."
