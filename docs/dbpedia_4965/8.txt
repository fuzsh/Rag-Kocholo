WPKN Radio program explores the Shinnecock language with Tina Tarrant of the Thunder Bird Sisters and Shinnecock Museum Director David Martine.

Every month WPKN Radio – at 89.5 FM and streaming on wpkn.org presents Museum Moment with David Martine, Director of the Shinnecock Cultural Center and Museum.

Museum Moment looks at exhibits and activities at Long Island’s only native-owned Indian museum. The museum is located on Montauk Highway at West Gate Road, 3 miles west of Southampton Village.

This month David Martine talks with Shinnecock mother, grandmother and singer Tina Tarrant about her work exploring the language of the Shinnecock people, a dialect of Algonquin.

Tina may be best known as a member of the award winning singing group The Thunder Bird Sisters.

Her grandfather, Chief Thunder Bird, led the cultural revival of the Shinnecock people and started the annual Pow Wow that brings native and non-native people from all over North America to the Shinnecock reservation each September.

Tina Tarrant talks with David Martine about researching the language and how she incorporated the language into the modern songs recorded by the Thunder Bird Sisters.

Museum Moment airs on the second Tuesday each month at 11:55 a.m. – just before First Voices Indigenous Radio with Tiokasin Ghosthorse – now originating from WPKN’s Bridgeport studios. The program explores issues of indigenous peoples worldwide. It is distributed nationally by Pacifica Radio.
