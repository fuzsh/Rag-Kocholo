Parents need to know that The Reef: Stalked is a thriller about a group of female Australian kayakers who are stalked by a shark and subsequently features near constant threat and occasional bloody violence. During a trip designed to help Nic (Teressa Liane) recover from a personal tragedy, the main characters show themselves to be brave and compassionate, only occasionally snapping at each other under pressure. Owing to Nic's trauma there is some discussion of mental health as her friends try to help her find her passion for kayaking and diving again. The violence is brief and mainly revolves around the main quartet of characters' battles with a killer shark. Death and some dead bodies are shown, as well as some bloody injury, but neither is graphic. There is also domestic violence, with a woman berated and killed by her partner. There is not much swearing, although as the tension increases, characters are more frequently use "f--k" and "s--t."
