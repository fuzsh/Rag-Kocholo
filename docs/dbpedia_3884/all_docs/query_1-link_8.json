        "text": "We were inspired from the very moment we sat in theaters and watched the story of Moana unfold, which is why it’s our go-to when we’re in search of gorgeous, enlightened quotes. Read on for inspiration from Moana, Maui, Gramma Tala, and more:\n\nMoana\n\n\"I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat, sail across the sea, and restore the heart of Te Fiti.\"\n\n“Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface … Far beneath, in some cases.”\n\n“What if we fish beyond the reef?”\n\n\"Okay, first, I'm not a princess, I'm the daughter of the chief.\"\n\n\"There's a whole ocean!\"\n\n\"There's more beyond the reef.\"\n\n\"We were voyagers!\"\n\n\"The Ocean chose me.\"\n\n\"I am self-taught.\"\n\nMaui\n\n\"Hero of men. It's actually 'Maui, shapeshifter, Demigod of the wind and sea, hero of men.' I interrupted, from the top—hero of men. Go.\"\n\n“When you use a bird to write with, it’s called tweeting.”\n\n\"It's called wayfinding, princess. It's not just sails and knots, it's seeing where you're going in your mind. Knowing where you are by knowing where you've been.\"\n\n\"If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.\"\n\n\"Listen. For a thousand years, I've only been thinking about keepin' this hair silky, getting my hook, and being awesome, again.\"\n\n\"I've got your back, chosen one. Go save the world.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nGramma Tala\n\n“In the beginning, there was only ocean.”\n\n\"I'm the village crazy lady—that's my job.\"\n\n\"Whatever just happened ... Blame it on the pig.\"\n\n\"I'm his mom, I don't have to tell him anything.\"\n\n\"When I die, I'm going to come back as one of these. Or I chose the wrong tattoo.\"\n\n\"Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?\"\n\n\"Go inside, bang the drum, and find out.\"\n\n\"But one day, someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti.\"\n\n\"There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you.\"\n\n\"If you are ready to go home, I will be with you.\"\n\nTamatoa\n\n\"Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself? Because if you are ... I will gladly do so—in song form!\"\n\n\"Just pick an eye, babe.\"\n\n\"I ate my grandma! And it took a week because she was absolutely humongous.\"\n\n\"The power of creation ... For a crustacean!\"\n\n\"Hey! Hey! Did you like the song?\"\n\n\"Can we be real? If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent, you'd totally help me. You would, you know you would.\"\n\nChief Tui\n\n\"There will come a time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain, like I did, like my father did, like his father and every chief that has ever been.\"\n\n\"No one goes beyond the reef!\"\n\n“It suits you.”\n\nSina\n\n\"Sometimes, who we wish we were, what we wish we could do, it's just not meant to be.\"\n\n“He’s hard on you because … because he was you.”"
