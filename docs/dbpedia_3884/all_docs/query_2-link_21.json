        "text": "The shark attack thriller The Reef: Stalked is coming to Shudder, and they’ve released a new trailer and announced that the movie will be released on the streaming service on July 29th.\n\nThe movie serves as a sequel to the 2010 film The Reef. The director of the first movie, Andrew Traucki, returned to write and direct the sequel.\n\nThe first film is described as being “one of the best shark attack horror movies ever made, a simple tale of friends stranded in shark-infested waters that’s made all the more terrifying due to Traucki’s insistence on using real sharks rather than animatronic or computer-generated ones.”\n\nI love the fact that he threw his actors into real shark infested waters to shoot this movie.\n\nIn the sequel, “Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”\n\nTraucki said in a statement: “I want to give the audience a tense, thrilling adrenalin ride. I strongly believe that the best way to achieve this is by using suggestion rather than revelation. The real fear in this story isn’t a menacing shark but wondering where that shark might be and will it attack? In other words like in life, the fear and tension in The Reef: Stalked will come from the unknown and uncertainty, what you can’t see rather than what you can.”"
