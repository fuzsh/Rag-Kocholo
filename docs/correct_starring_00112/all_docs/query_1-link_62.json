        "text": "The Right Stuff\n\nDirected by: Philip Kaufman - 3 hours, 13 minutes - 1983 - USA - Color - 1.85:1\n\nStarring: Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Barbara Hershey, Fred Ward, Veronica Cartwright, Kim Stanley\n\nBased on the Tom Wolfe novel, The Right Stuff is the story of the Mercury astronauts, who were selected from amongst test pilots to become the first American men to venture into space. The actors, many of whom were chosen for their resemblance to the real-life astronauts, all ended up becoming stars in the 80's (well, if you consider Lance Henriksen a star. I do.) Beyond the astronauts and their wives, all other characters are painted as buffoons, including phenomenal turns from Donald Moffat as LBJ, and Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer as government lackeys."
