        "text": "Ed Harris is set to direct an adaptation of Kim Zupan’s acclaimed neo-noir novel The Ploughmen.\n\nNick Nolte, Bill Murray and Owen Teague are set to star in the movie, which will go into production in Montana this Fall. Amy Madigan and Lily Harris are also set for the film.\n\nThe Ploughmen follows a strange friendship that develops between a haunted young deputy sheriff and a notorious old murderer, according to the film’s synopsis: “John Gload (Nolte) is a killer so adept at his job that only now has he been apprehended. Val Millimaki (Teague) is low man in the Copper County Sheriff department. As Val continues his unlucky streak of finding dead bodies, Sheriff (Murray) puts him on night duty to try and get Gload to reveal his past. Val finds much in common with his prisoner, and dangerously seeks counsel from him.”\n\nHarris, Ginger Sledge and Robert Knott will produce along with Claude Dal Farra and Brian Keady of BCDF Pictures. Concourse Media and CAA Media Finance are handling sales out of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHarris, who is repped by CAA and Ziffren Brittenham, was most recently seen in the A24 film Love Lies Bleeding. The Ploughmen will be the third film that Harris directs, after his 2008 Western Appaloosa and the multi-Oscar nominated Pollock, the 2000 film in which he played artist Jackson Pollock.\n\nNolte, repped by CAA, Tavistock Wood, and Jackoway Austen, was most recently seen in Rian Johnson’s Peacock series Poker Face and Disney’s The Mandalorian. Murray, repped by Nochimson Law, is currently in theaters with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Teague, repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen, can currently be seen in 20th Century’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes."
