I expected a cookie cutter biopic (or 7). It was long, but never felt TOO long and was a good flight through history of the space program. Goldblum and Dennis Quaid brought a lot of life to a movie with a lot of life.\n\nYou You You Got It submitted by Meginator on August 27, 2022, 9:43pm This slightly fictionalized portrayal of the Mercury Project lacks some of the rough honesty of the book on which it is based, but it still manages to show a different side of the early NASA program that often gets ignored. Chuck Yeager and the other test pilots of Edwards Air Force Base are often overlooked in favor of the Mercury astronauts who soon succeeded them at the edge of the atmosphere, but their story is integral to understanding the mindset of the Mercury 7 and the film does a decent job of translating the spirit of Tom Wolfeâ€™s book to the silver screen. The acting is outstanding, the special effects are convincing (and hold up really well over time), and the story is compelling even though its broad contours are already known to most of its audience. This is a must-see for anyone interested in the early US space program."
