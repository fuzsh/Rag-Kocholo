        "text": "High praise in Hollywood doesn't get much higher than that from legendary actor Ed Harris. With a resume that boasts films such as Apollo 13, The Rock, The Truman Show, The Abyss, Glengarry Glen Ross, and The Right Stuff, to name just a few, he knows what he's talking about.\n\nHowever, even with a resume made up of classic after classic, working with co-star and co-director Lily Rabe on the Reagan Era set dramedy Downtown Owl, which is available to buy or rent now on digital, ranks high on the golden moments of his career.\n\n\"It was kind of an extraordinary experience for me because I had never felt as comfortable working with someone as I did with Lily,\" he recalled. \"She's really a great listener, and she's got a good heart. We enjoyed each other. I don't know what else to say other than when you trust your fellow actors and you know that they're there for you as well as you are there for them, it opens you up, frees you, and allows you to focus and do your best work, or try to anyway.\"\n\nIn Downtown Owl, Rabe plays Julia Rabia, a high school teacher who finds herself in the small town of Owl, North Dakota - initially planning to stay for only one semester. However, she finds herself drawn to the place, its people, and its problems; before too long, she doesn't know if she's come to town to get away from home or to find it. Among the people she grows close to is Harris' fascinating but unassuming Horace Jones. Downtown Owl's ensemble cast also boasts Vanessa Hudgens, Henry Golding, Finn Wittrock, and co-director Hamish Linklater.\n\n\"I've seen both of Lily and Hamish’s work and respect it and the choices that they've made,\" Harris said. Both of them make their directorial debut with the adaptation of the Chuck Klosterman novel. \"At some point, you have to give over to trying to fulfill their vision of the piece they've decided to do. I had no trouble doing that here because I trusted them, and we would talk about things beforehand. You see how they're working with other actors and handling themselves on set, so you kind of say, 'Okay, let's just get on with it.' It was interesting, too, because Lily was directing, but she was acting in it, so when I was working with her, it was mainly Hamish directing. Lily and I had a great relationship. I loved working with her, and it was extremely comfortable. You go on for a ride and try not to fall off a cliff.\"\n\nEven with over 100 films and TV shows on his name and stage performances in a career spanning almost 50 years, Harris found welcome challenges in playing Horace.\n\n\"He's been in that town forever,\" he explained. \"He knows everything that's going on. He befriends this young woman, and Horace tries to help her adjust to where she is in that kind of setting. Plus, he's caring for his wife, who is immobile and dying. He's a very simple guy in a way, but he's much more of an observer than a participant in this town, or at least at this time of his life.\"\n\n\"The challenge to me is to try to tell the truth and to be honest about who you're playing and where you're coming from, moment to moment. You've got to have your feet on the ground, breathe, listen to the people you're with, and pay attention. At this point in my career, a lot of it is instinctual; you trust your instincts, your ability, and what you've learned over the years and see where it takes you. A lot of it is often not pre-planned; you do your homework and hope you're present in the moment and doing a good job.\"\n\nHarris and Rabe share many scenes, a handful of which offer him a real opportunity to showcase his ability to turn in a powerhouse performance, especially through monologues. However, one scene between a distressed and drunk Julia and Horace on the school sports field at night is heartbreaking and breathtaking.\n\n\"I think there was an element of the story that was taken out where the guy who's sitting with up in the stands with Horace, he's been conned by that guy and lost all of the savings that he had from his wife after she very recently passed, which complicates the issue,\" he recalled. \"He sees that Lily's character is totally distraught, and he feels bad, but he's also in such pain, and he's very drunk at the time, so he's in a conflicted place. A lot was going on in that little scene.\"\n\nThe town of Owl, North Dakota, is fictional. The film wasn't shot in the state, with Rabe and Linklater opting to shoot in Minnesota instead. Even though Downtown Owl was a small production, the cast and crew were careful to cause as little disruption as possible.\n\n\"We were actually staying in Minneapolis, but then we traveled out to the little town where we were filming, and everybody was cool. For most small towns, it's exciting to have a film crew come in as long as they're not a bunch of idiots, not taking advantage of things and respecting the town and the people,\" Harris said. \"I don't live in a small town. Growing up, I spent some time in a small town because my parents are both from Oklahoma, and I would go out there in the summer. It's a big part of the country. Unfortunately, a lot of people in a lot of small towns put Trump into office several years ago. Hopefully, they won't do so again, but everybody was cool.\"\n\nHarris, who has worked consistently for decades, continues to find new fans as younger generations discover his catalog of work. A recent 25th anniversary celebration of The Abyss and the long-awaited 4K and Blu-ray release of director James Cameron's classic have fueled the fire of discovery. How does the acclaimed actor and filmmaker feel about being discovered again and again as \"new\" talent?\n\n\"It's fine,\" Harris laughed. \"What can I tell you? I've been doing it for a long time, and if somebody's coming along who is young and has never heard of me before is appreciating my work, that's great. The fact that they don't know who I am, that's also fine.\""
