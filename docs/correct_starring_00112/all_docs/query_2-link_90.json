        "text": "#1980s #1990s #2010s #AllPosts\n\nEd Harris is not just that man in black…\n\nBut is an actor who emerged from the background and proved his acting gift in supporting roles.\n\nWestworld (1973) is one of the best sci-fi horror movies of the 1970s. It stars James Brolin and Richard Benjamin as two men holidaying in that resort from hell. And Yul Brynner as that rogue, cowboy robot intent on killing them. This is a classic film that you would hope would be one to avoid the current TV series and film spin-off/ remake / reboot craze.\n\nBut it inevitably happened with Anthony Hopkins – doing his best Richard Attenborough in the original Jurassic Park trilogy turn – Thandiwe Newton, Tessa Thompson, Rachel Evan Wood and James Marsden in a great acting ensemble. And this cast also includes one – much Oscar-nominated yet never won – Ed Harris.\n\nAs a teen, Ed Harris is an actor I remember first seeing on the cover of the biographical book tie in of the film Sweet Dreams. Then I saw him in the biopic movie of this book as he wonderfully supported my favourite actress, Jessica Lange in her Oscar-nominated Best Actress role as Patsy Cline. Since then I’ve spotted Ed Harris in many a movie as right-hand man to some great leading stars. These usually have second billing, but always a first-rate performance. Here are just some of those supporting roles…\n\nSweet Dreams (1985)…\n\nSweet Dreams Trailer 1985, Video Detective\n\nIn this Patsy Cline film biopic, Harris appears as Charlie Dick, the love of her life until Cline’s untimely death in a plane crash. This was despite the fact that Charlie was apparently physically abusing her. Here Harris supported co-star Jessica Lange and was believable as the romantic man who swept her off her feet and in turn hurt her both emotionally and physically in their tempestuous marriage.\n\nBut despite the latter traits showing Harris’ character in a bad light, Harris still shows the depth of the love Charlie felt for his then-wife and his role’s humanity. And if Harris’ sad final scene with his character dancing alone to her music after her death, doesn’t move you then your heart is made of rock. This brings me to another of Harris’ performances.\n\nThe Rock (1996)…\n\nThe Rock – Official® Trailer [HD], TrailersPlaygroundHD\n\nThis time Ed Harris is seen as a bad guy – and this is typically the type of role that Harris often gets cast in – and as General Francis X. Hummel. Starring alongside Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery, it’s one to check out for these three actors alone. This is despite the fact that Connery sports a dodgy haircut (twice) and Cage is at his hammiest. The film is basically a hokum Michael Bay directed plot. It’s kind of a mismatched buddy film with the good guys, Connery and Cage vs the bad dude, Harris and his cronies.\n\nHarris shows his dream casting with him as the leader of a group of rogue U.S. Force Recon Marines. His character seizes control of the island of Alcatraz, where in the infamous prison my favourite Scottish actor is currently residing in this Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais role.\n\nThe rest of the script is apparently Quentin Tarantino and Cage inspired. Needless to say, it’s all harmless fun, unless you watch it with the kids. There’s a Cage love-making scene which should have been left on the cutting room floor (for more than one reason). And this film is on the Guilty Pleasures review pile. And – you have been warned – an unwritten sequel.\n\nStepmom (1998)…\n\nStepmom – Trailer, YouTube Movies\n\nHarris supports two of the most bankable actresses of the time. Harris appears in this chick-flick as the one time husband to Jackie and now fiance to a younger woman, Julia Roberts’ Isabel. With scenes showing Isabel as childless with troublesome stepkids and Jackie (Susan Sarandon) as a resentful ex-wife. Jackie inevitably warms to her just in time for that Hollywood happy ending. And this is slightly hinted at in the film poster.\n\nBasically both stepmum and mum get on much better after terminal illness threatens the life of the former Mrs Luke Harrison (Sarandon). This film has the “heartwarming” / nauseating scripted trailer, with little for Harris to do but shuffle his feet and be “dad” with two endearing child actors. But despite all the clichés and tropes, I cried like a baby when I first saw this.\n\nGeostorm (2017)…\n\nGeostorm Trailer, AMC THEATRES\n\nGeostorm is one of those movies you waited to watch on that streaming channel (if you missed seeing it on the big screen). But then wished you hadn’t seen it at all. Despite the rather cool inviting film poster. It was for the most part (which is what I saw of it) in a word awful and a waste of all the talents involved. Despite the casting of Gerard Butler, Abbie Cornish, Jim Sturges and a WTF appearance of Ed Harris.\n\nHarris appears (far too) late (on) in the movie and sadly couldn’t save this as an evil Secretary of State. Andy Garcia is the President who appeared like he did in Passengers (2016) and Mamma Mia (2018) sequel, before sleepwalking off with a cheque after his appearance.\n\nThis film with the most contrived disaster plot since 2012 (2009) but shed loads less fun was one we switched off. The by the numbers plot could have been written by a group of 10-year-old boys with a tick box of tropes to mark off as they happen. So if you must watch it do.\n\nUnbelievably this film was originally in both the 3D and IMAX formats despite its made for TV appearance. So do as they advised you in Why Don’t You (1973-95) go and “Do something more important instead”. Like, invest this running time of 1 hour and 49 minutes of Shite (with a capital S) into the below TV Series (but only the first series).\n\nWestworld (2016- )…\n\nWESTWORLD Season 1 TRAILER (2016) New HBO Series, Series Trailer MP\n\nLoved his sudden, shocking appearance here, with no spoilers. Harris is worth the wait to go “ooh it’s Ed Harris”. This is more or less what I said to Darlin Husband when seeing Harris here as… Do pay for the cost of this DVD if you don’t have access to this series as like Dynasty (2017), it’s one of those rare reboots which you’ll feel add to rather than detract from the original.\n\nFinally revisiting the Ed Harris IMDb page it appears he’s supporting yet another great Tom Cruise. This is the second (noooooooooo!) of the Top Gun movies. The film entitled Top Gun: Maverick. With this title, maverick kinda also sums up Ed Harris as this unsung hero, with those piercing blue eyes really should get more roles as Top Gun.\n\nWhat A Character Blogathon 2018, No 62\n\nThis post was added to Once Upon A Screen, Paula’s Cinema Club and Outspoken & Freckled‘s What a Character Blogathon 2018. Other reviews with these casts include Jessica Lange in All That Jazz, Tootsie and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Nicolas Cage stars in my post on Moonstruck and in another wee post on the film HERE. Sean Connery in his tribute, The Russia House and Outland Julia Roberts stars in Steel Magnolias, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, Closer and Mother’s Day. Susan Sarandon in The Witches of Eastwick."
