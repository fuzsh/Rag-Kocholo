        "text": "Fort Myers actor Rachel Burttram has been cast in the upcoming National Geographic TV series “The Right Stuff.”\n\nBurttram will play Betty Grissom, wife of astronaut Gus Grissom, in the series about the early days of the U.S. space program, according to the show’s IMDb page. The series is expected to debut sometime next year.\n\n“The Right Stuff” is based on Tom Wolfe’s bestselling 1979 book, which was previously adapted into a 1983 feature movie starring Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn and Ed Harris.\n\nBoth Burttram and the TV show’s publicist declined to comment about \"The Right Stuff\" and Burttram’s casting, saying they wanted to wait and do interviews closer to the show’s launch. However, both the show’s IMDb and Wikipedia pages confirm she’s acting in the one-hour TV drama.\n\n'Hamilton' and a whole lot more: Theater season in Southwest Florida: Your guide to 'Hamilton' and everything else happening onstage in 2019-20\n\nBurttram has been posting updates on Facebook about her involvement, too. “There are no words really to describe my enthusiasm,” she wrote Aug. 5. “We are about to take one heck of a ride. Lift off ...”\n\nProduction has already started on the show developed by actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way Productions.\n\nAccording to a February news release from National Geographic, the show will tell the story of U.S. fighter pilots recruited to test experimental aircraft and later become the first Mercury astronauts.\n\n“The Right Stuff is about a moment when the country looked in the same direction to achieve the stuff of fantasy, and on a timeline that was nearly impossible,” executive producer and showrunner Mark Lafferty said in the news release. “The story is a reminder of what we’re capable of, but it also shows how much we’ve changed and diversified over time.\n\n“National Geographic is the perfect home to showcase the ambitious and colorful characters at the center of this pioneering era.”\n\nBurttram is a familiar face to Fort Myers theater lovers and has appeared onstage at both Florida Repertory Theatre and Theatre Conspiracy.\n\nActor Michael Trotter will play Betty Grissom's husband, astronaut Gus Grissom, in \"The Right Stuff.\" The rest of the cast includes Colin O’Donoghue as Gordon Cooper, Patrick J. Adams as John Glenn, and Jake McDorman as Alan Shepard.\n\nConnect with this reporter: Charles Runnells (Facebook), @charlesrunnells (Twitter), @crunnells1 (Instagram)\n\nMore: Things to do in Fort Myers, Naples area: Punta Gorda Woodstock, Josh Ward, Love That Dress, etc.\n\nAnd: Live music in Fort Myers, Cape Coral: Punta Gorda Woodstock, Artimus Pyle and more"
