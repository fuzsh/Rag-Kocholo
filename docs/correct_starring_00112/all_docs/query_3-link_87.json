        "text": "Husband and wife Ed Harris (The Truman Show, Apollo 13, Westworld) and Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams, Gone Baby Gone, Grey’s Anatomy) are set to star in the indie murder drama School For the Blind. Director Lou Howe is on board to helm from his adaptation of Dennis McFarland’s critically acclaimed 1995 novel.\n\nDeadline reports the following synopsis:\n\nIn School for the Blind, Harris and Madigan play siblings with a dark past riddled with unresolved family issues. Harris is a world-weary war correspondent who returns to the small town of his youth to reunite with his sister, a librarian at the local school for blind children. Together they confront these issues as they strive to solve the cold case murder of a blind student who disappeared years before.\n\nThis sounds like a really interesting story, and these two actors are fantastic, so I’m definitely looking forward to seeing this film. I can’t believe I didn’t know before, or maybe I forgot, that they were married, but the pair have been together since 1983, and have appeared in several films together including Gone Baby Gone, Places in the Heart, Alamo Bay, The Last Full Measure, The Rules Don’t Apply, Sweetwater, Riders of the Purple Saga, and the Harris-directed Oscar-winning Pollock.\n\nThey will also star in The Ploughman, directed by Harris, which is also currently in pre-production."
