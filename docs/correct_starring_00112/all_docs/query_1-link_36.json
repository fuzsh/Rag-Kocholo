        "text": "In a nutshell, Bored & Dangerous says: “Basically a commercial for America.”\n\n“The first American into space is not going to be a chimpanzee. I want test pilots!”\n\nThese days when the Cold War is used as the backdrop for a movie, it generally comes with a healthy level of cynicism. There are rarely clear cut good guys or bad guys, and the paranoia and corruption of leaders on both sides are fair game. But in 1983, the Berlin Wall was still up, the USSR was still a thing we were told to be wary of, and America was in the grips of conservative renaissance under the leadership of limited actor and A-grade prick, Ronald Reagan. In 1983, it was still a time when a movie about the space race was all flag waving, back patting and star spangled. It was a time when they made movies like The Right Stuff.\n\nAfter several attempts to break the sound barrier end in fiery explosions, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard) steps up to the plate and he gets the job done in 1947. Over the next few years, Yeager and best friend/rival Scott Crossfield (Scott Wilson) repeatedly beat each other’s air speed records. At first top secret, the government decides to start publishing their efforts as a way of building national morale, and pressuring congress into giving them more money.\n\nWith the sound barrier well and truly defeated, the Americans set their sights on going where no man has gone before. And since the Ruskies have the same idea, the space race is born as the Yanks and Russians scramble to be the first to put a man in space. While Yeager is immediately disqualified due to his lack of college education, several of his test pilot friends are chosen to train as America’s first astronauts, along with Marine hero, John Glenn (Ed Harris).\n\nWhen I described The Right Stuff as, “all flag waving, back patting and star spangled” in my intro to this review, it probably sounded a bit pissy and derogatory. But that’s not how I meant it. Because while its patriotism is a little on the nose, it never stops the movie from being undeniably uplifting. It’s the kind of movie where I can feel exactly how and when it’s manipulating me, without that ever becoming a problem.\n\nThe Right Stuff is basically a commercial for America. It’s about American ingenuity, American spirit, American drive and determination. And it’s the kind of story that can actually hold up under that sort of corny weight. It’s a fist pump of a movie, filled with characters that are easy to see as modern heroes. It’s pure puff, but at least it’s entertaining puff.\n\nThe Right Stuff\n\nDirected By – Philip Kaufman\n\nWritten By – Philip Kaufman"
