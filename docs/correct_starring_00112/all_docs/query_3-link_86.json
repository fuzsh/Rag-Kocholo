        "text": "TWO-TIME GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD® WINNER\n\nED HARRIS\n\nRETURNS TO BROADWAY\n\nAFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES\n\nTO PLAY ATTICUS FINCH\n\nIN\n\nHARPER LEE’S\n\n“TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD”\n\nA NEW PLAY BY AARON SORKIN\n\nProducer Scott Rudin announced today that two-time Golden Globe Award winner Ed Harris will play the iconic character of Atticus Finch in the Broadway production of To Kill a Mockingbird, Aaron Sorkin’s new play, directed by Bartlett Sher, and based on Harper Lee’s classic novel, beginning Tuesday, November 5. 2019 Tony Award nominee Jeff Daniels’ final performance will be on Sunday, November 3, after a full year with the record-breaking production.\n\nOne of the most celebrated actors of his or any generation, Ed Harris has received four Academy Award nominations and created indelible performances in such films as Pollock, Apollo 13, The Truman Show, and The Hours among many others, distinguishing him as one of the truly iconic figures in American film history. He is currently reprising his acclaimed, Emmy nominated role in the HBO series, “Westworld,” and won a Golden Globe for his performance as Senator John McCain in HBO’s “Game Change.” Now, he takes on Atticus Finch — the most iconic character in the American literary cannon — in what is sure to be a landmark event of the new Broadway season. Mr. Harris made his Broadway debut in 1986, in his Tony Award-nominated, starring role in Precious Sons. He has won Drama Desk, Obie and Lucille Lortel Awards and received Tony nominations for his riveting stage performances over the years. To Kill a Mockingbird will mark his welcome return to New York, his first time on Broadway since 1993.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird holds the title of the highest grossing American play in Broadway history and continues to shatter its own box office record time and time again. Since performances began on Thursday, November 1, 2018, To Kill a Mockingbird has not played to an empty seat, with capacity being at 100% or greater for every performance.\n\nSet in Alabama in 1934, Harper Lee’s enduring story of racial injustice and childhood innocence centers on one of the most venerated characters in American literature, the small-town lawyer Atticus Finch, played by Harris. The cast of characters includes Atticus’s daughter Scout (2019 Tony Award winner Celia Keenan-Bolger), her brother Jem (Will Pullen), their housekeeper and caretaker, Calpurnia (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), their visiting friend Dill (Gideon Glick), and a mysterious neighbor, the reclusive Arthur “Boo” Radley (Danny Wolohan). The other indelible residents of Maycomb, Alabama are brought to life on stage by Frederick Weller (as Bob Ewell), Gbenga Akinnagbe (playing Tom Robinson), Stark Sands (as prosecutor Horace Gilmer), Dakin Matthews (playing Judge Taylor), and Erin Wilhelmi (as Mayella Ewell).\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nEd Harris (Atticus Finch) stars as the enigmatic Man in Black in the HBO series sensation, “Westworld” (Emmy Award nomination) and will reprise his role in the upcoming third season.
