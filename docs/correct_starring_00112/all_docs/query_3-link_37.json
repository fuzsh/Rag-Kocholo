        "text": "Ed Harris is undoubtedly one of the best actors in Hollywood, who played versatile characters exceptionally well. In his 70s, the actor remains active in the industry. Here are some of Ed Harris's movies that are worth watching.\n\n\"Westworld\" season 4 trailer had fans excited with the least expected surprises since the last season finale premiered.\n\nThe last viewers saw of William, otherwise known as the Man in Black (Ed Harris), he was being murdered by his doppelganger.\n\nHowever, it seems William is still alive and sticking around for Season 4. Harris is undoubtedly one of the actors who had fans hooked to the series, as he did in many other on-screen productions he starred in.\n\nED HARRIS'S MOST FAMOUS MOVIES\n\nHarris famously starred in \"The Truman Show\" alongside Jim Carrey. The film centered on Carrey's character, a man living in a perfect world who just wants to find a way out. It turned out he was the star of a famous television show that documented his whole life.\n\nThe man behind the series was none other than Harris's character. Harris's performance in the movie brought him positive reviews and an Oscar nomination under his belt.\n\nAmy Madigan and Ed Harris arive at \"A History of Violence\" Los Angeles Premiere at Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles, California, United States. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe same could be said for his role in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" where Harris stars as a government recruiter who taps Josh Nash (Russell Crowe) as a codebreaker. Harris's performance significantly contributed to the film's Oscar Award-winning success.\n\nHarris also starred in the drama \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" where he worked with some of the best Hollywood stars, including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin.\n\nHis first taste of a big success was when he received his first Oscar nomination for \"Apollo 13.\" Unlike his other films, \"Apollo 13\" gave Harris a new role as a NASA officer whose job was bringing the crew home safely. He joined the stellar cast that included Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon.\n\n\"The Rock\" was one of Harris's rare action films, where he plays a rogue military official. Although it went without any accolades, the movie received high praises from critics.\n\nED HARRIS'S MOST RECENT ROLE IN \"TOP GUN: MAVERICK\"\n\nMost recently, Harris starred in the highly-anticipated and critically acclaimed sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" alongside Tom Cruise, who reprised his role from the original film.\n\nAt 71, Harris brought life to the character of Rear admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain, showing his powerful and intimidating stance in the Air Force. In one of his scenes, Harris absorbed the pressure from a jet passing below the usual path.\n\nThe actor needed no stunt double for the scene as he remained unshaken while the rest of the set took in damages. Harris shared:\n\n\"It blew the roof off the guard station. It was a fun scene with the jet roaring over my head. I was just holding my ground, knowing what to expect. It's really impressive seeing this jet coming at you from so far away and just flying right over your head.\"\n\nED HARRIS IN \"WESTWORLD\"\n\nHarris also plays a tough character in \"Westworld,\" where he is supposed to be a heartless killer. Although it is no character to admire, Harris's performance makes people feel strongly about the Man in Black.\n\nThe storyline for his character may confuse some viewers, but Harris projects the main themes well, making the Man in Black an even more compelling character.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwam1paHqmsIyhmKuqmah6rrvVopysZaSdrrV5wKucZq%2Bfp8Gpedaaq5ygmaO0b7TTpqM%3D"
