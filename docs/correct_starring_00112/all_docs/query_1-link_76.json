        "text": "Rachel Burttram has been preparing for this role since at least elementary school.\n\nThe Fort Myers actor grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, just down the interstate from Huntsville and NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. One year, she wrote a poem for a school contest — and ended up winning a $100 savings bond.\n\nThe topic? How she wanted to be an astronaut one day.\n\n“Isn’t that funny!” Burttram says and laughs.\n\nHere’s why that’s so funny: Years later, Burttram now co-stars in the new TV series “The Right Stuff,” premiering Friday on Disney+.\n\nShe doesn’t play an astronaut, but it’s close enough. She plays astronaut’s wife Betty Grissom.\n\nThe role lands Burttram on the national stage after years of performing at Fort Myers theater companies Theatre Conspiracy and Florida Repertory Theatre.\n\n“I’m totally excited,” Burttram says. “It’s by far the biggest (exposure) I’ve had.”\n\nRead more: Fort Myers actor cast in National Geographic’s 'The Right Stuff'\n\n“The Right Stuff” follows the early days of the U.S. space program, its astronauts and their families. It’s based on Tom Wolfe’s bestselling 1979 book, previously adapted into a 1983 feature movie starring Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn and Ed Harris.\n\nBurttram — a big fan of both the book and the movie — plays astronaut Gus Grissom’s wife. The real Betty Grissom died in 2018.\n\n“Betty is really something else,” Burttram says. “Betty was probably authentic before authentic was cool. ... She just sort of said what she thought.\n\n“The wives really liked Betty. She was a sweet person, even though she was spunky and sassy.”\n\nThat sassiness continued even after the astronauts and their families got thrust into the national spotlight during the Project Mercury program in the late 1950s.\n\n“That must have been incredibly overwhelming,” Burttram says. “I mean, Betty grew up kind of in the country with chickens and pigs.\n\n\"She put Gus through school. They were in Indiana, and she worked the night shift as a telephone operator so that Gus could go through engineering school.”\n\nThe eight-episode series focuses mostly on the astronauts, says the show’s executive producer, Jennifer Davisson. But their wives are a crucial part of the story, too.\n\n“We really want to understand the psychology of what makes a test pilot and then what makes a man believe he can go to space,” Davisson says. “And the effects that that has on him and on the people around him.”\n\nDavisson says she knew right away that Burttram was perfect to play Betty. She doesn’t remember how many actors she saw for the part, but she knows everything stopped with Burttram.\n\n“She’s just really, undeniably talented,” Davisson says. “That was very, very clear. &mldr; She stood out. When we saw her, we knew.”\n\nThen there’s Burttram’s interaction with actor Michael Trotter, who plays Gus Grissom.\n\n“Gus and Betty had this really wonderful, wonderful interplay with each other that was equal parts aggravation and just supreme affection,” Davisson says. “And she just nailed that.\n\n“She has such wonderful chemistry with Michael Trotter. So she really was kind of an undeniable choice for us.”\n\nMore: No show: Florida Rep cancels 2020-21 season because of coronavirus pandemic\n\nBurttram and the rest of “The Right Stuff” cast shot the series over four months last year along Florida’s Space Coast, in the Orlando area and elsewhere.\n\nBurttram was excited to be working with the cast and especially its directors — many of whom have directed some of her favorite TV series, including the Netflix hit “Ozark.”\n\n“I felt so lucky,” she says. “They just made me feel like I belonged there and like I was really a part of the team.”\n\nBurttram says she loved the show’s writing and the fact that it’s a period piece with its 1950s costumes, cars and locations.\n\n“I have said it more than once on set: 'Don’t you feel like we’re time traveling?’” she says and laughs. “Because it really is, like, holy moly! This could really be 1959!”\n\nBurttram hopes to return to the series for season 2. And producer Davisson says that’ll definitely happen if the show gets picked up again.\n\n“Obviously, Gus Grissom, his flight is a very important one,” Davisson says. “It would be impossible to tell his story without her.”\n\nSeason one follows the astronauts' early career as test pilots and just the very beginning of Project Mercury, Davisson says. “So we still have a lot to cover going into a hopeful season 2.”\n\n“The Right Stuff” was originally scheduled to debut on Nat Geo, but that premiere moved to Disney+ in May. The show was produced for National Geographic by Leonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way Productions and Warner Bros. Television.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes Colin O’Donoghue (Gordon Cooper), Eloise Mumford (Trudy Cooper), Patrick J. Adams (John Glenn), Jake McDorman (Alan Shepard), Shannon Lucio (Louise Shepard) and James Lafferty (Scott Carpenter).\n\nThe first two episodes premiere Friday on Disney+.
