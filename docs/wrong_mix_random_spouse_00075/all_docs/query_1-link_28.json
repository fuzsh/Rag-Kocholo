Essentially Dartmouth's athletics hall of fame, “Wearers” was created in 1984 to honor students, alumni, and coaches for athletic excellence in their respective sports, including Olympians, All-Americans, national champions, major league professionals and other exceptional forms of recognition. Nearly 1,500 members have been inducted over the last three decades; every one is listed below (sortable by name, sport, class year or induction year) and a list of Wearers by criteria met is also available.\n\nExplore every current Wearer below, plus see the links to the left for information on the history, format and criteria, as well as the most recent class and their itinerary for Homecoming weekend. The celebration of the newest Wearers includes recognition on the field during the football game, then culminates with their formal induction at the Top of the Hop following the game.\n\nQualified students and alumni are eligible for induction five years after their class has graduated, while qualified coaches are eligible for induction after they leave the college. Induction of varsity sport qualifiers alternates every other year with the qualifiers in club sports, masters and other sports.\n\nSince 1994, select individuals have also been inducted as Honorary Wearers of the Green (noted by an H beside their name) for making exceptionally generous contributions of time and/or financial resources that have made a significant impact on the College's athletic programs."
