        "text": "Dearest ArtsEmerson Friends,\n\nWelcome to the ArtsEmerson 24-25 Season! We are starting off our 14th year a little earlier than usual with an extra special piece, Rough Magic. Written and performed by Christopher Rivas and co-starring Annie Gonzalez, Rough Magic is a deeply intimate portrait on love and human connection. This piece is just one part of a larger tapestry of work, and we are thrilled to be able to support it in its initial run here in Boston.\n\nOf course, many of you may remember the wonderful Christopher Rivas from last season’s The Real James Bond…Was Dominican. Chris and his entire team was such a joy to work with because they hold our shared values of uplifting art that prompts conversation and connects us across difference. During his time here, our team and countless community partners were grateful to develop such a strong artistic relationship with Chris that we knew we needed to welcome him back as soon as possible. We are grateful as well to BrownEnough Productions, Parker Morrison Productions, and IKIGAI Management & Media for their partnership.\n\nAs we embark on another historic season here at ArtsEmerson, we are of course immensely grateful to our community for supporting artists who unapologetically challenge the dominant narrative and reflect the rich diversity of our city. We could not do this without you- thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRonee Penoi\n\nInterim Executive Director of the Office of the Arts and ArtsEmerson, Director of Artistic Programming\n\nChristopher Rivas is quickly becoming one of the most sought after multi-hyphenates as an actor, author, podcaster, playwright, and storyteller. His critically acclaimed debut book, Brown Enough, explores what it means to be Brown in America. The book is part memoir and part social commentary, a roller coaster of finding one’s true self while simultaneously having a racial awakening amidst the struggle to be “perfectly” Latinx, woke, and as Brown as possible to make it in today’s America. His next book, You’re a Good Swimmer is a children’s book that’s due out July 16, 2024. He’s also the host and executive producer of two podcasts with SiriusXM’s Stitcher: Brown Enough, which explores the parallel themes of this book through interview-style episodes; and Rubirosa, a 10-episode documentary-style investigation of Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican diplomat, race car driver, soldier and polo player who’s believed to be the inspiration for the famous character ‘James Bond’. On screen, Rivas is known for his work on the Fox series, Call Me Kat, opposite Mayim Bialik.\n\nAnnie Gonzalez is a producer, activist, and performer, who works to support immigration rights, educational equity, and the arts.
