One previous case study has linked FAM177A1 to a neurodevelopmental disorder in four siblings.We identified five individuals from three unrelated families with biallelic variants in FAM177A1. The physiological function of FAM177A1 was studied in a zebrafish model organism and human cell lines with loss-of-function variants similar to the affected cohort.These individuals share a characteristic phenotype defined by macrocephaly, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral abnormalities, hypotonia, and gait disturbance. We show that FAM177A1 localizes to the Golgi complex in mammalian and zebrafish cells. Intersection of the RNA-seq and metabolomic datasets from FAM177A1-deficient human fibroblasts and whole zebrafish larvae demonstrated dysregulation of pathways associated with apoptosis, inflammation, and negative regulation of cell proliferation.Our data sheds light on the emerging function of FAM177A1 and defines FAM177A1-related neurodevelopmental disorder as a new clinical entity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.gim.2024.101166\n\nView details for PubMedID 38767059\n\nAbstract\n\nEndurance exercise training is known to reduce risk for a range of complex diseases. However, the molecular basis of this effect has been challenging to study and largely restricted to analyses of either few or easily biopsied tissues. Extensive transcriptome data collected across 15 tissues during exercise training in rats as part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium has provided a unique opportunity to clarify how exercise can affect tissue-specific gene expression and further suggest how exercise adaptation may impact complex disease-associated genes. To build this map, we integrate this multi-tissue atlas of gene expression changes with gene-disease targets, genetic regulation of expression, and trait relationship data in humans. Consensus from multiple approaches prioritizes specific tissues and genes where endurance exercise impacts disease-relevant gene expression. Specifically, we identify a total of 5523 trait-tissue-gene triplets to serve as a valuable starting point for future investigations [Exercise; Transcription; Human Phenotypic Variation].\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-024-45966-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 38693125\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have developed the regional principal components (rPCs) method, a novel approach for summarizing gene-level methylation. rPCs address the challenge of deciphering complex epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast to traditional averaging, rPCs leverage principal components analysis to capture complex methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method demonstrated a 54% improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, offering a robust framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. Applying rPCs to the AD brain methylation data in ROSMAP, combined with cell type deconvolution, we uncovered 838 differentially methylated genes associated with neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods. Integrating methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 17 genes with potential causal roles in AD, including MS4A4A and PICALM. Our approach is available in the Bioconductor package regionalpcs, opening avenues for research and facilitating a deeper understanding of the epigenetic landscape in complex diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.05.01.590171\n\nView details for PubMedID 38746367\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11092597\n\nAbstract\n\nRegular exercise promotes whole-body health and prevents disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood1-3. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium4 profiled the temporal transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, phosphoproteome, acetylproteome, ubiquitylproteome, epigenome and immunome in whole blood, plasma and 18 solid tissues in male and female Rattus norvegicus over eight weeks of endurance exercise training. The resulting data compendium encompasses 9,466 assays across 19 tissues, 25 molecular platforms and 4 training time points. Thousands of shared and tissue-specific molecular alterations were identified, with sex differences found in multiple tissues. Temporal multi-omic and multi-tissue analyses revealed expansive biological insights into the adaptive responses to endurance training, including widespread regulation of immune, metabolic, stress response and mitochondrial pathways. Many changes were relevant to human health, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular health and tissue injury and recovery. The data and analyses presented in this study will serve as valuable resources for understanding and exploring the multi-tissue molecular effects of endurance training and are provided in a public repository ( https://motrpac-data.org/ ).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-023-06877-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 38693412\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11062907\n\nAbstract\n\nSubcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) is a dynamic storage and secretory organ that regulates systemic homeostasis, yet the impact of endurance exercise training (ExT) and sex on its molecular landscape is not fully established. Utilizing an integrative multi-omics approach, and leveraging data generated by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), we show profound sexual dimorphism in the scWAT of sedentary rats and in the dynamic response of this tissue to ExT. Specifically, the scWAT of sedentary females displays -omic signatures related to insulin signaling and adipogenesis, whereas the scWAT of sedentary males is enriched in terms related to aerobic metabolism. These sex-specific -omic signatures are preserved or amplified with ExT. Integration of multi-omic analyses with phenotypic measures identifies molecular hubs predicted to drive sexually distinct responses to training. Overall, this study underscores the powerful impact of sex on adipose tissue biology and provides a rich resource to investigate the scWAT response to ExT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s42255-023-00959-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 38693320\n\nAbstract\n\nRegular exercise has many physical and brain health benefits, yet the molecular mechanisms mediating exercise effects across tissues remain poorly understood. Here we analyzed 400 high-quality DNA methylation, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq datasets from eight tissues from control and endurance exercise-trained (EET) rats. Integration of baseline datasets mapped the gene location dependence of epigenetic control features and identified differing regulatory landscapes in each tissue. The transcriptional responses to 8weeks of EET showed little overlap across tissues and predominantly comprised tissue-type enriched genes. We identified sex differences in the transcriptomic and epigenomic changes induced by EET. However, the sex-biased gene responses were linked to shared signaling pathways. We found that many G protein-coupled receptor-encoding genes are regulated by EET, suggesting a role for these receptors in mediating the molecular adaptations to training across tissues. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying EET-induced health benefits across organs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100421\n\nView details for PubMedID 38697122\n\nAbstract\n\nMitochondria have diverse functions critical to whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Endurance training alters mitochondrial activity, but systematic characterization of these adaptations is lacking. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium mapped the temporal, multi-omic changes in mitochondrial analytes across 19 tissues in male and female rats trained for 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Training elicited substantial changes in the adrenal gland, brown adipose, colon, heart, and skeletal muscle. The colon showed non-linear response dynamics, whereas mitochondrial pathways were downregulated in brown adipose and adrenal tissues. Protein acetylation increased in the liver, with a shift in lipid metabolism, whereas oxidative proteins increased in striated muscles. Exercise-upregulated networks were downregulated in human diabetes and cirrhosis. Knockdown of the central network protein 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 10 (HSD17B10) elevated oxygen consumption, indicative of metabolic stress. We provide a multi-omic, multi-tissue, temporal atlas of the mitochondrial response to exercise training and identify candidates linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cmet.2023.12.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 38701776\n\nAbstract\n\nAround 60% of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) remain undiagnosed after comprehensive genetic testing, primarily of protein-coding genes1. Increasingly, large genome-sequenced cohorts are improving our ability to discover new diagnoses in the non-coding genome. Here, we identify the non-coding RNA RNU4-2 as a novel syndromic NDD gene. RNU4-2 encodes the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is a critical component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex of the major spliceosome2. We identify an 18 bp region of RNU4-2 mapping to two structural elements in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex (the T-loop and Stem III) that is severely depleted of variation in the general population, but in which we identify heterozygous variants in 119 individuals with NDD. The vast majority of individuals (77.3%) have the same highly recurrent single base-pair insertion (n.64_65insT). We estimate that variants in this region explain 0.41% of individuals with NDD. We demonstrate that RNU4-2 is highly expressed in the developing human brain, in contrast to its contiguous counterpart RNU4-1 and other U4 homologs, supporting RNU4-2's role as the primary U4 transcript in the brain. Overall, this work underscores the importance of non-coding genes in rare disorders. It will provide a diagnosis to thousands of individuals with NDD worldwide and pave the way for the development of effective treatments for these individuals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.04.07.24305438\n\nView details for PubMedID 38645094\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11030480\n\nAbstract\n\nRare structural variants (SVs) - insertions, deletions, and complex rearrangements - can cause Mendelian disease, yet they remain difficult to accurately detect and interpret. We sequenced and analyzed Oxford Nanopore long-read genomes of 68 individuals from the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) with no previously identified diagnostic mutations from short-read sequencing. Using our optimized SV detection pipelines and 571 control long-read genomes, we detected 716 long-read rare (MAF < 0.01) SV alleles per genome on average, achieving a 2.4x increase from short-reads. To characterize the functional effects of rare SVs, we assessed their relationship with gene expression from blood or fibroblasts from the same individuals, and found that rare SVs overlapping enhancers were enriched (LOR = 0.46) near expression outliers. We also evaluated tandem repeat expansions (TREs) and found 14 rare TREs per genome; notably these TREs were also enriched near overexpression outliers. To prioritize candidate functional SVs, we developed Watershed-SV, a probabilistic model that integrates expression data with SV-specific genomic annotations, which significantly outperforms baseline models that don't incorporate expression data. Watershed-SV identified a median of eight high-confidence functional SVs per UDN genome. Notably, this included compound heterozygous deletions in FAM177A1 shared by two siblings, which were likely causal for a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Our observations demonstrate the promise of integrating long-read sequencing with gene expression towards improving the prioritization of functional SVs and TREs in rare disease patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.03.22.24304565\n\nView details for PubMedID 38585781\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10996727\n\nAbstract\n\nLess than half of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition receive a precise molecular diagnosis after comprehensive clinical genetic testing. Improvements in data quality and costs have heightened interest in using long-read sequencing (LRS) to streamline clinical genomic testing, but the absence of control datasets for variant filtering and prioritization has made tertiary analysis of LRS data challenging. To address this, the 1000 Genomes Project ONT Sequencing Consortium aims to generate LRS data from at least 800 of the 1000 Genomes Project samples. Our goal is to use LRS to identify a broader spectrum of variation so we may improve our understanding of normal patterns of human variation. Here, we present data from analysis of the first 100 samples, representing all 5 superpopulations and 19 subpopulations. These samples, sequenced to an average depth of coverage of 37x and sequence read N50 of 54 kbp, have high concordance with previous studies for identifying single nucleotide and indel variants outside of homopolymer regions. Using multiple structural variant (SV) callers, we identify an average of 24,543 high-confidence SVs per genome, including shared and private SVs likely to disrupt gene function as well as pathogenic expansions within disease-associated repeats that were not detected using short reads. Evaluation of methylation signatures revealed expected patterns at known imprinted loci, samples with skewed X-inactivation patterns, and novel differentially methylated regions. All raw sequencing data, processed data, and summary statistics are publicly available, providing a valuable resource for the clinical genetics community to discover pathogenic SVs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.03.05.24303792\n\nView details for PubMedID 38496498\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10942501\n\nAbstract\n\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables the accurate measurement of multiple transcriptomic phenotypes for modeling the impacts of disease variants. Advances in technologies, experimental protocols, and analysis strategies are rapidly expanding the application of RNA-seq to identify disease biomarkers, tissue- and cell-type-specific impacts, and the spatial localization of disease-associated mechanisms. Ongoing international efforts to construct biobank-scale transcriptomic repositories with matched genomic data across diverse population groups are further increasing the utility of RNA-seq approaches by providing large-scale normative reference resources. The availability of these resources, combined with improved computational analysis pipelines, has enabled the detection of aberrant transcriptomic phenotypes underlying rare diseases. Further expansion of these resources, across both somatic and developmental tissues, is expected to soon provide unprecedented insights to resolve disease origin, mechanism of action, and causal gene contributions, suggesting the continued high utility of RNA-seq in disease diagnosis. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, Volume 25 is August 2024.

Prior studies have demonstrated that choice of genome build impacts variant interpretation and diagnostic yield for genomic analyses. To identify the extent genome build also impacts transcriptomics analyses, we studied the effect of the hg19, hg38, and CHM13 genome builds on expression quantification and outlier detection in 386 rare disease and familial control samples from both the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) and Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Disease (GREGoR) Consortium. We identified 2,800 genes with build-dependent quantification across six routinely-collected biospecimens, including 1,391 protein-coding genes and 341 known rare disease genes. We further observed multiple genes that only have detectable expression in a subset of genome builds. Finally, we characterized how genome build impacts the detection of outlier transcriptomic events. Combined, we provide a database of genes impacted by build choice, and recommend that transcriptomics-guided analyses and diagnoses are cross-referenced with these data for robustness.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301165\n\nView details for PubMedID 38260490\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10802764\n\nAbstract\n\nCardiac blood flow is a critical determinant of human health. However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41588-023-01587-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 38082205\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 7612636\n\nAbstract\n\nAnimal studies show aging varies between individuals as well as between organs within an individual1-4, but whether this is true in humans and its effect on age-related diseases is unknown. We utilized levels of human blood plasma proteins originating from specific organs to measure organ-specific aging differences in living individuals. Using machine learning models, we analysed aging in 11 major organs and estimated organ age reproducibly in five independent cohorts encompassing 5,676 adults across the human lifespan. We discovered nearly 20% of the population show strongly accelerated age in one organ and 1.7% are multi-organ agers. Accelerated organ aging confers 20-50% higher mortality risk, and organ-specific diseases relate to faster aging of those organs. We find individuals with accelerated heart aging have a 250% increased heart failure risk and accelerated brain and vascular aging predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression independently from and as strongly as plasma pTau-181 (ref. 5), the current best blood-based biomarker for AD. Our models link vascular calcification, extracellular matrix alterations and synaptic protein shedding to early cognitive decline. We introduce a simple and interpretable method to study organ aging using plasma proteomics data, predicting diseases and aging effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-023-06802-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 38057571\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10700136\n\nAbstract\n\nMapping the functional human genome and impact of genetic variants is often limited to European-descendent population samples. To aid in overcoming this limitation, we measured gene expression using RNA sequencing in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 599 individuals from six African populations to identify novel transcripts including those not represented in the hg38 reference genome. We used whole genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 164 Maasai individuals to identify 8,881 expression and 6,949 splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTLs/sQTLs), and 2,611 structural variants associated with gene expression (SV-eQTLs). We further profiled chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in a subset of 100 representative individuals, to identity chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs) and allele-specific chromatin accessibility, and provide predictions for the functional effect of 78.9 million variants on chromatin accessibility. Using this map of eQTLs and caQTLs we fine-mapped GWAS signals for a range of complex diseases. Combined, this work expands global functional genomic data to identify novel transcripts, functional elements and variants, understand population genetic history of molecular quantitative trait loci, and further resolve the genetic basis of multiple human traits and disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.11.04.564839\n\nView details for PubMedID 37986808\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10659267\n\nAbstract\n\nEach human genome has tens of thousands of rare genetic variants; however, identifying impactful rare variants remains a major challenge. We demonstrate how use of personal multi-omics can enable identification of impactful rare variants by using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which included several hundred individuals, with whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomes, methylomes, and proteomes collected across two time points, 10 years apart. We evaluated each multi-omics phenotype's ability to separately and jointly inform functional rare variation. By combining expression and protein data, we observed rare stop variants 62 times and rare frameshift variants 216 times as frequently as controls, compared to 13-27 times as frequently for expression or protein effects alone. We extended a Bayesian hierarchical model, \"Watershed,\" to prioritize specific rare variants underlying multi-omics signals across the regulatory cascade. With this approach, we identified rare variants that exhibited large effect sizes on multiple complex traits including height, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100401\n\nView details for PubMedID 37868038\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10589633\n\nAbstract\n\nEndurance exercise is an important health modifier. We studied cell-type specific adaptations of human skeletal muscle to acute endurance exercise using single-nucleus (sn) multiome sequencing in human vastus lateralis samples collected before and 3.5 hours after 40 min exercise at 70% VO2max in four subjects, as well as in matched time of day samples from two supine resting circadian controls. High quality same-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were obtained from 37,154 nuclei comprising 14 cell types. Among muscle fiber types, both shared and fiber-type specific regulatory programs were identified. Single-cell circuit analysis identified distinct adaptations in fast, slow and intermediate fibers as well as LUM-expressing FAP cells, involving a total of 328 transcription factors (TFs) acting at altered accessibility sites regulating 2,025 genes. These data and circuit mapping provide single-cell insight into the processes underlying tissue and metabolic remodeling responses to exercise.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.09.26.558914\n\nView details for PubMedID 37808658\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10557702\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing (ES), more than 50% of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition lack a precise molecular diagnosis.

The current diagnostic rate reflects multiple factors, including technical limitations, incomplete understanding of variant pathogenicity, missing genotype-phenotype associations, complex gene-environment interactions, and reporting differences between clinical labs. Maintaining a clear understanding of the rapidly evolving landscape of diagnostic tests beyond ES, and their limitations, presents a challenge for non-genetics professionals. Newer tests, such as short-read genome or RNA sequencing, can be challenging to order, and emerging technologies, such as optical genome mapping and long-read DNA sequencing, are not available clinically. Furthermore, there is no clear guidance on the next best steps after inconclusive evaluation. Here, we review why a clinical genetic evaluation may be negative, discuss questions to be asked in this setting, and provide a framework for further investigation, including the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches that are nascent in the clinical sphere.

Here, given the disproportionate HIV-1 burden and marked human genome diversity in Africa2, we assessed the genetic determinants of control of set-point viral load in 3,879 people of African ancestries living with HIV-1 participating in the international collaboration for the genomics of HIV3. We identify a previously undescribed association signal on chromosome 1 where the peak variant associates with an approximately 0.3 log10-transformed copies per ml lower set-point viral load per minor allele copy and is specific to populations of African descent. The top associated variant is intergenic and lies between a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC00624) and the coding gene CHD1L, which encodes a helicase that is involved in DNA repair4. Infection assays in iPS cell-derived macrophages and other immortalized cell lines showed increased HIV-1 replication in CHD1L-knockdown and CHD1L-knockout cells. We provide evidence from population genetic studies that Africa-specific genetic variation near CHD1L associates with HIV replication in vivo. Although experimental studies suggest that CHD1L is able to limit HIV infection in some cell types in vitro, further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms underlying our observations, including any potential indirect effects of CHD1L on HIV spread in vivo that our cell-based assays cannot recapitulate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-023-06370-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 37532928\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 3723635\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing (ES), more than 50% of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition lack a precise molecular diagnosis.

While chronic endurance exercise training is known to alter mitochondrial activity, these adaptations have not yet been systematically characterized. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) mapped the longitudinal, multi-omic changes in mitochondrial analytes across 19 tissues in male and female rats endurance trained for 1, 2, 4 or 8 weeks. Training elicited substantial changes in the adrenal gland, brown adipose, colon, heart and skeletal muscle, while we detected mild responses in the brain, lung, small intestine and testes. The colon response was characterized by non-linear dynamics that resulted in upregulation of mitochondrial function that was more prominent in females. Brown adipose and adrenal tissues were characterized by substantial downregulation of mitochondrial pathways. Training induced a previously unrecognized robust upregulation of mitochondrial protein abundance and acetylation in the liver, and a concomitant shift in lipid metabolism. The striated muscles demonstrated a highly coordinated response to increase oxidative capacity, with the majority of changes occurring in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. We identified exercise upregulated networks that are downregulated in human type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis. In both cases HSD17B10, a central dehydrogenase in multiple metabolic pathways and mitochondrial tRNA maturation, was the main hub. In summary, we provide a multi-omic, cross-tissue atlas of the mitochondrial response to training and identify candidates for prevention of disease-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/2023.01.13.523698\n\nView details for PubMedID 36711881\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9882193\n\nAbstract\n\nTranscription factors (TFs) play a key role in regulating gene expression and responses to stimuli. We conducted an integrated analysis of chromatin accessibility and RNA expression across various rat tissues following endurance exercise training (EET) to map epigenomic changes to transcriptional changes and determine key TFs involved. We uncovered tissue-specific changes across both omic layers, including highly correlated differentially accessible regions (DARs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We identified open chromatin regions associated with DEGs (DEGaPs) and found tissue-specific and genomic feature-specific TF motif enrichment patterns among both DARs and DEGaPs. Accessible promoters of up-vs. down-regulated DEGs per tissue showed distinct TF enrichment patterns. Further, some EET-induced TFs in skeletal muscle were either validated at the proteomic level (MEF2C and NUR77) or correlated with exercise-related phenotypic changes.

AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) is known to be associated with numerous DNA methylation changes in the human brain, but the oldest old (> 90 years) have so far been underrepresented in epigenetic studies of ADNC. Our study participants were individuals aged over 90 years (n = 47) from The 90+ Study. We analyzed DNA methylation from bulk samples in eight precisely dissected regions of the human brain: middle frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA1, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and cerebellar cortex. We deconvolved our bulk data into cell-type-specific (CTS) signals using computational methods. CTS methylation differences were analyzed across different levels of ADNC. The highest amount of ADNC related methylation differences was found in the dentate gyrus, a region that has so far been underrepresented in large scale multi-omic studies. In neurons of the dentate gyrus, DNA methylation significantly differed with increased burden of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques at 5897 promoter regions of protein-coding genes. Amongst these, higher Aβ plaque burden was associated with promoter hypomethylation of the Presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2) gene, one of the rate limiting genes in the formation of gamma-secretase, a multicomponent complex that is responsible in part for the endoproteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein into Aβ peptides. In addition to novel ADNC related DNA methylation changes, we present the most detailed array-based methylation survey of the old aged human brain to date. Our open-sourced dataset can serve as a brain region reference panel for future studies and help advance research in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s40478-022-01470-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 36447297\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9710143\n\nAbstract\n\nMassively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is a high-throughput method that enables the study of the regulatory activities of tens of thousands of DNA oligonucleotides in a single experiment. While MPRA experiments have grown in popularity, their small sample sizes compared to the scale of the human genome limits our understanding of the regulatory effects they detect. To address this, we develop a deep learning model, MpraNet, to distinguish potential MPRA targets from the background genome. This model achieves high discriminative performance (AUROC=0.85) at differentiating MPRA positives from a set of control variants that mimic the background genome when applied to the lymphoblastoid cell line. We observe that existing functional scores represent very distinct functional effects, and most of them fail to characterize the regulatory effect that MPRA detects. Using MpraNet, we predict potential MPRA functional variants across the genome and identify the distributions of MPRA effect relative to other characteristics of genetic variation, including allele frequency, alternative functional annotations specified by FAVOR, and phenome-wide associations. We also observed that the predicted MPRA positives are not uniformly distributed across the genome; instead, they are clumped together in active regions comprising 9.95% of the genome and inactive regions comprising 89.07% of the genome. Furthermore, we propose our model as a screen to filter MPRA experiment candidates at genome-wide scale, enabling future experiments to be more cost-efficient by increasing precision relative to that observed from previous MPRAs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/nar/gkac990\n\nView details for PubMedID 36350674\n\nAbstract\n\nA major challenge in human genetics is to identify the molecular mechanisms of trait-associated and disease-associated variants. To achieve this, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of genetic variants with intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and splicing have been widely adopted1,2. However, despite successes, the molecular basis for a considerable fraction of trait-associated and disease-associated variants remains unclear3,4. Here we show that ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, a post-transcriptional event vital for suppressing cellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated innate immune interferon responses5-11, is an important potential mechanism underlying genetic variants associated with common inflammatory diseases. We identified and characterized 30,319 cis-RNA editing QTLs (edQTLs) across 49 human tissues. These edQTLs were significantly enriched in genome-wide association study signals for autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. Colocalization analysis of edQTLs with disease risk loci further pinpointed key, putatively immunogenic dsRNAs formed by expected inverted repeat Alu elements as well as unexpected, highly over-represented cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, inflammatory disease risk variants, in aggregate, were associated with reduced editing of nearby dsRNAs and induced interferon responses in inflammatory diseases. This unique directional effect agrees with the established mechanism that lack of RNA editing by ADAR1 leads to the specific activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and subsequent interferon responses and inflammation7-9. Our findings implicate cellular dsRNA editing and sensing as a previously underappreciated mechanism of common inflammatory diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-022-05052-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 35922514\n\nAbstract\n\nPolygenic risk scores (PRSs) quantify the contribution of multiple genetic loci to an individual's likelihood of a complex trait or disease. However, existing PRSs estimate this likelihood with common genetic variants, excluding the impact of rare variants. Here, we report on a method to identify rare variants associated with outlier gene expression and integrate their impact into PRS predictions for body mass index (BMI), obesity, and bariatric surgery. Between the top and bottom 10%, we observed a 20.8% increase in risk for obesity (p= 3*10-14), 62.3% increase in risk for severe obesity (p= 1*10-6), and median 5.29 years earlier onset for bariatric surgery (p=0.008), as a function of expression outlier-associated rare variant burden when controlling for common variant PRS. We show that these predictions were more significant than integrating the effects of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs), observing a mean 19% increase in phenotypic variance explained with expression outlier-associated rare variants when compared with PTVs (p= 2*10-15). We replicated these findings by using data from the Million Veteran Program and demonstrated that PRSs across multiple traits and diseases can benefit from the inclusion of expression outlier-associated rare variants identified through population-scale transcriptome sequencing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.04.015\n\nView details for PubMedID 35588732\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Identification of causal genes for polygenic human diseases has been extremely challenging, and our understanding of how physiological and pharmacological stimuli modulate genetic risk at disease-associated loci is limited. Specifically, insulin resistance (IR), a common feature of cardiometabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia, lacks well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and therefore, few associated loci and causal genes have been identified.METHODS: Here, we perform and integrate linkage disequilibrium (LD)-adjusted colocalization analyses across nine cardiometabolic traits (fasting insulin, fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, insulin sensitivity index, type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio) combined with expression and splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTLs and sQTLs) from five metabolically relevant human tissues (subcutaneous and visceral adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas). To elucidate the upstream regulators and functional mechanisms for these genes, we integrate their transcriptional responses to 21 relevant physiological and pharmacological perturbations in human adipocytes, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscle cells and map their protein-protein interactions.RESULTS: We identify 470 colocalized loci and prioritize 207 loci with a single colocalized gene. Patterns of shared colocalizations across traits and tissues highlight different potential roles for colocalized genes in cardiometabolic disease and distinguish several genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell function from others with a more direct role in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissues. At the loci with a single colocalized gene, 42 of these genes were regulated by insulin and 35 by glucose in perturbation experiments, including 17 regulated by both. Other metabolic perturbations regulated the expression of 30 more genes not regulated by glucose or insulin, pointing to other potential upstream regulators of candidate causal genes.CONCLUSIONS: Our use of transcriptional responses under metabolic perturbations to contextualize genetic associations from our custom colocalization approach provides a list of likely causal genes and their upstream regulators in the context of IR-associated cardiometabolic risk.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13073-022-01036-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 35292083\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the past five years transcriptome or RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has steadily emerged as a complementary assay for rare disease diagnosis and discovery. In this perspective, we summarize several recent developments and challenges in use of RNA-seq for rare disease investigation. Using an accessible patient sample, such as blood, skin, or muscle, RNA-seq enables the assay of expressed RNA transcripts. Analysis of RNA-seq allows the identification of aberrant or outlier gene expression and alternative splicing as functional evidence to support rare disease study and diagnosis. Further, many types of variant effects can be profiled beyond coding variants, as the consequences of non-coding variants that impact gene expression and splicing can be directly observed. This is particularly apparent for structural variants which disproportionately underlie outlier gene expression and for splicing variants where RNA-seq can both measure aberrant canonical splicing and detect deep intronic effects. However, a major potential limitation of RNA-seq in rare disease investigation is the developmental and cell type-specificity of gene expression as a pathogenic variant's effect may be limited to a specific spatiotemporal context and access to a patient's tissue sample from the relevant tissue and timing of disease expression may not be possible. We speculate that as advances in computational methods and emerging experimental techniques overcome both developmental and cell type-specificity, there will be broadening use of RNA sequencing and multi-omics in rare disease diagnosis and delivery of precision health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1101/mcs.a006198\n\nView details for PubMedID 35217565\n\nAbstract\n\nThe basis for acquired resistance to JAK inhibition in patients with JAK2-driven hematologic malignancies is not well understood. We report a patient with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with a BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase (BCR)-JAK2 fusion with initial hematologic response to ruxolitinib who rapidly developed B-lymphoid blast transformation. We analyzed pre-ruxolitinib and blast transformation samples using genome sequencing, DNA mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromosomal microarray to characterize possible mechanisms of resistance. No resistance mutations in the BCR-JAK2 fusion gene or transcript were identified, and fusion transcript expression levels remained stable. However, at the time of blast transformation, MPseq detected a new IKZF1 copy-number loss, which is predicted to result in loss of normal IKZF1 protein translation. RNA-seq revealed significant upregulation of genes negatively regulated by IKZF1, including IL7R and CRLF2. Disease progression was also characterized by adaptation to an activated B-cell receptor (BCR)-like signaling phenotype, with marked upregulation of genes such as CD79A, CD79B, IGLL1, VPREB1, BLNK, ZAP70, RAG1, and RAG2. In summary, IKZF1 deletion and a switch from cytokine dependence to activated BCR-like signaling phenotype represent putative mechanisms of ruxolitinib resistance in this case, recapitulating preclinical data on resistance to JAK inhibition in CRLF2-rearranged Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004174\n\nView details for PubMedID 34505882\n\nAbstract\n\n3' untranslated region (3'UTR) variants are strongly associated with human traits and diseases, yet few have been causally identified. We developed the massively parallel reporter assay for 3'UTRs (MPRAu) to sensitively assay 12,173 3'UTR variants. We applied MPRAu to six human cell lines, focusing on genetic variants associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and human evolutionary adaptation. MPRAu expands our understanding of 3'UTR function, suggesting that simple sequences predominately explain 3'UTR regulatory activity. We adapt MPRAu to uncover diverse molecular mechanisms at base pair resolution, including an adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich element of LEPR linked to potential metabolic evolutionary adaptations in East Asians. We nominate hundreds of 3'UTR causal variants with genetically fine-mapped phenotype associations. Using endogenous allelic replacements, we characterize one variant that disrupts a miRNA site regulating the viral defense gene TRIM14 and one that alters PILRB abundance, nominating a causal variant underlying transcriptional changes in age-related macular degeneration.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2021.08.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 34534445\n\nAbstract\n\nMouse IgE and mast cell (MC) functions have been studied primarily using inbred strains. Here, we (a) identified effects of genetic background on mouse IgE and MC phenotypes, (b) defined the suitability of various strains for studying IgE and MC functions, and (c) began to study potentially novel genes involved in such functions. We screened 47 Collaborative Cross (CC) strains, as well as C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice, for strength of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and responses to the intestinal parasite Strongyloides venezuelensis (S.v.). CC mice exhibited a diversity in PCA strength and S.v. responses. Among strains tested, C57BL/6J and CC027 mice showed, respectively, moderate and uniquely potent MC activity. Quantitative trait locus analysis and RNA sequencing of BM-derived cultured MCs (BMCMCs) from CC027 mice suggested Sp140 as a candidate gene for MC activation. siRNA-mediated knock-down of Sp140 in BMCMCs decreased IgE-dependent histamine release and cytokine production. Our results demonstrated marked variations in IgE and MC activity in vivo, and in responses to S.v., across CC strains. C57BL/6J and CC027 represent useful models for studying MC functions. Additionally, we identified Sp140 as a gene that contributes to IgE-dependent MC activation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1172/jci.insight.146572\n\nView details for PubMedID 34156030\n\nAbstract\n\nThe analysis of whole-genome sequencing studies is challenging due to the large number of rare variants in noncoding regions and the lack of natural units for testing. We propose a statistical method to detect and localize rare and common risk variants in whole-genome sequencing studies based on a recently developed knockoff framework. It can (1) prioritize causal variants over associations due to linkage disequilibrium thereby improving interpretability; (2) help distinguish the signal due to rare variants from shadow effects of significant common variants nearby; (3) integrate multiple knockoffs for improved power, stability, and reproducibility; and (4) flexibly incorporate state-of-the-art and future association tests to achieve the benefits proposed here. In applications to whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and COPDGene samples from NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program we show that our method compared with conventional association tests can lead to substantially more discoveries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-021-22889-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 34035245\n\nAbstract\n\nKCTD7 is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein family and has been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), characterized by myoclonus, epilepsy, and neurological deterioration. Here we report four affected individuals from two unrelated families in which we identified KCTD7 compound heterozygous single nucleotide variants through exome sequencing. RNAseq was used to detect a non-annotated splicing junction created by a synonymous variant in the second family. Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis of neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the patients' variant alleles demonstrated aberrant potassium regulation. While all four patients experienced many of the common clinical features of PME, they also showed variable phenotypes not previously reported, including dysautonomia, brain pathology findings including a significantly reduced thalamus, and the lack of myoclonic seizures. To gain further insight into the pathogenesis of the disorder, zinc finger nucleases were used to generate kctd7 knockout zebrafish. Kctd7 homozygous mutants showed global dysregulation of gene expression and increased transcription of c-fos, which has previously been correlated with seizure activity in animal models. Together these findings expand the known phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-associated PME, report a new animal model for future studies, and contribute valuable insights into the disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/01677063.2021.1892095\n\nView details for PubMedID 33970744\n\nAbstract\n\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes have well-established and important impacts on molecular and cellular functions. However, among the thousands of lncRNA genes, it is still a major challenge to identify the subset with disease or trait relevance. To systematically characterize these lncRNA genes, we used Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v8 genetic and multi-tissue transcriptomic data to profile the expression, genetic regulation, cellular contexts, and trait associations of 14,100 lncRNA genes across 49 tissues for 101 distinct complex genetic traits. Using these approaches, we identified 1,432 lncRNA gene-trait associations, 800 of which were not explained by stronger effects of neighboring protein-coding genes. This included associations between lncRNA quantitative trait loci and inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, as well as rare variant associations to body mass index.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.050\n\nView details for PubMedID 33864768\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Biallelic variants in IL6ST cause a recessive form of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) characterized by high IgE, eosinophilia, defective acute phase response, susceptibility to bacterial infections and skeletal abnormalities due to cytokine selective loss-of-function in GP130 with defective IL-6 and IL-11, variable OSM and IL-27 but sparing LIF signaling.OBJECTIVE: To understand the functional and structural impact of recessive HIES-associated IL6ST variants.METHODS: We investigated a patient with HIES using exome, genome and RNA sequencing. Functional assays assessed IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, OSM, LIF, CT-1, CLC, and CNTF signaling. Molecular dynamic simulations and structural modeling of GP130 cytokine receptor complexes were performed.RESULTS: We identify a patient with compound heterozygous novel missense variants in IL6ST (p.Ala517Pro, and exon-skipping null variant p.Gly484_Pro518delinsArg). The p.Ala517Pro variant results in a more profound IL-6 and IL-11 dominated signaling defect compared to the previously identified recessive IL6ST variants p.Asn404Tyr, and p.Pro498Leu. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the p.Ala517Pro and p.Asn404Tyr variants result in increased flexibility of the extracellular membrane-proximal domains of GP130. We propose a structural model that explains the cytokine selectivity of pathogenic IL6ST variants that result in recessive HIES. The variants destabilize the hexameric cytokine receptor complexes whereas the trimeric LIF-GP130-LIFR complex remains stable by an additional membrane-proximal interaction. Deletion of this membrane-proximal interaction site in GP130 consequently causes additional defective LIF signaling and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome.CONCLUSION: Our data provide a structural basis to understand clinical phenotypes in patients with IL6ST variants.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.02.044\n\nView details for PubMedID 33771552\n\nAbstract\n\nThe resources generated by the GTEx consortium offer unprecedented opportunities to advance our understanding of the biology of human diseases.

Current methods for assessing the ability of PTVs to induce nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) focus primarily on the position of the variant in the transcript. We used RNA sequencing of the Genotype Tissue Expression v.8 cohort to compute the efficiency of NMD using allelic imbalance for 2,320 rare (genome aggregation database minor allele frequency ≤ 1%) PTVs across 809 individuals in 49 tissues. We created an interpretable predictive model using penalized logistic regression in order to evaluate the comprehensive influence of variant annotation, tissue, and inter-individual variation on NMD. We found that variant position, allele frequency, the inclusion of ultra-rare and singleton variants, and conservation were predictive of allelic imbalance. Furthermore, we found that NMD effects were highly concordant across tissues and individuals. Due to this high consistency, we demonstrate in silico that utilizing peripheral tissues or cell lines provides accurate prediction of NMD for PTVs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.06.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 34216550\n\nAbstract\n\nComplex traits and diseases can be influenced by both genetics and environment. However, given the large number of environmental stimuli and power challenges for gene-by-environment testing, it remains a critical challenge to identify and prioritize specific disease-relevant environmental exposures. We propose a framework for leveraging signals from transcriptional responses to environmental perturbations to identify disease-relevant perturbations that can modulate genetic risk for complex traits and inform the functions of genetic variants associated with complex traits. We perturbed human skeletal-muscle-, fat-, and liver-relevant cell lines with 21 perturbations affecting insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic regulation in humans and identified thousands of environmentally responsive genes. By combining these data with GWASs from 31 distinct polygenic traits, we show that the heritability of multiple traits is enriched in regions surrounding genes responsive to specific perturbations and, further, that environmentally responsive genes are enriched for associations with specific diseases and phenotypes from the GWAS Catalog. Overall, we demonstrate the advantages of large-scale characterization of transcriptional changes in diversely stimulated and pathologically relevant cells to identify disease-relevant perturbations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.08.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 34582792\n\nAbstract\n\nGenome-wide association studies of neurological diseases have identified thousands of variants associated with disease phenotypes.

We developed a machine-learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional SNPs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, nominating target genes and cell types for previously orphaned loci from genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we dissected the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) Parkinson's disease risk locus, identifying putative ectopic regulatory interactions in neurons that may mediate this disease association.

However, a gap remains in identifying the detailed molecular signals induced by exercise that benefits health and prevents disease. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) was established to address this gap and generate a molecular map of exercise. Preclinical and clinical studies will examine the systemic effects of endurance and resistance exercise across a range of ages and fitness levels by molecular probing of multiple tissues before and after acute and chronic exercise. From this multi-omic and bioinformatic analysis, a molecular map of exercise will be established. Altogether, MoTrPAC will provide a public database that is expected to enhance our understanding of the health benefits of exercise and to provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.004\n\nView details for PubMedID 32589957\n\nAbstract\n\nStructural variants (SVs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) are important sources of genetic diversity but are not routinely analyzed in genetic studies because they are difficult to accurately identify and genotype.

Here, we demonstrate that in humans, FAM13A alleles are associated with increased FAM13A expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and an insulin resistance-related phenotype (e.g. higher waist-to-hip ratio and fasting insulin levels, but lower body fat). In human adipocyte models, knockdown of FAM13A in preadipocytes accelerates adipocyte differentiation. In mice, Fam13a knockout (KO) have a lower visceral to subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio after high-fat diet challenge, in comparison to their wild-type counterparts. Subcutaneous adipocytes in KO mice show a size distribution shift toward an increased number of smaller adipocytes, along with an improved adipogenic potential. Our results indicate that GWAS-associated variants within the FAM13A locus alter adipose FAM13A expression, which in turn, regulates adipocyte differentiation and contribute to changes in body fat distribution.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-020-15291-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 32193374\n\nAbstract\n\nRecombinant AAV vectors have the unique ability to promote targeted integration of transgenes via homologous recombination at specified genomic sites reaching frequencies of 0.1-1%. We studied genomic parameters that influence targeting efficiencies on a large scale. To do this, we generated more than 1000 engineered, doxycycline-inducible target sites in the human HAP1 cell line and infected this polyclonal population with a library of AAV-DJ targeting vectors each carrying a unique barcode. The heterogeneity of barcode integration at each target site provided an assessment of targeting efficiency at that locus. We compared targeting efficiency with and without target site transcription for identical chromosomal positions. Targeting efficiency was enhanced by target site transcription, while chromatin accessibility was associated with an increased likelihood of targeting. ChromHMM chromatin states characterizing transcription and enhancers in wildtype K562 cells were also associated with increased AAV-HR efficiency with and without target site transcription, respectively. Furthermore, the amenability of a site to targeting was influenced by the endogenous transcriptional level of intersecting genes. These results define important parameters that may not only assist in designing optimal targeting vectors for genome editing, but also provide new insights into the mechanism of AAV-mediated homologous recombination.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 33248247\n\nAbstract\n\nMany complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aba3066\n\nView details for PubMedID 32913072\n\nAbstract\n\nPopulation structure among study subjects may confound genetic association studies, and lack of proper correction can lead to spurious findings. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project largely contains individuals of European ancestry, but the v8 release also includes up to 15% of individuals of non-European ancestry. Assessing ancestry-based adjustments in GTEx improves portability of this research across populations and further characterizes the impact of population structure on GWAS colocalization.Here, we identify a subset of 117 individuals in GTEx (v8) with a high degree of population admixture and estimate genome-wide local ancestry. We perform genome-wide cis-eQTL mapping using admixed samples in seven tissues, adjusted by either global or local ancestry. Consistent with previous work, we observe improved power with local ancestry adjustment. At loci where the two adjustments produce different lead variants, we observe 31 loci (0.02%) where a significant colocalization is called only with one eQTL ancestry adjustment method. Notably, both adjustments produce similar numbers of significant colocalizations within each of two different colocalization methods, COLOC and FINEMAP. Finally, we identify a small subset of eQTL-associated variants highly correlated with local ancestry, providing a resource to enhance functional follow-up.We provide a local ancestry map for admixed individuals in the GTEx v8 release and describe the impact of ancestry and admixture on gene expression, eQTLs, and GWAS colocalization. While the majority of the results are concordant between local and global ancestry-based adjustments, we identify distinct advantages and disadvantages to each approach.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13059-020-02113-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 32912333\n\nAbstract\n\nRare genetic variants are abundant across the human genome, and identifying their function and phenotypic impact is a major challenge.

We developed Watershed, a probabilistic model that integrates multiple genomic and transcriptomic signals to predict variant function, validated these predictions in additional cohorts and through experimental assays, and used them to assess RVs in the UK Biobank, the Million Veterans Program, and the Jackson Heart Study. Our results link thousands of RVs to diverse molecular effects and provide evidence to associate RVs affecting the transcriptome with human traits.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.aaz5900\n\nView details for PubMedID 32913073\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute physical activity leads to several changes in metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune pathways. Although studies have examined selected changes in these pathways, the system-wide molecular response to an acute bout of exercise has not been fully characterized. We performed longitudinal multi-omic profiling of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells including metabolome, lipidome, immunome, proteome, and transcriptome from 36 well-characterized volunteers, before and after a controlled bout of symptom-limited exercise. Time-series analysis revealed thousands of molecular changes and an orchestrated choreography of biological processes involving energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue repair, and growth factor response, as well as regulatory pathways. Most of these processes were dampened and some were reversed in insulin-resistant participants. Finally, we discovered biological pathways involved in cardiopulmonary exercise response and developed prediction models revealing potential resting blood-based biomarkers of peak oxygen consumption.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.043\n\nView details for PubMedID 32470399\n\nAbstract\n\nMobile genetic elements (MGEs) contribute to bacterial adaptation and evolution; however, high-throughput, unbiased MGE detection remains challenging. We describe MGEfinder, a bioinformatic toolbox that identifies integrative MGEs and their insertion sites by using short-read sequencing data. MGEfinder identifies the genomic site of each MGE insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. We apply MGEfinder to 12,374 sequenced isolates of 9 prevalent bacterial pathogens, includingMycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and identify thousands of MGEs, including candidate insertion sequences, conjugative transposons, and prophage elements. The MGE repertoire and insertion rates vary across species, and integration sites often cluster near genes related to antibiotic resistance, virulence, and pathogenicity. MGE insertions likely contribute to antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Additionally, we identified thousands of mobility genes, a subset of which have unknown function opening avenues for exploration. Future application of MGEfinder to commensal bacteria will further illuminate bacterial adaptation and evolution.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.chom.2019.10.022\n\nView details for PubMedID 31862382\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Molecular and cellular changes are intrinsic to aging and age-related diseases. Prior cross-sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age.RESULTS: We perform RNA sequencing in whole blood from the same individuals at ages 70 and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period of advanced aging at a population and individual level. We observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their own age. We identify 1291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories. Further, we observe a strong correlation of genetic effects on expression and splicing between the two ages, with a small subset of tested genes showing a reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in older age.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that, although the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stable late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by a reduction in genetic regulation, most likely due to increasing environmental variance with age.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13059-019-1840-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 31684996\n\nAbstract\n\nGenomic studies in African populations provide unique opportunities to understand disease etiology, human diversity, and population history. In the largest study of its kind, comprising genome-wide data from 6,400 individuals and whole-genome sequences from 1,978 individuals from rural Uganda, we find evidence of geographically correlated fine-scale population substructure. Historically, the ancestry of modern Ugandans was best represented by a mixture of ancient East African pastoralists. We demonstrate the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as an imputation resource. Examining 34 cardiometabolic traits, we show systematic differences in trait heritability between European and African populations, probably reflecting the differential impact of genes and environment. In a multi-trait pan-African GWAS of up to 14,126 individuals, we identify novel loci associated with anthropometric, hematological, lipid, and glycemic traits. We find that several functionally important signals are driven by Africa-specific variants, highlighting the value of studying diverse populations across the region.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.004\n\nView details for PubMedID 31675503\n\nAbstract\n\nIn response to various stimuli, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can de-differentiate, proliferate and migrate in a process known as phenotypic modulation. However, the phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo during atherosclerosis and the influence of this process on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk have not been clearly established. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomic phenotype of modulated SMCs in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions of both mouse and human arteries and found that these cells transform into unique fibroblast-like cells, termed 'fibromyocytes', rather than into a classical macrophage phenotype. SMC-specific knockout of TCF21-a causal CAD gene-markedly inhibited SMC phenotypic modulation in mice, leading to the presence of fewer fibromyocytes within lesions as well as within the protective fibrous cap of the lesions. Moreover, TCF21 expression was strongly associated with SMC phenotypic modulation in diseased human coronary arteries, and higher levels of TCF21 expression were associated with decreased CAD risk in human CAD-relevant tissues. These results establish a protective role for both TCF21 and SMC phenotypic modulation in this disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41591-019-0512-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 31359001\n\nAbstract\n\nA central goal in human genetics is the identification of variants and genes that influence the risk of polygenic diseases. In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified tens of thousands of genetic loci associated with various diseases. Since the majority of such loci lie within non-coding regions and have many candidate variants in linkage disequilibrium, it has been challenging to accurately identify specific causal variants and genes. To aid in their discovery a variety of statistical and experimental approaches have been developed. These approaches often borrow information from functional genomics assays such as ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to annotate functional variants and identify regulatory relationships between variants and genes. While such approaches are powerful, given the diversity of cell types and environments, it is paramount to select disease-relevant contexts for follow-up analyses. In this review, we discuss the latest developments, challenges, and best practices for determining the causal mechanisms of polygenic disease risk variants with functional genomics data from specialized cell types.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00439-019-02044-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 31317254\n\nAbstract\n\nThe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) serves vital roles in ocular development and retinal homeostasis but has limited representation in large-scale functional genomics datasets. Understanding how common human genetic variants affect RPE gene expression could elucidate the sources of phenotypic variability in selected monogenic ocular diseases and pinpoint causal genes at genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. We interrogated the genetics of gene expression of cultured human fetal RPE (fRPE) cells under two metabolic conditions and discovered hundreds of shared or condition-specific expression or splice quantitative trait loci (e/sQTLs). Co-localizations of fRPE e/sQTLs with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and myopia GWAS data suggest new candidate genes, and mechanisms by which a common RDH5 allele contributes to both increased AMD risk and decreased myopia risk. Our study highlights the unique transcriptomic characteristics of fRPE and provides a resource to connect e/sQTLs in a critical ocular cell type to monogenic and complex eye disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s42003-019-0430-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 31925026\n\nAbstract\n\nUrine biomarkers reflecting kidney function and handling of dietary sodium and potassium are strongly associated with several common diseases including chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Knowledge about the genetic determinants of these biomarkers may shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases. We performed genome-wide association studies of urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary potassium: creatinine ratio (UK/UCr), urinary sodium: creatinine ratio (UNa/UCr) and urinary sodium: potassium ratio (UNa/UK) in up to 218,450 (discovery) and 109,166 (replication) unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Further, we explored genetic correlations, tissue-specific gene expression, and possible genes implicated in the regulation of these biomarkers. After replication, we identified 19 genome-wide significant independent loci associated with UACR, 6 each with UK/UCr and UNa/UCr, and 4 with UNa/UK. In addition to 22 novel associations, we confirmed several established associations, including between the CUBN locus and microalbuminuria. We detected high pairwise genetic correlation across the urinary biomarkers, and between their levels and several physiological measurements. We highlight GIPR, a potential diabetes drug target, as possibly implicated in the genetic control of urinary potassium excretion, and NRBP1, a locus associated with gout, as plausibly involved in sodium and albumin excretion. Overall, we identified 22 novel genome-wide significant associations with urinary biomarkers and confirmed several previously established associations, providing new insights into the genetic basis of these traits and their connection to chronic diseases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30910378\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are approximately 7,000 rare diseases affecting 25-30 million Americans, with 80% estimated to have a genetic basis. This presents a challenge for genetics practitioners to determine appropriate testing, make accurate diagnoses, and conduct up-to-date patient management. Exome sequencing (ES) is a comprehensive diagnostic approach, but only 25%-41% of the patients receive a molecular diagnosis. The remaining three-fifths to three-quarters of patients undergoing ES remain undiagnosed. The Stanford Center for Undiagnosed Diseases (CUD), a clinical site of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, evaluates patients with undiagnosed and rare diseases using a combination of methods including ES. Frequently these patients have non-diagnostic ES results, but strategic follow-up techniques identify diagnoses in a subset. We present techniques used at the CUD that can be adopted by genetics providers in clinical follow-up of cases where ES is non-diagnostic. Solved case examples illustrate different types of non-diagnostic results and the additional techniques that led to a diagnosis. Frequent approaches include segregation analysis, data reanalysis, genome sequencing, additional variant identification, careful phenotype-disease correlation, confirmatory testing, and case matching. We also discuss prioritization of cases for additional analyses.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30964584\n\nAbstract\n\nHeart failure is a leading cause of mortality, yet our understanding of the genetic interactions underlying this disease remains incomplete. Here, we harvest 1352 healthy and failing human hearts directly from transplant center operating rooms, and obtain genome-wide genotyping and gene expression measurements for a subset of 313. We build failing and non-failing cardiac regulatory gene networks, revealing important regulators and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). PPP1R3A emerges as a regulator whose network connectivity changes significantly between health and disease. RNA sequencing after PPP1R3A knockdown validates network-based predictions, and highlights metabolic pathway regulation associated with increased cardiomyocyte size and perturbed respiratory metabolism. Mice lacking PPP1R3A are protected against pressure-overload heart failure. We present a global gene interaction map of the human heart failure transition, identify previously unreported cardiac eQTLs, and demonstrate the discovery potential of disease-specific networks through the description of PPP1R3A as a central regulator in heart failure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-019-10591-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 31235787\n\nAbstract\n\nIt is estimated that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from rare diseases, which are predominantly caused by mutation in a single gene1. The current molecular diagnostic rate is estimated at 50%, with whole-exome sequencing (WES) among the most successful approaches2-5. For patients in whom WES is uninformative, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has shown diagnostic utility in specific tissues and diseases6-8. This includes muscle biopsies from patients with undiagnosed rare muscle disorders6,9, and cultured fibroblasts from patients with mitochondrial disorders7. However, for many individuals, biopsies are not performed for clinical care, and tissues are difficult to access. We sought to assess the utility of RNA-seq from blood as a diagnostic tool for rare diseases of different pathophysiologies. We generated whole-blood RNA-seq from 94 individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases spanning 16 diverse disease categories. We developed a robust approach to compare data from these individuals with large sets of RNA-seq data for controls (n = 1,594 unrelated controls and n = 49 family members) and demonstrated the impacts of expression, splicing, gene and variant filtering strategies on disease gene identification. Across our cohort, we observed that RNA-seq yields a 7.5% diagnostic rate, and an additional 16.7% with improved candidate gene resolution.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41591-019-0457-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 31160820\n\nAbstract\n\nThe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) serves vital roles in ocular development and retinal homeostasis but has limited representation in large-scale functional genomics datasets.

Rare false-negative results could not be attributed to sequencing platform, selection method, or other assay characteristics. The median and average of the variant allele fractions reported by the laboratories were within 10% of those orthogonally determined by digital polymerase chain reaction for each variant. The median coverage reported at the variant sites ranged from 1922 to 3297.CONCLUSIONS.: Laboratories demonstrated an overall accuracy of greater than 98% with high specificity when examining 10 clinically relevant somatic single-nucleotide variants with a variant allele fraction of 15% or greater. These initial data suggest excellent performance, but further ongoing studies are needed to evaluate the performance of lower variant allele fractions and additional variant types.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30376374\n\nAbstract\n\nPCSK9 inhibition is a potent new therapy for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease. Although short-term clinical trial results have not demonstrated major adverse effects, long-term data will not be available for some time. Genetic studies in large biobanks offer a unique opportunity to predict drug effects and provide context for the evaluation of future clinical trial outcomes.We tested the association of the PCSK9 missense variant rs11591147 with predefined phenotypes and phenome-wide, in 337 536 individuals of British ancestry in the UK Biobank, with independent discovery and replication. Using a Bayesian statistical method, we leveraged phenotype correlations to evaluate the phenome-wide impact of PCSK9 inhibition with higher power at a finer resolution.The T allele of rs11591147 showed a protective effect on hyperlipidemia (odds ratio, 0.63±0.04; P=2.32×10-38), coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.73±0.09; P=1.05×10-6), and ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 0.61±0.18; P=2.40×10-3) and was associated with increased type 2 diabetes mellitus risk adjusted for lipid-lowering medication status (odds ratio, 1.24±0.10; P=1.98×10-7). We did not observe associations with cataracts, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive dysfunction. Leveraging phenotype correlations, we observed evidence of a protective association with cerebral infarction and vascular occlusion. These results explore the effects of direct PCSK9 inhibition; off-target effects cannot be predicted using this approach.This result represents the first genetic evidence in a large cohort for the protective effect of PCSK9 inhibition on ischemic stroke and corroborates exploratory evidence from clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibition was not associated with variables other than those related to LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting that other effects are either small or absent.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29997226\n\nAbstract\n\nTranslation of mRNAs is tightly regulated and constantly surveyed for errors. Aberrant translation can trigger co-translational protein and RNA quality control processes, impairments of which cause neurodegeneration by still poorly understood mechanism(s). Here we show that quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)-localized mRNA intersects with the turnover of damaged mitochondria, both orchestrated by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1. Mitochondrial damage causes stalled translation of complex-I 30 kDa subunit (C-I30) mRNA on MOM, triggering the recruitment of co-translational quality control factors Pelo, ABCE1, and NOT4 to the ribosome/mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex. Damage-induced ubiquitination of ABCE1 by NOT4 generates poly-ubiquitin signals that attract autophagy receptors to MOM to initiate mitophagy. In the Drosophila PINK1 model, these factors act synergistically to restore mitophagy and neuromuscular tissue integrity. Thus ribosome-associated co-translational quality control generates an early signal to trigger mitophagy. Our results have broad therapeutic implications for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29861391\n\nAbstract\n\nWhen compared with solid brain metastases from NSCLC, leptomeningeal disease (LMD) has unique growth patterns and is rapidly fatal. Patients with LMD do not undergo surgical resection, limiting the tissue available for scientific research. In this study we performed whole exome sequencing on eight samples of LMD to identify somatic mutations and compared the results with those for 26 solid brain metastases. We found that taste 2 receptor member 31 gene (TAS2R31) and phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein gene (PDE4DIP) were recurrently mutated among LMD samples, suggesting involvement in LMD progression. Together with a retrospective review of the charts of an additional 44 patients with NSCLC LMD, we discovered a surprisingly low number of KRAS mutations (n= 4 [7.7%]) but a high number of EGFR mutations (n= 33 [63.5%]). The median interval for development of LMD from NSCLC was shorter in patients with mutant EGFR (16.3 months) than in patients with wild-type EGFR (23.9 months) (p= 0.017). Targeted analysis of recurrent mutations thus presents a useful complement to the existing diagnostic tool kit, and correlations of EGFR in LMD and KRAS in solid metastases suggest that molecular distinctions or systemic treatment pressure underpin the differences in growth patterns within the brain.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29604399\n\nAbstract\n\nATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, δ subunit (ATP5F1D; formerly ATP5D) is a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase and plays an important role in coupling proton translocation and ATP production. Here, we describe two individuals, each with homozygous missense variants in ATP5F1D, who presented with episodic lethargy, metabolic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and hyperammonemia. Subject 1, homozygous for c.245C>T (p.Pro82Leu), presented with recurrent metabolic decompensation starting in the neonatal period, and subject 2, homozygous for c.317T>G (p.Val106Gly), presented with acute encephalopathy in childhood. Cultured skin fibroblasts from these individuals exhibited impaired assembly of F1FO ATP synthase and subsequent reduced complex V activity. Cells from subject 1 also exhibited a significant decrease in mitochondrial cristae. Knockdown of Drosophila ATPsynδ, the ATP5F1D homolog, in developing eyes and brains caused a near complete loss of the fly head, a phenotype that was fully rescued by wild-type human ATP5F1D. In contrast, expression of the ATP5F1D c.245C>T and c.317T>G variants rescued the head-size phenotype but recapitulated the eye and antennae defects seen in other genetic models of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. Our data establish c.245C>T (p.Pro82Leu) and c.317T>G (p.Val106Gly) in ATP5F1D as pathogenic variants leading to a Mendelian mitochondrial disease featuring episodic metabolic decompensation.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29478781\n\nAbstract\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death globally. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 95 independent loci that influence CAD risk, most of which reside in non-coding regions of the genome. To interpret these loci, we generated transcriptome and whole-genome datasets using human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) from 52 unrelated donors, as well as epigenomic datasets using ATAC-seq on a subset of 8 donors. Through systematic comparison with publicly available datasets from GTEx and ENCODE projects, we identified transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic regulatory mechanisms specific to HCASMCs. We assessed the relevance of HCASMCs to CAD risk using transcriptomic and epigenomic level analyses. By jointly modeling eQTL and GWAS datasets, we identified five genes (SIPA1, TCF21, SMAD3, FES, and PDGFRA) that may modulate CAD risk through HCASMCs, all of which have relevant functional roles in vascular remodeling. Comparison with GTEx data suggests that SIPA1 and PDGFRA influence CAD risk predominantly through HCASMCs, while other annotated genes may have multiple cell and tissue targets. Together, these results provide tissue-specific and mechanistic insights into the regulation of a critical vascular cell type associated with CAD in human populations.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30146127\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple new loci which appear to alter coronary artery disease (CAD) risk via arterial wall-specific mechanisms. One of the annotated genes encodes LMOD1 (Leiomodin 1), a member of the actin filament nucleator family that is highly enriched in smooth muscle-containing tissues such as the artery wall. However, it is still unknown whether LMOD1 is the causal gene at this locus and also how the associated variants alter LMOD1 expression/function and CAD risk. Using epigenomic profiling we recently identified a non-coding regulatory variant, rs34091558, which is in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the lead CAD GWAS variant, rs2820315. Herein we demonstrate through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and statistical fine-mapping in GTEx, STARNET, and human coronary artery smooth muscle cell (HCASMC) datasets, rs34091558 is the top regulatory variant for LMOD1 in vascular tissues. Position weight matrix (PWM) analyses identify the protective allele rs34091558-TA to form a conserved Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) binding motif, which is disrupted by the risk allele rs34091558-A. FOXO3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays show reduced FOXO3 binding and LMOD1 transcriptional activity by the risk allele, consistent with effects of FOXO3 downregulation on LMOD1. LMOD1 knockdown results in increased proliferation and migration and decreased cell contraction in HCASMC, and immunostaining in atherosclerotic lesions in the SMC lineage tracing reporter mouse support a key role for LMOD1 in maintaining the differentiated SMC phenotype. These results provide compelling functional evidence that genetic variation is associated with dysregulated LMOD1 expression/function in SMCs, together contributing to the heritable risk for CAD.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30444878\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetic studies of complex traits have mainly identified associations with noncoding variants. To further determine the contribution of regulatory variation, we combined whole-genome and transcriptome data for 624 individuals from Sardinia to identify common and rare variants that influence gene expression and splicing. We identified 21,183 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 6,768 splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), including 619 new QTLs. We identified high-frequency QTLs and found evidence of selection near genes involved in malarial resistance and increased multiple sclerosis risk, reflecting the epidemiological history of Sardinia. Using family relationships, we identified 809 segregating expression outliers (median z score of 2.97), averaging 13.3 genes per individual. Outlier genes were enriched for proximal rare variants, providing a new approach to study large-effect regulatory variants and their relevance to traits. Our results provide insight into the effects of regulatory variants and their relationship to population history and individual genetic risk.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ng.3840\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000400051400010\n\nView details for PubMedID 28394350\n\nAbstract\n\nStructural variants (SVs) are an important source of human genetic diversity, but their contribution to traits, disease and gene regulation remains unclear. We mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We estimated that SVs are causal at 3.5-6.8% of eQTLs-a substantially higher fraction than prior estimates-and that expression-altering SVs have larger effect sizes than do SNVs and indels. We identified 789 putative causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression: most (88.3%) were noncoding variants enriched at enhancers and other regulatory elements, and 52 were linked to genome-wide association study loci. We observed a notable abundance of rare high-impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes. These results suggest that comprehensive WGS-based SV analyses will increase the power of common- and rare-variant association studies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ng.3834\n\nView details for PubMedID 28369037\n\nAbstract\n\nGenomewide association studies of autoimmune diseases have mapped hundreds of susceptibility regions in the genome. However, only for a few association signals has the causal gene been identified, and for even fewer have the causal variant and underlying mechanism been defined. Coincident associations of DNA variants affecting both the risk of autoimmune disease and quantitative immune variables provide an informative route to explore disease mechanisms and drug-targetable pathways.Using case-control samples from Sardinia, Italy, we performed a genomewide association study in multiple sclerosis followed by TNFSF13B locus-specific association testing in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Extensive phenotyping of quantitative immune variables, sequence-based fine mapping, cross-population and cross-phenotype analyses, and gene-expression studies were used to identify the causal variant and elucidate its mechanism of action. Signatures of positive selection were also investigated.A variant in TNFSF13B, encoding the cytokine and drug target B-cell activating factor (BAFF), was associated with multiple sclerosis as well as SLE. The disease-risk allele was also associated with up-regulated humoral immunity through increased levels of soluble BAFF, B lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins. The causal variant was identified: an insertion-deletion variant, GCTGT→A (in which A is the risk allele), yielded a shorter transcript that escaped microRNA inhibition and increased production of soluble BAFF, which in turn up-regulated humoral immunity. Population genetic signatures indicated that this autoimmunity variant has been evolutionarily advantageous, most likely by augmenting resistance to malaria.A TNFSF13B variant was associated with multiple sclerosis and SLE, and its effects were clarified at the population, cellular, and molecular levels.

PML NBs coordinate chromosomal regions via modification of nuclear proteins that in turn may regulate genes in the vicinity of these bodies. However, few PML NB-associated genes have been identified. PML and PML NBs can also regulate mTOR and cell fate decisions in response to cellular stresses. We now demonstrate that PML depletion in U2OS cells or TERT-immortalized normal human diploid fibroblasts results in decreased expression of the mTOR inhibitor DDIT4 (REDD1). DNA and RNA immuno-FISH reveal that PML NBs are closely associated with actively transcribed DDIT4 loci, implicating these bodies in regulation of basal DDIT4 expression. Although PML silencing did reduce the sensitivity of U2OS cells to metabolic stress induced by metformin, PML loss did not inhibit the upregulation of DDIT4 in response to metformin, hypoxia-like (CoCl2) or genotoxic stress. Analysis of publicly available cancer data also revealed a significant correlation between PML and DDIT4 expression in several cancer ty"
