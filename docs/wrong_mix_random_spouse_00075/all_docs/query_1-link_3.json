        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nIn October 2007, Toronto Star reporter Tonda MacCharles revealed in a front-page story that Stephen Harper’s Conservative government had secret plans to build a $2-million government-controlled media briefing centre.1 According to documents from the Privy Council Office and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that MacCharles obtained through the Access to Information Act,2 the plan, known as the Shoe Store Project, called for a venue to be built in the Sparks Street pedestrian mall that would include a stage, seating for as many as eighty reporters, electronic audio feeds, soundboards, and space for translation services.3 Effectively, this new media centre would replace the National Press Theatre, which, MacCharles noted, had been “used by prime ministers and cabinet ministers since Lester B. Pearson opened it in 1965, [and] is a venue with simultaneous translation where on-the-record news conferences are moderated by press gallery executive members – not Harper’s political staff.”4 This revelation came less than two years into Harper’s first term as prime minister, after he had already dramatically reduced reporters’ traditional access to himself and to cabinet ministers and diplomats. He even tried to bar reporters from covering the repatriation ceremonies of soldiers killed in Afghanistan. As such, news that Harper was planning to open his own press gallery was of great concern to members of the media. “It is fascinating, if not chilling to see his shrewd acts unfold,” wrote the Globe and Mail’s Lawrence Martin of the prime minister’s freezing out of reporters.5 “There are many who think his strategy, a sort of reverse glasnost, is succeeding. There are others who think that building his version of the Kremlin in Ottawa is not what the people had [in] mind.”6 But for all of the media’s concerns, readers and the 13 Media Whining or Democratic Crisis? How Institutional Secrecy Is Contextualized in National Newspapers bruce gillespie How Institutional Secrecy Is Contextualized 187 public-at-large seemed not to care. Apart from a brief surge of letters to the editor after the government’s attempt to keep reporters from covering repatriation ceremonies, the response from the public to this affront to press access was an echoing silence. Journalists regarded Harper’s carefully managed strategy of institutional secrecy as an affront to democracy, the values of which they are primed to defend, and as unnecessarily complicating their jobs. The Harper government’s efforts to avoid or circumvent journalists twice earned it the Canadian Association of Journalists’ Code of Silence Award, “recognizing Canada’s most secretive government or publicly funded agency,” first in 2009, and again in 2012.7 Both are issues of genuine concern, but as Toronto Star reporter Susan Delacourt has noted, “there has been a tendency to view stories and anecdotes about Harper’s secret capital as mere media ‘whining.’”8 If that is the case, we must ask why the public sees this issue of the restriction of journalistic access to public institutions and figures as nothing more than a workaday nuisance for reporters and what may be keeping it from becoming an issue of wider public concern. Readers are the ultimate stakeholders in this issue. Journalists do their work on behalf of readers – who are citizens, first and foremost. The democratic freedoms accorded to journalists under s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms can be seen as an extension of the freedoms accorded to all citizens. If readers fail to appreciate or understand the importance of the democratic freedoms accorded to journalists, then those rights are rendered impotent. For example, this collection contains several cautionary tales about public indifference to the lack of access to government information (Suzanne Craig, “Municipal Access to Information, Delays, and Denials: An Insider’s View”)9 or inadequate transparency in court proceedings (Daniel Henry, “Free Expression at Thirty: The Search for Respect”),10 leading to the diminishment of fundamental democratic rights. This chapter is an analysis of how reporters with the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star wrote about the Harper government’s actions and attitude toward journalists. In particular, I argue that journalists frame these issues in a way that ends up alienating readers instead of engendering their support for the key democratic role that journalists play. Drawing on an analysis of articles published during a five-year period, I suggest that reporters often framed their articles in an us-versusthem manner that personalized the issue and pitted journalists against..."
