        "text": "1950 Lester B. Pearson\n\nphoto credit: Ontario Archives I0020491\n\nLester Bowles Pearson, “Mike,” statesman, politician, public servant was born at Newtonbrook, Ontario on April 23, 1897 and died at Ottawa on December 27, 1972.\n\nPearson was Canada’s foremost diplomat and formulated its basic post-WWII foreign policy. A skilled politician, he rebuilt the Liberal Party and as prime minister strove to maintain Canada’s national unity.\n\nSon of a Methodist parson, Pearson spent his childhood moving from one parsonage to another before enrolling in history at University of Toronto.\n\nWith the outbreak of WWI, he enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps and in 1915 was shipped to Greece to join the Allied armies fighting the Bulgarians. After 2 years of stretcher-bearing, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in England. His military career came to a sudden end when he was run over by a London bus and invalided home.\n\nAfter taking his BA at University of Toronto in 1919, Pearson was undecided on a career. He tried law and business, won a fellowship to Oxford, and was hired by University of Toronto to teach history, which he combined with tennis and coaching football.\n\nPearson also married and soon had children. Finding a professor’s salary insufficient, he joined the Department of External Affairs (now Foreign Affairs and International Trade).\n\nBy 1928 he had trained himself as a perceptive observer and an able writer, both useful qualities in his work. Pearson quickly attracted the attention of his deputy minister, O.D. Skelton.\n\nIn 1935 he was sent to London as first secretary in the Canadian High Commission, giving him a front-row seat as Europe drifted towards WWII. He was profoundly influenced by what he saw and thereafter attached great importance to collective defence in the face of dictatorships and aggression.\n\nIn 1941 Pearson returned to Canada. He was sent to Washington as second-in-command at the Canadian Legation in 1942, where his easygoing personality and personal charm made him a great success, particularly with the press. In 1945 he was named Canadian ambassador to the US and attended the founding conference of the United Nations at San Francisco.\n\nIn September 1946 Pearson was summoned home by Prime Minister King to become deputy minister (or undersecretary) of external affairs. He continued to take a strong interest in the UN but also promoted a closer political and economic relationship between Canada and its principal allies, the US and the UK. Pearson’s work culminated in Canada’s joining NATO in 1949. He strongly supported a Western self-defence organization, although he hoped that its existence would persuade the USSR that aggression would be futile.\n\nBy the time NATO was in place, Pearson had left the civil service for politics. In September 1948 he became minister of external affairs and subsequently represented Algoma East, Ontario, in the House of Commons. As minister, he helped lead Canada into the Korean War as a contributor to the UN army and, in 1952, served as president of the UN General Assembly, where he tried to find a solution to the conflict. His efforts displeased the Americans, who considered him too inclined to compromise on difficult points of principle.\n\nHis greatest diplomatic achievement came in 1956, when he proposed a UN Peacekeeping force as means for easing the British and French out of Egypt. His plan was implemented, and as a reward he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957.\n\nBy then Pearson was no longer in office. He and the St-Laurent government were widely blamed for not standing by Britain in 1956. The Liberals were defeated, St-Laurent resigned as leader, and at a convention in January 1958 Pearson defeated Paul Martin to become leader. The Liberals faced a minority Conservative government under John Diefenbaker, and in his first act as leader Pearson challenged Diefenbaker to resign and turn the government over to him. Diefenbaker ridiculed the idea and in the subsequent general election the Liberals were reduced to 49 of the 265 seats in the Commons. Pearson began the slow task of rebuilding the party. With the assistance of parliamentary debaters such as Paul Martin and J.W. Pickergill and party workers such as Walter Gordon, Mitchell Sharp, and Maurice LaMontagne, he re-established the Liberals as a national party and in the 1962 general election raised the party’s total to 100 seats. In 1963 the Diefenbaker government collapsed over the issue of nuclear weapons and in the subsequent election the Liberals won 128 seats to form a minority government.\n\nPearson took office April 22, 1963. His government was expected to be more businesslike than Diefenbaker’s but proved instead to be accident-prone in aborting its first budget. Much of Parliament’s time was spent in bitter partisan and personal wrangling, culminating in an interminable Flag Debate of 1964. In 1965 Pearson called a general election but again failed to secure a majority. In the next year the Munsinger scandal erupted with even more partisan bitterness.\n\nThe year 1965 marks a dividing line in his administration, as Finance Minister Walter Gordon departed and Jean Marchand and Pierre Trudeau from Québec became prominent in the Cabinet. Pearson’s attempts in his first term to conciliate Québec and the other provinces with “co-operative federalism” and “bilingualism and biculturalism” were superseded by a firm federal response to provincial demands and by the Québec government’s attempts to usurp federal roles in international relations.\n\nWhen, during his centennial visit, French President Charles de Gaulle uttered the separatist slogan “Vive le Québec libre” to a crowd in Montréal, Pearson issued an official rebuke and de Gaulle promptly went home.\n\nIn December 1967 Pearson announced his intention to retire and in April 1968 a Liberal convention picked Pierre Trudeau as his successor.\n\nFor all its superficial chaos, the Pearson government left behind a notable legacy of legislation: a Canada Pension Plan, a universal medicare system, a unified armed force, a new flag and a revised transport Act. Its approach to the problem of Canada’s disadvantaged regions was less thorough and its legacy, such as the Glace Bay heavy-water plant, decidedly mixed. Not all of these initiatives proved fruitful and some were costly, but they represented the high point of the Canadian Welfare State that generations of social thinkers had dreamed about. In retirement Pearson worked on a study of international aid for the World Bank and on his memoirs.…from the Canadian Encyclopedia Historica\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize 1957\n\nLester Bowles Pearson Biography\n\nFor four decades Lester Bowles Pearson (April 23, 1897-1972) has been noted for his diplomatic sensitivity, his political acumen, and his personal popularity. He is affectionately called “Mike”, a nickname given to him by his flying instructor in World War I, who discarded “Lester” as being insufficiently bellicose.\n\nBorn in Toronto of Irish stock on both sides of his family, he received a balanced education in politics, learning the conservative position from his father, a Methodist minister, and the liberal from his mother.\n\nPearson entered Victoria College at the University of Toronto in 1913 at the age of sixteen. Too young to enlist as a private when Canada declared war in 1914, he volunteered to serve with a hospital unit sponsored by the University. After two years in England, Egypt, and Greece, he was commissioned and transferred eventually to the Royal Flying Corps, but, sustaining some injuries from two accidents, one of them a plane crash, he was invalided home. He served as a training instructor for the rest of the war, meanwhile continuing his studies at the University.\n\nHe received his degree in 1919 and then worked for two years for Armour and Company, a meat processing firm; years later he said, with the wit for which he is renowned, that the Russians were claiming he had once worked for an armament manufacturer.\n\nReturning to academic life, Pearson won a two-year fellowship and enrolled at Oxford University. There he excelled not only in his chosen field of history where he received the bachelor and master degrees, but also in athletics where he won his blues in lacrosse and ice hockey.\n\nIn 1924 Pearson joined the staff of the History Department of the University of Toronto, leaving it and academic life in 1928 to accept a position as first secretary in the Canadian Department of External Affairs. In this post until 1935, Pearson received an education in domestic economic affairs while «on loan»; in 1931 as secretary to a commission on wheat futures and during 1934-1935 as secretary of a commission investigating commodity prices; the same post provided him with an apprenticeship in international diplomacy when he participated in the Hague Conference on Codification of International Law(1930), the London Naval Conference (1930), the Geneva World Disarmament Conference (1933-1934), another London Naval Conference (1935), and in sessions of the League of Nations (1935).\n\nPearson moved forward rapidly. From 1935 to 1941 he served in the office of the High Commissioner for Canada in London; in May, 1941, he was appointed assistant undersecretary of state for External Affairs at Ottawa; in June, 1942, named minister-counselor at the Canadian Legation in Washington; in July, 1944, promoted to the rank of minister plenipotentiary and in January, 1945, to the rank of ambassador. During his Washington stay, Pearson participated in the establishment of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1943 and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 1943-1945; in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference on preliminary discussion for an organization of united nations (1944); and in the San Francisco Conference on the establishment of the UN (1945).\n\nPearson took over the post of undersecretary of state for External Affairs in the fall of 1946, but gave it up two years later for the possibility of action in a larger arena. In that year, Louis S. St. Laurent, the secretary of state, became prime minister of a Liberal government, replacing his retiring leader, Mackenzie King. Pearson, having conducted a successful campaign for a seat in the Commons to represent the Algoma East riding of Ontario, was given the External Affairs portfolio, holding it for nine years until the advent of John Diefenbaker’s Conservative government.\n\nPearson drafted the speech in which Prime Minister St. Laurent proposed the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), signed the enabling treaty in 1949, headed the Canadian delegation to NATO until 1957, and functioned as chairman of the NATO Council in 1951-1952. Pearson also headed the Canadian delegation to the UN from 1946 to 1956, being elected to the presidency of the Seventh Session of the General Assembly in 1952-1953. As chairman of the General Assembly’s Special Committee on Palestine, he laid the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. In the Suez crisis of 1956, when the United Kingdom, France, and Israel invaded Egyptian territory, Pearson proposed and sponsored the resolution which created a United Nations Emergency Force to police that area, thus permitting the invading nations to withdraw with a minimum loss of face.\n\nWhen the Liberals were defeated in the elections of 1957, Pearson relinquished his cabinet post but, accepting that of leader of the Opposition, began to rebuild the party. Six years later, when the Conservative government lost the confidence of the electorate, especially on the issues raised by the Cuban confrontations between the United States and Russia, and when Pearson, after a careful review of his philosophical position on national defence, announced his willingness to accept nuclear warheads from the United States, the Liberal Party was voted enough strength to establish a government with Pearson as prime minister.\n\nIn control for five years, Pearson pursued a bipartisan foreign policy based on a philosophy of internationalism. In domestic policy he implemented programs long discussed but never adopted; among them, in the field of social legislation: provisions for old age pensions, medical care, and a generalized «war on poverty»; in education: governmental assistance for higher education and technical and vocational education; in governmental operations: redistribution of electoral districts and reformation of legislative procedures. The most acrimonious debate of his half-decade in office centered on legislation to create a new flag for Canada. This legislation became the battlefield of the Conservatives, who wanted some portion of the design to recognize the traditions of the past, versus the Liberals, who wanted to eliminate historical symbols. The Liberals won and the new flag was raised on February 15, 1965.\n\nPearson retired from the leadership of his party in the spring of 1968 and died in 1972.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nAyre, W.
