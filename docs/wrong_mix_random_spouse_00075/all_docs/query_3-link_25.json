        "text": "Very few Canadians have made the same impacts on Canadian quality of life as Pierre Trudeau did as his time as a politician. During his time as a prime minister, he brought forth many changes that greatly improved the quality of all Canadians living in the country. He made the diverse population of Canada feel safe and included. Pierre trudeau has caused a significant increase on Canadians’ quality of life by helping introduce legislation such as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Official Languages act which made Canadians feel safe, protected and included. Although this influential Canadian has caused many and important positive impacts on the lives of Canadians, Pierre Trudeau has also brought forth negative, but temporary\n\nPierre Trudeau was Prime Minister from April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and again from March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984. He was known as a womanizer and a super star. This was extremely odd for a Canadian politician getting this much attention especially in this time period. While he was an entertainer and a bachelor, he was also a very smart man. He began his journey into joining the liberal party and was appointed Lester B. Pearson’s parliamentary secretary and later became\n\nWhen one thinks of Canada, he/she is most likely to stereotypically comment on a subject regarding hockey, beavers, maple syrup, and cold weather. However, not many stop and wonder about how Canada became the peaceful nation it is today. Throughout Canada’s relatively short and brief history, it has managed to flourish into a strong and powerful nation. Canada’s peaceful identity has been formed with meaningful historic events that have occurred throughout our history.It’s identity has been characterized by Lester B. Pearson's role during the suez canal, their involvement in the Vietnam war, and its engagement in peacekeeping missions around the world.\n\nIn todays world Canadians help each other fund money to help those in need; Canadians help so much that most medical services are funded public sources. Many of us would not even bother to help those in need, but Lester B. Pearson changed that part of us. He made health care such a big issue that it can not hide anywhere in this world. Lester B. Pearson, the man that gave Canada Universal Medicare also created the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.\n\nThis campaign was the fight for government assisted health care for all. The government of Canada officially passed the Medical Care Act in 1966, which created a universal health care system for all Canadians. This was a significant step in Canadian history as many countries at that time, and still today, lack laws of equality like this one. For this reason, Canadians find great pride in the fact that all people in Canada have equal access to medical care. However, this law did not easily come about, it took much time and persuasion to even be considered. Tommy Douglas began the fight for universal health care for all Canadians in 1961 when he left the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in Saskatchewan to be a part of the federal government (Colyer, et al, 2010, p.326). Douglas had the idea of giving all Canadians universal health care after he had succeeded in doing this for the people of Saskatchewan. After proving his outrageous idea of medical care being partially paid for by the government, it was easy to convince the rest of Canada. For only a small fee each month, Saskatchewan residents had their medical bills partially paid for and after only two years provincial debt was reduced by twenty million dollars (Colyer, et al, 2010, p.326). These same rules were implemented in the rest of Canada as a result of the 1966 Medical Care Act (Health Canada, 2012, online). As a result, Canadians were now supported by the government when they needed medical help. Consequently, universal health care brought both pride and equality to Canada because very few countries had the same luxuries that Canadians now\n\nCanada 's healthcare system is praised globally for its universal and free healthcare. It started to take shape after World War II in 1945. Health insurance was introduced and was attempted, but was not successful even though there was an increase in the spending of health related services and goods. Fast forward a few years to 1961 where Tommy Douglas, the premier of Saskatchewan, developed the idea for an all-inclusive insurance plan. He later inspired the Medical Care Act in Canada in 1967, when he pointed out health care is a right for all Canadians. From this one thought, Canada has become of the many countries with a universal health care system. Ever since Tommy Douglas sparked the idea for health care coverage, Canada is praised for the way it carries out its system because of several key features. This system is publically funded, is universal and is accessible to everyone across the nation. Because this is a public system, funding comes from the tax payers and some federal funding, so there is no extra cost for the patients. Also, being a universal system it has offered care to all Canadians, immigrants and visitors. Unlike the U.S who does not provide healthcare to its entire population because it is a private system; access depends on how much someone could afford, and how\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was arguably one of the most vivacious and charismatic Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. He wore capes, dated celebrities and always wore a red rose boutonniere. He looked like a superhero, and often acted like one too. Some of the landmark occurrences in Canadian history all happened during the Trudeau era, such as patriating the constitution, creating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the 1980 Quebec Referendum. However, it is Trudeau’s 1969 “white paper” and the Calder legal challenge which many consider to be one of his most influential contributions to Canadian history.\n\nI few things about Stephen Lewis and why I think he should take second place as the best Canadian. A few things about Stephen Lewis is that he was born on November 11th, 1937 in Ottawa and is 79 years old. Lewis came from a family of three siblings, two sisters and one brother, his dad’s name is David Lewis and his mom’s name is Sophie Lewis. Stephen went to school at the university of Toronto and studied sociology and politics. Stephen was exposed to politics at a young age due to his father who was the national secretary of the co-operative commonwealth federation, that's why he chose to study politics.\n\nThe definition of important is “having serious meaning or worth,” (Merriam- Webster’s Dictionary). Pierre Elliott Trudeau is the representation of this. Trudeau was born in Montreal to Joseph Charles Trudeau and Grace Elliott. Joseph was of French descent and Grace was of Scottish, therefore Trudeau was bilingual. He was appointed Minister of Justice and gained national attention for his social reforms. These include divorce laws, abortion, laws on homosexual marriage and regulations on public lotteries. Afterward, he became the 15th Prime Minister Of Canada. He was the Prime Minister from April 20th, 1968 to June 4th, 1979, and once more from March 3rd, 1980 to June 30th, 1984, obtaining the role after Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. While he was the Prime Minister for 15 years in total where he accomplished many objectives that constructed Canada. Authors Geoff Pevere and Greig Dymond considered him to be “the greatest pop star this country has ever produced,” (O’Malley Martin, 2013.) He was arguably Canada’s best-known politician and was extremely special indeed. Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the most significant post-war Prime Minister because he unified Canada and reshaped the Canadian identity. He did this by establishing the Official Languages Act, stopped terrorism carried out by the Front de libération du Québec and enacted the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all which are incredibly momentous for Canada."
