        "text": "Like just about every country, thanks to the globalisation of the past three decades, many aspects of daily life are now heavily reliant on the technology made in China. Reducing that dependency is the security imperative of our times and I am glad to be part of the Commission’s work to safeguard our freedoms into the future.\n\nI am thrilled to join the advisory board of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue at this pivotal moment for global democracy. By building bridges across political divides and fostering collaboration between private enterprise and public administration, we can encourage innovation that supports the cause of democracy and combats digital authoritarianism. The Krach Institute understands that reversing global democratic decline is a whole-of-society effort, and I am honored to take part in that effort.\n\nIn today's world, tech diplomacy is more important than ever. It's up to business leaders and policymakers to ensure that the technology we use every day is advancing freedom for a better world. I'm proud to join the Krach Institute Advisory Council to help ensure that our global leaders understand these emerging technologies and use them to promote a greater good.\n\nKeith Krach was one of the greatest economic strategists and diplomats ever at the State Department. He led our China tech war and pioneered the Clean Network to deny malicious actors, including companies like Huawei and governments like, from dominating our 5G and broader digital future. I am honored to have worked with Keith’s super E team while at State including on the investigation into the origins of COVID 19 and countering China’s civil-military fusion via curtailing Beijing’s access to our capital markets. I hope we’ll all be back together in government in the years ahead. Until then the Krach Institute will be an idea generation hub and place for tech diplomacy to flourish.\n\nContinued advancements in information and communications technologies and the use of social networking and virtual action groups for addressing and redressing governance and leadership are “shrinking” the world at an accelerating rate. Global issues, which heretofore seemed remote to some, now threaten to impact the future quality of life of most of the World’s populations. It should surprise no one that young student at universities around the world are increasingly interested in complex issues and the relevance of their education for addressing such issues. Unfortunately, these problems are “nasty” because they are coupled in complex ways. They don’t have single solutions and they don’t always lead to meaningful predictions. Decision makers depend on scientists and technologists to provide options and define consequences to policy options. They become frustrated when quantitative, self-consistent, or consensus solutions are not forthcoming.\n\nIt is a privilege to be a member of the Krach Institute’s Advisory Council. Over the years, I have led and have been involved in projects to safeguard advanced technologies of the State of Israel. I have found that securing, overseeing and safeguarding the development of advanced technologies and capabilities is imperative for the defense of Israel as a free and democratic society. As such, international cooperation and mutual commitment with regards to securing advanced technology are critical to bolster the defense of the United States, Israel, and other allied countries. It is my aim to convey this message of shared responsibility via the Advisory Council, and thus to drive forward the conservation of futuristic technology as a means for the advancement of freedom.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct financial transactions, but their implementation requires careful consideration and analysis. The work of the commission in this domain is critical in ensuring that any rollout of a central bank digital currency is done in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks for all stakeholders.\n\nAmidst a period marked with global crises and their geo-economic effects, the accelerating pace of advancement in breakthrough technologies may expose allied nations, in particular, to the risk of predation. A sensible and sustainable foreign policy framework is necessary to level the technology gap; where technology is effectively a fundamental instrument of security and sovereignty. It is an honor and a privilege for me to commit my experience to the values and work of the Institute.\n\nAs the U.S. auto industry continues to drive the truly transformational technologies in electric vehicles and automated driving, we must work diligently, across sectors to ensure that these new technologies are properly safeguarded. The work of the Global Tech Security Commission will be a catalyst in bringing U.S. technology leaders together to not only guard against existing threats to our cutting-edge technology, but also formulate proactive strategies to combat adversarial threats to America’s future technological leadership. So I am honored to have been selected to serve on the Commission, and I am eager to work with leaders from other critical U.S. industries to carry out the important work and mission of the Global Tech Security Commission.\n\nGod blessed our Founding Fathers with the foresight to establish a nation in which mankind was free to pursue our dreams and fulfill our potential. Our American economic system, which rewards entrepreneurship and innovation, has provided the resources to safeguard democracy and freedom around the world for more than a century. It has been responsible for literally pulling untold billions of people around the world out of poverty. I am proud to be part of the Krach Institute which is committed to ensuring that this system and the technological innovation it fosters continue to thrive.\n\nWe live in an age when authoritarian regimes seize on novel technologies, and then use it to oppress their people and stop the flourishing of democracy. But America and other democracies can fight back with the same technologies, building a peaceful and prosperous future. The Institute is well-positioned to influence American diplomacy towards the idea of \"tech diplomacy\"—protecting us from rising threats from China, Russia and elsewhere.\n\nTechnology plays a vital role as it concerns U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy is also playing a vital role as it continues to educate and illuminate around the many issues that congregate at the tangled intersection of Trust, Policy and Tech as a fulcrum and forcing agent of Global Peace. The Institute's work is taking on new urgency in the current environment—authoritarian challenges, and the devastation that incursions unleash, are on full display right now in Ukraine. A stark reminder that now, more than ever, leadership is needed in the international arena. Keith Krach has embodied that spirit over the course of his career, and I am incredibly honored to align with Keith and the rest of this esteemed group as it seeks to leverage the best in technology to promote human advancement and freedoms worldwide.\n\nIn the realm of technology, the imperative to safeguard our citizens' lives and uphold the digital sovereignty of our nations, institutions, and individuals in cyberspace is paramount. However, it is incumbent upon our esteemed leaders and overseers within our institutions to recognize that cybersecurity cannot rely solely on technical prowess. This approach has inadvertently allowed for the proliferation of a $7.9 trillion cybercrime economy, a figure that eclipses the GDP of all but the United States and China.\n\nAt this juncture, where cybercrime demonstrates a staggering 15% annual growth while cybersecurity lags behind at less than two-thirds of that rate, authentic and comprehensive leadership is indispensable. Victory in this arena hinges on our leaders' adeptness in three key domains: technology, setting a model precedent from the apex of the hierarchy, and crafting a strategic vision.\n\nIt is with great honor and a profound sense of duty that I have answered the call to serve on the Advisory Council to The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue and concurrently serve as the inaugural Chairman of its Cyber Defense Advisory Council. Our nation and its citizens deserve no less a commitment.\n\nThe United States and the free world face a relentless technological assault from dangerous actors – the Communist Party of China foremost among them. Chinese ruler Xi Jinping is investing heavily in high tech because he sees it as the path to domination in the 21st century. A whole-of-society adoption of trusted technologies is the key to countering this technological threat and safeguarding freedom. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, by bringing together government, business, and civil society leaders, is helping to ensure the future is built on democratic values. I’m proud to contribute to its mission.\n\nThe future of the free world will be secured by the democratic use of technology to benefit all people and not dominated by autocrats. The Institute is a pioneer in bringing all partners and tools to bear on this existential challenge. There is no more time to waste.\n\nThe Krach Institute is in the vanguard of problem solving on the most critical economic and national security issues we face. I am pleased to join this unique endeavor committed to bringing together the best experts from the research community, private sector and policy makers to train, protect and promote our assets and interests especially in the field of biotechnology.\n\nScience fiction is becoming more and more science faction. Our world will be a different one by the end of the 20s. We are heading toward a future in which we measure everything that can be measured. \"It will be a world of exceptional, radical transparency,\" predict Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler in their New York Times bestseller, \"The Future is Faster than You Think.\" The opportunities in the new world will fascinate us. There is no question that deep tech offers great opportunities - but there are also risks lurking that should not be underestimated.\n\nHuman rights is often the point of the spear in Tech Diplomacy. When ingenious men and women collaborate to devise innovative solutions to practical problems, tech diplomacy is needed to protect both their interests and the common good. When unscrupulous governments and non-state actors use sophisticated technology to spy on or manipulate their trading partners and customers, tech diplomacy is needed to organize the opposition. As AI, synthetic biology, and the adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) threaten to upend our understanding of the key concepts of “life, liberty, and property”, human rights advocates will need to become sophisticated tech diplomats themselves. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue offers creative men and women a forum in which they can collaborate to devise humane and mutually beneficial solutions to thorny political problems. That, of course, is the essence of diplomacy! I am honored to join the Institute’s Advisory Council and look forward to contributing to its success.\n\nIn recent years it has become clear that technology in all forms will be a basis for diplomatic activities worldwide. This applies to both friendly and adversarial relations. Technology provides the basis for cooperation in all spheres. But it also offers challenges in the form of establishing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by our adversaries. The Krach Institute provides a forum in which Technology in all its dimensions can be considered in a thoughtful and coherent way. The Krach Institute offers leaders the opportunity to dialog and act to shape policy and practices that will assure continued US leadership in realizing a more secure future. Purdue is the ideal location for the Institute. The university clearly has a reputation for excellence in technology. And in recent years it has established itself as a leader in providing information that is vital to the formulation of policy on all fronts including food security to information security.\n\nHaving worked in the wireless industry since 1G in 1986, I’ve witnessed how technology has contributed to overall quality of life throughout the world with 2G (1991), 3G (2001), 4G (2010) and now 5G (2019). Societies are increasingly connected, increasingly mobile, and increasingly digital. Therefore, it is essential that networks continue to be secure, affordable, and supportive of free societies at scale, especially as we plan for 6G in the coming years. The current global effort to “open networks” (OpenRAN) must not only support these values, it can and should enable a new and robust supply chain for wireless networks that is based on software, cloud, and merchant silicon. This is a massive opportunity to further secure our national interests for decades to come.\n\nThe Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is at the cutting edge in exploring how to advance our national security through fostering diplomatic and security partnerships with like-minded nations while leveraging the ingenuity of the private sector to advance the technology that will ensure that we can successfully compete with and overcome those who would pose a threat to our citizens, our allies and our friends. The Krach Institute fills a critical need at a time when newly emboldened autocratic governments aggressively attempt to undermine our institutions and threaten the very foundations of our democracy.\n\nThe speed of innovation and technology continues to outpace legislation, and often the legislators themselves. The rules of engagement and war need to be updated to account for the technologies of today and the future. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy can serve as that critical bridge between the world’s most thoughtful and forward thinking tech leaders and the appropriate government officials.\n\nTech diplomacy is an essential tool of modern American statecraft to lead through our values and deliver innovation to solve the most pressing challenges of the 21st Century. From promoting understanding of advancements in biotechnology and the importance of securing supply chains to prepare for the next epidemic or pandemic, the Center is charting the path to ensure our nation’s policymakers and diplomats have the technical knowledge they need to represent U.S. and allied interests on the world stage.\n\nWinston Churchill warned us of the dangers of powerful technology in the wrong hands: “If we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue’s mission is to make sure that never happens – instead, to create the conditions so the wonders of science can help all of us, in the US and around the world, ensure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nWhile others may wring their hands about global technology competition, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy is doing something meaningful about it. Not just developed economies, but emerging markets are a new and fiercely competitive arena. Democracies must contend actively for our values in addition to innovation. By bringing together these realities, the Krach Institute is supporting fundamental, lasting strategic interests.\n\nWe are approaching one of those rare moments in history in which technological breakthroughs have the potential to fundamentally alter the course of human civilization. Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, bio-technology, and space exploration / exploitation are poised to increase the prosperity and health of all humanity. Unfortunately, these same technologies can be used to restrict human rights and spread dangerous ideologies. Free governments and industry must band together and develop standards so that we can collectively hold bad actors accountable and mitigate their misuse of these technologies. I am proud to be part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue which is leading this necessary alliance between policy makers, industry, and academia.\n\nAs Technology Networks continue to increase in bandwidth and global coverage (not to mention the accompanying evolution of AI and ML), the need for diplomacy between governments, corporations, and tech platforms has never been greater. Managing future technologies for the planet will require us all to work together to provide the trust and confidence in technology that we deserve.\n\nIn this era of great power competition and geopolitical instability, the development and deployment of democracy-promoting technologies by the US and its allies has become an increasingly vital form of statecraft. Use of technology as a tool for diplomacy is critical to protecting and advancing the global security priorities of the free world—and to empowering those who wish to be a part of it.\n\nAfter serving in senior economic policy positions in the U.S. government and in executive roles in the financial services sector, I have seen first-hand the critical importance of coordinated efforts among the U.S. government, our foreign allies, and global financial institutions to promote international development in parts of the world that are plagued by the predatory economic conduct of the Chinese Communist Party. I look forward to working with the Commission in outlining both defensive and offensive strategies to combat this behavior and promote vital U.S. national security interests.\n\nAcross history, diplomacy has revolved around the control of critical resources. Governments, ranging from ancient monarchies to modern democracies, have relied on it to gain or retain control over resources ranging from arable land to natural resources. The critical resource of the 21st Century is technology and diplomacy will be critical in determining who gets to define it, develop it, and deploy it.\n\nAs scientific innovation opens new frontiers, it’s critical that those discoveries serve humanity and are not weaponized by those with malicious intent towards us. Advanced technologies must be developed responsibly and trusted not to infringe on the universal rights of individuals. The Trust Doctrine at the heart of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy is the right approach toward building a better and safer world. I am thrilled to join the Institute’s Advisory Council and look forward to contributing toward its important mission.\n\nTechnology and diplomacy are two words that one does not often hear together. But that is changing, and here at the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, we are leading that change. Our goal is to expand American leaders’ professional capabilities and equip them to advocate for America’s role as the world’s leading innovator and developer of technologies that improve life for everyone, no matter where they live. We also work closely with leaders from allied countries to partner in the universal cause of freedom through the deployment of technology. Diplomatic engagement on critical, cutting-edge technologies is more important now than ever.\n\nThe strategic importance of space and near-space technologies for the US cannot be overstated, as it is impossible to envision US national security and economic prosperity without a commitment to ensuring its access to space. If the US fails to lead all aspects of space, including satellite communications, reconnaissance, surveillance, natural resource exploration and acquisition, zero-gravity manufacturing, earth observation, lunar and cislunar exploration and operations, planetary exploration and operations and astrophysical observations, the result would have dire implications for many US industries—such as commercial, financial services, health care, and media—as well as military operations.\n\nGood diplomacy avoids conflicts and wars. The world today needs transformational leaders who can think creatively and compassionately to drive good diplomacy and make the world and the planet a safe and thriving place for all. By leveraging the power of technology and mentorship at scale, we will create, grow and deploy transformational leaders globally and bring to fruition the full promise of freedom, along with its ability to spur healthy growth and peace. I am honored to be invited to join the Advisory Council of KITDP and look forward to contributing towards its mission\n\nInnovation is crucial to America’s mission to advance freedom globally. Our adversaries actively seek to steal our innovations any way they can. I experienced first hand as our laptops were disassembled with goal of copying all memory systems while our team was occupied with our Chinese “hosts”. I am proud to be a part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue and fully support this mission.\n\nWe live in an interconnected world and technology is such a powerful tool that continues to be weaponized by many seeking absolute power. The 21st century continues to redefine our geopolitical borders – which also includes technology, and I’m honored to be joining others to reach across borders and use technology for the common good. Never have the lines been more blurred to build diplomatic relationships with other countries who share a common interest: to place our people and values at the forefront and ensure the safety and security of all involved.\n\nTelecom CEOs need to know what is in the technology they install in their networks. Built upon non-partisan tech statecraft and global partnerships, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue's Clean Network initiative provides industry leaders a way they can trust that the hardware and softwaфTelecom CEOs need to know what is in the technology they install in their networks. Built upon non-partisan tech statecraft and global partnerships, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue's Clean Network initiative provides industry leaders a way they can trust that the hardware and software they use for fifth- and future-generation mobile networks will advance democratic values and principles.\n\nAs the former Israeli national security advisor and a physicist who managed governmental technology units and projects - I am particularly attentive to the opportunities and risks of advanced technologies to the national security of liberal democracies. Our innovative cultures have handed the world the most sophisticated and creative platforms, but at the same time our shared liberal values provide our adversaries with the methods to infiltrate our societies and crumble us from within. It is time to find solutions to mitigate those risks while keeping the tech eco-systems vibrant and productive. It is the responsibility of us all, governments, institutions and companies, to act before it's too late.\n\nIn Taiwan, we traditionally looked at the development of high-tech industry from the mere perspectives of science and technology. However, with the changes in international geopolitics, science and technology have crossed national borders and transcended the gap amongst people and policies that ultimately bring impacts on society stability, diplomacy and mutual trust. It becomes clear therefore that in Taiwan’s next phase of high tech development, we cannot ignore the connections and effects in other related disciplines resulting from the advancement of science and technology, such as laws and regulations, finances and managements, social impacts, global relationships, etc. Consequently, as a higher education institution we must also conduct education and research in these highly specific but relevant fields critical to technology-driven industrial transformation.\n\nAmerican technology and innovation has been a key strategy in making the United States the world’s foremost superpower. Countries around the world continue to chase us to try and negate this tremendous advantage. It is imperative that we not only maintain the advantage but expand it. We must continue to be in a position of strength in technology and innovation. I am excited that the Krach Institute for Technology is laser focused on ensuring Tech Diplomacy remains a critical component in ensuring America’s strength, both now and in the future.\n\nSince its founding, the Krach Institute has brought innovators and policymakers together to ensure emerging technologies are used to advance freedom, safety, and prosperity around the world. I am honored to be able to contribute to this mission. We have only scratched the surface of Artificial Intelligence and the importance it has for protecting our nation. Our ability to not only advance this technology, but also operationalize it, is critical to keep us ahead of our adversaries.\n\nEvery day, technology weaves itself deeper into our individual lives and society at large. The technology decisions we make now - across hardware, software and policy - have larger and longer reaching implications than ever before. As a technology leader, I believe in a Human First approach to decision-making that requires an ecosystem of trust and safety. I am honored to join the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, where the very best of technology and policy leadership are partnering to leverage State Techcraft as a competitive advantage.\n\nThe ever-expanding nature of technology is vastly changing the way we look at international relations, trust, and transparency. As new technologies emerge at an increasing rate, we need to ensure a vibrant innovation ecosystem exists that has trust and transparency at its core. This will ensure that the same value-system that created the semiconductor, put a man on the moon, and brought us the internet, will continue to thrive into the 22nd century. I am humbled to be part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue’s efforts that is filling this critical role at the cross-roads of diplomacy and innovation.\n\nI am passionate about the intersection of agriculture and technology and a strong believer that agriculture is the most important industry on Earth. So much of the future success of agriculture relies on strong global diplomacy. Technology is changing so rapidly that it's hard for leaders to keep up. It's important to be focused on how to make technology work for the world, not against.\n\nCritical and emerging technologies, such as 5G/6G, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum computing, will play a central role in the future of our national security and economic well-being. At the same time, there will be fierce competition among the United States, China, and others in the development of these technologies. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue has assembled a combination of academic and research experts, private sector entrepreneurs, and former senior government officials to help shape U.S. policy and diplomacy on the application and use of these technologies. I am pleased to join this impressive group.\n\nTrusted technology is the epitome of why it is critical to strengthen US leadership, especially technological leadership in both official and private sectors. For example, the claims of China and Russia about respecting national sovereignty ring hollow in seeing their unjustified treatment of Ukraine. Trusted technology enhances a strategic approach that leverages the strengths of allies and partners along with the United States to safeguard the free, open, and rules-based international order.\n\nSilicon Valley once again finds itself in a 'gold rush' moment -- with advances in AI and machine learning capturing the attention and imagination of some of the brightest minds in our industry. In the right hands, this innovation represents so much potential for the benefit of humankind. In the wrong hands, these models can be tuned for nefarious means that threaten the freedoms and prosperity of civilization across the globe. I'm thrilled to have been invited to lend my voice to the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy in order to play a small role in unlocking the potential and protecting against the abuse of the next generation of innovation in technology.\n\nThe Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue offers a different way to rethink our relation to power from a geopolitical point of view. Today, women in tech is crucial not only to reconsider rights equality in the world but above all because it touches feminist diplomacy. It is with pride that I will contribute to this important mission to reconsider governments regarding women's rights implications to Tech Diplomacy around the world through accessibility, visibility, and gender equality.\n\nWith the powerful advances we continue to see in technology, tech diplomacy is as important as ever in the mission to safeguard democracy and human rights. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy is at the forefront of this critical work to ensure technology is being used as a force of good for all.\n\nAmid the growing geopolitical dynamics in Asia, the U.S-Korea partnership has become ever more paramount in ensuring regional economic security. Korea is one of the first countries to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), stepping up its regional role to safeguard liberal democracy. In this light, AMCHAM appreciates the Global Tech Security Commission’s mission to promote strategic collaboration in key emerging technologies from U.S. allies and partners. I firmly believe that the Commission’s bipartisan and global scope would allow for significant thought leadership and business strategies to be formed across sectors. As the Global Tech Security’s Commissioner representing Korea, we look forward to doing our best at AMCHAM to identify opportunities to enhance the economic and security alliance between the United States and Korea.\n\nThe nation has long been served by think tanks advocating for foreign and domestic policies that can help safeguard the security of our nation and that of other democracies. More recently the technology sector has begun to turn its attention to its role as a proponent of similar policies. But not until the establishment of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy have statecraft and technological expertise been brought together as tools with which to think through and advocate for strategies that can lead to a more secure future for the nation and the free world. This melding of politics and technology could not be timelier. It is an honor to serve on the advisory council of a center with such a noble cause and with such a committed team of present and former leaders in government, technology, academia, and the private sector.\n\nThe wellsprings of technology leadership that have consistently emerged in many countries can in some measure be linked to underlying commitments to core principles. These include, inviolable democratic institutions, deep and transparent capital markets, rule of law, protection of technology IP, and established norms of international free trade. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue provides an important resource for the ongoing dialogue around the complex cross currents involved in key areas of technology, economic vibrancy, and global stability.\n\nIceland hosts the most diverse set of terrestrial analogs of the Moon, Mars and other planetary bodies that all sit in close proximity to one another and to both critical infrastructure and local expertise. Space research has an impact on all sectors because space exploration is not just about leaving Earth, it is a re-affirmation of how humanity can work together to develop the innovative technologies to better understand our own planet, our place in the solar system, and how we can better utilize the natural resources we often take for granted. It is my hope through our work at the Iceland Space Agency, we can contribute to a more sustainable path for society, together reaching for the stars while fostering a better understanding, and conservation for the earth beneath our feet.\n\nTechnology is driving rapid change across the world. It impacts how we communicate, how we work, how we deliver healthcare, and how we build communities. Longstanding systems of global governance are changing as a result. Transformational leadership is needed to adapt our world and safely drive forward change that aligns with a tech-driven world. That’s what the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is uniquely positioned to do and why I’m honored to be part of the Institute’s efforts.\n\nIndustry is the battlespace of great power competition in the 21st century. Nation-states are leveraging cutting-edge technology, talent, and supply chains to advance their economic and military objectives. I’m grateful to be a part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue's efforts to marshal the capacity of industry leadership and define the path forward for America and our allies to compete and prevail in this battle.\n\nAt its best, technology can enhance human rights, worker rights, productivity, and environmental justice. When abused, it can exacerbate income inequality, disrupt critical supply chain deployment, and undermine the freedoms that lead to shared prosperity and security in the global economy. By focusing on the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue's core belief that technology must advance freedom, we can help assure that developed and developing nations move on the right path.\n\nTechnology influences our daily lives from the moment we wake up until the time we go to sleep. We must make sure it advances our shared ideals, or President Reagan’s words may become a reality: “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction… It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.”\n\nWith 30 years as a national security veteran, career U.S. State Department diplomat, and business leader, I'm certain that there has never been a more consequential or complex time than right now to protect our critical technologies from extreme threat. Industry and Government - along with our Allies, and Partners - MUST work together, quickly, on every front to deter our adversaries. It's the only way to maintain free, democratic societies where humankind can flourish. I'm deeply honored to serve on the Advisory Council with so many like-minded leaders who share this mission.\n\nTech Diplomacy is the next frontier on the world stage and no surprise that Keith Krach is at the forefront. The battlefield has changed and the weapons of the future are all about the underlying technology. The power will reside with those who master emerging technologies like AI/ML, Blockchain, and Quantum . It is a matter of our national security that we are the superpower of the future leading the innovation in these critical areas. We are fortunate to have the leadership efforts of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue University.\n\nThe development of trusted relationships for diplomacy is critical, and should happen on an ongoing basis. Waiting for a crisis or conflict to trigger diplomatic efforts can lead to urgent problems with lengthy, costly solutions. I see the need for diplomacy to become focused on specialized areas, such as economics, supply chain, and technology. While these areas have some aspects in common, in many ways they are quite different, and can evolve rapidly. Current domain expertise can be the key to creating a solution that will not only sound good on paper, but also actually work. I'm in support of existing efforts, such as the Clean Network, but believe we still have more work to do. America's dependency on other countries for key materials, such as semiconductors, could put our economy at risk. As a member of the advisory board, I look forward to helping our country be proactive in addressing potential technological risks.\n\nThe global pursuit of innovation, technological advancements and science-based capacities of a nation can be directly correlated to that nation’s international clout and status in the world arena of influence and impact. Innovative advances through public and private efforts help define the interests of a nation’s foreign policy. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue understands this delicate balance and is committed to innovation and strategic discussions that advance the interests and standing of the United States on the world stage.\n\nIn today's dynamic and often turbulent world, preserving and strengthening America's ability to compete in critical enabling technologies ensures our nation's economic vitality and national security. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is at the forefront of ensuring these goals. I am honored to be part of the Institute, and look forward to ensuring that the intersection of technology and U.S. foreign policy remains a key tool in strengthening our country's competitiveness and security globally.\n\nIt is vital to American national security and to the liberties of our citizens that we retain the commanding heights of technological innovation in this century. I am honored to be part of the effort by the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue University to study how we can use diplomacy to preserve the country’s technological edge in an era of great-power competition.\n\nTechnology has the power to empower citizens and enhance their quality of life by enabling them to live more freely and abundantly. It can also help nations prosper and safeguard their democratic institutions. However, authoritarian regimes are leveraging technology to establish their own competing techno-autocratic global order. To equip technologists and policymakers with the knowledge and confidence needed to confront the imminent threats of technology fragmentation and geopolitical conflicts, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue will be well positioned to be the meeting point for critical thinking and strategic collaboration.\n\nI am proud of my alma mater, Purdue University, for supporting the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy which will lead the way on the most crucial work at the intersection of technology and U.S. foreign policy. Technology is often a double-edged sword because it can advance democratic movements while simultaneously benefiting adversaries of democracy. The power of this Institute is that it understands those trade-offs and offers the world a functional set of principles that value freedom, liberty, and the rule of law. Fundamental values ought to be factored into the way we design, use, and deploy technologies for the preservation of classical liberal democracy and free market capitalism.\n\nTrust, the bedrock of our liberal democracy, coupled with technology have been two core elements that determined the progress of our democratic societies. But today, we live in a new transformational geopolitical reality, where distrust is accelerating and the clash over technology supremacy is mounting. Therefore, the KITDP is strategically positioned to help counter authoritarianism by integrating non-tech with tech tools in an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving digital battle. Moreover, tech statecraft and the return of trust are fundamental for American leadership to win this strategic competition while harnessing the best of new technologies to defend our peace and prosperity, our Western civilization, and the free world to prevail over authoritarianism. I am truly delighted to be asked to serve alongside such illustrious luminaries and to contribute to KITDP's noble mission.\n\nWestern ideas, technology, and money have been trusted and respected throughout the world for decades because the values, liberties, and security they represent are enshrined in the rule of law and guarantees of inalienable rights. In the 21st century, extending those laws and rights to the digital domain—first among them, digital privacy—is essential to sustaining and preserving modern democratic societies. This vital, urgent work is among the most consequential challenges in the next 25 years; if we don’t get this right, the digital frontier will be forfeit to autocrats and anarchists who today freely corrupt and malign it toward their ends.\n\nForeign adversaries are using technology to spy, steal, cheat, and sow authoritarianism around the world. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is ensuring that America counters this with our own diplomatic outreach rooted in principles of trust, democracy, and human rights. There is no one better to lead the education of our next generation of tech diplomats than Keith Krach, who has unmatched experience in both technology and diplomacy. It's an honor to be a part of his mission.\n\nThe signing of the Abraham Accords and the passing of the CHIPS Act are powerful examples of a new paradigm: Economic and Technology Collaboration is stronger than partisan division and sectarian strife. I was honored to leverage my semiconductor leadership experience to collaborate with Keith at the U.S. Department of State, to improve the Economic Health and National Security of the Semiconductor Value-Chain. I am again looking forward to collaboration in Semiconductors and the Clean Energy Transition to advance freedom and security as an Advisory Council member at the Krach Institute.\n\nAs has always been the case in America, private companies are the lead innovators and researchers keeping us one step ahead of global competition. Nowhere is this more evident than the tech sector. I’m proud to be part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, where they are doing crucial work at the intersection of technology and U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe profound changes to the settled scientific, technological and legal order in the world demand a new way forward in diplomacy. The path is to dig into the scientific, technological, and legal aspects of major diplomatic problems to solve them in a creative, multidisciplinary way. When law, science and technology meet, solutions can be found that are not available from any singular analytical stovepipe.\n\nThe peace and prosperity of the future will be secured by advances in technology. It is vital that the United States lead with bold and principled diplomacy to unite free societies and ensure these powerful tools are used to improve the world while preventing our enemies from unleashing even greater terrors. The fate of tomorrow's wars will be determined by how we leverage technological diplomacy today.\n\nRussia and China continue to seek means to exploit free-market economies to advance their geopolitical ambitions. These aggressor states utilize economic statecraft to close the technology gap that exists between them and democratic nations. To counter this aggression, the United States must harmonize its Diplomacy, Information, Military, and Economic strategies to protect the technological advantages that have for over a century enabled American prosperity and security. The Krach Institute for Technology Diplomacy serves as a critical conduit in this endeavor for policy makers, industry leaders, and academics to craft and promote solutions to advance America’s foreign policy and national security interests.\n\nWith authoritarian regimes gaining a lead in emerging technologies, it is not only urgent but imperative for like-minded democracies to unite and protect democratic values. The tech-based partnership carved out by these democratic powers will expand their advantage and decisively tilt the balance in their favour. The Global Tech Security Commission (GTSC) can significantly contribute to advancing this effort. India, with its unique civilisational ethos, experience in tackling the China challenge in its closest proximity, and tech power in its own right, will be a significant stakeholder in this engagement. I am, therefore, extremely privileged to be part of the GTSC.\n\nI am excited to participate and contribute to this noble cause! My career has blessed me with opportunities to be the part of many technology revolutions, and several needed to be carefully navigated to ensure that the technology was used solely for the benefit of industry, society, and individuals. Most recently, with digital process transformation, digital identity, and cyber-security, I have seen how bad actors can use technology for fraud and to harm individuals (theft, trafficking, smuggling, money laundering, etc.). Through the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, I will endeavor to use this experience and professional network to help stake holders foster, proliferate, and protect innovation for the good of all.\n\nIt's a pleasure to be able to join such a distinguished group at the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. New technologies like 5G networks increasingly enable and control every aspect of our lives, and it's critical that we include them in our considerations of how we can secure our freedom and maintain peaceful relationships with countries around the world. Recent events in China, Ukraine and elsewhere demonstrate the importance of reliable, trustworthy networks, and the power of providing or restricting access to technology in the prevention of state aggression in the world. The Institute can play a role in our understanding and successful management of such national security imperatives.\n\nBringing the skill of US diplomacy together with the power of the tech industry to create a new category of 'tech statecraft' is a pairing of art and science like never before, and one that -- thanks to the leadership of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue -- will serve to advance democracy, trust and freedom around the world.\n\nIntegrity, accountability, and transparency are essential to governing new technologies in a way that cultivates human flourishing. The Chinese Communist Party relentlessly pursues an ulterior proposition: the global extension of ubiquitous surveillance and arbitrary manipulation to serve its own corrosive ideological purposes. Safeguarding the future of the international digital world is a multigenerational endeavor demanding farsighted leadership, operational savvy, and stronger bonds between technologists and diplomats in likeminded nations. It is a privilege to support Under Secretary Krach in pioneering the emergent terrain of trusted technology policy.\n\nThe Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy (KITD) at Purdue offers a unique and timely melding of Silicon Valley strategies, foreign policy tools and technology into tech statecraft which not only is forward thinking but forward leading. History shows Purdue University as a 20th century leader in many fields and dimensions of engineering and science; similarly KITD at Purdue will be acknowledged for its world-renowned leadership and strength that leverages Purdues STEM expertise with policy while demonstrating impact to our country and the world.\n\nA mentor told me once: 'Pavel, all abdicated responsibility will be taken by tyrants and used against you'. In a brand new world, where cyber, AI, quantum computing, 5G and disinformation are new battlegrounds where totalitarian regimes are fighting against freedom and democratic values, we, the people of the free world, are obliged to never abdicate from the responsibility to expose and fight against these regimes and the tyrants behind them. Never stop fighting! Never stop protecting our core democratic values! The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is an authentic powerhouse to fight for the freedom of our people, among the best tech and diplomacy experts across our like-minded nations. It honors me to be part of the KITDP family.\n\nThe United States stands firm as the global model for the greatness that can be achieved when the people of a nation are free to express their beliefs, advance their talents, and to pursue their passions. Our technological achievements exemplify this, and effective diplomatic outreach is critical to shine a spotlight on this model for the world to see. The incredible technological advancements of our time must be leveraged to further freedom and democratic values, rather than to suppress them as we are seeing in some parts of the world. This is why the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is so vital. Together, we can and must leverage technology to build and maintain peaceful relationships that embrace freedom globally.\n\nThe defining feature of 21st Century foreign policy is an understanding of how to use all the tools of national power. Never before have economic and national security challenges been so heavily focused on establishing and maintaining supply chain security, critical and emerging technology dominance, and economic resilience. The Krach Institute is the leading forum for senior policymakers, lawmakers, and business leaders to identify, discuss, and create meaningful solutions to America’s most consequential problems. The work done by the Krach Institute will help the US maintain and grow its dominance in these areas; not just for the well-being of the United States, but for the entire free world. It’s an honor to serve on the Advisory Council as we work towards finding solutions which make the world a safer, freer, and more prosperous place.\n\nAs technology transforms our world at a rapid pace and in extremely powerful ways, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue is at the forefront in ensuring that leaders and influencers are equipped with the knowledge and insights on complex issues and emerging sectors to do what is right for our economic and national security.\n\nTechnology diplomacy is, at its core, the ability to harness creative innovation into tools that promote global freedom and enable collaboration amongst like-minded societies. When nations join together to combat autocracies tech diplomacy is a necessary first step in setting a trust standard by which no country is excluded, and all who agree to its tenants should be welcome. It is this trust standard in tech diplomacy that binds nations together and I am proud to join with some of our nation's top experts at The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy in its mission to provide the training and expertise necessary to advance freedom.\n\nI am honored to join the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy advisory board at Purdue. Our country’s leadership both needs and depends on a deep understanding of how technology drives our military, economy, and world position. The Krach Institute can help bridge understanding gaps and provide thought leadership on national strategy and policy. The Krach Institute understands that sustained technology leadership is critical to reverse the global democratic decline and supporting Western values. I am honored to take part in that effort.\n\nTechnology continues to propel each of us into new areas of knowledge and opportunity. It is an honor to be a part of Purdue’s Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy as it leads the way in educating and informing government leaders about emerging technologies, giving them the necessary tools to employ this knowledge across the globe for good, especially for freedom and opportunity.\n\nIt is an honor to serve as an advisor to America's first \"tech tank.\" The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue understands that technology is a key driver of political and economic developments. America's ability to innovate, harness, and deploy technologies that support free markets and liberty are among the most important challenges we face as a nation. Similar challenges face our allies and partners around the world. The Institute combines the principles of Keith Krach's Clean Network, combined with Purdue's extraordinary engineering and scientific expertise, to advance ideas to ensure that America, its Allies, and its partners, remain strong and free well into the future.\n\nAwareness of the truly extensive and global nature of our supply chain has never been higher as the pandemic caused major disruptions in the flow and availability of goods worldwide. Therefore, fundamental and foundational to a winning global tech security strategy is the establishment of a trusted, transparent, and secure global supply chain network whose participants are all aligned against the key values of freedom and democracy and are dedicated to the development of the trusted relationships that make it all work.\n\nAmerica fueled tech innovation in the 20th century. To continue to reap the benefits that come with tech advancements, we must continue to lead—both in research, development, and innovation and, as importantly, in defining the principles and values for leveraging these technologies globally. To do this, our nation's leaders must foster an environment where tech can succeed here at home, while ensuring our diplomats abroad are clear-eyed as to how foundational and emerging technologies should and should not be leveraged and are skilled at advancing tech-objectives for freedom and prosperity.\n\nI am honored to be on the Advisory Council of the Center for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. It is not only timely but essential that an organized effort be formed to help US policymakers understand technology and associated trends in an unbiased forum. It is equally important that technologists understand the impact of their innovations on society and gain a new perspective on the positive role policy can play in developing and deploying technology. The Center’s mission to build this bridge is essential to the future of US’ semiconductor industry.\n\nAs we in the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China have shown, there has never been a more important time to come together as democracies to focus on China. That is why efforts like the Global Tech Security Commission are so important. I’m looking forward to getting to work, ensuring that technology advances a level playing field for all, and protects our cherished freedoms.\n\nWith the growth of the Internet has come an evolution in the connectedness of people across the globe. This has led to policy and governance issues that require understanding of the norms and principles of free nations as well as the technology that influences them today. Government is wholly incapable of navigating these issues alone, and authoritarian regimes are driving technology and policies towards their desired outcomes. To preserve liberty the Global Tech Security Commission and other private and public institutions must work together to derive both technology standards and policies, or watch as the world continues its descent towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy calls the People’s Republic of China the 'Pacing Threat', in large part because most of the US government outside Defense has been trying to cooperate with China, while Beijing has long called the US 'the high-tech enemy.' The Global Tech Security Commission is an important step toward putting the relationship on an appropriate footing; the US must stop helping the PRC defeat us.\n\nDriving innovation in science and technology is a strategic advantage to the U.S. and its allies. Now more than ever, we must bridge the gap between innovators and policymakers, ensuring decisions are informed and timely. This collaboration will stimulate the creation of trusted technologies and reliable supply chains necessary for addressing humanity’s most pressing challenges. As part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, I am proud to contribute to our mission of navigating global complexities and improving lives worldwide.\n\nI was honored to serve with Keith Krach at the State Department and am now delighted to join him and the team at the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy in their vital work.

There is an urgent need to protect freedom and advance democratic principles globally. I have had the privilege of working with Keith, as well as the new Director Michelle Giuda, to elevate and advance these issues through my work at Concordia. I stand ready to support Keith and Michelle in carrying this important mission forward.\n\nIt is both an honor and privilege to be able to continue to serve the United States’ as part of this innovative approach to foreign policy. Having served as a career Marine officer I have a keen appreciation for technology enabled solutions such as the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy. This organization serves as a beacon for future diplomatic initiatives that will allow the United States to defeat its adversaries and maintain its global leadership role.\n\nMaking complex quantum systems work is the type of challenge that engineers live for — and one that makes a big difference in the world. From foundational science discoveries to combating climate change, quantum engineers are going to build the systems that enable a new range of technologies if we put in the work today, in growing the foundations and depth of the field and the community.\n\nFor many years from afar, I have admired Keith Krach and the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue University. Recently, I have been fortunate to be drawn closer to this impressive orbit as a part of the ongoing Global Tech Security Commission led by the Krach Institute and the Atlantic Council. I have been thoroughly impressed with the rigor that is being applied by the commission to craft and implement a global tech security strategy to secure a free, open, prosperous and secure international order. I am deeply honored and privileged to be a part of that commission and this advisory council.\n\nThere is no more important mission for the United States than reclaiming our heritage as the world’s leader in technology and manufacturing. Through reinvesting in domestic technology ecosystems, strategically building supply chains with international allies and partners, and obviating the technological leverage of malign international actors, the United States can again lead through innovation. The Krach Institute is on the leading edge of this mission and is a pioneer in building the future for America’s technology diplomacy.\n\nI am honored to join the advisory council for the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. More than ever, lawyers and policymakers need to have a deep understanding of the ways technology and law intersect and how digital tools are shaping twenty-first century practice. At Georgetown Law, we are pushing the tech policy conversation forward through training that demonstrates the inextricable links between technology advances and diplomatic matters. Our mission is synergistic with the work of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy, which is establishing itself as the leader in using trusted technologies to advance freedom. I applaud Keith Krach for his leadership of this extraordinary initiative, and I look forward to being part of the Institute's efforts.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy stands as a beacon of collaboration and innovation. By seamlessly integrating education into its mission, the institute empowers the next generation of leaders to harness technology for the greater good. As we navigate the complexities of a digital world, let us remember that knowledge is our most powerful tool, and the Krach Institute lights the path toward a future where technology serves humanity.\n\nInnovation and excellence in science and technology is a strategic advantage to the US and its allies in emerging tech sectors. Connecting like-minded groups to accelerate the development of commercially viable cutting-edge technology has never been more important than the present to address and overcome the challenges facing humanity today. Fundamental to this process is reducing the knowledge and experience gaps between innovators and policymakers leading to more informed decisions and ultimately driving results which positively impact the lives of everyone at a global level.\n\nAs cyberspace has become an important component of the international system, rival ideologies about cybersecurity and exercise of power in cyberspace require us to understand how cybersecurity is harnessed in service to various countries’ national interests and strategies. It’s vital that we bring sound policy analysis to our understanding of how cyber is remaking the international system, and what will be the role of our country and its partners and allies- in sustaining our interests in that system. The convergence of space and cyber systems and the dramatic growth of the global space economy make even more urgent our development of this understanding\n\nI am honored to be a part of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy and to be able to play a role in advancing technology diplomacy. The intersection of technology, academia, and policy is an important place to be during this pivotal moment and I am excited to participate in driving this conversation forward and am looking forward to using our platform to create opportunities for people to contribute in meaningful ways.\n\nWith technology advancing at an unprecedented and ever-increasing rate, the need for effective tech diplomacy and policy has never been more vital to the advancement of democratic principles around the globe and to our national security. I am honored to be part of the important contributions the Krach Institute is making in this arena.\n\nIt’s an honor to serve as an advisor to the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. As the head of state for the Republic of Palau, I witness firsthand the struggle for supremacy among those with economic, strategic, or military interest in the Indo-Pacific region. Palau remains a close ally of the United States and a voice for the democratic rule of law against authoritarian regimes. Technology will play a critical role in the enduring freedom of our region, and I’m proud to partner with Krach Institute to foster our shared ideals.\n\nIt’s a Herculean mission to nurture and harness the use of rapidly accelerating technologies for the good, prosperity and ultimately the freedom of mankind while safeguarding these technologies from potentially catastrophic use by bad actors. At the forefront is the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue (KITDP), providing focus, research, education and urgency in bi-partisan collaboration between private and public sectors globally. Under Keith Krach’s leadership KITDP is destined for exceptional success and am honored to help support the Institute’s work.\n\nTechnology exists to help enable societal aspirations in achieving the freedom to live, love and learn. More than at any point in history, technology offers us all the potential to be better and to do better. The Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy is an innovative organization that is turning the eyes of America’s protectors to critical technologies that can improve the human condition, while ensuring our country’s safety and security. I am proud to have been selected to be part of the Institute's mission.\n\nI think it's really important what the Krach Institute is doing on technology and diplomacy because the two things have to go together to make it work correctly. And it's not just saying technology, diplomacy. You have to teach people how to do that. I think being an intentional learner as well as intentional in terms of the institute's ability to help people learn about diplomacy and the right application of technology is extremely important.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has already proven adept at exploiting technology to spy on, steal from, and threaten Americans. America's security, economic prosperity, and global standing depends in large part on making sure the CCP cannot control the commanding heights of critical technologies and expand its techno-authoritarianism around the globe. I'm proud to join the Krach Institute Advisory Council to help ensure that the world's tech ecosystems are purpose-built conduits for freedom, national security, and prosperity.\n\nThe technology that permeates every facet of our lives can either be used as a tool for freedom and empowerment or wielded as an instrument for control and domination. We need leaders who understand both the potential and perils of technology and can direct these powerful tools toward the creation of a safer, more vibrant world.\n\nAs the technology competition with countries of particular concern has become increasingly serious from the strategic viewpoint, it becomes more important than ever to explore and share the strategic plan among the like-minded countries, I am very honored to contribute to developing the strategy on how Japan and its allies should meet this challenge as a Commissioner for Japan of the Global Tech Security Commission.\n\nThe bedrock of freedom and democracy is truth, free speech and transparency. I am proud to work with the Krach Institute to advance the values of democracy through effectively communicating the realities of technology, energy and climate change. Communist, socialist and authoritarian states undermine democracy and individual rights and freedoms. The national security interests of the United States and like minded democracies are impaired if the disinformation and propaganda of such authoritarian regimes is not exposed."
