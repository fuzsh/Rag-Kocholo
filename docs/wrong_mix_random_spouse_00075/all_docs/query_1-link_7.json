        "text": "Mi’kmaq Grand Council\n\nMade up of male representatives from across Mi’kmaq territory, the council is governed by a grand chief and rules by consensus. The role of chieftain is often handed down from father to son. (Note: The exact date of this event is unknown. The date provided here is an estimate.)\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nHart Elected\n\nEzekiel Hart was the first Jewish politician to be elected in Québec (Lower Canada at the time), in Trois-Rivières. The session of the Assembly was coming to an end and Hart had to wait until January 1808 to be sworn in. He eschewed the Christian Oath of Office and was denied his seat.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nResponsible Government in Nova Scotia\n\nJames Boyle Uniake became leader of a new Reform government. Nova Scotia was thus the first colony in the British Empire in which responsible government was in effect. Responsible government meant that a colony enjoyed complete self-government in domestic affairs and that a government ruled only with the support of the majority of the elected Assembly (the origins of today's cabinet government).\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nGradual Civilization Act Passed in the Province of Canada\n\nThe government attempts to assimilate First Nations men by offering them the right to vote if they voluntarily enfranchise. This means giving up rights, including treaty rights. Only one person elects to do so under this Act. (See also Indigenous Peoples in Canadian Law.)\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nLondon Conference\n\nSixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick met with the British government in London, England. During the three month conference, delegates reviewed the Québec Resolutions — creating a document that would form the basis of the British North America Act — chose \"Canada\" as the name of the new country and designated it a Dominion.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nCapital of the North-West Territories Shifts\n\nThe capital of the North-West Territories (the future Alberta and Saskatchewan) shifted from Battleford to Pile O' Bones (Regina). Cree hunters harvested buffalo in the region and stacked the bones of their quarry in piles roughly 2 m tall by 12 m in diameter. The Cree believed that buffalo herds would return to visit these bones, and so named the area Oskana-Ka-asateki, \"the place where bones are piled.\"\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of C.D. Howe\n\nBusinessman and politician C.D. Howe was born at Waltham, Massachusetts. Howe’s engineering career took off in Canada, where he founded a Prairie-based construction company that became an international success. During the Depression, he turned his attention to politics. In Parliament, he headed so many portfolios that he was known as the “Minister of Ministers.” Howe initiated many of the nation-building and economic projects that brought Canada fully into the 20th century.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nEdmonton Incorporated\n\nFirst established in 1795 as a Hudson’s Bay Company post, Edmonton was on this day incorporated as a city. The following year, it was chosen as capital for the freshly minted Province of Alberta. Today, it is the northernmost North American city with a population over one million.\n\nInternational politics\n\nLeon Trotsky Held Prisoner in Nova Scotia\n\nRussian socialist Leon Trotsky was a prisoner at the Amherst internment camp in Nova Scotia in April 1917. Amherst was the largest internment camp in Canada during the First World War, with a maximum capacity of about 850 men. While most camps housed “enemy aliens,” most internees at Amherst were German prisoners of war. (See also Prisoner of War Camps in Canada.)\n\nPeople Provincial Politics\n\nBirth of Gilles Lamontagne\n\nFormer Québec City mayor and federal Member of Parliament Gilles Lamontagne was born in Montréal. Lamontagne served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War and survived two years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over the Netherlands. In addition to his tenure as mayor of Québec City from 1965 to 1977, his distinguished political career included positions as defence minister in Pierre Trudeau’s Liberal government and as lieutenant-governor of Québec. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nDominion Elections Act\n\nThe Dominion Elections Act enfranchised many of those who had been disenfranchised during the First World War, such as those originating from countries with which Canada had been at war. However, the Act stated that anyone who was disenfranchised by provincial legislation because of race would remain disenfranchised from the federal vote. This included persons of Chinese origin in Saskatchewan, and those of Indigenous, Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian origins in British Columbia.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nParlby Elected\n\nIrene Parlby was elected to the Alberta Legislature, representing Lacombe in the United Farmers of Alberta government. She was subsequently named to Cabinet, as minister without portfolio. Parlby was only the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial office. She was particularly active on issues related to public health care, improved wages for working women and married women's property rights.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nBirth of Jacques Parizeau\n\nJacques Parizeau, who nearly led Québec to sovereignty in the 1995 referendum as premier and head of the Parti Québécois, was born in Montréal. An economist by training, Parizeau was a key figure in the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, helping to establish public institutions such as the Québec Pension Plan and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nBennett Outlines New Deal\n\nWith Canadians suffering from coast to coast, Conservative prime minister R.B. Bennett made the first of five radio broadcasts to address the state of the nation, which was deep in the Great Depression. Called The Premier Speaks to the People, Bennett’s address was broadcast across 38 stations. The legislation he proposed became known as Canada’s “New Deal.” It was reported that Bennett paid for the airtime, approximately $10,000, out of his own pocket.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nJapanese Relocation\n\nFollowing the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbour, the federal government interns 22,000 Japanese men, women and children in British Columbia for the remainder of the war. The government apologizes for Japanese internment in 1988. Similar actions had taken place in 1914, with the internment of nationals from Germany, and the Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Empires.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nFlag of Québec (the Fleurdelisé)\n\nQuébec’s flag, the Fleurdelisé, was flown for the first time at centre tower of the Québec Parliament Building in Québec City. The Québec government adopted the Fleurdelisé during the administration of Maurice Duplessis. It was the first provincial flag officially adopted in Canada. Maurice Duplessis proclaimed the fleur de lis as the official emblem of Québec. After more than 50 years, the controversy continues as botanists insist that the flowers on the flag are not lilies but irises, which are indigenous to Québec.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nBirth of Elijah Harper\n\nCree politician, consultant, policy analyst Elijah Harper was born in Red Sucker Lake, MB. The first Indigenous member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, Harper also served as the minister of Northern Affairs. From 1993 to 1997, he represented the riding of Churchill in the federal Parliament. Harper is best known for the role he played in scuttling the Meech Lake Accord, where he cited the lack of adequate participation and recognition of Indigenous people in that process.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nControversial Visit to Quebec\n\nUntil the 1960s, the monarchy was popular in Quebec because the Crown was viewed as a protector of minority rights. However, during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, attitudes toward the monarchy changed and the Queen was seen as a symbol of British oppression. After addressing the National Assembly in French, the Queen faced crowds of protesters who turned their backs on her and chanted, “Elizabeth, go home.” The police crackdown on these protests became known as “Truncheon Sunday.”\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nOfficial Languages Act (1969)\n\nThe Official Languages Act was given assent, to come into effect on September 7. It declared English and French the official languages of the federal administration. Federal government services — including all services related to federal elections — must now be available in both French and English. (See Official Languages Act, 1969.)\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nSecond Sovereignty Referendum\n\nQuébec held its second sovereignty referendum in 15 years. The \"no\" side won, with a 50.6 per cent majority, in a vote that saw 93.2 per cent of the population participating. In a public speech a shocked Premier Jacques Parizeau blamed the result on money and ethnic voters, and resigned the next day.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nQuebec Liberals Win Election\n\nJean Charest''s Liberal Party won the provincial election and formed the first minority government in Québec in 130 years. The ADQ unseated the Parti Québécois as the official opposition, and for the first time in 30 years the PQ formed neither the government nor the opposition.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nMacLauchlan Becomes Premier\n\nLiberal candidate Wade MacLauchlan was sworn in as the 32nd premier of Prince Edward Island, taking over the province's leadership following the resignation of Robert Ghiz. MacLauchlan, who has held professorships in law and written a biography of PEI premier Alex B. Campbell, was president of the University of Prince Edward Island from 1999 to 2011.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nNDP Wins Majority in Alberta Election\n\nIn a remarkable electoral upset, the Alberta New Democratic Party won a majority government, ousting the long-reigning Progressive Conservative Party. NDP leader Rachel Notley replaced Jim Prentice as premier. The Tories lost support with voters on economic issues in the lead-up to the election and finished in third place on election night. The Wildrose Party became the Official Opposition.\n\nPolitics and Government\n\nDeath of Jacques Parizeau\n\nJacques Parizeau, who nearly led Québec to sovereignty in the 1995 referendum as premier and head of the Parti Québécois, died at age 84 in Montréal. An economist by training, Parizeau was a key figure in the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, helping to establish public institutions such as the Québec Pension Plan and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.\n\nPeople\n\nThibault Sentenced for Fraudulent Expense Claims\n\nFormer lieutenant-governor of Québec Lise Thibault was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to repay $200,000 to the federal government and $100,000 to the Québec government. In 2009, Thibault was charged with claiming hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal expenses during her tenure as lieutenant-governor, and in December 2014, she pleaded guilty to six charges of fraud and breach of trust.\n\nPeople\n\nLiberal Majority Ends Nine-Year Tory Rule\n\nAt the end of an 11-week campaign — one of the longest in Canadian history — voters elected a majority Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, denying Stephen Harper's Conservatives a fourth federal mandate. The 2015 election marked the end of Harper's nine-year term as prime minister, and following the results he resigned as leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nPeople\n\nDuceppe Resigns as Leader of the Bloc Québécois\n\nGilles Duceppe stepped down as leader of the Bloc Québécois in the wake of the October 2015 federal election. Although the Bloc won 10 seats — more than doubling its count from the 2011 election, in which the party was devastated by the NDP's \"orange wave\" in Québec — Duceppe lost in his own riding and the party emerged two seats short of official party status in the House of Commons. This was Duceppe's second resignation from the Bloc's leadership after stepping down in 2011 and returning in 2015.\n\nPeople\n\nJustin Trudeau Sworn In as Prime Minister\n\nJustin Trudeau was sworn in as the 23rd prime minister of Canada at a ceremony in Ottawa, followed by the swearing-in of the country's first gender-balanced Cabinet of 15 men and 15 women. Trudeau's Liberal Party was elected to a majority government in the October 2015 federal election, ending nine years of Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\nProvincial Politics\n\nLiberal Victory in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nLiberal candidate Dwight Ball was elected premier of Newfoundland and Labrador in the province's 20th general provincial election. The Liberals won by a landslide, taking 31 of the province's 40 seats. The Conservatives, who had governed for the preceding 12 years, won seven seats and the NDP took two.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Bill Bennett\n\nFormer British Columbia premier Bill Bennett died in his hometown of Kelowna, BC. He succeeded his father, W.A.C. Bennett, as Social Credit party leader and then premier, an office he held from 1975 to 1986. Known for his strong commitment to public service and his fiscally conservative policies, Bill Bennett has been credited with spearheading development that modernized the province. Some of his notable projects include the Lower Mainland's SkyTrain, the Coquihalla Highway and Expo 86.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Rob Ford\n\nRob Ford, the municipal politician who became an international celebrity during his scandal-plagued term as the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014, died after a battle with cancer. A staunch conservative, Ford campaigned against tax hikes and fought to cut spending at City Hall, famously running for office under the slogan \"stop the gravy train.\"\n\nPeople\n\nNDP Votes to Oust Tom Mulcair as Leader\n\nIn the wake of the NDP's devastating performance in the 2015 federal election, Thomas Mulcair lost the position of party leader when 52 per cent of delegates at the party's convention in Edmonton voted against his leadership. Mulcair decided to remain in his post until a new leader was chosen.\n\nPeople\n\nCanada Supports UN Declaration on Indigenous Rights\n\nIndigenous Affairs minister Carolyn Bennett announced Canada’s full support of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Conservative government under Stephen Harper had endorsed the declaration in 2010, but with qualifications that gave Canada “objector” status at the UN with respect to the document. Bennett's announcement removed this status. The declaration recognizes a wide range of Indigenous rights, from basic human rights to land, language and self-determination rights.\n\nPeople\n\nConservative Party Ends Opposition to Gay Marriage\n\nAt the federal Conservative Party convention in Vancouver, members voted to end the party’s opposition to same-sex marriage by deleting the definition of marriage from its official policy. Many Conservatives spoke out in support of the values of equality and respect embodied in this decision. Same-sex marriage has been legal across Canada since the Civil Marriage Act was passed in 2005.\n\nProvincial Politics\n\nPremier Wynne Issues Residential Schools Apology\n\nIn response to the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne formally apologizes on behalf of the provincial government for the abuses committed against Indigenous peoples in the residential school system, as well as for the oppressive policies and practices supported by past Ontario governments. The province announces a $250-million, three-year investment in several initiatives aimed at reconciliation.\n\nPeople Provincial Politics\n\nDeath of Gilles Lamontagne\n\nFormer Québec City mayor and federal Member of Parliament Gilles Lamontagne died in Montréal at age 97. Lamontagne served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War and survived two years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over the Netherlands. In addition to his tenure as mayor of Québec City from 1965 to 1977, his distinguished political career included positions as defence minister in Pierre Trudeau’s Liberal government and as lieutenant-governor of Québec. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1990.\n\nInternational politics\n\nDonald Trump Wins US Presidential Election\n\nRepublican Party candidate Donald Trump won the United States presidential election, beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in a historic upset. Clinton, vying to be the first woman president, was favoured to win over the controversial billionaire businessman Trump, who divided Republicans throughout his campaign. On election night, as results increasingly pointed to a victory for Trump, Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s website crashed due to an overwhelming surge in traffic. (See also: Citizenship; Immigration; Canada and the United States.)\n\nPeople\n\nKarina Gould Becomes Youngest Female Cabinet Minister\n\nKarina Gould, the member of Parliament for Burlington, Ontario, was named minister of Democratic Institutions in the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and tasked with overseeing the electoral reform file. At age 29, she became the youngest woman ever to serve as a federal Cabinet minister.

In the initial outcome, Premier Christy Clark’s Liberals held onto power with 43 seats, while the NDP won 41 and the Green Party, 3. Later that month, however, Green Party leader Andrew Weaver and NDP leader John Horgan jointly announced that the Greens would support the NDP on any confidence motion. Finally, on 29 June, the Liberals lost a confidence motion put forward by the NDP, and Lieutenant-Governor Judith Guichon asked the NDP to form a government under the leadership of Horgan.\n\nPeople\n\nTrudeau Announces Renaming of Langevin Block\n\nOn National Aboriginal Day 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that, in the spirit of reconciliation, Parliament’s Langevin Block would be renamed Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council. Sir Hector-Louis Langevin (after whom the building was named) played an important role in Confederation but was also one of the original architects of the residential schools system, which was designed to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.\n\nProvincial Politics\n\nBC Liberals Toppled by Vote of Non-Confidence\n\nAfter the 2017 provincial election in British Columbia resulted in a minority government, the NDP put forward a confidence motion that, with the support of the Green Party, overthrew Christy Clark’s Liberals. Lieutenant-Governor Judith Guichon asked the NDP to form a government under the leadership of John Horgan.\n\nProvincial Politics\n\nChristy Clark Retires from Public Life\n\nWeeks after her minority government was toppled by a vote of non-confidence, Christy Clark stepped down as leader of British Columbia’s Liberal Party and as an MLA.

Bennett was given the long-term task of ending the Indian Act and transferring certain government powers back to Indigenous peoples. The recommendation to replace INAC with two departments was originally made in the 1996 report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Allan MacEachern\n\nFormer Liberal Cabinet minister Allan MacEachern, of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, died in Antigonish at age 96. An influential parliamentarian who played a key role in passing health-care and labour legislation that helped shape modern Canadian society, MacEachern is also remembered for his contributions to Atlantic Canada and his devotion to his constituents in Inverness. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2008.\n\nPeople\n\nDeath of Arnold Chan\n\nArnold Chan, Liberal member of Parliament for the Ontario riding of Scarborough-Agincourt, died at age 50 after a battle with cancer. He was remembered by colleagues in Parliament and at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, where he previously served as an aide, as an exemplary politician who deeply valued democracy and civic engagement.

According to Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, the complaint targetted the trade of softwood lumber in an attempt to defend Canada’s forestry jobs.
