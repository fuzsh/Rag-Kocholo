        "text": "Lester B. Pearson (born April 23, 1897, Toronto, Ontario, Canada—died December 27, 1972, Ottawa) was a Canadian politician and diplomat who served as prime minister of Canada (1963–68). He was prominent as a mediator in international disputes, and in 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nPearson served in World War I (1914–18) and lectured in history at the University of Toronto (1924–28), after studying there and at the University of Oxford. He joined the Canadian foreign service in 1928 and became first secretary in the Department of External Affairs. He served on two royal commissions (1931) and as counselor of the Canadian high commissioner’s office in London (1935).\n\nRecalled to Canada in 1941, Pearson then served as ambassador to the United States in 1945–46. He headed the Canadian delegation at the United Nations from 1948 to 1956, and he was president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1952–53. In 1948 he became secretary of state for external affairs in the Liberal government of Louis Saint Laurent, having entered Parliament for Algoma East. He represented Canada at the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, and in 1951 he was chairman of that organization. In 1957 he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to solve the Suez crisis of 1956."
