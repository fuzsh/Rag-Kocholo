        "text": "Philanthropy is the fuel that powers WRI, enabling us to tackle the world’s most pressing environment and development challenges. The impact profiled in this year’s annual report would not be possible without the generous support of WRI’s donors — individuals, foundations, corporations, national governments, and multilateral institutions.\n\nWe are proud to recognize this broad group of supporters who share our commitment to creating a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.\n\nWRI continues to have strong fundraising results — a testament to WRI’s growing reputation as an instrument of change. Highlights from the past year include:\n\nA $100 million commitment from the TED Audacious Project to accelerate land restoration efforts across three landscapes in Africa by investing in locally led restoration projects. The project — Restore Local — is planting an estimated 1.3 billion trees and restoring 2.7 million hectares of land while delivering substantial economic benefits to communities.\n\nGoogle.org’s 2023 Impact Challenge Award, a $5 million grant of which WRI was the first recipient. This supports our Data for Cool Cities Project, which uses sensors, satellite imagery and AI to close data gaps and model changes in the environment. Alongside Google’s efforts, this project will help decision-makers understand where to implement cool surface infrastructure — such as trees and reflective surfaces — to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat.\n\nA $25 million five-year grant from USAID to reduce illegal fishing, logging, deforestation, and wildlife trafficking and harvesting. This grant was received in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Environmental Investigation Agency and others.\n\nSeveral significant grants from foundations, including: $5.5 million in core support from Oak Foundation to strengthen WRI and local partners’ work to create a low- carbon economy in Asia; and a $3.5 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to advance sustainable soy and beef trade.\n\nOur Legacy Society is growing! This past year, 51 donors included WRI in their estate plans, providing WRI with future flexible support.\n\nLast year, more donors than ever provided WRI with flexible funding. This includes the unwavering support of our core donors — the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency — which renewed their multiyear partnerships with WRI. Their collective $15 million of annual institutional funding ensures we are both improving as an organization and that we expand and lift up the broader ecosystem of partners working to advance our shared goals.\n\nIn addition, we recognize our Global Board of Directors, Global Leadership Council, Corporate Consultative Group, Sustainer’s Circle, and many other individuals and family foundations who provide WRI with unrestricted support.\n\nThis critical revenue allows us to explore nascent issues, move quickly to seize emerging opportunities, and leverage additional funding for WRI and our partners. It also allows us to invest in our staff and to strengthen our country programs with the staff, resources and skills they need. We invite philanthropists, foundations, corporations, and other donors to join us in growing this critical support.\n\nThese gifts are but a small sample of WRI’s growing base of dedicated and passionate donors. With your generous and unwavering partnership, we are confident that we can achieve ambitious goals to support sustainability and prosperity for generations to come.\n\nThank you.\n\nSalesforce\n\nSince 2021, Salesforce has provided critical funding to accelerate locally led restoration efforts in India and Brazil through WRI’s Land Accelerator program. In 2023, Brazil’s Accelerator program supported 20 ecopreneurs collectively working to restore 5,700 hectares of degraded land, planting over 2.3 million trees, and benefitting more than 1,800 families. Also in 2023, India’s Accelerator program supported 21 entrepreneurs collectively working towards restoring 6,400 hectares of degraded land, employing approximately 700 employees, and engaging more than 30,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nIn partnership with Salesforce, Brazil’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, and Natura, we expanded our efforts in Brazil in early 2024, hosting a first-of-its-kind restoration event to explore innovative financing solutions, data and monitoring, decision-making, and the enabling conditions needed to unlock finance and collaboration for Brazilian restoration. We welcomed more than 220 attendees from the private sector, government, financial institutions, NGOs and restoration implementors excited about a Brazilian restoration economy. Looking ahead, our shared ambition is to further mobilize political and financial resources, with a goal of catalyzing high-level dialogue and translating commitments into action.\n\nFrom left to right: João Paulo Ferreira, CEO, Natura &Co; Garo Batmanian, Managing Director, Brazilian Forestry Service; Fábio Costa, Country Manager for Brazil, Salesforce.\n\nMajor Donors ($750K)\n\nGovernment and Multilateral Organizations\n\nThe William and Flora Hewlett Foundation\n\nThe William and Flora Hewlett Foundation is dedicated to safeguarding people, communities, and the planet through targeted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pursue clean and efficient energy sources.\n\nFor over 20 years, the Hewlett Foundation has funded WRI’s work that utilizes research, capacity building, and policy development to accelerate climate action in the highest-emitting countries and sectors. Hewlett’s commitment to flexible funding and capacity-strengthening projects has allowed WRI to adapt, innovate, and respond nimbly to emerging and urgent challenges.\n\nWith Hewlett’s support, WRI has worked to advance e-mobility research in India, pilot zero-emission zones across China, enhance bilateral collaboration around climate and energy issues within China and the US, and to support enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to put US climate goals within reach—to name just a few examples. We are honored to work alongside the Hewlett Foundation in our continued effort to tangibly combat climate change.\n\nFoundations\n\nChildren’s Investment Fund Foundation\n\nThe Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) is a major partner in WRI’s efforts to drive climate action and impact in emerging economies, China in particular. CIFF supports WRI to design and implement innovative strategies aimed at accelerating transformation of finance, food systems and key industries, and plays a critical role globally in catalyzing ecosystems and infrastructure for systems change.\n\nBacked by robust data, evidence, technical expertise and strategic engagement, our joint work towards ensuring a sustainable future for future generations demonstrates that ambitious climate action is affordable and politically feasible.\n\nCorporations\n\nCaterpillar Foundation\n\nSince 2021, the Caterpillar Foundation and WRI’s Cities4Forests Initiative have launched five nature-based solutions (NBS) Accelerators to help cities develop a pipeline of investment-ready climate and water resilience projects.\n\nThe Accelerators — currently active in Brazil, India, and the United States — enable a cohort of cities and local project developers to harness the power of nature to mitigate the growing risks of flood, catastrophic wildfire, heat stress and biodiversity loss. WRI experts work with the cohorts to identify the greatest risks and appropriate NBS interventions, support project design through technical assistance and economic modeling, and help developers get their projects pitch-ready for funders and investors.\n\nThe NBS Accelerators have seen great successes thus far: In Brazil, there are two implementation-ready projects under development to mitigate flooding through multi-use parks. In India, an urban rooftop farming project to address urban heat and food insecurity in Mumbai is expanding to 250 schools. Following the success in Mumbai, another Accelerator is underway in Delhi and Bengaluru. In the United States, an investment in an innovative finance model — the Forest Resilience Bond — leveraged $25 million in private capital to protect more than 48,000 acres of forests from catastrophic wildfire.\n\nBuilding on these achievements, the Caterpillar Foundation made a 3-year commitment to help launch a new NBS Accelerator in sub-Saharan Africa. This new stream of work will utilize a combination of NBS and gray infrastructure solutions across 11 cities in seven countries to rapidly scale up climate and water resilience, protecting some of the world’s most climate-vulnerable populations.\n\nIndividuals and Family Foundations\n\n*Denotes Planned Gift\n\n$500,000+\n\n$100,000 - $499,999\n\n$10,000 - $99,999\n\nSustainer’s Circle Members ($1,000 - $9,999)\n\nOther Institutions\n\nGifts in Kind\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\nKelli Joseph\n\nJon Koomey\n\nParamount\n\nRevere Capital\n\nTwo Sigma\n\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\nLegacy Society\n\n(Honors individuals whose legacy plans include WRI through a bequest, life insurance, or retirement plan)\n\n*Denotes Planned Gift realized between 10/1/22 and 1/15/24"
