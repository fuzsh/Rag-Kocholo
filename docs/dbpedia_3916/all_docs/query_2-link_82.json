        "text": "Neethaane En Ponvasantham (English: You Are My Golden Springtime) is a 2012 Indian Tamil romance film co-written and directed by Gautham Menon, featuring Jiiva and Samantha in the lead roles. The film is based on a story written by Reshma Ghatala, who produced the film alongside Elred Kumar, Jayaraman, Venkat Somasundaram and Menon. The film’s score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, while cinematography was handled by M. S. Prabhu and Om Prakash.\n\nNeethaane En Ponvasantham tells the love story of Varun (Jiiva) and Nithya (Samantha) through three stages of their life; their school days, college life and then in their late twenties. The venture was simultaneously shot in Telugu as Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu, which features Naniplaying Jiiva’s role, while the team also briefly filmed an incomplete Hindi version with Aditya Roy Kapoor, with Samantha playing the leading female role in all three versions. The film was released on 14 December 2012, receiving positive to mixed reviews from critics, before enduring an average run at the box office."
