        "text": "So when this happens to be a Gautham Menon movie you can expect a few thing, good songs, clean romance, hear warming moments and stylish lead pair. NEP has all, but is it enough to sustain the interest of the audience? Let us have a look.\n\nVarun (Jiiva) is a student doing his engineering, he meets his high school sweetheart Nithya (Samantha) at a cultural meet, they both fall for each other again and circumstances force them to a break-up again. After building up his career Varun decides to get his lady love back. What happens next forms the rest of the movie.\n\nLets look at the positives first, Jiiva as usual plays his character with a lot of panache, he and Samantha alone carry the whole movie on their shoulders. Jiiva looks smart and fits the bill as Varun Krishnan. Samantha is pretty and bubbly and makes you fall in love with Nithya. The next big positive is Santhanam, he brings the roof down with his one liners and adds energy to this serene romantic film. another big positive is Ilayaraja’s songs.\n\nThe costume and make up artists deserve a special mention because they make the lead pair more good looking and relatable.\n\nThe film begins on a positive note, the very relatable school and college love are a treat to watch, the way samatha proposes to jiiva are very well etched. The places where Jiiva puts his career before Samantha are laudable because a boy hailing from a middle class family will do so. GVM should be appreciated for his realistic first half, dialogs and clean romance.\n\nWhat fails is the last 30 minutes or so from which the film starts lose fizz and becomes silly by the end. the audience started to laugh seeing the climax, the dialogs were so cheesy by the end. When a film starts out with so much promise you expect it to end on a high note but the last 30 minutes drags a well set movie to the floor. The BGM is good at the beginning and becomes a horror show at the end, it is just average to Ilayaraja’s standards.\n\nI will go with 3/5 for a very clean romantic flick which starts good and ends disappointingly.\n\nIf you like my posts please subscribe or follow me on twitter."
