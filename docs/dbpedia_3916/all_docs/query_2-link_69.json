Considering that the album as a whole is far from pure jazz and in a language not understood by the reviewer, I'd call this quite a positive review. Perhaps he didn't mention Satru munbu as it doesn't have any definitive jazz or rock elements. If I remember right, you posted a while back that the reviewer wrote back saying some of the vocals don't add anything to the songs (referring to Saindhu saindhu). That being the case, the way he has phrased it in the actual review is milder. I consider it to be Raja's vettri that a neutral jazz critic finds Kaatrai konjam and saindhu saindhu only \"curiously jazz-like\". New genre indeed!\n\n\"Every tune has vocals, and while several tunes present light and floating orchestration that's curiously jazz-like, these vocals often bring them back to earth.\"\n\nRe: All about Jazz.com reviews NEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM !\n\njaiganesh Wed Oct 23, 2013 3:07 am\n\nAwesome - Fantastic review - and purists watch how this reviewer doesnt find the voice of yuvan odd- years of carnatic listening sometimes makes ppl\n\nprejudiced against certain elements of singing in human voices.\n\nRe: All about Jazz.com reviews NEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM !\n\nbaroque Wed Oct 23, 2013 3:47 am\n\nGood job, irir123.\n\nmmm.... for me to understand his references , I need to listen & learn the styles of Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Oliver Nelson.\n\nyenakku avallam theriyaadhey... any of the above closer to Dexter Gordon or George Brooks, I have listened to couple of their tracks.\n\nRaja's music is like mother's milk rich & complex.\n\nRe: All about Jazz.com reviews NEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM !\n\ncrimson king Wed Oct 23, 2013 4:51 am\n\nThat's a pretty big deal, man, all about jazz is a very well known website.

Looks like in this case, IR also is not offended by these comparisons. If only our directors were more structured/systematic in the screen play , IR can also do more structured work. I remember Rahman mentioned about 27 \"cues\" in slumdog. IR needs directors like that. mysskin is very thrilled about OAK and I am sure his next movie also will be very \"musically\" guided. This could be a new opportunity for IR after NEPV rejuvenating him on the song side.\n\nRe: research - earlier I suggested all of us here in the US contributing a small amount every month to fund some music research in India. Let me know what you think about this.\n\nRe: All about Jazz.com reviews NEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM !\n\nraja4ever Thu Oct 24, 2013 7:40 am\n\nirir123 wrote:\n\nkiru wrote:Congrats irir123, this review says more about your passion and perseverance than about IR's music.\n\nWishing you all the best in your professional career !!\n\n(BTW, it is difficult to do serious jazz or WCM in our movies. that is our social/cultural situation .. so any favorable appreciation from critics speaks volumes about our man )\n\nthanks Kiru - wish I could do more - more than me Mysshkin has done a fantastic job of releasing the soundtrack of \"Onnayum..\"\n\na music student from Illinois who specializes in cello performance - a gifted one at that if one goes by the scholarships she has been awarded - is very keen on doing a project on IR as part of her school's dissertation - she loves IR's works, especially the non-filmy works.\n\nCongratulations irir123 ! your passion towards Raaja's music is something special...

I only suggested because HTNI gets closer to Mahavishnu Orchestra-type music (especially Is It Fixed) and probably more compatible with the requirements of a jazz website. By the way, allaboutjazz has reviewed progressive rock before so they are not necessarily rigid about it. But I don't mean to trouble you, so hats off for your efforts."
