        "text": "Music Director for Neethane En Ponvasantham\n\nThe talk that has been strongly going around during the last few months is that the Oscar-winning composer A.R.Rahman may have opted out of Gautham Menon's tri-lingual Neethane En Ponvasantham due to extremely tight international commitments. We were unable to validate this information through our sources since all the key people associated with this movie have been tight-lipped about this.\n\nOne of the rumours circulating is that Gautham Menon may work with Harris Jayaraj as the film is in the second schedule with only the song picturisations remaining to be done. Gautham Menon's closeness with Harris Jeyaraj during the recent \"Harris on the Edge\" concert tour further strengthens this belief. Rahman could not be reached for comment. Recently, Jiiva maintained that AR Rahman is the music director. But, Gautham Menon claims that he never announced the name of a Music Director as being part of this project. Gautham quoted “I want to keep the music director as a surprise. But, I still want to clarify that there is no truth in AR Rahman ‘opting out’ of my project”. We noticed the contradictory nature of that statement.\n\nThis romantic flick features Jiiva in Tamil, Nani in Telugu and Aditya Roy in Hindi, with Gautham's favourite actress Samantha playing the female lead in all three versions. We believe that the chances of movie hitting the screens for Valentines day is very low given that Gautham will have to do post production and promotions in 3 languages and VTV Hindi is slotted for January release. Realistically, we expect the movie to be released after the exams and most probably after April 2012."
