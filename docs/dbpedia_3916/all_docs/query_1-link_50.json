        "text": "I really really loved Petta. And it has been too long since I said this about a Rajni film. As a lapsed Rajni fan (when you act in one Shankar film too many it happens), it was nice to go right back to the Annamalai, Baasha phase when I was a proper Rajni fanatic. Guess, you have to be that person to truly appreciate Petta. The first half was absolutely rocking and I love how ‘Marana mass’ it was. Not since Dhil, Dhool and Dhilli has a tamil filmmaker made such a sumptuous, masala feast of a film. So kudos to Karthik Subburaj for that. In the theatre where I was watching Petta, we were all infected with Rajni fever and were cheering, screaming ourselves hoarse for every single scene. It was such an amazing cinematic experience and an incredibly special one. Rajni is one actor who has always made me laugh and cry along with his characters and I became completely nuts about Kaali (Petta Velan). Bless you Karthik Subburaj for giving us our Thalaivar back.\n\nIt is so annoying that people go on and on about his style which is dazzling of course, and forget that the man is one of the greatest actors of all time. I don’t think there is an actor who is as sublimely effervescent and effective as he is in any film industry. Examine just about any scene in Petta and you will see what I mean.\n\nThe second half worked very well for me but on a different level. It was great to see Subburaj’s unique little quirks, eccentricities and flair on full display. There is a funeral scene which was insanely good, strangely moving and bad ass as well! Loved every scene with Rajini and the terrific VJS. I thought Nawazuddin did a fantastic job as well and was a really intriguing character. What a treat it is to see Rajni cross swords with behemoths like VJS and Nawazuddin. In retrospect, the editing could have been tighter but with Rajini in such amazing form, who cares? We fans simply cannot get enough of this Rajni! Hope he does more films like this.\n\nI am on such a Petta high and can hardly wait to watch the film again and again. And again.\n\nPS: Did I mention that I really really loved Petta?\n\nPPS: BR! How could you go to a Rajni film and hope to get Subburajfied? Are you kidding me Sir?\n\nBR: This is going to be a long one. But I can’t help myself. Please do reply. I am utterly disappointed that critics have only managed to scratch the surface of the film in their reviews. Not a single mention of the possible symbolisms in the film. To truly appreciate this film, we need to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt. Is it not better to assume that all the elements in the film were purposefully put there rather than dismissing them as half-hearted subplots? Shouldn’t we try to find a unifying thread that the filmmaker may have given us? I did notice such a thread. I would like to know what you think about it.\n\nI feel Petta is a meta film about the state of mainstream Tamil films and filmmakers. It is about how violent mass films have taken over Tamil cinema, dehumanising the audience. And how Rajinikanth returns as the guardian angel of whatever good is left in mainstream cinema.\n\nThis way, the half-hearted subplot about ragging could actually be about the struggle young filmmakers face when coming into the film fraternity. And the half-hearted subplot about the canteen contract could be a metaphor. Where he compares cooking to filmmaking. “Love oda samaikanum!”. And half-hearted subplot about the love triangle is more about two types of filmmakers. Ones who love it and ones who just desire it. Anwar I feel symbolises filmmakers who make films for the love of it. Rajinikanth asks him ” Appo nee love kaagadhaan vandha? Padikka varala?” to which Anwar responds “Aama”. Michael on the other hand is jealous of Anwar’s love for cinema. He is even seen copying in an exam which could be interpreted as stealing scripts. And the half-hearted subplot about sand smuggling could be about power struggle over control of Tamil cinema landscape. It could be that Rajapandi represents filmmakers during director Mahendran’s period who made traditional art films with empathy. And his two sons Devaaram and Singaram represent filmmakers who tried to take over by making mass films with violence. They lack empathy. They only want to conquer. His daughter poongodi on the other hand carries her father’s traits. Rajapandi is okay with their sons taking over the land as long as they do not kill Poongodi (meaning if they let art films survive). They kill Rajapandi, hence ending the art film era. Rajinikanth helps poongodi and Maalik get married. Which could mean Rajinikanth was able to combine traditional cinema and violence successfully in his films. And he conquers the land.\n\nThe massacre at the family function could be interpreted as traditional values being destroyed by violence. Hence wiping Rajinikanth out of the picture (This is probably during the time of Baba).\n\nThe childbirth in the train could be the birth of a new generation of filmmakers. Someone asks Rajini “Paiyan amma maathiriya illa Appa mathiriya?”. This leaves Rajinikanth worried. They decide to raise the child without being told of his past (Without exposure to violent films).\n\nSingaram becoming powerful could be mass films taking over cinema. His two sons representing two types of mass films. Arjith represents social message films and Jithu represents violent gangster films. Which is clearly spelled out when Shanmugam introduces these characters. Singaram wants Anwar killed so as to destroy all hopes of good cinema.\n\nMeanwhile Rajinikanth has spent 20 years away from the mass hero scenes. (Could be since Padayappa 1999). He has been trying to get over his past. He says to Mangalam “Kadandhu poradhudhane vaazhke”. I feel Mangalam (The half-hearted heroine) represents spirituality. Rajinikanth’s new love. She restores his youth and cures his headaches.\n\nIt’s not until Anwar is touched, does Rajinikanth become a mass hero again. He gathers all his students in a hall and says the next two hours they will be locked in this hall and that he is taking control. He is talking to the audience i guess (Theatre? Hall?). This is when Petta (The movie within the movie) begins.\n\nWhen he decides to take revenge (conquer mainstream again), the district collector (Guru Somasundaram) warns him that his oponents have become too big and a defeat could be devastating (This is if the movie Petta fails). It’s pretty clear what they are talking about. Now Rajinikanth takes Anwar along on the ride. It is only fitting that Shanmugam, played by Karthik Subbaraj’s father, provides ammunition for the mission. In a shoot out scene Rajinikanth says to Anwar “Onnum illada kuzhandhe bayappudaadha”. I guess even we would react to violence the way Anwar does, if we weren’t already exposed to such violence in mainstream films.\n\nRajinikanth needs Jithu (Violence in movies) on his side if he is to get back on top. So he does that by Karthik Subbaraj’s oldest trick in the book – Soozhchi (A twist). It felt like KS is letting us know how he has to resort to violence and twists for the movie to compete with other mainstream films. Also we see Singaram becoming increasingly anxious towards the end. This is to show how other mainstream films fear a Rajinikanth film. And how easy it is for Rajinikanth to destroy other mainstream films if he resorts to violence in his films. Rajini even says to Jithu in the end “Nee udhavi panni irukka. Aana neeyum vesham dhaan. Unna vechikalaama? Mudichidalaama?”. Meaning violence has helped Rajinikanth a lot over the years. But does he need it anymore? Is Petta enough? That’s for the audience to decide.\n\nI could go on describing every dialogue that adds to this narrative, but that would be overkill. I’ve just tried to lay down a different interpretation of the film which ties everything together. Having rewatched the film several times, I would say this is not the only other possible thread. It has a religious layer which explores christianity and judaism in the first half, islam in the flash back and hinduism in the final third. My favorite Hindu symbolism was when Rajinikanth and Jithu walk across a Lord Shiva statue with a tamed snake around his neck. I guess you get the idea. There is also an obvious political interpretation of the film. And to make all of this work simultaneously is brilliant. This movie needs multiple watching to understand the depth and subtleties in the performance of the actors. To understand how the director kept spoon feeding hints for you to figure out the twist. The twist is not the reveal but the explanation. People who say they figured out the twist probably missed it.\n\nI had to get this out because I am fed up with people saying stuff like\n\n“I am a Karthik Subbaraj fan. But I am disappointed.”\n\n“It’s more of a Rajini film than a Karthik Subbaraj film”\n\n“Karthik Subbaraj takes a back seat in this film”\n\nI feel this film deserves to be discussed beyond the surface.\n\nHonestly, the people who rave about the Rajnism in this movie honestly don’t get why Rajnism worked not just with fans but with a mainstream audience as well. The style, the dialogues, The comedy, The power all were there but it all complimented a powerful story that evokes a strong emotional response from the audience. Rajnism was never the core of any movie. A strong story with powerful supporting characters and Rajnism really lit up all the portion of the film which otherwise would have been an ordinary film. Take Siva. Even the flopped Pandian, Pannakaran, Dharma durai etc. Rajni movies were always about relationships. Take Annamalai, Muthu etc. The writing takes time to establish the relationship, make the audience connect to the character so when there is a problem to the relation, the audience can connect more. This is always the framework in any successful or memorable Rajni films including Murattu kaalai.\n\nThe irony here is KS is master of emotions. For instance, Mercury’s climax is so emotional and touching. But there is no such emotional connect here. This is such a disappointment. Can anyone name one memorable character in the film? One memorable scene? emotional scene? There was some occasional spark like the scene between Petta and Anwar before killing Singarams brother. You remove the first half and still u won’t miss anything with the story at all which means KS sacrificed an entire first half for the sake of fanboyism. That never happened any Rajni movie ever before.\n\nWhat KS has done is he took just the style, ignored this substance/framework and made a film just for himself and the fans. But he gave the least focus on writing the supporting characters and establishing the relationship connect. Result? For the first time in 22 years, KS has done what even Linga did not do to Rajni..Petta was beaten at the domestic box office by a Non-Kamal film. Rajnikanth is always a king of Box office in all centers not just A center alone. Right now its not obvious but in the coming days it will be very obvious specifically @ b and C centers.\n\nVJS told in an interview that he has blind faith in KS. After this movie, Its better for VJS career if he stopped acting KS films because KS still treats VJS like a short film actor who can act than a star who can perform. If he continues to act in KS movies, then he will become a short film actor again and others will start treating him the same.\n\nThere two kinds of great actors – the Rajini type and the Vijay Sethupathi/nawasuddin siddique type…ones larger than life magnetic presence where HE is the character he is playing… and the other is able to so well flesh out the screen persona that he becomes the character…Its been awhile a director got it right – to cull out the Rajininess and exaggerate it by juxtaposing against the character which portrays a kind of everydayness (in persona not typology) with so much conviction (of Vijay Sethupathi)…. what you get on screen Is Rajini (of the masses) vs Jithu…\n\nThere were many meta moments in the movie I really enjoyed – the tragic comedy-esque fate of the characters alluded to by the mickey mouse sketches… and the arch-villain looking on is Pette (punning on Pete the nemesis of Mickey Mouse?); Ofcourse the allusion to Ramayanam as pointed out; references to vaanara kootam and Singaram (siddique) seated like a monkey when Kaali enters his room;.juxtaposing Kaali and Singaram, perhaps an allusion to Kaali from Mullum Malarum who dotes on his sister (in Petta a sister-like poongodi); hates kumaran(singaram/Kumaran-both synonyms of murgan) also shot in the hills of Ooty?! …\n\nthe other interesting references are thalapathi like train scene where a child is born…where there is a frame of rajinikanth looking pensive (almost like he is looking back as kaali at surya)…many ‘self-referential’ moments in the details for a Rajini fan. These details themselves becomes a tribute to him.\n\nOfcourse there are many ifs and buts in the movie…we could stop reducing our female roles to parochial moments of a sisterly/motherly/wifey character in need of ‘protection’ and abandoning them without any closure… reduce excessive stunts. also I wish Rajini movie were less crowded… in terms of characters there is very little space – physical or otherwise, to flesh them all out with justice…\n\nBut the movie is mass and how! One of the last scenes actually captures the spirit of the movie – wherein a character remarks what a great actor he is after Kaali reveals to Jithu that he has been duped into killing his father (stage within a stage moment)… this was as much subburaj the director aswell as subburaj the fan boy’s tribute to his star (the opening titles proclaims the same)…a delightful comeback for Rajini.\n\nR.Ramalakshmi ( 2 part Rajini and 1part Karthick Subburaj fan!)\n\n@Selva Ganapathy V\n\nThat was one big overanalysis. Kudos for the thinking. Feels straight outta of jigarthanda kind of meta narrative. However, ur points make more sense as concepts rather than masterstrokes, IMO. I remember this time when I interpreted Kaatru Veliyidai as a feminist film – Those Bharathiyar references, her dilemma, the details etc- and this seems similar. No offence to ur thinking. But ur point about this being one hell of a artistic expression seems like an exaggeration. There are ways to interpret the bad writing/acting of those small villains could be interpreted as the bad writing found in tamil cinema villains but then someone once said ” A good thing poorly expressed is a lie”. I thought that the excess masculinity in this film could be a commentary. I was unable to tolerate Petta/Kaali as he was continuously bossing around and stuff. I badly wanted to make something out of it. I came across this interview of KS in cinema express where he said “I enjoyed the emotional aspects of Kaala and Kabali but I really missed the Thalaivar bits in them”. He added “I was really disappointed after watching an old Rajini movie. My uncle asked me why. I told him that my idea of Rajini was hurt by making him vulnerable. By making him not save a child and another character. If he can’t save them, how can it be a movie for Thalaivar ?” And there went my theory. This is just a bad movie made by a good filmmaker. Say, like a CCV. To conclude, this was a film written for Rajni, by a Rajni fan for Rajni fans. But I highly doubt that this movie would even work for his fans. I really liked certain bits of his childishness(Not a fan. a 2k kid) but I would say e221 is right in this aspect. One can’t make a film purely out of admiration without a proper story. A lot of talent has been wasted here and it makes me sad. Even the screenplay was lazy. The flashback could’ve been made interesting by not giving away that Poongodi is alive. Many mistakes made out of excitement and enthusiasm. I really hope KS makes a film like Iraivi or Jigarthanda after two boring and mediocre outings like Mercury and Petta. But, I can say this: Ur oveanalysis is actually really interesting. U have a keen eye and a strong mind for films. And.. was I the only one pissed off by those unwanted political jokes(?) ? What is this new trend with everyone trolling someone being trolled just for the sake of it ?\n\nI wonder if this hasn’t been brought up already only because Tamil mass films are already politically loaded to begin with. But this read like Rajni’s 2019 election manifesto to me. Briefa sollanumna, Rajni BaJaPa odda seramaatar, thalaivara nambunga. The secularism, reclaiming inter religious marriage from the love jihad taint, the all out attack on cow belt militancy with ample emphasis on vadagu india. Yes, Rajni is not Ramar but rather the Anjaneyar who will save Tamil Nadu from the North Indian invaders again. Sorry if this was cynicism overload. To be frank, in the current climate, I didn’t wholly mind the message and also appreciated showing eunuchs in a positive light. But all social tokenism aside, I had one serious problem with the climax. SPOILER ALERT\n\nFor the whole Rajathanthiram conceit to work, Nawazuddin has to protest again to Vijay that Rajni is lying and not to believe him. His silent resignation to his fate jars when the big reveal comes later. I have not watched KS’ other films but do know he is an acclaimed director, so I frankly could not understand such a big miss from him. I know it is a mass film and all but don’t tell me even this level of plausible denial wasn’t built into earlier Rajni films. It has nothing to do with logic anyway, because it is already illogical that Rajni should so easily convince Vijay that he is not Nawaz’s child. It is about supporting the narrative with the right reactions from the characters and that was missing in the climax.\n\nI also felt KS was not sure whether he had put enough mass in the film and therefore let the climax drag on and on with additional insurance mass dialogues. I kept thinking surely if it’s dragging on then Nawaz must have one last trick up his sleeve but there was nothing and Vijay’s surrender subsequently was also tame. To compare with the film that virtually created the template for Rajni’s 90s mass hysteria films, Badshah had all the mass but was also taut and never let up in intensity (like the metal show I attended yesterday :D). This one kinda lost the momentum towards the end. I think this problem first started with Padayappa where the climax was again bloated to give ample space for Rajni mass dialogue + stunts. A good political lesson from this for Rajni could be: don’t just think about the core base, try to convert the swing vote also.\n\nI now believe no one can handle Rajini better than Karthik Subbaraj, at this point. It’s not about the dozens of easter eggs, homages, references to past Rajni movies and drowning the audience in the sea of nostalgia. I think he has cracked how to sell the superstar Rajini, at a time where he’s not just become bigger than any villain, but also any story. The audience are neither going to buy a vulnerable Rajini (ex. Kabali, Kaala) , nor is there any villain menacing enough to convince us about inflicting serious damage to the superstar. Endhiran is not a good example of Rajini being a good antagonist because we had to endure an absolutely life-less, colorless, boring Vaseegaran and an expression-less Chitti as protagonists, to finally enjoy Rajini cutting loose as 2.0.\n\nStories from his biggest hits in the 80s and 90s (even Basha) have either not really aged well or have been done to death. In today’s times, a strong story would consist of solid supporting characters and their arcs, which means having a considerable amount of scenes where Rajini isn’t present. But the most common criticism of Petta has been that the second half (where other characters did have screen time) is not as mass as the first half, or also referred as lag . We as audience are unwilling to let Rajini not be part of even a few scenes.\n\nKS knows this and what does he do? He presents the superstar in a best-hits-mashup and also in a never-seen-before way, both at once. An age old plot of revenge, the familiar mannerisms, mumbled dialogue delivery and the cocky attitude to whip up nostalgia. A manipulative & murderous Rajini, with hitman-like qualities to satisfy the gangster-buff in KS, which is the part that worked incredibly well for me. Never have I seen such a cold , blood-baying Rajini on screen post his 90s superstardom. The phrase ‘Kola gaandu’ acquires a totally different meaning, even if not all that different from the individual words in it. KS hands over sub-machine guns, rifles and everything else that could fire, to Rajini and makes him go berserk, staging Anurag-Eastwood type shootouts. The VJS twist at the end is actually quite dark considering how holy blood-relationships are meant to be treated in the Rajiniverse. No one is going to take Nawaz seriously as a villain if he’s going to take on Rajini face-to-face. So he’s made a cowardly saddist, who avoids direct confrontations at all costs, which Nawaz can now play in his sleep. They should have cared a bit more on the lip sync though. I also loved how dance , an act Rajini is not particularly the best at, becomes a recurring motif right from the dance at hostel to the one in climax, providing for some exhilarating adrenaline rushes in certain scenes. All in all, at a time when I was at crossroads about what to expect from Rajini’s next, considering Kabali and Kaala (films I really liked) didn’t do that well, Petta rekindled all those inexplicable emotions I experienced as a kid watching this man light up the screen on fire every single time a movie of his played. Yes, I did indeed get #Rajinified.\n\nPetta = The “Padayappa” of 2019 i.e a precision-engineered effort to trigger multiple nerdgasms from die-hard Thalaivar fans who’ve been champing at the bit and gnashing their teeth in frustration as film after film from The Style King post -Shivaji (the last “massy” effort from The Man) has been all foreplay, but little follow through in terms of delivering what they want. It can’t have been easy, sitting through one thoroughly botched effort (Kochadaiyaan), one coma-inducing misfire (Lingaa) and seeing the Rajini Icon either appropriated for one director’s political agenda(Kabali, Kaala) or another’s whiz-bang Special Effects Extravaganza (Endhiran, 2.0). I’d say the Robot movies were equally “massy” but I’d be in a select minority.\n\nOn that front, Petta is Rajini at his cock-walking, scenery chewing and punch dialogue spouting best.\n\nFor die hard Rajini Fans, it’s the Second Coming.\n\nFor the not so die hard…..\n\n[SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS]\n\nWell, we’d say, we found it entertaining overall but at the same time, we’d wonder why Petta suffers from the same problem as “Vishwaroopam 2”. where pre-and post interval sections seem to belong to different movies that were stitched together.\n\nWe’d ponder at a movie with an almost 3 hour run time which still can’t find the time for properly setting up conflicts (2 lines about the Terror Boys and 1 scene of ragging and they’re the Big Bad of the 1st half, ready to be taught a lesson by the Bad Ass Hostel Warden).\n\nWe’d marvel at one of the best supporting cast ever to be assembled for a Rajini film and then cringe in dismay as one by one, they’re tethered, led to and finally sacrificed at the Alter of Brand Rajini.\n\nWe’d be baffled at the need to parade Simran and Trisha before us for a few minutes before being unceremoniously shunted off screen by of all people, the man who gave us “Iraivi”\n\nWe’d hope the experience of working with Rajini more than compensated for how the film made use of Sasikumar (the Terminator of Asuravadham, being Rajini’s Silent Enforcer:we’d fantasize about THAT movie)\n\nAnd lastly. we’d have such an outpouring of sympathy for Bobby Simha and Vijay Sethupathi, that we might actually hold a wake, grieving over how they start off as Galloping Knights but finish as Simpering Pawns, the former reduced to grateful servitude after a knife slash and the latter sitting downcast after having been used and conned in a needless last minute twist reveal. We hope there were enough zeroes at the end of your cheques, boys.\n\nAnd then….we’d just rewatch Baasha.\n\nV: You are pretty much on the money regarding Bachchan in Khakee vs him in Buddha. The thing is that Bachchan is a very different star than Rajini..you can’t reduce him simply to a set of gestures. With Rajini you can still get away by doing that (because in terms of pure gesturality Rajini is quite unique)..if Bachchan was to attempt some of the more over-the-top roles of Rajini (not talking about all but the ones which depend purely on his gesturality), it wouldn’t work because the audience always expects something more from him (the viewer demands the “actor” from him even when he is playing a “star”..and it becomes it even more tricky because he has hardly ever played a star in the last two decades so the contemporary isn’t as keyed into his masala screen-persona as it is with Rajini’s). This is why his performance in Buddha doesn’t work..Rajini would have knocked that one out of the park (even considering alll the others problems with the film).\n\nOn Petta, I really really enjoyed it (much more than Kaala and 2.0 though the latter’s strengths in terms of sfx & 3D can’t be denied..) and Rajini is in such top form here that his performance really papers over a lot of the film’s issues. I was initially sceptical as to how Rajini would fit into Subbaraj’s world. Subbaraj’s films are situated in the post-Rajini universe which is to say that say in something like Jigarthanda, Rajini is the presiding diety of that film’s world (the film’s homages are testament to that), his spirit hovers over it, he is worshipped in that world, but he can’t himself enter into that world because he would be so huge a persona that he would completely destabilise it (I mean imagine him in Bobby Simha’s part in Jigarthanda, the film would just not work especially in the 2nd half). But what Subbaraj has done is that he has moved into Rajini’s universe. This isn’t even close to being a truly important contemoporary Masala film let alone among the all time great ones of the genre (from the more recent Rajini films, I will take Endhiran easily over it) but I found it compulsively entertaining and is certainly better than two Ranjith films (Kaala had its moments and I was involved throughout its running time but I also thought Rajini wasn’t the right kind of star for a film like that).\n\nI will also say this..for a star to depend so much on gesturality as Rajini does, it is very difficult to retain the kind of heft and aura he has managed to in his screen persona (even in his twilight years as a star)..most stars like this (Vijay etc) don’t last this long. And it is even more heartening that contemporary Tamil filmmakers want to explore his persona in serious (by serious i mean that they want to truly engage with his persona) ways (irrespective of what the final results of the films are).\n\n@Selva Ganapathy V\n\nYour interpretation is really good and no one is asking people to change their views. Just that the fact that KS hasn’t grown to a level where he can make a Utthama Villain kinda of meta narrative. Even Jigathanda had those annoying tonal inconsistencies. Take birdman or Barton fink(Not so meta as much as mindfuck and clever). For a meta narrative to work, there must be a cue to trigger that response. And for a meta narrative to be plausible it must work alongside a movie and not merely be the main movie. Your interpretations are really good and it is really valuable when someone figures out something for themselves. I even established that we were on the same page by saying that I badly wanted to find out if the excess masculinity meant something. But at the end this is just an excuse to show more vintage thalaivar. Lets say if KS really intended to make the film you interpreted. The ragging point makes no sense unless first year of college is atleast an metaphor for some art form(Education is not a even a minor character motivation here and the ragging was a hindrance to those students not anwar’s love. Not at that point). And with respect to Jigathanda, the concept of young filmmakers struggling was something which happened to the MAIN character, fuels his motivation, allows KS to explore many shades in Karthik’s character. And the point about Micheal being jealous and copying scripts ? There are better ways to weave ideas like that into the script especially when someone like KS is incharge of writing. His films are more about the things surrounding an event rather than the event itself. Seen from that angle, this would end up as a bad try at effective detailing and would else become a chance for Thalaivar to get caught in the hands of the main villain accidentally while dealing with small time rowdies. Still, there is a hundred percent chance that this could be something KS meant. But at the cost of a good story ? If so, then he might’ve made some impressive piece of art which only he can understand. And the point of art is to EXPRESS and act as a stimuli for emotions and worldview. I used to like KS(the writer – director) before mercury and I went into Kola-Gaandu mode after this movie. Really hope he make something worthwhile. After all, there are a few interesting filmmakers around.\n\nWatched both Petta and Viswasam. e221 has superbly articulated my thoughts on Petta.\n\nThere are too many things wrong in Petta, right from the first scenes to the very last.\n\nBefore the Maranam Mass song, Bobby Simha rags the juniors to sing a song praising the seniors. But, the lyrics of the song ‘Getha Nadandhu Varan…’ all keep referencing Rajini. This is what happens when you get the ‘introduction song’ composed first and then are unable to think of a suitable lead-in for the song. In the middle of the song, when Rajini starts dancing, the students cheer him and start background dancing to him even though they have never met him before. How is this logical? That is why Ullala song works much better in the movie even when Maranam mass song was more popular pre-release.\n\nLet’s look at the final twist. (Considering the length of the movie, 15% of the audience had begun to walk out after the main villain’s death. This is where test screening would have helped.) VJS should be atleast 6-7 years old during the time period of the bomb blast. How would he have forgotten his parents? It is like VJS didn’t even ask a single question to Rajini about the blast. And how did Rajini know that VJS doesn’t remember his mother. He decides not to shoot him after seeing some burn marks in his body. At that time, he wouldn’t know when exactly had VJS’ mother died. Not to mention Nawazuddin Siddique playing along with Rajini’s tale when VJS comes to question him. Wouldn’t he be worried that VJS may attack/kill him if he believed in Rajini’s tale. Instead, he consoles VJS like how one would console a tantrum throwing child who has just lost a sports match. Everyone seems to play along like ‘Boss, neenga sonna seri’.\n\nWhat surprised me is that now I think Kaala is better than Petta in terms of what the director has accomplished or even as a piece of cinema. At least Ranjith was successful in portraying the plight of Tamils in Dharavi and gave some memorable characters (Eswari, Lenin etc.) and scenes even though he let his message/political agenda get in the way of good storytelling. In this movie, KS accomplishes nothing much except running a ‘Spot the Rajini reference’ contest for the fans. A music video collage of Rajini mass scenes would have done this better.\n\nKaala and Jurassic World had released on the same day. After 4 weeks, Jurassic World, an IMDB 6.2 rated movie collected more than Kaala in the Chennai Box office. After seeing both Viswasam and Petta, I bet that after 2-3 weeks, Viswasam will do much better than Petta in Chennai & other A centres too (It is leading in B, C centres from day 1). At least Ajith’s ‘Viswasam’ seems to have paid off.\n\nA lovingly constructed tribute to a beloved movie idol gone horribly wrong or a mischievous prank played at the Rajini obsessed or Rajinism obsessed audience or a mixture of both. These are the ways one could describe Karthik Subbaraj’s Petta. If this was designed as a straightforward Rajini film then,this is Neither a good Rajni film, nor a good Karthik film, not even a cohesive film, period. Just a random postmodern Rajini show. A truckload of referential subtext with absolutely no context. Karthik’s attempts at resurrecting the (almost fallen) idol is such an exercise in futility that one is forced to question whether he even understands what makes a Rajini film a Rajini film. Rajnisims cannot exist in isolation. It needs thematic framework. it needs the buildup from a well developed screenplay. Rajnisims alone does not a Rajini film make\n\nHaving Rajini strut his stuff in a totally pointless movie is as painful as watching Rajini being subjugated in Ranjith’s films or being used merely as a bankable commodity to fund Shankar’s extravaganzas. KS’s worst tendencies are in full display here. Fractured narrative, scattershot postmodernism, fourth wall breaking winking at the audience, characters lacking consistency , cold craftsmanship and the worst of all, the obsession with plot twists. Of all things, he reduced Rajini to a hostel warden solving canteen corruption.Pretty much explains the scope of the film. I just kept on wondering ,where are the epic settings,the scale, the scope, the epic set pieces,the man to god transformations, the masala scenes . It never hits a consistent tone,one moment a straight masala film and the next a send up off one\n\nNow if its more of an elaborate joke made at the expense of Rajinitards, then it works much better, atleast conceptually. Thats a Jigarthanda like film with Rajini himself starring.The first dialogue gives an inkling of it. Its like KS saying through Rajini: you suckers have ben crying hoarse about not getting enough Rajinisms in his last few films. Guess what ,i am going to devote the entire first half of the film to only Rajinisms, no character, plot, supporting actors or my auteurial instincts are going to interfere in this. just soak in it and go crazy in the theaters. And the Rajinisms are in full flow here. the walk, the talk , spitting out words like bullets, the stylish gestures, the dance steps, The rapid change of expressions and body language its the Rajini that we havent seen for more than a decade. at the interval point he seems to be saying , look however much you and me like these Rajinisms , this is still a feature film and we need some semblance of story and character to go along with it. But dont worry. the story and character will be just a mishmash of past Rajini movies .Now we have a super double bill,. with both Rajinisms and Rajni filmisims running in parallel.\n\nSo he base the film majorly on 3 milestone films of Rajni. First is Mullum malarum, most probably Rajini’s greatest turn as actor. A film directed by Mahendran, who makes an appearance here .Second is Thalapathi, which marked the union of Rajini with Karthik’s favorite director Mani Rathnam. The third is Baasha , the greatest Rajni film ever made . But it is not much fun, i am afraid, worse in an act of subversion (intended or not) or modernizing , he reverses everything that was good about these films\n\nFinally at the end of the film , he asks : isnt it enough for you guys, A load of Rajinisms to last a life time , dont complain about this anymore. Basically what KS has done here is what he and only perhaps he experienced while watching Lingaa. Create a running conversation between the idol and the worshipers.\n\nKarthik’s best appears in just one scene , the funeral scene that appears post interval which is a brilliantly crafted and shot sequence that one wonders what the hell happened to him for the rest of the film. It mixes his love for Rajini as well as the love for westerns. We already heard the dollars film theme played before a couple of times in the film, here he gives the payoff. it brims with Tarantinosque dark humor mixed with his usual hit tip to Sergio Leone, as Rajni quotes the iconic – if you want to shoot shoot dont talk- line from Good bad and ugly as he dispatches Devaram. he shoots the rifle single handed like a cowboy would shoot a pistol. the camera moves are extraordinary, where it tracks, zooms and whip pans in the space of a single shot.But this scene just come out of nowhere and goes out to nowhere. Rest of the time he is doing flaccid replicas of scenes , like from thalapathi where Jaishanker asks Rajni to leave Mammooty telling him he is his wife’s son. here its Rajni in Jaishanker place and VJS in Rajni’s place. we soon learn that the scene itself is a hoax and whatever Rajni was saying was all lies. Very similar to what the film is doing to the audience\n\nWell for me , another whiz kid bites the dust trying to make a new gen Rajini film and the grand wait of the next great Rajini film continues.\n\nSuccess of a movie is like success of a political party in an election. Most times, they are multifaceted and target simultaneously different groups. The more groups they can connect to, the more chances for them to succeed.\n\nTwo people voting for the same party do not vote for the same reason. Similarly two people who likes a movie do not enjoy it for the same reason. A movie, even if you are watching in a theatre among hundreds of people, still manages to have a private conversation with you. Some of them succeed by touching on your most personal moments. Some of them succeed by making you forget those moments. If someone enjoys a high emotional drama that others can’t stand it’s because of this. If someone raves about a mindless, emotional movie its because that movie made him forget the necessities of life.\n\nThe kind of conversation a movie has with a viewer also depends upon the viewers’s taste. Taste stems from one’s personal experiences and exposure. Taste is a very sensitive topic. As Chetan Bhagat puts it: (via a old post from Jai Arjun Singh)\n\n“A lot of people don’t realise that taste can be used to run other people down. But all of our tastes are a product of our environment, the families we were born into, our upbringing. If I’m from a sophisticated background I might have exposure to the finer points of Japanese cuisine. But a traditional Jain family won’t know anything about it – does that mean these people are dumb?”\n\nIt’s easier to forget this sensitivity when we talks about movies. Even people who are generally sensitive about other things don’t think twice when they diss a movie especially around the viewership. It is one thing to say “I do not like this food” and another thing to say “who will eat this food”. The latter is being insensitive to the person who is enjoying it. We don’t do this at the table while eating, but we don’t think it’s not okay to do it when we discuss about movies. To wonder how movies like Petta or Viswasam can be enjoyed is questioning the tastes of the people who are savouring it. Since taste is a personal thing, discussing about movies can become personal very quickly. Once it becomes personal the discussion becomes pointless as it revolves around trying to prove whose sensibilities are superior forgetting that for each his own is better.\n\nIntrigued by the review, comments & post-review pieces here, I watched the film today. Felt like a pure vegetarian at a Muniyandi Vilas Military Hotel! As someone who was never swayed by the “style” factor of Rajnikanth, but still could enjoy his largely entertaining capers like Manithan, Annamalai & Baasha – this one was underwhelming.\n\nI watched it with about 15 others in the theater with absolutely no hungama. So the evocative dialogues and whistle-baits did not receive any response from the crowd. In a way, this ensured that it was the film that was the focal point and not infectious fandom\n\nThe initial portions were superb. It was great to see the star in super form, but I think it got repetitive after a point. Ive known for 30+ years that this star can set the screen on fire – someone who hasnt deviated much from his template, even in Kaala Kabali type of movies. So why have meaningless characters just to prop up the already gigantic Rajni? Karthik Subburaj from what I have seen, doesnt get verbose to explain the twists in his films (eg Pizza) – but here I guess he had to keep dialogues to explain obvious things. For eg: The Vaali Rama story in the end – Rajni had beautifully changed his facial expression from that of a concerned dad, to a triumphant badass boss once his job was done. The dialogues just created flab. Similarly the political intonations & commentary on food, urimai, mannu, right-wing etc were just so out-of-place. I get that it is impossible to show Rajni in a negative light – but why this positive glow? The personal enmity itself could have served the purpose quite well, but no – podhu nalam has to be somewhere there, even in a Karthik Subburaj film, known otherwise for his unapologetic characters (eg. Sidharth in Jigarthanda!).\n\nI could suspend my belief for some of the gaping holes in the plot, but certainly not for the one where Rajni makes a fake claim, a claim so crucial to the story which however pivots on something improbable like Nawaz’ lack of any reaction to it! I mean, atleast show him get a severe asthmatic attack that muffles his voice. This one is more amusing than Manorama believing that Rajni – Prabhu are CBI officers in Guru Sishyan 🙂\n\nVjs: while many found his performance problematic, I thought he was being true to his character – that of Singaram’s son – i.e not a bright bulb. Would have loved to see him as the main antagonist, not a pawn in the game.\n\nJust wondering if this film would have got this sort of a reception had it not been marketed strategically by Sun pictures (gradually creeping into our minds through audio launch, Karthik Subburaj’s image of a Superstar veriyan & this film being a tribute being cultivated through Twitter, Suryan FM plug-ins, Sun TV spots etc) or had it released like 2.0, during a non-festival weekend or if it did not carry KS’ name (i.e idhey padam, but say, the Director’s name was, maybe, Soundarya Rajnikanth!). Ofcourse Rajni fans would have made it a hit even then, but this outpouring of acclaim may not have happened.\n\nBR’s review is spot-on.\n\nYour example would work with a Westerner finding Indian music weird or vice versa. Both sides lack each other’s cultural reference to make sense of the music.\n\nEven within the Tamil culture, there are so many layers. Not every Tamil can pick another sub culture within the Tamil speaking society easily. The Beef eating protagonist in Attakathi is a reference to a certain sub-culture. Sivaji as Periya Thevar is not just about the character for everyone. For some Mukkulathor, Sivaji of the Thevar caste playing himself would have be more prominent than Sivaji the actor. It may be a coincidence but Sivaji played a Thevar again in Pasumpon. Danush’s dialogue “Konnaa Paavam, Thinnaa Pochu” in the village scene in Power Pandi, touches upon the culture of animal sacrifices in parts of Tamil Nadu. While this dialogue would mean nothing to people not exposed to these traditions, it would strike a chord with groups practising these rituals. Especially at a time when these rituals can be seen barbaric. A mainstream hero uttering such a dialogue would be viewed as an affirmation to their practice.\n\nTo identity with even the non-cultural themes one has to have gained certain exposure. Capitalism vs Communism theme played out in Anbe Sivam is one example. In the same movie Aravindhan Neelakantan sees another layer — portrayal of a corrupt Siva Bhakthar and an all loving Christian nun. Criticising Hindu theism and sympathising with other religions is a very Periyariyan theme.\n\nAmbedkarian references in Pa.Ranjit movies like Rajini’s suit in Kabali, Karthi’s book in Madras can be identified only if one has been exposed to these ideas. A friend grown up listening to the impact of Dravidian politics on Brahmins could only see Iruvar as glorifying Dravidian leaders. A non-Brahmin won’t feel the same way. Brahmin dialect speaking corrupt/manipulative Secretary and the poster of Qutubuddin Ansari, the face of Gujarat riots, in Raju Murugan’s Joker is a way of layering a specific political ideology within a generic ‘against the system’ movie. There are so many references in movies, subtle and explicit, that people with certain experience and background can pick immediately which in turn influences their likes and dislikes.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is the references, both cultural and non-cultural, are not always readily identifiable. The background of the hero, the dialogues they speak all resonate with some group. Make others cringe. And both have their own reasons.\n\nMovie watching is not an academic exercise for everyone. Not everyone has the time and energy to care about which universe the hero belongs or if the movie is meta. When someone measures and dismisses their favourite movie with the terms that they don’t care, with the terms that they are not exposed to, then they are likely to feel these criticism as alien to them. This highlights the gap in exposure, taste and appreciation.\n\nWhat is seen cannot be unseen. Once someone is attuned to appreciating the finer aspects of cinema, even if it is perceived, it becomes difficult to see it any other way. To this group appreciation of movies like Vedhalam, Viswasam is a puzzle. On the other side are the people who are not exposed to these aspects. Not exposed because they don’t have an opportunity or because they don’t care about these aspects. To them the likes of Viswasam is as good as any movie that the former group would acknowledge as a Masterpiece. Their taste may be perceived as less finer, but they are probably as satisfied with these movies as the other side’s experience of a Masterpiece.\n\n—\n\nThanks Siva. I have also done that. Ridiculing Vijay fans. Yes, I agree it’s difficult to change an ingrained mindset. But I think there is hope if we can acknowledge it. I believe that movie appreciations are a matter of taste. Tastes, to me, are more about the environment of the individual. Following BR and the conversation I am having here, has a lot to do with my environment. In a different environment may be I wouldn’t have had the luxury to discuss about movies or I would have been going frenzy over a Vijay or Ajit film, and abusing BR and his followers. I am hoping that being aware of this would help me to be less snobbish towards these fans.\n\n“Even within the Tamil culture, there are so many layers. Not every Tamil can pick another sub culture within the Tamil speaking society easily” – True. However, to me, how much a film (or any work of art per se) expects the viewer to know this sub culture in order for it to work also says something about the film’s scope. I don’t mean this qualitatively but rather in terms of broad v/s narrow. I have never gone by maatuvandi but I love Raja’s maatuvandi songs. What I am saying is the more ambitious of art creations find a more intrinsic quality of the human condition that the audience can relate to while the more specific discuss, well, specific aspects of a sub culture. One needs both kind of art, obviously. My point though is even the need for a viewer/listener to understand culture is not uniform across different works, different artists. Unlike BB King, I was not born on a plantation in the South and have not walked in his shoes but I can relate to his art. Which brings me to:\n\n“Once someone is attuned to appreciating the finer aspects of cinema, even if it is perceived, it becomes difficult to see it any other way. To this group appreciation of movies like Vedhalam, Viswasam is a puzzle. On the other side are the people who are not exposed to these aspects. Not exposed because they don’t have an opportunity or because they don’t care about these aspects. To them the likes of Viswasam is as good as any movie that the former group would acknowledge as a Masterpiece. ” – Yes. That is exceedingly well summed up and to my mind, this aspect dictates more what a viewer gets out of a movie. What at all one cares about or looks for in a film ends up dictating what films one tends to like and these films in turn may fall into particular slots as well (artsy v/s commercial). Though…I don’t begrudge anyone their fondness for a Vedhalam. It’s fine and as I covered above, I kind of understand what they get out of it. It’s just not the same thing as what I want to get out of a movie and that’s also fine because it would be boring if all films had, you know, slow scenes and soft, unobtrusive BGMs and all the other hallmarks of refinement. I am reminded of the climax of Mr Bean’s Holiday where a typical, hilarious Bean accident rescues the audience out of stupor and the director out of certain rejection."
