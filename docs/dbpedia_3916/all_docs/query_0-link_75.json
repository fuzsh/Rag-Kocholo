        "text": "The year-end report card of the Kollywood film industry reads as under. 2012 witnessed the release of close to 150 films which is roughly...\n\nThe year-end report card of the Kollywood film industry reads as under. 2012 witnessed the release of close to 150 films which is roughly 3 films per week. However, the number of films which managed to emerge profitable is less than 15, which is a mere 10% of the total number of films which were have crossed the break even.\n\nThis report we have managed to glean it from various sources, to the best of our knowledge. Please note there is no official records , whatever you see come across the internet are non-validated data,but that’s how the industry operates.\n\nThe categorization is based on Return on Investment (ROI) factor. A film may have collected Rs. 60 crores but it cannot be classified as super hit, if the expenses were around Rs. 55 crores. A movie made in Rs. 3 core will come under super hit category if it had collected Rs. 15 crores.\n\nThe dynamics of business is so complex that we cannot give specific figures as we get conflicting claims from various quarters viz producers, distributors, and theaters. But there is little debate in the overall list of hits and misses, as everyone could figure out them by just looking in the list of ‘Now showing’.\n\nWe can safely say that the overall trend in 2012 is in favor of directors and not actors / stars. Films received well by the critics and audiences are appreciated for their themes and script rather than for the magic of the stars. Surya, for example, did a good job in Maatraan but the film was not received well because of sloppy screenplay. So is the case with Thandavam starring Vikram. Movies like Vazhakku En, Pizza, NKPK, Sundarapandiyan, Kumki, Kaathalil Sothappuvathu Eppadi, Attakathi, and Naan were praised primarily for their directorial excellence.\n\nGoing by the box office success one can easily say that Thuppakki tops the list by collecting more than 100 crores. While no other movie comes near to this in terms of collections, many films can be termed as super hits based on the investment: collection ratio. NKPK and PIZZA have collected just above Rs. 7 crores each but they can be termed as super hits as their respective budget does not cross Rs. 1.5 crores.\n\nOn the same criteria Mugamoodi and Poda Podi can be termed as flops though they have collected more the low budgeted movies. Theatre circles say that Mugamoodi is the biggest flop among the movies that have star status. Poda Podi just follows.\n\nSaguni’s loss is almost negligible just because its expenses were not that high.\n\nThe list given below must be seen in this perspective. Here we go:\n\nSuper-Hits\n\nThuppakki – Rs.100 crores\n\nOru Kal Oru Kannadi – Rs.35 crores\n\nKalakalppu – Rs.25 crores\n\nNaan Eee – Rs.25 crores\n\nSundara Pandian – Rs.25 crores\n\nPizza – Rs. 7 crores\n\nNaduvula Konjam.. – Rs. 6 crores\n\nModerate hits\n\nNanban – Rs.60 crore\n\nVettai – Rs.40 crore\n\nVazhakku Enn 18/9 – Rs.20 crores\n\nKaadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Eppadi – Rs.10 crores\n\nNaan – Rs.15 crores\n\nAttakathi – Rs.10 crores\n\nFlops/Just pass\n\nBilla-2 – Rs.30 crore\n\nMugamoodi – Rs.10 crore\n\nSaguni – Rs.30 crore\n\nMuppozhuthum Un Karpanaigal – –\n\nMaattrraan – Rs.35 crore\n\n3 – Rs.20 crore\n\nAravaan – Rs.15 crore\n\nPoda Podi -\n\nMurattu Kaalai – Rs.2 crore\n\nThiruthani – Rs.2 crore\n\nThaandavam – Rs.30 crores\n\nAs Kollyinsider reported viewers earlier, Kollywood has enjoyed the screening of 150+ Tamil films in 2012 and only 7 films has made their successful run of 100 days. Many big [A-stars and big budget] Tamil movies failed to mark their presence at the box-office in 2012, while debutants and small movies marked hits. Let us now discuss about the hits and flops of Tamil Films released in 2012.\n\n[January- 7 releases]: 2012 has a good start with multi-starrers Nanban and Vettai for Pongal, which has recorded hit at the Chennai box-office with good run and collections. While Nanban has beaten Rajinikanth’s Enthiran openings and collections, Shankar has once again proved he is undisputed king of South India box-office collections by grabbing Rs.50+cr in the first week. Following this Lingusamy’s Vettai is also a box-office hit with Rs.15cr collections for first four days and Rs.56cr in its total run.\n\nInterestingly both Vettai and Nanban got 30% entertainment tax exemption from the Tamil Nadu Government, for being perfect entertainers, while other films Kollaikaran, Medhai, Paari, Settaithanam, Theni Maavattam bombed.\n\n[February- 14 releases]: After Nanban and Vettai are declared as moderate hits, small budgeting meaningful film Marina directed by Pandiraj stood as box office winner. Filmed on the people surviving on the banks of Marina beach in Chennai, Marina recorded a hit within no time of its release. Subsequently romantic entertainers KSY and MUK with Amala Paul as female lead opened well for Valentines weekend and had a significant run. While Siddharth’s Kadhalil Sodhapuvadu Yeppadi [KSY] enjoyed good run in multiplexes, Adharvaa’s Muppozhudhum Un Karpanaigal [MUK] grossed small screen viewers.\n\nNext comes Prakash Raj’s directorial and production debut Dhoni with the scores of Maestro Ilayaraja and Ambuli 3D, the first direct Tamil 3D film released with descent openings but didn’t go well with viewers and collapsed at Chennai BO along with Sengathu Bhoomiyile, Oru Mazhai Naangu Saaral, Oru Nadigaiyin Vaakkumoolam, Soozhnilai, Vachaathi, Vilayada Vaa, Udumban, Kathal Paathai and Virudhanagar Sandhippu.\n\n[March- 20 releases]: Besides being the month of examinations, March has a rush of 20 back to back releases. But only digital release of Sivaji Ganesan’s epic film Karnan succeeded, as Vasanthabalan’s period flick Aravaan with Aadhi and Dhansika, Krishna and Bindhu Madhavi’s Kazhugu directed by Sathyasiva and last but not least Aishwarya R Dhanush’s directorial debut 3 of Dhanush-Anirudh’s ‘Kolaveri di’ fame with Shruthi Hassan have made their presence felt but failed to make it big at the box-office. Coming to 3, it has enjoyed 100 days run but didn’t go well with the audiences as director couldn’t perfectly deal with the bi-polar disease being a debutant.\n\nBehind these Kondaan Koduthaan, Shankar Oor Rajapalayam, Naanga, Pathirama Pathukkunga, Sevarkodi, Maasi, Vinmeengal, Aayiram Muthangaludam Thenmozhi, Kadhal Pisase, Kandha, Nandha Nandhitha, Meeravudan Krishna, Mudhalvar Mahatma, Othakkuthirai, Otha Veedu and Suriya Nagaram are the other films released during March 2012 which could not collide with the concurrent releases and recorded.\n\n[April – 12 releases]: 2012 seems to be lucky for producer turn hero Udhayanidhi Stalin, who has enjoyed good audiences and recorded super-hit with his debut Oru Kal Oru Kannadi and established himself as a best actor alongside best producer. Hansika starred OKOK was made with a budget of Rs.13cr and bagged Rs.32cr and also made successful run of 100 days in theaters marking a super-hit for the Red Giant Movies banner.\n\nAfter OKOK, Andrew Louis’s Leelai was the second film that made its strong impact with Tamil audiences in April, which has received a positive mouth word and good run in Kollywood that can only be made by few small films with less publicity. While others namely Asthamanam, Mazhaikaalam, Nandu Bhaskar, Pachai Engira Kaathu, Aduthathu, Maattuthavani, Mye and Padam Parthu Kadhai Sol failed to collide with earlier releases.\n\n[May – 9 releases]: May has enjoyed the screening of comedy entertainer Kalakalappu and social script Vazhakku Enn 18/9. Directed by Sundar C casting Vimal, Shiva, Anjali and Oviya, Kalakalappu has entertained audiences to extent, which made makers plan to film the sequel of the movie with no time lag. And Balaji Sakthivel has come up with the social evil script Vazhakku Enn 18/9 starring newcomers. Vazhakku Enn 18/9 deals with the MMS scandals peeping high among youngsters, which also won many awards for its impact on viewers. Even after starring recognized stars Raattinam and Ishtam bombed for being comparable love stories alongside Gaantham, Parama Guruµ, Kandathum Kanadhathum, Anbulla Manvizhiye and Konjum Mainakkale.\n\n[June - 10 releases]: June is the largest month for Tamil releases with five Fridays, but has only 10 releases. Ezhil’s Manam Kothi Paravai is the one that gained good reviews and also opened doors for Siva Karthikeyan winning him the chances of ‘Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga’ and Dhanush’s ‘Ethir Neechal’.\n\nAnd films namely Thadaiyara Thaakka, Murattu Kaalai, Saguni being the noted big films with established actors like Karthi, Arun Vijay, Sundar C, Sneha, Mamta Mohandas, Raadhika, Santhanam couldn’t make their impact recording below average and flops at the Chennai box-office besides Idhayam Thiraiarangam, Mayanginen Thayanginen, Krishnaveni Panjaalai, Porkodi 10am Vaguppu, Thoothuvan and Marupadiyum Oru Kadhal.\n\n[July - 6 releases]: Out of the six movies released during July 2012 only Naan Ee and Ajith’s Billa 2 are the big films. While Nani, Samantha, Sudeep’s Naan Ee has recorded a hit with good audiences and collections, Chakri Toleti could not satisfy Thala Ajith fans with his action thriller script Billa 2, sequel of Billa that failed to grab the audiences even after Ajith doing dare-devil stunts and releasing the movie worldwide simultaneously in Telugu too. And Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey, Pechiyakka Marumagan, Pollangu and Suzhal are the films that collapsed.\n\n[August - 22 releases]: After March with 20 films August was a big season for Tamil releases in 2012 with 22 movies hit the screens and only Attakathi was an average while Jeeva’s Superhero script Mugamoodi made with Rs.20cr and collected Rs.55cr couldn’t go well through viewers along with Madhubana Kadai, Vinay’s Mirattal, Ganesh Venkatraman’s Panithulli, 18 Vayasu and Vijay Antony’s Naan.\n\nWhen we have superhit and good run of films we do have unnoticed movies too and Aasami, Yugam, Adhisaya Ulagam-3D, Eppadi Manasukkul Vanthai, Palayamkottai, Sri Ramakrishna Darsanam, conjoined twins story Iruvan, Etho Seithai Ennai, Pandi Oliperukki Nilayam, Poovampatty, Aachariyangal, Anil, Avan Appadithan, Perumaan and Valiban Suttrum Ulagam completes August releases.\n\n[September - 9 releases]: 2012 September enjoyed good run of Paagan, Sundarapandian, Charulatha, Saattai and Thaandavam, which have chartbusters but couldn’t stick long in theaters other than Sundarapandian. UTV Motion Pictures produced Thaandavam with Rs.20cr and the AL Vijay’s directorial has grabbed Rs.62cr, but Vikram, Anushka, Amy Jackson, Lakshmi Rai and Santhanam didn’t succeeded in making it a hit at the Chennai box-office. And the films that failed to make their presence felt are Arakkonam, Kalla Parunthu, Mannaru, Nellai Sandhippu.\n\n[October - 13 releases]: Following September, October also has the good run of Sridevi’s come back film ‘English Vinglish’, Suriya’s conjoined twins script Maatran, Vijay Sethupathi’s Pizza, Bharath’s come back Thiruthani and supporting actress turn director Lakshmi Ramakrishnan’s Aarohanam.\n\nOut of the 13 releases in Oct, Maattrraan turned above average due to audiences high expectations, Aarohanam is as inspiring directorial debut by Lakshmi and Bharath’s Thiruthani, Pudhiya Kaaviyam, Sembattai, Soundarya, Amridha Yokam, Koyambedu Perundhu Nilayam, Chakravarthy Thirumagan, Mayilu and Vavval Pasanga are the remaining those stood unnoticed.\n\n[November - 12 releases]: Only two are months left in 2012, which made November see a rush of 12 films. Vijay’s Thuppakki, Ammavin Kaipesi, NKPK, Neerparavai and long waited STR’s Podaa Podi along with Ariyaan, Asaivam, Magan, Yaaruku Theriyum, Ajantha, Kasi Kuppam and Kai are the films released in November 2012.\n\nPodaa Podi being the movie with debutants Varalakshmi Sarathkumar and Vignesh Shivan, Simbu’ s Podaa Podi has received mixed to best reviews from viewers. NKPK, Neerparavai and Ammavin kaipesi stood average to below average at the Chennai BO. Vijay-Kajal Agarwal’s Thuppakki directed by AR Murugadoss is the highest grosser and still running while remaining are flops.\n\n[December - 9 releases]: Finally December has arrived with 9 releases and many noted movies have postponed their releases due to unrevealed reasons. Small movies that are released on the last Friday [Dec 28] of 2012 and couldn’t stand best are Akilan, Paaraseega Mannan, Kandu Pudichitten, Puthumughangal Thevai and Kozhi Koovuthu. While earlier releases Vikram Prabhu’s debut Kumki is a super-hit, comparatively Jeeva-Samantha’s NEP is above average, Sattam oru Iruttarai opened to mixed reviews recording a below average film and not but not least Nasser’s directorial Sun Sun Thatha is opened only to multiplexes.\n\nAfter discussing about the hit and flops of 2012 releases, some big films bombed at Chennai box-office similarly many debutants have proved their mettle.
