        "text": "Chennai, Nov 18: Nearly after a year, filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon has called the shots for upcoming yet-untitled Tamil project recently with Simbu aka Silambarasan. He says he feels happy to be back.\n\n\"(I'm) very happy to be back at shoot after almost a year of waiting. (Shooting with) Str (Simbu) now and looking forward to (working with) Ajith sir from Feb 15,\" Menon posted on his Twitter page.\n\nHis last directorial release was Tamil-Telugu bilingual \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\", which hit the screens in 2012. The film turned out to be a box office disaster.\n\nHe was supposed to start working with Suriya.\n\nChennai, Sep 13: Reacting to rumours that she will sport a bikini in one of her upcoming Telugu films, southern actress Samantha Ruth Prabhu said audiences know that she is not a bikini material.\n\n\"If you have watched my films, you wouldn't need me to tell you that me sporting a bikini in my next is just a rumour. Put this to rest,\" posted Samantha on her Twitter page.\n\nHaving starred in big-ticket films such as \"Dookudu\", \"Brindavanam\" and \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\", Samantha has not donned the two piece swim wear in her films.\n\nCurrently busy shooting for Telugu films \"Manam\" and \"Auto Nagar Surya\", she.\n\nChennai, May 12: Tamil actors Dhanush, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and director Balaji Sakthivel won top honours at the 7th edition of the Vijay Awards.\n\nAs many as 30 awards were given away in different categories at a gala ceremony Saturday, including Chevalier Sivaji award for excellence in Indian cinema to Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nWhile Dhanush won the best actor male award for his performance in his wife Aishwarya's directorial debut \"3\", Samantha won the best actor female award for her work in \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\".\n\nTamil teen crime-thriller \"Vazhakku En 18/9\" was named the best film, while the.\n\nFilm: \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\"; Actors: Jiiva, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Vidyullekha Raman and Santhanam; Director: Gautham Vasudev Menon; Rating: ** - when love is boring.\n\nAs promised during the promotion of the film, Gautham's \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\" (Nep) could very well be anyone's love story. But, sadly, why will anyone want to revisit his or her love story if it's filled with fewer heartwarming moments and mostly egoistic clashes and blame games?\n\nNep definitely deserves some appreciation for successfully mirroring modern-day love-and-hate relationships. Sadly, though, it fails to engage the audience.\n\nChennai, Oct 14: Known for making romantic sagas, Gautham Vasudev Menon's next is \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\", and it will see actor-comedian Santhanam taking a dig at the filmmaker's previous films.\n\nA romantic saga, it is being shot simultaneously in Tamil as \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\" and in Telugu as \"Yeto Vellipoyindi Manasu\" with actor Nani.\n\n\"He (Santhanam) will be seen in very comical role in the film. He has spoofed scenes from Gautham's earlier films and they're sure to be a laugh riot,\" a source told Ians.\n\nStarring.\n\nChennai, Sep 27: India's largest chain of bakers, The French Loaf, will create a 100 meter long photo cake of 1,000 kg by compiling 1,000 photographs of maestro Ilayaraja on it.\n\nThe egg-less chocolate cake will have movie posters and pictures from films and concerts of Ilayaraja, arranged chronologically from his debut film \"Annakili\" to his latest project \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\".\n\nIt will be displayed at Express.\n\nChennai, Sep 19: Tamil filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon is all praise for actors Jiiva, Nani and Samantha Ruth Prabhu, and says working with them has been a memorable experience.\n\nHaving completed \"Neethaane En Ponvasantham\", a bilingual romantic film with the trio - with Nani in the Telugu version, and Jiiva and Samantha in Tamil version of the same film - director Gautham feels every film is a revelation.\n\n\"Every."
