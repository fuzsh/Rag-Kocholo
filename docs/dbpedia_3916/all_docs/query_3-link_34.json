        "text": "* Gautham, do you understand Tamil enough to know that a lifeless film like Neethaane En Ponvasantham is what we Tamils slam as a Blaydu Padam (Epic Bore)?\n\n* Machchi, did you realize that serious movie buffs who have watched Neethaane En Ponvasantham will consider you to be a Kilpauk Case having completely lost your marbles?\n\n* Dai Yechakale, did it take you less than a couple of hours to pen your latest outrage, Neethaane En Ponvasantham?\n\n* Gautham, do you understand that sane film-goers will shudder at the insanity of a ‘storyline’ suggesting Nithya and Varun were in love from the ages of eight through 24?\n\n* Menon, given the hopeless absence of a meaningful story in the film should we assume that Alva kudukradhu comes asalta for you?\n\n* Were you on Sulphata Sarakku when you made Neethaane En Ponvasantham because the movie makes absolutely no sense, not even as the romance you pitch it?\n\nGautham Vasudev Menon\n\n(Pix courtesy: Facebook)\n\n* Maramandai, does it make any sense that an extremely wealthy and intelligent girl like Nithya has nothing better to do in life than stick like a leech to a guy from a much lower economic strata?\n\n* Sweetie, do you ever watch movies that are not made by you?\n\n* Tubelight-Mama, after 12-years of making movies why is it still that hard for you to make a watchable movie with a decent script?\n\n* Oh, pray tell us why despite being obsessed with Varun and being with him all the time Nithya knows so little about his family or their financial situation?\n\n* Menon, did it not strike you that by making Santhanam’s comedy track the main track Neethaane En Ponvasantham would have been a million times better and a billion times more endurable?\n\n* Would you overdose if I told you that the audience for the premiere show of Neethaane En Ponvasantham was utterly bored and came to life only during Santhanam’s zany dialogs or antics?\n\n* Porambokku, was it your brainwave that a lot of crucial scenes in the film should be captured by long-shots so that the audience can see little of the emotions in the faces of Jiiva and Samantha??\n\n* Menon, what would you tell Tamil movie fans if Ilayaraja commits harakiri upon seeing how you massacred his fine music with rotten picturization?\n\n* Thambi, would your ego take a beating if I suggest you educate yourself on the craft of film-making before making your next film by watching some fine foreign films like Polisse, Hedgehog, A Separation, Monsieur Lazhar and Attack?\n\n* Kasmaalam, do kids in Tamil Nadu get on the high-intensity Lookku vudaradhu romance track in iskool itself as you suggest in Neethaane En Ponvasantham?\n\n* Does it not make you feel guilty that I paid $15 to watch your latest offensive Neethaane En Ponvasantham and came out reeling in shock at your hopelessly amateurish attempt at film-making?\n\n* Dai paruppu, do you think the entire Tamil population is full of baeku pasanga that they’ll swallow the nonsense of seeing Jiiva (a father) play a school kid?\n\n* Dhanda Soru, did you not feel the necessity of putting two mediocre actors like Jiiva and Samantha through intensive rehearsals before the shooting of the film commenced?\n\n* Were you not horror-struck to realize that the semma figuru (Samantha) does not have a single acting cell in her entire petite body?\n\n* Goiya, did no one tell you that you could have picked any Muniamma walking down Walltax Road and extracted a better performance from her?\n\n* Paradesi, can you share the secret with 68 million Tamils how you get people to finance your inane movies?\n\n* Kasmaalam, would you agree that without doubt this time your film has apu adchichu?\n\n* Gautam Vasudev Menon, were you aware that in Madurai they call folks like you posaketta paya (போசகட்ட பய)?\n\nN.B.: Folks, since Neethaane En Ponvasantham is an unendurably boring, vapid romance it richly deserves your raised middle fingers to this abomination."
