        "text": "The success of 'Mugamoodi' has given Jiiva a lot of confidence ahead of 'Neethane En Ponvasantham'.\n\nAfter 'Mugamoodi', Jiiva lost a lot of weight to fit into the character of a college student in this film.\n\nThe trailer of the film broke the record of the most ever viewed Tamil film trailer. Earlier, the record was held by 'Billa 2'.\n\nThe music launch of the film turned out to be a major success.\n\nAccording to sources, Jiiva would sport three different looks in 'NEP'.\n\nThe trailer of the film released on September 1, 2012, crossed 1.2 million views in just two days after its release on YouTube.\n\nDirector Gautham Menon is once again ready to surprise the audiences with his romantic comedy 'Neethane En Ponvasantham'.\n\nIlaiyaraaja is among one of the finest Indian music composers. He has weaved magic in the music department of the film.\n\nA teaser of 50 seconds starring Samantha and Jiiva with an instrumental version of the song 'Neethaane En Ponvasantham' playing in the background was released on Valentine's Day, 2012.\n\nSamantha will play the leading lady in all three versions of the film.\n\nAditya Roy Kapoor and Samantha will share the screen space in the Hindi version of 'Neethane En Ponvasantham'. The film is called 'Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau'.\n\n'NEP' is one of the most awaited films of the year.\n\nThe audience will once again expect Jiiva to come up with a good performance, but only time will tell whether he becomes successful in doing so or not."
