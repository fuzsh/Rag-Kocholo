As the world continues to enjoy the tracks produced by Maestro Illayaraja in Neethaane En Ponvasantham, producers and director Gautham Menon are trying hard to release the soundtrack in LP format which would give out the notes in Raja sir's composition even better.

NEP's songs have become a roaring hit among the public and listeners across the globe have been praising Illayaraja for coming up with wonderful music yet again. The team's attempt to get it out in LP sound format could only mean good news for fans who are anticipating the movie eagerly. Neethaane En Ponvasantham has Jiiva, Samantha and Santhanam in the lead and is produced by R.S. Infotainment.
