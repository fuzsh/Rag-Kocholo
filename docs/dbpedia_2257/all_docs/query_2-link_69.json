The document provides an introduction and transcription of parish registers from Hanham and Oldland Chapelries in Gloucestershire, England from 1584-1681. It describes the condition of the original parchment register, noting many torn pages and faded entries. It also notes entries were recorded promiscuously until 1604 when baptisms, marriages, and burials were recorded separately, with some burials crossed out from 1604-1610. The transcription contains baptism, marriage, and burial entries with many names, dates and places illegible due to the aged condition of the original register.",
