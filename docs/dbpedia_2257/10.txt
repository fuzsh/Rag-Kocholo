Thank you received: 2309

I'm going through online newspaper archives and other sources, looking for the grave locations of those who served in South Africa and who died in the British Isles. Over 1,000 names so far.

www.findagrave.com/virtual-cemetery/1297967

Below you have the date of death, or sometimes just the month and year, according to online obituaries and death notices, followed by the final resting-place of the body or ashes - not necessarily the place of death. All the below names can be seen in the virtual cemetery, sometimes with more information. Shorter obituaries don't always mention the individual's regiment, only that he took part in the South African War.
