"One hundred and twenty-seven years ago. I was thirty then. The Expedition... I was the pilot of the expedition to Fomalhaut. That's twenty-three light years. We're back... "Prometheus" - my ship - stayed on Luna. I arrived today. That's it." To the author of the hero of the book.

In "Return from the Stars", Stanislaw Lem predicted that the task of the problem, which will be the problem of people in the world of the future, will be the effective absence of problems. Stress-free life in civilization, whose fear does not see their happiness.

"'Return from the Stars' is a vision of the world imagined on the model of common ideas about the consumer society of the future. It is an answer to the question of what would happen if these ideas were exactly realized. He believed in the purpose of existence and faith in the meaning of life, fears and disappointments, desires and feelings” (A. Smuszkiewicz, “Zaczarowana gra”, Item 1982, pp. 246-247).
