        "text": "StanisÅaw Lem\n\nSecond paper, final draft due (submission link is on the Moodle page)\n\nStanisÅaw Lem (1921â2006), Poland.\n\nLem was born in LwÃ³w, Poland (which after WWII became Lviv, Ukraine), but after the Second World War his family settled in KrakÃ³w. He studied medicine and developed a strong interest in mathematics and other sciences. Although his early novels were rather traditional science fiction, his individual style and philosophy were blooming by the 1960âs. His work often stresses the disharmony between technological possibility and human intentions or possibilities and shows a tremendous stylistic and thematic variety. He attracted some bad press because of (carelessly? justifiably?) critical remarks about the quality of North American science fiction, which one might discuss in the context of the different roles of the genre in East and West over the past many years; we could talk about this in class. Lem was both well-respected and popular, a widely-read writer - you might note the large nummber of his books in translation, and (if you go check on bookshop.org) their relatively reasonable prices! In the early days of the World Wide Web there were TONS more sites devoted to Lem, that darling of geeky technies, than to a \"literary\" author like Kundera, say.\n\nNote that the âÅâ in StanisÅaw (though not the âLâ in Lem) has a cross-bar that makes it a different letter, pronounced something like the English âw,â and that Polish names are always stressed on the penultimate syllable: Stan-EE-swav.\n\nSolaris (1961) is probably Lem's best-known work, with television adaptations as well as into movies by Andrei Tarkovsky (1972) and Steven Soderbergh (2002). However, Cyberiada (1965; expanded edition 1974), brilliantly translated by the very talented Michael Kandel as The Cyberiad (1985), is great fun - it has a strong philosophical underpinning and the kind of dark undertones that often show up in humorous writing. I'm told that this book makes a wonderful gift for your favorite scientist.\n\nQuestions for reading:\n\nJust to start with, what is the effect of having such odd and difficult-to-pronounce names for our heroes? (They're odd in Polish too; you can see them at the bottom of the \"portraits\" of our constructors: Trurl is Trurl, but Klapaucius is Klapaucjusz.)\n\nIf you have read a lot of science fiction, what do these stories remind you of?\n\nIf you have not read a lot of science fiction, what do these stories suggest about the genre?\n\nOn the other hand, how can they be read in the context of the works we have already read this fall? What do they suggest about human society, science, history, language, etc.?\n\nHow may a science fiction plot, the things that are possible or verisimilar in a slightly or largely different world, differ and diverge from the plots of \"realistic\" literature?\n\nHow does Lem engage our sympathy for his characters? To what extend does he not bother to do so, and what are the results (if any) as the reader progresses through the book?\n\nAnd how about the many talking names (King Atrocitus), portmanteau names (Bartholocaust), and other wordplay? (as I mentioned before, the translation is brilliant)\n\nWhat kind of stories does the subtitle (\"Fables\") suggest? What is fable-like, or fabuluos, in Cyberiad? Would you expect to find kings and dragons in a science fiction story alongside the robots and rockets?\n\nGiven what you've learned about life and literature under socialism, what ideas might you have about the place of science fiction there - in the heady days of rocketry iof hte early 1960s, or around 1989-1991, or today (when, we hope, Lem's heirs can enjoy his richly-deserved royalties)?\n\nWhat is the role (waht are the roles) of love and sex, and what sort of gender relations do the stories provide?\n\nWhat do the stories illustrate, in best Fable style, about human flaws and foibles?\n\nHow does the mood of the stories, and the character of our constructors, change and develop over time?\n\nIf you were a Stalinis censor or a Vulgar Marxist critic, what might you object to in this book?\n\nSPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ unless you've made it a few stories into the book! - At what point does it become clear that Trurl and Klapaucius are not human beings?\n\nBooks by Lem, many of them in Tripod:\n\nSzpital Przemienienia, 1948.
