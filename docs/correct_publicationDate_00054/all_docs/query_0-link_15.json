Stanisław Lem's Return from the Stars recounts the experiences of Hal Bregg, an astronaut who returns from an exploratory mission that lasted ten years--although because of time dilation, 127 years have passed on Earth. Bregg finds a society that he hardly recognizes, in which danger has been eradicated. Children are \"betrizated\" to remove all aggression and violence--a process that also removes all impulse to take risks and explore. The people of Earth view Bregg and his crew as \"resuscitated Neanderthals,\" and pressure them to undergo betrization. Bregg has serious difficulty in navigating the new social mores. While Lem's depiction of a risk-free society is bleak, he does not portray Bregg and his fellow astronauts as heroes. Indeed, faced with no opposition to his aggression, Bregg behaves abominably. He is faced with a choice: leave Earth again and hope to return to a different society in several hundred years, or stay on Earth and learn to be content. With Return from the Stars, Lem shows the shifting boundaries between utopia and dystopia.… (more)\n\n▾Tags\n\n▾LibraryThing Recommendations\n\n▾Lists\n\nNone\n\n▾Will you like it?\n\nLoading...\n\nSign up for LibraryThing to find out whether you'll like this book.\n\n▾Conversations (About links)\n\nNo current Talk conversations about this book.\n\n» See also 10 mentions\n\n▾Other authors\n\n» Add other authors (12 possible)\n\nAuthor nameRoleType of authorWork?StatusLem, StanisławAuthorprimary authorall editionsconfirmedKurecka, MariaTranslatorsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmedMarszal, BarbaraTranslatorsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmedRey, LuisCover artistsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmedSimpson, FrankTranslatorsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmed\n\n▾Series and work relationships\n\n▾Awards and Honors\n\n▾Common Knowledge\n\nYou must log in to edit Common Knowledge data.\n\nFor more help see the Common Knowledge help page.\n\nCanonical title Original title Alternative titles Original publication date People/Characters Important places Important events Related movies Epigraph Dedication Quotations Disambiguation notice Publisher's editors Blurbers Canonical DDC/MDS Canonical LCC\n\n▾References\n\nReferences to this work on external resources.\n\nWikipedia in English (1)\n\nReturn from the Stars\n\n▾Book descriptions\n\nAn astronaut returns to Earth after a ten-year mission and finds a society that he barely recognizes.
