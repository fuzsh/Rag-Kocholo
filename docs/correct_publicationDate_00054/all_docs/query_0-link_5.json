        "text": "Astronaut Hal Bregg has just returned to Earth after an exploratory mission to Arcturus and points beyond. But while only ten years have passed for him, 127 have gone by on Earth—and the planet to which he has come home has changed so utterly as to be virtually unrecognizable. Cars and planes have been replaced by gleeders and ulders; you can still get coffee for breakfast, but instead of eggs or toast the choice is among ozote, kress or herma. People, too, have changed. A chemical process called \"betrization,\" now mandatory for all children, has all but eliminated mankind's aggressive impulses, producing a race of mild-mannered, casually ineffectual pleasure seekers who react to Bregg's exploits with mind-boggling indifference. \"Everything is now lukewarm,\" an aged physician tells the bewildered Bregg.\n\nRead more ...\n\nStanislaw Lem's novel Return from the Stars dates from 1961, the year of Solaris, and begins with precisely the same effect of mystery, of (in Darko Suvin's helpful phrase) estrangement. The plot is startlingly conventional: the hero returns from a faster-than-light journey of great hardship and danger to a world a century in his future; how will he cope? The opening chapters of this first-person narrative present the new world in a way that constantly breaks the norms of realism. You don't know where you are, as the hero doesn't; you perceive a world through it's baffled glimpses, distortions, inability to make sense. 'The girl, wearing a bright dress that was quite ordinary, which encouraged me, held a bouquet of pale pink flowers; nestling her face in them, she smiled at the boy with her eyes. At the moment I stood before them and was opening my mouth to speak, I saw that she was eating the flowers — and my voice failed me. She was calmly chewing the delicate petals.'\n\nRead more ...\n\n\"As a doctor, I really have nothing more to tell you, Bregg; however... \"\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You are coping in our . . . present way of life?\"\n\n\"Muddling along.\"\n\n\"Your hair is gray, Bregg.\"\n\n\"That means something?\"\n\n\"Yes. Gray hair signifies age. No one turns gray now before eighty, and even then, rarely.\"\n\nRead more ..."
