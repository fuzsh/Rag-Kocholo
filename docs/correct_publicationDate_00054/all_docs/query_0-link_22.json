        "text": "A slow one from Lem\n\nAs a Lem fan, getting a story that meanders around to make various points is something of a norm. This is not his best work in that regard.\n\nAs usual, there's something interesting going on in the background, but that seems less well handled in this case than other books.\n\nLem is also not known for the women he writes. This book is particularly painful in that regard, and it was frequently tempting to put down for that reason.\n\nAs someone that loves Lem, I'm very glad this isn't the first book of his I experienced.\n\nStarts slow, then it gets intense\n\nI'm a huge Lem fan and I always left this book aside. I decided to finally give it a chance only now.\n\nThe book starts slowly and sets you up for some less serious / goofy adventure in a not so distant future. By the time you start understanding more of the background of the characters and the world you realize that the story is so much deeper and intense. Lots of high quality sci-fi content worthy of the good ol' Stan. Totally recommend.\n\nOut of 10 stars I would do 9, only because...\n\nThe only 10 stars i would give is to Lem and Tolkien. i Only say 9/10 to respect the other works of Stanislaw that I believe are greater than this one. I fear the translation into the limited English language may have hurt this book. Time to learn Polish just to read Lem!\n\nSlow start but returns to form\n\nThe beginning lost me on my first read as it came off as goofy outdated speculative fiction. However, when I revisited it the book returns to Lem's form with some heady sci-fi ideas accompanied by steadily rising action and an impactful end. Also the audio performance was right on point.\n\nSome of the more emotional and intense scenes may also come off as odd but I think romance just isn't his strong suit.\n\nStarts well but...\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThe opening sequence of the book describing the astronauts return to earth was genuinely masterful. Brilliant really. I have never encountered such a perfect evocation of cultural confusion.\n\nAfter that I figured I was in for one terrific book.\n\nUnfortunately, it was all downhill from there. The main character is rather unlikable. Not always a problem in a book but in this case it seemed important to empathize with him. I found it difficult. Especially as the book quickly degenerated into a pretty tiresome romance. I gave up near the end.\n\nPart of my problem with the book might have been the narrator's voice and inflection. I found it off putting and continually wondered if I would have been so irritated by the astronaut had I been simply reading the book. Who knows?\n\nWhatever the case. This is no Solaris."
