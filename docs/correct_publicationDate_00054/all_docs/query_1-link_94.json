        "text": "The phenomenon of Stanislaw Lem’s literary works, exploring new forms of science fiction and futuristic literature, and often connected with philosophic reflections, is still not fully recognized and praised even in Poland. Theodore Sturgeon – an American writer honored by introduction to The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame called Lem “the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.”\n\nLem was born in Lviv on Sept. 12, 1921 (just a few months after the Polish-Soviet War, which resulted in returning eastern territories of the former Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Lviv, to Poland). He was a son of a wealthy physician Samuel Lem and Sabina née Woller.\n\nDespite his family’s Jewish roots, Stanisław was raised as a Catholic. After the invasion and occupation of the eastern part of Poland by Soviets in 1939, Soviet authorities denied him the ability to study at the local Polytechnic because of his family’s “bourgeois origin”. Thanks to his father’s connections he started medical studies. In 1941, Germans attacked the Soviet Union and occupied Lviv, so Lem couldn’t continue studies and had to work as a car mechanic and a welder.\n\nAfter WWII, the Lem family as well as hundreds of thousands of Poles were “repatriated” to Poland, as Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union’s Ukraine. They settled in Cracow, where his father had to work in a hospital. He was not allowed to open his own private clinic. Stanisław continued medical studies at the Jagiellonian University, but after completing them he intentionally didn’t take final exams to avoid being drafted as a military doctor in the Polish People’s Army.\n\nIn 1946, the first of Lem’s literary works – poems and a science fiction short story The Man on the Moon – were published. Lem was earning a living by working as a scientific research assistant at the Jagiellonian University. He also cooperated with “Tygodnik Powszechny” (one of a few liberal periodicals at that time in Poland), where his early short stories were published.\n\nIn 1948, Lem finished writing his first novel Hospital of the Transfiguration, but because he refused to write an additional part of it in the style required by communistic propaganda, it was not published until 1955. In 1978, a film director Edward Żebrowski adapted it in the form of a full-length movie. It presented the moral aspects of Nazis killing mentally ill patients in hospitals and sanatoriums.\n\nIn 1950, Lem met Jerzy Pański, president of the publishing corporation Czytelnik, who helped the young writer publish a novel Astronauts (1951), which became a bestseller. It describes a plot by an outerspace civilization to invade and destroy Earth.\n\nSoon, Lem became a member of the Association of Polish Writers and wrote a couple of short stories in the style of “social realism” and a drama Yacht Paradise, which criticized “American imperialism”. In the later years of his writing career Lem intentionally didn’t permit reprinting of those works.\n\nIn 1954, Lem married a student of medicine Barbara Leśniak, and in 1968 their son was born. The life of the Lem family reflects the misery of the financial situation of artists in the PRL at that time. Before marriage Stanisław, his father, and his mother shared one room with a friend from Lviv. In 1954, after Stanisław’s father’s death, he and his wife shared a two-room apartment with his mother, whom they cared for and supported.\n\nThe “political thaw” in the PRL after the workers protests in Poznań in 1956 and the coming to power of Władysław Gomółka as the First Secretary of PZPR opened a new perspective for Polish writers.\n\nIn 1957, Lem’s Dialogs written in a form corresponding to Plato’s Dialogs were published, analyzing the mechanisms of totalitarian power, cybernetic, and social reactions. The same year The Star Diaries hit the readers’ market, describing new cosmic journeys of a pilot ‒ Ijon Tichy.\n\nIn 1959, three science fiction books by Lem were published. In 1961, three more books including the famous Solaris amazed the public. Solaris was adapted by the film industry as a movie three times. Lem’s works became recognized internationally and millions of copies were published. Nearly every year in the decade of the 1960s was brought a new book by Lem. In 1964, Lem’s Summa Technologies explored new forms and themes for science fiction connected to philosophy, sociology of science, and futurology. In 1966, an autobiographical novel High Castel included the author’s reminiscences from pre-war Lviv.\n\nIn the 1970s Lem supported the anti-regime movement publishing essays based on Polish dissidents in Paris in the monthly “Culture”. In 1982, after Martial Law in Poland, the Lem family sought refuge in West Berlin, and then in Vienna. In 1988, they returned to Poland.\n\nLem died in Cracow on March 27, 2006. His books were translated into 41 languages and sold over 45 million copies.\n\nLem was an honorary member of the Science Fiction Writers of America, but he was critical about American science fiction writers works as “poorly written and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms”. He was honored with an honorary doctorate by Wroclaw University of Technology, University of Opole, and University of Bielefeld, Germany. He was a recipient of the Austrian literary Franz Kafka Prize and the Austrian State Prize for European Literature.\n\nEven a planet, marked by the number 3836 and discovered in 1979, was named “Lem” after the famous Polish writer. There is a website www.lem.pl run by Lem’s son and promoting the rich literary legacy of Stanisław Lem."
