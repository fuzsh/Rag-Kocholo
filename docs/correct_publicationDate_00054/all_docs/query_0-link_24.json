First U.S. edition. \"Shows Earth with highly developed technology, a world where all work is performed by robots.\" - Dunn and Erlich (editors), The Mechanical God, p. 246. \"Return from the Stars is one of Lem's several works focusing on utopia. Out of those, it is the least pessimistic about the consequences of technological progress and their effect on our sociocultural evolution. Even so, the depicted world is not perfect: in a pacified society, with no conflict, stress, and danger, Lem argues that humans will become unable to take any risks, to take initiative, commit themselves to any serious tasks, and even lose the ability for self-assertion and for feeling strong emotions. Return from the Stars asks whether some sociocultural advances, like peace, are worth the price we may pay for losing part of our nature\" (Wikipedia). A translation of POWRÓT Z GWIAZD (1961). A fine copy in fine dust jacket priced $8.95 on the front flap. (#173578)."
