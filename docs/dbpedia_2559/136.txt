Michigan's nearly 4 million acres of state forest lands provide our state with clean air and water, materials for a strong forest products industry, and places to hunt, fish, hike, ride ORVs and camp.

We take forest management seriously. That means maintaining our sustainability certifications and carefully planning out how we care for state forests. These management strategies include science-based methods such as planting and harvesting trees, improving wildlife habitat, reducing wildfire risk with careful prescribed burning and controlling invasive pests so we'll have forests now and for future generations.
