Peninsula helps Australian small business owners run safe, fair and compliant workplaces. We do this by giving employers like you the advice, support and documentation you need to comply with Australia's Fair Work Act 2009.

Sound complex? It is, which is why we're here. It might be better to think of us as your partner in employee management and workplace safety.

Our services take the complexity out of workplace laws to help small business employers protect their business and their people.

If you're an employer, then we're here to help you.

We'd like to think that the main benefit of using Peninsula is confidence. Confidence that you are meeting your obligations as an employer, that you are running a safe workplace and that you are building a great business.
