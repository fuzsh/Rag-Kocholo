Board of Education (1954)\n\nHolding: Separate schools are not equal.\n\nIn Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Supreme Court sanctioned segregation by upholding the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People disagreed with this ruling, challenging the constitutionality of segregation in the Topeka, Kansas, school system.

The Court unanimously rejected this argument and held that only the federal courts can decide when the Constitution is violated.\n\nEngel v. Vitale (1962)\n\nHolding: School initiated-prayer in the public school system violates the First Amendment.\n\nIn the New York school system, each day began with a nondenominational prayer acknowledging dependence upon God.

Madison (1803)\n\nHolding: Established the doctrine of judicial review.\n\nIn the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue certain judicial writs. The Constitution did not give the Court this power. Because the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, the Court held that any contradictory congressional Act is without force.

Madison which establishes the concept of judicial review.\n\nMcCulloch v.

Simmons (2005)\n\nHolding: It is cruel and unusual punishment to execute persons for crimes they committed before age 18.\n\nMatthew Simmons was sentenced to death for the murder of a woman when he was 17 years of age. In the 1988 caseThompson v. Oklahoma, the Supreme Court ruled that executing persons for crimes committed at age 15 or younger constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

These addresses were conducted over the school's loudspeakers and usually involved a prayer. Attendance at these events was voluntary. Three students sued the school arguing that the prayers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. A majority of the Court rejected the school's argument that since the prayer was student initiated and student led, as opposed to officially sponsored by the school, it did not violate the First Amendment. The Court held that this action did constitute school-sponsored prayer because the loudspeakers that the students used for their invocations were owned by the school.\n\n*This case relates to students.\n\nTerry v. Ohio (1968)\n\nHolding: Stop and frisks do not violate the Constitution under certain circumstances.\n\nObserving Terry and others acting suspiciously in front of a store, a police officer concluded that they might rob it.

Nixon (1974)\n\nHolding: The President is not above the law.\n\nThe special prosecutor in the Watergate affair subpoenaed audio tapes of Oval Office conversations.

The Supreme Court ruled that the defendants' right to potentially exculpating evidence outweighed the President's right to executive privilege if national security was not compromised.\n\nZelma v. Simmons-Harris (2002)\n\nHolding: Certain school voucher programs are constitutional.\n\nThe Ohio Pilot Scholarship Program allowed certain Ohio families to receive tuition aid from the state.
