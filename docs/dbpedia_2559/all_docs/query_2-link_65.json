        "text": "MSF Public Comment Policy\n\nMichigan Strategic Fund Board meetings are held in-person at the principal office of the Michigan Strategic Fund located at 300 N. Washington Square, Lansing, Michigan 48913 and are open to members of the public. In June 2023, the MSF Board voted to adopt a public comment policy to help facilitate orderly conduct of the meetings and ensure all members of the public attending the meetings have a fair and adequate opportunity to make a comment pursuant to the Open Meetings Act. The MSF and MEDC value public comments and appreciate members of the public taking time to join us and share their perspectives on projects taking place throughout the state.\n\nIn March 2024, the Michigan Strategic Fund Board voted to adopt a revised public comment policy designed to expand the opportunity for public comment by permitting members of the public who are not in attendance at the meeting to comment using telecommunications technology.\n\nA copy of the Public Comment Policy is available here. For those who will not be attending the meeting, but would like to provide a public comment using telecommunications technology, you must register prior to the meeting by clicking on the button below. The Board Liaison will call your name or the last 4 digits of your phone number to signal your turn to speak.\n\nPublic comments and supporting materials may also be submitted in writing to the board at [email protected]. In order to ensure that members of the MSF Board have access to comments and materials submitted via email, they must be provided no later than noon the day prior to the scheduled meeting. The MEDC cannot guarantee that materials provided after this deadline will be incorporated into the board materials for the scheduled meetings."
