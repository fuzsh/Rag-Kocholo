        "text": "RCAH 112: Writing Research Technologies\n\nSection 001 (MacDonald)\n\nGlobal Fan Practices: Translation, Subtitling, Fanfiction and Fanart\n\nThis section of RCAH 112 explores the processes by which fans of film, theatre, literature, television, and music overcome linguistic difference and geographic distance to engage with the cultural texts they love. Including but not limited to remediation, translation, and distribution, global fan practices will inspire us to research and write about a multitude of cultural exchanges. As fandoms are often social, the course will investigate how communities are formed and maintained around a shared interest in a particular object of fandom or a particular nation’s popular culture, both physically and virtually. We will research the origins of fandom, considering sports and theatre celebrities of the 19th and early 20th centuries, film and television fandoms around brands such as Disney and franchises such as Star Trek, and literary fandoms around authors such as Jane Austen and characters such as Harry Potter. We will also study how digital technologies and online platforms facilitate fan practices today, considering, for example, Chinese fans who subtitle across a firewall. Students will formulate their own research projects and working with a range of printed and digital sources, they will develop their writing skills through in class writing tasks, peer review, transformative works, essays, and presentations.\n\nSection 003 (McCarthy)\n\nAmerica’s Second Reconstruction, 1954–1973: Culture and Society\n\nPopular images of the 1960s in the United States frequently depict activists, artists, and critics willing social change into existence by sheer moral force. Yet often deep structural changes in economies, institutions, laws, policies, and technologies were the cause of radical dissent just as much as they were its consequence. Activists fought for decades to secure Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision mandating school desegregation. Yet many activists saw it as a mixed victory. By preparing new grounds for the emergent Civil Rights Movement—an antagonistic coalition of civil rights activists, laborites, professional-class liberals, and radical students—the decision helped set a specific and deeply fraught course for future civil rights activism. Feminist critics such as Simone de Beauvoir and Betty Friedan found a popular audience for their writings when married women around the world, for economic reasons mostly unrelated to feminist criticism, found themselves compelled to seek wage labor. Magnetic tape and the transistor radio, new technologies forged within the military industrial complex, made possible an epochal shift in popular music from jazz to rock and roll.\n\nStudents in this section of RCAH 112 will improve their ability to appreciate and investigate interrelations between culture and society such as these. They will read cultural texts from America’s Second Reconstruction, including advertisements, books, experimental compositions, “happenings,” magazines, movies, paintings, plays, poems, popular songs, and television shows. They will consider current historical interpretations of these texts. And in weekly consultation with other course participants, each student will develop an independent research project on a cultural text of their choosing, adapting theories and methods cultivated in class and contributing new knowledge to ongoing class discussions. Students who complete the course should leave better prepared to think critically about the contradictory and compromised nature of human activities grounded in evolving historical situations.\n\nSection 004 (Hamilton-Wray)\n\nWriting Research Technologies: Daughters of the Screen and Black Women’s Film Practice\n\nLong before the “#Oscars So White” and “4% Challenge” campaigns, Black women artists have asserted their voices in the medium of film – creating, what some might call, a Black female gaze. What is the Black female gaze in film? This course interrogates the social, political, economic, and artistic implications of Black female-centered cinema. Students are introduced to Black Feminist Film Theory in the study of Black women’s film practice. Thus, students will draw on Black women’s literary practice and activism, and consider the politics of production, distribution, and exhibition in their investigation of Black women’s film practice. This research process course asks students to undertake an original research project that incorporates primary and secondary texts and requires them to use their newly acquired media literacy skills. Class assignments typically include oral presentations, interviews, and creative presentations.\n\nSection 005 (Torrez)\n\nActivist Literacies: Writing for Change\n\n\"One of the strategies which Indigenous peoples have employed effectively to bind people together politically is a strategy which asks that people imagine a future that they rise above present-day situations which are generally depressing, dream a new dream and set a new vision. The confidence of knowing that we have survived and can only go forward provides some impetus to a process of envisioning.” Taking Linda Smith’s words as central to activist work, we will explore various ways in which youth voices have engaged in various forms of literacy practices to envision a better future. Examining texts from children’s books to Twitter to protest signs, we will discuss how, when and why certain literacy practices have pushed for change. The course is structured to encourage students to examine, explore, and participate in practices covered in class.\n\nRCAH 202: The Presence of the Past\n\nSection 001 (Aerni-Flessner)\n\nGlobal Slavery\n\nThis class looks at how slaves in many places around the world have produced not only goods and services, but also shaped a wide range of societies. We will look at Africa, the Caribbean, North and South America, and places in the Indian Ocean to examine and compare different forms of slavery across time and space. We will be looking at how these systems of involuntary labor were similar and different—and debate what exactly qualifies to be called “slavery.” The globalized world we live in is shaped, in many ways, by the past and the present of slavery. By bringing the story into our present contexts, we will better explain why knowing the history of enslavement is important, and help you better understand why debates about monuments, reparations, and human rights continue to be contentious.\n\nSection 002 (Miner)\n\nThe (Visual) Presence of the Past – DOCUMENTARIES AND COMICS\n\nAs humans, we cannot escape the way that history continues to shape our contemporary lives. History is not a singular Truth waiting our discovery; nor is it meaningless, as our contemporary moment seems to indicate. By critically understanding “history,” and our shared roles in constructing it, we may begin to construct a more democratic and egalitarian society. This class will focus on non-fiction films (documentaries) and non-fiction graphic novels (comics) to understand how meaning is constructed and the role that the artist places in this process. Students will begin to see how the past remains central to our everyday activities, how artists and filmmakers represent it, and how we are individually and collectively active in constructing the past.\n\nSection 003 (Esquith)\n\nPeacebuilding through Art, Humanities, and Engineering\n\nAccording to some, peace is achieved when one side wins a war and then all sides abide by the terms of a peace treaty that are dictated by the winning side. This is called victor’s peace and it is typically temporary, as the losing side looks for ways to regain what it has lost or sometimes even take revenge. Victor’s peace does not address the root causes of war. That takes more time, effort, and mutual understanding, which is why it is called peacebuilding. To build peace, we must look at how the arts, humanities, social sciences, and engineering play complementary roles in the peacebuilding process. Each of these disciplines poses different questions about the peace building process. For example:\n\nWhat stories can we tell that will reconcile the warring sides?\n\nWhat moral principles and values can and should guide the process of reconciliation?\n\nWhat new social institutions and structures for education, health, transportation, communications, energy, and security should be built around these stories and according to these principles and values?\n\nStudents will work in interdisciplinary teams on projects that contribute to the goal of peacebuilding. Each team will choose its own peacebuilding project to cope with an urgent problem that has led to violent conflict (e.g., immigration, climate change, pandemics, inequality) and collaboratively design a strategy so that the project will be technically effective, culturally meaningful, and morally acceptable to the opposing parties.\n\nRCAH 203: Transcultural Relations\n\nSection 001 (Thobani)\n\nAt Home in the World?: Identity and Diaspora in Transnational Contexts\n\nWhat happens to the idea of ‘home’ when people migrate and settle elsewhere? In what ways are identities produced in the context of migration? How do these diasporas (communities of people who now live outside their ‘homeland’) engage with questions of race, class, gender and nationality? We take up these questions by studying the relationship between ‘those who moved’, ‘those who stayed put’, and ‘those who are already there’ – or in other words, the relationship between ‘homeland’, ‘diaspora’ and ‘host society’. Rather than take the diaspora as a given, we will study how diasporas are made, paying particular attention to the role of cultural production (media, literature, the arts, etc.) in this process. So doing, we will also interrogate questions of belonging, nostalgia, and authenticity. Our focus will not be limited to one particular diasporic community, instead our aim in this course is to study the connections that exist between and across different cultural groups in the transnational present.\n\nSection 750 (Delgado, V/Hinds)\n\nDesigning for Peace (EGR/RCAH Peace Engineering Initiative)\n\nGiven the challenges of global conflict and sustainability, how should we design for peace and human security? This is a complex question that calls for designers, artists, ethicists and others to imagine, design and implement creative solutions to human conflicts – solutions that can radically transform and improve human and natural wellbeing. In other words, it challenges us to design technologies, programs and even murals and movements differently. As a response, we will explore: global challenges to sustainability; the role of design, technology and development in their creation; and the promise of new ideas in the arts and humanities about sustainability and design. Students will collaborate remotely with an education center working with campesina and indigenous girls in Hone Creek, Costa Rica, and use their learning in a March 7 – March 13, 2021, education abroad program to complete engaged design projects on education with residents. Maximum program fee $450, plus airfare.\n\nRCAH 215: Introduction to Arts\n\nSection 001 (Baibak)\n\nReclamation Studio Project\n\nArt thou thinking about our climate footprint? Reclamation Studio Project is a workshop based on gleaning, reuse, and transformation of found, second-hand, or inherited objects. The course is designed to help alter our perception of objects, so we can see them as an available resource for base materials: plastic, metal, wood, or fiber. We will dissect forms to discover their potential frameworks, cavities, openings, and abstractions. We will look at connective materials, including bolts, wires, rivets, interlocking tabs, springs, hinges, and lashings. We will experiment. These methods will aid us in fashioning objects that visually and physically enhance our daily passage. We will examine the utilitarian and abstract, and the importance of both. The class will read articles about reusing materials from “our great abundance”, and we will regularly visit MSU Surplus as a partner and sometimes art studio. MSU Surplus is the hub of the universities recycling and resource management. Reclamation Studio’s goal is to help us to become more aware of available resources and to highlight our own responsibility as consumers.\n\nSection 002 (MacDonald)\n\nIntroduction to Acting: From the Inside Out and the Outside In\n\nUsing a range of warmups, theatre games, improvisation, and acting exercises, this course introduces different approaches to developing acting skills. We will study practitioners such as Stanislavski and Chekhov, and establish a toolkit for building characters, using our voices, minds, bodies, and emotions. Working as an ensemble, students will learn how to work with their own imagination and impulses, breakdown scripts, develop character psychology and physicality, and apply this to monologues and scenework in class. We will learn how to lead physical and vocal warmups, and how to undertake basic dramaturgical work as an actor. Along with analysing scripts, and developing characters, students will learn basic acting vocabulary and be able to discuss their practice, in class as well as in an oral defence of their work. We will work collaboratively and respectfully, to develop an understanding and appreciation of the craft of acting.\n\nRCAH 225: Introduction to Community Engagement\n\nSection 001 (Monberg)\n\nServing vs. Sustaining Community\n\nThis course introduces students to current understandings and histories of community engagement, with a particular focus on the role the arts and humanities have played in community engagement and social change. We will focus on core concepts and models of community engagement in RCAH and beyond by exploring the differences between serving a community and sustaining one over time. The aim of the course is to prepare students for more intensive community engagement by introducing them to community-based movements, how the contexts surrounding these movements shift over time, and the role the arts and humanities can play in building and sustaining more just, equitable communities and constellations. Students will build on the work and projects of previous community engagement courses.\n\nSection 002 (Torrez)\n\nCreating Space for Community Work\n\nThis course will investigate models of engagement with youth from diverse backgrounds. We will consider the complex societal issues directly impacting the lives of their young collaborators, and how we can collaboratively work through community engagement. This course will focus on ways to engage youth, the impacts of various models of engagement, and provide strategies to maintain a symbiotic and collaborative relationship. Visiting with several community organizers across the state, we will discuss best practices for community engagement.\n\nRCAH 235: Introduction to Language and Culture\n\nSection 001 (Plough)\n\nLanguage as a Social and Cultural Phenomenon\n\nThis is an introductory course in the study of language and culture. We begin by asking ‘what is culture’ and then explore language as a social and cultural phenomenon. Topics include the linguistic behaviors and attitudes that develop and are questioned as a result of the interaction of language in social contexts, and the sociocultural factors that influence language forms, functions, and use. How language variation (across, for example, regions, age, social class, gender, level education) constructs and is constructed by identity and culture is also covered. A foundation of concepts, terminology, and research paradigms is established.\n\nRCAH 315: Methods in Arts\n\nSection 001 (Scales)\n\nSongwriting and Music Production\n\nThis class involves the creation and recording of popular music, from the initial stages of songwriting through to the recording of those songs. Students will explore the challenges of the creative process, develop their musicianship skills, and become proficient in digital recording technologies, including various kinds of microphones, microphone placements, and some of the basic principles of acoustics. Part of this process will also include analyzing songs we love and those we love to hate. Students should have the minimum ability to perform in some fashion the music they currently enjoy to listen to and create.\n\nRCAH 316: Topics in Arts\n\nSection 001 (Russell)\n\nMusic Without Full Instrumentation: Poetics of Sound\n\nIn an interview for Hot Metal Bridge, the poet Terrance Hayes says, “Language is just music without the full instrumentation.” The poet, visual artist, permacultarist, and composer Julie Patton complicates that view with visual poems that she describes, in the Jazz and Culture journal, as “sketches which double as open-ended vocal-scores or sound texts.” Patton’s work suggests the immediate question: How do we vocalize a textual image? What do we consider as we commit sound to paper? And how do we perform sound in public? In this course, we will explore those questions and consider how cultural, class, racial, and ethnic background; mono- or multilingualism; disability; embodiment; and public space factor into poets’ practices with sound. We will engage with sound as tool, as material, as constraint, and even as metaphor as it manifests across a number of poetic projects—exploring sound terms, techniques, innovations, and possibilities. Alongside their explorations of poetry published in various mediums, students will work both individually and collaboratively to produce their own written and recorded poems.\n\nRCAH 325: Methods in Community Engagement\n\nSection 001 (Brooks)\n\nHealth and Wellness in our Communities\n\nThis course on engagement and reflection assists students with developing a deeper understanding of community engagement and cultivates a commitment to improving personal and community health and wellness. Students will be introduced to various methods in community engagement to address select issues and challenges affecting the health and wellbeing of our communities. Topics explored consist of historical and cultural perspectives on health/wellness, psychosocial challenges to healthy living, environmental concerns, chronic diseases, alternative interventions and resources, and health policy studies. The goals of this course are to improve health literacy, draw attention to health disparities, and encourage greater participation in physical activity. In addition, students will complete experiential learning exercises off campus that build relationships with civic organizations.\n\nRCAH 326: Topics in Community Engagement\n\nSection 001 (Delgado, G)\n\nThe Prison Poetry ‘Zine Project\n\nThe goals of this course are to investigate the history of mass incarceration in the US; to understand why art and educational programming is critical to the rehabilitation and well-being of incarcerated communities; and to gain the skills necessary to facilitate community engagement projects within marginalized populations. During weekly visits to prisons you will work side-by-side with incarcerated adults and children writing poems and creating ‘zines. You will examine the works by poets who wrote while in prison including Etheridge Knight, Jimmy Baca Santiago, Marilyn Buck, and Reginald Dwayne Betts. At the end of each prison project you’ll co-facilitate and participate in the culminating slam poetry events.\n\nSection 002 (Rivera)\n\nBecoming a Community Educator\n\nThis course is an exploratory course designed for students of all backgrounds and interests who have a desire to learn more about nonformal teaching and learning within communities. We will examine key research and theory underlying recent thinking about community education and learning, as well as examine the elements of teaching that transcend the more common formal school-teaching environment. This course is designed to guide students in reflecting upon their experiences to help them better understand the decisions they make as nonformal educators/change agents. Students have the opportunity to pursue their own interests in nonformal teaching and leaning through a community-based learning assignment. The course work and readings are designed to build on these experiences throughout the semester and provide concepts and skills to apply in the field.\n\nSection 003 (Delgado, V)\n\nDesigning for Community (EGR/RCAH Peace Engineering Initiative)\n\nHow do we collaborate with communities to respond to global conflict, globalization, climate change and sustainability? Finding the answer, will challenge students to explore advanced community participatory methodologies that design and build peace collaboratively using the arts, humanities, reflection, social responsibility, community voice, and transparency. Such work will require students to: consider the latest research on participatory design, community autonomy, and biocultural sustainability; engage in ideas and modalities in the arts and humanities, including storytelling, histories, ethics and others; and develop the critical engagement skills necessary to share these new ideas with community partners in Costa Rica and engineering students at MSU. Together RCAH and engineering students will collaborate remotely with the permaculture coffee farm and environmental education center, LIFE Monteverde, in Canitas, Costa Rica, in their ongoing efforts to develop a center for community resilience.\n\nRCAH 336: Topics in Language and Culture\n\nSection 001 (Aerni-Flessner)\n\nLesotho, Complex Culture in Southern Africa\n\nA mountainous, landlocked country in southern Africa might not be the first place you think of when you want to explore how language and culture intersect with history, art, and literature. However, the endless mountains and history of being an independent enclave in the middle of the apartheid state make Lesotho a fascinating place to examine all of these issues. The course will look at a wide variety of literature, history, music, and film—all produced in and made about Lesotho—in an effort to see how cultural forces help shape the world that we see around us and live in. The culture of Lesotho extends deep into South Africa as well through the history of labor migration, and even into Europe and North America. We will find ways in which the languages and cultures of southern Africa have influenced the rest of the world.\n\nSection 002 (Monberg)\n\nShifting Understandings of Literacy, Language, and Culture\n\nThis course introduces students to critical perspectives of literacy with a specific focus on underrepresented forms and legacies of literacy. We will explore how ideas about literacy have changed (or not changed) over time, how literacy has often been used to contain linguistic, cultural, and racial differences, and how community-based forms of sponsorship have sustained diverse forms of literacy. As we move through the semester, we will consider the following questions: How is literacy defined? How are these definitions used? How has literacy been assessed and for what purposes? How do forms of literacy emerge, thrive, or fade? How can robust forms of literacy be sponsored and sustained over time? How can we not only recognize diverse and emergent forms of literacy but also help them thrive in our classrooms and communities? And, finally, how might we shift our understandings of literacy so that we define, judge, and measure literacy differently in school and beyond?\n\nRCAH 345: Methods in the Humanities\n\nSection 001 (Hamilton-Wray)\n\nMethods in the Humanities: Film Studies Methods from “Black Face” to Blindspotting\n\nThe cinema emerging from a nation, community, or artist’s movement can provide a rich site for investigating dominant and contested ideologies within society. This course challenges the notion that cinema is “just entertainment” or pure escapism, and instead suggests that racial, ethnic, and other social identities are constantly being defined in cinema and that these cinematic representations have political implications. Thus, with a particular focus on the history of Black representation in two competing industries, mainstream and Black independent film, this course sets out to investigate the dynamics of the shared cultural space of U.S. cinema. Specifically, this Film Studies methods course seeks to investigate the interplay between film practices, film spectatorship, and popular culture through historical, social, political, and economic lenses. Ultimately, the course guides students through a survey of Black Film history and offers them Film Studies theoretical frameworks and research methods to make their own investigations.\n\nRCAH 346: Topics in Humanities\n\nSection 001 (Yoder)\n\nReligion without God? – Topics in Religious Naturalism\n\n“Religious naturalism” is a term that emerged in the 1980s from a wide-ranging conversation between theologians, scientists, and philosophers of religion. Though it is an umbrella term used to cover a range of positions, the intellectual terrain included in religious naturalism is roughly defined by two shared commitments. The first is a commitment to naturalism, to the premise that we should look to the natural world, rather than some supernatural realm to explain and give meaning to our experience. The second is the claim that this commitment to naturalism does not preclude religion, that there can be authentic religious responses to the world that do not depend on the existence of a supernatural realm.\n\nRCAH 492: Senior Seminar\n\nSection 001 (Thobani)\n\nCritical Literacies: Race, Gender, Representation\n\nWhether we realize it or not, we engage with various forms of representation on a daily basis. As artists, writers, scholars or activists, we also produce representations in and through our work. This capstone course is designed to build on the topics and themes you have studied during your time at RCAH in order to critically reflect on the role that representation has played in your learning, both inside and outside the university. Some questions we will consider are: how does representation shape ideas about race, gender and culture, among other aspects of identity? What role does representation play in creating ideas about belonging and non-belonging? What are the limitations of representation, and what are its transformative possibilities? By addressing these questions, our aim in this course is to develop critical literacies to help us better understand the histories behind, and the significance of, the representations that surround us.\n\nSection 002 (Sheridan)\n\nThe Role of Space in Nurturing Community, Creativity, and Learning\n\nIn designing Pixar's headquarters, Steve Jobs famously wanted to limit restrooms to a small number located in the center of the building. This would force people to congregate in a central spot multiple times during the day. And when people congregate, they talk and share ideas, fueling the creative process. This anecdote hints at the power of space to nurture two things that the RCAH values: social connections and the creative process. In fact, our own space is designed with these goals in mind. We have places like LookOut!, the LMC, Serenity, and many other communal spaces aimed at supporting creativity, community, and learning. Cities, too, have such spaces. Nearby, Old Town, Lansing, for instance, has become a creative hub. This class will use a number of lenses to explore the role of space helping us achieve things that we value. We will examine what scholars and workers have said about work spaces, educational spaces, and civic spaces. We will visit exemplary spaces around and beyond campus. Exploratory questions include: What makes a space effective? Exciting? Enchanting?The RCAH will serve as a chief example throughout the course. By this point, all of us have had many experiences in RCAH spaces. What can we learn from these experiences? How can we study the way RCAH spaces are used, modified, resisted by students, faculty, and staff? How can we transform RCAH spaces so that they more effectively support the things we value?\n\nRCAH111- Writing Transcultural Contexts\n\nSection 001 (Plough) | M W 8:00 a.m. – 9:50 a.m.Intercultural Obligations\n\nThe majority of the world is multilingual. The United States is the exception. The socio-political and economic reasons for this are critically reviewed. The consequences for society and for the individual are also examined before turning our attention to our own increasing experiences of intercultural collaboration in school and in the workplace. The challenges and opportunities of these interactions are discussed and then analyzed. For example, how do different cultures view the role of hierarchy in the decision-making process? What are the rules for direct and indirect communication? What is the protocol for conflict resolution? In the end, who is responsible for the ‘success’ of these interactions? These are among the questions we address in class discussions and in writing.\n\nSection 002 (Aronoff) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 12:10 p.m.Telling Stories: Composing Knowledges in Transcultural Contexts\n\nIn this section of RCAH 111, we will focus on the connection between culture and “storytelling,” broadly conceived. That is, we will examine the ways in which culture shapes the ways we perceive the world around us, and how we organize those perceptions into oral and written narratives – be they what we conventionally would call “stories” like personal narratives, myths or novels, or other genres like scientific, academic or philosophical writing, each with their own generic rules for the “stories” they tell. Drawing primarily on short stories and novels, we will be particularly interested in what happens when different “cultures,” or ways of knowing and writing, collide, clash or mix, in a process we will call “transculturation.” In what ways, we will ask, does “culture” provide us with narratives, patterns, genres, through which we “shape” our experience into something meaningful? In what ways do we deploy, bend, mix these “stories”? If culture might be defined as a shared system of meanings through which one interprets the world, in what ways might the classroom constitute “a culture,” and what kinds of “stories” are employed therein? In what ways are cultural “ways of knowing” embodied in (or constituted by, or complicated through) different genres of writing? What do each of these ways of knowing/writing/storytelling reveal or enable us to see, and what might they leave out? In what ways can certain kinds of writing or storytelling be seen as the mixing of, or struggle between, multiple systems of meaning or cultures? Possible course texts include Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony and/or Art Spiegelman’s Maus.\n\nSection 003 (Hunter Morgan) | M W 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.Edges & Intersections: How Writers Confront Cultural Contrast\n\nIn this course, we will explore how various writers use cultural contrasts as scaffolding for their work. We’ll think about many kinds of cultural intersections, and we’ll read work that confronts places or moments when traditional binaries (rural and urban, East and West, North and South) collide or blend. We’ll think about how writers handle racial, religious, and generational intersections, and we’ll discuss how many of these junctures are both personal and universal. We’ll examine how specific writers explore and acknowledge the complexity of “other,” and we’ll consider how the work we study might help us grow as readers, writers, and human beings. “Borders” are fascinating places, and many writers use the notion of edges – where one thing meets another – as a meaningful framework for their writing. We’ll read short fiction and essays by ZZ Packer, Joan Didion, John McPhee, Eula Biss, Barry Lopez, Cheryl Strayed, Jamaica Kincaid, and others. We’ll also watch a few short (very short) films. Your work will draw from various genres. You will combine a sense of story with factual elements to generate three creative non-fiction essays as well as a vignette.\n\nSection 004 (Paula) | M W 12:40 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.The Right to the City: Challenging Spatial Inequalities\n\nAs 21st century cities all over the globe face unprecedented transformations such as mass immigration, rapid urbanization, growing inequality, racial segregation, gentrification, and climate change, we are compelled to think about the struggles over urban resources we are confronted with on a daily basis. By focusing on issues of social justice in its various relations to the city and the urban environment, this course intends to develop contextual understandings of urban struggles in a variety of settings. While engaging with interdisciplinary perspectives, this course will focus particularly on the social, political, and cultural aspects of the “right to the city” concept. With that in mind, this course will examine a variety of urban processes from the perspective of the “right to the city” and look at successful and unsuccessful examples of attempts to create more inclusive and less socially divided cities.\n\nSection 005 (Sheridan) | M W 3:00 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.Transculturation in Michigan\n\nThis class will investigate narratives of transculturation in Michigan, including pieces set in the Lower and Upper Peninsulas, in large, small, and midsized cities, pieces located on the Great Lakes and pieces sealed within the state’s interior. We’ll “read” stories, poems, essays, paintings, videos, and songs. These readings will help launch conversations about the challenges that emerge when cultural groups come into contact. As a class, we will write about/against/in-response-to these narratives, producing a wide range of compositions, from analytical essays to multimedia projects.\n\nRCAH192-Proseminar\n\nSection 001 (Delgado, G) | M W 12:40 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.Yoga and Art: Creating Space for Creativity in Everyday Life\n\n“The arts (painting, poetry, etc.) are not just these. Eating, drinking, walking are also arts; every act is an art.” ~César Vallejo, Aphorisms (2002)\n\nBring your yoga mat and art supplies to class! In this course, we will develop creative rituals for our daily lives by infusing contemplative practices with artmaking. The contemplative practices will include yoga, meditation, and walking. We’ll use these centering tools to think deeper and great more meaning with our art. The creative skills, including poetry, bookmaking, journaling, drawing, painting, and assemblage, will allow us to expand our strategies for navigating the challenges of living and breathing the artist way of life.\n\nSection 002 (Miner) | W 12:40 p.m. – 3:30 p.m.Q:What is black and white and re(a)d all over?\n\nA: Zines, Artists’ Books, Pamphlets, Chapbooks, and Other Multiples\n\nA generation ago, everyone knew the answer to the riddle: What is black and white and re(a)d all over? At the time, you would have answered newspapers – or any other print publication – was black and white and read all over. This class takes the above outmoded riddle as a point of departure to study the history and role of do-it-yourself publishing – particularly zines, artists’ books, pamphlets, chapbooks, handbills, broadsides, posters, flyers, etc. – as well as teach students how to create limited-edition publications. In this proseminar, students will make their own zines, artists’ books, or chapbooks, as well as contribute to a collective publication with others in the class. We will read and discuss various limited-edition and short run alternative publications, as well as make our own publications using a digital duplicator – commonly known as risograph or stencil printing – located in the LMC. While risograph printing was used primarily before the advent of photocopiers, artists and designers now use this antiquated technology to publish limited-edition publications, commonly distributed at zine fests and art book fairs.\n\nRCAH202-The Presence of the Past\n\nSection 001 (Aerni-Flessner) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.Presence of the Past: Global Slavery\n\nStarting with slavery in ancient times and working toward the present, this class looks at how various forms of involuntary servitude (conveniently all lumped together under the term “slavery”) have served as underpinnings for production of goods and services. We will look at the Atlantic World, but also the Indian Ocean World, and systems on the African continent to compare involuntary servitude across time and space. We will be looking at how these systems of involuntary labor differed and were similar—and debate whether they were all “slavery.” We will also examine how they contributed in ways large and small to the creation of the globalized world in which we live. The forces that led to the rise and fall of slavery have shaped our world in a wide variety of ways, and this course will help you interrogate the ways in which this is still important, and how debates over the legacy of slavery and reparations have been and continue to be contentious.\n\nSection 003 (Hamilton-Wray) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.African Oral Traditions and the Making of History\n\nOral tradition plays a vital role in the construction and reproduction of “official histories”. However, the role of oral tradition is often not explicitly acknowledged. This course makes visible the presence and role of oral tradition in history-making, with particular focus on African diasporic oral culture found in folklore, music, proverbs, cuisine, humor, literature, and other aspects of African and African diasporic society. Our look at multiple histories, specifically oral history, imagined history, autobiographical history, and “trans-history” (history that connects the past and the future), will guide us in addressing the questions: What do these multiple histories of African peoples reveal about their struggle, resistance, and liberation? How have and can these histories be employed for positive social change? How do we understand our own official histories when we take into account oral tradition?\n\nSection 004 (Thobani) | Tu Th 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.Representing the Exotic: Sex, Gender and Culture in Colonial and Postcolonial Contexts\n\nThis course introduces students to the politics of representation and cultural production by examining how gender and sexuality have been depicted in representations of the ‘exotic’. How have such representations shaped popular imaginaries from the colonial past to the ‘postcolonial’ present? In what ways have these representations changed and/or remained consistent over time? What kinds of ideas about cultural difference are embedded in notions of the ‘exotic’? Attending to these questions, we will learn how to apply an historical approach to account for the continuities and discontinuities between past and present ideas about the ‘exotic’. Drawing on examples from visual art, literature, performance and contemporary popular culture, we explore how sex and gender have been represented in reference to different regions of the ‘Orient’. We will also study the relationship between different cultural contexts as we analyze examples of such cultural production from Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nSection 005 (Esquith) | Tu Th 7:00 p.m. – 8:50 p.m. (Honors Section)Mythic Heros of War\n\nOne way to grasp the presence of the past is through the dominant myths that we live by. What stories do we tell about the past and its development over time? How do these stories – whether they take the form of poetry, theater, film, novels, constitutions, or the everyday rituals of popular culture – structure and guide our lives? In what sense are these stories present to us? In what sense are they myths we live by?\n\nThe goal of the course is to understand how certain myths about heroism have been carried forward, what other possible worlds they may open to us, and how they empower some people while disabling others. We will focus specifically on heroes of war. We will focus initially on the Homeric heroes Achilles and Odysseus, and the main characters in Sophocles's Ajax. As we read these texts, we will also consider ways in which these stories prefigure the stories of today’s soldiers who suffer from PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and moral injury. Among the contemporary texts that students will choose from are Margaret Atwood, The Penelopiad; Roxanna Robinson, Sparta; Ellen McLaughlin, Ajax in Iraq; Paul Woodruff, The Ajax Dilemma: Justice, Fairness and Rewards (Oxford University Press, 2011); Nancy Sherman, Afterwar: Healing the Moral Wounds of our Soldiers (Oxford University Press, 2015), and David Finkel, Thank you for your service (Farrar Straus Giroux, 2013).\n\nRCAH291-Arts Workshops\n\nSection 001 (Sheridan) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 12:10 p.m.Advanced Media Production and Design\n\nThis workshop will explore the social and aesthetic potentials of video- and print-based media. Content is tailored to students who already have a background in one or more areas of media production. Students will generate creative and socially meaningful projects, exploring fundamental principles of design in the process. We will also investigate strategies for critiquing the work of others. This class will provide excellent preparation for anyone who wishes to work in the RCAH Language and Media Center.\n\nSection 002 (Scales) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.The Music of Southern Appalachia\n\nAppalachian communities have a rich and deep musical tradition that has played a unique role in the musical, political, and social life of America. In this class, students will engage with this tradition through the first hand participation in the music, performing “old-time” string band music, ballad singing, shape-note singing, and more. We will also examine the many social functions of this music in American public life, including its influence on other contemporary musical genres (bluegrass, country, folk and protest music), its connection with American leftist politics in the 20th century, and its central role in the public imagination of “authentic” American identity. Some background in music is recommended (but not required).\n\nSection 003 (Baibak) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.Painting on the Edge\n\nIf one is going to paint, why paint on a canvas? Our world holds so many forms.\n\nLet us explore them with acrylic paint. Paint is the great transformer! Its color and texture can alter the way we perceive the shape of a thing. In this class, students will examine the relationships between paint and the 3-dimensional surface. We will look at artists/designers who already paint this way while developing our own painting techniques. We’ll consider how form can communicate our ideas, create metaphors, and present as visual poetic compositions. The class will work with translucent forms and paint in reverse. We will be guided by real shadow and light relationships. We shall explore objects as topographies and mess up their varying surfaces. Let’s transform! We will question ideas about objects in our culture; why and how to create in a world where maybe we have too many things. Let’s reason “makings” value; should we create more stuff, or is it part of our evolution? These are questions that always come up for me, so maybe you’re thinking about these things too. Let’s paint on the edge without fear of falling off. No previous painting experience needed.\n\nSection 004 | Tu Th 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.Acting Fundamentals\n\nThe goal of this class is to awaken the imagination and intellect of the student actor to make them more aware of the transformative power of theatre and the role of the arts in human society. The craft of acting requires disciplined use of the body, including the voice and the mind, to uncover the meaning and vision of a play. Practice in close reading skills will prepare students to unearth the text, subtext, style and genre of dramatic texts. Regular on-your-feet workshops in various contemporary acting techniques, and practice in solo and group scene work will deepen their self-knowledge so they might represent these stories in open, honest and believable ways. Opportunities to explore performing using plays largely drawn from the 20th and 21st centuries (since 1960) will expose students to the felt history of recent human experience. By the end of the semester, students will have cultivated a greater sense of themselves, learned to listen and collaborate with others deeply, and gained new perspectives on human culture and their own potential.\n\nRCAH292A-Engagement Proseminar\n\nSection 001 (Esquith) | M 3:00 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.Peace Building\n\nThe focus of this introduction to civic engagement is peace building, that is, how we can reduce violent conflict both globally and locally through civic engagement. What can we as citizens do to mitigate violence and encourage more non-violent forms of dialogue and discussion among opposing groups? Peace building is not utopian. It does not aspire to rid the world of conflict. Its goal is to lessen the levels of violence in the context of continuing conflicts, disagreements, and compromises.\n\nOne of the earliest modern peace builders in the US was Myles Horton. Horton began as a union organizer in the mountains of Appalachia and that led him to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and ‘60s. His autobiography, The Long Haul, is still relevant to us today as we struggle to build peace in a world plagued with violent conflicts at home and abroad. After acquainting ourselves with Horton’s story, we will consider a more conceptual approach to peace building, Transformative Change: An Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies.\n\nWe will apply these insights to an ongoing peace building project, the World Peace Game, which RCAH students have created in collaboration with high school students through the Lansing Refugee Development Center (RDC). We will meet once per week at our regular class time (Mondays, 3-4:50 PM) and then an additional 2 hours (probably Mondays 6-8 PM) with these young refugee students to play and discuss the World Peace Game.\n\nTo understand the Peace Game and how it has been incorporated into the RCAH civic engagement curriculum earlier, see this article by RCAH alumna Kelsey Block)\n\nSection 002 (Brooks) | Th 3:00 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.Holistic Citizenship: Living and Working in Engaged Communities\n\nThis proseminar is an introduction to civic engagement and explores the concepts of identity, consciousness, community, culture, citizenship, and reflection using an interdisciplinary approach. Employing theories and methodologies from the arts and humanities, as well as incorporating methods from the social and natural sciences, students will read and discuss an assortment of written and visual texts (artwork, writings, film, etc.) to facilitate learning and to enhance critical thinking. In addition, students will complete experiential learning exercises that build relationships with civic organizations and work toward improving personal and community health/wellness. More specifically, this course will assist students with developing an understanding of the various types of civic engagement activities in relation to the RCAH model on civic engagement (insight, practice, action, passion). Students will be challenged to evaluate notions of vulnerability, empathy, and belongingness. Then, students will be asked to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate existing and new ways of performing civic engagement that improves individuals, families, communities, and humanity.\n\nRCAH292B-Engagement and Reflection\n\nSection 001 (Delgado, G) | T 12:40 p.m. – 4:30 p.m.The Prison Poetry ‘Zine Project\n\nIn this civic engagement course, we will practice and use the arts to infuse positive social change in our prison system and beyond. Through weekly visits to prisons, we will work side-by-side with incarcerated people, including children, to create poetry ‘zines and facilitate and perform slam poetry. We will investigate and reflect on why the arts matter in prison—its impact on rehabilitation and communities inside and outside the prison walls. The works of poets who wrote while in prison, including Etheridge Knight, Jimmy Baca Santiago, Marilyn Buck, and Reginald Dwayne Betts, will be introduced and discussed.\n\nSection 002 (Torrez) | Tu Th 3:00 p.m. - 4:50 p.m.Educacíon, comunidad, y familia\n\nThrough investigating with various research models, local history, and exploring community-based models, this course will bring together the experiences of students from Michigan State University (MSU) and Lansing School District (LSD). Collaboratively we will work alongside Latinx youth in shaping Lansing School District's understanding of the Latinx community. Working with 9th-12th-grade students in Lansing high schools, we will discover the power of telling stories by way of seeing local Latino history through the eyes of Latino youth. Engaging with high school students, we will work alongside our high school partners to learn the importance of their own story and their impact on their local community.\n\nRCAH292C-Independent Engagement\n\nSection 001 (Arranged)Independent Engagement\n\n292C courses are unique, independent engagements of variable credit negotiated between students, community partners, and RCAH faculty. They assume that the student and the community have established a relationship of mutual respect, trust, and benefit. They also assume a high level of passion and experience. These courses focus heavily on the action and insight areas of the RCAH Civic Engagement model. Students select and work with a specific faculty of record and community partner to develop and implement the syllabus and the engagement program for the course.\n\nRCAH320-Art and Public Life\n\nSection 001 (Hamilton-Wray) | M W 10:20a.m. – 11:40 a.m.Third Cinema and Film for Social Change\n\nThis course explores the global film movement, Third Cinema, a radical approach to filmmaking that challenges injustice and oppression, and encourages an active relationship between the filmmakers and their audiences. This course looks at the roots of Third Cinema, as well as how particular political landscapes shape the many ways that Third Cinema has developed and is expressed. With a background in Third World film history and Third Cinema film theory, students will investigate specific national cinemas and the different ways that politics, culture, and cinematic expression converge in Third Cinema globally? Additionally, they’ll explore specific challenges Third Cinema filmmakers face in funding, creating, distributing, and exhibiting their work? And finally, students will look at the possibilities film for positive social change and the practice of Third Cinema in a local context?\n\nRCAH330-Nature and Culture\n\nSection 001 (Skeen) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. – 11:40 a.m.Appalachian Literature and Culture\n\nThe primary goal of this course is to explore the history of the Appalachian region through looking at documentary and popular film, scholarly and personal essays, and the work of poets and fiction writers from Appalachia. As West Virginia is the only state completely in the Appalachian region, we will focus our study on the literature and culture of that state and learn how it is both representative of and different from other areas of Appalachia. We will work to comprehend the richness of this region, past and present, and explore the themes of regional folklore and music, fine art and local craft, the power of religious and family tradition, and isolation and community. For students who would like to spend a little time in Appalachia (for an additional cost of approximately $300) the course will include a four-day excursion to West Virginia near the end of September for a weekend of regional history and culture.\n\nSection 002 (Aerni-Flessner) | Tu Th 1:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.Nature and Culture: Disease and the Making of Public Health in Africa\n\nHow do societies define a “disease?” When is a disease a threat to a government, or to individuals, and when is it an individual matter? This course will explore issues in endemic and epidemic diseases, focusing largely on the African continent. We will look at how and when governments decide to provide medical services to people within their borders. Using Africa will allow us to explore the dynamics of public health within the realm of colonialism as well as in post-independence governments that are supposed to represent the will and desire of the people. Do they? For whom are health programs designed, and in the 21st century what role do international organizations, from faith-based charities to multi-national corporations and foundations play in the provision of health facilities and care? The class will ask students to explore issues related to ethics and morality as well as health.\n\nRCAH380-Third Year Tutorial\n\nSection 001 (Thobani) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:20 p.m.Performing India: Arts, Culture and Nation Formation\n\nThis course examines the role of ‘arts and culture’ in producing ideas about Indian national identity. Some of the questions we will address in class include: What are the convergences and divergences between colonial ideas about India, anti-colonial nationalist constructs of cultural heritage, and contemporary representations of a globalizing Indian nation? What makes artistic and cultural production such a powerful medium for the construction and dissemination of these ideas? What does it mean to practice and consume ‘arts’ that are historically rooted in the colonial encounter in the present moment? This course will be of interest to students of South Asian studies, as well as students interested in postcolonial studies, cultural studies, and studies of nation formation more broadly.\n\nSection 002 (Monberg) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.Community Literacy, Civic Engagement, Collaboration\n\nWhat is do we mean by the term, “community literacy”? What programs support the literacies of community members? How do programs collaborate with schools, colleges, and universities? When is a sustainable model appropriate and when is a more tactical approach necessary and why? In this tutorial, students will explore these questions by looking at research on community literacy and the kinds of programs that foster community literacy and civic engagement through innovative models of collaboration. There will be a particular focus on programs that work with Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) communities, communities of color, and other historically underrepresented communities. We will begin with some common readings. Students will then survey/research several models of community literacy collaborations. Finally, students will define their own individual projects, which may include proposing, creating, or expanding a community literacy project; developing a curriculum to foster community literacies; or researching the collaborative process of creating sustainable programs. The goal of the class is to further develop students’ research capacities (broadly defined) and to guide them through the process of designing and carrying out a research-informed project.\n\nSection 003 (Yoder) | Tu Th 2:40 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.Religion without God? – Topics in Religious Naturalism\n\n“Religious naturalism” is a term that emerged in the 1980s from a wide ranging conversation between theologians, scientists, and philosophers of religion. Though it is an umbrella term used to cover a range of positions, the intellectual terrain included in religious naturalism is roughly defined by two shared commitments. The first is a commitment to naturalism, to the premise that we should look to the natural world, rather than some supernatural realm to explain and give meaning to our experience. The second is the claim that this commitment to naturalism does not preclude religion, that there can be authentic religious responses to the world that do not depend on the existence of a supernatural realm.\n\nRCAH390-Language and Culture\n\nSection 001 (Bosse) | M 6:00 p.m. – 8:50 p.m.Music, Language and Meaning\n\nIt is often said that music is a universal language. While untrue, we collectively cling to this notion for reasons that reveal something important about human communication; for music and language are among the semiotic skills and behaviors that most uniquely define us as humans. While music and language may be useful in different ways, both involve the conversion of complex auditory sequences into meaningful units and structures (and vice versa) in a real-time, moment-to-moment, rapid-fire fashion.\n\nScholars through the ages have explored the connections between music and language, and music as language, from Plato to Charles Darwin to Leonard Bernstein. Participants in this course will add our voices to the conversation; engaging disciplines ranging from cultural criticism and cultural anthropology; musicology and music theory; semiotics, linguistics and communication studies; cognition, psychology and neuroscience.\n\nSection 002 (Torrez) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. – 11:40 a.m.Am I My Language?\n\nLanguage is more than a tool of communication and its cultural significance moves beyond a channel through which information is transmitted. In fact, language is used as a channel for tradition, knowledge, survival skills, healing, and resistance. In the above statement Joshua Fishman intimates how in certain circumstances, language is used as a weapon for colonization, subjugation, and assimilation. Therefore, it is not surprising that amidst an era of globalization, the language of commerce is rampantly replacing dozens of Indigenous and heritage languages. In response to global unilingualism, communities devote efforts to maintain heritage languages, while demanding their linguistic rights. Additionally, these communities perform counter-hegemonic actions to prevent the dissolving of their sociocultural and linguistic practices.\n\nIn addition to the commonly studied categories of race, gender, and class, this section will investigate how language is inextricably linked to identity formation and the implications of a global society. This course will delve into the discussion of language attrition and revitalization, in addition to how these processes affect identity construction (both individually and as a community). Through meaningful dialogue, we will discuss the importance of language on our own identities and the implications of language loss on the identities of our respective communities. We will focus on the manifestations of these issues from a global perspective.\n\nRCAH492-Senior Seminar\n\nSection 001 (Aronoff) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.What’s Culture? Whose Culture? Where’s Culture?\n\nA key term in academic and popular discourse – including in the RCAH curriculum – is “culture.” But behind this deceptively simple word is a long, tangled and complex history, the study of which leads one immediately into histories of exploration, imperialism, race, class, science and the arts. This class will examine key texts in the history of the idea of culture in the West – ranging from works of literature, science, anthropology, philosophy and aesthetics – with particular attention to the emergence of anthropology in the modernist period, and the many permutations and problems with culture in contemporary discourses of multiculturalism, transnationalism and the global circulation of “culture(s).” Along the way we will ask questions like: What is “culture”? What does it mean to “have” (a) culture? To be “cultured”? How do ideas of culture intersect with ideas of ethnicity, race, nationality and personal identity? Who owns (a) culture? How do particular cultures “own” you? What is the relationship between “culture” and individual creativity? Culture and change? Transculturation and cultural appropriation? How is culture embodied/represented in particular institutions and media (museums? MTV? The internet?) What kinds of ideas of culture are embodied in the idea of the liberal arts curriculum (and RCAH curriculum)? What is the “culture” of the RCAH? How was that culture created?\n\nSpring 2019 Courses\n\nRCAH112-Writing Research Technologies\n\nSection 001 (Aronoff) | M W 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.\n\nOur America: Cultures of American Modernism, 1919-1930\n\nThe focus of this section of RCAH 112 is the idea of “American culture” as it is renegotiated and reimagined in the United States in the 1920s and 30s. More accurately, we might say we are investigating shifts in “American” “culture,” since, we will discover, both of these terms – what it means to be an “American” and what it means to “have culture” – undergo crucial and complex shifts in this period. This section, then, will examine debates over “American” culture, race, national identity and art in the modernist period. Looking at various primary documents, with particular attention to the arts (modernist poetry, literature, jazz and other media), we will ask: how do these texts imagine the relationship between “race,” “nation,” and “culture”? How do these constructions engage debates over immigration, assimilation and pluralism? What is the relationship between racial and /or cultural identity and political identity (or citizenship)? What is the relationship between “culture,” art, and new modes technologies? Is industrialism and its methods the end of “culture” as “high art,” or the beginning of a new kind of “culture”? How did new forms of artistic expression (broadly speaking, “modernist” art) respond to, challenge, or incorporate these new social conditions? We will then think about how these modernist debates reverberate in contemporary, 21st Century contexts, in questions of transnational migration, national identity, cultural “ownership” and authenticity, etc. The breadth of these questions will allow for a wide variety of approaches and specific interest: like all sections of 112, we will be able to pursue the burning questions we raise by developing our skills as researchers and writers.\n\nSection 002 (Yoder) | M W 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.\n\nResearching and Writing about Ethical Issues\n\nWhile questions in bioethics are often considered to be very personal, they are also at the heart of many public controversies. In this course we will use both public and scholarly reflection on bioethical issues to deepen our understanding of the practice of research and writing in the humanities. We will use this material in order to increase our understanding of 1) what it means to do research in the humanities, 2) how to use writing as a means of inquiry, 3) how to evaluate and construct arguments, and 4) how to conduct and present a research project in the humanities. Each student will produce a thesis-driven research paper on a relevant topic of their choice, a project utilizing an alternative format for presenting the results of their research, and a writing portfolio documenting both these final products and the processes used to produce them.\n\nSection 003 (Paula) | M W 12:40 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.\n\nCommunity Activist and Social Movements\n\nA Transnational Perspective Social movements have long been considered a driving force behind political, social, and cultural change. Focusing on the cultural contexts of collective action, this course will explore theoretical perspectives and look at local, national, and global examples of social movements activism. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the tactics and organizing strategies used by social movements and examine the various reactive and repressive responses to social activism. In addition, we will study how social movements have changed in the last century and explore the role of allies and adversaries in supporting and/or damaging community engagement.\n\nThe course is intended to prepare students to conduct academic research and requires students to produce critical research papers or projects (topic of their choice) that consider how social movements come about, and what allows them or constrains them in effecting social change.\n\nSection 004 (Sheridan) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nThe Production of Culture\n\nThis class focuses on the ways that the analytical and creative work of the arts and humanities can help to solve real-world problems. The premises of this course are: (1) that forms of cultural expression (such as stories, videos, performances, music, etc.) can be powerful tools of social change; and (2) that all of us are potentially producers of these forms. Accordingly, students will begin by identifying a cultural problem — something they would like to see changed in the world. They will analyze the way the problem is embodied in popular culture (e.g., movies, music, websites). Finally, they will devise their own \"cultural interventions\": movies, music, websites, and other compositions aimed at addressing the cultural problem in question.\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH192-Proseminar\n\nSection 001 (Skeen) | M W 8:30 a.m. – 9:50 a.m.\n\nPoetry: News that Stays News\n\n“The most famous statements about poetry and journalism hide an equation inside an opposition: “It is difficult/ to get the news from poems/ yet men die miserably every day/ for lack// of what is found there” (William Carlos Williams). Or else they hide an opposition inside an equation: “Poetry is news that stays news” (Ezra Pound).” --Stephen Burt.\n\nEvery day we find ourselves bombarded with “the news”: breaking news, fake news, old news, cable news, to name just a few. If poetry really is “news that stays news,” who are the poets who have reported that news and helped us to survive by reading it? In this course we will look to the U.S. Poets Laureate, a position that was created by Congress in 1937, over 80 years ago, and examine what those poets have said to us. Who or what is a poet laureate? Who chooses the poets, and what do they do? We’ll place these writers in an historical and literary context, as well as look at the often uneasy position they found themselves in between politics and art, as many of us do today. And what about the state and city poets laureate? Which states appoint them and which don’t? Who are they? What do they do? We’ll do reading, research, and writing, both scholarly and creative.\n\nSection 002 (Torrez) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 11:40 p.m.\n\nIt’s a Small World, After All\n\nWalt Disney once said, “I think of a child’s mind as a blank book. During the first years of his life, much will be written on pages. The quality of that writing will affect his life profoundly.” Using this philosophy, Disney erected a multibillion-dollar corporation Imagineering future generations ideals, roles, and beliefs. For some, Disney became a symbol of imagination, fantasy, and peace; while others came to see Disney as the hands molding children into conventional American values not mirroring their own principles. Yet others saw Disney as a pervasive entity neatly packaging childhood into Eurocentric ideals, represented through character-based products ranging from cookies to beauty products to clothing to McDonald Happy Meal toys.\n\nIn this course, we will collaboratively investigate and compare stories in their original form to those (re)told in contemporary times. Traditionally stories began as a way to pass along customs, histories, and morals, they also worked as devices to instill certain societal principles. In this way, cultures throughout the world have used storytelling as a means to inform younger generations of how they become “community members,” how the elements are created, or even motivations for migration. A few questions guiding this course are: What is lost in the (re)telling of these stories? Can the communities that depend on these stories to pass along cultural knowledge reappropriate those stories once they are Disneyified? Are Disney films “innocent” entertainment or are they something else? Is Disney a reflection of society or society a reflection of Disney?\n\nSection 003 (Aerni-Flessner) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. - 11:40 a.m.\n\nProseminar: Urban Renewal in Lansing\n\nThis course is an introduction for students to ideas of renewal and change, development and progress. These terms all seemingly have positive connotations, but they have also in American history concealed violence and histories of community dispossession. Most of the “urban renewal” projects of the 1960s, including freeway construction and the creation of housing projects, involved cutting swaths through African-American and other poor/marginalized communities. This was true for the Lansing area, and its Interstate 496 project.\n\nThis class will look at some of those histories to better understand how discourses of progress and social programs purporting to serve poor populations have been used to displace as well. We will also be working with digital humanities professionals from across campus and a collection of photographs that the Historical Society of Greater Lansing has to create a digital recreation of the African-American neighborhood that was razed to create Lansing’s modern transportation network. The project will focus on what was there, what is there today, and how various groups and individuals understood the changes taking place.\n\nRCAH203-Transcultural Relations\n\nSection 001 (Plough) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.\n\nThe Globalization of Yoga\n\nAfter an overview of the origins and major schools of yoga, the course focuses on the introduction and spread of the practice and philosophy outside of India. We will explore possible reasons for and the effects of the worldwide adoption of yoga on the practice itself, taking into consideration the commercialization (e.g., clothing, retreats, publications) of the tradition as well as its integration into western medicine (e.g., pain management, stress relief, improved mobility). Among the questions we will address are: What commonalities exist between ‘modern’ and ‘classical’ yoga? How has yoga changed since its introduction to populations outside of India? How does the ‘same’ yoga differ based on where it is practiced? Is there an ‘authentic’ or ‘pure’ yoga?\n\nSection 002 (Aerni-Flessner) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.\n\nTranscultural Relations: African Popular Culture and Independence in the 20th Century\n\nThis course examines histories of popular culture—things like music, the arts, and sport, etc.—to think about how people built community. With the rise and fall of colonialism, people across Africa had to work to build new communities around shared ideas of country and culture.\n\nThis class looks at a number of case studies to try to figure out how popular culture was used (and abused) by leaders and common people alike in their quest to build new nations out of the damage caused by colonialism. We will look at apartheid South Africa, and how protests that erupted globally helped change perceptions about the country. We will look at and listen to popular music from Angola and Zimbabwe to try to better understand how people survived wars against European colonial powers, and how they used music and other forms of culture as part of the battle.\n\nHow is citizenship constructed and what does it mean for a country to be “independent?” Looking at Africa, we will ask questions that are relevant to contexts the world over.\n\nSection 003 (Thobani) | Tu Th 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nMigration and Diaspora Through the Arts\n\nIn this course, we will study the relationships among and between ‘homelands’, ‘diasporas’ and ‘host nations’ by focusing on art and cultural production. In what ways do ‘cultures’ shift and change as diasporic communities migrate and settle in their new locations? How are the cultures of the homeland, diaspora, and host nation reproduced over time? How does the relationship between these three sites affect diasporic cultural production, and how is it shaped by such production in turn? In what ways do diasporic communities and actors address issues of race, class and gender through cultural production? What can the study of diasporic art reveal about identity formation in the context of migration? Taking examples from music, dance, cinema, fashion, literature and the visual arts, we will explore the many ways in which diasporic identity is produced and expressed in different locations. We will also interrogate questions of cultural belonging, nostalgia, ‘authenticity’, and essentialism. Rather than limit the focus to one particular diasporic community, our aim in this course is to study the connections that exist between and across different cultural groups in the transnational present.\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH291-Arts Workshop\n\nSection 001 (Delgado, G.) | M 12:40 p.m. – 4:30 p.m.\n\nThe Prison Poetry ‘Zine Project\n\nIn this arts workshop course, we will practice and use the arts, including poetry and creative writing, to infuse positive social change in our prison system and beyond. Through weekly visits to prisons, we will work side-by-side with incarcerated people, including children, to create poetry ‘zines and facilitate and perform slam poetry. We will investigate and reflect on why the arts matter in prison—its impact on rehabilitation and communities inside and outside the prison walls. The works of poets who wrote while in prison, including Etheridge Knight, Jimmy Baca Santiago, Marilyn Buck, and Reginald Dwayne Betts, will be introduced and discussed.\n\nSection 002 (Bosse and Scales) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. – 12:10 p.m.\n\nCreative Workshop: Songwriting and Music Production\n\nThis class involves the creation and recording of popular music, from the initial stages of songwriting through to the recording of those songs. Students will explore the challenges of the creative process, develop their musicianship skills, and become proficient in digital recording technologies, including various kinds of microphones, microphone placements, and some of the basic principles of acoustics. Part of this process will also include analyzing songs we love and those we love to hate. Students should have the minimum ability to perform in some fashion the music they currently enjoy to listen to and create.\n\nSection 003 (Miner) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.\n\nPrinting Politics: Posters, Broadsides, and Radical Ephemera\n\nAs aesthetic and political objects, the poster has a long tradition, particularly in relation to activist, revolutionary, and public art. For the Atelier Populaire, a French collective working during the May ’68 uprising, posters functioned as ‘weapons in the service of the struggle,’ as well as an inseparable part of that same struggle. Much like their peers in Cuba a decade earlier or in Mexico three decades prior, the Atelier Populaire is central to ‘popular printmaking’ practices in which artists and activists use hand-printed posters to challenge dominant institutions. Today, with the advent of digital printing and the prominence of capitalism as the dominant economic system, the poster has become synonymous with slick corporate marketing, particularly linked to Hollywood cinema. Outside the constraints of corporate design, popular printmaking – such as screenprinting – confronts and contests the frequency of digital technologies and the corporate control of visual spaces.\n\nIn this class, students will learn basic 1. relief printing, 2. screenprinting, and 3. risography as techniques available to them as they work on their projects in this class.\n\nSection 004 (Newman) | Tu Th 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nDance as Human Experience\n\nWhy do humans have an innate impulse to move, to dance? Through observation and exploration, students begin with a personal journey, from noticing ordinary movement to recognizing the extraordinary choices and possibilities that dance offers. Relationships to the broader context of history, culture, communication, social issues, and aesthetics are realized over the arc of experience. Students in this class can expect to move, to discover, to create, to write. They will learn to recognize dance/movement as an everyday tool by which humans experience and interpret life. No previous dance experience necessary.\n\nRCAH292A-Engagement Proseminar\n\nSection 001 (Brooks) | Tu 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nHolistic Citizenship: Living and Working in Engaged Communities\n\nThis proseminar is an introduction to civic engagement and explores the concepts of identity, consciousness, community, culture, citizenship, and reflection using an interdisciplinary approach. Employing theories and methodologies from the arts and humanities, as well as incorporating methods from the social and natural sciences, students will read and discuss an assortment of written and visual texts (artwork, writings, film, etc.) to facilitate learning and to enhance critical thinking. In addition, students will complete experiential learning exercises that build relationships with civic organizations and work toward improving personal and community health/wellness. More specifically, this course will assist students with developing an understanding of the various types of civic engagement activities in relation to the RCAH model on civic engagement (insight, practice, action, passion). Students will be challenged to evaluate notions of vulnerability, empathy, and belongingness. Then, students will be asked to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate existing and new ways of performing civic engagement that improves individuals, families, communities, and humanity.\n\nSection 002 (Monberg) | Th 4:10 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.\n\nStories that Sustain Community\n\nThis proseminar prepares students for civic engagement in RCAH and beyond by exploring the difference between serving and sustaining community. The United States, in particular, has a “distinct culture” of nonprofit and community-based organizations that depend on volunteerism (Stewart and Casey 2013). While volunteerism has its place in community-based work, it often privileges a short-term commitment and a short-term understanding of communities. Taking a long-term view of community, students in this course will first explore different models of civic engagement and how those models inform and impact community collaborations. We will then explore civic engagement programs that use spoken word and digital storytelling to foster community among refugee youth and communities. Finally, in the later part of the semester, students will collaborate with a youth program at Lansing’s Refugee Development Center (RDC) on a spoken word or digital storytelling project.\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH292B-Engagement and Reflection\n\nSection 001 (Whitney) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 12:10 p.m.\n\nNonprofit Arts and Innovation: Community Engagement through Experiential Learning\n\nDesigned to provide authentic field experiences in conjunction with academic study, this course has a primary focus on non-profit arts management with an introduction to social entrepreneurism. Civic engagement experiences will offer individual students a behind-the-scenes perspective at the site of community arts agencies and an opportunity to gain knowledge, skills, and connections with community partners. Class sessions will feature several expert guest speakers and examine aspects of nonprofit arts organizations, such as: vision, leadership, innovation, and the discipline within day-to-day operations integral to making a mission a reality.\n\nSection 002 (Brooks) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nHealth and Wellness in Our Communities\n\nThis course on engagement and reflection assists students with developing a deeper understanding of civic engagement and cultivates a fervent commitment to improving personal and community health and wellness. Students will be introduced to issues and challenges affecting the health and well-being of our communities. Using an interdisciplinary approach from the arts, humanities, and social sciences, this course explores the historical, physiological, psychological, spiritual, social, environmental, and occupational forces influencing our health behaviors and lifestyle choices. Topics explored consist of historical and cultural perspectives on health/wellness, psycho-social challenges to healthy living, environmental concerns, chronic diseases, alternative interventions and resources, and health policy studies. The goals of this course are to improve health literacy, draw attention to health disparities, and encourage greater participation in physical activity.\n\nSection 003 (Baibak) | W 12:40 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.\n\nInside the Peckham Art Studio\n\nIn this civic engagement course we will work with RCAH’s partners at Peckham Inc., inside the Peckham Art Studio. Peckham provides people with physical, cognitive, behavioral and socio-economic challenges, a platform to demonstrate their ability, learn new skills, participate in work and enjoy the rewards of their success. We’ll use this unique experience to explore what is “Civic Engagement”. By working alongside Peckham artists, in their studio, making art, and sharing stories, we will be fueled to reflect on how interpersonal interactions expand our own understanding of the world we live in. The class will learn “People First Language”, be exposed to social design, and engage as amateur social anthropologist practicing participatory observation. Students will assess the time we spend with our partners through creative writing and art processes.\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH292C-Independent Engagement\n\nSection 001 (Arranged)\n\nIndependent Engagement\n\n292C courses are unique, independent engagements of variable credit negotiated between students, community partners, and RCAH faculty. They assume that the student and the community have established a relationship of mutual respect, trust, and benefit. They also assume a high level of passion and experience. These courses focus heavily on the action and insight areas of the RCAH Civic Engagement model. Students select and work with a specific faculty of record and community partner to develop and implement the syllabus and the engagement program for the course.\n\nRCAH304-LGBTQ Studies\n\nSection 001 (Schwartz) | M W 4:10 p.m. – 5:30 p.m. (cross listed with WS/LBC)\n\nFrom Perversion to Marriage: Media and the LGBTQ Community\n\nThe rise of the LGBTQ community equality movement is one formed and informed by the media, ranging from the early 20th century reports of same-gender loving persons as perverts, the red scare and the free love movement to the Stonewall Rebellion and the struggle for marriage equality. The rise of HIV and its death toll in the LGBTQ communities provided a focused reality for the struggle for equality and caused newsrooms to confront their biases, both in their news coverage and employment practices. The epidemic also served as a pivot point shifting the media focus from the acts of sex to the identity of sexuality and the humanity of the people impacted. Gay press led the way, but it's an untold story that will be revealed through this course led by a journalist with 50 years’ experience on the front lines.\n\nRCAH310-Childhood and Society\n\nSection 001 (Torrez) | M W 12:40 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.\n\nCritical Pedagogy\n\nTeaching is a political act and the classroom is a potential revolutionary space. These words, pronounced by Brazilian educational theorist Paulo Freire, are often used globally to situate teaching within notions of activism. In a time when education is confused with schooling, and learning is solely gauged by “standardized” assessments, we must critically interrogate our roles as teachers and as learners.\n\nThis course is founded on democratic education, presupposing that everyone actively participates in the generation, transformation, and production of knowledge. In this way, everyone must engage in the process of transformative learning, facilitating active participation in a process “that by rethinking our past, we can fundamentally gain an understanding of the formation of our self, the roots of our present condition, and the limits as well as the possibilities of our being a self-in-the-world” (Torres, 2007). In this course we will engage in questions such as: How do current students, overwhelmed with a turbulent political climate, critically engage in/with their learning process? Why should we bother to engage? What are the responsibilities of educators and learners in democratic education and how can we assume those responsibilities?\n\nRCAH340-Technology and Creativity\n\nSection 001 (Aronoff)| M W 3:00 p.m. - 4:20 p.m.\n\nFictions of Science and Technology\n\nThis course will examine the interplay between scientific philosophies, technology and literature. We will explore this interplay in terms of both content and form: in other words, we will study the ways in which the “subject matter” of science and technology – the theories, discoveries, inventions of science – are explored within novels and short stories to probe their implications for our conceptions of society, the self, and art; we will also think about how scientific “ways of knowing” – rationality, empiricism, linear narrative – have been deployed and resisted to shape the genres of the realist novel, detective fiction, gothic tales and science fiction. Finally, we will also think about how the technology of the book itself shapes the kinds of narratives that can be produced, and how new technologies – the internet, hypertext, etc. – might produce new kinds of narratives.\n\nRCAH380-Third Year Tutorial\n\nSection 001 (Paula) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 11:40 a.m.\n\nInsurgent Citizenship: New Urban Social Movements\n\nThis course will consider the ways in which groups of ‘insurgent citizens’ subvert old paradigms of political participation and take on novel forms of action to address various aspects of the urban experience. We will look at transnational and transcultural insurgent modes of claiming spaces and rights through urban social movements that reconfigure conventional understandings of what it means to be a citizen. We will explore how interventions such as squatter occupations in Barcelona, mega informal markets in Buenos Aires, widespread tagging in São Paulo, Chicana and feminist biking collectives in Los Angeles and first peoples-led rights of nature movement effectively engage in meaningful practices of citizenship including its social, economic, political, and cultural dimensions. From an interdisciplinary approach, we will address some of the ways in which urban social movements advance their class, race, gender, and environmental agendas via practices of insurgent citizenship.\n\nSection 002 (Hunter Morgan) | Tu Th 12:40 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.\n\nOnce Upon a Time: The Potency of Fairy Tales and the Magic of Book Arts\n\n“The incarnate mind, the tongue, and the tale are in our world coeval.” – J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nWhy do we love fairy tales? They enchant, yes. But they do more than that as well. Hans Christian Anderson translator Erik Christian Haugaard said, “I know of no fairy tale which upholds the tyrant, or takes the part of the strong against the weak. A fascist fairy tale is an absurdity.” Angela Carter called the spirit of the fairy tale “heroic optimism.” Tolkien claimed, “It was in fairy-stories that I first divined the potency of words, and the wonder of the thing, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass, house and fire; bread and wine.” That these tales are full of loss, jealousy, and suffering in addition to stones, wood, and iron, make them real to us. That they generally end with what Tolkien described as sudden and miraculous grace is an assertion of the triumph of desire over dread. During this course, we will divine the potency of these tales, and we will discover the beauty of the book itself.\n\nThis interdisciplinary course will combine fundamentals of literature, creative writing, and traditional book arts. We will think about what makes a fairy tale a fairy tale, and why we need, as Tolkien said, “to hold communion with other living things.” In addition to reading traditional tales, we’ll read contemporary or near contemporary re-tellings of old tales, and we’ll consider the role of fairy tales in film and poetry. Students will generate their own work (a connected series of poems or a list essay) and will learn how to make their own books to contain this work.\n\nRCAH390-Language and Culture\n\nSection 001 (Thobani) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:20 p.m.\n\nTranslating Culture: Understanding Performance and Otherness in Cross-Cultural Contexts\n\nIf, as scholars of performance studies suggest, artistic production and performance provide ways to communicate one’s cultural identity, what happens when these performances occur cross-culturally? That is, are performances such as those of music and dance universal in their ability to communicate, even when they originate in cultures marked as ‘different’? Can performance, as embodied practice, communicate that which is beyond language, or is it inseparable from language as a form of communication? What is the relationship between such performances and the ways in which entire cultures are defined and understood, especially in a context where ‘world’ music and dance draw such large followings? Taking these questions as our starting point, we will interrogate the relationship between communication and performance in relation to ‘Otherness’ by paying close attention to the politics of translation, interpretation, coded signification, and representation.\n\nSection 002 (Plough) | Tu Th 8:00 a.m. – 9:20 a.m.\n\nMethods of Sociolinguistic Research\n\nMethods of Sociolinguistic Research is a general survey course of sociolinguistics and sociolinguistic research methodologies. Combining lecture, seminar, and fieldwork, the course introduces students to generating original data through ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, and written questionnaires. Quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. Readings include sociolinguistic studies on different world languages. Throughout the course, the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are critically examined with attention to the relationship between sociolinguistic phenomena and the selection of a particular research methodology. Specific topics include language variation, language attitudes, and identities.\n\nSection 003 (Banzhaf) | Tu Th 10:20 a.m. – 11:40 a.m.\n\nThe Origin of Language(s) and Culture(s)\n\nWe will explore the origin, evolution, and characteristics of language(s) and culture(s) from a general linguistic and anthropological perspective with the help of other disciplines. Questions we will ponder are: What is a language? Why did the capacity for language evolve in the first place? What are the forces that govern language change? Do languages flavor how we think about the world around us? What can the study of human migration tell us about the evolution of language families? What differentiates evolved languages from constructed languages, like Esperanto, Elvish, or Klingon? What are the specifics of languages like sign-, whistling-, clicking-, and body language? Some languages are tonal, some aren’t. Some have scripts, some don’t. What kinds of script are there? What are possible reasons and their cultural consequences? To examine this jungle of questions in depth, we will apply a modified framework borrowed from animal behavior studies. In addition to these questions, the course will be driven by interests that students bring to the course. We will also welcome several visitors as representatives of different languages. As a final project, our class will create a digital map of possible language evolution paths.\n\nRCAH391-Independent Study\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH395-Special Topics in the Arts & Humanities\n\nSection 750 (Delgado,V) | (Arranged)\n\nProgram on Sustainability in Costa Rica\n\nMore information at:\n\nhttp://rcah.msu.edu/programs/education-away/costa-rica.html\n\nRCAH492-Senior Seminar\n\nSection 001 (Scales) | M W 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.\n\nWho Owns Culture?: Cultural Property and Creativity in the Twenty-First Century\n\nIn this course we will examine the legal, ethical, and cultural stakes related to current international conversations about intellectual property and cultural property and how these conversations will effect what Lawrence Lessig has called the “nature and future of creativity.” In studying these issues we will ask such basic questions as: What is the relationship between shared cultural knowledge and individual creativity? Is it possible (or desirable) for a social group to “own” and “control” their cultural practices. Is there an inherent value for society in a “cultural commons,” and if so, how do we balance the ownership “rights” of individuals with those of larger communities? These conversations are vital and immediate for RCAH students who are planning careers within the North American “creative economy.” As such, the most important outcome of this course will be the development of some very real and tangible possible policy recommendations, research papers, or creative works that confront these issues in meaningful and socially helpful ways.\n\nSection 002 (Esquith) | M W 3:00 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.\n\nWhen Words Lose Their Meaning\n\nThucydides described the civil war in Corcyra in 427 BCE in his History of Peloponnesian Wars this way:\n\n“Irrational boldness was considered as manly loyalty to one’s partisans; prudent delay as specious cowardice, moderation as a disguise for unmanliness, and a well-rounded intelligence as a disqualification for action.” (3.82.4)\n\nToday, for some in the U.S., manliness is a coveted license to harass and assault women, others cling to it as a symbol of benign patriarchal responsibility, and still others reject it as a sexist anachronism. For some, “Make America Great Again” means generating greater economic power, while for others it is a thinly veiled threat to block refugees and purge the nation of its racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nIn this seminar, first we’ll ask how we got into this fix. How has political language been degraded into a series of impulsive tweets? How has power outgrown even the imperfect democratic institutions and norms that once held it somewhat in check? How have we learned to idolize superpower and demonize the other? To paraphrase Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film Dr. Strangelove, how have we learned to stop worrying and love the bomb?\n\nSecond, what new forms of radical participation are afforded by social media, and what new dangers do these technologies create? To answer this question, we’ll consider some of the more promising moments in which democratic participation occurred, including recent protest movements in the U.S. and other parts of the world.\n\nAmong the authors we’ll be reading are Sheldon S. Wolin, Zeynep Tufekci, and David Graeber.\n\nFall 2017 Courses\n\nRCAH111- Writing Transcultural Contexts\n\nSection 001 (Plough) | M W 8:00 a.m. – 9:50 a.m.\n\nIntercultural Obligations\n\nThe majority of the world is multilingual. The United States is the exception. The socio-political and economic reasons for this are critically reviewed. The consequences for society and for the individual are also examined before turning our attention to our own increasing experiences of intercultural collaboration in school and in the workplace. The challenges and opportunities of these interactions are discussed and then analyzed. For example, how do different cultures view the role of hierarchy in the decision-making process? What are the rules for direct and indirect communication? What is the protocol for conflict resolution? In the end, who is responsible for the ‘success’ of these interactions? These are among the questions we address in class discussions and in writing.\n\nSection 002 (Livingston) | M W 10:20 a.m. – 12:10 p.m.\n\nThe Art and Practice of Creative Nonfiction\n\nCreative Nonfiction is a growing field of literary study, defined by the practice of telling true stories. While writing accurate depictions of real people and events is one of the terms nonfiction writers agree upon, most of the genre’s other understandings are highly contested. What are the ethics of telling true stories? What responsibilities do writers have to their subjects and audiences? What are the boundaries of the genre and its sub-genres? In other words, what makes a piece of writing creative nonfiction and not journalism, poetry, blogging, or spoken word? This writing course invites you to study the craft of creative nonfiction writing, including memoir, personal narrative, literary journalism, and hybrid forms like lyric essays, audio essays, visual essays, zines, and blogs. In this reading and writing-intensive course, you will learn writing and storytelling practices that that allow you to craft a writing persona that is both uniquely yours and connects you to histories of creative nonfiction writers. We will read across genres and cultures, learning about the process of writing creative nonfiction from invention to publication. You will leave The Art and Practice of Creative Nonfiction with an edited portfolio of creative nonfiction writing.\n\nSection 003 (Aronoff) | M W 10:20 a.m. - 12:10 p.m.\n\nTelling Stories: Composing Knowledges in Transcultural Contexts\n\nIn this section of RCAH 111, we will focus on the connection between culture and “storytelling,” broadly conceived. That is, we will examine the ways in which culture shapes the ways we perceive the world around us, and how we organize those perceptions into oral and written narratives – be they what we conventionally would call “stories” like personal narratives, myths or novels, or other genres like scientific, academic or philosophical writing, each with their own generic rules for the “stories” they tell. Drawing primarily on short stories and novels, we will be particularly interested in what happens when different “cultures,” or ways of knowing and writing, collide, clash or mix, in a process we will call “transculturation.” In what ways, we will ask, does “culture” provide us with narratives, patterns, genres, through which we “shape” our experience into something meaningful? In what ways do we deploy, bend, mix these “stories”? If culture might be defined as a shared system of meanings through which one interprets the world, in what ways might the classroom constitute “a culture,” and what kinds of “stories” are employed therein? In what ways are cultural “ways of knowing” embodied in (or constituted by, or complicated through) different genres of writing? What do each of these ways of knowing/writing/storytelling reveal or enable us to see, and what might they leave out? In what ways can certain kinds of writing or storytelling be seen as the mixing of, or struggle between, multiple systems of meaning or cultures? Possible course texts include Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony and/or Art Spiegelman’s Maus.\n\nSection 004 (Paula) | M W 12:40 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe Right to the City: Challenging Spatial Inequalities\n\nAs 21st century cities all over the globe face unprecedented transformations such as mass immigration, rapid urbanization, growing inequality, racial segregation, gentrification, and climate change, we are compelled to think about the struggles over urban resources we are confronted with"
