        "text": "The oldest medical specialty in the U.S., Otolaryngology deals with disorders of the ear, nose and throat, which include the head and neck. At the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Michigan Health System, we are on the cutting-edge of diagnosing, treating and rehabilitating patients with diseases of the head and neck. And, in coordination with our Comprehensive Cancer Center, we expertly treat head and neck cancers.\n\nOur Otolaryngological Services\n\nGeneral otolaryngology (common ear, nose and throat complaints)\n\nAcoustic neuromas (tumors of the balance nerve that affect hearing)\n\nCochlear implant\n\nDiseases of the ear\n\nHearing loss\n\nBalance disorders (vertigo, dizziness and unsteadiness)\n\nFacial paralysis (facial movement disorders)\n\nCosmetic and reconstructive surgery\n\nNose and sinus disorders\n\nVocal health and voice disorders\n\nCranial Base (tumors and disorders of the base of the skull)\n\nHead and neck oncology (cancer)\n\nThyroid and parathyroid disorders\n\nSleep disorders\n\nFacial and skull trauma\n\nLast year we saw more than 60,000 patients and performed 5,181 operations in 9,926 hours. Our Department has consistently been ranked in the top 10 according to U.S News and World Report. Through our Cochlear Implant Program, we have restored hearing to more than 2,000 children and adults. In addition, we have built a national reputation for hearing preservation with removal of acoustic neuromas. Through funding by the National Cancer Institute, the University of Michigan Head and Neck Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence was established in 2002 to study head and neck cancer. This is one of only five such programs in the U.S. The Program is intended to translate findings from the research laboratories into clinical practice (and vice versa) to significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of head and neck cancer while decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.\n\nMake an Appointment"
