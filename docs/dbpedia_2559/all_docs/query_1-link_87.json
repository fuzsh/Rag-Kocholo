        "text": "Reading Time: < 1 minute\n\nU.S. Senate | U.S. House | State Senate | Assembly | Constitutional amendments\n\nTHE DISTRICT\n\nThis district encompasses the Door County peninsula as well as Kewaunee County and a slice of Brown County. It’s a likely Republican district.\n\nTHE NUTSHELL\n\nRep. Joel Kitchens, R-Sturgeon Bay, faces a primary challenge from a familiar foe: Milt Swagel. Kitchens, who chairs the Assembly Education Committee, was first elected to the Assembly in 2014. Prior to that, he spent 14 years on the Sturgeon Bay Board of Education. Swagel is a farmer and veteran from Kewaunee who has served multiple terms on the Kewaunee County Board. He also challenged Kitchens in the primary in 2022. Kitchens easily won that primary, winning more than 75% of the vote. Swagel is running to Kitchens’ right. For example, he told Wisconsin Watch that unlike Kitchens, he’s willing to vote against the establishment and will tackle “foolish” spending in Madison. Swagel says he is a “working man” who will stand with the people. On the Democratic side, Renee Paplham is running unopposed in the Aug. 13 primary. Paplham would be “a representative who rises above partisan politics and takes on issues that improve the lives of working families,” she claimed in a statement announcing her campaign. But given the Republican slant of the district, she faces an uphill battle in November.\n\nPRIMARY RESULTS\n\nKitchens and Paplham both advanced. Kitchens easily defeated Swagel, while Paplham did not have a primary opponent.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nGreen Bay Press Gazette: Kitchens, Swagel talk issues ahead of GOP primary election for 1st Assembly district\n\nGreen Bay Press Gazette: A Kewaunee woman will run as a Democrat against Joel Kitchens for the Wisconsin Assembly\n\nAssembly stories\n\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.\n\nPopular stories from Wisconsin Watch\n\nThe byline \"Wisconsin Watch\" represents members of the Wisconsin Watch editorial and business staff.\n\nMore by Wisconsin Watch"
