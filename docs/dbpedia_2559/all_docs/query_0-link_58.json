How to Fight Terrorism, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, January/February 2002, at 8, which argues that declaring a “war” on terrorism was a “terrible and irrevocable error.” Id. at 8.\n\n2 The extent to which the GWOT represents a fundamental shift in U.S. strategies for dealing with threats is apparent in President Bush’s discussion of preemptive strategies.

Id. at 540.\n\n4 See, e.g., Jack M. Beard, America's New War on Terror: The Case for Self-Defense Under International Law, 25 HARVARD JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY 559 (2002).\n\n[T]he case for America's forcible response to the September 11 attacks as being fully consistent with the inherent right of self-defense under customary international law and Article 51 of the UN Charter is very strong. The unanimous condemnation of the attacks by the UN General Assembly, the affirmation of the right of self-defense by the Security Council, the growing consensus in the international community to hold states accountable for terrorist actions, and the repeated condemnation by the Security Council of the Taliban Regime's support of terrorists in particular, clearly help establish an appropriate framework under international law for the exercise of self-defense by the United States. Id. at 589-90.\n\n5 That component of international law that governs when it is that a State may resort to force in pursuit of its national interests, such as defending itself from armed attack.\n\n6 Pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:\n\n1.

There shall be taken into account together with the context:\n\nb. any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation ...\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969, art. 31, 1155 UNTS 331, 8 ILM 679 (1969). This point was reiterated by the International Court of Justice in Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the United Nations. There, the Court noted “the first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and apply the provisions of a treaty is to endeavor to give effect to them in their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur.” 1950 I.C.J. 4, 8.\n\n7 For background on bin Laden, see PETER L.

Res. 1368, pmbl. (Sept. 12, 2001). It is interesting that the Security Council did not reference self-defense in response to the 1998 attacks on the East African embassies even though the United States formally invoked Article 51. According to Article 39 of the UN Charter, the Security Council has cognizance over “any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression” and decides upon measures necessary to “maintain or restore international peace and security.” UN CHARTER, art. 39. Therefore, labeling the acts as a threat to international peace and security is normatively significant in that it empowers the Council to act.\n\n25 S.C. Res. 1373, pmbl.

But no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council, with the exception of measures against any enemy state, as defined in paragraph 2 of this Article, provided for pursuant to Article 1O7 or in regional arrangements directed against renewal of aggressive policy on the part of any such state, until such time as the Organization may, on request of the Governments concerned, be charged with the responsibility for preventing further aggression by such a state.\n\nUN CHARTER, art. 53.1.\n\n44 On this issue, see Adam Roberts, The So-Called 'Right' of Humanitarian Intervention, 3 YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 3 (2000).\n\n45 It has been suggested that the Article 2(4) prohibition does not apply in any event to limited strikes against terrorists based in another country. Such operations, so the reasoning goes, do not “violate the territorial integrity or political independence” of the State in which they occur since they are not directed against that State's personnel or property, are not intended to affect its political independence in any way, and are limited temporally to the period necessary to eradicate the terrorist threat.

In the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice held that the customary international law right of self-defense “continues to exist alongside treaty law,” specifically Article 51 of the Charter. To begin with, the article itself refers to the “inherent right” of individual and collective self-defense. More to the point in this inquiry is the fact that Article 51 leaves unanswered certain aspects of its exercise. As the Court pointed out, for instance, although Article 51 sets a threshold of “armed attack” for vesting of the right, there is no definition of that term. The Charter also fails to articulate the well accepted requirements that acts of self-defense be proportional and necessary. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. U.S.), Merits, I.C.J. Reports 1986, para. 176 [hereinafter Nicaragua]. See also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion), I.C.J. Reports 1996, para. 41 [hereinafter Nuclear Weapons]. Customary international law can prove useful in filling voids in the understanding of self-defense. This fact renders the current campaign normatively significant in that pervasive State practice over time, when the product of a sense of legal obligation, matures into received customary international law. The Afghanistan operations therefore represent important data points in the development of the right of self-defense.\n\n60 See Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW 885, 896 (1999).\n\n61 Nicaragua, see note 59 above, para. 195 (emphasis added).\n\n62 Note that Article 2(4) prohibition on the use of force applies only to States.\n\n63 In ascertaining whether an armed attack has occurred, resort is sometimes made to the term “aggression,” which was defined in General Assembly's Definition of Aggression Resolution. However, aggression is not wholly synonymous with armed attack. As Randelzhoffer has noted,\n\nThe travaux preparatoires of the Definition illustrate that a definition of 'armed attack' was not intended. In the special committee that worked out the Definition, the United States, supported by other Western states, strongly opposed tendencies to include the 'armed attack'. [CF the statements made by the U.S. representative (UN Doc. A/AC.134/S.C. 113, S.C 105, p. 17 and SC 108, p. 43), the representative of Japan (UN Doc. A/AC.134/S.C.112), and the UK (UN Doc. A/AC. 134/SC. 113).] Like the Soviet Union [see stmt by the Soviet Representative (UN Doc. A/AC.134/SC 105, p. 16)], they also expressed the view that the notions of 'act of aggression' and 'armed attack' are not identical [see the statement by the U.S. representative (UN Doc. A/AC.134/S.C. 105, p. 17)].\n\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer, Article 51, in THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS: A COMMENTARY 661, 668 (Bruno Simma ed., 1995).\n\n64 Letter from Daniel Webster to Lord Ashburton (Aug. 6, 1842), 29 BRITISH AND FOREIGN STATE PAPERS 1129, 1138 (1840-1).\n\n65 Nicaragua, see note 59 above, para. 176.\n\n66 Nuclear Weapons, see note 59 above, para. 41. See also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES 9O5 (1987). Ian Brownlie labels proportionality “the essence of self-defense.” IAN BROWNLIE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES 279 n. 2 (1963).\n\n67 Nuclear Weapons, see note 59 above, para. 41.\n\n68 Id., para. 42. There are, as noted in the discussion of self-defense, competing views of proportionality. India argued that the principle meant a nuclear weapon could not be used except in response to a nuclear attack. But even in such a case, so India argued, the use of nuclear weapons would be malum in se. Thus, any nuclear reprisal would be unlawful. Written Statement of the Government of India, June 20, 1995 (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons), at 2-3. Other approaches include “proportional to the harm caused,” vice “technique employed to cause the harm,” and “proportional to the force needed to cause the other side to desist.” Compare the approach of the Netherlands and United States, both of which argued that the legality would be situational, with that of India. Observations of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, June 16, 1995 (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons), at 12; Written Statement of the Government of the United States of America, June 20, 1995 (Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons), at 30.\n\n69 In a slightly different context, this approach lies at the heart of compellence strategies. On the issue of affecting an enemy's decision-making, see Jeanne M. Meyer, Tearing Down the Facade: A Critical Look at the Current Law on Targeting the Will of the Enemy and Air Force Doctrine, 51 AIR FORCE LAW REVIEW 143 (2001).\n\n70 Estimates of civilian casualties vary widely.

Herold, A Dossier on Civilian Victims of United States' Aerial Bombing of Afghanistan: A Comprehensive Accounting, Dec. 10, 2001, accessed June 18, 2002, http://www.cursor.org/stories/civilian_deaths.htm, (approximately 4,000 by Jan 1, 2002) with Carl Connetta, Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties, Jan. 18, 2002, accessed June 18, 2002, http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#ref7,(1,000-13,000 over the same period).

Gardam, Proportionality and Force in International Law, 87 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 391 (1993).\n\n72 Yoram Dinstein has rejected the terminology “anticipatory” in favor of “interceptive” on the basis that former term suggests that preventive actions in the face of a “foreseeable” armed attack are legitimate. For Professor Dinstein, the question is whether or not the “other side has committed itself to an armed attack in an ostensibly irrevocable way.” As he explains, “[t]he crucial question is who embarks upon an irreversible course of action, thereby crossing the Rubicon. This, rather than the actual opening of fire, is what casts the die and forms what may be categorized as an incipient armed attack. It would be absurd to require that the defending State should sustain and absorb a devastating (perhaps a fatal) blow, only to prove an immaculate conception of self-defense.” YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION AND SELF-DEFENSE 172 (3rd ed. 2001).\n\n73 See, e.g., Oscar Schachter, The Right of States to Use Armed Force, 82 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 1620, 1634-35 (1984).\n\n74 Schmitt, see note 60 above, at 932.\n\n75 See, e.g., Antonio Cassese, Terrorism is also Disrupting Some Crucial Legal Categories of International Law, European Journal of International Law Discussion Forum, accessed June 18, 2002, http://www.ejil.org/forum_WTC/ny-cassese.html.

It will be for it to show, also, that the local authorities of Canada, even supposing the necessity of the moment authorized them to enter the territories of The United States at all, did nothing unreasonable or excessive; since the act, justified by the necessity of self-defense, must be limited by that necessity, and kept clearly within it. It must be shown that admonition or remonstrance to the persons on board the Caroline was impracticable, or would have been unavailing; it must be shown that day-light could not be waited for; that there could be no attempt at discrimination between the innocent and the guilty; that it would not have been enough to seize and detain the vessel; but that there was a necessity, present and inevitable, for attacking her in the darkness of the night, while moored to the shore, and while unarmed men were asleep on board, killing some and wounding others, and then drawing her into the current, above the cataract, setting her on fire, and, careless to know whether there might not be in her the innocent with the guilty, or the living with the dead, committing her to a fate which fills the imagination with horror.

Rep. 4, 22.\n\n125 See discussion in JAMES CRAWFORD, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION'S ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY: INTRODUCTION, TEXT AND COMMENTARIES 77-85 (2002). Article 2 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (adopted by the Commission in 2001) provides that “There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an act or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law; and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” International Law Commission, Articles on State Responsibility, reprinted in id. at 61. These elements have been articulated in a number of tribunals. Among those referenced specifically by Professor Crawford are: Phosphates in Morocco, Preliminary Objections, 1938, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 74, p. 10; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, I.C.J.

Reports 1997, p. 7, 54, para. 78.\n\n126 The Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility describes a “state” as “a real organized entity, a legal person to act under international law.” Crawford, see note 125 above, at 82 (para. 5 of commentary to art. 2).\n\n127 Articles on State Responsibility, see note 125 above, arts. 34-37. Restitution is reestablishing “the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed” (art. 35); compensation is covering any financially assessable damage not made good by restitution (art. 36); satisfaction is “an acknowledgement of the breach, an expression of regret, a formal apology or another appropriate modality” that responds to shortfalls in restitution and compensation when making good the injury caused (art. 37).\n\n128 Id., art. 49.1.\n\n129 Crawford, see note 125 above, at 281.\n\n130 Articles on State Responsibility, see note 125 above, art. 52.3(a).\n\n131 Id., art. 51.\n\n132 Id., art. 52.1.\n\n133 Certain countermeasures employing force are permissible.

USA), 1980 I.C.J. 3.\n\n140 According to the court, Iranian authorities were “fully aware of their obligations to protect the premises of the U.S. Embassy and its diplomatic and consular staff from any attack [,] ... had the means at their disposal to perform their obligations [but,] ... completely failed to comply.” Id., para. 68. 141 Id., para. 73.\n\n142 Id., para. 74.\n\n143 This reality explains why the prohibition on forcible countermeasures is reasonable; the ban is compensated for in those cases where one might most want to engage in them - when victimized by an armed attack - by the existence of the right to self-defense. Conversely, the various limits on self-defense are compensated for by the fact that once the need for self-defense vanishes, the State that committed the wrongful attack remains liable for the consequences under the law of State responsibility. The classic example is the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. In S.C. Res. 681 (Apr. 3, 1991), the Security Council found that “Iraq ... is liable under international law for any direct loss, damage, including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources, or injury to foreign Governments, nationals and corporations, as a result of Iraq's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait.” It subsequently established the United Nations Compensation Commission to handle claims in S.C. Res. 692 (May 20, 1991).\n\n144 For instance, Oscar Schachter has argued “When a government provides weapons, technical advice, transportation, aid and encouragement to terrorists on a substantial scale, it is not unreasonable to conclude that an armed attack is imputable to the government.” Oscar Schachter, The Lawful Use of Force by a State Against Terrorists in Another Country, reprinted in HENRY H.
