        "text": "This article is about the year 2002. For other uses, see 2002 (disambiguation).\n\nCalendar year\n\nMillennium: 3rd millennium Centuries: Decades: Years:\n\n2002 by topic\n\n2002 (MMII) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2002nd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 2nd year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the 3rd year of the 2000s decade.\n\nCalendar year\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks of the previous year, foreign policy and international relations were generally united in combating al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. The United States especially was a leading force in combating terrorist groups. 2002 also saw the signing and establishment of many international agreements and institutions, most notably the International Criminal Court, the African Union, the Russian-American Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, and the Eurozone.\n\nThe global economy, partly due to the September 11 attacks, generally stagnated or declined. Stock indices, such as the American Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Japanese Nikkei 225 both ended the year lower than they had started. In the later parts of 2002, the world saw the beginning of a SARS epidemic, which would go on to affect mostly China, Europe, and North America.[1][2]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe world population on January 1, 2002, was estimated to be 6.272 billion people, and it increased to 6.353 billion people by January 1, 2003.[3] An estimated 134.0 million births and 52.5 million deaths took place in 2002.[3] The average global life expectancy was 67.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2001.[3] The rate of child mortality was 7.05%, a decrease of 0.27pp from 2001.[4] 26.85% of people were living in extreme poverty, a decrease of 1.40pp from 2000.[5]\n\nThe number of global refugees was approximately 12 million at the beginning of 2002, but it declined to 10.3 million by the end of the year. Approximately 2.4 million refugees were repatriated in 2002, of which 2 million were Afghan. 293,000 additional refugees were displaced in 2002, primarily from Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Ivory Coast, and the Central African Republic.[6]\n\nConflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Category:Conflicts in 2002\n\nThere were 31 recognised armed conflicts in 2002, a net decrease from the previous year: seven conflicts ended in 2001, while conflicts in Angola, Congo, and Ivory Coast began or resumed in 2002.[7] The deadliest conflicts in 2002 were those in Burundi, Colombia, Kashmir, Nepal, and Sudan.[7] Among developed nations in 2002, national defense shifted toward counterterrorism after the September 11 attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan the previous year. Conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Israel, and the Philippines were directly related to countering Islamic terrorism.[8]: 87\n\nInternal conflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Colombian conflict escalated after far-left insurgents occupied demilitarized zones and kidnapped Íngrid Betancourt, effectively ending peace talks. The insurgents began bombing cities, and over 200,000 Colombians were displaced by the conflict in 2002.[8]: 91–92\n\nThe Nepalese Civil War escalated in 2002, with casualties approximately equaling the combined totals from 1996 to 2001; half of this increase was civilian casualties, as civilians were targeted by both the Nepali government and the communist insurgents.[8]: 88–89 Chechen insurgents in Russia escalated their attacks during the Second Chechen War, destroying a Russian Mil Mi-26 in August and causing a hostage crisis in Moscow.[8]: 93–94 The Second Liberian Civil War also escalated, causing widespread displacement of civilians.[9]: 90\n\nConflicts that saw some form of resolution in 2002 include the Eelam War III in Sri Lanka, which was halted with a ceasefire agreement on February 24,[8]: 98 and the Angolan Civil War, which was resolved in April with a ceasefire between the Angolan government and UNITA.[9]: 89 Internationally brokered peace talks advanced in the Second Sudanese Civil War,[8]: 102 some factions of the Somali Civil War,[8]: 106 and the Second Congo War, with the latter producing an agreement on December 17 to create a Congolese transitional government.[8]: 100–101 Afghanistan underwent its first year without direct military conflict in over two decades, though sporadic attacks were carried out by the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda.[9]: 256 An agreement was reached with the government of Burundi and the CNDD-FDD on December 3, but the other major faction in Burundi, the Palipehutu-FNL, did not participate in peace talks.[7]\n\nThe largest attack on civilians in 2002 was a series of bombings in Bali that killed or injured hundreds on October 12, with Australian tourists making up a large portion of the victims.[10]: 228 The Washington D.C. area was the subject of several sniper attacks the same month, killing ten people. Europe underwent a large number of mass shootings throughout the year, including an attack on a town council meeting in France on March 27 that killed eight councilors and a school shooting in Germany on April 26—one of the deadliest in the world with 18 fatalities.[10]: 229\n\nInternational conflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe only direct conflict between nations in 2002 was the India–Pakistan standoff in Kashmir,[7] beginning in late 2001. This conflict was primarily one of brinkmanship, with the threat of nuclear warfare.[8]: 88 Riots in Gujarat and suicide bombings in Jammu further escalated tensions.[11]: 87 The two countries stood down in May.[8]: 88\n\nThe Second Intifada continued in 2002 between the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian paramilitary groups with an escalation in violence. Palestinian suicide bombings became coordinated to maximize the number of civilian casualties, while the Israeli military killed approximately twice as many Palestinians in retaliation.[11]: 73 In response to the suicide bombings, Israel carried out Operation Defensive Shield in March.[9]: 413 Under this operation, Israel occupied much of West Bank,[9]: 413 and it and briefly held Palestinian president Yasser Arafat under house arrest.[8]: 95 The Battle of Jenin was particularly destructive, with the United Nations finding both parties to be irresponsible regarding collateral damage.[8]: 96\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nArt and architecture\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: 2002 in art and 2002 in architecture\n\nEconomic downturn and aftermath the September 11 attacks limited the art industry in 2002. Organizations were less willing to give patronage, and tourists were less willing to visit art exhibitions and museums, particularly in New York and the Middle East.[12]: 502 The Documenta11 exhibition took place in Kassel, Germany, contributing to the early movement of art globalization with its focus on experimental and documentary works from developing nations. Traditional visual art was mostly replaced by film and photography at the exhibition.[12]: 503 [13] Critically acclaimed paintings in 2002 include The Upper Room, a collection of paintings by Chris Ofili based on a drawing of a monkey by Andy Warhol,[14] and Dispersion, an abstract work by Julie Mehretu.[15]\n\nThe architecture world focused on the rebuilding of the World Trade Center, and various exhibitions were held to showcase design concepts. The Tribute in Light was implemented on the site during the interim.[10]: 155 Egypt began accepting designs for the Grand Egyptian Museum.[10]: 234\n\nNew structures constructed or opened in 2002 include the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester, the Gallery of Horyuji Treasures in Tokyo,[10]: 156 The Gherkin in London, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria.[12]: 506 The Bronx Developmental Center in New York, Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, and the Lever House in New York were all renovated, and the Maslon House was demolished in California.[10]: 157\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nPopular media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe highest-grossing films globally in 2002 were The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Spider-Man. The highest-grossing non-English film was Hero (Mandarin), the 28th highest-grossing film of the year.[16] Film was marked by several unexpected successes and failures in 2002, including the underwhelming performances of the Star Wars film Attack of the Clones, the James Bond film Die Another Day, and the Disney film Treasure Planet, as well as the word-of-mouth success of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[17] Critically acclaimed films from 2002 include Adaptation,[18][19][20] Far from Heaven,[19][20][21] and Talk to Her.[19][20][21]\n\nMusic sales in 2002 amounted to about 3 billion units, a decline of 8% from 2001. CD albums remained the dominant form of music, making up 89% of the market. DVD music sales increased by 40%, while cassette tape music sales decreased by 36%.[22] Pop music saw a major decline in 2002 as it was overtaken by country music and hip hop music.[23] Globally, the best-selling albums in 2002 were The Eminem Show by Eminem, Let Go by Avril Lavigne, and the Elvis Presley greatest hits album ELV1S: 30 No. 1 Hits. The best-selling non-English album was Mensch (transl. Human) by German singer Herbert Grönemeyer, the 29th best-selling album overall.[24]\n\nSony and Microsoft introduced online gaming services for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, respectively.[10]: 174 Critically acclaimed video games released in 2002 include Eternal Darkness, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Metroid Prime, Metroid Fusion, and Super Mario Sunshine.[25][26][27] Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was influential in the war-based first-person shooter genre with its portrayal of grand cinematic battles. 2002 was the final year of traditional survival horror before it was overtaken by action-based survival horror games in franchises such as Resident Evil.[28]\n\nLibraries, press, and radio\n\n[edit]\n\nCosta Rica was celebrated for an advance in free speech when it abolished criminal penalties for insulting public officials.[10]: 275 Radio in India became more popular in 2002 following deregulation, with five major stations in Mumbai breaking the state monopoly in April and with significant increases in the sales of car and pocket radios. Good Evening Afghanistan premiered in September to provide the Afghan people real-time updates on the nation's political situation, and Radio Liberty was expelled from Russia in October.[10]: 272 An expected recovery of the newspaper industry did not materialize in 2002 as digital media became more common, resulting in significant cutbacks.[10]: 273 The magazine industry faced similar challenges, as well as a separate controversy when the February 11 issue of Newsweek International was banned throughout the Muslim world for its depiction of Muhammed.[10]: 275\n\nThe British Library digitized a 700-year-old edition of the Quran, and the Library of Congress made high resolution scans of a Gutenberg Bible for closer study of Gutenberg's printing methods. Library services were interrupted several times in 2002. Librarians' strikes affected the United Kingdom and the United States, while funding problems led to cutbacks in Germany, South Africa, and the United States.[10]: 233\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 in sports\n\nThe 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, with Norway winning the most gold medals. Allegations that a figure skating judge was bribed to favor Russia in a figure skating event led to France and Russia both receiving gold medals in the event.[12]: 515 [29] The Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester.[12]: 516\n\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was held in Japan and South Korea, and it ended with a 2–0 victory by Brazil over Germany. The traditionally well-performing teams of Argentina, France, and Italy did not meet expectations, while Senegal, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States performed better than they had historically.[12]: 513\n\nIn boxing, the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson was preceded by a scuffle during a press conference. Lennox Lewis went on to defeat Mike Tyson.[12]: 520 [29] In American football, the Tuck Rule Game between the New England Patriots and the Oakland Raiders became a national controversy after officials cited the obscure tuck rule to challenge a pass by Tom Brady.[30] Bruno Peyron set the record for the fastest circumnavigation by sailing in 2002, making the trip in 64 days.[12]: 521\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational trade increased by 1.9% in 2002, correcting from a decrease in 2001.[31]: 11 Most countries experienced only limited growth of output and employment in the year, and economic policy within the largest economies focused primarily on combating inflation.[31]: 1 The gross world product increased by 1.7%, the second lowest growth in a decade after that of 2001.[31]: 2 Most developed nations began 2002 in a budget surplus and ended in a deficit.[31]: 8 The Euro, a single official currency for the nations of the European Union, was introduced on January 1.[12]: 6\n\nThe early 2000s recession began to stabilize in the final months of the year.[31]: 1 Growth was focused in the first half of the year before tapering in the second half[31]: 35 as stock markets entered into a downturn.[32] By October, global equities saw a 24% decrease in 2002.[10]: 185 Particularly affected was AOL-Time Warner, with its stocks losing 65% of their value by the fall.[11]: 100 The information technology industry in particular saw major decline in 2002[10]: 170 before it began its recovery from the dot-com crash that had previously affected it.[12]: 458 The telecommunications industry was affected even more severely.[10]: 176\n\nThe price drops associated with the September 11 attacks persisted for several months into 2002.[31]: 7 Apprehensions about potential military conflict in Iraq also limited growth.[10]: 185 Latin American economies with large deficits were severely affected by lower prices, limiting export growth and preventing capital from entering the region, requiring further increases to the deficit.[31]: 3 The region overall saw a negative GDP in 2002.[31]: 4 Imports grew significantly in East Asia, with China competing with the United States as one of the largest export markets for other countries in the region.[31]: 12 Imports in Latin America and Africa decreased compared to the previous year.[31]: 13\n\nThe United States recovered in part from the recession that had affected the Western world, while Europe's recovery was more limited.[12]: 10 South America saw significant economic challenges: Argentina's economic crisis continued from 2001, Brazil had low confidence in its economy, and Venezuela's economy suffered amid political upheaval.[12]: 13 Unlike the Western world, Eastern Europe and Asia showed strong growth in 2002.[12]: 11 Africa did not share this growth, as it also experienced a weak economy during the year.[12]: 14\n\nSeveral companies, predominantly in the United States, underwent major scandals in 2002. These included the WorldCom scandal that led to what was then the largest bankruptcy in American history, and accounting scandals emerging from the previous year's Enron scandal.[32]: 92–93 Xerox and the French company Vivendi were found to be reporting artificially inflated profits.[10]: 186 Others incidents included the ImClone stock trading case and fraud cases at Adelphia and Tyco. These scandals brought the arrests of several high-profile executives,[11] negatively affected public trust in corporate accounting,[10]: 185 and increased the volatility of global stock markets.[10]: 186\n\nEnvironment and weather\n\n[edit]\n\n2002 was the second hottest year on record, exceeded only by 1998.[33] There was below average precipitation in 2002, with droughts in Australia, northern China, India, and western United States.[33] Heavy rains in late 2002 caused significant flooding in eastern Asia[33] and central Europe.[11]: 77 The effects of the Asian brown cloud were documented in August by the United Nations Environment Programme, warning of severe agricultural and meteorological effects in Afghanistan, northwestern India, and Pakistan.[10]: 184\n\nThe third Global Environment Outlook report was published in May.[12]: 465 The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in Johannesburg beginning on August 26. A number of proposals were endorsed in the summit, though environmentalists criticized the United States for not supporting stronger measures.[10]: 209 The European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol, while China and Russia announced their intent to do so. Australia and the United States rejected the protocol.[10]: 211 The war in Afghanistan caused widespread environmental issues, with forests destroyed, wildlife poached by refugees,[10]: 213 and the Kabul Zoo requiring international support.[10]: 215 The Kitulo National Park opened in Tanzania to preserve the endemic orchid species.[10]: 239\n\nEfforts to promote carbon sequestration were mixed in 2002. An experiment to study whether there were risks of pollution was shuttered following pressure from environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, but Statoil reported success in a six-year-long experiment in the North Sea later in the year.[10]: 212\n\nThe January eruption of Mount Nyiragongo brought destruction to Goma, prompting an evacuation of 400,000 people, with 12,000 finding themselves homeless with damage across 14 villages.[10]: 182 A major oil spill took place off the coast of Galicia, Spain, when the MV Prestige ruptured and sank in November.[11]: 87 The deadliest earthquake in 2002 was a 6.1-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Afghanistan on March 25, killing approximately 1,000 people.[34] A 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Iran killed approximately 200 people the following June.[10]: 182 North America saw one of its most intense earthquakes when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska on November 3, but the remote location prevented any fatalities.[10]: 181\n\nThe 2002 Atlantic hurricane season saw 12 named storms, a near-average number. Most of them were relatively minor, with only 4 four becoming hurricanes, of which two attained major hurricane status. The season's activity was limited to between July and October, a rare occurrence caused partly by El Niño conditions. The two major hurricanes, Hurricane Isidore and Hurricane Lili, both made landfall in Cuba and the United States, and combined were responsible for most of the season's damages and deaths.[35] The 2002 Pacific typhoon season entailed a typical number of typhoons, but they were above average in intensity with 46% of typhoons reaching \"intense strength\". Typhoon Rusa was the deadliest typhoon in 2002, killing at least 113 people in South Korea.[36]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Category:2002 in health\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognized \"reducing risks\" and \"promoting healthy life\" as its health concern of focus in the 2002 World Health Report.[37] Global food supplies reduced in 2002 amid droughts and drops in harvest yields.[10]: 146 Famines occurred in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.[12]: 6 Eritrea, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Swaziland were also heavily affected by insufficient food.[10]: 146 The fishing industry was not affected, increasing slightly from previous years.[10]: 149\n\nA 2001 ebola outbreak in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo continued through 2002.[10]: 221 The United States and the Dutch company Crucell collaborated to begin development on an ebola vaccine in response.[10]: 222 The year's increased focus on terrorism, particularly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, prompted many countries to invest in vaccines, antibiotics, and antivirals as a precaution against bioterrorism.[10]: 221 Renewed attention was brought to the case of family doctor Harold Shipman when it was announced in July that he had killed 200 other people under his care beyond the 15 for which he was prosecuted.[10]: 232\n\nPolitics and law\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 in politics\n\n2002 saw the creation of a new sovereign nation in East Timor.[12]: 1 Brazil, Lesotho, and Senegal established democracy in 2002 through the acceptance of fair elections, while Bahrain and Kenya moved toward democracy through the strengthening of political institutions. Democracy was disestablished in Ivory Coast and Togo following mass political violence and unfair elections, respectively.[38]: 14 Afghanistan underwent significant liberalization under a transitional government following end of major fighting in the War in Afghanistan, particularly in the capital of Kabul, though distant regions of the country remained oppressed by warlords.[38]: 15 Civil rights also increased following the end of conflicts in Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia.[38]: 15–16 Turkey lessened its restrictions on the country's Kurdish population.[38]: 16\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party chose Hu Jintao as its next leader in a November meeting.[11]: 87 The African Union formally came into existence in July.[12]: 7 The United Kingdom held a Golden Jubilee celebration for Queen Elizabeth II, marking fifty years as the monarch.[11]: 78 In Latin America, the great depression in Argentina continued into 2002, causing significant political turmoil. Venezuela also underwent political crisis with an attempted coup against President Hugo Chávez in April and a national strike against his administration later in the year.[39] Brazil elected the leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in response to the economic instability.[11]: 86\n\nNATO established a diplomatic relationship with Russia through the NATO-Russia Council in May, and NATO announced seven new members in November: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. This expansion meant that NATO countries bordered Russia for the first time.[10]: 282 Russia and the United States signed the Treaty of Moscow nuclear disarmament agreement in May, but the United States left the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the following month, and Russia then left the START II treaty. The International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation was signed by over 90 countries in November.[10]: 277\n\nCrime and international law\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Rome Statute entered into force in July, establishing the International Criminal Court.[12]: 469 The International Court of Justice ruled in three cases: it ruled that diplomatic immunity applied to all crimes, including crimes against humanity, and it settled two territorial disputes, ruling in favor of Cameroon over Nigeria and in favor of Malaysia over Indonesia.[12]: 471–472 A lesser court was established by the United Nations in Sierra Leone to prosecute figures associated with the nation's civil war.[40]: 470\n\nThe prosecution of former Yugoslavian Slobodan Milošević began in February,[10]: 225 but it was delayed and the genocide portion of the charges against him was dropped.[11]: 86 Biljana Plavšić, the former president of Republika Srpska, plead guilty to crimes against humanity in a related case.[10]: 225 In August, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda saw the arrests of nine more people accused of genocide, including army chief of staff Augustin Bizimungu. Efforts failed to create a similar tribunal in Cambodia to prosecute Khmer Rouge.[10]: 226 Former military dictator of Argentina Leopoldo Galtieri was arrested in July for his actions in the Dirty War. Two generals from the Salvadoran Civil War were found liable for torture in an American court, and they were ordered to pay $54.6 million in damages.[10]: 282 A major espionage case in the United States ended in May with Robert Hanssen sentenced to life in prison for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.[10]: 232\n\nSerbia and Montenegro abolished capital punishment to qualify for entry to the Council of Europe, and Turkey did so to garner support for its incorporation into the European Union. Prisoners in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey engaged in deadly strikes and riots in response to poor conditions in 2002. Urso Branco Prison was the location of a deadly gang fight, and approximately 150 inmates escaped from a Haitian prison when a bulldozer was driven through a wall to free a local leader.[10]: 232\n\nWar on terror\n\n[edit]\n\nTerrorism dominated politics internationally in 2002, with both terrorist acts and attempts to declare groups as terrorist organizations being prevalent throughout the year. Islamic terrorism was widely seen as responsible for terrorist attacks throughout the year.
