        "text": "John Robert Harris, 85, longtime Monterey Peninsula performing artist, filmmaker and movie theater owner, died on May 8 at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula. A beloved figure in this region, he moved here from Hollywood in 1969. He and his partner Alan Weber established the 812 Cinema on Cannery Row, their famous “pillow theater.” Later, the two built the Dream Theater in New Monterey. The 812 and Dream were lovingly built with creative ingenuity and the spirit of this community in mind.\n\nMany of us who connected with Harris were drawn to his affable intelligence, generous spirit, and passion for films. Harris’s favorite film, Federico Fellini’s “8 ½, ” inspired the location of the movie house with its iconic address of 812 Cannery Row. Its padded flooring, comfortable pillow seating, and wafting incense provided an enticing way to enjoy films such as “El Topo,” Fellini’s “Satyricon” and “Seven Samurai.”\n\nThe most watched film at the 812 was the 1970’s cult hit “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” My brother Mark Shuler was projectionist during that era. He says a tribute to Harris’s meticulous care of the new 35 mm projectors was that he insisted on a daily startup routine to ensure that the machines remained in as close to perfect running condition as possible. “I personally ran the Rocky Horror Picture Show nearly 1,000 times over the years when it was the only movie at the 812,” he says. “Representatives from 20th Century Fox visited the theater once and were astounded at the flawless condition of the print.” He says Harris’s copy of Rocky Horror remained in top condition for years, when other theaters needed replacements as often as weeks into their runs.\n\nHarris created a novel intermission show at the 812 by splicing together images from a large cache of donated 16 mm commercials. He took the flashy bits without product content and created a multi-projector visual extravaganza. Mark Shuler says, “Customers lay on the pillows, breathing in the scents of coconut and orange peel, dazzled by kaleidoscopic effects as they listened to ‘The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys’ by Traffic.”\n\nBert Adams expressed the sentiments of regulars who loved these two establishments in a Facebook post:. “The only movie theaters I can remember are the Dream Theater and the 812. Every other movie theatre I’ve ever been in hasn’t been worth remembering.”\n\nHarris’s enthusiasm for film began as a kid. In 1951, his parents gave him a Crown Graphic Gravlex camera. It held magic that opened a world of expression and discovery, setting a course for the rest of his life. With this tool, he gained skill, an artist’s eye, and a love of photography. Recently he acquired a used Gravlex of the same vintage. “Camera geekery,” he wrote on Facebook, “It’s old, smells, is wonderful and arrived today … Full circle in honor of my parents’ love for all things creative.”\n\nHe explored digital filmmaking with the same zeal he brought to celluloid, mastering computer editing and new technology. When 3-D cameras became affordable, Harris taught himself how to produce his own movies, often featuring footage of our natural surroundings. An animal lover, Harris knew how to communicate with wild creatures to encourage their best Cecille B. DeMille film takes.\n\nSpending time with Harris, one learned about advances in both still photography and filmmaking. He dove into the weeds with anyone who would listen about the advances and importance of 3-D technology and would outfit us with the requisite spectacles to watch his own rushes or the latest 3-D creations out of Hollywood.\n\nAnd there was always popcorn!\n\nHis own 3-D full-length movie, “Steinbeck Country: Monterey to Big Sur,” premiered at Lighthouse Cinemas in Pacific Grove in 2011. A nature and meditation film, it was, as The Herald’s Dennis Taylor wrote, “his love letter to the paradise that has been his home since 1969.” And though his “Mystery of Dreams” film remains unfinished, it contains some of his finest 3-D footage.\n\nHarris, who possessed a crooner’s voice, was also deeply geeky about microphones and audio processors. His last Facebook posting features an image of his new Tascam mixer with the words, “What a monster! Learning curve in motion! Multi track voices…Amazing!” As a popular singer and pianist on the Peninsula for 25 years, he traveled to gigs with his keyboard and sound systems. He even removed the front passenger seat of his vintage blue Miata to make room for his equipment.\n\nKelly Productions represented his appearances at local venues as well as for private parties and corporate clients. Arden Eaton, production and promotion manager of the talent agency, says, “John was an infectious force for positivity. Always singing, always smiling with a warm word for all, John’s legacy as an integral part of the Monterey Peninsula’s artistic community will endure.”\n\nHarris excelled at improvisation. When his friend, singer Linda Purdy, would show up for his gigs, the spontaneous fun and hilarity was contagious she said. Their antics didn’t stop there.\n\n“John called me numerous times to meet him at one of the beaches on the Peninsula,” Purdy said, remembering. “He would have a plan, so I dared not say no. Nor did I want to. After gathering formal attire and outrageous hats, I would arrive as he was arranging his filming equipment. He then positioned me up and down the beach and would direct me unmercifully. Within minutes, we attracted crowds of onlookers. John always took time to speak with the people at these gatherings. He was in heaven, his audience enthralled!”\n\nAnother incident occurred on Los Laureles grade after a delicate medical procedure. “While driving him home over the Grade listening to his favorite music, he said, `Stop the car at the next turnout and boost the music up as loud as you can! We gotta get out and dance until we drop!’ So we did. Once again, the crowds gathered. Uncontrollable laughter ensued. That was life with John!”\n\nHarris grew up in Culver, Oregon, but traveled to Los Angeles as a young man. His talents were quickly recognized by celebrities Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis and Ann-Margret, among others, with whom he collaborated as a back-up singer and dancer. He appeared in Ann-Margret’s Las Vegas debut and worked with her on other projects. They developed a lifelong friendship. He played the Ed Sullivan Show, the Hollywood Palace, met Elvis Presley, and did a USO tour to Asia and around the U.S. Throughout his Hollywood career, he continued filming and maintained an archive of movies and photos of celebrities from that era.\n\nDuring his five and a half decades on the Peninsula, he lent his expertise to numerous film and audio projects, theater productions, weddings and still photo shoots. He is survived by his brother Bill Harris and his nieces and nephews.\n\nHis agent John Kelly sums it up this way: “John was forever the dreamer, always working on new projects, always improving his craft as a performer, always looking forward. He was an entertainer who engaged with his audience in a positive and authentic way. To borrow some words from Bob Dylan, John was forever young, and those of us lucky to know him were graced by his good vibes and limitless talents.”\n\nAn announcement will be made later through Kelly Productions about a Celebration of Life for John. A Go Fund Me Account is being set up to cover expenses left in his estate.\n\nBarbara Rose Shuler, who covers classical music and theater for the Herald, met John Harris shortly after he arrived on the Peninsula in 1969. In addition to their longstanding friendship, they have collaborated professionally on projects over the years, including voiceovers for his films and studio work related to her morning announcing job with the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance."
