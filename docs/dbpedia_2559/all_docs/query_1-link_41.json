That means maintaining our sustainability certifications and carefully planning out how we care for state forests. These management strategies include science-based methods such as planting and harvesting trees, improving wildlife habitat, reducing wildfire risk with careful prescribed burning and controlling invasive pests so we'll have forests now and for future generations."
