        "text": "MARQUETTE, MI - There were several reasons Mike Maple reached into lumberjack lore to come up with the title to his band Liquid Mike’s breakthrough fifth album, “Paul Bunyan’s Slingshot.”\n\nMaple grew up around small towns in rural Wisconsin that paid homage to the lumberjack with statues that always seemed to fall far short of recreating his larger-than-life appearance. He wondered what all the fuss was about surrounding the fictional character’s folklore and why so many small towns claimed him as their own, but also wanted to make a record that reflected growing up in those small towns.\n\nBeyond that, the Marquette resident felt confident he was creating a record with a sound big enough to live up to the album’s title, which borrowed inspiration from another Upper Peninsula homage to Paul Bunyan near Gladstone.\n\n“I was trying to make a big sounding record,” Maple said. “Who’s bigger than Paul Bunyan?”\n\nThe band’s bigger, thicker pop punk sound on the loosely thematic “Paul Bunyan’s Slingshot” has helped Liquid Mike create its own bit of folklore. The band has quickly evolved from a bedroom recording project Maple and friends did for their own enjoyment to being featured as a band to watch by Rolling Stone and several other online publications since the album’s Feb. 2 release, with critics heaping praise on the band’s short, catchy jams that reflect life in rural Northern Michigan.\n\nTo capitalize on its growing fanbase, Liquid Mike plans to hit the road for its first true set of tour dates this week, moving past its history of occasional one-off performances and house shows the band has made in Marquette and other parts of the state in the past. They’ll play in front of a sold-out audience on Friday, Feb. 23 at Bell’s Brewery in Kalamazoo in support of noted Kalamazoo emo band Saturdays at Your Place.\n\n“I kind of just expected to keep making records for just friends and stuff to hear for the foreseeable future, but it’s been really nice that people have connected with it,” Maple said. “I thought people were making fun of me or something for a second. It didn’t seem conceivable that people could really, really like it, but we’re super happy with it.”\n\nMaple was born in Ashland, Wisconsin, a community of about 7,000 people on the Wisconsin-Michigan border and southwest tip of Lake Superior. He first came to Michigan as a college student to study sound design at Michigan Technological University before eventually leaving the program and earning a degree in communications, forging some of the friendships that would inspire him to come back.\n\nMaple returned to Michigan during the pandemic when he and fellow band member Monica Nelson were getting restless and looking for a place to relocate. They agreed to make the move to Marquette over Minneapolis on account of knowing more people in the Northern Michigan college town.\n\nMaple and Nelson are joined by Zack Alworden on bass and Dave Daignault on guitar, who each bring depth to the band’s sound and experience as members of Houghton emo band Charmer. Drummer Cody Marecek, the only member of Liquid Mike who doesn’t live in Marquette, rounds out the band.\n\nThe newfound support and critical acclaim Liquid Mike has garnered recently has the entire band more excited about hitting the road, Maple said, after it spent its first couple of years wondering if fans actually wanted to hear them.\n\n“We’ve played maybe one show outside of the (Upper Peninsula),” Maple said. “Touring never really made sense to us until about a year ago. Now we kind of all really want to do it.”\n\nAfter prolifically self-releasing three albums in a two-year span, Liquid Mike began to gain traction with its self-titled 2023 album that made the rounds on social media, helping the band grow from hundreds of monthly Spotify listeners to nearly 22,000 in a few months with their brand of crushing power chords and sticky hooks.\n\nLike Rolling Stone, some publications have made note of Maple’s profession as a mail carrier for the United States Postal Service, drawing comparisons to rockers who at one time held down working class jobs like Paul Westerberg and Robert Pollard.\n\nMaple calls his job with the USPS the “weirdest one he’s ever had,” but certainly not out of the ordinary for a rock musician, and one that has made him more observant about the “summer town” community he has lived in the past three years.\n\n“Every day is kind of the same, and it’s also a little bit different, too,” Maple said. “You walk the same route, but it’s just not quite the same every time you do it. You have weird interactions with people that are either happy or mad to see you. You see who’s getting broken up with, who’s moving out, who’s voting for who. It’s weird. I does keep my head kind of fresh, I think.”\n\nThe malaise and sameness of everyday living inspired by both Marquette and the other small towns Maple has lived in are a throughline on “Paul Bunyan’s Slingshot.” It’s the first time Maple has tried to intentionally explore themes on an album like the doldrums of isolation and how you seek to cure the boredom.\n\nThe songs are short and reminiscent of the mid-90′s alternative rock like Weezer, Guided By Voices, Superchunk and Sugar, while also sharing similarities with noisy underground rock contemporaries like Dazy, Ex Pilots and Graham Hunt.\n\nMaple said the album was his contribution to a long-standing tradition in pop punk music of focusing on describing his hometown, from enduring the harsh winters to seeking out cheap thrills. “Mouse Trap,” a standout track on “Paul Bunyan’s Slingshot,” thinks bigger about these themes and brings the message home with lyrics like “Given what you know, the American dream is a Michigan hoax/ You can see it from your window/ Rust on the frame from the salt on the road.”\n\n“I was kind of being cheeky and kind of leaning into it a little bit, but I kind of wanted to do it in a way that was more showy than tell,” Maple said of his songwriting approach.\n\n“I feel like this (album) was a lot more focused thematically. Every record, I feel like I get a little bit better at the production and I can see it all in my head, like where things should fit in the songs. With this album, it sounds a little bit thicker - the songs are a little bit longer, it’s a little bit more focused. I feel like it just got a little bit better on a lot of fronts.”\n\nWhile the reception to “Paul Bunyan’s Slingshot” has recalibrated the band’s expectations for the future, Maple said he wants to keep following the same process that has led to Liquid Mike building up its own bit of folklore in the music world.\n\n“This is the first time I guess I’ve ever had a goal for the band,” he said. “I think my goal still is just to make a good record every time - or a record that I like.”"
