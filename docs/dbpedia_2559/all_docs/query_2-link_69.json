        "text": "Sustain Talk and Change Talk\n\nRecognizing sustain talk and change talk in clients will help you better explore and address their ambivalence. Sustain talk consists of client statements that support not changing a health-risk behavior, like substance misuse. Change talk consists of client statements that favor change (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Sustain talk and change talk are expressions of both sides of ambivalence about change. Over time, MI has evolved in its understanding of what keeps clients stuck in ambivalence about change and what supports clients to move in the direction of changing substance use behaviors. Client stuck in ambivalence will engage in a lot of sustain talk, whereas clients who are more ready to change will engage in more change talk with stronger statements supporting change.\n\nGreater frequency of client sustain talk in sessions is linked to poorer substance use treatment outcomes (Lindqvist, Forsberg, Enebrink, Andersson, & Rosendahl, 2017; Magill et al., 2014; Rodriguez, Walters, Houck, Ortiz, & Taxman, 2017). Conversely, MI-consistent counselor behavior focused on eliciting and reflecting change talk, more client change talk compared with sustain talk, and stronger commitment change talk are linked to better substance use outcomes (Barnett, Moyers, et al., 2014; Borsari et al., 2018; Houck, Manuel, & Moyers, 2018; Magill et al., 2014, 2018; Romano & Peters, 2016). Counselor empathy is also linked to eliciting client change talk (Pace et al., 2017).\n\n“In MI, your main goal is to evoke change talk and minimize evoking or reinforcing sustain talk in counseling sessions.\n\nAnother development in MI is the delineation of different kinds of change talk. The acronym for change talk in MI is DARN-CAT (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nDesire to change: This is expressed in statements about wanting something different— “I want to find an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting” or “I hope to start going to AA.”\n\n•\n\nAbility to change: This is expressed in statements about self-perception of capability— “I could start going to AA.”\n\n•\n\nReasons to change: This is expressed as arguments for change—”I'd probably learn more about recovery if I went to AA” or “Going to AA would help me feel more supported.”\n\n•\n\nNeed to change: This is expressed in client statements about importance or urgency—”I have to stop drinking” or “I need to find a way to get my drinking under control.”\n\n•\n\nCommitment: This is expressed as a promise to change—”I swear I will go to an AA meeting this year” or “I guarantee that I will start AA by next month.”\n\n•\n\nActivation: This is expressed in statements showing movement toward action—”I'm ready to go to my first AA meeting.”\n\n•\n\nTaking steps: This is expressed in statements indicating that the client has already done something to change—”I went to an AA meeting” or “I avoided a party where friends would be doing drugs.”\n\nExhibit 3.3 depicts examples of change talk and sustain talk that correspond to DARN-CAT.\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.3. Examples of Change Talk and Sustain Talk.\n\nTo make the best use of clients' change talk and sustain talk that arise in sessions, remember to:\n\n•\n\nRecognize client expressions of change talk but don't worry about differentiating various kinds of change talk during a counseling session.\n\n•\n\nUse reflective listening to reinforce and help clients elaborate on change talk.\n\n•\n\nUse DARN-CAT in conversations with clients.\n\n•\n\nRecognize sustain talk and use MI strategies to lessen the impact of sustain talk on clients' readiness to change (see discussion of responding to change talk and sustain talk in the next section).\n\n•\n\nBe aware that both sides of ambivalence (change talk and sustain talk) will be present in your conversations with clients.\n\nA New Look at Resistance\n\nUnderstanding the role of resistance and how to respond to it can help you maintain good counselor-client rapport. Resistance in SUD treatment has historically been considered a problem centered in the client. As MI has developed over the years, its understanding of resistance has changed. Instead of emphasizing resistance as a pathological defense mechanism, MI views resistance as a normal part of ambivalence and a client's reaction to the counselor's approach in the moment (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nA client may express resistance in sustain talk that favors the “no change” side of ambivalence. The way you respond to sustain talk can contribute to the client becoming firmly planted in the status quo or help the client move toward contemplating change. For example, the client's show of ambivalence about change and your arguments for change can create discord in your therapeutic relationship.\n\nClient sustain talk is often evoked by discord in the counseling relationship (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Resistance is a two-way street. If discord arises in conversation, change direction or listen more carefully. This is an opportunity to respond in a new, perhaps surprising, way and to take advantage of the situation without being confrontational. This new way of looking at resistance is consistent with the principles of person-centered counseling described at the beginning of the chapter.\n\nAsking Open Questions\n\nUse open questions to invite clients to tell their story rather than closed questions, which merely elicit brief information. Open questions are questions that invite clients to reflect before answering and encourage them to elaborate. Asking open questions helps you understand their point of view. Open questions facilitate a dialog and do not require any particular response from you. They encourage clients to do most of the talking and keep the conversation moving forward. Closed questions evoke yes/no or short answers and sometimes make clients feel as if they have to come up with the right answer. One type of open question is actually a statement that begins with “Tell me about” or “Tell me more about.” The “Tell me about” statement invites clients to tell a story and serves as an open question.\n\nExhibit 3.4 provides examples of closed and open questions. As you read these examples, imagine you are a client and notice the difference in how you might receive and respond to each kind of question.\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.4. Closed and Open Questions.\n\nThere may be times when you must ask closed questions, for example, to gather information for a screening or assessment. However, if you use open questions—”Tell me about the last time you used methamphetamines”—you will often get the information you need and enhance the process of engagement. During assessment, avoid the question-and-answer trap, which can decrease rapport, become an obstacle to counselor-client engagement, and stall conversations.\n\nMI involves maintaining a balance between asking questions and reflective listening (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Ask one open question, and follow it with two or more reflective listening responses.\n\nReflective Listening\n\nReflective listening is the key component of expressing empathy. Reflective listening is fundamental to person-centered counseling in general and MI in particular (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Reflective listening (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nCommunicates respect for and acceptance of clients.\n\n•\n\nEstablishes trust and invites clients to explore their own perceptions, values, and feelings.\n\n•\n\nEncourages a nonjudgmental, collaborative relationship.\n\n•\n\nAllows you to be supportive without agreeing with specific client statements.\n\nReflective listening builds collaboration and a safe and open environment that is conducive to examining issues and eliciting the client's reasons for change. It is both an expression of empathy and a way to selectively reinforce change talk (Romano & Peters, 2016). Reflective listening demonstrates that you are genuinely interested in understanding the client's unique perspective, feelings, and values. Expressions of counselor empathy predict better substance use outcomes (Moyers, Houck, Rice, Longabaugh, & Miller, 2016). Your attitude should be one of acceptance but not necessarily approval or agreement, recognizing that ambivalence about change is normal.\n\nConsider ethnic and cultural differences when expressing empathy through reflective listening. These differences influence how both you and the client interpret verbal and nonverbal communications.\n\nBox\n\nEXPERT COMMENT: EXPRESSING EMPATHY WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN CLIENTS.\n\nBox\n\nEXPERT COMMENT: EXPRESSING EMPATHY WITH AMERICAN INDIAN/NATIVE AMERICAN CLIENTS.\n\nReflective listening is not as easy as it sounds. It is not simply a matter of being quiet while the client is speaking. Reflective listening requires you to make a mental hypothesis about the underlying meaning or feeling of client statements and then reflect that back to the client with your best guess about his or her meaning or feeling (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Gordon (1970) called this “active listening” and identified 12 kinds of responses that people often give to others that are not active listening and can actually derail a conversation.\n\nExhibit 3.5 describes these roadblocks to listening. If you engage in any of these 12 activities, you are talking and not listening. However well intentioned, these roadblocks to listening shift the focus of the conversation from the client to the counselor. They are not consistent with the principles of person-centered counseling.\n\nTypes of reflective listening\n\nIn MI, there are several kinds of reflective listening responses that range from simple (i.e., repeating or rephrasing a client statement) to complex (i.e., using different words to reflect the underlying meaning or feeling of a client statement). Simple refections engage clients and let them know that you're genuinely interested in understanding their perspective. Complex refections invite clients to deepen their self-exploration (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). In MI, there are special complex reflections that you can use in specific counseling situations, like using a double-sided reflection when clients are expressing ambivalence about changing a substance use behavior. Exhibit 3.6 provides examples of simple and complex reflective listening responses to client statements about substance use.\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.6. Types of Reflective Listening Responses.\n\nForming complex refections\n\nSimple reflections are fairly straightforward. You simply repeat or paraphrase what the client said. Complex reflections are more challenging. A statement could have many meanings. The first step in making a complex reflection of meaning or feelings is to make a hypothesis in your mind about what the client is trying to say (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nUse these steps to form a mental hypothesis about meaning or feelings:\n\n1.\n\nIf the client says, “I drink because I am lonely,” think about the possible meanings of “lonely.” Perhaps the client is saying, “I lost my spouse” or “It is hard for me to make friends” or “I can't think of anything to say when I am with my family.”\n\n2.\n\nConsider the larger conversational context. Has the client noted not having much of a social life?\n\n3.\n\nMake your best guess about the meaning of the client's statement.\n\n4.\n\nOffer a reflective listening response—”You drink because it is hard for you to make friends.”\n\n5.\n\nWait for the client's response. The client will tell you either verbally or nonverbally if your guess is correct. If the client continues to talk and expands on the initial statement, you are on target.\n\n6.\n\nBe open to being wrong. If you are, use client feedback to make another hypothesis about the client's meaning.\n\nRemember that reflective listening is about refraining from making assumptions about the underlying message of client statements, making a hypothesis about the meaning or feeling of the statement, and then checking out your hypothesis by offering a reflective statement and listening carefully to the client's response (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Reflective listening is basic to all of four MI processes. Follow open questions with at least one reflective listening response—but preferably two or three responses—before asking another question. A higher ratio of reflections to questions consistently predicts positive client outcomes (Romano & Peters, 2016). It takes practice to become skillful, but the effort is worth it because careful reflective listening builds a strong therapeutic alliance and facilitates the client's self-exploration—two essential components of person-centered counseling (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). The key to expressing accurate empathy through reflective listening is your ability to shift gears from being an expert who gives advice to being an individual supporting the client's autonomy and expertise in making decisions about changing substance use behaviors (Moyers, 2014).\n\nSummarizing\n\nSummarizing is a form of reflective listening that distills the essence of several client statements and reflects them back to him or her. It is not simply a collection of statements. You intentionally select statements that may have particular meaning for the client and present them in a summary that paints a fuller picture of the client's experience than simply using reflections (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nThere are several types of summarization in MI (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nCollecting summary: Recalls a series of related client statements, creating a narrative to reflect on.\n\n•\n\nLinking summary: Reflects a client statement; links it to an earlier statement.\n\n•\n\nTransitional summary: Wraps up a conversation or task; moves the client along the change process.\n\n•\n\nAmbivalence summary: Gathers client statements of sustain talk and change talk during a session. This summary should acknowledge sustain talk but reinforce and highlight change talk.\n\n•\n\nRecapitulation summary: Gathers all of the change talk of many conversations. It is useful during the transition from one stage to the next when making a change plan.\n\nAt the end of a summary, ask the client whether you left anything out. This opportunity lets the client correct or add more to the summary and often leads to further discussion. Summarizing encourages client self-reflection.\n\nSummaries reinforce key statements of movement toward change. Clients hear change talk once when they make a statement, twice when the counselor refects it, and again when the counselor summarizes the discussion.\n\nFocusing\n\nOnce you have engaged the client, the next step in MI is to find a direction for the conversation and the counseling process as a whole. This is called focusing in MI. With the client, you develop a mutually agreed-on agenda that promotes change and then identify a specific target behavior to discuss. Without a clear focus, conversations about change can be unwieldy and unproductive (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nDeciding on an agenda\n\nMI is essentially a conversation you and the client have about change. The direction of the conversation is influenced by the client, the counselor, and the clinical setting (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). For example, a client walking through the door of an outpatient SUD treatment program understand that his or her use of alcohol and other drugs will be on the agenda.\n\nClients, however, may be mandated to treatment and may not see their substance use as a problem, or they may have multiple issues (e.g., child care, relational, financial, legal problems) that interfere with recovery and that need to be addressed. When clients bring multiple problems to the table or are confused or uncertain about the direction of the conversation, you can engage in agenda mapping, which is a process consistent with MI that helps you and clients decide on the counseling focus. Exhibit 3.7 displays the components in an agenda map.\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.7. Components in a Sample Agenda Map.\n\nIdentifying a target behavior\n\nOnce you and the client agree on a general direction, focus on a specific behavior the client is ready to discuss. Change talk links to a specific behavior change target (Miller & Rollnick, 2010); you can't evoke change talk until you identify a target behavior. For example, if the client is ready to discuss drinking, guide the conversation toward details specific to that concern. A sample of such a conversation follows:\n\n•\n\nCounselor: Marla, you said you'd like to talk about your drinking. It would help if you'd give me a sense of what your specific concerns are about drinking. (Open question in the form of a statement)\n\n•\n\nClient: Well, after work I go home to my apartment and I am so tired; I don't want to do anything but watch TV, microwave a meal, and drink till I fall asleep. Then I wake up with a big hangover in the morning and have a hard time getting to work on time. My supervisor has given me a warning.\n\n•\n\nCounselor: You're worried that the amount you drink affects your sleep and ability to get to work on time. (Refection) What do you think you'd like to change about the drinking? (Open question)\n\n•\n\nClient: I think I need to stop drinking completely for a while, so I can get into a healthy sleep pattern.\n\n•\n\nCounselor: So I'd like to put stop drinking for a while on the map, is that okay? [Asks permission. Pauses. Waits for permission.] Let's focus our conversations on that goal.\n\nNotice that this client is already expressing change talk about her alcohol use. By narrowing the focus from drinking as a general concern to stopping drinking as a possible target behavior, the counselor moved into the MI process of evoking.\n\nEvoking\n\nEvoking elicits client motivations for change. It shapes conversations in ways that encourage clients, not counselors, to argue for change. Evoking is the core of MI and differentiates it from other counseling methods (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). The following sections explore evoking change talk, responding to change talk and sustain talk, developing discrepancy, evoking hope and confidence to support self-efficacy, recognizing signs of readiness to change, and asking key questions.\n\nEvoking change talk\n\nEngaging the client in the process of change is the fundamental task of MI. Rather than identifying the problem and promoting ways to solve it, your task is to help clients recognize that their use of substances may be contributing to their distress and that they have a choice about how to move forward in life in ways that enhance their health and well-being. One signal that clients' ambivalence about change is decreasing is when they start to express change talk.\n\nThe first step to evoking change talk is to ask open questions. There are seven kinds of change talk, refected in the DARN acronym. DARN questions can help you generate open questions that evoke change talk. Exhibit 3.8 provides examples of open questions that elicit change talk in preparation for taking steps to change.\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.8. Examples of Open Questions to Evoke Change Talk Using DARN.\n\nOther strategies for evoking change talk (Miller & Rollnick, 2013) include:\n\n•\n\nEliciting importance of change. Ask an open question that elicits “Need” change talk (Exhibit 3.8): “How important is it for you to [name the change in the target behavior, such as cutting back on drinking]?” You can also use scaling questions such as those in the Importance Ruler in Exhibit 3.9 to help the client explore change talk about need more fully.\n\n•\n\nExploring extremes. Ask the client to identify the extremes of the problem; this enhances his or her motivation. For example: “What concerns you the most about [name the target behavior, like using cocaine]?”\n\n•\n\nLooking back. To point out discrepancies and evoke change talk, ask the client about what it was like before experiencing substance use problems, and compare that response with what it is like now. For example: “What was it like before you started using heroin?”\n\n•\n\nLooking forward. Ask the client to envision what he or she would like for the future. This can elicit change talk and identify goals to work toward. For example: “If you decided to [describe the change in target behavior, such as quit smoking], how do you think your life would be different a month, a year, or 5 years from now?”\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.9. The Importance Ruler.\n\nReinforce change talk by reflecting it back verbally, nodding, or making approving facial expressions and affirming statements. Encourage the client to continue exploring the possibility of change by asking for elaboration, explicit examples, or details about remaining concerns. Questions that begin with “What else” effectively invite elaboration.\n\nYour task is to evoke change talk and selectively reinforce it via reflective listening. The amount of change talk versus sustain talk is linked to client behavior change and positive substance use outcomes (Houck et al., 2018; Lindqvist et al., 2017; Magill et al., 2014).\n\nResponding to change talk and sustain talk\n\nYour focus should be on evoking change talk and minimizing sustain talk. Sustain talk expresses the side of ambivalence that favors continuing one's pattern of substance use. Don't argue with the client's sustain talk, and don't try to persuade the client to take the change side of ambivalence.\n\nThere are many ways to respond to sustain talk that acknowledge it without getting stuck in it. You can use (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nSimple refections. Acknowledge sustain talk with a simple reflective listening response. This validates what the client has said and sometimes elicits change talk. Give the client an opportunity to respond before moving on.\n\n-\n\nClient: I don't plan to quit drinking anytime soon.\n\n-\n\nCounselor: You don't think that abstinence would work for you right now.\n\n•\n\nAmplified refections. Accurately reflect the client's statement but with emphasis (and without sarcasm). An amplified reflection overstates the client's point of view, which can nudge the client to take the other side of ambivalence (i.e., change talk).\n\n-\n\nClient: But I can't quit smoking pot. All my friends smoke pot.\n\n-\n\nCounselor: So you really can't quit because you'd be too different from your friends.\n\n•\n\nDouble-sided refections. A double-sided reflection acknowledges sustain talk, then pairs it with change talk either in the same client statement or in a previous statement. It acknowledges the client's ambivalence yet selectively reinforces change talk. Use “and” to join the two statements and make change talk the second statement (see Counselor Response in Exhibit 3.6).\n\n-\n\nClient: I know I should quit smoking now that I am pregnant. But I tried to go cold turkey before, and it was just too hard.\n\n-\n\nCounselor: You're worried that you won't be able to quit all at once, and you want your baby to be born healthy.\n\n•\n\nAgreements with a twist. A subtle strategy is to agree, but with a slight twist or change of direction that moves the discussion forward. The twist should be said without emphasis or sarcasm.\n\n-\n\nClient: I can't imagine what I would do if I stopped drinking. It's part of who I am. How could I go to the bar and hang out with my friends?\n\n-\n\nCounselor: You just wouldn't be you without drinking. You have to keep drinking no matter how it effects your health.\n\n•\n\nReframing. Reframing acknowledges the client's experience yet suggests alternative meanings. It invites the client to consider a different perspective (Barnett, Spruijt-Metz, et al., 2014). Reframing is also a way to refocus the conversation from emphasizing sustain talk to eliciting change talk (Barnett, Spruijt-Metz, et al., 2014).\n\n-\n\nClient: My husband always nags me about my drinking and calls me an alcoholic. It bugs me.\n\n-\n\nCounselor: Although your husband expresses it in a way that frustrates you, he really cares and is concerned about the drinking.\n\n•\n\nA shift in focus. Defuse discord and tension by shifting the conversational focus.\n\n-\n\nClient: The way you're talking, you think I'm an alcoholic, don't you?\n\n-\n\nCounselor: Labels aren't important to me. What I care about is how to best help you.\n\n•\n\nEmphasis on personal autonomy. Emphasizing that people have choices (even if all the choices have a downside) reinforces personal autonomy and opens up the possibility for clients to choose change instead of the status quo. When you make these statements, remember to use a neutral, nonjudgmental tone, without sarcasm. A dismissive tone can evoke strong reactions from the client.\n\n-\n\nClient: I am really not interested in giving up drinking completely.\n\n-\n\nCounselor: It's really up to you. No one can make that decision for you.\n\nAll of these strategies have one thing in common: They are delivered in the spirit of MI.\n\nDeveloping discrepancy: A values conversation\n\nDeveloping discrepancy has been a key element of MI since its inception. It was originally one of the four principles of MI. In the current version, exploring the discrepancy between clients' values and their substance use behavior has been folded into the evoking process. When clients recognize discrepancies in their values, goals, and hopes for the future, their motivation to change increases.\n\nYour task is to help clients focus on how their behavior conflicts with their values and goals.\n\nThe focus is on intrinsic motivation. MI doesn't work if you focus only on how clients' substance use behavior is in conflict with external pressure (e.g., family, an employer, the court) (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nTo facilitate discrepancy, have a values conversation to explore what is important to the client (e.g., good heath, positive relationships with family, being a responsible member of the community, preventing another hospitalization, staying out of jail), then highlight the conflict the client feels between his or her substance use behaviors and those values. Client experience of discrepancy between values and substance use behavior is related to better client outcomes (Apodaca & Longabaugh, 2009).\n\nThis process can raise uncomfortable feelings like guilt or shame. Frame the conversation by conveying acceptance, compassion, and affirmation. The paradox of acceptance is that it helps people tolerate more discrepancy and, instead of avoiding that tension, propels them toward change (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). However, too much discrepancy may overwhelm the client and cause him or her to think change is not possible (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nTo help a client perceive discrepancy, you can use what is sometimes termed the “Columbo approach.” Initially developed by Kanfer & Schefft (1988), this approach remains a staple of MI and is particularly useful with a client who is in the Precontemplation stage and needs to be in charge of the conversation. Essentially, the counselor expresses understanding and continuously seeks clarification of the client's problem but appears unable to perceive any solution.\n\nBox\n\nEXPERT COMMENT: THE COLUMBO APPROACH.\n\nIn addition to providing personalized feedback (as discussed in Chapter 2), you can facilitate discrepancy by (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nIdentifying personal values. For clients to feel discrepancy between their values and actions, they need to recognize what those values are. Some clients may have only a vague understanding of their values or goals. A tool to help you and clients explore values is the Values Card Sort.\n\n-\n\nPrint different values like “Achievement—to have important accomplishments” (Miller & Rollnick, 2013, p. 80) on individual cards.\n\n-\n\nInvite clients to sort the cards into piles by importance; those that are most important are place in one pile, and those that are least important are in another pile.\n\n-\n\nAsk clients to pick up to 10 cards from the most important pile; converse about each one.\n\n-\n\nUse OARS to facilitate the conversations.\n\n-\n\nPay attention to statements about discrepancy between these important values and clients' substance use behaviors, and reinforce these statements.\n\n-\n\nA downloadable, public domain version of the Value Card Sort activity is available online (www ​.motivationalinterviewing ​.org/sites/default ​/files/valuescardsort0.pdf).\n\n•\n\nProviding information. Avoid being the expert and treating clients as passive recipients when giving information about the negative physical, emotional, mental, social, or spiritual effects or consequences of substance misuse. Instead, engage the client in a process of mutual exchange. This process is called Elicit-Provide-Elicit (EPE) and has three steps (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n-\n\nElicit readiness or interest in the information. Don't assume that clients are interested in hearing the information you want to offer; start by asking permission. For example: “Would it be okay if I shared some information with you about the health risks of using heroin?” Don't assume that clients lack this knowledge. Ask what they already know about the risks of using heroin. For example: “What would you most like to know about the health risks of heroin use?”\n\n-\n\nProvide information neutrally (i.e., without judgement). Prioritize what clients have said they would most like to know. Fill in knowledge gaps. Present the information clearly and in small chunks. Too much information can overwhelm clients. Invite them to ask more questions about the information you're providing.\n\n-\n\nElicit clients' understanding of the information. Don't assume that you know how clients will react to the information you have provided. Ask questions:\n\n•\n\n“So, what do you make of this information?”\n\n•\n\n“What do you think about that?”\n\n•\n\n“How does this information impact the way you might be thinking about [name the substance use behavior, such as drinking]?”\n\n-\n\nAllow clients plenty of time to consider and reflect on the information you presented. Invite them to ask questions for clarification. Follow clients' responses to your open questions with reflective listening statements that emphasize change talk whenever you hear it. EPE is an MI strategy to facilitate identifying discrepancy and is an effective and respectful way to give advice to clients about behavior change strategies during the planning process.\n\n•\n\nExploring others' concerns. Another way to build discrepancy is to explore the clients' understanding of the concerns other people have expressed about their substance use. This differs from focusing on the external pressure that a family member, an employer, or the criminal justice system may be putting on clients to reduce or abstain from substance use. The purpose is to invite clients to explore the impact of substance use behaviors on the people with whom they are emotionally connected in a nonthreatening way. Approach this conversation from a place of genuine curiosity and even a bit of confusion (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Here is a brief example of what this conversation might look like using an open question about a significant other's concern, where reflecting sustain talk actually has the effect of eliciting change talk:\n\n-\n\nCounselor: You mentioned that your husband is concerned about your drinking. What do you think concerns him? (Open question)\n\n-\n\nClient: He worries about everything. The other day, he got really upset because I drove a block home from a friend's house after a party. He shouldn't worry so much. (Sustain talk)\n\n-\n\nCounselor: He's worried that you could crash and hurt yourself or someone else or get arrested for driving under the influence. But you think his concern is overblown. (Complex refection)\n\n-\n\nClient: I can see he may have a point. I really shouldn't drive after drinking. (Change talk)\n\nEvoking hope and confidence to support self-efficacy\n\nMany clients do not have a well-developed sense of self-efficacy. They find it hard to believe that they can begin or maintain behavior change. Improving self-efficacy requires eliciting confidence, hope, and optimism that change, in general, is possible and that clients, specifically, can change. This positive impact on self-efficacy may be one of the ways MI promotes behavior change (Chariyeva et al., 2013).\n\nOne of the most consistent predictors of positive client behavior change is “ability” change talk (Romano & Peters, 2016). Unless a client believes change is possible, the perceived discrepancy between desire for change and feelings of hopelessness about accomplishing change is likely to result in continued sustain talk and no change. When clients express confidence in their ability to change, they are more likely to engage in behavior change (Romano & Peters, 2016).\n\nBox\n\nCOUNSELOR NOTE: SELF EFFICACY.\n\nBecause self-efficacy is a critical component of behavior change, it is crucial that you also believe in clients' capacity to reach their goals. You can help clients strengthen hope and confidence in MI by evoking confidence talk. Here are two strategies for evoking confidence talk (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nUse the Confidence Ruler (Exhibit 3.10) and scaling questions to assess clients' confidence level and evoke confidence talk.\n\n•\n\nAsk open questions that evoke client strengths and abilities. Follow the open questions with reflective listening responses. Here are some examples of open questions that elicit confidence talk:\n\n-\n\n“Knowing yourself as well as you do, how do you think you could [name the target behavior change, like cutting back on smoking marijuana]?”\n\n-\n\n“How have you made difficult changes in the past?”\n\n-\n\n“How could you apply what you learned then to this situation?”\n\n-\n\n“What gives you confidence that you could [name the target behavior change, like stopping cocaine use]?”\n\nBox\n\nEXHIBIT 3.10. The Confidence Ruler.\n\nIn addition, you can help enhance clients' hope and confidence about change by:\n\n•\n\nExploring clients' strengths and brainstorming how to apply those strengths to the current situation.\n\n•\n\nGiving information via EPE about the efficacy of treatment to increase clients' sense of self-efficacy.\n\n•\n\nDiscussing what worked and didn't work in previous treatment episodes and offering change options based on what worked before.\n\n•\n\nDescribing how people in similar situations have successfully changed their behavior. Other clients in treatment can serve as role models and offer encouragement.\n\n•\n\nOffering some cognitive tools, like the AA slogan “One day at a time” or “Keep it simple” to break down an overwhelming task into smaller changes that may be more manageable.\n\n•\n\nEducating clients about the biology of addiction and the medical effects of substance use to alleviate shame and instill hope that recovery is possible.\n\nEngaging, focusing, and evoking set the stage for mobilizing action to change. During these MI processes, your task is to evoke DARN change talk. This moves the client along toward taking action to change substance use behaviors. At this point, your task is to evoke and respond to CAT change talk.\n\nRecognizing signs of readiness to change\n\nAs you evoke and respond to DARN change talk, you will begin to observe these signs of readiness to change in the client's statements (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nIncreased change talk: As DARN change talk increases, commitment and activation change talk begin to be expressed. The client may show optimism about change and an intention to change.\n\n•\n\nDecreased sustain talk: As change talk increases, sustain talk decreases. When change talk overtakes sustain talk, it is a sign that the client is moving toward change.\n\n•\n\nResolve: The client seems more relaxed. The client talks less about the problem, and sometimes expresses a sense of resolution.\n\n•\n\nQuestions about change: The client asks what to do about the problem, how people change if they want to, and so forth. For example: “What do people do to get off pain pills?”\n\n•\n\nEnvisioning: The client begins to talk about life after a change, anticipate difficulties, or discuss the advantages of change. Envisioning requires imagining something different—not necessarily how to get to that something different, but simply imagining how things could be different.\n\n•\n\nTaking steps: The client begins to experiment with small steps toward change (e.g., going to an AA meeting, going without drinking for a few days, reading a self-help book). Affirming small change steps helps the client build self-efficacy and confidence.\n\nWhen you notice these signs of readiness to change, it is a good time to offer the client a recapitulation summary in which you restate his or her change talk and minimize reflections of sustain talk. The recapitulation summary is a good way to transition into asking key questions (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nAsking key questions\n\nTo help a client move from preparing to mobilizing for change, ask key questions (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\n“What do you think you will do about your drinking?”\n\n•\n\n“After reviewing the situation, what's the next step for you?”\n\n•\n\n“What do you want to do about your drug use?”\n\n•\n\n“What can you do about your smoking?”\n\n•\n\n“Where do you go from here?”\n\n•\n\n“What you might do next?”\n\nWhen the client responds with change talk (e.g., “I intend to stop using heroin”), you can move forward to the planning process. If the client responds with sustain talk (e.g., “It would be too hard for me to quit using heroin right now”), you should go back to the evoking process. Remember that change is not a linear process for most people.\n\nDo not jump into the planning process if the client expresses enough sustain talk to indicate not being ready to take the next step. The ambivalence about taking the next step may be uncertainty about giving up the substance use behavior or a lack of confidence about being able to make the change.\n\nPlanning\n\nYour task in the process is to help the client develop a change plan that is acceptable, accessible, and appropriate. Once a client decides to change a substance use behavior, he or she may already have ideas about how to make that change. For example, a client may have previously stopped smoking cannabis and already knows what worked in the past. Your task is to simply reinforce the client's plan.\n\nDon't assume that all clients need a structured method to develop a change plan. Many people can make significant lifestyle changes and initiate recovery from SUDs without formal assistance (Kelly, Bergman, Hoeppner, Vilsaint, & White, 2017). For clients who need help developing a change plan, remember to continue using MI techniques and OARS to move the process from why change and what to change to how to change (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). A change plan is like a treatment plan but broader (e.g., going to an addiction treatment program may be part of a change plan), and the client, rather than you or the treatment program, is the driver of the planning process (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nIdentifying a change goal\n\nPart of planning is working with the client to identify or clarify a change goal. At this point, the client may have identified a change goal. For example, when you ask a key question such as “What do you want to do about the drinking?” the client might say, “I want to cut back to two drinks a day on weekends.” In this situation, the focus shifts to developing a plan with specific steps the client might take to reach the change goal. If the client is vague about a change goal and says, “I really need to do something about my drinking,” the first step is to help the client clarify the change goal.\n\nHere is an example of a dialog that helps the client get more specific:\n\n•\n\nCounselor: You are committed to making some changes to your drinking. (Refection) What would that look like? (Open question)\n\n•\n\nClient: Well, I tried to cut back to one drink a day, but all I could think about was going to the bar and getting drunk. I cut back for 2 days but did end up back at the bar, and then it just got worse from there. At this point, I don't think I can just cut back.\n\n•\n\nCounselor: You made a good-faith effort to control the drinking and learned a lot from that experiment. (Affirmation) You now think that cutting back is probably not a good strategy for you. (Refection)\n\n•\n\nClient: Yeah. It's time to quit. But I'm not sure I can do that on my own.\n\n•\n\nCounselor: You're ready to quit drinking completely and realize that you could use some help with making that kind of change. (Refection)\n\n•\n\nClient: Yeah. It's time to give it up.\n\n•\n\nCounselor: Let's review the conversation, (Summarization) and then talk about next steps.\n\nThe counselor uses OARS to help the client clarify the change goal. The counselor also hears that the client lacks confidence that he or she can achieve the change goal and reinforces the client's desire for some help in making the change. The next step with this client is to develop a change plan.\n\nDeveloping a change plan\n\nBegin with the change goal identified by the client; then, explore specific steps the client can take to achieve it. In the planning process, use OARS and pay attention to CAT change talk. As you proceed, carefully note the shift from change talk that is more general to change talk that is specific to the change plan (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). (See Chapter 6 for information on a developing a change plan.) Some evidence shows that change talk is related to the completion of a change plan (Romano & Peters, 2016).\n\nHere are some strategies for helping clients develop a change plan (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nConfirm the change goal. Make sure that you and the client agree on what substance use behavior the client wants to change and what the ultimate goal is (i.e., to cut back or to abstain). This goal might change as the client takes steps to achieve it. For example, a client who tries to cut back on cannabis use may find that that it is not a workable plan and may decide to abstain completely.\n\n•\n\nElicit the client's ideas about how to change. There may be many different pathways to achieve the desired goal. For example, a client whose goal is to stop drinking may go to AA or SMART Recovery meetings for support, get a prescription for naltrexone (a medication that reduces craving and the pleasurable effects of alcohol [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration & National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2015]) from a primary care provider, enter an intensive outpatient treatment program, or try some combination of these. Before you jump in with your ideas, elicit the client's ideas about strategies to make the change. Explore pros and cons of the client's ideas; determine which appeals to the client most and is most appropriate for this client.\n\n•\n\nOffer a menu of options. Use the EPE process (see the section “Developing discrepancy: A values conversation” above) to ask permission to offer suggestions about accessible treatment options, provide information about those options, and elicit the client's understanding of options and which ones seem acceptable.\n\n•\n\nSummarize the change plan. Once you and the client have a clear plan, summarize the plan and the specific steps or pathways the client has identified. Listen for CAT change talk, and reinforce it through reflective listening.\n\n•\n\nExplore obstacles. Once the client applies the change plan to his or her life, there will inevitably be setbacks. Try to anticipate potential obstacles and how the client might respond to them before the client takes steps to implement the plan. Then reevaluate the change plan, and help the client tweak it using the information about what did and didn't work from prior attempts.\n\nStrengthening Commitment to Change\n\nThe planning process is just the beginning of change. Clients must commit to the plan and show that commitment by taking action. There is some evidence that client commitment change talk is associated with positive AUD outcomes (Romano & Peters, 2016). One study found that counselor efforts to elicit client commitment to change alcohol use is associated with reduced alcohol consumption and increased abstinence for clients in outpatient treatment (Magill, Stout, & Apodoaca, 2013).\n\nUsually, people express an intention to make a change before they make a firm commitment to taking action. You can evoke the client's intention to take action by asking open questions: “What are you willing to do this week?” or “What specific steps of the change plan are you ready to take?” (Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Remember that the client may have an end goal (e.g., to quit drinking) and intermediate action steps to achieving that goal (e.g., filling a naltrexone prescription, going to an AA meeting).\n\nOnce the client has expressed an intention to change, elicit commitment change talk. Try asking an open question that invites the client to explore his or her commitment more clearly: “What would help you strengthen your commitment to ________________ [name the step or ultimate goal for change, for example, getting that prescription from your doctor for naltrexone]?” (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\nOther strategies to strengthen commitment to action steps and change goals include (Miller & Rollnick, 2013):\n\n•\n\nExploring any ambivalence clients have about change goals or specific elements of change plans.\n\n•\n\nReinforcing CAT change talk through reflective listening.\n\n•\n\nInviting clients to state their commitment to their significant others.\n\n•\n\nAsking clients to self-monitor by recording progress toward change goals (e.g., with a drinking log).\n\n•\n\nExploring, with clients' consent, whether supportive significant others can help with medication adherence or other activities that reinforce commitment (e.g., getting to AA meetings).\n\nThe change plan process lends itself to using other counseling methods like CBT and MET. For example, you can encourage clients to monitor their thoughts and feelings in high-risk situations where they are more likely to return to substance use or misuse. Chapter 7 provides more information on relapse prevention. No matter what counseling strategies you use, keep to the spirit of MI by working with clients and honoring and respecting their right to and capacity for self-direction."
