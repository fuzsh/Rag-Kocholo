        "text": "Fold mountains are created where two or more of EarthâsÂ tectonic plates are pushed together. At these colliding, compressing boundaries, rocks and debris areÂ warped and folded into rocky outcrops,Â hills, mountains, and entireÂ mountain ranges.\n\nFold mountains are created through a process calledÂ orogeny. AnÂ orogenic eventÂ takes millions of years to create a fold mountain , but you canÂ mimicÂ it in seconds. Cover a table with a tablecloth, or place a rug flat on the floor. Now push the edge of the tablecloth or rugâwrinkles will develop and fold on top of each other.\n\nThe vocabulary of fold mountains owes something to this simple tablecloth experiment. Some of the key structures in fold mountains are nappes.Â Nappes are common, dramatic folded rocks or rock formations. â Nappe â is French for âtableclothâ and it is believed the formations were named after the tabletop experiment.\n\nThe huge difference between the rock folds and cloth folds is that in the tabletop experiment, the table itself does not fold. In the creation of fold mountains , EarthâsÂ crustÂ itself is warped into folded forms.\n\nFold mountains are often associated withÂ continental crust. They are created at convergent plate boundaries, sometimes called continental collision zones or compression zones. Convergent plate boundaries are sites ofÂ collisions , where tectonic plates crash into each other.Â Compression describes a set ofÂ stresses directed at one point in a rock or rock formation.\n\nAt a compression zone, tectonic activity forces crustal compression at the leading edge of the crust formation. For this reason, most fold mountains are found on the edge or former edge of continental plate boundaries. Rocks on the edge of continental crust are often weaker and less stable than rocks found in the continental interior. This can make them moreÂ susceptibleÂ to folding and warping . Most fold mountains are composed primarily ofÂ sedimentary rockÂ andÂ metamorphic rockÂ formed under high pressure and relatively low temperatures. Many fold mountains are also formed where an underlying layer ofÂ ductileÂ minerals, such as salt, is present.\n\nYoung and Old, High and Low\n\nFold mountains are the most common type of mountain in the world. TheÂ rugged, soaring heights of the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps are all active fold mountains .\n\nThe Himalayas stretch through theÂ borders of China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The crust beneath the Himalaya, the most towering mountain range on Earth, is still the process of being compressed . Here, the Indian plate is colliding northward with the Eurasian plate. The sedimentary rocks of the Himalayas include shale and limestone. Metamorphic rocks of the region include schist and gneiss.Â Dikes of igneous rock also intrude throughout the rock formations of the Himalayas.\n\nThe Andes are the worldâs longest mountain chain. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America, from Colombia in the north and through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina to the south. Here, theÂ dense oceanic crustÂ of the Nazca plate isÂ subducting beneath the less- dense continental crust of the South American plate. The Andes are mostly being folded and uplifted from the thicker, less- dense rocks of the South American plate. The sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the Andes are dotted by active and dormantÂ volcanoes.\n\nThe Alps roughly mark the top of the âbootâ of the Italian Peninsula. The Alps stretch across Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, and France. Here, the tiny Adriatic microplate is colliding with the much larger Eurasian plate to the north. The J-shaped Adriatic microplate is aÂ remnantÂ of the African plate to the south, and today it carries the eastern Italian Peninsula as well as the entire Adriatic Sea. AlpineÂ geologyÂ includes sedimentary and metamorphic rock , as well asÂ igneous rocks that once were part of the ocean floor and were later uplifted in the process of folding.\n\nNot all fold mountains are soaring peaks. The Appalachians, stretching along North Americaâs east coast, are generally low-lying, gentleÂ slopes. Millions of years ago, the Appalachians were taller than the Himalayas! Millions of years ofÂ erosion, however, have taken their toll. Today, some of the highest peaks of the Appalachians are less than a third of the height of Everest.\n\nThe crust that is now the Appalachians began folding over 300 million years ago, when the North American and African continental plates collided. Plate tectonics created this ancient mountain range , then called the Central Pangean Mountains . . . and plate tectonics tore it apart. As tectonic activity ripped apart the ancient Â supercontinent Pangea , the African, Eurasian, and North American plates drifted apart.\n\nThe Appalachians are just one remnant of the Central Pangean Mountains . The Appalachians stretch from the province of Newfoundland, in southeastern Canada, through the southern state of Alabama in the United States. They are related to the gentle fold mountains of the Scottish Highlands (Eurasia) and the Little Atlas Mountains in Morocco (Africa)âtheir orogenic sisters from the Central Pangean Mountains .\n\nTypes of Folds\n\nFold mountains are defined byÂ complex,Â vitalÂ geologic forms known as folds. There are many, many different types of folds.Â Geologists primarilyÂ categorizeÂ folds by their shapeâdo they have sharp turns or gentle curves? Are the foldsÂ convexÂ orÂ concave?\n\nA fold mountain usually displays more than one type of fold. Anticlines and synclines are the most common up-and-down folds that result from compression . AnÂ anticline Â has a â©-shape, with the oldest rocks in the center of the fold. AÂ syncline Â is a U-shape, with the youngest rocks in the center of the fold.\n\nDomes and basins are often considered types of folds. AÂ dome Â is a series ofÂ symmetricalÂ anticlines , roughly shaped like half aÂ sphere. Like an anticline , the oldest rocks in a dome are found in the center. AÂ basin Â is a depression, or dip, in Earthâs surface. Like a syncline , a basin has its youngest rocks in its center.\n\nOther types of folds include:"
