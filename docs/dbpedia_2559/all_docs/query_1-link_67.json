        "text": "Okay, so 30 seconds long doesn’t really translate well into a text based forecast, but our weather could be summarized in just a few words. I get paid by the word though, so... Heat remains the main story across Central Texas as high temperatures continue to slowly warm up as high pressure gradually builds and moves into the Central and Southern Plains. Temperatures over the course of the next few days will be the hottest they’ve been all year long and we are expected to break our streak of double-digit high temperatures as early as today and assuredly tomorrow. We haven’t seen a triple-digit high temperature since July 2nd, but highs today should settle right around if not a little above or a little below 100°. High pressure is expected to settle over the Plains for the next few days, but it may not be quite as strong as previously forecast. As a result, I’ve dropped high temperatures about a degree for the rest of the week. Highs near 100° warm to near 102° Wednesday, 103° Thursday and Friday, and then may dip down closer to 100° this weekend. The stagnant airmass with calm winds may make it feel like an oven outside, but a lack of humidity should keep the heat index values within about 5° of the actual temperatures.\n\nIn addition to not seeing a triple-digit high in over a month, we also have not seen much of any rain either this summer. We’ve only accumulated 2.69″ of rain since June 1st and we’re running a 2.74″ deficit summer-to-date. Although we’re around 5″ of rain away from reaching our average yearly rainfall, we’d really like to make up the summertime deficit. That, however, is not in the cards as we have no rain chances in the forecast right now. As we move into the weekend, we may add a 10% chance as a stray sprinkle or two could maybe pop up. Don’t hold your breath, y’all.\n\nAs I’m racking up the cents with the couple hundred words in the forecast discussion, I do want to turn your attention to the tropics. The big story right now is Tropical Storm Debby which has started to and will continue to drench Georgia, and especially the Carolinas. Debby is crawling, only moving around 180 miles in an 18 hour timespan from yesterday afternoon to this morning. The slow meandering motion and persistent onshore flow to the Southeast coast is akin to what Texas saw in 2017 with Hurricane Harvey. The wind speeds aren’t the big story but it’s the plethora of rain. A foot of rain has already fallen across parts of Georgia and South Carolina and another 10″ to 15″ could fall in the Carolinas over the next 3 days before Debby finally pulls away from the Carolinas this weekend. Although we’re getting into the most active time period of the year in the tropics, things are mostly quiet. There is a disorganized area of showers and storms in the eastern Caribbean Sea, but there’s only a 30% chance this develops into a tropical depression or tropical storm as it moves toward and eventually through the Yucatan Peninsula. Yes, this wave may be taking a path very similar to Hurricane Beryl, but atmospheric conditions are not ripe for this storm to strengthen quickly and it may potentially never reach tropical depression status. Furthermore, it does not look like this tropical wave will get anywhere close to Central Texas and may not even get close to South Texas either. We’ll keep an eye on things just in case the atmosphere throws a curveball toward Texas early next week.\n\nCopyright 2024 KWTX. All rights reserved."
