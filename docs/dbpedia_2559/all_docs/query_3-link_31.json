        "text": "1821\n\nAfter many years of lobbying from the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons, the Pennsylvania Legislature approves funding to build the Eastern State Penitentiary. The new prison will hold 250 people.\n\nFour architects submit designs for the massive new prison. John Haviland, a British architect who had settled in Philadelphia, wins the commission. He receives a $100 prize for his design.\n\nRival architect William Strickland, whose design had been rejected, is chosen to oversee the construction.\n\n1829 April 23\n\nLegislation specifying \"separate or solitary confinement at labor\" is passed.\n\nMany leaders believe that crime is the result of environment, and that solitude will make the person convicted of a crime regretful and penitent (hence the new word, penitentiary). This correctional theory, as practiced in Philadelphia, will become known as the Pennsylvania System.\n\nPlans are finalized to prohibit all contact between people incarcerated at Eastern State, the world's most ambitious penitentiary, now nearly ready to receive its first prisoners.\n\nMasks are fabricated to keep the prisoners from communicating during rare trips outside their cells. Cells are equipped with feed doors and individual exercise yards to prevent contact between prisoners, and minimize contact between prisoners and guards.\n\n1831\n\nWork is completed on Cellblock Three, the last of the original single-story cellblocks. Work begins on Cellblocks Four, Five, Six and Seven, all two stories to accommodate the increasing number of people incarcerated at Eastern State. Cellblock Seven completed in 1835.\n\nEastern State receives its first female prisoner.\n\nFrench Commissioners Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville visit to study the new correctional system.\n\n1836\n\nThe original prison is completed under the supervision of its architect, John Haviland. Covering an area of eleven acres, with state-of-the-art plumbing, sewage systems, and 450 centrally-heated cells, Eastern State Penitentiary is an architectural marvel.\n\nGovernments throughout the world model prisons after Eastern State. Tourists travel by horse and buggy from Philadelphia, more than a mile away, to see the building.\n\nSamuel Cowperthwaite, (No. 2954) created a lithograph in 1855 depicting the building from above, showing Philadelphia has not yet grown to reach the penitentiary.\n\nEastern State Penitentiary has cost nearly $780,000, one of the most expensive buildings of its day in the United States.\n\n1911\n\nCompleted in 1911, Cellblock 12, wedged between Cellblocks 6 and 7, is drastically different from the blocks that preceded it. Built of light colored reinforced concrete, this block consists of three floors with 40 cells each. There are no arched ceilings and, instead of sky lights, each cell has a narrow window.\n\n1923\n\nFemale prisoners are removed to a new prison at Muncy.\n\nIn July, Leo Callahan (C-566) and five accomplices armed with pistols successfully scale the east wall after holding up a group of unarmed guards. More than one hundred people escaped from Eastern State during its 142 years of active use. Callahan is one of just four people who escaped and remained permanently at large. All of Callahan’s accomplices were apprehended, including one that made it as far as Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n1924 August 12\n\nPennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot \"sentences\" Pep \"The Cat-Murdering Dog\" to life at Eastern State. Pep allegedly murdered the governor’s wife’s cherished cat. Prison records reflect that Pep was assigned an prisoner number (C-2559), which is seen in his mug shot. However, the reason for Pep’s incarceration remains a subject of some debate. A newspaper article reported that the governor donated his own dog to the prison to increase morale.\n\n1929 - 1930\n\nChicago gangster Al Capone spends eight months at Eastern State Penitentiary.\n\nAn article in the Philadelphia Public Ledger, August 20, 1929, describes Capone's cell: \"The whole room was suffused in the glow of a desk lamp which stood on a polished desk.... On the once-grim walls of the penal chamber hung tasteful paintings, and the strains of a waltz were being emitted by a powerful cabinet radio receiver of handsome design and fine finish...\"\n\n1945\n\nTwelve men escape through a tunnel that emerges at Fairmount Avenue and 22nd Street. Prison plaster worker Clarence Klinedinst designed and built most of the tunnel. At the time of the escape Klinedinst had only two years left to serve. Most of the men are caught within minutes.\n\nKlinedinst is out for two hours, and has ten years added to his sentence for the prison break. Bank robber Willie Sutton takes credit for planning the tunnel.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Legislature recommends abandoning Eastern State Penitentiary.\n\n1991\n\nWith generous funding from The Pew Charitable Trusts, stabilization and preservation efforts begin.\n\nThe first Halloween fundraiser takes place on Halloween night to raise money to create a daytime tour program. A few hundred people attended that first year. Since then, a Halloween fundraiser, once Terror Behind the Walls and now Halloween Nights at Eastern State Penitentiary, has been held at the penitentiary each fall.\n\n1996\n\nWith funding from the William Penn Foundation, permanent museum exhibits are constructed and a marketing campaign begins. An on-site art exhibition, Prison Sentences, receives international attention. The site is featured in The New York Times, Art in America and on the BBC, C-SPAN and PBS. Attendance nearly doubles.\n\nEastern State’s arched cellblocks and central rotunda are transformed into a mental institution in the movie 12 Monkeys, with Bruce Willis."
