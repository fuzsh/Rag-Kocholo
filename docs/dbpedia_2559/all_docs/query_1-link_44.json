Now it is time for me — and probably for Snoop Dogg, too — to pass that torch along.\n\nThe other day I tried to lift bags of groceries into my trunk, a chore I have done for, oh, seven decades. Now my hip flexors shriek while back muscles add their ill-spirited chorus. From nowhere, a young man appeared to load my bags of potting soil. He was not a store employee — just a guy who could share a minute of his time. I nearly blubbered. He was nonplussed with my overwhelming gratitude and shyly said, “It’s just my nature, ma’am.” Then he escaped, probably afraid I’d try to adopt him.\n\nSis, recovering nicely from a heart procedure, was watering the bushes. Our renter leapt out of the house like a gazelle and snatched the hose away. I mean permanently; he now does all the watering. I am trying to figure out how to get him to do all the vacuuming, too (please send your ideas to myerslindab@gmail.com).\n\nThe thing is that I didn’t know I was starting to project need. I’m now aware how often I betray myself with a bit of a limp, a groan when standing up, a sag to a shoulder. But people are watching. They seem to care even though I am not wearing a “Be Kind” button and may attack like a rabid dog.\n\nI’ve started to keep an eye out for the people keeping an eye out for me. They’re as easy to spot as the deer in your yard these days. I have two friends (Beth and Dmitri) each of whom now invades my territorial imperative. Both walk closer than they did. I figure they fear I will step off a curb and perform a gymnastic routine that Simone Biles has yet to try.\n\nNeighbor Christie leaves a jar of her home-raised berries on our doorstep to find when we enter or leave the house. She doesn’t knock, knowing it means Sis or I need to battle down the stairs past two crazed dogs.\n\nI’ve always been the driver, and now some folks ask if I would like a ride; is my driving ability terrifying Clallam County? Should I perhaps have an eye test?\n\nYes, humans can be a nasty ball of snakes. Just watch the news. Or go to a sporting event. But time and time again, I am amazed how often, when they say you are in their thoughts, you actually are."
