In Michigan, we prayed for his release and never forgot him as he was held by Putin’s corrupt government on bogus charges. I am thankful he will soon be reunited with his family,” said Congressman John Moolenaar.\n\nIssues:Foreign Affairs\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\n“There were massive security failures which allowed for the failed attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump, the murder of firefighter Corey Comperatore, and the shooting of two other victims. This bipartisan task force will get answers about what happened and demand accountability for these failures to help ensure they never happen again,” said Moolenaar.\n\nIssues:Accountability\n\nServices\n\nContact Us\n\nYour feedback is very important to me.
