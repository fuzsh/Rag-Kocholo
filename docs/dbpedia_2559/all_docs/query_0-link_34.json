SHORT TITLE. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015''. (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1)(A) Senator Carl Levin of Michigan was elected a member of the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term beginning January 3, 1979. He has served continuously in the Senate since that date, and was appointed as a member of the Committee on Armed Services in January 1979. He has served on the Committee on Armed Services since that date, a period of nearly 36 years. (B) A graduate of Detroit Central High School, Senator Levin went on to Swarthmore College, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1959, gaining admittance to the Michigan bar. He served his State as assistant attorney general and general counsel of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964-1967, and later served his hometown of Detroit as a member of the Detroit City Council from 1969-1973, and as the council's president from 1974-1977. (C) Senator Levin first served as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the United States Senate for a period of the 107th Congress, and has remained chairman since the 110th Congress began in 2007. He has exercised extraordinary leadership as either the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee since the start of the 105th Congress in 1997. (D) Each year, for the past 52 years, the Committee on Armed Services has reliably passed an annual defense authorization act, and this will be the 36th that Senator Levin has had a role in. In his capacity as member, ranking member, and chairman, he has been an advocate for a strong national defense, and has made lasting contributions to the security of our Nation. (E) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the last annual authorization act for the national defense that Senator Levin manages in and for the United States Senate [[Page 128 STAT. 3293]] as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his honor, as provided in subsection (a). (2)(A) Representative Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992 to represent California's 25th Congressional District. (B) Chairman McKeon was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Tujunga CA. He served a two and a half year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and attended Brigham Young University. Prior to his election to Congress, he was a small business owner, and served both on the William S. Hart Union High School District Board of Trustees and as the first mayor of the City of Santa Clarita. (C) In the 111th Congress, Chairman McKeon was selected by his peers as the Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee and has served as Chairman since in the 112th and 113th Congresses. Previously Chairman McKeon had served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. (D) Chairman McKeon is a champion of a strong national defense, the men and women of America's Armed Forces and their families, and returning fiscal discipline to the Department of Defense. His priority has been to ensure our troops deployed around the world have the equipment, resources, authorities, training and time they need to successfully complete their missions and return home. (E) For 52 consecutive years, the House Armed Services Committee, in a bipartisan, bicameral tradition, has passed and enacted an annual defense authorization act. Chairman McKeon had said it has been the privilege of his life to shepherd that tradition under his tenure. (F) It is therefore fitting this Act, the last national defense authorization act of his tenure, be named in Chairman McKeon's honor, as provided in subsection (a). (c) References.--Any reference in this or any other Act to the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015'' shall be deemed to refer to the ``Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015''.

REPORT ON STATUS OF AIR-LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILE CAPABILITIES. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The capability provided by the nuclear-capable, air- launched cruise missile is critical to maintaining a credible and effective air-delivery leg of the nuclear triad, preserving [[Page 128 STAT. 3321]] the ability to respond to geopolitical and technical surprise, and reassuring allies of the United States through credible extended deterrence. (2) In the fiscal year 2015 budget request of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Air Force delayed development of the long- range standoff weapon, the follow-on for the air-launched cruise missile, by three years. (3) The Secretary plans to sustain the current air-launched cruise missile, known as the AGM-86, until approximately 2030, with multiple service life-extension programs required to preserve but not enhance the existing capabilities of the air- launched cruise missile. (4) The AGM-86 was initially developed in the 1970s and deployed in the 1980s. (5) The average age of the inventory of air-launched cruise missiles is more than 30 years old. (6) The operating environment, particularly the sophistication of integrated air defenses, has evolved substantially since the inception of the air-launched cruise missile. (7) The AGM-86 is no longer in production and the inventory of spare bodies for required annual testing continues to diminish, posing serious challenges for long-term sustainment. (b) Report.-- (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force, in coordination with the Commander of the United States Strategic Command, shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the status of the current air-launched cruise missile and the development of the follow-on system, the long-range standoff weapon, in accordance with section 217 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113- 66; 127 Stat. 706). (2) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) shall include the following: (A) An assessment of the effectiveness and survivability of the air-launched cruise missile through 2030, including the impact of any degradation on the ability of the United States Strategic Command to meet deterrence requirements, including the number of targets held at risk by the air-launched cruise missile or the burdens placed on other legs of the nuclear triad. (B) A description of age-related failure trends, an assessment of potential age-related fleet-wide reliability and supportability problems, and the estimated costs for sustaining the air-launched cruise missile. (C) A detailed plan, including initial cost estimates, for the development and deployment of the follow-on system that will achieve initial operational capability before 2030. (D) An assessment of the feasibility and advisability of alternative development strategies, including initial cost estimates, that would achieve full operational capability before 2030. (E) An assessment of current testing requirements and the availability of test bodies to sustain the air- launched cruise missile over the long term. [[Page 128 STAT. 3322]] (F) A description of the extent to which the airframe and other related components can be completed independent of the payload, as determined by the Nuclear Weapons Council established by section 179 of title 10, United States Code. (G) A statement of the risks assumed by not fielding an operational replacement for the existing air-launched cruise missile by 2030. (3) Form.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in classified form, but may include an unclassified summary. Subtitle E--Defense-Wide, Joint, and Multiservice Matters SEC. 151.
