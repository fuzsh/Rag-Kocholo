        "text": "Resource protection is foremost at all state parks, and swimming with manatees is not allowed.\n\nHowever, the endangered Florida manatee can be seen every day at Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. Visitors can go below the water’s surface to view these gentle giants from the underwater observatory in Homosassa's main spring.\n\nLaunching and/or landing a drone is prohibited within Florida State Parks except in very rare circumstances. The portion of the Florida Administrative Code that governs the operation of Florida State Parks (Chapter 62D-2.014, F.A.C.) states:\n\n(15) Aircraft. No person operating or responsible for any aircraft, glider, balloon, parachute or other aerial apparatus shall cause any such apparatus to take off from or land in any park except in an emergency when human life is endangered or where a designated landing facility may exist on park property.\n\nThe Florida Park Service includes drones in the category of \"other aerial apparatus.” Currently, we do not have guest-accessible landing facilities in any Florida state park.\n\nThe primary reason for our very limited occasions of drone use (i.e., mainly as a tool for rescue or reviewing areas impacted by natural disaster) is because our mission as part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection requires us to take into consideration the preservation of natural resources.\n\nIt has been observed that nesting birds view drones as potential predators and are likely to abandon nests or avoid otherwise ideal habitat areas if drones have been regularly spotted in those locations. We do not want this to occur within our park conservation areas, which are intended to be sanctuaries for our native wildlife.\n\nOur statewide park rules, based on regulations set out by the Florida Administrative Code, state that metal detecting is prohibited on all state park lands, except for coastal parks. In these parks, metal detecting may occur within certain beach areas located between the toe of the dune and the high-water line, as designated by the park manager. Metal detecting in submerged locations is not permitted.\n\nObjects with historic association (anything over 50 years old) are not permitted to be kept by park visitors, even if the objects are found in the areas approved for metal detecting. These objects are archaeological artifacts, and title to such is vested in the Florida Department of State's Division of Historical Resources.\n\nIf you plan to visit a state park with a beach, we recommend calling ahead to the park to inquire if there is any section of the beach where you can do metal detecting and if there are any restrictions you should be aware of (i.e., can you dig down to retrieve any objects you find, etc.). View our list of all state parks with beaches. Be aware that a limited number of these parks are inland, and their \"beach\" is on a lake, river, spring, etc. Because these are not coastal parks, metal detecting is not allowed at these locations.\n\nPer Chapter 62.D, F.A.C., no person shall destroy, injure, deface, mar, move, dig, harmfully disturb or remove from any park area, or the waters thereof, any buildings, structures, facilities, historic ruins, equipment, park property, soil, sand, gravel, rocks, stones, minerals, marine plants or animals, artifacts or other materials. No person shall cut, carve, injure, mutilate, move, displace or break off any water bottom formation or growth. Nor shall any person possess, break off or in any way damage any stalactites, stalagmites or other cave formations.\n\nThis rule means that one cannot gather firewood/kindling materials; forage for edibles; or remove plant/animal items such as driftwood, leaves/pine needles, feathers/bones or other animal products within a state park.\n\nExceptions to this rule are made only for research/academic study purposes, in cases where a collection permit has been issued by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nThe other exception to the prohibition regarding collection and removal of items is if the items are empty seashells, sea glass or shark teeth found between the water line and toe of the sand dunes in coastal parks with beaches. Seashells with living creatures in them and live sand dollars should be left where they are and not removed.\n\nFlorida State Parks are the site for many important family gatherings, and we are honored that you consider us as a desired venue. Unfortunately, since there is no way to guarantee where balloons and fire-incorporating lanterns (either floating on water or those launched into the air) may wind up, they risk becoming litter that wildlife may be caught in or attempt to ingest.\n\nLanterns also run the risk of becoming a flammable hazard that may ignite an uncontrolled fire. We request that you look into other options to commemorate your loved one.\n\nThere are two ways to purchase an annual entrance pass.\n\nPurchase at a Park\n\nAnnual entrance passes can be purchased at all park ranger stations and museums during regular business hours, 365 days a year. Please call the park in advance to ensure availability. Those who are eligible for discounted or free passes may use this method to receive their pass.\n\nTo expedite the process, visit Reserve.FloridaStateParks in advance and create an account. If you have made a camping reservation with Florida State Parks in the last year, you already have an account.\n\nPurchase Online\n\nShop online at Reserve.FloridaStateParks for annual entrance passes. All online orders will be charged a $6 convenience fee plus a $10 shipping fee per annual entrance pass purchased.\n\nDelivery times vary depending on shipping method. After purchase of an annual entrance pass online, you will receive a temporary pass that’s good for 14 days after the purchase date. The temporary pass will be sent to the email address associated with the online account. This temporary pass will allow the passholder to visit Florida’s state parks while they wait for their annual entrance pass to arrive in the mail. The name of the cardholder will be included on the temporary pass. Be prepared to show photo ID to use the pass.\n\n1.2. How does a visitor make an overnight accommodation reservation?\n\nCabins and most boat camping slips, equestrian campsites and standard campsites can be booked by visiting the Florida State Parks reservation website or by calling 800-326-3521 or TDD 888-433-0287 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nFlorida residents may make campsite or cabin reservations 11 months in advance. Non-Florida residents may make campsite or cabin reservations 10 months in advance.\n\nIf you are booking a primitive campsite or reserving a group camping area, please contact the park where you wish to camp.\n\nFor The Lodge at Wakulla Springs and glamping campsites, please contact the concession provider to make the reservation.\n\nFlorida residents may make campsite or cabin reservations from the same day before 1 p.m. up to 11 months in advance of their arrival date. Reservations may only be made beyond 11 months when the reservation period starts within the 11-month period and ends outside that period. The result is reservations could extend 11 months and 13 days into the future.\n\nNon-Florida residents may make campsite or cabin reservations from the same day before 1 p.m. up to 10 months in advance of their arrival date. Reservations may only be made beyond 10 months when the reservation period starts within the 10-month period and ends outside that period. The result is reservations could extend 10 months and 13 days into the future.\n\nNew sites become available for reservation daily at 8 a.m. Eastern time. Any new sites that become available throughout the day due to a cancellation are released back into inventory following the cancellation.\n\nAll campsites or cabins not reserved or occupied may be rented to walk-in visitors on a first-come, first-served basis. Reservations are made on a pay-in-advance basis.\n\nThere are two ways to cancel or modify an overnight accommodation reservation:\n\nCall the telephone reservation center at 800-326-3521 and speak to one of the agents. Please have your reservation number available and let the agent know whether you are modifying the booking or canceling it entirely.\n\nLog into the Florida State Parks reservations website, select the drop-down arrow next to your first name in the upper right-hand corner of the screen and choose “Your Reservations.” All active reservations in your name will be shown. To the left of each reservation, you will see options for Cancel, Modify or Reprint.\n\nIf you want to change your reservation from accommodations in one state park to a different state park, you will need to cancel your original booking and make a new reservation in the new park.\n\nModifying a reservation incurs a $10 change fee charged at the time of modification. If any additional fees are applicable because of the change, those will be assessed at the same time. If any refund is due because of the change, it will be processed immediately.\n\nIf you are canceling your reservation more than 24 hours prior to the scheduled check-in time/date, there will be a $17.75 cancellation fee assessed and we will retain the nonrefundable $6.70 service fee that was charged at the time of booking. All other monies will be refunded to you.\n\nIf you are canceling your reservation within 24 hours of your scheduled check-in time/date, there will be a $17.75 cancellation fee assessed, we will retain the non-refundable $6.70 service fee that was charged at the time of booking, and we will also retain the cost of the first night of stay. All other monies will be refunded to you.\n\nThe majority of campsites reservable through the Florida State Parks' reservation system provide a campfire ring on the site that has a removable grill top. This allows either campfire enjoyment or practical cooking over the fire.\n\nIn certain locations, a charcoal grill on a post may be provided instead of a campfire ring.\n\nYou may want to verify in advance which feature your campsite offers, either by reading the special remarks/amenities listing on the campsite details, or by calling the park directly and inquiring about the features of a particular campsite.\n\nA campfire ring is also available at many primitive campsites, but it is important to verify campsite amenities at the time of reservation or beforehand.\n\nIf non-motorized travelers (such as cyclists, hikers, paddlers, etc.) arrive at a state park with campground facilities and a campsite is available for their use, they will be booked into that campsite at the standard nightly rate. If the campground is full at the guest’s time of arrival, the park staff will attempt to locate accommodations at referral campgrounds. If none are available or time is short, park staff may use temporary space for one night to provide accommodation, charging one night’s fee. Normally, a tent is required, but in this case, is waived, as long as the long-distance traveler has a sleeping bag. The traveler is permitted to use the park’s campground bathhouse at no additional charge.\n\nThe opportunity to stay overnight at a state park is limited to Florida State Parks that offer campground facilities. If a state park is a day-use only location and does not offer overnight accommodations, a traveler would not be able to stay overnight on park property.\n\nThe Florida Park Service (also known as the Division of Recreation and Parks) is part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Most Florida government job opportunities are advertised through Jobs.MyFlorida.com.\n\nWhen seeking state park job listings at the website, you will first want to click on the drop-down arrow marked “Agency” and choose “Department of Environmental Protection” from the list. Once you are on the DEP page, you can either scroll down the page to see all DEP positions available, or you can narrow your search by typing in a specific location. The job descriptions will cover what knowledge, skills and abilities are important for a candidate to have. Be aware that these descriptions may vary from park to park even if the job title is the same.\n\nOn some occasions, seasonal or part-time employment may be advertised directly through the state park and not through the jobs website linked above. If you do not see any listed positions in your desired location, contact your state park of interest to inquire if there are any opportunities available and what application process is necessary to complete.\n\nContact information for all of our state parks or trails can be found at FloridaStateParks.org. If you type the name of the park/trail you are seeking into the search bar located in the upper right-hand corner, the website will bring you to the page for that particular location. The physical address and telephone number for the park/trail will be immediately to the right of the welcome message and listed as “Contact This Park.”\n\nInquiries regarding employment with any of the on-site concession services within Florida State Parks should be addressed to the concession business directly.\n\nThere are no specific degree or subject matter requirements for becoming employed with Florida State Parks, although fields that are related to the job might include environmental science, leisure and recreation services, forestry, biology, geology, history or customer services. These areas may be helpful in understanding the principles, philosophies, etc., that are used to manage state parks. Many of our employees also have backgrounds in military service.\n\nPark rangers and park services specialists are often called upon to do such tasks as resource management (removing exotic plants from park grounds, monitoring/protecting sensitive ecological areas and species within the park, participating in prescribed burns); visitor services; park interpretation; maintenance (cleaning park grounds and facilities, providing preventative maintenance, and repairing park equipment and facilities); administration (collecting fees, preparing reports, maintaining records and logs); and providing park security. Experience in skilled trades such as electrical wiring, plumbing, carpentry, and operation of power tools and farming equipment can be a plus.\n\nThe application page is relatively simple and asks for prior work, education, and service experience along with a motivational statement. If you have experience related to the service description, it is suggested that you include that as we are a competitive program and many of our members have prior experience in a related field.\n\nAdditionally, you will be asked to provide contact information for a minimum of two professional references. These references will be emailed with a questionnaire that will need to be filled out on your behalf. It is advised that you notify these contacts as your application can be considered incomplete until the questionnaire is finished.\n\nAll parks will close when they reach capacity.\n\nEach park has a set carrying capacity which is established based on the estimated number of users a recreation resource can accommodate while maintaining the quality of the recreational experience and avoiding unacceptable resource degradation. Should a park close once they reach capacity, no further vehicles, bicycles or walk-in visitors will be allowed to enter until space becomes available – with exception to registered campers.\n\nIf you are renting a pavilion, hosting an event or have been invited to an event, please plan accordingly. If you leave the park, you will not be allowed to re-enter until space is available.\n\nPlease be advised that many of our parks offer entry access located off busy highways, however we ask our visitors not to block access for emergency vehicles and not to park on the road shoulders.\n\nAt many parks, for safety reasons, visitors may not be allowed to wait in line in the park when the park has closed.\n\nIn the future, the park will offer two camping loops.\n\nThe former Shady Pines Campground was washed out by Hurricane Michael. The bathhouses were destroyed. Much of the tree canopy was lost. The dune adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico was eroded.\n\nThe new Shady Pines Campground will feature 36 standard-facility campsites and 10 tent-only campsites. Two new bathhouses will be built. Campers will have access to the Gulf beach from the campground. The Shady Pines Campground will open around mid-2023.\n\nA new camping loop, called the Bayview Campground, will be created on the site of the former boat trailer parking area. Campers will enjoy a scenic view over the waters of St. Joseph Bay. Approximately 19 standard-facility campsites will surround an area of natural scrubby flatwoods with a footpath to a bathhouse.\n\nYes. Park visitors will have access to two new day-use areas for picnicking and other recreation.\n\nThe Gulf Breeze Day Use Area (former Gulf Breeze Campground) is open and allows visitors to explore an area of beach north of Eagle Harbor with a scenic backdrop of piney flatwoods and open marsh that provide habitat for an abundance of wildlife. Opportunities for viewing the landscape are provided by short walking paths and a potential observation platform. Additional amenities at this location will include overflow parking for vehicles with boat trailers, a restroom and covered pavilions.\n\nIn the future, pavilions at the Bayview Day Use Area will provide shade for picnickers. This area will be used by hikers on the Bayview Hiking Trail and paddlers for launching paddlecraft and small watercraft.\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection offers a variety of exciting and challenging internships across the state for individuals interested in pursuing careers in engineering, environmental law, environmental science and park management. Other professional, technical and administrative positions are available including field work, surveying, hydrology, communications and information technology. Through our internship program, students can improve communications skills, develop teamwork skills, learn the importance of protecting the environment and much more. Application materials can be submitted electronically or by mail.\n\nDEP Internship Program.\n\nDEP Internship Application.\n\nIf you are interested in applying for an internship with DEP, you will need to send us the following information:\n\nCover letter describing your area(s) of interest and the dates you will be available.\n\nResume describing your training and experience.\n\nCopy of school's internship criteria (if applicable).\n\nPlease send these three items to Katrina.Kasemir. You also can submit your information via fax at 850-245-2545 or by mail at the following address:\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection, Human Resource Management\n\nAttn: Recruitment\n\n3900 Commonwealth Blvd., MS 70\n\nTallahassee, FL 32399-3000\n\nDEP is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer. If you need an accommodation to participate in the recruitment/selection process, contact the Bureau of Human Resource Management at 850-245-2414.\n\nThe Junior Ranger program offers a fun and learning-immersive way for the young and young-at-heart to interact with features within Florida’s state parks. By completing organized and/or self-directed activities when visiting different Florida State Parks, participants first earn a patch (after completing the six CORE activities).\n\nYou can pick up a packet of Junior Ranger materials at one of the participating state parks. We recommend calling the park to verify that it has the Junior Ranger packets in stock before you make the drive. It is also possible to download the materials under the “Complete Junior Ranger Activities” heading.\n\nIf the participant finishes six more activities in certain subject categories at different state parks and turns in the completed Junior Ranger Passport, they will receive a pin. Please refer to the information given at “Complete Junior Ranger Activities” for more details.\n\nJunior Ranger materials are also available en Español.\n\nSince different state parks offer varying types of facilities and have different entrance fee costs, you would need to pay each park’s individual entrance fee at the time of entrance, regardless of what other state parks you may have also visited on that day.\n\nIf you retain your receipt given at the time of entrance into a state park, that receipt will allow you to come and go in and out of that park multiple times on the same day.\n\nBe aware that if you depart the park and the park reaches maximum capacity visitation before you return, you may not be able to re-enter the park.\n\nIn most of Florida's state parks, well-behaved pets on a 6-foot, hand-held leash or otherwise under physical control are welcome on our hiking trails, in our picnicking areas and in our campgrounds. Remember to always pick up after your pet and dispose of waste in trash receptacles.\n\nThe park areas where pets are not allowed:\n\nEnclosed areas (such as restrooms, welcome centers, restaurants and concession stands).\n\nBeaches (the one exception to this is a pet-friendly section of beach at Honeymoon Island State Park).\n\nSwimming areas and boat ramps.\n\nPlaygrounds.\n\nPets are not allowed in cabins.\n\nThere may be additional park-specific limitations on where pets are permitted; please check with the park directly if you have questions. View our pet policy.\n\nEgmont Key State Park, Lignumvitae Key Botanical State Park, Skyway Fishing Pier State Park and Weeki Wachee Springs State Park do not permit pets within the park. Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park provides complimentary kennels at the park entrance for pets whose owners are visiting the park, as pets are not permitted in the boats and exhibit areas.\n\nIndividually trained service animals in a working capacity are allowed in all public areas of a state park when accompanied by a visitor with a disability.\n\nEmotional support animals, therapy animals and companion animals must follow the same rules for pets as set forth in the Florida State Parks Pet Policy.\n\nIn most coastal parks with beaches, pets are not permitted on the sand or in the water so that they do not disturb shorebirds or sea turtles or their nests. The one exception to this rule is a pet-friendly section of beach at Honeymoon Island State Park. In this location, pets must remain leashed or otherwise under physical control.\n\nAround inland freshwater and brackish rivers, springs, creeks, lakes and other bodies of water, pets are not permitted in designated swimming areas, tubing runs, boat launches or other water areas due to their being viewed as potential prey by alligators. For the safety of your pet and other state park guests, please keep your pet away from these areas.\n\nThe biggest difference between a wildfire and a prescribed fire is that a prescribed fire is a planned event and therefore it occurs under the best possible circumstances.\n\nWildfires often occur under extreme conditions such as prolonged drought whereas prescribed fires are implemented when the weather and natural conditions are desirable.\n\nPrescribed fire reduces the risk of wildfires by reducing the amount of hazardous natural fuels and fills the important role of maintaining fire in fire dependent natural communities.\n\nMany of our brochure materials are directly downloadable from the Florida State Parks website in PDF form:\n\nThe Florida State Parks Guide is divided by geographical regions so you can see which state parks and trails are in a particular part of Florida.\n\nThe Camping & Cabins Guide is divided in the same format as the Florida State Parks Guide but focusing on which state parks offer some type of overnight accommodations.\n\nThe Official Fee Schedule provides fee information for daily entrance into state parks plus overnight accommodation costs, including fee ranges for activities and discount categories.\n\nAnnual Entrance Pass' program benefits and discount categories.\n\nPets in Parks covers Florida State Park policies regarding pets and service animals, including overnight accommodation rules.\n\nBrochures for most individual state parks and trails can be found on the park/trail’s individual page – look up your park of interest through Find A Park, then select on the name of the park/trail. Under the “Park Menu” next to the Welcome message, look for the brown “Download Park Map” box to see and download the park brochure.\n\nTo request a hard copy in the mail, send an email to FSP.Feedback@FloridaDEP.gov.\n\nWe ask that every potential volunteer complete an individual application. You will submit your application, and they will submit one for themselves, using a different email address. This way, when entering your completed volunteer hours in the future, we will know exactly how many hours you have personally completed.\n\nIn order to link the two of you together, you will list any other people who will be staying in the camping rig with you, and they will do the same on their application.\n\nWe also recommend that you list the same state parks of interest in your applications.\n\nOnce you are in our system, the best tip is to contact the parks for which you applied and ask for the volunteer manager. You can update your application in the system at any time and select a park or parks. Your application will be emailed directly to the volunteer manager(s) at the first park that you select. Then follow-up with a phone call. Think of it as an informal interview about the parks’ openings. Each park keeps its own schedule and selects its hosts based on their park needs. When calling, be patient yet persistent as our staff work in the field. Park phone numbers are listed on the parks’ web page.\n\nPro Tips:\n\nBrowse opportunities and apply directly to those of interest to you. The parks advertise their current openings at http://volunteers.floridastateparks.org/ under the “Opportunities” heading.\n\nCoastal park openings are very competitive. Parks in the interior of Florida often have more openings. It’s a good way to get started volunteering as a campground host.\n\nThere are frequently more opportunities from April through October. November through March is a very competitive season for campground hosting opportunities.\n\nThe list of state parks with campground host and park resident sites, Applicant User Guide, the overview of volunteering in Florida State Parks, opportunities and applications to directly to those opportunities are located on the Volunteer Portal.\n\nPeople of all ages may volunteer at Florida State Parks. Youth/minors are 17 years old and younger. People of ages 14 to 17 years old can volunteer provided that the work does not pose a threat to their health or safety, violate federal or Florida child labor laws or the parks’ youth/minor volunteer policy. A parent or legal guardian must give written consent before they volunteer as part of signing the Volunteer Agreement.\n\nYouth/minors age 13 years and younger must be accompanied by a parent or guardian or participate in a group service project when part of a youth organization.\n\nCheck with the park regarding their youth/minor policy and opportunities for group service projects. Park phone numbers are listed on the parks’ web page at Find a Park.\n\nYes, you are welcome to apply to become a Florida State Park volunteer. To apply, go to the Volunteer Portal. User Guides are available to assist you.\n\nPlease note, however, it is your responsibility as the potential volunteer to know what your country and/or United States visa/immigration laws allow while working in the country. Depending upon your origin, duration of stay and other factors there may be some restrictions on working/volunteering. There may also be additional border restrictions due to the pandemic.\n\nCanadian citizens do not require a visa to enter the United States for short term visits except for certain situations. In general, international visitors can volunteer in the United States when you are here on a B1/B2/Border Crossing Card for citizens and residents of Mexico and for some other nationals of countries that are covered by the Visa Waiver Program. There may be other restrictions.\n\nA significant restriction to be aware of is that you can only volunteer to do things that are normally done on a voluntary basis, i.e. without pay. So for example, you could volunteer at a hospital as a 'candy striper' because that is a volunteer position, and you would be working alongside other unpaid volunteers. You could not do the work of a nurse even if you volunteered to do it unpaid because a nurse is normally a paid position. You also can't do \"anything that would benefit a commercial enterprise,\" and there are restrictions on things like unpaid internships."
