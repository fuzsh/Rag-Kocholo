        "text": "Introduction\n\nIslamic Spain (711-1492)\n\nIslamic Spain was a multi-cultural mix of the people of three great monotheistic religions: Muslims, Christians, and Jews.\n\nAlthough Christians and Jews lived under restrictions, for much of the time the three groups managed to get along together, and to some extent, to benefit from the presence of each other.\n\nIt brought a degree of civilisation to Europe that matched the heights of the Roman Empire and the Italian Renaissance.\n\nOutline\n\nIn 711 Muslim forces invaded and in seven years conquered the Iberian peninsula.\n\nIt became one of the great Muslim civilisations; reaching its summit with the Umayyad caliphate of Cordovain the tenth century.\n\nMuslim rule declined after that and ended in 1492 when Granada was conquered.\n\nThe heartland of Muslim rule was Southern Spain or Andulusia.\n\nPeriods\n\nMuslim Spain was not a single period, but a succession of different rules.\n\nThe Dependent Emirate (711-756)\n\nThe Independent Emirate (756-929)\n\nThe Caliphate (929-1031)\n\nThe Almoravid Era (1031-1130)\n\nDecline (1130-1492)\n\nAudio journey\n\nThe Alhambra Palace, the finest surviving palace of Muslim Spain, is the beginning of a historical journey in this audio feature, In the Footsteps of Muhammad: Granada.\n\nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed. Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions\n\nConquest\n\nThe conquest\n\nThe traditional story is that in the year 711, an oppressed Christian chief, Julian, went to Musa ibn Nusair, the governor of North Africa, with a plea for help against the tyrannical Visigoth ruler of Spain, Roderick.\n\nMusa responded by sending the young general Tariq bin Ziyad with an army of 7000 troops. The name Gibraltar is derived from Jabal At-Tariq which is Arabic for 'Rock of Tariq' named after the place where the Muslim army landed.\n\nThe story of the appeal for help is not universally accepted. There is no doubt that Tariq invaded Spain, but the reason for it may have more to do with the Muslim drive to enlarge their territory.\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Visigoth army easily, and Roderick was killed in battle.\n\nAfter the first victory, the Muslims conquered most of Spain and Portugal with little difficulty, and in fact with little opposition. By 720 Spain was largely under Muslim (or Moorish, as it was called) control.\n\nReasons\n\nOne reason for the rapid Muslim success was the generous surrender terms that they offered the people, which contrasted with the harsh conditions imposed by the previous Visigoth rulers.\n\nThe ruling Islamic forces were made up of different nationalities, and many of the forces were converts with uncertain motivation, so the establishment of a coherent Muslim state was not easy.\n\nAndalusia\n\nThe heartland of Muslim rule was Southern Spain or Andulusia. The name Andalusia comes from the term Al-Andalus used by the Arabs, derived from the Vandals who had been settled in the region.\n\nA Golden Age\n\nStability\n\nStability in Muslim Spain came with the establishment of the Andalusian Umayyad dynasty, which lasted from 756 to 1031.\n\nThe credit goes to Amir Abd al-Rahman, who founded the Emirate of Cordoba, and was able to get the various different Muslim groups who had conquered Spain to pull together in ruling it.\n\nThe Golden Age\n\nThe Muslim period in Spain is often described as a 'golden age' of learning where libraries, colleges, public baths were established and literature, poetry and architecture flourished. Both Muslims and non-Muslims made major contributions to this flowering of culture.\n\nA Golden Age of religious tolerance?\n\nIslamic Spain is sometimes described as a 'golden age' of religious and ethnic tolerance and interfaith harmony between Muslims, Christians and Jews.\n\nSome historians believe this idea of a golden age is false and might lead modern readers to believe, wrongly, that Muslim Spain was tolerant by the standards of 21st century Britain.\n\nThe true position is more complicated. The distinguished historian Bernard Lewis wrote that the status of non-Muslims in Islamic Spain was a sort of second-class citizenship but he went on to say:\n\nSecond-class citizenship, though second class, is a kind of citizenship. It involves some rights, though not all, and is surely better than no rights at all...\n\n...A recognized status, albeit one of inferiority to the dominant group, which is established by law, recognized by tradition, and confirmed by popular assent, is not to be despised.\n\nBernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1984\n\nLife for non-Muslims in Islamic Spain\n\nJews and Christians did retain some freedom under Muslim rule, providing they obeyed certain rules. Although these rules would now be considered completely unacceptable, they were not much of a burden by the standards of the time, and in many ways the non-Muslims of Islamic Spain (at least before 1050) were treated better than conquered peoples might have expected during that period of history.\n\nthey were not forced to live in ghettoes or other special locations\n\nthey were not slaves\n\nthey were not prevented from following their faith\n\nthey were not forced to convert or die under Muslim rule\n\nthey were not banned from any particular ways of earning a living; they often took on jobs shunned by Muslims;\n\nthese included unpleasant work such as tanning and butchery\n\nbut also pleasant jobs such as banking and dealing in gold and silver\n\nthey could work in the civil service of the Islamic rulers\n\nJews and Christians were able to contribute to society and culture\n\nThe alternative view to the Golden Age of Tolerance is that Jews and Christians were severely restricted in Muslim Spain, by being forced to live in a state of 'dhimmitude'. (A dhimmi is a non-Muslim living in an Islamic state who is not a slave, but does not have the same rights as a Muslim living in the same state.)\n\nIn Islamic Spain, Jews and Christians were tolerated if they:\n\nacknowledged Islamic superiority\n\naccepted Islamic power\n\npaid a tax called Jizya to the Muslim rulers and sometimes paid higher rates of other taxes\n\navoided blasphemy\n\ndid not try to convert Muslims\n\ncomplied with the rules laid down by the authorities. These included:\n\nrestrictions on clothing and the need to wear a special badge\n\nrestrictions on building synagogues and churches\n\nnot allowed to carry weapons\n\ncould not receive an inheritance from a Muslim\n\ncould not bequeath anything to a Muslim\n\ncould not own a Muslim slave\n\na dhimmi man could not marry a Muslim woman (but the reverse was acceptable)\n\na dhimmi could not give evidence in an Islamic court\n\ndhimmis would get lower compensation than Muslims for the same injury\n\nAt times there were restrictions on practicing one's faith too obviously. Bell-ringing or chanting too loudly were frowned on and public processions were restricted.\n\nMany Christians in Spain assimilated parts of the Muslim culture. Some learned Arabic, some adopted the same clothes as their rulers (some Christian women even started wearing the veil); some took Arabic names. Christians who did this were known as Mozarabs.\n\nThe Muslim rulers didn't give their non-Muslim subjects equal status; as Bat Ye'or has stated, the non-Muslims came definitely at the bottom of society.\n\nSociety was sharply divided along ethnic and religious lines, with the Arab tribes at the top of the hierarchy, followed by the Berbers who were never recognized as equals, despite their Islamization; lower in the scale came the mullawadun converts and, at the very bottom, the dhimmi Christians and Jews.\n\nBat Ye'or, Islam and Dhimmitude, 2002\n\nThe Muslims did not explicitly hate or persecute the non-Muslims. As Bernard Lewis puts it:\n\nin contrast to Christian anti-Semitism, the Muslim attitude toward non-Muslims is one not of hate or fear or envy but simply of contempt\n\nBernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1984\n\nAn example of this contempt is found in this 12th century ruling:\n\nA Muslim must not massage a Jew or a Christian nor throw away his refuse nor clean his latrines. The Jew and the Christian are better fitted for such trades, since they are the trades of those who are vile.\n\n12th Century ruling\n\nWhy were non-Muslims tolerated in Islamic Spain?\n\nThere were several reasons why the Muslim rulers tolerated rival faiths:\n\nJudaism and Christianity were monotheistic faiths, so arguably their members were worshipping the same God\n\ndespite having some wayward beliefs and practices, such as the failure to accept the significance of Muhammad and the Qur'an\n\nThe Christians outnumbered the Muslims\n\nso mass conversion or mass execution was not practical\n\noutlawing or controlling the beliefs of so many people would have been massively expensive\n\nBringing non-Muslims into government provided the rulers with administrators\n\nwho were loyal (because not attached to any of the various Muslim groups)\n\nwho could be easily disciplined or removed if the need arose. (One Emir went so far as to have a Christian as the head of his bodyguard.)\n\nPassages in the Qur'an said that Christians and Jews should be tolerated if they obeyed certain rules\n\nOppression in later Islamic Spain\n\nNot all the Muslim rulers of Spain were tolerant. Almanzor looted churches and imposed strict restrictions.\n\nThe position of non-Muslims in Spain deteriorated substantially from the middle of the 11th century as the rulers became more strict and Islam came under greater pressure from outside.\n\nChristians were not allowed taller houses than Muslims, could not employ Muslim servants, and had to give way to Muslims on the street.\n\nChristians could not display any sign of their faith outside, not even carrying a Bible. There were persecutions and executions.\n\nOne notorious event was a pogrom in Granada in 1066, and this was followed by further violence and discrimination as the Islamic empire itself came under pressure.\n\nAs the Islamic empire declined, and more territory was taken back by Christian rulers, Muslims in Christian areas found themselves facing similar restrictions to those they had formerly imposed on others.\n\nBut, on the whole, the lot of minority faith groups was to become worse after Islam was replaced in Spain by Christianity.\n\nThere were also cultural alliances, particularly in the architecture - the 12 lions in the court of Alhambra are heralds of Christian influences.\n\nThe mosque at Cordoba, now converted to a cathedral is still, somewhat ironically, known as La Mezquita or literally, the mosque.\n\nThe mosque was begun at the end of the 8th century by the Ummayyad prince Abd al Rahman ibn Muawiyah.\n\nUnder the reign of Abd al Rahman III (r. 912-961) Spanish Islam reached its greatest power as, every May, campaigns were launched towards the Christian frontier, this was also the cultural peak of Islamic civilisation in Spain.\n\nDecline and fall\n\nDecline and fall\n\nThe collapse of Islamic rule in Spain was due not only to increasing aggression on the part of Christian states, but to divisions among the Muslim rulers. The rot came from both the centre and the extremities.\n\nEarly in the eleventh century, the single Islamic Caliphate had shattered into a score of small kingdoms, ripe for picking-off. The first big Islamic centre to fall to Christianity was Toledo in 1085.\n\nThe Muslims replied with forces from Africa which under the general Yusuf bin Tashfin defeated the Christians resoundingly in 1086, and by 1102 had recaptured most of Andalusia. The general was able to reunite much of Muslim Spain.\n\nRevival\n\nIt didn't last. Yusuf died in 1106, and, as one historian puts it, the \"rulers of Muslim states began cutting each other's throats again\".\n\nInternal rebellions in 1144 and 1145 further shattered Islamic unity, and despite intermittent military successes, Islam's domination of Spain was ended for good.\n\nThe Muslims finally lost all power in Spain in 1492. By 1502 the Christian rulers issued an order requiring all Muslims to convert to Christianity, and when this didn't work, they imposed brutal restrictions on the remaining Spanish Muslims."
