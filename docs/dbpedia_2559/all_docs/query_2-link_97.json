        "text": "The AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence) provides AI developers and deployers with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI. At the same time, the regulation seeks to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe AI Act is part of a wider package of policy measures to support the development of trustworthy AI, which also includes the AI Innovation Package and the Coordinated Plan on AI. Together, these measures guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI. They also strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU.\n\nThe AI Act is the first-ever comprehensive legal framework on AI worldwide. The aim of the new rules is to foster trustworthy AI in Europe and beyond, by ensuring that AI systems respect fundamental rights, safety, and ethical principles and by addressing risks of very powerful and impactful AI models.\n\nWhy do we need rules on AI?\n\nThe AI Act ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.\n\nFor example, it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme.\n\nAlthough existing legislation provides some protection, it is insufficient to address the specific challenges AI systems may bring.\n\nThe new rules:\n\naddress risks specifically created by AI applications\n\nprohibit AI practices that pose unacceptable risks\n\ndetermine a list of high-risk applications\n\nset clear requirements for AI systems for high-risk applications\n\ndefine specific obligations deployers and providers of high-risk AI applications\n\nrequire a conformity assessment before a given AI system is put into service or placed on the market\n\nput enforcement in place after a given AI system is placed into the market\n\nestablish a governance structure at European and national level\n\nA risk-based approach\n\nThe Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk for AI systems:\n\nAll AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people are banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour.\n\nHigh risk\n\nAI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in:\n\ncritical infrastructures (e.g. transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk\n\neducational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone’s life (e.g. scoring of exams)\n\nsafety components of products (e.g. AI application in robot-assisted surgery)\n\nemployment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g. CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures)\n\nessential private and public services (e.g. credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan)\n\nlaw enforcement that may interfere with people’s fundamental rights (e.g. evaluation of the reliability of evidence)\n\nmigration, asylum and border control management (e.g. automated examination of visa applications)\n\nadministration of justice and democratic processes (e.g. AI solutions to search for court rulings)\n\nHigh-risk AI systems are subject to strict obligations before they can be put on the market:\n\nadequate risk assessment and mitigation systems\n\nhigh quality of the datasets feeding the system to minimise risks and discriminatory outcomes\n\nlogging of activity to ensure traceability of results\n\ndetailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to assess its compliance\n\nclear and adequate information to the deployer\n\nappropriate human oversight measures to minimise risk\n\nhigh level of robustness, security and accuracy\n\nAll remote biometric identification systems are considered high-risk and subject to strict requirements. The use of remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes is, in principle, prohibited.\n\nNarrow exceptions are strictly defined and regulated, such as when necessary to search for a missing child, to prevent a specific and imminent terrorist threat or to detect, locate, identify or prosecute a perpetrator or suspect of a serious criminal offence.\n\nThose usages is subject to authorisation by a judicial or other independent body and to appropriate limits in time, geographic reach and the data bases searched.\n\nLimited risk\n\nLimited risk refers to the risks associated with lack of transparency in AI usage. The AI Act introduces specific transparency obligations to ensure that humans are informed when necessary, fostering trust. For instance, when using AI systems such as chatbots, humans should be made aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. Providers also have to ensure that AI-generated content is identifiable. Besides, AI-generated text published with the purpose to inform the public on matters of public interest must be labelled as artificially generated. This also applies to audio and video content constituting deep fakes.\n\nMinimal or no risk\n\nThe AI Act allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. The vast majority of AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category.\n\nHow does it all work in practice for providers of high-risk AI systems?\n\nOnce an AI system is on the market, authorities are in charge of market surveillance, deployers ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and deployers will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning.\n\nA solution for the trustworthy use of large AI models\n\nMore and more, general-purpose AI models are becoming components of AI systems. These models can perform and adapt countless different tasks.\n\nWhile general-purpose AI models can enable better and more powerful AI solutions, it is difficult to oversee all capabilities.\n\nThere, the AI Act introduces transparency obligations for all general-purpose AI models to enable a better understanding of these models and additional risk management obligations for very capable and impactful models. These additional obligations include self-assessment and mitigation of systemic risks, reporting of serious incidents, conducting test and model evaluations, as well as cybersecurity requirements.\n\nFuture-proof legislation\n\nAs AI is a fast-evolving technology, the regulation has a future-proof approach, allowing rules to adapt to technological change. AI applications should remain trustworthy even after they have been placed on the market. This requires ongoing quality and risk management by providers.\n\nEnforcement and implementation\n\nThe European AI Office, established in February 2024 within the Commission, oversees the AI Act’s enforcement and implementation with the member states. It aims to create an environment where AI technologies respect human dignity, rights, and trust. It also fosters collaboration, innovation, and research in AI among various stakeholders. Moreover, it engages in international dialogue and cooperation on AI issues, acknowledging the need for global alignment on AI governance. Through these efforts, the European AI Office strives to position Europe as a leader in the ethical and sustainable development of AI technologies.\n\nNext steps"
