        "text": "Jack Harkness Gallery Appearances Talk\n\n\"Captain Jack Harkness\" was the alias adopted by the human Time Agent and con man Javic Piotr Thane (AUDIO: Month 25 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., R&J [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack: Volume Three (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) from the Boeshane Peninsula in the 51st century. He was a companion of the Ninth Doctor, and an associate of the Sixth, Tenth and Thirteenth Doctors.\n\nOriginally a Time Agent, Harkness lost his memories of his previous life and became a con artist. Upon meeting the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler in 1941, he tried to scam them into buying a Chula ambulance, having mistaken them for fellow Time Agents. After assisting the Doctor and Rose in curing a plague unleashed by rogue Chula nanogenes from the crashed ambulance, however, he would go on to join them in their travels in the TARDIS, inspiring him to become a better man.\n\nAfter he was shot and killed by a Dalek, Jack was revived by Rose, who at the time had been transformed into a nearly omnipotent being by gazing into the heart of the TARDIS. Unable to control her powers, she accidentally turned him into an immortal being. Because of this, the Doctor saw his companion as a fixed point â€” a temporal paradox that threatened the TARDIS's functionality. Consequently, the Doctor abandoned him in the year 200,100 aboard a space station orbiting a Dalek-devastated Earth. Stranded, the former Time Agent had to use his own devices to catch up to the Doctor. He thought it likely that he'd find the Ninth Doctor in the early 21st century, since that was Rose's home era. But his vortex manipulator failed to deliver him there due to the damage caused when he was exterminated by the Daleks, missing by more than a century â€” and going on the fritz immediately thereafter. This left the immortal no choice but to simply wait from the mid-19th to the early 21st century to reconnect with the Doctor.\n\nDuring his long wait for the \"right Doctor\", he experienced what was to him Earth's history firsthand and he even served in a few of the well-known conflicts. He also had many different relationships, some of which produced offspring. For the majority of those years, he also worked for Torchwood Three. After several decades as an informal free-lancer, he eventually became its head in the year 2000. Later that decade, he finally met up with the Doctor, although the Time Lord had by this time regenerated into his tenth incarnation and was now travelling with Martha Jones. The Doctor told Harkness why he had abandoned him, and explained there was nothing he could do to fix Harkness's condition. Together the Doctor, Harkness and Jones thwarted the Master and his plan to turn Earth into a new Gallifrey during the Year That Never Was, before Harkness parted ways with them to return to Torchwood.\n\nOver the years, Torchwood lost many of its members. At the dawn of the 2010s, the 456 returned to Earth. Although Torchwood was able to repel the threat, their success came with the loss of their headquarters and the loss of Harkness's grandson, Steven Carter, as well as his teammate and lover, Ianto Jones. He, therefore, disbanded the group and left Earth. However, he returned during the events of the so-called \"Miracle Day\", and a new Torchwood team arose. Later though, after several further changes to the team, Torchwood lost contact with Harkness, with his exact whereabouts unknown.\n\nEventually Harkness once again returned to Earth on board a stolen spaceship in 2020. Attempting to warn the Doctor of the threat of the Lone Cyberman and his quest to restore the Cyber-Empire in the far future, he was only able to scoop up the companions of the Thirteenth Doctor during the an invasion of Judoon in Gloucester. Promising to find the Doctor again when she needed him, he told them of an alliance that sent something the Lone Cyberman was looking for back in time and that, should the Doctor find it, she must not give it to the Cyberman at any cost. He later proved true to his word, and rescued the Doctor from imprisonment at a Judoon prison, before assisting her and her companions in repelling the Daleks once more in 2021. With the threat of the Cybermen in the future already neutralised, Harkness went off to catch up with Gwen Cooper, his former teammate at Torchwood.\n\nAn important facet of Jack's existence on Earth was its temporal complexity. There were whole decades when multiple versions of Jack existed on Earth. Indeed, during the whole of the 20th century, there were always at least two Jacks on Earth since a younger version was a part of Torchwood Three and an older one was in a grave dug by his brother in ancient Britain. During the World War II era, Earth had at least one more Jack â€” the younger \"con artist\" who first met the Doctor and Rose.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJavic Piotr Thane was born before the year 5094[1] (TV: Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).) to Franklin and his wife. He had a younger brother called Gray. (TV: Adam [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).) He was raised on the Boeshane Peninsula (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) where he spent time with his brother and father playing cricket and singing around a campfire. (TV: Adam [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nOn what he would later call the worst day of his life, Javic fled from a host of creatures with Gray and lost him in the confusion when he accidentally let go of his hand. He returned home and found his mother crying over his father's body. He spent years looking for Gray without success, eventually burying the memory of what happened as well as his happy memories of his father. (TV: Adam [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nJavic persuaded his best friend to \"join up\" with him to fight the creatures. They were captured, and the enemy thought Javic's friend the weaker of the pair and tortured him as a lesson for Javic. They let Javic go, to bear the guilt of his friend's fate. (TV: Captain Jack Harkness [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2007).)\n\nIn 5094, Javic won the Rear of the Year award. (TV: Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nThe Time Agency[]\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nInfo from Month 25 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. needs to be added\n\nJavic was the first Boeshane resident to be signed up for the Time Agency, making him a \"poster boy\" for the area, known as the \"Face of Boe\". (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Going undercover during World War II in 1941, Javic assumed the identity of an American volunteer named Captain Jack Harkness, who had died in action the January prior. He knew very little about the real Jack, other than basic information such as the date and manner of his death. (TV: Captain Jack Harkness [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2007).)\n\nOn one of his first missions for the Time Agency, Jack fought the Navigators (COMIC: World Without End [+]John Barrowman and Carole E. Barrowman, Titan Comics' Torchwood comic series (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).) and went to a black market on Fluren's World to bid on a Monstrom Time Destroyer, but lost it to a pair of Wrightosaur mercenaries, whom he also had a sexual encounter with. (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) He later spent some time living as a Priest in the 17th century, under the alias of \"Father Julian Horst\". (COMIC: Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack worked as a Time Agent with John Hart, a partner both professionally and sexually. They once spent five years trapped in a two-week time loop, becoming the equivalent of a married couple after spending so much time together. Hart admitted to having been \"a good wife\", closing an argument between the two as to the details of the relationship. (TV: Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).) On another occasion, the two agents faced off against a horde of Weeping Angels. (COMIC: Secret Agent Man [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)\n\nOnce, when sentenced to death, Jack ordered four hypervodkas as a last meal and ended up bedding both executioners at the same time. He recalled them as a lovely couple who kept in touch. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile still a Time Agent, (COMIC: Secret Agent Man [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).) Jack acquired a small, sleek Chula warship fitted for human use, which could turn invisible. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nJack found that the Agency had erased two years of his memory, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) which other Time Agents like Hart refused to discuss with him. (COMIC: Secret Agent Man [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).) He left the Agency and became a time-travelling con artist, running scams using his knowledge of future events. His preferred schemes involved collecting payment for items he knew would be destroyed before the buyer could see it. Finding pieces of space junk and directing them to the soon-to-be disaster sites, Jack would sell them to passers-by, then allow the items to be destroyed before the buyers could pick up their merchandise. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAdventures with the Ninth Doctor[]\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nInfo from Doctormania, The Transformed, Official Secrets, Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Sin-Eaters, Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016)., Christmas Special & The Deviant Strain [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). needs to be added\n\nThough there are records of Jack having already been travelling with the Ninth Doctor when the Time Lord met Rose Tyler, (PROSE: Dr. Ninth [+]Adam Hargreaves, Dr. Men (Puffin Books, 2017).) the most common account of the Doctor and Jack's first encounter states that while running a scam involving a Chula ambulance in the London Blitz, Jack spotted Rose Tyler hanging from a barrage balloon. Just as she fell, he rescued her and took her aboard his ship. Deducing she came from the future, and thinking she was a Time Agent, he tried conning her into purchasing the ambulance. Upon meeting Rose's \"companion\", the Ninth Doctor, Jack realised that they were just freelancers like he was. The Doctor pointed out that the landing site of the ambulance was where the ground zero of the Empty Child plague started. Jack believed the object was empty space junk, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) but in fact, the ambulance contained nanogenes. The nanogenes had not seen a human before; they took the gas mask for the deceased child's face and fused it to him, spreading to other people who touched him, also transforming them into undead creatures with no life signs.\n\nJack teleported the Doctor and Rose to his warship to escape, and they went to the bombsite near the hospital, where they realised the truth. The ambulance started its emergency protocols, calling the creatures, who had been armed as \"Chula warriors\", and was ready to \"tear the world apart\" to find the boy's mother.\n\nEvery patient and soldier at the bombsite converged on the Doctor, Rose and Jack. The Doctor fixed the nanogenes' mistakes by comparing the DNA of the child and Nancy, who was his mother, restoring the infected zombies to normal. Jack stopped the bomb from hitting the bomb site by placing it in stasis inside his warship and when everyone got to safety, the Doctor destroyed the ambulance, making sure that history said that a bomb hit that location. The Doctor rescued Jack from his Chula warship just before it exploded, taking him aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion, to the delight of both Rose, who found Jack attractive, and Jack, who found both Rose and the Doctor attractive. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor took Rose and Jack to where the planet Excroth should have been but found it was gone. The TARDIS was taken aboard a Lect spaceship, but the Doctor and Jack escaped after it was attacked by Unon, after Jack shot one of them. However, Rose was blasted into the Time Vortex but was protected from the time winds by the tachyon inhibitor she found. Jack tracked Rose down to the Fluren Temporal Bazaar. The Doctor called the attention of the Unon but attracted the Lect who attacked one another, and which subsequently led to the emergency protocol being triggered, dissipating the time bubble protecting Fluren's World. Separated from Rose, Jack, in the TARDIS, was captured and taken to the Unon's Perpetual City, where he reunited with the Doctor, who he believed to have died.\n\nArnora, mother superior of the Unon, tricked the Doctor into coming to the planet Traxis with Jack, and the Doctor used a temporal stabiliser to seal a time fissure. After Rose tricked the Doctor into giving the co-ordinates of the Perpetual City to the Lect, Evja, the Grand High Seer of the Unon, took Jack to a sub-dimensional void. In the void, Jack saw what future would come if the Doctor wasn't around and the Unon was in charge of time. Released from the void, Jack and Evja saved the Doctor. After Arnora was killed by the Lect, the Doctor, unable to stop the overloading entropy engine, took as many Unon as he could to another world so they could start again. (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nVisiting the Eye of Orion, Jack, Rose and the Doctor found a giant ziggurat and the Hanging Gardens of Slarvia, which had been destroyed centuries before. The Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to discover a ship in orbit, which transmatted them on board and brought them face to face with Taggani, the most famous geohacker in history. They stopped him from using the Doctor's memories to recreate everything lost in the Last Great Time War, and exposed his true identity as an art historian from the Braxiatel Collection before handing him over to the Judoon. (COMIC: Hacked [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile on Clix, Jack and the Doctor disguised themselves as Slitheens to find Rose, who had been kidnapped by Slist Fayflut Marteveerthon Slitheen. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe trio shared numerous adventures together, including encountering Russian special forces and the Novrosk spaceship. (PROSE: The Deviant Strain [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nJack later spent a month in 2006 Bromley, helping a Neanderthal named Das to fit in with 21st century society. (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS became powerless to travel through time, the three travellers stopped off in Cardiff in 2006 so that the TARDIS could refuel via a scar in a rift running through the city. Whilst in Cardiff, Jack met Rose's estranged boyfriend, Mickey Smith. Together, they captured Blon, the sole Slitheen survivor of a prior attack on 10 Downing Street who had become Lord Mayor. When the TARDIS was refuelled, they stopped off at Raxacoricofallapatorius to return her home. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAfterwards, they visited Arkannis Major in 2775, where Jack was committed to an asylum for telling fictional stories. (PROSE: The Stealers of Dreams [+]Steve Lyons, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nAt some point, the Doctor, Rose and Jack went to New Vegas in the 23rd century, where they assisted detective James McNeil to investigate The Whisper, a strange vigilante that had terrorised the city's underworld. This involved Jack working undercover as a reporter for the Daily Galaxy, where he befriended Daisy Hewett, but she later betrayed him to Mafia boss Cyrus Wolfsbane, who kidnapped Jack so that the Doctor would lead him to the Whisper, with Cyrus subsequently killing the Whisper. (AUDIO: Night of the Whisper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter visiting Kyoto, Japan in 1336, Jack, the Doctor and Rose were abducted by transmat beams, and awoke on the Game Station. Jack found himself on a makeover game show hosted by Trine-E and Zu-Zana. When the android hosts threatened him, he shot them, and improvised a more powerful gun out of their defabricator.\n\nJack met up with the Doctor and an escapee from the deadly games, Lynda Moss, and tracked down Rose. They raced to save Rose from The Weakest Link hosted by a deadly Anne Droid; they were unsuccessful in preventing the Anne Droid from seemingly killing Rose. Completely heartbroken, Jack was tempted to shoot the staff behind the games and threatened to kill the guards when they arrested the Doctor and Lynda, only to get arrested himself for breaking in and out of the games. However, he and the Doctor physically overpowered the guards and set off to stop the deadly \"entertainment\".\n\nTaking \"hostages\" in the control room, Jack found the TARDIS stowed away in an archive room. Using the TARDIS, he discovered the laser that \"killed\" the games' losers was actually teleporting them across space. Puzzled, the Doctor discovered that the Game Station was unknowingly broadcasting a secondary signal to an empty location of space, which was where all the losers ended up. Disabling the signal, the Doctor was horrified to find two hundred Dalek battleships. Establishing contact, the Doctor learned his old foes had taken Rose hostage, but promised the Daleks that he would rescue her and destroy them for the final time. (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nJack and the Doctor flew the TARDIS into the Dalek mothership, rescued Rose and discovered the Dalek Emperor was controlling the Game Station and turning the contestants into Daleks. Returning to the Game Station to prepare for the battle ahead, Jack formed a resistance group consisting of contestants and staff members to fight the Daleks. Knowing he was fighting a losing battle and would most certainly perish, Jack kissed Rose and the Doctor goodbye. In the ensuing battle, all of the resistance were killed and the Doctor sent Rose home in the TARDIS. Now the last man fighting, Jack was killed defending the satellite against the Daleks as they attacked the Game Station, and seemingly accepted his death. Rose Tyler, while holding the powers of the Time Vortex which turned her into the Bad Wolf, returned to the Game Station, destroyed the Daleks, and resurrected Jack. The TARDIS departed before Jack could rejoin them since his new immortal nature perverted the Laws of Time, and would interfere with the operations of the TARDIS. He was left stranded on the satellite. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Rose couldn't control her powers and had brought Jack back to life forever, making him immortal, and as the Doctor claimed, a fixed point in time. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nShortly following the Doctor's regeneration going wrong, Rose suggested going back to find Jack, thinking he might be able to help; the Doctor claimed that he was busy rebuilding the Earth, not yet wishing to tell her the truth about what had just happened. (TV: Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nSomehow making his way to the ravaged Earth, Jack, though recognised as a hero for his fight against the Daleks, chose to live as a recluse in a small cabin located near the ruins of the Black Country Dome. A year passed, and Jack found himself approached by Silo Crook, an aspiring reporter. Though Jack vehemently wished to be left alone, both shared a suspicion of the Hope Foundation, a charity founded by Vortia Trear ostensibly to take the surviving humans off Earth and give them new, better lives. Sneaking aboard Trear Station, repurposed from the Game Station along with several starliners and a couple of freight ships, Jack reunited with Silo and found that Vortia was part of a rich elite which had always looked out for themselves and intended to exploit those below them. In the ensuing revolt, Trear was deposed and the station was left falling to Earth, forcing Jack to interact with live cables to land it safely. Reviving after being electrocuted, Jack reasoned that the universe liked him and saw that an abundance of resources was salvaged from the grounded station, confident that humanity would ultimately rebuild itself. (AUDIO: The Year After I Died [+]Guy Adams, The Lives of Captain Jack (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nLife on past Earth[]\n\n19th century[]\n\nEventually, Jack used the vortex manipulator in his Time Agency wrist strap to return to Cardiff, the site of an active space-time rift. Jack knew that the TARDIS could refuel itself using the rift, and therefore attempted to reach there in the early 21st century so that he could find the Doctor again. However, Jack ended up in 1869, and his vortex manipulator burned out, leaving him stranded. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nJack stayed in Cardiff, choosing to continue using the Harkness alias (or at least using it when he started working for Torchwood Three). (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).) His third death and resurrection occurred when he was shot in 1892 during a fight on Ellis Island. Jack found that he still aged, but very slowly â€” he noted that he had a couple of grey hairs in the 2000s,[nb 1] over 100 years after arriving in Cardiff (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) â€” and could recover from any degree of physical harm, including death itself, given a few minutes time. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nIn 1898, Jack went to the music hall performance of Anthony Bradshaw, also known as \"the Wonder of 1898\", who could foretell the future through his invisible friend the Lawphoram. Jack asked him, \"how will I die?\" and Anthony did not know. When Edward Hardiman, Anthony's \"uncle\", tried to leave the theatre, Jack stopped him, and told him to scram after buying Anthony from a workhouse the previous year. Jack forced the Lawphoram, a creature from the future which was feeding on Anthony's mind, out of Anthony using the vortex manipulator on Jack's wrist. He cradled Anthony, promising him he'd be all right. (PROSE: Best Friends [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2007).)\n\nIn 1899, Torchwood Cardiff agents Alice Guppy and Emily Holroyd found out about Jack. They captured and tortured him to discover why he could not die and what connection he had to the Doctor, who the Torchwood Institute had designated an enemy. After telling them that the Doctor was a hero who would save them from aliens, Jack was released on the condition that he undertake a mission for Torchwood. Jack was sent to stop a criminal Blowfish, which he returned to Torchwood Three's Hub, only to see it killed by a shot to the head. Disgusted by Torchwood's methods, Jack walked away from the organisation. He ended up in a bar, where he drowned his sorrows alone until a young cartomancer offered to read him his fortune. She gave a completely accurate prophecy of the Doctor's eventual return to Cardiff 100 years into the future. Left with nothing to do but wait for a full century until his version of the Doctor coincided with his timeline, Jack reconsidered Torchwood's offer and began working for them and awaiting the Doctor's return.\n\nJack continued working for Torchwood for over a hundred years, still pursuing his goal of finding the Doctor in the meantime. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nShortly after this, Jack and the rest of Torchwood infiltrated and destroyed the HMS Hades after it was found to be a lab for experimenting on aliens. (PROSE: The Baby Farmers [+]David Llewellyn, Consequences (2009).)\n\nOn 17 May 1899, Jack was temporarily working with the London branch of Torchwood based at the Natural History Museum. The Life-stealer escaped custody and started feeding on the youth of Londoners at the same time Torchwood was being visited by Queen Victoria for her annual inspection of the Institute, resulting in him sharing an adventure with the Queen as she took to pursuing the creature. After Victoria killed the creature by exploiting its weakness against the elderly, Jack declined her offer to take command of Torchwood London, the position having been left vacant when its previous director was rendered rapidly aged permanently incapacitated, telling her that his place was in Cardiff. (AUDIO: The Victorian Age [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack went to China during the Boxer Rebellion, where he worked with explosives. (TV: The Blood Line [+]Russell T Davies and Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack presented Torchwoodâ€˜s findings about Object 1 to Queen Victoria. She ordered him to get rid of it by throwing it into the Rift. He took it back to Cardiff but neglected to follow her orders, hoping the Object's temporal effects might attract the Doctor. (AUDIO: The Torchwood Archive [+]James Goss, Torchwood - Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\n20th century[]\n\nIn 1902, Jack investigated strange visions at Ravenhall Manor, a Gothic 18th century house. He defeated the creature responsible. (COMIC: Hell House [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 1906, Jack set up a bank account, the interest of which would lead to a small fortune by 2011. (TV: Dead of Night [+]Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).) In the same year, Jack began two affairs with a couple called Alison and Miles, and even attended their wedding. On the same day, Miles drowned Alison and turned himself into the police, leaving Jack to face the guilt of his role in their volatile demises. (PROSE: The House That Jack Built [+]Guy Adams, BBC Torchwood novels (BBC Books, 2009).)\n\nIn 1909, Jack was travelling through Lahore by train with a group of soldiers under his command, when they were killed by Fairies. Some of the soldiers had recently run over and killed one of the Fairies' Chosen Ones. In revenge, the Fairies suffocated the soldiers by forcing rose petals down their throats. (TV: Small Worlds [+]Peter J. Hammond, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nIn 1914, he investigated strange disappearances in Tiger Bay and discovered that the missing sailors were becoming Weevils. He realised that this must have had something to do with Object 1 and finally threw it into the Rift. (AUDIO: The Torchwood Archive [+]James Goss, Torchwood - Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) Jack later left Torchwood to fight in World War I. (TV: To the Last Man [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nIn 1914, during the Christmas truce, Jack was recovering in a hospital after surviving a bullet to the head. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nJack was present at Gallipoli during the Gallipoli campaign. By this point he was wearing a battered coat which had sustained several holes as a result of gunfire. He was responsible for saving the life of Ata, an Ottoman soldier, while warding off a creature which fed on fear in times of war. While doing so, Jack was killed twice, first from a gunshot inflicted by Ata when he initially approached him, then again by Ottoman forces when they recovered Ata. (AUDIO: What Have I Done? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack fought in the Battle of Passchendaele and the Battle of the Somme. (TV: To the Last Man [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nIn 1918, Gerald Carter and Harriet Derbyshire brought in Tommy Brockless to be put in suspended animation and use him as a key to fix time shifts happening then and in the 21st century. At some point after this, Jack retrieved instructions on what to do with Tommy in a box temporally locked until the Rift met the same conditions as in 1918. Jack witnessed Tommy being awakened each year to see if he \"still worked\". (TV: To the Last Man [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).) Jack was witness to the Spanish Influenza Epidemic of 1918, which killed 5% of the human race. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Four [+]John Fay, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nIn 1919, Jack assisted in convicting Roderick Simonsen, though he was unaware of the true nature of Simonsen's crimes. (PROSE: They Keep Killing Andy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the 1920s, to investigate the Night Travellers, Jack joined a travelling show in which he was billed as \"the man who couldn't die\". (TV: From Out of the Rain [+]Peter J. Hammond, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).) In 1924, Jack was sent to shut Torchwood India down. During his stay in Delhi, he had a brief fling with Torchwood India's leader, Eleanor. He arranged for all their alien artefacts to be transported back to Britain (AUDIO: Golden Age [+]James Goss, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (2009).) except for Object 1, which the angry Eleanor had sent to him anyway. (AUDIO: The Torchwood Archive [+]James Goss, Torchwood - Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nIn 1927, Jack went to New York City on a mission to stop the Trickster's Brigade from infecting President Roosevelt's brain with a parasite. When he arrived at Ellis Island, Jack met Angelo Colasanto. The two stayed in a room in New York together and had sex. Comparing Angelo to one of the Doctor's companions, the two went to the warehouse where the parasite was being kept and killed it. As the two tried to escape, however, Jack was killed and Angelo was captured and taken to jail.\n\nThe next year, after Angelo got out of jail, Jack returned claiming that he had only been playing dead. Angelo didn't believe Jack, however, and assumed that Jack was the Devil. Angelo stabbed Jack and was shocked when Jack came back to life. Jack was then chained up and repeatedly killed, since people assumed that his immortality was either a miracle or a blessing. Jack then saw three men come to the room where he was chained, but he never learned who they were. Angelo decided to help Jack escape, but Jack jumped off of a building and disappeared from Angelo's life. (TV: Immortal Sins [+]Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack later fought in World War II. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He claimed to have been a prisoner of war on a German U-Boat for a couple of weeks, during which time he seduced a number of the submariners. (PROSE: Plant Life [+]Trevor Baxendale, Torchwood (2008).) During the war, he met Estelle Cole. The pair became lovers and spent some time in London together. She wanted to spend the rest of her life with him. Somehow, however, this never happened, and they lost touch with one another. (TV: Small Worlds [+]Peter J. Hammond, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nIn the 1950s Jack discovered that members of Torchwood Three were selling alien artefacts at auctions in Cardiff. To put a stop to this he flooded the market with fake artefacts, destroying the buyers' demand. (PROSE: The Beauty of Our Weapons [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 1955, Jack was burnt to death whilst trying to save Hugo and other men infected with Invictus. He revived in a room with Norton Folgate, whom he blamed for what happened. Norton eventually won him around and they had a sexual relationship, (AUDIO: Prodromal: Love [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) also coming up with a plan should Good Thinking ever be used again, inserting a trojan horse into Jack's personal data. (AUDIO: Invasion: Kill [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 1965, the alien race known as the 456, communicating through radio, set up a deal: Jack, with the involvement of Andrew Staines, Ellen Hunt and Michael Sanders, would deliver to them twelve young orphans as a \"gift\" at a meeting point in Scotland. In exchange for the children, the unseen aliens would give them a cure for a new strain of an Indonesian flu that the aliens claimed would mutate and kill twenty-five million people. Jack received the assignment specifically because of his immortality, and the perception, as one of the officers later told him, that he \"didn't care.\" Despite his misgivings, Jack followed his orders, and delivered the children. Clement McDonald, however, slipped away from the exchange, and had nightmares about Jack for the rest of his life. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Four [+]John Fay, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nIn the 1970s, Jack sported a moustache. (TV: End of the Road [+]Ryan Scott and Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).) He dated Stella Courtney for five weeks. (AUDIO: The Dead Line [+]Phil Ford, adapted from Deadline, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (2009).)\n\nIn 1975, Jack and another Torchwood agent, Lucia Moretti, had a daughter, Melissa Moretti, who aged normally. Lucia and Jack split up sometime prior to 1977, and at the request of her mother, their daughter was sent into the Witness Protection Program, relocated and given the name of Alice Sangster, presumably arising from her mother's fear of the immortal Captain Jack. The application was approved on 14 February, 1977; however, Jack eventually rebuilt a relationship with his daughter. Although Jack was a Torchwood agent at the time, he was still considered a freelance operative rather than a full-time employee. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Three [+]Russell T Davies and James Moran, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nOn several occasions during the 1990s, Jack visited the Powell Estate to watch Rose Tyler grow up, but did not approach her to avoid disrupting her timeline. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAt some point during the 20th century, Jack found a Rehabilitator and documented it in Torchwood's archives. (PROSE: Kaleidoscope [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt another point, he briefly met the author Arthur Machen and found him to be an interesting man. Jack later revealed himself to be familiar with Machen's writing. (PROSE: The Wrong Hands [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAround Christmas 1999, Jack dropped a truck on the Millennium Bug. (AUDIO: The Torchwood Archive [+]James Goss, Torchwood - Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nEarly 21st century[]\n\nOn New Year's Day 2000, Jack, now a full-time agent for Torchwood Three, suffered a major emotional blow when one of his colleagues, Alex Hopkins, suffered a nervous breakdown and killed the entire Torchwood Three staff. Knowing Jack couldn't die, he did not attempt to kill Jack and waited for him to arrive at the Hub before committing suicide. As the only surviving member of Torchwood Three, he spent the next few years recruiting new members. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nAfter taking over, Jack found two people the Rift had taken and later returned to Cardiff inside the vaults. He established an institution for them on Flat Holm Island, and told the careers there that they, and others that came through, were experiments gone wrong. (TV: Adrift [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nOver several years Jack rebuilt his decimated organisation. He headhunted weapons expert Suzie Costello to come to Cardiff to join (AUDIO: Moving Target [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and later recruited Toshiko Sato from UNIT imprisonment. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).) Sebastian Vaughan joined the team thanks to his father, a Cabinet minister. (AUDIO: The Vigil [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2004, Torchwood Three shutdown an Ovid factory making duplicates of a village's population in South Wales. Suzie found Object 1 in the factory, so Jack had her phone Yvonne Hartman to pass it on to Torchwood One. (AUDIO: The Torchwood Archive [+]James Goss, Torchwood - Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nJack was present in the Hub on 26 March 2005 when it was temporarily frozen in a time bubble for a day by Torchwood One's Rajesh Singh so that director Yvonne Hartman could procure a Drahvin scanner from the Hub unhindered. Yvonne observed the frozen Jack, noting this was the first time they had met, though he was unable to notice her. She commented that his photographs did not do him justice. Understanding that Jack did not work \"for Queen and Country\", Yvonne regarded him as a liability and \"not Torchwood\" and would soon after arrange for the new Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Barry Jackson, to inform her when the Doctor appeared in Cardiff, knowing that Jack would not. (AUDIO: One Rule [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack met Dr Owen Harper when he dealt with an alien parasite which had inhabited the brain of Owen's fiancÃ©e Katie Russell under the guise of a tumour before revealing itself during surgery, with Jack being forced to sedate Owen when he refused to let him recover her body before altering security footage to remove all traces of himself. Jack later went to observe, from a distance, Owen standing by Katie's grave following her funeral. He was seen by Owen, who angrily rushed towards and attacked him before breaking down in his arms. After Owen calmed down, Jack offered Owen a job with Torchwood Three, so he could save people and find purpose without Katie. Owen reluctantly accepted. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nJack's activities at the time of the Blaidd Drwg incident in Cardiff in September 2006, which involved Jack's younger, mortal self, (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) included keeping the entire Torchwood team on lockdown in the Hub, to prevent them from seeing his younger self, and vice versa. (PROSE: The Twilight Streets [+]Gary Russell, BBC Torchwood novels (BBC Books, 2008).)\n\nAfter Torchwood One's old regime was \"destroyed\" in the Battle of Canary Wharf, Jack rebuilt and changed Torchwood's organisation. Within a few years,[nb 1] there was a half dozen of them left. He later told the Tenth Doctor that he did this in the Doctor's honour. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) In the 2000s,[nb 2] he took in Ianto Jones, a survivor of Torchwood One, after some heavy persuasion by Ianto himself. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).) At some point afterwards, Sebastian Vaughan was killed by a cortex leech. (AUDIO: The Vigil [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDuring this time, Jack held on to the hope of re-establishing contact with the Doctor, who he believed could help him. At some point after Torchwood One destroyed the Sycorax ship in 2006 under orders from Prime Minister Harriet Jones, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) Jack obtained a severed hand that had fallen from the Sycorax craft and which was identified as having belonged to the Tenth Doctor. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He kept the hand in a portable container in Torchwood Three's nerve centre, the Hub, and treated it as a prized possession, much to the occasional consternation of his colleagues. (TV: Everything Changes [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006)., Day One [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nThe team had been testing the resurrection gauntlet on a series of murders which unknown to Jack were committed by Suzie to make her understand the glove further. At a hospital, he helped capture a Weevil. Police Constable Gwen Cooper began investigating Jack and followed him from the hospital to Torchwood. He showed her around the Hub, then laced a drink with retcon to make her forget about everything.\n\nAfter Suzie was exposed as a serial murderer, she tried escaping by shooting Jack, but when he revived, she shot herself. Jack recruited Gwen, whose memories had resurfaced, as Torchwood's newest member. Gwen became the only person on the team who knew of Jack's immortality. (TV: Everything Changes [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nJack chased after a meteorite containing the sex gas creature, where Gwen had accidentally released it. He tricked the gas creature into leaving Carys Fletcher and entering the Torchwood portable prison cell. The entity was poisoned by Earth's atmosphere and died. (TV: Day One [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nAs Gwen was a \"beat cop\", and untrained in firearms, Jack trained her to protect herself. (TV: Day One [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006)., Ghost Machine [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nJack helped Gwen and Owen capture a quantum transducer Bernie Harris had been carrying. He later confiscated the alien artefacts Bernie had been trying to sell. He failed to prevent the death of Ed Morgan Gwen indirectly foresaw with the transducer. Jack then ordered the transducer locked away. (TV: Ghost Machine [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nIanto had hidden the partially-converted Cyberman Lisa Hallett inside the Torchwood Hub. Jack and the others managed to bypass the Hub's lockdown and escape, but Ianto rushed back for his girlfriend. After Lisa had placed her brain inside the body of another human, the rest of the team had no choice but to kill her. (TV: Cyberwoman [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).) Sometime later, Jack asked Ianto how he was after Lisa's death and took him on a Weevil hunt. (AUDIO: Broken [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack re-encountered the same fairies that had killed his men in Lahore. He saw them kill Estelle Cole and he prevented Gwen from stopping Jasmine Pierce, their new Chosen One, from joining their ranks as they could have destroyed the Earth. His team turned their backs on him after this, angry at his decision. (TV: Small Worlds [+]Peter J. Hammond, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nJack and Ianto worked together against an incursion of Scorchies at the Millennium Centre. Afterwards Ianto confessed he wanted to be more involved in the team and Jack promised to try to help with that. (AUDIO: Broken [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Torchwood team travelled to the Welsh countryside to investigate a series of disappearances, fearing the Rift was expanding. The Torchwood SUV was stolen by a group of cannibals that harvested travellers once every ten years. The team followed the cannibals to their village. Right as his team were captured, Jack stepped in and incapacitated the cannibals with a shotgun. The cannibals were arrested by the police. (TV: Countrycide [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).) He asked Ianto how he was coping a few days later, as Tosh had been reporting having nightmares. (AUDIO: Broken [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Torchwood team discovered a teleporter buried in the ground for two hundred years, alongside a corpse of a soldier with his heart ripped out. An Arcateenian called Mary threatened Tosh's life, demanding her transporter back. Jack reprogrammed Mary's teleporter as he handed it back and she was teleported straight into the Sun. (TV: Greeks Bearing Gifts [+]Toby Whithouse, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).) That night he went to The Ferret to investigate disappearances and possible Rift activity and encountered Ianto in the pub. Despite Ianto's requests for him to stay away, he followed him when the barmaid Mandy took him to meet the Saviour. Jack knew what the Saviour really was and that his race were slave traders. Distressed at Mandy's betrayal, Ianto pushed him into the rift which the Saviour had opened. Ianto then regretted his decision and went to retrieve him from the camp. Afterwards they had a proper talk about what Ianto was going through and began a relationship. (AUDIO: Broken [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack decided to investigate the conspiracy theorist George Wilson who talked about the Committee, as he knew that the Committee actually existed. He posed as an investigator for Plexus Magazine to attend one of Wilson's conferences where he met by accident with Sam Hallett who recognised him. He managed to get an interview from Kate Wilson with her father. He learnt about the different phases that George believed the Committee was arranging. He then spent his time looking through video footage of George learning more about him. During his research he was contacted by Sam and Jack was forced to watch Sam commit suicide. He went to Wilson to find out why Sam was killed. Jack learnt what Wilson thought he had made it all up, though Jack knew some of it was true. He found out that Kate was a member of the Committee and that they knew all about him. Kate told him that she was feeding enough information to George to make the humans believe the conspiracy and that they were doing this to make the humans complacent. He then went AWOL from Torchwood for a while to investigate them, leaving a recording for the rest of the team to explain his disappearance. (AUDIO: The Conspiracy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack decided to investigate Neil Redmond after learning Kate had escaped the country in one of his private's jets, learning about his doppelganger NJ. He investigated Neil's crash and traced mysterious things following the accident. Talking with Neil, he discovered that Eve Trent from Ovid Industries had supplied him with the doppelganger. He told Neil that his actions had cost a lot of people their lives. Neil detailed how he got the robot to take over his operations and his social life, but he started to resent him. Jack informed Neil that NJ was going rogue and dealing with terrorists. He later met with NJ who tried to seduce him and succeeded. After having sex with NJ he told Neil to shut him down but this didn't work. NJ attacked Jack after this and killed him. After Jack came back to life he managed to destroy NJ, but not before NJ confirmed that he was made by the Committee and that the Committee weren't invading the Earth, they had been invited. Jack decided he couldn't do this alone and rejoined Torchwood. (AUDIO: Uncanny Valley [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile investigating a murder case with Suzie's involvement, Gwen revived Suzie using the resurrection gauntlet, and started having her life drained by the constant link the gauntlet maintained between them. After shooting her achieved nothing, Jack ordered Tosh to destroy the gauntlet, killing Suzie and saving Gwen's life. (TV: They Keep Killing Suzie [+]Paul Tomalin and Dan McCulloch, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nWhen Gwen was investigating the death of Eugene Jones, Jack tried to make her stop but she refused. Jack was later present when Eugene reappeared to save Gwen's life from a speeding car. Jack thanked Gwen for not giving up on Eugene. (TV: Random Shoes [+]Jacquetta May, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nAt some point in 2007, Jack was kidnapped by the Three Families. Gwen came looking for him and was also captured. They were transported to Chernobyl, where the Families extracted blood samples from Jack, and used retcon gas to remove his and Gwen's memories of the event. This event would prove significant later. (TV: Miracle Day [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., WC: Web of Lies [+]Jane Espenson and Ryan Scott, 2011.)\n\nJack saw John Ellis, Emma-Louise Cowell and Diane Holmes come through the Rift from 1953 Earth in the Sky Gypsy. He befriended John, as he was also a man out of his own time. As John had nothing left to live for, he committed suicide. Unable to convince John to continue living, Jack held his hand as the car fumes overwhelmed John. (TV: Out of Time [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nJack shut down a Weevil Fight Club, freed the Weevil captive there and saved Owen's life. Owen chastised Jack for saving him, saying that he felt \"totally at peace\". (TV: Combat [+]Noel Clarke, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2006).)\n\nTosh and Jack investigated music from the 1940s playing from the Ritz. The Rift brought them back to 1941, where they met Jack's namesake. Jack bonded with the real Jack over war stories and inadvertently complicated his relationship with Nancy Floyd. The two Jacks had a brief romance. Owen opened the Rift with the Rift Manipulator to return Jack and Tosh to the 21st century. (TV: Captain Jack Harkness [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2007).)\n\nThe opening of the Rift brought diseases and people across time and space so Jack felt forced to dismiss Owen. Owen later returned and shot Jack; through Bilis Manger's manipulations, Owen re-opened the Rift to send everything back. Jack resurrected and the rest of his team learnt of his immortality.\n\nAfter the Rift was opened, Jack was forced to confront Abaddon. Abbadon was destroyed while attempting to leech Jack's life, though the exertion resulted in Jack remaining dead for days, his immortality apparently unable to save him. He was brought back to life after a kiss from Gwen.\n\nA short while after his resurrection, Jack noticed the Doctor's hand begin to glow. From inside of the Hub, Jack recognised the sound of the TARDIS materialising, elated, after decades of waiting, by the knowledge that the young cartomancer's prophecy had been fulfilled and that a version of the Doctor he knew was returning to refuel. By the time the rest of the Torchwood team arrived to investigate the sound, Jack had gone. (TV: End of Days [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 1 (BBC Three, 2007).)\n\nReunion with the Doctor[]\n\nThis section needs a cleanup.\n\nCharacter pages are not the place for plot summaries. A brief 2-3 sentence summary per story is all that is needed.\n\nHaving heard the TARDIS, Jack left the Hub with the Doctor's hand in a backpack. Rushing to where it was parked, he managed to jump onto the ship before it dematerialised, clinging on as it travelled through the time vortex to the year 100,000,000,000,000. The Doctor and Jack had an awkward reunion, owing both to the Doctor's regeneration into his tenth incarnation since they last met and the fact the Ninth Doctor had abandoned him on Satellite Five. Before long the Doctor admitted that he had run from Jack because his unique nature as a living temporal anomaly made the Time Lord physically uncomfortable when near him â€” even looking at Jack was an effort. Jack made the happy discovery, though, that Rose had not been killed in the Battle of Canary Wharf as he had believed. They met and helped Professor Yana to repair a spaceship in order to help the last humans in the universe reach Utopia. After Yana became the War Master, who regenerated into a new body and took off in the TARDIS with the Doctor's hand still inside, Jack, the Doctor and the Doctor's companion Martha Jones were left stranded at the end of the universe to be killed by the Futurekind. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAfter the Doctor fixed Jack's vortex manipulator, the trio used it to escape the Futurekind and travel back to the 2000s,[nb 1] where they discovered the Master, using the alias \"Harold Saxon\", had been elected Great Britain's Prime Minister. He framed them for terrorism, planting explosives in Martha's flat. He also made sure that Jack couldn't get help from his Torchwood team by sending them to the Himalayas \"on a wild goose chase\". With nowhere to go, Jack, the Doctor and Martha went on the run.\n\nOn board the Master's airship, the Valiant, the Doctor discovered his TARDIS had been turned into a paradox machine. After failing to foil the Master's plot, the Master summoned the Toclafane, whom he ordered to assassinate US President Arthur Winters, attack the Earth, and decimate the population. He then killed Jack and aged the Doctor with his laser screwdriver. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) As the Toclafane began slaughtering the population, Jack, realising they couldn't stop the Master, told Martha to escape using his vortex manipulator. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nBeing kept prisoner aboard the Valiant for a year, Jack, the Doctor and the Jones family witnessed the Master and the Toclafane devastate Earth's civilisations and reduce the human race to camps of survivors, and suffered at his hands themselves. Bound in chains aboard the Valiant, the thing that kept Jack going during the year of hell was the thought of getting back to his Torchwood team.\n\nWhen Martha allowed herself to be taken to the Master, she and the Doctor revealed their plan; using the Archangel Network, the Doctor harnessed the psychic energy of humanity's hope, as Martha had spent a year travelling the world telling humanity about his importance to them. On the Doctor's orders, Jack destroyed the paradox machine keeping the Toclafane in the present, undoing the entire year; Earth was restored as time resumed for everyone else right after the President was killed, but those on the Valiant retained their memories due to being at the \"eye of the storm\". After the Master's death, the Doctor offered Jack the opportunity to end his long exile on Earth and join him in the TARDIS, but out of loyalty to his Torchwood team, he decided to stay in Cardiff. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nReturn to Torchwood Three[]\n\nJack returned to Torchwood and the team, while they were on a mission in the 2000s,[nb 3] saving the life of a woman being menaced by a Blowfish.\n\nHe quickly had yet another visit from the past, this time even further back; Jack was reunited with Captain John Hart from his Time Agent days, who had come through the Rift searching for some canisters that had also come through. Captain John told Torchwood that they contained radioactive bombs. John tricked Jack, pushing him off the top of an office building and taking the canister. Jack caught up with John, but the contents of the canisters were actually components of a bomb that latched onto the DNA of the owner of the canisters' murderer. Jack confused the bomb by injecting John with the DNA of the Torchwood team and safely disposed of it. Jack then asked John to leave. As he did so, he told Jack that he had found Gray. (TV: Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nTorchwood took in Beth Halloran on suspicion over the deaths of two burglars. Jack ordered a mind probe on her, and her true identity, the sleeper agent Kayehla Janees, surfaced. Once Tosh deactivated the link, an advance guard of Cell 114 attacked Cardiff. Jack and Gwen stopped \"David\" from attacking a stockpile of nuclear warheads. Before David committed suicide, he told Jack the rest of Cell 114 had already arrived on Earth and factored Torchwood into their plans. Rather than let her sleeper agent form take over, Beth pretended to threaten Gwen and Torchwood killed her. (TV: Sleeper [+]James Moran, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nJack and Ianto tracked a Cell 114 signal to Serenity Plaza and went undercover to track the sleeper agent. Pretending to be an idyllic couple, Jack went off to work each day returning to the hub, whilst Ianto stayed at home. When Mary thought Jack was attracted to her husband Bob he played along. Once the sleepers had activated, they found their control centre and Jack devised a way to completely wipe out Cell 114. (AUDIO: Serenity [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Ianto discovered an alien artefact was missing from the archive, Gwen and Tosh tracked it down to a Cardiff hotel. When Jack arrived he recognised the artefact as a nuclear bomb, and proposed the team return to the hotel later on, to steal the artefact and cast it into the Rift. (PROSE: The Beauty of Our Weapons [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack reawakened Tommy Brockless for the last time. Time shifts at St Teilo's Hospital started occurring and Jack's instructions to send Tommy and Toshiko back opened. Jack gave Tommy a small Rift Manipulator in order to close the time shifts. Toshiko then projected an image of herself to Tommy to tell him how to use the \"key\". (TV: To the Last Man [+]Helen Raynor, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nGwen's fiancÃ© Rhys Williams discovered the true nature of Gwen's job. Jack gave Rhys a brief tour at Torchwood and used his position as a transport manager to sneak into Harries & Harries. An alien that could replenish its cells indefinitely was being mutilated there so its meat could be sold. Jack saw Owen mercy kill the creature and felt sorry for it. Torchwood then had its workers retconned and the alien incinerated. Jack asked Gwen to give Rhys retcon, but she refused. (TV: Meat [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nThe memory-altering creature Adam Smith altered Torchwood Three's memories, making them think he had been a team member for years. After doing this, Jack's memories of Gray and his father resurfaced. Jack realised that all the memories of Adam were false and that Adam's files only dated back 48 hours. Torchwood Three took retcon and erased all trace of Adam's existence on file. (TV: Adam [+]Catherine Tregenna, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nJack invited Martha onto the team to investigate the Pharm, a medical organisation that could cure diseases thought incurable. He ordered Toshiko to close the Pharm down once he learnt of their mistreatment of humans and aliens alike, but the Pharm's manager, Aaron Copley, shot Owen and then Jack shot him. (TV: Reset [+]J. C. Wilsher, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nUnwilling to accept the loss of another teammate, Jack tracked down the other resurrection gauntlet and brought back Owen. The attempt, though successful, left Owen unable to digest food, sleep, or enjoy sex. In addition, the glove released an extradimensional alien, Duroc, the embodiment of death. Owen saved the day by using his new condition to stifle the needs of the entity, but still expressed a deep resentment towards Jack. (TV: Dead Man Walking [+]Matt Jones, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nA regretful Jack was forced to temporarily relieve Owen until he could acclimatise. Jack later had Owen retrieve the Pulse from an ailing Henry Parker. Owen became medical officer again after Martha had taken over for Owen to acclimatise, and Jack kissed Martha goodbye. (TV: A Day in the Death [+]Joseph Lidster, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nGwen was impregnated by a Nostrovite Jack had killed. She decided against postponing her wedding to Rhys. The biological mother, \"Carrie\", tried forcibly taking her unborn child from Gwen's womb and Jack was forced to stop the wedding. Rhys killed the child that was killing Gwen with the singularity scalpel, while Jack killed the Nostrovite mother. The wedding proceeded and Jack put retcon inside the wedding guests' drinks. (TV: Something Borrowed [+]Phil Ford, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nJack, feeling stuck on Earth, met Val Ross and attended some of the lectures at the Church of the Outsiders. However, he turned against them after Davey Russell's suicide, manipulating Val into spreading footage of his resurrection and turning the Church into a laughing stock. He also saved Cardiff by telling Andromeda Ross that nobody cared about the message she sent through the Rift. (AUDIO: Believe [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Night Travellers escaped from a reel of film playing inside the Electro and took the last breaths of people in Cardiff. As more of the Travellers began to leave, Jack captured the Travellers, which were made from the same material as the film, onto a camera and destroyed the negatives by exposing them to light. Before he was destroyed, the Ghostmaker threw the flask containing the breaths and all but one of the victims died. (TV: From Out of the Rain [+]Peter J. Hammond, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nJack warned Gwen not to investigate the disappearance of Jonah Bevan, who unknown to Gwen had been taken away by the Rift. Ianto gave Gwen a GPS that pointed her towards Flat Holm and she found Jonah was inside, forty years older. Jack explained to Gwen what had happened to those taken to Flat Holm. Despite his protests, Gwen showed Nikki her ill son and how he screamed for most of each day. (TV: Adrift [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nJack's team came under further pressure when Captain John Hart returned, laying bombs within a warehouse in an attempt to kill all of the Torchwood Three team. This failed and Jack found a message from John on his vortex manipulator, which included an appearance by Gray. Shaken, Jack immediately went back to the Hub to confront Captain Hart, leaving the other members of the team to deal with their respective challenges. (TV: Fragments [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nOn meeting John again, Jack was killed before being chained up and made to listen whilst John explained his predicament. Jack's rogue partner then detonated strategically placed bombs in and around Cardiff, obliterating the city before abducting Jack and taking both of them back through time to Cardiff in 27 AD.\n\nHere, Jack discovered that John was being manipulated by Gray, who marked his return by stabbing Jack in cold blood. Gray then forced John to bury Jack alive, twenty feet beneath what would become Cardiff. Gray, transformed into a merciless, sadistic beast by a lifetime of horrific torture, blamed Jack for letting go of his hand when they were children and wanted Jack to experience a similar, never-ending pain by choking on dirt, thrashing on the edge of life every time he revived, only to die again. Before burying Jack, John, now finally pushed too far by the awareness of how wrong his actions were, slipped a signet ring into the grave with him, hoping that the signal it emitted could be used to locate Jack.\n\nStuck in a cycle of death and resurrection for centuries, Jack was discovered by Alice Guppy and Charles Gaskell of Torchwood in 1901, who had picked up the signal of John's ring. Back in the early 20th century, Jack, insistent that he could not be allowed to cross his own timeline (for by now two versions of Jack were present â€“ his past self and present self) demanded to be placed in cryopreservation for 107 years. Despite being baffled, the two granted him this request.\n\nJack awoke again inside Torchwood Three concurrent to Gray's mayhem â€“ just in time to prevent Gray from finishing off Toshiko with a bullet. Despite Gray's own unwillingness to absolve him, Jack forgave his brother of his trespasses. Left with no other option, a tearful Jack chloroformed and cryopreserved Gray, refusing to kill him, but the damage had already been done, as Gray had been responsible for the deaths of Owen Harper and Toshiko Sato. Jack and John parted ways on better terms, with John travelling the world of the 21st century, determined to find out why Jack found the time period so interesting. Torchwood Three continued on, reduced to Jack, Ianto and Gwen. (TV: Exit Wounds [+]Chris Chibnall, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Two, 2008).)\n\nDisappearing from Torchwood for a while, Jack agreed with Jonty to be a surrogate for the next leader of the Yalnix Empire, hoping to make up for the recent deaths by creating a new life. He returned to Earth heavily pregnant, with Jonty his midwife, to Ianto's shock. He started to get very emotional due to the hormones which coursed through his body, but attempted to keep going with his duties for Torchwood including hunting Weevils. Ianto eventually booked him into a spa to wait out the rest of his pregnancy. At the Spa the rest of the clients started acting strangely, which freaked out both Jonty and Jack, fearing it was the Yalnix's enemies. They later realised that this was due to the influence of Junior. Ianto saved them and Jack was transported to the birthing ship. (AUDIO: Expectant [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNot long after Owen and Tosh's deaths, Martha phoned Jack for help at the CERN's Large Hadron Collider. He, Ianto and Gwen flew to Switzerland and met up with Martha. They investigated twelve accidents and found a creature that fed on neutrons was responsible. (AUDIO: Lost Souls [+]Joseph Lidster, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (BBC Radio, 2008).)\n\nDalek invasion of Earth[]\n\nLater, when the Earth was relocated by the Daleks to the Medusa Cascade in the 2000s,[nb 4] Harriet Jones, a former Prime Minister and acquaintance of the Tenth Doctor, contacted Torchwood and other allies of the Doctor via the Sub-Wave Network. After receiving vital information from Martha that allowed him to reactivate his vortex manipulator, Jack teleported to the Doctor's side just as a Dalek shot him. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nSubsequently, after the Doctor's abortive regeneration, Jack boarded the Crucible and surrendered to the Dalek forces. After the TARDIS was supposedly destroyed, he attempted to shoot the Supreme Dalek in anger and was promptly \"exterminated\". Reviving before his body could be incinerated, he subsequently burrowed into the Crucible and linked up with Sarah Jane Smith, Mickey Smith and Jackie Tyler. He attempted to use Sarah Jane's warp star to bluff the Daleks into calling off the detonation of the reality bomb but was transported to Davros' chamber instead.\n\nWhen Donna Noble disabled the Daleks, the Supreme Dalek descended into the vault and destroyed the Magnetron that was bringing the stolen planets back to their rightful positions, leaving Earth behind. Jack blasted the Supreme Dalek again, this time successfully destroying it.\n\nThe Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor finished off the Daleks, destroying the Crucible. Jack helped pilot the TARDIS as it returned the Earth to its original location. He offered Martha Jones a permanent position with Torchwood, and soon after was joined by Mickey, but not before the Doctor deactivated his vortex manipulator once again, refusing to run the risk of allowing him to travel in time. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nJack made a series of tutorial videos about Adipose, Pyroviles, Ood, Sontarans, Slitheen, Hath, Vespiforms, Vashta Nerada, Judoon, the Midnight entity, the Trickster's Brigade, Daleks, Davros, festive aliens and Cybermen in the Torchwood Three Hub. These were confiscated by UNIT and were made top-secret footage.

As Jack captured a zombie, which he nicknamed Mildred, Ianto saved mother-to-be Sarah Thomas, along with her injured husband, Trystan Thomas, who were under attack from a quartet of \"zombies\". While putting Mildred in the boot of the SUV, Jack was attacked and knocked unconscious by a zombie which jumped out from beneath the vehicle. He later awoke in the autopsy room, and travelled with Ianto to St Helen's Hospital. There, they met up with Gwen and Rhys, and found that Leet - a Dellacoi - had created the zombies to search for his life-shell and control over the creatures had passed to Oscar Phillips, a coma patient. As Oscar ran at the hospital window, Jack held Gwen back from saving him. Oscar fell to his death, relinquishing his control over the zombies. Following Oscar's funeral, Jack went with Gwen to place snowdrops on Oscar's grave. (PROSE: Bay of the Dead [+]Mark Morris, BBC Torchwood novels (BBC Books, 2009).)\n\nWhile trying to locate an alien weapon, Jack and Gwen discovered a parasitic alien baby. Their actions caused the baby to unlatch from its host, and the host then killed herself along with the baby. (PROSE: The Wrong Hands [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The baby's father then came after Torchwood, infecting Jack and Gwen with the Kagawa Virus. Jack and Gwen remained comatose for almost a full day while Ianto searched for an antidote. (PROSE: Virus [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack, Ianto, Gwen and Andy Davidson helped a confused girl named Freda who had been sent to 2009 by Torchwood representatives in 2069 to escape social prejudice against Ghosties. (AUDIO: Asylum [+]Anita Sullivan, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (BBC Radio, 2009).)\n\nJack's past, once again, came back to haunt him when he, Gwen and Ianto began investigating visions at Ravenhall Manor, which Jack had done in 1902. He re-encountered the creature that was responsible for creating the visions, and after being reunited with a trapped Gwen and Ianto, he destroyed the house. (COMIC: Hell House [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nInvestigating an alien energy field, Jack, Gwen and Ianto travelled to Delhi, India, where Jack was surprised to discover that Torchwood India had maintained its existence by using a time store to remain frozen in time. Horrified at Eleanor's plan to turn the entire Earth back to 1924, Jack destroyed the time store and Torchwood India. (AUDIO: Golden Age [+]James Goss, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (2009).)\n\nTorchwood Three combated a mysterious force that put people into coma-like trances after they answered the phone. (AUDIO: The Dead Line [+]Phil Ford, adapted from Deadline, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (2009).)\n\nAfter Rhys' uncle, Bryn Williams died in the 2000s,[nb 5] Torchwood Three investigated mysterious power cuts and Miss Carew. She was a woman in her eighties who was fit and at work after being on her deathbed not long before. Carew worked with Fitzroy to destroy all electricity on Earth, but was stopped.

The team defeated the entity possessing him which later entered Carlie Roberts. (AUDIO: Submission [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2009, Jack recognised Invictus when he met the infected Luke Palmer. He quantum sealed the Hub to prevent himself from killing Gwen and Ianto, but the latter was still inside. (AUDIO: Incubation: Know [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He had hallucinations about what happened in 1955 and tried to kill Ianto, only failing because he entered Stage 4 and died, his data being uploaded to the Data Core. (AUDIO: Prodromal: Love [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Upon reviving, he joined forces with Dr Larsen and activated the trojan horse in his data, deactivating Invictus and Provictus.

(AUDIO: Dissected [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nFighting the 456[]\n\nAlso in September, Jack's past returned to haunt him when the 456, in need of more subjects for their drug production, once more contacted humanity by using the children of Earth as a collective mouthpiece. The British government, fearing that the secret of the deal would come out, assigned John Frobisher to deal with the situation. Frobisher, knowing Jack's role as part of the team which had negotiated with the 456, reluctantly ordered Jack's assassination. Speculating, incorrectly, that the Hub had special properties which enabled Jack's regenerative abilities, Frobisher insisted on the complete destruction of the Hub, along with Jack, who was already attempting to investigate by seeking to examine his grandson Steven.\n\nThe government, through a ruse involving their agent Rupesh Patanjali, killed Jack and planted a bomb inside his body before he revived. When Jack, unsuspecting, returned to the Hub, the bomb detonated, destroying both Jack's body and the Hub, but not before Jack managed to evacuate Gwen and Ianto. (TV: Children of Earth: Day One [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nA covert ops team conveyed Jack's scattered remains to a holding facility, where he slowly regenerated his body and returned to life. When Frobisher's chief of operations in the task force realised that destroying the Hub had not rendered Jack mortal, she had him encased in concrete. Gwen and Ianto, however, had not been idle, and with the help of Rhys and Ianto's sister Rhiannon, they infiltrated the facility and rescued him. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Two [+]John Fay, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nWith Ianto's knowledge of Torchwood One's old infrastructure and a little criminal mischief orchestrated by Gwen, Jack headquartered his team inside a former Torchwood facility. Gwen arranged for the protection of former 456 victim Clem MacDonald by bringing him to \"Hub 2,\" as Rhys came to call it. Jack himself tracked down Frobisher and warned him to call off the assassination, or the 1965 incident would be disclosed. However, Frobisher countered with a new bombshell: Johnson's team had taken Jack's daughter Alice and grandson Steven hostage in order to ensure Jack's silence in the plans to negotiate terms with the 456. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Three [+]Russell T Davies and James Moran, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).) Jack, Gwen, Ianto and Rhys retaliated by persuading Lois Habiba to collect incriminating evidence against the entire Cabinet regarding the new terms, then threatening full disclosure unless Torchwood was allowed access to the 456. Storming into Thames House to confront the aliens, Jack and Ianto promised a \"fight to the death.\" In response, the 456 released a virus into the Thames House, killing all inside. Among the victims was Ianto, who died in Jack's arms. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Four [+]John Fay, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nA tearful Captain Jack surrendered to the authorities, blaming himself for Ianto's death. He instructed Gwen to have Rhys surrender himself as well, and arranged for the couple to return to Cardiff, with instructions to inform Rhiannon of her brother's death and to see to the needs of her family.\n\nAs the world governments began capitulating to the demands of the 456, and began rounding up children by the millions, Jack found himself sprung from prison by a surprise ally â€” Agent Johnson, who had become disillusioned and convinced by Alice to take a stand. With the aid of Johnson and Mr Dekker, who had managed to escape the massacre at Thames House, Jack devised a way to defeat the 456 using a reconstitution wave of a similar wavelength to that the 456 had used to kill Clem, using the children as one vast transmitter. There was one major catch: in order for it to work, the wave needed to be channelled through one child, for whom the force of the transmission would be deadly. Only one child was available to serve as the \"transmitter.\" Ignoring his daughter's screams and protests, Jack used his own grandson, Steven, as the prime transmitter. The plan succeeded, and the 456 were violently ejected from Earth. However, Steven died as a result, and Alice severed all contact with Jack, walking away without speaking a word. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Five [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nJack was officially declared dead as a result of the 456 Regulation. (TV: The New World [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nLeaving Torchwood Three[]\n\nIn October 2009, Jack was present in Cardiff when Suzie Costello was resurrected for the second time. He informed Suzie over the phone that he was \"coming for her\". He later observed her final death from the top of the Millennium Centre. (PROSE: Long Time Dead [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack then went on to travel the world. He did not find it enough to rid himself of his guilt. After six months he returned to Cardiff to destroy the House of the Dead, believing it would seal the Rift forever. He encountered the ghost of Ianto Jones at the house, and the couple finally confessed their love to each other for the first and last time. Ianto refused to let Jack sacrifice himself to seal the Rift and tricked him into leaving. Jack watched as the House of the Dead was destroyed with the ghost of Ianto unable to leave. (AUDIO: The House of the Dead [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Shortly after this event, Jack decided to leave Earth. After saying goodbye to Gwen and Rhys, he used his vortex manipulator (which Rhys and Gwen had retrieved from the ruins of Torchwood) to signal a nearby cold fusion freighter near the edge of the Sol system and teleported off into space. (TV: Children of Earth: Day Five [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nSome time later, Jack was drowning his sorrows in a bar surrounded by various alien species, when a barman handed him a folded piece of paper which indicated that someone's name was Alonso. Looking up, he saw the Tenth Doctor staring back, before gesturing towards the man approaching the bar. Seizing the opportunity, Jack addressed Alonso by his first name and told him that he was psychic when asked how he knew him. The Doctor left as Jack continued to flirt with Alonso. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nTheir evening was soon interrupted as the space station they were on was attacked by the forces of Mother Nothing, a giant cannibal beetle that sought its diamond engine. Ultimately, with Alonso Frame's assistance, Jack was able to defeat Mother Nothing and resolve the crisis. It was at this point that Jack learnt that Alonso had met the Doctor as well. Left with only a single operable escape pod between the two of them, Jack was knocked out by the midshipman who, unaware of his immortality, sent him out to safety. Awaking in his pod, Jack, presuming Alonso dead, was enraged to know he sacrificed himself in vain only to learn that he had managed to repair a pod for himself and survive. However, Jack and Alonso were separated when a meteor shower sent them on different paths. (AUDIO: One Enchanted Evening [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nMortal once again[]\n\nJack returned to planet Earth when the word \"Torchwood\" was emailed all around the world, coinciding with the start of the Miracle Day phenomenon. He used malware to expunge evidence of Torchwood from the Internet, and went to the CIA hard copy records to clear the last of the information. There he encountered CIA agent Esther Drummond, on whom he used Retcon. Jack used the alias \"Owen Harper\" while he gathered more information; he learned that the Miracle had given humans a version of his immortality, once seeing a severed head continue to live but unable to reform or heal. Jack also discovered that on Miracle Day, he lost his immortality, or perhaps just his instant healing ability as he kept minor wounds that normally would have healed in a day for him (from the explosion at the CIA Archives). He followed Rex Matheson, also CIA, to Wales to protect Gwen. There, they fought off assassins. Despite planning to investigate the Miracle with Gwen, Matheson extradited them to the United States against their will. (TV: The New World [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nOnce the pair were forced onto a plane headed for America, Rex confiscated Jack's vortex manipulator and handcuffed him to his seat. Hearing his manipulator beeping, Jack told Rex he had low sodium levels. Jack asked for a Coke, but was poisoned with arsenic by corrupt CIA agent Lyn Peterfield. He was saved by Rex and Gwen with the help of Dr Vera Juarez via phone call. Upon arrival at the airport, Rex freed Jack (along with Gwen) to fight the now corrupt CIA who wished to frame and dispose of them. After Lyn's neck was broken and the guards knocked out, the three boarded the car of Rex's fellow ex-agent, Esther. They left the airport after Jack briefly met the doctor who had saved his life. (TV: Rendition [+]Doris Egan, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack took command of the now ex-CIA agents with Gwen to form a new Torchwood team. They began stealing materials needed for operations again, and purchasing necessities with his ATM card, which had a large amount to spend. Soon coming into possession of the phone of Brian Friedkin, the CIA director who had given the orders to eliminate Torchwood, Jack led the team to a warehouse owned by PhiCorp. Inside was a stockpile of painkiller drugs, indicating that they knew \"Miracle Day\" would happen. Seemingly out of character, Jack decided to take the night off from his usual persistence in solving a mystery and had a one-night stand with a bartender. The following night, Jack confronted PhiCorp's new public face, Oswald Danes, and got him to admit his true feelings about his crime. Jack realised that Danes wished desperately for death. He was tossed out by Danes' guards, who took the recording he made of his conversation with Oswald. (TV: Dead of Night [+]Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack went to Los Angeles with the new Torchwood team to infiltrate a PhiCorp facility there. Unknown to him, they were followed by an assassin with orders to kill Jack. After arriving in LA, Jack and Gwen tricked Nicolas Frumkin into giving them access to the PhiCorp base. However, the assassin also gained access, and followed Jack and Gwen there. Inside the building, the assassin tied up Jack and Gwen, and informed them he had been ordered to kill Jack. However, the assassin was fascinated that Jack was the only mortal man left, and did not want to kill him. After informing Jack that something that he did in the past was involved, the assassin threatened to cut Gwen's throat. Before he could carry out his threat, he was shot in the throat by Rex. This earned Jack's anger as the assassin could have filled in the blanks about the new enemy they were facing. (TV: Escape to LA [+]Jim Gray and John Shiban, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nAfter the new categories of life were released and the overflow camps were opened, Gwen returned to Wales to free her father from one and Dr. Vera Juarez came to LA to join Torchwood. Rex, Vera, and Esther decided to infiltrate an overflow camp. As he was recognised easily by anyone working for this new enemy, Jack couldn't go. Learning Oswald Danes was to give a speech at the Miracle Rally, Jack sneaked in and tried persuading Danes to read a speech he wrote, revealing PhiCorp knew of the Miracle beforehand, instead of the speech that Jilly Kitzinger had written. If Danes read his speech, Jack promised that when the Miracle ended, he would help him die as he desperately wished. Much to his disappointment, Jack watched as Oswald took parts from both speeches to make his own, saying humanity had evolved into ever-lasting angels. (TV: The Categories of Life [+]Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack gained access to Stuart Owens' email and found out that he was having an extra-marital affair with Janet Tanner and that he planned to transfer her. Jack met Janet in a bar and persuaded her to help him meet Owens. Janet pretended to have been kidnapped over the phone, while Jack spoke with Stuart in a restaurant. Stuart explained that despite his position in PhiCorp, he did not know anything about the Miracle. He had been trying to find out about it. He also told Jack that something called the Blessing was involved. The police soon arrived and Jack was forced to leave. Jack returned to Torchwood's base and began to investigate the Blessing. Gwen contacted him using the Eye-5 contact lenses, and Jack recorded Gwen blowing up the modules at the Cowbridge Overflow Camp. He also put Rex's footage of both the San Pedro Overflow Camp and Vera's death online with Gwen's, starting public outrage at the conditions that the injured and ill were enduring; however, as \"Torchwood wasn't designed to fight politics,\" they had no more success than that. (TV: The Middle Men [+]John Shiban, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nGwen received a message on the Torchwood contact lenses, telling her they had Rhys, her mother, and Anwen. She would have to hand over Jack if she wanted to see her family again. Gwen returned to LA, and asked Jack to come outside. Once outside, Gwen stunned Jack and tied him up in the car. She drove him to where the contact lenses instructed her. Once they arrived at the specified location and a van arrived carrying three people, Rex and Esther revealed that they had followed them. They pointed sniper rifles at the people from the van. Jack was told they wanted to take him to Angelo Colasanto, the only person who knew the true nature of the Miracle. (TV: Immortal Sins [+]Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nThe person who had arranged to have Gwen's family kidnapped was Olivia Colasanto, Angelo's granddaughter. Olivia took Jack and the rest of the Torchwood team to Angelo's house, where Jack was told Angelo had been able to live to over a hundred years through artificial means, but had aged normally and was in a coma on life support. Angelo had become wealthy thanks to the advice Jack had given him and kept pictures of him from throughout the 20th century. Olivia explained that three families, Ablemarch, Costerdane and Frines, had made a deal to purchase Jack back in 1926 for his immortality. When he escaped, they vowed to find him again, destroying all evidence of their existence to cover their tracks.\n\nRex soon brought the CIA to Angelo's house, and Allen Shapiro had Olivia and Brian Friedkin arrested; Friedkin killed himself and Olivia with a bomb to escape the families' wrath for failing. Jack spoke to Angelo even though he was unconscious, and unplugged Angelo's life support equipment, assuming that he would survive due to the Miracle, and was surprised when Angelo died. After Shapiro had Gwen deported to Wales, Jack discovered a null field generator under Angelo's bed that cancelled out the morphic field that had caused the Miracle in the first place. Jack didn't want the CIA to obtain the null field technology, so he persuaded Rex and Esther to help him escape with a vital component of the generator. Unfortunately, Jack was shot soon after he escaped. Esther was forced to go with him, while Rex stayed with the CIA. (TV: End of the Road [+]Ryan Scott and Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nJack spent the next two months with Esther, ending up in Scotland. Esther collected his blood, which she believed relevant to the Miracle. Eventually, they were contacted by Gwen, who told them Oswald Danes was in her house and wanted to speak to Jack. Jack and Esther went to Wales, where Jack retconned a man who was watching Gwen's house before going in. Oswald explained to Jack that he had stolen Jilly Kitzinger's laptop. He knew what she was doing for the families. Jilly was helping them to mistranslate video from other countries to hide the location of the Blessing. Torchwood realised that there were two Blessings, one in Shanghai, and one in Buenos Aires. Jack went to Shanghai with Gwen and Oswald. Once they arrived there, his gunshot wound began to hurt more. Gwen helped him change his bandage, and Oswald noticed that Jack's blood was moving by itself. Gwen determined that Jack's blood must be moving towards the Blessing. (TV: The Gathering [+]John Fay, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nBack to abnormal[]\n\nWith Oswald's help, Jack and Gwen located the Blessing, which was about to be blown up by the Families to bury it forever. They knew that Torchwood had located it. Strapping Oswald to a bomb, the three forced their way into the Blessing. Rex and Esther were captured while trying to infiltrate the Blessing in Buenos Aires. Jack, despite being from the future and having had experiences with the Doctor, had no idea what the Blessing really was. He believed it to have been on Earth since the beginning. The Blessing seemed to show everybody themselves, but Jack didn't appear significantly affected by seeing all the lives he had lived. Jack learned that his blood was used to change the Blessing, which ran Earth's morphic field. Jack realised the Blessing changed in self-defence and that his mortal blood could change it back. A family member revealed that mortal blood would need to be put into the Blessing from both ends to reverse the Miracle. Jack would have no way to do it. Rex, however, had transfused Jack's blood into his own body.\n\nThe two men were prepared to sacrifice themselves to end the Miracle, but Esther was shot by the Families to prevent this, as ending the Miracle would kill Esther. The two decided to end the Miracle anyway, and Gwen shot Jack while Rex removed his bandage. Jack appeared to die of the gunshot wound. Oswald decided to stay behind to blow up a family member, and Gwen and Jilly decided to escape. Jack's immortality returned and he escaped with Gwen as Oswald detonated his bomb. Rex also survived the ordeal, but Esther did not make it.\n\nThe friends attended Esther's funeral. There, Charlotte Wills exposed herself as the CIA mole that kept the Families informed about actions taken against them and killed Rex before being killed herself. Rex resurrected, having somehow gained Jack's immortality. (TV: The Blood Line [+]Russell T Davies and Jane Espenson, Torchwood series 4 (Starz, 2011).)\n\nTaking a holiday[]\n\nAfter the events of Miracle Day, Jack decided to take a holiday away from humanity, and find solitude by going to Cotter Paluni's World. (AUDIO: Red Skies [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After this, Jack then returned to Cardiff to assist Andy Davidson solve the mystery of Mr Invincible. (AUDIO: Mr Invincible [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBy 2013, Jack's vortex manipulator was held in UNIT's Black Archive. A Zygon posing as Kate Stewart told Clara Oswald it was bequeathed to the UNIT archive by Jack on the occasion of his death, \"one of them\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nJack was captured by Adam Mitchell and trapped with many other companions of the Doctor in Adam Mitchell's fortress. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Along with the others, he was released by Frobisher and assisted the first eleven incarnations of the Doctor as they fought through the Tremas Master's army of Autons. After Adam thwarted the Master's plot to destroy the universe at the cost of his life, all the Doctors and their companions oversaw his memorial before taking their leave. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nReturn to the fight[]\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nInfo from Station Zero [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. needs to be added\n\nIn 2012, Jack Harkness returned to Earth to assist Gwen Cooper, Rhys Williams and Andy Davidson to stop an attempt by the Mandragora Helix to attack Earth. (PROSE: Exodus Code [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Jack then travelled with the crew of the Ice Maiden, an ice-rigging ship augmented with alien technology, to explore Earth and other planets. (COMIC: World Without End [+]John Barrowman and Carole E. Barrowman, Titan Comics' Torchwood comic series (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nJack realised that the Committee was behind the Three Families and, hoping to find out how the Evolved had kept their worlds safe from the Committee, travelled to Peritus IV. He begged the Evolved to help him save Earth and agreed to a controlled experiment of their technology upon humans. When he learnt of what that entailed, they held him captive and tried to kill him.\n\nDue to his immortality, the Evolved instead transferred him into the body of Mr Griffith at Bryn Offa Residential Care. He had Elunedd call Gwen and later offered the Evolved his mind in return for Rhys, Anwen and the other people whose minds they had swapped being restored. (AUDIO: Forgotten Lives [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTravelling from the third planet in the Otega system, back to Earth, Jack and the crew of the Ice Maiden were attacked by ninjas on jet-skis who came from a flying saucer. (COMIC: World Without End [+]John Barrowman and Carole E. Barrowman, Titan Comics' Torchwood comic series (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nSorvix occupation[]\n\nLeading the new Torchwood[]\n\nAfter being \"dumped\" by the crew of the Ice Maiden, (AUDIO: Aliens & Sex & Chips & Gravy [+]James Goss, Aliens Among Us 1 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) Jack resumed his work with Gwen at Torchwood. They were joined by St John Colchester and operated from a partially-restored Hub. (AUDIO: Changes Everything [+]James Goss, Aliens Among Us 1 (Torchwood, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He was unaware of Gwen's possession by Ng. (AUDIO: Orr [+]Juno Dawson, Aliens Among Us 1 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., etc.) The three became aware of the presence of an alien race that had taken over the city and Jack set his sights on Tyler Steele to join them due to his skills with computers and investigation.\n\nJack vetted Tyler whilst investigating 3Sol but refused to let him join after he encouraged Vorsun to kill her human hostages, although he did tell him to continue looking into the aliens. (AUDIO: Changes Everything [+]James Goss, Aliens Among Us 1 (Torchwood, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) They continued a sexual relationship. The two of them met Orr, whom Jack drove out of Cardiff to protect the city from the explosive control necklace, and Jack began to feel distanced from \"Gwen\" when she did not invite him to her mother's funeral. (AUDIO: Orr [+]Juno Dawson, Aliens Among Us 1 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He posed as a barman at the Cardiff Bay Intelligent Hotel and Spa to gather information and later killed himself to shut down the CPU. At the Hub, he invited Orr to join them. (AUDIO: Superiority Complex [+]AK Benedict, Aliens Among Us 1 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nJack was infected by a parasite after being raped by Duncan. He went on to infect Tyler and Ng and, after the three were given curative worms by Ro-Jedda, Tyler called off their relationship and told Jack to do something about Red Doors. (AUDIO: Love Rat [+]Christopher Cooper, Aliens Among Us 2 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He and Orr went to help Andy Davidson with a hostage situation whilst Mr Colchester went to Ritz Tower to save Colin (AUDIO: A Kill to a View [+]Mac Rogers, Aliens Among Us 2 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) and went to Neath to get spare parts for the Rift Manipulator when Deliverables began taking control. (AUDIO: Zero Hour [+]Jay Harley, Aliens Among Us 2 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nTo save Andy and prevent 3Sol from gaining complete control of policing, Jack allied himself with Xander Vaughn of Red Doors, promising to supply them with quantum tech in return for their help in locating Helen White and thwarting Ro-Jedda's plans. He recruited a number of students to the Red Doors cause and supplied them with flash grenades and the like for the protest. In the end, he reached a compromise with Ro-Jedda. (AUDIO: The Empty Hand [+]Tim Foley, Aliens Among Us 2 (Aliens Among Us, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) Yvonne Hartman arrived at the Hub afterwards and exposed him, also framing him for helping Red Doors place glitterbombs around the city. Torchwood turned against him and Yvonne took his place, telling Jack to join Red Doors and put them to a better use. (AUDIO: Poker Face [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLeading Red Doors[]\n\nFrom the ruins of the intelligence of the Cardiff Bay Intelligent Hotel and Spa, Jack engineered the Meme with the intention of using it to encourage rebellion against the Sorvix. However, Red Doors altered it into instead encouraging violence and revenge. Mr Colchester asked Jack to meet with him and admonished him for his role. (AUDIO: Tagged [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJack tempered Red Doors and directed them solely against the Sorvix and empty buildings. However, he was unable to prevent them from bombing Cardiff Airport and died in the explosion. With Orr, he decided to bring an end to Red Doors and met with Inspector Bernstein to take them down, although they found that Yvonne and 3Sol already got to them. He returned to the Hub after warning Cardiff City Hall of the oncoming bomb attack and allowed the Rift to open, splitting Gwen from Ng. He said goodbye to his friend as she left with Rhys. There was an explosion at the Hub (AUDIO: Herald of the Dawn [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) which made Jack mortal again. (AUDIO: See No Evil [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nGod and the Committee[]\n\nDue to what she did to Gwen, Jack avoided Ng and did not talk to her. (AUDIO: Fu"
