        "text": "\"Kalamazoo\" redirects here. For other uses, see Kalamazoo (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Michigan, United States\n\nKalamazoo ( KAL-ə-mə-ZOO) is a city in and the county seat of Kalamazoo County, Michigan, United States. At the 2020 census, Kalamazoo had a population of 73,598. It is the principal city of the Kalamazoo–Portage metropolitan area in southwestern Michigan, which had a population of 261,670 in 2020.\n\nOne of Kalamazoo's most notable features is the Kalamazoo Mall, an outdoor pedestrian shopping mall. The city created the mall in 1959 by closing part of Burdick Street to auto traffic, although two of the mall's four blocks have been reopened to auto traffic since 1999.[5][6] Kalamazoo is home to Western Michigan University, a large public university, Kalamazoo College, a private liberal arts college, and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, a two-year community college.\n\nName origin\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Etymology of Kalamazoo\n\nOriginally known as Bronson (after founder Titus Bronson) in the township of Arcadia, the names of both the city and the township were changed to \"Kalamazoo\" in 1836 and 1837, respectively.[7] The name “Kalamazoo” comes from a Potawatomi word, first found in a British report in 1772. The Kalamazoo River, which passes through the modern city of Kalamazoo, was located on the route between Detroit and Fort Saint-Joseph (nowadays Niles, Michigan). French-Canadian traders, missionaries, and military personnel were quite familiar with this area during the French era and thereafter. The Kalamazoo River was then known by Canadians and French as La rivière Kikanamaso. The name \"Kikanamaso\" was also recorded by Father Pierre Potier, a Jesuit missionary for the Huron-Wendats at the Assumption mission (south shore of Detroit), while en route to Fort Saint-Joseph during the fall of 1760.[8] Legend has it that \"Ki-ka-ma-sung\", meaning \"boiling water\", referred to a footrace held each fall by local Native Americans, in which participants had to run to the river and back before a pot boiled.[9] The word negikanamazo, purported to mean \"otter tail\" or \"stones like otters\", has also been cited as a possible origin of the name.[10] Another theory is that it means \"the mirage or reflecting river\".[11] Another legend is that the image of \"boiling water\" referred to fog on the river as seen from the hills above the current downtown. The name was also given to the river that flows almost all the way across the state.\n\nThe name Kalamazoo, which sounds unusual to English speakers, has become a metonym for exotic places, as in the phrase \"from Timbuktu to Kalamazoo\".[12] Today, T-shirts are sold in Kalamazoo with the phrase \"Yes, there really is a Kalamazoo\".[13]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area on which the modern city of Kalamazoo stands was once home to Native Americans of the Hopewell tradition, who migrated into the area sometime before the first millennium. Evidence of their early residency remains in the form of a small mound in downtown's Bronson Park. The Hopewell civilization began to decline after the 8th century and was replaced by other groups.[14] The Potawatomi culture lived in the area when the first European explorers arrived.\n\nRené-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, passed just southeast of the present city of Kalamazoo in late March 1680. The first Europeans to reside in the area were itinerant fur traders in the late 18th and early 19th century. There are records of several traders wintering in the area, and by the 1820s at least one trading post had been established.[15][16]\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the British established a smithy and a prison camp in the area.[15]\n\nThe 1821 Treaty of Chicago ceded the territory south of the Grand River to the United States federal government. However, the area around present-day Kalamazoo was reserved as the village of Potawatomi Chief Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish. Six years later, as a result of the 1827 Treaty of St. Joseph, the tract that became the city of Kalamazoo was also ceded.\n\nIn 1829, Titus Bronson, originally from Connecticut, became the first white settler to build a cabin within the present city limits of Kalamazoo.[17] He platted the town in 1831 and named it the village of Bronson—not to be confused with the much smaller Bronson, Michigan, about fifty miles (80 km) to the south-southeast of Kalamazoo.\n\nBronson, frequently described as \"eccentric\" and argumentative, was later run out of town. The village was renamed Kalamazoo in 1836, due in part to Bronson's being fined for stealing a cherry tree.[18] Today, a hospital and a downtown park, among other things, are named for Bronson. Kalamazoo was legally incorporated as a village in 1838 and as a city in 1883.\n\nThe fertile farmlands attracted prosperous Yankee farmers who settled the surrounding area, and sent their sons to Kalamazoo to become businessmen, professionals and entrepreneurs who started numerous factories.[19] Most of the original settlers of Kalamazoo were New Englanders or were from upstate New York.[20]\n\nOn August 27, 1856, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in Kalamazoo during a campaign rally for John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate. The text of the speech was found by Lincoln historian Thomas I. Starr in a copy of the Detroit Daily Advertiser and published in a booklet. This was the only trip Lincoln ever made to Michigan.[21] In July 2022, a local non-profit, the Kalamazoo Abraham Lincoln Institute, was given permission by the city to place a statue of Lincoln in Bronson Park to commemorate the event.[22]\n\nIn the 1940s, the city became the first to install curb cuts.[23][24]\n\nIn 1959, the city created the Kalamazoo Mall, the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall in the United States, by closing part of Burdick Street to auto traffic. The Mall was designed by Victor Gruen, who also designed the country's first enclosed shopping mall, which had opened three years earlier.[5] Two of the mall's four blocks were reopened to auto traffic in 1999 after much debate.[6]\n\nAn F3 tornado struck downtown Kalamazoo on May 13, 1980, killing five and injuring 79.[25]\n\nOn February 20, 2016, Kalamazoo became the site of a random series of shootings in which six people were killed.[26] A prime suspect was apprehended by police without incident.[27]\n\nNorth Burdick St. in 1908\n\nAcademy St. in 1908\n\nOld public library in 1908\n\nPaper mills in 1908\n\nEconomic history\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the past, Kalamazoo was known for its production of windmills, mandolins, buggies, automobiles, cigars, stoves, paper, and paper products. Agriculturally, it once was noted for celery. Although much of it has become suburbanized, the surrounding area still produces farm crops, primarily corn and soybeans.\n\nKalamazoo was the original home of Gibson Guitar Corporation, which spawned the still-local Heritage Guitars. The company was incorporated as \"Gibson Mandolin - Guitar Co., Ltd\" on October 11, 1902, by the craftsman Orville Gibson. One budget model was named the Gibson Kalamazoo \"Melody Maker\" Electric Guitar. Operations were moved gradually from Kalamazoo to Memphis, Tennessee (Electric Division) and Bozeman, Montana (Acoustic Division) in the 1980s. Some workers from the original factory stayed in Kalamazoo to create the Heritage Guitar company.[29]\n\nKalamazoo was once known as the \"Paper City\" because of the paper mills in and near the city. The Allied Paper Corporation operated several mills and employed 1,300 people in Kalamazoo during the late 1960s. As the forests of West Michigan were logged, paper mills closed.[30][31]\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Kalamazoo was home to the Brass Era car company Barley.\n\nKalamazoo was also headquarters of the Checker Motors Company, the former manufacturer of the Checker Cab, which also stamped sheet metal parts for other auto manufacturers. Checker closed on June 25, 2009, a victim of the Late-2000s recession.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of Kalamazoo is on the southwest bank of a major bend in the Kalamazoo River, with a small portion, about 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), on the opposite bank. Several small tributaries of the Kalamazoo River, including Arcadia Creek and Portage Creek, wind through the city. The northeastern portion of Kalamazoo sits in the broad, flat Kalamazoo Valley, while the western portions of Kalamazoo climb into low hills to the west and south. Several small lakes are found throughout the area. It is 50 mi (80 km) south of Grand Rapids and 75 mi (121 km) southwest of Lansing.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Kalamazoo has a total area of 25.11 square miles (65.03 km2), of which 24.68 square miles (63.92 km2) is land and 0.43 square miles (1.11 km2) is water.[32]\n\nKalamazoo's suburban population is located primarily to the south, in the city of Portage, and to the west in Oshtemo and Texas townships.\n\nAt least part of the municipal water supply for Kalamazoo is provided by the watershed contained within the Al Sabo Preserve[33] in Texas Charter Township, Michigan, immediately southwest of Kalamazoo.\n\nAnother watershed, Kleinstuck Marsh,[34] is popular with hikers and birdwatchers. Kleinstuck Marsh is south of Maple Street, between Oakland Drive and Westnedge Avenue, Kalamazoo's major north–south artery.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKalamazoo has a humid continental (Köppen Dfa) climate. Summers can be hot, humid, and relatively long, comprising the months of May to September. Tornadoes are rare but possible in Kalamazoo. In fact, in 1980, a major tornado ripped through downtown Kalamazoo causing extensive damage. In winter, temperatures occasionally plummet below 0 °F (-18°). Kalamazoo has been known for brutal snow storms as late as early April, but there are occasional winter days with no snow cover on the ground at all. Lake-effect snowstorms are commonplace in the winter.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18401,290—18502,50794.3%18606,070142.1%18709,18151.3%188011,93730.0%189017,85349.6%190024,40436.7%191039,43761.6%192048,48722.9%193054,78613.0%194054,097−1.3%195057,7046.7%196082,18942.4%197085,5554.1%198079,722−6.8%199080,2770.7%200076,145−5.1%201074,262−2.5%202073,598−0.9%\n\nAs of 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $31,189, and the median income for a family was $42,438.

The Neighborhood Development Division of the city's government works with these associations to invest federal, state, and local funds, including those from the Community Development Block Grant program, in community improvements and economic growth.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Kalamazoo was named to Fast Company's 'Fast 50: Most Innovative Companies 2007',[40] in recognition of the city's community capitalism approach to revitalize the economy. In 2012 Kiplinger's Personal Finance ranked Kalamazoo fourth of the Ten Best Cities for Cheapskates.[41] The city was named in NerdWallet.com's 2014 'Top 10 Best Cities for Work-Life Balance'.[42][43]\n\nBreweries\n\n[edit]\n\nKalamazoo has many local breweries and brewpubs that produce a variety of beer styles.\n\nPerhaps the best-known is Bell's Brewery, established as the Kalamazoo Brewing Company in 1985 by Larry Bell.[44] The brewery has expanded from its original Kalamazoo location, which houses the Eccentric Cafe, to another brewery in nearby Comstock Charter Township. Bell's beer is distributed to 40 US states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico.[45][46] Other local breweries include Tibb's Brewing Company,[47] Rupert's Brewhouse (2013-2019),[48][49] Boatyard Brewing Co. (2014-2019),[50][51] One Well Brewing,[52] and Latitude 42 Brewing Company, the latter in the southern suburb of Portage. On a smaller scale, Olde Peninsula Brewpub, Bravo! restaurant, and Bilbo's Pizza and Brewing Company[53] serve their own brews. The area is also a hotbed for home brewing and partners with neighboring Grand Rapids to form what is widely considered one of America's more important regions in American craft beer explosion. In recent years, at least two community events have evolved from the growing craft beer industry in the Kalamazoo area (Kalamazoo Beer Week (annual),[54] Kalamazoo Craft Beer Festival[55]). In 2015, the Give a Craft beer trail and passport were introduced.[56] A shuttle bus (Kalamazoo Brew Bus) service[57] and party bike tour service[58] became available in 2016.\n\nDistilleries\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Rupert's Brew House entered the Kalamazoo craft spirits market.[59] Two additional distilleries, Green Door Distilling, formerly Revival Distilling[60] and Kalamazoo Distilling Company, are in the licensing stage.[61]\n\nFlavorings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe A.M. Todd Company, one of the lead producers of peppermint oil and other flavorings, is headquartered in Kalamazoo.[62] Its founder, Albert M.

It is privately owned but open to the public and currently functioning as a bed and breakfast, restaurant and spa.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nKalamazoo government is administered under a commission-manager style of government. The city commission is the representative body of the city, and consists of seven members—six city commissioners and a separately elected mayor—elected on a staggered non-partisan basis every four years. Whoever receives the most votes during an election becomes vice mayor of the city for the first two years of their term until a new vice mayor is selected. The current City Commission consists of Mayor David Anderson, Vice Mayor Don Cooney, and commissioners Jeanne Hess, Chris Praedel, Qianna Decker, Stephanie Hoffman, and Esteven Juarez.[88] The current mayor, David F. Anderson, was elected to a second term on November 2, 2021, beating Ben Stanley with 78.7% of the vote.[89]\n\nThe vice mayor of Kalamazoo is Don Cooney, who won election in 2021 with 69.37% of the vote.[90]\n\nThe city manager is the city's chief administrative officer.

Crime is spread throughout Kalamazoo and is especially high in the inner neighborhoods such as Edison, the Northside and Vine. Crime is lower in the downtown area and most of the southwest area.[91] The aggravated assault rate in 2015 was 793.3 per 100,000[92]—3.3 times the national average. The murder rate was 12.5 per 100,000 in 2010 and 7.9 in 2014.[93][94] The 2016 Kalamazoo shootings by Uber driver Jason Dalton claimed 6 lives and caused 2 serious injuries in Kalamazoo County.[95] Between 2008 and 2013 firearms were involved in 61% of homicides in Kalamazoo county compared to 77% statewide.[96]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nKalamazoo is home to Western Michigan University. The college has four campuses in Kalamazoo, (West Campus, East Campus, Parkview Campus and Oakland Drive Campus) as well as several regional locations throughout Michigan and two in Florida.

Art Hop is a free event, during which downtown businesses and galleries display works by local artists, and patrons 'hop' from venue to venue, enjoying art, live music, and the chance to interact with local artists. A popular site during Art Hop is the Park Trades Center, which houses the Kalamazoo Book Arts Center, Glass Art Kalamazoo, and many other studios.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, downtown Kalamazoo is the site of an annual New Year's Fest celebration. This celebration is centered at Bronson Park and surrounding venues, allowing patrons to walk from venue to venue to enjoy an all ages showcase of performing arts and other activities (music, magic, comedy, exhibitions, fireworks, food). Initiated in 1985, the event has grown in scope and popularity.[104][105]\n\nMusic groups and other performing artists perform at the downtown State Theatre, Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium, and Wings Event Center.\n\nThe annual \"Eccentric Day\" at Bell's Eccentric Cafe celebrates the brewery's Eccentric Ale on the December Friday that marks the end of finals at Western Michigan University.[106]\n\nThe Moped Army was founded in Kalamazoo in 1997.\n\nThere is no longer a zoo in Kalamazoo.

In recent years, the Kalamazoo Nordic Skiers[108] club has groomed and maintained skate ski and classic ski trails for community use.\n\nIn 2002, the Kalamazoo Public Library was named \"Library of the Year\" by Library Journal.[109] The library includes a main location and four branch libraries, and until 2010, a bookmobile system.[110] In 2014, the library opened 'The Hub', a digital lab open to the public for digitizing photos and video, producing podcasts, preserving old vinyl records, cassettes and VHS tapes, and other services.[111]\n\nKalamazoo's theaters and performing groups include the Kalamazoo Civic Theatre, The New Vic Theatre, Farmers Alley Theatre, Crawlspace Theatre Productions, The State Theater, and the Barn Theatre in nearby Augusta. Plays and musicals are also performed at Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University.\n\nAnimation festival\n\n[edit]\n\nA project of Kalamazoo Valley Community College, The Kalamazoo Animation Festival International (KAFI) encourages and educates animation artists, promotes Kalamazoo's animation industry, and provides community entertainment.[112] In addition to a biannual festival, KAFI sponsors events such as film screenings and workshops throughout the year.\n\nKAFI's first festival drew 235 submissions and nearly 1,000 attendees in 2002. A second festival was held in 2003. Since then, an every-other-year schedule has been adopted. The 2007 festival attracted more than 500 entries from 37 countries. In addition to an animated film competition with $15,000 in prizes awarded, the festival features events for students, artists, educators, filmmakers and the general public. Past KAFI award winners include Bill Plympton, Chris Landreth and John Canemaker.[citation needed]\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city's most prominent art museum is the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, whose collection has more than 3,600 works and a focus on 20th-century American art.

Business Review Western Michigan, a business-to-business publication headquartered in Kalamazoo, covering Western Michigan news, was rolled into MLive online coverage in late 2012. The ultimate parent company of both the Gazette and Business Review are Advance Publications, Inc.\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nWWMT, West Michigan's CBS / CW affiliate, is licensed and operates out of Kalamazoo but serves the entire West Michigan region. The station was originally owned and operated by famous broadcasting pioneer (and former Detroit Tigers owner) John Fetzer, as \"WKZO-TV\". Along with television, Fetzer introduced Kalamazoo to radio in 1931, when AM 590 WKZO signed on the air. Fetzer also created Kalamazoo's first cable television system, then known as Fetzer Cablevision; it is a predecessor of Kalamazoo's current cable franchise, Charter Communications.\n\nPublic Media Network, located in downtown Kalamazoo, hosts media outlets including Charter cable channels 187-191 where daily public access programs are produced and aired to the public.\n\nKalamazoo is part of the West Michigan television market, which also includes Grand Rapids and Battle Creek. Most channels that serve the entire market are receivable in Kalamazoo, including WWMT, WOOD-TV (NBC), WXMI (Fox), WZPX (Ion) and WLLA (religious). Some channels based in the northern part of the market reach Kalamazoo through a satellite or translator, such as WTLJ Muskegon (religious, through W26BX), WGVU-TV Grand Rapids (PBS, through WGVK), and WXSP-CD Grand Rapids (MyNetworkTV, through WOKZ-CA). WOTV in Battle Creek broadcasts ABC programming for the southern part of the market, including Kalamazoo. Charter offers all West Michigan channels on its system to Kalamazoo subscribers, including WZZM, the ABC affiliate for Grand Rapids and the northern part of the market.\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nWIDR is the college student-run, commercial free radio station at Western Michigan University.

It hosts many local music programs including jazz and classical performances as well as programming from NPR. WMUK broadcasts 50,000 watts in high definition on 102.1 FM.\n\nWKDS is West Michigan's only high school student-run radio station. The station signed on in 1983 at 89.9 on the FM dial, broadcasting from Loy Norrix High School. The call letters stood for Kalamazoo District Schools (now Kalamazoo Public Schools). For most of its history, WKDS broadcast only during daytime hours and not at all on the weekend. In Fall of 2004, the station began broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in an attempt to prevent an outside organization to take over the time WKDS was off the air. WKDS was part of a county wide Education For Employment program for years. The radio station is still owned by Kalamazoo Public Schools although the EFE program has been discontinued. High school students from around the area continue to operate the station.\n\nFM radio stations that originate or can be heard over the air in Kalamazoo:\n\nWCXK 88.3 - Kalamazoo - Christian Adult Contemporary\n\nWIDR 89.1 - Kalamazoo - College/Variety\n\nWKDS 89.9 - Kalamazoo - High School/Variety\n\nWCSG 91.3 - Grand Rapids - Christian Adult Contemporary\n\nWZUU 92.5 - Mattawan/Kalamazoo - Classic Rock\n\nWBCT 93.7 - Grand Rapids - Country\n\nWWDK 94.1 - Jackson/Lansing/Battle Creek/Kalamazoo - Classic Country\n\nWKLQ 94.5 - Grand Rapids - Adult Album Alternative\n\nW238AL 95.5 - Kalamazoo - Urban Adult Contemporary (FM translator for AM 1560)\n\nWLKM-FM 95.9 - Three Rivers - Adult Contemporary\n\nWMAX-FM 96.1 - Holland/Grand Rapids - Sports\n\nWZOX 96.5 - Portage/Kalamazoo - Modern Adult Contemporary\n\nWGRD 97.9 - Grand Rapids - Mainstream Rock\n\nWNWN 98.5 - Coldwater/Battle Creek/Kalamazoo - Country\n\nWBCH-FM 100.1 - Hastings - Country\n\nWQXC 100.9 - Otsego/Kalamazoo - Oldies\n\nWMUK 102.1 - Kalamazoo - NPR/Talk/Classical/Jazz\n\nWKFR-HD2 102.5 - Kalamazoo - Urban Contemporary //WBXX 104.9\n\nWYHA 102.9 - Grand Rapids - Christian\n\nWKFR 103.3 - Battle Creek/Kalamazoo - CHR/Top 40\n\nWVGR 104.1 - Grand Rapids - NPR/Talk\n\nWBXX 104.9 - Marshall/Battle Creek- Urban Contemporary\n\nWSRW 105.7 - Grand Rapids - Adult Contemporary\n\nWJXQ 106.1 - Jackson/Lansing/Battle Creek - Mainstream Rock\n\nWVFM 106.5 - Kalamazoo - Variety Hits\n\nWKZO 106.9 - Kalamazoo - News/Talk (FM translator for AM 590)\n\nWTNR 107.3 - Greenville/Grand Rapids - Country\n\nWRKR 107.7 - Portage/Battle Creek/Kalamazoo - Classic Rock\n\nAM radio stations that originate or can be heard over the air in Kalamazoo:\n\nWKZO 590 - Kalamazoo - News/Talk - (FM translator at 106.9)\n\nWAKV 980 - Allegan/Otsego - Adult Standards\n\nWKMI 1360 - Kalamazoo - Talk\n\nWTOU 1660 - Kalamazoo - Urban Adult Contemporary\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nHighways\n\n[edit]\n\nI-94\n\nBS I-94\n\nUS 131\n\nBus. US 131 north of downtown Kalamazoo\n\nM-96\n\nM-343\n\nA-45\n\nKalamazoo is served by highways I-94, US 131, M-96 and M-343. It was on the original Territorial Road in Michigan of the 19th century, which started in Detroit and ran to Lake Michigan. Much of that, but not all, later became Old US 12—the \"old\" designation came about when I-94 was built parallel to it—and also was called Red Arrow Highway after a World War I army division. The name \"US 12\" was shifted south to what once was US 112 between Detroit and New Buffalo. Some parts of Old US 12 outside of town, especially in Van Buren and Berrien counties to the west, are still called Red Arrow Highway. The term \"Old US 12\" has faded from use.\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kalamazoo Transportation Center\n\nSee also: Michigan Services\n\nKalamazoo has rail service provided by Amtrak, with the station located downtown and combined with a newly renovated bus terminal. Kalamazoo serves as the hub and largest city in Amtrak's only high-speed corridor outside the Northeast, with 110-mile-per-hour (177 km/h) service between Porter, Indiana and Albion, Michigan.[124]\n\nKalamazoo also has a freight service provided by Grand Elk Railroad running north to Grand Rapids, Michigan and south to Elkhart, Indiana. The line they lease was a former Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad mainline.\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nBus service to and through the city is provided by Greyhound, Indian Trails and the Kalamazoo trolley.\n\nPublic bus services within the city are provided by Metro Transit.\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the southern end of the city is the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport (AZO), which offers flights on various airlines to hubs and leisure destinations. Construction of a new $36 million terminal was completed in 2011.[125]\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kal-Haven Trail, heavily used by cyclists, runners, walkers, and snowmobilers, extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It runs 34 miles (55 km) between South Haven, to a trailhead just west of Kalamazoo. Between that trailhead and South Haven the trail is run by Van Buren County, even the parts within Kalamazoo County. A trail pass is no longer required. The Kal-Haven is a rail trail, built on the former right-of-way of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad.\n\nThe section east of the trailhead was opened in 2008 and extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It is known as the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail and is run by Kalamazoo County. No pass is required on that section.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nKalamazoo's name is a familiar reference in popular music, since its unique sound makes it a \"great word for a lyric.\"[126] Its use as metonym for a remote place is discussed above—\"although when it comes to both Timbuktu and Kalamazoo, most of that brag-worthy exotic allure is merely in their names.\"[12] Nonetheless, numerous songs use the city's name in their song title or lyrics.\n\nProbably the first and most famous was \"(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\" (1942) by the Glenn Miller Orchestra with Tex Beneke. The song was written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. It was recreated by the fictional Gene Morrison Orchestra (performing as the Glenn Miller Orchestra) and the Nicholas Brothers (performing the song as part of a dance sequence) in the 1942 movie Orchestra Wives.[127][128] It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 15th Academy Awards (music by Harry Warren; lyrics by Mack Gordon).[128][129]\n\nAt least a dozen (and many more versions) of \"Kalamazoo\" songs have been recorded. In chronological order, others include: \"I've Been Everywhere\" (1962) by Hank Snow (from the album of the same title)[130] and the 1996 song \"Unchained\" (also from the album of the same name) by Johnny Cash[131]—reworked from the original 1959 Geoff Mack Australian-place-names version made popular by the singer Lucky Starr, \"Down on the Corner\" (1969) by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their fourth studio album, Willy and the Poor Boys—covered by a dozen other groups—though the reference is not to the city but to the \"Kalamazoo\" line of budget priced guitars manufactured by Gibson,[132] \"Kalamazoo\" (1995) by Luna on Penthouse,[133] \"Cold Rock a Party\" (1996) by MC Lyte on Bad as I Wanna B,[134] \"Kalamazoo\" (1997) by the rock trio Primus on Brown Album,[135] \"Top of the World\" (1999) by Rascalz on Global Warning,[136] \"Isn't It Love\" (2001) by Andrew Peterson on Clear to Venus (at one point, he sings that he lost his luggage in Kalamazoo), \"Kalamazoo\" (2002) by Mike Craver on Shining Down,[137] and \"Kalamazoo\" (2004) by Ben Folds on the EP Super D.[138][139][140]\n\nThe city was also mentioned in the opera Einstein on the Beach by Philip Glass and in the chorus of the song \"Gotta Get Away\" by The Black Keys, from their album Turn Blue (\"I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo/Just to get away from you...\").[141] Like Miller, the Creedence and Axton lyrics probably use the word \"Kalamazoo\" as an oblique reference to Gibson, which made various models named \"Kalamazoo\" that were all prominently adorned with the city's name as their origin. In 2011, rap artist Young Jeezy mentioned the city in the song \"Higher Learning\" on his album TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition. In 2014, Kalamazoo was mentioned again by Rittz in the song \"Bounce\" on his album Next to Nothing.[126][142]\n\nThe \"Kalamazoo\" was one of several names of a railroad handcar that was produced by the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company.[143]\n\nIn Dr. Seuss's classic children's book Horton Hatches the Egg, Horton the Elephant visits Kalamazoo while he is in the circus.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nMain category: People from Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nSister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Kalamazoo, Michigan has three sister cities.\n\nKingston, Jamaica\n\nNumazu, Shizuoka, Japan\n\nPushkin, St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMichigan portal\n\nList of mayors of Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nKalamazoo Department of Public Safety\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
