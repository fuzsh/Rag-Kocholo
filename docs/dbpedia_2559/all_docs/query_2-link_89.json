        "text": "Do you earn tips? Plenty of employees in Michigan do, including those who wait tables, serve and mix drinks, open doors, carry luggage, clean hotel rooms, or provide other services, from moving furniture to delivering newspapers. In fact, some employees earn more in tips from satisfied customers than in straight wages paid by their employers.\n\nWhen you receive tips as part of your compensation, your legal rights under wage and hour laws become a bit more complicated. The rules about what counts as a tip, how much your employer must pay you, and whether you have to contribute to a tip pool (among other things) all depend on the laws of your state. Although federal law also covers these issues, employers must follow whichever law—federal, state, or even local—is the most generous to employees.\n\nHere's what you need to know about federal and Michigan legal protections for employees who receive tips. You can find out more about Michigan minimum wage, tip rules, overtime standards, and other wage and hour issues at the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.\n\nTip Basics\n\nThe basic rule of tips, under federal law and state law, is that they belong to the employee, not the employer. Employers may not require employees to hand over their tips unless one of these exceptions applies:\n\nState law allows the employer to take a tip credit. Some states allow the employer to count all or part of an employee's tips towards its minimum wage obligations. Although the employer doesn't technically \"take\" the employee's tips, the employer gets to count some tips as if the employer had paid them directly to the employee. Michigan allows a tip credit, as explained below.\n\nThe employee is part of a valid tip pool. Under federal law and in most states, employees can be required to pay part of their tips into a tip pool to be shared with other employees.\n\nCan Employers Take a Tip Credit in Michigan?\n\nMinimum wage laws protect all employees, whether or not they receive tips. Employees are entitled to earn the full minimum wage per hour as set by federal law, or if higher, state law. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. The minimum wage in Michigan is $10.33 an hour, as of January 1, 2024.\n\nUnder federal law and in most states, employers may pay tipped employees less than the minimum wage, as long as employees earn enough in tips to make up the difference. This is called a \"tip credit.\" The credit is the amount the employer doesn't have to pay, so the applicable minimum wage (federal or state) less the tip credit is the least the employer can pay tipped employees per hour. If an employee doesn't make enough in tips during a given workweek to earn at least the applicable minimum wage for each hour worked, the employer has to pay the difference.\n\nMichigan law allows employers to claim a tip credit, as long as they inform employees beforehand. In 2024, employers must pay tipped employees at least $3.93 an hour. This means that employers may take a tip credit of up to $6.40 an hour, as long as the employee makes at least $10.33 an hour with tips.\n\nIs Tip Pooling Allowed in Michigan?\n\nMany states, including Michigan, allow employers to require tip pooling or \"tipping out.\" All employees subject to the pool have to chip in a portion of their tips, which are then divided among a group of employees.\n\nEmployers must notify employees of the tip pool in advance. In addition, employees can't be required to pay more into the pool than is customary and reasonable, and the employee must be able to keep at least the full minimum wage. (In other words, if the employer takes a tip credit, the employer can count only the tips the employee gets to take home against its minimum wage obligation.)\n\nUnder federal law, if the employer claims a tip credit, then only employees who regularly receive tips can be part of the tip pool. Employees can't be required to share their tips with employees who don't usually receive their own tips, like dishwashers or cooks, unless the employer doesn't claim a tip credit and pays the employee the minimum wage directly. And tips from a tip pool can't go to the employer, managers, or supervisors.\n\nWhat Counts as a Tip?\n\nIt's not as easy as you might think to figure out exactly how much of what a customer pays is a \"tip.\" If the customer pays in cash and tipping is voluntary, whatever amount the customer leaves over and above the charge for products or services (plus tax) is a tip. However, if the employer imposes a mandatory service charge, or the customer pays by credit card, the rules might be different.\n\nIs a Mandatory Service Charge a Tip?\n\nSome restaurants tack a \"mandatory service charge\" on to bills for large tables of diners, private parties, or catered events. Under federal law and in most states, this isn't considered a tip. Even if the customer thinks that money is going to you and doesn't leave anything extra on the table, your employer can keep any money designated as a \"service charge.\" The law generally considers this part of the contract between the patron and the establishment, not a voluntary acknowledgment of good service by an employee. Many employers give at least part of these service charges to employees, but that's the employer's choice: Employees have no legal right to that money.\n\nA couple of states have different rules, intended to make sure that customers know whether their money is going to the employer or the server. Michigan law is not one of them, however.\n\nAccording to IRS rules, any portion of a mandatory service charge that the employer pays out to employees must be treated as wages, not tips. This means the employer must withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare (FICA) tax on these amounts, may not claim a credit against its tax obligations for these amounts (as it can for tips), and must include them as part of the employee's hourly wage when determining overtime payments, among other things.\n\nThe rule applies only to mandatory service charges. For the amount to count as a tip rather than a service charge, all of the following must be true:\n\nThe payment must be entirely voluntary\n\nThe customer must have the unrestricted right to determine the amount\n\nThe amount cannot be set by employer policy or subject to negotiation with the employer.\n\nThe customer must have the right to determine who receives the payment.\n\nCredit Card Charges\n\nState rules differ as to whether employees are entitled to the full amount of a tip left by credit card. If the employer has to pay the credit card company a processing fee, some states allow the employer to subtract a proportionate amount of the tip to cover the employee's \"share\" of the fee. For example, if the credit card company charges a 3% fee, the employer could legally reduce the employee's tip by 3% as well.\n\nMichigan law does not expressly address this issue.\n\nAre Tipped Employees Entitled to Overtime?\n\nLike many other employees, tipped employees are entitled to time-and-a-half for all hours worked over 40 per week.\n\nAssuming the employer takes a tip credit, you calculate the overtime rate based on the full minimum wage, not the lower tipped minimum wage."
