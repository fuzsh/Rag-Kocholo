        "text": "I‚Äôm always looking out for new Japanese literature, so when I heard about a fun-sounding book with some good reviews, I tried to get a review copy. Alas, despite several promising leads, nothing eventuated, but my back-up plan (putting a hold on a copy at the local library) eventually came good. And I‚Äôm happy to say that it was worth the wait ‚Äì it was, as expected, a fun read, but one with an unexpectedly serious side‚Ä¶\n\n*****\n\nKikuko Tsumura‚Äôs There‚Äôs No Such Thing as an Easy Job (translated by Polly Barton) is the story of a Japanese woman in her mid-thirties who quit her long-time job after burning out. Months later, her unemployment benefits have run out, so now it‚Äôs time to get back on the horse, with the help of the kind recruiter Mrs. Masakado:\n\n‚ÄúFor the present, I don‚Äôt recommend falling into a love-hate relationship with your work,‚Äù my recruiter Mrs Masakado had advised me at our very first meeting. Rather than doing the kind of job where I‚Äôd be involved with lots of people and become a central pillar of the establishment, I was better off in a role that I could fulfil calmly and peaceably.\n\np.183 (Bloomsbury, 2020)\n\nThat‚Äôs just what the woman wants, and having requested ‚Äòan easy job‚Äô, over the course of a year she tries out five different opportunities that all seem simple enough at first. Each, however, has its own challenges and pitfalls, and as the number of failures mount up, she begins to wonder whether she‚Äôll ever find the one that‚Äôs just right for her.\n\nThere‚Äôs No Such Thing as an Easy Job is an entertaining book, a story reflecting the lives of many people (myself included) who struggle to adapt to the nine-to-five grind. Japan is a society where graduation-to-retirement jobs used to be the norm, and getting a good position was seen as a goal in itself. However, the younger generations aren‚Äôt quite so sure about that, and many people aren‚Äôt keen on the idea of slaving away for decades at something that stresses them out ‚Äì which is exactly the case for our narrator.\n\nThe structure of the book is straight-forward enough. There are five sections for five jobs as the protagonist attempts to ease her way back into the working world. We begin with easy desk jobs, involving surveillance, creating bus advertisements and thinking up cracker-packet slogans. Once those options fall through, there‚Äôs a shift to more physical work, such as putting up posters and helping out in a forest inside a large urban park. Each of these anecdotes could almost be read as individual stories, five fun descriptions of very different jobs.\n\nIn fact, these disparate sections come together very cleverly to form an intriguing novel, where the more we read, the better the picture we get of the narrator. We empathise with her feelings of stress and slowly get to know her character, and the serious way she approaches all the jobs. As it turns out, she‚Äôs someone who is good at, and enjoys, work ‚Äì perhaps a little *too* much. The book rarely encroaches upon her life outside work, perhaps with good reason.\n\nThe book starts rather slowly, with the first section, in which the woman watches CCTV footage of a writer suspected of having received stolen goods, probably my least favourite part. However, it improves quickly as the scope widens. There are her repeated trips back to Mrs Masakado, head hung in shame at having quit another job, as well as all the people she meets and the friends she makes along the way. By the time we get to the final section, the book has become a novel, with subtle nods back to her previous jobs, and it‚Äôs all the better for it.\n\nWhile Tsumura‚Äôs work is seemingly about jobs, in truth it‚Äôs just as much about people. The book explores the character of its protagonist, a woman taking time out to explore her feelings and work out what she really wants from life, but it also makes her reflect on those she meets along the way:\n\nAs I nodded, it struck me that I knew virtually nothing about Mr Monaga. Not that I needed to know anything, of course. I‚Äôd realised after my first two years of employment that, so long as your colleagues presented you with ‚Äògood interface‚Äô while they were at work, it didn‚Äôt really matter what kind of people they were outside of it. (p.278)\n\nThis opinion is one challenged by her year of casual work, though. As she starts to pay more attention to those around her, she realises she‚Äôs far from the only one struggling. It‚Äôs no coincidence that in most of her jobs she‚Äôs jumping in to cover someone who has needed to take some time out ‚Äì the problem of burnout is seemingly a universal issue.\n\nThere‚Äôs an interesting front-cover blurb from the Observer on my library copy, simply saying ‚ÄòSurreal and unsettling‚Äò. That‚Äôs probably a slight exaggeration, but there‚Äôs certainly an unusual side to the book, and not everything is as plain as it might first appear:\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else I‚Äôd like you to do in addition to all that,‚Äù said Mr Kazetani, the head of department who had also interviewed me, his face assuming a peculiar expression. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd also like you to keep an eye on Ms Eriguchi.‚Äù (p.72)\n\nEach of the jobs has its curious side, whether that involves the enigmatic Ms Eriguchi at the bus advertising job, and her uncanny ability to advertise businesses that have just opened, or the strange nature of the postering job, with a rival flyposter organisation that is far more than it seems. Tsumura seems to be suggesting that no job is *just* a job, with all kinds of work eventually bringing you to something you didn‚Äôt see in the role description.\n\nThe book culminates with (deep breath) the easy job in the hut in the big forest, and it‚Äôs here that the story all comes together as the various strands converge in an unlikely setting, leaving us to ponder the link between burnout, food, fresh air and‚Ä¶ football? Yes, that‚Äôs right, and in a clever twist, the (imaginary) Cangrejo ≈åbayashi club are an integral part of the story. The unlikely name (although anyone with a passing knowledge of the J-League will know that there far more exotic names out there..) actually comes from a Spanish word for crab. However, a quick Google search reveals that cangrejo, in some Latin-American variants of Spanish, can mean ‚Äòmystery‚Äô. I, for one, suspect this is no coincidence‚Ä¶\n\nBefore starting There‚Äôs No Such Thing as an Easy Job, I had a suspicion that it might be a rather light, fluffy read, but while it is a book you‚Äôll race through (with Barton‚Äôs excellent version of the book helping here), it‚Äôs actually a thoughtful examination of the modern working world, and the pressure it places on those who work there. As you follow the narrator through her trials, you may well come to the conclusion that the legendary ‚Äòeasy job‚Äô is a myth. But is that what people really want, anyway, or does everyone just need some time to work out what suits them best? I‚Äôm afraid to say that if you‚Äôre expecting me to answer that question, you‚Äôre out of luck, but if I do ever find out what working life is all about, I‚Äôll be sure to let you all know üôÇ"
