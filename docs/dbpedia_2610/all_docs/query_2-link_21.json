        "text": "Organising/planning events is not simple at all. It could be defined as the precise combination of opposing elements. You have to be technical, but creative. You have to be realistic, but highly curious, such a dreamer. You have to be down-to-earth, but always innovative and up-to-date. You have to be fast and quick, but always patient and have an absolute friendly approach with the customer. Empathy is crucial: you cannot reply \"that's not possible\". You just have to find one or more viable alternatives, a suitable and feasible solution and exceed the customers' needs. This job constantly challenges you, but their satisfaction at the end of their trip, their incentive or their experiences is truly rewarding. As well as professionally growing in a little team of \"guerriere\" - is pleasing and amazing. So grateful and proud, I'd like to share this post with you. And, of course, I'm always ready for new and innovative challenges. #gratitude #eventmanagement #businesstravel\n\n#Tourism ‚úàÔ∏è The impact of last year‚Äôs international airport inauguration in Brasov is visible: a record number of 1,300 hotel rooms, internationally affiliated, are under development with delivery dates between 2024 and 2028. üè® The number of hotel rooms on 5-star category will increase with 128% over the next three years, following the new inaugurations. üé§ Mircea Ioan DRAGHICI, Managing Partner, Est Hospitality: ‚ÄúIn 2023, tourist arrivals and overnights are still below the levels of 2019. The trend is very positive, and it is expected to continue in the coming years due to increased traffic at the new airport, the pipeline of new branded hotels and the number of festivals & increased number of MICE events (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions)‚Äù.

Similarweb Digital Data reveals a year-over-year decline in Paris hotel bookings from the top 10 tourist countries, except for the US. Why? Perhaps because you can better enjoy the wine, croissants, the Louvre, and the overall ambiance without the heavy security and increased prices of the Olympics. Meanwhile, smaller countries like Serbia and Croatia saw a huge spike in tourism to the French capital, possibly due to popular athletes representing them in the games and general love for sports.
