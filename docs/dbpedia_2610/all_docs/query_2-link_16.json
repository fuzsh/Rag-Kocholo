        "text": "Winners vs predictions\n\n[the next day]\n\nPhew! What an intense evening. One media outlet described it as ‚Äúbeset by chaos‚Äù, and there was certainly a lot of drama ‚Äì from the last minute disqualification of the Netherlands entry to the various geo-political gestures and commentaries. My team and I did pretty well this year ‚Äì we predicted the top 2 (juxtaposed) and all 7 of my Top 10 nods were correct.\n\nThe blogging highlight for me was the discovery/invention of the EPC (Eurovision Population Coefficient) statistic ‚Äì see Luxembourg commentary below. It‚Äôs a way of measuring Eurovision winning history per head of population (Luxembourg, Ireland, and Estonia lead the pack). I hope this can become a thing at Eurovision from now on.\n\nOriginal live* analysis and predictions below\n\nWelcome to the Eurovision live musicology blog, now in its 13th year. For context, here‚Äôs the 2020 10-year corpus research summary, and the archive of all the posts in reverse order.\n\nTonight I‚Äôm pleased to welcome guest blogger and UK-based copyright analyst Maddy Plummer, who has provided additional research, as well as her own reviews for UK, Austria, Armenia, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal. Additional research was provided by the estimable Rafi Waters, who has done a terrific job working on the BPMs and chord loops. I should also add that he is graduating from Berklee today ‚Äì congratulations Rafi!\n\nAs always, I‚Äôve provided commentary on each song, so you can follow along with the show, or (later) watch the embedded videos. And I‚Äôm going to try to predict the winner, before voting begins, then leave the prediction up here for posterity when the votes are in.\n\nAmericans ‚Äì the show goes out live at 3pm Eastern time on Saturday May 11, 2024. You can watch live with a free Peacock TV account.\n\nEuropeans ‚Äì you know the drill.\n\n* I have actually pre-blogged everything based on the Spotify Eurovision finalists playlist, but the blog is published on the day of the final (before the voting begins) so should be read live alongside the show as it is broadcast.\n\nPredictions 2024\n\nHere are my predictions for 2024, made at 12.50 US Eastern time (18.50 Swedish time), before the show starts in Malm√∂:\n\nCroatia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIsrael\n\nFrance, Ukraine, Ireland, and Italy to place in the top 10.\n\n(I‚Äôll be watching the show as it goes out, so may change these predictions as I see the performances ‚Äì but will be sure to lock it all down before voting begins!)\n\nLet‚Äôs do this!\n\n01 üá∏üá™ ‚Ä¢ Sweden ‚Ä¢ Unforgettable\n\nMarcus & Martinus ‚Ä¢ 117 ‚Ä¢ C#m\n\nSongwriters: Jimmy ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù Th√∂rnfeldt, Joy Deb, Linnea Deb, Marcus Gunnarsen, Martinus Gunnarsen\n\nWhat a great way to open the show. Yes, I know the opener and closer are randomly selected, but the dice have fallen fortuitously tonight (more on dice-rolling when we get to Greece later on). This is the sort of thing we‚Äôve come to expect from the Swedes ‚Äì Electro-pop minor-key bangers, sung in English at around 120BPM with pounding analogue synths, super dry four-on-the-floor kick drum, and lots of those ‚Äòrisers‚Äô ‚Äì the rocket-effect synth lifts that take you into each chorus. Similar songs include ‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù by Loreen (2012), ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù by M√•ns Zelmerl√∂w (2015), ‚ÄúDance You Off‚Äù by Benjamin Ingrosso (2018), and of course last year‚Äôs winner ‚ÄúTattoo‚Äù by Loreen (2023). And what‚Äôs to hate? They do it so well. This is why my pretty good ESC batting average holds up ‚Äì I always believe in Sweden.\n\nMarcus and Martinus‚Äôs performance looks ‚Äì and sounds ‚Äì like the VR game Beat Saber. The arrangement is all rising ramps. The kick drum stays away until the second verse ‚Äúchew you up‚Äù, then drops out after only 8 bars so the first pre-chorus has no drums at all. Then everything drips in during the first chorus over each title repeat: kick and bass, then 2x octave synth, short drums tacet for 2 beats, giving us space to feel the beat on the next prechorus. It‚Äôs as if a DJ took over the songwriting, and this technique ‚Äì of simply dropping instruments in and out ‚Äì creates a fantastic journey for the dance floor, if it‚Äôs used with the right timing. I love the extra bar just before the title hook, manipulating the phrase length to keep the dancers interested (it‚Äôs an old ABBA trick). For me, it feels like it never quite hits top gear. This is partly because the melody never goes beyond a limited range of a 5th ‚Äì highest note is G#4, lowest is C#4. And the chord loop is (understandably) the same throughout ‚Äì | C#m | C#m | A | F#m |.\n\nSo this is another one of ‚Äúthose Swedish dance songs‚Äù that Eurovision has loved so many times. It‚Äôs good, but not exceptional enough to stick in the memory after the laser lights have faded. Maybe that title is asking for too much.\n\n82%\n\nShe comes alive at night\n\nWhen her prey‚Äôs asleep\n\nMake your eyes go blind\n\nAnd now you‚Äôre in too deep\n\nShe gon‚Äô chew you up\n\nAnd leave you empty, hollow\n\nThen she‚Äôll spit you out\n\nAnyway, I follow\n\nShe gon‚Äô hurt you bad\n\nBut it feels so good\n\nI don‚Äôt care\n\nNo, I don‚Äôt care\n\nYou better know she‚Äôs dangerous\n\nShe is unforgettable (unforgettable)\n\nAnd it feels so good, it hurts\n\nShe is unforgettable\n\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nHer love is venomous\n\nIt‚Äôs getting serious (it‚Äôs getting serious)\n\nShe gon‚Äô chew you up\n\nAnd leave you empty, hollow\n\nThen she‚Äôll spit you out\n\nAnyway, I follow\n\nShe gon‚Äô hurt you bad\n\nBut it feels so good\n\nI don‚Äôt care\n\nNo, I don‚Äôt care\n\nYou better know she‚Äôs dangerous\n\nShe is unforgettable (unforgettable)\n\nAnd it feels so good, it hurts\n\nShe is unforgettable\n\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nOh\n\nHer love is dangerous\n\nAnd I know it, it‚Äôs venomous\n\n‚ÄòCause I feel it inside of me\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\nHer love is dangerous\n\nAnd I know it, it‚Äôs venomous\n\n‚ÄòCause I feel it inside of me\n\nShe‚Äôs unforgettable\n\n‚Äî\n\n02 üá∫üá¶ ‚Ä¢ Ukraine ‚Ä¢ Teresa & Maria\n\nalyona alyona & J. Heil ‚Ä¢ 114 ‚Ä¢ G Aeolian\n\nSongwriters: Aliona Savranenko, Anton Chilibi, Ivan Klymenko, Yana Shemaieva\n\nIn my 2020 Eurovision research we analysed 259 ESC songs 2010-2019 and categorised them according to various themes: Love, Unity, Self-Assertion, Partying, History, and songs about music/dancing. ‚ÄúTeresa & Maria‚Äù covers at least three of these, plus Catholicism, old-school seasonal metaphysics, anti-war sentiments, and life-is-short existentialism thrown in. The message seems to be ‚Äúseize the day‚Äù and Jerry and alyona are selling it well with some joyful vocals and an in-yer-face rap breakdown section. Sonically, it‚Äôs an updated Enigma approach; with hypnotic chanting vocals over a Euro-friendly chord loop | Gm F | Cm Eb | and a super basic four on the floor rock beat.\n\nWe know there‚Äôs a lot of love for the Ukranians right now, and I think this is as good as their winning ‚ÄúStefania‚Äù from 2022 (similar approach in the chorus vocals). It‚Äôs good. But is it good enough to beat the Croatians?\n\n83%\n\nSpri-spri-spring\n\nCarves its way\n\nNo matter-no matter what\n\nShe carries the weight of the world\n\nOn her shoulders\n\nThe pa-pa-path\n\nIs winding and rocky\n\nBut you should know: your own happiness\n\nIs in your hands\n\nCome on, baby, shine\n\nI‚Äôm not holy, I‚Äôm alive\n\nMother Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us\n\nBarefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground\n\nWith us are Mother Teresa and Virgin Mary\n\nAll the divas were born as human beings\n\nMother Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us\n\nBarefoot, as if on a blade, they walked on the ground\n\nWith us are Mother Teresa and Virgin Mary\n\nAll the divas were born as human beings\n\nEven when we were little, we searched for a path\n\nBut life is like a loop for those who are falling\n\nA girl, who is still so young,\n\nCarries a burden of pain\n\nOn her shoulders, seeing it as a flaw\n\nAgain not as she should be, either too soft\n\nOr skinny like a twig, half-naked or going down the aisle\n\nWhere is your child?

But if Isaak‚Äôs smiley and charismatic performance is any indicator, he seems pretty happy with his lot. The delivery is very Lewis Capaldi, and I suspect his selection at Germany‚Äôs ‚ÄúDas deutsche Finale‚Äù had something to do with his great vocal tone. Clearly the writing team wants to exploit that, so we hear parts of Always On The Run in two different octaves, with the bridge ‚ÄúRun from the silence, screamin‚Äô for guidance‚Äù beginning in his baritone range, bottoming out at c#3. When it goes up the octave 4 bars later he has to hit A#4 ‚Äì quite a spread for (what sounds to me like) an intuitive, non-trained singer. Given that my first listens were based on the German national final, he wasn‚Äôt quite managing the lower pitches accurately when singing live (and remember the ESC rules require lead vocals to be fully live). So I‚Äôm listening carefully to see if he nails it.\n\nHarmonically, we‚Äôre in the ESC-friendly Aeolian mode (natural minor scale). Everything is a 4 or 8-bar loop harmonically; the verses are | Bbm | Bbm | Db | Db | Ebm | Ebm | Bbm | Bbm | (oooh distorted plectrum electric bass ‚Äì nice!) and the chorus paces up the harmonic rhythm | Gb | Ebm | Bbm | Ab | (x2). The ‚ÄúRun from the silence‚Äù bridge uses the chorus chords in a different order | Gb | Ebm | Bbm | Ab | (x4). If the singing is on the money tonight, I‚Äôd place this on in the upper-middle of the pack.\n\n80%\n\n(Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)\n\nI am nothin‚Äô but the average\n\nEven though I‚Äôm special to some\n\nI can‚Äôt refuse, I‚Äôm going under\n\nNo one gives a shit about what‚Äôs soon to come\n\nWhat‚Äôs soon to come\n\nI know my blessing with the privilege\n\nOf doin‚Äô anything I want\n\nBut I don‚Äôt feel like getting stronger\n\nIn my mind, it‚Äôs just a game that can‚Äôt be won\n\nThat can‚Äôt be won\n\nI‚Äôm always on the run, run, run, run\n\nClose, but never done, done, done, done\n\nI can‚Äôt break out when I‚Äôm free\n\nLost in my own identity\n\nI‚Äôm on the run, run, run, run\n\nI‚Äôm always on the run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nRun, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\n(It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on the) Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nRun, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nAll I do is keep my head up\n\nBut it‚Äôs time to keep the pace\n\nLike I‚Äôm haunted by the voices deep within\n\nOh, they‚Äôre just never gonna fade\n\nNot gonna fade\n\nI‚Äôm always on the run, run, run, run\n\nClose, but never done, done, done, done\n\nI can‚Äôt break out when I‚Äôm free\n\nLost in my own identity\n\nI‚Äôm on the run, run, run, run\n\nI‚Äôm always on the run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nRun, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\n(It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on the) Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nRun, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy\n\nRun from the silence, screamin‚Äô for guidance\n\nWho am I fighting for?\n\nGet out of my head, I‚Äôm so sick and tired\n\nCan‚Äôt do this anymore\n\nRun from the silence, screamin‚Äô for guidance\n\nWho am I fighting for?\n\nGet out of my head, I‚Äôm so sick and tired\n\nCan‚Äôt do this anymore\n\nRun from the silence, screamin‚Äô for guidance (Run, na-na-ayy, run, na-na-ayy)\n\nWho am I fighting for?

They have been absent from the contest since 1993. Before that, they won a remarkable 5 times (1961, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1983) ‚Äì not bad for a country of less than a million people.\n\nThis information has inspired me to create a new statistics game. If we know the population of a European country, the number of times they‚Äôve entered Eurovision, and the number of times they‚Äôve won, we can create a win-rate ‚Äòscore‚Äô, prorated for the size of the country. I‚Äôm going to call it the ‚ÄúEurovision Population Coefficient‚Äù (EPC). It measures the proportional level of Eurovision-win talent in each citizen. Here is the formula.\n\nIf we multiply this number by 1 million this provides a wins-per-million (WPM) stat in the population. Here are the EPC scores across the whole history of the Contest 1956-2023, for the top 20 of tonight‚Äôs finalists. As expected, Luxembourg has the highest EPC by a huge margin. To beat them, Ireland is going to have to really ramp up the wins in future. Or join the Schengen area and start a mass emigration scheme to Luxembourg‚Ä¶\n\nLuxembourg: Wins 5, Entries 38, Population 0.63M, EPC 1035.65\n\nIreland: Wins 7, Entries 54, Population 4.99M, EPC 163.83\n\nEstonia: Wins 1, Entries 28, Population 1.33M, EPC 26.82\n\nIsrael: Wins 4, Entries 43, Population 9.29M, EPC 19.55\n\nNorway: Wins 3, Entries 61, Population 5.4M, EPC 15.22\n\nLatvia: Wins 1, Entries 21, Population 1.86M, EPC 14.64\n\nNetherlands: Wins 5, Entries 62, Population 17.44M, EPC 8.25\n\nSweden: Wins 6, Entries 60, Population 10.35M, EPC 0.58\n\nSerbia: Wins 1, Entries 13, Population 6.92M, EPC 2.09\n\nUkraine: Wins 3, Entries 17, Population 41.3M, EPC 0.12\n\nItaly: Wins 3, Entries 46, Population 60.36M, EPC 0.46\n\nSwitzerland: Wins 2, Entries 61, Population 8.57M, EPC 0.43\n\nAustria: Wins 2, Entries 53, Population 9.01M, EPC 0.43\n\nFinland: Wins 1, Entries 54, Population 5.54M, EPC 0.33\n\nSpain: Wins 2, Entries 61, Population 47.35M, EPC 0.36\n\nGreece: Wins 1, Entries 42, Population 10.42M, EPC 0.23\n\nUnited Kingdom: Wins 5, Entries 64, Population 67.22M, EPC 0.18\n\nFrance: Wins 5, Entries 64, Population 67.39M, EPC 0.18\n\nPortugal: Wins 1, Entries 53, Population 10.28M, EPC 0.18\n\nGermany: Wins 2, Entries 64, Population 83.2M, EPC 0.01\n\nAnyway, back to the song. Luxembourg are celebrating their return with this fun upper-middle-ranking entry. More of the almost-cumbia minor-key groove material that we‚Äôve seen so much of in the last 10 years or so (and more since Despacito).

The chorus opening ‚Äúpromise me you‚Äôll hold me again‚Äù starts off on a chord of Am, with Eden leaning on the same/equivalent note as starts France‚Äôs Mon Amour. There are a couple of moments where the safeness recedes ‚Äì I like the cross-beat rhymes of the pre chorus ‚ÄúHours and hours, empowers / Life is no game but it‚Äôs ours‚Äù. The production gives us some great ear candy ‚Äì the 8th-note echoed water droplets after chorus 1 are very cool ‚Äì and Eden does a great job with the up-the-octave theme after the final chorus. The chorus chord loop feels familiar but isn‚Äôt ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually quite tough to find a lot of songs with (in G major) | Am | Em | G | D | (ii-vi-I-V). Quite an achievement to find a relatively unusual combination of the world‚Äôs favourite chords!\n\nAs disclaimer‚Äôd above, I make no comment on the politics, but I think this one could do really well.\n\n86%\n\nWriter of my symphony\n\nPlay with me\n\nLook into my eyes and see\n\nPeople walk away but never say goodbye\n\nSomeone stole the moon tonight\n\nTook my light\n\nEverything is black and white\n\nWho‚Äôs the fool who told you boys don‚Äôt cry?\n\nHours and hours, empowers\n\nLife is no game but it‚Äôs ours\n\nWhile the time goes wild\n\nEveryday I‚Äôm losing my mind\n\nHolding on in this mysterious ride\n\nDancing in the storm\n\nI got nothing to hide\n\nTake it all and leave the world behind\n\nBaby promise me you‚Äôll hold me again\n\nI‚Äôm still broken from this hurricane\n\nThis hurricane\n\nLiving in a fantasy, ecstasy\n\nEverything is meant to be\n\nWe shall pass but love will never die\n\nHours and hours, empowers\n\nLife is no game but it‚Äôs ours\n\nWhile the time goes wild\n\nEveryday I‚Äôm losing my mind\n\nHolding on in this mysterious ride\n\nDancing in the storm\n\nI got nothing to hide\n\nTake it all and leave the world behind\n\nBaby promise me you‚Äôll hold me again\n\nI‚Äôm still broken from this hurricane\n\nThis hurricane\n\nThis hurricane\n\n◊ú◊ê ◊¶◊®◊ô◊ö ◊û◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú◊ï◊™ Lo tzarich milim gdolot\n\n◊®◊ß ◊™◊§◊ô◊ú◊ï◊™ Rak tfilot\n\n◊ê◊§◊ô◊ú◊ï ◊ê◊ù ◊ß◊©◊î ◊ú◊®◊ê◊ï◊™ Afilu im kashe lir‚Äôot\n\n◊™◊û◊ô◊ì ◊ê◊™◊î ◊û◊©◊ê◊ô◊® ◊ú◊ô Tamid ata mash‚Äôir li\n\n◊ê◊ï◊® ◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊ß◊ò◊ü Or echad katan\n\n‚Äî\n\n06 üá±üáπ Lithuania ‚Ä¢ Luktelk\n\nSilvester Belt ‚Ä¢ 140 ‚Ä¢ E minor\n\nSongwriters: Silvestras Beltƒó (Silvester Belt) , D≈æesika ≈†yvokaitƒó (Jessica Shy) & Elena Jurgaitytƒó (Elayork)\n\nStarts boldly, with the filtered organ part from The Who‚Äôs Won‚Äôt Get Fooled Again. Then the beat drops, and it‚Äôs pretty sparse ‚Äì techno drum machine and synth bass all the way. This is one of many songs tonight that deals with themes of emergence, opportunity, breaking the routine, and finding fulfilment, perhaps through love. ‚ÄòLuktelk‚Äô means ‚Äòwait‚Äô, and it seems to be an exhortation to understanding, as the protagonist shares his responsibility to dance & party, even though he initially doesn‚Äôt feel it. I admire the bleak-at-first glance couplet ‚ÄúStovime tyloje grojanƒçio radijo / Nebenoriu ≈°okt, nebenoriu ≈°okt‚Äù (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre standing in the silence of the radio playing / I don‚Äôt wanna dance, but I have to dance.‚Äù). Being stuck indoors throughout 2020 sure did get some songwriters dreaming of a better tomorrow.\n\nThe musical backbone of the verses and choruses is a 2-chord 4-bar pattern | Em | Em | Bm | Bm |, apart from a short post-chorus section with no drums that briefly takes us to G major, and also the bridge, which is a descending | Em | D | C | A |. I particularly liked that A major chord at the end of the first repeat, bringing just 4 beats of dorian mode to the song, which is enough of a surprise for the 2-chord loop to drive a sense of chorus-y familiarity when it returns.\n\nSilvester is a deeply engaging performer ‚Äì he‚Äôs dancing throughout and enjoying the moment, all the while waving his arms as if he‚Äôs spinning invisible DJ decks.

Enter wife and husband Spanish pop duo Nebulossa! Initially criticised for being ‚Äòoverly sexist‚Äô, the lyrics for this song were rewritten. Quick etymology lesson: The title of the song, repeated multiple times in the lyrics, literally means ‚Äúvixen‚Äù (i.e. a female fox), however I have come to understand that in Spanish slang, ‚ÄòZorra,‚Äô is a derogatory term for a woman and has vulgar connotations. Adding insult to injury, the euphemistic meaning of the male equivalent, ‚ÄòZorro‚Äô, has positive connotations. Let‚Äôs see how the attempt to reappropriate and subvert the term translates on the live stage; historically speaking, meta-commentary has not always been palatably received among Eurovision‚Äôs more earnest folk, (see Mae Muller 2023, who came 25th). The song itself has an 80s-feel four-to-the-floor electro beat (complete with Simmons drums on stage!). The slow-release low-pass filter on the intro is straight out of Madonna‚Äôs Stuck On You, which combines well with Mar√≠a‚Äôs soft monosyllabic vocals. The formulaic structure prevents much musical progression, but the chord sequence of F / G / Am / Em with the emphatic ascending minor pentatonic fragment of A / D/ E / G in the bass at the end of each chorus, is a great compositional choice. The vocal is somehow simultaneously sullen and vibrant, which works well in conjunction with the brash and outrageously satirical lyrics. A genuinely interesting entry, I hope the voters have a dark sense of humour.\n\n71%\n\nSpanish\n\nZorra, zorra, zorra\n\nZorra, zorra, zorra\n\nYa s√© que soy solo una zorra\n\nQue mi pasado te devora\n\nYa s√© que soy la oveja negra\n\nLa incomprendida, la de piedra\n\nYa s√© que no soy quien t√∫ quieres (lo s√©)\n\nEntiendo que te desespere (lo s√©)\n\nPero esta es mi naturaleza\n\nCambiar por ti me da pereza\n\nEstoy en un buen momento\n\nSolo era cuesti√≥n de tiempo\n\nVoy a salir a la calle a gritar lo que siento\n\nA los cuatro vientos\n\nSi salgo sola soy la zorra\n\nSi me divierto, la m√°s zorra\n\nSi alargo y se me hace de d√≠a\n\nSoy m√°s zorra todav√≠a\n\nCuando consigo lo que quiero (zorra, zorra)\n\nJam√°s es porque lo merezco (zorra, zorra)\n\nY aunque me est√© comiendo el mundo\n\nNo se valora ni un segundo\n\nEstoy en un buen momento\n\nSolo era cuesti√≥n de tiempo\n\nVoy a salir a la calle a gritar lo que siento\n\nA los cuatro vientos\n\nEstoy en un buen momento (zorra, zorra)\n\nReconstruida por dentro (zorra, zorra)\n\nY esa zorra que tanto tem√≠as se fue empoderando\n\nY ahora es una zorra de postal (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nA la que ya no le va mal (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nA la que todo le da igual\n\nLap√≠dame, si ya total\n\nSoy una zorra de postal\n\nYo soy una mujer real (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nY si me pongo visceral (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nDe zorra pasar√© a chacal, te habr√°s metido en un zarzal\n\nSoy una zorra de postal (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nEstoy en un buen momento\n\nSolo era cuesti√≥n de tiempo\n\nVoy a salir a la calle a gritar lo que siento\n\nA los cuatro vientos\n\nEstoy en un buen momento (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nReconstruida por dentro (zorra, zorra, zorra)\n\nY esa zorra que tanto tem√≠as se fue empoderando\n\nY ahora es una zorra de postal\n\nEnglish\n\n(b***h, b***h)\n\n(b***h, b***h)\n\n(b***h, b***h)\n\nI know I‚Äôm just a b***h\n\nThat my past devours you\n\nI know I‚Äôm the black sheep\n\nThe misunderstood, the stone one\n\nI know I‚Äôm not who you want (I know)\n\nI understand that I despair you (I know)\n\nBut this is my nature\n\nTo change for you makes me lazy\n\nI‚Äôm in a good moment\n\nIt was only a matter of time\n\nI‚Äôm gonna go out in the street and shout what I‚Äôm feeling\n\nTo the four winds\n\nIf I go out alone, I‚Äôm the b***h\n\nIf I‚Äôm having fun, I‚Äôm the sluttiest\n\nIf I go long and it‚Äôs daylight\n\nI‚Äôm even sluttier\n\nWhen I get what I want (b***h, b***h)\n\nIt‚Äôs never because I deserve it (b***h, b***h)\n\nAnd even though I‚Äôm eating the world\n\nIt‚Äôs not worth a second\n\nI‚Äôm in a good moment\n\nIt was only a matter of time\n\nI‚Äôm gonna go out in the street and shout what I‚Äôm feeling\n\nTo the four winds\n\nI‚Äôm in a good time (b***h, b***h)\n\nRebuilt from the inside out (b***h, b***h)\n\nAnd that b***h that you feared so much has become empowered\n\nAnd now she‚Äôs a postcard b***h (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\nAnd now she‚Äôs a postcard b***h (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\nWho doesn‚Äôt care about anything\n\nThrow stones at me, who cares\n\nI‚Äôm a postcard b***h\n\nI‚Äôm a real woman (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\nAnd if I act viscerally (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\nI‚Äôll go from b***h to jackal, you‚Äôll open a can of worms\n\nI‚Äôm a postcard b***h (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\nI‚Äôm in a good moment\n\nIt was only a matter of time\n\nI‚Äôm gonna go out in the street and shout what I‚Äôm feeling\n\nTo the four winds\n\nI‚Äôm in a good time (b***h, b***h)\n\nRebuilt from the inside out (b***h, b***h)\n\nAnd that b***h that you feared so much has become empowered\n\nAnd now she‚Äôs a postcard b***h (b***h, b***h, b***h)\n\n‚Äî\n\n08 üá™üá™ Estonia | (nendest) narkootikumidest ei tea me (k√ºll) midagi\n\n5miinust & Puuluup ‚Ä¢ 145 ‚Ä¢ D minor\n\nLet‚Äôs start with a translation of that long title. It means ‚Äú(Really) we don‚Äôt know anything about (these) drugs‚Äù. It has broken the record for the longest ESC song title ever ‚Äì deposing San Marino from their top spot with 2012‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Social Network Song (Oh Oh ‚Äì Uh ‚Äì Oh Oh)‚Äù.\n\nThere are always interesting and exotic (to me) folk instruments in Eurovision, but there seems to be more of them this year. Estonian household name hip-hoppers 5miinust have teamed up with nu-folk duo Puuluup to deliver us this slice of hurtling Euro-techno, with the main riff played on duelling Estonian talharpas by Marko Veisson and Ramo Teder.\n\nIf this song is stuck in your head after it finishes, despite your lack of Estonian language skills, you can blame the hook usage ‚Äì the whole song consists of 8th note variations around D, C and A (mainly D). Bassline, talharpa riff, vocal line ‚Äì it‚Äôs relentless, but it totally works to maintain the frenetic pace of the song, especially considering we‚Äôre all the way up to 145 BPM, making this the 7th fastest song of the night, behind Latvia, Portugal, Switzerland, Finland, and Serbia. (The mean average tempo tonight is 126.2 ‚Äì around 6 BPM faster than most pop, but to be expected, given the smaller number of Big Ballads this year.)\n\nThere‚Äôs not a lot to be said about the songwriting ‚Äì it‚Äôs just that static melody and its variations over a chord loop (Dm x 4, Gm x 4). Just a container for the words and riffs.\n\nThe lyrics are a series of denials, protesting lack of knowledge of drugs, and listing the innocent items they prefer (Lays crisps, IPA beer, soda water, cider, vitamins). Their interrogators continue to accuse them of possession, and their righteous denials include the phrases ‚ÄúClouds and mushrooms ‚Äì where are your filaments / You turn my body on like a kitchen stove [‚Ä¶] Ducklings are small, but poppies are so tall‚Äù.

As an artist, they have taken a classic rags-to-witches route (ballet lessons, tattooist, musical theatre degree), resulting in the risk-taking song we‚Äôre hearing tonight. The charmingly un-Eurovision-y ‚ÄúDoomsday Blue‚Äù opens with the famous Harry Potter spell ‚ÄúAvada Kedavra‚Äù ‚Äì aka the ‚ÄúKilling Curse‚Äù, leading us into a pounding 12/8 verse that sounds a little like Marilyn Manson producing Lene Lovitch performing Bury a Friend in a church.\n\nUntil‚Ä¶ the chorus, which changes gear exactly on the barline to a completely unrelated major pentatonic acoustic section that I can only describe as‚Ä¶ pastoral. The grinding fuzzed-out guitars of the verse give way to fingerstyle acoustic major 7th chords, with only the kick drum reminding us of the sonic assault we just experienced, like the old man‚Äôs imagined heartbeat that forces the murderer to confess all in Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs Tell Tale Heart (perhaps Austria‚Äôs 2023 masterpiece Who The Hell Is Edgar is still possessing my spirit from the previous blog).\n\nChorus 2 is repeated, so we get 16 bars, which takes us just past two minutes, a point where almost all of tonight‚Äôs songs have moved into a breakdown, ready to ramp up to the final choruses. Here, Bambie is true to (song) form, although the drop is deliciously dark ‚Äì a droning synth bass moving down chromatically as Kate-Bush-esque vocals initially follow it downward. But even here we get more of the song‚Äôs split-personality approach, where a vocal sample from the chorus modalizes its major-ness so that the hook ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôd rather have the stars and the moon‚Äù comes out minor without changing a single note. And then there is no final chorus. This is the bravest break from Eurovision songwriting technique we‚Äôve heard all night ‚Äì it‚Äôs just ‚Äúblue, blue, blue‚Äù over and over, and I love the line that sets it up ‚Äúyour favourite colour / compared to the others‚Ä¶ is DOOM‚Äù.

Just 4 bars of minor chords in the low register of the piano; feels like he‚Äôs conjuring Adele‚Äôs Hello. The chord pattern establishes the verse accompaniment with | C#m / / B | E | F#m / / B | C#m / / G#m |. Melodically it‚Äôs a little meh in the verse, but this is explained when you get to the chorus, which is an almost identical melody, just an octave higher. It‚Äôs a solid stealth technique for helping us to remember the chorus, and a pleasingly short pre-chorus disguises the similarity.\n\nIt‚Äôs good to seem Latvia in the final after some years in the wilderness.

The protagonist in the story comes across as narcissistic, without really stating any malaise (what does it really mean to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna lose me so cruelly‚Äù?). I realise, of course, that some may interpret this as a positive anthem to self-care, but for Eurovision, this sort of introspective amateur psychology is not my idea of a good time. There seems to be a lot of Kierkegaardian anxiety around this year‚Äôs contest ‚Äì the Italians are getting in on it too. What happened to love, unity and dancing!

The video for the song has an extra meta-intro (which isn‚Äôt to be included in the final) of rather nice piano and (i think) bouzouki, leading us into the song itself, which starts with a single staccato saxophone note of E, played 4 to the bar. Annoyingly, while listening to this song I had to stop everything to figure out what double reed woodwind instrument is playing under the ‚ÄúTa Ta Ta‚Äù section (I went through aulos, chalumeau, karamuza, souravli, gaida, floghera, tsampouna, askomandoura, lalitsa, and mantoura before finally finding Zurna, courtesy of a site run by the Turkish government).\n\nA lot of the vocals here rely on some interesting digital processing effects, and the ESC rules state ‚ÄúNo on-stage contestant [‚Ä¶] shall be allowed to lip-sync in such a way as to give the impression that they are singing when they actually are not.‚Äù. I think they‚Äôre struck the right balance here: Marina really is singing (and really has the skills) but the obviously electronic bits have been left in. Good compromise.\n\nIt‚Äôs another of those Euro-reggaeton beats, and here it doesn‚Äôt dominate the track, rather just serving as a pop-friendly grid over which Marina‚Äôs vocal stylings can be presented. Great vocal, interesting melody.

Maddy Plummer]\n\nHas Olly Alexander saved us from national embarrassment with a revival of disco? It doesn‚Äôt feel like a winner, but this is a very valid entry, charged with 80s synth tones, church bells and a pulsing four-on-the-floor heartbeat that makes us want to fall to the floor! A BAFTA nominated actor and already well established frontman from chart topping band Years & Years, famous for songs like ‚ÄòKing‚Äô and ‚ÄòDesire‚Äô, Alexander is confidently striking out on his own. Fellow music theory geeks will recognise the chord progression here as a circle of fourths; think of Gloria Gaynor‚Äôs ‚ÄòI Will Survive‚Äô or more recently Miley Cyrus‚Äô ‚ÄòFlowers‚Äô [also Fly Me To The Moon, 50 Ways To Say Goodbye, You Never Give Me Your Money, It‚Äôs a Sin etc]. The main hook in the chorus is simple but catchy. The dotted melody consistently oscillates between major and minor thirds as it descends. The contrast of the melody against the rhythmically straight and strong bass beat helps us really lean into the title‚Äôs theme. Alexander‚Äôs lyrics sing of a hedonistic, all-consuming desire to go to a euphoric state of timeless ‚Äòdizziness‚Äô with his lover. There‚Äôs a nod to wedding church bells, albeit slightly tongue in cheek especially with the Eurovision-themed ‚Äúwill you take my hand‚Äù. The song has a rather rigid structure, and the lack of a rhythmic breakdown or harmonic ramp limits musical development; the energy stays at one level for the most part. Olly‚Äôs spoken-word bridge is reminiscent of Pet Shop Boys, providing some much-needed contrast with the verses, but lacks power. Harle‚Äôs production uses arpeggiators to provide the majority of the interest under the vocals. The success of this song will likely come down to the performance, Eurovision is as changeable as British weather, so let‚Äôs hope for a downpour of glitter and energy!\n\n81%\n\nDi-\n\n(Make me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy)\n\nThere‚Äôs a place where we break the line (make me-)\n\nMake it a circle redefined, mm (di-)\n\nBeautiful gardens, eternal flowers (make me di-)\n\nYou know the way, so take me there\n\nWon‚Äôt you make me dizzy from your kisses?\n\nWill you take my hand and spin me\n\n‚ÄòRound and ‚Äôround until the moment never ends?

Norwegian prog-folk-rock! Sung in Norwegian! I always admire an artist‚Äôs determination to be authentic, even at the expense of throwing away any opportunity of winning. This is the spirit of Eurovision ‚Äì a country sharing its art with European neighbours to celebrate musical and cultural diversity.\n\nThey‚Äôre even being (literally) neighbourly in the instrumentation, which is partly Swedish. That violin-like intro is played on a nyckelharpa, a mediaeval Swedish instrument of which I am very fond. There‚Äôs nothing quite like it in sound and approach; here‚Äôs games composer Kenny Young playing one in the soundtrack for the charming PSVR game Tethered.\n\nHere, the storytelling is dense and dark. Let me summarize, with the correct metatags;\n\n<reverb>\n\n<pitchshift -3>\n\n<vincentprice>\n\nIn a realm of sorcery and dark transformations, a young maiden‚Äôs tale unfolds tragically as her mother dies during childbirth. Cast under the shadow of an evil stepmother, the maiden is cursed to shift forms: first to a horse serving at the king‚Äôs estate, then to a small sword, wielded by many. Her plight deepens as she is transformed into a grey wolf, condemned to roam the forest with a dreadful burden‚Äîto seek redemption through a sinister deed involving her own brothers.\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, as nine maidens circle ominously, the maiden-wolf seizes her stepmother, tearing her from her mount and exacting a gruesome revenge, tearing out her heart. The curse is finally broken, though it binds her to the darkest of fates.\n\n</vincentprice>\n\n</pitchshift -3>\n\n</reverb>\n\nMusically, this is prog-folk with elements of electronica (G√•te have been around since 1999 and have released 5 EPs; they are much loved back at home). The lineup is guitar-bass-drums-voice-nyckelharpa, and the nyckelharpist (same word in Norwegian and English!) John Stenersen is busting all the same onstage rock power moves as the rest of the band ‚Äì kind of difficult while holding the bow. Vocalist Gunnhild is bringing all the magical aeolian melismas, with an almost-yodel tone on those lyricless choruses, and wonderful characterisation of our doomed heroine.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Eurovision bookies provide the opportunities for lay betting, because, sadly, you could make money on the dead-cert outcome that Ulveham will not win. But I loved this track, and kudos to the Norwegians for entering something interesting, artistic, fun, and authentic.\n\n90% (personal score)\n\n43% (likelihood of winning)\n\nNorwegian\n\nEg var meg s√• ven og fager ei m√∏y\n\nMed stimoder vond, mi moder ho d√∏y\n\nHo skapte meg om til eit sv√¶r og ei n√•l\n\nOg sende meg av ti kongens g√•rd\n\nOg vreida mi stimoder kjende mest\n\nN√•r alle dei gillaste lika meg best\n\nHo gav meg ein ham som ulve gr√•\n\nHo svor meg til einsam i skogjen g√•\n\nOg –∞ldri blir eg heil og god\n\nF√∏r eg f√¶r drukkje min broder—ï blod\n\nEnglish\n\nI was a young maiden\n\nMy mother on maternity bed dies\n\nMy stepmother turned me into a gray horse\n\nThen she sent me to the king‚Äôs estate\n\nThen she turned me into a small sword\n\nMy stepmother thought that it was the worst\n\nThat all the stately used me the most\n\n[Chorus: vocalisation only]\n\nShe then turned me into a grey wolf\n\nShe said I should walk the forest\n\nShe said I shouldn‚Äôt receive penance\n\nBefore I drank my brothers‚Äô blood\n\n[Chorus ‚Äì vocalisation only]\n\nNine maidens rode in a circle\n\nMy stepmother rode further in\n\nSo I grabbed her blue coat\n\nAnd tore her off her grey horse\n\nI then tore out her heart\n\nSo her blood flowed free\n\nThen I got to drink my brother‚Äôs blood\n\n[note ‚Äì it appears that the final verse has been cut to meet the 3-minute limit for the Final ‚Äì Norwegians correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

The Italians are clearly having none of this: the country of Puccini, Vivaldi and Rossini is always going to want to give orchestral players a gig. And so it was that in Italy‚Äôs national ‚ÄúFestival di Sanremo‚Äù ESC song selection final, Angelina sang this charming cumbia-disco pop track with a live band with a conductor and 20-piece string section.\n\nThe title means ‚Äúthe boredom‚Äù which maybe flies in the face of the energy of the performance and groove. And this protagonist does seem rather dissatisfied with their lot: in fact they seem annoyed that they don‚Äôt have much to be annoyed about: ‚ÄúI live without suffering / There‚Äôs no bigger cross [‚Ä¶] A crown of thorns will be the dress code for my party‚Äù. Angelina is clearly conjuring S√∏ren Kierkegaard‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom‚Äù here.\n\nThe verse chord loop is | Gm A | Dm | Gm A | Dm (D) |, and that occasional change to the D major is a lovely bit of extra harmonic camp.\n\nMost of the songs so far have a dynamic drop at about 2:05, taking us low enough to create an exciting ramp up the final choruses, and this is a really nice one. It sounds like a celesta playing those rippling arpeggios here and there, although that drop is taking ages ‚Äì how is she going to get to a loud last chorus in time for the 3 minute cutoff? And‚Ä¶ there it is. Once round a full band chorus, and a dead stop. Total!\n\nThis sort of song (cumbia-reggaeton-pop) hasn‚Äôt ever won Eurovision, but there‚Äôs a lot of it about in the upper-mid scorers usually (Israel, San Marino, Russia, Serbia in 2021, or Malta, Cyprus and Belarus in 2019). Angelina is a fantastic performer, with presence and attitude (and she‚Äôs a co-writer on La Noia).

this is a ramonda.\n\nIt is also known as the Serbian Phoenix Flower, and it is noted for its ability to ‚Äòrise from the dead‚Äô after cold winters. In Serbia it is a symbol of hope and renewal, and often associated with the WWI armistice day of 11 November 1918. There are many conflict remembrance flowers, including the poppy (UK, France, Belgium, Ukraine), cornflower (Germany), corn poppy (Poland), Easter lily (Ireland) and daisy (Italy).\n\nTeya has provided us with an anti-war song that can also be interpreted as any kind of rising-from-the-ashes message. It‚Äôs a simple Aeolian ballad, leaning heavily on Am and F changes, but the simplicity of the melody doesn‚Äôt jar on me at all; the only lyric in the chorus is ‚Äúlila ramonda‚Äù (lilac ramonda), and that‚Äôs all it needs.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt doubt the Serbs‚Äô ability to do well in their native language: they won in 2007, their first year they entered as an independent country, with Marija ≈†erifoviƒá‚Äôs Molitva, sung entirely in Serbian.\n\nThe orchestration follows the usual wedge-of-cheese ESC road map for big ballads ‚Äì poignant piano vocal opening, building instrument by instrument into strings, choir, drums and bass for the the belting final chorus, followed by an on-the-barline dynamic drop for the final 4 bars where we go back to piano/vocal, as the animated ramonda opens on the final beat. In terms of songwriting technique, this is a great example of the power of using a concrete noun hook to focus the lyric theme. I found it really affecting.\n\n88%\n\nSerbian Nemam nemam nemam ja\n\nNemam mira nemam sna\n\nNe da noƒá da doƒëe dan\n\nTe≈°ko onom ko je sam\n\nK‚Äôo pod vodom tiho je sve\n\nVri≈°tim al‚Äô se ne ƒçuje\n\nIza gora beli sjaj\n\nJa ne nazirem kraj\n\nOvo put je za ranjene\n\nA nema ko da vodi me\n\nDo svetle zvezde Danice\n\nGori svet, svaki cvet\n\nGde su nestale lila ramonde\n\nLila ramonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nRamonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nLila ramonda\n\nI nema ko da vodi me\n\nJer zvezde sve su zaspale\n\nNe poma≈æu ni molitve\n\nGde su nestale lila ramonde\n\nLila ramonda‚Ä¶\n\nLila ramonda‚Ä¶\n\nDi≈æe —ïe iz pepela\n\nJedna lila ramond–∞\n\nEnglish\n\nI don‚Äôt have, I don‚Äôt have, I don‚Äôt have\n\nNeither peace, nor sleep\n\nThe night frightens the day\n\nThe lonely ones suffer\n\nEverything is quiet just like under the water\n\nI scream, but the sound doesn‚Äôt come out\n\nThere is a white flare behind the mountain\n\nI cannot see the end of it\n\nThis is the road for wounded\n\nAnd there is no one to guide me\n\nTowards the bright North Star\n\nThe world is on fire, every flower too\n\nWhere have lilac ramondas disappeared to?\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nRamonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nLilac ramonda\n\nAnd there is no one to guide me\n\n‚ÄòCause all the stars fell asleep\n\nPrayers also don‚Äôt help\n\nWhere have lilac ramondas disappeared to?\n\nLilac ramonda‚Ä¶\n\nLilac ramonda‚Ä¶\n\nIt rises from ashe—ï\n\nOne lilac ramond–∞\n\n16 üá´üáÆ Finland ‚Ä¢ No Rules\n\nWindows95man ‚Ä¢ 160 ‚Ä¢ B minor\n\nSongwriters: Jaakko Sakari Salovaara / Henri Ilari Piispanen / Teemu Keisteri / Jussi-pekka Roine\n\nWindows95man states ‚ÄúI only live by one rule / And the rule is‚Ä¶ No rules‚Äù.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest does, in fact, have rules, and one of them is ‚Äúno contestant, delegation or country [may be] ridiculed in any manner‚Äù.

The simplistic but emotive style of ‚ÄòGrito‚Äô is a welcome respite from the sea of electro-pop and Eurodance this year. The song wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as great without the Iolanda‚Äôs beautiful vocals; for me, she has one of the more distinctive voices of all this year‚Äôs performers. This sort of stripped-back, melodically linear orchestral ballad rarely wins Eurovision, but it is possible the lineage will be recognized; anyone else getting flashbacks to Portugal‚Äôs 2017 winner ‚ÄúAmar Pelos Dois‚Äú? Like many of tonight‚Äôs songs, the lyrics could be interpreted related to mental health challenges; ‚ÄòGrito‚Äô translates to ‚Äòscream‚Äô, and Iolanda‚Äôs protagonist tries to find the strength to overcome hardship. She also performs a vocal belt towards the end of the song that resembles a literal scream. The arrangement builds from classical guitar, outlining the initial 12/8 arpeggios that drive the song‚Äôs rhythmic feel ‚Äì interestingly, the snare always appears on beat 3 (i.e. 7) of the 12/8 pulse, meaning that the rhythm never ‚Äòkicks off‚Äô and this is clearly intentional ‚Äì it paves the way for an incredibly downbeat ending. The concept of freedom and personal bravery is one that is generally quite successful in Eurovision, so it is very possible that the song will do well, even without the energy of Eurodance production.\n\n83%\n\nPortuguese\n\nOuvi, senti\n\nO corpo a carregar\n\nSeguimos assim\n\nUm e outro\n\nUm e outro\n\nUm e outro\n\nSou queda livre\n\nAviso quando l√° chegar\n\nEntrego-me aqui\n\nPouco a pouco\n\nPassos largos presa na partida\n\nQuero largar o que me deixou ferida\n\nPe√ßo √† estrela m√£e que fa√ßa o dia\n\nNascer de novo\n\nTransformei cada verso de mim\n\nE entregue √† coragem\n\nQue ainda arde\n\nAinda arde\n\nBate a luz no peito e abre\n\nSou chama que ainda arde\n\nAinda arde\n\nAinda arde\n\nHoje eu quero provar a mim mesma\n\nQue posso ser o que eu quiser\n\nJuntar quem me quer bem numa mesa\n\nPerdoar quem me quis ver sofrer\n\nA mim n√£o me enganam!

It is composed in the D Phrygian Dominant mode with an unusual chord sequence of D, Eb, D, Cm (D), not typically heard within mainstream Western music which sadly may not successfully translate in a commercial tone. The fast paced chorus melody is very catchy and it sounds as if singer Jaklin is dancing up and down the phrygian dominant scale. With both Thomas and Jaklin having trained at the Lille Conservatory in France, Jaklin‚Äôs ability to successfully execute such melodic passages live will be a testament to her talent. The use of sparse texture while she sings the main chorus hook consecutively followed by unison instrumentation is highly effective in invoking that celebratory tone; as if she is shouting ‚Äòall together now‚Äô! This also feels like a great opportunity for audience interaction. I worry that some may not realise the depth of the song‚Äôs meaning; a self-titled ode to her own freedom and empowerment ‚Äì Jako is a nickname for the Ladaniva‚Äôs lead singer Jaklin. The upbeat tone may not fully convey Jaklin‚Äôs criticism of female societal expectations and there is a danger of it being shrugged off as merely a party song. The recorder solo by French multi-instrumentalist Louis Thomas feels well placed among this year‚Äôs many folk instruments. A charismatic duo not to be overlooked, we will likely all be shouting ‚ÄòJako!‚Äô at our TVs after the first chorus.\n\n85%\n\nArmenian\n\n‘ªLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nHaaaa\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nIndz asoum en, Jako, kez khelok bahi (Jako!)\n\nShad mi khosa\n\nShad sous el mi nsdi\n\nHaki, patsi, pagi\n\nAghchga bes kez bahi\n\nYes aghchig em azad\n\nYes g‚Äôbarem, tou el nayi\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nAri, ari, ari, tou indz miatsi\n\nMega, mega, mega, ov inch gasi\n\nEli, eli, eli, zhamin chenk nayi\n\nHeli, heli, heli, boyit madagh\n\nVer gats, bari\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nHaha\n\nHaaaha\n\nHaaaha\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nEnglish\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nHaaaa\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nThey tell me, ‚ÄúJako, behave well (Jako!)\n\nDon‚Äôt talk too much\n\nDon‚Äôt sit too quietly\n\nWear this, open that, hide this\n\nBehave like a girl‚Äù\n\nBut I‚Äôm a free girl\n\nI will dance, and you will watch\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nCome on, come on, come on, join me\n\nNo matter what anyone says\n\nGet up, get up, get up, we won‚Äôt look at the time\n\nCome on, come on, come on, please\n\nGet up, dance\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nLa lai la lai la\n\nHaha\n\nHaaaha\n\nHaaaha\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la (Jako!)\n\nLa la lai lai lai la la la la\n\n19 üá®üáæ Cyprus | Silia Kapsis ‚Äì Liar\n\nSilia Kapsis ‚Ä¢ 100 ‚Ä¢ Bb minor\n\nMusic & lyrics: Dimitris Kontopoulos, Lyrics: Elke Tiel\n\n[Guest review by Maddy Plummer]\n\nThis comes across as an attempt at the normally successful trope of I-Will-Survive empowerment, but for me it falls flat. Cyprus have tried to evoke a sense of intrigue, power and impending justice with intermittent low stabs of brass instrumentation and lively electro-pop percussion, contrasting with the descending treble keyboard scale and ambience inducing synth tones, however this is not really achieved. For a song that is denouncing ‚Äòfakeness‚Äô, it lacks authenticity. The lyrics are very generic, and the monosyllabic style with note repetition in the verses comes across as almost clumsy; it is arguably more effective and emphatic when used sparingly in the choruses as a pivot point between the oscillating minor thirds (Bb and Db). The melismatic melody of ‚Äòyou‚Äô and ‚Äòthrough‚Äô in the pre-choruses are melodically more interesting, but this ingenuity is not really applied elsewhere. The saving grace is the wonderfully produced drum track that keeps us listening (and dancing). The bridge is musically anti-climatic, but does make space for a solid dance break, trading sonics for visuals. Unlikely to place highly.\n\n56%\n\nWaking up in the morning and I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm feeling like ooh-la-la\n\nIt‚Äôs about to go down ‚Äôcause I found out the truth, la-la\n\nNine o‚Äôclock in the morning and I know this is our last night\n\nI know what I‚Äôm doing ‚Äôcause, yeah, I got it on black and white\n\nShould‚Äôve known that you are a liar\n\nBut I looked the other way\n\nShould‚Äôve known you‚Äôre a trouble maker\n\nBut you act too nice to hate\n\nI knew we couldn‚Äôt get much higher\n\nBut you promised the world to me\n\nDo you see that you light my fire?\n\nNow I know what I know\n\nBecause of you\n\nI‚Äôll make it through\n\nTake a look at yourself ‚Äôcause that‚Äôs what you need to do, to do\n\n‚ÄòCause the only problem in this room is about you, about you\n\n‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre a liar\n\nLiar, liar, liar\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYou liar, liar, liar, liar\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nWaking up in the morning and I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm feeling like ooh-la-la\n\nNow I know that your heart and your mind don‚Äôt align, la-la\n\nI can see it in your eyes that you don‚Äôt like to be this way\n\nI know that you‚Äôre fighting back, guys like you can‚Äôt be changed\n\nShould‚Äôve known that you are a liar\n\nBut I looked the other way\n\nShould‚Äôve known you‚Äôre a trouble maker\n\nBut you act too nice to hate\n\nI knew we couldn‚Äôt get much higher\n\nBut you promised the world to me\n\nDo you see that you light my fire?\n\nNow I know what I know\n\nBecause of you\n\nI‚Äôll make it through\n\nTake a look at yourself ‚Äôcause that‚Äôs what you need to do, to do\n\n‚ÄòCause the only problem in this room is about you, about you\n\n‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre a liar\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nBecause of you\n\nI‚Äôll make it through\n\nTake a look at yourself ‚Äôcause that‚Äôs what you need to do, to do\n\n‚ÄòCause the only problem in this room is about you, about you\n\n‚ÄòCau—ïe you‚Äôre a li–∞r\n\n20üá®üá≠ ‚Ä¢ Switzerland ‚Ä¢ The Code\n\nNemo ‚Ä¢ 160 ‚Ä¢ F minor\n\nSongwriters: Benjamin Jon Alasu, Lasse Midtsian Nymann, Linda Dale, Nemo Mettler\n\nThis is Nemo‚Äôs song of self-expression and freedom. The lyric theme is the embrace of their nonbinary identity; the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù of the title is broken by our protagonist.\n\nAnd if the performance art video is anything to go by, an important part of that self expression is through the medium of‚Ä¶ hats. We see the train conductor‚Äôs cap, a pink fur number lifted from Jamiroquai, a charming bunny-ears balaclava, and an au naturel look leading up to ‚Äúthis story is my truth‚Äù. I‚Äôm pretty sure the ‚Äútru-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uth‚Äù 8th notes on that high C is a nod to Mozart‚Äôs Queen Of The Night Aria from The Magic Flute.\n\nThe chorus is more predictable Eurovision fare ‚Äì 16th hi-hats, a 3-note melody, and a nice pitch peak where Nemo shows us that there‚Äôs no tonal gap between their tenor and falsetto range. And ‚Äúparadise‚Äù pretty much rhymes with ‚Äúammonites‚Äù.\n\nThere‚Äôs an interesting post-chorus (breakdown section maybe) where they just ascend the Fm7 arpeggio over ‚ÄúSomewhere between the 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs‚Äù and then repeat the same melodic phrase over different chords, flipping between Dorian and Aeolian minor scales. And this takes us to the wonderful Bond-theme outro, in which the voice rises to the high G for the ‚Äúoooh-ooooh-oooh‚Äù (C-G-F-C). Arguably a quote from The World Is Not Enough ‚Äì 4 notes in common, same key, and same chord. 30 seconds of this, then it‚Äôs head down for the final 16-bar chorus. No time for a dynamic drop here, or a diva-friendly final orchestra chord. It just stops dead on after the title line with ‚Äúoh oh oh‚Äù. They really broke the code.\n\nThis song is, as my Gen-Z students might say, ‚Äúa lot‚Äù.

This is an interesting take on the folk-dance song ESC format; the 135BPM can be counted as half time, making it a powerful ballad, or as 4 to the bar, making it a faster-than-usual dance number. The former feel predominates, mainly because of the lack of an obvious snare backbeat, and this gives an unusual feeling to the listener, of a high BPM song that isn‚Äôt meant for the dancefloor. The melody is interesting ‚Äì I especially liked the harmonic minor interval leaps in ‚ÄúOgledalo sem brez robov‚Äù (‚ÄúI am just a frameless mirror‚Äù), which lifts it melodically out of the oh-so-predictable Aeolian mode and into something that sounds more authentically Slovenian (or so it seems to me).\n\nIt‚Äôs dramatic, dark, interesting and lyrically intriguing. The final lines step into the third person ‚ÄúJaz sem‚Ä¶ Ti si‚Ä¶ Veronika‚Ä¶ Tvojo resnico le ona ve‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am‚Ä¶ you are‚Ä¶ Veronika‚Ä¶ Only she knows your truth‚Äù. Veronika‚Äôs stage persona comes across as empowered and perhaps slightly intimidating, but if she is reading my mind right now, she already knows that I liked the song.\n\n79%\n\nSlovenian\n\nSkrila sem se v reko\n\nin od≈°la v tiho noƒç\n\nZ glasnimi koraki\n\nnemi klici na pomoƒç\n\nZdaj, ko sem le voda\n\nv valovih i≈°ƒçem mir\n\nUtopim se v sebi\n\nse svetlobi prepustim\n\nNajdi me, rani me, brani me\n\nKoga lovi≈°, ko me zapusti≈°?\n\nDvigni me, pusti me, ljubi me\n\nKdo te lovi, ko se me boji≈°?\n\nKoga se boji≈°\n\nko svoje ≈æelje zataji≈°?\n\nGleda≈° me v oƒçi\n\npodoba tebe v njih ≈æari\n\nOgledalo sem brez robov\n\nLe odsev tvojih sem strahov\n\nNajdi me, rani me, brani me\n\nKoga lovi≈°, ko me zapusti≈°?\n\nDvigni me, pusti me, ljubi me\n\nKdo te lovi, ko se me boji≈°?\n\nJaz sem\n\nTi si\n\nVeronika\n\nTvojo resnico le ona ve\n\nEnglish\n\nI hid in the river\n\nAnd went into the silent night\n\nWith loud steps\n\nVoiceless cries for help\n\nNow that I am just water\n\nIn the waves, I seek peace\n\nI drown in myself\n\nI surrender to the light\n\nFind me, wound me, protect me\n\nWho do you chase when you leave me?\n\nLift me up, let me go, love me\n\nWho hunts you when you fear me?\n\nWho are you afraid of\n\nwhen you deny your desires?\n\nYou look me in the eyes\n\nThe image of you shines in them\n\nI am a frameless mirror\n\nJust a reflection of your fears\n\nFind me, wound me, protect me\n\nWho do you chase when you leave me?\n\nLift me up, let me go, love me\n\nWho hunts you when you fear me?\n\nI am\n\nYou are\n\nVeronika\n\nOnly she knows your truth\n\n22 üá≠üá∑ ‚Ä¢ Croatia ‚Ä¢ Rim Tim Tagi Dim\n\nBaby Lasagna ‚Ä¢ 128 ‚Ä¢ E phrygian\n\nSongwriter (music and lyrics): Marko Puri≈°iƒá\n\nJust one chord for the whole first whole minute! It‚Äôs a novel but not-so-subtle bit of psychology ‚Äì to make the bassline, intro, title hook and verse vocal melody the same riff (EEEFED over ‚ÄúRim tim tagi digi‚Äù). I have loved this one since the moment I heard it, and so it seems has everyone in Europe. In this week‚Äôs radio show I was talking to the estimable Ewan Spence who Is one of the founders of ESC Insight, The Unofficial Eurovision podcast. He‚Äôs actually there in the room in Malm√∂ right now, and he told us that Croatia were a big hit with the crowd right from the first semi-final rehearsal.\n\nGot to love the DJ-meets-keyboard-player, who seems to be doing the same hand gesture on both instruments to no discernible musical effect ‚Äì this is one of those ‚Äúpress the spacebar and retire to a safe distance‚Äù programmed riffs. In case you‚Äôre wondering, ‚ÄúRim Tim Tagi Dim‚Äù is not in fact Croatian; it‚Äôs just one of those glorious Eurovision titles that doesn‚Äôt mean anything but is really fun to sing. See also ‚ÄúDiggi-Loo Diggi-Ley‚Äù Sweden 1984, ‚ÄúBoom Bang-a-Bang‚Äù United Kingdom 1969, ‚ÄúLa La La‚Äù Spain 1968, ‚ÄúDing-A-Dong‚Äù Netherlands 1975, ‚ÄúBana Bana‚Äù Turkey 1989, ‚ÄúA-Ba-Ni-Bi‚Äù Israel 1978, ‚ÄúTra La La‚Äù Germany 1962, ‚ÄúBim Bam Toi‚Äù France Junior Eurovision 2019, ‚ÄúRing-Dinge-Ding‚Äù Germany 1961, ‚ÄúBum Bum‚Äù Finland 1977, ‚ÄúLalala‚Äù Israel 1973 (yes, you really can ask ChatGPT anything).\n\nThe song is the classic story of a country boy leaving home to make his fortune in the big city. There is some social commentary about Croatia‚Äôs quite genuine population drain through emigration. Though to be fair Mr Lasagna (Marko to his friends) is having a lot of fun with it. I particularly like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big boy now / I‚Äôm going away and I sold my cow‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGonna miss you all but mostly the cat‚Äù (neatly mashing up Jack & The Beanstalk, Dick Whittington and ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Leaving Home‚Äù).\n\nThe chorus chord loop is more familiar Eurovision fare: Em C | Am D |, and then a big build on the V chord of B for yet another title hook. They‚Äôre throwing in a breakdown section at the 2 minute point. ESC rules mean you can‚Äôt go over 3 minutes, so they‚Äôve got just over 50 seconds now to get from this section into the inevitable chorus repeats to get us to the build. 8 bar breakdown, 9 bar 4-on-the-floor chorus, 9 bar loud chorus, and then 2 bars of riff. Phew. Made it!\n\nThis has it all ‚Äì silly, fun, easy to learn, big semi-rock chorus, and something interesting happening every 8 or 9 bars. I think it‚Äôs a winner. Probably the winner.\n\n94%\n\nAy, I‚Äôm a big boy now\n\nI‚Äôm ready to leave, ciao, mama, ciao\n\nAy, I‚Äôm a big boy now\n\nI‚Äôm going away and I sold my cow\n\nBefore I leave, I must confess\n\nI need a round of decompress\n\nOne more time for all the good times\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tim\n\nGonna miss you all but mostly the cat\n\nGonna miss my hay, gonna miss my bed\n\nMost of all, I‚Äôma miss the dance\n\nSo come on y‚Äôall, let us prance\n\nNow don‚Äôt call, don‚Äôt write\n\nI‚Äôm leavin‚Äô with the first light\n\nDon‚Äôt cry, but dance\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tim\n\nThere‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy presence fades to black\n\nYeah, there‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy anxiety attacks\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tagi digi\n\nI hope I find peace in the noise\n\nWanna become one of them city boys\n\nThey‚Äôre all so pretty and so advanced\n\nMaybe they also know our dance\n\nBye mom, bye dad\n\nMeow, cat, please meow back\n\nDon‚Äôt cry, just dance\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tim\n\nThere‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy presence fades to black\n\nYeah, there‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy anxiety attacks\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tagi digi\n\nThere‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy presence fades to black\n\nThere‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy anxiety attacks\n\nRim tim tagi digi dim tim tagi digi\n\nThere‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy presence fades to black\n\nYeah, there‚Äôs no going back\n\nMy anxiety attacks\n\n22 üá¨üá™ ‚Ä¢ Georgia ‚Ä¢ Firefighter\n\nNutsa Buzaladze ‚Ä¢ 116 ‚Ä¢ E minor\n\nSongwriters: Ada Satka and Darko Dimitrov\n\nIn my songwriting classes at Berklee, we sometimes talk about the three main lyric themes in popular music; they are: love songs (happy or sad), dancing songs, and songs of self-assertion. This is broadly true, statistically, across subgenres (although for Eurovision we had to nuance this back in 2020, to add Unity, Partying, and European History). Well, tonight Nutsa is bringing us a self-assertive danceable love song! Firefighter is an extended metaphor, albeit a slightly confused one. If there are ashes, the Firefighter‚Äô may no longer be necessary, or at least be on their way home after a successful day at work (‚Äúrunning through these ashes like a firefighter‚Äù). At the very least, the post-chorus‚Äôs exhortation to ‚Äúput out the fire‚Äù has already been achieved before the start of verse one.\n\nMusically, this is a lovely overlay of two much-loved Latin rhythmic ideas, the son clave rhythm, and the more recent Reggaeton pattern, which shares some of its heritage. For the verse ‚Äúput out the fire‚Äù we‚Äôre hearing the son clave with an occasional dry kick drum, then when the pre-chorus picks up ‚Äúthe ceiling is falling‚Äù it switches to the reggaeton feel. Then for the first chorus ‚ÄúI see it in the air‚Äù it‚Äôs 3 bars of four on the floor euro-beat kick drum, with the other parts gradually re-introduced, before the ‚Äúput out the fire‚Äù section.\n\nFor the bridge (IMO the best bit of the song), all three elements are combined, for a glorious excitement lift, leading to the inevitable and necessary drop to the bottom of the dynamic ramp for the climb. Not two but three choruses to end, with Nutsa delivering some last-minute vocal pyrotechnics, ending on the title hook. Fine, fine work!\n\n86%\n\nI see it in the air, I see it in the air\n\nI‚Äôm running through these ashes like a firefighter\n\nPut out the fire, put out the fire.\n\nDid we build empires just to watch them burn?\n\nMy heart‚Äôs beating louder, I‚Äôm running like tigers.\n\nNo fear in my eyes though.\n\nI will save this love.\n\nThe ceiling is falling, the windows are burning.\n\nIt‚Äôs getting harder to breathe.\n\nCan you hear me calling?\n\nI see ashes falling.\n\nI‚Äôm down on my knees.\n\nBut I will save this love.\n\nI see it in the air, I see it in the air.\n\nI‚Äôm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.\n\nYou know I‚Äôll be there.\n\nYou know that I‚Äôll be there.\n\nI‚Äôm running through these ashes like a firefighter.\n\nPut out the fire, put out the fire.\n\nPut out the fire, put out the fire.\n\nPut out the fire.\n\nCome dance with the thunder,\n\nCause love makes us stronger.\n\nWe‚Äôre not here forever.\n\nSo can we save this love?\n\nFrom lovers to fighters,\n\nOh, why do we do this?\n\nWe‚Äôre meant to rise higher and higher and higher.\n\nThe ceiling is falling, the windows are burning.\n\nIt‚Äôs getting harder to breathe.\n\nCan you hear me calling?\n\nI see ashes falling, falling, falling.\n\nI see it in the air, I see it in the air.\n\nI‚Äôm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.\n\nYou know that I‚Äôll be there.\n\nYou know that I‚Äôll be there.\n\nI‚Äôll be there, I‚Äôll be there.\n\nI see it in the air, I see it in the air.\n\nI‚Äôm rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.\n\nYou know I‚Äôll be there.\n\nYou know that I‚Äôll be there.\n\nWe‚Äôre running through these ashes like a firefighter.\n\nI see it in the air, I see it in the air.\n\nWe‚Äôre rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.\n\nYou know I‚Äôll be there.\n\nYou know that I‚Äôll be there.\n\nWe‚Äôre rising from these ashes like a phoenix, yeah.\n\n‚Äì\n\n25. üá´üá∑ ‚Ä¢ France ‚Ä¢ Mon amour\n\nSlimane ‚Ä¢ 142 ‚Ä¢ B minor\n\nSongwriters: Slimane Nebchi, Yaacov Salah and Me√Ør Salah\n\nWow! 199 words in 3 minutes! And all the more remarkable, considering the slow tempo. But come on, France, musically this is Lionel Richie‚Äôs Hello! Try it, and sing along. When Slimane sings the ‚ÄúJe‚Äù of ‚ÄúJe t‚Äôaime‚Äù at the top of the chorus, align his ‚ÄúJe‚Äù (it‚Äôs the same note) with Lionel‚Äôs ‚Äúcan‚Äù from ‚ÄúI can see it in your eyes‚Äù. You can sing the whole thing ‚Äì all 16 bars of each chorus ‚Äì and it even lines up the chords nicely when you get to ‚Äúor is someone loving you‚Äù. The similarity is nowhere near copyright infringement, of course (it‚Äôs just the circle of 4ths), but someone really should have had a word with that bass player.\n\nThis is the ballad version of the song. Good choice, Slimane ‚Äì I do prefer it to the Euro-beat version he also released (although that works pretty well too), and notwithstanding the embarrassment of Richie-ness, this is France doing something they do better than anyone else ‚Äì the chanson. No-one says ‚ÄúOh my love / Please come back to Paris / Do it for us, I am begging you‚Äù like a heartbroken French citizen. This is one of those toplines a great singer can really lean into ‚Äì the love and loss is sort of built into the progression and the always-falling melodic direction. And Slimane is selling it tonight. Great job, all round. France usually push back against the excesses of Euro-disco, and this is one of their best for a while.\n\n86%\n\nFrench\n\nMon amour\n\nDis-moi √† quoi tu penses\n\nSi tout √ßa a un sens\n\nD√©sol√© si je te d√©range\n\nMon amour\n\nTe souviens-tu de nous ?\n\nDu premier rendez-vous ?\n\nC‚Äô√©tait beau, c‚Äô√©tait fou\n\nJe t‚Äôaime\n\nJ‚Äôsais pas pourquoi\n\nJe rejoue la sc√®ne\n\nMais c‚Äôest toujours la m√™me fin qui recommence\n\nTu n‚Äôentends pas\n\nMa peine, on en fait quoi ?\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes ou pas ?\n\nMon amour\n\nJe ferai tout ce que je peux\n\nUn oc√©an dans le feu\n\nL‚Äôimpossible si tu le veux\n\nOh Mon amour\n\nAllez reviens √† Paris\n\nFais-le pour nous je t‚Äôen supplie\n\nJe le promets j‚Äôai compris\n\nJe t‚Äôaime\n\nJ‚Äôsais pas pourquoi\n\nJe rejoue la sc√®ne\n\nMais c‚Äôest toujours la m√™me fin qui recommence\n\nTu n‚Äôentends pas\n\nMa peine, on en fait quoi ?\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes ou pas ?\n\nDis-moi l‚Äôendroit, je t‚Äôattendrai\n\nEt si tu ne viens pas, je t‚Äôattendrai\n\nC‚Äôest b√™te je sais, je le ferai\n\nRempli d‚Äôespoir je t‚Äôattendrai\n\nJe t‚Äôaime\n\nJ‚Äôsais pas pourquoi\n\nJe rejoue la sc√®ne\n\nMais c‚Äôest toujours la m√™me fin qui recommence\n\nTu n‚Äôentends pas\n\nMa peine, on en fait quoi ?\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes ?\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes ?\n\nEst-ce que tu m‚Äôaimes ?\n\nOu p–∞—ï ?\n\nEnglish\n\nMy love\n\nTell me what‚Äôs on your mind\n\nIf all of this makes sense\n\nSorry if I disturb you\n\nMy love\n\nDo you remember us?\n\nOur first rendez-vous?\n\nIt was beautiful, it was insane\n\nI love you\n\nI don‚Äôt know why\n\nI replay the scene\n\nBut it‚Äôs always the same ending that keeps repeating\n\nYou don‚Äôt hear anything\n\nMy pain\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n\nDo you love me, or not?\n\nMy love\n\nI‚Äôll do all that I can\n\nCreate an ocean in the fire\n\nThe impossible if you want me to\n\nOh my love\n\nPlease come back to Paris\n\nDo it for us, I am begging you\n\nI promis–µ, I learned my lesson\n\nI lov–µ you\n\nI don‚Äôt know why\n\nI replay the scene\n\nBut it‚Äôs always the same ending that keeps repeating\n\nYou don‚Äôt hear anything\n\nMy pain\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n\nDo you love me, or not?\n\nTell me the place, I‚Äôll wait for you\n\nAnd if you don‚Äôt come, I‚Äôll wait for you\n\nI know it‚Äôs silly, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do\n\nFilled with hope, I‚Äôll wait for you\n\nI love you\n\nI don‚Äôt know why\n\nI replay the scene\n\nBut it‚Äôs always the same ending that keeps repeating\n\nYou don‚Äôt hear anything\n\nMy pain\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n\nDo you love me?\n\nDo you love me?\n\nDo you love me?\n\nDo you love me, or not?\n\n‚Äî\n\nüáÆüá±\n\n25 Austria ‚Ä¢ We Will Rave\n\nKaleen ‚Ä¢ 140 ‚Ä¢ Ab major\n\nSongwriters: Anderz Wrethov, Jimmy Th√∂rnfeldt, Julie Aagaard, and Thomas Stengaard\n\n[Guest review by Maddy Plummer]\n\nA solid mashup of contemporary production techniques and ‚Äô90s rave tropes, this is a strong contender for Eurodance club anthem status. In an energetic, electro-pop track reminiscent of Germany‚Äôs Cascada 2013 entry, Austria is extending an invitation to give ourselves over to the empowerment of dance. There are some subtle and not-so-subtle sonic nods to the rave years here ‚Äì the offbeat closed-hat from early techno, the heavy resonant filter sweeps in the bassline, and some snare parts towards the end that are straight out of the Prodigy‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlock Rockin‚Äô Beats‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmack My B***h Up‚Äù. Eurovision nonsense-speak is alive and well here ‚Äì ‚Äúram-di-dam-dam-dam‚Äù could have been a 1960s title. Kaleen‚Äôs contrast of whispery vocals on the ascending and descending scalic melodic lines heard in the verses, compared to the emphatic note repetition with stronger vocals in the choruses, is an effective songwriting and performance technique, evocative of many a noughties synth-pop anthem. Even if this doesn‚Äôt find its feet at Eurovision, I predict we‚Äôll see it on TikTok (in fact it‚Äôs already started). Kaleen has won more than 100 national and European dance championships, and the danceability of the song seems tailored to her strengths.\n\n66%\n\nIce running through my veins\n\nYou just did it again\n\nGo, ‚Äôcause I can‚Äôt be your friend\n\nI‚Äôm cold, but this is not the end\n\nSo I go, go, go\n\nWhere them broken-hearted go\n\nNo one knows a thing ‚Äôbout my heart and soul\n\nI go-o-o\n\nWanna dance it off alone\n\nI won‚Äôt let it show\n\nThey will never know\n\nWhen the darkness hits, and we can‚Äôt be saved\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\nWhen our hearts are burning, we feel no pain\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam (we will rave)\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam (we will rave)\n\n(We will rave)\n\n(Rave, rave ra-a-a-a-a)\n\nWe will rave\n\nSee only silhouettes\n\nI just wanna forget\n\nAbout everything we said\n\nAnd the demons in my head\n\nSo I go, go, go\n\nWhere them broken-hearted go\n\nNo one knows a thing ‚Äôbout my heart and soul\n\nI go-o-o\n\nWanna dance it off alone\n\nI won‚Äôt let it show\n\nThey will never know\n\nWhen the darkness hits, and we can‚Äôt be saved\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\nWhen our hearts are burning, we feel no pain\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam (we will rave)\n\nWe will rave\n\nWe will rave\n\nWe will rave\n\n(Rave, rave, rave)\n\nWe will rave\n\nWhen the darkness hits, and we can‚Äôt be saved (can‚Äôt be saved)\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\nWhen our hearts are burning, we feel no pain\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave (we will)\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave (we will)\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave (oh-ooh)\n\nWe ram-di-dam-dam-dam\n\nWe will rave\n\n‚Äî\n\n26 üá≥üá± ‚Ä¢ Netherlands ‚Ä¢ Europapa\n\nJoost Klein ‚Ä¢ 160 ‚Ä¢ B minor\n\n[JB comment: Joost was disqualified on the afternoon of the final, following a backstage incident. I have included my original review here, which was based on the pre-semifinal video.]\n\nSongwriters: Joost Klein, Maradonnie, Tim Haars, Dylan van Dael, Paul Elstak, Teun de Kruif, Thijmen Melissant\n\nMy musicology research colleague Maddy is an expert in sampling, and (this is absolutely true), when she first heard the low-mixed siren in the middle of Joost Klein‚Äôs rap section she said ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs good ‚Äì he‚Äôs using ‚Äú‚ÄòPulsar City Alarm‚Äô, from Adams & Fleisner‚Äôs 1984 album ‚ÄòDigital Effects ‚Äì fix your own mix: Space‚Äù. [Who listens to 80s sound effects records for fun? Only the best people].\n\nThis is a joyful and playful song of, and about, the European Union. Like the Croatian entry, it‚Äôs a celebration of the opportunities that crossing borders can bring. Joost lost his parents when he was very young, and Europapa is both an homage to his absent father, and a riff on how the Schengen area‚Äôs lack of travel restrictions can bring people together : ‚ÄúVisit my friends in France / Or take a long walk to Vienna / I want to leave the Netherlands / But my passport is gone / Fortunately I don‚Äôt need a visa to be with you‚Äù. This seems to me a beautifully bureaucratic way to deliver the common Eurovision trope of one-world unity between nations.\n\nIt‚Äôs a full-on 160BPM ‚Äì I think the fastest tempo so far ‚Äì and everyone is clearly having a lot of fun throughout, from the retro single-shot vocal sample retriggering, through to the chorus loop | Em | A | F#m | Bm | which is almost Never Gonna Give You Up (and a ton of other Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs). There‚Äôs a fine list of stereotypical national dishes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need es-car-gots, don‚Äôt need fish ‚Äòn chips / don‚Äôt need paella, no / I don‚Äôt even really know what that is‚Äù although it gets meta and obscure towards the end.‚ÄùTurn on the radio, I hear Stromae with Papaoutai‚Äù; this is a reference to the 2013 song which is written to sound like the French phrase ‚ÄúPapa, o√π t‚Äôes‚Äù (Dad, where are you)?\n\nEuropapa made me grin throughout; not only because of the canals and (yes) windmills in the video, but also because of its completely non-cynical message of love-thy-neighbour. Weirdly but honourably, Joost throws away any possibility of success in the voting with an incredibly downbeat but heartbreakingly poignant ending of a message to his father: ‚ÄúAt the end of the day / We are all human beings / My father told me once that the world has no borders / I miss you every day is what I whisper to myself / You see, d–∞d‚Ä¶ I did li—ïten to you‚Äù.\n\nNo, you have something in your eye.\n\n84%\n\nEurope, let‚Äôs come together\n\n(Euro-pa-pa, Euro-pa-pa)\n\nIt‚Äôs now "
