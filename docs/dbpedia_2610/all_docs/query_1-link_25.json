Except for the ending, which was absolutely perfect, and the music was pretty good also. The rest of it was just okay. I hopped into the drama not knowing anything about the manga/anime. When I read the description, I thought it was a gay girl who was in love with a straight girl and a gay boy who was in love with a straight boy who came together and wallowed in their despair that their love would never be returned.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAlso known as I’m Your Destiny, Boku, Unmei no Hito Desu is a drama about falling in love with your destined partner. I thought it was a really good drama. It was well put together, and I thought the concept was creative. While everyone was looking forward to Kamenashi Kazuya and Yamashita Tomohisa acting in a drama together again for the first time since Nobuta wo Produce, I didn’t think that their performance together were what made the show so good. Sure, their chemistry definitely contributed to it, but there was were so many other characters in the drama that made watching it a delight.\n\nRatings out of 10:\n\nActing: 7\n\nStoryline/plot: 8\n\nPlot Development: 10\n\nCharacters: 8\n\nMusic: 9\n\nEnding: 9\n\nI’m just going to give a few brief notes on why this drama is worth watching.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWow. This is one of the best dramas to come out of Taiwan in a long while. I watched every single episode and did not skip any scene, something I very rarely do with dramas. It could be because it was only 15 episodes, but 15 episodes was perfect. Any longer and it would have fallen prey to the reason so many other Taiwanese dramas fail: they’re just too long. I was initially interested in this drama because it paired one of my favorite TW actresses, Nikki Hsieh, with one of my favorite TW actors, Lego Li. Little did I know that this pairing would turn out to be so amazing! Before this drama, I thought Nikki Hsieh and Lego Li were good actors only sometimes. Now, I know that they really do have acting chops, and when put together, they excel at their jobs.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Unlike what the description of this drama would have you believe, Love @ Seventeen is NOT a “Second Chance” drama. Ai Li Si NEVER goes back in time to her high school days to change things. And before that makes you not want to watch the drama, I promise that the drama is only better for it.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nRatings out of 10:\n\nActing: 4.5\n\nStoryline/plot: 6\n\nPlot Development: 4\n\nCharacters: 5\n\nMusic: 5\n\nEnding: 7\n\nDandelion Love was 40 episodes long, but it definitely could have been only 30. The last ten episodes really dragged. Overall, the acting in the drama is not very good. I love me some Danson Tang, but he didn’t do a good job in this drama, and don’t even get me started on Alice Tseng. Both her acting and her character were irritating. The two best actors, who played the two most interesting characters, were Lene Lai and Nylon Chen. I thought they played their roles very well, even if it took Nylon a few episodes to truly become comfortable playing someone who couldn’t speak. Oh, and side note: these two are married in real life!! I also thought the main character’s father (Weng Jia Ming) did a good job.\n\nThe plot of the drama was a simple love story/slice of life. The way the plot developed in many parts, especially the way Lena Lai’s character developed, was sloppy. SPOILERS: When I didn’t even feel sad that one of the main characters had died, I knew there was something wrong. That being said, I still watched the whole thing, and it certainly wasn’t torture. The first seven or so episodes with the kids were entertaining, and the love stories were sweet as well.\n\nWatch If: You’re a fan of Danson Tang (he was the reason I started watching), Lene Lai, or Nylon Chen. Also, if you like longer dramas that take you beyond marriage and happily-ever-after, then this might be a drama you’ll enjoy.\n\nDon’t Watch If: You want an emotional drama that really makes you connect with the characters. Also, if you struggle watching dramas over 20 episodes, then I wouldn’t suggest this drama for you.\n\nOverall Score: 5.25\n\nRewatchability: 0%\n\nRatings out of 10:\n\nActing: 7\n\nStoryline/plot: 7\n\nPlot Development: 7\n\nCharacters: 7\n\nMusic: 6.5\n\nEnding: 10\n\nAh, this drama was so romantic! I loved that this was one of the only historical fiction dramas I’ve seen that almost solely focused on the romance. Of course, there was some political intrigue in the drama, but the relationship between the two leads was the main plot through the whole drama. Although I do not think it is one of the best historical dramas by any means, I did still thoroughly enjoy it. I couldn’t wait to watch the next episode, and I only skipped one or two scenes in the whole of 54 episodes!\n\nThe acting was pretty good, although I thought Vanness Wu was a bit awkward in his role as a villain (his hair was fabulous, though). The plot was engaging, but there were way too many times that Weiyoung got framed. Finally, around episode 30 or 40, the directors/writers finally got a clue to move on from the “framing Weiyoung” part of the plot. The ending was bittersweet, but it was perfect. And if not for the unresolved plot-points in the end, my score for the drama would have been higher.\n\nOh! And I will say there is one plot point in this drama that was perfection. I cringe even thinking about what happened, and it was really hard to watch some of the episodes because of what happened to Weiyoung, but after that plot point is finally resolved, you look back and realize how well it was actually executed.\n\nIf you’re a fan of historical dramas, pretty people, revenge, and, most importantly, ROMANCE, then I would highly recommend you to watch this drama.\n\nIf you like watching historical dramas because of politics or revenge or, well, history, then I wouldn’t watch this drama if I were you (it was based on a fictional book, you know).\n\nFRIENDLY ADVICE: Always skip the opening and ending of each episode because if you don’t, they will spoil the drama for you.\n\nOverall Score: 7.4\n\nRewatchability: 95%"
