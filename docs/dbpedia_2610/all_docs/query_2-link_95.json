She is the 2017 recipient of the prestigious Bra D’Or Award, a national award annually presented by the Playwrights Guild of Canada, in recognition of her years of championing works by women.\n\nFor Ruby Slippers Theatre, Diane has commissioned many English language translations of the best in contemporary French Canadian plays. She has proceeded to also produce and direct their award-winning English language premieres in Vancouver. Her affinity for the best in the French Canadian canon in English translation has resulted in critically heralded productions that include Down Dangerous Passes Road by Michel Marc Bouchard, translated by Linda Gaboriau, The Winners by Francois Archambault, translated by Shelley Tepperman, Life Savers by Serge Boucher, translated by Shelley Tepperman, The Leisure Society by François Archambault, translated by Bobby Theodore, and most recently You Will Remember Me by François Archambault. Her English language Vancouver premiere production of You Will Remember Me has since been picked up, and was showcased to great critical acclaim as part of The Gateway Theatre’s mainstage 2016/17 Season. In 2015 she commissioned the English language translation for After Me by Christian Bégin, translated by Leanna Brodie, and produced / directed the premiere. This resulted in five Jessie Award nominations including Outstanding Direction and Outstanding Production. That same year she was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for The Duchess a.k.a. Wallis Simpson.\n\nDiane has also freelanced across Canada and the United States. This work included four seasons with The Actors Shakespeare Company in upstate New York as an actor and a director, and work with The Sacramento Theatre Company. Diane co-created several interdisciplinary performance works that she then directed which were showcased abroad and at the Canada Dance Festival in Ottawa.\n\nOther directorial highlights include award winning productions of The Waiting Roomby Lisa Loomer (Canadian Premiere), The Cat Who Ate Her Husband by Drew McCreadie (World Premiere), Trout Stanley by Claudia Dey (Vancouver Premiere) andHotel Bethlehem by Drew McCreadie. Her production of Hotel Bethlehem has since been picked up three times by other companies. Ruby Slippers Theatre’s landmark production of Daniel MacIvor’s A Beautiful View saw four remounts in four years, including five weeks at The Centaur Theatre in Montreal and a showcase at The Goldcorps Centre for the Arts Fei and Milton Wong Experimental Theatre in downtown Vancouver. Ruby Slippers’ equally successful production of Communion by Daniel MacIvor was produced in association with Pacific Theatre.\n\nDiane also spearheaded one of Ruby Slippers Theatre’s most powerful programs, Advance Theatre : New Works by Diverse Women. This annual week-long festival of dramatic readings features new works by diverse Canadian women, directed by diverse Canadian women. This initiative is in direct response to the appalling fact that over two thirds of the plays on Canada’s mainstages are written and directed by men. Advance Theatre offers profile to diverse women playwrights and directors and has resulted in some of the plays receiving fully realized, professional mainstage productions.\n\nDiane and Ruby Slippers Theatre have created seven full-length new Canadian works, and toured nationally three times. She and RST have earned the reputation for being Vancouver’s premiere producers of French Canadian plays in English translation, and perveyor’s of smart social satire that is infectiously entertaining. The company has garnered 40 nominations and 16 professional theatre awards in the last 10 years alone.\n\nDiane is very active in the Vancouver cultural community. She leads Theatre Cares Vancouver, a volunteer organization that raises funds and awareness for people living with HIV/aids, is a member of Studio 58’s Theatre Advisory Committee, the Professional Association of Canadian Theatre’s national Advocacy Committee, was a founding member and Past President of the See 7 Performing Arts Society, spent five years on the steering committee for the Theatre Engagement Project, and is involved with several environmental and social justice initiatives.\n\nDiane is a graduate of Simon Fraser University, and holds a Masters Degree in Theatre from the University of British Columbia. She lives with her husband and son in Vancouver.\n\nhttp://www.rubyslippers.ca/diane-brown-biography\n\nLaurann Brown\n\nBA Theatre, 2006\n\nMA Voice Studies – Central School of Speech & Drama (London, UK) 2008\n\nemail: laurann.brown@googlemail.com\n\nNiki Brown\n\nBFA Acting, 2005\n\nemail: niki_b83@yahoo.ca\n\nRuth Brown\n\nBFA Acting, 2005\n\nemail: n/a\n\nSasa Brown\n\nBFA Acting, 2004\n\nemail: sasabrown@hotmail.com\n\nAndrea Burgoyne\n\nBA Theatre, 2006\n\nemail: andrea.burgoyne@gmail.cm\n\nCynthia Burtinshaw\n\nStage Management and Design, 1997\n\nemail: water@axion.net\n\nKate Butler\n\nBA, 2006\n\nemail: kate.a.butler@gmail.com\n\nKathryn Burvill (Daniels)\n\nBA Theatre, 1974\n\nBecame professional in 1974.

At one point, he was acting in the Setkani Festival in Brno, Czech Republic. At another point, he was producing and performing in his own show as part of the White Nights Festival in Beijing. And then he was in Nelson, BC, working on a piece based on the life and gags of Sir Charles Chaplin. In 2015, along with several other UBC grads, he formed Spec Theatre, a collective focused on creating, collaborating on, facilitating, and instigating original theatrical pieces that represent and empower the plethora of voices and ideas in various, unique communities. Their first show, Sid, written by ira, was a one woman show about the DTES and Disassociative Identity Disorder. In 2019 and 2020, Spec Theatre’s Artisanal Intelligence, written by ira and collaborated on by several UBC theatre grads (Samuel Jing, Hannah Everett, and Drew Carlson) and several non-UBC folk, travelled the Fringe circuit near and far (PEI, Regina, Edmonton, and New York) to stark-raving reviews. Next up, AI will be, fingers crossed, performed at the Havana Theatre as part of the Vancouver International Fringe Festival 2020. Currently, Spec Theatre, having just become a non-profit, is focusing on restructuring its system of governance, building it off the concepts of inclusion, diversity, and decolonization, and embedding long-standing, actionable, and authentic practices in its core. Creatives are invited, particularly those who are underrepresented in the arts, to build real, mutual, supportive relationships with Spec, in hopes for reconciliation, collaboration, and empowerment.\n\nEnough with the third person - let’s talk, let’s discuss, let’s make joy, let’s make art, let’s tell truths, let’s put up shows in new spaces with new rules, let’s be spontaneous and scripted and awkward and new.
