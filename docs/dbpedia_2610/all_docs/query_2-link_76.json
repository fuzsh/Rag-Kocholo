        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe use of wearable sensor technology opens up exciting avenues for both art and HCI research, providing new ways to explore the invisible link between audience and performer. To be effective, such work requires close collaboration between performers and researchers. In this article, we report on the co-design process and research insights from our work integrating physiological sensing and live performance. We explore the connection between the audience’s physiological data and their experience during the performance, analyzing a multi-modal dataset collected from 98 audience members. We identify notable moments based on HRV and EDA, and show how the audience’s physiological responses can be linked to the choreography. The longitudinal changes in HRV features suggest a strong connection to the choreographer’s intended narrative arc, while EDA features appear to correspond with short-term audience responses to dramatic moments. We discuss the physiological phenomena and implications for designing feedback systems and interdisciplinary collaborations.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nSolange Akselrod, David Gordon, Jeffrey B.
