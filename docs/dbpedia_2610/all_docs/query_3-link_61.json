        "text": "Abstract\n\nSystems aimed at stress awareness and reflection training by those in high-stress work environments may aid the development of stress management skills to alleviate and manage future workplace traumas. However, there is a notable gap in research addressing the insights and awareness individuals gain about their stress when they engage in team-based reflection on team-based data. To this end, we designed the Stress Reflection system as a proof-of-concept educational tool to foster and promote stress reflection and awareness by presenting trainees with both internal and external behavioral information, i.e., electrodermal activity (EDA) and corresponding situated simulation videos. We conducted a study within paramedic simulation training to qualitatively assess the insights gained and the depth of reflection achieved by trainees while interacting with each other and their data. Our findings revealed that reflecting together facilitated valuable insights into the emotions, self-expression, and behaviors that manifest during periods of stress. Trainees interacting collaboratively demonstrated emotional intelligence, predominantly engaging in higher-level dialogic reflections. Nonetheless, similar to other studies, transformative and critical reflection was largely absent. We conclude by discussing the primary findings and recommendations for expanding reflective frameworks to assess reflection in collaborative settings. This research contributes to the HCI community by offering empirically supported insights into team-based stress reflection in work and its implications for stress management in high-stress work environments.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nPhil Adams, Mashfiqui Rabbi, Tauhidur Rahman, Mark Matthews, Amy Voida, Geri Gay, Tanzeem Choudhury, and Stephen Voida. 2014.

However, especially collaborative ...\n\nInforming Design for Reflection: an Overview of Current Everyday Practices\n\nNordiCHI '16: Proceedings of the 9th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction\n\nThere is an increasing interest in HCI in designing to support reflection in users. In this paper, we specifically focus on everyday life reflection, covering and connecting a broad range of topics from someone's life rather than focusing on a very ...\n\nThe Technology-Mediated Reflection Model: Barriers and Assistance in Data-Driven Reflection\n\nCHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems\n\nCurrent personal informatics models consider reflection as an important stage in users’ journeys with trackers. However, these models describe reflection from a meta perspective and it remains unclear what this stage entails. To design interactive ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\nCopyright © 2024 Owner/Author.\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
