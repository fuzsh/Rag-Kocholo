        "text": "(Raslene)\n\nCity:Jakarta\n\nLAI Alumni:SEAD Fellow\n\nMCH Networks:Meeting Point 2022\n\nAffiliations:Synchronizing Asian Contemporary Moving Image Art\n\nBio: Raslene is a part-time video and visual artist based in Jakarta. She joined her first group exhibition in Jakarta 32ºC 2012, a visual exhibition and networking forum for college students. After graduating from School of Design, she gradually restarted her artistic activities in 2015. Her works were featured in several media arts festivals which were also presented in Gwangju and Berlin. Her practice deals with found footage and archives, re-questioning and engaging the historical and contemporary moving image-making, individually or through a collaboration. She also works on research: Social, cultural, political or sustainability concerns such as lost archives issues attract her interest. In 2019, she and her friends initiated a writing blog, Synchronizing Asian Contemporary Moving Image Art. Currently, she’s exploring cultural leadership and management in order to grow a sustainable working culture in her environment.\n\nInformation on this page is provided by the person whose name is on each profile.
