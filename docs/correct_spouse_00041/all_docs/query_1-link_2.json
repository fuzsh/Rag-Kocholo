        "text": "You might know him as the man you can't take your eyes off of, or the Indian supermodel who has donned many hats and won many hearts over the decades. Milind Soman is definitely all that, and more.\n\nBorn on November 4, 1965 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK (yes, he's Made in India, but not born here), Milind Usha Soman comes from a family of academicians. While everybody knows that he shot to fame with Alisha Chinai's music video in 1995, Milind was already making waves through a successful modelling career. He's acted in movies, been a swimming champion, and is known to be quite the fitness freak and promoter these days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Milind Soman's journey to the Everest, in pictures\n\nBut the one aspect of his life that has been full of ups and downs, like everybody else's, is his personal life. There have been a number of women in his life, some rumoured and some confirmed to be his girlfriends at some point of time or the other. So, take a trip down memory lane, and let's look at some of his past relationships.\n\nAnkita Konwar\n\nRight now, Milind is dating 23-year-old Ankita Konwar. The young lady from Assam is an air hostess, and has been spotted at a number of events with him. He frequently posts pictures of the both of them together, and anybody who follows Milind on social media can confirm that the couple look happy together, even if their age gap has been criticised by some.\n\nMadhu Sapre\n\nMilind's first (publicly acknowledged) relationship was with Madhu Sapre. The model from Maharashtra came close to winning the Miss Universe pageant in 1992 (she was crowned the second runner-up), and came back to India to launch into a successful modelling career. Milind and Madhu's relationship was a landmark in the '90s, especially since they revealed that they lived together in Mumbai.\n\nThe couple worked magic on the runway, making them the most adored model couple in India. And who doesn't remember the controversial ad campaign that featured them both twined together in the buff, with just shoes on? The couple split in 1995, sending shockwaves in the fashion industry.\n\nMylene Jampanoi\n\nNot many might know this, but Milind was once married (and not too long ago at that). He met Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, on the sets of their 2006 film, Valley of Flowers. The couple married in July 2006 at a tourist resort in Goa. Milind and Mylene decided to part ways in 2008, after their relationship became difficult due to their distance of workplaces. The couple divorced in 2009.\n\nAlso Read: While you were being lazy, Milind Soman covered 517 km barefoot\n\nShahana Goswami\n\nFrom featuring together on a magazine cover to attending events, Milind and Shahana caught the limelight since 2010. The 21-year gap between their ages was criticised, but the couple was not daunted by any of it. This was Milind's first confirmed relationship after Mylene. The couple split after four years of togetherness, in 2013.\n\nDipannita Sharma\n\nMilind was rumoured to be dating his co-star from two movies, Dipannita Sharma throughout the 2000s. The couple starred in 16 December (2002) and Jodi Breakers (2012), and were rumoured to be in a relationship since 2002. Their on-screen chemistry in 16 December fuelled these reports. A TOI report reveals that they also shared a flat in Mumbai, with Bipasha Basu, during this period.\n\nGul Panag\n\nIt was speculated back in 2005 that Milind was dating Gul Panag, after they starred in a film called Jurm in 2005. Milind himself denied the relationship during an interview with TOI in 2005. \"Gul and I have a professional relationship. That's all,\" he said back then. Milind and Gul have since shared many platforms together, including breast cancer awareness campaigns, but the rumour that they were dating have died down considerably."
