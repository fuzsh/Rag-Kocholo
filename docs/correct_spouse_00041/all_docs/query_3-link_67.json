        "text": "When we consider some of the various barbaric practices that were commonplace in the lives of our ancestors, we tend to look at them with a judgmental eye – thinking of them as uncivilized, and downright savage. Most of us would even admit to wondering if our violent predecessors, like those who relished the bloody gladiator games or those who condoned cruel medieval torture chambers, were actually less evolved than those alive today.\n\nBut has humankind really progressed that much, or are we just as bloodthirsty and ruthless as ever? If you’re under the impression that we are somehow more enlightened, you might be surprised by some of the ancient, barbaric practices that still exist throughout the world.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nContinued. Beginning – Whipping As A Punishment – Part One.\n\nEighteenth century Danish and Dutch inhabitants had no doubt what awaited if they transgressed, the whipping posts prominent in Dutch gaols. In the Netherlands also, the torture of the whip was applied by children so they could learn to become executioners themselves some day. In Denmark those guilty of infanticide were imprisoned for life and whipped annually on the anniversary of and at the place where they had committed the murder. Most Danish towns had a whipping post surmounted by a figure of a man, a whip in his right hand, a sword slung at his waist. Germany’s early Teutonic whip consisted of a short wooden handle from which protruded iron cords, each with a spiked circle at its end. The more conventional whip was also used on perjurers, husbands and wives for infidelity, bigamy and polygamy despite the fact there being no marriage ceremony or vow-taking as such, the authorities frowned on a partner who reneged on the verbal contract and took others into matrimony. Thieves, swindlers, adulterers and witches received neither mercy or lessons in social adjustment. Town councils didn’t waste ratepayer’s money on imprisoning them but simply ordered the executioner to use the whip to escort them to the city limits.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSo easy was a whipping to administer, and so obvious the deterrent it was thought to be, it became the punishment most common throughout the world. On 1530 the Whipping Act ordered delinquents ‘to be tied to the end of a cart, naked, and beaten with whips through a market town till the body be bloody by reason of such whipping’. It was not until the reign of Elizabeth I, in 1597, that culprits were only required to be naked from the waist up. From that time also, the whipping post came into being, for the majority of cases, instead the back of a moving cart. Doubtful the victim benefited other than a stationary target was easier to hit than a moving one.\n\nThis punishment was not just for those who committed a crime. Mothers of illegitimate children were punished in this way in the 16th century as were the reputed fathers. Deranged people were whipped for being deranged, ill people for being ill. Blasphemers and drunkards were also constant targets usually with a Whip of Nine Knotted Cords.\n\nMary Hamilton, alias George Hamilton, alias William Hamilton, who in the guise of a man, married no fewer than fourteen women. Her last wife totally unsuspected until she ‘compared certain circumstances’ with her neighbours Mr and Mrs Goody, then realised her spouse had indulged in ‘vile and deceitful practices. The sentence of the court was a follows: ‘That he, she, prisoner at the bar, is a uncommon notorious cheat; and we, the Court, do sentence her or him, whichever he or she may be, to be imprisoned for six months, and during that time to be whipped in the towns of Taunton, Glastonbury, Wells and Shipton Mallet, and to find security for good behaviour as long as they, the learned judges aforesaid, shall or may, in their wisdom and judgment require.’ Accordingly Mary Hamilton was imprisoned and whipped in the bitterly cold winter of 1746.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSadism is pleasure in the infliction of pain or humiliation upon another person. This term describes consensual practices, often sexual, but not necessarily so, within the BDSM community. Sadist is one who is aroused, excited, or receives sexual gratification from inflicting pain on another. A sadist does not necessarily take pleasure in inflicting pain indiscriminately; for most sadists, the pleasure relies on knowing that the subject is also enjoying the experience. But these terms may be also used clinically, in psychotherapy, to describe mental illnesses, psychopathology or counterproductive coping mechanisms. Sadism is not necessarily associated with criminality or murder. The term sadist is thrown around very easily, the word itself may send signals, may attract and is quite often used to paint a picture that fits the world of fantasy. A seal, if you like, of quality play to come for some. Forbidden fruit always tastes the best. Some may visualise themselves as sadists but that may not necessarily be the case. They may just be extreme in some areas. Have a particular bent that is somewhat darker. Dread… political correctness, is there are some that fit the definition of a sadist however display the controls within themselves to play safely. There are some that don’t.\n\nThe word “sadism” was derived from the name of Donatien Alphonse Francois, better known as the Marquis de Sade, a French author who lived from 1740 to 1814, famous for his works of sexual arousal driven by physical suffering. He was imprisoned without trial as an “administrative punishment”, for fear of scandal, after the publishing of “Justine”, and “Juliette”. Later declared insane he was transferred to Charenton Asylum where in 1814 he died of ill health aged 74. De Sade spent 27 years of his adult life in prisons, dungeons, and asylums throughout France for reasons that included “excesses committed in a brothel”, kidnapping and sexual assault, poisoning, and homosexual sodomy. The German psychologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing in 1898 gave sadism the professional definition: a sexual perversion with strong impulses to coitus, coupled with prepatory acts of maltreatment, even murder (necrophilia, then called “lustmurder”) which occurs primarily because of an inability to be satisfied with coitus.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nToday, 2 June 2010, is the 270th anniversary of Marquis de Sade birth. The French writer of psychological and philosophical works Donatien Alphonse François, Comte de Sade (1740-1814), was a libertine, debaucher, pornographer, and famous sadist. Recently, new interpretations of his life and writings have begun to appear. It is now generally agreed that despite his reputation, his works, which were ignored for over a century, must be considered as of the first rank. Sade has been termed the “most absolute writer who has ever lived.”\n\nContrary to diffused opinion he didn’t “invent” sadism – it existed before that – but he did lend his name to the practice of deriving sexual pleasure from inflicting pain.\n\nVery little is known of Sade’s life. Donatien Alphonse François de Sade was born on June 2, 1740, in Paris into an aristocratic family. He was the only surviving child of Jean-Baptiste de Sade and his wife Marie-Eléonore de Maillé, a distant cousin of the Prince de Conde. His family had been ennobled in the 12th century and remained a major power-broker in the southern region of Provence.\n\nHe grew up on various country estates, including an ancient castle with a dank, miserable dungeon, which no doubt played a factor in his developing psyche. Aged four, de Sade was sent to Avignon into the care of his uncle, Abbe de Sade, whose sexual life was notoriously irregular. After this period de Sade attended the Jesuit college of Louis Le Grand. Unlike the current Catholic school setup, in which youngsters are subjected to mostly mental abuse and surreptitious molestation, the Jesuits of the day included public whippings as part of the daily routine.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nA martyr is a person who is put to death or endures suffering because of a belief, principle, or cause. The themes of torture, sadism and captivity have been touched on by many horror films of the 2000s. “Martyrs” is the first film that could be called “torture porn” that doesn’t come from a conflicted moral point of view. On the surface, the film looks a lot like “Hostel” or “Saw”. Beneath the skin, though, it has much more in common with “Funny Games” or “Irreversible”, films where graphic violence isn’t just a series of vicarious thrills that are the entire reason for the film’s existence. “Martyrs” tells a story in a grotesque, mysterious way while hinting at possible religious motifs throughout. Not for the faint of heart this film starts off with scenes of female torture and really stays in an apologetically dark tone during the show. Progressing to more strange territory in the later half of the film viewers will need to prepare for director Pascal Laugier’s shock and awe visual assault that will surprise the senses. For those sadists and masochists who appreciate pure horror and intelligent moviemaking, “Martyrs” is a real find.\n\n“Martyrs” is a French film. The French can make very strong horror movies. If the audience is open-minded and strong-willed enough to go along with “Martyrs”, they’ll find a movie that is possibly the best of the recent spate of high quality horror films coming out of France. The film is written and directed by Pascal Laugier. “Martyrs” stars Morjana Alaoui as Anna and Mylene Jampanoi as Lucie with support given by Catherine Begin as Mademoiselle, Robert Toupin as Le pere, and Isabelle Chasse as La Creature.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSado Slaves is good, honest and serious sadism site.

German fans under 18 of home grown hard rock group Rammstein had until midnight on Tuesday to buy their latest album. This album can no longer be “publicly displayed” in German shops. The German Federal Office for the Examination of Media Harmful to Young People in Bonn has banned the album because of its depictions of sadism and masochism. Officials were offended by the song “Ich tue Dir Weh” (“I Want to Hurt You”), which includes such lines in German like “Bites, kicks, heavy blows, nails, pincers, blunt saws – Tell me what you want” and such phrases as “Barbed wire in the urethral tract” and “Needle, pliers, blunt saw. Make a wish, I won’t say no”. The chorus runs: “Ich tu’ dir weh. Tut mir nicht Leid! Das tut dir gut. Hohr wie es schreit!” (“I Am Going To Hurt You”, I’m not sorry! It does you good, Hear the screams!”).\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAn Iron Maiden, German Eiserne Jungfrau, otherwise known as the Virgin of Nuremberg – one of the most well-known torture devices and one of the more bloodthirsty torture devices ever invented. A cabinet built with wood or iron, and usually has a small closable opening so that the torturer can interrogate their victim and torture or kill a person.\n\nThe iron maiden tortures the body with sharp objects such as knives, spikes or nails. These spikes impaled the victim in the eyes, the chest and the back, different parts of the body, but usually missed vital organs, so as to leave the victim bleeding profusely and in great pain, but still alive for a period of time. The person inside was forced to remain standing in one position, ultimately causing their demise. The victim is weakened slowly and dies of a combination of shock and blood loss, if not asphyxiation. Most victims ended up dying as a result of the torture as a liberal amount of blood often gushed out of their bodies after some time. However, this technique was not used primarily for executions. It is entirely possible that a subject would call out after having spent some time within the iron maiden for relief. This torture device combines physical pain and psychological trauma – all alone in a small space with sharp spikes threatening to kill you from every side.\n\nContinue reading →"
