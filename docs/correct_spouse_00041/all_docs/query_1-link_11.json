        "text": "Milind Soman is all set to tie the knot with Ankita Konwar, at Alibaug, Mumbai.\n\nFor long, Milind has been heavily trolled on social media for dating a woman half his age. People may have called him out for the massive age gap with his girlfriend, Ankita, but that couldn't affect their burgeoning romance.\n\nAnkita is surely not Milind's first love interest ever. In fact, Milind's marriage with her would be his second after having divorced Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, in 2009.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere have been a number of women in Milind's life, some rumoured and some confirmed to be his girlfriends at some point of time or the other. So, let's take a trip down memory lane, and look at some of his past relationships.\n\nMadhu Sapre\n\nMilind's first (publicly acknowledged) relationship was with Madhu Sapre. The model from Maharashtra came close to winning the Miss Universe pageant in 1992 (she was crowned the second runner-up), and came back to India to launch into a successful modelling career. Milind and Madhu's relationship was a landmark in the '90s, especially since they revealed that they lived together in Mumbai.\n\nAlso Read: Milind Soman, Ankita Konwar are getting married; see pictures from mehendi ceremony\n\nThe couple worked magic on the runway, making them the most adored model couple in India. And who doesn't remember the controversial ad campaign that featured them both twined together in the buff, with just shoes on? The couple split in 1995, sending shockwaves in the fashion industry.\n\nAlso Read: Here's what Milind Soman and Ankita Konwar wore for their mehendi ceremony\n\nMylene Jampanoi\n\nNot many might know this, but Milind was once married (and not too long ago at that). He met Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, on the sets of their 2006 film, Valley of Flowers. The couple married in July 2006 at a tourist resort in Goa. Milind and Mylene decided to part ways in 2008, after their relationship became difficult due to their distance of workplaces. The couple divorced in 2009.\n\nAlso Read: While you were being lazy, Milind Soman covered 517 km barefoot\n\nShahana Goswami\n\nFrom featuring together on a magazine cover to attending events, Milind and Shahana caught the limelight since 2010. The 21-year gap between their ages was criticised, but the couple was not daunted by any of it. This was Milind's first confirmed relationship after Mylene. The couple split after four years of togetherness, in 2013.\n\nDipannita Sharma\n\nMilind was rumoured to be dating his co-star from two movies, Dipannita Sharma throughout the 2000s. The couple starred in 16 December (2002) and Jodi Breakers (2012), and were rumoured to be in a relationship since 2002. Their on-screen chemistry in 16 December fuelled these reports. A TOI report reveals that they also shared a flat in Mumbai, with Bipasha Basu, during this period.\n\nGul Panag\n\nIt was speculated back in 2005 that Milind was dating Gul Panag, after they starred in a film called Jurm in 2005. Milind himself denied the relationship during an interview with TOI in 2005. \"Gul and I have a professional relationship. That's all,\" he said back then. Milind and Gul have since shared many platforms together, including breast cancer awareness campaigns, but the rumour that they were dating have died down considerably."
