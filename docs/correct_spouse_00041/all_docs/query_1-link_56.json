        "text": "It looks like wedding countdown has begun for Milind Soman and his girlfriend Ankita Konwar. A picture of their 'mehendi ceremony' is going viral on social media. The photo posted on Instagram by photographer Anju Kp, shows Mikind,and Ankita with mehendi on her hands.\n\nThe couple are reportedly in Alibaug for the wedding. Though there has been no official confirmation, reports suggest the couple may tie the knot on April 21. Putting an end to rumours of a breakup, the couple had recently posted pictures.\n\nMilind was earlier married to French actress Mylene Jampanoi from whom he separated in 2009. Actor-model Milind is a known fitness promoter and a barefoot marathon lover. He is also the founder of Pinkathon for women. Last year, he was bestowed the title of 'Ultraman' - an honour reserved for those who survive the most difficult marathon in the world.\n\nAnkita Konwar is also a fitness enthusiast. The couple has often faced unsavoury comments on social media due to their glaring age difference. Milind is 52 and Ankita is 27 years old."
