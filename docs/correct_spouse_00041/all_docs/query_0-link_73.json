        "text": "Marathon runner, actor, model, \"sexiest man in India\", besides other things, Milind Soman has found a new descriptor on social media: creep.\n\nThe 52-year-old, who recently celebrated his birthday, is now in the news for his dating habits. A Free Press Journal article titled “50 plus, and Milind Soman’s living it up, with 18-year-old girlfriend Ankita Konwar” has triggered an uproar.\n\nAccording to the article, Ankita Konwar, Soman’s partner is only 18, an air hostess, and like her partner, a marathon runner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, many have come forward to say how egregious they find the relationship.\n\nOf course, the “facts”, as reported in the FPJ article, may not be all that accurate.\n\nMost reports about Soman and Konwar, however, do make the point that the age difference is huge, but few actually mention her actual age.\n\nWhile an NDTV Khabar report says she is 18, a GQ piece claims she's 23. And even though the validity of either reports cannot be ascertained; oddly enough, in an interview with a website called BollywoodShaadis.com, Soman said that she and Milind have been in a relationship for four years, when asked about their plans to tie the knot.\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nSome people argue that since Konwar is a consenting adult, she has the right to be in the relationship of her choice. The fact that one finds it morally wrong for a 50-year-old to be in a relationship with an adult teenager is not only puritanical in nature, it also infantilises a grown-up woman capable of making her own choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoman, on his part, as has been pointed out by many, displays a dating pattern as well: being with women much younger than him. Soman was previously married to Mylene Jampanoi, his French co-star in the film, Valley of Flowers from 2006 to 2009. She was 15 years younger to him. After that Soman was in a relationship with Shahana Goswami. The age gap between them was 21 years."
