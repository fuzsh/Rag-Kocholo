The music has been composed by Pritam.\n\n\"The film is a psychological thriller, and not a triangular love story,\" Milind said about Bhram.Â\n\n\"I cannot reveal more of the story or (producer) Nari Hira will kill me,\" he added. The screenplay of Bhram,Â slated for a January release, has been written by Bhavani Iyer, whoÂ previously wrote Sanjay LeelaÂ Bhansali'sÂ Black.\n\nIn the picture: Mylene Jampanoi with husband Milind Soman [Images]."
