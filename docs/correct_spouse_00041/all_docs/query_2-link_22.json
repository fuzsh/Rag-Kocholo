While some relationships and marriages have lasted, many others have not. We take a look at our celebrities and their inter-racial love affairs:\n\nShashi Kapoor and Jennifer Kendal: One of the first cross-border love affairs in the Indian film industry was that of actor Shashi Kapoor and British theatre actress Jennifer Kendall. The two met at Mumbai’s Royal Opera House, during the screening of Prithvi Theatre’s Deewar, when Kapoor approached Kendall, whose theatre group, Geoffrey Kendall’s Shakespearana International Theatre Company, was also performing there. They continued meeting each other, fell in love, and got married in 1958. They remained married until Kendall passed away of colon cancer in 1984. Kapoor and Kendall have three children – Sanjana Kapoor, Kunal Kapoor and Karan Kapoor.\n\nMilind Soman and Mylene Jampanoi: The Indian super model met French actress Mylene Jampanoi while on the sets of a film, Valley of Flowers, in July 2006. They got married in Goa, six months later. Their marriage, however, did not last long, and the two parted ways three years later. Distance, was reportedly one of the main reasons why their marriage hit the rocks - Jampanoi was in Paris, while Soman was in India.\n\nCelina Jaitley and Peter Haag: While a career in Bollywood was not really on her cards, Celina found her love in Australian businessman Peter Haag. The two got married in 2011, and are proud parents to twin boys – Winston and Viraaj, born in March 2012. Celina currently shuttles between Dubai, Singapore and Mumbai.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Rosa Catalano: After the breakup of his 13-year marriage with Amrita Singh, Saif Ali Khan met Italian model Rosa Catalano, and fell in love with her. But, their relationship lasted only for three years, as Catalano found out that Khan had been previously married and had two children - a fact that she alleges Khan had hid from her.\n\nIleana D’Cruz and Andrew Kneebone: The Barfi actress is dating Australian national Andrew Kneebone, a photographer. Kneebone had even done a cameo in her 2014 film, Happy Ending.\n\nRicha Chadda and Frank Gastambide: The actress met French actor director Frank Gastambide during the promotions of her film Masaan, at the Cannes Festival in France in 2015, and hit it off instantly. Theirs was a long distance relationship, but as work commitments came in the way, the duo decided to part ways in February, this year.\n\nSuchitra Pillai and Lars Kjeldsen: Electronic engineer turned model, actress and TV host, Suchitra Pillai met Danish environmental engineer Lars Kjeldsen at a common friend’s dinner party. The duo took it easy, and spent time getting to know each other before making their relationship official. They got married in 2006, in a traditional Malayali wedding in Kerala, and a white wedding in Denmark. Lars moved to Mumbai after the marriage, and they have a daughter, Annika, born in 2008.\n\nMadhu Sapre and Gian Maria Emendatori: After her much talked about relationship and messy breakup with model Milind Soman, former supermodel Madhu Sapre met Italian businessman Gian Maria Emendatori. They got married in 2001, post which Sapre moved to Italy, and had a daughter in 2012.\n\nKangana Ranaut and Nicholas Lafferty: Actress Kangana Ranaut had been in a committed relationship with UK based Doctor Nicholas Lafferty for over a year, when they broke up in September 2012. The reason behind the split, according to friends of the actress, was that while Lafferty wanted to take the relationship further and settle down, Ranaut was not ready."
