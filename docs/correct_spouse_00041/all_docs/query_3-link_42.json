        "text": "Born\n\nBharat Kalicharan\n\n1972\n\nDied 13 August 2004 (aged 31–32)\n\nNagpur, India\n\nCause of death Lynching Other names Akku Yadav Details Victims Total rapes and attacks unconfirmed; possibly 3 or more dead 1991–2004 Country India\n\nDate apprehended\n\n12 August 2004\n\nThe women who killed Yadav claimed that he had been raping and abusing local women with impunity for over a decade and that the local police had refused to help his victims or pursue charges because Yadav was bribing the police. Yadav had also reportedly murdered at least three people and dumped their bodies on local railroad tracks.[2] Two weeks before the lynching, Yadav was reported to have come to the home of Usha Narayane, a local activist, with several dozen of his men and threatened to rape her and throw acid in her face.[2] When Narayane threatened to blow up her home using gas, Yadav and his men fled, and a mob burned down Yadav's home.[3]\n\nBharat Kalicharan (1972 – 13 August 2004), also known as Akku Yadav, was a 32-year-old rapist, extortionist, and accused murderer in India. Sep 17, 2014 NO insurance company I have ever worked for prior or since pays as much in commission as USHA and NO insurance company has a product that is as innovative. Also, I'm not going to rehash what everyone else has already said, it is not a 9-5 job and if.\n\nFive women were immediately arrested but released following demonstrations in the city. Every woman living in the local slum claimed responsibility for the lynching.[2] Usha Narayane was arrested and charged with murder, as were other women. In 2012, Narayane was acquitted.[4] Twenty-one other people, including six women, were also arrested and released due to lack of evidence.[5] A judge noted a lack of reliable witnesses to the lynching, including unreliable police statements, and cited Yadav's autopsy report, which showed alcohol in Yadav's system, as proof that Yadav was receiving preferential treatment from police.[4]\n\nIn 2013, Akku Yadav's nephew, Aman Yadav, was stabbed to death following similar circumstances.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n^TNN (22 October 2012).
