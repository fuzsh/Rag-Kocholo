        "text": "In what came as a heartbreak for many women fans Milind Soman, the model-athlete tied the knot with Ankita Konwar on Sunday at a private function in Alibaug.\n\nAs fans stayed glued to social media for candid clicks that emerged from the venue, Milind himself took to Instagram on Monday to declare his love for his wife. Milind captioned the adorable picture of the couple from the wedding ceremony: To love forever and a new beginning everyday. I love you. Ankita also took to Instagram to post a picture. Photos of their mehendi ceremony had spread via Instagram on April 21.\n\nMilind was earlier married to French actress Mylene Jampanoi from whom he separated in 2009. Milind is a known fitness promoter and a barefoot marathon lover. Milind is also the founder of Pinkathon for women. Last year, Milind was bestowed the title of 'Ultraman'â€”an honour reserved for those who survive the most difficult marathon in the world.\n\nAnkita Konwar is also a fitness enthusiast. The couple has often faced unsavoury comments on social media due to their glaring age difference. Milind is 52 and Ankita is 27 years old."
