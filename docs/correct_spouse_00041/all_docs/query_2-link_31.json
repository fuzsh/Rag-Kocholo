        "text": "female version of johnny depp?!\n\nDont know if shes exactly the female version of Johnny Depp but that's what people are calling her anyway.\n\nFrom what ive seen of her movies though, she's a really good actress and i guess the comparison is that theyre both very 'out there' type actors.\n\nTrivia:\n\n# She is half Chinese, half French.\n\n# She is sometimes labelled as the female version of Johnny Depp due to her desire for daring roles as well as her extremely versatile acting skills.\n\n# Her film 'The Chinese Botanist's Daughters' was nominated for best foreign language film at the Golden Globes.\n\n# Mylene is fluent in French and English and is currently taking Chinese language classes because she believes it is important to reconnect with her roots. She also hopes that it will help increase her chances of taking part in more Asian films as Asian cinematography is her passion.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Honestly, I'd love to play the role of a transexual; a man. That's the kind of role I'm looking forward to most of all -it'd be a highlight in my acting career. I am extremely fascinated by the history of Jing Xing, a young man from the army who became a famous dancer. It'd be an enthralling part to play.\"\n\n\"I come from a Chinese-French background. It's a shame that I'm not very familiar with the Chinese culture and so when the opportunity came [The Chinese Botanist's Daughters], I was strongly interested, not only because of the script and my character, but also because I have long been curious of my origins. It's something which I feel in me and which I have need to know. I knew very little of my father -he left when I was 3 years old -and so my view and image of Asia was extremely limited. My father is full Chinese but he grew up in Vietnam and fled the country at the time of political dissidences. He travelled all over Asia and then finally arrived in France where he met my mother...he then went to live in Canada. Even when I was younger, I had this attraction to Asia. I love the culture and I'm even taking Mandarin classes -maybe in ten years time, my Mandarin level will be acceptable (laughs). Being able to be a part of both these films directed in Asia [The Chinese Botanist's Daughters, Valley of Flowers] are invaluable voyages for me because it gave me a chance to gain a better understanding of who I was.\"\n\n\"Nudity is absolutely natural to the French. What am I willing to do in the name of acting? For me, there are no limits. Naked scenes are scenes of the everyday life. I don't believe in exploiting myself if say, a sex scene was filmed purely for shock factor or sexual thrill, but it's entirely okay for me if it makes my character any more believable.\"\n\n\"It disturbs me to see how American cinema portray Asian codes, ideas and culture incorrectly in films such as Memoirs of a Geisha. That's lost in translation for you\".\n\n\"Because my green eyes are not common amongst the Chinese, I was advised to wear dark contacts for my audition [of The Chinese Botanist's Daughters] but at the last minute, I decided to just stay true to who I was. I had a hard time convincing the director that I was a suitable choice for the role of Ming. Eventually they had to modify the character to suit my image but in truth, I was still ultimately chosen specifically because of my Chinese heritage.\"\n\n\"I'm not in a hurry to make as many films as possible. I prefer to take the time in finding an interesting role. It's a shame that in France prejudices still remain -you know, those roles of 'exotic' girls in the Asian beginnings (rolls eyes).\"\n\n\"I'd really like to work in China. For my role as Ming, I had to learn my lines phonetically and so I'm sure I made some mistakes. But I want to take my work more seriously so I'm getting personal Mandarin lessons at home. Once I have a better command of the language, I will consider a career in France and Asia. I hate making a half-richard simmons job at anything -the accent is in serious need of work.\"\n\nFilmography:\n\nThe Chinese Botanist's Daughters (highly recommended)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nPlot Outline: Forbidden love upsets the real and symbolic balance of an earthly paradise in \"The Chinese Botanist's Daughters,\" a languid lesbian romance set in China in the early '90s.\n\nValley of Flowers\n\nGenre: Romance / Adventure\n\nPlot Outline: A greatest Asian love story, an unforgettable tale about passion, death and reincarnation. A mesmerizing Himalayan epic that spans two centuries, from the Silk Route of the early 19th century to the bustling metropolis of modern-day Tokyo.\n\ncreds: mq palace"
