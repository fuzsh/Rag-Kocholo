        "text": "Former Indian supermodel and ‘Iron Man’ Milind Soman is set to marry his 28-year-old Ankita Konwar this weekend. Photos of the 52-year-old actor with his girlfriend in Alibaug are being shared by his friends all over Instagram in the haldi ceremony held on Saturday morning.\n\nThe couple is seen grooving to Guru Randhawa’s song ‘Banja Tu Meri Rani’ in one such video shared online. While Soman is seen wearing a white kurta and dhoti, Ankita is seen wearing a yellow lehenga at the resort in Mumbai’s Alibaug area.\n\nWhile rumours have been doing the rounds about the couple getting married, the social media activity seems to cement the fact that the fitness enthusiast and his air-hostess girlfriend from Assam are finally set to get married.\n\nMilind Soman who shot to fame in the late 1980s was in a relationship with former Indian model Madhu Sapre. The actor has been married only once before to Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, who he met on the sets of their 2006 film, Valley of Flowers.The couple were in a relationship for two years before they divorced in 2008 due to their distance and careers in different countries."
