        "text": "When 29-year-old Ankita Konwar married 55-year-old Milind Soman, it set off heated debates and criticisms on the internet with many disapproving of the wide age gap between the two. The couple have addressed the age gap multiple times in the past but the question popped up once again during an interaction hosted by Ankita on her Instagram handle.\n\n\"How did you tackle/ manage this Indian stereotype of 'Don't marry an older man'?\" Ankita was asked. She replied: \"Anything that's not common in a society, people usually like to talk about it. And it's not just limited to India. We as a species, have a tendency to get weird about the unknown, the unexplored, AKA fear. A survival skill.\"\n\n\"And sometimes we are not conscious enough to distinguish between the utility and the waste of that skill. I have always done what makes me happy,\" she added. Ankita and Milind got married in a Maharashtrian ceremony in April 2018. The couple also exchanged wedding vows in a \"barefoot wedding\" in Spain a few months later. Milind was earlier married to actress Mylene Jampanoi, whom he had met on the sets of the 2006 film Valley Of Flowers."
