        "text": "The swimmer, runner and model is on everybody’s mind, for no small reason. Milind Soman completed one of the toughest sporting events, the Triathlon, in Zurich, on July 19. The event required participants to do a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bicycle ride and run 26.2 miles, all within 17 hours. Milind finished the race in a record 15 hours and 19 minutes!\n\nIt’s well known that the 50-year-old athlete-model has always been a fitness freak, but he has also grown over the years, to become a fitness mentor to many in the country, and abroad. Inspiring many to join sports, especially women, the versatile Milind with this race, has taken the cause of body-fitness a whole notch higher.\n\nMilind began his career as a swimmer, winning his first National medal at the young age of 10. After that, swimming became everything, despite his parents having their own concerns about his studies. However, Milind went on to finish his electrical engineering, while not giving up swimming in the bargain.\n\nHe began modeling in his twenties, and after initial hiccups and a few controversies, sealed his place in the modelling industry too. As a supermodel, Milind was a casanaova no girl could turn away from. He also started running at the age of 38 and went on to set a Limca record for a Greenathon he ran for, to spread environmental awareness.\n\nDating the who and who of Bollywood like Gul Panag and Bipasha Basu, Milind got engaged to fellow model Madhu Sapre, but the relationship failed. Eventually, in 2006 he married his French girlfriend Mylene Jampanoi, and the marriage lasted only 3 years.\n\nNot so lucky with love, Milind was still relentlessly pursuing both his sporting career and his Bollywood projects as actor and producer. His movie Rules: Pyar ka Superhit Formula did well at the box office. But Milind didn’t really see the light as an actor, although the industry did take notice of his Greek- God looks and business acumen.\n\nMilind has spoken about his family in many interviews and considers his mother to be his inspiration. She was the one that let her son follow his instincts about sports and today India has a good looking athlete to boast of.\n\nToday Milind enjoys a comfortable place as an athlete and producer and is juggling both parts with finesse.\n\nFolomojo congratulates the athlete turned actor turned fitness mentor on his Triathlon success!\n\nAlso read:\n\nHow ‘The Wall’ was built: A nostalgic video featuring Rahul Dravid’s cricketing journey"
