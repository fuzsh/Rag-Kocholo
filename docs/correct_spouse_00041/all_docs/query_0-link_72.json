        "text": "TNT Desk | December 17, 2018\n\n\"I do not really consider the age gap. Of course, two people are always different, in terms of age, background, experiences and culture. So there are always things that need to be understood and accepted. There are old habits that you have to unlearn to keep a relationship strong, positive and healthy. It is important to make your partner feel comfortable and help her achieve what she wants\", so said doting husband Milind Soman about his relationship with wife Ankita Konwar who originally hails from Assam in an interview with The Week.\n\nMilind Soman and Ankita Konwar tied the knot on April 22, at Alibaug earlier this year. The wedding was an intimate affair, with only family and close friends attending the ceremony.\n\nMilind had received flak ever since his relationship with Ankita came to the fore. The 52-year-old model was called out for romancing a woman half his age. The couple, however, did not give any weightage to the criticism, and finally got married.\n\nThis is Milind's second marriage, after having divorced Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, in 2009.\n\nMilind and Ankita have never hidden their closeness and affection from the world. Both of them regularly post pictures together. In one such post, Ankita wrote: \"I don't want to know what it's like to live without you, Don't want to know the other side of a world without you.\""
