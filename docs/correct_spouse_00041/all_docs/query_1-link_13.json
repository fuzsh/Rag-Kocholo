In a few interviews in the past, Milind has clearly stated that because of the lack of a pattern in his life, he makes for a very good boyfriend, not a good husband.\n\nBut this is not to tell you about Milind's accomplishments as a lover. This is to tell you about the new love in his life, who, as it turns out, is a girl half his age. Her name is Ankita Konwar and she's an air hostess by profession.\n\nWe don't know if a young cupid has suddenly struck the industry--with director Anurag Kashyap finding love in a 23-year-old--but we do know that 51-year-old Milind seems like he's in this one for the long haul. Don't believe us? Here are some pictures that might serve as proof:\n\nMilind married his French co-star--from the movie Valley of Flowers--Mylene Jampanoi in July 2006; the couple got divorced in 2009. The actor then dated actress Shahana Goswami, till their relationship came to an end in 2013. The age gap between Milind and Shahana was that of 21 years."
