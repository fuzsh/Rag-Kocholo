My sweetest, most adorable and someone who greatly excites and inspires me... Milind (Soman),\" Shahana tweeted.\n\nThe 46-year-old, who had a relationship with co-model Madhu Sapre in the past, married Mylene Jampanoi, his French co-star in \"Valley of Flowers\" in 2006, but got divorced in 2009.\n\nShahana, 26, who was appreciated for her performance in Farhan Akhtar's Rock On!!, has been dating Milind for more than three years now."
