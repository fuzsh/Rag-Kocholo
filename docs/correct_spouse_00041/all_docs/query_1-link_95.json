        "text": "Emerging from that big box in Alisha Chinai's 'Made in India' music video, Milind Soman stepped straight into our hearts. From ruling the ramp in the 90s to ageing like fine wine, and doing his bit for society by creating awareness on breast cancer, he's served as an inspiration throughout. Milind also made it to the headlines a few years ago for dating Ankita Konwar, a flight attendant, who's almost half his age. They got good wishes and also a lot flak when Milind made it official on Instagram. However, he was not someone who'd give in to trolls. The model-turned-actor gave it back by posting PDA-filled pictures and captions.\n\nRecently, the jodi fuelled rumours of their engagement when Ankita took to Instagram to post this: \"I don't want to know what it's like to live without you, don't want to know the other side of a world without you\". Not only this, the picture with the caption showed her flashing a ring. Now, if latest reports are anything to go by, the couple's going to tie the knot on April 21 in Alibaug. Yes, you read that right! A source informed Times Of India that they're going to host a simple and intimate ceremony. \"Only close friends and family know about the wedding. The couple did not want to make their wedding a huge affair,\" added the source.\n\nGoing by the source's information, Milind will be tying the knot for the second time. Earlier, he was married to Mylène Jampanoï, his co-star from the film Valley of Flowers. They fell in love on the sets of the film and walked the aisle in 2006. However, after almost three years of marriage, they decided to part ways. Post that, he dated supermodel Madhu Sapre for a while.\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
