        "text": "Name: Milind Soman\n\nHeight: 5'7\"\n\nDate of Birth: 4 November, 1965\n\nBirth Place: Glasgow, Scotland\n\nWeight: 190 lbs\n\nHobbies: Trekking\n\nLikes: Listening to music, reading fiction books\n\nFavorite Author: Agatha Christie\n\nMilind Soman, the first Indian male supermodel, was born in a Maharashtrian Kokanastha Brahmin family and spent the first seven years of his life in England. He started his life as an Electrical Engineer. At the age of 24, he was planning to go to the United States for a course in Scuba Diving. By chance, he became a model. At first he was rejected by Graviera Suitings because he appeared too young to don a suit. However, soon afterwards, he was called by Thackersey for a fabrics shoot. He never looked back. His Greek God looks, intense eyes and fine bone structure, he was a ravishing model be it on the ramp, in the print media or in television assignments.\n\nBefore long, Milind started featuring in music videos. He was seen in Alisha Chinai's successful music video \"Made In India\". Soon television serials like \"A Mouthful of Sky\", \"Sea Hawks\" and \"Margarita\" happened. In next to no time, his talent won him film projects. He had been offered a part in Mansoor Khan's Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, but he declined, as well as Amol Palekar's parallel film Daayra. He then made his debut in the world of movies opposite TAbu in Tarkieb. The movie flopped. But his critics were silenced with his next venture, 16 December. Since then, this model turned actor has played crucial roles in almost 8 movies in the past six years. He has even begun to produce serials and daily soaps for television. Recently, his production for children, Ghost Bana Dost, is being aired in one of the popular Hindi channels of the country.\n\nIn the course of his modeling career, in 1995 he got involved into a huge controversy when he appeared in a exposed ad for Tuff shoes with his the-then girl-friend supermodel Madhu Sapre with nothing but a python wrapped around them. The Maharsthra government charged a case of obscenity against them.\n\nMilind Soman met his life-partner, French actress Mylene Jampanoi, during the shooting of their forthcoming film \"Valley of Flowers\" and they got married in 2006 at a tourist resort in Goa.\n\nThis believer of destiny lets life take its own course and relishes every moment of it."
