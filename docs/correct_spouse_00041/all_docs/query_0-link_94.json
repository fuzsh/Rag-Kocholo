        "text": "Milind Soman’s recent selfie with girlfriend Ankita Konwar is creating a major buzz all over the internet. Earlier this week, Milind attended the Spring-Summer 2018 edition of Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW) with his girlfriend.\n\nTaking to his Instagram handle, the model cum actor posted a selfie of the couple, twinning in t-shirts by Deivee, a lifestyle brand founded by him. What took everyone by surprise was seeing the two of them walk hand in hand at the show presented by designer Nida Mahmood in association with brand Deivee.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Milind is breaking the news. Few months bago, the fitness guru posted several pictures of himself with Ankita, making their relationship official.\n\nMilind Soman was earlier married to French actor Mylène Jampanoï in 2006. The couple had a divorce after three years of marriage."
