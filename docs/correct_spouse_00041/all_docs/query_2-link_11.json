        "text": "The nation's longtime heartthrob, Milind Soman, married his girlfriend Ankita Konwar on 22 April 22 2018. The couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in Alibaug, and soon after became the talk of town. If there wasn't charcha around the actor/model getting involved with a woman half his age, it was die-hard fans gushing over his salt n’ pepper hair, while filling up the comment section of his Instagram account with messages like, “You broke my heart, Milind!”\n\nFor the uninitiated, before the 54-year-old fell head over heels in love with Ankita, his marriage to her would be his second after having divorced Mylene Jampanoi, a French actress, in 2009. Prior to that, he has also been in several lesser-known relationships with Bollywood celebrities -- a little trivia that we’re letting you in on today!\n\nFor the ladies who can’t seem to get enough of the hunk, here’s a list of Milind’s past girlfriends… you wish you were one, don’t you?\n\n1. Madhu Sapre\n\nThe first relationship that Milind publicly acknowledged was with Madhu Sapre, second runner-up in the Miss Universe pageant, 1992. Milind and Madhu's relationship created quite a stir back then, after the couple were bold enough to reveal they were in a live-in relationship in Mumbai. The two of them worked on multiple projects together, and even got into a major controversy when they posed naked together for a fashion campaign. Madhu and Milind split in 1995.\n\n2. Shahana Goswami\n\nWhen Milind started dating Shahana in 2010, again, he went all out to make it known. From featuring together on a magazine cover to attending events, the duo was always in the limelight. Like the age-gap between Ankita and him, Shahana and Milind were 21 years apart -- something that was discussed at length, of course! This was his first relationship after his marriage to Mylene and lasted for close to three years.\n\n3. Dipannita Sharma\n\nWhile there’s still no official confirmation on this one, rumour has it that Dipannita and Milind were very much in love during the 2000s. After the couple's electric chemistry came through with their film Jodi Breakers (2012), it added even more fuel to the fire. Sources had even revealed that the two of them were living together (along with Bipasha Basu!) for a brief while.\n\n4. Gul Panag\n\nAfter Milind and Gul got together to do Jurm in 2005, it is believed the duo got along like a house on fire and began dating shortly after. When quizzed on whether there was any truth to this, Milind told TOI, \"Gul and I have a professional relationship. That's all.” The media, however, were far from convinced. Milind and Gul have shared many platforms since, including breast cancer awareness campaigns, fashion shows and more. Bollywood insiders call it an “open secret”.\n\n5. Mylene Jampanoi\n\nMilind met Mylene Jampanoi, his first wife, on the sets of the film Valley of Flowers. They tied the knot in 2006 at a resort in Goa, but unfortunately, things went downhill soon after. Milind Soman and Mylene Jampanoi got divorced in 2009.\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
