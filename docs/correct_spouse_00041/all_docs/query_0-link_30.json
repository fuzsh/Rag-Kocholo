        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfession Actress\n\nPseudo Lena Jam-Panoi\n\nFrench nationality\n\nBirth July 12, 1980 (Aix-en-Provence, Bouches-du-Rhône – France)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nWife of Indian actor Milind Soman .\n\nPassionate about traveling since her adolescence, Mylène Jampanoï, whose real name is Lena Jam-Panoï, dreamed of being an actress and tried to make a career by going to Paris in 2000. Luck smiled on her the following year when she was offered a role recurring in the television series Sous le soleil . At the same time, she took acting lessons at the Ateliers de L’Ouest. Noted for her mixed-race charm and her disturbing gaze, she appears successively in Les Rivières pourpres 2 – lesangels de l’apocalypse (2004), 36 Quai des Orfèvres (id.) and Cavalcade (2005).\n\nBut she landed her most interesting roles through contact with Asian filmmakers: Dai Sijie who made her appear in The Botanist’s Daughters (2006), a film which addresses the taboo subject of female homosexuality in China, and the Indian Nalin Pan who imagines her as a demonic heroine in the supernatural Valley of Flowers (2007). It was during this filming that she met her future husband, actor Milind Soman . Back in France, she rode the revival of genre cinema by starring under the direction of Pascal Laugier in the sulphurous Martyrs (2008). The same year, she was the French voice of Master Viper in the cartoon Kung Fu Panda ."
