        "text": "Controversies surrounding Milind-Ankita's relationship\n\nMilind Soman received a lot of flak on social media when he made his relationship with Ankita Konwar, who is almost half his age, public. Ankita's family was also not happy with the union because of the age gap. However, after seeing how much they are in love with each other, their family chose to ignore the fact.\n\nMilind Soman always remains in the news\n\nMilind Soman was first seen in Alisha Chinai's single 'Made In India'. He became a national heartthrob in no time and still continues to be one. He was also in news for running the marathon with his mother. He was earlier married to French actress Mylène Jampanoï in 2006 which lasted for 3 years. Now, his wedding news has certainly broken many hearts today."
