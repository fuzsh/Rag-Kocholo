        "text": "She talks about being the face of Dior briefly here:\n\nAs pretty as a snowflakeAs pretty as a snowflake\n\nMylene Jampanoi glows with inner beauty.\n\nTHE new face of Diorsnow Sublissime is Mylene Jampanoi, an actress of French-Chinese parentage. With chestnut brown hair and mesmerising green eyes, Mylene now joins the ranks of Monica Bellucci and Sharon Stone as Dior’s ambassadors. She is also John Galliano’s muse and often seen at the front row of his fashion shows. In 2004, she got her first cinematic role in Les Rivieres Pourpres II (The Crimson Rivers II) by Olivier Dahan.\n\nOther movies that the 27-year-old actress has starred in are The Chinese Botanist’s Daughters, Valley of Flowers, Pleure en Silence (CryinginSilence), Cavalcade, and 36 Quai des Orfevres (also starring Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteil).\n\nStanding at 163cm tall, Jampanoi also stars in Le Bal des Actrices (The Actresses’ Ball, which also stars Isabelle Adjani and Bellucci), directed by Maiwenn, and Martyrs, directed by Pascal Laugier, which are slated for release this year.\n\nBorn in Aix-en-Provence, France, Jampanoi has been learning about Asia through books and movies, and has tried her hand at calligraphy. In her spare time, she also paints.\n\nApart from French, the stunning beauty also speaks some English (“I try to speak English with my husband”) and a smattering of Italian and Spanish. “I tried to learn Chinese but I’m not good at it yet,” she confesses.\n\nShe is married to Indian model and actor, Milind Soman, whom she met during the shooting of Valley of Flowers in the Himalayastwo years ago.\n\nHer first memory of make-up was when as a teenager, she tried on her mother’s make-up. However, it was not until she was 20 that she started to use make-up regularly.\n\nSince becoming the face of Dior, her life has changed. She likens it to finding treasure “in the cave of Ali Baba”.\n\n“Dior sends me everything – make-up, skincare products and dresses,” she says.\n\nIt has caused her to pay more attention to her feminine side.\n\n“Before this, I used to be so obsessed with my work, playing the different roles, that I neglected taking care of my body. Dior has helped me realise that I must take care of myself.”\n\nThe first thing she did was to stop smoking. She also sleeps a lot (“I love to sleep”) and is a vegetarian.\n\nHer beauty regime is quite simple.\n\n“It is important to have a good base, such as a hydrating cream and foundation,” she says, adding that she makes it a point to remove make-up properly.\n\n“I like to wash my face, and even bathe, with cold water,” she says, drawing oohs from press members at the interview in a prestigious hotel in Seoul.\n\nHer favourite cosmetics are Diorsnow’s Whitening Spot Reducer, High Shine lipstick and blusher. “I prefer fair skin, and I do not expose myself to the sun, if possible. If I have to go out into the sun, I use sunscreens and wear a hat,” she says.\n\nhttp://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/3/27/lifeliving/20155671&sec=lifeliving"
