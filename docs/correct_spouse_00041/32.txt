New Delhi: Model-turned-actor Milind Soman has married his French co-star Myleme Jampanoi ahead of the release of their film Valley of Flowers, a news report said on Monday.

Soman said that he fell in love with Jampanoi during the shooting of the film in Ladak and said that the wedding was held last week in a tourist resort of Goa.

"When we came here for promoting the film, I took Mylene to Goa. I love that place and my mother stays there too," he told a cheering audience at the cityâ€™s Siri Fort Auditorium where their film was screened over the weekend.

"It was there in a village that I proposed to her. She accepted, and we decided to get married immediately. It was a simple ceremony with just our families and close friends being present," he said.

Jampanoi, who stood next to her husband, said that she was shocked when Soman proposed to her.

"At first I didn't know what to do, how to respond. But then it sank in, and I was just so happy," she told a cheering audience.
