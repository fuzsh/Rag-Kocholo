Milind Soman and his French wife Mylene Jampanoi are in New York for theirÂ film Valley Of Flowers, which will be showcased at the ongoing Mahindra Indo-American Arts Council Film Festival.

Milind also stars in the upcoming Magna Films production Bhram, co-starring Dino Morea [Images],Â top model Sheetal Memon (in her debut movie), Simone Singh and Chetan Hansraj. The music has been composed by Pritam.

"The film is a psychological thriller, and not a triangular love story," Milind said about Bhram.Â

"I cannot reveal more of the story or (producer) Nari Hira will kill me," he added. The screenplay of Bhram,Â slated for a January release, has been written by Bhavani Iyer, whoÂ previously wrote Sanjay LeelaÂ Bhansali'sÂ Black.
