        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nALEIXANDRE, Vicente (1898-1984)\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 8267855\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10210107\n\n1898 1977 1984 Generation Nobel Prize Vicente Aisa\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis photograph captures Vicente Aleixandre (1898-1984), the esteemed Spanish poet, as he receives the National Literature Prize in 1984. Aleixandre, born in Granada in 1898, was a prominent figure in the Spanish literary scene of the 20th century. He was a key member of the Generation of '27, a group of writers and intellectuals who sought to challenge the conservative cultural and political climate of Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Aleixandre's poetic works were deeply influenced by his experiences during the Civil War and the subsequent years of dictatorship. His poetry was characterized by its exploration of the human condition, the search for meaning in a chaotic world, and a deep sense of longing for freedom and justice. In 1977, Aleixandre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, recognizing his significant contributions to Spanish literature. The photograph shows him in a moment of triumph and pride, surrounded by applauding audience members as he holds up the prize. The image is a testament to Aleixandre's enduring legacy as one of Spain's most important and influential poets. The photograph is a historical document of a pivotal moment in Spanish literary history, and a poignant reminder of the power of the written word to inspire and bring about change. It is a valuable addition to any collection of Spanish literature or photography, and a testament to the enduring importance of artistic expression and intellectual inquiry.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
