        "text": "The quiet, introspective world of the Spanish poet, Vicente Aleixandre, fell to pieces yesterday after he was awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nIn his ochre villa in a Madrid backstreet, the telephone rang, the doorbell chimed, and reporters pushed antique furniture out of the way to get near him.\n\n\"I am very surprised,\" the frail, 79 year-old poet said. He sat on a faded armchair in his study crammed from near to ceiling with books, including dusty works of the so-called \"1927 generation\" to which he belonged.\n\nThe generation's leading voice was the poet and playwright, Federico Garcia Lorca, who was murdered by the nationalists at the start of the Civil War in 1936.\n\nAsked about his philosophy of life, Mr. Aleixandre said: \"Man was born into this world in fear of a destiny unknown. Society must progress and offer man the means to develop his own destiny.\"\n\nMr Aleixandre, whom illness had kept in Spain while most of his contemporaries left the country under the dictatorship of Franco, looked bewildered by the attention suddenly thrust on him.\n\nAsked what he thought were his best works he said: \"Poets and writers are not often the best judges of their own works.\" But he said he considered La Destrucción o el Amor (Destruction or Love), Historia del Corazón (Story of the Heart), and Poemas de la Consumación (Poems of Consummation) among his best.\n\n\"Just as life is not static, poetry must be dynamic. It must be continuous evolution. Poetry must be human. If it is not human, it is not poetry.\"\n\nAs he answered questions, in a soft unhurried voice, Mr. Aleixandre looked as if he was summoning all the strength that enabled him to survive illness, Civil War, and loneliness.\n\nAround Mr. Aleixandre were the books that made loneliness bearable. They included works by the Spanish poet, Lope de Vega, the Argentine writer, Jorge Luis Borges, numerous almanacs, the English poets, Byron and Milton.\n\nBut he talked on about poetry. \"Poetry is a historic constant that does not change,\" he said. \"There are poetic eras that are more productive than others. But it is a medium of expression that endures.\"\n\nIn its Nobel citation, the Swedish Academy said that Mr. Aleixandre had \"the strength to survive\" in poetry written as he endured tuberculosis, Civil War, and then loneliness. Mr. Aleixandre, born in 1898, the son of a railway engineer, wrote poetry which \"illuminates man's condition in the cosmos.\""
