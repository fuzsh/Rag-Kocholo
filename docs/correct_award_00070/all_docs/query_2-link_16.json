        "text": "(1898–1984). The Spanish poet Vicente Aleixandre belonged to the Generation of 1927, a group of poets who combined elements of the Spanish lyric tradition with modernist experimentation. Strongly influenced by the surrealist school of poetic composition, he used metaphors of earth and nature to express the discontent of the human soul. He received the Nobel prize for literature in 1977.\n\nThe son of a railway engineer, Aleixandre was born on April 26, 1898, in Seville, Spain. He studied law and business management at the University of Málaga and from 1920 to 1922 taught commercial law. He became seriously ill in 1925 and during his convalescence wrote his first poems, which were published in the periodical Revista de Occidente. Aleixandre remained in Spain during the Spanish Civil War though his poetry was banned from 1936 to 1944. In 1949 he was elected to the Spanish Royal Academy.\n\nAleixandre’s first book, Ámbito, was published in 1928. It showed the influence of Jorge Guillén and Pedro Salinas, two fellow members of the Generation of 1927. Aleixandre displayed his mastery of free verse in his first major book, La destrucción o el amor (1935; Destruction or Love), which was awarded the National Prize for Literature. In this work he explored the theme of human identification with the physical cosmos. Similar themes appear in Sombra del paraíso (1944; Shadow of Paradise), considered by many to be his finest work. A greater emphasis upon human life is found in Historia del corazón (1954; History of the Heart) and En un vasto dominio (1962; In a Vast Domain), works that deal with time, death, and human solidarity. Aleixandre’s later poetry is of a metaphysical nature; he explored death, knowledge, and experience in Poemas de la consumación (1968; Poems of Consummation) and Diálogos del conocimiento (1974; Dialogues of Insight).\n\nIn addition to writing poetry of great originality and depth, Aleixandre published the prose work Los encuentros (1958; The Meetings), a book of fond sketches of his fellow writers. He died on Dec. 14, 1984, in Madrid."
