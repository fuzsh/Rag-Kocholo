        "text": "February 10, 2022\n\nJoyous flesh that flows between my hands,\n\nlover's face where I can look upon the world,\n\nwhere delicate birds copy themselves and disappear,\n\nflying off to where nothing is forgotten.\n\nThe surface of your body, diamond or hard ruby,\n\nsunlight that shines from between my hands,\n\nvolcano's mouth that gathers me in with its intimate music,\n\nand your teeth calling a call no one understands.\n\nI throw myself in and die, because I want to die,\n\nbecause I want to live in fire, because this air outside\n\nis not mine, it's the hot breath from below\n\nthat turns my lips gold and fiery when I come close.\n\nLet me, let me, let me look—stained with love,\n\nmy face flushed red by your purple life —\n\nlet me watch the low cries in your belly\n\nwhere I'm dying and throwing off this life, forever.\n\nI want love or death, I want to be totally dead,\n\nI want to turn into you, your blood, that roaring, confined lava\n\nthat sends our fingertips flying out, like water,\n\nso it can feel the beautiful edges of life.\n\nThis kiss on your lips like a sleepy thorn,\n\nlike an ocean that flew up, made into a mirror,\n\nlike the shine on a wing,\n\nthis kiss is still a pair of hands, a review of your rustling hair,\n\na crackling noise from the grudge-bearing light,\n\nlight or fatal sword that threatens my neck,\n\nthough it could never break up the wholeness of this world.\n\nMay 22, 2021\n\n\"Ven, ven, ven como el carbón extinto oscuro que encierra una muerte...\"\n\n\"Dime por qué tu corazón como una selva diminuta espera bajo tierra los impossibles pájaros...\"\n\n\"Vida que toda entera como una tarde há durado. Por que lo que allí está acabando, quizá, sí, sea la vida...\"\n\n\"Algunos han amado, otros hablaron mucho. Y se explican. Inútil, Nadie escucha a los vivos. Pero los muertos callan con más justos silencios.\"\n\n--\n\nAs poesias fazem jus ao título. A vida é uma constante espera pela luz; uma luz que nunca chega. Nos longos corredores escuros dos dias, o poeta sonhou tudo isto.\n\nMuito bom.\n\nAugust 9, 2020\n\nA most remarkable set of poetry and prose.\n\nI was so touched by the story of the poor young man who contacted the poet to ask if he wrote day and night.\n\nMarch 15, 2019\n\nI give five stars to the translators and editors of this admirable anthology which provides an excellent overview of Vicente Aleixandre's humdrum three-star career. Lewis Hyde, Stephen Bly and twelve other translators all manage with roughly equal skill to translate Aleixandre's limp, funeral Spanish into equally joyless English. The editor and publisher are to be commended for the way that they carefully align the Spanish and English texts on a line-by-line basis, thus allowing someone like myself who took two Spanish courses forty years ago at university to easily consult the original version.\n\nMost readers will likely take the greatest pleasure from the 28 pieces in the section \"Poems with Red Light\" which are in the classical surrealist mode and provide a bleak, pessimistic vision of the human condition.\n\nMy favorite poem however was \"A mi perro\"/\"To my Dog\" which can be found in the second last section \"Poems with With Light\". After despairing of humanity, Aleixandre finds comfort in his pet. He is neither of course the first nor will he be the last to come to this conclusion.\n\nApril 5, 2015\n\nI'm all alone. The waves; shoreline, listen to me.\n\nIn front of me, the dolphins or the sword.\n\nThe usual certainty, things without limits.\n\nThis tender head that's not yellow,\n\nthis sobbing stone made of flesh.\n\nSand, sand, your cry's the same as mine.\n\nYou don't live in my shadow like a breast,\n\nyou don't pretend that the sails, that the moving air,\n\nthat a wind from the north, an enraged wind\n\nis going to shove your smile out to sea\n\nand steal the great ships from the blood.\n\nLove, love, restrain your sullied foot.\n\nJuly 7, 2024\n\n4.5 stars. Stark poems of loneliness, darkness, and death, but not as depressing or pessimistic as that description suggests, for always in the exploration of our lives is the possibility of life and light in the darkness – what Aleixandre calls “a longing for the light,” which lends this collections its name. Aleixandre describes this so hauntingly in the title of my favorite poem in the collection: “Between Two Nighttimes, Lightning.” After a brief flirtation with surrealism, his work returns to the kind of concrete images that he says leaves behind the irrational images of his earlier surrealist stage as “unnecessary.”\n\nThis is a collection to read in the evening, preferably in the quiet or with the sound of crickets to keep you company.\n\nApril 1, 2014\n\nspanning nearly a half-century, a longing for the light collects poems from throughout vicente aleixandre's career. the spanish poet, nobel laureate (1977), and member of the generation of '27 (along with garcía lorca, cernuda, alberti, and guillén, amongst others) wrote in many different styles - beginning with the surrealism that so defined his early work. while most of his poems tend towards to doleful and elegiac, they are also frequently beautiful and concerned with the nature of man, time, and love. a longing for the light is both a stirring and stunning collection.\n\nwho i write for\n\ni\n\nhistorians and newsmen and people who are just curious ask me, who am i writing for?\n\ni'm not writing for the gentleman in the stuffy coat, or for his offended moustache, not even for the warning finger he raises in the sad ripples of music.\n\nnot for the lady hidden in her carriage (her lorgnette sending its cold light through the windowpanes).\n\nperhaps i write for people who don't read my poems. that woman who dashes down the street as if she had to open the doors for the sunrise.\n\nor that old fellow nodding on a bench in the little park while the setting sun takes him with love, wraps him up and dissolves him, gently, in its light.\n\nfor everyone who doesn't read my writing, all the people who don't care about me (though they care for me, without knowing).\n\nthe little girl who glances my way as she passes, my companion on this adventure, living in the world.\n\nand the old woman who sat in her doorway and watched life and bore many lives and many weary hands.\n\ni write for the man who's in love. for the man who walks by with his pain in his eyes. the man who listened to him. the man who looked away as he walked by. the man who finally collapsed when he asked his question and no one listened.\n\ni write for all of them. i write, mostly, for the people who don't read me. each one and the whole crowd. for the breasts and the mouths and the ears, the ears that don't listen, but keep my words alive.\n\nii\n\nbut i also write for the murderer. for the man who shut his eyes and threw himself at somebody's heart and ate death instead of food and got up crazy.\n\nfor the man who puffed himself up into a tower of rage and then collapsed on the world.\n\nfor the dead woman and the dead children and dying men.\n\nfor the person who quietly turned on the gas and destroyed the whole city and the sun rose on a pile of bodies.\n\nfor the innocent girl with her smile, her heart, her sweet medallion (and a plundering army went through there).\n\nand for the plundering army that charged into the sea and sank.\n\nand for the waters, for the infinite sea.\n\nno, not infinite. for the finite sea that has boundaries almost like our own, like a breathing lung.\n\n(at this point a little boy comes in, jumps in the water, and the sea, the heart of the sea, is in his pulse!)\n\nand for the last look, the hopelessly limited last look, in whose arms someone falls asleep.\n\neveryone's asleep. the murderer and the innocent victim, the boss and the baby, the damp and the dead, the dried-up old fig and the wild, bristling hair.\n\nfor the bully and the bullied, the good and the sad,\n\nthe voice with no substance\n\nand all the substance of the world.\n\nfor you, the man with nothing that will turn into a god, who reads these words without desire.\n\nfor you and everything alive inside of you,\n\ni write, and write.\n\n*edited and introduced by lewis hyde, with translations by lewis hyde, stephen kessler, robert bly, david pritchard, david unger, and ten others.\n\nDecember 7, 2007\n\nPoet John Bradley gave me an earlier edition of this wonderful book in 1983, I believe, and Aleixandre's poetry changed my life forever. Though I'd read other of his work before then, I discovered that this edition, gathered together by Lewis Hyde (who wrote The Gift), contains the best selection and group of poems (sometimes translated by others) available. Aleixandre too often gets overlooked when we talk about the Spanish Generation of '27. This book will not disappoint.\n\nMay 24, 2016\n\nMy Voice\n\nI was born one summer night\n\nbetween two pauses . Speak to me: I'm listening.\n\nI was born. If you could only see what suffering\n\nthe moon displays without trying.\n\nI was born . Your name was happiness.\n\nA hope under the radiant light, a bird .\n\nArriving, arriving. The sea was a pulse,\n\nthe hollow of a hand, a warm medallion .\n\nSo now they're all possible: the lights, the caresses, the skin, the horizon,\n\ntalking with words that mean nothing,\n\nthat roll around like ears or seashells,\n\nlike an open lobe that dawns\n\n(listen , listen ) in the trampled light.\n\nOctober 9, 2021\n\nMy Spanish is pretty rudimentary, but good enough for me to find most of these translations totally lackluster. One translator in particular throws in extra words to make phrases where the poet himself is elliptical, which was driving me nuts. Changes too that madke no sense \"llevados por nobles alazanes o bayos\" flipped to \"pulled by distinguished bays or chestnuts,\" destroying a rhythm that was easy to duplicate just by keeping to the original! The early poems have a lot of angst, frequently built around ocean metaphors, but the range is broader in the later selections; I liked the joyous bike-ride \"al colegio\" through the sun-bathed city, accompanied by butterflies and several of the more philosophical reflections on our unimaginably brief span of life. Robert Bly translated only 4, all of which are excellent (particularly \"The Body and the Soul\") - maybe someday he will give us a slim selection of Aleixandre translations worthy of the poet.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nMeren, valon ja suudelmien runoilija.\n\nVuoden 1977 Nobel-voittaja, espanjalaisrunoilija Vicente Aleixandre kirjottaa tavallaan aika stereotyyppisia runoja: luontokuvausta ja rakastavaisten kohtaamisia. Mutta hän tekee sen hyvin viehättävällä surumielisyydellä. Jotenkin Aleixandre saa eloa varjojen, tuulen, suudelmien ja tulen kuvauksiin.\n\nTämä valikoitujen runojen kokoelma on niitä harvoja tapoja, joilla espanjantaidoton voi Aleixandreen tutustua. Tämä on aidosti sääli sillä näytteet erityisesti Aleixandren 1950-luvun runoista olivat aidosti tosi kiinnostavia. Aleixandre myös ilmeisesti kirjotti vahvasti temaattisia kokoelmia, mikä tässä menetetään.\n\n\"Sinulle ja kaikelle mikä on elossa sisälläsi\n\nminä kirjotan ja kirjoitan \"\n\nDecember 17, 2021\n\nI think it’s really hard to read poetry properly in translation and I fear I didn’t catch the full glory of these in English.\n\nApril 15, 2009\n\nImagine tripping on acid under the stars while a skinny, withered-looking old man tells you all his deepest secrets. These are poems that breathe, rather than sit coldly on the page waiting to be analyzed. Although I'd love to think of myself as a passionate devourer of poetry, the unfortunate fact is that my mind is too fickle and impatient to tolerate most of it. This is strange because I love \"poetic\" prose and \"poetic\" movies, but there you have it.\n\nGiven my confessed know-nothing stance, I'm wholly unqualified to explain how or why this poetry works; I can only assure you that it does. Vicente Aleixandre's poems have intellectual depth yet can be felt, if not understood, instantaneously. Reading Aleixandre is similar to the experience I have reading a particularly obtuse but lush passage by Virginia Woolf. That is to say that an intangible mood washes over me, and then I reread the words many times trying to figure out where that intense feeling came from.\n\n(I do have to caution that, were I rating the English, I would give this book two stars. These translations are awkward, clumbering things. One of those unfortunate cases of \"read it in the original or don't read it at all,\" I'm afraid.)\n\nSeptember 12, 2020\n\nI own the Copper Canyon reprint from 1985.\n\nHyde's introduction helps me pinpoint my reactions to this collection, to this poet. Those first books, the first half of this collection, are genuinely and deeply sad. Many/most of them are built around surrealist techniques of disassociation. The kinds of breaks where the reader can feel temporarily abandoned. But then the poems do come together on some plain other than rational, some emotional whole, and that emotion is usually quite existentially sad. This poet couldn't quite bring himself to believe anything (not even love) could overcome the inevitable, perhaps boring, end of life.\n\n(As an aside, I wonder if anyone has talked about the influence of Neruda's love poems here. We know Aleixandre would have known the work. Hmm)\n\nIn the last half of the book, we get the reclusive but famous poet (if that's not an oxymoron) on his way to the Nobel, and speaking as the wise man who has understood the world. This work doesn't have nearly the surprises of the earlier poems and certainly doesn't make the same demands on the reader. It is much more accessible and felt, occasionally, as if it were straining toward profundity. Still, most of the poems are deeply engaged with their subject and draw me back to them for rereadng.\n\nMarch 23, 2008\n\nThis has currently been republished by Copper Canyon. An amazing selection of poems, of surrealistic wit but an underlying sadness. He is part of the generation that came out of Spain in the 20's that burst across the land like a celestial roman candle. See poems on pages, 15, 45, 155,\n\nHere is and excerpt from Death in the Waiting Room (prose poem)\n\n\" ...He hugged her like music. It made his ears whistle. The echoes, the tunes from a dream, were held there, hesitating in their throats like very sad water, \"Your eyes are so clear that your brains shine right through.\" A teardrop. White flies wander around without enthusiam...\""
