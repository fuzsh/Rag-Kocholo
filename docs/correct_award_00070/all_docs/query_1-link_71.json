        "text": "Winner of the Northern California\n\nBook Award\n\nWorld renowned as a master of modern fiction, Julio Cortázar was also a prolific poet. While living in Paris during the last months of his life, Cortázar assembled his lifes work in verse for publication, and Save Twilight selects the best of that volume, making his poems available in English for the very first time.\n\nThis expanded edition, with nearly one hundred new pages of poems, prose and illustrations, is a book to be savored by both the familiar reader and the newcomer to Cortázars work. Ranging from the intimate to the political, tenderness to anger, heartbreak to awe, in styles both formal and free, Cortázar the subverter of genres is revealed as a versatile and passionate virtuoso. More than a collection of poems, this book is a playful and revealing self-portrait of a writer in love with language in all its forms.\n\n“Kessler has found just the right turns of phrase in English to capture the Argentine’s deeply moving writing and exceptionally emotive language. What a gift this collection is for English-speaking readers.”—Edith Grossman\n\n“Some people run the world, others are the world. Cortázar’s poems are the world; they have a special consideration for the unknown.”—Enrique Vila-Matas\n\nThis book is the most comprehensive collection of the poetry of Luis Cernuda ever to appear in English. The original Spanish texts are presented opposite Stephen Kesslers new translations, to complement Kesslers previous translations of Cernudas collected prose poems, Written in Water (City Lights Books, 2004), winner of a Lambda Literary Award, and his selected later poems, Desolation of the Chimera (White Pine Press, 2009), winner of the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets.\n\n“La realidad y el deseo has conquered me with its immaculate perfection, with its enamored agony in chains, with its anger and its stony shadows. A book delicate and terrifying at the same time, like a pale key trailing strands of blood with each stroke of the strings. There will be no writer of any kind in Spain, if hes really a writer, a master of language, who wont be filled with admiration for the enchantment and refinement with which Luis Cernuda joins words together to create his own poetic universe; no one should be surprised by his rhapsodic lyricism, akin to Bécquers, and his capacity for myth, for the transformation of elements evident in the gorgeous poem Young Man of the Sea, with the power of our greatest classical poets. Federico García Lorca, 1936, on the first edition of the collected poems of Luis Cernuda\n\nIn Desolation of the Chimera, Stephen Kessler makes an outstanding contribution to the practice of translation, especially the translation of poetry, demonstrating a supple, nuanced response to the original work. Just as significant is how successfully he has met the pressing need to yet again bring to our attention, in a rich selection of poems, the compelling work of Luis Cernuda, whose writing languishes in that strange limbo of poets recognized and admired almost everywhere but in the English-speaking world. Edith Grossman, in her citation for the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award\n\nNormally translators have to sacrifice elegance to meaning or meaning to elegance, but over and over again you seem to be able to remain faithful to the original on both scores These are poems that I have read and reread countless times, so often, in fact, that sometimes I feel I have them ingrained in the deepest part of my memory. This being so, I feared that your versions would inevitably jar with my longstanding familiarity with the originals, but on the contrary, your English versions seem simply to offer a perfect mirror image of what Cernuda has written. James Valender, biographer of Luis Cernuda, in a letter to Stephen Kessler .\n\nFor sample poems, click here.\n\nFirst published in Spain in 1968, when the author was seventy, Vicente Aleixandre’s Poems of Consummation is an eloquent lyrical encounter with themes of Eros, memory, old age, death, and oblivion. In language both elemental and metaphysical, simple and profound, sensual and philosophical, the poet explores the paradoxes of consciousness in the face of individual mortality, celebrating the kiss and the sexual embrace as mysteriously enduring evidence of having lived. Without feel-good bromides or false optimism, yet with courage and a bracing engagement with unanswerable questions, Aleixandre reveals the consolation and inspiration of language pressed to the limits of the unsayable. In Stephen Kessler’s translation, echoes of the Spanish can be heard in an American English that sings to the contemporary ear with the musical nuance, clarity, strangeness, beauty, and depth of the originals.\n\nOne of Spain’s leading twentieth-century poets, Vicente Aleixandre received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1977. Born in Seville in 1898, he came of age in Madrid as a key member of the Generation of 1927—a cohort that included such figures as Rafael Alberti, Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí, Luis Cernuda, Federico García Lorca, Jorge Guillén and Pedro Salinas, among others—and remained at his family home there during and after the civil war because of his fragile health. As the resident link to that generation (most of them driven into exile or, in Lorca’s case, killed), Aleixandre played a crucial role in mentoring younger Spanish poets, in addition to producing more than a dozen important volumes of original poetry and prose. His selected poems in English, A Longing for the Light, appeared in 1978. He died in Madrid in 1984.\n\n“There are delights to be found throughout, both in the Spanish text and in Kessler's versions, which preserve the poet's voice as well as the sense and spirit of the originals, even their line breaks, and are exciting poems in English because of their fresh imagery, musicality, and surprising turns of phrase. In short, while remaining faithful to the Spanish, the translator is attentive to the texture of English and isn't afraid to take imaginative risks.... [T]he poems and the book as a whole become an interplay not only between two languages, but one that conjures up magic on the page. Vicente Aleixandre's Poems of Consummation, in Stephen Kessler's consummate translation, deserves all the readers its language and mystery can attract.” —Daniel Shapiro, American Book Review.\n\nFor Lucina Schell's review in Zoland Poetry, click here.\n\nTo read John Taylor's review in The Arts Fuse, click here.\n\nTo read Art Beck's review in Your Impossible Voice, click here.\n\nLuis Cernuda (1902-1963) was one of the leading poets of Spain’s legendary Generation of 1927, a constellation of creative genius that included such stars as Federico García Lorca, Luis Buñuel, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Guillén, Vicente Aleixandre, Salvador Dalí and Pedro Salinas. Cernuda left Spain during the civil war in 1938, lived for two decades in Great Britain and the United States, and spent the final years of his life in Mexico where he died of a heart attack at sixty-one. Desolation of the Chimera is the first major selection in English from his final two books, Con las horas contadas (With Time Running Out) and Desolación de la Quimera. These poems are the work of a master with nothing left to prove. He writes as if for himself, exiled as he is from his native land, ironically unaware that even then his star was rising among younger Spaniards as one of the most important voices of his time. His alienation, cosmopolitanism, open homosexuality, estheticism raised to a moral principle, and the raw honesty of his vision have resonated increasingly over the last fifty years with Spanish and Latin American readers. Of Cernuda, Octavio Paz wrote: “Few modern poets, in any language, give us this chilling sense of knowing ourselves to be before a man who really speaks, effectively possessed by the fatality and the lucidity of passion.”\n\nTo listen to a talk on Luis Cernuda by Stephen Kessler, click here.\n\n“His later works have been rendered into English with sensitivity, understanding, and grace by translator-poet Stephen Kessler. The poems in Desolation of the Chimera reflect the intense passion and despair of Cernuda's writing. They are nothing less than a gift to the English-language reader.” —Edith Grossman, in her judge’s citation for the 2010 Harold Morton Landon Translation Award of the Academy of American Poets\n\nRaymond Queneau (1903-1976), associated in the 1920s with the Dada and Surrealist movements in Paris, was later one of the founders and key members of Oulipo, or Workshop of Potential Literature. Author of several experimental novels, including Exercises in Style and Zazie dans le métro (which was made into a film by Louis Malle), Queneau is also an important poet, and this bilingual volume brings to life in English for the first time the range of his voices, modes, moods and styles, from the playfully absurd to the darkly existential. Dating from 1920 to 1943, the poems span the first long phase of his creative maturity, whose wit, formal inventiveness, philosophical seriousness, lyric elegance and sense of fun are faithfully represented in these translations.\n\n“Eyeseas is a rare achievement, a landmark of expert poetic experimentation and deftly creative translation.” —American Poet\n\nWinner of a 2004 Lambda Literary Award, this book collects in one volume exquisite writings by one of Spain’s great 20th-century poets. “If the art of poetry has its saints, like Dickinson and Paul Celan,” writes Harold Bloom in his book Genius, “then Luis Cernuda is among them.”\n\n“In these memories and landscapes, in these notes toward the history of his sensibility, there is great objectivity: the poet doesn’t set out to fantasize, or to lie to himself or anyone else. He attempts only to illuminate, with an almost impersonal light, something very personal: a few moments in his life. (But is it truly ours, this life we live?)” —Octavio Paz\n\n“Cernuda’s brief meditations on love, war and exile collected for the first time in one volume show the poet stretching his language and imaginative skills to capture abstracted emotions—an idle afternoon, or the deep longing of a man cut off not only from his homeland but also from a world seemingly determined to keep itself at war….In Stephen Kessler’s idiomatic translation, the impressionistic snapshots are compulsively readable.” —St. Petersburg Times\n\n“There is absolutely no artifice in his warm and candid writings, but they are, as it were, constantly aware of their artifice. Finding words for the mute torments of his sensibility, he considers himself to be ‘a sleepless voice calling who knows what or to whom in night’s nameless immensity.’ A permanent tension consequently underlies the calm, if syntactically intricate, surface of his prose (which has been sensitively rendered by Stephen Kessler, who also provides an insightful preface).” —Chelsea\n\n“Stephen Kessler’s brilliant translation...has to be one of the best books of Spanish poetry to appear in English this year....Kessler needs to be acknowledged as one of our best translators today, and this book brings to life a key Spanish poet.” —Ray Gonzalez, The Bloomsbury Review"
