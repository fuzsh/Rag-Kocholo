        "text": "Forty years after Vicente Aleixandre was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, a new edition of his complete poetry is released under the care of Alejandro Sanz, the number-one expert on his works.\n\nThe complete poetry, including unpublished works, of one of the great Spanish poets of the 20th century.\n\nVicente Aleixandre is undoubtedly one of the great Spanish poets of the 20th century, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1977 and Spain’s National Literature Prize for Narrative in 1933. His verses are characterised by a radical intensity that cuts through the manners and customs of an era, while never losing their strongly personal perspective. Aleixandre is the poet of knowledge, contemplation and love.\n\nAlong with Jorge Guillén and Luis Cernuda, Aleixandre’s poetry is the most enduring and demanding of the Generation of ˊ27.\n\nFirst published in 1968, when the author was seventy, Poems of Consummation is Vicente Aleixandre’s intimate, philosophic, densely compressed lyric engagement with old age and the mystery of death. The poems are intense, mostly brief, elemental in their imagery (stone, ocean, wind, fire), and they address, in sometimes gnomic terms, the unknowable—mainly the paradoxes of memory: the simultaneous absence and presence of remembered love and the lover no longer living. The voice in these poems anticipates its own posthumousness, and speaks at times as if (and now in fact) from beyond the grave."
