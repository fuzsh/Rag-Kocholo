        "text": "Unfortunately, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to many minor writers, at the expense of many important writers. A list of the great writers who never received the Nobel Prize, notwithstanding a general recognition of their achievements, includes:\n\nJorge-Luis Borges, one of the most influential literary figures of the 20th century\n\nBertold Brecht, the founder of modern theatre\n\nJoseph Conrad, one of the greatest novelists in English of all time\n\nFederico Garcia Lorca, one of the greatest Spanish poets of the last three centuries\n\nHenrik Ibsen, one of the greatest playwrights of all time\n\nHenry James, possibly the greatest USA novelist of all time\n\nJames Joyce, considered by many the most influential writer of the 20th century\n\nFranz Kafka, greatest German novelist of the 20th century\n\nVladimir Nabokov, one of the greatest USA novelists of the 20th century\n\nFernando Pessoa, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century\n\nMarcel Proust, considered by many the greatest French novelist of the 20th century\n\nPaul Valery, greatest French poet of the 20th century\n\nLev Tolstoy, one of the greatest Russian novelists\n\nAnton Chekhov, greatest Russian playwright\n\nOn the other hand, some minor writers have been awarded the prize. Many are simply mysterious decisions. It is difficult to understand what makes the jury prefer mediocre, provincial writers to so many greater writers. The Nobel Prize is awarded by a Swedish Academy. In particular, the writers of Sweden (a country of 10 million people) have won more prizes than the writers of all of Asia (a continent of 4.5 billion people). Is it the rest of the world that is illiterate and uncreative, or is it the Swedish academia that is parochial, nationalistic and anachronistic?\n\nOf all literary prizes for literature the Nobel Prize has become the least meaningful."
