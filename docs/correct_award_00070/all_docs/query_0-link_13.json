        "text": "The Hands\n\ntranslated by Lewis Hyde\n\nLook at your hand, how slowly it moves,\n\ntransparent, tangible, cut through with light,\n\nbeautiful, alive, almost human in the night.\n\nWith the moon’s reflection, with the pain in a cheek, with the\n\nvagueness of dreams\n\nlook at how it grows as you raise your arm,\n\nfruitless search for a lost darkness,\n\nwing of light that moves across in silence\n\nand feels that dark crypt with its flesh.\n\nYour sorrow doesn’t phosphoresce, it hasn’t caught\n\nthe other wing’s hot heartbeat.\n\nA flying hand being chased: a couple.\n\nSweet, dark and faded, you cross back and forth.\n\nYou are the calling of lovers, the signals\n\nthat silently appeal to one another in the dark.\n\nSky with rubbed-out stars, you give yourself,\n\nlike a warm field, to these noiseless wings."
