        "text": "Carlos BousoÃ±o is an example of creative development characterised by profound existentialist concerns. He has also done important work on criticism in the theory of poetic expression, the study of symbolism and the meaning of literary epochs. BousoÃ±o has always been a bridge between different generations of writers. From a position of fine sensitivity, he has always encouraged the youngest Spanish poetry."
