(Seville, April 26, 1898-Madrid, December 14, 1984). Poet belonging to the Generation of 27, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1977.\n\nHis childhood passes between Malaga and Madrid. He studies Law and Commerce, and for a few years he is a professor at the Madrid School of Commerce, specializing in Commercial Law.\n\nHis friendship with Dámaso Alonso and his literary concerns led him to read and study the great poets of universal literature, such as Bécquer and Rubén Darío. He suffers from a serious illness and during his recovery he dedicates himself to writing poetry that is published in the most important cultural magazines of the time, achieving great success. There he begins his friendship with the other components of the Generation of 27, such as Federico García Lorca and Luis Cernuda. In 1934 he receives the National Prize for Literature.\n\nAfter the Civil War he remained in Spain and his work took a very personal path. In 1949 he was appointed Academician of the Language and since then he has become a teacher and protector of young Spanish poets, who frequently come to visit him at his home in Madrid, where he frequently organizes literary gatherings.\n\nHis work is characterized by the use of metaphor and he is recognized as the main Spanish surrealist poet. It is said that his career is divided into three stages: a first of pure poetry (with influences from Juan Ramón Jiménez, Pedro Salinas and Jorge Guillén), another of surrealist poetry and a third of anthropocentric poetry.\n\nIn 1977 he received the Nobel Prize, with which his work and, in a certain way, that of the entire Generation of 27 is universally recognized. That same year he was decorated with the Grand Cross of Carlos III.\"\n\n(visit link)\n\nField of Accomplishment: LiteratureYear of Award: 1977Primary Relevant Web Site: [Web Link]Secondary Relevant Web Site: Not listed\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nVISIT LOGS\n\n1.
