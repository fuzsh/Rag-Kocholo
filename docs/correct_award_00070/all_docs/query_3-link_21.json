She was the first Latin American (and, so far, the only Latin American woman) to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which she did in 1945 “for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin American world.” Some central themes in her poems are nature, betrayal, love, a mother’s love, sorrow and recovery, travel, and Latin American identity as formed from a mixture of Native American and European influences.\n\nPablo Neruda, Literature, 1971\n\nPablo Neruda was the pen name and, later, legal name of the Chilean poet-diplomat and politician Neftali Ricardo Reyes Basoalto (July 12, 1904 – September 23, 1973).

This was a plan intended to promote democracy and peace on the Central American isthmus during a time of great turmoil. With the support of Arias, the various armed conflicts ended within the decade (Guatemala’s civil war finally ended in 1996).\n\nGuatemala\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias, Literature, 1967\n\nMiguel Angel Asturias Rosales (October 19, 1899 – June 9, 1974) was a Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan poet-diplomat, novelist, playwright and journalist.

Simms (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1973), p. 249.\n\nAlfonso García Robles, Peace, 1982\n\nAlfonso García Robles (20 March 1911 – 2 September 1991) was a Mexican diplomat and politician who, in conjunction with Sweden’s Alva Myrdal, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.
