        "text": "AKA Vicente Pío Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo\n\nBorn: 26-Apr-1898\n\nBirthplace: Sevilla, Spain\n\nDied: 14-Dec-1984\n\nLocation of death: Madrid, Spain\n\nCause of death: Tuberculosis\n\nRemains: Buried, Cemetery of the Almudena, Madrid, Spain\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: Hispanic\n\nOccupation: Poet\n\nNationality: Spain\n\nExecutive summary: Spanish surrealist poet\n\nVicente Aleixandre studied and taught law before chronic tuberculosis ended that career. An invalid for the rest of his life, he wrote dozens of books of Spanish-language poems. He said he was influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, and his work has been described as metaphysical, surrealist, and existentialist. Unable to flee the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39, he made it clear in several published poems that he opposed the right-wing dictator Francisco Franco, and for this his writings were banned by Franco.\n\nAleixandre won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1977, but was too ill with kidney and heart ailments to attend the ceremonies. After receiving his Nobel honors, several collections of his poems were translated and published in English. He never married, rarely left his home, and lingered for months in a coma before his death in 1984. Of his sickness, he said, \"Hours of solitude, hours of creation, hours of meditation. Solitude and meditation gave me an awareness, a perspective which I have never lost: that of solidarity with the rest of mankind.\"\n\nFather: (railway engineer)\n\nHigh School: Teresiano College (1913)\n\nLaw School: University of Madrid (1920)\n\nTeacher: Business Law, University of Madrid (1920-21)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1977\n\nComa 1984\n\nRisk Factors: Tuberculosis\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nÁmbito (1928)\n\nEspadas Como Labios (1932)\n\nPasión de la Tierra (1935)\n\nLa Destrucción o el Amor (1935)\n\nSombra del paraíso (1944)\n\nEn la Vida del Poeta (1950)\n\nMundo a Solas (1950)\n\nPoemas Paradisíacos (1952)\n\nNacimiento Último (1953)\n\nHistoria del Corazón (1954)\n\nAlgunos Caracteres de la Nueva Poesía Española (1955)\n\nMis Poemas Mejores (1956)\n\nLos Encuentros (1958)\n\nPoesías Completas (1960)\n\nPoemas Amorosos (1960)\n\nAntigua Casa Madrileña (1961)\n\nPicasso (1961)\n\nEn un Vasto Dominio (1962)\n\nPresencias (1965)\n\nRetratos con Nombre (1965)\n\nDos Vidas (1967)\n\nPoemas de la Consumación (1968)\n\nObras Completas (1968)\n\nAntología del Mar y de la Noche (1971)\n\nPoesía Superrealista (1971)\n\nSonido de la Guerra (1972)\n\nDiálogos del Conocimiento (1974)\n\nAntología Total (1975)\n\nThe Cave of Night (1976)\n\nAntología Poetíca (1977)\n\nDestruction or Love (1977)\n\nTwenty Poems (1977)\n\nA Longing for the Light (1979)\n\nThe Crackling Sun (1981)\n\nA Bird of Paper (1982)\n\nWorld Alone (1982)\n\nAleixandre Para Ninos (1984)\n\nLos Cuadernos de Velintonia (1986, published posthumously)\n\nEpistolario (1986, published posthumously)\n\nNuevos Poémas Varios (1987, published posthumously)\n\nShadow of Paradise (1987, published posthumously)\n\nProsas Recobradas (1987, published posthumously)\n\nLo Mejor de Vicente Aleixandre (1989, published posthumously)\n\nEn Gran Noche: Ultimos Poemas (1991, published posthumously)\n\nMire los Muros (1991, published posthumously)\n\nDiá Logos del Conocimiento (1992, published posthumously)\n\nMundo a Solas (1998, published posthumously)\n\nPoemas de la Consumación (1998, published posthumously)\n\nDestruction or Love (2000, published posthumously)\n\nCorrespondencia a la Generación del 27 (19281984) (2001, published posthumously)\n\nPoesías Completas (2001, published posthumously)\n\nProsas Completas (2002, published posthumously)\n\nCartas de Vicente Aleixandre a José Antonio Muñoz Rojas (19371984) (2005, published posthumously)\n\nAntología de la poesía oral traumática, cósmica y tanática de Vicente Aleixandre (2005, published posthumously)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
