        "text": "On Thursday 6 October the Nobel Prize in Literature 1977 was awarded to 79-year-old Spanish poet Vicente Aleixandre. The author, living in Madrid, was overcome with emotion when he heard the news. He said that he was very surprised, as he had been nominated several times before. He added that when he saw the press reports excluding him from the front-runners that year, he was not disturbed."
