        "text": "The Persona of a Nobel\n\nHis accomplishments number many:\n\n1935 National Award for Spanish Literature\n\n1977 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\ncountless memberships to literary academies,\n\nother accolades bestowed upon Vicente Aleixandre’s name\n\nin biographies and across the academy,\n\nbut hardly a mention outside of Spain.\n\nWho was this housebound man?\n\nA lover of all things human and divine,\n\nthe voice of a generation but whose own truth\n\nrang hollow in the annals of history\n\nlest his parents discover the authenticity\n\nof his closeted sexuality.\n\nHe entered an internal exile with his poetry,\n\nwhile the war and illnesses immobilized him,\n\nand bombs rained down on Velintonia.\n\nGone are his prized books and ephemera,\n\nlocked away are his manuscripts.\n\nWe are left with a shell of a person(a),\n\na half-glimpsed life in the service of his muse.\n\nTo translate him into English\n\nrequires showing up not just for the harried\n\nreporters clamoring for a taste of his writing,\n\nbut bringing across his personality and wisdom\n\nacross time and oceans through translation.\n\nTranslation requires dislocation, a disjuncture of jaws\n\nas one tongue yields to another to form a new text\n\nthat awakens Aleixandre’s rendering of our place\n\nin the cosmos, a union with nature.\n\nAleixandre writes for everyone,\n\neven those who cannot read his work in Spanish,\n\neven those who don’t know about the magic of Velintonia 3;\n\nhe is the consummate mentor and friend of\n\npast prosodies and future tributes."
