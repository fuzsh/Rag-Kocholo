        "text": "Flashback Friday: Dancing with the Stars Season 3\n\nAnd I‚Äôm back finally, with another Flashback Friday! I hadn‚Äôt meant to take as long a break as I did, but my dad died unexpectedly 10 days before Christmas (and just 2 months after we lost my mom!) so my final preparations for Christmas needed to wait. I had to stop and think where we left off! Here‚Äôs season 1 and season 2.\n\nSo here we go, on to season 3, the first one I watched. Not many changes this season, same 3 judges, same 2 hosts. They did expand the season to 10 weeks, however.\n\nAnother change is to the scoring system that they used, I am quoting from wiki here, and will ask Miss Heidi if this is how it‚Äôs done now?\n\nFor this season, the scoring system was changed. Fan vote only counted for 25% of the total score and scoring was now translated directly from percentages rather than into ordinals. The judges scores were added up, and each performer was given points based on the percentage of the total points distributed among all performers. (For example, a team received a score of 25. A total of 207 points were awarded to all nine performers. The team received 12.08% of that total, so that team earned 12.08 points. The couple happens to be Sara & Tony.) The fan vote was handled the same way, with the points based on how much of the total fan vote the star received. (So, in the same example, if the team earned 15% of the total fan vote, their grand total is 27.08 points.)[\n\nAndrea Hale, Jonathan Roberts and Anna Trebunskaya did not compete as pros during this season. Elena Grinenko, Kym Johnson, Karina Smirnoff and Jesse DeSoto joined as new pros. Returning pros included Ashly DelGrosso, Nick Kosovich, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Tony Dovolani, Louis Van Amstel, Edyta Sliwinska and Cheryl Burke.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON AND ELENA GRINENKO came in 11th place, being eliminated on week 1 on September 13, 2006. They performed a cha cha cha, otherwise known as the Curse of the Chair dance, and received a score of 12.\n\nSHANNA MOAKLER AND JESSE DE SOTO came in 10th place, being eliminated on week 2 on September 20, 2006. They peformed a foxtrot and a mambo. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt remember them at all, so I guess it‚Äôs not surprising that they went home early. To my very untrained eyes, I think their mambo was good, and seemed to have some good choreography, but it just isn‚Äôt memorable. Here‚Äôs their mambo, they received a score of 22.

We‚Äôll keep this post stuck to the main page until the cast announcement, and we‚Äôll post updates in red as they come in.\n\nETA #1: Updated with coverage of Joey Fatone & Trista Sutter, and an update of Ralph Macchio.\n\nETA #2: Added info on Kelly Monaco.\n\nETA #3: Update on Maria Menounos.\n\nETA #4: A little over 24 hours until the cast announcement and updates & rumors coming fast & furious! Thanks Vogue & Heidi :-)Updates on Gilles Marini, Joey Fatone, Melissa Rycroft, Stacy Keibler, Kendra Wilkinson, & Carson Kressley; added info on Melissa Joan-Hart & Pamela Anderson.\n\nSeason 1:\n\nTrista Sutter ‚Äì a few interesting tweets that seemed to imply she was heading somewhere to do something secret, but now says she is definitely not taking part in the all-star season üôÅ\n\nKelly Monaco ‚Äì hinted at a GH fan event that she was ‚Äúgoing to need fans‚Äô help with something that‚Äôs getting announced next Friday!‚Äù\n\nSeason 2:\n\nStacy Keibler ‚Äì played coy, said ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù if she was asked to return; says we‚Äôll ‚Äúhave to wait & find out‚Äù; rumored as a possible X-Factor host; Entertainment Weekly claiming she‚Äôs not likely to do the show\n\nDrew Lachey ‚Äì said he ‚Äúhad a blast and would be open to doing it again‚Äù, but wasn‚Äôt sure how things would play out\n\nSeason 3:\n\nJerry Springer ‚Äì said he may do SOMETHING for the show and would love to be in the audience, but wouldn‚Äôt dance again\n\nMario Lopez ‚Äì spilled the beans about being asked to do the all-star season on Live with Kelly way back in May, and was thinking about it; however, he now says he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be able to do it‚Äù ‚Äì mentioned as a rumored candidate to host X-factor\n\nJoey Lawrence ‚Äì asked fans on Twitter to vote for him to get on the all-star season\n\nSeason 4:\n\nJoey Fatone ‚Äì says he isn‚Äôt really sure if he‚Äôd do it or not, and that he hasn‚Äôt gotten a call yet; Entertainment Weekly claiming he‚Äôs ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to do the show Read more..\n\nShare this:\n\nKym Johnson Dishes On Her Dancing Career, Mr. Right, The DWTS Las Vegas Show, And More!\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has a cool article up about Kym Johnson. She discusses how her dancing career began. Did you know that if dancing didn‚Äôt turn out, she was going into ‚Äúhospitality‚Äù? Also, Kym use to make extra money decorating dresses when she was 21. Kym also talks a little about her Dancing With The Stars partners and finding Mr. Right someday at the link.\n\nI started ballet lessons when I was three. My brother, Trevor, asked for ballroom lessons because a girl he liked was in the class. I was a ballet snob and didn‚Äôt think it was real dancing until I went along and saw how amazing it was. I joined his class at 13 and continued when he stopped.\n\nMy parents split up when I was 18. I was going to move to London at the time, but I stayed in Australia to comfort my mum. She said I needed something to fall back on if dance didn‚Äôt turn out, so I enrolled in a hospitality course.\n\nI moved to England at 21. I worked in a hotel, took dance classes in the afternoons and decorated dresses at night for extra money. I became really good at it. Most people don‚Äôt know we design our own costumes on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nI don‚Äôt know why celebrities put themselves through DWTS ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard! When I was asked to audition for the Aussie version, I thought, will Australia go for ballroom dancing? I took the job because it was a chance to settle in Sydney.\n\nI had the best time dancing with [actor] Justin Melvey. We‚Äôre still friends. I stayed at his place when I first moved to Hollywood.\n\nJerry Springer is like a father figure to me. He was my first partner on the US version of DWTS, in 2006. We still keep in touch. Donny Osmond, whom I won with, was adorable.\n\nDavid Arquette is a great guy, but he‚Äôs a worrier. When we were dance partners last year, he was very open about the tough time he had during his split from Courteney Cox.\n\nAlso, Kym was a guest on The Morning Blend in Las Vegas Friday to promote her dancing at the Tropicana Dancing With The Stars Live show. You can view the interview HERE. She talks about dancing with Carson Kressley and how he leads her. LOL! She has some thoughts about Season 14 and the finals. They also show a recent interview with Jerry Springer who shared some words on Kym. Love this‚Ä¶a must see if you are a fan to Kym!\n\nPicture above is of Kym attending the opening night of ‚ÄòChicago‚Äô in Hollywood on May 16th courtesy of Zimbio Pictures.\n\nShare this:\n\nDWTS Celebrities: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, I‚Äôm a Ringer?‚Äù Part 3\n\nThis is the 3rd and final part of the series where I take a look at the partners the pros have had and their ‚Äúringer‚Äù status. Part 1 discusses how I define a ringer ‚Äì you can find it here ‚Äî> I‚Äôm a Ringer?? Part 2 discusses the female pros and their partners and how I labeled them ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that they‚Äôve not been quite as blessed as the men. Reasons for that should be self evident ‚Äì female celebrities are more likely to have some sort of dance experience, even if it is taking ballet or tap as a child. NOTE: This was mostly written before the pairings were announced for Season 14 ‚Äì those pairings certainly change the game for lots of pros. Lots of potential ringers on this season.\n\nI strongly recommend you read the first two parts before you comment ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to have to reiterate everything I wrote MONTHS ago. üôÇ Also, be wise and don‚Äôt complain about the length, admit that you didn‚Äôt read it all, and then argue with me ‚Äì that will just earn you scorn and an eye roll. I know this is long ‚Äì I considered breaking it into two parts, but then I figured it‚Äôs still long in two parts. People will either be interested or they won‚Äôt. :::shrug::: Also take note that I, personally, don‚Äôt care about ringers themselves. I think a season without them is deadly. What I DO care about is hypocrisy, revisionist history and the fairy tales that some like to spread about who has had ringers and who hasn‚Äôt.\n\nFrom where I sit, there are two types of ringers ‚Äì and then there‚Äôs just being blessed. Fanbase ringer (ie. Donny Osmond, etc.) or Experience Ringer (Mel B, Nicole, Sabrina, etc.), and lucky get (Lalia, Brooke, Gilles, JR). Just because someone happens to be a great dancer doesn‚Äôt mean they are a ringer. When someone is blessed with a partner who can dance, it doesn‚Äôt mean they were handed a ringer. That particular argument is so illogical that it‚Äôs hard for me to take seriously. If they actually seriously auditioned people to be on this show by making them dance with a pro for an hour or two, it would be understandable. But they don‚Äôt stand people in a room with a pro dancer and then say, ‚Äúwow, she‚Äôs got some moves, let‚Äôs give her to Maks‚Äù or ‚Äúshe sucks, lets give her to Tony.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt work that way. If it did, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get people on the show. And can you imagine a pro like Tony sticking around if that was the approach they took?\n\nAs it happens, and as many people connected to the show have reiterated, the process of how a pro gets a celebrity often has to do with height, personality, looks, chemistry and the cast as a whole‚Ä¶and this becomes obvious as the show progresses. They are actually quite good at matching people up. I would imagine they give this a lot of consideration as it impacts, or has the potential to impact, ratings. You‚Äôre going to try to avoid having a bunch of pairings that make people go ‚Äúeeewww‚Äù or get seriously pissed off. I think you need to limit that to one couple per season. Can you imagine what it would be like for every pro on a season to have a partnership similar to that of Hope and Maks?? I would want to stab my eyes out with a fork if they were ALL like that and there was no Carson/Anna or David/Kym. Seriously ‚Äì think about it. So, it may be good to have ONE Maks/Hope ‚Äì gives people (me and Courtney) something to talk about, rant about, get passionate about, etc. (This is separate from a discussion of whether Maks finally went too far or not ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the producers intended.)

Who‚Äôs pumped??? I know I am‚Ä¶but we‚Äôve still got a few hours left to speculate, so let‚Äôs see what other cast types we‚Äôve to fill this season, shall we? üòâ For those of you that may have missed it, check out part I as well.\n\nThe Teen Idol\n\nPrevious examples: Joey McIntyre, Aaron Carter, Donny Osmond, Lance Bass, Mel B., Joey Fatone, Drew Lachey, Joey Lawrence, Ian Ziering, Cody Linley, Sabrina Bryan, Mario Lopez, Kyle Massey, Chelsea Kane, Romeo\n\nAdvantages: If sales of Tiger Beat are any indicator, the teenyboppers will come out in full force to support their favorite heartthrobs/idols. Being young & good-lookin‚Äô sure doesn‚Äôt hurt! Many also have the added advantage of having a decent dance background, especially if they were part of a musical act.\n\nDisadvantages: Youth can also have its disadvantages ‚Äì as in immaturity. What some might call ‚Äúyouthful exuberance‚Äù, others might call ‚Äúimmaturity‚Äù or ‚Äúattention deficit disorder‚Äù ‚Äì poor Cody Linley had a hard time sitting still! Emotional immaturity (a la Aaron Carter‚Äôs post-rumba meltdown in the confessional) can be especially off-putting. They‚Äôve also got to contend with the large middle-aged female contingent of viewers/voters ‚Äì they far outnumber the young viewers likely to vote for them.\n\nPossible candidates this season: There‚Äôs that random Nicole Anderson chick that‚Äôs a friend of Chelsea Kane‚Äôs, and Heidi found some compelling evidence that rapper Darnell Robinson may be participating this season.\n\nThe Host\n\nPrevious examples: Jerry Springer, Brooke Burke, Leeza Gibbons, Mario Lopez, Kenny Mayne, Lisa Rinna, Tucker Carlson, Mark Dacascos, Rocco DiSpirito, Erin Andrews, Wendy Williams, Mike Catherwood, Carson Kressley, Nancy Grace, Ricki Lake\n\nAdvantages: Being that they‚Äôve been at the helm of their own shows, these guys usually have the media savvy & charisma to appeal to the masses, as well as the previous exposure & recognizability. Most (not all!) are also decently attractive, which never seems to hurt (unless, of course, you‚Äôre a model ‚Äì see previous post for explanation).\n\nDisadvantages: Many hosts are only used to hosting ‚Äì as in just sitting down & talking (or dodging the occasional punch, if you‚Äôre Springer), so the lack of movement experience problem seems to come into play.\n\nPossible candidates this season: This category seems to have EXPLODED with possibilities this season ‚Äì the most solid of which being Sherri Shepherd, who was caught leaving the DWTS studio the other day. I‚Äôm still wondering if someone fr0m GMA is part of the cast this season, since they all seemed to act so coy when announcing they‚Äôd be revealing the cast. And then we have the Maria Menounos rumor as well.\n\nThe Actor\n\nPrevious examples: John O‚ÄôHurley, Melissa Joan Hart, Steve Guttenburg, John Ratzenberger, Debi Mazar, Denise Richards, Ted McGinley, Shannon Elizabeth, Jennie Garth, Vivica Fox, Marissa Jaret Winokur, Shannen Doherty, Jennifer Grey, David Hasselhoff, Ralph Macchio, Kirstie Alley, David Arquette\n\nAdvantages: Being that their bread & butter is acting, most can usually nail the emotions of the dances. Bonus points if they‚Äôve done any Broadway (like Winokur) because they have likely had dance experience.\n\nDisadvantages: For lack of a better term, many of them seem to be ‚Äúhas-beens‚Äù ‚Äì actors that haven‚Äôt been particularly active in the mainstream in the past several years ‚Äì or were never that big to begin with (can anyone else think of anything John O‚ÄôHurley has been in BESIDES Seinfeld?), making it harder for them to garner votes from a public who may not remember them.\n\nPossible candidates this season: We‚Äôve got Melissa Gilbert & Ryan O‚ÄôNeal, of course, but nothing really beyond that.\n\nThe Reality Star\n\nPrevious examples: Kim Kardashian, Kelly Osbourne, Melissa Rycroft, Steve-O, Holly Madison, Trista Sutter, Shanna Moakler, Kate Gosselin, Jake Pavelka, Audrina Patridge, The Situation, Rob Kardashian, Kristin Cavallari\n\nAdvantages: Many have achieved pop culture icon status on their respective reality outlets, making them fairly recognizable.\n\nDisadvantages: They may be memorable for the wrong reasons ‚Äì people tended to remember things like Kim Kardashian‚Äôs sex tape more than her reality show when she was on DWTS, and people seemed more focused on Holly Madison‚Äôs split from Hef than her antics on The Girls Next Door. Many can also come across as attention-hungry & talentless(*cough*JakePavelka*cough*) ‚Äì reality TV is often looked down upon as a way to get famous without having any talent whatsoever.\n\nPossible candidates this season: Lots of talk about Ali Fedotowsky, who suspiciously moved to LA last week.\n\nThe Singer:\n\nPrevious examples: Mya, Billy Ray Cyrus, Mario, Belinda Carlisle, Master P, Chuck Wicks, Sara Evans, Willa Ford, Monique Coleman, Toni Braxton, Macy Gray, Nicole Scherzinger, Chynna Phillips\n\nAdvantages: As with the teen idols, many have had dance experience concurrent with their music careers.\n\nDisadvantages: Most seem to be committed solely to one genre of music (often R&B or country), making it hard to appeal to a wide fanbase.\n\nPossible candidates this season: Lots of loose lips at the Grammys about Gavin DeGraw, but it seems like less of a possibility now, considering that he is about to go on tour.\n\nThe Wild Card\n\nPrevious examples: Heather Mills, Tom DeLay, Mark Cuban, Steve Wozniak, Priscilla Presley, Buzz Aldrin, Bristol Palin, Chaz Bono\n\nAdvantages: The sheer novelty of having someone with such an off-the-beaten-path claim to fame (famous divorcee/widow, entrepreneur, disgraced politician, etc.) may be enough to have the public voting them ‚Äì just to see what happens. Being the ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù is a powerful thing‚Ä¶as we saw with Bristol in season 11!\n\nDisadvantages: Due to their often dubious fame, people just may not have any clue who they are ‚Äì I personally had to Google Mark Cuban‚Äôs name. There‚Äôs also the risk of backlash from some viewers who don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ‚Äústars‚Äù per se, and shouldn‚Äôt even be on the show in the first place.\n\nPossible candidates this season: Surprisingly, not too many outlandish rumors‚Ä¶especially since Herman Cain & Michelle Bachman have denied they‚Äôre doing the show. Phew!\n\nSo we‚Äôre getting down to the wire, kids‚Ä¶any last-minute predictions before the big reveal? üòâ\n\nShare this:\n\nDWTS Celebrities: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, I‚Äôm a Ringer?‚Äù Part 2\n\nThis is Part 2 in what will likely be a 3-part series. If you want to read Part 1, you can find it here ‚Äî> I‚Äôm a Ringer??\n\nWell, let me tell you, researching these former contestants was not particularly enjoyable. But, I felt like some research had to go into this in order to try to be somewhat informed and to remove some of the subjectivity. Not all of it can be removed, but I tried.\n\nHow did I get my results?\n\nFor each celebrity who was *possibly* experienced or popular, I focused research on their web sites (if available), their Wiki pages, and YouTube videos. Then there were google searches. Yikes. If a celebrity was clearly not a ringer in any way shape or form (ie Football players, rodeo riders, race car drivers) I did not look into their background any further. I did spend some time on this, but since I have another job that takes my time, it‚Äôs possible I missed something. üôÇ BUT, just because you don‚Äôt agree with my rankings, it doesn‚Äôt mean I DID miss something. Just sayin‚Äô. üôÇ\n\nDetermining if someone is actually a fanbase ringer is rather difficult as well. My metric for that determination is: Is this person well known and well loved by the biggest DWTS demographic ‚Äì that is women aged about 30 to 65. These are the people most likely to watch the show and vote. Where it gets tricky is guys like Joey Lawrence and Ian Zeiring ‚Äì it‚Äôs guys like this that caused me the most pain. Why? Well, because my brain is saying, ‚ÄúNah‚Äù but my gut is saying ‚ÄúJust because you‚Äôre not a fan doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have sizable fanbases. üôÇ So, at the end of the day, I decided for my purposes that for them to be a fanbase ringer, it had to be OBVIOUS. That is ‚Äì if I know they‚Äôre super popular, then they probably really are. If I don‚Äôt really know much about them‚Ä¶.then they probably aren‚Äôt. I fit the demographic, after all. üôÇ Read more..\n\nShare this:"
