Her hands skimmed across windowsills and door frames; ensuring there was no trace of dirt in sight.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of cleaning, Zendaya decided it was time to work on herself rather than the house. She clambered out of her baggy sweatshirt and Val’s sweatpants, letting the clothes drop to the floor aimlessly. With her hands planted firmly across her hips, she looked ahead at her rather large closet. All of her clothes had been arranged chronologically, from colour to the time the item had been brought and the season it was intended to be worn in.\n\nZendaya had so much free time upon her hands; she was able to do such time and effort consuming tasks.\n\nHer hazel eyes skimmed at the various wracks and piles of clothes. Her husband, Val Chmerkovskiy, and some of his work friends and their wives were gathering in the couple’s suburban Californian home for dinner. The date had been arranged for around a week and Zendaya had spent the whole week idly worrying about making first impressions on Val’s friends. She had never met them before – since her and Val had only had a court marriage - and she was genuinely intrigued to be meeting with women her own age – or relatively close to her age.\n\nSince Zendaya had gotten into a relationship with Val, she had lost all of the relationships that she had held previously. Neither Zendaya’s friends nor her family approved of Val – they all believed something was off about him – and they therefore drifted away from her. Last Zendaya had heard, her parents had moved back to their small home in Oakland and her childhood best friend, Deja, had opened her own dance studio for under-privileged children. The thought of not being involved in Deja’s and her parents’ lives killed Zendaya, it really did, but she loved Val.\n\nAnd, nobody understood that.\n\nVal was perfect for her. Unlike the other men she had been with, Val treated Zendaya like she was the most beautiful thing in the world. He wasn’t ashamed to hold her hand in public and he loved showering her with all the love he could physically give. There was never a day when Zendaya worried about money or about the bills, like she did when in other relationships. Val was happy to provide for his wife and he was glad he was able to. He absolutely adored Zendaya and he wanted to give her the best. That meant the best clothes, the best home, and the best furniture: everything money could buy.\n\nOakland born, Zendaya Coleman had never imagined herself living in such luxurious circumstances and she couldn’t be more grateful that she had met Val.\n\nShe was extremely grateful to have married the man.\n\nZendaya reluctantly leaned forward, her hand latching onto a dress that she knew Val liked on her. It was a white dress that was adorned with pink roses and their green buds. The simplistic, kitsch dress had spaghetti straps and flew out into a puffy skirt at the waist. The dress stopped at Zendaya’s knees, accentuating her lengthy legs. Zendaya slipped into the dress and paired it with a pair of ballet flats; in heels she was taller than Val. With a last glance in the mirror, she glided down the stairs of her five-bedroom home and towards the kitchen.\n\nVal had made it clear that his wife didn’t need to work. He was more than happy to be the breadwinner and Zendaya had decided that, that was the best thing for her. Yes, she had, had her own dreams of making it big within the acting scene but in all honesty, it was a wide shot. Show business was a difficult career path and Zendaya really wasn’t good at anything other than entertaining people. So, Zendaya became a house-wife. She cooked and she cleaned and she made sure everything was perfectly in order when her husband got back from work. Soon enough, Zendaya would also be taking care of child-care, for she was in her first trimester; expecting hers and Val’s first child.\n\nAbsentmindedly, Zendaya ran her hand across her flat stomach. She was only a few weeks pregnant – she had found out the night before – and she was ecstatic. Her happiness was easily visible across her features and Zendaya couldn’t help but feel giddy at the fact that she was going to be telling Val tonight. She was going to tell Val about them starting a family and Zendaya couldn’t help but envision his expression. Val had always been a family man; he was still very close to his brother, Maks, and his parents who all lived in Burgen, New York. And, she was sure his joy was going to mirror hers as soon as he heard the news.\n\nZendaya squatted down a little, her face eye level with the oven to ensure that her pie was cooking properly. On the counter top, a cheese board had been freshly decorated and a bowl of salad was sitting, ready to be spun when guests arrived.\n\nEverything was running smoothly and Zendaya grinned at herself, the excitement bubbling within her.\n\nShe glanced over at the granddad clock that sat in the kitchen, its arms indicating to her that she still had thirty minutes worth of free time until Val was scheduled to come home with his colleagues and their families. Zendaya looked around, triple-checking that everything was okay before a knock came at her front door. At first, the knock was a soft rasp but then the knocks grew violent. The doorbell – a high pitched ding – was pressed continuously and Zendaya threw her oven cloth across the island top so that she could answer the door. Using her hands, she smoothed out her dress and she swiped the loose strands of her curly hair behind her ear.\n\nMaybe Val was home early?\n\nZendaya’s hand pulled at the door knob and a smile plastered across her face as she anticipated a warm embrace and a lingering kiss from her husband.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t Val at the door.\n\nIt was police officers, three of them.\n\n“Is Mr Chmerkovskiy home?” One of the officers asked gruffly, looking Zendaya up and down stiffly. His expression was stern and rigid and immediate panic fizzled through Zendaya. The hulk-like male looked down at a notepad in his hand whilst the others eyed Zendaya curiously. Their gazes were intimidating and Zendaya avoided their gazes as she answered with a simple, no. “Is it okay for us to come inside, ma’am?” The officer asked respectfully and Zendaya nodded, stepping aside to let all the officers – two males and one female – into her home.\n\nShe internally winced as they dredged mud onto her squeaky clean floorboards.\n\nZendaya led the officers into the living room, ushering for them all to be seated. They all took seats quietly, their eyes flittering between one another; everybody stayed silent until Zendaya clasped her hands together and spoke.\n\n“Is everything okay, Sir?” She directed the question at the officer who had spoken to her earlier. The large golden badge upon his uniform signalled to Zendaya that he had more authority compared to the other two officers, a deputy, maybe?\n\n“Can you state your relation to Valentin Chmerkovskiy, miss?” He asked, hiccupping on Zendaya’s marital last name; it was always one that made people stumble.\n\n“I am his wife, Zendaya.” Zendaya answered, gulping down the lump that had formed at the back of her throat. The mucus was adamant and refused to move like a truck stuck in Canadian snow. Zendaya hesitated as she looked the officer in the eye. She was unsure of what was going on and she let her back rest against the white painted walls, silently demanding an explanation.\n\n“We weren’t aware he was married,” The officer muttered to his colleagues but Zendaya heard it well enough. The officer’s looked between one another before the male continued, “My name is Officer Beatty, that’s Officer Linda and her understudy, Michael.” The officer – Officer Beatty – pointed at the other two in the room and Zendaya smiled at them weakly, trying to grin as much as she physically could. “We’re the deputy team from the Calabasas police department and we’ve been working on a case about a local gang.” Officer Beatty explained and Zendaya listened to him quietly. She was genuinely curious to what Officer Beatty’s story had to do with her and Val. “For the past few years, the town has been over-run by violent and dangerous street crime. The crime that is being conducted isn’t minor crime: large sums of cash go missing, people are shot or severely injured for invading territory, women and children are kidnapped as ransom and public property is destroyed to an unfixable state. Our officers have been tracking down these crimes but those that are involved are either scared to admit or reveal information about what is going on and those in charge of these crimes are cunningly clever; it’s been virtually impossible for us to collect any evidence.”\n\nZendaya had grown up in a rough area in Oakland and street crime was a regular when she was younger. But, when she’d grown older and moved away from her home town, she thought she had heard the last of such violent behaviour. The thought of such things taking place so close to her, scared her. “We have never been able to collect solid proof but we’ve been following possible suspects. People who are constantly seen in the neighbourhood around the time when criminal offences take place, people who have previous records, that kind of thing.” Officer Beatty froze for a few seconds before speaking again. “We have evidence to suggest that your … husband, is the one in charge of this deviant behaviour.”\n\nAll emotion dropped from Zendaya’s face as she stared at the officer deliriously.\n\nThe officer must have gotten something wrong. Val couldn’t be a gang leader. Zendaya knew, for a fact, that Val ran his own event management firm. Zendaya had seen all of the magazines and the snippets that Val brought home after work. She had seen him stress over particular events that entailed Val’s complete devotion. Zendaya had been there whilst Val called up suppliers and clients about chocolate fountains and seating arrangements.\n\nThere was no way her husband was a criminal, but, Zendaya couldn’t help but let the tears spring to her eyes.\n\nThe officer was most definitely wrong. “Usually, in such cases, family members are heavily involved in the business,” Officer Linda – the female – looked at Zendaya warily. Her eyes were the size of saucers as she silently accused Zendaya of something she hadn’t done. “Or they are completely oblivious-“\n\n“Or stupid.” Officer Linda looked Zendaya up and down, sneering at her ditsy looking outfit and her perfect home. She had met so many women like Zendaya. The type who did not have to lift a finger and were given everything they ever wanted. It made Officer Linda sick to know that she was out in the real world, working her butt off for an honest living, whilst women like Zendaya were stealing from others and living off of stolen money. It was sickening, to say the least.\n\n“Zendaya, take a seat, it’s mandatory for us to ask you a few questions.”\n\n“I … I … I don’t know what’s going on.” Zendaya stuttered as she stumbled on over to the couch. Her finger nails gripped at the leather sofa as she steadied herself before taking a seat. The plush material engulfed Zendaya’s skinny frame but, unlike it usually did, the couch wasn’t able to provide her with comfort. Zendaya’s butt hung off the couch as she sat forward, nodding for the officer to continue.\n\n“All will be explained, Mrs Chmerkovskiy, just let us ask you a few questions.”\n\nOfficer Beatty had conducted these kinds of interviews all the time and after being in the work field for twelve years, he was sure he was a pretty great judge of character. Never had his suspicions been proved wrong and from what he could see from Zendaya’s surprised emotions and her silent tears; she had truly been oblivious to her husband’s wrong doings. “Okay,” Officer Beatty looked over at Michael who had pressed play to a tape recorder that was later going to be used as Zendaya’s defence. “Now, can you state your full name, please?”\n\n“Zendaya Maree Coleman-Chmerkovskiy.” Zendaya’s voice had lowered in volume and Michael shuffled a little forward with the recorder.\n\n“And, you are married to Mr Chmerkovskiy?” Zendaya answered with a yes and Officer Beatty skipped to the next question. “How long have you been married? And, how did you two first meet?”\n\n“Val and I only got married a few months ago, it was a small wedding, but we’ve been together, as a couple, for four years. I first met Val at the airport, I was on my way to New York for my niece’s graduation and Val was going to visit his brother, Maks. We were seated next to one another on the plane.” Officer Beatty scribbled down onto his notepad before returning to his interrogation.\n\n“You said you had a small wedding? Why? You live in one of the priciest zip codes in the country, you could easily afford a big wedding.” Zendaya looked down at her hands, the tears pooling in her eyes as she thought back to her wedding day. It had been a juxtaposition of emotions on that day. She had been the happiest woman alive because she was marrying the man she loved but it had also upset her dearly because her parents hadn’t been there to experience her happiness.\n\n“My family and my friends didn’t approve of my relationship with Val and they didn’t want to be a part of our wedding. Val and I had decided that our love was worth more than what money could buy and so, we had a small marriage at the registry office. His parents were our witnesses.”\n\nOfficer Beatty looked up at Zendaya, genuinely surprised by her answer. This girl had gone against everybody that she loved for this one man.\n\nOfficer Beatty, who was married himself, felt sorry for Zendaya.\n\nFrom what he could see, she seemed to be pretty truthful and if she was in fact, telling the truth, she was going to lose everything that she had. Her home would get repossessed by the local bank, all of her possessions would be sold to repay the money that Val and his men had stolen and Zendaya would have no one to go to or nothing to live off.\n\nShe was doomed.\n\n“Did Valentin ever seem suspicious to you? Would he come home late with empty excuses? Have you ever found anything that you’ve never been able to explain logically? Did you ever doubt he was cheating on you or whether he was up to no good?”\n\n“No, Sir.” Zendaya answered truthfully. “Val was and has always been perfectly … predictable. He’s always home on time, he spent some of his weekends away with some of his friends but other than that, Val was at work and then at home.”\n\n“These trips away from home, who did he go with? Do you have the full names of those who accompanied him?”\n\n“Ermm,” Zendaya thought carefully, trying to remember Val’s friends’ last names. “I remember a few, ermm … his best friend, Alex Sander, was always on those trips, Jonathan Platero, Serge Onik, I think his name is, Teddy Volynets and I think his brother, Val’s brother, Maksim went on a few of these trips as well.” Officer Beatty looked over at Officer Linda knowingly. These were the names of the men that had popped up on their radar. The police department had also been doing background checks on these men.\n\n“And, what did they do on these trips?”\n\n“I’m not sure,” Zendaya shrugged. “It was Val’s guy-time. I presumed they were just camping, going fishing … that kind of stuff. It was just care-free time that he spent with his friends; I didn’t really impose on his privacy and ask what they got up to. I trusted Val and-“\n\n“Trusted? As in past tense?” Officer Beatty was now at that point in the interview where he was prepared to dig into depths of Zendaya’s words and analyse everything that she said. It was a clever interview technique that put the interviewee on the spot so that they were subconsciously intimated to tell the truth; it was similar to hot-seating. It was the most effective way to get people to speak the truth because there wasn’t enough time for them to come up with an alibi. “So, you don’t trust Valentin anymore?”\n\n“No, I mean … yes … I … I don’t know.” This was the moment where Zendaya broke down into tears. A fountain of briny water dripped from her eyelids, smudging her mascara and she wiped at her face furiously as she tried to present herself in a presentable manner. Nothing seemed to work though because deep down, Zendaya’s conscious was telling her that the Officers were correct, her parents and her friends had been correct … They had all warned her about Val and now Zendaya was wedged into something she hadn’t anticipated, ever.\n\n“Mrs Chmerkovskiy, we’re going to need you to calm down so that we can carry on with the interrogation, can you do that for me?” Officer Beatty touched Zendaya’s hand softly but she drew her hands back slowly. He was trying to keep Zendaya as calm as possible because she hadn’t heard the worst of what her husband had been up to. Valentin Chmerkovskiy and his men were dangerous people who had ruthlessly killed and robbed and the extent of their crimes was endless. Officer Beatty wanted to get as much solid evidence as he could before arresting the Russian-born twenty-seven year old.\n\n“I … I’m sorry … it’s just … all of this … it’s, it’s sudden and I … think because of the pregnancy-“\n\n“You’re pregnant?” Officer Beatty asked surprised and Zendaya nodded. Officer Beatty rubbed at his forehead.\n\nClaiming you were pregnant or ill or mentally unstable was an excuse that many people used as an excuse. It made them look vulnerable and it made police loosen up when charging for a crime. If Officer Beatty was going to continue with the interview, he was going to need proof that Zendaya was pregnant, since she wasn’t showing yet, and a doctor was going to have to be present as the interview progressed – this was so that defence lawyers could not use psychological harm as an alibi when Officer Beatty took to Val to caught.\n\nA defence lawyer would use Zendaya like a public toilet, for their dirty work. A lawyer would try to present Val as the perfect family man and Zendaya would play a massive part in his argument. If Officer’s caused Zendaya any kind of distress, this could easily be manipulated in court and could result in Officer Beatty and Officer Linda’s jobs being terminated.\n\n“Three weeks now,” Zendaya pat her stomach lovingly, however, not as lovingly as before. It may sound cynical and Zendaya wanted to hit herself for thinking so but, somehow, within the space of moments it seemed as if the love for her unborn child had lessened. The thought of Val doing such bad things made her think twice about him, everything about him … including their child. How was she going to handle raising a child with Val? After everything she had just heard? “I found out yesterday.”\n\n“We are going to have to make you take another test, Zendaya, is that okay? Or have you been to a doctor yet?” Officer Beatty asked. “We need to ensure that you’re telling us the truth and if what you have told is true, and you are pregnant, we’re going to have a doctor come in and supervise our interview. Is that fine with you?” Officer Beatty didn’t really care if Zendaya disagreed or not, it was customary to ask her whether she was okay with it but no matter if she was or not, she was going to have to answer questions.\n\n“I … I took the test at home but I rang my gynaecologist, doctor Carmine, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Linda,” Officer Beatty looked over at the female. “Get on the phone to Doctor Carmine. Zendaya, do you have the test with you, by any chance?\"\n\nZendaya nodded, the tears were still streaming down her cheeks and her eyes had become red and puffy now. She sniffled lightly, trying to regain any sort of confidence she had before signalling for Officer Beatty to follow her towards the kitchen. Zendaya had planned to tell Val about them being pregnant that night and she had thought of the perfect way to do so. She had put her pregnancy stick into its original box and then placed it into multiple piece of packaging. The box gave the illusion that Zendaya was gifting Val with a large present but as he undid every separate layer he would get closer to the positive pregnancy stick until he finally learnt the truth … Zendaya had seen something similar take place in a movie and she thought it was the perfect way to tell, or show, Val.\n\nShe now knew that Val wasn’t going to get the present as she had intended.\n\nSadly, Zendaya handed the officer the box and he looked at her skeptically. He was a bit puzzled, why was Zendaya handing him a wrapped box?\n\n\"He doesn’t … Val doesn’t … he doesn’t know yet. I was going to tell him tonight.” Zendaya looked down at the box glumly. “It was meant to be a surprise.”\n\nThe officer looked at Zendaya sympathetically. This was one downside to his job. Working for the police force meant that those who threatened society were locked up - a plus side - but it also meant that officer Beatty was forced to watch innocent people suffer.\n\n“I am sorry, Mrs Chmerkovskiy, I really am.” Officer Beatty touched Zendaya’s shoulder. He inhaled deeply and then the faint scent of something burning enveloped his senses. His nose scrunched up as the aroma overwhelmed his senses and Zendaya did the same, her eyes suddenly flickering towards the oven. She crouched down beside the oven to see that her food had burnt to a crisp.\n\nA loud sigh escaped her lips and unexpectedly, her legs gave in from under her. She fell backwards onto the kitchen floor, her back hitting the pantry cupboard as she sobbed. The impact of her back against the oak cupboard hurt but Zendaya’s heart was breaking internally.\n\nA heartbreak was the worst pain imaginable.\n\n“E … Every … Everything’s a mess!” Zendaya pulled her legs up to her chest as she hit her head against her knees caps. “How … how did this happen?” She asked nobody in particular, her cries know seeping into her voice. Before, she had cried but she had cried silently … now, she was wailing and nobody judged her for doing so.\n\nShe was innocent after all. She had been dragged into an unfortunate situation and officer Beatty knew that he had to allow for the woman to calm down and let everything sink in. He bent over beside her, flicking the oven switch off and taking a seat next to her. His hand clasped her knee cap, giving it a little reassuring shake.\n\n“Everything’s going to be okay, miss.” He said comfortingly. “If you’ve done nothing wrong than you have nothing to worry about. You are going to be safe and healthy.\"\n\n\"Zendayachka!” A voice called from further down in the voice. A voice Zendaya recognized like her own, Val. Zendaya’s head looked up from her legs and the clock indicated to her that Val was just on time. Like always. “Babe,” His voice had a light tone to it and Zendaya heard him laugh, probably alongside one of his colleagues - or gang members.\n\nAs expected, Val wondered through the long hallway that lead from the entrance towards the kitchen, where Zendaya usually was at this time. He held his arm out so that his friends could follow him and a smile tattooed his face as he showed off his picturesque home to them.\n\nThe place looked like it belonged in a magazine.\n\n“It’s a nice place-” His friend, Serge, stated. This was his first time seeing the place and he was in complete awe of the exquisite state of place. However, his amazement was pushed aside when Val walked into the kitchen. The doorway was blocked by a small huddle of people - Val and his friends - and they all looked down upon Zendaya and officer Beatty.\n\nVal, who had, had run-ins with the police on many occasions, knew how to react in such a situation and he grinned. He was dressed in a tuxedo, like he usually was for work, but he had loosened his tie and his jacket was swung casually over his arm. He looked calm and collected.\n\n“Officer, can I help you?” Val asked, shuffling over towards where Zendaya was seated. She knew Val was in the room but she didn’t dare look up. She was still crying and she knew, if she were to look at Val, she was going to lose it. She wasn’t ready to face him yet and so, she kept her face buried in her knee caps. “Baby, is everything okay?” Val was standing right next to Zendaya now but she edged away from him discreetly; his presence was making her sick. Val’s cologne enveloped Zendaya’s senses and she could feel the bile arising from the pit of her stomach.\n\n“There is no need for the facade, Valentin-” The officer chided at him.\n\n“Please, call me, Val.” Val replied back smoothly.\n\n“Games over, Val. We’ve got enough evidence to send and your boys to court.” Panic surged within Val but he didn’t let that reflect onto his face. His smile didn’t falter, he just crossed his arms across his chest. “It’s a shame you’d do such things …” Officer Beatty looked at Zendaya and then back at Val. “She really cared you know.\"\n\nVal looked at the officer as if he were speaking a foreign language. His eyebrows frowned together as realisation hit him - after twelve years in the business, he had been caught for the first time. Val gulped but he knew, from within, that his boys would bail him out … the police couldn’t have much on Val just because he was always careful therefore Alex or Serge or Ben would get him out of trouble in no time. \"We are going to have to hold you and Zendaya, over here, in custody until the date of your trial is released.”\n\n“Zendaya?” Shivers ran through Zendaya’s body as he says her name. “Why does she have to be held in custody? You said you had evidence on me, not her.” Val grew defensive over Zendaya because he knew she knew nothing if this world. Zendaya had been kept oblivious to Val’s work within the criminal world and Val had chosen to keep it that way. The criminal world was dangerous and Val had experienced many near-death situations because of the circumstances he put himself into. Val had many enemies and he knew nine of them would hesitate when it came to attacking Zendaya to get to him.\n\nVal treasured Zendaya’s life more than his own and if anybody caught word of this, Val was positive he would find his wife hurt … or, God forbid, dead. Val loved Zendaya too much to risk her safety and so, he lied to her about his profession. He tried his hardest to cover up his traces just to ensure that she wasn’t getting hurt. That she was protected at all times. “She is your wife and in these scenarios, whether she was involved in deviant behavior or not, there is a possibility that she knows information that we are unaware of. We’ve learnt some things since our interview with her earlier.”\n\n“You’ve spoken to her already?” Val asked, startled. His eyes hovered over Zendaya and his breathing became painfully slow.\n\nVal had spent all most five years trying to hide this from her and now, now everything was left out in the open. Some would think that it would feel like a weight off of Val’s shoulders, it felt the exact opposite. Val felt as if somebody was clawing at his chest, stopping him from taking every next breathe. “Detka?” Val tried to teach for Zendaya but she scrambled away from his touch, not wanting him near her. Val’s gut seemed to wrench as Zendaya helplessly tried to escape him. It hurt Val to know she was hurting.\n\n“I think it’s best for you to give her some time to let this all sink in-” Officer Beatty started but Val interrupted him quickly enough.\n\n\"I don’t think you should be telling me how to act towards my wife!“ Val’s lip snarled upwards as he instructed the officer to mind his own business. Val’s voice grew loud and Alex Sander came to his helping hand. Alex placed a hand onto Val’s bicep, whispering to him that arguing with the cop was only going to make things worse. Val knew his friend was right and so, he backed away slightly. But, he still tried to turn to his wife once again. It was killing Val to have her so close yet so far.\n\n\"It’s best if you stay calm, especially in Zendaya’s condition-” As soon as the words left the officer’s mouth, Zendaya felt her stomach begin to churn aggressively. She clutched at it tightly before making a speedy exit out of the room. She pushed past Val’s friends as she ran for the closest bathroom; the basement. Zendaya stumbled over her legs and over the stairs, tripping over the wooden steps until she got to the large space underneath the house. It wasn’t used very often but, just like the rest of the house, it was kept in an immaculate state.\n\nNet garlands hung from the ceiling and white interior was skilfully placed at different angles to make the spacious room seem even bigger. A few splashes of colour were thrown around the room: a vase of fresh flowers, a folded blanket, some throw cushions.\n\nThe place was pretty to look at but from Zendaya’s point of view, the white-washed colour was making her feel dizzier. She used her hands to guide her through the space before pushing onto the bathroom door and falling through, into the room. Her legs hit the floor and she used her hands to push her forward until she was at eye-level with the toilet. From the corner of her eye, Zendaya could see everybody pile in after her but she paid no attention to them. Her hands grasped at her brown locks as she threw up the contents of her stomach. The smell of disinfectant lingered near the toilet and it made her feel worse, the food she had eaten wrenching from her stomach, up her throat and back out into the atmosphere.\n\n“Zendaya!” As Val chased Zendaya down the stairs, he looked about at the officer curiously. Val knew that the officer wasn’t going to leave him alone and so, he didn’t object to him coming downstairs with him. Actually, all of his friends – Alex, Ben, Serge, Nicole, Dasha, Jonathan, Oksana – followed him down to the basement. Val didn’t really care though, not when the love of his life was so distressed. Imitating Zendaya’s steps, Val followed her as she ran and he curiously glanced at her as she headed for the bathroom. Within seconds, Val realised she was throwing up and his fast walk turned into a sprint. His knees fell to the bathroom floor as he rubbed at her back gingerly.\n\nZendaya didn’t have enough energy in her to object to his hold, but, she had enough energy to shake his hands off her. Her body shook as she pushed his hands away from her and his hands dropped to the floor forcefully. “Baby, shhh, it’s going to be okay … I promise.” Val’s voice was cracking as he tried reassuring both himself and Zendaya. She had started crying again but this was the first time was seeing her cry today and seeing her like that was like having somebody pierce a knife through his heart continuously. Val sat beside Zendaya as she vomited but every time he reached for her, she’d push him away. Her hands slapped at his and it broke Val’s heart into smaller pieces, every single time.\n\n“Beatty!” Val’s head snapped upwards as another officer came running into the room. The blonde female looked at her fellow worker and then down at Zendaya. “She was telling the truth, she rang Doctor Carmine yesterday and she’s scheduled to go see the doctor tomorrow. She is pregnant and Doctor Carmine said she can be here as soon as possible so we can finish the girl’s interrogation.”\n\nVal just thought she was throwing up because of what was going on … because she was scared. Not because she was … not because she was … pregnant. His mouth opened and closed as he tried to take everything in slowly: Zendaya was pregnant, they were pregnant. He was finally going to be a father; he was going to be able to start a family with Zendaya …\n\n“You’re pregnant?” By this time now, Zendaya had emptied out her stomach. Her clammy forehead was resting against the toilet seat lid as she let the cold solid send shivers through her. The icy contact was cooling Zendaya down and she sat in silence for a few moments. The taste of her lunch lingered upon her taste buds and she gulped a few times, trying to rid herself of the horrific flavour. “Daya, you’re … we’re-“\n\n“This is your fault,” Zendaya whispered at first but once she realised she had some of her energy back, she turned to face him. Her red eyes met his green ones and suddenly, Zendaya felt so much stronger. “This is your fault!” Her voice was loud now, all most a scream, and she reached forward and slapped her hand against Val’s chest, causing him to stumble backwards a little. “How … how could you? Huh? I’m … I’m meant to be your wife! You were meant to tell me everything.” After every word there was a pause and this was where the room was filled with the loud smacks that Zendaya was inflicting upon Val. “I’ve lost everything … everyone because of you.” Zendaya used the back of her hand to wipe at her nose. “My mom, dad, Deja, Dom, Trevor, Bella, Roshon, Spencer … I lost everything because you promised, you promised you’d be there for me! We promised that we’d stay by one another through thick and thin, through sickness and in health … you said we were two pieces of a whole-“\n\n“And, none of that has changed, lyubov, love,” Val was crying himself now. He didn’t care that it made him look wimpy in front of his men. None of that mattered when Zendaya was in such a broken state, none of that mattered now that Zendaya was carrying Val’s child; his heir. “I am still by your side and I always will be, I will guide you through the rest of your life, I will be there for our rebenok, our child.”\n\nOfficer Beatty was going to cut into the conversation. As a police officer, it was his job to handcuff Val – a violent criminal – so that officers could search the premises and continue with interviews before solicitors and lawyers got involved. Officer Beatty should have handcuffed Val as soon as he had walked through the door, just in case he tried anything, but Officer Beatty hadn’t. He hadn’t because he knew, in order for Zendaya to be emotionally stable, she was going to have to confront Val first. The officer was married himself and he could, somewhat, see from Zendaya’s eyes.\n\n“My child,” Zendaya sneered at Val. She used her legs to push her backwards until her back was resting against the shower compartment’s door. “Not our child, Val, my child.”\n\n“What?” Val looked aghast as Zendaya’s eyes looked back at him with no emotion in them.\n\n“You’re not coming anywhere near me or my child.” Zendaya protectively pulled her knees upwards, blocking Val’s view of her non-existent stomach that was scheduled to grow bigger within the next nine months. “My child will not grow up with a criminal as a father.” Zendaya could feel her heart cracking as she said this. Never had she imagined her husband being a criminal or her own child growing up without a father but logically, Zendaya understood that staying well away from Val was the best thing for her to do - not only for her sake but her unborn child’s sake too.\n\n“You … you … you don’t mean that,” Val’s pupils dilated as the seriousness enveloped the room. It was like a grey cloud that had suddenly darkened his once sunny atmosphere.\n\nThe simple thought of not being there to see his son or daughter grow was enough to make Val regret the decisions he had made because the truth was that Val loved Zendaya. He had met her by chance, on his way to New York, and he had fallen head-first for her when he’d laid eyes upon her. She was the most beautiful thing to have ever graced his presence and he couldn’t help but fall more and more in love with her as every day passed. Val understood that her parents did not approve of their relationship and he had tried his hardest to fulfil all of her needs in order to keep her happy. It was why Val had lied to her about what he actually did, he knew once she discovered what he was, and she’d leave him. It was a selfish thing to do but, Val couldn’t afford to lose her. He just couldn’t. So, he’d pulled out all the works to stop Zendaya from finding out about his criminal network. He showered her with money and gifts and clothes and he made sure she was always taken care of.\n\nZendaya never doubted him or his love, until now. And, Val felt stupid for putting himself in such a fatal situation. “You … you can’t take my child away from me, Zendaya, you can’t … we can work through this, please!”\n\n“Mr Chmerkovskiy,” Officer Beatty added to the conversation. “Actually, whilst Zendaya is pregnant, she has full rights upon the unborn child. Whether she chooses to stay with you or not, she is able to do as she pleases without consulting you for the baby is growing within her. However, if Zendaya chooses to keep the baby-“ Zendaya was about to intercept and state that abortion was not an option for her. “You can fight for legal rights then. That is if your trial runs smoothly. But, usually, the court sides with the mother and in your … circumstances … there is a little to no chance to you getting full or joint custody upon your child.”\n\n“No,” Val hit his fist against the wall. Everybody in the room heard something crack but Val was a tough man and had been injured many times before, a few broken fingers was the least of his troubles. “Zendaya,” Val was seated on his knees now.\n\nHe was begging for forgiveness. “Please, baby, don’t do this. I love you, you know that. You mean the world to me, Dayachka, don’t do this … just let me explain. Let me take care of you, babe, please. I did it for you, I did it for us … I didn’t want you to live a life like you did back in Oakland; I wanted you to be happy. I wanted to be able to give you everything you deserved! I wanted to be able to buy you everything that you wanted!” Val was well aware of how pathetic he sounded but begging for Zendaya to hear him out was the only thing Val had left.\n\n“None of that matters!” Zendaya shook her head, left and right. Her hair swung wildly with her as she did. “I didn’t want any of the money or the house or the clothes … I wanted you. That’s all I wanted. You.”\n\n“Please, just let talk to you … let me explain what happened!”\n\n“I’ll hear what you have to say in court, Valentin Chmerkovskiy.” Zendaya sneered as she said his full name, something which she never did. “Until then, I don’t want to see your face.” Zendaya stood up. It took her a while to become stable upon her two feet and she nodded at officer Beatty who escorted her out of the room, for further questioning, whilst Officer Linda dealt with Val.\n\n“Valentin Aleksandrovich Chmerkovskiy, you are under arrest for twelve counts of criminal behaviour. You do not have to say anything but if you do, it may be held against you during trials.”"
