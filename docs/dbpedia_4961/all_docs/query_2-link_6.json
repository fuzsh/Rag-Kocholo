        "text": "In recent months, Maksim Chmerkovskiy has been making headlines for reasons other than his superb dancing talent and his time on Dancing With the Stars. It’s now his love life that has been the subject of much speculation.\n\nKirstie Alley renews feud with Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nIt was previously reported that Chmerkovskiy and Jennifer Lopez may have been dating, and the dancing pro briefly touched on the subject during an interview with People magazine on Saturday at the Alfalit International Global Literacy Dinner in Miami, Florida.\n\n“Yes, she’s great, I have fun,” he said without elaborating on what’s happening between the pair. “And while other names are out there… I am not a scumbag.”\n\nThe dancer also went on to explain that he’s a busy man, but he still manages to find time for romance.\n\nJennifer Lopez celebrates b-day with Maks Chmerkovskiy\n\n“I am a hopeless romantic who falls in lust and gets in trouble,” Chmerkovskiy said. “I love my work and am very productive, yet I always find time to play” — although he failed to comment on who he finds time to play with!\n\nBesides his love life and his talent, Chmerkovskiy insists there is more to him than just being a dancer.\n\n“I am more than dancing,” he told the mag.\n\n“I was a dancing pro on the show for about a decade, and I needed the trophy to show for it. But Meryl was part of that,” he said of winning the mirror ball trophy on DWTS last season. “And while I am doing other things, Meryl is a close friend and has become very important in my life. We have new projects together.”\n\nJennifer Lopez, Maksim Chmerkovskiy reportedly dating\n\nAnd those new projects include studying to become an actor, expanding his Dance With Me Dance Studios — he just opened his sixth studio in Los Angeles, California — and designing a line of men’s jewelry called MAKSIM. Not bad!"
