The couple met while on Broadway in 2009, but it wasn’t until their paths crossed again on Dancing With the Stars that they began dating in 2012. Three years later, the Ukrainian dancer asked Murgatroyd to marry him while performing onstage in December 2015. The couple did, however, make it down the aisle in July 2017, having a both a small ceremony at City Hall and a 300-guest celebration in New York the same month. The pair, who welcomed their first child, son Shai, in January 2017 ahead of the nuptials, have continued to evolve as a couple. As the married dancers continue raising Shai together, Murgatroyd revealed in June 2022 that she had suffered three miscarriages while trying to expand their family.\n\nThe duo have since been candid about their fertility struggles as they undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF). They subsequently welcomed son Rio in June 2023 and seven months later announced that Murgatroyd is expecting their third child.\n\nScroll down to relive the couple’s biggest relationship moments through the years:\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nJuly 2017\n\nThe professional dancers said “I do” at City Hall in New York City in July 2017. “This was one of the most exciting days of my life,” Chmerkovskiy wrote via Instagram the following year. “Everything felt very festive, I couldn’t take my eyes off my future wife the whole ride to the City Hall and it was is if New York City herself was marrying us.”\n\nCredit: John Photography/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2019\n\n“I think you learn a lot about each other because you don’t really know what type of parent you’re going to be, and who you’re going to be parenting alongside, really, until you become a parent,” the All Things Fam and Glam blogger told Us in March 2019 about the couple’s relationship after becoming parents. “You become closer. From the delivery room, to bringing them home for the first time, to, like, sharing those special moments.”\n\nCredit: AFF-USA/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2020\n\n“When Peta said it was a boy, I had this elated reaction like, ‘Thank God.’ But immediately after that, I was like, ‘OK, now I’m ready for a girl.’ I just think it’s a special thing,” Maksim told Us in March 2020 of expanding their family. “[My mom is] dying [for a girl], but I am too.” Murgatroyd previously told Us that she would “love to have more kids.”\n\nCredit: Snorlax / MEGA\n\nMarch 2020\n\n“I just saw that she genuinely was in love with this guy, and he’s not always easy to love,” Val told Us in March 2020 of when he knew his brother had found The One with Murgatroyd. “I just knew that if she’s capable of loving him like I do and like my parents, and beyond even more so, and is willing to vouch for this man — there’s a lot of things that go with love. Love is not just, ‘Oh, this is love.’ Love is about loyalty, camaraderie, a certain respect. You saw all of that in the way she looked at him, and it was like, ‘That’s a keeper.’”\n\nMaks recalled his brother telling him to lock it down early on in his relationship. “He’s like, ‘I hope you put a ring on it.’ It wasn’t a surprise,” Maks told Us. “It was a beautiful thing that happened.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nApril 2020\n\nAs the world descended into lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Murgatroyd-Chmerkovskiy household hunkered down together for plenty of quality time. As the two-time DWTS champ shared via Instagram at the time, “I’m loving the extra family time that quarantine has brought us .”\n\nIn June, she shared another photo collage of her husband and son, writing, “This is all that matters.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Maksim Chmerkovskiy/Instagram\n\nJuly 2020\n\nThe couple celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary. The Peta Jane Beauty founder shared a slideshow of wedding memories via Instagram, along with the caption: “It’s been over 7 years and I’m still head over heels for you @maksimc Happy Anniversary my love.”\n\nHer doting groom also shared his anniversary wishes for his spouse on Instagram. Chmerkovskiy shared a snapshot of the card he gave her. On it, he wrote, “1,096 amazing, incredible, dramatic, magical, spontaneous, loving, passionate, extraordinary, wild, fervent, beautiful, amorous days!” The dancer continued, “I am lucky to have you in my life is a gross understatement there isn’t an aspect of my life where I feel complete without you. I love you beyond comprehension and for as long as I live!”\n\nCredit: FOX\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Fuller House alum appeared as a mystery contestant on Fox’s The Masked Dancer as the Sloth character. While he wasn’t unmasked until the finale, several of his clues along the way mentioned his love for his family. Some of his clues included a family drawing on a chalkboard, a piece of pita bread and that he hoped his performance showed his “Baby Sloth” sees that he’s a “big softy.”\n\nDuring the seventh week of the season, \"Sloth\" revealed in a clue package, “I was lonely until I met the love of my life who taught me that love is magic.”\n\nFollowing the show’s finale, Murgatroyd gushed about her husband’s hard work via Instagram, writing, “I’ll start by saying I’m proud and overwhelmed with joy. Seeing you become the SLOTH was equally hysterical and intriguing, and truly a highlight of 2020 for me. … I hadn’t seen you that happy in months....every day after rehearsal you came home with so much positivity and light radiating from you. … It was a pleasure seeing your excitement my love....this is what your soul needed and my heart is bursting for you. You’re a STAR, a true entertainer and an absolute champion. I wholeheartedly love you with everything in my being. Here’s to more laughs and sweaty Sloth suit adventures in the future... ”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nChmerkovskiy surprised the New Zealand native on Valentine’s Day.\n\n“I was in complete shock, we had just been speaking on the phone, with him telling me he was driving back to his hotel in the freezing cold in Ukraine,” Murgatroyd wrote via Instagram at the time. “Lol. Liar!!! Big lies!!! He had flown overnight and told me that he had a long work day and wouldn’t be able to talk for most of it. More Lies!!!! ❤️ This was the BEST SURPRISE EVER!!!”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nAmid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chmerkovskiy gave his social media followers a glimpse of his experience in Kyiv while filming World of Dance. The Peta Jane founder, for her part, asked for prayers for his safe homecoming.\n\n“I don’t usually ask these things from my social media network, however, today is extremely hard and the next few days will be even harder,” she wrote via Instagram on February 24. “My pain is overwhelming and I’m struggling, but you sending your positive light and love to him would be the world to me. Truly, I wish for nothing more. Please play that he comes home soon. Please pray that he has a swift, safe exit. I have faith. I have hope and I have prayed so hard.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nMarch 2022\n\n“I never thought our family would be directly affected by this in our lifetime, I never thought what we are seeing on our TV’s was a reality in 2022. I have never hugged him so tight,” Murgatroyd wrote via Instagram alongside a snap of Chmerkovskiy cuddling Shai. “Shaking and forever grateful. Now it’s time to heal. We cannot go back to our normal. Our lives are forever changed. We have a new normal, and that’s OK.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nMarch 2022\n\n“I feel OK. However there are so many 'things' going on,” Murgatroyd wrote via Instagram Stories after a fan asked how she felt with her husband’s return to Poland. “At first I was nervous and unsure and didn't want him to leave again. But I know he made the right decision. There wasn't a way that he could stay and watch. I'm just proud. I have my anxious days though!”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nJune 2022\n\nMurgatroyd revealed she and her husband were just “working” on expanding their family during a June 8 Instagram Q&A. At the time, a social media follower had asked whether a second child was in the couple’s future.\n\n“No seriously, you all will get some info coming at you soon about our family,” she wrote in her social media post.\n\nCredit: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2022\n\n\"You’ve probably been wondering why we haven’t had more children after we keep saying how much we want to ... well I’ve been trying. I’ve had three miscarriages and it’s been a long hard journey for Maks and I. A traumatic, stressful, super sad journey,\" Murgatroyd revealed in a lengthy Instagram post. \"You might ask why? Why are you telling this personal story…? Well, I didn’t want to for the longest time. I never wanted to tell anyone.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I honestly just got sick of hiding it. I found it was harder to conceal this secret than just 'say it how it was' so to speak. It became harder for me to keep a happy face on, day after day. ... The first time I let it out of my mouth to a colleague I felt strangely better, like a piece of shame had chipped away. So I found the more people I told, the better I felt. I came to realize that there is nothing shameful about it.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Peta Murgatroyd/Instagram\n\nAugust 2022\n\nMurgatroyd shared a heartbreaking glimpse of her IVF process via Instagram, revealing her first transfer was unsuccessful. \"I really did think that this was going to work,\" she captioned the footage. \"Looking into Maks eyes as he was crying, seeing our baby together ... just made this experience so worth it even though it didn't turn out how we had hoped. ...
