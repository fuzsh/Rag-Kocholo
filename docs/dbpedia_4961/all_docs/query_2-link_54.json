        "text": "PureDWTS 2007 Flashback Tribute To The Late And Great Muhammad Ali\n\nPureDWTS would like to extend all of our love and condolences to Laila Ali and the friends and family of Muhammad Ali for their loss. We’ll never forget this amazing legend….not only for his boxing, but, for his endless love and sensitive heart for people the world over. We are all so blessed too that he graced the stage of Dancing With The Stars. Below is a flashback to 2007….\n\nDuring the live taping of May 7’s Dancing with the Stars, Muhammad Ali slowly shuffled his way into the ballroom, using his wife, Lonnie, for support instead of a walker. Easing himself into a padded black chair, the formerly louder-than-life boxer, who has battled Parkinson’s disease for more than two decades, sat expressionless at first, his left thumb twitching slightly in his lap. But when the legendary fighter spotted two attractive young women in the audience blowing him kisses, his eyes lit up. He pointed at them and waved as the crowd cheered. To Laila Ali, that was just Dad being Dad: “He’s the biggest flirt in the world!”\n\nThat night, however, the champ was there for one woman: his youngest daughter, Laila, 29, who followed her father into the boxing ring as a women’s super-middleweight titlist. But this season her knockout dance moves have made her a TV star and a semifinalist on Dancing. After Laila dedicated her waltz to her father, 65, and her mother, Veronica Porsche Anderson (they divorced in 1986), “I lost my focus a bit,” Laila admits. “I got a little emotional” as her home video reel played. “It took my attention off of the dance for just a minute. I started off on the wrong foot.”\n\nStill, she nabbed three 9s, a proud moment for both father and daughter, who share a keen competitive edge—and much more. “I see a lot of me in him and him in me,” says Laila. Their bond has lasted through the strains of fame, divorce and the disease that has ravaged Muhammad’s body—and yes, Dad, who devoured previous Dancing episodes on TV, is as thrilled with her high scores as he was with her KOs. “After he saw the first show, his thing was just ‘Everywhere I go everybody’s talking about you!'” says Laila. “He thought it was funny because he’s used to people talking about him.”\n\nTheir May 7 reunion at Dancing was the first time father and daughter had seen each other in a few months. “When we get together, it’s like we haven’t missed a beat,” says Laila. But “it’s not as easy for him to get around as everyone else.” Despite the tremors, stiffness and slurred speech caused by Parkinson’s, Muhammad keeps an ambitious travel schedule to support humanitarian causes. At the home he shares with Lonnie, 50, in Phoenix, his routine includes lifting weights and bike riding. He also likes to pop in old Clint Eastwood movies and answer fan mail—sometimes by calling a phone number in a letter to say hello in his whispery voice. And his playful nature remains intact. “He has dessert for breakfast—ice cream and Popsicles,” says Ali’s older sister Hana, 30.\n\nMore at People. TV Guide also posted what happened backstage at the time of Muhammad Ali’s visit. Thanks to Tom Bergeron for posting this memory at his twitter…\n\nYou knew someone important was coming on Monday night. There was a special black armchair, padded and more comfortable than Dancing with the Stars’ standard stiff ballroom chairs. At the top of the show, it was occupied by a seat filler. And then, just before the fourth dance, when Laila Ali and her pro partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, took the stage, the seat filler was ushered away. While cohost Samantha Harris was backstage interviewing Billy Ray Cyrus about the fox trot that judge Bruno Tonioli had just called “crap,” a familiar figure shuffled slowly into the ballroom.\n\nIt was Muhammad Ali. He walked in under his own steam. But he is 65 years old and struggling with Parkinson’s disease, a neurological disorder that usually involves a progressive loss of motor control. There was a hush in the ballroom as he settled into the armchair next to his elegant fourth wife, Lonnie. Host Tom Bergeron made note of his arrival and the crowd immediately erupted in a standing ovation. Ali’s mouth, not opening enough to show teeth, curved into the sweetest of smiles as he acknowledged the love in the room.\n\nAs he settled in, five red-jacketed ABC pages stationed themselves with their backs to him, a ring of security, doubtless to stop any die-hard fan from rushing to the floor to meet him. But there was never a feeling that someone would do something stupid: the adoration – and the respect — were palpable. “Muhammad Ali’s in the house tonight,” said warm-up Cory Almeida. “Come on, you know you want to give it up.” And the audience went crazy again.\n\nAnd then, as Laila danced, you could see that her father was entranced. He didn’t move a muscle. But his eyes were glued to her every move. He didn’t watch Maks, just Laila. It must’ve been so bittersweet: To be the former world-heavyweight champion and watch his offspring, another world champion and an extraordinary physical specimen, wowing the judges, the audience and the public with her own powerful blend of athleticism and grace. “It put a little more pressure on me tonight,” said musical director Harold Wheeler, “knowing he was going to be there. I try to do the best job I can for all of the performers. But there was more pressure for Laila’s number in the fact that Muhammad Ali was here. I wanted her to be able to do a good job for him.”\n\nShe did a wonderful job, a solid waltz, and walked away with three “9” ratings from the judges. As they rolled into a commercial break, Lonnie Ali took out Kleenex and gently dabbed her husband’s eyes and mouth. Then she straightened his suit jacket and tie. The two have been married since 1986. Laila’s mother, Veronica Porsche Anderson — Ali’s third wife — sat nearby. She, too, only had eyes for her daughter.\n\nTo read the full article, see TV Guide.\n\nTo the late and great Muhammad Ali. We’ll never forget you and how you touched us all and on Dancing With The Stars too.\n\nLaila Ali & Maksim Chmerkovskiy – Waltz by Codebear2\n\nShare this:\n\nDWTS 16 Preliminary Power Rankings – Part I\n\nSo it’s time once again for me to gaze into my crystal ball before the premiere and try to take a wild (but educated) guess at how things are gonna pan out this season – who’s gonna be good, who’s gonna be bad, who’s gonna stick around, and who might get sent packing early. Admittedly, this kind of snuck up on me – after my prolonged hiatus after season 15, season 16 seems to have arrived at breakneck speed and I’m just struggling to keep up. Guess that’s what happens when one bad season turns you off of a show completely…don’t know that I’ve been this dubious about a new season of my favorite show since season 5 of Nip/Tuck 😯\n\nFor those just tuning in, a few words of explanation about how I arrive at these rankings. It’s a combination of factors – how good (or bad) of a dancer I think they’ll be, how much of a fanbase I think they do or don’t have, how likeable/unlikeable I think they’ll be to viewers. So all those factors considered – this is how I predict the eliminations to shake out. And they can (and usually do) change after seeing the first episode 😛 So in today’s edition, I tackle the bottom half of the couples: the ones I don’t see lasting past the middle of the competition. Here we go…\n\n12.) Lisa & Gleb – It pains me to say this, considering that they’re my favorite couple, but I’m afraid my favorite Real Housewife of Beverly Hills may be the first on the chopping block this season 🙁 There seems to be several factors working against them – and the one that concerns me the most is the fact that Lisa’s a reality star, and she’s a Real Housewife at that. Considering that TPTB have avoided casting from that franchise like the plague until now, and that the Housewives seem to be some of the more maligned reality tv stars amongst DWTS fans (some DWTS fans reeeeeallllly don’t like Housewives – trust me, I’ve gotten tweets complaining, as if I have any control over casting!), I’m worried that some viewers have already written her off, sight unseen. Then again, I could be completely wrong – since we have no precedent for a Real Housewife on DWTS, how do I know that RHOBH fans won’t tune in and vote in droves for our British lass? 🙂 They’re also contending with the fact that Gleb is a brand new pro without much of a fanbase (and without the benefit of being visible to the DWTS viewers already, a la Sharna in the troupe or Lindsay on SYTYCD) – although I daresay Gleb’s stunning good looks certainly don’t seem to be hurting them 😉 Besides those two hurdles, I also worry that they’re just too laid back – their rehearsals are neither memorably good nor memorably bad, which could make them blend into the woodwork amongst some of the bigger personalities this season. And we don’t really have any idea what Lisa’s dancing prowess is like, nor do we know what Gleb’s teaching/choreographing prowess is like – they could be really good, they could be really bad, they could just “be”. I’m hoping that we’re in for a pleasant surprise with these two, but my gut’s telling me that they’re probably not going to make it past the first few weeks of the season.

But to help us get a handle on who might be in and out, let’s take a look at what combination of “casting types” we might get this season.\n\nThe Olympian\n\nPrevious examples: Kristi Yamaguchi, Shawn Johnson, Apolo Ohno, Natalie Coughlin, Misty May-Treanor, Maurice Greene, Louie Vito, Evan Lysacek, Hope Solo\n\nAdvantages: The winningest of the 12 types, their obvious advantage is their athleticism – you won’t see these guys struggling with strength or endurance moves. In addition, the same tireless work ethic that helped them medal in the Olympics will likely carry them through the toils of the competition. They also seem to be adored by the masses, as many are seen as “hero” figures – which translates into a formidable voting fanbase.\n\nDisadvantages: For those specializing in sports that are less “artistic” (i.e. swimming, running, volleyball), it might be a bit hard to really get into the character of the dance and truly perform to the crowd. Previously incurred injuries (or the fear of incurring an injury that might hinder their participation in subsequent competitions in their sport, a la Misty May-Treanor) may also slow them down & limit their mobility.\n\nPossible candidates this season: The only semi-legitmate Olympian prospect I think we’ve heard is Bruce Jenner – and I would like to think that TPTB would have mercy and not subject us to back-to-back seasons of Kardashians in the audience 😀\n\nThe Athlete\n\nPrevious examples: Chuck Liddell, Warren Sapp, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Helio Castroneves, Laila Ali, Floyd Mayweather, Ty Murray, Evander Holyfield, Jerry Rice, Clyde Drexler, Monica Seles, Jason Taylor, Lawrence Taylor, Chad Ochocinco, Kurt Warner, Rick Fox, Sugar Ray Leonard, Chris Jericho, Hines Ward, Ron Artest\n\nAdvantages: As with the Olympians, their athleticism & work ethic make them well-suited to the competition. An edge they might have over their Olympic counterparts: sports like football, auto racing, & mixed martial arts tend to have a larger, more mainstream following than some of the Olympic sports.\n\nDisadvantages: Again, a lack of “artistic” experience & previous injury (especially with the football players, who have really taken a beating over the years). Some of the more muscular athletes in hard-hitting sports may also have difficulty with the refined, precise moves of some of the dances.\n\nPossible candidates this season: Vince Young tweeted that he had been asked to the do the show, then suspiciously deleted the tweet. Guilty much? 😉 We’ve also heard Annika Sorenstam’s name in the mix.\n\nRead more..\n\nShare this:\n\nDWTS4: Randall’s Costume Retrospective, Week 1\n\nAs promised, I am excited to bring you the first installment of our season 4 “costume retrospective” with Randall Christensen, the costume designer for the show from seasons 2-12 of DWTS! You’re in for a real treat, guys – in this edition, Randall not only reveals his inspiration for each of the couples’ costumes, but also explains how the costume department at the studio came to be, some interesting challenges that posed by Heather’s weekly transcontinental traveling, and what you DIDN’T see in Joey & Kym’s disco costumes 😉 Read on!\n\nDid you know that the DWTS costume department wasn’t always located in the same studio as the show itself? Randall explains how tough it was in the early days: “This season was the second season (and the last season) that we had a company in Burbank, CA make the costumes. A nightmare trying to get the couples over the hill into North Hollywood, with intensely congested traffic. I remember one fitting where Heather Mills was 2 hrs. late getting there, even though it was only about a 15 mile drive, due to traffic. That delayed fitting was the catalyst to our getting our own workroom (the very next season), which helped the cast and my crew TREMENDOUSLY! We gave up the Green Room and created our workroom right in the same bldg. as the show, 2 floors above the soundstage.” Can you imagine how stressful it was for both the costume personnel AND the couples to make that trek for the costumes??? And what kind of problems it posed when there were wardrobe malfunctions that needed a quick fix??? Thank goodness the powers that be recognized the need for an in-house costume department, and made the necessary accomodations 🙂\n\n*photos courtesy AP/Chris Pizzello\n\nBilly Ray & Karina’s costumes: “Karina’s “tie dyed” red/burgundy burn-out velvet was a great choice of fabrics/color for their first dance. Individual strands of bugle bead fringe accented her body movements. Billy Ray’s costume was kept simple for this first week.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nIan & Cheryl’s costumes: “Cheryl’s costume had chrome “nail heads” and other silver hardware, giving a bit of an edgier look. We tied in Ian’s look with a chrome studded belt.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nEdyta’s costume: “Edyta always looks sensational in “just a little something” and this costume was no exception! The crystal encrusted petal bra and that voluminous Cuban style circular skirt was perfect for this first week’s costume! Love the tropical coral color too.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nApolo & Julianne’s costumes: “Julianne’s red beaded fringe number was TONS of work to create, but oh-so-worth it! That skirt just did NOT stay still! And Apolo’s red bandana was a fun tribute to his signature look when competing in speed skating. I loved that he was comfortable (and confident enough) to wear a bit of red trim on his shirt – to tie in (not only his bandana, but also ) with Julianne. Apolo was an incredible athlete, and dedicated and determined to do whatever was needed to give him an edge. I’ve noticed (and appreciated ) that about all of the athletes that have been on the show.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nJoey & Kym’s costumes: “Kym Johnson/Joey Fatone – now here is one confident (and FUN) celebrity! Joey really wanted for us to trim the back of his vest with TWO WORDS – FAT and ONE. The producers didn’t want us to do that, so we went with his Fatone (one word) rhinestone encrusted on the back of his vest. And what a FUN costume for Kym – a tribute to the 70’s-80’s “ABBA” look. Smoking on Kym’s smoking body, don’t you think? Very fun, and a bit tongue-in-cheek.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nLaila’s costume: “Laila is such a phenomenally gorgeous woman, and one terrific athlete. Because she is so tall, and has quite the muscular body, I really wanted to make sure her femininity came through. In spite of all her muscles (fantastic biceps!!!!) Laila is ALL woman! This rust silk satin gown with crystal encrusted appliqué was soft yet sexy, and did that skirt ever soar when she moved! Of course standing over 6 ft. tall in heels certainly made for a dramatic silhouette, one which Maks could still certainly handle.”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nHeather’s costume (and the special challenges it posed): “The first few weeks of pre production and the first couple of weeks of the live show posed quite a challenge for us and Heather. Because of the notoriety of Heather, we had to do so much secretively, so as to not alert the public as to her being on the show (during pre-production I was the only person on my staff who knew she was one of the celebrities – we had to keep it THAT hush, hush!). So consequently, we had a company in London create the first two weeks’ costumes for her, as she was training weekly in England (flying over to compete and then returning back to England). The company we used had been the costume makers for the UK version of DWTS (Strictly Come Dancing) and we are good friends, so I felt really comfortable having them take care of Heather. They travelled a great distance to give Heather her fittings. This gown was one of their creations and fitted Heather’s style and physique perfectly! I think that the biggest challenge was to find a dance shoe company that could/would make VEGAN dance shoes. Being a strict vegetarian, Heather was quite concerned about wearing dance shoes which always have leather suede soles, for proper traction on the dance floor. Thank goodness her assistant knew of a great shoe company that made several pairs for her to try out, rehearse in, and another set to perform in. And Heather was incredibly helpful, not to mention a total JOY to work with! I don’t know that I have ever had (before Heather or since) a person who got so excited on each and every design session. There were times when we were giggling and she was clapping and exclaiming how much fun this was. Heather was one of my most memorable celebrities that I have worked with, totally professional and very appreciative!”\n\n*photo courtesy ABC/Carol Kaelson\n\nWow! I never realized what challenges the costume department had to overcome behind the scenes! But obviously, they handled them with such skill and perseverence that we never saw them. But it is fun to know behind-the-scenes tidbits like these…definitely makes the show more fun to watch, at least for me 🙂\n\nStill need more DWTS costume goodness? You can always check out Randall’s website and Facebook page, and be sure to stay tuned here for more costume retrospectives from the man himself – we’ve got Randall’s take on the week 2 costumes coming at you later this week 😉\n\nShare this:\n\nDWTS Season 12 Casting Rumors – The Typecasting of Season 12, Part I\n\nWhenever the time comes to start speculating about the next season’s cast, one useful “tool” we all seem to use is the patterns in typecasting over the seasons – we know there will likely be at least 1 athlete, perhaps a reality TV star, a singer or two, etc. But when you REALLY take a good look at the casting “types” over the seasons, it becomes clear that each season has been a carefully-crafted combination of celebs to appeal almost every demographic…and I think we’ve cracked that code 🙂\n\nPrior to the cast announcements, I’ve done a typecasting analysis for both season 10 and season 11, and both casts have fulfilled almost every subtype (with some celebs fulfilling more than one “type”). So why not take a look at the casting rumors for season 12 and see which might fit into the casting equation, shall we? 🙂\n\nThe Olympian\n\nPrevious examples: Kristi Yamaguchi, Shawn Johnson, Apolo Ohno, Natalie Coughlin, Misty May-Treanor, Maurice Greene, Louie Vito, Evan Lysacek\n\nAdvantages: The winningest of the 12 types, their obvious advantage is their athleticism – you won’t see these guys struggling with strength or endurance moves. In addition, the same tireless work ethic that helped them medal in the Olympics will likely carry them through the toils of the competition. They also seem to be adored by the masses, as many are seen as “hero” figures – which translates into a formidable voting fanbase.\n\nDisadvantages: For those specializing in sports that are less “artistic” (i.e. swimming, running, volleyball), it might be a bit hard to really get into the character of the dance and truly perform to the crowd. Previously incurred injuries (or the fear of incurring an injury that might hinder their participation in subsequent competitions in their sport, a la Misty May-Treanor) may also slow them down & limit their mobility.\n\nPossible candidates this season: Since we didn’t get an Olympian last season, I can almost guarantee we’ll get one this season – and the most likely candidate seems to be Nastia Liukin, who has been a rumor for a few seasons now and has started following Mark on Twitter within the past few days. Other possibilities: Greg Louganis, who seems to have been trying for several seasons now to get onto the show; and while it may be a long-shot, Johnny Weir fans are still campaigning for a “Team Weirnoff” partnership.\n\nThe Athlete\n\nPrevious examples: Chuck Liddell, Warren Sapp, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Helio Castroneves, Laila Ali, Floyd Mayweather, Ty Murray, Evander Holyfield, Jerry Rice, Clyde Drexler, Monica Seles, Jason Taylor, Lawrence Taylor, Chad Ochocinco, Kurt Warner, Rick Fox\n\nAdvantages: As with the Olympians, their athleticism & work ethic make them well-suited to the competition. An edge they might have over their Olympic counterparts: sports like football, auto racing, & mixed martial arts tend to have a larger, more mainstream following than some of the Olympic sports.\n\nDisadvantages: Again, a lack of “artistic” experience & previous injury (especially with the football players, who have really taken a beating over the years). Some of the more muscular athletes in hard-hitting sports may also have difficulty with the refined, precise moves of some of the dances.\n\nPossible candidates this season: This category has been oddly devoid of really “solid” possibilities this season, aside from the Brett Favre debacle – doubtful, but stranger things have happened on the show! Chris Jericho was also kicked around as a possibility again this season, and it looks like WWE Diva Maria Kanellis is still gunning for a spot on the show.\n\nThe Model/Playmate/Beauty Queen\n\nPrevious examples: Kelly Monaco, Rachel Hunter, Tia Carrere, Shanna Moakler, Paulina Porizkova, Shandi Finnessey, Josie Maran, Albert Reed, Shannon Elizabeth, Brooke Burke, Holly Madison, Kathy Ireland, Joanna Krupa, Pam Anderson\n\nAdvantages: All the costumes seem to look fantastic on them (and they can get away with wearing the really skimpy ones) and so do their pro partners – easy to imagine a “showmance”, which always seems to grab votes. Also seems to have cornered the votes of the small population of male viewers, for obvious reasons\n\nDisadvantages: Despite making a career out of looking great posing & strutting down the runway, many of them have proven to be rather awkward movers outside of that context, and some seem to have a hard time carrying around their taller than average stature. They also run the risk of getting lost in the shuffle among attractive male competitors, who seem to draw in more votes from the predominantly-female viewing population.\n\nPossible candidates this season: A strong possibility seems to be Kendra Wilkinson, who would be following in the footsteps of her Girls Next Door co-star Holly Madison. Rumored contestant Lee Meriwether is also a former Miss America.\n\nThe Legend\n\nPrevious examples: Cloris Leachman, Wayne Newton, Donny Osmond, Tatum O’Neal, Marie Osmond, Jane Seymour, Marlee Matlin, Susan Lucci, Florence Henderson\n\nAdvantages: These individuals are extremely well-known & respected in the entertainment business, with many years of experience (and fans) under their belts, as well as an award or two. Also masters of the stage & screen – perhaps the best at emulating the emotions of the dances.\n\nDisadvantages: With many years of experience comes an older age than many of their competitors – which comes with an increased risk of injury & fatigue that could limit the difficulty of their routines.\n\nPossible candidates this season: We’ve got two ladies with quite a sterling reputation in show business – Faye Dunaway & Lee Meriwether. One was the original “Bonnie” of Bonnie & Clyde; the other was the original Catwoman. Who do you think we’ll get? 🙂\n\nThe Soap Star\n\nPrevious examples: Kelly Monaco, Cameron Mathison, Lisa Rinna, Susan Lucci, Aiden Turner\n\nAdvantages: The demographic of soap opera viewers overlaps heavily with the demographic of viewers of DWTS, and most soap opera viewers have been watching those shows for years (I started watching General Hospital when I was 6!), so they often have a fierce loyalty to their favorite characters (and the actors/actresses who portray them).\n\nDisadvantages: This group likely has the most grueling schedule to contend with, as most soaps tape year-round, and some of them are taped in New York, forcing the stars (and sometimes their partners) to fly coast-to-coast several times a week to practice. Many also have absolutely no background in any kind of sport, making them a real “project” for the pros to take on.\n\nPossible candidates this season: The lovely Lee Meriwether could do triple duty this season, by fulfilling this category by virtue of her role of Ruth Martin on All My Children. From the online voting for this season’s cast, it looks like Colleen Zenk & Crystal Chappell are also big favorites.\n\nThe Comedian\n\nPrevious examples: Penn Jillette, Jeff Ross, Adam Carolla, David Allen Grier, Ashley Hamilton, Niecy Nash, Margaret Cho\n\nAdvantages: Let’s face it, they’re fun to watch, and they definitely inject some much- needed hilarity into the show.\n\nDisadvantages: They often come across like they don’t take the competition seriously, instead favoring their usual schtick over actual dancing. Some of their on-show humor (Jeff Ross’ in particular) can also be rather polarizing – hilarious to some, offensive to others. And again – often no background in any sort of sport, let alone dancing.\n\nPossible candidates this season: None that we’ve heard of…but who would you like to see? I’m holding out for a member of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour to sign on – Ron White would be a hoot!\n\nSo do you guys think I’m onto something with this season’s rumors? Tune in for my next installment, where I dissect just who we might get this season from the teen idol, host, actor, reality star, singer, & wild card categories!\n\nShare this:"
