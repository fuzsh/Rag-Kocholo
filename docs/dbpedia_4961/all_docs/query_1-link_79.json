        "text": "Dancing with the Stars performers Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy have welcomed a bouncing baby boy! The couple have named their first child together Shai Aleksander Chmerkovskiy, and revealed that their newborn son was born on Wednesday at 5.34am.\n\nA representative confirmed the exciting news to HELLO! Online in a statement from the couple which read: \"This is, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to us!\" The professional dancers gave their fans an insight into how they were preparing to welcome their son, with Maksim shared a hilarious snap of his fiancée applying makeup from a hospital bed, writing: \"But first … a little make up.\" He also shared a video in which the couple appear to be on their way to the hospital. Maksim previously opened up about how much he was looking forward to paternity leave. \"I come from a dirt broke family,\" he explained to People. \"I just started to be able to afford things in 2005 when [DWTS] started. For me to be able to take time off in this way … [to have] what we have to enjoy and be proud of, that's anybody's dream.\"\n\nThe couple have welcomed a baby boy\n\nAfter announcing the news, fans of the choreographer were quick to send well-wishes, with one writing: \"Congratulations. You and Peta deserve all the happiness coming your way! God Bless!\" Another added: \"So happy for you both! Absolutely love the name! Shai is so lucky to be born into the most loving family [with] the most amazing parents.\" Peta was ready to welcome baby Shai after enjoying her baby showers two weeks ago. Sharing a photo of the day on Instagram, she wrote: \"I want a baby shower EVERY weekend. Huge thank you to @goodiebox_bakeshop for making my guests the most delicious (my favourite) chocolate on chocolate cake and other delectable goodies.\""
