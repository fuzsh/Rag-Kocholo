        "text": "Dance\n\nFull reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.\n\n★ Kyle Abraham and Marc Bamuthi Joseph (Thursday) This Lincoln Center Out of Doors split bill, with its investigations of race and masculinity, comes at what could hardly be a more charged cultural moment for those themes. Mr. Abraham’s “Pavement” depicts scenes from the streets of Pittsburgh’s historically black neighborhoods, veering from lighthearted to tragic (with his excellent dancers as the common denominator), while Mr. Joseph’s “Word Becomes Flesh” combines dance, spoken word and live music into a reflection on young single fatherhood. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lcoutofdoors.org; free. (Siobhan Burke)\n\nAera (Friday through Sunday) This Brooklyn-based aerial dance company presents a new work, “Covered Sky.” According to the New York Live Arts Web site, this piece combines “original choreography and custom-designed, three-dimensional structures that utilize mediums such as fabric, pole, and rope in addition to other technologies to create a multifaceted experience of performance.” There is also a poem, presumably to give a feel of the performance, that could hypothetically make listings writers tear their hair with impotent rage. (“Let go, fall in, tear away/The moonlight mouth speaks the babble of that calling/Float down to the bottom.” Etc.) But perhaps it will be a good show anyway. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $47, $42 for students and members; $35 for Sunday’s matinee, $31 for students and members. (Roslyn Sulcas)\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Gelsey Kirkland Academy of Classical Ballet (Wednesday) What are the kids learning in ballet class these days? It’s a serious question, actually, considering the extreme level of technique and versatility demanded by many of today’s ballet companies. Gelsey Kirkland, former principal dancer with New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater, leads a demonstration with advanced students at her TriBeCa academy, which she and her husband, Michael Chernov, founded in 2010. At the reception and Q. and A. that follows, Mr. Chernov will discuss their approach to training a new generation of dancers. At noon, Gelsey Kirkland Academy, 355 Broadway, between Franklin and Leonard Streets, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $38. (Burke)\n\nBodytraffic (Wednesday through Aug. 4) Los Angeles is not exactly known for its thriving contemporary dance scene, but if anyone is changing that reputation, it’s Lillian Barbeito and Tina Finkelman Berkett, directors of this fledgling repertory company. Their Jacob’s Pillow debut program includes Richard Siegal’s “O2Joy,” set to a medley of jazz greats (picture the physical equivalent of Ella Fitzgerald’s vocal gymnastics), and “Fragile Dwellings” by the Belgian choreographer Stijn Celis. Wednesday through next Friday at 8:15 p.m., Aug. 3 at 2:15 and 8:15 p.m., Aug. 4 at 2:15 p.m., Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, Doris Duke Theater, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $22 to $38; limited availability. (Burke)\n\n★ Dorrance Dance (Friday through Sunday) Michelle Dorrance is one of the big names in the current tap generation, but, more unusually, she is also a notable choreographer for an ensemble, able to create cohesive works that do more than celebrate her own remarkable solo skills. Of Ms. Dorrance’s group work, “SOUNDspace,” Brian Seibert wrote in The New York Times this year, “Ms. Dorrance makes full use of tone, timbre, volume, tempo and, of course, rhythm, constructing patterns that lock together thrillingly.” For its Jacob’s Pillow season, Dorrance Dance offers a new work, “The Blues Project,” to music by a live band led by the composer Toshi Reagon, and featuring notable tappers like Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards. Friday at 8:15 p.m., Saturday at 2:15 and 8:15 p.m., Sunday at 2:15 p.m., Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, Doris Duke Theater, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; limited availability.
