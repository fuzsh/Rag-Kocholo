        "text": "It‚Äôs another baby boy for Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy!\n\nThe ‚ÄúDancing With the Stars‚Äù pros announced the arrival of their third child via Instagram on Friday with an adorable selfie snapped from the hospital.\n\nThe sweet pic showed a proud Chmerkovskiy, 44, grinning at the camera while Murgatroyd, 37, cradled their newborn and lovingly looked down at him.\n\n‚ÄúHe is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!‚Äù they captioned the joint post.\n\n‚ÄúBirth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!‚Äù\n\nConcluding the announcement post, the professional dancers thanked their fans for their supportive messages, writing, ‚ÄúMeans a lot and very much appreciated.‚Äù\n\nChmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd also told fans that they made the public announcement just hours after the blonde beauty had gone into labor.\n\nThey shared a photo of themselves kissing in the hospital room moments before their little one arrived.\n\n‚ÄúHere we go again‚Ä¶.again!‚Äù they wrote alongside the sweet snapshot. ‚ÄúWish us luck ü§ûüèº.‚Äù\n\nMurgatroyd revealed her pregnancy news in February, only seven months after giving birth to son Rio.\n\nThe couple conceived while she was four months postpartum, Murgatroyd told her Instagram followers of the ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù addition.\n\n‚ÄúWe Are Having A Baby üéâüôàüôèüèª,‚Äù she captioned her announcement at the time. ‚ÄúYes we know‚Ä¶we just had a baby‚Ä¶ haha! ‚Ä¶ But we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!‚Äù\n\nMurgatroyd concluded, ‚ÄúAfter everything we‚Äôve been through with miscarriages and IVF we‚Äôre beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us. We‚Äôre just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.‚Äù\n\nThe Australian native suffered multiple miscarriages and experienced a failed embryo transfer before welcoming rainbow baby Rio, now 1, in June 2023.\n\nThe little one joined big brother Shai, now 7, who was born in January 2017.\n\nMurgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy used blue confetti poppers to reveal in March that baby No. 3 would also be a boy.\n\nThe then-expectant star called herself a ‚Äúa real-life wolf pack Mumma‚Äù at the time.\n\n‚ÄúMaks and I are beyond happy to have another buddy for Shai and Rio,‚Äù Murgatroyd wrote via Instagram. ‚ÄúWe want them to be the best of friends and thinking about family dinners already makes us laugh!‚Äù\n\nShe and Chmerkovskiy met on Broadway in 2009, but they didn‚Äôt begin dating until three years later once they reunited as ‚ÄúDWTS‚Äù pros.\n\nIn December 2015, the choreographer got down on one knee and proposed to his partner on an episode of the ABC show."
