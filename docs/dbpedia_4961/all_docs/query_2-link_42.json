        "text": "After meeting on the set of Gigli, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez started dating in 2002. They were engaged later that year, but they called off their 2003 wedding shortly before it was scheduled to take place. By January 2004, they were over.\n\nIn May 2021, the pair appeared to have rekindled their romance, 17 years later, after Lopez's split from fiance Alex Rodriguez. They were seen first on a getaway to Montana, and then apparently getting flirty while working out at Anatomy Fitness in Miami. A source told Entertainment Tonight that they were \"not trying to hide their relationship by any means,\" and added, “They stayed close to each other while working out and were hugging, being playful together. It was clear to everyone that they have intense chemistry and were having fun together.”\n\nIn her April 8, 2022, JLo newsletter, the actress confirmed that she and Affleck were once again engaged. In a tearful video message sent to fans, she showed off her ring, saying, \"You're perfect.\"\n\nThe former early 2000s power couple finally went through with their nuptials on July 16, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Marry Me star confirmed the following day via her On the JLo newsletter.\n\n\"We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient. Exactly what we wanted. Last night we flew to Vegas, stood in line for a license with four other couples, all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world,\" JLo wrote in her newsletter. Bennifer tied the knot in a “small” ceremony, with a source telling People, “It was super, super small. They just wanted to be married, so they got married.”\n\nWhile Ben Affleck is an accomplished actor, director, and producer, he initially rose to fame through his role in the 1997 film Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote with his close friend, Matt Damon. The award-winning film earned them both critical acclaim and an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has since starred in several blockbuster films, such as Argo, Gone Girl, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In addition to his relationships with Jennifer Lopez, he has also been linked to Gwyneth Paltrow and was married to Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares three children.\n\nJennifer Lopez started dating Alex Rodriguez in late 2016. The pair were engaged on March 9, 2019.\n\nThere had been reports in March 2021 that the two had split, but they took to TMZ to clarify, saying they were still together, but were working on things. Split rumors initially came after A-Rod was linked to Southern Charm's Madison LeCroy during the show's season 7 reunion. He denied any wrongdoing, however.\n\nIn April 2021, the pair released a statement to the Today show that they had ended their engagement, because they were \"better off as friends.\"\n\nAlex Rodriguez, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players of all time, enjoyed a successful career with the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, and Texas Rangers. As a 14-time All-Star and three-time MVP, Rodriguez has cemented his place in baseball history. Off the field, he has ventured into various business and television endeavors, such as his role as a broadcaster for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. Prior to his relationship with Jennifer Lopez, Rodriguez was married to Cynthia Scurtis, with whom he shares two daughters, and has also been romantically linked to stars like Madonna and Kate Hudson.\n\nIn late 2016, rumors began swirling that Jennifer Lopez and Canadian rapper Drake were enjoying a fling, after they were spotted cozying up together at various events. The pair first met backstage at one of their respective concerts, and soon after, Drake attended her Las Vegas residency show, \"All I Have,\" igniting speculation about their connection. While they never officially confirmed their romance, the duo shared several photos on social media showcasing their undeniable chemistry. However, their relationship was short-lived, as by early 2017, they seemingly went their separate ways.\n\nDrake, born Aubrey Graham, initially rose to fame as an actor on the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. However, he's best known for his illustrious rap career, with multiple chart-topping albums and singles under his belt, such as \"Views,\" \"Take Care,\" and \"Hotline Bling.\" As one of the best-selling and most influential artists of his generation, Drake has successfully made the transition from actor to rap superstar. In addition to his reported romance with Jennifer Lopez, the rapper has been linked to high-profile celebrities including Rihanna and Serena Williams.\n\nFollowing her split from Casper Smart, Jennifer Lopez was briefly linked to Dancing with the Stars pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy in 2014. The pair initially met at the 2013 American Music Awards, where they collaborated on a performance together. Despite their close friendship and apparent chemistry, both insisted that their relationship was strictly platonic. Nevertheless, fans couldn't help but speculate about the nature of their connection, as they were often spotted enjoying each other's company at various events and social gatherings.\n\nBorn in Ukraine, Maksim Chmerkovskiy is best known for his work as a professional dancer and choreographer on the hit reality competition series Dancing with the Stars. With more than fifteen seasons under his belt, Chmerkovskiy has become one of the show's most recognizable and beloved figures. Additionally, he and his brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, co-own a successful chain of dance studios, Dance With Me. Maksim married fellow Dancing with the Stars pro Peta Murgatroyd in 2017, and the couple welcomed their first child together the same year."
