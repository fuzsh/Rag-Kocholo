        "text": "Kirstie Alley is putting past tensions behind her and sending well wishes to her former Dancing With the Stars partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy.\n\nAlley, who has been cast as a series regular on the second season of Scream Queens, welcomed ET to the set of the hit Fox horror comedy and shared a sweet message to Chmerkovskiy's future tiny dancer.\n\n\"I hear he's having a baby – Congratulations,\" the Cheers alum said when asked if she still keeps in touch with Chmerkovskiy and the rest of the DWTS family.\n\nIt was confirmed back in May that Chmerkovskiy and his fiancée, fellow pro dancer Peta Murgatroyd, are expecting their first child together.\n\nMORE: Kirstie Alley is Joining 'Scream Queens' in 'Brilliant and Devious' New Role\n\nAlley and Chmerkovskiy formed a close bond in the ballroom when they danced together on both season 12 and season 15 of Dancing With the Stars, but the 36-year-old dancing professional later revealed that he and Alley had a major falling out.\n\n\"I thought we had a great relationship,\" Chemrkovskiy told host Andy Cohen when he appeared on an episode of Watch What Happens Live in 2014, \"And if it was something else or not, I don't know. But I got a message that now that I'm associating with other people that she can't be associated with, I am no longer to be spoken with, and sorry, but that is what it is ... but I still think the world of her and I wish her the best.\"\n\nDETIALS: Maksim Chmerkovskiy Explains Why He's No Longer Friends with Kirstie Alley\n\nChmerkovskiy added that he believes Alley's faith in the Church of Scientology might have had something to do with the demise of their friendship. \"She stopped getting along with me,\" he laughed. \"I think the world of her. I'm not judging people by their religion. ... I'm Jewish, and you know, I don't really believe in science fiction, but whatever. We had a great relationship.\"\n\nAlley fired back at Chmerkovskiy's comments by taking to Twitter. \"Dear Sir..after you have a** raped me there is really no reason to include 'I wish you the best'.. It's rhetorical,\" she posted to her fans in August 2014.\n\nBut the Look Who's Talking star is no longer fixating on past dancing feuds. In fact, Alley admitted she's not even watching DWTS this season. \"There's another show that's in competition with [DWTS] that I've sort of gotten hooked on: The Voice,\" she said.\n\nRELATED: Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd Expecting First Child!\n\n\"This is why I like The Voice: They're creative, and they're nice, and they're supportive, and they validate everyone whether they're good or bad,\" she gushed. \"I just love that vibe of following power and validation to artists. I think it's so valuable to them! Other shows that have competitive singing and stuff like that -- It's just catty and I don't like that.\"\n\nWhen asked if she missed preparing for those elaborate DWTS dances, the 64-year-old actress was quick to disagree. \"I don't miss the rehearsals at all!\" she said with a laugh. \"Again, I was so out of my element. It was so inhibiting .. But you don't really realize how hard you're worked when you do that. It's pretty phenomenal.\n\n\"I'm shocked that people don't die on the show,\" she added with a laugh. \"I was considering myself like, 'Am I going to be the first one that dies on Dancing With the Stars?' Because it's so physical, it's crazy!\"\n\nAlley may not have died on DWTS, but there's no telling if she'll survive season two of Scream Queens!\n\nScream Queens airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Fox.\n\nRelated Articles"
