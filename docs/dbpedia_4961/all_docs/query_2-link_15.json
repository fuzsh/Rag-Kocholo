        "text": "There’s planners, and then there’s JoJo Siwa. In a recent interview, the 20-year-old singer/dancer revealed that she already has her future mapped out to a T when it comes to her plans for motherhood, from baby names to a sperm donor.\n\nSitting down with Access Hollywood, Siwa got on the topic of kids when she revealed that she has two tattoos in honor of her future babies — of which she hopes to have three. “This one’s dedicated to my baby girl one day; her name is Freddie,” she said, pointing to some ink on her arm. “Then this is dedicated to twin boys: Eddie and Teddie.”\n\n“Freddie, Eddie and Teddie,” she continued. “I want three babies. I’ve got a sperm donor lined up.”\n\nThe Dance Moms alum’s left arm is decked out with black tattoos. During her recent stay in Florida, Siwa acquired some new ink, per a Feb. 28 post on her Instagram.\n\nIn January, it was announced that Siwa would replace Nigel Lythgoe on So You Think You Can Dance for season 18. The 74-year-old judge stepped down from the panel after Paula Abdul sued him over claims he sexually assaulted her twice, both of which he denies. In addition to Abdul’s claims, a pair of unnamed contestants on “AAG” — which is believed to be a reference to the reality series All American Girl — came forward earlier this month with accusations that Lythgoe made unwanted sexual advances and groped them inside his Los Angeles home in 2003.\n\nThe new season of the dance competition series premieres March 4 and will feature Allison Holker and Maksim Chmerkovskiy as Siwa’s co-judges. “FINALLY!…. ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ is coming to FOX this summer and I am so grateful that I am going to be a judge!” the “Boomerang” singer wrote on Instagram following the news. “It’s such an honor to be a part of this shows come back!!!”\n\nWatch Siwa discuss her plans for motherhood below."
