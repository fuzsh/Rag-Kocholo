        "text": "MAKS Chmerkovskiy has shared an update on how his wife, Peta Murgatroyd, is faring during her pregnancy with their third child.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun, the Dancing With the Stars alum, 44, revealed that Peta, 37, is having a more difficult time than she did carrying their other kids as she nears her due date.\n\nMaks and Peta announced in February via an Instagram post that they're expecting again - eight months after welcoming their second child, a son, Rio.\n\nThey are also parents to son Shai Aleksander, whom they welcomed in January 2017.\n\nDuring the sit-down, Maks gushed over becoming a dad for the third time despite he and Peta not expecting to have another child so soon.\n\n\"We were told a long time ago when we started to have kids that it's easier when they're close in age because of schooling and clothing and stuff like that,\" the Traitors star said before explaining how the bonding time with his oldest son for so many years as an only child strengthened their relationship.\n\nFATHER-SON BONDING\n\n\"To be honest with you, we had an incredible time with Shai, our firstborn, and we got, again, stuck in a pandemic with a 3-year-old... putting a lot of time into just that one person.\n\n\"So our relationship with Shai as a mom, dad and son is very, very tight because it was built on all attention to this one,\" Maks noted.\n\nThe Ukrainian dancer then shared that he hopes to create the same type of closeness with his two younger kiddos, even though his attention will be divided.\n\n\"I want to find the same way of establishing these connections and relationships with a tribe of people in the house. We'll figure it out. They're a lot of fun,\" the TV star added.\n\nHowever, as Maks and Peta get closer to delivering their baby boy, the Broadway star admitted that his former DWTS co-star isn't doing as well as she had in her previous pregnancies.\n\n\"Peta's having a tough time right now. She's [nearing the] finish line already, and [her belly is] very heavy for her body and for her frame. You know, this kid is a big one,\" Maks told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Shai was a certain weight and height. Our second baby, Rio, is bigger by all sorts of standard measurements and all that. This kid, this third one, is supposed to be the biggest. I feel bad for Peta,\" the reality star confessed.\n\nPeta's exact due date is unknown, but Maks revealed he doesn't plan to slow down his busy work schedule after the baby's birth.\n\n\"For us, time off is like time off from what? We have an incredible life and have all these amazing opportunities. And we're not tired yet,\" the performer exclaimed.\n\n\"We're young. We have a lot of goals. We're motivated by this very young sort of building family. We have a lot of energy still. We don't feel like, 'Hey, let's go take a long vacation.'\n\n\"And again, I'm speaking for both of us. But I think that the period of time we're in now is when we should be moving.\n\n\"We should be energetic. We should be taking on opportunities. Even though we are about balancing our crazy amount of kids and dependents and all that, but everybody does it, so it's possible,\" the Tetya KAPA Vodka founder closed.\n\nPeta initially broke the news of her pregnancy to fans by posting a video of her sharing her pregnancy test result with Maks via Facetime.\n\nShe mentioned in her caption that the TV personalities had gone through miscarriages and IVF before building their brood and called baby number three a \"miracle.\"\n\nIn their video chat, Maks expressed the same joy as he tearfully told his wife, \"I'm so… I'm very happy.\"\n\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\n\nFans are familiar with the Hollywood couple as they were both professional dancers on DWTS before Maks left the show in 2017.\n\nMaks' brother, Val, and his sister-in-law, Jenna Johnson, 30, also starred in the former ABC series.\n\nPeta returned to the show last year just two and a half months after giving birth to Rio and competed with Brady Bunch alum Barry Williams, 69."
