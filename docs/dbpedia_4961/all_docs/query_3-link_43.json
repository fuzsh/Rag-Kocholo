        "text": "The Traitors' Maksim Chmerkovskiy has a very adorable reason to celebrate these days. Maks and his wife, Peta Murgatroyd, have revealed that they are expecting baby No. 3.\n\nPeta Murgatroyd pregnant with baby No. 3\n\nPeta shared the news that she is pregnant again on Instagram on Monday, Feb. 5, writing, \"Yes we know…we just had a baby… haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\"\n\nShe added, \"Surprising [Maks] on this FaceTime with my two friends secretly filming from different angles made it all the more hilarious. It took one hour for me to get the courage to call him and when he wasn’t catching on we all couldn’t stop laughing in the kitchen... After everything we’ve been through with miscarriages and IVF we’re beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us. We’re just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.\"\n\nHere's What You May Have Missed on Bravo:\n\n\"Y'all Came to Our House to Play\": Tamra, Larsa, Shereé & Phaedra Talk The Traitors Fashion & Competition\n\nSurprise!

But, he's always been excited for fatherhood. Back in 2017, The Daily Dish spoke to Maks as he and Peta were expecting their first child at the time and he gushed about how excited he was to become a dad, sharing, \" I can't wait for all of this, diapers, and all of this stuff.\"\n\nPeta Murgatroyd's kids with Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nThe dance pros are already parents to Shai, 7, as well as Rio, who was born in 2023.\n\nThe family has recently celebrated another one of their loved ones when Maks and Peta posted a sweet birthday tribute to their family dog. \"Our boy is one years old!!!\" he shared last month. \"We can’t believe how fast this year went but we’re so grateful that you chose us to be your family! Thank you for leaving your little footprints on our souls! We love you very much. Happy birthday little Hachi!\"\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy on Peacock's The Traitors Season 2\n\nWhile we wait for more sweet updates on Maks and his family, make sure you tune into Season 2 of Peacock's The Traitors.
