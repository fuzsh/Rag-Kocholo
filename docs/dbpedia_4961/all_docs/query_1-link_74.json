The new dad announced that Shai Aleksander Chmerkovskiy was born early on Wednesday.\n\nMurgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy met in 2009 when they both danced in a Broadway production of Burn the Floor and got engaged in 2015. Chmerkovskiy said in October that he's leaving the show to be a full-time dad. It's the first child for both.\n\nThey're wise to not hyphenate the baby's name. Shai Aleksander Chmerkovskiy-Murgatroyd would be too much."
