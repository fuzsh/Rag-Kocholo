        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd is giving an update on life at home with her and Maksim Chmerkovskiy's newborn son, Rio.\n\nOn Monday, the Dancing With the Stars alum took to her Instagram Story to give her followers some insight on how things have been at home since the arrival of their second child.\n\n\"I'm finally back, well back on and off,\" Peta told the camera as she nursed Rio. \"I haven't been giving daily updates because I'm just like 'ah'...like trying to figure out everything and everyone and life is good. It's amazing. Little Rio is so sweet, oh my god. This kid has my heart. He is eating, sleeping and pooping all day long. That's all we do obviously. I am here most of the time or I'm out there on the couch or I'm in the kitchen trying to make a quick bite to eat, but it's all that beautiful newborn stage.\"\n\nThe professional dancer shared that her baby boy is two weeks old and she was filming the video as she was getting ready to take him to the doctor's office for his first appointment. Peta, 36, also apologized to the folks that she hasn't had the time to reach out to, promising them, \"I will get back to you.\"\n\nPeta told her followers that she is working on finding the balance of spending time with Rio but also making sure she is getting in time with her and Maks' 6-year-old son, Shai.\n\n\"They say from one to two is, like, a lot and I don't feel it's, like, overwhelmingly a lot, but it's just, like, you have to prioritize right now,\" she shared. \"I'm really making sure that I have everything done for Rio for, like, bedtime by a certain time, so I can literally just be with Shai. I can just be in his room reading him books, putting him to bed, doing our usual bedtime routine, so he feels like he's got me for that one-on one-time which I love. I know he really appreciates that and loves that.\"\n\nIn addition to her update, Peta told her followers that she is looking forward to sharing the story behind Rio's delivery.\n\n\"I'm dying just to tell you the story of how I got to the hospital, what happened when I got there, like, everything,\" she teased. \"Let's just put it this way, I was one of those women holding onto the counters between each contraction having to give my insurance card. I could barely talk. Anyway, it's a great story. Maks obviously got there on time, but it was wild.\"\n\nPeta and Maks also got a visit from Rio's aunt and uncle. Jenna Johnson took to her Instagram Stories to share that she came to see the baby along with husband Val Chmerkovskiy, who brought their 12-month-old son, Rome, to meet his baby cousin.\n\n\"Got to see my @petamurgatroyd,\" Johnson wrote, along with a group photo of the happy family. \"I've missed her so much and so happy to see her thriving as a mommy to another beautiful baby boy.\"\n\nPeta and Maks announced they welcomed their second child last month.\n\n\"üíô Rio John Chmerkovskiy üíô Born ~ 6.18.2023 8.6 oz and thriving! We are overjoyed to share our baby boy with all of you. @shai.aleksander is already the best big brother and we all feel very complete ü•π Life is good XO,\" they wrote alongside a picture of their newborn son.\n\nShortly after introducing their baby boy to the world, Peta celebrated his arrival with a video from her labor and delivery.\n\n\"Happy Birthday Sweet Rio üíô,\" the mommy of two wrote. \"What a wild ride!!! With a midnight car race into the hospital not knowing if @maksimc will make it or not, to the many hours of laboring down Mr Rio until he was in the perfect place to push him out with 4 pushes‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶he‚Äôs here and he‚Äôs HEAVEN ‚ú® There was a moment after the birth where I looked at my mum and said ‚Äúdid you text dad?‚Äù ‚Ä¶I welled up with tears as I realized I‚Äôd forgotten he was gone. It was a moment for me. I knew I felt his spirit there and I know he will be looking down and protecting all of us here. Thank god @maksimc made it in time üôèüèª He drove from Napa Valley to West Hollywood in 4.5 hours LOL.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPeta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Reveal Name of Their New Baby\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd Welcome Baby No. 2\n\nPregnant Peta Murgatroyd Revisits Past Miscarriages in Emotional Video"
