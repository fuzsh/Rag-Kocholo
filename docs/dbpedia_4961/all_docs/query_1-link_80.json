        "text": "Since joining Dancing with the Stars during its sophomore season, Maksim Chmerkovskiy has become one of the most recognizable pros to grace the dance floor. He even won a Mirrorball trophy during Season 18 when he competed with Olympic ice dancer Meryl Davis. Currently he's vying for gold with Amber Rose, but win or lose, when Season 24 debuts in 2017, don't expect to see him hitting the set.\n\n\"Honestly I feel like going on the record and saying two things,\" he exclusively told The Daily Dish. \"First of all, like I've already said, I'm having the best time of my life on Dancing with the Stars. It's a known fact. I've said it. I was quoted as saying the production is on point. I feel the love. I feel like everybody's so friendly [and] we all work for the same goal, [which] is to keep dancing in television and produce a beautiful show. Having said that, I'm telling you right now I have zero interest in coming back as a dancer [next season].\"\n\nMaks has stepped away from the show before. He took a break between seasons 15 and 18. Following season 18, he took a second hiatus until this current season. He cites the show being \"uberstressful\" as one of the reasons he's contemplating another break. Well that, and the fact that he and fianc√©e/fellow pro dancer Peta Murgatroyd will soon be parents and newlyweds. They plan to wed in the summer 2017.\n\n\"I'm going to have a newborn baby. I have zero want to do this. I promise you that,\" he said.\"It's been it for me two years ago. I never thought I'd be back here in this position. I'm glad I am. I promise, I'm so glad that I made this decision. But like I said [I'm] looking forward. The baby comes in January and then a month-and-a-half later I would have to be in L.A. to start training with somebody else. Trust me, I really don't care how this comes across, but there's no money on the planet that can replace me missing out the three, four, five months of my baby's life. Zero chance. I can't wait for all of this, diapers, and all of this stuff. I cant wait for Peta to pursue her goals and whatever and I just want to be a stay-at-home dad.\"\n\nCheck out throwback photos of Maks, below."
