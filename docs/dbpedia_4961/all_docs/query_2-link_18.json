        "text": "The Traitors is winning over viewers in a major way — and, unlike the contestants on the hit series where reality show stars compete for a grand prize while trying to weed out traitors in their midsts, Peacock didn’t need to do any deception in order to get the show to become the No. 1 unscripted series in the United States.\n\nRELATED: Who Are the Traitors in Season 2 of Peacock's Hit Competition Series?\n\nThe Traitors has become the No. 1 unscripted series in the U.S. across all streaming platforms, according to Nielsen, the company that tracks viewership for TV and streaming series. NBCUniversal announced the news in a press release on Thursday.\n\nSeason 2 of The Traitors, which could be described as a reality show-spin on the party game Mafia, made its debut on Peacock on Jan. 12, once more hosted by Alan Cumming. The sophomore season premiere was Peacock’s most-watched reality series debut, with streams up 75 percent compared to the first season, which debuted on the same day a year prior.\n\nRELATED: Where to Watch The Traitors: Postmortem After Show for All the Gory, Behind-the-Scenes Details\n\nDuring its first full week of availability on Peacock, Season 2 of The Traitors ranked ninth for overall minutes viewed of an original series. Notably, this marks the first time that two Peacock series have been in the top 10 of this list. In addition to The Traitors taking the No. 9 spot, Ted, the Seth McFarlane-led prequel series about a loveable, foul-mouthed teddy bear, ranks at No. 5. Ted was Peacock’s most-watched original title during the first two weeks it premiered.\n\nRELATED: Where to Watch Seth MacFarlane's Ted Prequel Series"
