Welcome to the world Milan!!!\"\n\nEarlier on the same day, the TV personalities had announced the arrival of their third bundle of joy, sharing a snapshot of themselves with the newborn.\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd‚Äôs Relationship Timeline: ‚ÄòDWTS‚Äô to Marriage and More\n\n\"He is officially evicted from his mom and he is sooooo cute!!!!\" Chmerkovskiy shared via Instagram.\n\n\"Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!\" the proud dad continued. \"Also thank you all for the beautiful messages we have been receiving. Means a lot and very much appreciated.\"\n\nJust hours before Murgatroyd gave birth, Chmerkovskiy exclusively spoke to Us Weekly on the red carpet of the 2024 ESPY Awards at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, where he expressed his readiness to rush to the hospital if his wife went into labor.\n\n\"We‚Äôre excited,\" Chmerkovskiy shared. \"The first one was like an out-of-body experience. The second was stress about doing it right. This one is exciting. I want him to come out. I want us to be done and complete and move on.\"\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd‚Äôs Sweetest Moments With Sons Shai and Rio: Family Pics\n\nMurgatroyd had announced her pregnancy in February, mere months after welcoming son Rio.\n\n\"We Are Having A Baby üéâüôàüôèüèª Yes we know‚Ä¶we just had a baby‚Ä¶ haha!\" she revealed via Instagram. \"This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\"\n\nThe couple first crossed paths on Broadway in 2009 and later reconnected on Dancing With the Stars, sparking a romance in 2012. Their engagement followed in December 2015 during an onstage performance, and they officially tied the knot in July 2017 with a dual celebration: a small ceremony at City Hall and a grand 300-guest reception in New York City."
