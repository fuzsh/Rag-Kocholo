        "text": "Early life and career\n\nChmerkovskiy was born in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, in what was then the Soviet Union. His parents are Aleksandr \"Sasha\" Chmerkovskiy and Larisa Chmerkovskaya. His older brother, Maksim Chmerkovskiy (born 1980), is also a professional dancer who appears on Dancing with the Stars. His father is Jewish and his mother is Christian.\n\nThe family moved to the United States in 1994. In 1996, Maksim and Sasha opened a youth-oriented dance studio in New Jersey, and Valentin was one of the students. In 2001, Valentin and partner Diana Olonetskaya, 15, became the first American dance team to win a world junior championship title.\n\nChmerkovskiy is a co-owner of nine social dance studios under the brand \"Dance With Me\". Six are in the New York metropolitan area (Glen Rock and Fort Lee in New Jersey, Glen Cove, Long Island, SoHo, Manhattan, Midtown, Manhattan and Stamford, Connecticut). The three other studios are located in Southlake, Texas, The Woodlands, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada. Previously one was in Sherman Oaks, California, but has since changed ownership.\n\nDancing with the Stars\n\nChmerkovskiy first appeared on season 2, February 10, 2006, as a student of his brother during Week 6. The students were: Valentin & Valeriya Kozharinova, Sergei Onik & Michelle Glazarov and Boris Leokumovich & Nicole Volynets. The couples performed two numbers.\n\nChmerkovskiy then appeared once again on season 4 results show on May 8, 2007.

They made it to the finals and finished in third place.\n\nFor season 25, he is partnered with former Paralympic swimmer Victoria Arlen.\n\nCoincidentally, Val has had exactly the same outcome in his first four seasons on Dancing with the Stars as his older brother Maksim had on his first four seasons on the show; eliminated before the finals on his first two seasons, third place on his third, and the runner-up on his fourth season.\n\nVal shares a record originally set by Mark Ballas of having the most celebrity partners (three) to never individually score less than 8 from any judge. He is also the only professional to go three consecutive seasons without ever scoring less than an eight (16, 17, 18) with Zendaya, Elizabeth Berkley Lauren & Danica McKellar.\n\nVal and his season 19 partner Janel Parrish hold the record for the earliest perfect score, receiving it during week 3 (matched by Bethany Mota & Derek Hough later in the same show).\n\nWith celebrity partner Elizabeth Berkley Lauren (Average: 26.5)\n\nWeek 4 Score was given by guest judge Julianne Hough.\n\nWeek 8 Score was given by guest judge Cher.\n\nWith celebrity partner Danica McKellar (Average: 26.3)\n\n1Additional score of Week 3 was given by Robin Roberts\n\n2For this week only, as part of the \"Partner Switch-Up\", Danica McKellar did not perform with Chmerkovskiy and instead performed with Maksim Chmerkovskiy; Chmerkovskiy performed Argentine Tango with Meryl Davis and received scores of 10/9/10/10\n\n3Additional score of Week 4 was given by Julianne Hough\n\n4Additional score of Week 5 was given by Donny Osmond\n\n5Additional score of Week 6 was given by Redfoo\n\n6Additional score of Week 7 was given by Ricky Martin\n\n7Additional score of Week 8 was given by Abby Lee Miller\n\nWith celebrity partner Janel Parrish (Average: 36.5 )\n\n1 Score given by guest judge Kevin Hart in place of Goodman.\n\n2The American public scored the dance in place of Goodman with the averaged score being counted alongside the three other judges.\n\n3This week only, for \"Partner Switch-Up\" week, Parrish performed with Artem Chigvintsev instead of Chmerkovskiy.

Chmerkovskiy deleted the post."
