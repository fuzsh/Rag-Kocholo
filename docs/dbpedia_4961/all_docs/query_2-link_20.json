        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd is taking full advantage of the preggo life!\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars pro is expecting her first child with fianc√©e Maksim Chmerkovskiy, and during last night's Entertainment Weekly's pre-Emmys shindig, she caught up with E! News on all things life as a mama-to-be.\n\nWhen asked if she's experienced any particular cravings in the first six months of her pregnancy, Peta told us she's struck quite a balance between sweet and savory treats. \"I really crave cold ice cream for anytime of the day. I could wake up and have it for breakfast, which I have a couple of times,\" she revealed.\n\nIce cream before noon? Sign us up!\n\nThe 30-year-old added, \"Apart from the ice cream, this month has been pretty good [when it comes to unhealthy cravings.] The past months, I was craving pickles and vinegar.\"\n\nChmerkovskiy then chimed in, \"She would make a crazy concoction with olive oil, vinegar, and salt to eat. It made her feel good.\"\n\nPeta's pregnancy isn't all late-night food binges, though. In fact, the reality competition star hasn't let her growing baby bump get in the way of hitting the gym. She's documented her \"fit mom\" lifestyle on Instagram, sharing quite a few videos of herself working up a sweat since getting pregnant.\n\nOf her fitness routine, she admitted to us, \"I do Pilates three times a week. Honestly, you have to keep fit and keep trying to do what you did before but with moderation.\"\n\nAnd as for any names the couple is mulling over for their baby boy, Peta and Maksim have one picked out, but they're lips are sealed.\n\n\"We want one that is meaningful,\" Maks admitted. \"The biggest thing is something that isn't going to get made fun of. We love the name Gabriel but I hate the nickname Gabe and he'd be called that all the time.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Peta has three more months to keep snacking for two!"
