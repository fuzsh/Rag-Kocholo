Maksim shared, “Birth details later but for now we wanted to let you all know that mom and baby are doing perfect, and delivery took around 47 seconds total! Exactly one push!”\n\nMaksim showed some appreciation for the love and support, writing, “Means a lot and very much appreciated.”\n\nThe parents followed up with a second post revealing their little one's name, Milan Maksim Chmerkovskiy.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nA day before their son’s arrival, Maksim attended the 2024 ESPYs, telling People magazine that he was prepared to “run” if there were any signs that she was about to give birth.\n\n“If you see me run fast here at some point, that means it’s go time,” he noted.\n\nOf his birthing plan, Chmerkovskiy added, “When she calls, I’m gonna hang up, because she knows I’m here, and if she calls the second time, right away, we have a plan where I’m in the car calling her back.”\n\nIn February, the couple announced that they were expecting again.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeta Murgatroyd & Maksim Chmerkovskiy Expecting Baby #3\n\nView Story\n\nIn a video, Peta FaceTimed Maksim to tell him she was pregnant. Maksim was shocked by the news, saying, “Babe, stop, no way, you’re pregnant?” He couldn’t contain his emotions, even saying he was “tearing up.”\n\nShe wrote on Instagram, “Surpising @maksimc on this FaceTime with my two friends secretly filming from different angles made it all the more hilarious. It took one hour for me to get the courage to call him 😂 and when he wasn’t catching on we all couldn’t stop laughing in the kitchen. I had the ‘I’m so sick story’ the pickle and 2 bottles HAHA! Oh Maks 🥴.”\n\nShe added, “Yes we know…we just had a baby… haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are sooooo happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!”"
