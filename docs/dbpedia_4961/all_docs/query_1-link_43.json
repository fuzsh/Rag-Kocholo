        "text": "Poet. Dancer. Immigrant. Artist. Son. Brother. There’s always more than meets the eye . . .\n\nValentin “Val” Chmerkovskiy has captivated viewers with his striking performances on Dancing with the Stars since his first step, season after season. His raw talent, dashing looks, and genuine kindness have made him an instant, beloved star. Now, for the first time ever, viewers will have an all-access pass to Val’s life - and in I’ll Never Change My Name, Val bares his soul, illuminating the thoughtful person he is both on and off the stage.\n\nIn this revealing memoir, Val opens up about his life and career so far - where he’s come from and where he hopes to go. He shows the reader some of the most notable moments from his childhood in Odessa, Ukraine, and his tight-knit family’s immigration to the United States - including his struggles learning English as a stranger desperate to fit into a different culture, how he worked to become a premiere ballroom dancer, and, of course, the collaborations and competitions with his brother and fellow DWTS sensation, Maksim “Maks” Chmerkovskiy.\n\nAfter years of practice and discipline, Val, along with his older brother Maks, have reached the pinnacle of success, but it took a great deal of hard work and gratitude to get there. Sharing at times intimate and at times entertaining moments with early dance partners all the way up through celebrity dance partners such as Laurie Hernandez, Zendaya, Kelly Monaco, and Rumer Willis on Dancing with the Stars, Val expresses his enduring gratitude for the opportunities America has afforded him and his family, and for everything this country represents - offering hope not only to fans, but everyone with a dream.\n\nInspiring, heartfelt, and compulsively readable - including sixteen pages of never-\n\nbefore-seen photographs, as well as a foreword by brother Maks Chmerkovskiy - I’ll Never Change My Name is filled with Val’s honesty and insight, and moments that are sure to touch readers’ hearts and inspire us all to keep it moving."
