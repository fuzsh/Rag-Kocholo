        "text": "The Traitors Season 2 is the second season of The Traitors (US). Just like its predecessor, it is released on NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock, with the first three episodes released on January 12, 2024, and then new episodes weekly at 9pm ET on Thursdays.\n\nBackground[]\n\nAfter the success of Season 1, a series renewal was officially announced on February 2, 2023.[1] Although the plan was initially to continue with the first season's theme of celebrities vs. civilians, applications for civilian participants were soon closed, as production decided to shift towards a cast of all reality TV veterans.\n\nAfter months of speculation and the names of various reality stalwarts thrown around, the finalised cast was flown to the UK between September 19 to 20, 2023. The first officially confirmed contestants were Real Housewife Larsa Pippen and her boyfriend Marcus Jordan.[2] Peacock later confirmed the full cast list, including many speculated names (and surprises such as Love Island UK winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and former British politician John Bercow) on September 21, 2023.[3] Alan Cumming's dog Lala was also announced as his sidekick for the season, with an order for 11 episodes and a reunion special.[4] The first trailer dropped on December 14, 2023, alongside the official launch date of January 12, 2024 - exactly a year after Season 1.\n\nAftershows[]\n\nThe new season included an official after-show, The Traitors: Postmortem, featuring “additional footage and interviews with eliminated contestants”. It will be uploaded onto both Peacock and its YouTube channel.[5]\n\nEpisode Titles[]\n\nUnlike most international editions of the show, the US edition gives each episode non-generic titles.\n\nEpisode Title 1 Betrayers, Fakes and Fraudsters 2 Welcome to the Dark Side 3 Murder in Plain Sight 4 The Funeral 5 A Killer Move 6 Backstab and Betrayal 7 Blood on Their Hands 8 Knives at Dawn 9 A Game of Death 10 The Weight of Deceit 11 One Final Hurdle 12 Reunion\n\nUnique Characteristics & Twists[]\n\nPre-existing Relationship: Dating couple Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan were cast on the show together, competing as individual contestants.\n\nEarly Recruitment: On top of committing a Murder on their first night, the Traitors were also allowed to Recruit a Faithful from the start of the game onwards, before any Traitors were Banished.\n\nArmoury Removal: Shields were no longer given out at random through Armoury visits; instead, contestants had the chance to go for Shields during Challenges.\n\nMurder in Plain Sight: At the end of Episode 3, there was no Traitor's conclave. Instead, the Traitors had to retrieve a Poisoned Chalice from a book and persuade a Faithful to drink from it before midnight, in order to Murder them.\n\nMid-Game Intruder: In Episode 5, at the start of the Roundtable, Kate Chastain was introduced as a surprise new contestant.\n\nThe Sacrifice: In Episode 7, there was no Banishment. Instead, Alan called the group to a firepit and told them they would be shortlisting potential candidates to be Murdered that night. The Shield holders would initiate a chain of safety by granting immunity to Murder a contestant of their choice; that contestant would then select the next contestant to grant immunity to, until a total of five contestants remained unchosen. They would be the Sacrificed, eligible to be Murdered.\n\nTraitors' Ultimatum: At the end of Episode 8, there was only one Traitor left. They had the option of offering an Ultimatum to a Faithful of their choice, who would either be obliged to accept Recruitment or be Murdered otherwise.\n\nCast[]\n\nThe cast was comprised of 22 celebrities, with a mix of veterans from both competitive (e.g. The Challenge and Survivor) and non-competitive (e.g. The Real Housewives and Bling Empire) reality shows, as well as a few high-profile names like boxer Deontay Wilder and British ex-Speaker John Bercow.\n\nWinner: Faithful\n\nCT\n\nWinner: Faithful\n\nTrishelle\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nMJ\n\nBanished: Traitor\n\nKate\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nSandra\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nShereé\n\nBanished: Traitor\n\nPhaedra\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nJohn\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nPeter\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nKevin\n\nBanished: Traitor\n\nParvati\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nBergie\n\nBanished: Traitor\n\nDan\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nJanelle\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nTamra\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nLarsa\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nEkin-Su\n\nQuit: Faithful\n\nDeontay\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nMaks\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nMarcus\n\nBanished: Faithful\n\nPeppermint\n\nMurdered: Faithful\n\nBananas\n\nName Occupation/\n\nNotable For Faction Result Exit Episode Finish\n\nCT Tamburello The Real World Faithful Winner Episode 11 1st\n\nTrishelle Cannatella The Real World Faithful Winner Episode 11 1st\n\nMJ Javid Shahs of Sunset Faithful Banished Episode 11 3rd\n\nKate Chastain Below Deck Traitor (from Episode 9)\n\nFaithful (Episodes 5-8) Banished Episode 11 4th\n\nSandra Diaz-Twine Survivor Faithful Banished Episode 11 5th\n\nShereé Whitfield The Real Housewives of Atlanta Faithful Murdered Episode 11 6th\n\nPhaedra Parks The Real Housewives of Atlanta Traitor Banished Episode 10 7th\n\nJohn Bercow Former Speaker of the British House of Commons Faithful Murdered Episode 10 8th\n\nPeter Weber The Bachelorette Faithful Banished Episode 10 9th\n\nKevin Kreider Bling Empire Faithful Murdered Episode 9 10th\n\nParvati Shallow Survivor Traitor (from Episode 2)\n\nFaithful (Episode 1) Banished Episode 8 11th\n\nBergie Bergersen Love Island USA Faithful Murdered Episode 8 12th\n\nDan Gheesling Big Brother US Traitor Banished Episode 6 13th\n\nJanelle Pierzina Big Brother US Faithful Banished Episode 5 14th\n\nTamra Judge The Real Housewives of Orange County Faithful Murdered Episode 5 15th\n\nLarsa Pippen The Real Housewives of Miami Faithful Banished Episode 4 16th\n\nEkin-Su Cülcüloğlu Love Island UK Faithful Murdered Episode 4 17th\n\nDeontay Wilder Boxer Faithful Quit Episode 4 18th\n\nMaks Chmerkovskiy Dancing with the Stars Faithful Banished Episode 3 19th\n\nMarcus Jordan Basketball player Faithful Murdered Episode 3 20th\n\nPeppermint RuPaul's Drag Race Faithful Banished Episode 2 21st\n\nJohnny Bananas The Real World Faithful Murdered Episode 2 22nd\n\nVoting History[]\n\nEpisode 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-10 10 11 Traitors'\n\nDecision N.A.\n\nBananas Parvati Marcus Ekin-Su[v 1] Tamra Bergie Peter Bergie Kate Kevin John Shereé N.A.\n\nFinale Banishment N.A.\n\nPeppermint Maks Larsa Janelle Dan N.A.\n\n[v 2] Parvati Peter Phaedra Sandra Banish Again Kate Banish Again Tie[v 3] MJ Finish Vote N.A.\n\n17-2-1 10-2-2-2-1-1 8-4-1-1-1 9-5 11-1-1 7-4 5-4 6-1 4-1 3-1 3-1 2-1 1-1-1 2-1 1 CT No Vote Peppermint Maks Larsa Janelle Dan John Parvati Phaedra Phaedra Sandra Banish Again Kate Banish Again MJ MJ Winner Trishelle No Vote\n\nPeppermint Maks Larsa Dan Dan No Vote\n\nPhaedra Phaedra Phaedra Sandra Banish Again Kate Banish Again CT MJ Winner 3 MJ John Dan Kevin Janelle Dan Parvati Peter Phaedra Sandra Banish Again Kate End Game Trishelle Trishelle 4 Kate Janelle[v 4] Dan Parvati Peter Phaedra Sandra End Game Trishelle 5 Sandra No Vote\n\nPeppermint Maks Larsa Janelle Dan Shereé Parvati Peter Phaedra Kate 6 Shereé Peppermint Janelle John Janelle Dan Phaedra Parvati Peter Phaedra Murdered 7 Phaedra Peppermint Ekin-Su Kevin Janelle Dan CT Parvati Peter CT 8 John Peppermint Maks Kevin Dan Dan Peter Parvati Phaedra Murdered 9 Peter Peppermint Kevin MJ Dan Parvati No Vote Phaedra Phaedra 10 Kevin Peppermint Peter Larsa Janelle Dan Shereé Phaedra Murdered 11 Parvati Peppermint Kevin Larsa Janelle Dan No Vote\n\nPhaedra 12 Bergie Peppermint Maks Larsa Dan Dan Murdered 13 Dan Peppermint Maks Larsa Janelle Phaedra 14 Janelle No Vote Peppermint Maks Larsa Dan 15 Tamra No Vote\n\nPeppermint Maks Kevin Murdered 16 Larsa Peppermint Dan CT 17 Ekin-Su Peppermint Maks Murdered 18 Deontay No Vote Peppermint Maks Quit[v 5] 19 Maks No Vote\n\nJohn Ekin-Su 20 Marcus Peppermint Murdered 21 Peppermint Trishelle 22 Bananas Murdered\n\nKey: Winner Banished Traitor Banished Faithful Murdered Quit Shielded Immune Recruited Rejected Traitor Faithful\n\n↑ Instead of a Traitors' conclave, the Murder took place in plain sight, with the Traitors convincing a Faithful to drink from a poisoned chalice.\n\n↑ There was no Banishment this episode. Instead, as the Shield winners for the round, Kevin & Sandra had to initiate a chain of safety by conferring immunity to Murder to another contestant of their choice, with that contestant then choosing someone else to make immune, until five contestants were left, up for Sacrifice to be potentially Murdered.\n\n↑ CT, MJ & Trishelle were tied for the most plurality of votes. They revoted after each having the chance to make a speech.\n\n↑ Kate entered to the game at Episode 5's Banishment. As she entered to the game, she was safe from both Banishment and Murder.\n\n↑ Deontay left the show for mental health reasons.\n\nSeason Overview[]\n\nEpisode 1[]\n\nAirdate: January 12, 2024\n\nTraitors Selected: Dan & Phaedra\n\nMission Synopsis: Beacon Lighting\n\nTogether, the 21 contestants worked together to build a giant beacon and set it alight in the middle of a loch, by gathering and rearranging the puzzle pieces for the beacon first. To guide the group, a replica of the puzzle was also hidden among bottles scattered along the loch shore. In order to set it ablaze, all players must have left the water; however, they were first tied up to a pole, and needed to untangle themselves first, and deciding whether to go for a Shield (two in the loch and one on land), start the puzzle or help someone untie themselves first. Completing the Mission within 40 minutes would earn the group $15,000.\n\nPrize Earned: $30,000 out of $30,000\n\nShields: CT, Deontay & Janelle\n\nEpisode 2[]\n\nAirdate: January 12, 2024\n\nRecruitment: Parvati (Accepted)\n\nMurdered: Bananas\n\nMission Synopsis: Scarecrow Search\n\nThe group of 20 contestants were split into three groups, each with their own marked paths. They encountered three questions about their fellow contestants based on a previously-completed questionnaire, with each possible option associated with a scarecrow that had a key on their neck. They had to guess the correct option, carry the scarecrow to a locked box and attempt to open it with the scarecrow's key. If they succeeded, they would be eventually guided to a 'field of gold' full of scarecrows, which they dissembled to try and find ten hidden gold coins.

To find the gold, the contestants needed to use tools scattered around the cemetery to break things open. The gold would only be counted if it was placed in a wheelbarrow at the cemetery entrance. To make things more difficult, searchlights traversed across the cemetery; any contestant caught in them were immediately eliminated from the game and any gold they were carrying. Only 9 players will allowed to search at a time so the rest of the players were a substitute incase a player is caught and eliminated from the game. 3 Shields was also hidden somewhere in the cemetery.\n\nPrize Earned: $19,500 out of $20,000\n\nShields: Janelle, Peter & Tamra\n\nBanished: Maks (10-2-2-2-1-1)\n\nEpisode 4[]\n\nAirdate: January 18, 2024\n\nQuit: Deontay\n\nMurdered: Ekin-Su\n\nMission Synopsis: The Funeral\n\nThe contestants took a long and slow walk to the Murdered contestant's final resting place; along the way, they were given a series of questions hinting at who was safe, allowing those who were the correct answer(s) to enter the carriage instead of walking with the procession, and eliminating them from consideration. The three contestants left then stepped into coffins at the burial plot, with the group voting on who they believe was Murdered. If the majority could correctly guess which contestant was Murdered, they earned $20,000 for the prize pot.\n\nPrize Earned: $0 out of $20,000\n\nBanished: Larsa (8-4-1-1-1)\n\nEpisode 5[]\n\nAirdate: January 25, 2024\n\nMurdered: Tamra\n\nMission Synopsis: Bird Calls\n\nThe 14 contestants were split into three pairs of 'runners' who ran about the castle grounds with a marked map, and a group of eight that stayed behind in the castle. Within a time limit of 20 minutes, the runners located various stations, where they heard a bird call after blowing their whistles. They then imitated this call back to the castle group via radios; the castle group then had to search among various stuffed birds to find the one that made the right call, as well as where it could be found (with only one guess per bird call). Each correct bird call identified (with a maximum of 6) netted $2,500, alongside a bird in the Walled Garden that would net the runners that mimicked it Shields if the castle group guessed it correctly.\n\nPrize Earned: $10,000 out of $15,000\n\nShields: Bergie & Trishelle\n\nIntruder: Kate\n\nBanished: Janelle (9-5)\n\nEpisode 6[]\n\nAirdate: February 1, 2024\n\nMurdered: Bergie (Blocked by Shield)\n\nMission Synopsis: Catapult Build\n\nThe 13 contestants had to make their way to an incomplete giant catapult, collecting catapult pieces along the way to fully assemble it.

While making their way through the woods, each pair would encounter trivia or puzzle questions with two options they could pick from. They then had to follow a rope course based on their choice and have one member attempt to pick up a scroll along the way; if they were correct, they could continue on, but if they were wrong, they would be stuck in a bog or booby trap. The gold would only be banked if at least one member of each pair completed the course successfully. In addition, the pair that banked their gold the fastest would win Shields.\n\nPrize Earned: $8,000 out of $25,000\n\nShields: Kevin & Sandra\n\nMarked for Sacrifice: Bergie, Kate, MJ, Parvati & Trishelle\n\nEpisode 8[]\n\nAirdate: February 15, 2024\n\nMurder: Bergie\n\nMission Synopsis: Cabin in the Woods\n\nThe contestants were dropped off at a cabin in the woods and met legendary Big Brother player Will Kirby, where they found the entry to a network of escape tunnels, a map and instructions. Only five contestants could enter the tunnel at one time, while everyone else stayed behind to read the map, control the tunnel lights and communicate with those underground. The contestants had to locate gold hidden in various parts of the tunnel network, avoid any dead ends and escape the tunnels through a well within 30 minutes, all while avoiding a range of annoyances (both above and underground) meant to gross them out. Up to $20,000 could be discovered and won, but for every contestant left in the cabin or tunnels when time ran out (or chose to exit through the cabin door instead of the tunnel), $1,000 was deducted from the total. Additionally, a Shield was hidden in one of the tunnels.\n\nPrize Earned: $11,000 out of $20,000\n\nShield: Trishelle\n\nBanished: Parvati (7-4)\n\nEpisode 9[]\n\nAirdate: February 22, 2024\n\nUltimatum: Kate (Accepted)\n\nMurder: Kevin\n\nMission Synopsis: Knockout Comp\n\nEach contestant had a stained glass window with their name on it. They then had to take turns to fire from a crossbow at a window of their choice. The contestants' task was to shatter all the windows except one - whoever's window was left standing would win a Shield. In the meantime, each missed crossbow shot before this was accomplished would cost the group $250 from a starting pot of $25,000.\n\nPrize Earned: $15,250 out of $25,000\n\nShield: CT\n\nEpisode 10[]\n\nAirdate: February 29, 2024\n\nBanished: Peter (5-4)\n\nMurder: John\n\nMission Synopsis: Big Dig\n\nThe seven contestants had to dig up golden nuggets from a huge pile of dirt worth $150 each.
