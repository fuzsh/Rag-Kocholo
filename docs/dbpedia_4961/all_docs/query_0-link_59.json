        "text": "For the pro-dancers of 'Dancing With The Stars', the competition is truly as tough as it gets. Besides having to perform with a celebrity that dances or may not be a dancer, they also have to choreograph and put together a stellar performance that ensures they make it to the next round. With all the pro-dancers having multiple international competition title wins to their names, it's definitely no easy feat to bag a 'DWTS' win.\n\nBut for Val Chmerkovskiy, the third time might be the charm. Having won twice before and with a track record that places him among the top three in multiple seasons, Chmerkovskiy knows how to win over the audiences and judges. Now, on Season 30, as he gears up to dance with model and influencer Olivia Jade, here's a look at his impressive track record.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n'Gossip Girl' reboot: Why did Lori Loughlin's daughter Olivia Jade slam show?\n\nDid Lori Loughlin's daughter know about college admissions fraud?
