He attended Kenyon College and Harvard Law School and was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1845. In 1852, he married Lucy Ware Webb. He was an officer in the Union Army throughout the Civil War and returned home to enter politics. He served as a member of the House of Representatives from Ohio and was elected governor of that state three times. In l876, Hayes ran for President against Samuel Jones Tilden. Neither of the candidates gained enough electoral votes, so the election was referred to a special commission. They settled in favor of Hayes, who served as President from 1877- l881. During his presidency, President Hayes held the first annual White House Easter Egg Roll. This celebration is still held today. After President Hayes retired, he dedicated his time to the welfare of Civil War veterans, to prison reform, and the cause of education for African Americans. Rutherford B. Hayes died on January 17, 1893.\n\nOther School Facts"
