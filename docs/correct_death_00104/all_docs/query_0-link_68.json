Anderson Young, and Ruth Ellen Maness, section K and L in Legacy of Sacrifice: Missionaries to Scandinavia, 1872–94 (Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, 2007), 223–58.\n\nClaus Herman Karlson\n\n(Clas Herman Larsson or Carlsson)\n\n1849–1915\n\nResidence: Oakley, Cassia Co., Idaho\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 14 June 1887\n\nMissionary labors: Göteborg Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 30 May 1889\n\nName of departure ship: Milo\n\nBirth date: 20 September 1849\n\nBirthplace: Klintatorp, Grevbäck, Skaraborg, Sweden\n\nFather: Carlsson, Lars\n\nMother: Andersdotter, Britta\n\nSpouse: Severe, Henrietta\n\nMarriage date: 10 January 1875\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 3 July 1915\n\nDeath place: Parker, Fremont Co., Idaho\n\nBurial place: Parker Cemetery, Parker, Fremont Co., Idaho\n\nHis parents joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1854 in Sweden. They immigrated with Claus to America and crossed the plains in the Christensen handcart company in 1857. On the journey, his father died at Fort Bridger, leaving Claus and his mother to continue their way to the Salt Lake Valley. At that time, he was nine years old (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 14:321).\n\nDue to poverty, he was unable to attend school in the valley. He learned to read and write from children who did attend school. His biographer wrote that he “would smooth the dirt and write with a small stick for a pencil, while he herded cows for pay” (Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1).\n\nAt age twelve, Claus was hired to haul freight from Kelton, Box Elder County, to Salt Lake City. He continued in this employ after his marriage to Henrietta Severe in 1875. Between 1880 and 1882, he and his wife moved to Oakley, Cassia County, Idaho, where he continued to haul freight. From 1883 to 1887, he served as the justice of the peace in Oakley (see Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1).\n\nThen in 1887, Claus accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. He journeyed across the United States and then boarded the steamer Wisconsin bound for Liverpool to reach Scandinavia. “We didn’t get very far when we got fast on a sand bar and two tug boats got us off, having to turn the ship clear around before doing so,” he wrote. He arrived in Copenhagen on 14 June 1887 and was assigned to labor in the Göteborg Conference. He departed from Sweden aboard the steamer Christiania. He described Göteborg as a beautiful city with eighty thousand inhabitants. He labored in Norrköping (Östergotland County) and wrote, “I find myself alone in a strange city and seemingly without a friend. . . . I am to preside over the branch, also teach an English class every night.” On this mission, he visited relatives and his place of birth. He wrote, “I found an old friend of my father’s whom I talked with a long time” (“My Mission to Scandinavia—Personal Journal of Claus H. Karlson”).\n\nMuch of his personal writings are about weather, travels, and holding meetings. However, he did share glimpses of his testimony: “Spoke an hour on the divine mission of Joseph Smith. The congregation seemed very much interested and a goodly portion of the spirit of the Lord was with us.” But too often he found that the learned were not interested in his message. He called them “infidels” because they “would not believe.” However, he did write, “I still hope of winning some of them over to the truth” (“My Mission to Scandinavia—Personal Journal of Claus H. Karlson”).\n\nHe wrote of receiving his missionary release: “Of course I was pleased, and at the same time serious reflections ran through my mind in regard to whether I had been faithful as a servant of the Lord” (Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1). After completing an honorable mission, Claus departed from Copenhagen on 30 May 1889 aboard the steamer Milo with 239 emigrating Latter-day Saints and 12 other returning missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 309). Of this voyage he wrote, “Missionaries quarters are excellent and all retire to rest.” After arriving in Hull, England, he penned, “The streets are not kept as clean as I am used to seeing them in Sweden. Seems a very nice city though the sameness of the architecture is rather wearisome” (“My Mission to Scandinavia—Personal Journal of Claus H. Karlson”).\n\nReturning to Oakley, he found his farm quite run down. He set about to improve things and sold his interest in a co-op store and built a store of his own. During those years, he served on the high council of the Cassia Stake in Oakley and as a home missionary. In 1900, he sold his store to the co-op company and moved to Parker, Fremont County, Idaho, where he bought 160 acres (see Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1).\n\nBeing an active Mormon, he was angered that he was not allowed to vote due to his belief in plural marriage: “Because I was a member of the Mormon Church and as such believed in obeying the commandments of God, I could not vote” (Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1).\n\nIn 1908, he suffered from a paralytic stroke, that crippled him (see “Sketch of Henrietta Severe Karlson,” 1). During his remaining years he enjoyed reading masterpieces of literature and “occupied most of his spare time reading the best of material he could find.” Claus died in 1915 at his home in Parker, Fremont County, Idaho, at age sixty-five (see Miller, “History of Claus Herman Karlson,” 1).\n\nJames Morgan Keller III\n\n1865–1920\n\nResidence: Mink Creek, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 28 August 1889\n\nMissionary labors: Copenhagen and Ålborg conferences\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 11 June 1891\n\nName of departure ship: Volo\n\nBirth date: 9 June 1865\n\nBirthplace: Mantua, Box Elder Co., Utah\n\nFather: Keller (Kjøller), James (Jens) Morgan (Morgensen)\n\nMother: Valentinsen (Valentine), Karen Margarethe (Margrethe)\n\nSpouse: Baird, Mary Ellen Delacy\n\nMarriage date: 9 December 1883\n\nMarriage place: Mink Creek, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nDeath date: 31 December 1920\n\nDeath place: Mink Creek, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nBurial place: Mink Creek Cemetery, Mink Creek, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nAs a young boy, James experienced loneliness in Mantua, Box Elder County, Utah. His nearest neighbor lived twenty miles away. In 1872, he and his father moved to Mink Creek, Franklin County, Idaho. In Mink Creek he was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 17 July 1877 by Bishop Rasmus Rasmussen (see “Mink Creek Idaho Ward, 1871–1976,” 10).\n\nAfter his baptism, he labored beside his father in the local sawmill. He was ordained an elder in 1880 by Andrew A. Bjorn. Three years later, he married. Although he and his wife were happy, she complained that people in Mink Creek “could scarcely speak a word of English. . . . You will never know how lonely it was at first in Mink Creek” (“Mink Creek Idaho Ward, 1871–1976,” 10). In spite of her loneliness, they continued to reside in the area. James was endowed on 25 June 1884 in the Logan Temple and was ordained a high priest on 17 June 1892 by Anthon H. Lund.\n\nHe served as second counselor to Bishop Rasmus Rasmussen and later as first counselor to the same bishop (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 3:434). Through these years his wife became more accepting of those in Mink Creek. He bid farewell to her in 1889 to accept a mission call to Scandinavia.\n\nHe arrived in Copenhagen on 28 August 1889 and was assigned to labor in the Copenhagen and later Ålborg conferences. He served in Bornholm, the homeland of his parents (“Mink Creek Idaho Ward, 1871–1976,” 11; Keller, “A Small Sketch of the Life of Jens Mogensen Kjoller [James Morgan Keller],” 1). When he departed from Copenhagen in 1891, there were forty-two emigrating Latter-day Saints aboard the steamer Volo and three other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 319).\n\nWhen James returned to Mink Creek, he built the finest house in the community for his wife (see “Mink Creek Idaho Ward, 1871–1976,” 11). Sixteen years later, he accepted a second mission call to Scandinavia. On 17 July 1907, he arrived in the Danish-Norwegian Mission. From 1908 to 1909, he served as president of the Bergen Conference. He was honorably released on 27 May 1909 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 417, 508).\n\nReturning to Mink Creek, James was ordained a bishop on 26 February 1910 by Heber J. Grant. He was the fourth bishop of the Mink Creek Ward of the Oneida Stake. He served in that capacity from 1909 to 1916 (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 3:434). His later years were riddled with poor health (see “Mink Creek Idaho Ward, 1871–1976,” 11). James died in 1920 in Mink Creek at age fifty-five.\n\nAndrew Knudsen\n\n(Andreas Hansen)\n\n1854–1936\n\nResidence: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 24 June 1887\n\nMissionary labors: Christiania Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 8 August 1889\n\nName of departure ship: Bravo\n\nBirth date: 13 July 1854\n\nBirthplace: Østre Sveen, Løiten, Hedmark, Norway\n\nFather: Knudsen, Hans\n\nMother: Larsdatter, Birgitte\n\nSpouse: Sward, Chesty\n\nMarriage date: 9 June 1877\n\nDeath date: 30 August 1936\n\nDeath place: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Provo City Cemetery, Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nAndrew was raised in the home of well-to-do parents who embraced The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1863. The family crossed the Atlantic Ocean aboard the Lady of the Sea from Liverpool to New York. They immigrated to the Salt Lake Valley in 1865 with an independent ox train. They then located in Provo, Utah County (see Flake, Portrait, Genealogical and Biographical Record of Utah, 415).\n\nAndrew was baptized at age nine in December 1870. He spent many happy days assisting his father on the family farm in Provo (see Warrum, Utah since Statehood, 2:915). As his father advanced in years, Andrew and his brother purchased the family homestead (see Flake, Portrait, Genealogical and Biographical Record of Utah, 415).\n\nAt age eighteen, he studied music and began a career that twenty-five years (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 147). He was very talented on the clarinet and was a member of the Jepperson Orchestra. He also sang in the Tabernacle Choir (see Flake, Portrait, Genealogical and Biographical Record of Utah, 415).\n\nIn 1887, Andrew accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 24 June 1887 and was assigned to labor in the Christiania Conference. He served in the Bergen, Hedemarken, and Arendal (Aust Agder County) branches. He had the responsibility not only of presiding over two of the branches but of organizing a choir in the Arendal Branch. After completing an honorable mission, Andrew accompanied 150 emigrating Latter-day Saints aboard the steamer Bravo to Hull, England. Aboard ship he served as an assistant to Jens C. A. Weibye (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 309).\n\nReturning to Provo, Andrew became a member of the Provo City Silver Band (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 20:113). He was ordained a high priest and a bishop and set apart to preside over the Provo First Ward on 24 December 1893 (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 147). Later he served as an alternate on the high council of the Utah Stake. He was also a member of the Provo City Council for two years and chairman of the committee on irrigation (see Flake, Portrait, Genealogical and Biographical Record of Utah, 415).\n\nIn 1898, along with his brother Herman, Andrew established the Provo Creamery. He also had interest in sugar beets, which he sold to the Lehi Sugar Factory. He helped organize the Farmers’ Protective Association, whose object was to protect the sugar industry in Provo (see Flake, Portrait, Genealogical and Biographical Record of Utah, 415). His biographer said of him, “In all business matter has displayed sound judgment and keen sagacity” (Warrum, Utah Since Statehood, 2:912). Andrew died in 1936 in Provo at age eighty-two.\n\nSvante Johan Svenson Koeven\n\n(Sven Johan Svensson)\n\n1836–1922\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 24 May 1888\n\nName of departure ship: Milo\n\nBirth date: 29 December 1836\n\nBirthplace: Kärret, Södra Råda, Värmland, Sweden\n\nFather: Andersson, Sven\n\nMother: Andersdotter, Brita\n\nSpouse: Arvidson, Anna Maria\n\nMarriage date: 9 November 1868\n\nSpouse: Ridderberg, Maria\n\nMarriage date: 26 September 1888\n\nSpouse: Vickland, Karin\n\nMarriage date: 28 September 1888\n\nSpouse: Hedman, Kajsa\n\nMarriage date: 28 September 1888\n\nSpouse: Carlson, Johanna Louisa\n\nMarriage date: 3 October 1888\n\nMarriage place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 10 July 1922\n\nDeath place: Montpelier, Bear Lake Co., Idaho\n\nBurial place: Montpelier Cemetery, Montpelier, Bear Lake Co., Idaho\n\nSvante lived at home with his parents until he was eleven years old. During those years, he tended his younger brothers and sisters because both of his parents worked. He educated himself and learned to read but not how to write. In 1847, he lived with a country tailor to learn his trade. In the years that followed, he moved from one tailor’s home to another until he acquired the needed skills (see Diary of Svante Johan Svenson Koeven, 3).\n\nIn 1860, while working with a tailor in Stockholm, he contracted a lung disease. The disease led a minister to explain to him that he must be converted before he died. By August of 1860, his health had improved, and his interest in religion had grown. He was disappointed that the Lutheran minister could not answer his questions. It was a dream in which his departed father appeared to him and told him that the true gospel was upon the earth and that he must search for it; that led him to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Svante was baptized on 7 September 1861 and wrote in his diary, “I cannot describe the joy I felt over finding that for which I had sought for one and one-half years” (Diary of Svante Johan Svenson Koeven, 3).\n\nIn 1862, he was ordained a priest and an elder. By 1863, he had become president of the Stockholm Branch. He served in that position until being called on a local mission to Gotland. Although he met with much success as a missionary, his words were rejected by his family (see Diary of Svante Johan Svenson Koeven, 3).\n\nIn 1866, Svante immigrated to America and settled in Enterprise, Washington County, Utah. In 1872, he moved to Montpelier, Bear Lake County, Idaho. It was in Montpelier that his wife died, leaving him to raise a crippled boy. Svante and his son were residing in a two-room log house when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. On that mission, he served as president of the Uppsala Branch. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 24 May 1888 aboard the steamer Milo (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 299–300, 305).\n\nAfter returning home, he married again. He supported his family as a builder and a farmer. He is remembered for his construction labors on the Logan Temple and for doing the genealogical work for many relatives and friends (see Matthews, History of Bear Lake Pioneers, 360).\n\nIn 1905, Svante was called on a local mission. He was disappointed when near neighbors didn’t accept the gospel because he wanted them to have the same happiness he enjoyed. His patriarchal blessing promised him that many souls would rejoice and rise up and bless him and thank him for having brought them the gospel. He believed that he did not fulfill this promise (see Matthews, History of Bear Lake Pioneers, 360).\n\nIn 1914, he sold his home and ranch. He died in 1922 in Montpelier at age eighty-five (see Matthews, History of Bear Lake Pioneers, 358–61).\n\nJens Hansen Kofoed\n\n1848–1922\n\nResidence: Brigham City, Box Elder Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 28 September 1890\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 3 September 1891\n\nName of departure ship: Guion Lines\n\nBirth date: 2 November 1848\n\nBirthplace: Arnager, Nylarsker, Bornholm, Denmark\n\nFather: Kofoed, Hans Ancher\n\nMother: Munch, Cecilia\n\nSpouse: Quigley, Ellen Elmira\n\nMarriage date: 3 June 1870\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Gassman, Rosina\n\nMarriage date: 4 March 1872 (1876)\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Gassman, Ellen Elmira\n\nMarriage date: 4 March 1872\n\nDeath date: 13 November 1922\n\nDeath place: Weston, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nBurial place: Weston, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nIn 1853, Jens and his family joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Denmark. They immigrated to America in 1857. It was reported that Jens walked barefoot across the plains to the Salt Lake Valley in the John Taylor company, arriving on 17 September 1860. He and his family settled in Lehi, Utah County, before moving to Weston, Franklin County, Idaho (see Youngberg, Conquerors of the West: Stalwart Mormon Pioneers, 281).\n\nJens was residing in Brigham City, Box Elder County, Utah, when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1890. He arrived in Copenhagen on 28 September 1890. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 3 September 1891 aboard a steamer operated by the Guion Lines (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 316).\n\nReturning to the States, he lived in several areas, including Afton, Lincoln County, Wyoming. It was his work on the railroads that extended from Idaho to Montana that led him to reside in so many different communities. His descendants remember him as an excellent hunter who supplied meat for his own family and many others. They also recall that he worked in the local mines (see Youngberg, Conquerors of the West: Stalwart Mormon Pioneers, 281). Jens died in 1922 in Weston, Franklin County, Idaho, at age seventy-four.\n\nErastus R. Kofford\n\n(Rastus Emanuel Larsen)\n\n1860–1934\n\nResidence: Mount Pleasant, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 24 June 1889\n\nMissionary labors: Christiania Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 16 April 1891\n\nName of departure ship: Cameo\n\nBirth date: 14 November 1860\n\nBirthplace: Vester Marie, Bornholm, Denmark\n\nFather: Kofoed Busk, Lars\n\nMother: Jensen, Cisilie Kirstine\n\nSpouse: Reynolds, Clara Cornelia\n\nMarriage date: 6 September 1883\n\nMarriage place: probably Utah\n\nDeath date: 11 September 1934\n\nDeath place: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Provo City Cemetery, Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nErastus, a resident of Mount Pleasant, Sanpete County, Utah, accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1889. He arrived in Copenhagen on 24 June 1889 and was assigned to labor in the Christiania Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 16 April 1891 aboard the steamer Cameo with fifty-nine emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 310–11, 318).\n\nFollowing a short illness, Erastus died in 1934 at his home in Provo at age seventy-three. His funeral was held at the Provo Fifth Ward meetinghouse (see “Erastus Kofford,” Deseret News, 15 September 1934).\n\nBent Rolfsen Larsen\n\n(Bent Rolfsen Olsen)\n\n1845–1926\n\nResidence: Monroe, Sevier Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 5 November 1881\n\nMissionary labors: Christiania Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 15 June 1883\n\nName of departure ship: Pacific (Milo)\n\nBirth date: 24 September 1845\n\nBirthplace: Risør, Aust-Agder, Norway\n\nFather: Larsen, Ole\n\nMother: Bentsdatter, Ingebor Maria\n\nSpouse: Sorensen, Julie\n\nMarriage date: 30 June 1873\n\nSpouse: Washburn, Lorena Eugenia\n\nDeath date: 7 November 1926\n\nDeath place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Monroe City Cemetery, Monroe, Sevier Co., Utah\n\nBent was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day on 10 September 1864 and ordained an elder on 14 January 1870. He immigrated to Utah in 1866 and was a resident of Monroe, Sevier County, Utah, when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1881. He arrived in Copenhagen on 5 November 1881 and was assigned to labor in the Christiania Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 15 June 1883 with 503 emigrating Latter-day Saints and 17 other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 262, 264, 269).\n\nUpon returning to Monroe, Bent was called to serve in the second elders quorum of the Sevier Stake (see Warnock, Memories of Sevier Stake, 131). On 11 May 1887, he was arrested for unlawful cohabitation and sentenced on 16 March 1888 by Judge Henderson to six months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a fifty-dollar fine. On 16 September 1888, he was discharged from the penitentiary (see Jenson, LDS Church Chronology, 11 May 1887; 16 March 1888; 16 September 1888).\n\nBent was a farmer and lived in Monroe for almost sixty years. He also served as a temple worker in the Manti and Salt Lake temples. He died in 1926 in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, at age eighty-one.\n\nChristian Larsen\n\n(Christian Christensen)\n\n1842–1927\n\nResidence: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 6 November 1882\n\nMissionary labors: Århus Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 25 August 1884\n\nName of departure ship: Panther\n\nBirth date: 5 August 1842\n\n< lang=\"DA\">Birthplace:< lang=\"DA\"> Svæltekrog, Longelse, Svendborg, Denmark\n\nFather: Larsen, Christen (Christian) J.\n\nMother: Hansen, Dorthea\n\nSpouse: Barrett, Emma\n\nMarriage date: 7 December 1868\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 15 April 1927\n\nDeath place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBefore his baptism on 26 May 1866 by Jens Jensen, Christian was a merchant-sailor, trading between Denmark and the British Isles. When war broke out between Denmark and Germany, the merchant vessels were pressed into military service. He saw some fighting and was in the battle of Heligoland. Soon after his baptism, he immigrated to America and crossed the plains in Henry W. Lawrence’s ox team company. He settled in Logan, Cache County, Utah, where he worked in farming and stock raising for many years. During these years, he was ordained an elder in January 1867 and was endowed on 7 December 1868 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 2:75).\n\nIn 1882, Christian accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 6 November 1882 and was assigned to labor in the Århus Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 25 August 1884 aboard the steamer Panther (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 268, 279).\n\nAfter returning to Utah, he was ordained a high priest on 3 March 1887 by Franklin D. Richards. He served as a high counselor in the Cache Stake of Zion beginning in 1901. Before this calling, he was a teacher and an assistant superintendent of the Sunday School. He also served as a counselor and president of the YMMIA. Other service included secretary of the teachers, elders, and then Seventy quorums (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 2:75).\n\nCivically, Christian served as a councilman, alderman, assessor, and member of the school board (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 2:75). He died at his home in Logan at age eighty-four.\n\nChristian Gries (Grejs) Larsen\n\n(Christen Laursen)\n\n1828–1911\n\nResidence: Spring City, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 6 October 1873\n\nMissionary labors: Scandinavian Mission\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 25 June 1875\n\nName of departure ship: Pacific (Cato)\n\nBirth date: 17 December 1828\n\nBirthplace: Grejs, Grejs, Vejle, Denmark\n\nFather: Johansen, Lauritz (Lars)\n\nMother: Sørensdatter, Ane Margarethe\n\nSpouse: Sørensen, Caroline Maria\n\nMarriage date: 1 April 1857\n\nMarriage place: Grejs, Vejle, Denmark\n\nSpouse: Christiansen, Anna Marie\n\nMarriage date: 15 January 1860\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Ungermand (Wermann), Anna Olsen\n\nMarriage date: 30 May 1863\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Olsen, Caroline Ann\n\nMarriage date: 9 April 1864\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Johnson, Annetta (Anna)\n\nMarriage date: 10 April 1876\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 1 June 1911\n\nDeath place: Castle Dale, Emery Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Castle Dale Cemetery, Castle Dale, Emery Co., Utah\n\nWhile in the king’s military service, Christian was baptized on 15 March 1851 by Andreas Aagren. Following his baptism, he preached to military personnel. He then served as a local missionary for over four years (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 151). During this mission, he served in the Bornholm Conference. He “expressed himself as happy, . . . reported that his Conference was prosperous. The missionaries and most of the Saints were faithful and true to their covenants. . . . The spirit of the Lord seemed to be gaining an influence for good over its former opponents” (Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 101).\n\nHe later reported that on the isle of Bornholm “nearly every city and village on the island had been visited by the Elders.” In spite of his optimistic recording, Christian was imprisoned for preaching. On 31 March 1853, he was released from the Frederikstad (Østfold County, Norway) prison “on condition that he would not attend to any official ordinance pertaining to his Church pending the findings of the Supreme Court” (Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 73, 108).\n\nHe is credited with organizing the first conference of the Church in Norway on 6 April 1853. It was held in Gaard Ingolsrud. At this conference, Church authorities were sustained by a vote of the Saints. Andrew Jenson wrote, “The Saints enjoyed the meetings exceedingly” (Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 73).\n\nOn 1 January 1857, he was given permission to immigrate to America. He crossed the Atlantic aboard the Westmoreland and then joined the Mathias F. Cowley wagon train to reach the Salt Lake Valley. It is family tradition that he pulled a handcart in this company (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 1:524).\n\nChristian located in Spring City, Sanpete County, and took an active part in local affairs. He was endowed on 14 November 1860 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. He served as the first bishop of the Spring City Ward from 1860 to 1868 (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 1:524).\n\nHe accepted a call to preside over the Scandinavian Mission in 1873. On Sunday, 1 June 1873, he accompanied Erastus Snow to the Jutland Penninsula and to Sørø County, Denmark. There they held meetings in Ålborg, Hjørring, Randers, Århus, Odense, and then Slagelse in Sørø. On 22 May 1875, President Joseph F. Smith wrote that while in Mr. M. Hansen Gissemann’s large social hall in Frederiksberg, “Chr. G. Larsen and myself addressed the brethren at some length” (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 221).\n\nIn 1875, Christian was the leader of emigrants aboard a steamer bound for Hull, England. He journeyed with the same emigrants by train to Liverpool. From Liverpool, he journeyed aboard the steamer Idaho with 765 emigrating Latter-day Saints also under his leadership (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 19:6)\n\nReturning to Utah, Christian presided over the Latter-day Saints settled in Castle Valley, Emery County (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 151). He served as the first president of the Emery Stake from 1880 to 1899. During these years, he was president of the co-op in Castle Dale, Emery County, and a member of the board of education (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 1:524). Andrew Jenson wrote of him, “Bro. Larsen was an excellent speaker and a man of distinct leadership” (Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 214).\n\nOn 16 January 1899, he was ordained a patriarch in the Emery Stake by President Anthon H. Lund. He died in 1911 in Castle Dale at age eighty-two. His biographer said of him, “He was one of the most talented and successful missionaries which the Scandinavian Mission produced. . . . His sermons were delivered with earnestness which made a deep and lasting impression” (“Sketches on the Lives of Christian Gries Larsen and His Wives,” 1).\n\nChristian Peter Larsen\n\n(Christen Pedersen)\n\n1846–1933\n\nResidence: Manti, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 19 September 1891\n\nMissionary labors: Copenhagen Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 7 September 1893\n\nName of departure ship: Bravo\n\nBirth date: 11 January 1846\n\nBirthplace: Fårdrup, Fårdrup, Sorø, Denmark\n\nFather: Larsen, Peder\n\nMother: Andersdatter, Ane Kirstine\n\nSpouse: Matthews, Mary\n\nMarriage date: 1 December 1868\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 2 May 1933\n\nDeath place: Manti, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Manti Cemetery, Manti, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nChristian was baptized on 19 December 1857. He immigrated to Utah in 1862 with his parents. The family located temporarily in Salt Lake City. At age sixteen, Christian worked for Nymphas Murdock. While thus employed, he met Mary Matthews from England. They soon married. Their first two children—Nymphas and Sarah—were named in honor of the Murdocks (see correspondence from Alve Murdock, 28 June 1999).\n\nChristian and his family made Manti, Sanpete County, their home. However, Christian left Manti to fulfill a mission to Scandinavia in 1891. He served in the Copenhagen Conference before being called as president of that conference in 1893. After completing an honorable mission, he accompanied twenty-four emigrating Latter-day Saints aboard the steamer Bravo in 1893 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 321, 333).\n\nAfter his return to the States, he again resided in Manti. He represented his community in the first Utah State Legislature as a senator before accepting his second mission call to Scandinavia in 1904. On this mission, he labored in the Ålborg Conference (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 402, 405).\n\nAfter the mission, he returned to Manti, where he served the community in several civic capacities. For two years he was a policeman, for four years a city marshal, and for an additional four years a justice of the peace. He also served the community as a member of the city council and the state as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1895 (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 152). Christian died in 1933 in Manti at age eighty-seven.\n\nHans Larsen\n\n1837–1915\n\nResidence: Woodland, Summit Co., Utah\n\nArrival in Copenhagen: 14 June 1887\n\nMissionary labors: Århus and Copenhagen Conferences\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 8 August 1889\n\nName of departure ship: Bravo\n\nBirth date: 29 April 1837\n\nBirthplace: Jersore, Klinte, Odense, Denmark\n\nFather: Hansen, Lars\n\nMother: Jensdatter, Maren\n\nSpouse: Mikkelsen, Jensine Dorthea\n\nMarriage date: 1862\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 8 December 1915\n\nDeath place: Hanna, Duchesne Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Tabiona, Duchesne Co., Utah\n\nHans came to Utah in 1860 with an independent ox team company. In the Salt Lake Valley, he married Jensine Mikkelsen, a young woman he met while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They resided in Salt Lake City, where Hans supported his family as a lime burner, a carpenter, and a cooper. After several years, he and his family moved to Kamas Valley in Summit County, where his skills as a carpenter were in great demand. However, due to Indian problems, the family moved to Peoa, Summit County, near the Weber River. When peace was restored, they returned to Kamas Valley (see Larsen, “A Brief History of My Father and Mother,” 1).\n\nHans purchased much land in the area and donated a portion of it to the Church. Due to his donation, he was privileged to name the local ward. He chose the name “Woodland Ward” before accepting a mission call to Scandinavia in 1887 (see Larsen, “A Brief History of My Father and Mother,” 2).\n\nOn 14 June 1887, he arrived in Copenhagen and was assigned to labor in the Århus Conference. Later he labored in the Copenhagen Conference. On this mission, he gathered much genealogy before departing from Copenhagen on 8 August 1889 aboard the steamer Bravo (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 304, 309).\n\nHans returned to Utah for a brief season. However, his thoughts of the ideal location had turned toward Mexico. On a journey to Mexico, the wagon in which he was riding tipped over. In the ensuing accident, his leg was badly hurt. He was crippled the remainder of his life (see Larsen, “A Brief History of My Father and Mother,” 3–4).\n\nHans settled in Dias until the Mexican Revolution forced his removal. He then resided in Hanna, Duchesne County, Utah (see Larsen, “A Brief History of My Father and Mother,” 4). He died in 1915 in Hanna at age seventy-eight.\n\nJames Peter Larsen\n\n(Jens Christensen)\n\n1842–1912\n\nResidence: Ephraim, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 6 November 1880\n\nMissionary labors: Ålborg Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 16 June 1882\n\nName of departure ship: Albano\n\nBirth date: 11 March 1842\n\nBirthplace: Holdensgård, Albæk, Hjørring, Denmark\n\nFather: Laursen, Christen\n\nMother: Christiansdatter, Johanna Marie\n\nSpouse: Larsen, Kirsten\n\nMarriage date: 19 January 1863 (1862)\n\nDeath date: 11 May 1912\n\nDeath place: Ephraim, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Ephraim, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nJames’s parents and eight siblings converted to Mormonism in 1854. Soon after their baptisms, the family voyaged from Europe aboard the sailing vessel John J. Boyd. On the journey, the death toll was high. Two of James’s brothers succumbed and were buried at sea. They also experienced a hurricane, a fire aboard ship, and a collision with another ship. Their vessel reached New York Harbor on 16 February 1856. It was not until 28 August 1859 that the family arrived in the Salt Lake Valley with the ox train company of James Brown (see Hayes, “History of Christian Laursen,” 1–2).\n\nBrigham Young advised the family to settle in Ephraim, Sanpete County. There James fought in the Black Hawk War. In the Salina Canyon battle, he was shot through the coat sleeve (see History of Sanpete and Emery Counties, Utah, 324).\n\nHe accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1880. He arrived in Copenhagen on 6 November 1880 and was assigned to labor in the Ålborg Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 16 June 1882 aboard the steamer Albano with 573 emigrating Latter-day Saints and 14 other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 265).\n\nAfter returning to Utah, he became a successful farmer (see History of Sanpete and Emery Counties, Utah, 324). James died in 1912 in Ephraim at age seventy.\n\nJohn Martin Larsen\n\n1822–1908\n\nResidence: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 22 November 1874\n\nMissionary labors: Copenhagen Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 8 September 1876\n\nName of departure ship: Cameo\n\nBirth date: 22 November 1822\n\nBirthplace: Odense, Odense, Denmark\n\nFather: Larsen, Knud\n\nMother: Ørtner, Margrethe\n\nSpouse: Andreasen, Laura\n\nSpouse: Ortener, Karen Marie\n\nSpouse: Sørensen, Anna Maria\n\nDeath date: 27 November 1908\n\nDeath place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Salt Lake City Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nJohn’s parents, Knud Larsen and Margrethe Ørtner, were married in Vor Fue parish in Odense City, Denmark on 19 May 1820. An older brother of John, Mathias Wilhelm Larsen, was christened in that same church on 21 October 1821.\n\nJohn is recorded as being baptized on 19 September 1854 by Jorgen Jensen, as was his wife. He and his wife immigrated to America in 1856. Aboard ship, their only child died. John and his wife continued their journey after the ship docked in New York Harbor. They were among hundreds who pushed and pulled handcarts to Zion (see “Funeral of J. M. Larson,” Deseret Evening News, 28 November 1908).\n\nWhile residing in Salt Lake City, Utah, John accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1874. He arrived in Copenhagen on 22 November 1874 and was assigned to labor in the Copenhagen Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 8 September 1876 aboard the steamer Cameo (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 220, 225).\n\nJohn died in 1908 in Salt Lake City at age eighty-six after suffering from poor health for many years. His funeral was held in the Salt Lake Eleventh Ward meetinghouse (see “Funeral of J. M.

During this service, he was arrested and brought to an inn where he was abused throughout the night. He was then taken to Malmö, where he was confined to prison for several days. After being released, he preached the gospel in the Hedemarken area, Norway. There he was arrested and taken to prison in Vang, Hedmark, Norway, where he was kept for eleven weeks awaiting trial. He was finally released on 28 July 1857. He was then assigned to labor in Vejle, Denmark. Once again, he was arrested and imprisoned for preaching the gospel. This time he spent five days in jail (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 103, 126, 144).\n\nIn 1859, Lars left Scandinavia and immigrated to America. He crossed the plains in George Rowley’s ox team company (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 14:323).\n\nSix years later, in 1865, he returned to Scandinavia to serve as president of the Vendsyssel (Hjørring County), Denmark Conference. Another mission call came in 1883. He arrived in Copenhagen on 7 November 1883 and was assigned to labor in the Copenhagen Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 20 August 1885 aboard the steamer Cato with ninety-three emigrating Latter-day Saints and four missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 291, 492).\n\nHe returned to Brigham City, Box Elder County, where he is played in the local brass band (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 20:83). He was a carpenter and farmer by trade. He died in Brigham City on 21 March 1901 at age sixty-two.

He was baptized on 2 September 1866. He accepted a local mission call and served for two years before immigrating to America aboard the John Bright. He arrived in the New York Harbor on 13 July 1868 and then traveled by train to Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska. From there, he journeyed with Horton D. Haight’s pioneer company to reach the Salt Lake Valley (see Larsen, “Journal of Lars K. Larsen,” 1).\n\nLars settled in Hyrum, Cache County, Utah, with his married sister. After his own marriage, he remained in Hyrum. He is remembered to have operated a large raspberry patch and a field of cultivated vegetables. He also owned dairy cows. It was his practice while milking cows to give sermons, as if speaking in church. The neighbors claimed they could hear him a block away (see Larsen, “Journal of Lars K. Larsen,” 2).\n\nLars accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1880. He arrived in Copenhagen on 4 May 1880 and was assigned to labor in the Christiania Conference. He converted many relatives on this mission. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 16 June 1882 aboard the steamer Albano with 14 returning missionaries and 573 emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 250, 265).\n\nLars accepted a second mission call to Scandinavia in 1904. On 20 December 1904, he arrived in Copenhagen and was appointed to labor in the Christiania Conference (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 265, 404–5).\n\nAfter completing this mission, he again returned to the States. At that time, near neighbors described him as being six feet four inches in height and very slim.

While a resident of Manti, Sanpete County, Utah, he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1879. He left Manti on 4 September 1879 and traveled by train to New York. In New York Harbor, he boarded the steamer Montana bound for Liverpool. After arriving in Liverpool, he traveled by train to Hull, England, and from there to Copenhagen. He finally arrived in Copenhagen on 30 September 1879, where he was assigned to labor in the Ålborg Conference (see Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 1; Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 238–39, 244).\n\nHis first afternoon in Ålborg was spent visiting families in Nørre Sundby, who “were very happy to see [me].” He also visited “a few of my friends from my youth” and his brother Lars who talked “about the gospel’s first principles which kept [his] interest” (Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 1–2).\n\nNiels, traveled from town to town on this mission. When speaking of Latter-day Saint meetings, he wrote, “Not many were present but they were good people.” Throughout his missionary journal, he often recorded writing letters to his wife and “his joy at receiving any news from home.” Most everywhere he traveled, he was well received but occasionally he penned of being “received with contempt” (Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 6).\n\nWhile attending Lutheran meetings, he heard three ministers preach and “one of them talked about the creation and said that man came from two oaks and then drank an intoxicating drink, and that is how the fall came about.” When he had occasion to listen to fellow missionaries, he penned, “Excellent sermons were given” (Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 15).\n\nNiels was arrested by a police officer near Hvidbjerg, Thisted County. He had his books taken from him and all his belongings before being put in a cell. After four nights of confinement, he was released. Toward the end of his mission, he received word that his wife had died. He was released early to return to Utah and care for his bereaved children. After one last visit with extended family members in Denmark, John began his journey home (see Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 18).\n\nA poem in his diary reveals his feelings:\n\nSoon, across the broad waves of the ocean,\n\nYou shall go away, on your way home to your beloved little ones.\n\nYour sorrow will be hard to bear\n\nWhen you gather your family around you, and she is missing,\n\nThe one you left just one year ago in a lonely valley\n\nIn order to bring us the beautiful message of peace.\n\nPlease receive my thanks, because I know for us that every word you spoke to me was pure and true,\n\nYou Honorable Man of Zion!\n\nMay the Lord look down and bless your life forever!

After reaching Hull, England, he went by train to Liverpool, where he boarded the Wisconsin. Aboard ship he reported, “Sometimes I didn’t sleep too well when I dreamed about my home and saw my child and my father crying, that made me feel so bad” (Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 20).\n\nOn 31 July 1880, he penned, “I was home in Manti with my beloved children and my old parents” (Larsen, “My Journey to Denmark,” 21).

He died in 1893 in Colonia Dublán, Galeana, Chihuahua, Mexico, at age sixty-three.\n\nOluf Christian Larsen\n\n1836–1929\n\nResidence: Ephraim, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 16 May 1881\n\nMissionary labors: Christiania Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 6 April 1883\n\nName of departure ship: Cato\n\nBirth date: 8 April 1836\n\n< lang=\"DA\">Birthplace:< lang=\"DA\"> Lille Landfaldege, Bragernæs-Drammen, Buskerud, Norway\n\nFather: Olsen, Lars\n\nMother: Olsdatter, Marie\n\nSpouse: Olsen, Emelia Christine\n\nMarriage date: 20 April 1862\n\nMarriage place: Elbe River (aboard ship)\n\nSpouse: Peterson, Annie Marie\n\nMarriage date: 23 December 1863\n\nMarriage place: Ephraim, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Anderson, Amelia\n\nMarriage date: May 1874\n\nSpouse: Christensen (Larson), Hannah (Johanna)\n\nMarriage date: 16 July 1884\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 11 November 1929\n\nDeath place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Salt Lake City Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBy age six, Oluf was working in a tobacco factory. In the factory, his arm was crushed between the cogs in a machine. A local doctor patched him up, but his arm was never totally repaired (see Larsen, “A Biographical Sketch of the Life of Oluf Christian Larsen: Dictated by Oluf Christian Larsen,” 2).\n\nHe was introduced to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1854. “The Mormons were so unpopular that I played Nicodemus by visiting the elders when I could sneak away from my friends. The elders were thrown into prison several times but this increased the interest of the people and their sympathy for the elders,” wrote Oluf (Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 12).\n\nOluf was baptized on 6 April 1857 about midnight, much to the distress of his parents, who attempted to prevent his baptism. He recalled hearing in the voice of an unruly crowd his mother saying, “Oh, if I could only get hold of him” (Larsen, “A Biographical Sketch of the Life of Oluf Christian Larsen: Dictated by Oluf Christian Larsen,” 14).\n\nHe was ordained a deacon on 20 September 1857 and a priest on 21 March 1858. “I felt it my duty to testify to everybody I came in contact with,” said Oluf. “They mocked and reviled me.” After laboring as a local missionary in Norway, he was imprisoned for preaching and forced to live on bread and water and then fined. In spite of the hardships, he wrote, “I rejoiced at the privilege of suffering in prison for the gospel’s sake” (Larsen, “A Biographical Sketch of the Life of Oluf Christian Larsen: Dictated by Oluf Christian Larsen,” 14–15).\n\nAfter his mission, he enlisted in the army. “This was hailed with joy and satisfaction by my parents, the priest, and my friends outside the church, thinking it would be impossible for me to withstand the ungodly influence that would beset me in the army,” he penned. However, Oluf found it possible to continue an attachment with the military and also to serve a local mission in Drammen before being appointed president over the Fredrickstad and Fredrickhald’s districts, Østfold County, Norway (see Larsen, “A Biographical Sketch of the Life of Oluf Christian Larsen: Dictated by Oluf Christian Larsen,” 19).\n\nHe was blessed with not only leadership abilities but also musical talents. For example, he wrote a song at the death of King Oscar I. It appears his song was “undoubtedly the first in print about His Honor’s demise.” He is credited with organizing the first Mormon choir in Norway in 1859. Although he enjoyed much success and happiness in Norway, he desired to emigrate. He wrote that “every avenue to get money was closed against me” until April 1862. He then departed from Scandinavia with emotions that were “mingled with joy and sorrow.” After arriving in the Salt Lake Valley on 29 September 1862, he wrote, “Coming down through Emigration Canyon we found teams camping all the way inquiring for friends and relatives” (see Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 25, 33, 37).\n\nHe and his wife lived with H. O. Magleby in the Salt Lake Valley for a brief time. Oluf worked in his carpenter’s shop. They moved to Springtown, Sanpete County, and later to Ephraim, Sanpete County, before settling in Circleville, Piute County. At each of these locations, Oluf used his carpentry skills to earn a livelihood to support his family. He built dams and dug canals to supplement the family income. With the coming of the railroad, he wrote, “Merchandise now was reasonably cheap because of railroad transportation and grain was a better price.” Gaining employment with the telegraph lines in 1871 greatly enhanced his economic base. “It seemed that the blessings of the Lord followed us from this time and we were more prosperous,” he wrote (Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 54–55).\n\nIn 1881, Oluf accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. “The people of Ephraim were very kind to me. They gathered up a nice little sum of money and with what I could scrape together I had plenty to take me to my mission field,” he penned. He crossed the Atlantic aboard the Wyoming and arrived in Copenhagen on 16 May 1881. He was assigned to labor in the Christiania Conference. “I now felt perfectly at home, because of my previous missionary work, ready and prepared to do what was required of me,” he said. On this mission, he saw his mother. “A great change had taken place with her, especially intellectually,” he penned. He labored in the Bergen and Hedemarken branches (see Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 55–57).\n\nDuring the mission, Oluf was imprisoned for five days in Drammen. He settled the problem by paying a fine of ten speciedaler. He wrote, “I never idled my time away” (Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larson (1836–1916),” 65). He departed from Copenhagen with 103 emigrating Latter-day Saints and several missionaries aboard the steamer Cato in 1883 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 138, 269).\n\nHe returned to Ephraim and reunited with his family. He was nearly “overcome by the kindness of the [local] people [for] no debt had accumulated during my absence,” he wrote (Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 66).\n\nHe was arrested in 1888. This time it was not for preaching but for cohabitation. He pled guilty and was sentenced to six months in the Utah penitentiary. “I little dreamed that I would be imprisoned in this glorious republic of America by obeying and practicing the religious doctrine of my church. . . . If I didn’t know there is a righteous God over-ruling everything for the good of those who love Him, I could be tempted to curse [the] nation” (Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 69–70).\n\nAfter being released from prison, he moved to Salt Lake City. Oluf died in 1929 at his home in Salt Lake City at age ninety-three (see Larsen, “Autobiography of Oluf Christian Larsen (1836–1916),” 70–75).\n\nRasmus Larsen\n\n(Rasmus Hansen Christensen)\n\n1839–1928\n\nResidence: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 8 November 1887\n\nMissionary labors: Århus Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 12 September 1889\n\nName of departure ship: Milo\n\nBirth date: 9 November 1839\n\nBirthplace: Sveltekrogen, Longelse, Svendborg, Denmark\n\nFather: Larsen, Christen\n\nMother: Hansen, Dorthea\n\nSpouse: Petersen, Mary Christina\n\nMarriage date: about 1865\n\nDeath date: 6 December 1928\n\nDeath place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Logan City Cemetery, Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nRasmus immigrated to Utah in 1865 and settled in Logan, Cache County, where he worked as a cooper. While residing in Logan, he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1887. He arrived in Copenhagen on 8 November 1887 and was assigned to labor in the Århus Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 12 September 1889 aboard the steamer Milo as the leader of the forty-two emigrating Latter-day Saints. After reaching Hull, England, Rasmus traveled by train to Liverpool (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 310).\n\nOn 21 September 1889, he boarded the steamer Wyoming in the Liverpool harbor. Aboard this vessel, he served as the leader of 133 Scandinavian, Swiss, and German Saints and nine returning missionaries. The Wyoming arrived in New York Harbor on 2 October 1889 (see Jenson, LDS Church Chronology, 21 September 1889).\n\nRasmus had returned to Utah by 10 October 1889. From 1891 to 1892, he was an officiator in the Logan Temple. In the fall of 1892, he moved to Mexico, where he remained until 1912. He died at the home of his son Joseph W. Larsen in Salt Lake City at age eighty-nine. Funeral services were held in the Salt Lake Ninth Ward chapel (see “Cooper Larsen Dead,” Logan Journal, 8 December 1928).\n\nRasmus Mogensen Larsen\n\n(Rasmus Mogensen)\n\n1848–1919\n\nResidence: Basalt, Bingham Co., Idaho\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 30 June 1894\n\nMissionary labors: Århus Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 8 November 1894\n\nName of departure ship: Rona\n\nBirth date: 25 September 1848\n\nBirthplace: Holme, Holme, Århus, Denmark\n\nFather: Laursen, Mogens\n\nMother: Mathiasdatter, Karen Marie\n\nSpouse: Madsen, Christine Marie\n\nMarriage date: 24 September 1870\n\nMarriage place: Skanderup, Skanderborg, Denmark\n\nDeath date: 16 August 1919\n\nDeath place: Brigham City, Box Elder Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Honeyville, Box Elder Co., Utah\n\nRasmus was baptized in Århus, Århus County, Denmark on 20 February 1881. Accompanied by his wife and family, he immigrated to Brigham City, Box Elder County, Utah, in 1884. Some years later, they moved to Fielding, Box Elder County, and then Malad City, Oneida County, Idaho (see “Two Pioneers Died after a Short Illness,” Box Elder Journal, 18 August 1919).\n\nWhile a resident of Basalt, Bingham County, Idaho, Rasmus accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1894. He arrived in Copenhagen on 30 June 1894 and was assigned to labor in the Århus Conference. After completing an honorable mission, Rasmus departed from Copenhagen on 8 November 1894 aboard the steamer Rona with eight emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 337, 339–40).\n\nAfter this mission, he settled again in Brigham City, where he was known as a hardworking shoemaker and was respected by all. He died at his residence from liver trouble and dropsy at age seventy-one, after having been confined to bed for four months. His funeral services were held in the Brigham City Second Ward chapel. He was survived by a wife, six sons and one daughter (see “Two Pioneers Died after a Short Illness,” Box Elder Journal, 18 August 1919).\n\nAndrew Larson\n\n(Anders Larsson)\n\n1830–1886\n\nResidence: Washington, Washington Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 1 September 1881\n\nMissionary labors: Skåne Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 16 June 1882\n\nName of departure ship: Albano (Bravo)\n\nBirth date: 22 May 1830\n\nBirthplace: #14 Westesvång, Sankt Petri-Malmö, Malmöhus, Sweden\n\nFather: Pehrsson, Lars\n\nMother: Larsdotter, Hanna\n\nSpouse: Jönsson (Ulstrom), Anna Christina\n\nMarriage date: about 1852\n\nMarriage place: Sweden\n\nDeath date: 29 September 1886\n\nDeath place: Washington, Washington Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Washington City Cemetery, Washington, Washington Co., Utah\n\nAndrew was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 20 May 1854. He came to America with his wife and two children that same year. He settled temporarily in Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, to earn money for the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. He and his wife eventually arrived in the valley on 17 September 1860. They settled at Fort Ephraim for one year before moving to Washington, Washington County, in December 1861 (see Washington Ward Records FHL Film #27435). He was ordained a high priest on 1 May 1877.\n\nWhile a resident of Washington, Andrew accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1881. He arrived in Copenhagen on 1 September 1881 and was assigned to labor in the Skåne Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 16 June 1882 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 262–63, 265).\n\nAndrew returned to Washington and resumed farming. He died in 1886 in Washington at age fifty-six.\n\nJohn Larson\n\n(Johan Larsson)\n\n1848–1929\n\nResidence: Gunnison, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 27 November 1877\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 1 September 1879\n\nName of departure ship: Aurora\n\nBirth date: 27 August 1848\n\nBirthplace: Kumlaby, Norrby, Västmanland, Sweden\n\nFather: Andersson, Lars\n\nMother: Larsdotter, Cajsa (Katrina)\n\nSpouse: Erickson, Anna\n\nMarriage date: 29 May 1871\n\nMarriage place: Endowment House, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Wangelin, Laura Gardell Larsen\n\nMarriage date: 23 June 1923\n\nDeath date: 29 December 1929\n\nDeath place: Gunnison, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Gunnison, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nAt age 18, John was baptized on 23 February 1866 by Swen J. Larson. He was ordained a teacher on 4 June 1867 and a priest on 27 May 1868. He served a local mission and helped convert his father’s family in 1868 (see “History of John Larson,” 1).\n\nJohn and his family immigrated to America in 1869 and settled in Gunnison, Sanpete County, Utah. After living in Fort Gunnison for a season, John built a home for his extended family on the north bank of the San Pitch River. To adorn the home, he built furniture—spinning wheels, wood cards, and looms (see History of Sanpete and Emery Counties, Utah, 460). He supported his family by manufacturing shingles and lumber in Twelve Mile Canyon. Later he engaged in a mercantile business and was a stockholder in a local co-op store. He was also a landowner in North Mayfield, Sanpete County. Due to his many holdings in the locale, it was easy for him to volunteer for sentry duty during Indian troubles (see “History of John Larson,” 1).\n\nIn 1877, John accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 27 November 1877 and was assigned to labor as a traveling elder in the Stockholm Conference before becoming president of that conference (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 231). According to his biographer, “In missionary work he was very successful and was the means of converting and bringing to Gunnison many splendid families” (“History of John Larson,” 1–2). He began his journey back to the States aboard the steamer Aurora with 103 emigrating Latter-day Saints. Twenty-four of the Saints from Stockholm were under his leadership (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 240–41).\n\nAfter returning to Gunnison, John did carpentry work on the local Relief Society hall. He served as secretary of the Gunnison Irrigation Company before becoming company president from 1903 to 1907. He was also the owner and president of the Highland Canal Company. He served as justice of the peace for four years and as president of the Gunnison city council (see “History of John Larson,” 2).\n\nEcclesiastically, he served as superintendent of the local Sunday School from 1892 to 1916 and as a counselor in the bishopric from 1892 to 1902. He was ordained a patriarch on 5 May 1918 by Hyrum G. Smith. After losing his health, he retired in 1923. John died in 1929 in Gunnison at age eighty-one as a result of a dropsical condition. He was survived by his wife, one daughter, and two sons (see “Pioneer Resident Is Called to Rest,” Gunnison Valley News, 2 January 1930).\n\nJohn Andrew Larson\n\n1869–1937\n\nResidence: Preston, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 15 March 1892\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 3 May 1894\n\nName of departure ship: Milo\n\nBirth date: 14 September 1869\n\nBirthplace: Logan, Cache, Utah\n\nFather: Larsen, Johannes\n\nMother: Jensen, Anna (Annie)\n\nSpouse: Allen, Maria (Myra) Elinor\n\nMarriage date: 4 December 1895\n\nMarriage place: Logan Temple, Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 22 January 1937\n\nDeath place: Preston, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nBurial place: Preston City Cemetery, Preston, Franklin Co., Idaho\n\nJohn’s parents were converted to the gospel in Scandinavia and came to Utah in 1861. He grew up helping his father on the family farm near Logan, Cache County, and clearing sagebrush from the family land in Preston, Franklin County, Idaho. The family moved to Preston in 1884 to raise cattle and horses when John was fourteen years old (see Larson, “A Short Sketch of the Life of John Andrew Larson,” 1).\n\nJohn was still residing in Preston when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1892. To prepare for the mission, he was endowed on 10 February 1892 in the Logan Temple (see FamilySearch). He arrived in Copenhagen on 15 March 1892 and was assigned to labor in the Stockholm Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 3 May 1894 aboard the steamer Milo with twenty-four emigrating Latter-day Saints and other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 327, 329, 337).\n\nHe returned to Preston and purchased a farm. It was not long before he enlarged his farm. This led many in Preston to conclude that John was very progressive. He raised a variety of oats that won first place at the state fair. He prized the gold medal he won for his crops. He also took much delight in owning fine horses and serving on the Preston Whitney Canal Board. His biographer said of him, “[He] was always ready to help build chapels for the welfare of the community” (Larson, “A Short Sketch of the Life of John Andrew Larson,” 1)\n\nJohn suffered from a heart attack and from shortness of breath thereafter. It was an attack of influenza which led to his death in 1937 at his home in Preston at age sixty-seven (see Larson, “A Short Sketch of the Life of John Andrew Larson,” 1).\n\nJohn Nils Larson\n\n(Johan Nilsson)\n\n1828–1898\n\nResidence: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 27 November 1875\n\nMissionary labors: Skåne Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 8 September 1876\n\nName of departure ship: Cameo\n\nBirth date: 21 July 1828\n\nBirthplace: Djurhus, Slimminge, Malmöhus, Sweden\n\nFather: Larsson, Nils\n\nMother: Hansdotter, Karna\n\nSpouse: Anderson, Elsa\n\nMarriage date: 22 June 1856\n\nMarriage place: Keokuk, Lee, Iowa\n\nSpouse: Larson, Kjersti (Christena) Yorgensen or Jorgason\n\nMarriage date: 15 September 1869\n\nMarriage place: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 9 November 1898\n\nDeath place: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nIn his youth, John was conscripted into the Swedish army. During his military service, he delivered government mail to sparsely settled areas of the country. After his military stint, he became a carpenter (see Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1).\n\nJohn was baptized on 22 March 1853 a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by C. Capson. Following his baptism, he served as a local missionary. By 1854, he was betrothed to Elsa Anderson. They immigrated to America with other converts. After arriving in New York, John took a carpentry job to acquire necessary means for him and Elsa to continue their travels to Zion. By 1856, they had arrived in Iowa, where they married before crossing the plains with an ox team company. They entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1857 (see Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1).\n\nFor a time, the young couple resided in Cottonwood, Salt Lake County, before moving to Spanish Fork, Utah County. By 1859, they had accepted a settling assignment to Sanpete County. On 5 June 1861, John received a certificate of naturalization, announcing his United States citizenship (see Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1). That same year, he was endowed on 23 November 1861 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City.\n\nAlthough so much seemed to be going right for John, it was not long before the Black Hawk War required his military service. He willingly protected settlers in Sanpete County.\n\nAfter the threat of war passed, he joined with Scandinavian friends to form a mercantile business called the Moroni Co-operative Mercantile Institution (see Carter, Our Pioneer Heritage, 12:174). Six years later, he became an elders quorum president. On 9 October 1875, he was ordained a seventy by Orson Pratt (see Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1).\n\nThis ordination preceded his mission call to Scandinavia in 1875. He arrived in Copenhagen on 27 November 1875 and was assigned to labor in the Skåne Conference. During this mission, he gathered much genealogical information (see “Biographical Sketch of John N. Larson,” 1). After completing the mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 8 September 1876 aboard the steamer Cameo with 150 emigrating Latter-day Saints and other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 225).\n\nAfter returning to Utah, John again took up carpentry, farming, and sheepherding. He owned many sheep in the cooperative public herd (see Larson, “History of John N. Larson,” 2). He served on the board of directors of the Moroni Co-operative Merchandise store (see Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1). When time permitted, he donated his carpentry skills to build the Manti and St. George temples.\n\nJohn died in 1898 in his home at Moroni, Sanpete County, at age seventy. The physician who examined him shortly before his death stated that he had no disease but was simply “worn out” (Cooper, “Biographical Facts for John Nils Larsson,” 1). His biographer wrote that “his hair remained almost black and he still possessed all his natural teeth” at the time of his death (Larson, “History of John N. Larson,” 2).\n\nLars Erik Larson\n\n1842–1924\n\nResidence: Richmond, Cache Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 30 April 1889\n\nMissionary labors: Göteborg Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 2 April 1891\n\nName of departure ship: Volo\n\nBirth date: 22 February 1842\n\nBirthplace: Botten Östergård, Julita, Södermanland, Sweden\n\nFather: Larson, Lars\n\nMother: Axelsdotter, Anna Stina\n\nSpouse: Gustafson, Bertha Sophia\n\nMarriage date: 16 April 1871\n\nMarriage place: Julita, Södermanland, Sweden\n\nSpouse: Holm, Cecilia Par\n\nMarriage date: 8 June 1904\n\nSpouse: Sanders, Othelia\n\nMarriage date: 1921\n\nDeath date: 30 June 1924\n\nDeath place: Richmond, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Richmond, Cache Co., Utah\n\nLars emigrated from Sweden to America in 1881. He had settled in Logan, Cache County, Utah, by 10 June 1881. By the late 1880s, he was residing in Richmond, Cache County (see “L. E. Larsen,” Deseret News, 2 July 1924).\n\nWhile in that community, he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1889. He arrived in Copenhagen on 30 April 1889 and was assigned to labor in the Göteborg Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 2 April 1891 aboard the steamer Volo with forty-three emigrating Latter-day Saints and other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 318).\n\nHe returned to the States and continued his residency in Utah. He was confined to his bed for the last eight months of his life. He died in 1924 at his home in Richmond from ailments incident to age (see “L. E. Larsen,” Deseret News, 2 July 1924). He was eighty-two years old.\n\nLars Niels Larson\n\n(Lars Nilsson)\n\n1826–92\n\nResidence: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 6 November 1880\n\nMissionary labors: Skåne Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 13 October 1882\n\nName of departure ship: Cato\n\nBirth date: 8 June 1826\n\nBirthplace: Brodda, Slimminge, Malmöhus, Sweden\n\nFather: Larsson, Nils\n\nMother: Hansdotter, Karna\n\nSpouse:Joransson, Botilda (Matilda)\n\nMarriage date: 24 July 1856\n\nMarriage place: Iowa\n\nSpouse: Joransson (Jorgansen), Pernella\n\nMarriage date: 23 October 1859\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Joransson (Jorgansen), Johannah\n\nMarriage date: 23 October 1859\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 8 May 1892\n\nDeath place: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Moroni, Sanpete Co., Utah\n\nLars was the first of his family to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was baptized on 22 April 1852. He served as a local missionary in Sweden. He was instrumental in converting his family before being cast into prison for three weeks for preaching. After his release, he often went hungry “because he knew the Saints often times would give to the missionaries and go without themselves” (Anderson, “Some of the Incidents of My Father’s Life—History of Lars N. Larson,” 1).\n\nHe journeyed from Sweden to America in 1854 with his parents. Coming up the Mississippi River, his father died. His mother died in Alton, Madison County, Illinois. Lars stayed in Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa, for three years to earn enough money to continue his journey to the Salt Lake Valley. In Iowa, he married his first wife. Unfortunately, she passed away a year later. He continued his journey to the Salt Lake Valley in 1857. On the journey, he had no money and was unable to communicate because he could not understand the English language (see Anderson, “Some of the Incidents of My Father’s Life—History of Lars N. Larson,” 1).\n\nHe settled in Moroni, Sanpete County. While residing in that community, family members recalled that\n\nHe had faith in the God that he worshiped\n\nAnd the Prophets of these latter days,\n\nHe answered the call “Come to Zion”\n\nTo the Lord’s house on the top of the mountain\n\nIn the choice land of the free and the brave.\n\nLars accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1880. He was called at night to accept the mission assignment, and the next morning he left to serve. As a result of his quick response, he was called the “Minute man” (Anderson, “Some of the Incidents of My Father’s Life—History of Lars N. Larson,” 1).\n\nHe arrived in Copenhagen on 6 November 1880 and was assigned to labor in the Skåne Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 13 October 1882 aboard the steamer Cato. Aboard ship, Lars assisted Peter O. Hansen as a leader of the 108 emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 250, 252, 257, 266).\n\nAfter returning from the mission, he worked as a logger in the canyons to get needed wood to build meetinghouses and other public buildings. He also ran a butcher shop until his health failed (see Anderson, “Some of the Incidents of My Father’s Life—History of Lars N. Larson,” 1). Lars died in 1892 in Moroni at age sixty-five.\n\nJohn Lawrence\n\n(Johan Petter Larsson)\n\n1853–1934\n\nResidence: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 1 May 1891\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 30 March 1893\n\nBirth date: 6 September 1853\n\nBirthplace: Ärentuna, Uppsala, Sweden\n\nFather: Persson, Lars\n\nMother: Pehrsdotter, Anna Lisa\n\nSpouse: Lindqvist, Emma Louisa\n\nMarriage date: 25 August 1873\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 23 June 1934\n\nDeath place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Salt Lake City Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nJohn was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 26 July 1869 by G. O. Jensen. Two years later, at age nineteen, he immigrated to the United States. He settled in Provo, Utah County, Utah, where he operated a lumber mill for ten years. He then moved to Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah.\n\nJohn was a resident of Salt Lake City when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia in 1891. He arrived in Copenhagen on 1 May 1891 and was assigned to labor in the Stockholm Conference. After completing an honorable mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 30 March 1893 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 319, 321, 333).\n\nSoon after returning to Salt Lake City, John was selected as the president of the Scandinavian meetings held in that city (see Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, 2:379).\n\nJohn worked in the City and County Building and then served as an engineer at the Presiding Bishop’s office for twenty years. He then became the Salt Lake Temple engineer.\n\nOn the morning of 23 June 1934, he was attempting to trace the cause of a motor failure in the Salt Lake Temple. A test bulb exploded in his hands, and he was severely burned. He was given first aid treatment and was advised to go to the hospital for further treatment. On his way to change his clothes, he collapsed. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. Funeral services were held in the LeGrand Ward chapel (see “Engineer at Temple Dies,” Deseret News, 23 June 1934).\n\nHarold Fridtjoff Liljenquist\n\n1857–1936\n\nResidence: Hyrum, Cache Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 28 September 1890\n\nMissionary labors: Copenhagen Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 18 August 1892\n\nName of departure ship: Wilson\n\nBirth date: 19 January 1857\n\nBirthplace: Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nFather: Liljenquist, Ola Nilsson\n\nMother: Jacobsdatter, Anna Christine Hansen\n\nSpouse: Rasmussen, Laurine\n\nMarriage date: 1 January 1876\n\nMarriage place: Hyrum, Cache Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 14 January 1936\n\nDeath place: Hyrum, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Hyrum City Cemetery, Hyrum, Cache Co., Utah\n\nOla N. Liljenquist, Harold’s father, was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 4 September 1852 by John E. Forsgren. Because of their strong belief in their new faith, Harold’s parents probably didn’t register Ola’s birth with the Lutheran Church authorities.\n\nHarold began emigrating with his parents from Copenhagen to America on 13 April 1857. In Liverpool he boarded the Westmoreland with a company of 554 Latter-day Saints, mostly Scandinavians. They arrived at Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, on 31 May 1857. They traveled by train to Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa. They departed from Iowa in the wagon company of Mathais Cowley. At that time, Harold was only six months old. The wagon company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on 13 September 1857 (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 12).\n\nHe and his family first settled in Spanish Fork, Utah County. By 1859, they were residing in Goshen, Utah County. By the fall of 1862, the family had moved to Hyrum, Cache County. In this community, Harold attended school and was baptized in June 1865 by Andrew A. Allen Sr. (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 13).\n\nAs a boy, he learned to sort lumber and keep accounts of the lumber at the Church ranch in Blacksmith Fort Canyon. As he grew to manhood, he was ordained a seventy on 7 January 1889. He served a home mission in the Cache Stake beginning on 4 November 1889. He was released from the home mission upon receiving a mission call to Scandinavia in 1890 from Wilford Woodruff. He temporarily left his wife and five children to fulfill the mission (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 16).\n\nHe arrived in Copenhagen on 28 September 1890 and was assigned to labor in the Copenhagen Conference. He served in the North Sjælland and Copenhagen branches. He also served as a traveling missionary in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 16).\n\nOn this mission, he baptized thirty-two persons and confirmed twenty. From 1891 to 1892, he was president of the Copenhagen Conference. After completing the mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 18 August 1892 aboard the steamer Wilson. He was one of two elders—the other being Nils Borgeson—in charge of forty-nine emigrating Latter-day Saints bound for Hull, England (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 326, 495). From Hull, he traveled by train to Liverpool, where he was assigned to care for ninety-seven emigrating Scandinavian Saints aboard the Wyoming (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 16–17).\n\nWhen the Wyoming arrived in New York Harbor, the ship was quarantined for 12l days as four of the passengers had contracted cholera. During those days, Harold became known as the “Mormon Interpreter.” When the quarantine ended, he traveled by train to Salt Lake City, arriving on 27 September 1892. He returned to Hyrum, Cache County, Utah, after an absence of twenty-five months (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 17).\n\nUpon returning home, he was called to be president of the YMMIA, assistant superintendent, and then superintendent of the Sunday School in the Hyrum Ward. On 26 August 1901, he was ordained a high priest by Marriner W. Merrill. He served as bishop of the Hyrum First Ward from 1901 to 1913. He also served as county commissioner for one term, mayor of Hyrum for three terms, and a member of city council for seven terms. He served four terms as deputy county assessor and one term as the leader of the Silver Grey Brass Band in Cache Valley. He worked for the Amalgamated Sugar Company as a fieldman for twenty-two years (see “Sketch of the Life of Harold F. Liljenquist, My Grandfather,” 17–18). Harold died in 1936 in Hyrum at age seventy-eight.\n\nGustaf Lindahl\n\n1867–1921\n\nResidence: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 27 May 1892\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 5 April 1894\n\nName of departure ship: Bravo\n\nBirth date: 5 August 1867\n\nBirthplace: Väddö, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nFather: Lindahl, Anders\n\nMother: Jönsdotter, Greta Charlotte\n\nSpouse: Lindberg, Hannah\n\nMarriage date: 3 December 1896\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 2 August 1921\n\nDeath place: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nGustaf immigrated to the United States on 17 October 1889, two years after he was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was a resident of the Salt Lake Thirteenth Ward, Salt Lake County, Utah, when received a mission call to Scandinavia in 1892. He arrived in Copenhagen on 27 May 1892 and was assigned to labor in the Stockholm Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 5 April 1894 aboard the steamer Bravo with thirteen emigrating Latter-day Saints and other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 328–29, 336).\n\nUpon returning from his mission, Gustaf married and eventually found his way to way to Mount Pleasant, Sanpete County, Utah (see Mount Pleasant South Ward Records FHL 0002056; 1900 U.S. Census, Mount Pleasant, Sanpete, Utah FHL 1241686, ED 129, 24). The 1900 U.S. Census lists his occupation as a mineral agent.\n\nHe was later moved to Provo, Utah County, Utah, where he died in the Utah State Mental Hospital on 2 August 1921. He was buried in the Provo Cemetery (see Provo Sexton Record 979.224 V2h, 1).\n\nNiels Rasmussen Lindahl\n\n(Nils Nilsson)\n\n1837–1922\n\nResidence: Union, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 6 November 1880\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 6 April 1883\n\nName of departure ship: Cato\n\nBirth date: 18 May 1837\n\nBirthplace: Svedala, Malmöhus, Sweden\n\nFather: Rasmussen, Nils\n\nMother: Hansdotter, Bengta\n\nSpouse: Larsson, Kersti\n\nMarriage date: 1863\n\nMarriage place: Sweden\n\nSpouse: Olson, Gustava Johanson (Brax),\n\nMarriage date: about 1904\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 13 October 1922\n\nDeath place: Midvale, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nNiels was the son of a rich peasant who died when he was eleven years old. His mother had difficulty raising the children after his death. Niels was not raised by his mother. He was raised at the expense of the government. In spite of these early hardships, he received a good education (Autobiography of Nils Rasmussen, 1837–1922; Morgenstjernen 4 (1885): 7–13; Bitton, Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies, 213).\n\nOn 16 September 1857, Niels was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Johan Holmstedt. He was ordained an elder on 18 March 1858. For four years, he labored as a local missionary in the Skåne Conference before immigrating to America. He crossed the ocean on the sailing vessel Athenia with the O. N. Liljenquist company. He crossed the plains with Captain Joseph Horne’s ox team company, arriving in the Salt Lake Valley on 14 October 1862 (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 154).\n\nHe located in Moroni, Sanpete County, and later in Ephraim, Sanpete County. He accepted a call to settle in Circle Valley, Piute County, in 1865. Due to Indian problems in the area, he lost his property and returned to Moroni (see Lund, Scandinavian Jubilee Album, 154).\n\nNiels was endowed on 30 January 1868 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. In that same year, he worked on the railroad in Weber Canyon. He then began a series of relocations including Santaquin, Utah County, and Union Ward, Salt Lake County, before returning to Moroni (see Autobiography of Nils Rasmussen, 1837–1922; Morgenstjernen 4 (1885): 7–13; Bitton, Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies, 213). He was ordained a seventy on 18 June 1876.\n\nIn 1880, while a resident of Union (now East Midvale), Salt Lake County, he received a mission call to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 6 November 1880 and was assigned to labor in the Stockholm Conference. He served in the Örebro Branch and as president of the Stockholm Conference from 1882 to 1883. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 6 April 1883 aboard the steamer Cato as the leader of the sixty-first company of Latter-day Saints to leave Scandinavia. Aboard the steamer, he had responsibility for 103 emigrating Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 269, 484).\n\nNiels fulfilled a second mission to Sweden from 1894 to 1896. He arrived in Copenhagen on 18 February 1894 and was assigned to be president of the Stockholm Conference. On 2 April 1896 he departed from Copenhagen (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 338, 352, 484).\n\nHe returned to his home in Salt Lake County, where he died in 1922 at age eighty-five of pneumonia. He was a retired farmer. He was survived by his widow and two sons and one daughter (see “Niels R. Lindahl of East Midvale Dies,” Deseret News, 14 October 1922).\n\nJonas Eliason Lindberg\n\n(Jonas Eliasson)\n\n1833–1897\n\nResidence: Tooele, Tooele Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 27 November 1877\n\nMissionary labors: Göteborg Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 23 June 1879\n\nName of departure ship: Cato\n\nBirth date: 7 June 1833\n\nBirthplace: Tegen, Dalskog, Älvsborg, Sweden\n\nFather: Andersson, Elias\n\nMother: Jakobsdotter, Elin\n\nSpouse: Jacobsdotter, Maja (Mary)\n\nMarriage date: 22 April 1862\n\nMarriage place: Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany (at dock on board ship)\n\nSpouse: Jonason, Anna\n\nMarriage date: 17 August 1874\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 1 January 1897\n\nDeath place: Tooele, Tooele Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Tooele, Tooele Co., Utah\n\nJonas was the tenth of eleven children. At age twenty-three, he and four of his siblings were baptized on 17 September 1856 by Charles Fayell. He served as a local missionary in Göteborg. During this mission, he was arrested and persecuted, passing through many hardships (see Clark, “Family History: Jonas E. Lindberg and Wives—Mary Jacobson and Anna Jonason,” 1).\n\nAfter nearly six years of missionary work, Jonas immigrated to America in 1862. He paid for his emigration expenses by working as a shoemaker. He crossed the plains with his wife, whom he married on the journey. They arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on 23 September 1862. A few months later, Jonas was endowed on 7 January 1863 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City (see Clark, “Family History: Jonas E. Lindberg and Wives—Mary Jacobson and Anna Jonason,” 2).\n\nBy 1863, he and his family had moved to Tooele and purchased property on Main Street. Next to their home, Jonas operated a shoe shop. He was reported to be a good worker and usually had all the work he could possibly do (see Lindberg, “Jonas E. Lindberg History,” 2).\n\nThat was until 1877 when he accepted a mission call to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 27 November 1877 and was assigned to labor in the Göteborg Conference. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 23 June 1879 aboard the steamer Cato with 331 emigrating Latter-day Saints and other missionaries (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 230–31, 240, 261).\n\nHe returned to the States, where he once again worked at his trade. Unfortunately, his work was interrupted on 14 June 1886 when Jonas was arrested for unlawful cohabitation. According to family tradition, the judge told him that if he were “willing to abide by the law, we will let you go. Father arose in court and bore his testimony that he knew the principle to be true as it was in the days of the ancient prophets” (Lindberg, “Jonas E. Lindberg History,” 3). On 20 September 1886, he was sentenced by Judge Zane to eighteen months of imprisonment and a three-hundred-dollar fine. After serving this sentence, he was discharged from the penitentiary on 22 March 1887 (see Clark, “History of Jonas Eliason Lindberg and Wives—Mary Jacobson and Anna Jonason,” 3).\n\nHe returned to his home in Tooele, where he served as a president of the Forty-third Quorum of the Seventy. He also presided over the Scandinavian meetings in the community. “On his death bed, he pleaded with his children to continue his temple work and gave each of his children a father’s blessing” (Clark, “Family History: Jonas E. Lindberg and Wives—Mary Jacobson and Anna Jonason,” 3). Jonas died in 1897 in Tooele at age sixty-three.\n\nNils Lindelof\n\n(Nils Pehrsson)\n\n1830–1916\n\nResidence: Plain City, Weber Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 28 May 1872\n\nMissionary labors: Göteborg Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 27 August 1874\n\nName of departure ship: Cato\n\nBirth date: 19 April 1830\n\nBirthplace: Landskrona Stadsförsamling, Malmöhus, Sweden\n\nFather: Olsson, Pehr\n\nMother: Nilsdotter, Ingrid\n\nSpouse: Lindblad, Mathilda G.\n\nMarriage date: 23 January 1892\n\nMarriage place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 8 June 1916\n\nDeath place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Logan City Cemetery, Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nNils was baptized on 11 April 1854 in Copenhagen, Denmark, by C. Christensen. According to his biographer, “He became active in the interest of spreading the truth among his fellow man.” He labored as a local missionary for nearly seven years in the Skåne Conference before immigrating to America in 1861. He sailed from Liverpool to the United States aboard the Monarch of the Sea and arrived in New York Harbor on 19 June 1861. He journeyed to the Salt Lake Valley and settled in Ogden, Weber County, Utah. Two years later, he moved to Plain City, Weber County (see Diary of Nils Lindelof, 1873–1874; Bitton, Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies, 213).\n\nIt was in Plain City that he received a mission call to Scandinavia in 1872. He arrived in Copenhagen on 28 May 1872 and was assigned to preside over the Göteborg Conference (see Diary of Nils Lindelof, 1873–1874; Bitton, Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies, 213). After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 27 August 1874 aboard the steamer Cato with 214 emigrating Latter-day Saints. After the steamer arrived at Hull, England, Nils took a train to Liverpool, where he boarded the seafaring vessel Wyoming. During the Atlantic crossing, Nils assisted John C. Graham in caring for 123 emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 211, 220; An Enduring Legacy, 12:5).\n\nReturning to Utah, Nils settled in Logan, Cache County. There he was ordained a high priest on 5 June 1884 by C. O. Card. When the Logan First Ward was divided, he was called on 5 June 1885 to be a counselor to Bishop Isaac Smith of the Logan Seventh Ward. Under his direction, a meetinghouse was erected in four months at the cost of six hundred dollars (see Diary of Nils Lindelof, 1873–1874; Bitton, Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies, 213).\n\nNils served a second mission to Scandinavia. He arrived in Copenhagen on 23 November 1886 and was assigned to labor in the Skåne and Göteborg conferences. For a time, he presided over the Göteborg Conference. On 27 September 1888, he sailed from Copenhagen to Hull, England, as the leader of 102 emigrating Latter-day Saints (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 299–300, 306).\n\nHe returned once again to Logan. Nils died in 1916 in that community at age eighty-six. His funeral services were held in the Logan Seventh Ward. It was said of him, “He died in full faith and fellowship in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (“Lindelof Funeral Held on Sunday,” Logan Journal, 13 June 1916).\n\nCharles John Aaron Lindquist\n\n1864–1934\n\nResidence: Provo, Utah Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 4 May 1883\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 15 June 1885\n\nName of departure ship: Panther\n\nBirth date: 24 July 1864\n\nBirthplace: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nFather: Lindquist, Niels Aaron\n\nMother: Hoglund (Hagerlund), Josephine Caroline\n\nSpouse: Ness, Amelia Kjerstine (Larson)\n\nMarriage date: 16 August 1888\n\nMarriage place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nSpouse: Theurer, Ada Christina\n\nMarriage date: 12 May 1915\n\nMarriage place: Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 4 December 1934\n\nDeath place: Ogden, Weber Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Ogden City Cemetery, Ogden, Weber Co., Utah\n\nCharles was born one year after his parents arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. In Logan, Cache County, Utah, he was apprenticed to his father to learn the trade of making furniture and caskets (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 274).\n\nCharles received his endowment on 5 April 1883, just prior to serving a mission in Sweden. On that mission, he presided over the Eskilstuna, Södermanland County, Västmanland County and Dalarna (Kopparberg, Värmland, and Gävleborg counties) branches. Returning to Logan, he labored in the YMMIA before moving to Ogden, Weber County, on 12 January 1887 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 274).\n\nIn Ogden, Charles worked for the Stratford Company to support his family. By 1889, he had entered into the funeral directing business, having purchased the James Gale Undertaking Firm. He became president of the Lindquist Sons-Carlquist Company of Ogden and Salt Lake City. He was the first licensed embalmer in Utah (see correspondence from Shari H. Franke). He worked with George William Larkin and formed a partnership called Larkin-Lindquist in Salt Lake City. The city directory of 1890–91 announced that his company had a full stock of metallic, cement, and hardwood caskets (see Carter, Heart Throbs of the West, 6:319).\n\nCharles accepted a second mission call to Scandinavia in 1903. On 25 May 1903, he arrived in Copenhagen and was assigned to be president of the Stockholm Conference. During his tenure, he selected the site for a new mission home at No. 3 Svartensgatan, Stockholm, Sweden. The property, with improvements, cost nearly two hundred thousand kronor. He was present when the site was dedicated by Heber J. Grant on 23 October 1904 (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 274, 395, 399, 484).\n\nAfter the mission, he returned to Ogden. In the Ogden Second Ward, he served as counselor to Bishop Robert McQuarrie for ten years (see Esshom, Pioneers and Prominent Men of Utah, 1006). By 1927, he was a member of the Weber Stake high council (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 274). He served in the Ogden Chamber of Commerce and was a member of the National Funeral Directors Association. For many years, he was president of the Scandinavian Society of Ogden. He was a member of the Weber County Fish and Game Protective Association (see correspondence from Shari H. Franke).\n\nCharles died from pneumonia in 1934 at a local hospital at age seventy. At the time, he was the oldest active funeral director in the state (see correspondence from Shari H.

He and his wife immigrated to the United States to be with the main body of the Church on 9 June 1884. While residing in Utah, family members recalled that he was anxious to be sealed to his wife in the Logan Temple. He sold his gold watch to pay for their journey from Salt Lake City to Logan (see “Erik Petersson Lundquist and Anna Sophia Lilja,” 1).\n\nIn 1891, Erik received a mission call to Scandinavia. After completing this mission, he departed from Copenhagen on 5 April 1894 aboard the steamer Bravo (see Jenson, History of the Scandinavian Mission, 320–21, 336).\n\nHe returned to his family in Salt Lake City. Erik died in 1902 in Salt Lake City at age seventy-three. He was so beloved by his wife that when he died she exclaimed, “I cannot live without him.” She died nine days later (see “Erik Petersson Lundquist and Anna Sophia Lilja,” 1).\n\nGeorge William Lindquist\n\n1871–1935\n\nResidence: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nArrival date in Copenhagen: 30 April 1892\n\nMissionary labors: Stockholm Conference\n\nDeparture date from Copenhagen: 5 April 1894\n\nName of departure ship: Bravo\n\nBirth date: 29 September 1871\n\nBirthplace: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nFather: Lindquist, Niels Aaron\n\nMother: Hoglund, Josephine Caroline\n\nSpouse: Olsen, Mettina\n\nMarriage date: 3 December 1890\n\nMarriage place: Logan Temple, Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nDeath date: 20 June 1935\n\nDeath place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nBurial place: Logan, Cache Co., Utah\n\nWilliam was baptized on 5 June 1879 by Hans J.
