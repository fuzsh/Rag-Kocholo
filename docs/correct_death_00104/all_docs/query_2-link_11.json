        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1822–93). The presidential election of 1876 between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden was the most bitterly contested in United States history. Both the Democrats and the Republicans accused each other of fraud. Not until March 2, two days before President Grant’s term expired, was the issue at last settled. The electoral commission decided in favor of the Republican candidate, Hayes.\n\nBirth and Boyhood\n\nRutherford Birchard Hayes was born in Delaware, Ohio, October 4, 1822. Five years earlier his father, Rutherford Hayes, had moved to Ohio from Vermont with his wife, Sophia Birchard Hayes, and Mrs. Hayes’s brother, Sardis Birchard. Mr. Hayes invested his money in good farmland, which he rented, and built for his family the first brick house in Delaware. He died 10 weeks before Rutherford, who was known as Ruddy, was born. Her brother took over the guardianship of her three children, Lorenzo, Fanny, and Ruddy, and acted as a father to them.\n\nBefore Ruddy was two years old his brother, Lorenzo, then nine years old, was drowned while skating. Mrs. Hayes determined to protect little Ruddy, who was delicate, from all perils. She would not allow him to play with the boys in the neighborhood or go to school; and she herself taught him reading and spelling. The boy’s sole companion was his sister Fanny, a bright, active girl two years older than himself. The two children read together and played together. Fanny loved poetry; she was also a tomboy and could always think of something exciting to do.\n\nAt 14, Rutherford was sent to a school in Norwalk, Ohio. The next year he attended an academy in Middletown, Connecticut. At 16 he entered Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio. The next year Fanny married William Platt, who had a jewelry store in Columbus. Mrs. Hayes gave up the old home to live with the Platts in Columbus.\n\nRutherford was a serious student, and his diary (which he kept all his life) shows that he tried constantly to improve his character as well as his mind. At 19 he wrote: “I am determined to acquire a character distinguished for energy, firmness, and perseverance.” He resolved also to “preserve a reputation for honesty and benevolence.” He even decided to stop laughing “entirely in future, if I can” because “the tendency to carry it to extremes is so great.” His chief interest in school was debating, in which he excelled. His recreations were fishing, playing chess, and reading novels (though he called novels “trash”).\n\nHe Becomes a Lawyer and Marries\n\nAfter graduating from Kenyon, Hayes spent a year in Fanny’s home reading law and studying German and French. Then his Uncle Sardis furnished money for him to study at the Harvard Law School. Hayes was almost 21 when he arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Dressed in a modish manner, he looked like a proper Bostonian. He studied until he was weary and tried hard to be still more serious. “Trifling remarks, boyish conduct, are my crying sins. Mend! Mend!” In January 1845 he received the bachelor of laws degree.\n\nInstead of returning to Columbus, Hayes went into a law office in Lower Sandusky (later called Fremont), where his Uncle Sardis lived. He spent nearly five years in the small village waiting for clients. Then he became restless and despondent and had spells of weeping. After a vacation in the East, he decided to move to Cincinnati, then a growing, thriving city.\n\nIn Cincinnati, Hayes and another young man rented an office and partitioned off one corner for a bedroom. Hayes joined the Literary Club, where he made influential friends, and the Sons of Temperance, for whom he made his first public speech. He also entered local politics in the new Republican party. Within a few years he had made a name for himself as a criminal lawyer and began to think of marriage.\n\nHayes’s mother chose a girl for him. She was Lucy Ware Webb, whom Hayes had first met at his home in Delaware when she was 15. They became engaged after she was graduated from Wesleyan Female College in Cincinnati and were married in December 1852. Hayes was then 30. Lucy, nine years younger, was warmhearted, popular, and very religious. “A better wife I never hoped to have,” Hayes confided to his diary. Their first son, Birchard Austin, was born in 1853.\n\nHe Serves in the Civil War\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, in 1861, Hayes at once volunteered and was given the rank of major. Camping in the beautiful mountains of western Virginia (later West Virginia) he “enjoyed” the war, he said, “as if it were a pleasure tour.” In 1862 he suffered a wound in an arm and Lucy went to the camp to nurse him. In 1864 he was in the thick of the fighting in the Shenandoah Valley with Gen. Philip Sheridan. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant commended him for conspicuous gallantry, and he left the army a brevetted major general of volunteers.\n\nAs Congressman and Governor\n\nHayes was nominated and elected to Congress while still in the army, but he refused to leave his command until the war was over. He took his seat in the House in December 1865 and was reelected in 1866. He made few speeches and took no part in the bitter debates over reconstruction but voted consistently with his party.\n\nIn 1867 and again in 1869 Hayes was elected governor of Ohio. He proved a capable and economical administrator. He took great interest in prison reform and in hospitals for the mentally ill. His beloved sister Fanny had been hospitalized more than once for mental illness.\n\nIn 1873 Hayes declared he was finished with politics and moved his family to his uncle’s house at Fremont, called Spiegel Grove. His uncle died the next year and left the bulk of his large estate (chiefly land) to Hayes. The Hayeses now had five children (three had died in childhood). The oldest boys, Birchard, Webb, and Rutherford, were at college. At home were Fanny, seven; and Scott Russell, four. Hayes was the leading citizen of Fremont and was listed in the directory as a “capitalist.”\n\nHayes’s retirement was brief. After one year he was persuaded to run for Congress; but the Democrats swept the country in 1874 and he was defeated. Ohio itself had elected a Democratic governor in 1873. The Republicans, knowing Hayes to be a good vote getter, nominated him for governor again in 1875. Hayes’s success in a hard-fought campaign made him a presidential possibility in 1876.\n\nThe Disputed Presidential Election\n\nThe Republican nominating convention met in Cincinnati. Grant’s decision not to seek a third term left the field open. The leading candidate was Senator James G. Blaine, the so-called “plumed knight.” Blaine had been accused of graft, and reformers controlled the convention. Hayes suited the reformers as well as the practical politicians; moreover, he would bring in the needed Ohio vote. Gradually the drift to Hayes gathered strength, and Ohio’s “favorite son” won out over the brilliant senator. Congressman William A. Wheeler of New York was nominated vice president.\n\nThe Democratic party also nominated a reform candidate—Samuel J. Tilden, who had helped to overthrow the Tammany Hall Tweed Ring in New York City. The new National Independent party, commonly called the Greenback party, nominated Peter Cooper, a New York philanthropist. The campaign was bitterly fought, although the platforms of the two major parties differed little. Both were for “hard money,” civil service reform, and an end to corruption in government. The Greenback party wanted to raise farm prices by inflating the currency with paper money. The Republicans had many handicaps—the scandals of Grant’s administrations; the abuses of reconstruction in the South; and the hard times that still persisted following the panic of 1873.\n\nOn election night Hayes went to bed convinced that he had lost the election. The next day, however, the Republican campaign manager, Zachary Chandler, boldly proclaimed Hayes the victor.\n\nThree Southern states—South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana—had sent in double returns. In these states the election boards were dominated by Republicans (some of them “carpetbaggers” from the North). They refused to accept the apparent Democratic majorities and certified that the states had gone Republican. The Democrats, however, sent in their own returns. On both sides there was undoubtedly fraud.\n\nWeek after week congress debated the election. The Senate, which was Republican, declared for Hayes. The House, which was Democratic, said Tilden had won. The year ended with no decision reached. Finally Congress appointed an electoral commission to re-count the entire vote. The commission consisted of eight Republicans and seven Democrats. The vote on every count was eight to seven.\n\nWhen it became clear that the commission would decide for Hayes, the Southern Democrats agreed to accept him if the Republicans would enter into a “bargain.” More than the election of Tilden—a Northerner—they wanted Federal troops withdrawn from the South and the return of self-government to the states. The Republicans agreed; and on March 2 the commission announced that Hayes had 185 electoral votes and Tilden 184. Tilden would have been elected if only one of the 20 disputed electoral votes had gone to him. His popular vote was 4,284,020; Hayes’s was 4,036,572.\n\nHayes had to set off for Washington before he knew with certainty what the commission’s decision would be. Although he felt some doubt, he sincerely believed he was entitled to the election.\n\nThe Hayes Family in the White House\n\nA new order began in the White House when the Hayeses moved in. Like Queen Victoria in England, they determined to set an example in their home life for the nation to follow. They had no dances or card parties, and wine never appeared on the table, even at state dinners.\n\nIn informal gatherings they continued the customs of their Ohio home. The family consisted of the youngest children, Fanny and Scott, and Webb. Webb, a Cornell graduate, was his father’s confidential secretary. Birchard was at Harvard Law School, and Rutherford was at Cornell.\n\nEvery morning at breakfast a chapter of the Bible was read, each person in turn reading one verse. Then all joined in the Lord’s Prayer. Each evening there were hymns as well as prayers. On Sunday mornings President and Mrs. Hayes walked to the small Foundry Methodist church near the White House.\n\nMrs. Hayes was hospitable and liked to fill the house with young people. At times, Webb said, there were cots in the hall and couches in the reception room, and he considered himself fortunate to sleep on the billiard table (which had been relegated to the attic). Sometimes his father “had to lock himself in the bathroom to prepare some important state paper.”\n\nThe most unusual social event was the Hayes’s silver wedding anniversary, in 1877. Mrs. Hayes wore her original wedding dress, and the couple repeated their vows before the same minister who had married them 25 years before. Then the Hayes’s two youngest children were baptized and christened.\n\nA Strong and Conscientious Administration\n\nThe presidency was weak and Congress strong when Hayes moved into the White House. Powerful senators had impeached President Andrew Johnson and overawed Grant.\n\nThey expected to control Hayes also and were by no means pleased with the tone of his inaugural address. The people of the country, however, applauded his much-quoted statement, “He serves his party best who serves his country best.”\n\nHayes incurred the enmity of many Republican leaders by carrying out the “bargain.” The “carpetbag” governments to which Hayes owed his election at once collapsed, and the South thereafter became solidly Democratic.\n\nIn April 1877 the last Federal troops were withdrawn from the South, and the long bitter period of reconstruction that followed the Civil War was at last ended.\n\nHayes next attacked the corrupt “spoils system”—the giving of government jobs to party workers as a reward for securing votes. In this he had the help of his secretary of the interior, Carl Schurz. Congress refused to pass civil service legislation or to appropriate money for examinations; but Hayes did succeed in awakening public interest, and civil service reform clubs sprang up in many states.\n\nThe worst abuses of the spoils system were in the customhouse of New York City. Hayes incurred the bitter enmity of Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York by dismissing Conkling’s political friends from the top posts. One of the officials he dismissed was Chester A. Arthur, collector of the port of New York, who was later to become the twenty-first President of the United States. The other official he dismissed, Alonzo B. Cornell, became governor of New York in 1879.\n\nThe Money Question\n\nHayes was anxious to return the country to the gold standard by carrying out the provisions of the Specie Resumption Act passed in Grant’s administration. This act called for making United States paper money redeemable in coin by January 1, 1879. Hayes’s secretary of the treasury, John Sherman of Ohio, sold bonds to build up a gold reserve to be used on the day of resumption of specie payments.\n\nIn Congress there were inflationist groups in both the major parties that wanted plentiful, cheap money. There was also the small Greenback party, which demanded a larger circulation of paper money. These groups passed, over the president’s veto, the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, which required the secretary of the treasury to purchase not less than 2 million dollars of silver bullion each month and coin it into dollars. Silver dollars had not been coined since 1806. Because of their weight and bulk they proved unpopular, and most did not circulate but remained in the treasury.\n\nResumption of specie payments began quietly on January 1, 1879. Knowledge that every paper dollar was worth a gold dollar gave confidence to the businessmen, and the run on the treasury that had been expected did not take place. Foreign trade revived, and the depression began to lift. When Hayes left the White House the country was again prosperous.\n\nReturn to Spiegel Grove\n\nHayes had said before his election that he would not be a candidate for a second term. No one pressed him to change his mind. He stayed away from the nominating convention of 1880 and took no part in the campaign, though he approved of the candidate chosen—James A. Garfield. After leaving office Hayes was a man without a party, but he had won the affection and admiration of many people.\n\nBack in Spiegel Grove, the Hayeses lived in ease and comfort and were never long without guests. Hayes worked for prison reform and crime prevention and became president of the Peabody Education Fund, which aimed to promote education in the South. He worked for improved education and training for black people. Rutherford B. Hayes died on January 17, 1893. His wife, Lucy, had died four years before. Both of them were buried in Spiegel Grove."
