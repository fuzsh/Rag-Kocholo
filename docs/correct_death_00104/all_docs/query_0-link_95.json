Gedert, of Catawba Island Township and formerly of Fremont, Ohio, died June 2, 2023, at Otterbein Marblehead, where she had been a resident since 2019. She celebrated her 87th birthday on May 11. On that date in 1936, Maureen was born a twin in Toledo, Ohio, to Daniel M. and Gertrude H. Rahilly. Maureen and her family grew up in the Old West End neighborhood in Toledo. She graduated from Central Catholic High School in 1954. Maureen had a desire to help other people, and so she attended Mercy Hospital School of Nursing. She received her nursing degree in 1957. It was during her time at Mercy Hospital that Maureen met the love of her life, Robert Gedert, a young medical intern working on his general surgery residency. From that moment on, they were a power duo: Maureen and Bob, Buz and Buzzy, Mo and Bo, nurse and doctor. They were married on May 9, 1959, at Rosary Cathedral in Toledo. They spent almost 60 wonderful years together before Dr. Gedert's death on Jan. 13, 2018. After their wedding, the couple moved to New York City to work and so Bob could complete his medical residency at Memorial Sloan Kettering. In 1963, the couple returned to Northwest Ohio to start a family. They settled on Hayes Avenue in Fremont, where they raised their children and made lifelong friends. Maureen stayed home to care for the family, but returned to work at Memorial Hospital in Fremont after her youngest graduated high school. Maureen worked as a surgical nurse with her husband in the operating room every morning, and as a nurse in his office every afternoon. Mom and Dad loved to work together helping to heal people, a notable accomplishment for the couple. Maureen was a member of the Toledo Diocesan Council of Nurses and the Women's Auxiliary of Memorial Hospital, where she served for many years as chairman. Upon their retirement, Maureen and Bob moved to their lakefront home in Catawba Island Township, where they enjoyed boat rides, swimming off their dock and watching amazing sunsets over Lake Erie. Maureen had many friends and knew no strangers. She was a great conversationalist and had a spunky sense of humor. She enjoyed cooking; golfing; playing bridge with friends; gardening; reading; praying the rosary; hanging out with family pets; helping stray animals; and going to dinner parties. She and Bob also enjoyed taking weeks-long trips during the winter to Florida, to see their son and daughter-in-law. Maureen liked to spend time with her young grandson, Aidan Meister, and the two of them could frequently be found walking Aidan's dog, Fletch, hanging out at the library or eating at McDonald's. If you were friends with one of Maureen's kids, you were one of her kids, too, and you could count on getting not only advice, but sometimes help with an injury or illness. Maureen was a member of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Marblehead. Surviving are son, Paul Gedert (Saloa) of Boca Raton, Fla.; daughters Roberta Meister (Eric), and Beth Gedert, both of Port Clinton; grandsons Aidan Meister and Nicholas Rendon; special niece, Shelby Rahilly Jasmer and numerous other family members.

Irene will be remembered by her family and friends as an extremely open hearted, passionately competitive and accepting person. Irene welcomed all those in her life with genuine kindness and unconditional love. She enjoyed quilting beautiful blankets, playing cards and being by the water which included swimming any chance she got. If you were lucky enough to know Irene, you may have had a chance to enjoy one of her delicious and \"healthy\" pies!

She was a strong and beautiful soul, and meant so much to her loved ones. Irene made everyone feel like family and taught those around her that devotion to family and faith were the keys to happiness (and winning at euchre certainly helped too).
