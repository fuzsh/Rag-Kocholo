        "text": "Rutherford B. Hayes, America's 19th President, served as chief executive at the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the modern industrial age. He was well suited to the task, having earned a steadfast reputation for integrity throughout his career as a soldier and a statesman. Upstanding, moral, and honest, Hayes was ironically elected after one of the most lengthy, bitterly disputed, and corrupt presidential elections in American history.\n\nProfessor Ari Hoogenboom wrote the original essays, and Robert D. Johnston revised them in 2020. Johnston is Professor of History and Director of the Teaching of History Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has served as co-editor of the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era."
