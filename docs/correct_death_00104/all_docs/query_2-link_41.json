        "text": "On October 4, 1822, Rutherford B. Hayes was born in a brick house on East William Street in Delaware, Ohio, although the precise location of his birth was forgotten and the matter of where, exactly in Delaware Hayes was born was a matter of debate until the 1950s. Hayes' father died before Hayes was born and his mother raised him and his sister, aided by her brother, Sardis Birchard. Hayes served in the Civil War, being wounded multiple times, and was elected to the U.S. congress in 1864 and as Ohio's Governor in 1867, before taking office as President in 1877.\n\nThe house was partially brick and partially a wooden frame house, and the frame portion was destroyed in a fire in 1910.\n\nThe structure had fallen into disrepair and was razed in 1926, with a historical marker being placed on the site by the Daughters of the American Revolution. It is now a BP gas station, having previously been a Standard Oil Gas Station.\n\nDelaware, Ohio, Birthplace of the 19th President of the United States.\n\nVan Sickle, C.E.. \"The Birthplace of President Hayes: A Study in Oral Tradition.\" The Delaware Gazette (Delaware, Ohio) March 7th, 1953. .\n\nThe Birthplace of President Hayes.
