        "text": "(Mental Floss) -- We don't recall ever seeing them on our coins, stamps, or monuments, but we're told the following seven men were once president of the United States. Go figure!\n\nHerbert Hoover (President #31, 1929--1933)\n\nAlthough Herbert Hoover won the 1928 presidential election with almost 60 percent of the vote, today he's basically remembered as a dam. Actually, many Americans probably think he was an FBI director or the guy who invented a vacuum.\n\nBut Hoover was, in fact, a U.S. president -- and an interesting one to boot. Orphaned at age 9, he worked and scraped his way into the newly minted Stanford University to study mining engineering.\n\nThere, he married Lou Henry, the only female geology student at the school, and the pair traveled the world evaluating mining sites and learning languages. (In the White House, they often spoke in Mandarin when they didn't want staff eavesdropping.)\n\nHoover's successful coordination of the U.S. Food Administration during WWI paved his way to the Oval Office. Although massively popular early in his term, a little thing called the Great Depression came along and seriously soured his approval rating. Herbert battled bravely against the dusty tide of poverty, but his programs were largely ineffective.\n\nSorry, Herbert. Great dam, though.\n\nMartin Van Buren (President #8, 1837--1841)\n\nDespite earning catchy nicknames such as \"The Little Magician\" and \"The Red Fox of Kinderhook\" on the political battlefield, M.V.B. is far from the MVP of the American presidency.\n\nOne title he can claim, though, is that of the first president not of British descent. Van Buren was the son of a Dutch tavern owner and gained his taste for politics listening to debates in the rowdy rooms of the family saloon.\n\nA self-taught lawyer, the politically adept Van Buren quickly rose up the governmental ranks, landing a spot as President Andrew Jackson's secretary of state in 1828. By keeping clear of the Cabinet infighting that marred Jackson's first term, Van Buren replaced John Calhoun as Jackson's vice president in the second term.\n\nIn 1836, he won the presidency, but soon fizzled out in a daze of leadership defeats and ineffective policies. Don't look for him on the penny any time soon.\n\nWarren Harding (President #29, 1921--1923)\n\nWarren G. Harding is generally regarded as the worst president ever. He was disappointing from the get-go, as the very basis of his campaign was boring. Harding ran on the promise of a \"return to normalcy,\" which he (somehow) felt people craved following Woodrow Wilson's bold and visionary term.\n\nTo make things worse, Harding ran the White House like a kind of boys' club, where he and some friends known as the \"Ohio Gang\" enjoyed drinking, playing golf, and cheating on their wives. (Harding is widely rumored to have paid a gambling debt with antique White House china.)\n\nAfter admitting to friends that he felt overmatched by the job of president, Harding gave his Cabinet free reign and treated the presidency as more of a ceremonial post.\n\nJust as the friends he'd appointed were being nailed for corruption one after another, Harding contracted what doctors assumed was ptomaine poisoning and died of a related heart attack. No autopsy was performed, but rumors abounded that his wife poisoned him to protect what legacy he had left.\n\nChester Arthur (President #21, 1881--1885)\n\nMost people don't know ol' Chesty for anything other than his mammoth moustache. But he should be remembered as a guy who rose to the occasion.\n\nAs a young man, Arthur worked on civil rights cases in New York before succumbing to the corrupt New York political machine of Roscoe \"Boss\" Conkling. (How anyone could fail to detect corruption in someone named Roscoe \"Boss\" Conkling is beyond us.)\n\nIn 1881, Arthur became vice president under James Garfield, but soon butted heads with the president over an appointment that sapped Conkling's power. In fact, Arthur and Garfield were hardly communicating when, a few months later, Garfield was assassinated, and Arthur suddenly became the big cheese.\n\nInstead of behaving like a pawn as everyone expected, Arthur became a man of the people, taking steps to cut back on cronyism and rebuffing pressures from big business. And what do you call him? The president with the big moustache. Nice going!\n\nMillard Fillmore (President #13, 1850--1853)\n\nToday, Millard Fillmore's name is synonymous with overlooked. Need proof? In February 2006, a group called the Friends of Millard Fillmore will host the 38th annual FOMF Trivia Hunt, a contest celebrating obscure knowledge.\n\nFillmore was born in 1800 to a destitute family, but thanks to a merciless work ethic, he taught himself to read and eventually became a lawyer.\n\nThat quickly segued into politics, and in 1848, the Whigs ran Fillmore for VP alongside Zachary Taylor. The pair won the election, but remained divided by their views on slavery (Taylor being a southern slave owner, and Fillmore, well, not).\n\nWhen Taylor died, Fillmore tried to appease the North and South by supporting the Compromise of 1850. Unfortunately, the move alienated the North and created a fair share of enemies on both sides. Thus tainted, he lost several bids for re-election and died of a stroke in 1874.\n\nRutherford B. Hayes (President #19, 1877--1881)\n\nRutherford B. Hayes is slightly more memorable due to the catchiness of his name, but he's still more than obscure enough to make our list.\n\nRaised by a single mother, Hayes worked his way up in the world from next to nothing, studying at Harvard and practicing law in Cincinnati.\n\nWhen the Civil War erupted, Hayes was 39 and a father of three. Nonetheless, he volunteered to fight and quickly distinguished himself as a valuable leader.\n\nAfter parlaying this fame into a Senate seat and then the governorship of Ohio, he received the Republican presidential nomination in 1876. Until the chad-alicious scandal of 2000, this was perhaps America's most contested election --ending with a special Congressional committee declaring Hayes the winner over Samuel J. Tilden by one electoral vote.\n\nOnce he took office, Hayes got right to work healing a nation still battered by the Civil War. He later claimed to have inherited the country \"divided and distracted\" and left it \"united, harmonious and prosperous.\"\n\nUnfortunately for ol' Rutherford, harmony and prosperity alone won't get your mug on Mount Rushmore.\n\nJohn Tyler (President #10, 1841--1845)\n\nJohn Tyler was up against it from the start. For one thing, he only got to be president because he was the VP under William Henry Harrison, who died of pneumonia following his inauguration speech.\n\nLet's put it this way: When your nicknames include \"His Accidency,\" you're not destined to make a splash.\n\nAfter Harrison's unscheduled departure, Tyler's orchestration of an orderly transfer of power was his only recognized political success. Tyler didn't want to alienate Harrison's supporters, so he retained the departed president's Cabinet. Unfortunately, they had little respect for their new leader. When he once vetoed a bill they favored, all but one of them resigned. That's pretty much how the presidency went for Tyler.\n\nIn fact, his own Whig party tried to have him impeached. Tyler gamely ran for re-election in 1844, but was persuaded to withdraw. Broke, Tyler returned to his Virginia plantation and spent a lot of time supporting the secession of the South. (That didn't work out so well either.) E-mail to a friend\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com\n\nEntire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.
