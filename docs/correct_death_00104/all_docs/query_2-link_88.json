Tilden, was 1 vote short of a majority in the electoral college & received more popular votes than Hayes.\n\nThe commission, after compromise, awarded Hayes 20 disputed electoral votes, giving him the victory.\n\nHe was sworn in on Saturday, March 3, 1877 in the Red Room at the White House.\n\nHayes entered the White House pledging to serve only 1 term & the Republicans obliged by not renominating him in 1880.\n\nMr. Hayes first act as President was to end Reconstruction and restore home rule to the Southern states. He later pushed for civil service reform.\n\nBecause his wife would not permit the serving of alcoholic beverages at White House functions, she became known as “Lemonade Lucy.”\n\n*Rutherford B.

He practiced law in Cincinnati where he met his future wife Lucy. They married in 1852.

Hayes, paid a visit to Knoxville.\n\nThe President stayed at the LAMAR HOUSE on Gay Street & gave a speech to crowd of citizens from the balcony of the hotel.\n\nThe Lamar House had been turned into a hospital during the Civil War & it was there in one of the suites that Union General William P. Sanders died from wounds suffered in battle.\n\nThe Union Fort west of the city was named in his honor.\n\nDuring the 1920s the Lamar House became the Bijou Theater. John Philip Sousa & his band performed there.\n\nIn 1969, the BIJOU was closed but it was renovated & reopened in 2006."
