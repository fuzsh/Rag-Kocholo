        "text": "Three Ohio natives have been vice president, but none lived in Ohio when they were elected. Last time an Ohioan was on a major party ticket was in 1944\n\nOhio famously claims eight American presidents, but the Buckeye State has never had a current resident serve as vice president of the United States.\n\nThat will change if Ohio Sen. JD Vance becomes vice president in 2025. The Middletown native would hold the distinction of being the first Ohio resident and office holder to assume the role after being selected by Republican Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nOhio is the birthplace of three American vice presidents, but none of them lived here when they became vice president. There have been several major party vice presidential candidates from Ohio, but it's been a while.\n\n\"It's been 80 years I think since we've had a vice presidential candidate on the ticket,\" Gov. Mike DeWine said on CNN Monday after the Vance announcement.\n\nJD Vance: VP pick once called Trump 'difficult to stomach.'\n\nHere's a look at some of them:\n\nWho is the last vice president from Ohio?: Charles Dawes, he also composed a #1 hit song\n\nThe last vice president born in Ohio was Charles Dawes, who served under President Calvin Coolidge from 1925-1929.\n\nHe was born in Marietta in 1865 and graduated from Marietta College and Cincinnati Law School. He left Ohio in 1887 and moved west to Nebraska. Prior to becoming vice president, he was the first director of the Bureau of the Budget.\n\nDawes was known for salty language and had the nickname of \"Hell and Maria\" Dawes, according to University of Dayton political science professor Christopher Devine.\n\nDawes won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925 and is the only vice president to compose a hit song.\n\nIn 1912 he wrote a song called \"Melody in a Major,\" that according to a 2011 article in Mental Floss, songwriter Carl Sigman put lyrics to and renamed it \"It's All in the Game.\" The song hit No. 38 on the Billboard charts in 1951 recorded by Tommy Edwards, who then hit No. 1 with a rock n roll version of the song in 1958. The pop standard has since been recorded by Elton John, Nat King Cole, Barry Manilow and others.\n\nCharles Fairbanks ran for vice president twice\n\nCharles Fairbanks was born in Unionville Center, about 25 miles northwest of Columbus, in 1852. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 1872.\n\nFairbanks worked as a news reporter for the Associated Press for a while and actually covered politics. He received his law degree from Cleveland Law School and returned to Ohio Wesleyan to get a master's degree in 1875.\n\nHe moved to Indianapolis and eventually became a U.S. senator in 1897. When President Theodore Roosevelt ran for president in 1904, Republicans chose Fairbanks to join the ticket.\n\nHowever once in office, Fairbanks was at odds with many of Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt decided not to run again in 1908 and backed William Howard Taft.\n\nFairbanks made a run for the Republican nomination in 1908, but was defeated. In the election of 1912, where Roosevelt, Taft and Woodrow Wilson ran against each other, Fairbanks backed Taft instead of his old running mate.\n\nHe made another run for vice president in 1916 running with Charles Evans Hughes. They were defeated by Woodrow Wilson and Thomas Marshall. The race was close. Wilson won 49%-46% The electoral vote was 277-254. Wilson and Marshall did win Ohio.\n\nThomas Hendricks, the first vice president born in Ohio\n\nThomas Hendricks was the first vice president born in Ohio, but he died almost nine months after taking office.\n\nHendricks was born in Fultonham, near Zanesville, in 1819. He left Ohio as a baby when his parents moved to Indiana in 1820.\n\nHe served as a member of Congress, U.S. senator and Indiana governor. He ran for vice president with Democrat Samuel Tilden in the controversial election of 1876. Rutherford B. Hayes, also from Ohio, and William Wheeler won the election. It was the second election in U.S. history where the electoral vote winner did not have a plurality of the popular vote. The electoral vote was 185-184.\n\nIn 1884, Hendricks ran with Democrat Grover Cleveland and won. He served from March 1885 until he died in November 1885 of a heart attack. The vice presidency remained vacant after his death until 1889.\n\nJohn Bricker, the last Ohioan to run for VP on a major-party ticket 80 years ago\n\nThe last time an Ohioan was on a major party ticket was in 1944. In that race, three-term Ohio Gov. John Bricker ran with Republican presidential nominee Thomas Dewey against President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nBack then Ohio governors served two-year terms.\n\nBefore becoming governor in 1939, Bricker served as attorney general. He was also the solicitor in the Columbus suburb of Grandview Heights.\n\nBricker ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1944 for the chance to run against FDR. He came in second in the delegate count to Dewey, but then joined the GOP ticket with Dewey.\n\nDewey and Bricker won Ohio in the presidential election, but FDR, who was running for a fourth term, defeated them in a landslide. FDR won the electoral vote 432-99. Bricker later served in the U.S. Senate from 1947 to 1959.\n\nLike JD Vance, Bricker was also an Ohio State University graduate. Bricker was born in Mount Sterling, 24 miles southwest of Columbus.\n\nMore: Who is JD Vance? Vice presidential candidate has multiple ties to Columbus\n\nBricker was shot at in July 1947 while he was in the subway tunnels to the U.S. Capitol by a former Capitol police officer who had recently lost his job. The attack made the front page of The New York Times on July 13, 1947. The article said Bricker identified the gunman as a \"constituent with a fancied grievance.\" The gunman, William Kaiser, was also an Ohioan from Columbus. The article said Bricker survived the attack because of \"good fortune and the bad marksmanship of his assailant.\"\n\nBricker and others ducked down as the subway car pulled off after the shots were fired. Once in the Capitol, Bricker went to the Senate chamber to vote on a tax bill. He served in the Senate until 1959.\n\nHe founded the Columbus-based law firm of Bricker & Eckler. He died in 1986. He is buried at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus.\n\nFormer Ohio Sen. Allen Thurman runs with Grover Cleveland in 1888\n\nAllen Thurman wasn't born in Ohio, but his family moved from Virginia to Chillicothe when he was a child. He was a lawyer and became a member of Congress in 1844. He then became an Ohio Supreme Court justice, serving for a while as chief justice.\n\nIn 1867, Thurman was the Democratic nominee for governor, but lost to future President Rutherford B. Hayes. It was a close race. Hayes won with 50.3% of the vote to Thurman's 49.6%. The difference in the popular vote was fewer than 4,000 votes.\n\nEric Foner wrote in the book \"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863â€“1877,\" that Thurman ran on a platform that included \"No Negro Equality!\" He was an opponent of Reconstruction.\n\nHe went on to serve in the U.S. Senate from 1869-1881. In 1879, he became president pro tempore making him second in line to the presidency after the vice president. Later in 1947, the position was moved back a spot and the speaker of the House became second in line.\n\nAccording to his official biography with the Ohio Supreme Court, Thurman's name was placed in nomination for president at the Democratic conventions twice, but he didn't get the nomination. In 1888, Thurman was nominated for vice president to join the ticket with President Grover Cleveland.\n\nRepublican Benjamin Harrison won that election, but Cleveland came back in 1892 to defeat Harrison, becoming the only president in history to serve two nonconsecutive terms. However, Thurman was not the VP on the ticket that year.\n\nThurman died in 1895 and is also buried in Columbus' Green Lawn Cemetery.\n\nWhitelaw Reid ran for VP in 1892; Gov. Mike DeWine lives in his home\n\nAmerican diplomat and journalist Whitelaw Reid was born in Cedarville in Greene County in 1837. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford.\n\nHe served as ambassador to France under President Benjamin Harrison from 1889 to 1892, when he joined the GOP ticket with Harrison. They lost to former President Grover Cleveland and Adlai Stevenson. Reid did help Harrison carry Ohio. However, it was actually the first time in history a Republican president didn't win re-election.\n\nReid went on to serve as ambassador to the United Kingdom under Presidents Roosevelt and Taft.\n\nThe Cedarville home that Reid was born in, built in 1823, is the current home of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and first lady Fran DeWine.\n\nGeorge Pendleton, the first Ohioan to run for vice president\n\nIn 1864, Ohio Congressman George Pendleton unsuccessfully ran for vice president with Democrat George McClellan against President Abraham Lincoln. Before being in Congress, he served in the Ohio Senate.\n\nHe was born in 1825 in Cincinnati, where his home is a historic site. His father Nathanael Greene Pendleton was also a congressman. He moved to Cincinnati in 1818 and also served in the Ohio Senate.\n\nHe supported slavery.\n\nMcClellan and Pendleton lost to Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, 55% to 45%. The Democrats only got 21 electoral votes compared to 212 for the Republicans. Pendleton didn't help the ticket win Ohio, which went for Lincoln, 56% to 44%.\n\nPendleton went for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1868 and nearly won. He also made a run for Ohio governor and lost to future President Rutherford B. Hayes.\n\nHe ended his political career serving in the U.S. Senate from 1881-1885. He then served as an envoy to Germany and died in Brussels in 1889. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.\n\nAnother interesting fact about Pendleton is that he was the son-in-law of Francis Scott Key, who wrote the Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nAnthony Shoemaker is the Statehouse Bureau Chief for the USA TODAY Network Ohio."
