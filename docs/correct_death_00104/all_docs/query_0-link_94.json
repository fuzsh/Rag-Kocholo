Mr Denman died on his original location, March 23, 1878, within two days of eighty-seven years of age. Mrs. Denman still loccupies the old homestead, aged sevety-six. They had a family of fifteen children, who lived to mature age, and were married. Twelve are now living.”\n\nRESEARCH NOTES\n\nFrom another researcher:\n\n- John was born or baptised 25/3/1791 - the family was nonconformist, therefore children were not generally baptised, only (sometimes) appearing in parish registers as “born”. (or 27 Mar 1791?)\n\n- 15 children listed: Howard, William, Roxana, Ann, Laura, Charles, Marinda, John, Mary, Henry, Amous, Ambrous, Martin, Levert B, child (no further details)\n\n- Ann Boorman and William Denman were my 4th great grandparents, who moved to the US in 1795 and whose oldest son John is my ancestor. John Denman moved to Ohio as a young adult. His parents and some siblings stayed in the Neversink New York area where they had settled. My mother was a Denman.\n\n- Did John and Mary marry in Florence Ohio or Jessup Ohio? [there is a Jessup in southwestern Ohio, just east of Cincinnati. The digital image of the marriage register says 9/30/1819 [not 14 Oct 1819], but no location listed on the page. It was indexed as Huron County, Ohio with no other placename.]\n\n- Notes from Pedigree Resource File submitter jwhytrock2748705:\n\n“He was 4 years old when he was brought to America by his parents, according to Hazel Booth Joslin. He remained with his parents until he was 19, when his health failed him, (he was afflicted with cancer in his mouth) he left home, & traveled on foot to New Haven CT, in search of medical aide. He then placed himself under the medical care of a cancer doctor; remaining in New Haven, CT for 6 months. He paid for his treatment partly with the the little store of money, which by close economy he had accumulated, & partly by working while under treatment.

His parents were natives of Kent Co., England, and were married in Hadcom, in said county, June 24, 1790.\n\nMartin Denman married Sally Ann Washburn, in Wawarsing, Ulteer Co., N.Y., Jan 20,, 1830. In 1833 he immigrated with his family to this county, and purchased over four hundred acrews of land in the township of Townsend, one hundred and fifty acres of which are still owned by the family. The only improvements on the land originally purhased by him was a clearing of five acres and five acres of slashing.\n\nHis remarkable energy and good judgment, as well as his sterling courage, will appear when it is know that his health was never firm, having inherited a pulmonic trouble; but feeble as was his health, stimulated by the very difficulties to be overcome, in the shape of a frowning forest, and especially the wants of a growing family, he pressed vigorously forward, conquered the forest, and carved therefrom a beautiful home and a handsome competence for his family. His life shows what inducstry, economy, integrity, and determination will accomplish.\n\nHis education was limited to such as the common schools of his native county could furnish. He made a profession of religion in early life, and was a prominent and active member of the Methodist Church until his death.\n\nIn politics he acted with the Republican party, but cast the second Abolition vote ever deposited in this township. So bitter was the feeling against him, on account of this practical application of Christianity, that his neighbors refused to hold his horse - who would not suffer himself to be tied - while he deposited his ballot. He was obliged to find a stable where he could secure his fastidious animal, when, with that courage and determination which characterized his life, he went feearlessly forward in the discharge of duty, and that, too, when men of less courage and less principle would have succumbed to prejudice and popular opinion.\n\nWhat his hands found to do he did with all his might. This quality, as well as his patriotism, was, perhaps, never more apparent than during the late war, when active, clear-headed, large-hearted men were needed to collect hopital supplies and clear the township of draft, and thereby save the few remaining young and able-bodied men to plant for future harvests. Here is real worth was apparent. He was untiring in his devotion to his country, and unflagging in his energies to provide for the wants of those who took their lives in their hands, and went forth to do battle for the maintenance on constitutional liberty and human rights.\n\nOn the 23d da of January, 1872, from an attack of typhoid pneumonia, having, we may truly say, fought his good fight and finished his course, death came to bring the new birth.\n\nWe cannot speak of the end of such a life, when those who knew him best, and were nearest to him in his earth-life, still live in the echoes of that life, making an immortality in whose glory they stand.\n\nMrs. Sally Ann Denman was the tenth and youngest child of James Washburn and Judith Griffin. The family consisted of seven girls and three boys. Of this large family but two are living, the subject of this sketch and one sister Mrs. Golden, now living in New London, Ohio.\n\nHer brother, Joseph Washburn, was one of the erliest settlers of Fitchville township, and is said to have donated the lands for the church buildings of that place.\n\nMrs. Denman’s parents were Quakers, but at quite an early age she united with the Mothodist Church, and has ever since been a member of that body.\n\nToo much can hardly be said for the mother, who, in addition to the task of rearing a family, could courageously meet the trials incident to, and inseparable from, a pioneer life in a new coutry.\n\naving turned her back on the scenes of her childhood, with its pleasant memories and luring charms, with Christian fortitude and unfaltering faith in God, she went hand in hand with him who had promised to love and cherish her, meeting her trials with the calm resignation so befitting a trusting soul. By her aid and goood management, her faithful husband was enabled to see the fruition of his labors in the acquirement of a competence for the support of those who survive him.\n\nTwo daughters and one son were the fruit of this marriage: Julia Ann, married Philip Hawxhurst, May 4, 1854, and settled in Fitchville, this county; she passed to a higher life Sept 11, 1867. Harriet, married Horace S. Brooks, May 5, 1879 and settled in Huntsville, Logan Co., Ohio.\n\n* source is History of Huron County, Ohio: Its Progress and Development, with Biographical Sketches of Prominent Citizens of the County, Volume 1 (google books)\n\n- 1872 Memorial:\n\nMartin Denman\n\nBirth: unknown\n\nDeath: Jan. 23, 1872\n\nAged 65 Years, 9 Months, 7 Days.\n\nSpouse:\n\nSally Ann Denman (____ - 1891)\n\nBurial: Woodlawn Cemetery, Norwalk, Huron County, Ohio, USA\n\nCreated by: Donna Barnes\n\nRecord added: Sep 03, 2011\n\nFind A Grave Memorial# 75902428\n\nRESEARCH NOTES\n\n- 3 children listed with further details: Julia Ann, Harriet, Cyrus"
