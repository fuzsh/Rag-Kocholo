        "text": "The digital collections of the Library of Congress contain a wide variety of material associated with Rutherford B. Hayes. Born in Delaware, Ohio, on October 4, 1822, Hayes began his career as a lawyer and then served in the Civil War. He went on to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives (1865-67) and as governor of Ohio (1868-72 and 1876-77). Hayes was elected the nineteenth President of the United States (1877-81) as a Republican after a bitterly contested election that was decided by a special electoral commission.\n\nThis resource guide compiles links to digital materials related to Hayes such as manuscripts, broadsides, government documents, newspaper articles, sheet music, and images that are available throughout the Library of Congress website. In addition, it provides links to external websites focusing on Hayes and a bibliography containing selected works for both general and younger readers."
