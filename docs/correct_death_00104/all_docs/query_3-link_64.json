        "text": "Profession: 19th US President\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nPolitical Titles: Governor of Ohio\n\nPresidential Term: March 4, 1877 - March 4, 1881\n\nPreceded By: Ulysses S. Grant\n\nSucceeded By: James Garfield\n\nBiography: Prior to becoming the 19th President of the United States (1877–1881), Hayes served as the Governor of Ohio. During the Civil War he fought as a soldier for the Union and earned a reputation for bravery, particularly as he was injured five times in combat.\n\nIn 1876 he assumed the presidency after one of the most controversial and contentious elections in American history. Hayes lost the popular vote but won the most electoral college votes after a ferociously disputed ruling by a Congressional committee. The dispute led to the Compromise of 1877; Democrats in Congress allowed him to become president in return for the withdrawal of federal troops from the Southern states, ending the Reconstruction Era.\n\nAs president for a single term, he oversaw the end of Reconstruction, began the efforts that led to civil service reform, and attempted to reconcile the divisions left over from the Civil War and Reconstruction. His administration reflected his beliefs in meritocratic government, equal treatment without regard to race, and improvement through education.\n\nRutherford had pledged not to run for a second term, and retired to his native Ohio.\n\nBorn: October 4, 1822\n\nBirthplace: Delaware, Ohio, USA\n\nStar Sign: Libra"
