        "text": "William A. Wheeler (born June 30, 1819, Malone, New York, U.S.—died June 4, 1887, Malone) was the 19th vice president of the United States (1877–81) who, with Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes, took office by the decision of an Electoral Commission appointed to rule on contested electoral ballots in the 1876 election.\n\nWheeler was the son of Almon Wheeler, a lawyer, and Eliza Woodworth. He was a successful lawyer and held several positions in New York state government in the 1840s and ’50s before serving as a member of the United States House of Representatives (1861–63). Returned to Congress in 1875, he was appointed to a committee investigating a disputed election in Louisiana and devised the “Wheeler compromise,” by which governmental control of the state was shared between the Democratic and Republican parties."
