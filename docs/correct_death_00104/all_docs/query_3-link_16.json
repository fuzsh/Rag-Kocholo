        "text": "19th President\n\nTerms: 1877-1881\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nFirst Lady: Lucy Ware Webb Hayes\n\nVice President: William Wheeler\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: October 4, 1822, in Delaware, Ohio... Hayes' reputation as a man of integrity proved a welcome relief from Andrew Johnson's contentious and Ulysses Grant's scandal-ridden administrations, although the election that put Hayes in office was one of the most corrupt in history. He ended Reconstruction in the South and established some civil service reforms. Hayes' appointments included Democrats and Southerners -- ex-Confederates. During his presidency, the White House joined the temperance movements in banishing alcohol from the premises. Died: January 17, 1893\n\nThe Era\n\nThomas Edison invents the lightbulb (1877)\n\nGilbert and Sullivan premiere their opera, H.M.S. Pinafore (1878)\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nSoon after his election, Hayes began dismantling the Reconstruction regime imposed on the defeated Southern states (a condition of the back-room dealings that led to his election). Reconstruction had antagonized the South against Northern military occupation, but the absence of Reconstruction allowed the Democratic Party to establish a Southern stronghold -- one that denied civil rights to blacks. Within the government, Hayes established some important reforms. His appointments did not favor party loyalty as much as competence, and he made an executive order that government employees could not be solicited for party campaign funds.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nForeign policy in the Hayes era turned westward toward the Pacific. The president announced an intention to build a U.S.-controlled Central American canal to aid transport to the west coast. Out in California, the Chinese immigrant population grew at a rate that prompted Hayes to negotiate a trade agreement with the Chinese that would regulate immigration to the U.S. In support of East Asian trade, the president established a treaty with Samoa for the use of a port. Hayes' sense of fair play also served him well in ending skirmishes between Mexico and Texas."
