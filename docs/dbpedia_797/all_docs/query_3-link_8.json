I considered this a most flourishing condition of affairs, and thought that it was now time to send for my mother. I had not seen her for nine months, and the long separation began to grieve me. During these nine months I had made a sad discovery, which it was quite as well I should make, namely, that I had not learnt anything at all that I needed to learn, in order to further my progress in the career I wished to take up. But this did not discourage me, for I felt satisfied that I was now, once for all, firmly established in Paris and that I should not starve, thanks to my 125 francs per month; so I redoubled my zeal, and, ceasing to think of the limit of time I had fixed wherein to attain my end, I resolved to use it in applying myself to study.\n\nUnfortunately, after subtracting my office hours, very little time remained to me. I had to be at the Palais-Royal by half-past ten in the morning, and we did not leave until five in the[Pg 2] evening. Moreover, there was a peculiar function connected with the secretary's office, which did not hold with respect to any other office. Either Ernest or I had to return, from eight till ten o'clock in the evening, while the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans lived at Neuilly, in order to attend to what was called the portefeuille; and the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans, being fond of a country life, spent three-quarters of the year at Neuilly. The task was not a difficult one, but it was imperative; it consisted in sending off by courier to the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans the evening papers and his day's letters, and in receiving in return the orders for the next day. This meant a loss of two hours in the evening, and, of course, made it impossible to go to any play except at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre-FranÃ§ais, which adjoined our offices. It is but fair to say that M. Oudard, who had three tickets a day at his disposal for any seat in the theatre, sometimes indulged us with one of them—an act of generosity hardly ever displayed except when poor plays were on. Still, the expression \"poor plays\" must only be understood to mean the days when neither Talma nor Mademoiselle Mars was acting. But, since I wanted to go to the theatre for purposes of study, those days of poor plays were often profitable exhibitions for me. Then, too, I entered into an arrangement with Ernest by which each of us had his week, and, in this way, we secured fifteen free nights per month.\n\nI had made the acquaintance of a young doctor, named Thibaut; he had no practice at that time, although he was not without ability. One cure he brought about made his reputation, and another his fortune. He cured FÃ©lix Deviolaine—the young cousin of whom I have several times spoken and of whom I shall have occasion to speak again—of a chest complaint that had reached the last stages, by means of inducing articular rheumatism, which drew off the inflammation; and by sheer skill he managed to cure the Marquise de Lagrange, whom he accompanied to Italy, of a chronic affection which was considered incurable. When the marquise was restored to perfect health, she was so grateful that she married him, and they both live to-day on their estates near[Pg 3] Gros-Bois. As Thibaut has the control of a fortune of forty to fifty thousand livres income, he no longer practises the craft of medicine except to benefit his flowers and fruits.\n\nBut, at this period, Thibaut, like Adolphe and myself, was penniless; we were both his patients, and, pecuniarily speaking, very bad ones. How came we to be Thibaut's patients? I will explain. In 1823 and 1824 it was all the fashion to suffer from chest complaint; everybody was consumptive, poets especially; it was good form to spit blood after each emotion that was at all inclined to be sensational, and to die before reaching the age of thirty. Of course, Adolphe and I, both young, tall and thin, considered we were fully entitled to this privilege, and many people who knew us agreed we had some right thereto. I have now lost all claim to this distinction, but, to be fair towards Adolphe, he still has his; for now, at forty-six, he is just as tall and as thin as he was then, when he was twenty-one.\n\nThibaut knew everything of which I was ignorant, so he undertook my education, and it was no light task. We spent nearly all our evenings together in a tiny room in the rue du PÃ©lican, which looked out on the passage VÃ©ro-Dodat. I was a hundred yards off the Palais-Royal, so it was the easiest thing imaginable to go from my quarters to make up my packet for the courier. In the morning, I often accompanied Thibaut to the HÃ´pital de la CharitÃ©, where I picked up a little knowledge of physiology and anatomy, although I have never been able to overcome my aversion towards operations and dead bodies. From these visits accrued a certain amount of medical and surgical knowledge, which has often come in very usefully in my novel-writing. As, for example, in Amaury, where I traced the various phases of a lung disease in my heroine, Madeleine, with such accuracy that once I was paid the compliment of a visit from M. Noailles, who came to ask me to stop the run of this novel in the Presse. His daughter and his son-in-law, who were both in the same stage of consumption, had recognised their precise symptoms in Madeleine's illness, and both waited impatiently each morning[Pg 4] for the paper, to know whether M. d'Avrigny's daughter was going to die or not. As M. d'Avrigny's daughter had been condemned to death both by fate and by her author, the feuilleton was interrupted and, to comfort the two poor invalids, I improvised, in manuscript, a conclusion which raised their hopes, but which, alas! did not restore them to health. The feuilleton was not resumed until after their death. The readers of the Presse had noticed the interruption, but were ignorant of its cause. Now they know.\n\nI have said that I went with Thibaut to the HÃ´pital de la CharitÃ© most mornings, from six to seven o'clock. In the evening, we studied physics and chemistry in his room; and it was in his room that I made my first study of the poisons used by Madame de Villefort in Monte-Cristo—a study which I followed and perfected later, with Ruolz.\n\nA good-looking young neighbour named Mademoiselle Walker, who was a milliner, used to join us in our researches. Like la Fontaine's hen, she failed to set Thibaut and me at variance, although she tried all sorts of devices, but happily none was successful, and we all three managed to keep on friendly terms.\n\nI owe much to Thibaut for teaching me method in working, as well as for actual knowledge. I will relate later how Thibaut, whose name is several times quoted in l'Histoire de dix ans, by Louis Blanc, was obliged, by reason of his relationship with the family of MarÃ©chal GÃ©rard, to play a certain part in the Revolution of July.\n\nAt Lassagne's persuasion I branched out in other directions, and began a course of reading. Walter Scott came first. The first novel I read by the \"Scottish Bard,\" as he was then called, was Ivanhoe. Accustomed to the mild plots of Madame Cottin, or to the eccentric pranks of the author of the Barons de Felsheim and of the Enfant du Carnaval, it took me some time to get used to the rude, uncouth ways of Gurth the swineherd, and to the facetious jokes of Wamba, Cedric's jester. But when the author introduced me to the old Saxon's romantic dining-hall; when I had seen the fire[Pg 5] on the hearth, fed by a whole oak tree, with its light sparkling on the monk and on the dress of the unknown pilgrim; when I saw all the members of the family of the thane take their places at the long oak board, from the head of the castle, the king of his territory, to the meanest servitor; when I saw the Jew Isaac in his yellow cap, and his daughter Rebecca in her gold corselet; when the tourney at Ashby had given me a foretaste of the powerful sword-shakes and lance-thrusts that I should again come across in Froissart, oh! then, little by little, the clouds that had veiled my sight began to lift, I saw open out before me more extended horizons than any that had appeared to me when Adolphe de Leuven worked these changes in my provincial imagination that I have already mentioned.\n\nNext followed Cooper, with his big forests, his vast prairies, his boundless oceans, his Pioneers, his Prairie, his Redskins—three masterpieces of description, wherein absence of substance is well concealed beneath wealth of style, so that one goes the whole way through a novel of his, like the apostle, upon ground ever ready to yawn open and swallow one up, and yet, nevertheless, one is upheld, not by faith but by style, from the first page to the last.\n\nThen came Byron—Byron, lyric and dramatic poet, who died at Missolonghi just when I was beginning to study him in Paris. There had been a tremendous rage over Lord Byron for some time; the glory of the poet had derived fresh glamour from the Greek camp bivouacs; his name would henceforth be associated with those of the famous Greeks of old; not only would Byron be spoken of as akin to Sir Walter Scott and Chateaubriand, but in the same breath as the names of Mavrocordato, Odysseus and Canaris.\n\nOne day, before the world even knew that the famous poet was ill, we read in the papers as follows:—\n\n\"MISSOLONGHI, 20 April\n\n\"Our town presents a most touching spectacle; we have all gone into mourning, for our illustrious benefactor died at six o'clock yesterday evening, the 19th instant.\"\n\n[Pg 6]\n\nByron had died at the age of thirty-seven, like Raphael; he had died during the Easter celebrations, and thirty-seven volleys were fired—one for each year of his life—in every town, spreading the news of his death from Thrace to the PirÃ¦us, and from Epeirus to the Asiatic coasts.\n\nCourts of justice, public offices and shops were closed for three days; for three days dancing, public amusements and the sound of musical instruments were forbidden; and the public mourning lasted for three weeks.\n\nPoor Byron! he only desired to fight and to help to win a victory, or, if conquered, to die arms in hand. As a general, it would have given him great joy to lead the Souliotes at the siege of Lepanto; Lepanto, the land of Don Juan and of Charles the Fifth, seemed to him a fitting name with which to link his own; it was a noble land to bleed for and to die in.\n\nBut he was not to realise that happiness; he died at Missolonghi, and it was he who made an unknown land famous, instead of himself receiving lustre from a sacred land; people say, \"Byron died at Missolonghi,\" not \"Missolonghi, the place where Byron died.\"\n\nThe great man had no notion that, in dying for the Greeks, he was only dying so that Europe, as the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans once expressed it to me, might have the pleasure of eating sauerkraut at the foot of the Parthenon!\n\nPoor immortal bard, who died in the hope that the news of his death would resound through all hearts! what would he have said if he could have heard, as I rushed in, the newspaper containing the fatal notice in my hand, crying despairingly, \"Byron is dead,\" one of the assistants in our office ask, \"Who was Byron?\" Such a question caused me both pain and pleasure mixed; I had, then, found someone even more ignorant than myself, and he one of the chief clerks in the office. Had it been only an ordinary copying clerk I should not have felt so consoled.\n\nThis unlooked for death of one of the greatest poets of the time made a deep impression upon me; I felt instinctively[Pg 7] that Byron was more than a poet, that he was one of those leaders whose inspired utterances, in the silence of the night and in the obscurity in which art lives, are heard throughout all nations, whose shining rays lighten the whole world. Such men are usually not only prophets but also martyrs. They create from out their own sufferings the divine thoughts which act as incentives to others; it is at the spectacle of their own tortures that they utter cries which clutch the heart. Had Prometheus or Napoleon been poets, think what verses each would have engraved on his rock of doom!\n\nWe will try, then, to give an account of the sufferings of this man, who was driven from his own country as though he were a Barabbas, to die for the Greeks as Christ did for the Jews.\n\nDeath must be passed through before there can be transfiguration.\n\n[Pg 8]\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nByron's childhood—His grief at being lame—Mary Duff—The Malvern fortune-teller—How Byron and Robert Peel became acquainted—Miss Parker—Miss Chaworth—Verses on her portrait—Mrs. Musters—Lady Morgan—English Bards and Scotch Reviewers—Byron's letters to his mother—He takes his seat in the House of Lords\n\nByron was born on 22 January 1788, of so ancient and noble a family that it could take rank with many royal families. At his birth, the child who was predestined to become so famous had his foot dislocated and no one noticed the fact. This accident made him lame, and we shall see what an influence this infirmity had upon his life.\n\nFour celebrated men belonging to the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries were lame: MarÃ©chal Soult, M. de Talleyrand, Walter Scott and Lord Byron. A woman writer has said that \"Byron would have given half his fame if he could but have been as proud of his feet as he was of his hands.\" We are assured that Juno's bird, the peacock, forgot his rich plumage and uttered a cry of distress every time he looked down at his feet. And Byron, king of poets, who had a good deal of the peacock about him, was not more philosophical than that king of birds.\n\n\"What a beautiful child!\" some lady once remarked, when Byron was three years old and she saw him, whip in hand, playing at his nurse's knee; \"but what a pity he is crippled!\"\n\nThe child turned round, lifted up his whip and lashed the woman with all his might. \"Dinna say that!\" he said.\n\nHis mother, strange to say, never understood how proud the child was. Byron was misunderstood by the two beings who,[Pg 9] when they understand a man, can shed most happiness upon his life—his mother and his wife. Byron's mother, as we have said, never realised the child's pride, and used to call him \"my lame boy.\"\n\nIf you would learn what this flaw in maternal love cost the lad, read what Arnold says in the first scene of The Deformed Transformed:—\n\n\"A Forest\n\nEnter ARNOLD and his mother BERTHA\n\nBert.\n\nOut, hunchback!\n\nArn.\n\nI was born so, mother!\n\nBert.\n\nOut,\n\nThou incubus! Thou nightmare! Of seven sons,\n\nThe sole abortion!\n\nArn.\n\nWould that I had been so,\n\nAnd never seen the light!\n\nBert.\n\nI would so too!\n\nBut as thou hast—hence, hence—and do thy best!\n\nThat back of thine may bear its burthen; 'tis\n\nMore high, if not so broad as that of others.\n\nArn.\n\nIt bears its burthen:—but, my heart! Will it\n\nSustain that which you lay upon it, mother?\n\nI love, or, at the least, I loved you: nothing\n\nSave you, in nature, can love aught like me.\n\nYou nursed me—do not kill me!\"\n\nAt the age of five Byron was sent to school in Aberdeen, where they paid but five shillings a quarter for him. I had thought no child had ever been educated more cheaply than I had; but I was mistaken, and I present my congratulations to Byron as a brother at least in poverty.\n\nAlthough the future poet spent a whole year in this school, one of his biographers tells us he hardly managed to learn his letters. I had this further advantage over Byron that my mother taught me to read: God gave me at least half of what Byron was denied—a good mother.\n\nFrom the school at Aberdeen, Byron passed to the university of the same town. Alas! he was one of the worst scholars, and was always at the bottom of his class. Many of[Pg 10] his schoolfellows can tell stories of the jokes which his masters made at his expense.\n\nIn 1798 the old Lord Byron died. He had been a rouÃ© of quality, who had had any number of love affairs and duels. He killed his friend Chaworth in one of his duels—an event which was to have its influence upon his son's life too.\n\nTwo years before, young Byron had paid a visit to the Scotch Highlands, from whence he derived that love of high peaks, shared by eagles and poets, which made him later sing the praises of the Alps, the Apennines and Parnassus.\n\nIt was during this tour our Dante met his Beatrice; her name was Mary Duff, and she was only eight years old.\n\nThe old Lord Byron died at Newstead Abbey, and Byron was his heir. He left Aberdeen with his mother. They sold their furniture for seventy-five pounds sterling—another point of similarity between us (I hope I may be pardoned my comparisons, I shall not have much pride in pressing them further)—and they reached Newstead. There they put the young man under the care of a quack doctor called Lavemde to try and cure his foot, for this infirmity occupied the greatest portion of his thoughts. As it was seen that the young lord's lameness was neither better nor worse for this charlatan's treatment, he was sent to London, where he was entrusted for his physical requirements to Dr. Baillie, and for his moral equipment to Dr. Glennie. There, both doctors had a certain measure of success, for Dr. Glennie had the satisfaction, after having put him on the way, of beholding his pupil surpass all his contemporaries, in letters and poetry.\n\nDr. Baillie managed to cure his foot sufficiently to enable him to wear an ordinary boot, so that his lameness did not seem more than a slight limp. Great was the proud youth's joy, and he communicated it to his nurse, whom he greatly loved.\n\nIn 1801, when he was thirteen, Byron followed his mother to Cheltenham, where the view of the Malvern Hills, recalling his first visit to the Highlands, made a deep impression upon him, especially as he saw them in the early morning and[Pg 11] evening. When he and his mother were out riding together they learnt from the country people of a celebrated sorceress of those parts, and Lady Byron took a fancy to consult her. She said nothing of the lad, and introduced herself to the witch as an unmarried woman. But the sorceress shook her head.\n\n\"You are not a maid,\" she said; \"you have been a wife and are now a widow; you have a son who will be in danger of being poisoned before he has attained his majority; he will marry twice, and the second time it will be with a foreigner.\"\n\nWe shall see directly that, if he was not exactly poisoned, he was in fear of being so, and it is well known that, if he did not marry a second time, at all events he found a beautiful Venetian lady of rank who made up to him for his first marriage, save in the recollection of its unhappiness.\n\nFrom Dr. Glennie's tutelage, Byron proceeded to Harrow. Dr. Drury was then headmaster, and he was the first to detect some few faint glimpses of what the poet would one day become.\n\n\"Here I made my first verses,\" said Byron, \"they were received but coldly; but, in revenge, I fought glorious battles at Harrow: I only lost one fight out of every seven!\"\n\nIt was at Harrow that he made the acquaintance of Sir Robert Peel, and the way in which they became fast friends gives some idea of the character of Byron.\n\nOne of their comrades, taller and stronger than they, with whom consequently they had no dealings, was discovered by Byron thrashing poor Peel.\n\nByron came up and said—\n\n\"How many more blows do you mean to give Robert?\"\n\n\"What business is it of yours?\" retorted the combatant. \"Why do you ask such a question?\"\n\n\"Because, if you please, executioner, I will take half the blows you intend for him and will return them to you later, you understand, when I am bigger.\"\n\nAfter Harrow, the young man went to finish his education at the University of Cambridge; but he was ever impatient of[Pg 12] regular study, just as he was of ordinary modes of enjoyment: the only thing he learnt was how to swim; his only recreation was the training of a bear.\n\nIn 1806, when he was eighteen, he joined his mother at Newstead. The relations between mother and son were not at all of a tender nature; on the contrary, the two were nearly always quarrelling. One of these quarrels even went so far one day that each in turn called at a chemist's, within five minutes of one another, to inquire if he had sold the other poison, and, on being told not, begged him not to do so. Besides little Mary Duff, with whom he fell in love when he was nine, Byron conceived a passion when he was twelve for his cousin, Miss Parker, for whom he composed his first verses. They were lost, and the poet never remembered what they were. Miss Parker died, and gave place to Miss Chaworth, the daughter of the man whom old Lord Byron had killed. But this time it was the real passion of budding manhood, tender and deep, and it left its mark for the rest of his life. Miss Chaworth was beautiful, charming in manner and wealthy.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Byron, \"our union would have wiped out the recollection of the blood shed between our fathers; it would have reunited two rich estates and two beings who would have agreed well enough together, and then—and then—Ah, well, God knows what might have happened!\"\n\nBut Byron was lame; he was obliged to avoid all kinds of exercise that could expose his deformity, and consequently dancing. Now Miss Chaworth was particularly fond of dancing, and Byron would stand, leaning against a corner by the door or against the chimneypiece, his arms crossed, frowning, with his lips curled with anger, whilst the music carried far away from him the girl he loved, some dancer more lucky than he leading her through the figures of a quadrille or guiding her in the whirl of a valse. Once, someone said to Mary Chaworth—\n\n\"Do you know that Byron seems deeply in love with you?\"\n\n\"Well, what does it matter to me?\" replied Mary.\n\n[Pg 13]\n\n\"What! do you mean what you say?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. Do you really think I could care for that lame boy?\"\n\nByron heard both questions and answers, and he said it was as though a dagger had struck him to the heart. These words were uttered at midnight; but he rushed out of the house like a madman and ran without stopping to Newstead, where, on arrival, he fell nearly fainting from exhaustion.\n\nAnd yet, the disdainful Miss Chaworth having one day sent her portrait to him, Byron, in exchange, sent her the following verses:—\n\nTO MARY\n\nON RECEIVING HER PICTURE\n\n\"This faint resemblance of thy charms,\n\nThough strong as mortal art could give,\n\nMy constant heart of fear disarms,\n\nRevives my hopes, and bids me live.\n\nHere I can trace the locks of gold\n\nWhich round thy snowy forehead wave,\n\nThe cheeks which sprung from beauty's mould,\n\nThe lips which made me beauty's slave.\n\nHere I can trace—ah, no! that eye,\n\nWhose azure floats in liquid fire,\n\nMust all the painter's art defy,\n\nAnd bid him from the task retire.\n\nHere I behold its beauteous hue;\n\nBut where's the beam so sweetly straying,\n\nWhich gave a lustre to its blue,\n\nLike Luna o'er the ocean playing?\n\nSweet copy! far more dear to me,\n\nLifeless, unfeeling as thou art,\n\nThan all the living forms could be,\n\nSave her who placed thee next my heart.\n\nShe placed it, sad, with needless fear,\n\nLest time might shake my wavering soul,\n\nUnconscious that her image there\n\n[Pg 14]Held every sense in fast control.\n\nThrough hours, through years, through time, 'twill cheer;\n\nMy hope, in gloomy moments, raise;\n\nIn life's last conflict 'twill appear,\n\nAnd meet my fond expiring gaze.\"\n\nA year later, Miss Chaworth married.\n\n\"Pull out your handkerchief, my son,\" Lady Byron said to the lad, one day on returning home.\n\n\"What for, mother?\"\n\n\"Because I have bad news for you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Miss Chaworth is married.\"\n\nByron drew his handkerchief out of his pocket and blew his nose, and with that expression of sarcasm which he knew so well how to assume at certain times, he said—\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Isn't it enough?\" asked Lady Byron, who knew well enough the real pain he was concealing beneath that apparent indifference.\n\n\"Enough to make me shed tears? No indeed!\" and Byron put his handkerchief back into his pocket.\n\nWhen Lady Byron had announced to her son in this callous, mocking way his adored Mary's marriage, and Byron had put on a smiling appearance of indifference to the news, returning his handkerchief to his pocket unwet by a tear, the poor youth went to his own room heart-broken, and, taking up in his hand the portrait of his unfaithful sweetheart, the poet tried to comfort the lover, inviting himself to mourn, lashing his passion into words.\n\nHence resulted those mournful sighings of a broken heart addressed to Mrs. Musters:—\n\nTO A LADY\n\n\"Oh! had my fate been join'd with thine,\n\nAs once this pledge appear'd a token,\n\nThese follies had not then been mine,\n\n[Pg 15]For then my peace had not been broken.\n\nTo thee these early faults I owe,\n\nTo thee, the wise and old reproving:\n\nThey know my sins, but do not know\n\n'Twas thine to break the bonds of loving.\n\nFor once my soul, like thine, was pure,\n\nAnd all its rising fires could smother;\n\nBut now thy vows no more endure,\n\nBestow'd by thee upon another.\n\nPerhaps his peace I could destroy,\n\nAnd spoil the blisses that await him\n\nYet let my rival smile in joy,\n\nFor thy dear sake I cannot hate him.\n\nAh! since thy angel form is gone,\n\nMy heart no more can rest with any;\n\nBut what it sought in thee alone,\n\nAttempts, alas! to find in many.\n\nThen fare thee well, deceitful maid!\n\n'Twere vain and fruitless to regret thee;\n\nNor hope, nor memory yield their aid,\n\nBut pride may teach me to forget thee.\n\nYet all this giddy waste of years,\n\nThis tiresome round of palling pleasures;\n\nThese varied loves, these matron's fears,\n\nThese thoughtless strains to passion's measures—\n\nIf thou wert mine, had all been hush'd:—\n\nThis cheek, now pale from early riot,\n\nWith passion's hectic ne'er had flush'd,\n\nBut bloom'd in calm domestic quiet.\n\nYes, once the rural scene was sweet,\n\nFor Nature seem'd to smile before thee;\n\nAnd once my breast abhorr'd deceit,—\n\nFor then it beat but to adore thee.\n\nBut now I seek for other joys:\n\nTo think would drive my soul to madness;\n\nIn thoughtless throngs and empty noise\n\n[Pg 16]I conquer half my bosom's sadness.\n\nYet, even in these a thought will steal\n\nIn spite of every vain endeavour,—\n\nAnd friends might pity what I feel,—\n\nTo know that thou art lost for ever.\"\n\nAlas! Miss Chaworth was not, as Mrs. Musters, to be happier in her marriage than the man she had forsaken. She married John Musters, Esq., in the August of 1805, and lived miserably until 1832, when she died in as melancholy a way as she had lived. A band of insurgents from Nottingham came and set fire to Colwick Hall, where she lived. She and her daughter took refuge in a potting-shed, and, being already in poor health, she took cold and fell ill, and died practically of the same complaint that Byron had died of eight years before.\n\nAs Byron says in the second verse of his poem to Mrs. Musters, it was in consequence of the rupture of his friendship with Miss Chaworth that he flung himself exclusively into the pursuit of pleasure. He flirted, rode, gambled, kept dogs, took up swimming, fencing and pistol-shooting.\n\nBut he found time to write a book called Hours of Idleness in the midst of all these revels and athletic exercises. He had just published this book when Lady Morgan, with whom I was to become acquainted thirty years afterwards, met him for the first time.\n\nThis is her description of the meeting:—\n\n\"Suddenly my dazzled looks were arrested by an exceedingly beautiful young man. His expression was taciturn, and yet there seemed as much shyness as scorn in it. He was alone, and stood in a corner near a door, with his arms folded across his breast, and one felt that although he was in the middle of an animated and brilliant crowd, yet he did not belong to it.\n\n\"'How do you do, Lord Byron?' a pretty young creature, dressed in the height of the fashion, asked him.\n\n\"Lord Byron! At that word all the brave Byrons that had belonged to English and French chivalry rose before my mind; but I did not know that the handsome youth who was their descendant was destined to give an even greater right to the[Pg 17] name for the admiration of posterity than the most valiant knight of France, or than the most loyal cavalier of England who had ever borne the same name. Fame spread very slowly in our province of Tirerag; and although Lord Byron had already taken the first step in that career which was to end in the triumphant acknowledgment of his wonderful genius, and the injustice and ingratitude of his fellow-countrymen, I knew nothing of this future fame then, when I heard the name of Byron, save what prompted me to say to myself, the 'Go, hang thyself, Byron,' of Henry IV.\"\n\nPoor Lady Morgan! she was not happy in her historical quotations! but what matters it? she did not look too closely into them. It was Biron without the y whose head Henry cut off; and it was of Crillon that he wrote, \"Go, hang thyself!\"\n\nBut the literary fame Byron lacked was soon to be given him by the critics. The Edinburgh Review, in an article written by Mr. Brougham, who afterwards became Lord Brougham, attacked the young poet violently.\n\nLord Byron's life was destined to be one continuous fight. Born lame, he persevered until he became the finest swimmer, the best shot and the most dauntless horse-rider of his time. The world denied his genius, so he made up his mind he would become the first poet of his age.\n\nHis response to the article in the Edinburgh Review was that terrible satire hurled at his critics under the title of English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, at the head of which appeared these two epigrams from Shakespeare and Pope:—\n\n\"I had rather be a kitten, and cry mew!\n\nThan one of these same metre ballad-mongers!\"—Shakespeare.\n\n\"Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true,\n\nThere are as mad, abandon'd critics too.\"—Pope.\n\nWhen Byron had hurled this lance, he could not draw back. He had pledged himself heart and soul to poetry, he had taken upon him the mantle of Nessus which was to consume him but also to immortalise him. And yet he hesitated for[Pg 18] a brief period. By birth he had a right to sit in the House of Lords, and he decided he would take his seat there. If his aristocratic peers received him cordially, who knew what might happen? He might give up everything, even the idea of his journey to Persia with his friend Hobhouse, to follow his schoolfellow Robert Peel in a political career. It should all depend on a smile or a hand-shake; and for such an acknowledgment he would fling away the pen that had written the Hours of Idleness and English Bards and Scotch Reviewers; for a smile and a hand-shake he would bid farewell to games, betting, races, drunkenness, and break himself off from those youthful follies in which he had tried to drown the memory of Miss Chaworth; he would leave them all, even the woman who had followed him to Brighton dressed as a man, whose scandalous presence had roused the indignation of the prudish English aristocracy!\n\nIt was at this crisis he wrote to his mother the following letter, which shows what a degree of coldness existed between mother and son:—\n\n\"TO THE HONOURABLE LADY BYRON\n\n\"NEWSTEAD ABBEY, NOTTS\n\nOctober 7, 1808\n\n\"DEAR MADAM,—I have no beds for the Hansons or anybody else at present. The Hansons sleep at Mansfield. I do not know that I resemble Jean Jacques Rousseau. I have no ambition to be like so illustrious a madman—but this I know, that I shall live in my own manner, and as much alone as possible. When my rooms are ready I shall be glad to see you: at present it would be improper and uncomfortable to both parties. You can hardly object to my rendering my mansion habitable, notwithstanding my departure for Persia in March (or May at farthest), since you will be tenant till my return; and in case of any accident (for I have already arranged my will to be drawn up the moment I am twenty-one), I have taken care you shall have the house and manor for life, besides a sufficient income. So you see my improvements are not entirely selfish.—Adieu. Believe me, yours very truly,\n\nBYRON\"\n\n[Pg 19]\n\nIn another letter to his mother, dated 6 March 1809, he adds:—\n\n\"What you say is all very true: come what may, Newstead and I stand or fall together. I have now lived on the spot, I have fixed my heart upon it, and no pressure, present or future, shall induce me to barter the last vestige of our inheritance. I have that pride within me which will enable me to support difficulties. I can endure privations; but could I obtain in exchange for Newstead Abbey the first fortune in the country, I would reject the proposition. Set your mind at ease on that score; Mr. Hanson talks like a man of business on the subject,—I feel like a man of honour, and I will not sell Newstead. I shall get my seat on the return of the affidavits from Carhais, in Cornwall, and will do something in the House soon: I must dash, or it is all over. My Satire must be kept secret for a month; after that you may say what you like on the subject. Lord Carlisle has used me infamously, and refused to state any particulars of my family to the Chancellor. I have lashed him in my rhymes, and perhaps his lordship may regret not being more conciliatory. They tell me it will have a sale; I hope so, for the bookseller has behaved well, as far as publishing well goes.—Believe me, etc.,\n\nBYRON\n\n\"P.S.—You shall have a mortgage on one of the farms.\"\n\nBut Byron was doomed in advance. He had the greatest difficulty in obtaining the papers necessary to establish his title to the peerage, and, three days after writing the above letter—that is to say, on 9 March 1809, six weeks after having attained his majority—he presented himself in the House of Lords.\n\nAs we have said, upon this test his whole career was to depend. As he told his mother, his Satire was to be kept a secret for a month longer, and if he were well received by his illustrious colleagues, it was to remain unpublished and the poet unknown.\n\nIt was the will of Providence that these aristocrats should be unjust towards this young man, this boy, nay, more than unjust, cruel.\n\n[Pg 20]\n\nHe entered the House alone, and looked calm, although his face was deadly pale; not one kindly glance encouraged him, not a single hand was held out towards his; he searched in vain for a single friendly look throughout that illustrious assembly, but all heads were turned away.\n\nHe then made up his mind. He, Lord Byron, would make a fresh claim to nobility for his posterity, since his present title to it was slighted by his contemporaries. He published his Satire, and set out, with Mr. Hobhouse, in the June of that same year 1809.\n\n[Pg 21]\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nByron at Lisbon—How he quarrelled with his own countrymen—His poem Childe Harold—His fits of mad folly and subsequent depression—His marriage—His conjugal squabbles—He again quits England—His farewell to wife and child—His life and amours at Venice—He sets out for Greece—His arrival at Missolonghi—His illness and death\n\nThe first news received from the poet-traveller was from Lisbon, and it bore the mark of that gloomy spirit of mockery which, when fully developed, becomes genius.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Mr. Hodgson, and began in the following strain:—\n\n\"I am very happy here, because I loves oranges, and talk bad Latin to the monks, who understand it, as it is like their own,—and I goes into society (with my pocket-pistols), and I swims in the Tagus all across at once, and I rides on an ass or a mule, and swears Portugese, and have got a diarrhÅa and bites from the mosquitoes. But what of that? Comfort must not be expected by folks that go a pleasuring.\"\n\nAnd yet, while he was mocking in this fashion, he could write such mournful lines as these in Childe Harold:—\n\nCANTO I\n\nIX\n\n\"And none did love him: though to hall and bower\n\nHe gather'd revellers from far and near,\n\nHe knew them flatt'rers of the festal hour;\n\nThe heartless parasites of present cheer.\n\nYea! none did love him—not his lemans dear—\n\nBut pomp and power alone are woman's care,\n\nAnd where these are light Eros finds a feere;\n\nMaidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,\n\nAnd Mammon wins his way where Seraphs might despair.\n\n[Pg 22] X\n\nChilde Harold had a mother—not forgot,\n\nThough parting from that mother he did shun;\n\nA sister whom he loved, but saw her not\n\nBefore his weary pilgrimage begun:\n\nIf friends he had, he bade adieu to none.\n\nYet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel:\n\nYe, who have known what 'tis to dote upon\n\nA few dear objects, will in sadness feel\n\nSuch partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.\n\nXI\n\nHis house, his home, his heritage, his lands,\n\nThe laughing dames in whom he did delight,\n\nWhose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,\n\nMight shake the saintship of an anchorite,\n\nAnd long had fed his youthful appetite;\n\nHis goblets brimm'd with every costly wine,\n\nAnd all that mote to luxury invite,\n\nWithout a sigh he left, to cross the brine,\n\nAnd traverse Paynim shores, and pass Earth's central line.\"\n\nAnd it was in this spirit that he left England to begin his early travels; and if, perchance, any member of the aristocracy inquired who this young Lord Byron was who had inscribed his name on the list of peers, those who were best informed would reply—\n\n\"He is a young rake, grand-nephew of the old Byron who killed Chaworth in a duel; he possesses an old tumbledown Abbey; and a fortune that has been cut up and squandered. When he was at college, where he never did any good, he kept a bear; since he left college he has associated with prostitutes and swindlers, drinking till tipsy out of a human skull, and, when drunk, writing poetry.\"\n\nByron left his country at war with his fellow-men, and one stanza of the first canto of the poem just referred to was enough to set him at loggerheads with women too—a much more serious matter:—\n\n[Pg 23]\n\nCANTO I\n\nLVIII\n\n\"The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impress'd\n\nDenotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:\n\nHer lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,\n\nBid man be valiant ere he merit such:\n\nHer glance how wildly beautiful! how much\n\nHath PhÅbus woo'd in vain to spoil her cheek,\n\nWhich glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!\n\nWho round the North for paler dames would seek?\n\nHow poor their forms appear! how languid, wan and weak!\"\n\nSuch an anathema as this, hurled by the poet at that England which Shakespeare compared to a swan's nest in the midst of a great lake, met with widespread notoriety; for Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, the first canto of which Byron wrote during his travels, had a tremendous reception.\n\nByron visited Portugal, the South of Spain, Sardinia and Sicily; then he went through Albania and Illyria, travelled through the Morea, stopping at Thebes, Athens, Delphi and Constantinople. If we are to believe his own words, he looked forward with dread to his return:—\n\n\"Indeed, my prospects are not very pleasant. Embarrassed in my private affairs, indifferent to public, solitary without the wish to be social, with a body a little enfeebled by a succession of fevers, but a spirit, I trust, yet unbroken, I am returning home without a hope, and almost without a desire. The first thing I shall have to encounter will be a lawyer, the next a creditor, then colliers, farmers, surveyors, and all the agreeable attachments to estates out of repair, and contested coal-pits. In short, I am sick and sorry, and when I have a little repaired my irreparable affairs, away I shall march, either to campaign in Spain, or back again to the East, where I can at least have cloudless skies and a cessation from impertinence.\"\n\nThe writer of the above was barely twenty-four years of age, he bore one of the oldest names in the British Isles, he was a peer of England and was to become the leading poet of his time!\n\nThe first canto of Childe Harold was to reveal him in the latter capacity, and he sold his poem for two hundred pounds sterling.\n\n[Pg 24]\n\nHis mother died suddenly in Scotland two months after his return, in 1811.\n\n\"One day,\" said Lord Byron, \"I heard she was ill; the next, I learnt that she was dead!\"\n\nNor was this all. Almost at the same time his two best friends, Wingfield and Matthews, both died.\n\nByron wrote to Mr. Davies:—\n\n\"Some curse hangs over me and mine. My mother lies a corpse in this house; one of my best friends is drowned in a ditch. What can I say, or think, or do? Come to me. I am almost desolate—left almost alone in the world.\"\n\nWe find traces of these sorrows at the close of the second canto of Childe Harold:—\n\n\"All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death! thou hast;\n\nThe parent, friend, and now the more than friend;\n\nNe'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,\n\nAnd grief with grief continuing still to blend,\n\nHath snatch'd the little joy that life had yet to lend.\n\nWhat is the worst of woes that wait on age?\n\nWhat stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?\n\nTo view each loved one blotted from life's page,\n\nAnd be alone on earth, as I am now.\n\nBefore the Chastener humbly let me bow,\n\nO'er hearts divided and o'er hopes destroyed:\n\nRoll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,\n\nSince Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoy'd,\n\nAnd with the ills of Eld mine earlier years alloy'd.\"\n\nByron rejoiced greatly in the success that had greeted the first canto of his Childe Harold; the second was composed after his return to England, as the stanza upon his mother's death proves.\n\nEven the Edinburgh Review made amends for its mistake in denying that the author of Hours of Idleness had a vocation for poetry.\n\n\"Lord Byron,\" the Scottish critics now remarked, \"has improved much since we last had his work under review. This new volume is full of originality and talent; the author herein[Pg 25] makes amends for the literary sins of his youth, and does more, for he promises to give us better work still.\"\n\nLord Byron received Â£600 for the first two cantos of Childe Harold, and so great was its success that, for the third part, he was paid Â£1575, and for the fourth Â£2100. It was said then, and with some truth, that he sold his poems at the rate of a guinea a line.\n\nWith success came popularity. All the world wanted to see this poet who had appeared suddenly among them like a brilliant meteor, lighting up the darkness of the night, and to buy his works. They beheld his face and saw that he was beautiful; they uttered his name and remembered that, by his father, he came of an illustrious race, and, by his mother, being descended from Jane Stuart, daughter of James II. of Scotland, he had royal blood in his veins. He had said in his poem that he had seen everything worth seeing and was bored with it all, that he had committed all kinds of sins and even crimes; he had said—a most extraordinary confession for a poet of only twenty-five years of age—that he could not fall in love with even the most beautiful of women London had to show. Those pale and languid flowers of the Norths, as he called them, vowed, in their turn, to make him break his oath.\n\nIt was not a difficult matter for those who knew Lord Byron; many succeeded without much effort; Lady Caroline Lamb succeeded best of all. She was the daughter of the Earl of Bamborough, and had married, in 1805, William Lamb, second son of Lord Melbourne.\n\nByron fell madly in love with her, and offered to run away with her; but she declined. What was the cause of the bitter rupture between them that ended in Lady Lamb writing the novel called Glenarvon against her former lover, and in his treating her with great disdain throughout the remainder of his life? We should probably have found an answer to these questions in the Memoirs of Lord Byron that Thomas Moore burnt. Who knows? perhaps he burnt them on account of that episode. After this quarrel, Byron earned a reputation for being a dandy; he became the fashionable frequenter of[Pg 26] watering-places and of aristocratic assemblies. But this kind of life ended as it was sure to do, in weariness and in disgust; and on 27 February 1814 the poet wrote:—\n\n\"Here I am, alone, instead of dining at Lord H.'s, where I was asked,—but not inclined to go anywhere. Hobhouse says I am growing a loup garou,—a solitary hobgoblin. True:—'I am myself alone.'\"\n\nA strange idea next took hold of the misanthrope, of the poet whose inspirations had run dry, of the man of many dissipations: he would marry and settle down. He had exhausted every pleasure youth could give; he aspired to something fresh, no matter even if it meant misery. This unknown and painful experience Lady Byron had in store for him. But the strangest thing was that he wished to marry for the sake of getting married, and not for the sake of the woman. He, who had once betted fifty pounds with Mr. Hay that he would never marry, was in such a hurry to marry that he did not mind who the lady was.\n\nHe discussed his intention with Lady Melbourne, and Lady Melbourne proposed a young lady whom Byron did not know; Byron suggested Miss Milbanke.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" said Lady Melbourne, \"and for two reasons: first, because you have need of money and Miss Milbanke could only bring you ten thousand pounds; and in the second place, because you want a wife who will admire you, and Miss Milbanke admires no one but herself.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Lord Byron, \"what is the name of your young lady?\"\n\nLady Melbourne mentioned her name, and Byron at once wrote to her parents, who sent him a refusal.\n\n\"Good!\" said Byron. \"You now see that Miss Milbanke is to be my wife.\" And he sat down at once and wrote to Miss Milbanke to make known his wishes to her.\n\nBut Lady Melbourne did not mean matters to end thus; she snatched the letter out of Byron's hands when he had finished it and took it to the window to read, while Byron[Pg 27] remained quietly in his seat. When she had read it, she said, \"Well, I must admit this is a very pretty letter; it is a pity it should not go.\"\n\n\"Then give it me,\" said Byron, \"and I will seal it and send it off.\"\n\nLady Melbourne gave the letter back to Byron, and he sealed it and saw that it reached its address.\n\nHe was married on 2 January 1815, from Sir Ralph Milbanke's house. He sent the fifty pounds to Mr. Hay the same day, without waiting till he was asked for the money.\n\nExactly a month later, he wrote:—\n\n\"Feb. 2, 1815\n\n\"The treacle-moon is over, and I am awake, and find myself married. Swift says, 'No wise man ever married'; but, for a fool, I think it is the most ambrosial of all possible future states.\"\n\nThe honeymoon was spent at Sir Ralph Milbanke's house; after that, the young couple went to their house in Piccadilly. But here the worries of housekeeping overtook them. Miss Milbanke's Â£10,000 dowry had only served to irritate Lord Byron's creditors. Creditors only rest quietly whilst nothing at all is given them, for then they are in despair; but partial payment rouses them to fury. Urged on by the Â£10,000 they had secured, the duns did not give the young couple a moment's peace; in proportion as these annoyances increased, the relations between the husband and wife grew colder and more distant. Then, when her husband was at his unhappiest, and only saved from imprisonment through being a peer of the realm, Lady Byron left London under cover of a visit to her father. Their farewell parting was, conventionally speaking, quite affectionate, and they agreed to meet in a month's time. During her journey, Lady Byron wrote quite a tender letter to her husband; then, one morning, Lord Byron learnt from his father-in-law, Sir Ralph Milbanke, that he must not expect ever to see his wife and his daughter again.\n\n[Pg 28]\n\nWhat was the reason for this sudden separation, which, in spite of all Byron's protests, ended in a divorce? The poet put it down to the influence of an old governess of Lady Byron, Mrs. Clermont, against whom he launched that terrible satire entitled \"A Sketch,\" and this epigram and apostrophe from the the Moor to Iago:\n\n\"Honest, honest Iago!\n\nIf that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\"\n\nwhich begins with these lines:—\n\n\"Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,\n\nPromoted thence to deck her mistress' head;\n\nNext—for some gracions service unexpress'd,\n\nAnd from its wages only to be guess'd—\n\nRaised from the toilette to the table,—where\n\nHer wondering betters wait behind her chair.\n\nWith eye unmoved, and forehead unabash'd,\n\nShe dines from off the plate she lately wash'd.\"\n\nImmediately a tremendous clamour arose in the papers and in society against the poet who, by force of genius, had already overcome those of his opposers who might be termed the first coalition against him.\n\nIt is ever the case with men in high places who are before the eye of the public: tempests arise unexpectedly, the existence of which is not suspected by the victim till they burst over his head. They may be compared with waterspouts, and they pour down on the poet, be he a Schiller or a Dante, an Ovid or a Byron, utterly overwhelming him, rending his heart and body, tearing down his fame, overturning his reputation, uprooting his honour. These storms come from the enmities, hatred and jealousies roused by his genius; they are the hyenas that dog his steps through the darkness, who dare not attack him while he can stand firm and upright, but which spring on him directly he totters, and devour him as soon as he falls.\n\nByron realised he would have to give way before his enemies; so he left England, meaning to rally his forces amidst the undisturbing surroundings of foreign lands, for[Pg 29] some means of revenging himself upon them. He left England on 25 April 1816. He had published during his six years in London, the first two cantos of Childe Harold, The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, The Siege of Corinth, Lara and The Corsair.\n\nHe departed, and his saddest regrets were for the wife who had exiled him, and for the daughter whom he had hardly seen, and whom he was never to look upon again.\n\n\"Fare thee well! and if for ever.\n\nStill for ever, fare thee well:\n\nEven though unforgiving, never\n\n'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.\n\nWould that breast were bared before thee\n\nWhere thy head so oft hath lain,\n\nWhile that placid sleep came o'er thee\n\nWhich thou ne'er canst know again:\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nBoth shall live, but every morrow\n\nWake us from a widow'd bed.\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nAnd when thou wouldst solace gather,\n\nWhen our child's first accents flow,\n\nWilt thou teach her to say 'Father!'\n\nThough his care she must forego?\n\nWhen her little hands shall press thee,\n\nWhen her lip to thine is press'd,\n\nThink of him whose prayer shall bless thee,\n\nThink of him thy love had bless'd!\n\nShould her lineaments resemble\n\nThose thou never more may'st see,\n\nThen thy heart will softly tremble\n\nWith a pulse yet true to me.\"\n\nThis was to the mother: then, in Childe Harold, he addresses his child:—\n\n\"Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!\n\nAda, sole daughter of my house and heart?\n\nWhen last I saw thy young blue eyes they smiled,\n\nAnd then we parted,—not as now we part,\n\n[Pg 30]But with a hope.—\n\nMy daughter! with thy name this song begun;\n\nMy daughter! with thy name thus much shall end;\n\nI see thee not, I hear thee not, but none\n\nCan be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend\n\nTo whom the shadows of far years extend:\n\nAlbeit my brow thou never shouldst behold,\n\nMy voice shall with thy future visions blend,\n\nAnd reach into thy heart, when mine is cold,\n\nA token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.\n\nTo aid thy mind's development, to watch\n\nThy dawn of little joys, to sit and see\n\nAlmost thy very growth, to view thee catch\n\nKnowledge of objects,—wonders yet to thee!\n\nTo hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,\n\nAnd print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,—\n\nThis, it should seem, was not reserved for me;\n\nYet this was in my nature: as it is,\n\nI know not what is there, yet something like to this.\n\nYet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,\n\nI know that thou wilt love me; though my name\n\nShould be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught\n\nWith desolation, and a broken claim:\n\nThough the grave closed between us,—'twere the same,\n\nI know that thou wilt love me; though to drain\n\nMy blood from out thy being were an aim,\n\nAnd an attainment,—all would be in vain,—\n\nStill thou wouldst love me, still that more than life retain.\n\nThe child of love, though born in bitterness,\n\nAnd nurtured in convulsion. Of thy sire\n\nThese were the elements, and thine no less.\n\nAs yet such are around thee, but thy fire\n\nShall be more temper'd, and thy hope far higher.\n\nSweet be thy cradled slumbers! O'er the sea\n\nAnd from the mountains where I now respire,\n\nFain would I waft such blessing upon thee,\n\nAs, with a sigh, I deem thou might'st have been to me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" remarked Madame de StaÃ«l (the poor exile who, standing by the Lake of Geneva, sighed for the gutter that ran in the rue du Bac),—\"ah! I would not mind being unhappy[Pg 31] if I were Lady Byron, to have inspired such lines as those in my husband's brain!\"\n\nMay be; but Lord Byron and Madame de StaÃ«l would have made an extraordinary couple, and no mistake.\n\nByron was not in such a hurry to travel far afield this time; perhaps he only wanted to stretch the double cord that bound him to England, and not to snap it altogether.\n\nHe landed in Belgium, visited the field of Waterloo, still wet with the blood of three nations; sailed down the Rhine and settled for a time on the borders of the Lake of Geneva. Here it was that he met Madame de StaÃ«l, who was almost as much of an exile under the Restoration as under the Empire. \"My greatest pleasure amidst the magnificent pictures round Lake Geneva was to gaze upon the author of Corinne.\"\n\nAt Diodati, Byron renewed his swimming feat of Abydos by crossing the Lake of Geneva where it is four leagues wide. And it was at Diodati that he wrote the third canto of Childe Harold, The Prisoner of Chillon and Manfred. Goethe in a German journal laid claim to the original idea of Manfred, as though Manfred did not descend as directly from Satan as Faust had from Polichinelle! O thou poor rich man! with all thy European fame and thy world-wide reputation, wouldst thou snatch back the leaf that thy brother-poet so sinfully plucked from thy laurel crown!\n\nCan we not almost hear what D'Alembert said of the author of ZaÃ¯re and of the Dictionnaire philosophique:—\n\n\"This man is past comprehending! he has fame that would satisfy a million of men, and yet he wants another ha'porth.\"\n\nByron took his revenge by dedicating some of his poems to Goethe.\n\nByron left for Italy in the month of October, stopping first at Milan to visit the Ambrosian Library. His next halt was at Verona, where he saw the tomb of Juliet; and, finally, he took up his residence in Venice, where his name became a household word.\n\n[Pg 32]\n\nVenice had never possessed any horses except the four bronze ones which had figured for twelve years on top of Carrousel's triumphal arch. But Byron never walked, and he was therefore the first person whose living horses clattered in the Square of Saint Mark, on the quai des Esclavons and on the banks of the Brenta.\n\nIt was in Venice that the real romance of his life began. Here he had three love affairs, each in a different rank of Venetian society: with Marguerite, Marianne and ... Alas! the most faithless of the three was the great lady who shall be nameless—she whom Byron loved more than all, perhaps, more than Miss Chaworth, more than Caroline Lamb.\n\nIt is curious to think that this lady, even at this day, thirty-three years after the time of which I am writing, is still a fascinating woman. I made her acquaintance in Rome when she was in the full bloom of her beauty, when she was almost as wonderful to listen to as to look at, to hear as to see.\n\nShe lived solely upon the memories of the great poet whom she had loved. It seemed as though the years of their love constituted the one bright spot in her life, and in looking back the obscurity that formed the rest of her life was ignored by her. But if I began to speak of her, I should have to reveal her name; I should have to speak of the walks we had together by moonlight in the Forum and the Coliseum; I should have to repeat what she told me among the shadows of those great ruins, when she never spoke but of the illustrious dead, who had trodden with her the same stones that we were treading and had sat by her side in the same places where we rested.\n\nOh! madam, madam! Why were you unfaithful to the poet's memory, when your memories of him had gone on increasing in strength, aided by his death, until you had magnified your love into a god? Why was not the honour of having been Byron's mistress quite sufficient, instead of taking any title that a husband, no matter how distinguished he might be, could give you?\n\n[Pg 33]\n\nIf I might only venture to repeat here what DÃ©jazet once said to Georges, with reference to Napoleon!\n\nIt is true that Byron, with all his fancies and eccentricities and passions, cannot have been a very pleasant lover. But she should have been faithless to him when he was alive, and not after he was dead.\n\nThe world has forgiven the Empress JosÃ©phine her infidelities in the Tuileries, but it will never forgive Marie-Louise, the widow, her faithlessness at Parma.\n\nWe will not say any more, madam; we will think, instead, of the poems Byron wrote at Venice. Here he composed Marino Faliero, The Two Foscari, Sardanapalus, Cain, The Prophecy of Dante and the third and fourth cantos of Don Juan.\n\nWhen Naples rebelled in 1820 and 1821, Byron wrote to the Neapolitan Government and offered his purse and his sword. So, when reaction set in, and Ferdinand returned a second time from Sicily, and the lists of proscribed persons were published throughout Italy, it was feared Byron's name might be of the number of exiles. Then it happened that the poor people of Ravenna drew up a petition to the cardinal praying he might be allowed to stay among them.\n\nThis man who boldly and openly offered the Neapolitans a thousand louis was a never failing source of helpfulness to the poor of Venice and its surrounding countryside; no poor man ever held out a hand towards him and drew it back empty, even if Byron himself were in the greatest straits, and more than once he had to borrow in order to give. He knew this but too well when he said, \"Those who have persecuted me so long and so cruelly will triumph, and justice will only be done to me when this hand is as cold as their hearts.\"\n\nThus, wherever he went, he left an impression as of fire,—he dazzled, warmed or scorched.\n\nIn 1821, Byron left Venice, in whose streets no one had ever seen him on foot; the Brenta, upon whose banks no one had ever seen him take a walk; the Square of St. Mark, whose beauties he had never contemplated except from a[Pg 34] window, for fear of revealing to the beauties of Venice the slight deformity of his leg, which not even the width of his trousers could disguise.\n\nFrom Venice he went to Pisa. There the news of two fresh troubles awaited him: the death of his natural daughter by an English woman, and the death of his friend Shelley, who was drowned during a sailing trip from Livorno to Lerici. He sent his daughter's body to England for burial.\n\nTo save the body of his friend Shelley from the attentions Italian priests would no doubt have given it, he determined to have it burnt after the custom of the ancients.\n\nTrelawney, the bold pirate, was present, and relates the strange funeral rites, as he relates his lion hunt or his fight with the Malay prince. He was a companion worthy of the noble poet, and was himself a poet; his book is full of marvellous descriptions, all the more wonderful because they are always true, although sounding incredible.\n\n\"We were on the seashore,\" said Trelawney; \"in front of us lay the sea and its islands, behind us the Apennines, and by our side was the great blazing funeral-pyre. The flames, fanned by the wind from the sea, took a thousand fantastic shapes. The weather was very fine; the lazy waves from the Mediterranean gently kissed the shore, the sands were golden yellow and contrasted sharply with the deep blue of the sky; the mountains lifted their snowy crests up into the clouds, and the flames from the pyre steadily burnt higher and higher into the air.\"\n\nFrom Pisa Byron went to Genoa. It was in this city—once the Queen of the Mediterranean—that he conceived the idea of going to Greece, to do for that \"Niobe of the Nations,\" as he called her, the same offices Naples had not thought fit to accept when offered to her.\n\nSo far, Byron had devoted himself mainly to individuals; now he intended to devote himself to a people.\n\nIn the month of April 1823 he entered into communication with the Greek Committee, and towards the end of July he left Italy. His reputation had increased extraordinarily,[Pg 35] not only in Italy, France and Germany, but in England too.\n\nOne fact will give some idea of the height to which his reputation had attained.\n\nAn insurrection had broken out in Scotland in the county where his mother's property was situated. The rebels had to cross Lady Byron's estates to reach their destination, but on the confines of the property they paused and decided to cross in single file, so as only to tread down a narrow path in the crops. They did not take the same precaution on other estates, which they completely devastated.\n\nByron often related this incident with pride.\n\n\"See,\" he said, \"how the hatred of my enemies is being avenged.\"\n\nBefore he left Italy he wrote on the margin of a book that had been lent him—\n\n\"If all that is said of me be true, I am unworthy to see England again; if all they say of me is false, England does not deserve to see me again.\"\n\nBut he had a presentiment that he had left his native land for ever; and Lady Blessington told me herself that, when she met Byron at Genoa, the day before he was to set sail, he said to her—\n\n\"We have met again to-day, but to-morrow we shall be separated, who knows for how long? Something here (and he laid his hand on his heart) tells me that we are meeting for the last time; I am going to Greece, and shall never return from it.\"\n\nTowards the end of December Byron landed in Morea, and, a few days later, he made his way into the town, in spite of the Turkish flotilla that was besieging Missolonghi. He was greeted with enthusiastic shouts by the people, who led him in triumph to the house they had got ready for him.\n\nWhen established there, Byron's whole soul was concentrated in the one desire to see the triumph of the cause he had espoused, or to die in defending a fresh ThermopylÃ¦. Neither of these hopes was to be granted him. He was seized by a violent attack[Pg 36] of fever on 15 February 1824, which ran its course rapidly, caused him much suffering and weakened him greatly. But as soon as he was sufficiently recovered he resumed the daily rides on horseback which were his greatest recreation. On 9 April he got very wet when out riding, and although he changed everything on his return home, he felt ill, for he had been more than two hours in his wet clothes. During the night there was a slight return of the fever, although he slept well; but about eleven o'clock on the morning of the 10th he complained of a violent pain in the head and of suffering in his arms and legs; nevertheless, he managed to mount his horse in the afternoon. His old servant, Fletcher, from whose account we shall now borrow the final details, waited for his return.\n\n\"How have you got on, my lord?\" he asked.\n\n\"The saddle was not dry,\" replied Byron, \"and I am afraid the dampness has made me ill again.\"\n\nAnd indeed it was plain to see next morning that Byron's indisposition had become more serious: he had been feverish all night, and seemed very depressed. Fletcher made him a cup of arrowroot; he tasted a few spoonfuls, then he handed the drink back to the old servant.\n\n\"It is excellent,\" he said, \"but I cannot drink any more of it.\"\n\nOn the third day Fletcher grew seriously uneasy about him. During all his other rheumatic attacks his master had never been sleepless, but this time he could not sleep at all.\n\nSo he went to the two doctors in the town, Drs. Bruno and Millingen, and asked them several questions as to the nature of the illness from which they thought Lord Byron was suffering. Both assured the old valet that he need not be alarmed, that his master was in no danger, but that in two or three days he would be up again, and then, they said, the attack would not return again. This was on the 13th. On the 14th, as the fever had not left his master and the invalid still had no sleep, Fletcher begged Byron, in spite of the[Pg 37] assurance of the two doctors, to let him send for Dr. Thomas, from Zante.\n\n\"Consult the two doctors,\" the sick man replied, \"and act as they direct.\"\n\nFletcher obeyed, and the two doctors said that there was not any necessity for a third opinion. Fletcher brought back this answer to his master, who shook his head and said—\n\n\"I am much afraid they do not know anything at all about my illness.\"\n\n\"In that case, my lord,\" Fletcher insisted, \"do call in another doctor.\"\n\n\"They tell me,\" Byron continued, without replying directly to Fletcher, \"that it is a chill such as I have had before.\"\n\n\"But I am sure, my lord, you have never had such a serious one before,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" was Byron's reply; and he fell into a reverie from which no amount of persuasion could arouse him.\n\nOn the 15th, Fletcher, whose faithful devotion divined the real condition of his master, again asked permission to be allowed to fetch Dr. Thomas; but the doctors of Missolonghi still persisted there was no cause for alarm. Until now, they had treated their patient with purgatives, which, as Byron had only taken a cup or two of broth during eight days, were much too strong remedies and could not have any desirable effect. They but increased the weakness, which was already extreme because of want of sleep.\n\nOn the evening of the 15th, however, the doctors began to be uneasy, and talked of bleeding their patient; but he strenuously opposed this, asking Dr. Millingen if he thought the need for bleeding was urgent. The doctor replied that he believed he could put it off, without danger, until next day. So, on the evening of the 16th, they bled Byron in the right arm, taking sixteen ounces of greatly inflamed blood out of him. Dr. Bruno shook his head as he examined the blood.\n\n\"I always told him he ought to be bled,\" he murmured, \"but he would never let it be done.\"\n\n[Pg 38]\n\nThen the doctors fell into a lengthy dispute over the time lost.\n\nAgain Fletcher proposed to send to Zante for Dr. Thomas, but the doctors replied—\n\n\"It would be useless; before he could get here, your master will be either out of danger or dead.\"\n\nIn the meantime the disease grew worse, and Dr. Bruno advised a second bleeding. Fletcher broke it to his master that the two doctors deemed another bleeding indispensable, and this time Lord Byron did not make any resistance; he held out his arm and said—\n\n\"Here is my arm: they may do what they wish.\" Then he added, \"Did I not tell you, Fletcher, that they do not understand anything at all about my illness!\"\n\nByron grew weaker and weaker. On the 17th, they bled him in the morning, and twice again in the afternoon of the same day. He fainted away after each bleeding, and from that day he himself gave up all hope.\n\n\"I cannot sleep,\" he said to Fletcher, \"and you know that I have not had any sleep for a week; now, it is a fact that a man cannot live without sleep for any length of time; after a time he goes mad, and nothing can save him. I would rather blow my brains out ten times than go mad. I am not afraid of death, I shall watch its approach with more composure than people would believe.\"\n\nOn the 18th, Byron was perfectly satisfied of his approaching end.\n\n\"I fear,\" he said to Fletcher, \"that Tita and you will both fall ill with nursing me like this, day and night.\"\n\nStill, both refused to take any rest. Fletcher had been wise enough to take away his master's pistols and dagger out of his reach, ever since the 16th, when he saw that the fever was likely to produce delirium.\n\nOn the 18th, he repeated several times that the Missolonghi doctors did not understand his case at all.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Fletcher replied for the tenth time, \"let me go and fetch Dr. Thomas from Zante.\"\n\n[Pg 39]\n\n\"No, do not go.... Send for him, Fletcher, but be quick about it.\"\n\nFletcher did not lose a second in despatching a messenger, and then he informed the two doctors that he had just sent for Dr. Thomas.\n\n\"You were quite right,\" said they, \"for we have ourselves begun to feel very anxious.\"\n\nOn re-entering his master's room, Byron said to Fletcher—\n\n\"Well, have you sent?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Good! I wish to know what is the matter with me.\"\n\nA few moments later, he was seized with a fresh attack of delirium, and when he recovered consciousness, he remarked—\n\n\"I begin to believe I am seriously ill. If I am to die sooner than I expected, I desire to give you some instructions. Will you be sure to carry them out for me?\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord, you can be sure of my faithfulness,\" the valet replied; \"but you will live for long enough yet, I hope, and be able to attend to your own affairs.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Byron, shaking his head; \"no, the end has come.... I must tell you everything, Fletcher, and without a moment's loss of time.\"\n\n\"Shall I fetch pen and ink and paper, my lord?\" asked the valet.\n\n\"Oh no; we should waste too much time, and we have none to lose. Pay attention.\"\n\n\"I am listening, my lord.\"\n\n\"Your future is assured.\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord,\" cried the poor valet, bursting into tears, \"I entreat you to think of more important matters.\"\n\n\"My child!\" murmured the dying man, \"my dear daughter, my poor Ada, if I could but have seen her! Take her my blessing, Fletcher; also to my sister Augusta and to her children.... You must take it, too, to Lady Byron.... Tell her ... tell her everything ... you stand well in her estimation....\"\n\nThe dying man's voice failed him, and, although he made[Pg 40] efforts to continue speaking, the valet could only make out disjointed expressions, from which, with the greatest difficulty, he gathered the following:—\n\n\"Fletcher ... if you do not carry out ... the orders I have given you ... I will haunt you ... if God will let me....\"\n\n\"But, my lord,\" cried the valet in despair, \"I have not been able to hear a word of what you have been saying to me.\"\n\n\"Oh! my God, my God!\" whispered Byron, \"then it is now too late.... Have you really not heard me?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; but try again to make me understand your wishes.\"\n\n\"Impossible!... impossible!\" murmured the dying man; \"it is too late ... all is over ... and yet ... come close, come close, Fletcher ... I will try again.\"\n\nAnd he renewed his attempts, but all was in vain; he could only utter a few broken words, such as, \"My wife!... my child ... my sister. You know all ... you will tell them everything ... you know my wishes.\"\n\nNothing more was intelligible.\n\nThis was at midday on the 18th. The doctors held a fresh consultation, and decided to give the patient quinine in wine.\n\nHe had only taken, as I have said, a little broth and two spoonfuls of arrowroot for eight days. He took the quinine, and showed by signs that he wanted to sleep; he did not speak again unless questioned.\n\n\"Would you like me to fetch Mr. Parry?\" Fletcher asked him.\n\n\"Yes, go and fetch him,\" he replied.\n\nA moment later, the valet returned with him. Mr. Parry leant over his bed, and Byron became excited as he recognised him.\n\n\"Lie quite quiet,\" said Mr. Parry; and the invalid shed a few tears and then seemed to fall asleep.\n\nThis was the beginning of a state of coma that lasted nearly twenty-four hours.\n\n[Pg 41]\n\nThen, towards eight in the evening, he roused, and Fletcher heard him say, \"And now I must go to sleep....\"\n\nThey were the last words he uttered. His head fell back motionless on his pillow. He never moved for twenty-four hours; there were occasional spasms of suffocation and a raucous sound in his breathing: that was all. Fletcher called Tita to help him raise the head of the invalid, who seemed quite numbed, and the two servants raised his head every time the signs of suffocation returned.\n\nThis lasted until the 19th, when, at six in the evening, Byron opened and closed his eyes without any sign of pain and without moving any other part of his body.\n\n\"Oh! my God,\" cried Fletcher, \"I think my lord has breathed his last!\"\n\nThe doctors came near and felt his pulse.\n\n\"You are right,\" said they; \"he is dead!....\"\n\nOn 22 April, Byron's remains were taken to the church where Marco Bozariz and General Normann lie buried. The body was enclosed in a rough wooden coffin; it was covered by a black mantle, and on the mantle they placed a helmet, a sword and a wreath of laurels.\n\nByron had expressed a wish that his body should be buried in his native land; but the Greeks asked to be allowed to keep his heart, and those who had cruelly made that heart bleed when he was alive, gave it up when he was dead.\n\nHis daughter Ada, whom I have since seen in Florence, was declared the adopted daughter of Greece. I do not know whether King Otho I. remembered this fact when he came to the throne.\n\n[Pg 42]\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nUsurped celebrity—M. Lemercier and his works—Racan's white hare-Le Fiesque by M. Ancelot—The Romantic artists—Scheffer—Delacroix —Sigalon—Schnetz—Coigniet—Boulanger—GÃ©ricault—La MÃ©duse in the artist's studio—Lord Byron's funeral obsequies in England—Sheridan's body claimed for debt\n\nWhile Lord Byron's body was being carried from Missolonghi to England, the literary movement in France was steadily progressing. M. LiadiÃ¨re and M. Lemercier each did their best in grappling with Shakespeare and Rowe, each produced Jane Shore; M. LiadiÃ¨re at the OdÃ©on on 2 April, and M. Lemercier at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre-FranÃ§ais on the 1st. M. LiadiÃ¨re's production just managed to pay its way, while M. Lemercier's was a failure, in spite of Talma, who played two parts in it—those of Gloucester and a beggar. Talma was wonderful in this play, poor though it was. In it he attempted what was in those days looked upon as a very extraordinary thing. He, a man of fine presence, graceful in bearing, full of poetry, lofty in mind and eloquent, played the part of the hunchbacked cripple Richard. The way he managed to make his right shoulder look higher than his left and his arm appear paralysed was a miracle of skill, and the denunciatory scene was a miracle of talent. But nothing could save such a wretched piece. It is now high time some undeserved reputations, supported by fine coteries and associations of intrigue and shuffling, should be shown in their true light.\n\nFor instance, there is the author of Agamemnon and of Pinto,—he did not deserve a quarter of the reputation he received. Agamemnon is a dull, lifeless play, devoid of poetic[Pg 43] feeling, sense, rhythm and style; what is it compared with the Orestes of Ãschylus? Pinto is a drama of the school of Beaumarchais, the worst type of dramatic school I know; the play would have died a natural death at the end of eight or ten representations if the Imperial Censor had not been so stupid as to attempt to stifle it. The persecution accorded to Pinto gave it a species of celebrity, but, let it be played nowadays and one would soon see the worthlessness of the imitation of Ãschylus and Seneca, the so-called original creation. And yet these two plays were the author's principal works.\n\nTry, too, to read a number of other tragedies and dramas and poems that have fallen, buried beneath the cat-calls, laughter and hootings of the public! Try to read MÃ©lÃ©agre or Lovelace or le LÃ©vite d'ÃphraÃ¯m; then, when you have thrown these first three works of the same author aside, and feel sufficiently recovered and can breathe freely once more, take up the task again and try to read Ophis, Plaute or la ComÃ©die latine, Baudouin, Christophe Colomb, Charlemagne, Saint Louis, la DÃ©mence de Charles VI., FrÃ©degonde and Brunehaut, which Mademoiselle Rachel for some unknown purpose drew from the tomb, and galvanised three or four times without being able to bring back to life. Then, what else? Stay...we should be lost on the battlefield, among the productions that did not even linger wounded, but fell stark dead—Camille and le Masque de poix, and Cahin-Caha and la Panhypocrisiade: folly succeeding mediocrity; sheer nonsense and balderdash.\n\nAnd yet, although wounded by these rebuffs and completely maimed by his falls, M. Lemercier sat quietly on in his arm-chair in the Palais Mazarin—as did his colleagues, M. Droz, M. Briffaut, and M. Lebrun, one trying to make people forget that he had written a little volume on Bonheur, another that he had perpetrated a tragedy called Minus II., and the third, that he had missed fire in his le Cid d'Andalousie and mangled Schiller's Maria Stuart—he need not have troubled to say anything, the world would have let him sleep as quietly[Pg 44] in his tomb as the spectators had fain have slept at the performance of his pieces, if hissing had never been invented. But nothing of the kind happened! When M. Lemercier perceived the literary movement of 1829 he cried out at the sacrilege, want of good taste and scandal of the thing; he signed petitions to the king to have the representation of Henri III. and of Marion Delorme stopped; he barred the entrance to the Academy when Lamartine and Victor Hugo endeavoured to gain an entrance; he set the Archbishop of Paris against the one and produced a M. Flourens to checkmate the other; he recovered the use of his legs sufficiently to run about collecting votes against them, and the use of his right hand to turn the lock against them. Thank Heaven I had very little to do with this wicked little cur, neither have I had any personal quarrel with him, as I have never had any dealings with the Academy; but since someone must rise up and speak for justice I claim the privilege of being the first to set the example.\n\nWhen M. Flourens was nominated in place of Hugo, I was passing through the green-room of the ThÃ©Ã¢tre-FranÃ§ais. I forget what the new play was, but M. Lemercier was holding forth there against the author of Notre-Dame de Paris and of Marion Delorme and the Orientales, just as he had opposed him all day long, silently, in the Academy. I listened to his diatribe for a few minutes, then, shaking my head, I said to him—\n\n\"Monsieur Lemercier, you have refused your vote to Victor Hugo; but there is one thing you will some day be compelled to yield him, and that is your own place. Take care lest, instead of the ill-natured things you are saying against him here, he be not obliged to say a kind word for you some day to the Academy.\"\n\nAnd it happened just as I had predicted. It was no easy matter to praise Lemercier, but Hugo accomplished the matter by describing the period instead of speaking of the man, by referring to the emperor rather than to the poet.\n\n[Pg 45]\n\n\"Have you read my speech?\" Hugo asked me the day after he had made it.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think you read as though you had just succeeded Bonaparte as a member of the Institute, instead of M. Lemercier as a member of the Academy.\"\n\n\"The deuce! I would much rather have seen you there than myself. How would you have got out of it?\"\n\n\"As Racan did, by saying my big white rabbit had eaten my speech.\"\n\nRacan, it will be remembered, once presented himself before the Academy with the scraps of a speech he had meant to read.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I had prepared a splendid speech, which could not fail to have won your suffrages; but my big white rabbit gobbled it up this morning.... I have brought you the remains, and you must try to make the best you can of them!\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" replied Hugo; \"I could have done that, but it never occurred to me.\"\n\nM. LiadiÃ¨re's Jane Shore did for Mademoiselle Georges what M. Lemercier's Jane Shore had done for Talma. It was, besides, the first attempt Mademoiselle Georges had made in Shakespearean drama: she led up to it in Christine and in LucrÃ¨ce Borgia.\n\nIt was the age of limitations; no one was strong enough to be original. They had to look for fresh things across the frontier; they sought admission to the theatres on the shoulders of Rowe or Schiller: if they were successful, they quietly put the German or English author outside; if they came a cropper, they fell on him, and it broke the shock of their fall.\n\nAfter M. LiadiÃ¨re's production of Jane Shore, the OdÃ©on presented M. Ancelot's Fiesque. But M. Ancelot was a purist: he never for one moment supposed that Schiller's Fiesque could be presented complete as in the German play;[Pg 46] therefore he entirely and discreetly suppressed the character of the Moor.\n\nCan you imagine Fiesque shorn of the Moor! without the Moor! the main peg on which the drama is hung! Without the Moor! the character for which Schiller constructed his play! When shall we have a law which, whilst permitting translation, will forbid mutilation? The Italians have no law affecting translators; but they have a proverb as short as it is expressive, as concise as it is true, \"Traduttore, traditore.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Romantic school, although still shy in theatrical and literary circles, was boldly invading other branches of art.\n\nM. Thiers, in history, had published his RÃ©volution franÃ§aise, and Botta his Histoire d'Italie; M. de Barante was producing his excellent Chronique des ducs de Bourgogne, a work full of knowledge and brilliancy, which justly, this time, though accidentally, opened the Academy doors to its author. But the struggle was more noticeable in painting. David dead and Girodet just dead, their successors were such men as Scheffer, Delacroix, Sigalon, Schnetz, Coigniet, Boulanger and GÃ©ricault. The works of this galaxy of bold young artists adorned the walls of the Salon of 1824. Scheffer hung his Mort de Gaston de Foix. It was one of his first pictures, and rather gaudy in colouring, but the face of the warrior kneeling at the head of Gaston stood out most remarkably; Scheffer was the painter-poet, the best translator of Goethe I know; he re-created a whole world of German characters, from Mignon to the King of Thule, from Faust to Marguerite.\n\nIt was Scheffer who transferred to canvas Dante's great and exquisite story of Francesca da Rimini, a conception which all dramatic poets have failed to reproduce; Scheffer found time to join in every conspiracy going, in Dermoncourt's, Caron's and la Fayette's, and yet managed to become one of the finest painters France has ever produced.\n\nThen there was Delacroix, whose Massacre de Scio roused much discussion among all schools of painters. Delacroix was doomed to be pursued by fanatical ignoramuses and[Pg 47] determined vilifiers, just as was Hugo in literature; he had already become known though his Dante traversant le Styx; and all his life he maintained the privilege—rare among artists—of being able to arouse a storm of hatred and of admiration upon the production of each fresh work. Delacroix is an intellectual man, full of knowledge as well as imagination, but he has one idiosyncrasy, he will persist in trying to become the colleague of M. Picot and of M. Abel de Pujol, who, let us hope, will happily have none of him.\n\nNext comes Sigalon, with his rough, passionate Southern nature. His picture, Locuste faisant sur un esclave l'essai de ses poisons, had been recommended to the notice of M. Laffitte, and this banker patron of art bought it, probably before he had seen it; when it was hung in his salon, it terrified the bank clientÃ¨le and all the jobbers of the money market. Everyone asked the future minister why he had bought such a horrible picture, rather than one of Madame Haudebourg-Lescaut's or Mademoiselle d'Hervilly's little gems. M. Laffitte was plagued to such an extent that he sent for Sigalon and begged him to take back his Locuste, which threatened to send the great ladies of the commercial world into hysterics, imploring him to paint him something else in its place.\n\nSigalon took back his Locuste, but I do not know what he gave in exchange. Alas! Sigalon was among the number of those destined to premature death. He was sent to Rome to copy Michael Angelo's Last Judgment, and he had but just time to bequeath that great piece of work to France, and to stretch out his arms towards his country, before he died.\n\nSchnetz had three pictures in the Salon of 1824—two great canvases which might have been painted by anybody just as well as by himself, and one of those genre paintings in which he is inimitable. This genre painting was called un Sixte-Quint enfant, the subject being a gipsy woman predicting he would become pope. The reader will guess with what fidelity Schnetz succeeded in depicting in his canvas, six foot high by[Pg 48] four feet wide, an old fortune-teller, a shepherd lad and a young Roman girl: the Sixte-Quint was a masterpiece.\n\nCoigniet's le Massacre des Innocents was hung opposite the door, and riveted attention directly people entered. It showed a woman crouching down, disordered in appearance by a long journey, terror in her looks and very pale, hiding herself, or rather hiding her child, in the corner of a ruined wall, whilst the massacre was proceeding in the distance. It was a fine piece of work, every detail of which, well thought out, well executed, well painted, I can still recall, after twenty-five years.\n\nBoulanger had taken the subject of his painting from the works of the famous poet who had just died.
