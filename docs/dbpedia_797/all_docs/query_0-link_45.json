        "text": "Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient (as a member of the Band) Robbie Robertson was the featured guest for a recent installment of the GRAMMY Museum's An Evening With series. Before an intimate audience at the Museum's Clive Davis Theater, Robertson discussed his seminal work with the Band, meeting and touring with Bob Dylan and his most recent solo album, How To Become Clairvoyant, among other topics.\n\n\"When we were making [Music From] Big Pink, [we'd gathered] all of these pieces of music that we got from the side of the road,\" said Robertson regarding the Band's 1968 debut album. \"It was just a natural procedure. When we were writing and working on music, you could just feel that it had years and years of being in a wine keg.\"\n\nBorn in Toronto, Robertson got his career start in 1958 when he teamed with rockabilly artist Ronnie Hawkins' backing band the Hawks. The Hawks — Robertson (vocals, guitar), Rick Danko (bass), Levon Helm (vocals, drums), and Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel (keyboards) — broke away from Hawkins in 1963. The quintet landed the opening slot on Bob Dylan's 1965–1966 world tour, and would rechristen themselves the Band. The Band's debut, 1968's Music From Big Pink, reached No. 30 on the Billboard 200 and is considered a watershed for American Roots music and country-influenced rock. The Band followed in 1969, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and spawning their highest-charting hit, \"Up On Cripple Creek\" (No. 25). The Band teamed with Dylan for 1974's Planet Waves, an album featuring 11 Dylan compositions. The album topped the Billboard 200 and spawned the Top 50 hit \"On A Night Like This.\" Two years later, the Band's farewell concert was captured by GRAMMY-winning director Martin Scorsese and the resulting documentary and soundtrack, The Last Waltz, was released in 1978.\n\nRobertson subsequently worked as a composer, composing music and/or producing soundtracks for films such as Raging Bull, Casino, The Color Of Money, and The Departed. He released his first solo album, Robbie Robertson, in 1987. Featuring appearances by Danko and Helm, Peter Gabriel and U2, the album cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 and earned Robertson his first GRAMMY nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. Robertson followed with Storyville (1991), Music For The Native Americans (1994) and Contact From The Underworld Of Red Boy (1998).\n\nAlong with Scorsese and producer Hal Willner, Robertson received his fourth career GRAMMY nomination in 2003 for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album For A Motion Picture for his work on Gangs Of New York. Music From Big Pink and The Band were inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The Band was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Recording Academy in 2008.\n\nHow To Become Clairvoyant, Robertson's fifth solo album, was released in April 2011. Featuring guest appearances by GRAMMY winners Eric Clapton, Tom Morello and Steve Winwood, the album peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, Robertson's highest-charting solo album to date.\n\nUpcoming GRAMMY Museum events include The Drop: Ruthie Foster (Jan. 31) and An Evening With Michelle Phillips from The Mamas And The Papas (Feb. 16).\n\nFor more information on the GRAMMY Museum, visit www.grammymuseum.org.\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy has announced a series of exhibits for 2024 at the Paley Museum in New York City, the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles, and the Gary Nader Art Centre in Miami.\n\n\"For 25 years we have had the immense privilege of celebrating excellence in Latin music, accompanying our music creators in their successes worldwide. These exhibits are a magnificent opportunity to bring the magic of the Latin GRAMMYs to the public,\" said Manuel Abud, CEO of the Latin Recording Academy. \"We invite all music lovers to join us in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami to enjoy these exhibits, which are filled with unforgettable moments and important achievements that have marked our history.\"\n\nThe 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, officially known as the 25th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will air live from the Kaseya Center in Miami on Thursday, Nov. 14. The three-hour telecast, produced by TelevisaUnivision, the world's leading Spanish-language media and content company, will broadcast live on Univision, Galavisión, and ViX on Thursday Nov. 14, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT (7 p.m. CT), with a one-hour pre-show starting at 7 p.m. ET/PT. This year’s nominees will be announced on Tuesday, Sept. 17.\n\nThis year, the Latin GRAMMYs will debut a new Field and two new Categories: Best Latin Electronic Music Performance, housed within the new Electronic Music Field, and Best Contemporary Mexican Music Album (Regional-Mexican Field). Ahead of the 2024 Latin GRAMMYs, the Latin Recording Academy will host the official Latin GRAMMY Week 2024, which includes multiple events throughout Miami-Dade County including the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year gala, which this year honors 18-time Latin GRAMMY winner and two-time GRAMMY winner Carlos Vives.\n\nLearn more about the new Latin Recording Academy exhibits taking place in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami below:\n\nThe Paley Museum, New York City\n\nSept. 13 - Nov. 3\n\nThe Latin GRAMMYs kick-off exhibit at the Paley Museum showcases the remarkable 25-year history of Latin music, celebrating the vibrant cultural tapestry that has shaped the awards show into a global phenomenon. Visitors can explore priceless artifacts, glamorous costumes, and iconic instruments from music superstars like Ricky Martin, Rosalía, Carlos Santana, and Shakira — all Latin GRAMMY and GRAMMY winners — as well as celebrated New Yorkers such as Celia Cruz and Rúben Blades, whose influence has left an indelible mark on the music world. The exhibit will highlight some of the most unforgettable moments from the Latin GRAMMY Awards telecast, trace the show’s incredible evolution, and demonstrate why Latin music has become an essential part of our culture.\n\n\"It is a tremendous honor to partner with the Latin Recording Academy and to have the privilege of hosting this historic 25th anniversary celebration of the Latin GRAMMY Awards at the Paley Center,\" said Maureen J. Reidy, President & CEO of The Paley Center for Media. \"This must-see exhibit will honor the indelible impact of Latin music and its visionary artists, whose innovative rhythms, poignant lyrics, and extraordinary contributions have redefined the global musical landscape and have had a profound impact not only on music but on entertainment and culture worldwide.\"\n\nGRAMMY Museum, Los Angeles\n\nSept. 19 - Dec. 18\n\nHosted on the 2nd floor of the GRAMMY Museum as part of its permanent Latin Music Gallery, this exhibit will enhance the museum's extensive Latin aisle by featuring artifacts from global Latin superstars like Shakira, Carlos Santana, Karol G, and Rosalía, among others. The exhibit will explore the last 25 years of Latin GRAMMY history and the diverse musical genres and cultures that have graced its stage.\n\nAt its core, the exhibit underscores how Latin music has evolved into a powerful commercial force in the international music landscape over the past quarter-century, with the Latin GRAMMYs playing a pivotal role in its global rise. The exhibit will also explore the history of the institution and its most significant moments, highlighting Latin music's creative complexity and enduring cultural impact.\n\n\"The Latin GRAMMYs have undeniably established themselves as a cultural landmark and a powerful influence in global music over the past 25 years,\" said Michael Sticka, President and CEO of the GRAMMY Museum. \"This fall, we eagerly anticipate commemorating more than two decades of musical excellence, memorable highlights, and extraordinary moments from the Latin GRAMMYs at the GRAMMY Museum.\"\n\nGary Nader Art Centre, Miami\n\nSept. 26 - Dec. 20\n\nMiami will host a first-of-its-kind collection of 25 years of Latin GRAMMY official art, featuring original paintings by renowned artists including Romero Britto, Walter Goldfarb, Michael V. Rios — who also designed the cover of Carlos Santana’s multi-GRAMMY-winning album Supernatural —and Patssi Valdez, among others. From mixed media to collage, murals and oil paintings, the collection includes renowned visual artists from several countries. In addition,Brazilian muralist Aline Bispo, the official artist for the 24th Annual Latin GRAMMY Awards, will unveil a new piece to inaugurate the festivities.\n\n\"It is a profound honor to host the art exhibition commemorating the Latin GRAMMYs at our gallery in Miami. This city, with its vibrant culture and deep Latin roots, is the perfect setting to celebrate the rich heritage and artistic achievements of Latin music. We are thrilled to bring together art and music in such a dynamic fashion, highlighting the synergy between these two powerful expressions of creativity,\" said Gary Nader, founder of the Gary Nader Art Centre.\n\nIn 2005, South Korean producer and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk (aka \"hitman\" Bang) founded Bit Hit Entertainment. Only eight years later, he finished assembling what would come to be the label’s groundbreaking boy group, BTS. The rest is history, now chronicled in \"HYBE: We Believe In Music,\" the first full-floor K-pop exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum, which runs through Sept. 15.\n\nFollowing the success of Bit Hit’s premier act, and that of other artists under acquired labels SOURCE MUSIC and PLEDIS Entertainment, the company eventually evolved to become HYBE in 2021. \"I think HYBE is very special in that they have gone beyond being just a K-pop company,\" says Kelsey Goelz, curator of the exhibit. \"They have many different sub labels. They’ve come to America and gotten involved in the music business here, and then they’re also working in AI and gaming.\"\n\nBut beyond its global presence, one of K-pop’s ever-captivating elements is the sheer amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making it possible, even when HYBE artists like ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM make it look easy. There’s a core humanity to this work ethic and dogged tenacity — to the level of artistry in general — that speaks to K-pop fans around the world.\n\nWhile HYBE’s growth shows no signs of slowing down yet, the GRAMMY Museum exhibit takes a look back on the entertainment company’s legacy thus far. Read on for the five things we learned from the \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" exhibit.\n\nAll photos Courtesy of the Recording Academy™️/photo by Rebecca Sapp, Getty Images© 2024.\n\nIn A Decade, BTS Built Themselves IntoA Global Phenomenon\n\nHYBE’s proffered ethos is \"we believe in music\" — this motto gives the special exhibit its name, while also serving as a mission statement.\n\nIn a series of recorded interviews on view in the exhibit, HYBE’s idol songwriters share their process for and perspective on making music. The main takeaway: Inspiration comes in different forms. While writing, BTS’s j-hope pictures ideas as tree branches that sprout outward, while RM sees his rap verses as a realized world to live inside.\n\nLiterally, too, their lyrics mark the passage of time. If you’ve ever wondered why Suga circles back to motifs across the years, the rapper has all the answers for you here.\n\nThere’s also a conversation with WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, one of the K-pop industry’s most prolific idol composers with more than 150 credits to his name. It’s a penchant for plain language, he says, that makes the lyrics he writes really sing; the band’s beloved B-side \"Hug,\" for example, gets its potency from everyday words and phrases. TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s Yeonjun likewise fills visitors in on the origin story behind co-written \"Maze in the Mirror,\" a misty reflection of their tough trainee days.\n\nThis isn’t to say they haven’t had help, of course. Nearby, clips of HYBE producers Pdogg, BUMZU, and ZICO, settled in their respective studios, walk us through how the instrumentals for songs like BTS’s \"ON\" and SEVENTEEN’s \"Lilili Yabbay\" came to be. Peruse at your leisure — for those curious about the creation of K-pop’s biggest hits, this corner of the exhibit could easily take up the better part of a trip.\n\nFans Make K-Pop Special\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum joins forces with HYBE to present its newest exhibit, HYBE: We Believe In Music, A GRAMMY Museum Exhibit.

We're very excited about this partnership with GRAMMY Museum, and we look forward to welcoming music fans who visit the museum to enjoy and connect with our historical pieces.\"\n\nThe exhibit highlights the roots of HYBE's meteoric rise. In 2005, South Korean producer, composer, and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk, known as \"hitman\" Bang, changed the trajectory of Korean pop music by launching the record label Big Hit Entertainment. He soon signed a talented 16-year-old rapper named RM, which became the first step in creating the label's groundbreaking boy band — BTS. With the group's global success, \"hitman\" Bang and Big Hit Entertainment became known as musical trailblazers and record industry innovators. Big Hit Entertainment has now evolved into HYBE, which only continues to break boundaries in music and beyond.\n\nHere are six takeaway points from an evening marked by celebration and transcendent musical memories.\n\nDonna Summer’s “I Feel Love” Has Lost None Of Its Edge\n\nStudious music fans are well aware that “I Feel Love” — written by Donna Summer with visionary Italian producer Giorgio Moroder and British songwriter Pete Bellotte — is a shimmering disco gem, a futuristic precursor to the entire EDM genre. What was stunning about the Gala performance of the track by singer and actress Andra Day is how edgy and fresh the 1977 track still sounds today. Day’s ethereal reading was appropriately hypnotic, with live drums, nebulous synth textures and glorious, three-part vocal harmonies.\n\nThe Future Of American Music Is In Good Hands With The War and Treaty\n\nFormed by husband and wife Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter, The War and Treaty were rightfully nominated for Best New Artist at the 2024 GRAMMYs earlier this year. The duo’s electrifying combination of Americana, gospel, and rock is especially effective on a live stage, and the pair delivered a memorable rendition of Charley Pride's inducted Hall Of Fame country hit, “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’,” recorded in 1971. The War and Treaty also received a standing ovation later in the evening for their performance of Ray Charles' classic, \"What'd I Say,\" released in 1959.\n\n26 Years Later, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Is Still Ahead Of Its Time\n\nReleased in August 1998, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill sold more than 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and became the first hip-hop artist to win Album Of The Year at the 1999 GRAMMYs. At the Gala, Andra Day delighted the audience — including Lauryn Hill and her family — with a soulful version of hidden track “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” originally a Frankie Valli hit from 1967. Day's performance was marked by brassy accents and funky bass lines, creating an unapologetically lush rendition that mirrored the sonic richness of Hill's original take.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill': Why The Multiple GRAMMY-Winning Record Is Still Everything 25 Years Later\n\nAtlantic Records Transformed The Face Of Global Culture\n\nCelebrating 75 years of inaugural label honoree Atlantic Records in the span of a few minutes loomed like an impossible task, but the Gala producers paid tribute to the legacy label well. Beginning with a short video, the event segment highlighted the miraculous roster assembled by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson that included Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Phil Collins, and Bruno Mars — to name just a few. But it was the actual performances that highlighted the label’s hold on pop culture: Ravyn Lenae’s breathy take on Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly With His Song” made a case for considering the 1973 hit as one of the most vulnerable recordings of all time. On the other side of the dynamic spectrum, the epic rendition of Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” by alt-rock quartet Shinedown was appropriately intense.\n\nThe Wondrous Legacy Of Stax Records Should Not Be Underestimated\n\nThe home of such legendary artists as Otis Redding, The Staple Singers and Carla Thomas, Memphis-based Stax Records developed a rich, ragged sound with gospel, blues, R&B and luminous pop as its foundational pillars. Currently the subject of an HBO documentary series, \"Stax: Soulsville USA,\" the record label defined American music during the ‘60s and ‘70s. Memphis singer/songwriter William Bell was one of its most prolific artists, and he regaled guests with a performance of his Hall of Fame inducted debut 1961 single, “You Don’t Miss Your Water.” At 84 years of age — and the winner of a Best Americana Album at the 2017 GRAMMYs — Bell was in rare form, and the band backed him up seamlessly, reproducing the sinuous organ lines of the original.\n\nRead more: 1968: A Year Of Change For The World, Memphis & Stax Records\n\nFuture Editions Of The Gala Will Continue To Surprise And Delight\n\nThe inaugural GRAMMY Hall of Fame Gala set a high standard for future celebrations of iconic recordings. The event proved to be fertile ground for the creation of indelible music moments, showcasing the beauty and authority of music across genres and generations. Other honored Hall of Fame inducted recordings including De La Soul’s 3 Feet High And Rising, Guns’N’Roses Appetite For Destruction, the Buena Vista Social Club’s debut, Wanda Jackson’s “Let’s Have A Party,” Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra’s “Ory’s Creole Trombone” and The Doobie Brothers’ “What A Fool Believes.”\n\nAs we look ahead, the excitement for future Galas grows, with each event promising to honor more historic recordings, and uphold the tradition of celebrating excellence in music's rich legacy.\n\nExplore The 2024 GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Inducted Recordings: Lauryn Hill, Guns N' Roses, De La Soul, Donna Summer & Many More"
