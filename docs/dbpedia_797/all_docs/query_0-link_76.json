        "text": "Donovan\n\nAllmusic Biography : Upon his emergence during the mid-60s, Donovan was anointed \"Britains answer to Bob Dylan,\" a facile but largely unfounded comparison which compromised the Scottish folk-pop troubadours own unique vision. Where the thrust of Dylans music remains its bleak introspection and bitter realism, Donovan fully embraced the wide-eyed optimism of the flower power movement, his ethereal, ornate songs radiating a mystical beauty and childlike wonder; for better or worse, his recordings remain quintessential artifacts of the psychedelic era, capturing the peace and love idealism of their time to perfection. Donovan Leitch was born May 10, 1946 in Glasgow and raised outside of London; at 18 he recorded his first demo, and in 1965 was tapped as a regular on the television pop showcase Ready, Steady, Go! He soon issued his debut single \"Catch the Wind,\" earning the first round of Dylan comparisons with his ramshackle folk sound and ragamuffin look; the single nevertheless reached the U.K. Top Five, with a subsequent meeting between the two singer/songwriters captured in the classic D.A. Pennebaker documentary Dont Look Back.\n\nDonovans follow-up single, \"Colours,\" was also a hit, and after making his American debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, he issued Fairytale, his second and last LP for the Hickory label. Signing with Epic in 1966, he released his breakthrough album, Sunshine Superman, which in its exotic arrangements and pointedly psychedelic lyrical outlook heralded a major shift from his previous work; the title track topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, with the enigmatic \"Mellow Yellow\" reaching the number two spot a few months later. Donovan remained a chart fixture throughout 1967, generating a series of hits including \"Epistle to Dippy,\" \"There Is a Mountain,\" and \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\"; that year he traveled to India alongside the Beatles to study with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a journey which inspired him to renounce drug use and encourage his listeners to turn to meditation. The ambitious double album A Gift from a Flower to a Garden followed, and in 1968 Donovan resurfaced with The Hurdy Gurdy Man, scoring a Top Five smash with the hallucinatory title cut; the record also yielded the hit \"Jennifer Juniper.\"\n\nBarabajagal from 1969 generated Donovans final Top 40 hit, \"Atlantis\"; for the title track, he collaborated with the Jeff Beck Group, with whom he also worked on 1970s Open Road. He then retreated to Ireland, emerging from a period of seclusion by starring in and scoring the 1972 film The Pied Piper; a pair of new LPs, Cosmic Wheels and Essence to Essence, appeared the following year to disappointing reviews and little commercial interest. Following 1974s 7-Tease, he spent the next years living quietly in Californias Joshua Tree desert, mounting only a small club tour to promote 1976s Slow Down; a self-titled LP appeared a year later, and in the wake of 1983s Jerry Wexler-produced Lady of the Stars, he essentially retired from writing and recording altogether. The Donovan revival began in earnest in 1991 when Happy Mondays titled a song in his honor for their groundbreaking Pills n Thrills & Bellyaches; he later toured with the group as well. Five years later, Donovan released his comeback LP, Sutras, helmed by producer du jour Rick Rubin. (The album had the misfortune to be released after Rubins landmark Johnny Cash record, American Recordings and was virtually ignored or misunderstood by critics.) Donovan toured briefly to support Sutras and then went missing once again, playing out only sporadically. In 2004, however, he reappeared with the intimate and stylish Beat Cafe, a collection of nearly all-original songs produced by keyboardist John Chelew. Donovan also enlisted bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Jim Keltner to round out his quartet. The album featured a pair of covers, a spoken word rendition of poet Dylan Thomas \"Do Not Go Gentle,\" and a startling rendition of the traditional tune \"The Cuckoo.\" Album: 1 of 43\n\nTitle: Colours\n\nReleased: 1965\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 28:14\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify AlbumCover 1 Colours (02:58)\n\n2 To Sing for You (02:14)\n\n3 Car Car (02:46)\n\n4 The Ballad of Geraldine (03:30)\n\n5 Keep on Truckin (02:58)\n\n6 Josie (02:08)\n\n7 Donna Donna (03:01)\n\n8 The War Drags On (03:28)\n\n9 Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness) (02:57)\n\n10 Tangerine Puppet (02:14)\n\nAlbum: 2 of 43\n\nTitle: Whats Bin Did and Whats Bin Hid\n\nReleased: 1965-05-14\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 31:53\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Josie (03:28)\n\n2 Catch the Wind (02:55)\n\n3 Remember the Alamo (03:05)\n\n4 Cuttin Out (02:19)\n\n5 Car Car (01:31)\n\n6 Keep on Truckin (01:50)\n\n7 Goldwatch Blues (02:33)\n\n8 To Sing for You (02:45)\n\n9 Youâre Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond (04:04)\n\n10 Tangerine Puppet (01:52)\n\n11 Donna Donna (02:57)\n\n12 Ramblin Boy (02:33)\n\nWhat's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid : Allmusic album Review : Donovans album debut, Whats Bin Did and Whats Bin Hid, presented his breakout British single \"Catch the Wind\" and added an assortment of pleasant folkie jams. Though he was often derided at the time as a pale imitation of Bob Dylan, there isnt a lot of evidence here; true, he does cover a Woody Guthrie song (\"Car Car Riding in My Car\") and gives it some twang worthy of the master, but his style is his own, slanted toward the mysticism of British folk less than the earthiness of its American cousin. Donovan summons the proper age-old weariness for \"Goldwatch Blues,\" gets a bit bluesy for \"Youre Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond,\" and lets it all hang out for \"Keep on Truckin.\" Album: 3 of 43\n\nTitle: Fairytale\n\nReleased: 1965-10-22\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 36:01\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 Universal Soldier (02:11)\n\n2 To Try for the Sun (03:39)\n\n3 Sunny Goodge Street (02:58)\n\n4 Colours (02:45)\n\n5 Circus of Sour (01:53)\n\n6 The Summer Day Reflection Song (02:13)\n\n7 Candy Man (03:28)\n\n8 Jersey Thursday (02:15)\n\n9 Belated Forgiveness Plea (02:58)\n\n10 Ballad of a Crystal Man (03:54)\n\n11 The Little Tin Soldier (03:03)\n\n12 Ballad of Geraldine (04:40)\n\nFairytale : Allmusic album Review : Donovans second album found the Scottish folkie in possession of his own voice, a style of earnest, occasionally mystical musings indebted neither to Woody Guthrie nor Bob Dylan. True, Fairytales highlights -- \"Sunny Goodge Street,\" \"Jersey Thursday,\" and \"The Summer Day Reflection Song\" -- use a sense of impressionism pioneered by Dylan, but Donovan flipped Dylans weariness on its head. His persona is the wistful hippie poet, continually moving on down the road, but never bitter about the past. The folkie \"Colours,\" already a hit before the albums release, is also here (though without Donovans harmonica). A few of his songs are inconsequential and tossed-off (\"Oh Deed I Do,\" \"Circus of Sour\"), but a few of these (\"Candy Man\" especially) succeed too, thanks to Donovans effervescent delivery.

True, the fey gypsy and flower power sensibility was already present in songs like \"Turquoise\" (which is as gorgeous as it is ridiculous), but the pre-\"Sunshine Superman\" Donovan had a good deal more Woody Guthrie in him than he did Timothy Leary. His work from this period has been compared (usually unfavorably) to Bob Dylan, but the strongest influence at play in these songs is probably Bert Jansch, whose \"Do You Hear Me Now\" is covered here. In the end, the Pye tracks form a complete and distinct cycle in Donovans canon, separate from -- but not necessarily lesser than-his more ornate pop material. There have been several compilations of these early songs issued by various labels, and any of them is probably sufficient to provide a taste of what Donovan was up to at the time. Castle Records has collected all of the Pye sides (including a few alternate takes) in a two-disc set called Summer Day Reflection Songs, and listeners interested in a more complete look at this phase of Donovans career will find it has everything at a decent price. Album: 6 of 43\n\nTitle: Mellow Yellow\n\nReleased: 1967\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 34:03\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Mellow Yellow (03:40)\n\n2 Writer in the Sun (04:28)\n\n3 Sand and Foam (03:19)\n\n4 The Observation (02:21)\n\n5 Bleak City Woman (02:22)\n\n6 House of Jansch (02:42)\n\n7 Young Girl Blues (03:46)\n\n8 Museum (02:54)\n\n9 Hampstead Incident (04:40)\n\n10 Sunny South Kensington (03:49)\n\nMellow Yellow : Allmusic album Review : Mellow Yellow is actually more diverse in its sounds than Sunshine Superman, drawing on some of the same eras better follow-up material but also reaching back somewhat further for repertory. It was, as one could rightly guess, a by-product of the late-1966 hit title track, but the songs dated back in some instances as much as a year, to a point prior to Donovans having made the leap from folk to pop artist. \"Mellow Yellow\" itself was cut after \"Sunshine Superman\" and boasted one of the earliest arrangements by John Paul Jones to achieve international recognition (although not without some resistance from Donovan himself), with its broad, biting brass sound. The next two tracks, however, reached back to the singer-songwriters earlier acoustic/folk songbag, and a very different point in his career -- the reflective, somber \"Writer in the Sun\" was written in Greece during the spring of 1966, when it looked as though Donovans career was in danger of ending due to legal problems. By contrast, the hauntingly beautiful \"Sand and Foam\" dated from a somewhat happier visit to Mexico. \"The Observation\" manages to quote the albums title tune obliquely in its bass-line, even as the singer veers close to a beat-style poetry recital. \"Museum,\" which sounds at times almost like an artier sequel to \"Sunshine Superman\" and a precursor to \"There Is a Mountain\" in its word pattern, breaks up the succession of blues settings on the albums second side, as does the jazz-flavored \"Hampstead Incident.\" The album ends with \"Sunny South Kensington,\" an upbeat number driven by radiant (albeit name-dropping) lyrics, Eric Fords crunchy guitar (emulating his contribution to \"Sunshine Superman\"), Shawn Phillips sitar, and an economical arrangement by John Cameron (who also plays the harpsichord).

Donovan frames his long-ago fairy tales with an appropriately faraway yen to his voice, and the songwriting is influenced more by Lewis Carroll and Childe ballads than Bob Dylan. Theres a pronounced air of sadness to many of these songs, so small children may grow uneasy by \"The Enchanted Gypsy\" or \"Widow With Shawl (A Portrait).\" Donovans childlike sense of humor also comes through, however, including the irresistible closer \"Starfish-On-The-Toast.\" Album: 8 of 43\n\nTitle: Wear Your Love Like Heaven\n\nReleased: 1967-12\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 25:02\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAllmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 Wear Your Love Like Heaven (02:30)\n\n2 Mad Johns Escape (02:23)\n\n3 Skip-a-Long Sam (02:29)\n\n4 Sun (03:20)\n\n5 There Was a Time (02:05)\n\n6 Oh Gosh (01:52)\n\n7 Little Boy in Corduroy (02:37)\n\n8 Under the Greenwood Tree (02:00)\n\n9 The Land of Doesnt Have to Be (02:32)\n\n10 Someone Singing (03:09)\n\nWear Your Love Like Heaven : Allmusic album Review : Separately released in the U.S. as the pop record from 1967s double-LP A Gift From a Flower to a Garden, Wear Your Love Like Heaven stands on its own as one of the brightest, most pleasant works Donovan ever recorded. The title track and \"Oh Gosh\" were the only nods to the charts (and, tellingly, the only songs produced by Mickie Most). For once in Donovans career, the remainders far outshone the singles, with brisk, breezy productions and the thoughtful playing of an actual band behind Donovan -- usually just bass, keyboards, and soft, whisking drums or bongos. Donovans voice is better than ever, playful and unassuming on romps like \"Mad Johns Escape,\" \"Skip-A-Long Sam,\" and \"Oh Gosh,\" while expressive and controlled for the slower material. He also makes evocative folkie nostalgia work much better than it should on \"Sun\" and \"Little Boy in Corduroy,\" helped by the breathy flute playing of Harold McNair.

The music still seems a bit fey, and overall more spacy than the average Moody Blues album of this era, but the sheer range of subjects and influences make this a surprisingly rewarding work. Essentially two albums recorded simultaneously in the summer of 1967, the electric tracks include Jack Bruce among the session players. The acoustic tracks represent an attempt by Donovan to get back to his old sound and depart from the heavily electric singles (\"Sunshine Superman,\" etc.) and albums hed been doing -- it is folkier and bluesier (in an English folk sense) than much of his recent work.

Actually containing his three hits, \"Catch the Wind,\" \"Colours,\" and \"Universal Soldier,\" it was the strongest selection of his material yet assembled on one disc, even if most fans already had these recordings.

On The Hurdy Gurdy Man, his over-ambitious nature and scattershot production sense occasionally sabotaged Donovans songs rather than emphasizing their strengths. (The credits shamelessly list \"Produced by Mickie Most\" and \"A Mickie Most Production,\" right next to each other.) As with the last few LPs, the program began with the hit title track (one of Donovans best singles), a dim, dark song balancing psychedelia with the heavier, earthier rock championed during 1968 by Dylan and the Beatles. Though the next two tracks -- an eerie, trance-like \"Peregrine\" and the endearing acoustic number \"The Entertaining of a Shy Girl\" -- are excellent performances, any sense of mood is soon shattered by a hopelessly overblown music-hall showtune, \"As I Recall It.\" This terrible problem of pacing and song placement continually afflicts The Hurdy Gurdy Man, rendering ineffective many solid songs. As for the writing, Donovan certainly wasnt expanding his songbase; as usual, the album overflowed with playful songs on girls (\"West Indian Lady,\" \"Jennifer Juniper\") and pastoral themes (\"The River Song,\" \"A Sunny Day,\" \"The Sun Is a Very Magic Fellow\"). Most of these featured more inventive, sympathetic accompaniment, combined with Donovans usual spot-on delivery. Despite the great songs and (usually) solid performances, though, The Hurdy Gurdy Man is a very difficult listen.

And, as these songs prove, Donovan and producer Mickie Most could craft irresistible folk-rock and psychedelic pop singles. Some of the sounds and sentiments may sound a little dated, but the productions and the songs -- \"Sunshine Superman,\" \"Jennifer Juniper,\" \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven,\" \"Season of the Witch,\" \"Mellow Yellow,\" \"Hurdy Gurdy Man,\" \"Epistle to Dippy,\" \"There Is a Mountain,\" \"Lalena\" -- have proven to be classics of the era, and this is the best place to get them all on one collection.

The music still seems a bit fey, and overall more spacy than the average Moody Blues album of this era, but the sheer range of subjects and influences make this a surprisingly rewarding work. Essentially two albums recorded simultaneously in the summer of 1967, the electric tracks include Jack Bruce among the session players. The acoustic tracks represent an attempt by Donovan to get back to his old sound and depart from the heavily electric singles (\"Sunshine Superman,\" etc.) and albums hed been doing -- it is folkier and bluesier (in an English folk sense) than much of his recent work.

Stripping down to a Celtic rock format that managed to be hard and direct, yet still folkish, Donovan turned out a series of excellent songs, notably the minor hit \"Riki Tiki Tavi,\" that seemed to show him moving toward a roots-oriented sound of considerable appeal. Unfortunately, he was derailed by record company hassles and perhaps his own burnout, and Open Road turned out to be a sidestep rather than a step forward. Album: 15 of 43\n\nTitle: Donovan P.

One has to give Donovan a lot of credit for attempting a release like HMS Donovan in 1971, although it never came close to charting at the time of its release. The drugged-out hippie era that had spawned trippy folk-based albums such as A Gift from a Flower to a Garden was long past, and acoustic folk recordings were considered passe, yet here was Donovan setting words by Lewis Carroll, Thora Stowell, Ffrida Wolfe, Agnes Grozier Herbertson, Lucy Diamond, Edward Lear, Eugene Field, William Butler Yeats, Natalie Joan, and Thomas Hood, among others, to what were often hauntingly beautiful melodies, mostly strummed on a guitar. Whats more, it just about all works perfectly, once one gets past the tape-effect tricks and other silliness of the opening track, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\" Spawned at a time when the singer/songwriter was about to become a father, the album has a decidedly playful tone, even more so than its obvious predecessor, For Little Ones. Lovely as that record was, there are also long stretches of HMS Donovan that have far prettier melodies, arrangements, and accompaniment, played at more attractive tempos. The playing here, which is mostly just Donovans solo guitar with maybe a string bass and organ, and an unnamed female singer or two backing him on a few tracks, is crisper and more focused (along with the recording), and the tunes are seldom short of gorgeous, whether written by Donovan or simply his arrangements of traditional folk melodies. HMS Donovan marked the singers last venture of this kind, into his mid-/late-60s folk style, or into folk-style childrens songs, and it was the last of his albums to be characterized by whimsy. As a sign of some of the behind-the-scenes tensions that characterized its production, HMS Donovan contains one attempt at a rock track, in the form of \"Homesickness\" -- this failed attempt to emulate such late-60s singles as \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" is the only failed track on the album, and was also the only track here on which Donovans longtime producer Mickie Most had any input. \"Lord of the Dance\" (written by Sydney Carter and utilizing a melody that Americans may know better as \"Simple Gifts\"), \"Queen Mab,\" and \"Celia of the Seals\" are worth the price of admission by themselves.

Although the album was recorded at Morgan Studios in England, its session players were a mix of British and American names including not only locals Peter Frampton, Nicky Hopkins, Danny Thompson, and Ray Cooper, but also a batch of people apparently flown in from Los Angeles, including Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, and Russell Kunkel,. Thus, various former members of Wings and Derek and the Dominos rubbed shoulders with the standard backup staff for James Taylor and other singer/songwriters, as well as some stars in their own right. They came together to support Donovan on a collection of songs in which he ruminated about matters political, religious, and philosophical, starting with the environmentally conscious \"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth.\" The songwriter at times seemed to be bucking himself up against the travails of love and life, often by taking a generalized tone that tended to lead to the capitalized reference to, say, \"the Dignity of Man\" and \"the Dance of Life.\" At times, the music put across such lyrical vagaries, such as \"Yellow Star\" with its reggae beat, and the lyrical \"Sailing Homeward,\" the gentle closing ballad that featured Carole King and Tom Scott. But the light tone and humor that had characterized Donovan at his best was missing, replaced by a forced gaiety amid some dark reflections.

For most onlookers, the passage of time meant that this record should have differed considerably from its predecessor, but no one could have expected what was on Cosmic Wheels, at least on side one -- a suppression of all of the flowing lyricism that had been a hallmark of Donovans previous work. In its place were awkward self-consciously heavy prog rock/hard rock stylings juxtaposed with sound effects, and all woven together in a loud and mostly tuneless and unmemorable first side. Starting with the title track, little of the new-style material worked, and the first six numbers here seem like the musical equivalent of a train wreck in slow motion -- the presence of such notable names as Suzi Quatro and others in the contingent of participating musicians notwithstanding. But the album ended up rescued, or at least partly salvaged, by the acoustic numbers that comprise most of the second side. Overlooking \"The Intergalactic Laxative\" (the less said about the better), the final third of this record is where any value that it did have, for old listeners at least, resided -- the delightful \"Only the Blues\" and the ethereal \"Appearances,\" among the most beautiful recordings of his post-60s career, satisfied longtime fans and could even have earned the artist some new ones, and they keep the record from being a total loss. Fine as they are, they may not be quite worth the effort required to reach them, but their presence comprised the only fully worthwhile moments of what was to be a comeback album -- and as theyre not likely to ever turn up on any compilations, their presence ensures that completists and fans will always have to ponder whether to bother owning Cosmic Wheels or not, as opposed to ignoring it completely.

His next to last album, Cosmic Wheels, had managed to generate sales but its successor, Essence to Essence, marked the tipping point beyond which, because of the seeming datedness of his image, or whatever reason, he was no longer regarded by the public as being terribly important or relevant, or his records programmed by radio stations or ordered by record retailers in quantities resembling his earlier work. All of this is a pity because a fair hearing of 7-Tease reveals an album steeped in disillusionment, yet built upon beautiful melodies and some of the most diverse and appealing sounds and arrangements of his career, and a harder rocking sound than he was usually known for (courtesy of Nashville-based producer Norbert Putnam, whod done something similar for Joan Baez). Listening to it 30 years after the fact is an eerie experience, vividly evoking the feelings of uncertainty surrounding the period in which it was made (and for those too young to know, the early to mid-70s saw the self-destruction and resignation of a U.S. president, crippling oil boycotts affecting daily life in America, and serious political and social strife on every continent except Antarctica) -- all wrapped up in songs that were achingly beautiful, piercing in their directness, and generally as clever as any music of its era. \"Rock and Roll Souljer\" is a rousing opener (and a couldve/shouldve-been single) whose spelling is a perfectly valid hint of its direction -- it comes with a soul chorus, a bracing, all-too-brief sax solo, and a mix of acoustic and electric guitars thats pretty much a harbinger of the whole album, and it almost deliberately gives a nod to \"Universal Soldier\" from the opening of Donovans career. The rest of the album crosses boundaries between folk-based balladry (\"Your Broken Heart,\" \"Ride-a-Mile\"), Dixieland jazz (\"Salvation Stomp\"), personal confessional (\"The Ordinary Family\"), folk-pop (\"Sadness\"), hard electric rock (\"Moon Rok\"), political commentary intermingled with breezy-50s jazz-pop (\"How Silly\"), serious acoustic folk (\"The Great Song of the Sky\"), topical songwriting (\"The Quest\"), and some bittersweet reminiscences (\"The Voice of Protest\"). For all of its lack of success, Donovan later said that he went into 7-Tease the way he approached every album he ever cut, including such unabashed hits as Sunshine Superman and Hurdy Gurdy Man, and he saw no difference in his way of making music or the quality of what he delivered -- and it turns out that he was 100-percent correct; 7-Tease is about as good as any long-play record he ever made, and as fine an album that can be heard from any 60s artist working in the 70s (and that would include John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez et al).

A somewhat more downbeat album than the preceding 7-Tease, interweaving the influences of world music (\"The Mountain,\" a gorgeous reprise/follow-up to \"There Is a Mountain,\" thats worth the price of the album), traces of some lingering idealism (\"Children of the World\"), and romantic balladry \"My Love Is True\" (Love Song),\" interspersed with some bitter reflections on the state of his image and role in the world (\"A Well-Known Has-Been\"). The title song and a handful of others are a bit too introverted for popular consumption, though theyre very successful personal songwriting, dealing with the darker side of the psyche. But the album ends on a delightful high-note with \"The Liberation Rag,\" as upbeat a song as Donovan had generated since \"There Is a Mountain,\" and utilizing an arrangement that deliberately recalls his original, Bob Dylan-influenced sound.

Some of his famous bejeweled sensibility is already apparent in these tracks, but for the most part this is Donovan as a straight folksinger, and he isnt bad at it at all. His work from this period has been compared (usually unfavorably) to Bob Dylan, but the strongest influence at play in these songs is probably Bert Jansch, whose \"Do You Hear Me Now\" is covered here. In the end, the Pye tracks form a complete and distinct cycle in Donovans legacy, separate from -- but not necessarily lesser than -- his more ornate pop material. There have been several compilations of these early songs issued by various labels, including this one from Castle Pulse, and any of them is probably sufficient to provide a taste of what Donovan was up to at the time.

no means a complete retrospective, this two-disc compilation contains a healthy sampling from Donovans first dozen years as a formidable musical figure. His chameleon-like sensibilities not only adapted to, but likewise defined the 60s folk, pop, acid rock and the scene of swingin London. As well as hitting some of the more obvious high points, Donovan -- who personally oversaw the project -- included a couple of unissued demos (\"London Town\"/\"Codine\"), alternate versions (\"Museum\"/\"Superlungs\"/\"Riki Tiki Tavi\") and previously unearthed titles (\"Breezes Of Patchulie\"/\"Age Of Treason\"/\"What The Soul Desires\"). The set charts a chronological examination commencing with a handful of the earthy acoustic demos and sides cut for the Pye (U.K.) /Hickory (U.S.A.) label(s) -- ultimately yielding Catch The Wind (1965) and Fairytale (1965) as well as over a dozen knock-off titles sporting the exact same material. [Note: Enthusiasts looking for a more thorough overview of the nearly three dozen sides documented during this era are encouraged to investigate the two-CD Summer Day Reflection Songs (2000) collection.]. The remainder of the first volume focuses on the fruitful 66 through 67 era that produced a string of hits ranging from the happy hippy anthems \"Sunshine Superman\" and \"Mellow Yellow\" to the decidedly dark and foreboding \"Season Of The Witch\" and the Mod trendy pop art of \"Sunny South Kensington\".\" Also included are a healthy sampling of album tracks. \"The Trip,\" \"Writer In The Sun\" and the \"Tinker And The Crab\" are among the most timeless as his folksier nature resurfaces. The second volume of Troubadour picks up with Donovan at the peak of his popularity with Hurdy Gurdy Man (1968) -- which featured the respective talents of Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (keyboard/orchestral arrangements) and John Bonham (drums). This was followed by the equally impressive line up that included Jeff Beck (guitar), Ron Wood (bass), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards) as well as Jim Gordon (drums) for Barabajagal (1968). Donovan slowed down as the decade came to a close re-emerging with the understated Open Road (1970) and Cosmic Wheels (1970). Again, he surrounded himself with top-shelf talent such as Cozy Powell (drums) and Chris Spedding (guitar). This produced works such as the quaint and bouncy \"Maria Magenta\" and the ethereal \"I Like You\" -- which is reminiscent of the Incredible String Bands choral folk leanings. Among the latter standouts are the unreleased tracks \"Age Of Treason\" and \"What The Soul Desires\" -- both of which were recorded just prior to the Nashville sojourn that resulted in 7-Tease (1974). Until his seminal Epic Recordsdiscs are offered in an expanded and remastered form, Troubadour is as definitive a collection as is available under one title.

With Rubins encouragement and production, Donovan does make an impressive comeback with Sutras, which is reminiscent of his earliest records. Sutras abandons the colorful psychedelic pop of his best-known songs for the spare acoustic folk of his first records, and while Donovans songwriting is a little uneven, the warmth of the performances is charming and welcoming, especially for long-time fans.

Perhaps its because everything here is so quaint, and quaintness is a distinctly adult notion, a close cousin to willful nostalgia, and neither trait is anything that most kids would even bother exploring. Mixing in older songs like \"Mandolin Man and His Secret\" and \"Little Boy in Corduroy\" with a handful of newer pieces (and what must be the 400th version of \"Colours\"), Donovan actually does here what he has really always done, and that is make a pleasant, at times even interesting, album for adults who want to feel like theyre children again. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. Just dont try selling it to the kids, because they undoubtedly wouldnt sit still for it.

His last, the Rick Rubin-produced Sutras was issued in 1993 and was hopelessly misunderstood -- especially coming as it did on the heels of Rubins first collaboration with Johnny Cash. This side, produced by the rootsy yet eclectic John Chelew who has worked with everyone from Richard Thompson to the Blind Boys of Alabama and John Hiatt goes right to the heart of Donovans particular musical esthetic. The title on this set is significant. The instrumentation is spare, with drums by Jim Keltner, acoustic , upright bass by the legendary Danny Thompson, and keyboards by Chelew.Donovan handled the guitar chores. In other words, small combo, cafe style. . . Atmosphere is everything in these songs; they are intimate, rhythm-conscious, tuneful, and lyrically savvy. In addition, theyre inspired by that eternally present, romantically eulogized generation of poets, dope fiends, midnight travelers, and coffeehouse sages, the Beats. The set features 12 new songs; ten of them are Donovan Leitch originals. The covers include a compelling read of the mysterious and traditional \"The Cuckoo,\"and a jazzy spoken word take on Dylan Thomas \"Do Not Go Gentle.\" There are some flashes of the hippy mystic of old here, but mostly, this is a fingerpopping set by Donovan the enigma as well as Donovan the songwriter. Chelew and band do a wonderful job of illustrating this juxtaposition. With this band tight, deeply in the groove at all times, the tunes open up and out as if the group were on the barroom stage, and extended the dancefloor jumping and jiving into the street on a delirious, humid moonlit night of uncontainable joy. \"Poormans Sunshine,\" with its skittering brushed snare drums and a B3 tracking the melody with Thompsons bass pushing the rhythm, jumps out at the listener, as does the title track with Thompson driving the whole engine. \"Yin My Yang\" may have a seemingly ridiculous title, but its not in the context of what this album tries to achieve. Donovan is celebrating the self-referential, \"anything-is-possible\" revelation that fuelled the language and spirit of his heroes of yore, and propelled his own romantic, \"everything-is-love\" aesthetic. The shimmering, dark, Eastern minor-key psychedelic spoken word/sung ditty of \"Two Lovers\" is one of those poems that makes Donovan so unique (think, \"Atlantis\" here). The organic jazzed-up funk of \"The Question\" is one of those crazy moments that makes the whole world open and the body twitch in time. The album ends with the whispering \"Shambala,\" a tender, blissful dirge that is utterly moving and hauntingly beautiful in its optimism and hope. If anything, if albums are \"needed\" anymore, the spirit in this one is. Donovan reminds listeners that possibility and hope are not passÃ©, but as full of chance and wild grace as ever. Welcome back, Donovan; youve been missed.

(Although two of the cuts, \"London Town\" and \"Codine,\" did come out on the Troubadour box set in the early 90s, the other seven were previously unreleased.) Donovan was at this point an acoustic folk musician, and these performances are pretty similar to the folk recordings hed make for official release in 1965, though theyre perhaps a bit more rooted in the traditional side of things. Though Brian Locking accompanies him on bass on \"Crazy Bout a Woman,\" its just Donovan and his acoustic guitar. And good it is, too, his distinctive style of vocal phrasing and accomplished guitar work virtually fully formed, although the material isnt as striking as the songs that lifted him to stardom in the mid-60s.\n\nDonovan would in fact slightly re-do a few of these numbers in the studio later on, with Jesse Fullers \"Keep on Trucking\" appearing on a 1965 release; \"Isle of Sadness\" was remade with the title \"Belated Forgiveness Plea,\" though otherwise the song and performance are quite similar to the later 1965 Pye recording; and \"The Darkness of My Night\" getting retitled \"Breezes of Patchulie\" for his typically ornate mid-60s folk-rock treatment a bit later on, though this version is purely acoustic, and considerably plainer. As for the best items that Donovan wouldnt release in any form on his early Pye recordings, those include a good cover of Ewan MacColls classic \"Dirty Old Town\" and the decent gotta-travel-on-style troubadour folk original \"Freedom Road.\" The sole other original on the set, \"Talkin Pop Star Blues,\" would have given the Donovans-a-Bob Dylan-imitator crowd some additional ammunition had it come out at the time, sounding too close to some of Dylans early talking blues for comfort. On the whole, though, Donovan has much of his original voice in place here, and this is worthy addition to his body of recordings in fine official release-quality sound."
