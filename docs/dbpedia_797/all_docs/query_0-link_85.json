        "text": "A while ago, I came up with the idea of a wand class called the Clairvoyant. At the time I didn’t have a good grasp on how I wanted it to work, but I’ve got it much more fleshed out now, as well as some new ideas.\n\nHere’s what the base class skin would look like, in motion:\n\nWeapon: Wand, Armor: Robe, Ability: Third Eye\n\nMaximum Base Stats:\n\n670 HP, 385 MP, 50 Attack, 25 Defense, 60 Speed, 65 Dexterity, 50 Vitality, 60 Wisdom\n\nAverage at 20:\n\n590 HP, 290 MP, 40 Attack, 0 Defense, 35 Speed, 40 Dexterity, 35 Vitality, 35 Wisdom\n\nStarting Stats:\n\n100 HP, 100 MP, 10 Attack, 0 Defense, 10 Speed, 20 Dexterity, 10 Vitality, 15 Wisdom\n\nThird Eye Ability\n\nBehavior: Using the ability spawns a set number of circular projectiles around your mouse, the distance from the mouse is yet to be determined but most likely they’ll keep an average of 1-1.5 tiles away from your mouse. There is a half-second delay before the projectiles begin to move, and during that half-second they do no damage, but still follow the mouse. They spin in a clockwise rotation, and deal damage any time they pass through an enemy. The most accurate comparison would be the fractured gemstone wakizashi, which is nearly identical in how it spins and damages.\n\nAs you progress in tier, the eye opens more and more. The names are not set in stone.\n\nT0: Blind Eye\n\nA dull, dusty glass eyeball.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 60 | Dmg: 70 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Projectiles: 2 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT1: Waking Eye\n\nAn odd green eyeball. It appears to be sentient.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 65 | Dmg: 100 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Spawn Count: 3 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT2: Questioning Eye\n\nAn odd turquoise eyeball. It seems to be studying you.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 70 | Dmg: 130 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Spawn Count: 3 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT3: Suspecting Eye\n\nA strange eyeball carved out of sapphire. It knows something you don’t.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 80 | Dmg: 160 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Spawn Count: 4 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT4: Wandering Eye\n\nAn eyeball fashioned from amethyst. It’s watching everything you do.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 90 | Dmg: 190 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Spawn Count: 4 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT5: Believing Eye\n\nAn eyeball pulsing with psychic energy. It feels as if it belongs to you.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 100 | Dmg: 220 | Lifetime: 5 seconds | Spawn Count: 5 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\nT6: All-Seeing Eye\n\nA glass eyeball overflowing with power. It speaks to you.\n\nHits multiple enemies, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 120 | Dmg: 250 | Lifetime: 6 seconds | Spawn Count: 5 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\n+2 ATT, +2 VIT\n\nUT: Red World\n\nDrops from: Rock Dragon, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nThe bloodshot eye of an ancient dragon. It vibrates with rage.\n\nHits multiple enemies\n\nMP: 150 | Dmg: 400 | Lifetime: 8 seconds | Spawn Count: 2 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\n+7 ATT, -3 DEF\n\nUT: Sugar Rush\n\nDrops From: Spoiled Creampuff\n\nSugar is bad for you.\n\nHits multiple enemies, ignores enemy def, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 110 | Dmg: 75 | Lifetime: 10 seconds | Spawn Count: 15 | Cooldown: 6 seconds\n\n+5 WIS, +3 DEX, -3 SPD, -5 VIT\n\nUT: Grudging Gaze\n\nThe eye of a creature from deep within the filth. It fills you with disdain.\n\nHits multiple enemies, Slows enemy for 0.5 seconds, self-inflicted daze for 3 seconds\n\nMP: 110 | Dmg: 275 | Lifetime: 6 seconds | Spawn Count: 4 | Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\n+2 Spd, +2 Att\n\nST Set: Glass Rose\n\nWand: Rod of the Bloom\n\nShots: 1 | Damage: 70-90 | RoF: 150% | Range: 8.2 | Projectile Speed: 18 Tiles/Second\n\nA trail of petals, leading her to a wand of crystals fashioned like a rose.\n\n+4 DEX\n\nAbility: Glassy Eye\n\nA distant gaze that pays her no mind as she passes by, as if she’s not there.\n\nHits multiple enemies\n\nMP: 200 | Dmg: 800 | Lifetime: 3 seconds | Spawn Count: 1 | Cooldown: 5 seconds\n\n+4 DEF +3 SPD\n\nRobe: Garden’s Finery\n\nA gown, fit just for her, made by the flowers themselves.\n\n+11 DEF, +5 WIS +7 SPD\n\nRing: Cracked Floral Ring\n\nAnd a ring, missing a piece just like she was.\n\n+60 HP, +40 MP, +6 DEX\n\n2nd Piece Bonus: +5 WIS, +4 DEF\n\n3rd Piece Bonus: +30 MP, +5 ATT, +2 DEF\n\n4th Piece Bonus: +20 HP, +50 MP, +6 SPD, +6 DEX\n\nSubtotal of Bonuses: +20 HP, +80 MP, +5 ATT, +6 DEF, +10 SPD, +10 DEX, +5 WIS\n\nOverall Stat Bonus: Wearing the entire Glass Rose set will grant in total:\n\n+80 HP, +120 MP, +5 ATT, +20 DEF, +20 SPD, +20 DEX, +10 WIS\n\nChangelog for current thread:\n\n~ @Orsome, and @Playcool pointed out this works much more like the crystal waki than the bulwark, which I overlooked since I haven’t gotten a crystal waki yet and seen what it does, that comparison’s been changed.\n\n~ @Orsome pointed out another thing I’d overlooked. I wanted self-daze to be a sort of balance for the DPS the eye would provide, while not actually giving the eye enough damage to compete with the DPS of most wands a player would get around the same tier. The damage has been buffed heavily on all eyes.\n\nChanges from the original design:_\n\n~ Eyes are now “Third Eyes” rather than “Glass Eyes”\n\n~ Eyes no longer have a DoT effect and instead have a set amount of damage for each projectile\n\n~ Eyes have drastically less projectile spawns and reduced durations\n\n~ Tile range removed from eyes, as it was increasing with each individual tier\n\n~ MP Cost slightly reduced for T4-T6\n\n~ ST set added\n\n~ Stat bonuses to UT eyes balanced a bit better\n\n~ Sugar Rush no longer grants berserk, but instead ignores def\n\nNote: This is still not totally finished. I highly welcome and encourage feedback on this, especially in the stats areas, and on the ST’s stats, as they were the hardest part of this."
