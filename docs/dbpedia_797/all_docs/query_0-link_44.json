I had an early album when I was in college in 2002 but only liked a couple songs. Then I heard “Ready to Fall” in 2006 and bought The Sufferer and the Witness because I found it for a really good price. I wasn’t crazy about it at first. Then I got into Appeal to Reason and became a huge Rise Against fan and now love their entire discography. Their 3rd album Siren Song of the Counter-Culture is also very good. Rise Against is so underrated. They are just about to explode in popularity because Appeal to Reason had 4 singles and radio support and they toured nonstop. I am so happy for them because they have worked hard and spread a good message. I have a ton of Rise Against songs on my running playlist, with the most from any album coming from this one.\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n\n“Re-Education (Through Labor)”\n\n“Long Forgotten Sons”"
