        "text": "Having recently been lucky enough to attend two days of Slam Dunk festival yet again, I decided to share to my experiences. Whilst it would be my fifth time at Slam Dunk South in Hatfield, it would be my second time at Slam Dunk Midlands, which this year moved to the NEC, making it the biggest Slam Dunk in history. Surprisingly getting in was relatively easy, as the queues were well manned and moved at an acceptable pace when I entered, although some better sign posting around parking as well as stages would help in the future.\n\nOpening up the main stage was Moose Blood (8). The emo four piece from Canterbury are about to release their second album, Blush, which is the follow up to 2014’s incredible I’ll Keep You In Mind From Time To Time, and are on a fast track to domination of the UK scene if today is anything to go by, and they blew me away despite this being the sixth time I would see them.\n\nBoldly opening with the gorgeous new single “Honey”, the band rattle through favourites such as “Pups”, “Swim Down” and “Boston”, before closing with a crushing rendition of their best song, “Gum”. Gaining the day’s first crowd surfers and a healthy amount of sing-alongs, the band fair well on a big arena stage despite their small yet loyal following.\n\nFollowing a quick drink break (Fiver for a medium bottle of cider, sort it out NEC!), Spunge (7) were taking to the outdoor Desperados Stage. Playing the third of 6 gigs in 72 hours, the band tore through ska party igniters such as “Jump on Demand” and “Roots”, however the undoubted highlight was “Kicking Pigeons In The Park”, a song as stupid as it sounds. Whilst nothing incredible, and lacking the hits of their peers, the band exemplify the fun that should be in all ska music, and their onstage joking and swearing at the nearby trains meant they were worth catching in the sun.\n\nFollowing this up were Hit The Lights (6) over on the day’s dedicated pop-punk stage, who seemed to be having an off day. Forgetting what song they were going to play next a few times, and with a half interested crowd, the real saviour was the strength of the new tracks from last year’s Summer Bones album, with tracks like “Fucked Up Kids” sounding just as good live.\n\nBack over on the main stage, and Mayday Parade (6) put on a perfectly adequate set, but it seemed like the size of the room slightly swallowed the band whole, and the lack of any really well recognised single did nothing to win over and uninterested and half-filled room.\n\nFollowing this was Yellowcard (9), who played all of their Ocean Avenue album for the first ever time (partly due to technical issues limiting their set the day before). Opener “Way Away” kick-started proceedings, where things never really slowed down. “Only One” with it’s towing chorus and soaring violin was an obvious highlight, and prompted the unusual sight of air-violins being played, but it was of course “Ocean Avenue” itself that really stole the show, despite being played so early that it felt a little anti-climactic.\n\nNext up were Mallory Knox (5), who brought their own giant “M K” lights. Unfortunately, the lights proved to be the one effort the band were prepared to exert today. When your entrance music being the Champions League theme song is the highlight of your set, you know something is wrong. With such a strong album in Asymmetry, the band have the songs to really set off a room like this, but they were utterly boring, and it felt like the definition of a “job” for the band, going through the motions. They can be better than this, and they know it.\n\nSub-headlining were New Found Glory (8). With a recently bleached Jordan bouncing around the stage, and the band in top form behind him, they crushed through their set, going from old hits such as the opening “Hit or Miss” and recent material such as “Selfless”. Down front, the crowd were lapping it all up, but I have heard that the sound towards the back of this arena was poor, which is a definite shame. The band even took requests for a song or two from fans, and finished with three straight tracks from their Sticks and Stones album, with “Forget My Name”, “Head On Collision” and smash-hit “My Friends Over You”.\n\nHeadlining that night was of course Panic! At The Disco (7). Opening with recent single “Don’t Threaten Me with a Good Time”, the band were completely solid on stage, with Brendon Urie his usual charismatic self. The new songs went down relatively well, which is good because they formed almost half of the set. In fact, he played almost no songs from any of the first three albums, but when he did, they were of course a huge highlight. “Time to Dance” was early on, as was “The Ballad of Mona Lisa”. Unfortunately, Brendon’s ego was once again the main distraction, as he kicked off their drummer mid-set for a drum solo, before resuming his usual position, sans jacket or shirt. If Brendon could just learn to reign in the spotlight searching a little, and maybe play the hits more, Panic could be a true force, because the songs are there, he just doesn’t want to play many of them.\n\nOver on the pop-punk stage meanwhile, I caught the last half of The Story So Far (8) despite knowing I would see them the next day. A set filled with furious anthems, the only low point was when a technical difficulty left singer Parker Cannon awkwardly filling the dead air with some predator references. A rare outing for “Placeholder” was a massive highlight and the band sent bodies flying for their finale, where they cemented themselves as the best live band in the pop-punk scene.\n\nSo now we are into January, I decided it was time to post the final part of my best of 2015 list. It was at times hard to describe exactly how I feel about some of these albums, especially the album I picked as my number one album of 2015. All five of these, however, are truly great records that you simply must hear, spanning pop, indie rock, emo and more.\n\n5) Carly Rae Jepson – Emotion\n\nJune 23 – Interscope\n\nIf there is any album on this list that truly surprised me, it was Emotion, the new album from Carly Rae Jepson. The “Call Me Maybe” singer ditched her boy-crazy persona for this album, and aside from the single “I Really Like You”, has moved from the bubble-gum pop sound that found her stardom.\n\nOpening with the more recent single “Run Away With Me”, the album starts with one of 2015’s best and most overlooked songs. Saxophone bursts into life, before Carly sings in a tone far more seductive and moody than ever before. The lyrics on this song, and the album in general, still revolve around the topics of love, heartbreak and relationships, but they never devolve into cheesy territory. The album has a huge 80s influence and pulls it off in a way which Taylor Swift’s 1989 could only dream of. From the pulsating electronics, to the glimmering guitar lines, and the pounding bass, this song is one of the catchiest, most-dance-able tunes released all year.\n\nFollowing this, the high points come thick and fast. Next is “Emotion”, which is another hugely impressive track revolving around Carly hoping that her ex realises he made a mistake being without her. “I Really Like You” is the only song here that sounds more like her older “Call Me Maybe” style tracks, yet pulls it off with aplomb. “Gimmie Love” is a more moody track with a darker synth beat, and latest single “Your Type” is a simple yet brilliant tale of unrequited love that builds instrumentally, whilst one of the strongest songs of the entire album is the B-side “I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance”, which as the title suggests is the song that most resembles a club anthem.\n\nThe songs have verses catchier than most songs choruses, and never falls into Swift’s trap on 1989 where she often relied on repetition for hooks, and instead Emotion boasts some of the most impressive vocal melodies of the year. To back these up, Carly gives an impressive and versatile vocal performance, and one that always feels full of personality, and never fake. From the sentimental and delicate “All That”, to the broody “Gimmie Love”, and from the playful happiness of “I Really Like You”, to the carefree swagger of “Boy Problems”.\n\nWhilst there are a few less cheerful tracks on Emotion, most of the record feels like a perfect encapsulation of the start of a relationship and the feelings that come with it, and no album this year has conveyed this feeling more honestly or believably.\n\n4) Frank Turner – Positive Songs For Negative People\n\nAugust 7 – Xtra Mile/Interscope\n\nMixing acoustic folk and punk, Frank Turner has carved himself a niche in the British musical landscape through hard work and non-stop touring. Often topping 250-300 shows a year, Frank’s early years saw him travel as far as America and Russia to play for whoever would listen.\n\nOf course, hard work only gets you so far. Luckily, Frank Turner has also written five of the best British rock records of the 2000s. His second album, Love, Ire & Song, saw him breakout, and many maintain it to be his best to this day. Fourth album England Keep My Bones saw him enter the mainstream, and even open the 2012 Olympic ceremony with a performance watched by over a billion people worldwide, whilst fifth album Tape Deck Heart was a more downbeat affair yet was his most commercially successful album to date.\n\nNow, for his sixth album, Frank has turned the noise up to 11, and in typically punk fashion, has followed his biggest album with his fastest, most abrasive album yet. It’s still catchy, and it’s still immediate, yet most of all, it’s still intelligent. “Josephine”, for example, features a large number of historical references, whilst “Silent Key” bases its story around the crash of the Challenger space shuttle and a broadcast made by Christa McAuliffe, and features guest vocals by Esme Patterson.\n\nFrank Turner has often claimed his albums are reactions to the one that came before it, and this is no exception. Following the downbeat and extra personal Tape Deck Heart, this album centres on living life to its fullest. Highlight “Demons” exemplifies this the best, with its shout-it-out-loud chorus of “At this truth we have arrived: God damn, it’s great to be alive.” It’s simple, it’s effective, and it’s hugely life affirming. Not only is this a great record, but it’s one you can listen to time and again for strength.\n\nIt seems fitting, then, that the final song be one of such utter despair. Similar to “The Ballad of Me and My Friends” from his debut, “Song For Josh” was recorded live at a venue that held huge emotional weight for the song, as it’s where the titular character worked and became close friends with Frank, before sadly committing suicide. The lyrics to this song are easily Frank’s most touching yet, and will certainly never fail to provoke an emotional response from me.\n\nThe second verse in particular, stands out as a lyric that will be all too well understood by anyone who has known a victim of suicide: “Why didn’t you say something on the last time we met? Why didn’t you say something? There’s always hope left. And I can’t say for certain what I would have done, but I can’t do anything now that you’re gone, and it kills me to think that for a second you felt alone.” During the bridge, Frank’s vocals noticeably strain, as he struggles not to break down himself. It’s a magical moment of pure emotion, on possibly one of Frank’s best songs yet.\n\nIt makes sense upon hearing this song, as to why Frank’s new record is about making the most of life. He knows as well as anyone that’s short, and we only get one shot. After losing a friend, Frank just wants to help the rest of realise this too.\n\n3) Death Cab For Cutie – Kintsugi\n\nMarch 31 – Atlantic\n\nThere is an art form from Japan that focuses on the power of healing. It involves taking pottery that has been broken, and using a golden lacquer to repair it, creating a piece of physical art that neither hides from its past, nor its flaws, but embraces and celebrates them for all to see. This art form is called Kintsugi and appropriately, this is also the title of Death Cab for Cutie’s first album in four years and their eighth studio album.\n\nOpening with “No Room In Frame”, Death Cab show exactly why they are one of the most celebrated indie bands of the 21st century. The song builds throughout, whilst singer Ben Gibbard’s lyrics revolve around his divorce from New Girl star Zooey Deschanel. Whilst their last record, Codes&Keys, was a happier affair, this is immediately a more solemn release, as Gibbard sings “And I guess it’s not a failure I could help, and we’ll both go on to get lonely with someone else.”\n\nFourth track “Little Wanderer” is a more cheerful song, discussing a newer relationship with someone whose job also takes them around the world, and despite the talk of dodgy internet connections, the love-struck feeling permeates throughout, and it a rare positive moment in an album that has few.\n\nTracks five and six are the slowest on the album. “You’ve Haunted Me All My Life” is a slow burning track with lyrics that never hides it’s target, as Gibbard lament “You’re the mistress I can’t make a wife.” Track six meanwhile, is a beautiful and desperate acoustic song that sees Gibbard opening by asking his former wife “Darlin’, don’t you understand? That there are no winners?” The track closes as he quietly croons, “My love, why do you run? For my hands hold no guns.” It’s the most stripped back song on the record, and because of this is becomes something that feels truly special.\n\nAfter this, Death Cab understandably raise the tempo with two dancier numbers, the first being “Everything’s A Ceiling”, which in a move reminiscent of heroes The Smiths or The Cure, the upbeat melodies and tempos hide more sad lyrics as Gibbard reflects upon Deschanel moving on with someone new. “Good Help (Is so Hard to Find)” meanwhile, contains guitars that flick in and out of consciousness and a rolling electronic undercurrent throughout, and it’s yet another highlight, one which apes the best parts of 2011s Codes&Keys.\n\nAnother standout is “El Dorado”, an indie rock number that discusses Deschanel’s apparent U-turn in order to star in New Girl. The lyrics contain constant references to Hollywood and the fabled city of gold, as Gibbard states “And I tried to be hyped for you, oh I’m trying to be hyped for you”, to a backing of flourishing guitars and tumbling bass.\n\nIt’s a record that is only surpasses in their catalogue by 2005’s Transatlanticism, and should see them sit atop the pile of indie bands once longer, with their self-given title of “The biggest small band in the world”.\n\n2) The Front Bottoms – Back On Top\n\nSeptember 18 – Fueled By Ramen\n\nFor a band with such a stupid name, The Front Bottoms have become a pretty big deal. Now, signing to Fueled By Ramen (the label that broke Fall Out Boy, Paramore, Panic At The Disco, Fun., and recently Twenty One Pilots) they are being touted as the next big thing, despite being the last band one would anticipate breaking into the mainstream.\n\nPlaying acoustic pop-punk & emo with sarcastic and humorous lyrics, lead singer Brian Sella has a very unique melodic style, and his lyrics can often be touching and funny at the same time. Their third studio album (not including demo albums), Back on Top, is their best yet, and their first fully electric release.\n\nOpening with “Motorcycle”, The Front Bottoms immediately prove they have created easily the most fun album of the entire year, as Sella sings “Sometimes you gotta close your eyes to truly see the light.” It’s the first of a hundred moments, that all make you want to jump up and sing at the top of your lungs, whilst the guitar lead throughout is a swirling vortex, only stopped when the music cuts to a gospel backing, before jumping back in at full speed.\n\nSecond track “Summer Shandy” has a chorus that builds each time around, with Sella at his most infatuated, singing “Yeah that would be great, that would be beach house living, every night, rest of our lives, you and me, we could go swimming.” Following this is single “Cough It Out”, which is one of the summer’s best chilled-out campfire songs. Whilst the chorus sings of being “delusional of love”, the verses tell the tale of a soured friendship, singing “I don’t care if you’re not sorry I forgive you, and with or without your support I will continue.”\n\nTrack four is quite simply the best song TFB have ever wrote. Titled “HELP”, it somehow opens with lyrics about pep talks and teeth brushing, before making the equally ridiculous lyrics “This is what I want, mother fucker make it happen to me” seem like a do-or-die prophecy, with a tongue firmly implanted in Sella’s cheek the whole time. There is not a single melody here, vocally or instrumentally, that isn’t designed to burrow inside your brain and make home there forever, and as a result you will find yourself singing this weeks after you last heard it.\n\nThe Front Bottoms have never hidden their use marijuana either, as Sella sings “Just you and me, getting high and hanging out, getting high and messing around, getting high and trying to figure it out”, before a spoken-word guest spot from New Jersey hip-hop artist GDP ends a more moody track named “Historic Cemetery”, which helps give the album some needed breathing room. “The Plan (Fuck Jobs)” sees Sella at his most whimsical as he sings through laughing, “I fucking hate the comments, why do you feel you have to talk? Nobody asked for your opinion, your sick sad way of jerkin off.” The song is a more groove driven affair that is punctuated by catchy keyboard melodies and punchy riffs, and the odd trombone.\n\nNinth track “2YL” meanwhile, is possibly the second best track here. An all-out rock affair, its lyrics are about young love and sex, even managing a Marvin Gaye reference. The chorus is one of the catchiest of the entire year, with winding guitar lines that swerve into a moment of pure triumph, where they take a nod from The Cure’s “Close To Me” and have the last half of song feature a full brass band that leads the band to new stratospheres.\n\nBack On Top really is an album that should be enjoyed by everyone, with something here for fans of all kinds of rock music, and an upbeat enjoy-life mentality to lift the dark clouds from even the unhappiest of people.\n\n1) Turnover – Peripheral Vision\n\nMay 4 – Run For Cover\n\n“I always remember things better than they were, and miss people more than I should.”\n\nThis quote from singer Austin Getz came in the build up to Turnover’s second album, Peripheral Vision. Perhaps he considered it a throwaway answer, but it’s exactly this feeling of nostalgia and sentimentality that seeps from every pore of this album, and dominates its lyrical narratives.\n\nStarting as a pop-punk band, their debut album Magnolia saw them take in emo and grunge influences and create one of 2013’s best albums. An EP title Blue Dream saw them take more ambient influences, with three songs that were mesmerising, and in the case of “Bella Donna”, incredibly beautiful.\n\nThe evolution has been slow, but it’s been precise. For their second album, Turnover have removed their punk shackles, and instead their sound is a mix of The Cure style indie rock, with Emo and shoegaze influences. The rhythm section is basic but driving, whilst guitars noodle throughout as Austin’s vocals arrive drenched in reverb. It’s all basic from an instrumental perspective, but it combines to create a gorgeous sound that even without the vocals, feels like pure nostalgia.\n\nOpener ‘Cutting My Fingers Off’ is without a doubt one of the bands best ever songs. They create a swirling, hazy atmosphere surrounding 80’s-tinged pop melodies, whilst Getz spins a tale of lost love, singing, “You always said that every thought I had was geometric, I couldn’t think outside my own lines.” The song’s first half resembles a band such as American Football, with its quiet introspection, whilst the second half feels like the best parts of Mineral, and is a truly phenomenal opener.\n\nSecond track and lead single “New Scream” is one the more straight-up pop songs on the record, and perhaps most resembles The Cure. Jangly guitars and a bouncy rhythm front a track about the lust for a more exciting life, as Getz sings “I’m craving that new scream, lusting for more than just old dreams. I’ve been dying to feel alive, and I’ve been wasting all my time.”\n\nFifth track “Dizzy On The Comedown” is another highlight. Every line of the track is weaved expertly into a hypnotic melody that continues throughout. The song tells a tale of infatuation, with Getz singing “Would you come here and spin with me? I’ve been dying to get you dizzy.”\n\nAnother highlight is the reworked version of “I Would Hate You If I Could”, originally a song from a four way split EP. Gone are the grunge elements, and the poppier, cleaner tones suit the song perfectly. It’s a much sadder song that the rest of the record, and is a reflection upon a past relationship, with a reworked outro that places the backing vocals much higher in the mix. In all honesty, every lyrics from this song is brilliant, including the opening verse where Getz laments “I hear you’ve been telling all your friends that you’re done with me, like you always knew things wouldn’t work out. And I’ve been hearing things from people that I don’t want to talk to, like it matters who you’re sleeping with now.”\n\nIt’s an incredibly consistent record, and there really are no songs on the album that are anything less than brilliant. More than that, it’s an incredibly touching record, and one that I personally grew attached to incredibly quickly. The mix of atmospheric instrumentation, perfect for the evenings, and highly relatable lyrics meant that it quickly became my favourite record in about three years. Covering a wide emotional spectrum, Peripheral Vision is an album that somehow always feels suitable. It’s an album that constantly makes me search my own past, and has caused deeper introspection that any album in recent memory. It’s the soundtrack to many of the major events in my life, one that I’ve edited in later in life.\n\nPerhaps the best part of this release is that it’s only the band’s second album. An incredibly consistent band that continually improve and progress, they are confirmed to already be working on new material, likely an EP, due for 2016.\n\nIf they manage to top this however, it could be something very special indeed.\n\nFollowing on from Part I, where I discussed honourable mentions, I shall now run down the places of 6-10 in my end of year album list.\n\n10) The Wombats – Glitterbug\n\nApril 3 – 14th Floor (Warner)\n\nFour years on from their second album, and eight since their debut, no one could accuse The Wombats of rushing releases for the sake of career momentum. In fact, when they released the first single from this album, “Your Body Is A Weapon”, it passed me by completely. It was only after the release of “Greek Tragedy” and “Give Me A Try” in January and February that I was informed of the release, by my co-host of the Humbucker podcast (R.I.P). The songs, though, were better than ever.\n\n“Emoticons” open the album with the perfectly dreamy slide guitars, as singer Matthew Murphy sings “It’s tough to stay objective baby, with your tongue absailing down my neck.” Barely 20 seconds in, and it’s clear that The Wombats have evolved into a dancier, catchier beast. The first five songs in fact could all realistically be called the best songs the band have ever written.\n\n“Give Me A Try” has one of the strongest claims to take that mantle though. The keyboard lead drives the song throughout, as Murphy’s stereotypically lovestruck lyrics capture the moments before a relationship perfectly. The song gathers pace throughout and even features a (sort of) guitar solo.\n\nDevoid of filler, and telling a story that many will relate to, it’s an album that appears to have put them back in the spotlight, performing to big crowds at the Reading & Leeds festivals and getting airtime on national radio. In a year when bands like 5 Seconds of Summer have gotten even bigger, The Wombats wrote the pop-rock album to put them to shame.\n\n9) Modern Baseball – MOBO Presents: The Perfect Cast EP featuring Modern Baseball\n\nOctober 23 – Lame-O Records\n\nI initially didn’t want to include EP’s within this countdown, but with six songs of this quality, I felt the latest Modern Baseball release warranted being included in the list. Following their unbelievable second album, it’s a collection of four songs recorded during the summer, plus two from beforehand, yet somehow it avoids feeling like a random group of songs. Instead it feels like a mini album of songs, that complement each other within the track listing. Opening with “The Waterboy Returns”, the band jump straight into their kooky and direct brand of modern emo and pop-punk mix. Influenced as much by Say Anything as American Football, the band throw unusual song structures and guitar patterns into every track to keep things fresh.\n\nThe highlights are undoubtedly the catchy and bouncy opener, as well as fourth song “The Thrash Particle” and closer “Revenge of the Nameless Ranger”. The former starts as a slow electric ballad before becoming an all-out grunge-tinged rocker, as singer Brendan Lukens sings “You suggested I write a song about the first time we met, well I don’t wanna remember there or then.”\n\nIt’s a moment of naked truth, in an EP that often feel almost like an expose at times, due to the volume of their honesty. Perhaps the biggest of all of these moments comes in the final song, the aforementioned “Revenge Of The Nameless Ranger”. The music dies down and Lukens sings “You’re just not the same as when we met. I don’t know you anymore. Can you take me back to the time when your clothes took up my drawers? Of all the horrid things: your stupid smile; I saw your face when I said ‘why’d you have to go and change, ruin what we made, destroy everything.’”\n\nIt’s a moment that characterises everything great about Modern Baseball, in a band that specialise in creating dozens of moments just like them. With a third album on the horizon, Modern Baseball are a band to watch in 2016.\n\n8) Enter Shikari – The Mindsweep\n\n19 January – PIAS Recordings\n\nAt a time when popular music feels less politically charged than ever, British Electronic Rock mob Enter Shikari have taken up the mantle. 2007’s debut showcased the young band as a combination of post hardcore and trace music, and their evolution ever since has been fascinating. Despite this, the band had in my opinion never created a truly great album, one without a couple of poor songs. They have now.\n\nOpening with a call to arms from singer and ring leader Rou Reynolds, the band state their intentions to take over from Rage Against The Machine and System Of A Down for this generations best political band. Topics range from Britain’s beloved National Health Service & a swipe at U.S. health care (“Anaesthetist”), science vs religion (“Never Let Go Of The Microscope”), racism (“Torn Apart”) and the financial crisis (“Bank of England”).\n\nThe singles showcase the variety on the album well; “The Last Garrison” is an uplifting melodic rocker, “Anaesthetist” has one of the album’s heaviest breakdowns, whilst “Never Let Go Of The Microscope” has large trip-hop influences. The deep cuts are similarly impressive, with “There’s A Price On Your Head” showing Rou doing his best Serj Tankian impression, and “Myopia” featuring lyrics based on Animal Farm.\n\nA band that always take risks, their next album could take them to the stratosphere.\n\n7) Neck Deep – Life’s Not Out To Get You\n\nAugust 14 – Hopeless\n\nIn the height of the summer, Wrexham’s Neck Deep released the year’s best straight-up pop-punk record. Life’s Not Out To Get You is a pop-punk record that looks back the genre’s golden age, mixing the bounce of New Found Glory with the summery pop melodies of Blink-182, and fast pace of The Descendents. It’s a step up from their 2014 record Wishful Thinking, in which Neck Deep followed two fantastically aggressive EP’s with a debut that (aside from a few songs early on) lacked passion, inspiration and punk edge.\n\nOpening with “Citizens of Earth”, Neck Deep make it clear that the pace and aggression is back, in a song that shows their hardcore inspiration. Lead single “Can’t Kick Up The Roots” is the third track and has some guitars that sound a little A Day To Remember influenced, without degenerating into generic breakdowns, whilst ADTR singer Jeremy McKinnon (who produced the record) makes a guest appearance himself on fourth song “Kali Ma”.\n\nTracks five and six are the strongest Neck Deep have written since their second EP. “Gold Steps” is a snotty skate punk anthem that sounds like summer and youthful abandon, and contains some of the bests most positive and life-affirming lyrics yet. Track six meanwhile, “Lime St”, is a more poppy track, that amps up the choruses for a singalong.\n\nThe album isn’t flawless, with track seven (“Serpents”) being a song that should never made it onto the album, however the second half of the album is strong enough to make up for it.\n\nOne of this releases hidden gems is the acoustic balled “December”, and follows older tracks “A Part Of Me” and “Head To The Ground” as further proof that Neck Deep do acoustic songs better than any other band in the genre, and all but confirms this as THE pop-punk record of the year.\n\n6) The Wonder Years – No Closer To Heaven\n\nSeptember 4 – Hopeless\n\nWhen The Wonder Years, one of my favourite pop-punk bands, announced that for their new album they were moving away from their brand of aggressive self-conscious pop-punk and towards a more progressive sound, I was more than excited. I always thought they had the potential to do what Brand New did, and create a truly unique progressive album, and it seemed 2015 would be the year they did this.\n\nIn reality, their 2015 release “No Closer To Heaven” didn’t stray quite this far from their sound, but instead feels like a bridge record, between where they have come from, and where they want to be. Despite this, the bands quality shines throughout. Opener “Cardinals” has one of 2015’s most intense choruses as Dan ‘Soupy’ Campbell shouts “I swear I’ll never you down again.” Later on, “You In January” is the first true love song the band have made, whilst “I Don’t Like Who I Was Then” sounds the most like their older material.\n\nLyrically, Soupy has taken wider inspiration, rather than his normal inward lyrics. “Thanks For The Ride” contains a “what if” discussion about a deceased young woman the band knew, and is one of their most obviously catchy songs to date. “Stained Glass Ceilings” looks at America’s race issues, and featuring a jaw-dropping appearance from Letlive.’s Jason Butler, who adds a mix of cleans and screams on the bridge, and it’s undoubtedly one of the strongest moments on the album.\n\nThe best song though, is the early track “Cigarettes and Saints”, which contains a gorgeous opening, and features Soupy reflecting on the death and funeral of a friend, and moves onto talk about the prescription drug service. The song contains some beautiful imagery, and is without a doubt one of the best songs The Wonder Years have ever wrote, with Soupy’s spectacularly emotive vocals quivering like a feather in the wind as he sings “I lit you a candle in every cathedral across Europe. I hope you know you’re still my patron saint.”\n\nAlthough it’s not as good as The Upsides, The Greatest Generation, or their magnum opus Suburbia, I Gave You All And Now I’m Nothing, not many albums are, and No Closer To Heaven is a great album in it’s own right. Filled with huge choruses, emotional moments and crushing guitars. It only makes you wonder what the band will accomplish next time with their new found direction.\n\nIt’s December, and that means music nerds everywhere are busy compiling their “End of Year” List.\n\nI will be doing the same, with a run-down of my top ten coming as the month progresses. For now though, I will look at the albums that missed out, but deserve a mention for being very good releases in their own right.\n\nThese are in alphabetical order, rather than by preference.\n\nCHVRCHES – Every Open Eye\n\nSeptember 25, 2015 – Glassnote Entertainment (Virgin)\n\nIn 2013, CHVRCHES’ debut album “The Bones of What You Believe” made them one the world’s hottest new bands. Their take on 80’s synthpop saw them on a meteoric rise, which led to high hopes for their second album, “Every Open Eye”. The record, however, fully lives up to these hopes. It has not a single bad song, and opens with lead single “Never Ending Circles”, a track that features verses catchier than most pop choruses. “Clearest Blue” is one of the moredancey songs on the album, and final track “Afterglow” is a slow-burning ballad that proves CHVRCHES has multiple strings to their bow.\n\nCity And Colour – If I Should Leave Before You\n\nOctober 9, 2015 – Dine Alone\n\n“The Hurry And The Harm”, the fourth album by City And Colour, the name for Dallas Green’s non-Alexisonfire project, was one of 2013’s most disappointing releases. Following this, it would have been easy for Green to simply write a record similar to his older releases, or something radio friendly and immediate. He did neither. Opening with the 9-minute-plus “Woman”, City and Colour use the first track as a mission statement, they will continue to experiment, and forge their own path.\n\nIt’s not as raw as “Sometimes”, or “Little Hell”, but its new sound, a full band country/rock hybrid, keeps things fresh, and the variation of songs through-out the album hold the attention, despite a hefty runtime.\n\nCloakroom – Further Out\n\nJanuary 16, 2015 – Run For Cover\n\nNamed “Further Out”, Cloakroom’s latest full-length is exactly that. Recorded entirely analog, and partially in forests, caves, and wells as well as the usual studios, the trio from Indiana have created a hugely loud and buzzing record that blends shoegaze, emo and stoner rock. Seven minute opener “Paperweight” is a huge highlight, whilst lead single “Starchild Skull” is one of the most immediate songs on the record. In fact, almost every song is a hightlight; “Moon Funeral” throws more droney influences into the mix, “Lossed Over” is another song that showcases the bands ability to write catchy choruses, whilst the almost-seven-minute closer “Deep Sea Station” adds in electronics, to vary the sound even more.\n\nThis album’s strength lies in being different, from a feedback-laden solo to it’s low-in-the-mix vocals. It’s not flawless, but it’s definitely interesting.\n\nDaisyhead – The Smallest Light\n\nMarch 3, 2015 – No Sleep\n\nThe next in a long line of bands creating a new blend of emo and grunge, Daisyhead’s debut record was as consistent as it is possible to be, throwing heavy yet emotive songs at the listener one after another. Opening with “Defencelessness” and “Lacking Basis”, it starts fast and heavy, and features a great guest vocal appearance from Transit’s Joe Boynton in an early highlight.\n\nThe strongest track is arguably the title track where vocalist/bassist Zach Chiarizzio really opens his lungs during the chorus, as he sings “Your voice in my head, blurring my vision and distorting my hearing.” Another highlight is “Lost Her”, which is written from the perspective of a doctor or nurse, informing a family about the death of a loved one, which is a truly unique perspective.\n\nA great debut, from a band whose blend of emotion, melody, darkness and unique lyrical ideas could take them on to greatness.\n\nFoxing – Dealer\n\nOctober 30, 2015 – Triple Crown\n\nFollowing their incredible debut, Albatross, post-rock band Foxing are back with their second record, Dealer. First track “Weave” sets the tone, as Connor Murphy sings of self doubt, “Selling out an old soul for sales, I am caught up in the guilt, making a living off of drowning.” It’s a unique take on being a lyricist, and it’s the kind of pessimistic world-weary tone that continues through an album that takes on the themes of sex in religion, and bassist Joshua Coll’s experiences in the US Army and later remorse.\n\nAn album drenched in sorrow, with twinkling guitars and orchestral moments, this is perfect for dark winter nights.\n\nFuneral For A Friend – Chapter and Verse\n\nJanuary 16, 2015 – Distiller\n\nWelsh post-hardcore legends Funeral For A Friend released their final album back in January, and it continued their hot streak. A band that never releases a bad album, FFAF have now released three in a row that stand up amongst the best in the genre. Whilst this one doesn’t quite compete with their debut “Casually Dressed”, follow up “Hours” or 2011’s “Welcome Home Armageddon”, it contains some of the band’s best songs in years. “1%” is their best song in four years, and showcases the bands more politicised lyrics. Tackling everything from sexism (“Equality”), misogyny in the punk scene (“You Should Be Ashamed of Yourself”), the banking crisis (“1%”) and more.\n\nEnding with “The Jade Tree Years Were The Best”, FFAF end on their strongest front, emotionally charged melodic post-hardcore. As someone who has seen them live many, many times, I’m going to miss them.\n\nHit The Lights – Summer Bones\n\nMarch 24 – Pure Noise\n\nBack in March, Hit The Lights released what I was sure would be the summer’s biggest pop-punk album. Sadly, it was missed by many, but it shouldn’t have been. Filled with hooks, past paced songs and faux-breakdowns, this is an album that embodies summer, yet contains enough punch to satisfy fans of the rockier side of the genre.\n\nOpener “Fucked Up Kids” has a cliché title, but it one of the catchiest pop-punk songs of the year, whilst “Life On The Bottom” ramps up the pace to fit it’s boxer-documentary video. “The Real” and “Revolutions and Executions” meanwhile show a harder edge with metallic riffs and bouncing bass without ditching the vocal hooks. The highlight is definitely the title track, though, which is a little more melodic, but sounds like a distilled campfire singalong, and is a slightly less obvious take on the stereotypical pop punk hometown nostalgia.\n\nJustin Bieber – Purpose\n\nNovember 13, 2015 – Def Jam\n\nSaying that you like “just one” Bieber record is a bit saying you “occasionally partake” in cannibalism; It doesn’t really make it any more socially acceptable. That, however, doesn’t detract from the fact that in 2015, Justin Bieber has reinvented himself as a genuinely good pop star, following in the veins of Justin Timberlake in making pop songs with just the right amount of hip-hop influences to at once sound interesting and accessible.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bieber is currently first, third and fourth in the UK singles chart, and the singles alone showcase the variety in the album. “Sorry” is a club-ready dance song, with highly introspective lyrics, whilst “What Do You Mean” is a more minimalist yet catchy pop song featuring some nice “ticking” samples through-out. “No Pressure” features Big Sean being… Big Sean, whilst “Love Yourself” is written with Ed Sheeran (who provides backing vocals), and is a barbing acoustic ballad written about a former lover.\n\nAll of this point to one thing: It’s no longer cool to hate Bieber.\n\nKendrick Lamar – To Pimp A Butterfly\n\nMarch 15, 2015 – Top Dawg, Aftermath & Interscope\n\nAn album as great as it is important, this is an album that was as daring musically as it was lyrically. Its jazzy approach to rap instrumentation was refreshing, with the use of real instruments instead of electronic “beats” a real selling point, resulting in a sound that genuinely refreshing. The themes touched upon lyrically meanwhile, range from self harm to white treatment of black culture and back to black on black violence.\n\nThe albums highlights are surely “King Kunta” and “The Blacker The Berry”. The former is a bass groove driven funk-inspired that discusses rappers not writing their own bars, and is at once fun and direct in its aim. The latter, meanwhile, shows Lamar stating his pride in black culture, and his refusal to back down to racism and belittling of blacks in wider culture. It’s at once funny, sassy and violent.\n\nBy no means an easy listen, it’s a pummelling and rewarding album that is deeper than many detractors would have you believe.\n\nMotion City Soundtrack – Panic Stations\n\nSeptember 18, 2015 – Epitaph\n\nAs Motion City Soundtrack are my favourite band of all time, I was naturally incredibly excited for this. Whilst it doesn’t live up to their previous high standards, it’s a solid release with a few really great songs sprinkled through-out. It was never going to compare to “Commit This To Memory” or “Even If It Kills Me”, but it’s a fun record that adds something new to their arsenal.\n\nLess focused on the lyrics for the most part (and probably a good job considering they’re incredibly hit and miss), this album is more about fun, and is mastered in a way that places the synth top of the pile which can at times mean the album can sound like a Mario soundtrack on acid. Songs like “I Can Feel You”, “Broken Arrow” and “Days Will Run Away” are great additions to their setlist, but it lets itself down with songs such as “Lose Control”. Nevertheless, it’s a solid album from a great band.\n\nSeaway – Colour Blind\n\nOctober 23, 2015 – Pure Noise\n\nIn May I went to two days of Slam Dunk festival, and took a chance on day one in Hatfield to see Seaway, a band I barely knew. They blew me and a friend away so much that we learned the songs overnight and saw them again on day two. Now releasing their second album, Colour Blind, Seaway are going to the next level.\n\nIt’s an album that sounds like a mix of Neck Deep and Modern Baseball and the highlights are thick and fast. “Slam” opens the album quietly, before crashing into focus with a typically ironic cry of “Everything is cool, man.” Lead single “Best Mistake” is a straight up pop-punk anthem, whilst “Airhead” is the best song on the album, with its youthful love-struck lyrics.\n\nIt’s certainly not revolutionary, but it’s a lot of fun.\n\nSorority Noise – Joy, Departed\n\nJune 16, 2015 – Top Shelf\n\nIn my top two in July, this album slipped down as I found myself listening less and less, however when I do I remember why I loved it so much. Opener “Blissth” is gorgeous, opening with some great vocals from Cameron Boucher, who sings “Let me be the drug that you use to fall in love, the heroin that keeps you warm enough.” Meanwhile “Nolsey” is a groovy emo tune that relies more on catchy riff than catchy vocals.\n\nThe lyrics are at once purposefully vague yet deeply personal, and as a result are highly relatable, without being overly so. A great record from start to finish, that may be a little too unusual/hard to get into for some pop-punk and emo fans, but it’s well worth the effort. Fans of Weezer’s unusual song arrangements will be at home, as will fans of bands such as Modern Baseball who will enjoy the more emotive lyrics.\n\nThe Story So Far – The Story So Far\n\nMay 19, 2015 – Pure Noise\n\nFollowing two incredible albums, The Story So Far give a solid, if samey, self-titled third album. The songs are still there, with “Solo” in particular being one of their best yet, however there’s little to no growth. The lyrics are a mix of the introspection of 2013’s What You Don’t See and the outward aggressiveness of their debut, Under Soil And Dirt, and seems more direct than in the past.\n\nThe acoustic EP and the song Clairvoyant hinted at something different to come from the band and, despite this being a great record, it felt a little disappointing when compared with what could have been. Parker Cannon’s vocals are on form once more, and the band never really relent aside from the breather that is “Ghost”, creating an album that will be adored by fans, but won’t win over any doubters.\n\nWhen earlier this year an Absolutepunk thread resulted in the website ranking and polling their users for the top albums released since 2000, I noticed that sitting at number 9, two places above my favourite album of all time, was a release I had never heard even a second of, despite being the websites “best album of 2012”, when I was a keen user.\n\nIt was by a band called The Menzingers, and named “On The Impossible Past”. I decided to give it a go and thanks to Apple Music, it was easy to do. Within seconds, I had goose bumps. Opening with “Good Things”, the albums first lines are simple; “I’ve been having a horrible time, pulling myself together.” It struck a chord, and when the tempo ups, and the abrasiveness enters the fray just under two minutes in, I was an immediate fan. No album had hooked me quite so quickly in a long time.\n\nIt wasn’t just the first song either. The meta opening lyrics of second track “Burn After Writing” and the “I will fuck this up” refrain from “The Obituaries” are just two examples of times in the next two songs that made we want to scream at the top of my lungs.\n\nPerhaps my favourite aspect of this album however, is the story telling that takes place throughout it. It tells a rough story of a man recovering from the end of a relationship with a waitress, and is open to interpretation on many levels. Despite its primary focus, it often strays from the bigger picture to look at specific scenarios, using them to make its points about drugs, death, and alcohol/drink driving.\n\nFourth song “Gates” is a track that reminds me of The Gaslight Anthem at their absolute best, and contains a level of American storytelling that would fit in alongside Springsteen. The chorus is anthemic, despite being downbeat, as they sing “So I’m marching up to your gates today to throw my lonely soul away, ’cause I don’t need it, you can take it back.” It’s less aggressive than the songs that precede it, but it makes up for it in sheer emotional weight.\n\nIn the mid-section of the album, “Mexican Guitars” is a definite highlight, and taps into the need for escapism. The bridge contains the lyrics “everything that’s happened has left me a total wreck and everything that I do now is meaningless, so I’m off to wander around the world for a little bit, without one hundred channels and nothing on the TV.” It’s a sentiment that is wrapped within the story and made to feel at once relatable yet highly personal, something the album manages to walk the tightrope between throughout its run time.\n\nThe best song on the album, though, is towards the back. Track 11 out of 13 is named “Casey”. Similarly to “Gates”, it is a little more restrained, but punches above its weight emotionally. It’s not a mistake that this song features the vocalists straining between singing and almost screaming, in a way that doesn’t feel forced or clichéd, but emotional and raw.\n\nThe bridge of this song is one the albums finest moments, as it builds and builds to a gigantic climax, as the vocalist sings “So Casey just tell me when you’re ready, I’m all packed to go, on a search for that old place we found forever ago. We could take my car. Yes, she’s still got the spirit. We could live. We could live. We could live, and no longer just have to hear it.”\n\nIt’s an album littered with such moments, from the aforementioned bridges of “Casey” and “Mexican Guitars”, to the moment in “Gates” when the music dies, and Tom sings “…You get old enough to know that happiness is just a moment.” Almost every song has at least one moment like that, a moment that will connect with you, or simply feel overwhelmingly powerful.\n\nThis record somehow feels at once like intense introspection, romantic nostalgia, and a call to live in the moment. It’s a record without a single poor song, where every single line has a purpose, and further builds up the story of the record.\n\nThe melodies found throughout are unique and interesting, despite saying the opposite during “Burn After Writing”, and it contains a variety of punky, melancholic and wistful songs that are bound to strike a chord with many.\n\nThey followed this record with “Rented World”, an album that while not quite an ambitious as “On The Impossible Past”, was an incredible record in its own right. Very few bands have two records as great as these, but in “On The Impossible Past”, The Menzingers have a record that stands head and shoulders above almost anything else their peers have created.\n\nThis month sees the one year anniversary of one of my favourite albums of 2014. Not only was it an album I thoroughly enjoyed, but it was an album I couldn’t help but feel emotionally invested in.\n\nPianos Become The Teeth started as an aggressive post-hardcore band, with their style punctuated by break-neck drumming and animalistic screaming, and whilst the band always tackled difficult subject matters, their 2011 album “The Lack Long After” is where this all started to change. Post-rock influences became apparent and the lyrics took more focus.\n\nPerhaps then it shouldn’t have been such a surprise then, when in 2014 Pianos released their third album, “Keep You”.\n\nIn a move that initially seemed to split the fan base, gone were the intensely emotional screams, as were the fast drumming and riffs. In their place were intricately picked guitar, and haunting vocals. No instrument tries to grab your attention individually, but instead they work in harmony to create an atmosphere unlike anything the band has done before. Aping the cover art, the album swirls around you and relies more on “feeling” than technical prowess.\n\nDespite my praise of the instrumentation however, that’s only part of the reason for my adoration for this record. The rest of that lies with the lyrical content and the stories told throughout the record, which centres on the grief of singer Kyle Durfey, whose father died several years ago. Whereas before the grief was manifested in a hugely aggressive way, “Keep You” feels like the end of grief; Sorrow, mourning and acceptance.\n\nIt’s the smallest details that really flesh out the stories and really give the album a deeply personal touch, and it’s a testament to how much Durfey has grown as a lyricist that he pulls off an album of such emotional gravity so well. Second track “April” has Durfey find a mug his father owned with a date engraved into it, and realises he doesn’t know the reason, whilst “Repine” finds him tackling his own mortality, as well as a desire to keep his late father’s memory alive, repeating “your wick won’t burn away.”\n\nPerhaps the strongest songs lyrically are tracks six and seven. Track six is “Late Lives”, and sees Durfey reflecting on the way his father died, as well as his personality. “Gone little too soon, but I know you hated being late, and I guess you arrived right on time, and I’m still here, still on this side of the grass, but lately I’m feeling halfway there.” Little moments like these are littered throughout the album, and are moments of pure genuine grief, something that will instantly connect with anyone having lost someone close to them.\n\nTrack seven is titled “Enamor Me”, and focuses on the resting place of Durfey’s father, with Durfey proclaiming “I don’t feel any closer to you here.” Soon after he confesses “I had a thought to make a charcoal trace of your grave and hang it on my wall, merely for the sake of being sentimental of another time, another place, another life.” It’s a naked confession that shows him at his most vulnerable, confessing to the sort of things many people do, but rarely admit to.\n\nMuch was made of the abandonment of screamed vocals, but they remain in one track, the closer “Say Nothing”. The song itself appears to act as a tale of acceptance, and reaches a climax, as for the only time in the album, Durfey passionately screams “So let’s say nothing some more.” After a brief but intense passage however, the last minute of the album returns to its more serene sound. The anger is unleashed, and then leaves as quick as it came, avoiding what may have been an overly obvious end to the album.\n\nDespite the morose lyrics on the album, the melodies remain somehow catchy, and manage to tread a fine line between being memorable and overly sugary. The only song that truly taps into this pop influence is bonus track “Dancing”, which is a great song that was rightly left off the track listing, as it’s fast yet poppy melodies, as well as lyrical content, separate it from the rest of the tracks here. In fact, it’s a testament to the strength of the album that three tracks as strong as “895”, “Dancing” and “Arizona” are relegated to B sides.\n\nAs for why this album connected with me, it’s hard to say. I’ve never lost a parent and as such I cannot quite connect to the grief in quite such a strong way, however every time I listen to it, it certainly stirs something within me. Perhaps it’s the knowledge that one day, I sadly will be able to relate to it. For that reason, I know it’s an album I’ll almost certainly come back to, hopefully a long time into the future, and one that be there for me when I need it."
