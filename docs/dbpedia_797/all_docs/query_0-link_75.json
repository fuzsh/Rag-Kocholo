        "text": "For alternate versions of Grant Ward, see Grant Ward's Character Hub\n\nGrant Douglas Ward[4] was one of the leaders of HYDRA and the most personal adversary of Phil Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. A former HYDRA infiltrator in S.H.I.E.L.D., disguised as a Level 7 operative, he was abused as a child by his family. As a teenager, he tried to burn down his family home. Ward was imprisoned until he was freed by John Garrett, who trained Ward to become a cold-blooded killer. Ward eventually became more loyal to him than to HYDRA. As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Ward was recruited onto Coulson's Team, working with them on all their missions, pretending to be gruff and anti-social. However, in time, he became emotionally attached to the team.\n\nDuring the HYDRA Uprising, he killed Victoria Hand but still maintained his cover as a loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. He broke cover on John Garrett's orders and rejoined HYDRA. Despite harboring feelings for Skye, he followed all of Garrett's orders. When Garrett's HYDRA cell lost at the Battle at Cybertek, he was imprisoned by Coulson. Ward managed to escape many months later and rejoined HYDRA under Daniel Whitehall. However, he left the organization again after Whitehall's death along with Kara Palamas. They started a path in order to close their wounds and move forward that culminated in kidnapping Bobbi Morse, whom they considered responsible for Palamas' brainwashing.\n\nWard ended up accidentally killing Palamas, and he rejoined the remnants of HYDRA, deciding to rebuild the organization and become its new leader. His quest brought him in conflict with Gideon Malick, one of the last heads of HYDRA's old guard, but eventually, they made an alliance to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. and fulfill HYDRA's oldest goal: the return of Hive to Earth. While on Maveth, he was finally killed by Phil Coulson, but his corpse was taken as a vessel by Hive and brought back to Earth.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nAbusive Childhood[]\n\nGrant Douglas Ward grew up in Massachusetts, with two brothers, Christian Ward being the elder, and Thomas Ward being the younger, where they all had difficult childhoods. Ward's eldest brother would frequently force Ward to beat up his younger brother, while his parents were even worse, with Ward suffering abuse from both his mother and father. Ward also had a sister with whom he eventually lost contact with.[4] These beatings could be suffered for any minor reason, including when Ward had taken a slice of Christian's birthday cake, and was brutally beaten for it.[5]\n\nThe Well Incident[]\n\nAn incident in particular that had a profound effect on Ward was when Christian Ward threw Thomas Ward into a well and would not allow Ward to rescue him. As Thomas desperately cried out for Ward to save him before he drowned, Christian warned him not to throw him the rope, or he would be thrown into the well with him. Ward eventually managed to pull Thomas up to safety without his brother knowing, however, this event had caused Ward to feel true hatred towards Christian, as well as his mother and father for the first time.[6]\n\nAttack on Christian Ward[]\n\nIn 1999, Ward went AWOL from the military academy to which he had been sent, stole a car, drove over a thousand miles home, and set fire to his parents' home in a furious rage. Unknown to Ward, his older brother Christian was inside and came close to burning to death in the fire. Christian survived but had Ward arrested by the police and pushed for the courts to try Grant as an adult to get the maximum punishment against him.[7]\n\nHYDRA Recruit[]\n\nFreed by John Garrett[]\n\nWhile being detained inside a Juvenile Detention Center in Plymouth, Ward was unexpectedly called for a visit, as he was surprised to be greeted by a man who introduced himself as John Garrett. Garrett explained that the quarter master at Ward's military school was an old friend of his, who had told him about Ward's skills in training before going on the run, stealing a car before attempting to burn his family home to the ground, with Garrett claiming that this history had intrigued him.\n\nAs they sat down together, Ward was asked by Garrett if he had known that Christian Ward was in the house when he set it on fire, which Ward denied. Garrett told Ward that he had also been a pyromaniac as a child, which he made into a career. Garrett then explained that he had come there to make Ward a one-time offer, explaining that his family's lawyer would be arriving in twenty minutes, as his family would be putting charges against him for arson and attempted murder, but Christian was also petitioning for him to be tried as an adult, to get the maximum sentence.\n\nGarrett suggested that Ward could spend the next twenty years in prison, blaming his mother and father for his situation, or he could allow Garrett to set him free and teach him how to be a man. As Ward remained silent, Garrett explained that he worked for a secret organization that was looking to recruit men like him. Remaining unsure of Garrett's intentions, Ward had then questioned why he should trust Garrett, to which Garrett insisted that he should never trust anyone again, especially not him, much to Ward's surprise.\n\nWith Ward still unsure, Garrett explained that if he went with him, it would be the hardest thing he ever had to do, but he promised that if he did, then nobody would ever attempt to screw with him ever again. Garrett told Ward to say yes, once again promising that it would be hard, but fun, before giving Ward ten more seconds to make a decision before he walked away. Finally, Ward said yes to Garrett's offer, and he was immediately interrupted by armed guards bursting into the room and demanding that everybody get down, as the shocked Ward looked to Garrett, who commented that he promised it would be fun.[7]\n\nJohn Garrett's Test[]\n\nHaving been freed from the Juvenile Detention Center, Ward was then taken to Wyoming by John Garrett, as he joined him hunting ducks. As they walked back, Garrett also commented that he intended to retire there someday, noting that he had land which had already been paid for. However, Ward had remained silent, before questioning if the police found them, to which Garrett insisted that nobody was looking for him, noting that Ward's family would be happier to never see him again.\n\nWith Garrett noting that the police would prefer to stay out of the way of S.H.I.E.L.D., Ward questioned if the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy was close by. However, Garrett had then noted that Ward's priority should be to figure out what he was going to eat that evening, to which Ward noted that he thought they would eat the ducks, only for Garrett to insist that only he would eat the ducks as he killed them, whereas Ward would go hungry. Garrett told Ward that if he wanted something from that point on, he would have to earn it himself, before then throwing Ward his bag.\n\nAs Garrett told Ward to build his shelter and find his own food, Ward was horrified, insisting that he did not have any equipment for this, noting that this was not fair on him, as he would have brought tools and food if he had known that he would have to live in the woods. However, Garrett then demanded to Ward stop whining about his problems, suggesting that if he wanted an easy life he could return to the Detention Centre, which would confirm that Ward was weak and worthless. Garrett had then explained that he would leave Ward and Buddy alone there for two months before he would return.\n\nAs he got into his truck, Garrett noting that believed that Ward would be able to get through this, before driving away. Upset and frustrated that he was being abandoned, Ward threw his bag onto the ground while Garrett drove away. Although Garrett had promised to return within a couple of months, but Ward and Buddy were instead left alone for six months. Although Ward suffered during those first few weeks due to the loneliness and the heavy rain, he had managed to raid nearby cabins, build his own camp and survive with ease.[7]\n\nProving His Worth[]\n\nHaving established his own camp, Ward continued to live out in the woods of Wyoming for six months, with only Buddy as his companion. One day, Ward caught sight of John Garrett arriving at the camp, as Ward snuck up on Garrett and aimed a shotgun at the back of his head. Ward questioned why he should not blow Garrett's head off, to which Garrett simply noted that he had brought tacos for them, while also noting that he had half expected Ward to have been long gone from these woods.\n\nHowever, Ward furiously noted that he expected to never see Garrett again, noting that he had been gone four months longer than promised, to which Garrett explained that S.H.I.E.L.D. had sent him out of the country on assignment. As Garrett noted that Ward and Buddy had done okay, Ward explained how he had survived by raiding cabins for tools and a tent, making his life out in the woods easier for him and Buddy, noting how he intended to build a cabin. Garrett complimented Ward, noting that he had stepped up in a big way, insisting that he could not be prouder of Ward if he was his own son.\n\nHowever, Garrett then turned around and aimed a revolver at Ward's chest, much to his shock, with Garrett noting that he had lied about the tacos, having kept the gun hidden inside of the bag. As Ward questioned what the gun was for, Garrett noted that this was actually for his next lesson, before then turning around and shooting various items around Ward's camp with remarkable accuracy, to Ward's surprise. Garrett had then handed Ward the revolver, telling him to stick by his side, as he would train Ward to be able to shoot with even more skill than that.[7]\n\nLearning About HYDRA[]\n\nFor five years, John Garrett subjected Ward to a number of grueling survival tests in the Wyoming wilderness, eventually molding him into a cold, driven survivalist with the skills he needed. While eating in their campsite, Ward had given some food to Buddy, with Garrett questioning if Ward was aware that Buddy was still just a dog, to which Ward insisted that Buddy was better than any human, due to his smarts, loyalty and trustworthiness, only for Garrett to question where being loyal would lead.\n\nGarrett noted that loyal dogs would be abandoned in the woods or dumped in a pound, noting that he had learnt that lesson the hard way, before knocking on his own cybernetic implants. Despite Ward not saying anything, Garrett noted that he must be curious about his implants, and explained that he had been struck by an IED while outside Sarajevo. Ward listened as Garrett explained that he had called for an evacuation, he was refused by S.H.I.E.L.D., explaining that he realized in that moment that he was more loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. than they were to him.\n\nWard said nothing as Garrett explained that he barely survived the ordeal, and had sworn to himself that he would treat S.H.I.E.L.D. like they had treated him. Garrett then reminded Ward of their first meeting at the Juvenile Detention Center in Plymouth, where he told him that he worked for a secret organization, as he explained that he actually worked for an organization within that organization, asking if Ward knew HYDRA, which he denied, as Garrett explained to Ward that HYDRA understood the importance of survival.[7]\n\nFinal Test[]\n\nHaving been trained by him for so long, Ward followed John Garrett's orders without question or hesitation, so he agreed without question to join HYDRA and continue serving from within S.H.I.E.L.D.. They continued Ward's weapons training as they went out to hunt deer at the incredible range, with Garrett explaining that he had some news. Ward requested that he wait until after he take the shot, and then fired, killing the deer. He sent Buddy out to collect the corpse.\n\nOnce Buddy had gone to get the deer, Ward asked what Garrett had wanted to tell him, to which Garrett explained that Ward had been accepted by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s operations division, which he would be departing for immediately. As Ward excitedly attempted to thank Garrett for everything that he had done for him, Garrett insisted that he did not owe him anything, insisting that Ward had achieved this on his own. Garrett had then explained that working for HYDRA within S.H.I.E.L.D. would be tough for him, as he could not get attached to anyone or anything.\n\nGarrett explained that Ward would have to fight that weakness within himself, which Ward agreed to without question. However, as Garrett walked away, he casually ordered Ward to kill Buddy before they departed, much to Ward's considerable shock. Garrett questioned if this was a weakness for Ward, which he denied, leaving Ward to kill he companion for six years. With Garrett gone, Ward aimed his revolver at Buddy, but could not bring himself to kill him, shooting in the sky instead. However, as Buddy ran into the woods, Ward took his sniper rifle and shot Buddy as he ran, giving Ward an emotional detachment.[7]\n\nAgent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[]\n\nAfter proving his worth, Ward became a full-fledged agent, rising through the ranks under Garrett's tutelage and supervision.[7] Deputy Director Maria Hill gave Ward top marks in combat and the highest espionage rating since Natasha Romanoff, giving him low marks only in his people skills.[8] About five years outside the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, Ward was posed for sixteen months as a Russian attaché at the embassy in Warsaw, Poland.[9] In 2008, Ward saw action in Georgia during a rebel uprising. He made several contacts along the South Ossetian border during this time, including Uri Dubrovsky.[10]\n\nMission in Paris[]\n\nWard was assigned by S.H.I.E.L.D. to a mission in Paris, France, where he was ordered to break into a hidden vault belonging to the international criminal and black market dealer T. Vanchat and steal a Chitauri neural link which had somehow come into Vanchat's possession in the aftermath of the Battle of New York. Knowing that Vanchat intended to sell the neural link to an unknown buyer Ward was ordered to find and obtain the link as quickly and quietly as possible.\n\nFinding the man who intended to buy the link, Ward disguised himself as a waiter and used an X-Ray Plate to copy the man's fingerprints off his wine glass before heading upstairs and using some stolen room keys to break into the man's apartment before using his fingerprints to activate a secret room hidden behind a false wall where he soon found the link. However, just as Ward took the link, he was discovered by the man's girlfriend who called security, who quickly arrived in the room and attacked Ward, forcing him to throw the X-Ray Plate at them before fighting his way through the men.\n\nUsing his top-level S.H.I.E.L.D. training, Ward was soon able to overpower and subdue all of Vanchat's bodyguards, using whatever items were nearby to his advantage, including hitting one man with a blender. With the Neural Link now in hand, Ward ran to the top of the building, where he was extracted by S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicopter, taking the rope they dropped down for him and flying across the rooftops out of France, completing with mission successfully before any of Vanchat's remaining men could find and stop him and retake the neural link.[8]\n\nCoulson's Team[]\n\nRecruited by Maria Hill[]\n\nBefore the Battle of New York, Phil Coulson was killed at the hands of Loki and days later restored to life through unknown means. John Garrett, whose health was beginning to fail, tried to find out how Coulson was revived, hoping he could restore his own health. When Coulson assembled a new team of specialists, Ward was suggested to join, but in reality, Ward was Garrett's undercover asset to discover the truth about Coulson's resurrection.[9]\n\nHaving returned from his successful mission, Maria Hill vetted Ward and prepped him to join Coulson's Team. First, she questioned Ward about what T. Vanchat had wanted with the Chitauri Neural Link before testing Ward's loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D.. Eventually, Hill revealed to Ward that Coulson was alive, and they discussed their first mission to locate and assist Mike Peterson, a known enhanced individual. However, Ward questioned if joining a team was the correct use of his talents as he claimed not to be a very good team player while Doctor J. Streiten confirmed that Ward was highly fit and mission ready.\n\nDespite his objections, Ward was recruited onto the team regardless and ordered to pack his bags and regroup on board the Bus, which would become his home for the coming months. Once on board, Ward was introduced to Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, the team's young scientists working on engineering and biochemistry who in turn enthusiastically greeted him before somewhat roughly taking his phone before smashing it and taking his DNA. As Simmons asked what his views were on joining the team and going on their mission, Ward sarcastically compared it to Christmas.\n\nThey were interrupted by the arrival of Phil Coulson who drove L.O.L.A. onto the plane. As they explored the plane, Coulson revealed that the Bus used to be standard issue for new teams until the Helicarriers were created. Melinda May then appeared and explained that they had found the location of one of the Rising Tide's most prolific hackers, although Ward was more interested in the fact that May was part of the team, due to her legendary status as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Coulson insisted that she was merely the pilot and was not there for combat missions.[8]\n\nMeeting Skye[]\n\nDuring the new team's first mission together, they encountered the Rising Tide \"hacktivist\" known only as Skye, who was their only lead in the case of Michael Peterson. Having had some negative as well as violent encounters with Rising Tide after their release of classified data during ongoing operations, Ward took an instant dislike to Skye, whom they soon found recording a message in her van where she was arrested.\n\nBoth Ward and Phil Coulson took charge of Skye's interrogation, with Ward accusing her of being an Avengers fangirl while she accused them of covering up the Battle of Puente Antiguo until Skye revealed that she was aware of Peterson's connection to an organization known as the Centipede Project, which Ward claimed to not be aware of to hide his HYDRA connection. To gain Skye's trust and learn more about Centipede, Coulson and Ward came up with a plan to pretend to give Ward a truth serum and have him tell her some very low-level intel about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s activities, with Ward also claiming to be saddened by killing people due to his grandmother.\n\nUsing the information given to them by Skye, Leo Fitz was able to use the Echo Chamber to recreate the CCTV footage of the explosion within the lab and determine the cause. Ward looked on closely as Coulson confirmed that the explosion was clearly caused by a man who had overloaded on the Extremis that was in his body, spotting a Centipede Device that was locked onto his arm, which Jemma Simmons confirmed was highly similar to the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine during World War II. They then began working on their plan to subdue Peterson before he overloaded.[8]\n\nChase of Michael Peterson[]\n\nWhile Coulson's Team learned more about the situation, Michael Peterson kidnapped Skye and assaulted Melinda May. Before long, Skye managed to hack into the Bus' computers and informed them of her and Peterson's location, so Ward joined the rest of the team to stop him. As they located Skye's Van, Ward insisted that they move Peterson away from such a public location or simply kill him to protect others, claiming that Peterson was just a nobody who was now a major risk, although Phil Coulson insisted that they must try to save him.\n\nWith Peterson failing to comply with the orders given to him by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents asking him to surrender peacefully, he instead went on the run into Union Station, Ward gave chase and tried to subdue Peterson with a tight chokehold, explaining to him that the Extremis in his body was unstable and could kill everybody nearby if he was to explode. Peterson, however, was too enraged to listen and instead used his enhanced strength to throw Ward hard on the ground and began desperately searching for his son Ace Peterson, who Coulson had given to the police for his own safety.\n\nAs the hunt for Peterson continued, Ward witnessed a member of the Centipede Project sent by Debbie shooting at Peterson while disguised as a police officer. Coulson welcomed back May while giving orders to Ward to take aim at Peterson, although he insisted that he only fire if he had to, which Ward reluctantly agreed to. He later took a higher position and aimed a sniper rifle at Peterson while Coulson tried to calm him down as Peterson furiously ranted about how S.H.I.E.L.D. dealt with people like him, insisting that he was a good person who could be a hero like the Avengers.\n\nFearing that Peterson would explode regardless, Ward prepared to fire; however, Leo Fitz arrived and gave him a Night-Night Gun and Ward shot Peterson with it, knocking him out cold and cooling down his Extremis in his body, saving him. After the mission, Phil Coulson took Ace back to his family while Peterson recovered in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. Later, Coulson recruited Skye into his team as a consultant, over Ward's objections. While Coulson met with Skye, Ward called him and informed him that an 0-8-4 had been discovered and they had been tasked to go to Peru and investigate it.[8]\n\nFinding an 0-8-4[]\n\nWhen Ward was informed by Phil Coulson that Skye would now be brought onto their team, he questioned the decision, claiming that Skye did not have what it takes to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, although Coulson noted she was a consultant, explaining that many people, even Tony Stark, had been a consultant. While Ward argued that Skye's history with the Rising Tide made her a risk, Coulson insisted that her skills would prove valuable as she did not think like a traditional agent.\n\nThe team's second mission took them to Peru to investigate an 0-8-4, as they prepared to take off, Ward gave Skye the handbook for the Bus and ordered her to read it cover to cover. While Ward assisted the situation and ensured that they were all alone by searching for vehicle tracks, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons investigated the item itself, which turned out to be the Peruvian 0-8-4, a weapon seemingly powered by Tesseract technology and had become lodged within an ancient temple which had caused an archaeologist to panic and to contact S.H.I.E.L.D. to investigate it further.\n\nWard and Melinda May discussed her nicked name of the Cavalry and how she gained it during a mission in Bahrain until they were attacked by the Policia Militar del Perú, as Ward and May used their S.H.I.E.L.D. training to overpower and disarm their attackers before they found themselves being overpowered by reinforcements. They defended themselves until Ward contacted Coulson who appeared and revealed he knew their leader, Camilla Reyes. Once the standoff was finished peacefully, Coulson ordered Ward to let the rest of their team know that everything was now okay again.\n\nWard informed Fitz, Simmons and Skye of the near attack against them and engaged in a brief debate with Skye about the rebels of Peru rising up against their government, with Ward noting that such violence should not be celebrated, accusing the Rising Tide's own methods of being dangerous. The encounter remained pleasant until the team was attacked again, this time by local rebels. Ward used a Thunderstick to knock out many of the attackers but the team was forced to retreat. Ward pulled the 0-8-4 out of the wall and they escaped to the Bus with Reyes' soldiers.\n\nOnce they escaped, the team began to catch their breath while Skye joked about missing her own van. Ward then questioned Coulson's decision to bring the Policia Militar del Perú onto the Bus before he asked Fitz what the issues were with him stealing the 0-8-4 from the wall. Fitz then explained that the 0-8-4 was not only fueled by the Tesseract technology created by HYDRA during World War II, but it was also filled with Gamma Radiation which made it much worse than nuclear. With this information in mind, Ward, Coulson, Fitz, Simmons and Skye all backed away from the 0-8-4 together.[11]\n\nHijacking of the Bus[]\n\nAs tensions continued to rise due to the presence of the Peruvian 0-8-4, Ward argued with Leo Fitz about their actions during the mission and who was to blame for bringing the 0-8-4 onto the plane. Before long, the argument was stopped by Phil Coulson was claimed that the mission was a success as nobody on their team was killed and they had saved Camilla Reyes' men as well. Skye questioned the team's dynamic while Ward insisted that if he was working alone he could have gotten the mission completed, but Coulson ordered them to work it out.\n\nTaking some time to himself, Ward read the Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War which had been recommended by John Garrett until he was visited by Skye. They began discussing the ideals of the Rising Tide before they discussed the experience of being inside a war zone as Skye asked Ward about his own experiences of being in combat until Skye noticed that Ward had been shot during the firefight, although he insisted it was nothing to worry about. Ward explained that as a specialist he felt he had been trained to be the whole solution and put himself on the line to protect his team by any means.\n\nGlancing at the Policia Militar del Perú soldiers, Ward noticed that none of them had touched their drinks and were sending messages to one another. Sensing an attack was about to happen, Ward asked Skye for the bottle she had brought over and warned her to be ready for a fight. Ward engaged in a brawl with Nahui and the other soldiers, knowing they would be targeting Melinda May and although he tried his best to protect the team, he soon discovered that Cusi had taken Fitz and Jemma Simmons hostage, threatening to cut Fitz's throat and forcing Ward and Coulson to surrender.[11]\n\nRetaking of the Bus[]\n\nTied up together, Ward and the rest of Coulson's Team discussed who was to blame for the situation, until Ward distracted them by telling them all about Melinda May secretly being the legendary Cavalry, much to the considerable amazement of Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, only for May to awake and remind him not to call her that. They discussed their plan, with Ward quoting Skye's earlier advice to him, before May broke free by dislocating her own wrist before defeating Vilca and freeing Ward and the rest.\n\nAs a team, they then decided to use the 0-8-4's power to ambush and defeat the Peruvian military, before rescuing Phil Coulson from Camilla Reyes during the chaos. Ward ensured the team was ready before they went to work, telling them not to turn back or freeze up, as this would risk them all dying. As Ward briefed the team, May interrupted by revving the engine of one of their S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, noting that they all talked a lot. Ward then pulled their team out of the way, as May had then driven the SUV straight through the wall, and into the laboratory.\n\nThe team were able to retake the Bus by using the D.W.A.R.F.s to activate the 0-8-4 and blow a hole in the side of the Bus, killing many of the soldiers as they were sucked out. During the chaos, Ward ordered the team to collect the 0-8-4 while he dealt with the soldiers, reassuring them that Coulson could handle himself. While May retook the cockpit and flew the plane to a safe altitude and Coulson captured Camilla Reyes, Ward, using his own S.H.I.E.L.D. training, easily overpowered and subdued the soldiers before trying and failing to save Nahui from being sucked out of the plane, inadvertently killing him during the fight.\n\nWard, however, suddenly found himself in danger of being sucked out of the plane as he lost his grip and fell towards the hole in the side of the Bus. However, Skye's quick thinking also helped to save Ward's life when she activated a lifeboat which blocked the hole and saved Ward. With the plane reaching a safe altitude, Ward collapsed with exhaustion and adrenaline and his looked at how close he had come to a fatal fall from the plane while Coulson helped take out the final soldiers by knocking out Lopez while May flew them back towards the safety of a S.H.I.E.L.D. base where they could relax.[11]\n\nWatching Slingshot[]\n\nThe team then flew to the Slingshot to deal with the 0-8-4, as soon as possible while also arresting Camilla Reyes and all the surviving members of her team and holding her in a detention facility. While they loaded up all their equipment together, Ward had spoken with Melinda May about Skye, noting that he believed that she could become more than a consultant down the line. As Ward noted that Skye could even about a real asset to Coulson's Team, once she got some more serious training behind her.\n\nUnder May's recommendation, Ward had agreed to become Skye's Supervising Officer and oversee the next stages of her training and education to become a true S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Taking time to relax, the team sat down and drank as they waited for Slingshot to begin, with Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons excitedly explaining the process behind Slingshot. While Coulson questioned who shot the hole in the Bus, Ward insisted it was a team decision, as Coulson complimented their work in saving them. Ward and the others then watched on as the Peruvian 0-8-4 was shot into the Sun to be destroyed.[11]\n\nSkye's S.O.[]\n\nBeginning Skye's Training[]\n\nTaking on his role as Skye's Supervising Officer, Ward began her training in combat and weapon training, specifically how to disarm an opponent. However, Skye would turn up late to their next training session, as Ward began using the punching bag while he waited for her, with Skye complaining that she was still tired from their morning work out. Ward explained that this was all required, and warned that next time she would be given fifteen pushups for every minute that she was late.\n\nWhile Skye noted that pushups were better than pull-ups, Ward insisted that pull-ups could be necessary if Skye ever found herself hanging off a tall building. Ward then demonstrated the correct way for Skye to throw a punch against the punching bag, ordering her to do it for ten minutes. As Skye began to punch, Ward asked what the hardest part of boxing was, to which Skye jokingly asked if it was being punched in the face, as Ward explained that it was actually keeping your hands up. However, Skye questioned if Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons' supervising officers made them undergo such physical training.\n\nWard noted that Skye wanted to be a field agent like Phil Coulson, before deciding to demonstrate what Fitz and Simmons had to go through during their training, as Simmons explained that their drills included naming every mechanical, chemical and thermal and electrical properties of materials. With Skye accepting his point, Ward noted that there would come a time when Skye would accept her role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, or leave, insisting that every agent had a defining moment, including Coulson, noting that his job as her supervising officer was to make sure that she did not die before this moment came.\n\nAs Ward reminded Skye to keep her hands up, she questioned what Ward's defining moment was, although Ward did not respond and simply reminded Skye to keep her arms raised while using the punching bag. With Skye continuing to question what Ward's defining moment was, she suggested that she could get more Truth Serum to use on Ward once again. However, Ward noted that he had overshared some level one intel to her which got her to cooperate, before explaining that S.H.I.E.L.D. did not actually have their own Truth Serum, and this had all been a plow to get her on side, much to Skye's considerable shock.[5]\n\nKidnapping of Franklin Hall[]\n\nWard would join the rest of Coulson's Team in the main room of the Bus, as he was brief about an attack on a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport, resulting in the kidnapping of Doctor Franklin Hall. However, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons had both expressed their shock about this news, as Hall had been one of their professors at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy. Ward asked who attacked the truck, to which Phil Coulson explained that the attackers had seemingly been invisible, which Skye found exciting, while Ward gave her a stern look.\n\nHaving travelled to Sterling, Colorado, Ward listened to Coulson explaining Hall's relationship to S.H.I.E.L.D., before they noticed that several of the S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs that had been protecting Hall, had ended up stuck in trees. Ward then looked through the scene for clues about what could have caused this attack, before Simmons had used the Full-Spectrum Goggles to uncover that the Electro-Static Field Scanner had activated a gravity surge in the area, causing the dirt around them to fly through the air, shooting stones towards them, before finding a small device on the ground.\n\nWhile the team had taken the device back to the Bus to be examined by Fitz and Simmons, Ward searched for their records to match tractor tracks found on the scene, which were seemingly used to take Hall out of the S.H.I.E.L.D. truck. As he returned, Skye was offering to do the same thing, as Ward explained that the tractor had been identified as a 2010 model, linked to a purchases made by three men with priors or financial concerns, who were suspected of selling the equipment to the kidnappers. Coulson then ordered Ward to join him in questioning these men and attempting to find a link to locating Hall.\n\nWard had then joined Coulson in travelling to Barnroof Point, Colorado, to speak to Todd Chesterfield, one of these suspects who had seemingly sold their tractors to the kidnappers of Hall. Ward kept himself hidden, while Coulson spoke to Chesterfield and asked who he had sold the tractor to and why, although Chesterfield instead responded by drawing his shotgun and refusing to answer any questions. Ward was then able to ambush Chesterfield, swiftly disarming him and throwing him off his horse, as Ward took the shotgun and commented to Coulson that this entire situation reminded him of the Wild West.\n\nWith Ward aiming the shotgun at him, Chesterfield finally admitted that he was paid to sell the equipment and that was all he knew, insisting that he never saw a face and never heard the name of who he was doing business with. As Coulson questioned how Chesterfield was paid, he pointed to his saddle bag, as Ward examined it and found bars of gold inside, with Ward insisting that with a cowboy being paid in bars of gold, the situation really did feel like the West Wild. Ward and Coulson then took possession of the gold and brought it to the Bus, hoping to be able to trace it back to the original supplier.[5]\n\nMaking Their Plan[]\n\nHaving scanned the gold that Todd Chesterfield had been paid with, Coulson's Team were able to determine that Ian Quinn had been behind Franklin Hall's kidnapping. However, despite their desire to rescue Hall, Ward had argued with Phil Coulson that there was no way for them to get inside Quinn's Mansion without either a large task force or a man on the inside to shut down Quinn's security systems, with Coulson noting that they would risk global outrage by sending in a task force.\n\nHowever, as Coulson noted that Quinn was hosting a shareholder's party, he noted that if they went on the mission alone they could give S.H.I.E.L.D. deniability, only for Melinda May to insist that it was impossible to do without a man on the inside. Although Skye told the team that she could go in, Ward ignored this and claimed that he could be dropped off outside of Valletta, where he could spend weeks establishing a cover to get inside. Despite Ward attempting to dismiss her by pitching his own plans, Skye simply explained that, as she was not an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. she could go in legally.\n\nFrustrated by her claims, Ward noted that this was not a situation that the Rising Tide could simply hack into, while Leo Fitz reminded her that Quinn's mansion had Neodymium Laser Fencing to prevent anybody from breaking inside. Ward then listened as Skye noted that clearly Hall needed their help, as he was at risk of being tortured, jokingly claiming that he could be getting put through strength training. As Ward noted that Skye did not have the training, clearance or experience to handle this mission, Skye explained that she had already hacked Quinn Worldwide and gotten an invite to his party.\n\nConcerned about the risks involved with sending Skye on this mission alone, Ward went to speak to Coulson in his office, although Coulson noted that they did not have many other options. Ward had acknowledged that he was impressed by Skye being able to get the invitation to Quinn's party, but insisted that sending her in without any training was a risk. Ward then noted that Nick Fury might have felt he owed Coulson after he sacrificed himself to Loki, with Coulson noting that he also sacrificed his card collection, but Ward still insisted that Coulson was taking too many risks with this plan.\n\nCoulson questioned if Ward was concerned over Skye's safety or loyalty, to which Ward insisted that it was both, noting that the Rising Tide was the reason that Skye got the invitation, suggesting that Skye had violated several protocols. However, Coulson insisted that Skye's job was to ignore these protocols to find the connections and backdoors that S.H.I.E.L.D. agents may have missed. Coulson then noted that something else was clearly bothering Ward, to which Ward explained that Skye was holding back, claiming to want to be a field agent, but not committing herself, as he noted that she made jokes and did not listen.\n\nAs Coulson questioned if Ward was hard on her during her training, Ward explained that he had attempted to be hard on her, and had attempted to play nice with her, but was still struggling to get Skye to commit to the training involved with becoming an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., as he suggested that he needed a new strategy to get through to Skye, or he was concerned that she would never become an agent. In response, Coulson had then suggested that Ward could potentially try no strategy, and attempt to work less like an agent and more like a person, as Skye might let that person help her think like an agent.[5]\n\nSkye's Mission Training[]\n\nWard had then continued to train Skye, as he began to show her how to disarm an enemy with a firearm, although Skye continued to joke, as Ward got her in a headlock and she suggested that he was flirting with her, although Ward remained focused on showing her how to take the gun away. Ward told Skye that if she did not focus, she would die on the mission and leave their team vulnerable, insisting that she needed to learn the fundamentals of self-defense, while Skye continued to joke.\n\nWard had then questioned how Skye had learnt her computer skills without committing herself to it, to which Skye insisted that it simply came naturally to her, apologizing that she did not naturally have Ward's skills with combat. However, Ward then told Skye that his skills did not come naturally, telling her about how Christian Ward used to beat him and Thomas Ward when they were children, and therefore he had to learn how to defend himself and his brother, and now he was protecting Skye and the rest of Coulson's Team, telling Skye that this had been his own defining moment as an agent.\n\nSkye then apologized to Ward for pushing him on the subject, before revealing to him that she had managed to take away his gun while he had been distracted by telling the story. Ward then took the gun back, before telling Skye that taking the gun away from her enemy was one thing, but insisted that pulling the trigger was something else. Ward and Skye then continued their training, with Ward telling her to go through the steps slowly, focusing on the first thing to do. Once their training was complete, Ward and Skye rejoined Phil Coulson to go through the plan to infiltrate inside Ian Quinn's Mansion.\n\nWard listened as Coulson explained that, while Skye would arrive at the party, a two-person extraction team could arrive via the beach, while Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discussed how the beach was surrounded by the Neodymium Laser Fencing, as they gave Skye a device that could disable the system. With Fitz and Simmons insisting that this would be easy, Ward noted that it would be, if Skye would be able to fully stick to the plan. Ward was selected for the extraction team, although Melinda May was ordered to stay on the Bus, while Coulson would be going in with Ward to rescue Hall.[5]\n\nRescue of Franklin Hall[]\n\nWard and Phil Coulson used a boat to sneak onto the beach just outside of Ian Quinn's Mansion, as Coulson warned that Franklin Hall could be traumatized from his experiences, as he advised that he be the one to speak to him, as Ward's personality could put him on edge. While Ward had commented on Coulson's attempt at humor, he noted that his personality could be the least of their concerns if Skye failed her mission to get them inside the mansion.\n\nWard and Coulson soon arrived at the Neodymium Laser Fencing, which they discovered was still active, with Ward noting that the next patrol of guards would be coming by soon. Melinda May had then informed them that Skye had gone offline, with Ward noting that aborting the mission was not an option, and they still had to get to Hall, before the guard patrol returned, forcing Ward and Coulson to hide. Ward and Coulson then ambushed, and swiftly subdued the guards, as Ward took one of their guns and threw it into the fence, instantly destroying it, while Coulson had questioned where Skye had gone to.\n\nThey soon came under fire from even more guards arriving, as Coulson ordered Leo Fitz to reset the systems to shut down the fencing, with Jemma Simmons asking them not to rush Fitz, as it would not help him to hack into Quinn's systems any faster. Eventually, Fitz told them that the system had successfully rebooted, as Ward and Coulson had managed to get to the other side of the fencing before he reset, separating them from all of the guards, who had continued shooting at them. As they infiltrated the mansion, Coulson noted that he would go to the laboratory to rescue Hall, while Ward to go after Skye.\n\nAs Ward made his way through the mansion, he commented on the size of the place and asked for help from Coulson's Team with finding Skye, while May questioned if he had the situation covered, as Ward insisted that he was working on it, while he felt the entire base shaking from the unstable Gravitonium. Eventually, Ward found Skye being surrounded by three of Quinn's guards, as he rushed in and managed to take them off guard. Using his element of surprise to his advantage, Ward was able to fight all three and swiftly subdued them, knocking one down into the pool, before questioning if Skye had been hurt.\n\nAs Skye rushed over to his side, Ward had then told Skye to follow his orders, as he led her towards safety, first intending to rescue Coulson and Hall. Ward and Skye had then made their way to the laboratory to assist Coulson, just as the gravity across the mansion went back to normal. As they looked at the machinery that had been containing the Gravitonium, they realized that Coulson had been forced to throw Hall inside it, killing him, since Hall had been the one behind the entire situation and had been attempted to destroy the entire mansion, and kill everybody inside with the unstable Gravitonium.[5]\n\nMission Aftermath[]\n\nHaving retuned to the Bus, Ward found Skye training with the punching bag, as he went to join her. Skye then questioned where Ward and his brothers had grown up, to which he answered Massachusetts, as she asked if he had grown up in a house, which he confirmed. Ward then listened as Skye explained that when she was nine years old, she had been sent to live with the Brody's, who sent her back to Saint Agnes Orphanage after a month, claiming she was not a good fit.\n\nAs Skye noted that this was not an unfamiliar situation, she claimed that with the Brody's it was different, with Ward noting that she wanted them to like her, which Skye agreed with, admitting that she once tried to call Mrs. Brody mom. As Skye returned to the punching bag, she told Ward that hoping for something and losing it hurt more than never hoping for anything. Ward then held the bag in place, promising that S.H.I.E.L.D. would not turn their back on her, although Skye claimed that it did not matter, claiming that she made her choice, and she wanted badly to become a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.[5]\n\nAkela Amador's Return[]\n\nWard took some time to visit the lab on board the Bus, where he had inspected the upgrades to the Night-Night Gun, noting that he only got one shot with the rifle, and that the shot needed to knock his enemies away, as well as out. In response, Leo Fitz had presented Ward with a handgun version of the Night-Night gun, noting how many rounds could be held in the gun, which Jemma Simmons had then claimed was in case he missed his shot, or if had gone up against multiple assailants at once.\n\nAlthough Ward attempted to examine the gun, Fitz insisted that it would be ready for use soon, although Ward denied that they would be calling it a Night-Night Pistol, which Simmons had agreed with. Stepping out of the lab, Ward greeted Phil Coulson, who asked if he had seen Skye, to which Ward noted that he had not seen her since weapons training. Coulson then asked Ward about how well Skye was doing with her training, to which Ward noted that she stopped saying bang, but struggled with the difference between the safety and magazine release on a gun.\n\nWard learnt that they were looking for Akela Amador, who had been linked to multiple jewellery heists across Europe, as Ward brought up the information that they had on the Holocom, explaining that Amador had left Sweden using a fake passport, where she had been tracked through Belarus and then Zloda. Ward went on to explain that he had made a list of names of dealers who could handle the amount of diamonds that Amador had stolen, but had found no contact having been made, to which Coulson suggested that she could be waiting for the right sale.\n\nCoulson told the team to focus on finding Amador, as Melinda May suggested that they inform S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters that Amador was alive, so they could assist with the man hunt. However, Coulson refused to contact Headquarters until they knew more about the situation, as he turned to Ward and asked him to contact Belarus authorities and find somewhere to park the Bus, and to also made a list of potential locations where Amador could be staying in Zloda, as it was a small area and they would likely be able to track down Amador, which Ward agreed to.[12]\n\nSearching for Akela Amador[]\n\nTaking a van, Ward drove the team into Zloda, Belarus, as he listened to Jemma Simmons expressing her excitement about visiting Zloda, as it was the birthplace of Zhores Alferov, while Leo Fitz had teased and argued with her about their knowledge of Alferov and the area. As Fitz expressed his nerves about going on a mission in the wake of their conflict with Camilla Reyes, when they had last been in the field, as he was reassured that they would not need to leave the van this time.\n\nAnswering a call, Ward spoke to Melinda May, using the code name of \"Short Bus\", which was mocked by Phil Coulson, who insisted that Ward could no longer chose code-names. May informed Ward and the others that S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters had requested an update, but that May had reassured them that they had the situation under control, which Coulson thanked her for. Once Ward parked, Coulson advised on how to track Akela Amador, while Ward ordered them to maintain radio silence unless they needed help, but did not answer Fitz's request for specification.\n\nWalking to Zloda together, Ward had commented to Coulson about how painful this must be for him, suggesting that Amador had betrayed his trust, although Coulson insisted that they did not have all the facts yet, while Ward also reminded Coulson that Amador had seemingly betrayed the other two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on her mission when she had disappeared. As Ward questioned what Amador could have gotten for betraying her teammates, Coulson insisted that until they knew more about it, they would not assume anything about what Amador was involved with.\n\nWard had then gotten a call from Skye, as he questioned if they had been able to locate Amador yet, which Skye denied, although she noted that they had managed to find a strange signal which Amador could be using for her communications. However, Skye had then explained that her reason for calling was to ask how they should be taking bathroom breaks on the mission, much to Ward's annoyance. Despite being annoyed, Ward suggested using a container in a box, which Skye discovered was a simple water bottle, questioning how the women should use this.\n\nWard then dismissed Skye and Fitz's questions about snacks in the van, as he and Coulson continued with the mission to track down Amador. Stepping into an inn, Ward and Coulson spoke with the Innkeeper and asked if she had seen Amador, to which the Innkeeper immediately recognized Amador's picture, calling her an angel. As Ward questioned why she said this, the Innkeeper explained Amador seemingly had gifts, as she had told the Innkeeper to go to a doctor, where they found a tumor, which she was getting removed, suggesting that Amador saved her life.\n\nCoulson told the Innkeeper that it was important that they speak to Amador, to which the Innkeeper suggested that, with Amador's gifts, it was likely that she already knew that they were coming to speak with her. However, Ward and Coulson would then learn that while they had been speaking with the Innkeeper, Amador had somehow managed to track down Skye, Fitz and Simmons' van, which she had then rammed off the road and into a ditch, although none of the agents inside had been injured as a result of this attack, as they regrouped to discuss what had happened.[12]\n\nLearning of the Eye Implant[]\n\nReturning onto the Bus, Ward had confronted Phil Coulson about his seeming protection of Akela Amador, insisting that since Amador had just attack them, it was clear that Amador was unwilling to show the same protection towards them. Coulson had then asked how the team was doing, to which Ward insisted that they were shaken, despite being fortunate enough to not have suffered any broken bones from the crash, as Ward had also suggested that their team needed time to get refocused.\n\nHowever, Ward was then interrupted by Skye, who explained that she believed that she could recover the data signature from the broadcast she had been studying when Amador had attacked the van. Ward and Coulson followed Skye into the lab, as they put the Amador's camera feed onto the monitors, and watched the feed showing a mirror that Amador was looking into. As they continued watching, Ward saw Amador using surgical tools on her own eyeball, as Melinda May confirmed that her eye actually was the camera, which could switch into X-Ray mode.\n\nWhile they watched the X-Ray of the robotic eye, Skye jokingly asked Ward if he could also do this, calling him a robot, which Ward rolled his eyes at. Ward then asked Leo Fitz who had this technology, as Fitz confirmed that S.H.I.E.L.D. did not have this yet, insisting that it was at least a decade ahead of what they had, with Fitz and Jemma Simmons discussing how the technology worked and could be replicated. Coulson insisted that they had to bring Amador in for questioning, while May argued that she was a weapon who needed to be taken out.\n\nWard watched as May told Coulson that she would contact S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters and request a task force, although Coulson insisted that their team could handle it. Ward listened to May suggesting that Coulson felt guilt, and claimed he was putting Amador's life above the lives of his team, to which Coulson insisted that they protected their own, while Ward had argued that Amador was not a member of their team. Watching the feed, a message came up as Coulson realized this was proof that Amador was being controlled, ordering Ward and the others to watch the feed.[12]\n\nInfiltration into Todorov Building[]\n\nEventually, Akela Amador was found by Melinda May and captured, while her eye implant was hacked and the feed was transferred to the Backscatter Glasses. Ward would then wear these glasses and follow Amador's mission for her, in the hope that they would be able to convince her handler that it was still Amador on the mission, while her eye implant was removed. Ward drove to the Todorov Building where Amador had been ordered to go, with Skye finishing her work on the glasses as he drove.\n\nOnce they arrived, Ward noted to Skye that the building looked more like it was designed for research, rather than military, with Skye noting that it looked like a prison. Skye had then confirmed that the glasses were ready to go wireless, as she unplugged the cables, tickling Ward as she touched his ear, which she mocked him for while also reminding Ward not to look back at her, in order to maintain the illusion that the handler was looking through Amador's eye implant. As Skye noted how hellish Amador's life had been, Ward focused on testing out the glasses.\n\nBefore going inside, Ward noted that he could not look at Skye, and therefore could not help her if she got into trouble, before leaving the car. As Ward stepped inside the building, Skye noted that Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons were prepping Amador for surgery, while also telling Ward not to look at his hands while he scanned himself inside, as he and Amador had different hands, although Ward insisted that he did not need reminding. Moving through the base, Ward successfully avoided attention and looking into mirrors as he continued on with his mission.\n\nMoving towards the offices, Ward received a message from the handler, who confirmed that the man at the desk was Amador's target, with Ward suggesting to Skye that this would mean that he would likely have to kill or at least badly injury the man behind the desk. While Ward refused to give up on the mission, no matter what, he received another message, ordering him to seduce the man, resulting in Ward awkwardly asking Skye for help. In response, Skye had mocked Ward over this, as he had said earlier that he did not need or want any of her help.\n\nWard suggested that he simply knock the man out, to which Skye suggested that they might need him to get them through the next doorway, while Ward noted that it was unlikely that he would be the man's type that he was attracted to. Skye instead suggested that Ward engage him as a friend, recommending that they discuss sports and vodka, asking if Ward was capable of being friendly. Stepping into the room, Ward was immediately asked for his identification, which Ward pretended to have lost while trying to talk about football matches with the man, which he ignored.\n\nWard attempted to engage the man by claiming to have spent the night with two girls from Ukraine, which he did not respond to. As the man showed no response to anything, Ward gave up with this tactic, and proceeded to slam the man's head into the desk, knocking him unconscious. Using his card, Ward then stepped into the next room, where he found two men working, with mathematical equations written on the walls. As he looked around, Ward found strange symbols that had been displayed, and was told by the handler that the mission was complete.\n\nAs Ward left the room, he realized that he needed to keep the guard awake, so he could ensure that the alarms across the base were not set off, as he needed to input his password into the computers. Although Skye suggested she could fix it, they were too late as the alarms across the entire building went off, as Ward grabbed the guard's gun and told Skye to meet him on the south side of the building. Ward attempted to leave without being noticed, but this soon failed, and he was forced to run when a guard spotted him, as he fled down the hallways.\n\nWhile he was attempted to get away without being caught, Ward was then called by Fitz, although he did not answer, instead using his glasses' X-Ray vision to see where the guards were, as he proceeded to shoot through the wall, killing three of the guards, before answering Fitz's call, impatiently questioning what he wanted. As Ward hid from the guards, Fitz explained that he was currently holding onto Amador's eye implant, which was still attached to her and could potentially explode at any moment, as Ward questioned what state the wires were currently in.\n\nHowever, Ward had then accidentally looked into a mirror, revealing that he was behind the feed that the handler was looking at. Knowing that the eye's detonator would be triggered as a result, Ward ordered Fitz to immediately cut the wires. Ward had then focused on his own escape, telling Skye that he was on his way to her, as he avoided the gunfire from the guards who had found him, and proceeded to shoot at a window before leaping through it. Ward had then jumped from the containers and landed in front of Skye's car, as he got in and they drove away together.[12]\n\nCards with Leo Fitz[]\n\nWith the mission complete, Ward had returned to the Bus, where he had played cards with Leo Fitz, who had seemed extremely cocky during the game, while Ward remained emotionless, watching Fitz eating his pretzels. Checking his cards, Ward called Fitz's bet, and raised him another hundred dollars. Fitz questioned if Ward understood why he knew he would beat him, to which Ward claimed that Fitz would lose, only for Fitz to insist that Ward actually had a tell when he was bluffing that he could read.\n\nFitz then stared closely at Ward, claiming that he would watch him carefully to find the tell, before awkwardly saying the same phrase a second time. However, following a brief pause, Fitz instead folded his cards, telling Ward that he had won the game, much to Ward's confusion. What Ward had been unaware of during this game, was that Skye was in her room behind Ward, and had been planning on using the Backscatter Glasses to see Ward's cards, but Fitz gave up when he realized that Skye would see him nude, although Skye took the opportunity to look at Ward nude.[12]\n\nDisappearance of Chan Ho Yin[]\n\nWhile they were on board the Bus, Ward and Skye sat down for a game of Battleship, which Ward took extremely seriously, telling Skye that every decision she made would have consequences, while Skye had successfully managed to hit Ward's battleship. Skye had then questioned why Battleship was part of her training, to which Ward claimed that it was important, as her SO, for him to evaluate his student's thought process, but had also confessed that he simply enjoyed the game.\n\nWard then made his move, only to be told that he had missed, with Skye claiming that this game was more about blind luck than tactics, while also confessing to preferring this to working out. Ward told Skye that she deserved the break, admitting that Phil Coulson's decision to trust a former member of the Rising Tide had paid off more than he would have expected, with Skye expressing her shock that Ward had actually paid her a compliment. Once Skye finished teasing Ward, she made another move, as Ward confessed that she had sunk his battleship.\n\nThe game was interrupted by a call on the Holocom, as Ward and Skye joined for others for a briefing with Coulson, where they were then presented with the picture of Chan Ho Yin, who was described to be a street performer, who had begun to exhibit pyrokinetic abilities. Ward listened as Coulson explained that Yin had been close to a nuclear power facility that had caught fire, and that he got onto S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar when his performances had been reported on, and he was put on the Index and was also ordered to keep all of his powers under wraps.\n\nAs Skye expressed her shock at the concept of an Index of powered people, Ward confessed that sometimes the Index was needed in case S.H.I.E.L.D. had to take action against someone on the list. Moving on, Coulson explained that Yin's case agent found him missing, before Quan Chen spoke to them on the screen, as everyone except Ward waved at Chen. Chen briefed the team, noting that Yin had disappeared twice before, but this time he had been taken by a professional team who wore fireproof clothing, as Ward noted that they clearly knew about his powers.\n\nChen explained that it would likely be because their systems had been hacked into, and therefore Yin's powers had been known by the people who had taken him. When Chen explained that it was the Rising Tide, everyone, including Ward, had looked at Skye. Ward and Skye then went to Coulson's office, where Skye argued that the Rising Tide was a huge organization, so she did not know who was responsible for hacking into the Index, promising that it was not her. While Ward insisted that he was not accusing her, Skye insisted that they were clearly considering this.\n\nSkye argued to Ward and Coulson that, as she had been living with them on board the Bus for weeks, it would be impossible for her to hack into S.H.I.E.L.D., although Coulson suggested that it could also have become easier for her. As Skye offered to help them track down the hacker, Ward insisted that he believed her and suggested that they would need to track down the hacker who was actually responsible for this. In response, Coulson had then ordered Skye to find something on the hacker quickly, as Yin would be in danger the longer that he was missing.\n\nWard would join the team in watching Skye hacking through the systems to find out who had hacked into the Index, with Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons expressing their excitement over watching her work, while Ward and Coulson had been confused by the technical talk. Eventually, Skye determined that the hacker was in Austin, Texas, noting that he had been working through a cafe, and learnt through credit cards paid inside of the cafe at that time that it was Miles Lydon who was seemingly the one who was responsible for hacking into the Index and leaking all of the information about Yin.\n\nCoulson questioned if Skye knew Lydon, to which she claimed that every hacker in the world knew him, while Fitz and Simmons noted that he was also famous for hacking into the Kremlin and leaking the shirtless pictures of Vladimir Putin on horseback. Ward noted that Lydon was also responsible for Yin being kidnapped, before Coulson ordered them to fly into Austin to arrest Lydon, with Melinda May confirming that they were on their way. Ward was told by Coulson that their best bet to find Yin would be to find and question Lydon about what he knew.[13]\n\nBetrayed by Skye[]\n\nUpon arriving in Austin, Texas, the team had split up to search the area for their target, with Ward walking up and down the streets, while Skye left the cafe where she had tracked Miles Lydon to and claimed that the cashier had not seen him in over a week. However, Ward had then caught sight of Lydon, who was just exiting a shop, only for Lydon to catch Ward watching him and attempt to flee, with Ward then chasing right behind him, giving the team his updates on Lydon's current location.\n\nChasing down Lydon, Ward witnessed him getting into a car and being driven away, as Phil Coulson had then continued with the chase in his S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV, only for Lydon to hack into the city's street lights and cause cars to block the road, trapping Coulson's SUV and allowing Lydon to escape. However, the team would discover that Lydon was only able to realize that he was being watched and catch Ward, because Skye had given him a warning, as they had been in a relationship, as Ward and the rest of the team caught Skye and Lydon back at his apartment.\n\nWard had then assisted the team in looking through all of Lydon's belongings, while Melinda May had questioned Lydon about the information that he had stolen and who it had been told to, and Coulson had questioned her about her relationship with Lydon, with Skye insisting that he was a dead end who knew nothing about Chan Ho Yin, although the team remained unconvinced that this was all that was happening. While looking through papers, Ward had stood by Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons while they discussed what Skye's true motivations for this were, suggesting that there had to be a reason she had been lying to them.\n\nHaving failed to learn what they needed to from Skye or Lydon, Coulson ordered the team to pack up what they had, as they would be traveling to Hong Kong in order to attempt to find and rescue Yin. Ward had then gone over to Skye, who had attempted to apologize and explain herself to him, only for Ward to simply order her to present her hands, which he had then handcuffed and ordered her to follow him back to the Bus for questioning, still angry and frustrated that she had lied to him after he had put his neck out to defend her ahead of this mission.[13]\n\nQuestioning the Hackers[]\n\nOnce they had returned onto the Bus, Ward had watched Skye and Miles Lydon arguing in their cell about the ideals of the Rising Tide, before Ward determined that Lydon was dirty, and was simply hiding behind the manifesto of the Rising Tide. Ward had then turned off the Holocom and turned to Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, questioning what they had found out about Lydon, although Simmons insisted Lydon seemed to be clear, despite his Minecraft team being described as nasty.\n\nEventually, Simmons found that Lydon had been moving money through various banks, having been paid a small fortune for the information, as Ward then went into the cell to question Skye and Lydon, noting to Lydon that Skye had defended his character, which would be why he would give him a chance to explain himself. Ward offered Lydon the chance to come clean to Skye, but Lydon refused, resulting in Ward revealing that Lydon had been paid a million dollars for leaking the intel about Chan Ho Yin, as Skye had then realized that he had sold out Yin.\n\nWard watched as Skye confronted Lydon about this, as he insisted that a million dollars could change both of their lives, as he claimed that the woman who offered it was harmless, although Skye insisted that nobody who paid a million dollars for intel had good intentions. Ward questioned who the woman was, to which Lydon explained she was a fan of the Rising Tide, describing her as a rich woman in a flower dress, who pointed him to a S.H.I.E.L.D. feed in China that she wanted him to hack, as Ward questioned if he really thought this was harmless.\n\nLydon claimed to Ward and Skye that the information was not any different to what the Rising Tide had previously leaked, and that he had researched the company that the money came from, in an attempt to ensure that it was not an evil organization. Ward listened to Lydon claim that the company the money came from was an eco-research laboratory, as Ward pressed him on this, as Lydon revealed that the company researched insects, to which they deduced that it was the Centipede Project again, as Ward and Skye made eye contact and considered what this meant.[13]\n\nPreparation for the Rescue[]\n\nWard had then joined the team as they discussed the mission plan, with Phil Coulson confirming that the Centipede Project had been responsible for Chan Ho Yin's kidnapping, with Ward noting that Centipede had operations running in Los Angeles and Hong Kong, questioning how strong they were and what their motivations could be. Coulson had then deduced that Centipede were a well financed, international organization, who were interested in creating a super soldier.\n\nCoulson had then explained to Ward and the others that Miles Lydon had provided them with the woman's account details, which had allowed S.H.I.E.L.D. to deduce that Yin was being held in a facility in Hong Kong. Melinda May questioned what Centipede wanted with Yin, to which Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons also speculated that Centipede were hoping that Yin's pyrokinetic powers could stabilise the Extremis that they had been using inside of the Centipede Serum, which would prevent all of their future soldiers from unexpectedly exploding again.[13]\n\nRaid on the Centipede Base[]\n\nHaving arrived in Hong Kong, Ward suited up in his Bulletproof Vest and armed his rifle, only to be told by Phil Coulson that he and Melinda May would handle the field work, while Ward to stayed behind and oversee Skye and Miles Lydon. However, Ward argued that this was his responsibility, only for Coulson to insist that he had made the choice to bring Skye onto the Bus, which Ward had immediately warned him against, as Coulson claimed that this was his problem, that he would fix.\n\nHowever, Ward was soon alerted that something had gone wrong during the mission, and made the decision to release Skye and Lydon so that they could assist them. Having joined Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, Ward allowed Skye to hack into the facility, where they soon realized that it had been put under lock down, while Fitz had questioned if Ward was sure about letting Skye and Lydon do this. Ward questioned if Skye would be able to fix the alarms and free the team, to which Skye said that she could only do it if she was inside the facility.\n\nBoth Ward and Lydon had objected to this plan, with Lydon noting that Skye was a hacker and was not a trained soldier, to which Skye had turned to Ward and noted that he was. With no other choice, Ward had brought Skye into the facility, where they were attacked by multiple guards, with Ward fighting them off to allow Skye to get to the computer systems, as May questioned if they were any closer to getting the doors open, which Ward insisted they were close to. As one of the guards had attempted to grab Skye, Ward elbowed him in the jaw, before taking Skye away.\n\nGetting themselves into the main control room, Ward kept watch as Skye sat down on the computer and began hacking into the system to unlock all of the doors, and allow Coulson and May to get away. Stepping over to Skye, Ward questioned how long it would take her to unlock everything, just as Skye told him that she was done and moved away, which had impressed Ward. Regrouping with Coulson and May, Ward and Skye managed to escape from the building, just as Yin had exploded from an overload of Centipede Serum that May had injected him with, as the group had then watched the fireball exploding into the skyline.\n\nAs the flames died down, Ward turned to Coulson and informed him that Skye had managed to extract from files from the facility's mainframe, which might be enough to help them get closer to finding out more about Centipede Project, which Coulson barely acknowledged. Seeing Coulson's distraction due to Yin's demise, Ward told him that they could not save somebody from themselves, as Yin had lost control of his mind and tried to kill everyone, as Coulson noted that they could save someone if they got to them early enough, as they gave a look to Skye.[13]\n\nDrinking with Melinda May[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the mission, Ward and sat down with Melinda May at the Bus' bar, where he asked for to pour him a double of whisky, to which May jokingly questioned if there was any other kind. The pair were then interrupted by Skye, who told Ward that she was on her way to Phil Coulson's office to discuss what happened during this mission, as Skye questioned if Ward wanted to join her, as he was her Supervising Officer and should likely be a witness to this.\n\nHowever, Ward had instead told Skye that he was now off the clock, and left Skye to go and talk with Coulson alone, due to his continued frustration over her betrayal of the team's trust by helping Miles Lydon, as Ward chose to instead spend his time with May. Rather than kick her off the team, Coulson decided to offer Skye the same Tracking Bracelet that he had given to Lydon, which meant that they would be able to track her movements, and also meant that her access to computers would be downgraded considerably as a punishment for her actions.[13]\n\nTesting the Night Night Gun[]\n\nJoining Leo Fitz in his laboratory on the Bus, Ward was presented with the latest model of the Night-Night Gun, which Ward held is his hand and claimed to be an ounce too heavy. While Skye reacted with shock to this claim, Ward insisted that an ounce would be the difference between life and death in certain situations on the field. Although Fitz attempted to remind Ward that they still had the Night-Night Rifle that they could use for those situations, Ward insisted that Fitz redesign the gun to lose the ounce.\n\nWhile out of the laboratory, Ward was informed that they were being sent on a mission, so he returned to the laboratory to order Fitz and Skye to collect their gear and be ready to leave. Seeing them beginning to giggle, Ward questioned what they were laughing about, before Jemma Simmons handed Ward the Night-Night Gun, claiming that Fitz had accidentally left a dummy round inside the gun, and it should be the correct weight now. Ward held the gun and tested it, before thanking Simmons for fixing it and leaving the laboratory, hearing the others were mocking him.[14]\n\nThe Floating Corpse[]\n\nArriving in Wrigley, Pennsylvania, Ward listened as Phil Coulson explained that a boy scout group had encountered an electrostatic anomaly. As she checked the van, Melinda May noted that the van's battery had shot straight up, while Ward found the battery close by. While looking around the area, Ward noticed that Skye was standing right behind him, to which Skye claimed to simply be shadowing her supervising officer, while he insisted that she was smothering him, before continuing to look around the area.\n\nWard rejoined the rest of Coulson's Team, as they discovered the corpse of the scout group leader, Adam Cross, which was floating in the air. Ward stood by as Coulson asked Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons would could be causing this, to which they claimed to not have a clue. Ward suggested that they were likely either dealing with a highly unlikely natural event, or it was some kind of high tech weaponry that S.H.I.E.L.D. was not aware of, while Skye suggested that it could have been done by someone on the Index, to which May insisted there was nobody on the Index with this power.\n\nCoulson informed the team that he would contact Felix Blake to report this situation, noting that they could not allow it to happen again, and therefore needed to figure out the cause. As they were preparing to leave, Ward looked on as Simmons noted some strange colouration on a wound on Cross' head, but as she got close, an electrical spark shot out near Simmons, which caused Cross' corpse to drop out of the air and land on the ground, with Fitz and Simmons noting that it was highly freaky, before Ward rejoined the rest of the team as they left the area.[14]\n\nSeeking a Suspect[]\n\nBack onboard the Bus, Ward joined Phil Coulson as they asked Skye what she had been able to learn about Adam Cross, with Skye noting that they could easily learn what she had found, since they could track her online activity with the Tracking Bracelet which she still needed to wear. Skye then informed Ward and Coulson that Cross was single and had no children, and came from Pennsylvania, before listing all the areas in which Cross volunteered for his community.\n\nSkye went on to note that Cross made Captain America look like The Dude, which Ward nor Coulson understood. Ward then questioned if Cross ever had a criminal record, to help them find a suspect with motive, to which Skye explained that Cross did not even have a single parking ticket. As Skye insisted that Cross was clean, Ward noted that everybody looked clean on the first search, referring to Skye's recent betrayal, before Coulson insisted that Ward was right and ordered Skye to continue looking into Cross' history to find something.\n\nOnce Skye had left the room, Coulson noted to Ward that he was being extremely hard on Skye, to which Ward insisted that because Skye had lied to them and contacted the Rising Tide while on their mission to rescue Chan Ho Yin, she still had to earn their trust back. Not disagreeing, Coulson noted that Skye's research into Cross was a good start, before ordering Ward to put all of this new information onto their server, so that Melinda May could take a look at it once she had finished interrogating Justin about what he knew about Cross' death.[14]\n\nFinding a Second Corpse[]\n\nAs a second electrostatic anomaly was discovered by Leo Fitz, Ward got into the S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV as they drove towards a farmhouse in the centre of the anomaly. They they approached the location, Fitz informed the team that the anomaly had let out a massive pulse before vanishing. Arriving at the farmhouse, Ward stepped out of the SUV first with his gun drawn, looking for any threats, before he and Phil Coulson prepared to enter the farmhouse, only to find it locked from the inside.\n\nWhile Ward and Coulson discussed using the roof's window or using the SUV to break down the door, Melinda May simply kicked down the door, as they all stepped inside, with Ward leading the way with his gun still drawn. However, they soon discovered the corpse of Frank Whalen, who was floating in the air and had a puncture found on his head, identical to Adam Cross. Believing that Whalen was murdered by someone, Coulson had then immediately ordered Ward to go back outside and look for anyone who could have caused this, noting that they could not have gotten far.\n\nHaving checked the area, Ward soon returned and informed Coulson and May that he had been unable to find any evidence of any footprints or vehicles on the roads nearby. Coulson ordered Skye to have satellite surveillance on the area, before Skye informed Coulson's Team that Whalen and Cross were both volunteer firefighters at the Wrigley Fire Department, and had been responders during the Chitauri Invasion of New York City. Ward took all of this new information as evidence that they were looking for a killer who was targeting that firehouse.\n\nWhile Skye, Fitz and Jemma Simmons arrived at the farmhouse to take possession of Whalen's corpse and continue their reseach, Ward joined Coulson and May as they got back into the SUV and drove towards the Wrigley Fire Station to find anyone connected with the deaths of Cross and Whalen. As they discussed how Cross and Whalen were part of a team during the Battle of New York, they noted that this might have something to do with why were had been targeted, to which Ward suggested that it might be a Chitauri weapon that was the cause of their deaths.[14]\n\nConfronting Tony Diaz[]\n\nWard arrived at the Wrigley Fire Station alongside Phil Coulson and Melinda May, as they were greeted by Baker, with Coulson explaining to Baker that they were from S.H.I.E.L.D. and needed to take a look around the station. Ward and May then stepped away, just as Tony Diaz stepped into the room and asked what was going on. While searching the area, Ward was ordered to secure the area by Coulson, insisting that nobody would be allowed in or out.\n\nWhile Coulson confronted Diaz, May discovered that the station was in possession of a Chitauri Helmet, which had been cleaned by Diaz, Adam Cross and Frank Whalen a few nights before, which Jemma Simmons explained meant that they had been infected with a Chitauri Virus. Ward then rejoined Coulson as he was confronting Diaz, realising that he had not killed Cross and Whalen, but was infected with the same virus and would die soon. Coulson then ordered Ward and May to evacuate the station, while he stayed with Diaz to comfort him in his final moments.\n\nWhile Ward and May got all of the other firefighters outside, Coulson continued to stay with Diaz, despite Leo Fitz insisting that he needed to get out, as the electrostatic surge from Diaz was continuing to increase. Eventually, Coulson rejoined Ward, May and the other firefighters, as they witnessed a blast of blue light coming from inside the station, which then vanished, as Diaz died in the same way that Cross and Whalen had died. Following this, Ward stayed at the station, while more backup from S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived to secure the area.\n\nThe following morning, Ward was scanned by Fitz, alongside Coulson and May, confirming that they were not infected with the Chitauri Virus. Ward stood by as Coulson explained to Skye that the other firefighters would be put into quarantine and observed by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s scientists, while also explaining that the Chitauri Helmet would be brought onboard the Bus to be transported to the Sandbox. While Ward stood at the back of the group, Coulson ordered Simmons to find a cure for the Chitauri Virus, in case any of the other firefighters had also been infected.[14]\n\nJemma Simmons' Infection[]\n\nHaving reboarded the Bus, it was soon discovered that Jemma Simmons had been infected with the Chitauri Virus while she had been examining Adam Cross' corpse. With Simmons in quarantine, Ward joined the rest of Coulson's Team as they discussed what to do next, with Phil Coulson noting that, based on the other cases, she likely only had two hours left to find a cure before the virus killed her, and they were three hours away from the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. facility that could help her.\n\nWard then confirmed with Coulson that, if Simmons was unsuccessful in finding a cure, then the electrostatic surge that the virus would create would cause the Bus to fall out of the sky, resulting in all of their deaths. With Skye insisting that they could not just stand around and watch Simmons die, Coulson had then noted that Simmons was the only person onboard the Bus with the skills to find a cure, and that he believed that she would be able to do it in time, as they watched Leo Fitz comforting her and beginning to do everything that he could to help her find the cure.\n\nStepping away, Ward closely watched Fitz and Simmons' efforts to find a cure on a monitor, before he was joined by Skye, who questioned why Ward was not down there with them, to which Ward insisted that they did not need an audience. Noticing that she was attempting to leave alone, Ward invited Skye to stay with him, as they agreed that they both felt completely helpless in this situation. Ward then commented that he had wanted the cause of these deaths to be a person, so that he could fight and defeat them, since this was what he had been trained to do.\n\nWard went on to explain that he knew he could not protect their team from things that he could not see or even understand, like this virus, which was what had left Ward feeling so helpless in this situation. Skye then questioned what they should do next, to which Ward explained that all they could do was wait and be ready to do whatever they were called upon to do, meaning that they needed to get ready for the situation in which they were forced to sacrifice Simmons before the virus caused the Bus to crashland into the sea, which Skye understood.\n\nWith time running out, Ward would come back downstairs, after Fitz and Simmons had realised that they could use the Chitauri Helmet to find substances to find a cure. With Fitz entering the laboratory as well, risking his own infection, Ward watched nervously, as they tested the cure, only to realise that it had also failed, leaving them with seemingly no options left. Accepting her fate, Simmons then asked the team to give her some privacy with Fitz, so that they could say their goodbyes before Simmons enviable death, which Ward accepted.[14]\n\nSaving the Scientist[]\n\nKnowing that they had no time left, Melinda May informed Phil Coulson that they were being contacted by Felix Blake, who was demanding an update on the situation, noting that if Coulson refused to speak to him, then Blake would demand to speak to Ward. Ward questioned what his orders were, as Coulson insisted they were unchanged. However, they were interrupted when an alarm informed them that Jemma Simmons had opened the cargo bay doors and was preparing to jump to her death.\n\nWard immediately ran downstairs, where he leapt down from the balcony and ran towards the open cargo bay doors, finding Leo Fitz desperately attempting to put on a parachute and leap after Simmons. Seeing Ward, Fitz quickly explained that their anti-serum had actually worked and would be able to cure the Chitauri Virus, but Simmons had not realised this and had already jumped from the Bus. Without hesitating, Ward grabbed the anti-serum and the parachute from Fitz and leaped out of the Bus to catch up with Simmons, strapping on the parachute while in free fall.\n\nSkydiving at top speed, Ward saw Simmons through the clouds and positioned himself into a dive, allowing him to fall as fast as possible, as he was able to catch up with her in seconds. Seemingly realising what was happening, Simmons reached out to Ward, as he grabbed ahold of her, and zapped her with the anti-serum, before pulling the parachute just in time, allowing them to gently float down into the sea. While they were floating to the sea, the anti-serum successfully cured Simmons, knocking her unconscious, while Ward held onto her in his arms.\n\nWard and Simmons were eventually rescued and brought back onboard the Bus, where they were taken into Coulson's office, who called their actions foolish, complaining that deal with the Moroccan office to get them out of the sea was extremley difficult. However, Coulson also noted that he was happy that they were both alive, telling Simmons to never pull another stunt like that again, despite it being to save Coulson's Team, with Coulson also noting that he would hate to lose Simmons, before dismissing them both from his office.\n\nHeading back downstairs from Coulson's office, Ward asked Simmons about how she felt after her first time skydiving, to which Simmons insisted she did not want to think about it anymore. Ward then told Simmons that he thought what she did, in attempting to sacrifice her own life to save the rest of their team, was incredibly brave, to which Simmons had then revealed that she had lied about the weight of the Night-Night Bracelet earlier, confessing that it was still an ounce too heavy, to which Ward admitted that he was actually fully aware of this.\n\nWard then also revealed that he knew Simmons and the others had been mocking him, as he demonstrated his own impression of himself, bragging about jumping out of a plane without a parachute to save Simmons' life, much to Simmons' amusement, as she attempted to correct Ward's own impression of himself. They were then interrupted by the arrival of Skye, as Ward took a step back, and allowed them to have an emotional reunion, as Skye immediately embraced Simmons, delighted that she was back onboard the plane safe, thanks to the actions of Ward.[14]\n\nOperation: Overkill[]\n\nWhen the team had a stopover at the installation known as The Hub, Victoria Hand explained that enemy forces had obtained a weapon called the Overkill Device in Georgia, which had the power to wipe out their own missile systems and render S.H.I.E.L.D. defenseless. Ward volunteered for the mission, as did Melinda May; however, Hand said they needed someone who could disarm the weapon so she assigned Ward and Leo Fitz to the mission.\n\nWard entered the assignment watching the back of the inexperienced Leo Fitz. He went in search of his previous contact Uri Dubrovsky, only to learn that Dubrovsky had been killed and another group of mobsters had taken over. They were taken hostage by Marta. Ward suggested various ways they could escape, none of which Fitz liked as they involved cutting off body parts or risking their lives. However, Fitz' technical knowledge came in helpful as he was able to repair the mob's television after a black-out, which earned them a safe trip to where they needed to go.\n\nThe next morning, the pair used a camouflage blanket to hitch a ride on the underbelly of a truck which brought them to the compound. Ward took out the guards and they discovered the Overkill Device. While Fitz disarmed it, Ward learned that Hand had not sent in a rescue team. He tried to convince Fitz to leave before the alarm was sounded but Fitz refused, proudly stating that he was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent just like Ward and just as brave as him. Fitz surprised Ward with his quick thinking, adaptability, and courage during the assignment, they managed to escape when Phil Coulson and Melinda May sent the Bus to rescue them.[10]\n\nDark Past[]\n\nAfter Thor saved the Earth from the wrath of Malekith and the Dark Elves, Ward, along with the rest of the team and S.H.I.E.L.D., proceeded to clean up the mess the battle had left in Greenwich. Any piece of alien technology was taken and stored away with S.H.I.E.L.D.; Ward discovered a piece of Malekith's ship and took it away for storage. Later, they were called to investigate the mystical weapon known as the Berserker Staff, which had been discovered by Norse Paganists leaders Jakob Nystrom and Petra Larsen.\n\nWhile searching for the second piece of the Staff, Ward came across the piece and Elliot Randolph, who the team had earlier consulted about the staff. Ward stopped Randolph from stealing the staff piece but as he attempted to take it from Randolph, the Staff infected Ward with its mystical strength but also brought back a dark memory he had long hidden. As the effects of the Staff continued to affect Ward, his anger rose, causing him to lash out at the other team members. Randolph was locked away on the Bus and questioned, and Coulson developed a theory that Randolph may, in fact, be an Asgardian. He had Ward test the theory by trying to stab Randolph in the neck, and Randolph bent the blade. He revealed he was an ancient warrior who had destroyed the Staff and hidden the pieces across the world.\n\nThe team finally located the final piece of the Staff thanks to Randolph. When Ward and the team arrived, they were confronted by Nystrom, who had beat them to the location. He stabbed Randolph in the heart with a piece of the staff, nearly killing him. Seeing no other choice, Ward grabbed a piece of the Staff and attacked Nystrom. After a difficult battle, Ward defeated Nystrom and the remaining Paganists, while also fighting through his own dark memory, which caused him to collapse at the end of the battle. When Larsen and another Paganist arrived, Ward was exhausted and could barely stand, so Melinda May took the staff herself and defeated the Paganists.[6]\n\nGetting Intimate[]\n\nManipulating Melinda May[]\n\nLater at a bar, Ward apologized to Skye who let him know if he ever needed to talk she was there. As he went to his room, he saw Melinda May with a bottle; after a brief moment of eye contact, she entered her room, leaving the door open, and Ward soon followed. Seeing May as the biggest threat to his mission, he allowed things to get intimate.[6]\n\nSaving Hannah Hutchins[]\n\nWard defended his team again when they were charged with investigating and protecting a woman called Hannah Hutchins from mysterious destructive events happening around her. The team learned the attacks were being done by Hutchins' old friend Tobias Ford, who had become trapped between dimensions. Ward tried to fight off the attacker and could not. In the end, May was able to convince the man to leave Hutchins alone, and Hutchins allowed him to die.[15]\n\nInvestigating Edison Po[]\n\nWard and May continued their relationship, often training together when they were not going to bed together to release stress. They soon learned that a criminal called Edison Po had been broken out of prison with the help of Centipede Soldiers. Seeing the difficulty of their upcoming missions, Coulson recruited the help of Michael Peterson, who had been training by S.H.I.E.L.D. Ward protested but Coulson was sure Peterson would be an asset to the team.\n\nCoulson and Ward went on a mission to investigate one of the Centipede Soldiers who was identified in the CCTV, Brian Hayward. As they drove to the location of Hayward's sister in L.O.L.A., Ward managed to get Coulson to open up about his previous relationship, which included dinners at the Richmond. When they met the sister of Hayward, Ward approached her telling her Hayward had won the lottery and needed to contact them. They traced her call when she called her brother to tell him what had happened, giving them the current location of Centipede.\n\nThe team attacked the location of Centipede and engaged in a battle with the Centipede Soldiers. During the fight, Ward threw himself in the path of a punch intended for May, much to her annoyance. In the aftermath of the battle Peterson was wounded and Brian Hayward was executed by Centipede. Back on the Bus Peterson received a call from Raina that his son Ace had been kidnapped by Centipede. The team met with Raina, and Ward took a position with his sniper rifle; however, the position of the meeting did not allow Ward to see their conversation. When they came back into view, Coulson was being taken by Centipede. Before he could react, a massive explosion seemingly killed Mike Peterson, and Ward was shot in the shoulder while Coulson was taken away in a helicopter.[1]\n\nRescue Mission[]\n\nWard was involved in the mission to rescue Phil Coulson, this first involved the capture of T. Vanchat, a criminal who had connections to Raina. After threatening to throw him out of the Bus, Vanchat revealed vital information about Raina. Victoria Hand took a personal interest in the mission; however, she had a strong distrust of Skye. When Skye tried to hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. Hand ordered her off the plane, she first asked Ward and Melinda May's opinion, although Ward defended her May said she was not of enough use. When Skye was leaving the plane Ward, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons provided her with an untraceable phone to call them, trusting her to do her own investigation.\n\nThis plan was successful and Skye was able to give them Coulson's correct location; however, Hand believed he was in a different location due to her own intel so did not provide back-up. The team arrived at the area together, with some new gadgets provided by Fitz to take out the Centipede Soldiers. Ward engaged with one of these soldiers, and after a long and intense fight, used a Night-Night Bracelet to knock him out. Coulson was rescued by Skye and Raina was captured. Ward and the rest of the team gladly welcomed Coulson back onto the Bus and watched as Raina was taken away to prison by S.H.I.E.L.D.[16]\n\nBad Seeds[]\n\nThe team's next mission took them to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy where Anne Weaver informed them that someone was attacking the students with freezing weapons. Ward was tasked with interviewing the students involved, including Seth Dormer and Callie Hannigan, to learn the truth about the attacks.\n\nThrough his investigations the team was able to learn that the attacks were being done by Seth Dormer and Donnie Gill, the two students who had been injured in the attacks, as they had attacked each other to ensure they were not the suspects. The pair were being funded by Ian Quinn, and they launched their weather machine which caused a super storm; Ward became trapped with the other students in the middle of the storm. The machine was destroyed in the storm and Dormer was killed by a lightning strike and Gill was arrested.[17]\n\nThe Overkill Weapon[]\n\nWard and Melinda May obtained a Chitauri Overkill Weapon and were saved by Phil Coulson, who brought them back to the Bus. They found out that the weapon was Chitauri based and related to Ian Quinn. They traced the origin to France. During the mission, Leo Fitz was captured, but turned on his tracker. The team then saved him and blew up the weapon.[18]\n\nChasing Ian Quinn[]\n\nWard had then assisted his team on other missions with his skills as an undercover specialist. He and Melinda May were teamed up on a mission to infiltrate a train where they had learned an item Ian Quinn had purchased was being moved. Ward was tasked with appearing as a train conductor while the team searched for Quinn's purchase. While he was speaking to May while changing into his train conductor clothes, May revealed that she had told Phil Coulson about their relationship, much to Ward's horror. Ward continued the mission but was attacked by one of Quinn's assassins. He then alerted Coulson and the pair jumped from the train to safety. One of Quinn's guards threw a Dendrotoxin Grenade which knocked them out; when they awoke they believed no time had passed and that the train had simply vanished.\n\nWard and Coulson made their way back to the Bus to try to figure out what had happened. They both, however, had a great deal of trouble operating the Holotable while they tried to research the grenade that was thrown at them. Ward took the opportunity to speak to Coulson about his relationship with May; Coulson warned him that if it ever endangered the team, Ward would be punished by being forced to guard Emil Blonsky's cryo-cell, located at a facility in Barrow, Alaska. They were interrupted by the arrival of their seeming ally Luca Russo who was promptly murdered by Melinda May, who had been tortured by the traitorous Russo.\n\nThe team were able to locate Simmons back on the train and learned that Fitz and Skye had moved to Ian Quinn's Villa, alone. The team attacked the villa to rescue them. Ward arrived and shot Quinn's guards with the Night-Night Guns. Ian Quinn was quickly arrested but was found with blood on his hands. telling Coulson it was dangerous to make Skye go in alone. Skye was later found with two bullet wounds to the stomach after she had been shot by Quinn. Simmons was able to save her life by putting her in a Hyperbaric Chamber.[19]\n\nBack on the Bus, the team began thinking about finding some kind of medication for Skye to save her life. Melinda May tried to comfort him and told him not to blame himself, but he responded by saying he was not blaming himself. May thought he was speaking about blaming Fitz and Coulson, but in reality, he was blaming John Garrett, whom he knew had given the order for Skye to get shot. At the thought of losing Skye, Ward's feelings for her grew as his relationship with Melinda May waned.[20]\n\nRaid of the Guest House[]\n\nThe next day, John Garrett arrived on the Bus asking to take Ian Quinn into custody, Phil Coulson ordered Ward not to allow Quinn off the Bus, this led to a fist fight between Ward and Antoine Triplett, Garrett's new subordinate. However, Coulson and Garrett were able to come to an understanding where Quinn would stay on the Bus until Skye's life had been saved.\n\nThe team traveled to the Guest House where Coulson had been treated for his own injuries, once they arrived they were unable to get through the doors as they did not have the correct passcode. So the team broke in and engaged in a fierce firefight with the guards. Garrett and Ward were able to kill both the guards but soon learned that the base had been set to self-destruct. Coulson and Fitz searched the base to find the GH.325 which had saved Coulson's life, while Ward and Garrett tried to turn off the self-destruct.\n\nCoulson and Fitz were able to find the GH.325 and the team made their escape, Ward took Fitz back to the Bus to give the GH.325 to Simmons. Garrett and Coulson soon arrived just as the base exploded, when Coulson arrived he ordered Simmons not to give Skye the serum but she already had. Skye began to spasm but soon her heartbeat became more regular and she began to recover.[20] As Skye recovered, Ward admitted to her that he blamed himself for her injury, but Skye reassured him by promisin"
