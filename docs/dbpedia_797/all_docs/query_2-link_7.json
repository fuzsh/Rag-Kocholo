What was the first Maiden album you ever heard? \n \nFor me, it was The Number of the Beast, back when I was just 6 years old, the year after its release. My dad and cousins used to play it on their record players, and it seemed equally cool and scary to me at the time. I've always found the artwork of that album particularly fearsome... especially the image on the record itself",
