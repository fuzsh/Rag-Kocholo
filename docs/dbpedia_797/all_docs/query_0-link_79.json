Moonchild\n\n[Smith / Dickinson]\n\nSeven deadly sins\n\nSeven ways to win\n\nSeven holy paths to hell\n\nAnd your trip begins\n\nSeven downward slopes\n\nSeven bloodied hopes\n\nSeven are your burning fires\n\nSeven your desires\n\nI am he, the bornless one\n\nThe fallen angel watching you\n\nBabylon, the scarlet whore\n\nI'll infiltrate your gratitude\n\nDon't you dare to save your son\n\nKill him now and save the young ones\n\nBe the mother of a birth-strangled babe\n\nBe the Devil's own, Lucifer's my name\n\nMoonchild, hear the mandrake scream\n\nMoonchild, open the seventh seal\n\nI count the heads of those unborn\n\nThe accursed ones. I'll find them all\n\nAnd if you die by your own hand\n\nAs a suicide you shall be damned\n\nAnd if you try to save your soul\n\nI will torment you, you shall not grow old\n\nWith every second and passing breath\n\nYou'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death\n\nMoonchild, hear the mandrake scream\n\nMoonchild, open the seventh seal\n\nMoonchild, you'll be mine soon, child\n\nMoonchild, take my hand tonight\n\nThe twins. They are exhausted. Seven is this night\n\nGemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite\n\nSeven angels, seven demons battle for his soul\n\nWhen Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die\n\nOne more dies and one more lives\n\nOne baby cries, one mother grieves\n\nFor all the sins you will commit\n\nYou'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give\n\nA web of fear shall be your coat\n\nTo clothe you in the night\n\nA lucky escape for you, young man\n\nBut I see you damned in endless night\n\nMoonchild, hear the mandrake scream\n\nMoonchild, open the seventh seal\n\nMoonchild, you'll be mine soon, child\n\nMoonchild, take my hand tonight\n\n2. Infinite Dreams\n\n[Harris]\n\nInfinite dreams I can't deny them\n\nInfinity is hard to comprehend\n\nI couldn't hear those screams\n\nEven in my wildest dreams\n\nSuffocation waking in a sweat\n\nScared to fall asleep again\n\nIn case the dream begins again\n\nSomeone chasing I cannot move\n\nStanding rigid a nightmare's statue\n\nWhat a dream when will it end\n\nAnd will it transcend?\n\nRestless sleep the minds in turmoil\n\nOne nightmare ends another fertile\n\nIt's getting to me so scared to sleep\n\nBut scared to wake now, in too deep.\n\nEven though it's reached new heights\n\nI'd rather like the restless nights\n\nIt makes me wonder it makes me think\n\nThere's more to this I'm on the brink\n\nIt's not the fear of what's beyond\n\nIt's just that I might not respond\n\nI have an interest almost craving\n\nBut would I like to get too far in?\n\nCan't be all coincidence\n\nToo many things are evident\n\nYou tell me you're an unbeliever\n\nSpiritualists? Well me I'm neither\n\nWouldn't you like to know the truth?\n\nOh what's out there to have the proof\n\nAnd find out just which side you're on\n\nWhere would you end in Heaven or in Hell?\n\nHelp me. Help me to find my true\n\nSelf without seeing the future\n\nSave me, save me from torturing\n\nMyself even within my dreams\n\nThere's got to be just more to it than this\n\nOr tell me why do we exist\n\nI'd like to think that when I die\n\nI'd get a chance another time\n\nAnd to return and live again\n\nReincarnate, play the game\n\nAgain and again and again.\n\n3. Can I Play With Madness?\n\n[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\nGive me the sense to wonder\n\nTo wonder if I'm free\n\nGive me a sense of wonder\n\nTo know I can be me\n\nGive me the strength to hold my head up\n\nSpit back in their face\n\nDon't need no key to unlock this door\n\nGonna break down the walls\n\nBreak out of this bad place\n\n[Chorus]\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\nThe prophet stared at his crystal ball\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\nThere's no vision there at all\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\nThe prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\nHe said you're blind, too blind to see\n\nSaid you're too blind to see\n\nI screamed aloud to the old man\n\nI said don't lie, don't say you don't know\n\nI say you'll pay for this mischief\n\nIn this world or the next\n\nOh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance\n\nAnd the hell fires raged in his eyes\n\nHe said you wanna know the truth son?\n\nLord, I'll tell you the truth\n\nYour soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire\n\n[Chorus]\n\nListen to me, said the prophet\n\n[Chorus]\n\nCan I play with madness?\n\n4. The Evil That Men Do\n\n[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]\n\nLove is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade\n\nSlept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with\n\nThe slaughter of innocence\n\nAnd I will pray for her.\n\nI will call her name out loud.\n\nI would bleed for her.\n\nIf I could only see her now.\n\nLiving on a razor's edge.\n\nBalancing on a ledge.\n\nLiving on a razor's edge on...\n\nBalancing on a ledge on...\n\nBalancing on a ledge on...\n\nLiving on a razor's edge.\n\nBalancing on a ledge you know ... you know !!\n\nThe evil that men do lives on and on !....[x4]\n\nCircle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems\n\nThe seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.\n\nAnd I will pray for you.\n\n...Some day I may return.\n\nDon't you cry for me\n\nBeyond is where I learn.\n\nLiving on a razor's edge.\n\nBalancing on a ledge.\n\nLiving on a razor's edge you know... you know !!\n\nThe evil that men do lives on and on! [x4]\n\nLiving on a razor's edge.\n\nBalancing on a ledge.\n\nLiving on a razor's edge you know ... you know !!\n\nThe evil that men do lives on and on! [x4]\n\nThe evil !\n\nThe evil !\n\nThe evil that men do...\n\nThe evil !\n\nThe evil !\n\nThe evil that men do...\n\nYeah yeah!!\n\n5. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\n\n[Harris]\n\nHere they stand brothers them all\n\nAll the sons divided they'd fall\n\nHere await the birth of the son\n\nThe seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one.\n\nHere the birth from an unbroken line\n\nBorn the healer the seventh, his time\n\nUnknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds\n\nSlowly unveiling the power he holds\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nSeventh son of a seventh son [4 times]\n\nThen they watch the progress he makes\n\nThe Good and the evil which path will he take\n\nBoth of them trying to manipulate\n\nThe use of his powers before it's too late\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nToday is born the seventh one\n\nBorn of woman the seventh son\n\nAnd he in turn of a seventh son\n\nHe has the power to heal\n\nHe has the gift of the second sight\n\nHe is the chosen one\n\nSo it shall be written\n\nSo it shall be done\n\n6. The Prophecy\n\n[Murray / Harris]\n\nNow that I know that the right time has come\n\nMy prediction will surely be true\n\nThe impending disaster it looms\n\nAnd the whole of the village is doomed\n\nWhy won't you listen to me\n\nIs it so hard to understand\n\nThat I am the real seventh son\n\nYour life or death on me depends\n\nSuffering and pain impending disaster\n\nSouls crying the devil's laughter\n\nHeard the cry of the seventh whistlers\n\nLucifer smiles looks on and waits\n\nI'll take your life in my hands\n\nYour fate your fortune's in my visions\n\nHeed what I say and you'll see what\n\nWhat will be\n\nPlease listen to me\n\nNow that they see the disaster is done\n\nNow they put all the blame unto me\n\nThey feel I brought on a curse\n\nDon't they know that the torment\n\nIt stays with me knowing that I walk alone\n\nThrough the eyes of the future I see\n\nThey don't even know what fear is\n\nDon't they know I'm the one who is cursed\n\nPurgatory beckons souls lost forever\n\nLife after death or heaven hereafter\n\nHeard the call of the seven whistlers again\n\nNow Lucifer laughs hell awaits\n\nI had their lives in my hands\n\nTheir fates their fortunes in my visions\n\nNo one believed in my true prophecy\n\nAnd now it's too late.\n\n7. The Clairvoyant\n\n[Harris]\n\nFeel the sweat break on my brow.\n\nIs it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?\n\nIs this dream or is it now?\n\nIs this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?\n\nI wonder why, I wonder how\n\nThat it seems the powers getting stronger every day.\n\nI feel a strength an inner fire,\n\nBut I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore.\n\nThere's a time to live and a time to die\n\nWhen it's time to meet the maker.\n\nThere's a time to live but isn't it strange\n\nThat as soon as you're born you're dying?\n\nThere's a time to live and a time to die\n\nWhen it's time to meet the maker.\n\nThere's a time to live but isn't it strange\n\nThat as soon as you're born you're dying?\n\nJust by looking through your eyes,\n\nHe could see the future penetrating right in through your mind,\n\nSee the truth and see your lies,\n\nBut for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise.\n\nThere's time to live and time to die.\n\nWhen it's time to meet the maker.\n\nThere's a time to live but isn't it strange\n\nThat as soon as you're born you're dying?\n\nThere's time to live and time to die.\n\nWhen it's time to meet the maker.\n\nThere's a time to live but isn't it strange\n\nThat as soon as you're born you're dying?\n\nAnd be reborn again.\n\n8. Only The Good Die Young\n\n[Harris / Dickinson]\n\nThe demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night\n\nThe wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed\n\nTime it waits for no man\n\nMy future it is revealed\n\nTime it waits for no man\n\nMy fate is sealed\n\nIf I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today\n\nFly in the face of the prophets I mock your morality plays\n\nThe moon is red and bleeding\n\nThe sun is burned and black\n\nThe book of life is silent\n\nNo turning back\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nAll the evil seem to live forever\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nAll the evil seem to live forever\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nMystery madman, a victim of cruel charade\n\nSome innocent pawn in an end game, one more stalemate\n\nIs death another birthday?\n\nA way to kiss your dreams goodbye?\n\nDo the undead live within us?\n\nAnd look through our eyes?\n\nWalking on water are miracles all you can trust\n\nMeasure your coffin does is measure up to your lust?\n\nSo I think I'll leave you\n\nWith your bishops and your guilt\n\nSo until the next time\n\nHave a good sin\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nAll the evil seem to live forever\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nAll the evil seem to live forever\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nOnly the good die young\n\nSeven deadly sins\n\nSeven ways to win\n\nSeven holy paths to hell\n\nSeven downward slopes\n\nSeven bloodied hopes\n\nSeven are your burning fires\n\nSeven your desires\n\nBruce Dickinson: vocals;\n\nDave Murray: lead and rhythm guitars;\n\nAdrian Smith: lead and rhythm guitars, synth;\n\nSteve Harris: bass, string synth;\n\nNicko McBrain: drums.\n\nProduced, engineered and mixed by Martin 'Disappearing Armchair' Birch.\n\nRecorded at Musicland Studios, Munich, Germany.\n\n2nd engineer: Stephane 'The Vardengrip' Wissner.\n\nBernd Mailer, Studio Boffin.\n\nMastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound, New York.\n\nAll titles published by Zomba Music Publishers Ltd.\n\nSleeve concept and design: Derek Riggs and Rod Smallwood.\n\nSleeve illustrations: Derek Riggs.\n\nPhotography: Ross Halfin.\n\nPackaging: The Complete Works.\n\nIron Maiden are managed by Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor for Sanctuary Music.\n\nLyrics reproduced by kind permission.\n\nIron Maiden F.C.:\n\nStamped addressed envelope / international reply coupon to Japan, Shinjuki-ku, Shinjuki, Yubinyoki-Dome, Tokyo 160.\n\nRest of world: 12 Deerpark Road, Wimbledon, London SW 19 3TU.\n\nThanks to totoadlat for correcting tracks ## 1, 5, 6, 8 lyrics.\n\nThanks to semn007 for correcting tracks ## 1, 7, 8 lyrics.\n\nThanks to rafael.martinelli, loothers, totoadlat and others for correcting track #2 lyrics.\n\nThanks to reekorl for correcting track #3 lyrics.\n\nThanks to danielespejelperez, totoadlat, lucas_gonzaga for correcting track #4 lyrics.\n\nThanks to daniel.cabral for correcting tracks ## 6, 7 lyrics.\n\nThanks to edvlieland, totoadlat for correcting track #7 lyrics.\n\nThanks to blkmesa666 for correcting track #8 lyrics.\n\nSubmits, comments, corrections are welcomed at webmaster@darklyrics.com\n\nIRON MAIDEN LYRICS"
