        "text": "FALLING IN REVERSE makes anthems that provoke and inspire. Unnervingly ahead of the pack and yet always decisively right on time, their mix of bombastic declarations and intimate confessions connect with diverse crowds worldwide.\n\nPopular Monster, is their first full-length album in over seven years; an eleven song masterpiece, featuring five tracks that are bonafide smash hits, (three certified gold and one certified 2x platinum). Not ones to rest on their laurels, the six new tracks are incredible, and feature unexpected collaborations with some of the music industry hottest hitters.\n\nWith hit songs like Popular Monster topping the rock radio charts and earning them their first 2x platinum single, the bands momentum only grows stronger, and their live performances are big reason why. From playing top festivals, to arena opening stints for Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed, to co-headlining with legends like Papa Roach, and now selling out headline shows in arenas across the country!\n\nThis album package will include a 24-page, 4 color booklet with lyrics and imagery from their YouTube Trending music videos, sized for the formats CD and LP.\n\nIndie Exclusive - Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first great recording star of gospel music and among the first gospel musicians to appeal to rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll audiences. Later being referred to as \"the original soul sister\" and \"the godmother of rock and roll, Sister Rosettas influence is omnipresent. Long overdue, Tharpe was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence in 2018. This set from 1960 has plenty of variety, lots of sincere feeling, and high levels of musicianship from the unique performer. Highlights include \"He's Got the Whole World In His Hands,\" \"Didn't It Rain,\" \"The Gospel Train\" and \"Down By the Riverside.\" The album was remastered for vinyl by Dave Gardner and pressed at Furnace Record Pressing on Oxblood color vinyl for RSD Essentials.\n\nThere's a lot of existential stuff in these songs, says Amos Lee. If you really listen to what's in between the lines, there's a lot of grappling with your place in the world, grappling with loss. There's a lot of grappling with the balance between bailing out the boat and rowing at the same timethe experience of writing music and playing songs while trying, as we all are right now, to make sense of a world that feels like it's changing really quickly. On his eleventh studio album, Transmissions, singer-songwriter Lee continues to expand his sonic range while sharpening his closely observed lyrics that squarely address death, aging, and love. The force behind such acclaimed albums as Mission Bell and Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song, ever since his gold-selling 2005 debut Lee has been known for his association with a long list of collaborators and touring partners, from Paul Simon to Zac Brown Band. For the new project, he craved a return to an old-school style of recording, working with his longtime band in a studio in rural Marlboro, New York that was built by drummer Lee Falco and his dad out of reclaimed wood from an old church (its exactly what youd think a studio in upstate New York should be, notes Lee). Playing live on the floor for long hours, in close quarters, they were able to capture the albums twelve songs in less than a week. I really wanted us to be all in the room, making music together, listening to each other and responding to each other, says Lee. In this age where you can do everything at home and fly it in, theres something really beautiful about getting in a room and starting at the top, the drummer counting in the song and everybody just playing. I would call it vulnerability.\n\nIndie Exclusive - Lee Mendelson Film Productions (LMFP) is thrilled to announce the release - from recently rediscovered tapes - the complete Vince Guaraldi soundtrack to \"It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown,\" the timeless 6th animated Peanuts® special, from writer and creator Charles Schulz, director Bill Melendez and producers Melendez and Lee Mendelson.

The band have warmed up fans with standout single 'Everything's Beautiful' and what awaits is a masterfully crafted album from a band who are firing on all cylinders and totally in sync. LHCC is a mix of their classic neo-soul sound, fused with jazz, soul and rock - which is on full display on their cover of the Jefferson Airplane classic 'White Rabbit' and a fan favorite from their live shows, 'Cinnamon Temple'. The album also includes a feature from BMO from the cult classic animated series Adventure Time (Cartoon Network/Adult Swim). Throughout the campaign the band will build a bright and vibrant world for fans to dive into, with games, artifacts, mazes and all other matter of zaniness that one can expect from Hiatus Kaiyote. Just ahead of album release the band will be embarking on a 19 day US tour, which includes stops at Montreal and Toronto Jazz Fests and Electric Forest."
