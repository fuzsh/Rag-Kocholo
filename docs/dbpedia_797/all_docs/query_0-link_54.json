        "text": "GIVING THE WORLD\n\nNEWCOMER ZAIN IQBAL SAYS THAT STARRING IN BBC’S SERIES A GOOD GIRL’S GUIDE TO MURDER HAS BEEN MORE THAN JUST A GREAT WAY INTO THE INDUSTRY. FOR THE MANCUNIAN ACTOR, GETTING TO PORTRAY A ROMANTIC LEAD AS A SOUTH ASIAN MAN CARRIES A LOT OF MEANING AND OPENS A PATH FOR HIS PEERS TO BROADEN THE NUANCED REPRESENTATION IN THE MEDIA FURTHER. THE SHOW, BASED ON A BEST-SELLING MYSTERY NOVEL BY HOLLY JACKSON, FOLLOWS THE STORY OF PIP, AN INQUISITIVE TEEN INVESTIGATING THE MURDER CASE FROM HER TOWN AND CREATING A BOND WITH IQBAL’S CHARACTER, RAVI, IN THE PROCESS. A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE SHOW’S RELEASE, WE CAUGHT UP WITH IQBAL TO TALK ABOUT THE SERIES’ APPROACH TO DIVERSITY, GROWING UP WITH THE SOUND OF WESTERNS AND BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS BY HIS CO-STAR, EMMA MYERS.\n\nA Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is your breakout role. What drew you to this story?\n\nI mean, first of all, for someone that looks like me, this part is gold – we don’t get opportunities like these often. I’m sure that many Asian actors were after this project because it’s a sweet romantic lead and we’re not [usually] written like that. So just in terms of representation, this feels quite big.\n\nEspecially since the representation doesn’t seem to be the point of the show. The diversity is simply there.\n\nYeah. It’s weaved in there but it’s not about that. The show touches on a variety of subjects – race, drugs, sexual assault, and the way that kids our age deal with it. Also, it’s just a well-written story, in my opinion.\n\nWhich aspects of Ravi’s personality did you relate to the most?\n\nI think I’m quite a generous person – I can give the world to people. And I feel like I can relate to Ravi in that way. That said, I’ve not been through it like Ravi has. He’s had a hard time and a lot of struggle. But despite that, he’s kind, sweet, humble and friendly.\n\nAs this is your first big role, did you feel a lot of pressure throughout the process to get it right?\n\nI thought I would but there was so much going on that I didn’t really have the time to think or worry about it – I just wanted to get it done. Also, having the rest of the cast and crew believe in me gave me the confidence to think I could do it.\n\nThe show’s lead, Emma Myers, plays a teen who’s obsessed with solving a mysterious case. In your personal life, are you a fan of watching crime shows?\n\nHave you seen the first season of True Detective with Matthew McConaughey?\n\nI did!\n\nI loved everything about that! The story, the performances, the interrogation room scenes mixed with flashbacks to the scenes of crime… I find it fascinating to look at all the links and details and see how they all tie together.\n\nA Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is based on a best-selling book which a couple of years ago blew up on TikTok. Have you ever found a book you loved through the app?\n\nI’m not really on TikTok but Emma did recommend me a book called Tender Is the Flesh, and I heard that it was quite big on there. I loved it! It’s based in this post-pandemic dystopian world, where people resort to eating other humans.\n\nWhat are your earliest memories of movies or TV shows that you have connected with as a child?\n\nThe first thing I remember seeing in the cinema was Spiderman 2 with Tobey Maguire. Also, there’d be a lot of classics on in the house all the time, you know, the classic movie channels you get on Sky. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one that I remember so well. You know those classic Western movies sounds?\n\nYes!\n\nThey were the soundtrack to my childhood in a way.\n\nLast one – what’s your hidden talent? Any skills you’re proud of?\n\nWell, I’m double-jointed so I can bend my arms both ways! I’m also a left-handed Gemini which apparently is a common thing for us. I’ve met a lot of Geminis that are left-handed and I think they’re very special people. Including me.

BASED ON THE BEST-SELLING NOVEL SERIES, MYERS PLAYS PIPPA, A DETERMINED AND SELF-APPOINTED INVESTIGATOR WHO IS SET ON RESOLVING HER TOWN’S TRAGIC MURDER CASE FOR A HIGH-SCHOOL PROJECT. WHILE SHE HAD LITTLE TIME TO NAIL HER ACCENT AS A BRIT, EMMA ADMITS THAT SHE AND HER CHARACTER HAVE A LOT MORE IN COMMON THAN ANY OF THE ROLES SHE PREVIOUSLY PLAYED, WHICH PROVED TO BE MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR HER AND LED HER TO READ THE BOOKS 4 TIMES, IN TRUE BOOKWORM FASHION. WE SAT WITH EMMA TO DISCUSS THE COMPLEX THEMES OF THE BBC AND NETFLIX, AND HOW LORD OF THE RINGS AND K-POP GROUP SEVENTEEN HAVE INFLUENCED HER LIFE.\n\nHi Emma, nice to meet you! How are you doing? I hear you’re in Dublin.\n\nI am in Dublin! Shooting season 2 of Wednesday right now, so super busy but very excited.\n\nHow's the filming going?\n\nI can tell you that I love the script so much this season, there’s definitely gonna be a lot of fun stuff to look forward to, but that’s about all I'm allowed to say or else I’ll end up on the news.\n\nWere you a Tim Burton fan before getting onto the project?\n\nOh yeah! Huge Tim Burton fan. I grew up watching his movies and I feel like he was a huge part of my childhood. When I heard that he was doing this, I was so excited. And flash forward to booking it, it's just kind of a crazy dream come true, shooting with a director of films you’ve been watching since you were a kid, it’s such a crazy weird feeling.\n\nAt just 22, you’ve got an array of acting gigs and roles already. How did you fall in love with this craft?\n\nI was a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I loved fantasy movies and books, and I remember that Peter Jackson used to release the behind-the-scenes videos from the shooting of the Lord of the Rings movies –I remember watching them and being like, “Ugh, that’s what I wanna do. That's what I wanna do so bad!”. So that’s been plan A from the beginning. Being an actor is always what I wanted to do. And it's worked out so far.\n\nBeing an introvert, how has acting helped you?\n\nI’m definitely still introverted, but I think acting, especially because your job is being surrounded by people 24/7, helps to have better people and communication skills. You always have to be talking to someone you don’t know because it's part of the job. It’s definitely helped with my social skills a little bit.\n\nLet’s talk about Netflix’s upcoming show A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder. You play the role of the series’ protagonist Pippa who we often watch solo exploring gloomy and forbidden areas. Do you have any favourite moments that you shot?\n\nThe ones that stuck with me were the Hastings party from the first episode, the scene in the chemistry lab with Max and Naomi, and then all the scenes that we did in the police station with Dan Da`Silva and Elliot – those were so fun to shoot.\n\nYou had to change your accent, how did you prepare for that?\n\nI had a dialect coach. Honestly, I didn’t have long to prepare because I joined so late. We had about 2 weeks before filming to get the accent down, which was the trickiest bit of this job. But we worked with my dialect coach together twice a week, and she was always on speed dial if I needed anything. I also had an entire English cast and crew who could help me out if I needed help figuring out how to say certain things.\n\nI thought it was interesting that whilst your family life was getting out of control, one thing that Pip always kept on track was resolving the case. How would you say Pip has used the case as a form of escapism?\n\nI think at first, it starts off as just a school project, she’s not really thinking that much about it, she’s thinking it’ll be interesting enough to get into a university. But as it goes on and she gets more involved in it and she finds out that the people she knows in real life are actually involved in it, that’s when it starts to become more personal for her. She definitely uses it as an escape from her own personal life, but really, she’s not escaping much because she’s just as involved in that as she is in her own family life. I don’t think it does her any good.\n\nShe’s so intrinsically linked to the murder, so she’s not escaping from anything in the end. And with what happened to Barney, I think it was at that moment that Pip realised the danger and the gravity of the situation she’d gotten engaged in.\n\nI think you can feel so far away from something and think, “This can never happen to me,” until it does. And that’s where Pip runs into some trouble as she thinks it's so far from her, it's whatever, it's not a big deal. Yet she ignores all the warnings she gets and then ends up losing her dog as a result of it. And this is a turning point for her, realising that this is very real stuff happening and at any given time it could turn onto her. That is a very pivotal moment and I think the show portrayed it in the right way.\n\nThe show depicts and explores the topics of grooming and suicide. Why do you think it's important to discuss these issues on television in a teen show?\n\nWell, I think that a lot of the time TV shows and movies struggle not only with bringing light to situations, but they sometimes end up glorifying it. We didn’t wanna do that in the show. These are very real things that happen and people think, “Oh, that only happens on TV or in movies,” and you think it’s never gonna happen to you till it does happen to you, and I think it's good to have these things you show people, real situations that happen, and don’t take them too lightly. They’re very serious topics and it's good to draw attention to them without glorifying them for entertainment.\n\nAnd the way they approached it was done in a way where it made sense, without coming off as gimmicky. How would you say playing Pip challenged you as an actor?\n\nPip is a lot different to any character I’ve played before, she’s a lot more like myself. And maybe you think it should be easier to play somebody that’s a lot like you, when actually, it is a lot harder. It definitely challenged me, this whole script has challenged me, this job has challenged me. It challenges your mindset, your work ethic and how much you actually want to do this job. But it’s been such a great time, I’m so glad I did it. I’m glad for the things you have to think about when you play these sorts of roles. Pip has really brought me a lot in my life to think about.\n\nThe show was filmed in the UK. Did you experience any culture shock when moving to the UK? What did you miss the most about the US?\n\nI miss ice, man, in my water. I miss iced drinks. That is the thing that kills me. It gets hot in the summer, I mean I’m from Florida so it's not as hot, but it does get hot and nobody drinks over here. And when you ask, they look at you like you’re an idiot, when it’s literally boiling outside.\n\nYou’re into K-pop – who’s your ult and how did you get into it?\n\nSeventeen is my ult. And I got into K-pop… Well, when me and my best friend were 15, back in 2017, there was a cover of Charlie Puth by Jungkjook and Jimin, and I remember watching it and that opened the door. We got into Seventeen and it's been going strong ever since.\n\nI feel like that era of BTS was everyone’s gateway into K-pop, like when DNA came out…\n\nExactly, I think when DNA came out that was the first K-pop music video I’ve ever watched, me and my best friend were like, “ What is this, what’s going on?”\n\nAnd then you start to watch all the lives and you can’t stop obsessing…\n\nYou watch all the shows and all the fun YouTube compilations. I remember I was doing the K-pop stuff when you couldn’t get the English translations for anything, you had to wait a week. I’m a veteran.\n\nWhat’s the best advice K-pop has taught you?\n\nI wouldn’t say K-pop in general, I would say Seventeen specifically. They are such genuine people, I’ve met them and they are the sweetest guys ever – they really go to show you that no matter how famous you are, no matter what you do for a living, you just have to be kind to everybody. You can tell that they're such genuine people and they treated me with such kindness, and I would definitely say that Seventeen has been the most authentic group I’ve encountered.\n\nBut I guess that's why we as fans latch onto certain groups, because of their humility and kindness, it’s rare to see that in the industry.\n\nWho’s your ult?\n\nIt varies, but I’ve always loved 2NE1 and Sistar.\n\nOh, I love 2NE1 and Sistar!\n\nAre there any other projects or roles that you’re getting into?\n\nI just finished filming Minecraft with Jack Black and Jason Momoa. We had a great time filming that, of course, if you’ve ever played Minecraft, you know that it’s based on a video game, I’m really excited about that.\n\n…\n\nDiscover the full story in our upcoming HIGH ROMANCE FW24 Issue - release next End-October.\n\n& PRE-ORDER your issue.\n\nInterview by Gabrielle Valda Colas\n\nPhotography by Emilia Staugaard\n\nFashion by Steven Huang\n\nCasting by ImageMachine CS\n\nEIC Michael Marson\n\nHair by Hiroki Kojima at Caren using Sam Mcknight\n\nMake-Up by Maria Comparetto\n\nPhotographer’s assistant Andrea Brandt\n\nStylist’s assistant Daisy Hewett\n\nBRACE YOURSELF\n\nIT’S GAME ON FOR ANTHONY RAMOS, THE PUERTO RICAN-BROOKLYN RAISED ACTOR WHO’S GONE SO WORLDWIDE THAT IT’S HARD TO PIN HIM DOWN FOR A ZOOM CALL THESE DAYS. THE BREAKOUT STAR OF MANUEL-MIRANDA’S STAGE HIT HAMILTON AND MUSIC ROM-COM IN THE HEIGHTS, WHOSE APPEARANCES ALSO INCLUDE PLAYING LADY GAGA’S BESTIE IN A STAR IS BORN AND HUMAN PROTAGONIST NOAH DIAZ IN TRANSFORMERS: RISE OF THE BEASTS, CANNOT BE STOPPED. NEXT, HE’S LITERALLY WHIPPING UP A STORM AS JAVI IN THE DISASTER SEQUEL MOVIE TWISTERS AND TAKING THE MUCH-LOVED ANIMATED CHARACTER BOB THE BUILDER TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. WE GOT ON A CALL WITH RAMOS TO TALK ABOUT CHASING DREAMS, FIRST LOVES AND FLYING COWS.\n\nLet’s talk Twisters, the follow-up movie to the ‘90s hit flick, in which you play Javi, a storm chaser. I imagine working with director Lee Isaac Chung was the big draw for you, as he’s brilliant at building the heart and soul between characters. How did that play out for you with this movie, working alongside Glen [Powell] and Daisy [Edgar-Jones], in helping to shape your character?\n\nBefore we started shooting, I really felt that I was going to learn so much from Isaac and grow as an actor, and he was going to bring the best out of all of us, and he confirmed that to me times ten! He can make a big movie feel small, like an indie, treating it with love and attention and caring about the characters so deeply, like you do when you’ve got no budget, because the characters are really all you’ve got to hold the movie, no special effects and all that.\n\nJavi, my character, wasn’t on the page when I first read for the film as I was auditioning for the part of Tyler originally. Then after reading for Javi, who used to be called Nathan, I realised he wasn’t as prominent on the page, not like he’s ended up being in the movie, as I told Isaac that I could do something really dope with the part, and we could expand the role and explore more ideas and possibilities for the character.\n\nWell, this movie may have an indie heart, but it’s got a blockbuster budget with all the CGI-filled action. What was it really like being part of storm chaser culture in Tornado Valley?\n\nWe were right there, slap bang in the middle of it all, with weird things happening like the sky would suddenly turn green, and when I first arrived in Oklahoma for a costume fitting, I was sitting with Isaac having dinner, and suddenly the windows started rattling in the hotel. I looked at him and said, “Yo, bro, is that normal, that shit is rattlin’.” He looked at me and said, “Yeah, I guess so”, and then he’s offering me water like, “Still or sparkling?” It was so crazy!! [Laughs]\n\nDid you hang out with real storm chasers too?\n\nYes, and we had some on set, one guy called Sean, who works for Oklahoma University, where they have the biggest meteorology set up in the US. Meeting him was the first time outside of this movie we’re making that I realised people do this for a living, you know, being a storm chaser, this is his actual job, collecting data and waiting around, sometimes for days, weeks, until something happens.\n\nI guess when a flying cow appears, that’s the signal a storm is coming.\n\nHaha! When the cow starts flying, you know some shit’s going down! Follow the flying cow! [Laughs]\n\nHad you seen the original ‘90s movie, with flying cows, before you signed up for this follow-up?\n\nI only saw the original a month into filming, as we all watched it at a movie theatre the director rented. Our movie is just as scary, terrifying in parts but thrilling, and heartfelt and fun too. I love that we get to be the second part in this franchise, and I hope we get to make more, and explore how far and deep we can go into this storm chasing world.\n\nYou’ve played a mix of characters now throughout your career, from theatre to film, and along the way there must have been great mentors who helped build your confidence as an actor and performer?\n\nMentorship in my life has been so pivotal, from my teachers to my uncle who I’ve just been hanging with today, just connecting with family and people that know and love me and really have my best interests at heart, that feeds my soul, and I can bring it to my work.\n\nAnd being part of seeing your community and culture represented on screen too, with starring in Hamilton and In the Heights, that must feed the soul and give you the drive to keep perfecting your craft and the confidence to keep achieving your goals?\n\nI’m Puerto Rican from New York, Bushwick, the hood, and the odds of someone like me achieving what I have are like zero. To be able to do this for real and give hope to kids like me is so important, and to have role models like I did when I was 10 years old. I had actors like Rick Gonzalez and a few others to look up to, who played the lead role in different things, and they gave me hope to think maybe I could do that. I’m in a pool of Latino actors that are expanding the industry, and I feel really blessed to be a part of it all.\n\nSpeaking of giving young kids hope, you have a great relationship with Opening Act NY, who provide free theatre programs for underprivileged kids to achieve their dreams. What about bringing success stories, like your own, to the big screen yourself, from behind the camera?\n\nYes definitely, I think directing is next for me, I’ve been really feeling a desire to do it, it’s the next big mountain I want to climb. I’m actively looking for stories that I connect with and I’m really looking forward to diving into a script.\n\nAnd are there directors you’ve really enjoyed working with who have inspired you with their own process?\n\nTotally, I want to work with Spielberg again, he’s produced three movies I’ve been in, and Reinaldo Marcus Green and Jon Chu. Karena Evans is also a young director I worked with on a music video, I think she’s incredible, and I want to do something more longform with her.\n\nYou’re also producing and voicing the lead character in the big screen debut of Bob the Builder; you must be excited about this fresh take on such a beloved animated character?\n\nIt’s so dope to be a part of this, and I’m super involved with the soundtrack too - I’m already talking to my friends in the industry to come up with songs for it. To be able to play, voice and reinvent this lead character that everyone’s grown up with over the years is amazing, as he’s been one thing for so long. Now it’s Bob the Builder 2.0, let’s take him to another level!\n\nWhat about Bob’s get-up, he’s been in those same dungarees and shirt for so long, he needs a style revamp. Can we fix it? “Yes, we can!”\n\nWell, he’s gonna look like a builder, not like he just walked off the runway, but trust me, Bob’s gonna look fly in this movie!\n\nYou mention music, and of course besides theatre and movies, you’re also a musician. Is music your first love? What are your earliest memories of making music?\n\nIt started in junior high school, I was in a group with my friends, and we would sing songs by a group called The Temptations in school assembly, and it was my first introduction to performing. I also did improv shows during the holidays with my cousins for our families, like you do! and that’s how I ended up in musical theatre school eventually.\n\nThen you got a record deal after taking the world by storm in Hamilton, and later became a mentor on The Voice US. This is a show you auditioned for originally, and there you are, as the star giving advice to hopefuls. Life moves in mysterious ways, right?\n\nIt’s wild. I waited out in the cold to audition for that show and the bottoms of my feet were hurting so much for months because I wore the most uncomfortable shoes in the blistering chill of winter! I didn’t even make it past the first round, and all these years later there I am being a mentor for Reba’s team, and the guy we mentored eventually won, it’s crazy how things go.\n\nArtistically, what does music give you that acting does not?\n\nWhen you go into a studio, you have complete control over what that song becomes, nobody tells you what it should be, and you start with a blank page but leave the studio with something, a melody or the words. There’s a part of music that’s mine, my vision, my story, I can sing it and express myself how I want, unless you’re writing for someone else, then you try and tap into their heart and whatever’s going on with them. So, it’s cool being a songwriter but also an artist, and having those two things be equally synonymous and separate when they need to be, and often the inspiration for me, comes from helping other people. It’s dope, with acting you get a script and there are so many other opinions and control, but with music it’s about what you want to say and how you want to say it.\n\nIf you had to choose a song that describes where you are in your life right now, what would it be?\n\nWow, what a great question! Adoption Song by Brandon Lake sums up where I feel I am in my life right now. Accepting all the things that God has told me I am, and not believing anything other than that. I also wrote a song called Don’t Wait for Yesterday, it might be my next single release, and that title is a message to myself, and everyone really.\n\n…\n\nDiscover the full story in our upcoming FW24 Issue - release next End-October.\n\nInterview by Kate Lawson\n\nPhotography by Doug Inglish\n\nFashion by Andrew T. Vottero\n\nCasting by ImageMachine CS\n\nGrooming by Galaxy San Juan\n\nSENSE OF BELONGING\n\nIT’S HARD TO TOP ALIEN EROTICA-ENTHUSIAST AS YOUR BREAKOUT ROLE, BUT TANYA REYNOLD’S TURN AS TV HIT SEX EDUCATION’S SCI-FI-LOVING LILY IGLEHART WAS THE SPRINGBOARD FOR EVEN MORE EYEBROW-RAISING CHARACTERS SUCH AS THE PRETENTIOUS AND VULGAR MRS ELTON IN AUTUMN DE WILDE'S JANE AUSTEN ADAPTATION, EMMA; AND AS CHARLIE IN THE TV SITCOM, I HATE YOU, IN WHICH SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE, “GET READY TO HAVE YOUR MIND AND TITS BLOWN.” DON’T EXPECT ANYTHING LESS THAN SPIKY IN HER NEXT APPEARANCE AS LOYAL-BUT-NOT-REALLY SERVANT LICISCA IN THE PERIOD DRAMEDY FROM NETFLIX, THE DECAMERON, SET IN THE 14TH CENTURY AND LOOSELY BASED ON THE COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES BY BOCCACCIO. REYNOLDS IS ALSO NO STRANGER TO THE STAGE, HAVING STARRED IN SCENES WITH GIRLS AT THE ROYAL COURT, AND A MIRROR IN THE WEST END, FOR WHICH SHE RECEIVED AN OLIVIER AWARD NOMINATION FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS. HERE, SHE TELLS US ABOUT PLAYING OUTSIDERS, SHABBY CHIC AND THE BOOK THAT CHANGED HER LIFE.\n\nIn The Decameron, the characters within it are like the free-thinking punk rockers of their generation, but aside from all the debauchery, it’s a story about a time and place and the human stories behind it. Would you agree?\n\nYes, because it’s about a group of supposedly civilised people and what happens when they all believe they’re going to die quite soon, and having lost so many loved ones, you see some of them have this desperate scrambling for power, the need to survive at whatever cost; whereas others are like, “Fuck it, we’re all going to die, so I’m just going to do what I like in the time I have left!” As a group, through all the varied circumstances that brought them together, and their desires and fears, they realise at their heart, they’re not that wildly different from one another.\n\nYou play Licisca, she’s a devoted servant, but quite cunning and outrageous and maybe the heroine of the day. How would you describe her?\n\nShe’s spent her whole life working as a servant, devoted to this family and doesn’t know any other life. Gradually, the family die from the plague, and she’s left with her least favourite member, Filomena, having lost the only person she loved, Eduardo, the household master. She and Filomena travel to the villa [Villa Santa] and feeling like she has nothing left to live for and sick of being a servant, she makes a snap decision and then ends up on this journey of freedom. She’s unshackled from the chains that have bound her and she embraces that wholeheartedly. She’s mischievous, cunning and outrageous with a heart of bronze, and she’s real, in that at her core, she’s a good person, but she’s messy and complicated and makes the wrong choices and can be selfish, just like anyone!\n\nWas it fun to play her, because there’s a myth that female characters have to be likeable… and she is, but she’s also unpredictable…\n\nI loved playing her! It was so much fun for that exact reason, because she’s not likeable all the time, and I think that’s what makes the character, because nobody is likeable all the time. Human beings are messy and complicated and sometimes hypocritical and contradictory, and we make mistakes, and we all have spiky and soft sides, and she’s all those things as she’s had a tough life. She can be defensive and out for herself and has her quirks, but she’s a good person, and I would trust her. She doesn’t mean to hurt anyone unless they’re a baddie!\n\nWe’ve seen this format of a bunch of rich people living in mansions with servants before. But this puts an entirely new spin on it for modern audiences with some interesting ideas and personas. It makes you think and then rethink what’s going on, did you feel that reading the script?\n\nI loved when I was reading the script, how you feel you’re going in a certain direction, and then the script would do a hard left turn, and suddenly you end up somewhere you really weren’t anticipating at all. I think that’s what is exciting about the writing and the show as you feel you’re maybe getting one thing, and you end up with many more things you weren’t expecting. I think on the surface the show can look like a kooky period dramedy, but it goes so much deeper.\n\nThe stories of these individual characters and their relationships with each other deliver some great moments and dialogue. Were there any pairings you could relate to or resonate with personally, in terms of the dynamic?\n\nThere’s a moment in episode five, where Filomena says to my character, “Why aren’t you scared,” and Licisca says, “Of course I’m scared, I’m terrified”, and Filomena replies, “You’re taking up all of the fear, there’s none left for me.” There is an energy in that conversation that I think a lot of people will relate to; when you’re with someone who is very raw with their emotions and you end up appearing a lot more stoic than you feel, having to counter that person’s terror and anxiety by being rational and calm, even though you don’t really feel that way.\n\nIt’s obviously set in a time around the black death, and now we’ve all lived through a pandemic and experienced that cabin fever setting in, this take on Boccaccio’s short stories will be even more relatable with modern audiences.\n\nYes, we’re all freshly familiar with that feeling of tip-toeing on the verge of madness, when you’re forced to remain indoors and it’s terrifying and people are dying. This show takes a bunch of rich people to a villa in the countryside to wait it out, who try to make something positive out of a terrifying thing, turning it into a holiday almost, because they have the means to. I think people will relate on many different levels.\n\nI couldn’t help but think that Lily, your much-loved character from Sex Education, would’ve absolutely loved being stuck indoors, probably doing cosplay or drawing erotic alien comics.\n\nOh, Lily would’ve used the pandemic to write some incredible graphic novel about a virus wiping out the entire human race, and lone survivors going up to Mars and starting an alien society up there, she would’ve been perfectly happy sitting in her room! [Laughs]\n\nLily was always portrayed as the outsider, but she ended up being the show’s real eccentric. Do you find it more interesting to play the outsider in a role, as they’re always more complex and challenging?\n\nI love playing outsiders; someone who doesn’t feel comfortable in certain situations or environments, and outside of whatever society deems “normal”. I’ve always felt drawn to characters like that, on the outside looking in, and that’s how I’ve felt all my life, and I think everyone feels that way at some point. In fact, I think feeling like an outsider is completely normal, and there’s so much to mine from that experience of feeling like a fish out of water.\n\nIs that maybe why your Instagram bio says, “awkward hugger”?\n\nHaha! I am an exceptionally awkward hugger! I feel like that description tells you everything you need to know, I’m that person where the greeting is going to be awkward and everything else following from that greeting will be awkward!\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that, as you’re so personable in real life, so I wanted to ask about theatre, because your play A Mirror, is like The Decameron in that the characters are not what they seem, with many layers. Whether it be a black comedy, or period drama, most of the roles you’ve played have engaged with people politics in some way. Is there a role or genre you’re hankering to try?\n\nI don’t know if there is a particular genre, but it’s always about the script and if it’s exciting, or it thinks outside the box, or it’s a story that’s not been seen before, those are the things that really draw me in. I’ve been so lucky with the projects I’ve done, particularly A Mirror and The Decameron, as I had not seen anything like them, and couldn’t imagine what the final product would look like, as they were so well-written. That’s what made me want to go on the journey with both those characters and see where they end up.\n\nBetween stage and screen, do you prefer the intimacy and instant reaction you get with a live audience?\n\nI love the instant reaction and there’s a lot about theatre that does suit my natural sensibilities more, like being in control of your own performance, putting blood, sweat and tears into it for the duration of the play, and then you go home, and you come back the next day and you can try it a bit differently, or rectify things that didn’t go as well the night before. I love that process of feeling like you’re constantly working on the same role and there’s a lot I love about working on screen too, but I think lots of actors start off in theatre, and that’s where their heart is.\n\nSpeaking of hearts, which playwright is closest to yours?\n\nSam Holcroft, who wrote the play A Mirror, She’s not only an extraordinary playwright and a kind, brilliant, funny, wonderful human being, but it’s fate that we worked together, as at the end of my drama school training, I chose one of her early and obscure plays as my showcase monologue for agents and casting directors, so it’s a beautiful 360 that I got to work with her.\n\nWhat about other passions outside of acting, I know you’re a bookworm, thanks to those brilliant recommendations you share on Instagram. What were your formative books, and are there any you feel helped you begin the journey you’re now on in life?\n\nQuiet by Susan Cain. It only came into my life a couple of years ago, but it really altered the way I see myself and the world for the better. It was the first extensive thing I read that said it’s ok to be quiet and introverted and that those qualities are strengths, whereas I had previously spent my life feeling that those things are weaknesses and I had to be a very different person. Now, thanks to that book, I realise having the ability to be quiet and listen rather than talk, is a superpower.\n\nYou’re a brilliant photographer too, with very mood-evoking imagery. How did you develop your interest and what’s your camera of choice?\n\nI got into it because I was a teenager with all sorts of feelings and I didn’t know how to express them, and I knew I wanted to do it creatively. My aunt is an amateur photographer who inspired me, and I had this tiny point-and-shoot digital camera, and I started taking pictures and just loved it. As I got older, I’ve just bought better cameras and eventually found this film camera in a second-hand shop and fell in love with shooting film photos. I love the slow pace and thinking about every frame and the excitement of getting them developed.\n\nIs fashion a big interest for you? You really rocked that Bardot-style gown on the red carpet at the Olivier Awards, it was stunning!\n\nThank you! Well, I like fashion, but not in a way that’s “fashionable”, most of my clothes are second-hand and from places like Beyond Retro and none of them fit me properly, which is the way I like it. For my 30th birthday, I was thrown a surprise party where everyone had to come dressed as me, and it was a rude awakening, to say the least! [Laughs] Everyone looked really shabby, and I turned up, and having got over the initial shock of seeing all my loved ones together in one room, my next thought was, why does everyone look so terrible, and realised after, yes, that’s how I dress! So erm, fashion…. Let’s say, I know what I like.

AND NOW, SHE’S OFF AGAIN, FAR, FAR AWAY, LIGHTSABRE’ING HER WAY INTO THE NEW STAR WARS PREQUEL SERIES, THE ACOLYTE ON DISNEY+, AS JEDI APPRENTICE JECKI, WHOSE LOOK MORE THAN CHANNELS 1970S DAVID BOWIE, ALBEIT A SHORTER VERSION WITH MINI HEAD HORNS.\n\nTHE 19-YEAR-OLD TALENT JOINED US ON ZOOM TO TALK ABOUT MAKEOVERS, PASSION PROJECTS AND WEIRD SONGS THAT SUM UP HER LIFE RIGHT NOW.\n\nSo, we’re in the High Republic era of Star Wars, where the Jedi are the most powerful, and you’re playing Jecki Lon, a Jedi Padawan apprentice. Did Leslye (Headland) the showrunner give you more creative freedom to explore this character as it’s a time in the Star Wars story that hasn’t been explored before?\n\nLeslye’s a very humble and collaborative director and very good at navigating others’ opinions and ideas, in a generous and thoughtful way. She’s good at saying no to you if an idea doesn’t fit the story, but also saying yes, and listening, as I was always giving my thoughts on why I thought Jecki might be saying or thinking something, so that was great to be in that space and be able to do that.\n\nIt also made it more fun as an actor to be able to play a role in this time that people haven’t seen before.\n\nAs Jecki’s a young Jedi, is the character’s arc going to be a coming-of-age story, thrust toward their purpose and fate in the Star Wars universe?\n\nWell from what we’ve seen so far, in Jecki’s life, she’s been living in this temple for like 17 or 18 years and then she’s on this mission with her other Padawan friends and not aware about the enormity of what’s to come, and suddenly finds herself in this big situation, and we’re talking about the dark side. I hope I’ve done a good enough job with this role that it’s visible with Jecki that her life as she knows it, is changing.\n\nObviously, I’m going to ask you, probably for the millionth time like every other journo, about the Bowie similarities. Did you envision the character like that when you read the script?\n\nWell, Leslye had initially told me when I first met with her that I’ll probably be an alien in the show. So, when I got to rehearsals and went into my costume fitting, and saw my character design for the first time, I looked human, like myself, just with short hair. So, I thought, they must have canned the alien idea. But then later I had my make-up test, and they had blocked out 2 hours for it, and then I saw all the prosthetics and wigs and horns, so that’s when I realised, yes, you are an alien! When Leslye and I saw my whole completed look together, we both instantly thought, David Bowie!\n\nThen you blasted a Bowie playlist on set to get you in the mood?\n\nCompletely, because I realised the look really helped informed me who Jecki was in a way. She’s such a specific type of alien human hybrid, so having that little fun Bowie crutch to lean on made her more enjoyable to play.\n\nYou do also realise you’re going to be a Halloween costume and dress-up for fan conventions now forever!\n\nWell, I hope so, brilliant!\n\nI imagine working with prosthetics is great because you don’t have to have that fear and self-consciousness like actors do around what you visually look like on screen after finishing a film?\n\n100%, especially as a young woman, your looks are always a topic of conversation, so having my vanity completely stripped away from me was so refreshing. I didn’t need to worry about how I looked or sounded because Jecki was a completely different person, well, alien, and totally not me. Everything that was characteristic to me was covered up, I had no eyebrows, it wasn’t my hair. It’s very easy as an actor to be vain and think about yourself, but there’s none of that in playback when you have prosthetics on, so I could just inhabit the character and not think about myself at all.\n\nThis series is also unapologetically female-centric with female producers and a female lead and cast. So, I don’t want to ask what excites you about breaking down those Star Wars barriers, but what excites you about breaking down those Star Wars barriers? [Laughs]\n\nWe unusually had a lot of heads of department that were women on this show, which is rare in crew, from costumers and first ADs to the camera crew and obviously Leslye writing and directing. It was so fun and incredible as a young woman to watch all these women behind the camera in positions of power, all navigating this typically male-dominated world and industry. I receive a lot of scripts, and the role is always for an “empowered woman” which is a character breakdown you just don’t get for men, and so with this show, one of the big things that drew me to it, was that it’s full of women in it and behind the scenes, but we didn’t have to acknowledge that, we didn’t need to make a point about it, it’s about the characters and the story.\n\nSpeaking of wielding power, you’ve worked on some great projects so far, what kind of role are you craving next, if you could veer off-road into uncharted territories?\n\nI really want to do Indie films, and I did one after I wrapped Star Wars actually. There’s a different and fun energy on set and it works differently, and there is a real camaraderie between the actors and crew, because you don’t have the money and support like you do with making a big blockbuster movie. I love the kinds of characters in Indies too, they’re gritty or they can be so fun or comically odd, I mean, I love the movie Three Colours Blue and Gena Rowlands in A Women Under the Influence, that type of character would be amazing to play.\n\nYour parents are both actors too, so growing up, did they inspire your rich love for the big screen?\n\nMy Mum had this rule that if I watch one bad film, I should make up for it by watching two good ones! [laughs], like watch a silent film and then an arthouse one or something! But both her and my dad told me I should watch Singing in the Rain, and after I saw it, that was my favourite movie for years, and it really inspired my passion for acting. As a kid, when I watched films, I didn’t see actors, I saw characters, but for the first time, I was so impressed by Gene Kelly as an actor, and Make ‘Em Laugh was the greatest feat of choreography, it impressed me so much. That film opened my eyes and world to actors and acting. I then watched Some Like It Hot and fell in love with Jack Lemmon and thought he was a genius. I learned more about the acting process from my parents too, as I was always around in their rehearsal rooms and my mum was also my acting coach for the first few years on set focusing just on my performance, like a school of acting just for me!\n\nAnd you’re bilingual, as you were born in Madrid. So, what about doing a Spanish language movie in the future?\n\nI would love to, I’ve never worked in Spanish, and Hispanic cinema and TV now is doing such an incredible job, and it’s so exciting as a Spanish person to see how it’s growing and evolving and being consumed internationally.\n\nA lot of young actors like yourself are also moving more into producing their own projects, and setting up production companies, so that they get more of the opportunities they deserve – is that something you would like to do, to connect more with your craft while maybe amplifying issues or ideas you care about deeply?\n\nI’ve always been a creative person, and acting is just one side of that. I like writing and making short films with friends and writing poetry and seeing art. I would love to be behind the camera more and direct in the future too. I’m already producing a project later this year and I’m in preparation for that. It’s fun to be in the position where I can have a say in the script and create a world around it.\n\nYou mention art, does that interest play out in your writing or ideas for projects then?\n\nYes, with acting I know how they would have shot a scene or whatever, but with art it’s the unknown for me, imagining how something came to be, the creativity and story behind it. I like to draw from art and photography when I’m writing and planning, the colours, or moods, as it’s a great visual tool. I go to lots of exhibitions with a friend who is studying the history of art, and my appreciation of art and sculpture, comes from travelling a lot with my family, we would always visit museums and galleries.\n\nI would imagine music is also a great tool.\n\nTotally, I can’t exist without music! All my friends are musicians and I have playlists for all the characters I make as it helps with thinking about what that character would be listening to. So much that I do when I’m writing is informed by the music I’m listening to at that time, and it also helps me to process the world around me.\n\nWhat’s on your playlist right now?\n\nI’m listening to a lot of Jeff Buckley and then I’ll mix it up with Charli XCX or Billie Eilish. I have such a wide taste in music, I can go from the most niche and weird thing ever to the hottest track on Spotify! I love watching people walking around with headphones on and trying to imagine what they’re listening to, music can really change and effect you and the way you carry yourself, it’s always a way in as an actor.\n\nOk, so give me one song that perfectly sums up where you are in your life right now?\n\nThe Enchanted Sea by Martin Denny. It’s a weird choice, but it’s quite stimulating for my brain, the sound is playful and mysterious, like something’s brewing, undertones of this unknown story or world. It speaks to me being 19 years old, I can relate to it, because my world is growing and its unknown right now, but I’m starting to understand it more, which is part of life, but being so young I probably think I know more than I actually do!\n\nAnd that takes us right back to Star Wars, and Jecki’s own life journey through the light and dark, the unknown. Bowie’s Starman will probably be her song choice though.\n\nExactly!

Months of preparation studying the tastes, passions and demons allowed Valois to embody another side of the iconic French designer. Whilst it took him some time to re-adapt to normal life outside of the YSL aura, the actor explains that he lost the taste for acting, having been so consumed by this insurmountable role. Now more than ever, he is ready again to take on new challenges, go back to the front, and explore other creative ventures, both locally and internationally. BTB sat down with the Valois to discuss his interpretation of YSL, as well as the complexities of fame, loneliness and sophrology.\n\nHello Arnaud, how are you?\n\nWe just finished the press tour. It's been a really great marathon. It started with the Cannes Series Festival, where we presented the series as a world premiere. And then it just kept going. We sensed a lot of expectations for the series, so we gave it our all.\n\nFashion Week is on at the moment, do you have a busy schedule?\n\nYes! Right now, I'm on my way to the Louis Gabriel Nouchi show.\n\nWhat made you want to become an actor? It's a complex job that involves cutting into a lot of different parts of yourself.\n\nI think it was a desire to play people other than myself. There was also a narcissistic desire, I really enjoyed it straight away. The idea of being watched, of putting yourself on stage, of playing other characters. But also to fight shyness and to learn how to be with other people. Strangely enough, no matter how good you feel on stage, you're not always at ease with people in real life. That's the paradox of being an actor.\n\nIt hasn't always been easy. What made you want to continue?\n\nWell, actually, I stopped. I started when I was 20, stopped when I was 26 and then started again when I was 27. What made me want to start again was when I was offered the role of Nathan in 120 Battements Par Minute. That really changed everything.\n\nAnd it was a worldwide success. How did you feel at the time?\n\nVery lucky, very surprised. We felt a certain responsibility for the story we were telling about these courageous people, most of whom are now dead, and I don't think we really expected the global impact it was going to have. We knew that there would be an audience for this film, but not to that extent.\n\nI read that when you put aside your desire to be an actor, you explored a career as a sophrologist. What did sophrology teach you about acting?\n\nI think it helps me with my acting because I'm more connected to my heart. But mostly, it helps me with the other moments like when I'm not shooting. It's easier for me to regain my energy, to find my centre, my focus in all of this. So that I don't get consumed by acting.\n\nHow did you prepare for the role of Yves Saint Laurent? Both physically and mentally?\n\nI prepared by immersing myself completely in it. In all the biographies, extracts and archives. There was Raphaëlle Bacqué's book... well, it was about Karl but it was also about that time period. It was fascinating. I watched a lot of the films he liked to watch, and the music he liked to listen to. And, of course, his work: his fashion shows. I tried not to immerse myself in the work of Pierre Niney and Gaspard Ulliel, who were remarkable and I'd seen the films when they came out, but I tried not to get hung up on that. To try and find something else. Maybe even put some of myself into Monsieur Saint Laurent to make it stand out even more and offer something different.\n\nIn the series, you play another face of Yves Saint Laurent, different from the one we've seen in cinematic biopics. How do you feel about the reception of this Saint Laurent?\n\nI was very scared when I was approached for the role, and asked myself what I was going to offer that was new. And then when I read the script, I had access to the first three episodes and I understood straight away that it was going to be something completely different. What the series wanted to show about Saint Laurent, and also about Karl, was really to show the part of humanity in them with all its complexity of being human and not just them as great fashion icons, geniuses and so on. To be in something much closer to them, closer to their torments, to what makes them tick. From the get-go, I felt that there was something powerful to tell. But even so, the fact that I was following in the footsteps of such great performances by such great actors put a lot of pressure on me. And for the first time, I worked with a coach, who was my teacher at Cours Florent. I had the intuition that he was the best person to prepare me for this because I didn't know how to tackle such a complex character, so far removed from myself, on my own. I think I've done roles... Not necessarily characters that resembled me but that I understood very well. We really got to the heart of the scenes to bring out what he really wanted to say at the time. We also worked with Pascaline Chavanne, the costume designer, who was another very important element in finding the gestures and the postures. All the costumes were made to measure and I'd never had the chance to do that before, so that was another very important part. I never experienced a character like that, with such collegial effort between the costumes, hair by Sébastien Quinet and make-up by Valerie Chapelle, the chief make-up artist. All that was really important for me in finding my Saint Laurent and really digging into it.\n\nWere you interested in fashion before starring in the series?\n\nI've always loved fashion. All that work for a 20-minute show. But I know that behind the scenes is not always a perfect world, far from it. There's something fascinating in the representation that it gives, and a costume, a garment, can also help me in promoting, obviously in a role, but even in my job as an actor, it gives me power, strength. For me, it's a creative work that can be likened to a certain form of play.\n\nThere's a line in the series where Karl says, \"Paris is a constant lesson in humility.\" I read that you're from Lyon, how did you feel about Paris when you first arrived here?\n\nI think for him it's special because he's German and at that time, being German in Paris in the ‘50s must have been quite a thing. For me, Paris was more like a breath of fresh air, everything was possible, everything became possible, everything became great. The anonymity that it gave me was very galvanising at the start. I was dreaming of leaving my city, so it was different.\n\nThere's another moment when Yves is at a party surrounded by friends, admirers and collaborators, and he throws himself at Karl and asks to let him “buy” Jacques, this humiliating scene where he pleads his misfortune, his loneliness… What does it represent to you?\n\nI didn't experience it as a humiliating moment, I really experienced it as a moment of despair, of reaching out... It's a real pivot for the character who's sinking into something lost. They are all in a cage, a golden cage of course, but in a cage. And this love that Jacques refuses him is unbearable for him. He dreams of leaving. It's a great moment of sadness... And then he ends up in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIt's interesting how this series highlights loneliness, and perhaps gives us another dimension on fame and adulation.\n\nIt refers to a celebrity in power. I think...I saw Diam's documentary Salam where she explained that being at the very top is cold, lonely, there are wolves. I'm not really convinced that being at the top of the pyramid makes you happy. And I'm not sure that the human nervous and cerebral system is designed for it either. Extreme fame, extreme power, I don't think it's possible to resist the temptations of that.\n\nWhat kind of projects would you like to work on next?\n\nI actually needed a long time to get out of this role. To even want to act again. It was so powerful. It was so incredible that it took me a good six months and now I've been reconsidering the offers. There are other things in the pipeline. I've been concentrating on myself and then on my personal artistic work. Right now, I'm working on a second short film as a director that I'm going to make this autumn. That's going to come back, but it took me a long time to even want to read a script. I found everything bland compared to what I'd been through during the almost 7 months between shooting and preparation. Then there was this experience with Dan Levy's Good Grief, which came out in January on Netflix, which also opened doors.\n\nSo now you're keen to explore more roles internationally?\n\nYeah, it was a really great experience making Dan's film in English, I really liked the way he worked, very professional, very focused on the game. We have a bit more of a troupe approach in France, even on a film or series shoot we have a much more familial approach. I also liked the very professional international side. I don’t have expectations – there are things that are coming up and I welcome that with a lot of pleasure and a lot of gratitude.\n\nInterview by Gabrielle Valda Colas\n\nPhotography by Emmanuel Giraud\n\nArt Direction by Flavie Gonin\n\nFashion by Thomas Turian\n\nGrooming by Ludovic Bordas\n\nSet Design by Frédérick Assez\n\nPhotographer’s assistant Pierre Drouin\n\nFIRE IN THE BELLY\n\nIN HOUSE OF THE DRAGON, HARRY COLLETT HAS GOTTEN USED TO SOARING THE SKIES ON TOP OF A DRAGON. BUT FOR HIM, THE CHALLENGE ISN’T MAKE-BELIEVE - QUITE THE OPPOSITE, REALLY. THE YOUNG ACTOR IS DEDICATED TO MAKING THE FANTASTIC LAND OF WESTEROS AS HUMAN AS POSSIBLE. THE CHALLENGE ISN’T LABORIOUS FOR HIM; HE SEES IT AS AN ESCAPE. HAVING STARTED HIS CAREER AT JUST SIX YEARS OLD, COLLETT IS STILL WAITING FOR HIS JOB TO BECOME JUST THAT, A JOB. SO FAR, THE ACTOR STILL HAS THE FIRE IN HIS BELLY, EXCITEDLY PONDERING THE FUTURE OF HIS CAREER. JUST LIKE HIS CHARACTER, HE’S STILL LEARNING THE ROPES, FINDING HIS WAY THROUGH AN EXCITING YET INTRICATE WORLD. WE CAUGHT UP WITH COLLETT TO DISCUSS HIS EARLY START IN THE INDUSTRY, THE CHALLENGE OF SCREAMING GOATS, AND TO TEASE THE MONUMENTAL SECOND SEASON OF HIS HIT SHOW.\n\nYou’ve built your career from such a young age. What was it like to be a professional child actor?\n\nI wouldn't call myself a professional. Even now. I was six when I started. I didn’t have the easiest time in primary school, so I picked up dancing at an early age. It would help me take my mind off a bad day. Once, I did a show at a shopping centre and an agent spotted me and went up to my parents and just told them he thought I could be good at acting. My parents sat me down and I thought I could give it a go. At my first audition, we went up to London and made a family day out of it. We were waiting in a lobby; I remember being super nervous. I turned to my mom and just said “I don’t know if I want to do this.” My parents have always been quite understanding so we started to walk out. Right as we were at the door, they called my name. It was just one of those deciding moments. I went back and I got it, it was my first role, in the Billy Elliot musical. From there it all just snowballed, it’s an escape for me, I genuinely love acting.\n\nSo, acting doesn’t feel like a job to you at all?\n\nWell, all my friends work in finance. I always see that as a “real” job. Of course, there are aspects of what I do that can be draining, like the long hours. But it’s still hard to believe this is an actual job because what I do really is just dress up as different people for a living and take a step into their lives. At the minute I ride dragons for a living… How could I ask for another job? It’s weird for me because I love it so much, it’s hard to call it work. I wake up every morning excited to go to work.\n\nYour career started in the West End, is that something that you’d return to eventually?\n\nI think eventually yeah. But for now, I’m enjoying the film and TV aspect. I enjoy this way of shooting. I would like to do a play; I’ve never done a playbook before. Musicals I feel like I’d revisit later in life.\n\nI was snooping through your Instagram, and I found out you are also a DJ. Do you miss expressing yourself musically?\n\nI think you have a point there. I think acting and music are very different but they both come from a similar creative route. What I love about DJing is the pure enjoyment. I don’t do it for the money. When you drop a song and see someone going crazy, it’s a feeling I can’t describe but it is similar to being in front of an audience doing musical theatre… I guess I never really thought of that.\n\nWe have to discuss House of the Dragon – did you know that you were stepping into that role when you auditioned for it?\n\nNot at all. The first two self-tapes I did just said “Untitled HBO series” and the character was called Jack. It could be anything. I only found out two days before the last audition. You can imagine, from an untitled HBO series to a spin-off of Game of Thrones, that’s quite the jump. It got me stressed out. [Laughs] When I did end up getting it was the same sort of pressure, it never goes away. I’m in a spin-off of Game of Thrones, I have to do really well here. In the first season, you never know how it’s going to go. Obviously, we read the scripts, we knew it was beautifully written. But you never know how it’s going to go down with the fans.\n\nBut it did go very well, it was received so well by the audience. Did you feel like the pressure was renewed for season two?\n\nI don’t know actually… I think I’ve become more confident. There were things that I spotted in season one that I changed, there’s always room for improvement. In the first season, you’re new to everything: to the sets, to the crew, and to the directors. And within that time from season one to season two you build a relationship with the cast and with everybody else that gives you a different sense of confidence. When I go on set, I don’t think of the millions of people who are going to watch the show. Obviously, you have to consider that, but you can’t stress yourself out.\n\nThe show is very dark, both in its story and its atmosphere. How is the energy on set?\n\nNot at all, it’s a party on set, the complete opposite of what the show is. Which is lovely because if it was like the show all the time, it would be upsetting. Everyone gets along, it’s such a nice atmosphere. It might be very cliché but there’s not a horrible person on set.\n\nWhat can we expect from your character this time around?\n\nI think for Jace specifically, this season he goes through a lot of real feelings. His arc is essentially him turning from a boy into a man. Even in a fantasy world, his journey is so human. I’ve had fun this season figuring out how to communicate things like grief. People need to relate to him amongst the massive battle that’s happening both inside and outside of Jace’s body.\n\nHow do you think people are going to react to the first episode of the second season?\n\nI think we’re kicking things off right away, there’s no wasting time. I’m still gobsmacked by the end of that first episode, and I’ve seen it now about five times. It’s a beautifully done episode and, obviously, everybody’s performances are so good. You get a good sense of what the stakes are for the rest of the season.\n\nYou’ve mentioned that you prefer acting on set versus on location. What is it about it that you prefer?\n\nI mean, the sets are just so cool. [Laughs] Obviously, when you’re on location, there are beautiful landscapes and it's amazing to see, we were just up in the mountains in Wales. But when you’re in one of those rooms and it’s completely silent it’s just something else. The last time we were on a mountain there was a goat behind us that was just screaming so loud. We were filming a sad scene so that just throws you off. You get to be immersed in the studio.\n\nYou’ve established a pretty solid range, from musicals to fantasy. What else do you see yourself doing?\n\nI’ve always said that, at the end of my career I want to be able to say that I’ve done everything I could do. When I was younger, my dad used to make us watch an old-school movie every week. I started to look up to people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, actors who have done so many different genres and types of characters. I want to experiment, to throw myself off the deep end.\n\nInterview by Pedro Vasconcelos\n\nPhotography by Debora Brune\n\nFashion by Steven Huang\n\nGrooming by Josh Knight\n\nProduction by Debora Brune & Lea Bütefisch\n\nPhotographer’s assistant Lukas Kraus\n\nStylist’s assistant Nathan Fox\n\nYEAR OF THE DRAGON\n\nTHE WORLD HAS BEEN WAITING, GAGGING EVEN, FOR THE SECOND SEASON OF HOUSE OF THE DRAGON, HBO’S SPECTACULARLY FIERY GAME OF THRONES SPIN-OFF. AS OF THIS WRITING, THERE’S NOT MUCH KNOWN ABOUT 22-YEAR-OLD SURREY-BORN ACTOR TOM TAYLOR’S ROLE IN THE SHOW, EXCEPT THAT HE PLAYS LORD CREGAN STARK, THE CURRENT LORD OF WINTERFELL IN THE HOTD TIMELINE.\n\nIF FANTASY EPICS AND CGI DRAGONS AREN’T YOUR THING, THEN YOU CAN CATCH TAYLOR IN HIS PREVIOUS INCARNATIONS, AS JAKE CHAMBERS IN THE DARK TOWER, TOM FOSTER IN THE BBC ONE HIT SERIES DOCTOR FOSTER AND AS LUTHER JONES IN THE NETFLIX MOVIE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.\n\nTHE RISING YOUNG TALENT ZOOMED IN FOR A CHAT WITH US ABOUT WHY HE’S A NATURAL FIT FOR THE HOUSE OF STARK.\n\nSo, Tom, how did you land the role in HOTD? Were you a GOT fan before getting the gig?\n\nI was 11 or 12 years old when GOT came out and it was such a massive thing culturally, and I was always hearing about it from my friends, as we never had the channel it was shown on at home. So, when I started preparing for this role, I caught up with the GOT world! I did watch the first season of HOTD though, and I was completely in love with the show.\n\nYou’re joining S2 as Lord Cregan Stark. How would you describe your character?\n\nHe’s the Lord of Winterfell during that period that we see him in the show, and he’s got a lot of pressure on his shoulders, and he’s very loyal. I won’t give away any more than that, haha!\n\nOk, so what was it that jumped out to you right away about Cregan’s story arc? Was there a specific thing that you were like, “OK, I could hold onto this”?\n\nEverything really stood out to me, and I completely love the Starks anyway, and I have a kind of connection there with the North, as my family is from up North, my dad’s family is from Manchester and the surrounding areas. So, I’ve always grown up with that gritty Northern influence in my life, and it’s such an amazing opportunity to play a Stark in this series, and I’m up for wherever the journey will take me.\n\nNo spoilers there then! So, did you get to wield any weapons for the role, and were any parts of it challenging?\n\nI would say the weight of the sword on my back was something to get used to, it was extremely heavy! When I went into the show, I thought those kinds of things along with the costume, would be made for an actor you know, easy to use or wear on set, but no, it’s totally the real deal! But that really helped me to get into the right frame of mind to play the part and put myself in that period all those years ago.\n\nYou mention costume, so that affected how you approached the physicality of a scene?\n\nOh yeah, completely. Just from the costume fitting I could feel myself transforming into Cregan Stark, and when I looked in the mirror once I was dressed up, it totally made me carry myself in a different way.\n\nHow else did you get into the character mindset then?\n\nIt’s interesting, before you take on a role, especially one of this size, you can go into a tunnel of overthinking everything, from the way a person moves to the inflections in the way they speak. It really comes together on the day, when you’re on set, in the moment and you’re no longer thinking about it, you’re just there and it all becomes real. I think having watched Sean Bean play Ned Stark in GOT was also a big influence on me.\n\nThere’s a scene in the Winterfell in this new season, and just being on that set itself, with all the snow around me, and everyone else in costume, it was just so extreme. It all really helped me fall into that Stark mindset, the Lord of the North, and become my character, it’s also so much fun too, like an actor’s dream!\n\nWhat was it like to be involved in a production of this size and scale too?\n\nI feel like it was the perfect time for me to be involved in a project this size. Like with most actors, it’s been an up and down journey for me, starting off in TV shows like Casualty and then I played young Uhtred in The Last Kingdom, and I’ve done other TV and films too. I feel now that I’ve got all the necessary tools to really do this role justice and give it what it deserves.\n\nSo many young U.K. actors like yourself were in the first season of HOTD, did you speak to any of them before taking this on, for advice?\n\nThe process of joining the show was quite quick for me, and by the time I got there, everyone was pretty much settled in and had been filming for a while before me. So, I came in and was kind of like, “Er hello”, [laughs] but everyone was so nice, and I was lucky enough to meet most of the cast and we all got on well. It’s a little weird though being part of this other family; I recall Harry (Collett) who plays Jacaerys Velaryon asking me, “Are you ready to be part of this crazy world we’re all in!?”, and I definitely am.\n\nDo you feel any pressure at all in waiting for the fans’ reaction to Season 2 and your portrayal of Cregan?\n\nOf course, yes, I want the fans to be happy, it’s an honour to play such a character and there’s nothing worse than fans not liking what you do! But it’s all about being in your zone and trying not to feel the pressure, and just have fun and enjoy what you’re doing. I can’t wait for people to see it, and I’ve had great experiences in the build-up so far.\n\nSo, with your family being from up North, what was their reaction when you got the role – did you ask them to address you as Lord of the North from now on?\n\nHaha! They couldn’t believe it, and people up North have a great sense of humour, it’s quite dry. Whichever project I’ve done before, they always downplay it, but this is the third time I’ve played a role with a Northern aspect to it. I think maybe they don’t realise how much my upbringing has influenced my ability to portray those sorts of characters.\n\nAnd is your family creative, any performers among them?\n\nWe’re all performers! [laughs] but none of them went to drama school or anything, my dad used to be in the navy, but he would always be coming home singing after the pub, he was a right performer! My brother plays the guitar well and I play the drums, and we would always be putting on a performance, showing off and annoying the neighbours!\n\nYou’re a music producer outside of acting too, how did that all come about?\n\nIt was Idris Elba who helped me, as he was working on making music in between filming on a project we were on. I kept asking him about the software he was using, and then I started making my own stuff. It’s something I want to continue doing, and pursue more seriously later, as I’m focused on acting for now, but I would love to make music for other people. I love the idea of a collaboration at some point too, I just like being creative.\n\nIs that why you designed your own fashion line too, what happened to that then?\n\nI was 17 years old, and it was called Tom’s Yard because I was drawing illustrations in my garden, and I wanted to print the drawings onto T-shirts. I only got so far on the collection, and then got scared and ended up not releasing anything! But maybe someday there will be a music and fashion collaboration of sorts, that would be cool.\n\nSo, speaking of Idris (Elba), you’ve worked with some great actors so far. Which do you think has been the most interesting to observe in terms of your own takeaways for perfecting your craft?\n\nI do observe a lot, and I learned a tremendous amount from Tom Hollander, particularly his professionalism. He would finish work and then go back to his hotel room and learn lines and he gave up a lot of his free time at weekends to go over scenes with me, to help me more than anything. That was such a great lesson to learn, to be able to give yourself to others in this profession and have empathy. One other thing I’ve noticed as an actor, is that I’ve always been surrounded by older people in terms of who I’ve worked with, so that’s really helped me to mature in the way I approach things and just being professional on set.\n\nWhat type of role would you like to tackle next then?\n\nI’ve always wanted to play Fagin in Oliver Twist…\n\nWell, you’ve got the hair for it, maybe grow it a little longer!\n\nExactly! [laughs] I’ve always loved him, he’s a right old twisty miser, and I like the way he sings too.\n\nAre there any real-life figures you’d like to portray?\n\nFunnily enough, I do get a lot of people saying I should do Kurt Cobain, maybe one day!\n\nMaybe Kurt Cobain as Fagin the Movie! So, what’s next for you this year?\n\nHaha! Well, I’m off to Cape Town for just over a month to work on a project, which is where I filmed The Dark Tower with Idris. I was 14 years-old back then and with my dad who was looking after me, so now I’m an adult, it’s going to be a new experience! The character I’m playing is so completely different to Cregan Stark too, and it’s so exciting. I just want to keep challenging myself, and the weirder a role the better. I never want to be comfortable or be typecast.\n\nInterview by Kate Lawson\n\nPhotography by David Vail\n\nFashion by Steven Huang\n\nHair by Josh Knight at A-Frame Agency using The Ordinary\n\nPhotographer’s assistant Emmet Banahan\n\nStylist’s assistant Damini Rehal\n\nFINDING A VOICE\n\nPLAYING AN ANIMAL WAS ALWAYS IN THE CARDS FOR OWEN TEAGUE – AFTER ALL, THE FIRST CHARACTER THAT HE WAS OBSESSED WITH AS A KID WAS THE PRINCE TRAPPED IN A FURRY BODY FROM DISNEY’S CLASSIC ANIMATION, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. NOW, THE AMERICAN ACTOR IS GETTING TO REVISIT HIS CHILDHOOD FASCINATIONS IN KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES – THE LATEST TAKE ON THE CLASSIC FILM FRANCHISE. THANKS TO PERFORMANCE CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY, TEAGUE INHABITED THE ROLE OF NOA, A YOUNG CHIMPANZEE GOING ON A LIFE-CHANGING JOURNEY OF GROWTH. SHORTLY AFTER THE MOVIE’S BIG PREMIERE, WE CAUGHT UP WITH TEAGUE TO CHAT ABOUT GOING TO APE SCHOOL AS PART OF HIS PREPARATION AND HOW NOA’S TRANSFORMATION MIRRORED HIS OWN EVOLUTION INTO THE CHARACTER.\n\nHi Owen! Recently, you taped your very first talk show appearance with Jimmy Kimmel. What was that experience like?\n\nIt was good – very strange and very surreal. [Laughs] Honestly, I don’t remember much of it because I kind of blacked out. But apparently, it went well. The whole crew was super lovely to me, they were like, “Jimmy’s great, he’s gonna make sure that it goes well, don’t worry about it, kid.”\n\nI watched it and there was a lot of ape jokes. [Laughs] Has that been happening for most of this press tour?\n\nYeah, this is my life now, lots of ape jokes. People call me a monkey and that’s okay. Something that has been really interesting throughout this experience is that you’ve got a ton of people just screaming your name and screaming at you to smile. When I was standing on the red carpet during the LA premiere, I was like, “Oh, this is what it feels like to be a chimpanzee at a zoo.”\n\n[Laughs] Absolutely!\n\nI was like, “Yeah, I get it.” This is the experience of a zoo animal. You have loads of people with cameras staring at you and yelling things.\n\nThey want you to perform for them.\n\nYeah. I remember there was one guy in LA, who was like, “Gimme a big smile!” And I just started cracking up because it was suddenly so absurd to me that here I am playing a CGI chimpanzee, and now I feel like an actual chimpanzee. It was bizarre but all you can do is laugh.\n\nIt’s a very singular experience, for sure. [Laughs] I read that Beauty and the Beast was your favourite movie when you were a young kid. What did you love about it?\n\nI was three years old when I saw it for the first time. And the Beast was really fascinating to me. It was the film that made me want to get into acting but I didn’t really know what I could do with that at the time because I understood it was an animated character. And it wasn’t until I saw King Kong that I realised I could actually play an animal [in the future], when my mom explained to me who Andy (Serkis; the actor portraying the role of King Kong) was and what he did.\n\nWhat do you find fascinating about playing an animal?\n\nI think it’s almost easier to look at ourselves through the lens of another species. That’s why they teach animal work in drama school. And I love that kind of stuff. I think it allows us to get out of our own heads a little bit, experience things and feel stuff without overthinking it.\n\nYou went to ape school to prepare to portray Noa. Which aspects of the preparation helped you the most with tapping into this character?\n\nThe movement was really crucial. The way that Alain Gauthier, our movement coordinator, approached teaching us felt very organic. It wasn’t about impersonating apes or trying to get every little manner right, it was about creating a specific physical character that worked within the format of whatever ape we were playing. And so, obviously, there was a lot of studying. There was a lot of going to the Sydney Zoo, looking at YouTube, and watching documentaries. But when it actually came down to preparing for shooting, it was about creating a body that was reflective of what our characters were going through and what their internal life was. Additionally, I’d say that I didn’t really know who Noa was until I found his voice. And that was something that Alain was very adamant about introducing early in the process, which was really smart because it’s one thing to move and act like a chimpanzee, but it’s an entirely different thing to try to add human language on top of that and still make it feel real. It was really tough at the beginning, which I think was actually good because he starts out with being under a lot of pressure from his father; he doesn’t know what’s going to become of him or if he’s going to be able to do the things that he feels like he needs to do. And then, he’s basically forced to take this journey during which he finds his voice. So you can hear the voice gradually fall into place as he starts to feel more confident.\n\nWhat about Noa did you find most relatable?\n\nMy God, everything! [Laughs] That was part of this epiphany when I was wondering if I could play this character. And then I realised that he’s kind of me. [Laughs] He’s got this scientific brain and he’s always fixing something or carving something with his little woodworking tools. And that’s what I did as a kid – I loved woodworking and building stuff. He’s got this deep sense of wonder for the world which I think I have as well, especially when it comes to nature. Also, he starts out very unsure of himself and that’s how I felt at the beginning of filming. And so the journey that Noa takes in the movie kind of mirrored my own journey of making the movie.\n\nWhat have been the biggest adjustments in regards to coming from indie cinema to this big blockbuster production?\n\nThe funny thing is there wasn’t really that much of an adjustment. The only thing I had to adjust to was the knowledge that I was leading a however-many-hundred million type of movie, which as soon as you start shooting you forget about. It actually felt like a big indie movie. [Laughs] You know, in indie movies, you gotta love what you do in order to do it because nobody’s making any money. And this is how this experience felt, of course with the exception that everyone was getting paid more than they would on an indie movie. But it had the same kind of spirit of a bunch of friends getting together and making something – in this case, it was more than a bunch, it was a village of friends. [Laughs] The way that Wes (Ball; the film’s director) works is very collaborative and his vision is very clear.\n\nFollowing this big breakout role for you, what are the genres or types of characters you would like to explore next?\n\nI really want to play a musician. I’m a huge Nick Cave fan and I have always wanted to play him!\n\n…\n\nInterview by Martin Onufrowicz\n\nPhotography by Hadar Pitchon\n\nFashion by Michael Marson\n\nAll clothes Celine Homme\n\nHART OF ALL TRADES\n\nHART DENTON IS A JACK OF ALL TRADES WHO’S MASTERING THEM ALL. BORN IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, AND RAISED IN CONWAY, ARKANSAS, THE ACTOR STANDS UPON HIS SMALL-TOWN BOY ROOTS, EMBRACING HIS ARTISTRY AND CRAFT WITH HUMILITY AND UTTER JOY. FROM GRACING OUR SCREENS IN RIVERDALE TO THIRTEEN REASONS WHY, AND NOW COMING FRONT AND CENTER IN AMERICAN CHERRY AND DELTOPIA, THE LITTLE ROCK-NATIVE IS SHOWING EVERYONE THAT HE WAS BORN TO PERFORM. TO SOME, HE’S AN ACTOR, TO OTHERS, HE’S A MUSICIAN—SIDE BY SIDE WITH KJ APA IN THE BAND, MOTHERLOVER. AND ONLINE, HE’S A PAINTER, LETTING US INTO HIS WORLD THROUGH CANVASSES. NONETHELESS, TO EVERYONE THAT COMES ACROSS DENTON, FROM ARKANSAS TO LOS ANGELES, FROM NEW FANS TO OLDER ONES; WE CAN ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A TRUE ARTIST. DENTON’S OVERNIGHT RISE TO FAME—OR, THREE-DAY VENTURE IN HIS WORDS—IS A MEET-CUTE WITH SUCCESS AND A REMINDER THAT THE PURSUIT OF DREAMS WILL ALWAYS BE WORTH IT. SOON, THE ARTIST WILL BE ABLE TO ADD “DIRECTOR” TO HIS DECK OF CARDS. IN A CONVERSATION WITH DENTON, WE SPEAK ALL ABOUT HIS LOVE FOR CREATING, HIS APPRECIATION FOR SMALL TOWNS, AND THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES FUN THAT MADE HIS NEW FILM, THE DUEL.\n\nIn a Teen Vogue interview, you said your life after getting the part in Riverdale changed in a matter of three days. Can you describe what those three days were like and how it happened?\n\nA lot was going on at that time, I was couch surfing and primarily living out of a car. And I had less than one dollar in my account. I didn't own a printer, because I didn't have a place to live. So I would go and print out my audition sides from the FedEx print places. I was getting ready for the audition two days before, I went to FedEx and tried to print out my sides. But I didn't have enough money to cover the dollar and thirteen cents that it was to print the sides out. And so I thought, “Well, I'm just gonna have to memorize this thing completely and not be able to glance down at my sides at all.” I memorized every bit of it. I remember sitting in the waiting room for the audition, and everybody reading their sides and looking at them. And I’m just sitting there with nothing to look at. I also didn't have a phone at that time, I was primarily communicating with my managers and agents through email. So, I didn't have a phone to look at them either and did the audition. And it's the taled story of thinking, “I screwed it up. It was awful. I did bad.” And I thought, “I definitely didn't get that.” A couple of days later, my manager called me and said, “Hey, you got it.” And I went, “Oh, no way!” But I had flown home to Arkansas because that's where my family is from. I just needed a break from LA and my aunt had gotten me a flight home, she got me a ticket because she knew I was just really in a tough place. And then, I didn't have any money to fly back. So she got me another ticket, thank God. I flew back to LA and then went to shoot the show in Vancouver, and finally had more than a couple of dollars in my account. So yeah, everything was completely different for me after that.\n\nWhen it comes to red carpets, how did it feel to be immersed in that kind of spotlight so quickly?\n\nI have used a little bit of training because I was all over the place. Some of them made me so anxious and nervous that I would have a couple of drinks prior. And then I would watch it back later and I was just like, “Oh my, what a mess.” Because I could tell that I was so uncomfortable. I wasn't used to any of that. I mean, I grew up in a really small town. But I have a very supportive family and they were always encouraging me to sing and dance and do all sorts of things in front of them. So, I got comfortable performing. But whenever I would do carpets, that wasn't performing—that was just me. So, that is a weird thing to embrace and to this day, I still don't know how to really operate them.\n\nWhen was the last time you visited Little Rock? And what are the memories that are so potent when you think about it?\n\nOh, I go back all the time. There's a stretch every year from January to March that I'm not there. And then the rest of the year, I'm there every other month—I go back so much. I love being in Arkansas, it's home to me, and my family's there. It's such a familiar place. And it's such a slow pace of life that it allows me to just take a breath and not be sucked into this monster that is Los Angeles. I appreciate LA for the opportunities that it can provide. I'm not ignorant about it. And some of my best friends are here, who are like family to me. But being in Arkansas gives me such a calm feeling and a sense of being grounded and safe. Los Angeles has never felt like home to me. It's always felt like this temporary place. Whereas, Arkansas feels like home. It feels right. And it feels secure. I'm going back in a couple of days. I can't wait.\n\nDo you have any recommendations? If someone visited Arkansas, where should they go?\n\nWell, northwest Arkansas is growing a lot right now. Because you have families like the Waltons who made Walmart and you have Tyson Chicken, they're putting so much money back into Arkansas. There's an incredible museum called Crystal Bridges - it's getting a lot of notoriety for how great it is. And I feel like the film industry is starting to boom there. I just finished writing a movie, it's set in Arkansas, and I'd love to shoot it this fall. That would be quick, but I'd be excited [to do it]. I want to build a production studio there. I want to shoot movies and TV shows there and use a lot of local people. Because there are so many talented people. I did a movie in Arkansas a couple of years ago, and it was mostly local crew members - they were incredible. I want to make Arkansas this hub of film because it's so untapped. There's hardly any sort of infiltration of anything there. It's just so natural and beautiful. And there's so much you can do, so much you can shoot there. That’s my dream.\n\nSpeaking of smaller towns, most coming-of-age films and shows take place there. As Deltopia, American Cherry and Riverdale follow the coming-of-age genre, what about those stories do you like or relate to so much?\n\nWell, the throughline with all three of those is that I've been fortunate enough to experience and get to play characters that are so far from who I am, that I've enjoyed each one of them differently, but it's been so fun to explore a side of life that I've never experienced in my reality. And it's been really fun to not just go in and be like, “Oh, well, I'm just playing me.” They've been big leaps away from who I am as a human, which I've enjoyed a lot. It's exciting, it feels like I'm getting to actually be a character. I'm getting to make up a character and live truthfully inside it. And I've been very fortunate to do that. Yeah, the towns I’ve shot in within the film or show were pretty much rural towns. And I like that, because it doesn't become based on what's going on around it, instead, the story centers around the characters and the relationships between them. All three projects were not really about being in a city. You're in the middle of nowhere. And I think that brings out different types of people and shows you what different types of people are out there. And more people - I would say - connect with that in the world more than they connect with big cities. Because the majority of people that are in big cities know what it’s like, so they want to see something that's outside of that. And people that are in those small towns, I would say for the most part don't necessarily want to see big city stuff. That's why they don't live in big cities. They don't really like them all that much. They want to see something familiar.\n\nCould you see yourself doing other genres, either as an actor or as a director?\n\nI would love to touch into some action. I did a small short film with Joe Matthews, who is a director and a writer, that was fun to do. It was the first fight sequence that I'd ever done. And I really enjoyed that. I would love to do that in a long format. Also, I desperately want to do a music film because it combines two of my loves into one thing. And I'd love to do a comedy—I've done so many heavy things. It'd be nice to do some lighter things too, and I love watching comedies. I mean, I have a film coming out this summer called The Duel, where there's definitely a comedic element to my character that mixes with a lot of drama and seriousness, but it's the first time that I got to touch into some comedic beats and some comedic elements that opened me up to be like, “This was a lot of fun.” I was given a lot of free rein to go back and forth with my friend, Denny Love who is also in it, and he's a great comic. We would go off the script and play around. And it was so challenging, but also so much fun, I would love to do a whole film with Danny.\n\nWhat are the films that inspire you?\n\nNumber one for me is The Shining, I’m obsessed with it. I just love that descent into madness in the middle of nowhere. And I love that it's only a couple of characters but it's such a story. That's another thing I would also love to do, something in a thriller sense, something in a way that brushes right up against horror but mostly stays in the lane of thriller. And that's a film that has been a huge part of my life along with The Wizard of Oz. That's huge for me. And I've recently watched it where—if you start the Pink Floyd album, Dark Side of the Moon, at the third roar of the MGM lion, it syncs up with the film in such an incredibly beautiful way. It’s like a 45-minute music video. It’s amazing. I was heavily influenced by that film as a kid. I was The Tin Man for several Halloweens growing up - my mom made me the costume. I was obsessed with The Tin Man because he had his heart on the outside of his chest and it just resonated with me, being named Hart—I was just obsessed with that film. And then on the comedic side, from a young age, I was obsessed with Beetlejuice. I was also a huge fan of the Austin Powers trilogy. As a kid, I would watch those all the time, and just quote them constantly – they heavily shaped my humor. Wayne's World was huge for me too. And Spinal Tap. And Big Lebowski.\n\nHow long did it take to shoot The Duel? What was that process like?\n\nWell, that was a strange process, because it was right in the middle of COVID, so everything was shut down. Nothing was running, we were one of the only films that was up and going during that time. It was in the middle of nowhere in Indiana. And there, I lived on a ranch-like farm home with three of the other guys that are in this movie with me. We would have a driver pick us up and take us to set where we would shoot and then we would have to go right back home. So, it enabled me to get very close with the other leads in the film: Dylan Sprouse, Denny Love, and Callan McAuliffe. The four of us are still very close.\n\nThat was such a bonding experience and a thing to go through together and it was the most fun I've ever had doing a film, it was a blast. The house we were in was so cool, it was this barn or farmhouse that had a movie room and basketball court outside. Denny and I played basketball constantly. I grew up playing basketball, but he would beat me every single night. And I would stay out til 2 am just putting up shots. Denny is a prolific trash talker. He’ll get inside your head. We almost got in a fight— like day two, it was a full-on thing. And now he's one of my best friends.\n\nWhat's your favorite part of shooting? What makes the acting experience so special?\n\nYou know, you're given a scene. And you, for the most part, didn't write it unless it is something that you created. It's someone else's vision of the person that they want you to be. And it's never going to be exactly what they envisioned. But to bring your life circumstances into this character, that bubbles out from this thing that you're trying to be and become, I think it's super rewarding. On an emotional level for me as a human outside of shooting that makes me understand different areas of life that I've, maybe, been ignoring before without even meaning to. But then once doing it, there's almost a therapeutic element to it, especially after doing something for a month or longer where you live with this thing for so long because you prep it, and then you live it. And then there's this thing where, when you're done, you separate away from it back into who you are. But there's still a part of that thing that's there with you. Hopefully, it's the good parts and not the bad, but it definitely still lives with you, where you're aware that this type of person does exist somewhere out there, or has existed before in some capacity, and it just connects you with the world a little bit more. It's so fun to go and play make-believe, it's the greatest job on earth because you're creating something. I feel very fortunate and grateful to have the job I have. Doing what you love is fantastic. I really love acting. I love playing music. I love painting. I just love creating things. I love everything that doesn’t suck away at your soul. I like the stuff that opens me up and makes me feel things. And I’m lucky enough to do them as a career.\n\nHow does your identity as a musician differ as an actor?\n\nWell, to a degree, they're both characters. For the most part, I would say because I don't necessarily try to write lyrics about my own life—I mean, little things come out in them. But I try to think in the mindset of a character, of another person I actually know. That allows me to sort of dissociate some of my problems and traumas in this way. There's a familiarity of, “Oh, someone else is going through this.” Even if it's a person I've made up in my head, there's something that allows me to connect with that a little bit. That makes me feel less alone, I guess. And, yeah, little parts come out, just as it does with acting, I'd say they're very similar in that regard, where some real things come up, but for the most part, I'm being someone else, something else.\n\nSo you're known as an actor, designer, model, car collector - which of these feel closest to you?\n\nIf you look at time spent doing things out of desire, I would say, across the board, the most I've done is music. Because growing up I did music so much as a kid, I had a band in middle school, a band in high school, and a band in college, and then I moved out here to Los Angeles and I was doing music and writing for other people before I did any of the acting. Also, I did some musical theatre growing up so there was still an essence of music there. Acting would be a close second, if not tied. And then art, in regards to painting and drawing, would be number three. I just love doing stuff with my hands. My buddy KJ [Apa] really got me into painting about a year ago. We started painting together a lot. And now, it's become something that I want to do every day. I love listening to music and watching concerts while I paint. I love it because I can glance over and watch them, and I can see the crowd and feel the crowd. And it’s just—it's so raw. And yeah, I also collect cars here and there. I knew nothing about cars about two years ago, and then really got into it during the pandemic. Now, I have an old Ford truck. I have an old ‘80s Mercedes. I have a 1972 Honda CB 350 motorcycle. I have a 66 Mustang. And then sometimes, I'll sell one and get another one. There's nothing that feels better than cruising down the highway in one of those machines that's 50 years old. It just feels great.\n\nInterview by JoliAmour DuBose-Morris\n\nPhotography by Emmanuel Giraux\n\nFashion by Douglas VanLaningham at The Rex Agency\n\nGroomer by Morgan Grimes\n\nPhotographer’s assistant Pierre Drouin\n\nA MAN OF TWO FACES\n\nIN THE SYMPATHIZER, HOA XUANDE FINDS HIS PLACE IN THE SUN. AFTER YEARS OF PLAYING SUPPORTING CHARACTERS, THE A24 AND HBO PRODUCTION MARKS THE ACTOR’S FIRST STARRING ROLE. IN THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED SERIES, XUANDE PORTRAYS A SPY, STRADDLING THE FENCE BETWEEN HIS HOME COUNTRY OF NORTH VIETNAM AND THE OPPOSING WESTERN SIDE, STEERED BY THE UNITED STATES. BUT HIS PORTRAYAL IS FAR FROM THE EMOTIONALLY ABSENT ACTION HEROES WHO FIGHT CLASSIFIED WARS. WITH THE ROLE OF THE CAPTAIN, THE ACTOR SUCCESSFULLY EXPLORES THE INNER TURMOIL OF A MAN WHO’S A VICTIM OF THE TRAUMA OF ARMED CONFLICT. THROUGHOUT THE SHOW’S SEVEN EPISODES, XUANDE NAVIGATES IDENTITY AS A FLUID CONCEPT AND LOYALTY AS AN UNBEARABLE PRICE TO PAY. DESPITE PROFESSING HIS LOVE FOR THE SOURCE MATERIAL, A BOOK OF THE SAME NAME WRITTEN BY VIET THANH NGUYEN, HIS PORTRAYAL OF THE STORY’S MAIN CHARACTER AND NARRATOR IS BASED ON HIS STRUGGLES GROWING UP STUCK BETWEEN HIS VIETNAMESE DESCENT AND AUSTRALIAN NATIONALITY. AND YET, DESPITE THE INHERENT TRAGEDY OF HIS ROLE, THE ACTOR FLEXES HIS COMEDIC MUSCLES, UNDERSTANDING HUMOUR AS A HEALTHY RESPONSE TO SORROW. THROUGH HIS PERFORMANCE, XUANDE PROVES HIMSELF TO BE WHAT HE’S ALWAYS BEEN: A LEADING MAN.\n\nCongratulations on The Sympathizer, it’s truly incredible…\n\nThank you!\n\nYou said previously that you started reading the book it's based on before ever knowing it was going to get picked up for a show…\n\nIt was very random. I was just googling books to read, and I’d never heard of it before. I think I read the first three chapters, which now that you’ve watched the show is equivalent to the first episode. I remember reading the escape scene and feeling that moment, that really stuck with me. I was borrowing the book, so I had to give it back after that and I picked it up again when this project came around. I just remember how devastating the descriptions were, it moved me.\n\nDid your impression of the story change at all when you saw the script for the first time?\n\nI wouldn’t say so. I’ve read the book many times now and I had these passages that were always playing in my head, even when I was acting. I just always knew how to feel in the moment because it’s how I felt reading the book.\n\nThat’s interesting, I know some actors confine themselves to the script and stay away from the source material.\n\nThey weren’t too far from each other. Obviously, there were differences because you have to adapt it to the visual medium, but the overall feeling and tone adhered to the book. I think that’s the most important, descriptions have to be adapted into visual cues so they can be digested by the audience. The emotion of what was happening stuck to the book. When I was reading the script, I felt just like when I was reading the book.\n\nYou’re working alongside some of the industry’s titans, like Robert Downey Jr. and Sandra Oh. What was it like to work so closely with them?\n\nIt still amazes me that they’ve done so much work over the decades and at the same time manage to be so down-to-earth, supportive, and generous. They were always willing to give me their time as scene partners as opposed to just doing their own thing. It wasn’t just to me, they cared about the people that were doing the scenes with us. It speaks to how committed they are to the story. I remember my first scene with both, it was the first week of production, and I was so nervous when I saw them. This was my first time working on this level, but Sandra practised with me. At first, I thought we were just having a conversation, she made it so real and natural. It inspired me to forget about the whole idea of what acting is. Robert was having fun which helped remind me to also enjoy the process and not get bogged down in the emotion of the story we were telling.\n\nAs you’ve mentioned, this is your first starring role in a production of this scale, what were some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned?\n\nOof, there’s so much. I never worked on this level before… Leading a show, especially an A24 and HBO production, I didn’t know what to expect, I wasn’t aware of what the boundaries were. I’m so used to learning my script, doing my research, bringing that to the camera, and then just disappearing. When you’re on it every day, doing scenes day in and day out, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. You have to look after yourself, make sure you’re sleeping and eating right, dedicate time to do prep but also find time to release all of it and not think about it for a couple of hours. I had to create a routine. Sandra was so nice, she would speak up on my behalf on set or to producers when she felt I wasn’t getting what I needed. Robert could tell how tired I was, so he always brought a light-hearted energy to set. They were all supporting me because it was a long race, you can’t get caught too early.\n\nBesides the production’s length, I would imagine it’s quite challenging to play a spy that’s constantly plagued by their inner moral turmoil.\n\nWhen you say playing a spy, some images come to mind. If you think of double-crossing and lying, the typical Hollywood action hero comes to mind. I wanted to veer away from that. When I read the book, the scenes that struck me were the passages on the absurdity of the trauma and devastation of war. I tried to hold on to those emotions by diving into the psychology of what it would’ve been like to be torn apart by your countries, by your friendships, by the love that you have for different people. Those were the emotions I thought were pertinent to the character. I leaned into the emotions of a human being like me instead of trying to play a double-crossing spy.\n\nYou’ve said in the past that your experiences helped you play The Captain. In what ways did your life story bleed into your portrayal?\n\nThe duality of identity is something I inherently understood when I was reading the book. He’s obviously Vietnamese but he’s been Westernised by his upbringing in America, there’s a fascination and liking for that culture. He never felt like he fit in Vietnam because of his mixed race, but when he went over to the States, he didn’t belong either. I was a Vietnamese kid growing up in Australia, I never felt like I was Vietnamese enough to be part of the culture, I didn’t really speak my language, and I wasn’t around the Vietnamese community. But then being Asian didn’t make me Australian “enough” either. I felt like I was walking that thin line of my duality.\n\nThe show is very intense at times, but it does strike an interesting balance with some comedic moments. Did those moments of levity help you balance out the more emotionally raw scenes?\n\nOf course. You know, the book gets dark and devastating simply because of the trauma of what a human has been put through. I think humour is a coping mechanism w"
