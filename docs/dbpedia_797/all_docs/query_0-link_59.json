        "text": "Right then. My turn.\n\n16. A Matter Of Life And Death (2006)\n\nRight, say what you will about his album, but to me, this is the worst Maiden album. To me, it's just too...boring. Yes, they're a couple of good songs on the album...but that's it. A couple. Two. The sound quality isn't bad, but my main complaint with this album is that the songs just drone on and on and on. I think two or three songs could've been saved by just cutting 1½-3 minutes off of them.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\n\n2. Different World\n\n3. ?????\n\nAlbum rating: 3/10\n\n15. The Final Frontier (2010)\n\nOkay, now to me, their is a considerable jump from AMOLAD, to this album, The Final Frontier. It's an alright album. It's got a few flaws, but most albums are bound to have a couple of duds in them. I really like Where The Wild Wind Blows on this record. It's a classic, good, long Iron Maiden song. In all of its 11 minutes, not once do I ever find myself getting bored with this song. A couple of highly underrated Iron Maiden songs are in this record as well, Isle of Avalon, and Starblind.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Where The Wild Wind Blows\n\n2. El Dorado\n\n3. Isle Of Avalon\n\nAlbum Rating: 7/10\n\n14. Dance Of Death (2003)\n\nAgain, this isn't a bad album, and considering this is Iron Maiden, it's got some HUGE competition. But let's be honest for a minute, coming off of one of the best albums in the catalogue (Brave New World), and two huge tours (Brave New World , and Give Me Ed ...Till I'm Dead), you were probably expecting something a little better than Dance Of Death. It starts off quite well, with Wildest Dreams kicking things off, than Rainmaker, and No More Lies. Then it loses me with Montségur, and I don't ever really find my footing again until Face In The Sand (brilliant track by the way, HIGHLY underrated), and then Journeyman, the band's only fully acoustic track. Tracks like the title track, and Paschendale are good, but not memorable. All in all though, it's not a bad album, and I do listen to some songs of this album regularly.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Rainmaker\n\n2. No More Lies\n\n3. Face In The Sand\n\nAlbum Rating: 7/10\n\n13. No Prayer For The Dying (1990)\n\nLots of people when this came out in 1990, were less than impressed. What with Adrian Smith leaving and Janick Gers entering, and the massive sound change. Course, the 1990s were hard for pretty much every metal band on the planet. Metallica was the only who stayed near the top, but look at all the change they under went. But this album isn't too bad. It's a downhill slide from Seventh Son of A Seventh Son, but it's still got some halfass tunes. I quite like tracks such as Tailgunner, Holy Smoke, No Prayer For The Dying, Bring Your Daughter, and Mother Russia. The only real duds on this one are Public Enema Number One, and Run Silent Run Deep. This one isn't a bad album either, and despite it being ranked in the lower half of this list, it's quite good.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Tailgunner\n\n2. Mother Russia\n\n3. Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\n\nAlbum Rating: 7½/10\n\n12. Killers (1981)\n\nAgain, this is NOT a bad album. To me this album is just...too long. The sound quality is not the best, but better than the debut album. It's also got some good tracks on it, such as Wrathchild and Murders In The Rue Morgue. But then there are other tracks, such as Prodigal Son, that left me asking myself \"What the hell was that??\" This album feels just sort of pieced together. It probably would've been better to me if a couple songs were dropped, and just added as B-sides.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Killers\n\n2. Wrathchild\n\n3. Drifter\n\nAlbum Rating: 7½/10\n\n11. Virtual XI (1998)\n\nNow, on most lists, this album is either at the stone, dead bottom of the list, or damn close to it. I personally don't see why. It's a brilliant album. Blaze Hayley had some good vocals working here, Janick Gers and Dave Murray had brilliant guitar work here, and Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain were brilliant as normal. To me, the only song that appears as a dud to me, is Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger. This song, is like a train. It takes too long to get going, but when it does get going, it doesn't stop easily, and it's not real exciting either. Even The Angel And The Gambler is better than this, despite the two minutes consecutive of \"Don't ya think I could save you, Don't ya think I could save you, Don't ya think I could save your life\". But it's also got amazing tracks in it, such as Futureal, The Clansman, and the very underrated Como Estais Amigos.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. The Clansman\n\n2. Como Estais Amigos\n\n3. Futureal\n\nAlbum Rating: 7¾/10\n\n10. Iron Maiden (1980)\n\nThis is Iron Maiden's debut album. I don't really have too awful much to say about it. It's a pretty good album, despite the shitty audio quality, and it's got some good tracks on it, such as Prowler and Remember Tomorrow. To me, the only track I feel doesn't measure up properly to the rest of the songs, is Strange World, which is a \"meh\" song.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Sanctuary\n\n2. Prowler\n\n3. Phantom Of The Opera\n\nAlbum Rating: 7¾/10\n\n9. Fear Of The Dark (1992)\n\nThis album takes a lot of shit, and it takes it quite often. I don't see why. Now, it isn't their best album, as it does have the single worst Iron Maiden song recorded, but it's far from the worst, and it's still got some damn good tunes on it. Weekend Warrior is the song I'm talking about when I say \"the worst\". It's the only song that is boring straight from the first second, up to the last. Fear Of The Dark, has filler tracks (The Apparition, The Fugitive, Fear Is The Key), but before, in between, and after, are great tracks. Most notably, one of the best Maiden songs ever, Fear Of The Dark. Others too, such as Be Quick Or Be Dead, From Here To Eternity , and another highly underrated song, Judas Be My Guide.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Fear Of The Dark\n\n2. Judas Be My Guide\n\n3. Afraid To Shoot Strangers\n\nAlbum Rating: 8/10\n\n8. The X Factor (1995)\n\nThis album was of course, the first with Blaze Bayley on vocals, instead of Bruce Dickinson. To be honest, I like Blaze's vocals on these songs MUCH better than Bruce, apart from Sign Of The Cross. It's also the darkest of the Maiden discography, and you can tell that just from the opening few seconds of this album. Also, this album has FIVE of my most underrated Maiden songs, Look For The Truth, Blood On The World's Hand's, The Edge Of Darkness, 2 AM, and Fortunes Of War. All of which are great tracks. My two main complaints on his album are these: the guitars aren't loud enough, and what the hell is The Unbeliever doing on this album, and not Doctor, Doctor.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Sign Of The Cross\n\n2. Man Of The Edge\n\n3. 2 AM\n\nAlbum Rating: 8/10\n\n7. Piece Of Mind (1983)\n\nThis was the first album to feature Nicko McBrain on the drums, instead of Clive Burr (RIP), and the opening track \"Where Eagles Dare\" is a great opener, to really, what is a great album. It's nothing but good old fashioned, drive hard classic metal, only slowing down for Sun And Steel, which even though is the worst track on the album, it's still a good track. All in all, if your looking for an album that is just plain, old school metal, look no further than Piece Of Mind.\n\nTop Three Tracks:\n\n1. Revelations\n\n2. The Trooper\n\n3. Die With Your Boots On\n\nAlbum Rating: 8½/10\n\n6. Brave New World (2000)\n\nNow this, is what you call a grade A++ comeback album. The Blaze years, had sent Maiden down into the ditch, and who better to mend the problem, than with Bruce Dickinson, and Adrian Smith returning to the line up. This album is almost completely flawless, with the only two flaws being The Mercenary, and The Nomad. This album has great sound, Nicko McBrain kicks more ass in this album more than any other (mainly on The Wicker Man), and the melodies are to die for. This was Maiden in their second prime. The end of this album sees two massively underrated songs cap everything off: Out Of The Silent Planet, and The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, both of which are some of the most beautiful peices of music I've ever heard.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Brave New World\n\n2. Out Of The Silent Planet\n\n3. The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n\nAlbum Rating: 9/10\n\n5. The Book Of Souls (2015)\n\nI was scared to death when I read on Loudwire.com, that Bruce Dickinson had cancer, as I'm sure the whole of the metal world was. But this album proves, that it's gonna take more than a little cancer, to kill Eddie, and the boys. Bruce kicked cancer's ass, and then came The Book Of Souls, which is the best Maiden album since 1988's Seventh Son. The kings of long songs, put three tracks on this album eclipsing 10 minutes (The Red 13:38, Title Track 10:31, and The Empire of Clouds 18:00), and for a group of people eligible for an AARP membership, they kick more ass then all the modern bands of today. If Eternity Should Fail, is a fantastic opener, and it doesn't ever lose momentum from there.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. The Empire Of The Clouds\n\n2. If Eternity Should Fail\n\n3. The Great Unknown\n\nAlbum Rating: 9½/10\n\n4. Powerslave (1984)\n\nFrom the opening chords of Aces High, to the fade away on Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, this album is pure brilliance. It launched Iron Maiden's largest world tour of 188 dates around the world, including a performance in front of 300,000+ people at Rock In Rio. Everyone here, is firing on all cylinders, and they only go down from that on two tracks, Losfer Words, and The Duelists. Two filler tracks that even still, they contribute to the album, and are still half ass tracks.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. 2 Minutes To Midnight\n\n2. Aces High\n\n3. Powerslave\n\nAlbum Rating: 9½/10\n\n3. The Number Of The Beast (1982)\n\n666...the number of the beast. Their really isn't any point in arguing against it, this was a HUGE album for not only Iron Maiden, but the entirety of the metal genre. Not a single track on this record is there, that I don't adore. Even Gangland and Invaders to me, are really, good tracks, and highly underrated. Then of course, we can't forget the massive classics, Run To The Hills, The Number Of The Beast, Hallowed Be Thy Name, and even the sub-classics in Children Of The Damned, The Prisoner, and 22 Acacia Avenue.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Hallowed Be Thy Name\n\n2. Children Of The Damned\n\n3. Run To The Hills\n\nAlbum Rating: 10/10\n\n2. Somewhere In Time (1986)\n\nNow, I have a HUGE taste of music. Although Metallica, and Iron Maiden are my top two dogs by a landslide, I do enjoy some modern metal/rock (FFDP, Godsmack, System Of A Down, etc.). But I also enjoy 80s pop, 70s slow rock, and all the music you hear on a traditional classic rock station. In other words, keyboards are in a lot of my music. So when I first turned on this album, and heard Caught Somewhere In Time, it was an instant eargasim. And every single second is pure bliss. The sound of the guitars, is simply amazing. The worst song on this album is a history lesson. And even that, is shear greatness.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Caught Somewhere In Time\n\n2. The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\n\n3. Sea Of Madness OR Stranger In A Strange Land\n\nAlbum Rating: 11/10\n\n1. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988)\n\nI can't even think of all the words to describe the greatness of this album. The only reason this isn't a tie for first place with Somewhere In Time, is that this album has actual keyboards/synthesisers, instead of synthetic guitars. From the opening seconds of Moonchild, to the closing seconds of Only The Good Die Young (which sound almost exactly the same oddly enough), this album exceeds what it takes to make a great album. Every song on here I give a solid 10/10 except The Prophecy, which I give a 9½/10. This album has the forgotten Infinite Dreams, the live staples in The Evil That Men Do, Moonchild, and The Clairvoyant, and the epic title track, which is 9:57 of your life you'll never regret using. You really REALLY need to hear this album if you haven't for a while cause...wow.\n\nTop Three Songs:\n\n1. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\n\n2. The Evil That Men Do\n\n3. The Clairvoyant OR Moonchild\n\nAlbum Rating: 20/10\n\nI'm gonna steal @Moonchild_14's post's template for this. Alright, let's see:\n\n16. Virtual XI (1998)\n\nThis is by far the lowest point in Maiden's career yet. While The X Factor is a hidden gem in their discography, Blaze's sophomore effort with the band failed to achieve the same level of greatness of its predecessor, let alone that of the band's classic albums. The songs by themselves are very enjoyable, but they're very repetitive, and listening to the album in its entirety takes a lot of patience. The band sound tired, uninspired, and all that is made all the more apparent due to the poor sound quality and production. However, as with all other Maiden records, it does have those redeeming qualities and hidden brilliance that keep it from being unlistenable.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"The Clansman\"\n\n\"The Educated Fool\"\n\n\"Futureal\"\n\nAlbum rating: 3/10\n\n15. Killers (1981)\n\nI'm not sure if this comes off as a surprise or not, but there it is. Killers is my second least favorite Maiden album, and it's all fault of the band's decision to use B-side quality songs to fill up space on their sophomore effort. This is the complete opposite of Virtual XI: while that one features stellar (though terribly unpolished) songwriting hammered down by bad sound quality and production, this one features a stellar production courtesy of Martin Birch, but the songwriting is definitely subpar overall (by Maiden standards, anyway).\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Killers\"\n\n\"Murders In the Rue Morgue\"\n\n\"The Ides of March\" / \"Purgatory\"\n\nAlbum rating: 4/10\n\n14. Fear of the Dark (1992)\n\nThe main problem I have with this album (other than it features \"Weekend Warrior\", my least favorite Maiden song) is that it feels less like an actual album, and more like a compilation of songs (which is not exactly what I'm looking for when listening to an album). The songs, while good, are completely disconnected from one another, which makes the entire thing sound like a mess (an enjoyable mess, but still a mess). Martin's (last) production is very good, even though it's not up to par with his work on other albums (like Powerslave and Piece of Mind). However, as always, the album does feature some stellar compositions, such as the title track (an immortal classic) and the often maligned, but brilliant \"The Apparition\".\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Fear of the Dark\"\n\n\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\"\n\n\"The Apparition\"\n\nAlbum rating: 4/10\n\n13. Dance of Death (2003)\n\nIronically, the band's 13th studio effort is also my 13th favorite album of theirs. It ultimately suffers from the same problem the previous album does (although here it's handled much better). The songs still sound completely unlinked, without any kind of continuity (almost as if you could move the track listing around and it wouldn't make any difference). The album is saved by a number of truly amazing songs that ultimately rank among the band's finest ever, also including what could possibly be the best short (less than 4 minutes) song of their entire career, \"Rainmaker\".\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Dance of Death\"\n\n\"Paschendale\"\n\n\"Rainmaker\"\n\nAlbum rating: 5/10\n\n12. No Prayer For the Dying (1990)\n\nThere's really only one thing wrong with this record, and that goes by the name of \"The Assassin\". A brilliant instrumental piece almost completely butchered by unimaginative and even cringe-worthy lyrics and a mind numbingly stupid chorus. The other songs, however, more than make up for it, and while not as great as the other 11 albums to follow on this list, it's still a very solid and very enjoyable album, featuring, yet again, quite a few of Maiden's often hidden mini-masterpieces.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Mother Russia\"\n\n\"No Prayer For the Dying\"\n\n\"Run Silent Run Deep\"\n\nAlbum rating: 6/10\n\n11. The Number of the Beast (1982)\n\nOkay, I'm sure a lot of you weren't expecting this one to be placed at such a low position, but if I had to point out a ridiculously overrated Maiden album, this would be it. No way in hell this is the band's best album. It's too uneven for that. It still maintains a little bit of the Killers street vibe, which is definitely not a good thing (just take a look at where I ranked it here). The only real dud here is \"Gangland\", but still: \"Run to the Hills\" is overrated and overplayed, \"The Prisoner\" goes on for a little longer than necessary, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is not the band's greatest song ever (there are about 34 others that have outdone it), and the overall listening experience ends up being too underwhelming for it to be considered the best Maiden album ever. \"Invaders\", however, is one hell of an opener and a criminally underrated song, far better than \"Run to the Hills\".\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\"\n\n\"The Number of the Beast\"\n\n\"Children of the Damned\"\n\nAlbum rating: 6/10\n\n10. Brave New World (2000)\n\nWhenever I think of this album, the first word that springs to mind: fresh. That's what it sounds like after the ridiculously underwhelming Virtual XI. At a time when Iron Maiden appeared to have lost their magic and power, Brave New World was a more than welcome addition to the band's discography. The album absolutely crackles with energy, and it really sounds like a band climbing back up to the top of their own game. The closest thing to a dud here is \"The Mercenary\", which is still decent, although exhaustingly repetitive.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"The Nomad\"\n\n\"Dream of Mirrors\"\n\n\"Blood Brothers\"\n\nAlbum rating: 7/10\n\n9. Iron Maiden (1980)\n\nThis one still ranks among the greatest debut albums I've ever heard. No band should sound this good at the very start of their career. The songwriting isn't always great, but it really sounds like the boys are trying. They're all really giving the best they've got, and the whole thing is mindblowing. It takes you right back to the '80s music scene, right to the start of the NWOBHM without sounding outdated. To this date, it still sounds fresh, just as if it were new. I still can't believe they wrote a monster (one that still ranks among the band's finest) like \"Phantom of the Opera\" on their first album, plus it features the band's best live track: \"Iron Maiden\".\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Phantom of the Opera\"\n\n\"Remember Tomorrow\"\n\n\"Transylvania\"\n\nAlbum rating: 7/10\n\n8. The X Factor (1995)\n\nAn ominous gregorian chant introduces Blaze Bayley's debut in a very weird way. At a time when fans had gotten accustomed to the band's fast openers and long, epic closers, Iron Maiden took their own formula and turned it on its head, opening their darkest album with one of their longest songs ever: the 11-minute \"Sign of the Cross\". For a long time, I thought that it was a terrible opener. I used to think \"Man On the Edge\" would work better to open the album, whereas \"Sign\" should be the closer (because, you know... that's what you would expect from them). And boy, was I wrong! \"Sign of the Cross\" is a brilliant masterpiece of an opener, and it itself should (have) burst this album to recognition. Most of the songs here have been ignored for a very long time, and what a mistake that ended up being. The X Factor is Maiden's most artistic and introspective album to date, and while it doesn't always hits the greatness target, it's a very consistent and very focused record. It kinda works like a jigsaw puzzle: take a song out, the entire thing falls apart.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Sign of the Cross\"\n\n\"Lord of the Flies\"\n\n\"Blood On the World's Hands\"\n\nAlbum rating: 8/10\n\n7. The Final Frontier (2010)\n\nFor a long time, I felt this album wasn't good. No matter how much I tried, I could never get into it! It wasn't until recently that it finally clicked with me, and, suddenly, it grew. From the brilliant atmospheric opener to the fading wind of \"When the Wild Wind Blows\", it never lets up. There's no bad song here, nothing even remotely close to a dud. All songs work perfectly both on the album and separately. The songwriting is magnificent, and we get to hear the band experimenting with lots of new things and venturing into previously unexplored territories. \"Isle of Avalon\", for instance, doesn't really sound like anything they did before or after, and it all works tremendously well.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Starblind\"\n\n\"When the Wild Wind Blows\"\n\n\"The Talisman\"\n\nAlbum rating: 8/10\n\n6. Somewhere In Time (1986)\n\nThis doesn't feel as much as an album as it does as an experimental transition. This is where Maiden started to introduce (more) layers to their overall sound, with the addition of synthesizers. It's ironic that just a few years earlier Bruce was so firmly stating that \"you can't play heavy metal with synthesizers\". And you really couldn't! That is, until Somewhere In Time came along. Maiden pulled it all off incredibly well - feels like they had been using them forever. It all sounds very natural, and the way the whole thing blends in with the futuristic atmosphere and the songs is astonishing. Also, kudos to Martin Birch for one of his best production jobs ever.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Alexander the Great\"\n\n\"Wasted Years\"\n\n\"Stranger In a Strange Land\"\n\nAlbum rating: 9/10\n\n5. The Book of Souls (2015)\n\nWho would've ever thought that 6 60-year-old guys in a 40-year-old band would still have such a monster left in them? The Book of Souls is a tremendous effort. Very consistent and focused, not to mention all of the brilliant performances and how fucking epic the whole thing sounds. There really isn't much to say about this album - other than it kicks serious ass. The only song here that ends up sounding a bit meh is \"Death or Glory\", and even then it's a very fun song to listen to. Also, obviously, it's worth mentioning that Bruce sounds fantastic, and the fact that he still had his untreated tongue cancer when he recorded this thing makes it all the more amazing and unbelievable. He really shines on \"Empire of the Clouds\"!\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Empire of the Clouds\"\n\n\"The Red and the Black\"\n\n\"The Book of Souls\"\n\nAlbum rating: 9/10\n\n4. Piece of Mind (1983)\n\nRight off the bat, I must say that this record features the best Maiden production ever. The drums sound amazing, the guitars crisp and clear, Steve's bass blends in perfectly with the guitars, and Bruce's vocals are very powerful throughout. His diction is also a highlight here - you shouldn't need lyrics to catch up on what he's singing about. Musically, the entire album is brilliant. Only the lyrics aren't the best sometimes, with random innaccurate mentions of dinosaurs and the retelling of a story that ultimately makes no sense at all (sorry Steve!). It does, however, include the best and most brilliant song Davey's ever written, the awfully underrated \"Still Life\" (which also happens to be the best song on the album).\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Still Life\"\n\n\"Revelations\"\n\n\"Flight of Icarus\"\n\nAlbum rating: 9/10\n\n3. A Matter of Life and Death (2006)\n\nTo me, this is the closest to progressive metal Maiden's ever been. It feels almost concept-like, and for that it's no wonder that the band decided to play it live in its entirety. Much like The X Factor, this is another example of an album that actually works as one. If you try to unscrew it, take things away from it, it kinda falls apart - that's the beauty of it. Actually, to me, this album could as well be called a concept album: all songs feel linked together in a way no Maiden album has ever been, and they all end up coming down to the same themes of war and religion. Plus, it's a lyrical journey, as much as a sonic one - it takes you right down to the middle of a battlefield, to the creation of the atomic bomb, to all the chaos and despair of all the fights and wars religion can ultimately lead to. It's a masterpiece.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\"\n\n\"The Legacy\"\n\n\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\"\n\nAlbum rating: 10/10\n\n2. Powerslave (1984)\n\nThis is by far the most powerful album this band has ever released. Whatever song you choose to play from it, it feels like it's gonna blow up your speakers. It's fast and energetic, in a way that I can't help but think it must have been a major influence in thrash metal - except it's much better than that. Tightly written riffs, genius drum fills from Nicko, Steve's bass wonderfully cutting through the guitars, and Bruce's deliveries as powerful as ever, in addition to having the most beautiful harmonies ever written in Maiden's history. Not only that, it features the best song ever created in the history of mankind, Steve's own monster epic and masterpiece, the utterly perfect \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". A classic in every sense of the word.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"\n\n\"Powerslave\"\n\n\"Aces High\"\n\nAlbum rating: 10/10\n\n1. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)\n\nThis is it. The ultimate Iron Maiden masterpiece. Seventh Son is a fantastic album from start to finish, and the boys all sound as inspired as ever. Maiden's only officially acknowledged concept album, it tells the story of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and his journey through life as he discovers his powers and abilities. Musically, this is the catchiest album the band's ever put out, with literally every melody (including the vocal ones) being able to crawl their way into your brain and be stuck in there for a very long time (maybe forever). The use of keyboards is brilliant, just enough as to create the necessary atmosphere, but not to let it dominate over the rest of the music. This is the most accessible Maiden album in terms of sound, and over the years the word \"accessible\" has gained a very bad connotation (especially with the resurgence of pop music in recent years), but that's not to detract from the utter brilliance that is Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n\nTop 3 songs:\n\n\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\"\n\n\"Only the Good Die Young\"\n\n\"Infinite Dreams\"\n\nAlbum rating: 10/10\n\nThoughts? Anyone?\n\nNow that my discography listen is complete, time to do this. In the style of Moonchild_14 and Number 6:\n\n16. Killers (1981)\n\nKillers isn't a bad album. In fact, it has several great songs on it. That said, it also features some of Maiden's all-time worst. Many of these songs are b-side fodder at best. A definite step-down from the pretty cool debut album, though it has its place in Maiden history and the discography wouldn't be the same without it. Very overrated album as a whole, certainly.\n\nMurders in the Rue Morgue\n\nKillers\n\nGenghis Khan\n\nWrathchild\n\nThe Ides of March\n\nTwilight Zone\n\nProdigal Son\n\nAnother Life\n\nInnocent Exile\n\nDrifter\n\nPurgatory\n\nRating: 4/10\n\n15. The Final Frontier (2010)\n\nAfter the awesome albums that were BNW, DOD, and AMOLAD, expectations were high for Maiden's fifteenth album. With a name like \"The Final Frontier\" there was also worry that it would be the band's final. Thank god it wasn't, because this honestly wouldn't have been the best way to exit with. It's not a bad album, but as a whole, the songs seem a bit less good than ones from literally every other album. It's a good album when listening to it, but it's just not the band at their peak. Thank god we still got The Book of Souls... now that album is something else.\n\nThe Talisman\n\nWhen The Wild Wind Blows\n\nEl Dorado\n\nStarblind\n\nIsle of Avalon\n\nSatellite 15... The Final Frontier\n\nThe Alchemist\n\nComing Home\n\nMother of Mercy\n\nThe Man Who Would Be King\n\nRating: 5/10\n\n14. Iron Maiden (1980)\n\nIt may be low on this list, but there's a lot to love about Maiden's classic debut album. All of the songs (except for \"Remember Tomorrow\") are pretty decent, and it's an enjoyable listen overall. Definitely the best way to kick off the best band in the world. Still, there are 13 other albums which, I think at least, are better than this one. But this is definitely a better album that the bottom two. As a whole, a nice work.\n\nIron Maiden\n\nPhantom of the Opera\n\nProwler\n\nStrange World\n\nRunning Free\n\nTransylvania\n\nSanctuary\n\nCharlotte the Harlot\n\nRemember Tomorrow\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n13. No Prayer For The Dying (1990)\n\nI don't consider this a step-down from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. It feels like a natural progression on from it. All of the songs on here are decent (though \"Fates Warning\" isn't too great), and as a whole it's an enjoyable listen. It's sad because I like it a lot, but there are 12 better albums. *Sigh*. Oh the woes of being a Maiden Fan.\n\nTailgunner\n\nMother Russia\n\nRun Silent Run Deep\n\nBring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\n\nHooks In You\n\nNo Prayer For The Dying\n\nPublic Enema Number One\n\nHoly Smoke\n\nThe Assassin\n\nFates Warning\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n12. A Matter of Life and Death (2006)\n\nA monster album, certainly. Not perfect, though - \"Out of the Shadows\" is meh, \"These Colours Don't Run\" isn't too memorable, and \"The Longest Day\" is very anticlimactic. The rest, though, range from good to great. I wouldn't say a step-down from BNW and DOD, but it isn't as good at the same stroke. Still love it though.\n\nThe Legacy\n\nDifferent World\n\nFor The Greater Good Of God\n\nLord of Light\n\nBrighter Than A Thousand Suns\n\nThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\n\nThe Pilgrim\n\nThese Colours Don't Run\n\nThe Longest Day\n\nOut of the Shadows\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n11. The Number of the Beast (1982)\n\nAh yes, it's the immortal classic. The album that single-handedly took Maiden from a fairly popular NWOBHM act to a monster leading the metal charge during the '80s. And, for the most part, it lives up to the hype that surrounds it. That said, Maiden have done better overall. Bruce's vocals definitely needed some time to mature as well; he sounds much better on POM overall. Still, the monsters on this album are truly monstrous and the worst songs are still pretty damn good.\n\nRun To The Hills\n\nHallowed Be Thy Name\n\nTotal Eclipse\n\nThe Number of the Beast\n\nThe Prisoner\n\nChildren of the Damned\n\n22 Acacia Avenue\n\nGangland\n\nInvaders\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n10. Piece of Mind (1983)\n\nTNOTB is a good album, but Piece of Mind is an instant step-up. Bruce sounds less raw and more in control of his singing, which is now a lot better. The production is better as well, and the band is really on fire. Used to be my least favorite Bruce-era '80s album, but it's rising. Good stuff all around.\n\nStill Life\n\nFlight of Icarus\n\nThe Trooper\n\nTo Tame A Land\n\nSun and Steel\n\nRevelations\n\nWhere Eagles Dare\n\nDie With Your Boots On\n\nQuest For Fire\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n9. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)\n\nI legitimately don't know what happened. For the longest time, this was my second favorite Maiden album overall.... but something's slipped. I'm not quite sure what it was that did it, but it felt less... lively when I relistened to it again. I nearly dozed off. Hopefully this one will rise again. It's still a great album but... yeah, not near my favorite any longer. *Sigh*.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do\n\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\n\nInfinite Dreams\n\nOnly The Good Die Young\n\nCan I Play With Madness\n\nMoonchild\n\nThe Clairvoyant\n\nThe Prophecy\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n8. Fear of the Dark (1992)\n\nI've long been a defender of this highly underrated album. Many people say it has some of Maiden's worst songs; the only one that could be considered a \"worst\" is \"Childhood's End\", the rest are decent to outstanding. \"Judas Be My Guide\", \"The Apparition\", \"Weekend Warrior\", \"Fear of the Dark\", \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\", and \"From Here To Eternity\" are six really awesome songs. Love this album. Doesn't deserve the hate.\n\nJudas Be My Guide\n\nThe Apparition\n\nWeekend Warrior\n\nFear of the Dark\n\nAfraid to Shoot Strangers\n\nFrom Here To Eternity\n\nBe Quick Or Be Dead\n\nThe Fugitive\n\nWasting Love\n\nChains of Misery\n\nFear Is The Key\n\nChildhood's End\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n7. Somewhere In Time (1986)\n\nFor a long time, this was my favorite Maiden album ever... that was before Powerslave really annihilated the competition. Still, SIT is a damn fine album. The feel, the vibe, the production, the playing - it's all good. Bruce isn't always perfect on here but when he is, he fucking is. The space-y theme is great, and the synths are the perfect way to elevate it to the next level. Great album.\n\nAlexander the Great\n\nWasted Years\n\nDeja Vu\n\nStranger in a Strange Land\n\nHeaven Can Wait\n\nSea of Madness\n\nThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\n\nCaught Somewhere In Time\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n6. Virtual XI (1998)\n\nA very overhated album in the metal community. Sure, it's got its fair share of flaws, but for some reason they really appeal to me. Blaze sounds great, the band may not be flying like they were on other albums, but it's well-assembled with many underrated tracks. \"Como Estais Amigos\" is a Top 3 Maiden track. Love this album.\n\nComo Estais Amigos\n\nThe Clansman\n\nDon't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger\n\nLightning Strikes Twice\n\nThe Angel and the Gambler\n\nFutureal\n\nWhen Two Worlds Collide\n\nThe Educated Fool\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n5. Dance of Death (2003)\n\nAnother underrated Maiden album, this one is experimental to its core, and I love it because of that. \"Paschendale\" and \"Journeyman\" are incredible songs, and all the rest are damn good as well. The cover mirrors the album, IMO, so I don't even hate that. As a whole, excellent follow-up to BNW and proof positive that this line-up wasn't afraid to take risks. Now if someone could just fix that production....\n\nPaschendale\n\nJourneyman\n\nGates of Tomorrow\n\nFace in the Sand\n\nNo More Lies\n\nMontsegur\n\nRainmaker\n\nAge of Innocence\n\nDance of Death\n\nWildest Dreams\n\nNew Frontier\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n4. Brave New World (2000)\n\nJesus, this one rose a lot. Released a little less than a year before my birth, this album used to be my least favorite from the band. Now it's #4. Why is that? I'm not quite sure, but there is a ton to love about it. It's not the comeback album everyone heralds it as, but it is a powerful, strong way to usher Bruce and Adrian back into the fold. Excellent stuff.\n\nOut of the Silent Planet\n\nThe Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n\nDream of Mirrors\n\nBrave New World\n\nThe Mercenary\n\nBlood Brothers\n\nThe Nomad\n\nThe Wicker Man\n\nThe Fallen Angel\n\nGhost of the Navigator\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n3. The Book of Souls (2015)\n\nReleased less than three years ago, it's incredible that Maiden's newest album could hold its own among so many classic albums. But it does! Individually, some of the songs aren't as good as many of the other songs from the band, but as a whole, when a part of this much larger work, they're really great and play off each other well. And obviously, this album is the one that features the single greatest songs of all time, \"Empire of the Clouds\". It's good without that song, but with it, it's stupendous. Love it. Can't wait to see if they can top it.\n\nEmpire of the Clouds\n\nThe Red and the Black\n\nIf Eternity Should Fail\n\nTears of a Clown\n\nDeath or Glory\n\nThe Book of Souls\n\nSpeed of Light\n\nThe Great Unknown\n\nThe Man of Sorrows\n\nWhen The River Runs Deep\n\nShadows of the Valley\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n2. The X Factor (1995)\n\nSteve Harris was in a dark place in 1995. The greatest singer in metal history, Bruce Dickinson, had abandoned him to pursue a solo career, and 'Arry was also in the midst of a messy divorce and several other issues in his life. He \"felt like suicide a dozen times or more\". But thank god he didn't end it all there, instead bringing one Blaze Bayley on board to sing for this album. And my god, do these guys knock it out of the park. The X Factor is a masterpiece of an album. Every single song fits it, and it's a dark but hopeful, earnest album. It's the most personal thing the band would ever release, and that sells it. Perfect, utterly perfect. It deserves number one... but there is an album that's just a tad better. I bet you know what it is.\n\nLord of the Flies\n\nSign of the Cross\n\nJudgement of Heaven\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nFortunes of War\n\nThe Unbeliever\n\nThe Edge of Darkness\n\n2 AM\n\nBlood on the World's Hands\n\nLook for the Truth\n\nMan on the Edge\n\nRating: 11/10\n\n1. Powerslave (1984)\n\nThe X Factor is a perfect album, but Powerslave takes it to another level. The songwriting is supreme, the vocals and instruments are at their absolute peak, it's tight, it's well-produced, it's metallic to a tee, it's got some of the best songs Maiden would ever released (the lowest song on here is #37 on my list, out of 155). It's just... the goddamn best. Alongside Bruce's The Chemical Wedding and Ahab's The Call of the Wretched Sea, it's a contender for greatest album ever. I love it. It gets better with each listen. Perfection.\n\nRime of the Ancient Mariner\n\nAces High\n\nPowerslave\n\nBack in the Village\n\n2 Minutes To Midnight\n\nFlash of the Blade\n\nThe Duellists\n\nLosfer Words (Big 'Orra)\n\nRating: 11/10\n\nSo yeah. Keep in mind that this list isn't set in stone; this is merely what I think at the moment."
