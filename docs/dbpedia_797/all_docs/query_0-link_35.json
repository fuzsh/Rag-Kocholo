Baby, you werenât there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect? You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch Donât overreact â I pretended he was you You wouldnât want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand? I didnât let him hold my hand But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you No he wasnât you But you can still trust me, this ainât infidelity Itâs not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you But I heard love is blindâ¦"
