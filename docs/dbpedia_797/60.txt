A while ago, I came up with the idea of a wand class called the Clairvoyant. At the time I didn’t have a good grasp on how I wanted it to work, but I’ve got it much more fleshed out now, as well as some new ideas.

Here’s what the base class skin would look like, in motion:

Weapon: Wand, Armor: Robe, Ability: Third Eye

Maximum Base Stats:

670 HP, 385 MP, 50 Attack, 25 Defense, 60 Speed, 65 Dexterity, 50 Vitality, 60 Wisdom

Average at 20:

590 HP, 290 MP, 40 Attack, 0 Defense, 35 Speed, 40 Dexterity, 35 Vitality, 35 Wisdom

Starting Stats:

100 HP, 100 MP, 10 Attack, 0 Defense, 10 Speed, 20 Dexterity, 10 Vitality, 15 Wisdom

Third Eye Ability

Behavior: Using the ability spawns a set number of circular projectiles around your mouse, the distance from the mouse is yet to be determined but most likely they’ll keep an average of 1-1.5 tiles away from your mouse. There is a half-second delay before the projectiles begin to move, and during that half-second they do no damage, but still follow the mouse. They spin in a clockwise rotation, and deal damage any time they pass through an enemy. The most accurate comparison would be the fractured gemstone wakizashi, which is nearly identical in how it spins and damages.

As you progress in tier, the eye opens more and more. The names are not set in stone.

Changelog for current thread:

~ @Orsome, and @Playcool pointed out this works much more like the crystal waki than the bulwark, which I overlooked since I haven’t gotten a crystal waki yet and seen what it does, that comparison’s been changed.

~ @Orsome pointed out another thing I’d overlooked. I wanted self-daze to be a sort of balance for the DPS the eye would provide, while not actually giving the eye enough damage to compete with the DPS of most wands a player would get around the same tier. The damage has been buffed heavily on all eyes.

Changes from the original design:_

~ Eyes are now “Third Eyes” rather than “Glass Eyes”

~ Eyes no longer have a DoT effect and instead have a set amount of damage for each projectile

~ Eyes have drastically less projectile spawns and reduced durations

~ Tile range removed from eyes, as it was increasing with each individual tier

~ MP Cost slightly reduced for T4-T6

~ ST set added

~ Stat bonuses to UT eyes balanced a bit better

~ Sugar Rush no longer grants berserk, but instead ignores def

Note: This is still not totally finished. I highly welcome and encourage feedback on this, especially in the stats areas, and on the ST’s stats, as they were the hardest part of this.
