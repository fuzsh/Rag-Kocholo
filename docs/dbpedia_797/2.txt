What should a girl and her himbeau get up to when they have a whole month of downtime before she releases her hotly anticipated 11th album? It’s a classic conundrum. While the answer might be different for you and your partner, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are using this time for “nesting.”

“They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,” a source told Us Weekly. “They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed.” Do you think they’re watching The Eras Tour on Disney+ just to make sure everything looks okay? Or are they putting work aside for a bit and watching Love Is Blind? Maybe they’re catching up on the Oscars. Here’s my impression of Travis Kelce watching Oppenheimer: “Yoooo, babe, that’s that dude from Peaky Blinders!”

The couple have been in Los Angeles for the past week, sort of lying low. They reportedly attended Madonna’s Oscars party on Sunday, and later that night Kelce was spotted at Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s annual Gold Party on his own. Swift hasn’t been spotted out since, while Kelce has been seen getting lunch with friends and going to a Justin Timberlake show that turned into an ’N Sync reunion. This man is taking full advantage of the City of Angels.
