Owen Barfield is not a well-known writer, at least not as well-known as some of the varied writers he influenced: Nobel Prize-winner Saul Bellow and J.R.R. Tolkien, Pulitzer Prize-winner Howard Nemerov and C.S. Lewis. Most of Barfield’s name recognition is due to his affiliation with Tolkien and Lewis as one of the Inklings, because his name is usually included as one of the four best-known members, rounded out by Charles Williams. This post is intended to be a frequently updated resource for anyone interested in Barfield, as well as a depository for my own notes as I try to understand his thought.
