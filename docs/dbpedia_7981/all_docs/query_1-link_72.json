        "text": "In The Fellowship, Philip and Carol Zaleski examine the lives and works of J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Owen Barfield and Charles Williams, but – their book's subtitle notwithstanding – the focus is less literary than religious or metaphysical. What did the Inklings, as this group of friends called themselves, believe? How did their beliefs affect their writing and thinking? What did they hope to achieve with their novels, stories and non-fiction? These are the sort of questions that most interest the Zaleskis. Overall, they argue that the Inklings aimed at nothing less than \"a revitalisation of Christian intellectual and imaginative life\".\n\nThis thesis isn't surprising given Carol Zaleski teaches religion at Smith College and her husband, Philip, once edited The Best American Spiritual Writing series. Yet the couple's ideological approach hasn't precluded them from packing an enormous amount of biographical information and useful insight into The Fellowship. Did you know that Lewis read E.R. Eddison's heroic fantasy The Worm Ouroboros at least six times? That Tolkien loathed Dorothy L. Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey more than any other character in literature? That in the late '50s Marquette University, a Catholic university in Wisconsin, bought the manuscripts of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien works for just £1500?\n\nLoading..."
