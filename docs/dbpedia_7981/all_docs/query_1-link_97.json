        "text": "There are surprisingly few reviews of Owen Barfield’s Unancestral Voice. The back cover says it has “the makings of a spiritual thriller”, in which Barfield “ranges from current problems in microscopic physics to Christian theology in speculating on the concepts of spirit, physicality, space, and transformation.” Elsewhere it is described as a spiritual quest. In my search of the Internet I found some reviews but none that addressed the enigmatic quality that I believe defines this book above all other considerations. I think “enigmatic” is the right descriptor because its synonyms include augury, mystery, allusion, riddle, puzzle, paradox, and conundrum. I would even go so far as to invoke Churchill who used a similar phrase to describe Russia, “It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” To open up to the mystery of Unancestral Voice, is to open up to the experience of Barfield’s most central concern for our times: the structure of consciousness known as final participation!
