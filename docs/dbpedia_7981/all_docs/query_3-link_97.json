        "text": "May 9, 2019\n\nI was hard on the first volume, The Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune 1915-1964 in the June 2015 issue of The New Criterion. Let me summarize the charge sheet: A book promulgated by Bellow’s agent, Andrew Wylie, and as such designed as damage control, minimizing Bellow’s faults as writer and human being that James Atlas revealed in Bellow: A Biography (2000). Leader, it seemed to me, had not shaped his biography very well, shifting too much between different periods of Bellow’s life, telegraphing the future before the narrative could adequately handle it. In short, too many narrative interruptions.\n\nWell, either Leader has absorbed my criticism or I misread him in the first place. The second volume seems to me almost impeccable in its narrative drive, unsparing in its revelations of Bellow’s failings, and most generous to Bellow’s previous biographers, especially James Atlas. In this volume, Leader shows how Atlas drew out various aspects of Bellow’s personality in their many positive and negative contacts. Leader has made splendid use of Atlas’s memoir, The Shadow in the Garden: A Biographer’s Tale (2017).\n\nAll of Bellow’s later works get their due, with Leader showing how expertly Bellow crafted fiction out of his biography. A case in point is Leader’s treatment of Ravelstein (2002), inspired by Allan Bloom, famous as author of The Closing of the American Mind (1987), a jeremiad against the college curriculum that no longer took the classics seriously and made possible a culture of relativism and permissiveness. The book became a huge best seller with a great send-off by Bellow himself, who associated many of the ideas in the book with his own lamentations about the chaos of contemporary culture in novels like Mr. Sammler’s Planet (1970). Bellow and Bloom taught together at the University of Chicago and evidently became so close that Bloom encouraged Bellow to write about him. Bellow had to decide whether to write a memoir or a novel. That he chose the latter is not surprising, since fiction gave him the freedom to write a book animated by his friend but not slavishly bound to facts in the manner of biography, a genre Bellow distrusted because it distorted truth by hewing too closely to fact. Only fiction provided a broad enough context to capture a figure as protean as Bloom.\n\nThe energy of Ravelstein when Bellow was well into his seventies is impressive, but that is not what many critics wanted to discuss. Bloom, a homosexual, had been discreet about his private life and Bellow had outed him, suggesting, as well, that Bloom had died of AIDS. To considerable uproar from Bloom’s friends and other critics, Bellow confessed some regret about exposing his friend. Leader does not take sides, and in this instance, I wish he had done so. However many resemblances are to be found between Ravelstein and Bloom, they are not one and the same, and Bellow—usually not shy about brushing off his detractors—should have said nothing or struck back. Even a biography of Bloom would not have been Bloom. It would have been a book. That people persist in faulting novelists or biographers for offering skewed accounts of their subjects seems ridiculous to me. What life is not askew? The answer to one biography is another biography, as we have it now with Atlas and Leader and the other Bellow biographers that Leader never forgets in his honorable narrative.\n\nImplicitly Leader provides an rebuttal to those who decry Bellow’s use of friends and others to create his characters. Leader shows that some of Bellow’s friends were flattered by the literary uses he made of their personalities. They became more interesting, more pointed, more dramatic, than they thought they were, born anew as Saul Bellow characters. Which is to say that fiction, however much you want to string it to real-life models, is still fiction.\n\nBellow reminds me of a very different novelist, Anthony Powell, who constantly put the résumes of his intimates and acquaintances onto the pages of his glorious A Dance to the Music of Time, a series of twelve novels that chart a good deal of twentieth-century history, as do Bellow’s works. Bellow goes Powell one better, I think, because of the Bellowian play of ideas. He took ideas seriously, but he also treated them comically, and drew back from commitment to positions—not because he was a gadfly, as some supposed, but because of his understanding that ideas take you only so far and cannot be separated from personality and character.\n\nThe most moving passages of Leader’s biography are the many scenes of Saul Bellow in old age, trying to come to terms with his five marriages and the sons who remained in certain respects bitter because he was not there for many of the crucial events in their lives. Bellow acknowledged his derelictions of duty, but in his ill tempered moments he remained wounding and unforgivable. He was closer to novelists like Martin Amis and Philp Roth, adopted sons, than to his biological offspring. His fellow writers revered his unflinching dissections of the American character—not exactly what you want to hear from Dad, though, when he turns his merciless perceptions on you.\n\nIt was different with Bellow’s last marriage, in which his wife, Janis, more than four decades younger than her husband, learned not only to accept but to manage his vagaries as well as providing him with a daughter when he was well into his eighties. This final marriage changed Saul Bellow, although Leader does not say so in so many words. Did Bellow become more tolerant because Janis showed him the way? She was the first wife to have the resilience and intelligence to master him in all his moods, although that is not to blame the other wives for not doing so. It was a matter of timing and temperament, I think. The patient and resilient Janis came along at just the right moment when Bellow was musing over his earlier failures in love and child rearing.\n\nBellow gave his biographer a gift. At the very end, even with dementia that can turn to anger, he became, for the most part, kind and gentle and generous, continuing to teach—oh how he loved the contact with young people over six decades in the university. I suppose he finally understood he had nothing more to prove and could open himself up. He needed no defending, or rather Janis was there to play defense if required.\n\nIn the end, Zachary Leader has produced one of the most inspiring biographies of an American writer that we are not likely to see again for quite a long time.\n\nApril 17, 2021\n\nSaul Bellow seems to have faded into irrelevance largely due to his reputation as an outspoken conservative as he aged. Many consider him elitist; his opinions are a bit more nuanced than as categorized by his enemies. It was duly noted that when I posted Bellow’s “Mr. Sammler’s Planet” as a book of the day last month, nary a person liked or commented. And that book is one of the best books with a plot in NYC and at least three scenes that are iconic in 20th century literature. The silence to that Book of the Day was deafening.\n\nThe second volume of Zachary Leader’s Bellow biography was released last month; the reviews are as funny and disturbing as the book itself. Th latest volume begins with Saul Bellow at the height of his fame, after he won the National Book Award in 1965 for “Herzog” and continues to his death in 2005. In between there are mistresses, marriages, academic spats and grudges and more mistresses.\n\nThe biography, at its best, chronicles the gradual conservative creep of an aging author. Most of us become a bit more conservative as we age. In the case of Bellow, the shift was extreme from a young Trotskyite to an aging academic at the University of Chicago writing and railing against urban slums. While one might not agree with him, Bellow’s thought processes are always fascinating, as is the chronicling of this conservative creep and his spats with more liberal academic colleagues and the backdrop of student protests in which they occurred.\n\nThough I’ve never found the sexual escapades of others in the least riveting, Bellow was a true scoundrel with multiple mistresses, bitter divorce lawsuits (one which went on for over a decade), and an ability to attract and marry women 20-35 years younger than him. In one truly hysterical scene, one mistress confronts another during a social gathering in Bellow’s Chicago apartment:\n\n“What Maggie remembers of this encounter is that when Arlette walked into the room she immediately took her sweater off over her head. Maggie thought, ‘Wow, this is really out of my league,’ by which she meant showy, vulgar. She also remembers that, before Arlette was let in, Bellow grabbed his manuscript and hid it in the refrigerator.”\n\nThe man had his priorities!\n\nBiographer Zachary Leader leaves no stone unturned and has a wonderful way of portraying Bellow, warts and all, without appearing vindictive or tell-all. The biography is scholarly and worthy of the figure it portrays. The best quote comes from the bitter ex-wife of one of Bellow’s academic, tail-chasing friends who described her ex-husband, more than twenty years after the fact, as, “Pursuing a degree in Comparative Gynecology.” That line is just so tasty and needs to be in mainstream vernacular."
