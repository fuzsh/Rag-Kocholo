        "text": "A few days ago, in the New York Times, there was a review of the recently published letters of Saul Bellow: ‘one of Bellow’s greatest books’ we are told. The rest of the review is actually equally interesting, but I have chosen to quote the part pertaining to Bellow’s involvement in anthroposophy and with anthroposophist Owen Barfield:\n\n‘In the mid-1970s, there came a crisis. The dazzling representation of the appearances no longer satisfied Bellow. “For some time now,” he writes to Owen Barfield in 1975, “I have been asking what kind of knowledge a writer has.” The “interest of much of life as represented in the books I read (and perhaps some that I wrote) had been exhausted. But how could existence itself become uninteresting.” He concludes that “images or representations this side of the mirror have indeed tired us out.” Even more startlingly, he informs Barfield that “lately I have become aware, not of illumination itself, but of a kind of illuminated fringe — a peripheral glimpse of a different state of things.” Barfield was an extraordinary figure, a disciple of Rudolf Steiner’s eccentric “anthroposophy” and its belief in a spiritual world with which we may have direct acquaintance, but also a profound thinker in his own right about language and imagination and the spoliation of human inwardness by a scientific and technological civilization. Bellow’s letters to Barfield are perhaps the most fascinating in the book, not least because they are the only ones in which Bellow is humble.\n\n‘At Barfield’s suggestion, he undertook a study of Steiner — in defiance, to put it mildly, of his own skeptical and secular temperament. [. . .] His impish delight in outraging the advanced cultural consensus of his time might also have encouraged him in this flamboyantly anti-materialist heterodoxy. But not surprisingly, the doctrine did not win him. No doctrine ever did. In 1977 he confides to a friend that “I can’t manage this new kind of consciousness. I don’t know what to do about it.” And in 1979, in a dramatic letter to Barfield, he revolts. “I am troubled by your judgment of the books I’ve written. I don’t ask you to like what you obviously can’t help disliking, but I can’t easily accept your dismissal of so much investment of soul.”\n\n‘It is a stirring moment, and more than an outburst of pride. It is a vindication of the old calling on the new ground: he has found spirituality in the enterprise of fiction. The rumor of dessication is dispelled. He will have no more of the other side’s condescension to this side. Never mind that the form of the novel was built on the ruins of metaphysical certainty: novels, too, may be soulful.’\n\nThe review is full of brilliant Bellow quotes, so read it!"
