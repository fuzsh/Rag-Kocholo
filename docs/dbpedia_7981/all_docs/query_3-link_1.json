        "text": "“We often stopped before a display of children’s shoes. My mother coveted for me a pair of patent-leather sandals with an elegantissimo strap. I finally got them — I rubbed them with butter to preserve the leather. This is when I was 6 or 7 years old, a little older than Rosie is now. Amazing how it all boils down to a pair of patent-leather sandals.” Saul Bellow recorded that ancient memory, stirred to it by play with his little daughter, in a letter on Feb. 19, 2004, when he was 88 years old. It is the last letter in this magnificent book. The old master died a year later.\n\nThe “it” to which those talismanic shoes refer is what might be called the vernacular sublime, which was the object of Bellow’s inner exertions all his life. The story of his avenues and approaches and attacks in his campaign for it composes the plot of this collection. Everything leads to the epiphany of the sandals, and its triumphant creatureliness. The man is all here in this book, in his stunning, almost baffling plenitude. Bellow’s letters are — as anybody who corresponded with him must have expected them to be, and here I must disclose, or confess, or boast, that the volume includes also some gorgeous letters to me, written in the fullness of our friendship decades ago, when we used to worry over metaphysics and the novel as we chopped wood — one of Bellow’s greatest books. Benjamin Taylor records that it contains only two-fifths of what Bellow called his “epistling,” but its riches are nonetheless immense. Taylor has selected and edited and annotated these letters with exquisite judgment and care. This is an elegantissimo book. Our literature’s debt to Taylor, if our culture still cares, is considerable.\n\n“I have a certain feeling for reality,” Bellow wrote in 1961; and in 1974, “I know how to transform common matter.” As with those sandals, the poetry of his prose, its force of consciousness, lay always in its fidelity to the concrete. In the appearances of things and circumstances and psyches, he discerned the revelatory details. Bellow was a giant of description, and he knew it. About the editors of a certain magazine he wickedly remarked, in 1991, that “I could make those people very unhappy by describing them.” Perhaps it was the same scruple that made him confine so much of his shatteringly accurate portraiture to the dead.\n\nBellow’s cause was actuality, the whole mess of it. His ideal was wakefulness. Writing to an old schoolmate in 1948 — his lifelong devotion to the people of his youth is one of the most moving features of this book — he declares, almost creedally, that “the man we bring forth has no richness compared with the man who really exists, thickened, fed and fattened by all the facts about him, all of his history.” In 1956, in the aftermath of the early death of his cherished friend Isaac Rosenfeld, he professes in a melancholy letter to Delmore Schwartz’s ex-wife that in his writing he has “tried to make a little more reality, or tried to reclaim a little of infinite ­unreality.”\n\nThe justly celebrated vastness of Bellow’s metaphorical field was owed to this fight for veridical observation, this longing for true knowledge. Metaphor is the juxtaposition of disparate elements of the world in which an unsuspected commonality, an illuminating partial likeness, has been discovered, and the more unlikely the juxtaposition, the greater the consequent sensation of the unifying of the world; and so the range of a writer’s metaphor is a measure of the range of his cognition. The novelist, Bellow proclaims, must make himself aware of nothing less than “the total human situation.” Sometimes this magisterial sensitivity brings amusement. In a rueful letter about aging, he cites his “blue-cheese ankles.” Reporting merrily, in 1997, on a dinner for Vaclav Havel that turned into an admiring mob, he writes that “Havel and I chatted for about three minutes and were separated as if we were tomato seeds in the digestive tract.” This is the sort of drollery that gives evidence of an uncommonly large internal space. “The 19th century drove writers into attics,” he tells Alice Adams. “The 20th shuts them in nutshells. The only remedy is to declare yourself king, or queen, of infinite space.”\n\nIn the mid-1970s, there came a crisis. The dazzling representation of the appearances no longer satisfied Bellow. “For some time now,” he writes to Owen Barfield in 1975, “I have been asking what kind of knowledge a writer has.” The “interest of much of life as represented in the books I read (and perhaps some that I wrote) had been exhausted. But how could existence itself become uninteresting.” He concludes that “images or representations this side of the mirror have indeed tired us out.” Even more startlingly, he informs Barfield that “lately I have become aware, not of illumination itself, but of a kind of illuminated fringe — a peripheral glimpse of a different state of things.” Barfield was an extraordinary figure, a disciple of Rudolf Steiner’s eccentric “anthroposophy” and its belief in a spiritual world with which we may have direct acquaintance, but also a profound thinker in his own right about language and imagination and the spoliation of human inwardness by a scientific and technological civilization. Bellow’s letters to Barfield are perhaps the most fascinating in the book, not least because they are the only ones in which Bellow is humble.\n\nAt Barfield’s suggestion, he undertook a study of Steiner — in defiance, to put it mildly, of his own skeptical and secular temperament. Perhaps his old schooling in the Russian writers — “We were so Russian, as adolescents,” he recalls to Stanley Elkin in 1992 — inclined him to such explorations. His impish delight in outraging the advanced cultural consensus of his time might also have encouraged him in this flamboyantly anti-materialist heterodoxy. But not surprisingly, the doctrine did not win him. No doctrine ever did. In 1977 he confides to a friend that “I can’t manage this new kind of consciousness. I don’t know what to do about it.” And in 1979, in a dramatic letter to Barfield, he revolts. “I am troubled by your judgment of the books I’ve written. I don’t ask you to like what you obviously can’t help disliking, but I can’t easily accept your dismissal of so much investment of soul.”\n\nIn recent years, Bellow has been venerated primarily for his laughter and his language. His British admirers in particular, orphaned by the dreariness of their own postwar fiction and in abject (and rather boring) envy of American energy, have remade Bellow according to their need: a comic writer, a high mocker and essentially a stylist. There is some truth, obviously, to this worship of his ebullience, of the libertine vigor of his voice. Of all modern writers, Bellow somehow managed to combine intellectuality and vitality without compromising either of the indispensable terms. The life-force never deserted him, even as it was always attended by interpretation. The unruliness of existence was Bellow’s lasting theme; but while he studied it, he never quite ordered it. In his fiction and in his life, he seemed to believe in the fecundity of disorder.\n\nYet something is missing from the chortling celebration of Bellovian jollity, and that is its foundation in gloom. “Bitter melancholy” is “one of my specialties,” he tells Edward Shils in 1962. About “the power to despair,” he writes to a friend in 1961 that “having myself felt it, known it, bathed in it, my native and temperamental impulse is to return to sanity in the form of laughter.” The letters show a man constantly wresting high spirits from low, and forbidding himself “the newest wrinkle in anguish.” The charming and gregarious writer feels “almost astrally alone, but still “I’m out for sursum corda. Lift up the heart.” In 1968, in a letter to Meyer Schapiro about Delmore Schwartz (who had died two years earlier) and John Berryman (who would kill himself four years later), he remarks that “I see why these self-destructive lives are led. But I can’t convince myself that it is a good tradition.” There is an almost erotic charge to Bellow’s endless affirmations; they are so affecting because they are so willed. Since they are deeply reflective, they do not seem merely manic. “Really,” he writes to Lionel Trilling in 1952, “things are now what they always were, and to be disappointed in them is extremely shallow. We may not be strong enough to live in the present. But to be disappointed in it!”\n\nBellow was clear about the role of comedy in his work. “The real thing is unfathomable,” he declares in 1974. “You can’t get it down to distinct or clear opinion. Sensing this, I have always had intelligence enough (or the intuition) to put humor between myself and final claims.” To Richard Chase, in 1959, he remarks on his lack of “the will or the capacity to continue to a definite conclusion” — this was a charge frequently brought against his teeming novels — and explains that “I sometimes think the comedy in my books is a satire on this inconclusiveness.” The satire could sometimes be savage, of course; and he was usually not the object of his own cruelty. But the laughter in Bellow is mainly philosophical laughter. He had Camus’s lucidity, but not his solemnity. (“ ‘The Plague’ was an IDEA. Good or bad? Not so hot, in my opinion.”) His only equal in this attainment was Beckett, except for the abstraction and the allegory, which Bellow could do without. (In an archive Taylor found Beckett’s calling card, arranging for a meeting with Bellow in Paris — as Taylor nicely puts it, “the living embodiment of modernism was eager to meet the great quarreler with modernism.” The encounter was brief and uneventful.) There was nothing hip or cynical or self-satisfied about Bellow’s hilarity. It was a boisterous stoicism, a technique of perseverance.\n\nBellow liked to scoff at serious people, but he never left their company. He, too, always had something urgent to say. The Yiddish writer I. L. Peretz once castigated a critic (a Bellovian activity!) that it is not enough to speak Yiddish, you have to have something to say. The view of Bellow as primarily a stylist, the pleasure-seeking reading of Bellow, the cult of his sentences, is inadequate. His manner was rougher and more controversial, stubbornly animated by ultimate questions, motivated by mind, an intervention in society as well as in literature. Even greater than how he said what he said was what he had to say. His writings, these letters included, are efforts in explanation, or in the hunger for explanation. He did not compose manifestoes or programs, and he despised ideologies — Norman Mailer is “such an ideologist,” whereas “I do everything the hard way”; but his ridicule of intellectuals never led Bellow, as it did some of his contemporaries, to the barbarities of anti-intellectualism.\n\nDenouncing “culture-gravity,” he jokes to Bernard Malamud that “they say ‘picaresque’ and don’t laugh,” but Bellow laughed and said “picaresque.” The author of these letters was, from beginning to end, a genius reader, always returning to the old thinkers and writers, always tussling with them. He was, in his nature, one of their number. “Ideology is of no use to us in refurnishing the empty house,” he observes to Leslie Fiedler. What is of use, by contrast, is humanism. Humanism is “the most subversive of all — and I am a humanist.” The absence of irony from that avowal is like a cool breeze. Trotsky, Reich, Steiner: Bellow was forever chasing the answer, but his disappointments in belief never dissuaded him from the chase. “The best of me has formed in the jumps.” Finally he was — may this, too, be said without irony? — a seeker after truth.\n\nOne marvels for many reasons at the man who wrote these letters, but for no reason more than that he was a free man. I do not refer merely to his rebelliousness and his restlessness, to his “jail-breaking spirit.” He is beset by cares and obligations; his friends die and die and die; he makes a slop (until, in 1989, he marries Janis Freedman) of his private life; but nothing ever robs him of the free and unfettered use of his powers. “A language is a spiritual mansion from which no one can evict us,” and in that palace Bellow was sovereign. “The only sure cure is to write a book,” he advises Alice Adams. Only time, and the accidental ingestion of a poison fish in the tropics in 1994, dims him. Otherwise, for the duration of the long and unsinkable life chronicled in these pages, he is a large man growing larger, a spirit expanding, an unabating lightstorm, and “the name of the game is Give All.” He never loses his constancy of purpose. In the penultimate letter in this volume, in the winter of 2002, he sums himself up for a distant relative in a casual Abschied: “Actually, I’ve never stopped looking for the real thing; and often I find the real thing. To fall into despair is just a high-class way of turning into a dope. I choose to laugh, and laugh at myself no less than at others.” And then, on the next page, the final page, as if to verify his visionary relation to the real, the sandals."
