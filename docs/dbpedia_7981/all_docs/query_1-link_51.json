        "text": "In the most recent post, I made another bold claim: No group in history understood original meaning better than the Inklings.\n\nWhy is this important? And what does it even mean?\n\nIn his book An Experiment in Criticism, Lewis said:\n\n“Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors . . . My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others . . . I will see what others have invented . . . But in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poems, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see.”\n\nI believe the sentiment Lewis expressed about authors from the past can be true of our friends in the present, especially when our friends are members of the greatest literary collaborative fellowship in history: The Inklings. When he hosted meetings of the Inklings Lewis did not see through the eyes of a thousand men, only 10 or so. Oh, but what eyes!\n\nThe Inklings\n\nThe Inklings were a literary collaborative group that met casually at The Eagle and Child each Tuesday morning, and then more seriously on Thursday evenings in Lewis’ Magdalen College quarters.\n\nThe Inklings shared a love of literature. They were, to a man, lovers of myth and literature, fantasy and poetry, but it is not as if they were all cut from the same cloth—they were different. Each brought unique expertise and perspectives to the group.\n\nIn their book, The Fellowship, Phillip and Carol Zaleski offered a glimpse into their culture:\n\n“The Inklings resembled an intellectual orchestra, a gathering of sparkling talents in common cause, each participant the master of his own chosen instrument, be it literature, theology, philosophy or history.”\n\nPeople tend to think the Inklings were a group of “Literary Establishmentarians”, but in truth, they were quite radical. By the time the last Inkling passed away on the eve of the 21st Century, the group had altered the field of literature:\n\nThey altered the course of imaginative literature (fantasy, allegory, and mythopoeia).\n\nThey altered Christian theology, and Western philosophy.\n\nThey altered comparative mythology, courtly love, faerie, and epic poetry.\n\nThey altered the scholarly study of Beowulf, Dante, Spenser, and Milton.\n\nOther Literary Collaborative Groups\n\nThe Inklings gathered to indulge a great passion held in common. They were not the first literary collaborative group in history, but many believe they were the most impactful such group ever.\n\nEarlier groups include the following:\n\nThe “Scriblerus Club” (early 1800s)\n\nAlexander Pope\n\nJonathan Swift\n\nHenry St. John\n\nJohn Gay\n\n“The Club” (late 1800s)\n\nSamuel Johnson\n\nJoshua Reynolds\n\nEdmund Burke\n\nAdam Smith\n\nEdward Gibbon\n\nThe “Bloomsbury Group” (early 1900s)\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nE.M. Forster\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nDuncan Grant\n\nThese groups now occupy the dustbin of history. Meanwhile, the Inklings continue to shape significant aspects of modern religion and worldwide culture.\n\nI repeat my claim: No group in history understood original meaning better than the Inklings.\n\nWhy is this important? Because “Comprehension” means extracting the most accurate understanding of the author’s intended meaning. C.S. Lewis had an unparalleled talent for “Comprehension”, quite possibly exceeding any other person in history. But Lewis was better at “Comprehension” because of his collaboration with the Inklings.\n\nMembers of the Inklings\n\nAll members of the Inklings were attuned to the importance of English literature, myth, linguistics, language, etymology, philology, rhetoric and semantics. They were all advocates of religion, though they were members of different denominations.\n\nKey members included:\n\nC.S. Lewis was an expert in English literature, semantics, and literary criticism (and many other topics). He was the founder and leader of the Inklings.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien was a philologist who loved linguistic aesthetics, artificial languages and especially mythopoeia, like Beowulf. He was a professor of English Language and Literature at Merton College, Oxford.\n\nOwen Barfield was a lawyer, an author and philosopher. His chief passions were literature, language, philosophy, and human perception.\n\nCharles Williams was Editor of the Oxford University Press and an expert on Dante and English poetry.\n\nLord David Cecil was the aristocrat among the Inklings. As the grandson of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, he did not have to write or teach, but he did. He was one of Oxford’s best-loved teachers. His best works were biographies of Sir Walter Scott and Jane Austen.\n\nNeville Coghill was a Merton Professor of English Literature. He is most famous for his work on Chaucer. He also had a keen interest in dramatic productions, once directing Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nHugo Dyson taught at Reading University and Merton College. He and J.R.R. Tolkien were most involved in Lewis’ acceptance of Christianity.\n\nJ.A.W. Bennett was a close colleague of Lewis at Magdalen College. He was a great medievalist, and taught Anglo-Saxon. After Lewis’ death he succeeded him as Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge.\n\nAdam Fox was a Dean of Divinity and Professor of Poetry at Magdalen College, then later a Canon at Westminster Abbey. He is buried in Poet’s Corner.\n\nColin Hardie taught at Baliol College, Oxford, then later at Magdalen College. He specialized in the writings of Virgil.\n\nJohn Wain was a novelist, poet and critic and a former student of Lewis. Like Boswell, he wrote an excellent biography of Samuel Johnson.\n\nRobert Havard was a physician. Lewis referred to him as the “Useless Quack.”\n\nWarren Lewis was a retired military man, and C.S. Lewis brother.\n\nIt is not my purpose to give each member the attention they deserve. To that end, I recommend three books by experts who can tell you so much more about the members of the Inklings and the group culture. They are:\n\nThe Company They Keep: C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien as Writers in Community (by Diana Pavlac Glyer).\n\nBandersnatch: C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and the Creative Collaboration of the Inklings (by Diana Pavlac Glyer).\n\nThe Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings (by Philip and Carol Zaleski).\n\n“Meet the Inklings” Who Mattered Most\n\nAll members of the Inklings were brilliant, and most of them were successful authors on their own merits. But the greatest were J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, and Owen Barfield.\n\n(a) J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nTolkien and Lewis were blessed with a collaborative friendship on the order of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Without Lewis’ encouragement, Tolkien might never have completed The Lord of the Rings. Without their mutual pact to “write the books they wanted to read” Lewis might never have written The Space Trilogy.\n\nMost people assume that J.R.R. Tolkien was the most important of the Inklings and that he had the greatest influence on Lewis. To be sure, Tolkien was the most famous of the Inklings. He taught Lewis the truth in old myths. Moreover, he had the greatest impact upon Lewis’ faith journey. But I do not think he was the most important Inkling.\n\n(b) Charles Williams\n\nCharles Williams came later and was invited to join the Inklings by Lewis. By any measure, Williams was the oddest Inkling, but an unusually charismatic person. Williams was a swirling mass of contradictions; he was not simple and happy but complex and tortured. He was a man “trembling with nervousness” who was always chattering away with “staccato eagerness”. He gave an impression of electric animation, a bundle of raw nerves, spewing ideas, conveying images and spouting observations in all directions. His personal magnetism must have been virtually radioactive to judge from his admirers; for to be with him was to find yourself in the presence of someone utterly unique and astonishing.\n\nWilliams wrote The English Poetic Mind, a survey of English poetry to discern what separates the truly great poets from those who can’t quite rise to the same standard. Williams was a renowned expert on the Arthurian legend and also Dante’s Divine Comedy. Moreover, as Editor with Oxford University Press, he was exceedingly well read.\n\nTolkien disliked him intensely, but Lewis simply enjoyed his company. Of Williams writings, Lewis was most intrigued by the “supernatural thrillers” Williams wrote. He is sometimes referred to as “the Stephen King of spirituality.”\n\nTheologically, Williams was a bit “out there.” He was an enigmatic man whose foray in the Golden Dawn and dabbling in Rosicrucianism disturbed some, especially Tolkien. Williams had a taste for the occult. His friend T.S. Eliot saw Williams as having profound insights into evil. Eliot once said of Williams:\n\n“For him there was no frontier between the material and the spiritual world. Had I ever to spend a night in a haunted house, I should have felt secure with Williams in my company; he was somehow protected from evil, and was himself a protection.”\n\nWilliams developed the concept of “co-inherence” (the practice of substitutionary suffering and the bearing one another’s burdens, including pain and illness). Lewis experienced the spiritual power of “co-inherence” in the temporary healing of his wife, Joy.\n\n(c) Owen Barfield\n\nIn a dedication in The Allegory of Love, C.S. Lewis wrote:\n\n“The wisest and best of my unofficial counselors . . . Barfield towers above us all.”\n\nOther than Lewis, I consider Owen Barfield to be the most important of all the Inklings. He was not the most consequential of Inkling meeting attendees, but he was the Inkling who was most consequential to C.S. Lewis. I see Barfield’s impact upon Lewis to be less than but approaching that of George MacDonald and G.K. Chesterton.\n\nBarfield was Lewis’ greatest friend from their college days. He was Lewis’ “second friend”, meaning the friend who has all the same interests as you, but who holds diametrically opposed positions on nearly every one of them.\n\nThey rigorously debated a wide range of topics, from epistemology to philosophy to theology. In the 1920s, Lewis and Barfield engaged in a rigorous but civil debate on philosophy, which they called “the Great War”. It was from Barfield that Lewis came to appreciate the validity of old ideas, and to understand the inherent bias against old ideas merely because they are old.\n\nBarfield’s seminal works, The History in English Words and Poetic Diction, influence etymology even today. His Saving the Appearances and The Rediscovery of Meaning created a new paradigm for meaning. His Evolution of Consciousness took him into the realm of human perception never before explored to the same extent.\n\nOwen Barfield was the Coleridge-Like theorizer who got the Inklings thinking deeply on the Philosophy of Language. Four themes on perception ran through Barfield’s works, including:\n\nThe importance of the imagination.\n\nThe relationship between imagination and meaning.\n\nThe evolution of human consciousness.\n\nHow this evolution is revealed in the “evolution of language”.\n\nThrough Barfield, Lewis came to understand how “imagination” and “reason” are both essential to the pursuit of truth, but with very different roles. Everything that we understand from life experiences or revelation comes to us through imagination. Imagination is antecedent to reason. The role of reason is merely to assess validity of that meaning.\n\nFor 70 years, Barfield was devoted to understanding the evolution of human consciousness, and how the evolution in language reveals this evolution of consciousness by serving much like a fossil record.\n\nIt is fascinating thinking, but not easy reading. I recommend my readers look into Barfield’s ideas . . . of course, many of you have already. A good (and accessible) place to start is with this book about Barfield’s theories: Reweaving the Rainbow: The Thought of Owen Barfield edited by David Lavery.\n\nAll the Inklings were brilliant thinkers, but Owen Barfield is the only one who could be considered Lewis’ intellectual equal. He was revered by T.S. Eliot, W.H Auden, Walter de la Mare, Saul Bellow and Marshall McLuhan and most of all by C.S. Lewis.\n\nAs Lewis said of “The Great War” in Surprised by Joy: “Out of this perpetual dogfight a community of mind and a deep affection emerge. But I think he changed me a good deal more than I him.”\n\nSo, in the final analysis, why is C.S. Lewis’ association with The Inklings important? Because it extended the reach of his “Comprehension”. His twice-weekly interaction with this group of gifted thinkers–all committed to truth, all keenly interested in old books, and all seeking the author’s original meaning–provided Lewis with an entirely different layer of “Comprehension”.\n\nThere are other nominees for designation as “the most erudite person in history,” but I cannot imagine any of them had powers of comprehension on a par with C.S. Lewis. None of them had access to a cadre of “like-minds” to fire-test and augment his thinking.\n\nWith the next post I move into the section on “Retention.” It is the final factor in my effort to build a compelling case that C.S. Lewis is (plausibly) the most erudite person in history."
