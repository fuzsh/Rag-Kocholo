        "text": "Foreword\n\nSitting in my study, it seems that every news article is filled with updates about the coronavirus pandemic. We are undoubtedly facing a unique and unprecedented challenge, with millions of souls across the world experiencing some form of enforced isolation due to an invisible, airborne enemy. In so many ways, the situation is one of individual and collective tragedy. However, it is also an opportunity for quietness, reflection – to look within as well as beyond towards a deeper participation in all Creation. This timely collection of Grandfather’s most significant poems and plays offers to take us on such a journey into the poetic imagination. The Taylors are insightful and knowledgeable guides on this voyage of exploration, and I am equally grateful for their scholarship and company!\n\nGrandfather wrote extensively across a range of genres – from children’s fantasy adventure to science fiction, monographs on economics, and even collaborating with Tolkien on the odd spoof examination paper for the more inactive members of his walking club – the Cretaceous Perambulators, which was largely composed of the Inklings and their friends. But he always thought of himself as a poet at heart – poetry was his first love. I think he would be completely thrilled with this thoughtful and valuable publication.\n\nOwen A. Barfield\n\nGrandson & Trustee\n\nOxfordshire, England\n\nApril 2020\n\nwww.owenbarfield.org\n\nPreface\n\nThis compilation of Owen Barfield’s major poems and plays is the result of a bit of sleuthing. It began with a six-day visit to the Bodleian Library to peruse the Owen Barfield Archive in early 2016 during which we happily encountered some of the literary works included in this collection. A second trip to the Bodleian followed in early 2018. We approached this collection as scholars who were familiar with—and applied to our own scholarship—Barfield’s theories on the evolution of consciousness as laid out in his numerous publications over the course of his life.\n\nWe are indebted to numerous individuals who have helped bring this project about. Foremost is Owen A. Barfield, grandson and executor of the Barfield Literary Estate, whose encouragement, friendship, and wealth of understanding made this work possible. Gabriel Schenk has provided invaluable assistance over the years in support of the literary estate, including for these texts. Martin Ovens organized the conference on Owen Barfield in Contemporary Contexts in March of 2016 at Wolfson College, Oxford. We are grateful to David Blakesley of Clemson University who readily saw the value in these literary gems and offered Parlor Press as a forum for publication. Over the years members of the Owen Barfield Society (OBS) have contributed much to the development of Barfield research and publication, most notably Jane and Terry Hipolito, also Peter Fields, Julie Nichols, and other outstanding scholars—special thanks to John Ulreich who presented on Barfield’s Orpheus at the OBS session of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association conference in Santa Fe in 2015 and distributed copies of his 1983 edition of the play. Other scholars who have laid the foundations for this work include Simon Blaxland-de Lange, Verlyn Flieger, Walter Hooper, Jeanne Clayton Hunter, Thomas Kranidas, David Lavery, Donna Potts, G. B. Tennyson, Raymond Tripp, and others. We have had the comradeship of many friends and colleagues in this endeavor, including students in the Inklings seminar, the Epic Traditions seminar, and Mythology & Literature courses at MSU-Denver, members of the Grey Havens Society of Longmont, Colorado, and the Original Participants of Denver, Colorado. We offer additional thanks for encouragement to our parents Shirley and Robert Lammert and Velma and Harvey Taylor, and our children, Melian and Andrew Taylor. MSU-Denver provided grants partially funding trips to Oxford in 2016 and 2018.\n\nGeneral Introduction\n\nOne of the most original and influential literary figures of the twentieth century, Owen Barfield is known primarily for his many publications on the evolution of consciousness, the interpenetrated polarity of being, and the essential reframing of cultural history that results from this theory. At the center of his philosophy is a deep analysis of mythology and poetics that draws from Coleridge, Steiner, and others to reveal the noetic role of the poetic principle and its salient shifts that map the evolution of conscious experience. Like his companions in the Oxford Inklings group, Barfield wrote from a desire to change the landscape of banality and empirical compulsion that seemed to define contemporary society, and that impulse also included the production of fiction, drama, and poetry. However, though Barfield produced creative works throughout his long life, only a few of those works typical of the mythopoeic creativity of the Inklings authors saw publication, though notably his first published book, The Silver Trumpet (1925), is the first märchen , or fantasy story, published by any of them. Having lived a little past his ninety-ninth year, it is not surprising that in Barfield’s long life much worthy work would be left unpublished, but what is most surprising is that the biggest gaps in the published corpus of the Philosopher of Poetry are most of the major poems and poetic dramas he wrote according to his theories that place poetics at the core of conscious experience itself. In Barfield’s life only one major poem/drama, Orpheus , saw public performance, and this is also the only such work published in his lifetime, albeit more than three decades after the staging of the play in 1948.\n\nJohn Ulreich begins his Afterword to Orpheus, published by Lindisfarne in 1983, by recounting his visits with Barfield in 1973 when he was researching the Inklings through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Ulreich laments missing the chance of discussing Orpheus with Barfield but also comments that this is somewhat by Barfield’s choice: \"I learned nothing at all about Orpheus. And though I reproach myself for my lack of enterprise, Barfield must share the responsibility, for he scrupulously avoided mentioning any of his fictive offspring.\"¹ Thankfully, Barfield was enthusiastic with Ulreich’s project of publishing Orpheus in the early 1980s. Yet, nearly four decades later Orpheus serves as the only major precursor of this volume. Ulreich goes on to mention two more major early poems that he wishes he could find, Riders on Pegasus and The Unicorn, and other unpublished plays and novels, noting these as works only now being given the attention they deserve (117). Even then any such new attention was limited, and rarely included major poetry, no more of which saw full publication. These two poems, Riders on Pegasus and The Unicorn, are published here, along with the trilogy of anthroposophical plays collectively called Angels at Bay. These texts, written in Barfield’s middle years, are all works that have been known about but little known. The play trilogy was written in the early 1940s, and the mythopoeic narratives both around 1950. They represent three distinct modes of Barfield’s poetic and dramatic voice, though their interrelationship through theme and purpose is readily apparent. These three are flanked by two remarkable works that in contrast with the other three are little known about: The Tower, an early narrative epic, the ‘great work’ of Barfield’s youth remembered mainly in the Diaries and Letters of C. S. Lewis; and one more Greek play, Barfield’s Medea, completed later in life, indeed, seemingly his last major poetic and dramatic work.\n\nThe five major works presented here fall into three distinct periods of Barfield’s creative life. The first, The Tower, is an introspective narrative poem; it was begun as early as 1922 but did not take its final form until 1927. The early sections of the poem reveal the influence of earlier poets, and Lewis compares it to Browning’s Sordello and Wordsworth’s Prelude. The later sections of the poem reveal the extensive changes in Barfield’s life and are highly informed by his thought processes related to his studies into the evolution of consciousness and anthroposophy. The correspondence between Barfield and Lewis in the late 1920s reveals that he was preparing The Tower for publication, but there is no evidence that he pursued this possibility. One is left pondering why The Tower and these other major works have eluded publication until this time. The well-known story of Barfield’s life gives the general outline of his often side-lined pursuits of literary production, but the details of these great works reveal a deep desire throughout his life to create active, powerful mythopoesis, though many years often intervened between distinct bursts of poetic/dramatic activity, and hopes for wide reception of his work never saw fruition.\n\nWhatever poetical pursuits filled the years after laying aside The Tower in the late 1920s, by the late 1930s Barfield had produced another long poetic work, Orpheus, spurred by a deep desire to write a play in verse and a casual conversation about the impulse with Lewis in which his friend suggested that he take a traditional myth, such as Orpheus, and give it a try.² If Barfield is accurate in his 1982 Foreword in claiming a forty-five-year gap between writing the play and writing about it, Orpheus was completed in 1937. The following years were historically challenging as the world descended into war, and Barfield in his program note for the 1948 production mentions the motif of an increasingly totalitarian and mechanized civilization and the faint signs of coming disaster.³ These years were trying on a more personal level, too. Barfield’s father died in 1938; his mother in 1940. Perhaps these troubles, general and personal, were a stimulus in the early 1940s to writing Angels at Bay, a trilogy of anthroposophical mystery plays that explore the threshold between the living and the dead more directly than the mythic treatment of the theme in Orpheus.⁴ The twentieth century by its midpoint had seen incredible violence and social dissolution, and like most of his colleagues and friends, Barfield had been in the midst of much of it.\n\nIn any event, as the world came out of war and into reconstruction, plans were made for a stage production of Orpheus, and in September of 1948 it was produced at the Little Theatre in Sheffield by Maud Barfield and Arnold Freeman.⁵ This performance and attention for his mythopoeic play was perhaps stimulus to another productive period, for within the next two years Barfield had completed the two mythopoeic works in the middle of this volume, the light-hearted poem The Unicorn, and the more dynamic Riders on Pegasus, in which Barfield performs a mythopoeic synthesis and transference very similar to his work in Orpheus. Ulreich’s description of this mythopoeic process in his Afterword tells us much about Barfield’s poetic philosophy and production, and Ulreich’s analysis fully demonstrates that Orpheus resonates strongly with Barfield’s whole corpus both theoretical and creative. More pointedly, the mythopoeic processes Ulreich sees in the play are a direct model for the processes and qualities of Pegasus.\n\nUlreich’s great desire to publish Orpheus stemmed in part from his understanding that Barfield’s philosophy of the evolution of consciousness unfolds poetically and dramatically in the mythopoeic experience of the work. \"In spite of its being relatively early, Orpheus expresses the ideas even of Barfield’s most recent work. Because it is a drama, not an argument, Orpheus is of course much more than a statement of ideas; it is, rather, their full imaginative realization (131). That is, Barfield employs his understanding of the evolution of consciousness and the role of myth and poetry in that evolution to create a work that does not just explain or even illustrate his theory but performs the maker’s work, wielding the mythopoeic forge to shape our experience toward the paths of final participation. [Orpheus] has to do with the nature of participation itself, not so much because it is about participation as because it is a symbol to be participated in\" (131). It follows that the interpretation of Orpheus lies not primarily in ideas represented but rather in \"the way in which it actualizes ideas, bringing them into the mythopoeic experience, and in the resulting texture of theatricality, the interpenetration of idea and image, sound and sense (135). Ulreich affirms that the relationship between Barfield’s theories and his poetic productions must be found where the link between theory and art is most intimate, in the imaginative realm where we participate in the process of thinking itself rather than merely contemplate the products of thought (135). There is an easy resonance between theory and poetic production if one understands the relationship between the two narrative modes. What Barfield says in Poetic Diction about the nature of mythic consciousness gives only a hint of what is here, in effect, a fully evolved theory of myth—presented, however, not as a set of propositions about mythology, but as the embodiment of mythic consciousness in dramatic form\" (136).\n\nNoting that even Barfield’s philosophical writings often speak in metaphors, Ulreich unfolds Barfield’s own interpretive method, both as it is presented in many published essays, talks, and treatises and in how the experience is created in his poetic and dramatic work. \"[A]lthough it contains within itself the principle of its own explanation, the metaphor does not ‘explain’; it is the meaning to be apprehended by the active imagination. That meaning cannot be inculcated; it will never disclose itself to a passive understanding. The reader must actually participate in making the author’s meaning . . . (135). Ulreich muses that whether one is introduced to Barfield’s thought through this mythopoesis or comes to the play well-versed in his philosophy, the author’s meaning will inevitably be found in his perennial theme: At one point I asked the author whether it would be appropriate to describe Orpheus as a myth of the evolution of consciousness. I was properly answered: ‘Can you imagine me producing a myth of anything else?’\" (135).\n\nOf course, this rich unity of message throughout his life and work is a familiar trait which Barfield himself often discloses. We must imagine that his other mythopoeic poems and dramas share in the same perennial theme and partake in a similar postmodern mythopoeic transference as in Orpheus. \"By analyzing in order to re-unify, the play transforms the corpus of Greek myth into a new organism; Orpheus makes actual the interrelations between various myths which had been hitherto only potential\" (136). Ulreich argues that the intermingling of the stories of Heracles, Aristaeus, Orpheus, Eurydice, the Hesperides, Nereus and others is done authentically and powerfully, synthesizing and filling in tradition according to the patterns on which the Classical world itself built but also bringing the relationships and symbols into sharp relief, revealing the constructions of consciousness rather than merely expressing them or suppressing our participation in them. Riders on Pegasus in particular overtly follows this same pattern and methodology, intermingling stories that already overlap and create unexpressed implications in the Classical mythology, releasing mythopoeic potential for the purpose of creating another embodiment of mythic consciousness in poetic and dramatic form. The resulting poetry is rich and well-crafted, dynamic and lyrical, and the experience of these texts, as Ulreich suggests, paints within that felt change of consciousness at the heart of all Barfield’s theoretical work.\n\nYet, despite the enthusiastic admiration of Barfield’s poetry by the few readers with access to it, his major narrative and dramatic works remained relatively obscure in his lifetime. The 1948 production of Orpheus, despite Lewis’s enthusiasm, did not jump-start a literary career for Barfield. Lewis wrote at the time, \"I await with great interest the public reaction to a work that has influenced me so deeply as Barfield’s Orpheus,⁶ yet the public reaction was minimal, and the grand event quickly became a memory for the few. Written around this same time or soon after, the rhetorical stance of the essay Poetic Licence\" confirms that Barfield clearly understood that he was writing against the poetics of the age; indeed, the essay is both an attack on the bleak landscape of contemporary literature and an apologia for his dynamic mythopoeic works. Neither the essay nor the poetry it defends were published. One might also note the publication in 1950 of the first Burgeon novel, This Ever Diverse Pair, a book written out of desperation in response to great life pressures, about which he told Shirley Sugerman, I’ve always thought, looking back, that I avoided a nervous breakdown largely by writing that little book. . . .⁷ It is not hard to see in these grand poetic works the soul of Burgeon writing against his life’s Burden—yet unable to bring these creations to light.\n\nIn the 1965 \"Introduction to Light on C. S. Lewis,\" Barfield tells the story of the origin of Pegasus and its production somewhere about 1950 (when I was still concerned to write verse).⁸ His parenthetical note would seem a sardonic admission that his poetic work and theory continued to reside well outside the popular milieu. Barfield wrote smaller poems throughout his life, but it would seem that in 1965 he had not turned to serious poetic production for many years. Yet his developing relationship at this time with the well-known American poet Howard Nemerov would prove one avenue in which his theory of poetics directly impacted the inner-circle of published poetry and offered him external evidence that his theories about poetry were important and meaningful. In Nemerov and Objective Realism Donna Potts carefully demonstrates Barfield’s direct and transformative influence on Nemerov’s poetry and other writings. In turn, Barfield greatly admired Nemerov’s work and felt a kindred spirit with this Poet Laureate who would play a major role in Barfield’s several sojourns in US academia. In December 1967, Barfield wrote to Nemerov to describe the impact that ‘The Blue Swallows’ had had on his philosophy and referred to Nemerov as his ‘ambassador at the court of contemporary poetry, with which my relations are somewhat strained.’⁹ The humor of the diplomatic conceit nonetheless underscores the claim to poetical power unrecognized by the literary elites. There are hints of cynicism that at times arise when Barfield notes the marginalization of his poetic endeavors but never a retreat from theory and practice, never a loss of faith in what he knew about poetics and the power of his mythopoeic work.\n\nIn the late 1970s, three decades after its original composition as a Preface for Pegasus, Barfield’s revival and expansion of Poetic Licence for one or more talks in North America finds Barfield defending his poetic theories as emphatically as ever. The argument is sharpened somewhat and then expanded but fundamentally makes the same case, though the tone of the later material is perhaps more strident. This work coincides with his interactions with John Ulreich that would lead in time to the publication of Orpheus and a new opportunity to write about its poetic principles and power in a new Foreword. Barfield also must have been working on Medea around this time, at last turning to another mythopoeic drama. Yet once again the chance to bring attention to his mythopoeic work mostly fizzled. The published Orpheus made little impact beyond his typical audience and did not lead to much increased interest in his work as Ulreich and Barfield had intended and hoped. Simon Blaxland-de Lange notes this disappointment in a letter Barfield wrote to Thomas Kranidas in January of 1984: \"I am sorry Orpheus looks like turning out what Lewis once called one of his books—a flop d’estime,\" noting that it will be reviewed only by the usual anthroposophical publications and expressing disappointment that there was nothing about it in the new issue of Towards, but these, he says, are chicken feed of course in the publicity stakes, and he then expresses guilt that others have put so much effort into another failed attempt to bring his mythopoeic work to the world. \"Whether based on experience or on self-conceit, and you can take your choice, I have become accustomed to meet absence of réclame with the reflection: ‘Oh well, it will find its readers in ten or twenty or thirty years or so’\" (140-41). We must assume that this was not just a salve for disappointment but a real hope he shared with a few others, such as Nemerov, Ulreich, and Kranidas, that the day would come when the world would be ready for these powerful pieces of mythopoeic poetry and drama. Through the long efforts of Kranidas, Jeanne Clayton Hunter, and others, A Barfield Sampler was published in 1993, in Owen Barfield’s ninety-fifth year, which contains a good amount of smaller poems, some fiction, and notably a selection from Act 2 of Orpheus and the last eight stanzas (sixty-four lines) of Riders on Pegasus, the only previously published material from the poem. In the Introduction, written by Hunter and Kranidas, Barfield’s life and work are outlined with emphasis on the strange irony that his poetic canon remains unexplored to an extent unusual for a man of his literary influence.¹⁰ Hunter and Kranidas note Barfield’s vigorous defenses in poetic form of the English language and its capacities and of a romantic poetic defiantly hurled in the face of a self-paralyzed literary age. They do point out that the Philosopher of Poetry was not wholly removed from the literary establishment, noting the enthusiasm that major figures such as Auden, Bellow, Eliot, and Nemerov have expressed for his thought, and yet the enigma remains: \"here is a heralded man of letters, part of whose oeuvre is ignored, if not actually quarantined\" (12-13)."
