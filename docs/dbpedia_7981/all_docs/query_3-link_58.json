        "text": "‘Of course I am not a Freudian,\" Saul Bellow wrote to Philip Roth in 1974. “For one fierce interval I was a Reichian. At the moment I have no handle of any sort. I can neither be picked up nor put down.\" But it wasn’t true. While at work on Humboldt’s Gift (1975), Bellow had developed an interest in the work of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. And although he insisted, in a letter to the English barrister and “historian of consciousness\" Owen Barfield, that he could not call himself a Steinerian, he was using – and refusing – the handle as a measure of knowledge rather than appetite. In 1973, he started attending meetings of the Anthroposophical Society of Chicago; two decades on, he wrote that he had read Steiner’s books “by the score\". Asked by an interviewer to account for the appeal of this work, he said: “When Steiner tells me I have a soul and a spirit, I say, yes, I always knew that.\"\n\nSo while Bellow, who was happy to identify himself as “American, Jew, novelist, modern­ist\", did not deem himself fit to be called a Steinerian, he had, in another sense, always been one. Some of the most fascinating letters in this book are addressed to Barfield, for whose work Bellow expressed great admiration but from whom he received little in return. * This was a rare case. Though he showed a tendency towards paranoia (in 1948, “I am a born slightee\"; in 1980, “a favourable letter from me is a kiss of death\"), most of his correspondence was conducted on the understanding that he was the senior – and busier – figure. And while Barfield evidently enjoyed Bellow’s company and encouraged his interest in Steiner, he was unable to finish the Steiner-heavy Humboldt’s Gift . Almost desperate, Bellow wrote in 1979, “I can’t easily accept your dismissal of so much investment of soul\". In defence of “ ‘novelistic’ expression\", he quoted Steiner: “If a man has no ordinary sense of realities, no interest in the details of others’ lives, if he is so ‘superior’ that he sails through life without troubling about its details, he shows he is not a genuine seer.\"\n\nLoading..."
