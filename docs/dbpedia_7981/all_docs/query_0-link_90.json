        "text": "This season’s literary nonfiction looks at what it means to devote your life to the written word.\n\nThe state of reading and writing in today’s digitally driven world has been preoccupying authors of late. Melissa Pritchard, for instance, who last year published the novel Palmerino, explores the question “Why write?” in A Solemn Pleasure, a collection of essays that range in subject from the war in Afghanistan to Walt Whitman. Another novelist, Tim Parks, asks similar questions in Where I’m Reading From: The Changing World of Books; it seems appropriate that his essays within their lives as blog posts for the New York Review of Books. Meanwhile, veteran New Yorker copy editor Mary Norris offers, in Between You & Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen, a lively guide to dealing with common linguistic pitfalls.\n\nThough writing sometimes requires solitude, camaraderie has a part to play, too. For proof, see The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings; J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams, from Philip and Carol Zaleski, a portrait of a talent-incubating Oxford literary clique. Elsewhere, two books use letters to illustrate personal and professional bonds between writers. Meanwhile There Are Letters: The Correspondence of Eudora Welty and Ross Macdonald, edited by Suzanne Marrs and Tom Nolan, documents a 13-year epistolary friendship. I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career: The Selected Correspondence of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg, 1955–1997, edited by Bill Morgan, captures the Howl author in conversation with his publisher and fellow poet, Ferlinghetti.\n\nA pair of biographies show how two canonical American authors began their writing lives. Zachary Leader’s The Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune, 1915–1964 tracks the novelist from birth up to the publication of Herzog. Taking on a very different writer—yet one also archetypally American in his capacity for reinvention—biographer Robert Crawford, in Young Eliot: A Biography, follows T.S. Eliot from his childhood in St. Louis to The Waste Land.\n\nSpeaking of canons, a critic who has devoted much of his career to them, Harold Bloom, returns with The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime. Meanwhile, James Wood, in The Nearest Thing to Life, offers the incisive literary analysis he’s famous for, but also personal details revealing that, like all of us, he’s just a reader, in the midst of a lifelong relationship with books.\n\nPw’s Top 10: Literary Biographies, Essays & Criticism\n\nBetween You & Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen.
