But the country is facing major challenges, including dwindling student numbers, stark gender imbalances and cultural factors that undermine its ability to foster a more diverse research ecosystem. As it doubles down on international collaborations in strategic areas, South Korea is now looking to reaffirm its place as a global leader in science."
