        "text": "On Monday, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary affirmed the federal government's dedication to advancing #Pakistan's semiconductor industry, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Quantum Technologies. Speaking at the inauguration of the #International Nathiagali Summer College on #Physics and Contemporary Needs, Minister Iqbal outlined the #government's initiatives aimed at fostering quantum technology development, including the establishment of a National Centre for Quantum Computing within the year. Minister Iqbal emphasized the importance of nurturing talent in quantum #science and technology, highlighting the introduction of #scholarships and #training programs designed to equip individuals with the necessary skills in these cutting-edge fields. This strategic move aims to position Pakistan as a key player in the global tech landscape. Additionally, the Minister lauded the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission for its significant contributions to various sectors, such as healthcare, agriculture, and energy. These efforts underscore the vital role of #technological advancements in driving national progress and improving the quality of life for citizens. Minister Iqbal also stressed the necessity of consistent policies to build a robust economy. He called for a collective sense of mission to guide Pakistan towards sustained development and prosperity. Through these comprehensive measures, the government seeks to pave the way for a technologically advanced and economically stable future for Pakistan. #DigitalPakistan #TechUpdate\n\nAn International Training Course on Nuclear Emergency Management System was held in PIEAS from May 6-8, 2024. Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling and Experimentation Group (ADMEG) was the main contributor in the organization of this training course. This course was designed to equip participants with a profound understanding of nuclear emergencies, intricate details of advanced power reactors, and the essential skills required for effective response and communication during emergency scenarios. The course received wide appreciation from all sections of services and was attended by more than 100 participants from various public sector organizations such as PAEC, NESCOM Foundation University, Punjab Police, Pakistan Meteorological Department, PNRA, University of Peshawar, Emergency Services Department (Rawalpindi, DG Khan and Mianwali). Dr Manchun Liang from Tsinghua University, China travelled all the way to join this course as a resource person.\n\nThe project aims at exploring Physics in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (2DTMDCs) and use it for quantum technology. It has been demonstrated that solid-state quantum emitters based on 2D TMDCs such as WSe2 emit single photons. The emission properties of these sources can be controlled by external electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, photoluminescence studies of 2D TMDCs under different electric and magnetic fields will be carried out for single photon emission. The development of reliable single photons emitters is crucial for applications in quantum cryptography, as well as for fundamental quantum optics experiments. #quantum #funding #PSF #NNSFC #collabration #innovation #research\n\nMr. mansoor Ahmed, Emeritus, NASA Goddard Space Flight center was the speaker in PIEAS colloquium held on May 02, 2024. The title of his talk was \"Return to the moon and onwards to Mars! NASA’s Artemis Program\". In his talk he shed light on NASA’s Artemis Program, the latest endeavor in human exploration to develop the technical, physiological, and psychological capabilities to eventually inhabit MARS. He explained the overall architecture/infrastructure for enabling sustained human presence on the moon and Mars, and the associated technical challenges to be resolved. He also provided an overview of the opportunities for conducting science (including cosmology) from the surface of the moon. A large number of participants attended the colloquium. Mansoor, recently retired from NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center was serving as the Associate Director of the Astrophysics Projects Division as well as the Program Manager for the Physics of the Cosmos program and the Cosmic Origins program at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. His work across various projects and initiatives has significantly contributed to the mission of the Goddard Flight Center and has helped to further our understanding of the universe and our place within it\n\nWelcome to a world of quantum possibilities!
