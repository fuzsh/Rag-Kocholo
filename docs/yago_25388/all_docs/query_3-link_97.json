        "text": "The Atomic Energy Centre at Dacca, East Pakistan, with assistance provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1965, and subsequently under the UN Development Programme (UNDP), has carried out research in nuclear physics, using its 3-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator. Up to now research has been carried out in the elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons, total neutron cross-section measurements, (n,a) reactions and (p,Y) resonance reactions. The Centre now wishes to study (n,Y) reactions and to measure fission cross-sections. An expert is being assigned in 1968 under UNDP to assist in these new studies. The Centre's request for more sophisticated equipment from IAEA in order to keep up the pace of Pakistan's expanding neutron physics programme, has received preliminary approval.\n\nMr. A. K. M. Habibullah, Section Chief of Soil Chemistry at the Dacca Atomic Energy Centre, is seen here checking radioactive phosphorous in soil solution by means of a Geiger-Muller counter.\n\nThe United Nations allows reproduction of photo print for non-commercial, personnal or research use only. the source will be mentioned as follows \"UNOG Library\".\n\nAny other use of the reproductions, including but not limited to commercial or scholarly reproductions, redistribution, publication or transmission, wether by electronic means or otherwise, without prior written permission and authorization from the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) is strictly prohibited\n\nCredit: UN photo 102658"
