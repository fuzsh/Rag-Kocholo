        "text": "Aloysius Ee\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nSubmitted as coursework for PH240, Stanford University, Fall 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\nFig. 1: 2022 Electricity generation by fuel source. (Image source: A. Ee) [9]\n\nNuclear energy offers a cleaner and long-term solution to Pakistan's energy problems. Water is turned into steam by the heat released from a nuclear reaction (fission, fusion or nuclear decay) and this rotates a turbine to generate electricity. It is a low-carbon technology and helps reduce emission of greenhouse gases. [1] While massive upfront costs are required for building a nuclear plant just like hydroelectric energy, in 1986, Pakistan received support from China for the construction of nuclear power plants under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines. This was in an era where limited technology, supplies and support was provided to Pakistan for its nuclear program for fear of proliferation as it refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). [2]\n\nNuclear Energy and Nuclear Power Plants\n\nAt the time of writing, Pakistan generates about 3262 MWe net (3530 MWe gross) capacity of nuclear energy across its six operating nuclear power plants located at the Chashma and Karachi Nuclear Power Complexes. A breakdown of the total capacity is provided in Table 1. [3]\n\nDetails of each plant are provided below:\n\nChashma Nuclear Power Complex: CHASNUPP-I and CHASNUPP-II\n\nIn 1991, China signed an agreement to provide its 300 MWe net (CNP-300) Qinshan-1 nuclear plant to Pakistan and that the nuclear plant be installed at Chashma, a city of Punjab. CHASNUPP-I, a 300 MWe net two-looped pressurized water reactor (PWR) under IAEA safeguards was connected to the grid on May 2000. A second 300 MWe net PWR unit, CHASNUPP-II started construction in 2005 on the same Nuclear Power Complex. This unit cost about USD 490 million and 20 million was funded by China. China loaned Pakistan about 65% of the total cost. IAEA safeguards were added to the plant, and it was connected to the grid on March 14, 2011. It was the first nuclear reactor to be commissioned after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown on March 11, 2011. [4]\n\nChashma Nuclear Power Complex: CHASNUPP-III and CHASNUPP-IV\n\nIn 2008, the Pakistani government announced plans to construct two new 340 MWe gross PWR units, CHASNUPP-III and CHASNUPP-IV on the same nuclear complex. Of the total USD $1.9 billion, China agreed to loan 82% of the total amount. It would also provide fuel for the reactors lifetime. Constructions of the two units began in 2011 and CHASNUPP-III (315 MWe net) was connected to the grid in 2016 and CHASNUPP-IV (313 MWe net) in 2017. Both were also placed under IAEA safeguards. [5]\n\nKarachi Nuclear Power Complex: KANUPP-II and KANUPP-III\n\nIn 2013, plans were made to construct two 1100 MWe gross PWR units at the Karachi Nuclear Power Complex, situated at the coastal area of Karachi. This was to meet the goal of adding 8800 MWe of nuclear energy to the national grid by 2030. The total cost of the two units was USD 9.1 billion and 82% of the total amount was financed through a loan from China. The new reactors have a new design that is based on the Hualong One. Hualong One is a Generation III pressurized water reactor. It has advanced design features to improve capacity, plant safety and operation cost. It has a three-loop design and consists of a combination of active and passive systems for plant safety. [6] Construction of the first unit was performed in 2015 and the second a year later in 2016. KANUPP-II (1017 MWe net) was connected to the grid on March 2021 and KANUPP-III (1017 MWe net) on March 2022, under IAEA safeguards. China also agreed to supply fuel for the reactors' lifetime as Pakistan is not able to buy uranium from other countries.

[3]\n\nComposition of Nuclear Energy For Electricity Generation\n\nAccording to British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review of World Energy 2022, Pakistan generated about 152.1 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2021. [7] This corresponds to an average power of\n\nFig. 2: 2010 Electricity generation by fuel source. (Image source: A. Ee) [9]\n\n152.1 × 1012 Wh y-1 24 h d-1 × 365 d y-1 = 17.36 GWe\n\nSince 3262 MWe net capacity of nuclear energy is generated across its six operating nuclear power plants, the fraction of energy that is nuclear is\n\n3.262 GWe 17.36 GWe = 0.188\n\nNuclear energy now constitutes about 20% of electricity generation in Pakistan, with the rest made up by fossil fuels, hydropower and renewable energy. [8] Fig. 1 shows the breakdown of Pakistan's fuel sources. This is a steep increase from 2010, where nuclear energy constituted just 4% of electricity generation (Fig. 2). [9] Evidently, nuclear energy has been utilized by the Pakistani government to solve the country's energy problems.\n\nFuture of Nuclear Energy\n\nThe future of nuclear energy in Pakistan is promising. Very recently, Pakistan announced the construction of a 1200 MWe gross PWR unit (CHASHMA-VI), also using the Hualong One reactor at the Chashma site to meet the 8800 MWe nuclear energy goal by 2030. [10] There are also plans to construct another four more 1000 MWe nuclear power plants by 2030 in accordance with the Energy Security Plan 2005 - 2030, two at Karachi and another two at Muzaffargarh.
