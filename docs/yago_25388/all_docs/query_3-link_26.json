        "text": "Chagai Hills - Ras Koh\n\nOn May 28, 1998 Pakistan announced that it had conducted five (simultaneous) nuclear weapons tests. Seismic data indicates that this was the location of the tests.\n\n28.950°N, 64.720°E\n\nWazir Khan Khosa\n\nPakistan conducted at least one underground nuclear test on May 30, 1998, in a vertical shaft at a site in the Kharan Desert, about 100 kilometers from the site of the first test.\n\n28.720°N, 64.020°E\n\nGolra Sharif\n\nPossible uranium enrichment research and development facility/pilot plant. Like many other sites in Pakistan, it is not subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n33.669997°N, 2.948232°E\n\nIsa Khel\n\nLarge plutonium extraction plant, civil works complete, and a Chinese-supplied nuclear power reactor in early stages of construction.\n\n32.672616°N, 71.268997°E\n\nKhan Research Laboratories, Kahuta\n\nKahuta is the site of the Khan Research Laboratories [KRL], Pakistan's main nuclear weapons laboratory as well as an emerging center for long-range missile development. The primary Pakistani fissile-material production facility is located at Kahuta, employing gas centrifuge enrichment technology to produce Highly Enriched Uranium [HEU]. This facility is not under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards\n\n33.619104°N, 73.10571°E\n\nKarachi\n\nPakistan's first nuclear energy plant (heavy-water, natural uranium, 137 MWe), Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), became operational in 1972 under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. Built with Canadian assistance, KANUPP is a unique variant of the CANDU reactor.\n\n24.845183°N, 66.787241°E\n\nChasma Nuclear Plant\n\nThe Chashma Nuclear Power Plant project was initiated in the 1970s, and became operational in 2000.\n\n32.391848°N, 71.461258°E\n\nKhusab\n\nPlutonium production reactor under construction. If completed, in conjunction with the plutonium extraction plants, it could create a significant inventory of unsafeguarded weapons-usable plutonium.\n\n32.020066°N, 72.207427°E\n\nRawalpindia\n\nThe Pakistan Institute of Science and Technology is responsible for fuel cycle research and development activities; including analytical chemistry, nuclear materials, metallurgy, fuel development. The New Labs Reprocessing Plant, a not-yet-operational plutonium extraction plant is also located here.\n\n33.652494°N, 73.258038°E\n\nSources: Federation of American Scientists, Center for Non-Proliferation Studies, and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"
