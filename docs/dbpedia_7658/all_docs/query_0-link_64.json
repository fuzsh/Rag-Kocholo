Check here.\n\nFlight Cancellation Compensation Aurigny Air Services\n\nRegardless of whether you're at home or abroad when you find out about your Aurigny Air Services flight cancellation, you're going to have a lot of questions and concerns. The first thing to know is that Aurigny Air Services should find you a new flight, or offer you a full refund.\n\nBut because flight cancellations almost always play havoc with your travel plans, you should check whether you're also entitled to claim Aurigny Air Services cancelled flight compensation to help make up for the disruption.\n\nUnder UK and EU regulations, Aurigny Air Services should pay passengers up to €600 per person when they cancel flights at late notice — that is, any flight cancellation less than 14 days before it was due to depart.\n\nExceptions:\n\nAurigny Air Services will not have to pay compensation if they were able to offer a replacement flight with similar departure and arrival times to the original. You can check the exact requirements on our flight cancellation compensation page.\n\nAirlines also don't have to pay compensation if extraordinary circumstances were at play. That means that if an unusual situation occurred that was outside of the airline's control but forced a cancellation, there's no Aurigny Air Services flight cancellation compensation owed. Typical examples include bad weather or a strike by air traffic control.\n\nHow many flights were delayed today?\n\nOur latest data shows that over a 24-hour period, 0 Aurigny Air Services flights were delayed 3 hours or more.\n\nOf 0 flights, 0 were delayed over 3 hours. That rate was 0.00% for international flights.\n\nPassengers who arrive at their destination over 3 hours late could be owed compensation. Check your flight.\n\nAurigny Air Services Flight Delay Compensation\n\nWhenever you're kept waiting by Aurigny Air Services flight delays, it's worth checking whether you're entitled to compensation for your time. If Aurigny Air Services is responsible for the delay, EU regulations say that passengers are owed up to €600 per person when they're delayed by 3 hours or more.\n\nWhen you're claiming flight delay compensation, Aurigny Air Services will check what time the flight arrived at the final destination. That's because for flight delay claims it is the time that you arrived that is important, not the time of departure. AirHelp owns one of the most comprehensive databases of flight stats available, so we can always back up Aurigny Air Services flight delay compensation claims with the exact delay time.\n\nExceptions:\n\nAirlines like Aurigny Air Services do not have to pay out compensation if there's some external reason for the delay. That means delays caused by bad weather, an incident at the airport, or air traffic control strikes are not eligible for compensation. These kind of situations are called extraordinary circumstances.\n\nYou can learn more about what is and isn't included on our flight delay compensation page.\n\nEven though Aurigny Air Services is not a European airline, they always comply with European laws every time they depart from a European airport. That means passengers flying out of a European airport with United Airlines are protected by EC 261, one of the world's most comprehensive air passenger rights laws.\n\nThis gives passengers the right to claim flight delay compensation, United Airlines cancellation compensation, or overbooking compensation if United Airlines is responsible for the issue. That's in addition to their rights to a flight refund.\n\nUnfortunately, the same protections don't apply for flights going the other way. Aurigny Air Services passengers who land in the EU are not covered by EC 261 if the departure airport is outside the EU. For these flights, you'll need to check what other air passenger rights apply.\n\nWhich United Airlines Flights are Covered by EC 261?"
