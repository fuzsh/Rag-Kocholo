        "text": "Best Hikes in Chablais\n\nA spread out massif\n\nThe Massif du Chablais is the second largest massif in the northern Pre-Alps and is full of a host of mountains that are accessible to all. The massif is surrounded by the Bernese Alps to the north, the Giffre to the south-east and the Bornes to the south-west. In addition, the massif is made up of sedimentary limestone and silico-clastic rocks.\n\nA diversity of peaks\n\nLe Chablais culminates at 2466 m at the top of the Hauts-Forts on the resort of Avoriaz. The Hauts-Forts is, it must be said, a difficult hike that requires a certain amount of training and a safe foot. In the western part of the massif, it is possible to make many easy outings to the Praz-de-Lys Sommand resort, such as Pointe de Chalune. In addition, I also recommend the Bellevaux region with its peaks offering peaceful walks. I have in mind in particular Pointe d’Ireuse and Mont Forchat.\n\nAmong the most striking peaks of the Chablais region, I would certainly mention the Môle (1863 m). Its shape, clearly visible from Geneva, is somewhat reminiscent of that of Mount Fuji in Japan. In winter, the Chablais is a prime playground for skiing and snowshoeing. The resort of Les Gets and Samoëns are ideal places for a winter walk.\n\nYou will find below a selection of hiking routes that I have been able to do in the Chablais. Each hiking itinerary is carefully documented with a description, a trail and photos. Feel free to send us your comments or remarks by email or at the bottom of the corresponding articles."
