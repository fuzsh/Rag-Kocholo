        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nCornwall Airport Newquay proudly celebrated the arrival of Aurigny’s inaugural flight from Guernsey, marking the beginning of a new airline service and destination for the summer 2024 season. The first flight, which touched down yesterday, was greeted with traditional Cornish hospitality, including a complimentary cream tea provided by Trewithen Dairy, ensuring passengers experienced an authentic taste of Cornwall with the jam spread first!\n\nThe new route, operating weekly throughout the summer holidays, establishes a direct link between Guernsey and Cornwall, offering passengers a convenient and scenic escape. This service not only strengthens connections between the Channel Islands and Cornwall but also bolsters local tourism and provides an exciting new travel option for both residents and visitors.\n\nPassengers on the inaugural flight received a warm welcome and enjoyed a delightful cream tea, showcasing the best of Cornish traditions. The collaboration with Trewithen Dairy ensured that the first passengers savored Cornwall’s finest cream and jam, providing a perfect introduction to the region’s rich culinary heritage.\n\nCornwall Airport Newquay’s Head of Commercial, Amy Smith, commented: “We are thrilled to welcome Aurigny and their passengers to Cornwall Airport Newquay. This new route is a fantastic addition to our summer schedule and enhances our connectivity. It further highlights the growing appeal of Cornwall as a top travel destination and offers a good link to the Channel Islands. We look forward to a successful partnership.”\n\nSudeep Ghai, Chief Commercial Officer of Aurigny added, “We’re delighted to add Newquay to our network this summer, giving the people of Guernsey the opportunity to experience the remarkable beauty of the Cornish coast. Why not make a trip to St Ives, Truro, Mousehole or Lands End. And surf enthusiasts, head out for the waves and the festivals. And likewise, we hope to bring the people of Cornwall to Guernsey to experience the warmth of our three islands, not just the hospitality of Guernsey but the opportunity to travel onward from here to Alderney and Sark.”\n\nAurigny operates an ATR 72-600 aircraft on its new route to Newquay. Known for its fuel efficiency and low CO2 emissions, the ATR 72-600 is ideal for regional flights with its cruising speed of up to 270 knots and a range of approximately 825 miles.\n\nWith Cornwall Airport Newquay expanding its offerings, Aurigny’s weekly flights present a new and exciting travel option for the 2024 summer season. Passengers are encouraged to book early to secure their seats and enjoy the charm and beauty of both Guernsey and Cornwall.\n\nSWISS Aircraft Urgent Emergency Landing in Astana Following Onboard Medical Incident\n\nAirAsia Expands Australian Reach With New Bali-Cairns Service, Boosting Tourism\n\nSummer Vacation Nightmare: Majorca Airport Chaos Continues\n\nBirmingham Airport Sees 19.6% Passenger Growth in 2023 Amid Surging Travel Sector, Eyes Expansion into North America and Asia"
