        "text": "From Gatwick Airport in 2016 to over 240 airports in over 30 countries, and 17 airlines worldwide\n\nIt’s a misconception that people living with a disability don’t want to, or can't travel. They do and they can. Globally one billion people live with some sort of disability and while some experience a disability that is visible, for many it is not visible.\n\n\"Everyone has the right to travel, and everyone has the right to choose to travel and to where they want to go. And in order to experience the beauty of the world we live in and have everyone experience that, we have to make sure that our travel is for all.\"\n\nDania Mikdad Aladhami, Civil Engineer with Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination\n\nOur aim is a world where people with hidden disabilities are confident to travel independently knowing that they will receive the support that they may need at every stage of their journey. From the terminal to boarding the flight, on the flight and arriving at their destination!\n\nWhich airports and airlines have joined the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower network?\n\nThe following airlines have joined the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower network and have trained their entire workforce to support individuals with non-visible disabilities. Click on the airline name to find out how each airline supports Hidden Disabilities Sunflower users."
