        "text": "Gatwick South Terminal\n\nGatwick Airport has seen a series of major facility upgrades within the last 10 years, with £1.2 billion invested between 2008 and 2014.\n\nMost notably, the South terminal hugely benefitted from a brand new security area that features 19 lanes and a dedicated entrance for passengers with special assistance requirements, as well as families/individuals travelling with small children. A brand new premium lane was introduced for the 1st class and business class passengers.\n\nThe South Terminal at Gatwick offers a wide variety of services to make the flying experience smooth and stress-free, as much as it’s possible.\n\nThe following links will take you to the full list of facilities available at Gatwick’s South Terminal:\n\nNot sure which terminal, South or North? Find out on our Departures page.\n\nCheck-In at Gatwick South Terminal\n\nCheck-in desks are located on level 2 at Gatwick’s South Terminal. Passengers are advised to arrive well in time for their flight to ensure they have plenty of time to go through security. Make sure you check-in with plenty of time prior to your flight.\n\nSelf-Service Check-In at Gatwick South Terminal\n\nSome airlines offer self-service check-in; it’s a really simple process and will take minutes to complete. Passengers save time and are able to check-in at the airline’s kiosk, choose their seats and print boarding cards. Alternatively, self check-in can also be done online, in advance, before you even head off to the airport. Passengers then have to drop their luggage at the drop off points.\n\nRemember: Please note that there are no flight calls at London Gatwick airport, so all passengers need to check the flight information screens situated across all levels at South Terminal. The screens will list flight destination, time, flight number, status, gate number and whether it’s affected by delays/cancellations. Boarding usually begins around 45 minutes before departure.\n\nArrivals is located to the left of the terminal. You can check arrival times online.\n\nConnecting to Another Flight\n\nIf you arrive at Gatwick to connect to another flight, what you do next depends on whether your baggage is checked through already. If it is and you already have a boarding card for the next flight, you simply follow the directions to Flight Connections. If you don’t have the boarding pass for the onward journey and your checked-in bags are not checked through to your final destination, then you will have to collect it at Gatwick, pass through border control and proceed to get checked-in for your upcoming flight.\n\nGatwick Airport has also started offering an innovative solution to passengers connecting onto flights with Norwegian Airlines or Virgin Atlantic, called Gatwick Connect. The service is free and allows passengers to collect their bags and leave them with the staff at Gatwick Connect counter, and then proceed straight to security without having to take the bags along.\n\nInternational connections do not require going through Immigrations or Customs but all International to Domestic connections do. Domestic to International connecting passengers can use special Immigration checkpoints if baggage is through-checked.\n\nAirlines at Gatwick South Terminal\n\nThe South Terminal handles the bulk of Gatwick Airport’s traffic serving domestic, international and charter flights."
