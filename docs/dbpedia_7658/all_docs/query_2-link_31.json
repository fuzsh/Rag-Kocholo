        "text": "You have been warned!!!\n\nHad to give 1* to proceed. Should be 0*.\n\nFlight cancelled after being kept at airport for over 8 hours when they knew at least 12 hours beforehand that it was never going to take off!!\n\nLeft for almost 2 more hours in departure lounge trying to find out what happens next before passengers were taken to a dreadful hotel for overnight stay.\n\nTotally inept and uncaring yet pride themselves on providing a first class passenger experience. They are destroying tourism to Guernsey and that’s not from me but from taxi drivers, hotel staff, restaurant staff, and many others involved in tourism on Guernsey.\n\nNever again!!\n\nUse this lot at your peril.\n\nDate of experience : July 23, 2024\n\nTerrible airline, zero customer service- avoid\n\nTerrible airline, zero customer service i will never use again. our flight was delayed for hours then cancelled, no rep at the airport, no one able to help us. Airport offered us a hotel for the night, but no contact from Aurigny, still chasing a refund for our plane tickets 2 weeks later, told to wait 28 days before contacting again while they look at our case, £300+ down for tiekts plus £600 for a non refundable hotel. Airline couldnt care less, take your money for a flight that didnt leave then chasing them for a refund, absolute joke.\n\nDate of experience : July 12, 2024\n\nWhat happens when inbred half-wits try to run an airline\n\nThe Aurigny website must surely have been designed by either a 5 year-old child, or someone with serious function difficulties.\n\nThey seem to think that \"Flights\" and \"Points\" mean the same thing in the English language, just as one TINY example. Pride, I suppose, compelled them to pick from the island's \"talent\" pool when choosing a web designer....rather than hiring an adult with a 3-digit IQ from somewhere else.\n\nPerhaps if an actual functional adult takes over the failing Aurigny airline they'll hire a competent programmer from the UK.\n\nDate of experience : July 04, 2024\n\nWorst airline I've ever used\n\nWorst airline I've ever used, flew to Guernsey Thursday, they had changed to plane to the oldest plane,it had ashtrays in the arm rest and was a 34 seater plane!! What they failed to tell us is they could fit anyone's booked in hold luggage on the plane. What the did do is offer anyone's small cases that couldn't go into the cabin to go in the hold for free!!! Yep it makes no sense does it. There were people on that flight travelling to weddings and one wedding had bridesmaid dresses in their cases!! What was even worse is when we were told our luggage had been left behind there was no apology, no compassion and no sense of responsibility, they just said nothing to do with us we just work here !!! When my husband asked when would we get our luggage he was told if he was going to be an abusive passenger he would be made to leave by security, even though he had asked politely!!! The people of Guernsey deserve better and so do the visitors to the island. We had to go out and spend our first day shopping for items for the next dayas we had an early start and were told the luggage may be with us by about 1pm the next day.\n\nDate of experience : July 11, 2024\n\nMoney grabbers, terrible service\n\nFor the past year or so my flights (2 returns a month) have been massively delayed or cancelled completely. Today my flight was delayed (what a surprise) but it meant I'd miss my connecting flight in the UK - when I called, the customer service consultant I spoke to had no idea it was delayed - good start! They then insisted they charge £75 for the change to an earlier flight, even though it's their issue.\n\nThey are full of empty promises about attempting to fix their problems - I've been patient with them but very tired of it now.\n\nDate of experience : June 28, 2024\n\nTerrible customer service.\n\nI booked return flights from Southampton to Alderney, out on 13th June, return on the 17th. Two forty five minute flights was £337. Bad weather meant that after 7 hours in Southampton airport, the flight was cancelled. Since then, nothing, no apology, no email, no offer of money back, nothing.\n\nI completed a claim form which said they would get back to me in 28 days. How is this company still in business? This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I would row a boat to Alderney rather than fly with these jokers.\n\nDate of experience : June 13, 2024\n\nMore woes to add to Aurigny problems\n\nThursday 27th June can only add to previous comments diabolical service from a once excellent airline. Flight GCI to EMA GR696 due to depart at 12.55 repeated delays due to, we were informed \" technical issues \" Eventually plane found from Southampton a Saab with lower capacity so 27 passengers were delayed until the following morning. We were fortunate my wife being disabled with assistance did get the flight. Arrived EMA some 4.5 hours late. States of Guernsey should be concerned about this on going situation we for one will NOT be returning to the lovely isle of Guernsey again, it is from the Midlands our only viable way to travel. It must eventually have an impact on holidays, why have Aurigny only got 5 aircraft and rely on leasing other disparate companies to provide a service. This is simply not good enough but I do not imagine that anybody will take the slightest notice of our and others experieces!!!!\n\nDate of experience : June 27, 2024\n\nGreat airlines\n\nGreat airlines.\n\nI flew Aurigny three times in June: LGW->GCI, GCI->ACI and ACI->GCI. The first flight (4-year old ATR72) landed nicely before scheduled time, the second one (6-year old Dornier 228) landed in Alderney three minutes after the scheduled DEPARTURE time and the third one (12-year old Dornier 228) landed Guernsey record breaking 15 minutes before the DEPARTURE time in Alderney (the departure time was 7:15 p.m. but the plane landed already at 7:00 p.m. after 9 minutes and 50 seconds of flying time in Guernsey).\n\nThe crew was nice and professional.\n\nDate of experience : June 21, 2024\n\nJoke of an airline\n\nIf I could give 0 stars I would! Where to begin..\n\nLate cancellations, late notification of flight delays and changes, even splitting flights into two so that half the plane load of passengers have to go 2/3 hours later than planned. Charging through the nose for changes - tried to change a flight (in a months time) to 3 days earlier and it's £99, madness. Even more shocking is charging £700+ for two people for return flights to Gatwick! It's absurd. They're having an absolute laugh and know that unfortunate Guernsey people have no other choice but to use them and take the hit. Tried calling their customer service at 5pm on a weekday only to be automatically cut-off with a recorded message saying they close at 6pm, so that's also a shambles.\n\nMiss the days where Aurigny was almost reliable and didn't charge for luggage. Hoping they go into administration so that we get a real airline! We already know that slightly larger planes can land here, so why can't we get Easyjet? They charge min £25 from Jersey to Gatwick - we are being conned.\n\nDate of experience : June 19, 2024\n\nAbsolutely charming staff at SOU and ACI\n\nAfter 2 and a half years of frequent travel between Southampton and Alderney I can't comment much on Guernsey, but Aurigny staff at both Southampton and Alderney airports have been nothing but charming, helpful and accommodating. Island weather can often disrupt flights but I've always been kept informed of delays and the reasons for them, and one time when I made a mistake with my booking it was very kindly corrected by a young gentleman in Alderney.\n\nDate of experience : July 24, 2024\n\nFirst time using this airline for a…\n\nFirst time using this airline for a business trip to Guernsey. Flight out was delayed by 2 hours and then covered by a different airline who could not provide basic food or drinks. Return flight delayed by 3 hours. When I asked why they replied “Oh we started off with delays and never caught up” .. whilst waiting in departure lounge I heard them cancelling a flight to Manchester and advising passengers where to pick up their bags. Typical service from a company with little or no competition. Guernsey was nice but I’ll never come back whilst this terrible airline is the main supplier.\n\nDate of experience : May 03, 2024\n\nBeen waiting for it but now only have 3 wks to rearrange.\n\nWell I've guessed for some time that things were going wrong at Aurigny. Luckily I get news notifications online and found one yesterday that warned me my flight was being cancelled. With just 3 weeks to go I faced losing money from my booked hotel but luckily I learnt that lesson previously and had time to cancel without cost. So I've contacted them they have confirmed my flights are cancelled (although offered me flights from other UK cities). I live 10 mins from Liverpool airport I'm not prepared to travel for hours to get to another). I have luckily cancelled my hotel without cost. I won't be booking again. I would have liked to visit Guernsey but won't be trying again. I do feel sorry for hotels cancelling this close it must effect business badly hope they will get compensation for it.\n\nI can travel to Jersey as we did last year chaos free so we will go back.\n\nDate of experience : May 23, 2024"
