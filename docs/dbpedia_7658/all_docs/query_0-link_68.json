        "text": "Switzerland’s flag-carrier airline, Swiss, has taken their first delivery of the Airbus A321neo.\n\nWhat do we know about the new A321neo?\n\nThe brand-new aircraft has the registration HB-JPA and is called “Stoos”.\n\nNow you may think this is a rather odd name however, Swiss have a tradition of naming aircraft after locations in Switzerland.\n\nSwiss also operates a number of A220, A330-300, A340-300 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Seven months ago, Swiss took delivery of its first Airbus A320neo jet.\n\nThe carrier is also awaiting fifteen more A320neo and seven A321neo aircraft. These will replace the older fleet of A320ceo and A321ceo jets.\n\nSwiss International Airlines (Swiss) is Switzerland’s flag carrier and is part of the Star Alliance. Swiss has two hubs, one in Zurich and Geneva. Swiss is part of the Lufthansa group; Lufthansa is Germany’s flagship carrier.\n\nSubsidiaries of Swiss International Airlines include Edelweiss Air, Swiss World Freight and Swiss Tours to name a few."
