He has played the recorder since he was 9 and the flute since he was 20, completed a degree at the University of Montréal (Quebec) in 1978, and from 1978 to 1980 studied the recorder with Michael Barker and Ricardo Kanji, and traverso with Bart Küyken at The Hague Conservatory (Netherlands).\n\nIn order to pursue his studies of the music of Hotteterre and composers of his time, Jean-François made a reconstruction of an alto recorder by Dupuis. This led to further reproductions after originals by Wijne Stanesby Jnr, Bressan, Bizey and Ganassi. During his time in Holland, Jean-François met and studied with the Australian recorder maker Fred Morgan and continued his work with him in Daylesford, Victoria during 1986. More recent collaborations have been with Olivier Cottet and Marc Ecochard, and Philippe Bolton in the south of France.

The mellow tone makes them especially suitable for group playing.\n\nThe Interval and Pentatonic Flutes were created to fill the need for high quality wind instruments in pedagogical work with younger children.

He started making in Holland while studying recorder at the Royal Conservatorium in the Hague, and the Stedelijk Conservatorium in Zwolle. Frederick Morgan gave several classes in recorder making at the Royal Conservatorium while he was in Europe in 1978. One of David Coomber's greatest assets as a maker is his experience as a player and performer. He teaches the recorder to postgraduate level at Auckland University's School of Music. David's philosophy is to make the best quality recorders and that no recorder leaves the workshop unless it is up to the standards demanded of a professional instrument. David is always prepared to work alongside musicians to ensure the recorder they purchase meets their demands.\n\nIn 2014 David started a new career and decided to stop recorder making.CoolsmaNetherlandsAAFAB, Jeremiestraat 4-6, 3511 TW Utrecht+31 (0)30 2316393+31 0302 312350[email protected]https://www.aafab.nl/Trademark of AAFAb.Trademark of AAFAb.Cottet, OlivierFranceLe Bois des Prés, 28410 Boutigny Prouais+33 (0)2 37 65 13 96[email protected]https://www.maitresdart.fr/olivier-cottet-16/parcours-et-realisatioBaroque recorders, under the trademark Foret-Bruno.

He has devoted several years to measuring node points, bore pressure, etc. in an attempt to discover how 'great' instruments differ from bad-sounding instruments that are virtual copies of the same. At the same time, he has produced some instruments that are not only physically beautiful but which also play very well - if only he could duplicate these successes at will!\n\nNotes by Brian Forbes.Foret-BrunoFranceBaroque recorders.Trade-mark of Olivier Cottet.Foster, CharlesUnited Kingdom (UK)Glen Cottage, 63 Holburn Street, Aberdeen, Aberdenshire AB 6BR UK+44 01224 580024Renaissance recorders, based on Bärenreiter recorders of the '60s and early '70s.

Both feature a system of adjustable voicing achieved by altering the position of the block and the height of the windway. Both were of cylindrical bore. Later the German firm Hopf, for whom Gruber worked from 1965-1970, produced Silberton instruments which they now offer as Gruber System recorders by Kobliczek in sopranino, soprano, and alto models.

Indeed the Harmonic Tenor Recorder boasts a three octave range from b-c'''', with 4 keys and an optional piano key. The latter is operated by the index finger of the left hand and serves to raise the pitch overall thus allowing the player to create a decrescendo by diminishing breath pressure. By twisting a screw beneath the block on the headjoint, the block can be raised or lowered in order to adjust timbre and produce special sound effects. Further, the Harmonic Alto Recorder includes a sound unit with a number of replaceable wind canals which may be of different materials and shapes.\n\nThese instruments now manufactured by Conrad Mollenhauer GmbH.Hellinger, ErichGermanySchool recorders.Formerly made in GDR.Hermans, JanBelgiumHistorical Woodwinds, Werkendam 12, 236O Oud-Turnhout+32 14 41 65 40+32 14 41 65 40[email protected]http://www.historicalwoodwinds.be/Baroque recorders after Rottenburgh, Bressan, Bizey, Denner, Stanesby, Terton etc; renaissance recorders after Van Eyck, Ganassi, & consorts at 466 Hz & 44O Hz.Also makes flutes after Rottenburgh, Grenser, Hotteterre, Rippert & J.H.

Their characteristics are: balance in form, harmony in its properties, timeless beauty. There are two types of Hall-recorder: wide-bore (Mersenne) and conical bore (English Flute).

Born and raised in Germany, he emigrated to the US in 1948 and served as a flutist in the US Air Force. In 1956 he graduated from Bowdoin College (ME) and began a four year apprenticeship with the legendary flute maker Verne Q. Powell. He began producing his own recorders in 1960 and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966 for a comparative study of historical woodwinds, becoming one of the first makers to produce copies of original 18th century recorders. He designed the extraordinarily popular Rottenburgh recorders for Moeck as well as the first high-quality plastic recorders for Zen-On.\n\nAfter a successful career as a professional chef, Patrick von Huene joined the von Huene Workshop as an apprentice in 1982. For more than a quarter century now he has overseen production for the workshop and his craftsmanship and expertise are legendary.\n\nThey are also the US repair agents for Moeck, Mollenhauer, Küng, Aafab and others.

At the beginning, only simple shepherd's flutes with six fingerholes, later also double flutes, side-blown flutes, tin ornamented shepherd's flutes and longflutes were made in his workshop. Gradually, the range of material used has increased, and he has tried almost all of the species of domestic fruit trees. According to his experience, the flutes with the most beautiful sound are made of plum, almond or apricot wood. Besides the Hungarian folk instruments, Renaissance and Baroque wood wind instruments can also be found in his stock: recorders, flutes, oboes. His instruments are sought out by folk music groups and music schools from Hungary and abroad. In 1984 he won the first prize of the National Folk Music Instrument Makers' Competition. Both the workshop and the stock have been expanding since.

PiezoBarrel pickups are designed to be simple to use and provide exceptional sound quality. The PiezoBarrel R1 is designed especially for the recorder. The recorder usually only produces a weak signal in the low register and any attempt to produce a stronger note results in the sound becoming unstable as it starts to overblow. For this reason, the R1 was designed to have a non-linear frequency response that increases the bass frequencies and thus strengthens the low register. Sound from a recorder fitted with the R1 can be passed directly to a guitar or other amplifier or via a guitar effects panel such as the Boss GT-1 for live or recorded performance.Vries, Tom deNetherlandsEysingapad 30 9064 KK Aldtsjerk[email protected]https://devriesrecorders.nl/Medieval style after the Dordrecht recorder; renaissance recorders after Ganassi, Bassano; early baroque recorders; baroque recorders after Anonymous, Bassano, Bressan, Denner, Ganassi, Rippert, Stanesby Sr, Stanesby Jr, Steenbergen.Logo: two stylized water lily leaves.\n\nSee de Vries (2022).Montero, JorgeChileSantiago+56 02-223 2891 / 8-330 5621Ganassi-style, Transitional recorders, Baroque recorders after Bressan.Also makes transverse flutes and native flutes.\n\nI would appreciate further contact details.Piepenbroek, HenkNetherlandsBergkamp 7, 7384 AV Wilp+31 0571 261453Henk Piepenbroek makes square soprano recorders after a design by Alec V.
