        "text": "Emmen, Switzerland, 02 October 2018. RUAG Aviation delivered a factory new Dornier 228 to Aurigny Air Services Ltd on 7 September. Aurigny, a returning customer, accepted delivery of their second new Dornier 228. RUAG is the type certificate (TC) holder and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Dornier 228.\n\nAurigny Air Services, a regional airline operating from the Channel Island of Guernsey, took delivery of the factory new Dornier 228 at the RUAG Aviation facilities in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. “This new aircraft is set to take up regularly scheduled operations immediately, and we are pleased that our acceptance procedure could go forward smoothly,” states Mark Darby, CEO, Aurigny Air Services.\n\nDelivery of this new aircraft also notes two new features in the Dornier 228 new production model configuration: The glass cockpit avionics now include the recently certified digital autopilot and comfort in the aircraft is enhanced by newly sourced and approved cabin seating systems. At the same time, the new aircraft also displays the operator’s distinctive livery, applied by the specialists in the aircraft painting shop at the RUAG Aviation site.\n\nThis is the second new Dornier 228 for Aurigny who is tasked by the States of Guernsey and Alderney with providing reliable passenger, medevac and cargo transport on the routes between Guernsey, Alderney and Southampton. Aurigny maintains a fleet of four Dornier 228s that now include two new production models, with this latest delivery, and two classic configurations. They rely on the aircraft’s inherent best-in-class performance characteristics for reliability, overall costefficiency, fast cruising speeds, STOL capability (Short Take-Off and Landing) and stability in the face of strong crosswinds for continuous operations.\n\nThe acceptance procedure for the aircraft was brief, lasting just two days. Volker Wallrodt, Senior Vice President Business Jets, Dornier 228 & Components, RUAG Aviation, attributes this to the production team’s dedication to highest quality standards. He confirms, “Our team of technicians and engineers are heavily invested in excellence of new aircraft. This current success, especially the smooth and swift acceptance protocol, proves we are on track with customer expectations.”"
