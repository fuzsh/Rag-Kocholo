May have some damage to the cover; scuff marks mostly, but integrity still intact. No missing pages or anything that would compromise the readability, legibility or understanding of the text. May have minimal dings on the top or bottom of some pages.\n\nThere are 26 current cantons in Switzerland. This volume (volume four of the series) deals with Canton Fribourg. There are 14 volumes in this series.\n\nUnlike American genealogical research, where the place to search is usually a civil registration (city, county, and state), European research is usually related to an ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In 18th and 19th century Switzerland, one must search the parish registers for births, christenings, marriages, deaths and burials. The historic boundaries for the Swiss cantons and amtsbezirke are quite well defined, and this volume lays them out in map form. Listings are given for both Catholic and Protestant parishes, along with what records are available and where to access them. Contact information, and the municipalities covered by each parish is found, making your Swiss research much easier to accomplish.\n\nEach of the Map Guide to Swiss Parish Registers does the following:\n\nIdentiﬁes the major online resources for Swiss genealogical research.\n\nIdentiﬁes each canton with amtsbezirke (districts), and the municipalities, bauerten (farming coalitions), and subsidiary locations.\n\nVisually identiﬁes church parishes within each amtsbezirk (district).\n\nProvides an overview of Swiss genealogical records.\n\nIdentiﬁes neighboring parishes, just in case your ancestor may have gone to an alternate parish.\n\nAids in conducting area searches, particularly across district and canton borders.\n\nProvides visual identiﬁcation of search areas in which to look for your family.\n\nHelps in determining proximity of one area to another.\n\nIdentiﬁes archives, repositories, and other resources.\n\nIdentiﬁes important gazetteers and online dictionaries available to researchers.\n\nThe following alphabetical list of 904 places are those found in Canton Fribourg."
