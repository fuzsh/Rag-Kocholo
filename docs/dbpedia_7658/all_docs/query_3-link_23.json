The Château overlooks a French-style garden and a two-hectare wooded and enclosed park. A diversion channel fills a basin designed in the spirit of the Canopus of Villa Adriana in Tivoli, Italy. It is located at the entrance to the picturesque village of Autigny-la-Tour, built in a circus dug by the Vair. The region with magnificent landscapes, where Joan of Arc spent her childhood, is marked by history."
