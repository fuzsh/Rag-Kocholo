Here it is:\n\nCON1381 – Demystifying PL/SQL: The Life of a Compilation Unit\n\nFor almost 30 years, PL/SQL has evolved from a simple procedural language into an essential, advanced, and popular component of the Oracle Database. So popular, in fact, that PL/SQL is considered the defacto database procedural language, with other database vendors striving to imitate it. But, how does real PL/SQL work? How can you make the most of it? In this session, we’ll take an in-depth dive into the PL/SQL language from tokenization to parsing, preprocessing, compilation, optimization, debugging, and execution. After this session, you’ll have a solid understanding of not only what happens to your source code behind the scenes, but also why PL/SQL is such a powerful programming language.\n\nIn order to make sure the content is more widely understood, I’ll be translating complex theoretical and extremely low-level details into an intermediate-oriented session. Here’s to hoping it is accepted!"
