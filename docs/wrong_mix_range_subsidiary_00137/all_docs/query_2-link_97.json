        "text": "“We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over a billion (dollars) that haven't come online yet,” Oracle CEO Safra Catz said.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence fueled infrastructure revenue for Oracle in its most recent quarter, with the database products and services vendor’s top two executives promising more to come.\n\nLarry Ellison, Oracle co-founder and chief technology officer, told listeners on the Austin, Texas-based company’s quarterly earnings call Monday that Oracle is bringing GenAI to a wide range of industries – highlighting a digital assistant for ambulatory clinic systems and the technology’s work in aligning Albania’s laws with the European Union’s to speed up the country’s EU entrance.\n\n“Oracle's Gen 2 AI infrastructure business is booming,” Ellison said. “That’s become pretty clear to everybody.”\n\n[RELATED: AWS, Oracle, Google, Microsoft Top Cloud DBMS Market: Gartner]\n\nOracle AI Opportunity\n\nWhen asked by an analyst about a “herculean increase in new business” needed to grow Oracle’s infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue 49 percent year over year, Oracle CEO Safra Catz credited growth with existing and new customers.\n\n“There are many, many customers who have come on and that haven't gotten capacity yet,” Catz said. “We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over a billion (dollars) that haven't come online yet.”\n\nEllison also credited Oracle’s ability to build cloud data centers of various sizes, sharing that the vendor is at work on one in the U.S. “where you can park eight Boeing 747s nose to tail in that one data center.”\n\nThe executives stressed Oracle’s work meeting demands, with Microsoft already adding on three more data centers on top of 20 Oracle was already building.\n\n“We're bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months,” Ellison said. “The demand, the demand is so high. We need to do that to just satisfy our existing set of customers. … We're seeing demand for data centers of people who want to buy Alloy and then resell our cloud services with their proprietary cloud services on top of it.”\n\nEllison predicted on the call that Oracle “will end up with more data centers and cloud regions than all the other hyperscalers combined.” Oracle has 13 live dedicated and Alloy regions, 18 under construction and five new ones signed during the quarter.\n\n“Microsoft does not compete for this business,” he said. “AWS does not compete for this business. Google does not compete for this business. We're the only ones in this business.”\n\nOracle’s CapEx, Partnerships\n\nCatz said that Oracle’s fiscal year 2025 should include $10 billion in capital expenditures. “It also involves not only some big centers, but it also involves expansion of existing centers – so we've already got some areas that we'll be filling out,” she said.\n\nWhen asked if Oracle will run into graphics processing unit (GPU) constraints plaguing other technology companies, both Catz and Ellison said the vendor is good to go and that electric power and communication connections are the bigger constraint.\n\nEllison said that Oracle’s partnership with Nvidia has helped and pointed to the vendor’s ongoing collaboration with Microsoft as a way to grow use of Oracle offerings in the cloud and migrate customers to Oracle’s Autonomous Database, predicting further customer adoption of multi-cloud environments.\n\n“We've been the No. 1 database in the IT ecosystem for a very long time – we think that's going to preserve that franchise and expand it,” he said.\n\nQ3 2024 In Detail\n\nOracle reported $13.3 billion in total revenue for the quarter, up 7 percent year over year.\n\nCloud services and license support revenues were $10 billion, up 11 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange. Cloud license and on-premises license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3 percent year over year.\n\nThe vendor’s total remaining performance obligations (RPO) was a record $80 billion, up 29 percent. Oracle should recognize 43 percent of that money as revenue over the next four quarters.\n\nOperating income using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $3.8 billion. Net income was $2.4 billion.\n\nTotal cloud revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 24 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nOracle brought in $1.8 billion in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue, an increase of 49 percent year over year. Cloud application revenue was $3.3 billion, up 14 percent year over year.\n\nFusion Cloud ERP and NetSuiteCloud ERP each brought in $800 million for the quarter. That is an 18 percent increase year over year for Fusion and a 20 percent increase for NetSuite ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nOracle traded at about $130 a share after hours, up about 14 percent.\n\nFor fourth fiscal quarter guidance, Catz said she expects total revenue excluding Cerner should grow 6 to 8 percent year over year. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner should grow from 22 to 24 percent."
