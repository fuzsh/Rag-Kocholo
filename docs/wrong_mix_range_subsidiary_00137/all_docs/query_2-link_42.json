        "text": "Oracle’s commitment to open source began long ago, in 1998, when the company released the industry’s first commercial database on Linux. Today, Oracle is involved in many major open-source projects, including Linux, MySQL, OpenJDK, GraalVM, VirtualBox, and others. It is also one of the founding members of the Linux Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, Open Enterprise Linux Association, and the Java Community Process.\n\nOur open-source development takes place on GitHub, where hundreds of our projects receive more than 3000 pull requests every month from both Oracle and the wider community.\n\nIn addition to that, we actively contribute to external open-source projects. For example, Oracle is the #1 contributor for total lines of code changed across the Linux 6.1 kernel.\n\nOur open-source development takes place in several organizations, grouped around projects:\n\nOracle — our primary GitHub organization;\n\nGraalVM — a high-performance JDK with AOT compilation;\n\nHelidon —a cloud native set of Java libraries for writing microservices;\n\nJava Community Process — developing standard technical specifications for Java technology;\n\nLiveLabs — workshops to build and deploy applications using Oracle’s technologies;\n\nMySQL — the world’s most popular open source database;\n\nOpenJDK — the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects;\n\nOracle DevRel technical content: code samples, tutorials, and more;\n\nOracle GitHub Actions — GitHub Actions from Oracle;\n\nOracle Sample Projects — new projects and sample applications;\n\nOracle Terraform Modules — Terraform modules for provisioning Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources;\n\nQuick Start — automated deployments of enterprise software on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure;\n\nVerrazzano — an open source enterprise container platform curated by Oracle.\n\nIn this blog post we want to share the highlights of Oracle’s open source projects and community updates in the past six months.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about new releases.\n\nNew Releases\n\nJava 21\n\nIn accordance with the six month release schedule, Java 21 was released on September 19.

This brings significant performance improvements, especially for Helidon MP.\n\nSupport for MicroProfile 6.0 in Helidon MP;\n\nA transition to blocking APIs for enhanced performance and the increased simplicity — learn how to migrate.\n\nLearn more about this release in the release blog post and video.\n\nCoherence CE v23.03\n\nCoherence CE is an open source distribution of Coherence — a scalable, fault-tolerant, cloud-ready, distributed platform for building grid-based applications and reliably storing data.\n\nThe 23.03 release from March brings the following updates:\n\nNative Python and Go clients enabling Python and Go applications to act as cache clients to an Oracle Coherence cluster using gRPC as the network transport. See Python and Go projects on GitHub for more details.\n\nCDI Response Caching — Use annotations to provide response caching in CDI-enabled applications such as Helidon;\n\nImprovements in topics management;\n\nMicroprofile Health that enables you to publish Coherence health checks into the MicroProfile Health Check Registries available at runtime;\n\nGradle POF Plugin, providing automated instrumentation of classes with the @PortableType annotation.\n\nNew projects\n\nIn the past six months we also released several new projects. Here are just a few highlights, you can find more of them at github.com/oracle and github.com/oracle-samples.\n\nGraal Cloud Native\n\nGraal Cloud Native (GCN) is a curated set of open source Micronaut framework modules that simplify multi-cloud application development and are designed from the ground up to be compiled ahead-of-time with GraalVM Native Image. GCN enables easy building of portable cloud native Java microservices that start instantly and use fewer resources to reduce compute costs.\n\nUse the GCN Launcher to build your multi-cloud application starter.\n\nOracle Java Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code\n\nThe Oracle Java Platform extension brings full featured Java development for Maven and Gradle projects to VS Code. It includes features such as project view, autocomplete, error highlighting, debugging, unit testing support for JUnit, and more.\n\nAt the core of a VS Code extension supporting a programming language is a language server — a backend that operates the language’s tools and communicates with the IDE using the Language Server Protocol. This Java language server is a slimmed down version of the one developed in the Apache Netbeans project, and it is based on the OpenJDK JDK’s javac compiler for code editing and compilation and on OpenJDK’s debugger interface for debugging. This allows VS Code IDE support for new JDK features as soon as they are introduced, even during Early Access of the JDK. To this effect, this VS Code Extension will support the current JDK releases as well as the next upcoming JDK version.\n\nThe extension already has more than 5000 installs on the Visual Studio Code marketplace! Get it from the marketplace or navigate to the project repository to get started.\n\nYO: a CLI client for Oracle Cloud\n\nYo is a command-line client for managing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) instances. It makes launching OCI instances as simple as rudely telling your computer “yo, launch an instance”. Its goals are speed, ease of use, and simplicity. It was originally designed to help developers in the Oracle Linux team quickly launch disposable VMs for testing, but rapidly got much wider traction.\n\nA few quick commands to show what you can do with Yo:\n\n# Launch an instance based on your default settings, and SSH into it\n\nyo launch -s\n\n# Launch a flexible instance with given shape, size, and name\n\nyo launch -S VM.Standard.E4.Flex --cpu 3 --mem 12 -n my-vm\n\n# SSH into my-vm\n\nyo ssh my-vm\n\n# Copy files to my-vm\n\nyo scp ./files my-vm:\n\n# Terminate my-vm\n\nyo terminate my-vm\n\nOracle Guardian AI\n\nOracle Guardian AI Open Source Project is a library consisting of tools to assess fairness/bias and privacy of machine learning models and data sets.\n\nGet started with Oracle Guardian AI on GitHub:\n\nOCI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code\n\nThe OCI Toolkit for Visual Studio (VS) Code provides a set of features that helps developers create, test, and deploy resources and applications on OCI from within VS Code. It seamlessly integrates with OCI services and supports the following services: Functions, Resource Manager, and Data Science. The toolkit also helps you to rapidly prototype cloud solutions, explore new services, and accomplish quick coding tasks via Quick Start templates.\n\nInstall the OCI Toolkit to get started.\n\nOCI MLflow Plugin\n\nThe OCI MLflow plugin enables OCI users to use OCI resources to manage the life cycle of their machine learning use cases and run MLflow experiments. MLflow is a popular open source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. You can use MLflow with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science after installing it with pip:\n\npip install oci-mlflow\n\nFollow the quick start guide for next steps, or check out the project on GitHub:\n\nBPFTune\n\nbpftune provides lightweight, always-on auto-tuning of system behaviour for Linux. After installing and starting it, you can observe the adjustments bpftune made to the system — for example:\n\n$ sudo grep bpftune /var/log/messages\n\n...\n\nApr 19 16:14:59 bpftest bpftune[2778]: bpftune works fully\n\nApr 19 16:14:59 bpftest bpftune[2778]: bpftune supports per-netns policy (via netns cookie)\n\nApr 19 16:18:40 bpftest bpftune[2778]: Scenario 'specify bbr congestion control' occurred for tunable 'TCP congestion control' in global ns.
