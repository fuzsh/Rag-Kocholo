        "text": "Pangolins are the most trafficked species in the world. Currently, there are eight species of these armored placental mammals. The word “pangolin,” which means “rolling over” in Malay, relates to this animal’s propensity to ball up when frightened. Pangolins are fascinating creatures that are often described as living fossils due to their ancient lineage and distinctive physical characteristics. These nocturnal, isolated animals are easily identified by their thick scale covering.\n\nPangolins are found in parts of Asia and Africa and are highly valued for their meat and scales, which are believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. There is also demand in the United States for pangolin products. This is particularly for leather in fashion products, such as boots, bags, and belts.\n\nUnfortunately, these factors have led to the pangolin being one of the most trafficked animals in the world, making them critically endangered in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these unique animals and preserve their habitats, but much more work is needed to ensure their survival.\n\nWhere can the pangolin be found?\n\nThe habitats of pangolins are known to be highly diverse, ranging from tropical forests to grasslands. Additionally, they have made areas of horticulture and dense grasses their home. They typically reside in holes or hollow tree trunks. Generally speaking, pangolins fall into one of two categories: arboreal pangolins or terrestrial pangolins. Every species of these mammals is known to be a skilled swimmer over short distances, and they are also known to be nocturnal.\n\nArboreal pangolins reside in hollow trees, whilst ground-dwelling pangolins build tunnels that are 3.5 metres deep. Burrows are known to be the homes of pangolins that dwell on land. A full-grown adult human can crawl into a burrow and stand tall, according to research, and its depth can be very great.\n\nPangolin Ecology\n\nWhen it comes to different pangolin species, gestation cycles often vary and might last anywhere from 70 to 140 days. African pangolins only produce one offspring at a time, compared to the one to three offspring that most Asian pangolin species produce. The newborn spawn weighs between 80 and 450 grammes and has an average of roughly 150 millimetres in length.\n\nAt birth, the scales are believed to be silky and white. Only after a few days of development do the offspring’s scales begin to darken, harden, and begin to resemble those of an adult pangolin. The mother tends to the young in the early stages and stays in the burrow with it. When the mother is moving about, it’s not uncommon for the kids to cling to her tail.\n\nBut for species that live in burrows, the young spend the first two to four weeks of their lives in the burrow. They first leave the burrow after a month and do so while riding on their mother’s back. Around three months is when weaning normally starts, and around this time, the infants usually start to hunt and consume other insects as sustenance. When pangolins are two years old, their sexual development is deemed complete, and their mother abandons them.\n\nMeet the 8 Pangolin Species\n\nThere are eight species of pangolin, all of which are found in Asia and Africa. They are\n\nIndian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata): This is the most common species of pangolin, found in India and parts of Southeast Asia. They have thick, overlapping scales and a prehensile tail that they use to climb trees.\n\nChinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla): This species is found in China, Vietnam, and parts of Southeast Asia. They have smaller, rounder scales and are more arboreal than other pangolins.\n\nSunda Pangolin (Manis javanica): This species is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and parts of Southeast Asia. They have longer, more slender scales and a prehensile tail that they use to grasp onto branches.\n\nPhilippine Pangolin (Manis culionensis): This species is found only in the Philippines. They have shorter, thicker scales than other pangolin species and are adapted to live in a forest habitat.\n\nTree Pangolin (Manis tricuspis): This species is found in West and Central Africa. They have long, slender scales and a prehensile tail that they use to climb trees.\n\nGiant Ground Pangolin (Smutsia gigantea): This is the largest species of pangolin, found in Central and West Africa. They have large, overlapping scales and are adapted to a ground-dwelling lifestyle.\n\nGround Pangolin (Smutsia temminckii): This species is found in Southern and Eastern Africa. They have shorter, overlapping scales and are adapted to a ground-dwelling lifestyle.\n\nBlack-bellied Pangolin (Phataginus tetradactyla): This species is found in West and Central Africa. They have small, round scales and a prehensile tail that they use to climb trees.\n\nAll eight species of pangolin are threatened with extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Urgent action is needed to protect these unique and important animals and their habitats.\n\nThreats faced by Pangolins\n\nThe meat of every pangolin species has been harvested, and the organs, skin, scales, and other body parts are prized for their traditional medical applications. As a result, all eight species’ numbers have decreased. The scales of pangolins are made of keratin, the same protein that forms human hair and nails. Kertain is believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Despite the lack of scientific evidence to support the use of pangolin scales for medicinal purposes, their use continues to be widespread.\n\nPangolin scales are highly valued for their perceived medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. They are believed to have healing properties and are used to treat a variety of ailments, including arthritis, psoriasis, and lactation problems. In addition to their scales, pangolins are also hunted for their meat, which is considered a delicacy in some cultures.\n\nPangolin meat is typically consumed in a soup or stew and is believed to have health benefits, including boosting the immune system and improving kidney function. Pangolin skin is also used to make leather goods, including wallets, belts, and shoes. The skin is highly durable and water-resistant, making it an attractive material for luxury goods. Post the pandemic, the illegal trade of pangolins, and most other species has moved online. Watch the following webinar to understand how you can help counter wildlife cybercrime.\n\nHow are pangolins hunted?\n\nThe animals are often captured using traps or snares, which can cause them significant injury or even death. They are also hunted using dogs, guns, and other weapons. Once captured, pangolins are often transported long distances, sometimes across international borders, in appalling conditions. Many animals do not survive the journey, and those that do often suffer from dehydration, starvation, or disease.\n\nThe Illegal Trade Flourishes despite international regulations\n\nThe illegal trade in pangolins is driven by a high demand for their products in Asian markets, particularly in China and Vietnam. Despite the illegal status of the trade, pangolin products are still openly sold in many traditional medicine shops and markets in these countries.\n\nThe threats to pangolins are not limited to hunting and trafficking. Habitat loss and fragmentation are also significant threats to the survival of these animals. As forests are cleared due to agriculture and development, pangolin habitats are destroyed, and populations become more isolated and vulnerable to hunting.\n\nIt is highly unfortunate that despite the onset of covid-19, we have not learnt our lesson. Pangolins are thought to the source of the covid 19 pandemic! Despite this, their illegal trade continues to flourish. Scientists have ringing alarm bells of the looming threat of zoonotic diseases due to the illegal wildlife trade decades prior to the pandemic. Reluctance to curb the issue will keep public health vulnerable to future viruses. The following podcast interview elaborates further on the pressing problem of zoonotic diseases.\n\nHow are pangolins being conserved?\n\nUnfortunately, the demand for pangolin products has led to a significant decline in pangolin populations worldwide. All eight species of pangolin are now listed as threatened with extinction, with the illegal trade in pangolins being a major driver of their decline. The international trade in pangolins and their products is illegal under (CITES). However, enforcement of these regulations remains weak in many countries, and illegal trade continues to thrive.\n\nWhat else is being done?\n\nAddition to aiding in educating the public about the organization’s efforts to rescue this endangered species, special emphasis is placed on combating the illicit poaching and trafficking of these mammals. The potential for financial intelligence gathering to play a crucial role in putting an end to criminal activity is great. But it frequently falls short of compiling any specific information for itself.\n\nThere have been countless attempts to breed pangolins in captivity. However, due to their extremely varied habitats and extremely restricted diet of mainly insects, these efforts have frequently been ineffective. These people now have hope that they may be able to breed pangolins in captivity thanks to the advancements made by scientists in artificial habitat development.\n\nChina raised protection for the indigenous Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) to the highest degree in June 2020, closing a critical gap for the species’ domestic use. In addition, the government has decided to outlaw the use of pangolin scales in traditional medicine, which is a significant victory considering that an estimated 195,000 pangolins were trafficked in 2019 for their scales alone (Challender, et. al, 2020). The pangolin faces a range of threats that are driving it towards extinction. Urgent action is needed to protect these unique animals and their habitats, including stronger law enforcement to combat the illegal trade in pangolins, and efforts to conserve their natural habitats.\n\nWorld Pangolin Day\n\nWorld Pangolin Day is an annual event held on the third Saturday of February to raise awareness of the plight of pangolins and to promote their conservation. The event was first established in 2012 by the organization Save Pangolins and has since grown to become a global movement involving individuals, organizations, and governments.\n\nThe day is marked by a range of activities and events, including educational programs, fundraising campaigns, and public outreach initiatives. These activities are designed to increase public awareness of the importance of pangolins and the threats that they face.\n\nOne of the main objectives of World Pangolin Day is to highlight the illegal trade in pangolins and their products. The event seeks to raise awareness of the devastating impact of poaching and trafficking on pangolin populations and to encourage greater international cooperation and law enforcement efforts to combat the trade.\n\nAnother key goal of World Pangolin Day is to promote conservation efforts for pangolins and their habitats. This involves supporting the work of conservation organizations, raising funds for conservation projects, and encouraging governments to take action to protect these animals.\n\nWorld Pangolin Day has become an important platform for raising awareness of the plight of pangolins and for promoting their conservation. Through the efforts of individuals, organizations, and governments, we can work to ensure that these unique animals are protected and preserved for future generations.\n\nWritten by: @Mohammad Thanvir\n\nConservation project to provide alternative, sustainable livelihoods to the communities living with wildlife.
