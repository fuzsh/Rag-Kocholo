Seals evolved from two distinct groups of land mammals and are consequently categorised into ‘eared’ seals and true seals.\n\nAlmost all of the seals found along Australia’s coastline are eared seals, categorised by their movement on land with four limbs, larger necks, teeth and small external ears. The Australian Sea-lion is found around islands on the southern coast, with opportunities to swim with these ‘puppy dogs of the sea’ off the Eyre Peninsula. Unlike other sea-lions, the species only breeds every 17-18 months, with Seal Bay on Kangaroo Island supporting the third largest colony of Australian Sea-lions with a population of around 1,000. Sea-lions can also be seen on the way out to Bremer Canyon, where Orcas area also prevelant.\n\nAustralian Fur Seals are seen year round on Phillip Island and southern Tasmania and are known to dive at least 200 metres in search of prey. Bull seals return to Seal Rocks off Phillip Island for the breeding season after foraging in Bass Strait for ten months, with cows (adult female seals) giving birth to one pup around mid December. During summer, the seal population at Seal Rocks swells to more than 30,000 seals. The Long-nosed Fur Seal is smaller than Australian Fur Seals and also has a more pointed snout. They are found in abundant numbers around Kangaroo Island and the Eyre Peninsula, with breeding also taking place over the summer."
