        "text": "Population: 4 million\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island and Falkland Islands\n\nWhen: December to February\n\nThe second-largest penguins in the world (after the emperor), king penguins are an attractive lot with a fiery golden plumage around their heads, and dark grey bodies. Male king penguins incubate the eggs on their feet while covering them with a special pouch to keep them warm.\n\nPopulation: 595,000\n\nFind them: Northern Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: at the end of breeding season in November\n\nThe big daddy of the penguin world, emperor penguins can grow up to 1.2 metres tall (4 ft) and weigh up to 45 kilograms (100 lbs). They are only found deep in the coldest parts of Antarctica and huddle together in large groups to stay warm.\n\nPopulation: 5 million\n\nFind them: Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: breeding from October to February, chicks present from late December to February\n\nEasily recognised by the white ring around their eyes, the Adélies also have stiff wings that can propel them underwater to depths of 100 metres (330 ft). Aside from emperor penguins, Adélie penguins are the only true Antarctic penguins, meaning they live there all year long.\n\nPopulation: 18 million\n\nFind them: South Georgia plus one colony on the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: breeding season changes annually, but usually between November and March\n\nShort, rotund and sporting a pair of yellow eyebrows that put even the most avant-garde makeup artists to shame, macaroni penguins are as handsome as they are aggressive – males frequently fight other penguins within their colony.\n\nPopulation: 774,000\n\nFind them: Antarctic Peninsula, Falkland Islands\n\nWhen: breeding from October to February with chicks present from late December to January\n\nThese active critters spend a large part of their time hunting and eating. Known for their speed in the water, the gentoo penguin hunts for krill, smaller fish and squid. With an orange beak that looks a little like a smear of lipstick and a ‘bonnet’ of white feathers, they're also undeniably adorable.\n\nPopulation: 14 million\n\nFind them: Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: breeding October to November with chicks present from late December to early February\n\nThese creatures are easily identified by their thin ‘beard’ of black feathers and live in colonies of hundreds of thousands. Chinstrap penguins’ mating habits are quite dramatic. Males fight for the best nest position and then reserve it for five days – if the female doesn’t arrive in time, he may look for another mate. ​\n\nPopulation: 300,000\n\nFind them: Southern Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: November to March\n\nThe only seals that kill other mammals for food, the solitary and adventurous leopard seal will migrate far and wide in search of a feast. They have long bodies covered in spots (hence the name) and incredibly sharp teeth. As they aren’t fond of company, spotting them is a rare treat.\n\nPopulation: 15 million\n\nFind them: anywhere with pack ice\n\nWhen: October to December\n\nCrabeaters are the most commonly found seal in the world, with an estimated population of up to 15 million. The male and females are both roughly the same size and have pale, cream-coloured fur and a pointy face. You won't care that they're common when you see them – trust us.\n\nPopulation: 4.5 - 6.2 million\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands\n\nWhen: October to January\n\nMale Antarctic fur seals can weigh up to 180 kilograms (400 pounds), which is much larger than their female counterparts. They are silvery grey on their backs, with brown stomachs and a hairy mane on their neck and shoulders, which is how they get their name (and all the attention).\n\nPopulation: 650,000\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island, Elephant Island\n\nWhen: males take to the beach from November to secure breeding space\n\nThe largest species of seal in the world, males weigh up to 3600 kilograms (four tons) and sport a prominent schnoz that they use to roar and attract mates. Come breeding season, males fight for their right to secure a piece of territory on the beach and attract a bevy of beautiful lady seals.\n\nPopulation: 250,000\n\nFind them: Southern Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: breeding from September to December\n\nMales and females are about the same size and are dark grey on their backs and light grey underneath. They are characterised by a small face with huge eyes, and light streaky patterns across their whole bodies. Weddell seals breed further south than any other mammal in Antarctica.\n\nPopulation: 78,000\n\nFind them: dense pack ice in the Southern Ocean\n\nWhen: November to December\n\nThe rarest of the Antarctic seals, the Ross are solitary hunters who stick mainly to thick pack ice. As it’s the breakdown of pack ice during the warmer months that allows humans to access the Antarctic’s waters, catching sight of these little creatures is highly unlikely.\n\nPopulation: 10,000 - 25,000\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island and Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: most active February to March\n\nThe largest animal to have ever lived on planet earth. Just let that sink in for a minute. Ok, ready for more? The biggest blue whale on record weighed nearly 200 tonnes – to put that in perspective, an adult male African elephant weighs 6 tonnes. Blue-grey in colour, these beauties are rarely spotted, but if seen are impossible to forget.\n\nPopulation: 70,000\n\nFind them: all over Antarctica\n\nWhen: most active February to March\n\nThe ‘killer whale’ is technically part of the dolphin family. With their iconic glossy black back and striking white bellies, there is little chance of missing this mammal if they are close by. Males grow up to nine-and-a-half metres (31 ft) in length, while females clock in at seven metres (23 ft).\n\nPopulation: 30,000 - 40,000\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island and Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: most active February to March\n\nThe humpback’s white neck, huge size (up to 40 tonnes), hump and frequent breaches make them one of the easiest whales to spot if they’re nearby. Look out for the great spout of water called a ‘blow’ they expel from their double blowholes – these sprays can reach up to three metres.\n\nPopulation: 500,000\n\nFind them: South Georgia Island and Antarctic Peninsula\n\nWhen: most active February to March\n\nOne of the smallest whales, a minke whale maxes out at around 10 tonnes. These slender and acrobatic creatures like to breach and dive under ships, although they are fast swimmers, so you need to be on the ball to spot them.\n\nPopulation: 10,000\n\nFind them: Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands\n\nWhen: most active January to March\n\nOne of the slowest moving whales, the southern right whale can weigh up to 80 tonnes and is the only large whale without a dorsal fin. Black and mottled brown in colour with some white around the eyes, these beauties can be quite the show-offs and are prone to breaching, headstands and curious nature.\n\nPopulation: 85,000\n\nFind them: Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands\n\nWhen: most active January to March\n\nWhile female fin whales can weigh up to 130 tonnes, don’t let their size fool you – these remarkably nimble whales are known as the greyhounds of the sea. During the 20th century they were almost hunted to extinction, so spotting them today is a rare and humbling experience.\n\nPopulation: 26,000\n\nFind them: all over the continent, but most common in the skies around South Georgia\n\nWhen: breeding season in December and January\n\nOne of the world’s largest seabirds, the albatross spends most of its time up in the air and can be spotted easily thanks to its long wings. They love to glide behind big ships, so when you’re standing out on deck, look up at the skies and you may spot these graceful birds.\n\nPopulation: 20,000\n\nFind them: all over the continent\n\nWhen: breeding season from November to December\n\nWith its long neck and dazzling blue peepers, the blue-eyed cormorant cuts a pretty figure. They fly in large flocks and hang out around the Falkland Islands, South Georgia Island, the South Shetland Islands and the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nPopulation: 3.5 million\n\nFind them: all over the continent\n\nWhen: breeding season from November to January\n\nAh, gulls. One of the hardiest and most misunderstood of all the seabirds. These opportunistic creatures will feed whenever and wherever they can – including penguin eggs and the skin and blubber of live southern right whales."
