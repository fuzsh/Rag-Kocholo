        "text": "We’ve all heard of the island of Bali in Indonesia.\n\nIt’s one of the world’s most exotic travel destinations. The beaches, nature, and greenness are heavenly, and this imagery is the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of “Indonesia.”\n\nAnother fascinating component of Bali is its fauna, with the Komodo dragon being its most famous species. The dragon has been named the largest lizard, and the deadly venom in its saliva makes it one of the most lethal predators in the world.\n\nIn this article, we’ll introduce you to Indonesian animal words that will help you talk about the variety of unique animals that live in Indonesia as well as the most common animals abroad. Orangutans, Sumatran tigers, Bali starlings…these animals, and many more, will make for an appealing conversation topic during your next trip to Indonesia.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s get right into it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAt Home (Pets)\n\nOn the Farm (Farm Animals)\n\nIn the Wild / Forest / Safari (Land Animals)\n\nIn the Ocean (Aquatic / Marine Animals)\n\nBugs and Insects\n\nBirds\n\nReptiles & Amphibians\n\nAnimal Body Parts\n\nAnimal-Related Idioms and Slang Expressions\n\nConclusion\n\n1. At Home (Pets)\n\nRaising pets is not as common in Indonesia as it is in the West. Housepets are an expense that the majority of the population cannot afford; their main concern is putting food on the table, not feeding and caring for a dog or cat. House pets are mostly raised in the countryside, where families use them for their eggs, milk, and other animal products.\n\nThe tradition of owning pets (especially dogs and cats) is not really part of Indonesian culture, though birds are an exception. Free movement of pets in and out of the house is not something Indonesians would tolerate, especially given that 86.7% of Indonesia’s population is Muslim.\n\nIn Islam, dogs are deemed Najis (unclean) animals. A Muslim believer, when touched or licked by a dog, is required to change their clothes and wash the body parts that made contact with the dog. If you’re planning to have Indonesian friends or cleaning staff over at your apartment, they may expect you to keep your pet at a distance, given that they would want to avoid touching it.\n\nIf you want an environment with more tolerance for your pet, the Balinese are an ethnic group that does usually raise dogs. This is because they believe dogs’ barking keeps away bad luck.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Batak and Manado ethnic groups happen to eat dogs, and Chinese Indonesians (along with Christians) tolerate dogs more than their fellow Muslim countrymen.\n\nHere are the names of animals in Indonesian that you might find kept as pets in your country:"
