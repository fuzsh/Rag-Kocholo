        "text": "The dugong, a gentle marine mammal related to the manatee, has been declared functionally extinct in China‘s waters.\n\nResearch by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences said fishing, ship strikes and human-caused habitat loss have seen the number of dugongs in Chinese waters decrease rapidly since the 70s.\n\nWith no evidence of their presence in China since 2008, the report said this is “the first functional extinction of a large mammal in China’s coastal waters”.\n\nDugong still exist elsewhere in the world – they can be found in coastal waters from East Africa to Vanuatu, and as far north as Japan – but are facing similar threats.\n\nThey are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nWhat are dugong?\n\nThe dugong is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees.\n\nSirenia are commonly referred to as sea cows. They are aquatic, herbivorous mammals that tend to live in swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters.\n\nDugong largely eat seagrass, and tend to leave in bays and around inshire islands. They prefer shallow waters.\n\nThey tend to grow to around 2.5m in length and can weight up to 900kg.\n\nThey have two flippers at the front of their bodies, and no dorsal fins or rear limbs. The key difference between dugong and manatees is the dugong’s dolphin-like tail fin.\n\nDugong have snouts that look similar to seals, and have simple molar teeth.\n\nThey have a life expectancy of around 70, and reach sexual maturity between the ages of eight and 18.\n\nDugong are social animals, but are often found alone or living in pairs. This is due to patches of seagrass often not being large enough to support larger populations.\n\nThey are cited as being a possible inspiration for mermaids in folklore and mythology.\n\nWhy are they extinct in China?\n\nDugong marine habitats have been rapidly degraded by humans, and although restoration and recovery efforts are a key priority in China, “restoration takes time that dugongs may no longer have”, the report said.\n\nProfessor Samuel Turvey of ZSL’s Institute of Zoology, a co-author of the study, said the disappearance of dugongs in China was a devastating loss.\n\n“Their absence will not only have a knock-on effect on ecosystem function, but also serves as a wake-up call – a sobering reminder that extinctions can occur before effective conservation actions are developed,” he said.\n\nThe study was carried out by a team of international scientists who conducted interviews in 66 fishing communities across four Chinese provinces along the coastal region of the South China Sea.\n\nOn average, residents reported not having seen a dugong for 23 years. Only three people said they had seen one in the past five years.\n\nThe authors said they would welcome any evidence that dugongs might still exist in China. They recommended that the species regional status be reassessed as “Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)”."
