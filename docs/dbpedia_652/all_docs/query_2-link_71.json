        "text": "What are pangolins?\n\nPangolins are a unique group of insect-eating animals, feeding mainly on termites and ants. They may look like reptiles, with their bodies covered in overlapping scales, but they’re actually mammals! Pangolins are about the size of a house cat, with small heads, long snouts, and thick tails. These prehistoric mammals, which have been around for 80 million years, are now threatened with extinction.\n\nDid you know that pangolins are the only mammals in the world covered in scales? Made of keratin—the same material that makes fingernails and hair—the pangolin’s sand-coloured scales protect it from predators. When threatened, pangolins roll into a tight ball to shield their soft underparts (and if the idea of a yellow-coloured creature covered in scales and curled up into a ball sounds familiar, you might be thinking of the Pokémon Sandshrew, which is often said to be partly modelled based on a pangolin).\n\nPangolins are solitary animals. They usually live by themselves and do most of their hunting at night. They only seek out other pangolins when it’s time to mate. After a gestation period of 70 to 140 days, baby pangolins ride on their mother’s tails until they’re weaned, and surprisingly, it’s not uncommon for the fathers to stay with the family until the offspring are independent.\n\nThere are eight species of pangolin which are split into two main groups—African pangolins and Asian pangolins.\n\nHow big are pangolins?\n\nEach species of pangolin is a slightly different size, ranging from around 114 centimeters (45 inches) to 137 centimeters (54 inches) long. Different species also have different-sized tails, with the tree-climbing pangolins having much longer tails than the ground pangolins. The longest tail belongs to the black-bellied (or long-tailed) pangolin, and it can reach up to two times the length of its body.\n\nHow much do pangolins weigh?\n\nThe different species of pangolin vary in size. The smallest, the black-bellied pangolin, weighs around 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds), while the largest, the giant ground pangolin, can reach 33 kilograms (73 pounds).\n\nWhere do pangolins live?\n\nPangolins are native to Africa and Asia. They can be found in woodland and savannah habitats. Some live in trees while others live on the ground. The tree-climbing species make homes for themselves in hollow trees, while the ground-dwelling species dig deep burrows for nesting.\n\nWhat do pangolins eat?\n\nPangolins are often referred to as scaly anteaters, and for good reason—they use their long, sticky tongues, which can extend up to 40 cm (16 inches), to slurp up ants. Their diets also include termites, larvae, flies, worms, and crickets. Because they hunt at night and have poor eyesight, pangolins usually locate nests through their sense of smell. They use their long, sharp claws to dig into nests and reach their prey, and when the insects fight back, they use special muscles to close off their nostrils and ears to prevent unwanted visitors.\n\nAre pangolins dangerous?\n\nPangolins are more afraid of you than you are of them. These shy, insectivorous creatures won’t attack a human. When threatened, they resort to coiling into a tight sphere in self-defense, relying on their sharp scales to deter predators.\n\nDo pangolins make good pets?\n\nPangolins make terrible pets, and it is illegal to own them. They are not well-suited to living in any environment outside of their natural habitat. In fact, many zoos that have tried to house pangolins have found that most die within their first year out of the wild due to stress or dietary issues. It’s also important to remember that keeping wild animals is dangerous for humans and domesticated animals, primarily due to the potential spread of zoonotic diseases. The exotic pet trade is also unethical due to the poor conditions in which the animals are kept as they are transported and the traumatic process of removing them from the wild, which often involves tearing young animals away from their families or killing other animals in the process.\n\nDespite this, pangolins are unfortunately part of the exotic pet trade, as well as the international trade for traditional medicine. At IFAW, we’re working hard to protect pangolins from the poaching crisis they’re facing, and together with other NGOs, we succeeded in upgrading pangolins from Appendix II of CITES to Appendix I. This prohibits the international trade of pangolins and their body parts.\n\nWhy are pangolins trafficked?\n\nPangolins are the most trafficked mammals in the world due to high demand for their scales and claws in traditional medicine. Their meat is considered a delicacy in some Asian countries and consumed as bushmeat in some African countries. All eight species are now threatened with extinction, and three species—the Chinese pangolin, the Philippe pangolin, and the Sunda pangolin—are listed as critically endangered.\n\nAlthough there are now international trade bans in place to protect pangolins, trafficking continues to be a problem—and it’s difficult to prevent or seize all illegal shipments of wildlife products. As long as demand for the product survives, new poachers and trading groups will keep appearing.\n\nIt’s important to note that, although most poached pangolins are used for food or medicine, they are not an essential commodity. The meat is usually sent to far-off countries as a needless luxury, and medical science doesn’t recognize any medicinal benefits in pangolin scales."
