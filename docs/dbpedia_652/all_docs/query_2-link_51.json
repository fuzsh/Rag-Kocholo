        "text": "In the book The Emirates: A Natural History, published by the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi in 2005 (Hellyer and Aspinall 2005), Dr Chris Drew and his wife, who authored the chapter on mammals, listed 43 species known from UAE, of which 5 were extinct. As of 2022, the list now contains 58 species of mammals known to occur or to have occurred in recent decades in the nation (Appendix), adding 15 new species in the past 17 years. Four are feral species, which were already present in the natural environment, but not previously listed; four (Northern Palm-Squirrel, Indian Desert Jird, Patagonian Mara and Aoudad) are newly reported introduced species, of which the Northern Palm-Squirrel is already well-established, while the seven remaining are new addition to the native fauna, and previously unrecorded. Of these 58 species overall, 44 are native species distributed among six orders and 18 families, of which 10 are endemic or near endemic to the Arabian Peninsula (Fig. 14.2a). When adding the 12 feral or well-established introduced non-native species, the number of mammalian orders represented in the UAE fauna raises to eight and the number of families to 21 (Fig. 14.2b). Six species, and probably seven if we include the Honey Badger, can be considered as locally extinct. Among the 37 extant (i.e. still living) native species, bats are the most diversified with 13 species, followed by the rodents with nine species, and the carnivores with seven species. The geographic position of the United Arab Emirates, at the crossroad of different continents and biogeographic realms, is reflected in its mammal fauna. Without entering in the phylogenetic origin of the species, but broadly considering their extant distribution ranges, the native mammalian fauna of UAE has a more important palearctic origin (55% of species), than afro-tropical (32%), while the Indomalaya origin accounts for only two species (the Indian Crested Porcupine and the White-tailed Mongoose). Spatially, mammal diversity is the highest in the Hajar Mountains (Fig. 14.3), with 19 species regularly using mountainous habitats, but only four of them are strictly confined to this ecosystem, most of them are also using other habitats, like shrublands, farms or forested areas.\n\n2.1 Native Rodents\n\nNine species of native rodents are known in UAE, distributed among three families: the porcupine family (Hystricidae, one species), the Jerboa family (Dipodidae, one species), and the mouse and rat family (Muridae, seven species). In this last family, the sub-family of Gerbils and Jirds (Gerbillinae) is the most diverse with six species, while only one true native mouse is present, the Arabian Spiny Mouse (Acomys dimidiatus, Fig. 14.4). The latter is a nocturnal sociable species, that forages at night for seeds, and sometimes insects and grasses. It is mainly found in the wadi beds of the Hajar mountains, and more rarely in farms or shrubby areas. It has been reported from Nad Al Sheba in Dubai. The Wagnerâ€™s Gerbil (Gerbillus dayurus) is the secund most common species of native rodent found in the mountains, where it prefers rocky slopes and terraces than wadi beds and is generally more abundant than the Spiny Mouse at higher elevation (Melville and Chaber 2016). This species, also active at night, spends the day in holes, often under the perennial bushy spurge, Euphorbia larica, one of the dominant plants growing on the slopes of the mountains.\n\nThe Indian Crested Porcupine is the third and largest native species of rodent found in mountainous habitats. This species was only recently discovered in UAE. In April 2014, Alexander Cloke, working for Emirates Nature-WWF, briefly observed at night an animal, that he identified as a Porcupine, fleeing away from the roadside near the entrance of Wadi Wurayah National Park, some 600 km from the speciesâ€™ nearest known distribution range edge in Arabia. It was only in 2015â€“2016 that the presence of this species was confirmed by pictures obtained from a network of camera traps deployed by Emirates Nature-WWF and Fujairah Municipality in the National Park, and from interviews of residents conducted by the park staff (Chreiki et al. 2018). In 2018, Indian Crested Porcupine was also recorded by camera traps in Abu Dhabi emirate in some coastal areas near Mirbah (Al Dhaheri et al. 2018).\n\nThe Lesser Jerboa, which looks like a miniature kangaroo with its disproportionately large hind legs is a nocturnal and secretive species; it is found in the inter-dunal plains of sandy areas. Data are lacking to establish its status in UAE. The species was listed as â€˜Near Threatenedâ€™ in the UAE National Red Data List published by Richard Hornby in 1996, and as Data Deficient for the Abu Dhabi Red List in 2005 (Drew and Tourenq 2005).\n\nGerbils and Jirds are well-adapted to live in sandy deserts, able to cope with high temperatures and food scarcity. All UAE species, except the Wagnerâ€™s Gerbil which is a mountain species, are found in sand dunes and interdunal gravel plains that offer some vegetation cover. The most common are certainly the Baluchistan and Cheesmanâ€™s Gerbils. The Baluchistan or Dwarf Gerbil, rather similar in appearance to the Wagnerâ€™s Gerbil, with a yellow-grey back and white belly, is a solitary nocturnal animal. Cheesmanâ€™s Gerbil is slightly larger, with an orange back. Both lives in burrows during the days and go out at night to forage for seeds and other plant materials. Three species of Jirds are present in UAE. The Arabian Jird (Meriones arimalius), endemic to central and East Arabia, was for some time considered a sub-species of the Lybian Jird (Meriones lybicus) found further north in Arabia. Based on genetic analysis, it is now considered a valid species (Cassola 2016). Very little is known on this species, except for a few records in sandy deserts. The Sundevallâ€™s Jird (Meriones crassus) is a more common and widespread species of sand deserts, living in colonies or alone according to environmental conditions. Fat Jird (Psammomys obesus) is another recent addition to the mammal fauna of UAE. Mentioned by Cunningham (2004) as a good candidate species to be found in UAE, as it was known from Qatar and South-eastern Saudi Arabia, it was effectively discovered by wildlife researchers of the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi (EAD) in June 2019 by camera trapping (EAD, pers. Comm.).\n\nRodents play important role in their ecosystems as they disperse seeds on which they feed and are an important food resource for numerous predators, like owls, diurnal raptors, and mammalian carnivores.\n\n2.2 Bats: An Under-studied Group in the UAE\n\nBats constitutes a difficult taxonomic group to study, which explains the paucity of information related to these species in UAE. Very little is known, even the list of species present is not yet fully established (Judas et al. 2018). Most of the knowledge on UAE bats fauna date back from field surveys conducted by Paul Harrison in the 1950s and published in its authoritative book on Mammals of Arabia (Harrison and Bates 1991). Surveys conducted by Emirates Nature-WWF in 2018â€“2019 contributed to the addition of three new species to the UAE fauna, the Geoffroyâ€™s Bat (Myotis emarginatus), the Bottaâ€™s Serotine bat (Eptesicus bottae, Fig. 14.5), the Egyptian Tomb Bat (Taphozous perforatus), and some more species likely remain to be found (Judas, pers.info). As of 2022, 13 species belonging to 4 families have been identified, including 4 additional species to add to the 9 species listed by Harrison.\n\nThe Vespertilionidae is the most represented bat family, with seven species. The most common species is the Kuhlâ€™s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii, Fig. 14.6), a widespread species, that benefits from human development and urbanization (see also Chap. 23). If you see a bat flying in the urban streets or parks (Dubai, Sharjah or Abu Dhabi) at dusk or night, it will most probably be this species. They live in colonies of a few dozen to some hundred individuals under the roof of villas or building that they access through very tiny holes. The Sind Serotine (Rhyneptesicus nasutus) seems to also be widespread throughout the UAE, although in lower abundance than the Kuhlâ€™s Pipistrelle. They live alone or in small family groups, probably hiding in small rock crevasses or under the bark of trees. Little is known on their habitat and ecology. The Common Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), one of the most common and widespread species in Western Europe and across Turkey up to West Asia, has been recorded once in 2018 in Abu Dhabi Western Region, during surveys conducted by a private environmental assessment company (Smithson, pers. comm.). The Parti-coloured Bat (Vespertilio murinus) has also been recorded only once in Sharjah, from a dead individual found in May 2014 (Monadjem et al. 2016). This migrant species lives in steppes, mountains, and forested areas from Western-Central Europe across central Asia up to North-East China. This record, presumed to be from a vagrant individual, was the first for the Arabian Peninsula. The Hemprichâ€™s Long-Eared Bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), specialized in capturing arthropods from the ground, including scorpions, was also only recorded once in Ras Al Khaimah in the 1970s (Harrison and Bates 1991). It was identified from bones collected in an owl pellet. The lack of further records might simply be due to the absence of surveys.\n\nThe Sheath-tailed Bats family, or Emballonuridae, is represented by two species: the Naked-bellied Tomb Bat (Taphozous nudiventris) and the recently discovered Egyptian Tomb Bat (Taphozous perforatus, Fig. 14.7). The first occurs in colonies in desert rocky outcrops, and along the Western foothills of the Hajar Mountains. Paul Harrison described a new subspecies from the UAE, named Taphozous nudiventris zayedi in honour of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who procured him some specimen from Al Ain and showed him their roost (Harrison 1955). The Naked-belly Tomb Bat seems to prefer the higher elevation of the Hajar Mountains. It has been recorded in Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nThe Old-World Leaf-nosed Bats family, or Hipposideridae, is represented by two species, the Geoffroyâ€™s Trident Leaf-nosed Bat (Asellia tridens, Fig. 14.8) and the Persian Leaf-nosed Bat (Triaenops persicus). Both were present in numbers in the 1950s (Harrison 1955), feeding at night in Al Ain/Buraimi oasis and roosting in the underground network of â€˜falajâ€™ (the traditional irrigation system) (Fig. 14.9). The Geoffroyâ€™s Trident Leaf-nosed Bat is still present at that location in much smaller numbers and can also be found in small caves within the Hajar Mountains. Not recorded from more than 50 years, the echolocation calls of the Persian Leaf-nosed Bat was recorded once by this author during surveys conducted near Jebel Hafit in 2017.\n\nThe Muscat Mouse-tailed Bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum, Fig. 14.10), the only representative of the Mouse-tailed Bats family, or Rhinopomatidae, is relatively widespread in the eastern mountains of the UAE, where it lives in small colonies in caves or abandoned buildings. It can also be found on the Arabian Gulf coast in Sharjah and Dubai, as well as in Jebel Hafit.\n\nThe Egyptian Fruit Bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus, Fig. 14.11), from the Old-World Fruit Bat family, Pteropodidae, also lives in the Mountains of Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, visiting orchards and farms at night in search of fruits, roosting in trees or in caves during the day. This species, the largest found in UAE, is also common in gardens and parks of Al Ain, but more rarely in Abu Dhabi.\n\n2.2.1 Bats as Viral Vectors\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic of 2020â€“2022 (and continuing at the time of writing) has raised growing concerns and fear about bat populations worldwide, driven by the strong suspicion that the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 at the origin of the outbreak took its origin in bats near Wuhan, China. Bats are known to host a large diversity of viruses (Anthony et al. 2017; Markotter et al. 2020) and their implication in several zoonotic outbreaks has been demonstrated. They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg, Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human diseases and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case, contrarily to other viruses, the bats are also affected by the disease. The probability of a new bat-borne virus to jump from bats to humans is believed to be greater in areas of higher bats diversity, where active habitat encroachment favors closer contacts between wildlife and humans, like in the tropical forests of Africa or Asia. However, in 2012, the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a bat coronavirus, showed that outbreaks can also occur in areas of low bat diversity and low human population density, like in Arabia. In 2013, bats were the known reservoirs of more than 60 viruses that can infect humans (Woo and Lau 2019), and there have been at least 30 bat coronaviruses discovered in the last 15 years after the SARS epidemic in 2003. There are clearly some links between bats, human health, and national security. Bats and humans have lived together for thousands of years without records of such emergence of bat-borne virusesâ€™ outbreaks. It is the human disturbances in the environment that are facilitating emergence of these diseases, through activities like deforestation, destruction of their natural feeding and roosting habitats, and hunting animals out of some areas. It is our interactions with these species that are causing diseases to jump. Their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences, when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory (Chan et al. 2013). While bats populations are in severe decline worldwide (Tuttle 2017) and often misleadingly feared (Tuttle 2020), cases of bats being killed by fear, ignorance, and sometimes superstition, have multiplied during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, bats are important to humans by playing important ecological functions in their ecosystems and a major role in agriculture since they pollinate fruit trees (Whittaker and Jones 1994; Kelm et al. 2008) and help controlling populations of insects (Leelapaibul et al. 2005; Kalka et al. 2008). By consuming tons of insects, they also control insects carrying diseases, like mosquitoes. Except the Egyptian Fruit Bat, which as its name indicates is frugivorous, all other species are insectivorous.\n\nAs such, it is important to increase our knowledge of bats and to ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risks of infection but also ensure the conservation of the species and maintain their crucial role in ecosystem services. With the wide recognition of the links between bats and the potential emergence of new bat-borne virus outbreaks, it becomes urgent to get a better understanding of how bats use their environment, and what are the critical habitats they are using. Tracing the origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. At the 6th Public Health Conference at Arab Health 2019 in Dubai, it was agreed that infectious diseases should remain a public health priority and future research and ongoing surveillance is required. While bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbor monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that they are to blame for outbreaks; studying them would also bring in to implement conservation measures to limit disturbance and interactions with humans, protect and restore their habitats.\n\n2.3 Insectivores\n\nThree native mammal species, belonging to the Insectivora Order, have been recorded in the UAE, two species of hedgehogs and one shrew.\n\nThe Ethiopian Hedgehog, or Desert Hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), lives in arid deserts across the whole Arabian Peninsula and in North Africa. It is relatively widespread in the Abu Dhabi emirate, often found in farms and suburbs gardens, where insects, its preferred food, are more easily available.\n\nThe Brandtâ€™s Hedgehog (Paraechinus hypomelas) is a mountain species of Asian origin. Its distribution encompasses a large part of Iran, South Turkmenistan, West Afghanistan and Pakistan (Bhattacharyya et al. 2016). In Arabia, its distribution is not well-known, but has been recorded from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and UAE, where it lives in the Hajar Mountains. It is well represented in Wadi Wurayah National Park and has been noted on Jebel Hafit (Aspinall and Hellyer 2004). Surprisingly, this species is a very good climber, finding shelters among small cavities in steep cliffs.\n\nThe Saviâ€™s Pygmy Shrew, or White-toothed Pygmy Shrew (Suncus etruscus), considered the smallest mammal species in the world, weighs only 1.8 g. It ranges from the Mediterranean basin, both in Africa and Europe, through the Middle East up to Southern Asia, Thailand, and Malaysia. This cryptic species, firstly observed in Sharjah in 2001, is known from very few records in UAE (Jongbloed et al. 2002).\n\n2.4 Carnivores\n\nEight extant native species, belonging to four families represent the Carnivora Order in UAE. Three species belongs to the dog family (Canidae).\n\nThe Red Fox is the most widespread and abundant of the carnivores (Fig. 14.12). This ubiquitous species is well-adapted to live in human vicinity and has largely benefitted from development. Although often persecuted due to his habit of visiting henhouses and killing their inhabitants, red foxes use a large variety of habitats from wadis, mountains, farms, gravel plains, sand desert, up to parks and gardens of the largest cities (Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah), and it thrives over the whole country, benefitting from litter and food waste. It also reaches some of the not-too-distant Abu Dhabi islands, where it can be seen wandering on the beaches. This is mainly a crepuscular or nocturnal species, but it is not rare to see them during daylight, particularly during their breeding season, when they have cubs in spring (March to May). The Arabian subspecies (Vulpes vulpes arabica) is smaller and slender, than his European counterpart. The Blanfordâ€™s Fox (Vulpes cana, Fig. 14.13) is a mountain species with a distribution range, quite similar to the Brandtâ€™s Hedgehog, occurring over Iran with some overlaps on the neighbouring countries, as well as in the mountains of the Arabian Peninsula (Hajar, Dhofar, Asir). Their presence in UAE, and in Arabia more generally, has been detected only recently (Smith et al. 2003). They were first trapped in Wadi Wurayah in 1995. Later surveys have shown their larger distribution through the Hajar Mountains of UAE, although in low density, and they have also been recorded on Jebel Hafit (Aspinall and Hellyer 2004). This species is quite distinctive from the more abundant Red Fox by their smaller size, wide ears, and long bushy tail that is nearly equal to the length of the body. The Ruppellâ€™s Sand Fox (Vulpes rueppellii) is another small fox that prefers to live in desert and semi-desert regions of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula up to Iran. This is a rare species in UAE, known from only few locations in the western region of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe Cats family, Felidae, is also represented by three extant native species. The largest, the Caracal (Caracal Caracal, Fig. 14.14), which weigh between 8 and 15 kg, remains in low numbers in the Hajar Mountains. Successful breeding has been confirmed by camera trapping in Wadi Wurayah in 2014, and a male has been recorded at Jebel Hafit in 2019 (EAD 2021). Its population, as for many other carnivores, has suffered from human persecution, with animals being trapped, killed and hung in trees. Itâ€™s a secretive, nocturnal species, and is very difficult to observe. The status of Arabian Wildcat (Felis lybica) is unclear. Feral cats, similar in appearance to wildcats by their size, fur pattern and general morphology, have been trapped or photographed. However, given the spread of feral cats in all habitats, sometimes deep in the mountains, it is becoming more difficult, perhaps even impossible without genetic analysis, to distinguish in the field between a native Arabian Wildcat, and a feral cat, whose morphology and appearance are very similar to the wild native species. Moreover, as has been demonstrated in Europe, wild populations of another Wildcat, Felis sylvestris, crossbreed with feral cat populations (Randi et al. 2001). Pure-bred Arabian Wildcats may already have vanished or become extremely rare. Only genetic screening of the wild population can clarify this. The Sand Cat, Felis margarita, inhabits sandy and rocky deserts across North Africa, Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula up to West Asia. In UAE, it is known from several locations, mainly in the Abu Dhabi western region, as well as in Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. The species was reported around Sweihan a few decades ago but has not been confirmed recently (Eishaker pers. comm.).\n\nThe White-tailed Mongoose (Herpestes albicaudus) is the only native representant of the Civets and Genets (the Viverridae family). It used to be relatively widespread in the UAE a few decades ago, with records from the agricultural areas of Ras Al Khaimah along its Gulf coast, and in Al Ain, Masafi, and several locations in the Hajar Mountains (Jongbloed et al. 2002). More recently, it has been observed in Wadi Shawka (Ras Al Khaimah emirate, but geographically near to Sharjah, Sawaf pers. comm.).\n\nThe Honey Badger (Mellivora capensis), from the Mustelidae family that includes weasels, ferrets, otters, martens, and minks among others, used to be present in various habitats from the Hajar Mountains to the desert sands of Abu Dhabi. The last record in Abu Dhabi might date back some 20 years ago, from second-hand information reported by Abu Dhabi rangers. More recently, it has been reported from Wadi Shawka in the Hajar Mountains (Buzas, pers. comm.). The paucity of recent records might reflect an important population decrease, which might ultimately lead the species to local extinction, if it is not already the case.\n\nLarger carnivores have already experienced the same fate as the Honey Badger. The most famous example is certainly the case of the Arabian Leopard (Panthera pardus nimr), which once roomed in the Hajar Mountains, but has been led to local extinction from the UAE in the 1990s by constant persecution by hunters and habitat loss. The last record of a wild living leopard in the UAE is probably from an individual killed in Ras Al Khaimah in 1992 (Hellyer and Aspinall 2005). The Striped Hyena and the Arabian Wolf have also paid the price of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, and their populations have been extirpated by persecution. Larger carnivores are often among the first species to disappear from areas where human development occurs. The need for large territories to sustain their food requirements, coupled with their relative low densities, make their populations much more sensitive to the loss of few individuals.\n\n2.5 Ungulates\n\nUngulates refer to a group of large mammals with hooves, which have morphological similarities, but are not necessarily related to each other genetically and taxonomically. This group contains the Artiodactyla, or even-toed Ungulate, which are represented by four extant native species in the UAE, all from the Bovidae family.\n\nThe Arabian Tahr (Arabitragus jayakari, Fig. 14.15) is a goat-like mammal, endemic to the Hajar Mountains of the UAE and Oman. It lives on steep slopes at higher elevations in small matriarchal groups, composed of adult females, sub-adult males and females as well as new-borns (Munton 1985). Adult males remain alone most of the year except during the mating season. The Arabian tahr has been brought close to extinction by over-hunting and poaching, and only few individuals still roam in a few locations of the mountains of UAE. It has probably vanished from Wadi Wurayah National Park, which used to be one of the strongholds for the UAE population. The last individual was photographed by camera trapping in 2012 (Judas 2016).\n\nTwo species of gazelles can be found in UAE: the Arabian Mountain Gazelle (Gazella arabica) and the Arabian Sand Gazelle (Gazella marica, Fig. 14.16). The taxonomy of these two species is quite complex and has been the subject of many debates and publications in the last few decades (Lerp et al. 2013). From the most recent genetic analyses, they are both now both considered as endemic species of the Arabian Peninsula. Both species have been subject to captive-breeding, transfers and releases in many parts of the country. It is now very difficult, if even possible, to know which populations are wild, translocated, or reintroduced. The Arabian Mountain Gazelle was previously considered a subspecies of the Mountain Gazelle (Gazella gazella), and lives in the Mountains and interior sand and gravel plains. They also used to leave in coastal plains, but have been extirpated from these heavily developed areas. Their favoured habitat coincides with the distribution of the Umbrella Thorn Acacia (Vachellia tortilis), that provides them food and shelter. The Arabian Sand Gazelle was considered a subspecies of the Asian Goitered Gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) up until 2010 (Wacher et al. 2010), and lives in sand dunes and gravel plains, but avoid rocky areas. They are mainly found in the Abu Dhabi western region, including deep in the Rub Al Khali desert, but they have also been reintroduced and kept in semi-captivity in Dubai.\n\nThe iconic Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx, Fig. 14.17) is the largest Ungulate found in UAE, weighing up to 70 kg. They live in sand dunes and inter-dunal gravel plains. All populations present in UAE are issued from captive-breeding and reintroduction programmes. Some few hundred animals are distributed among few protected areas of Dubai (Al Marmoum Protected Area) and Abu Dhabi (Umm Al Zoumoul Protected Area).\n\n2.6 Non-native Species\n\nHuman activities and development have brought their share of non-native species to UAE, intentionally or accidentally. Some of these species have established viable populations, and have become invasive (an invasive species is a non-native species that causes harm to the environment, human health, the economy, etc). Others introduced species that survive, might breed several consecutive years when conditions are suitable, and eventually vanished when conditions become too challenging. Due to the harsh arid environment, few non-native species manage to thrive in the natural environment of UAE, particularly if they are not originating from a region with similar environmental conditions. However, they can adapt to live in artificial habitats, such as farmlands and urbanized areas (see Chap. 23).\n\nThe presence of mice and rats is probably as old as human civilization (Auffray et al. 1990). Following people on their trade routes, these commensal invasive species travelled by ships among goods, establishing in harbours before spreading further into the countryside of new areas. Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus) and Black Rat (Rattus rattus) both occur in UAE, although their respective status and distribution is not well known. The Black Rat or House Rat is probably the most widespread, living in cities, gardens, parks, farms, where they eat from human food waste, crops, seeds and fruit. The Brown Rat, or Norwegian Rat is a larger species, more heavily built, that might prefer wide open spaces, such as labour camps or most frequented picnic areas. The House Mouse (Mus musculus) is present in nearly all human settlements, from city centres to villages and isolated farms, but can also be found in wilder habitats, such as scrublands and desert edges.\n\nHow the Northern Palm Squirrel (Funambulus pennantii, Fig. 14.18) made its way to UAE from its native range of western Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan) is unknown. We might guess that it has been imported in the pet trade, where some individuals managed to escape or may even have been intentionally released (Judas and Hellyer 2016). The first known record of this squirrel in the UAE comes from Al Hamrania farms (Ras-Al Khaimah) in January 2011, and few months later from Fujairah near a housing complex. Since then, records have multiplied, coming from a growing number of locations. The species is now widespread all over UAE, with records from all emirates in farmlands, parks, and gardens.\n\nOn the other hand, few individuals of Persian Squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), presumably originating from the pet trade, have subsisted in parks and gardens of Abu Dhabi between 1999 and 2003, before they appear to have disappeared (Hellyer and Aspinall 2005).\n\nA very healthy colony of Indian Desert Jird (Meriones hurrianae) was reported between 2008 and 2011 from farms in Ajban area, presumably these were escapees from local pet markets. This species, available in pet shops in the UAE, naturally occurs in Pakistan and northwest India in desert habitats. Being adapted to similar environmental conditions, the risk exists that they might extend their range and eventually compete with native Jirds.\n\nMore recently, another exotic species, the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum, Fig. 14.19), of South American origin, the second largest known rodent after the Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), made its appearance in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. This large rodent is a common species in zoological collections and undoubtedly found its way out from captivity. They can regularly be seen sleeping or eating grass in the middle of round-abouts at Al Qudra (Dubai Emirate). This species is not adapted to live in arid environment, although in the absence of his usual predators, like pumas, it can possibly survive in highly modified habitats with tree plantations, lawns and ponds.\n\nThe Indian Grey Mongoose, Herpestes edwardsii, was recorded in the northern emirates in the 1980s and two thought to have been this species were observed in Abu Dhabi in 1985 and 1988, although the lack of recent records may indicate that the species has failed to establish a viable self-sustaining population.\n\nThe Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis was introduced on Jebel Hafit (Al Ain, Abu Dhabi) in the 1990s, and a small population has been persisting until today around a water source. The species is also well represented on Sir Bani Yas.\n\nBarbary Sheep or Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) is endemic to mountains across North Africa. It is kept in captivity in several private collections in the UAE, and some individuals have been released or escaped in Hatta area (Dubai). The species has also been reported from Jebel Hafit, Wadi Kub (Fujairah), and Wadi Shawka (Ras Al Khaimah). This species, well-adapted to live in arid mountains, might well survive in the Hajar Mountains, and become a competitor and threat to the native Arabian Tahr.\n\nFeral species are another category of non-native species present in UAE. These species were once domesticated either for their meat, used to carry people and material, or as pets. Goats (Fig. 14.20) have been kept by villagers for centuries. Following rain, when the dry slopes of the Hajar Mountains turn green, it is not rare for shepherds to let their livestock pasture freely for several days or weeks. This practise might have been entertained for a long time, and it is unsurprising that some goats might have escaped into the wild. Feral populations have settled well, and are now widespread all over the Hajar Mountains.\n\nAnother feral group, donkeys (Fig. 14.21), used to carry goods and material on steep paths in wadis, although they became less useful when motorized vehicles appeared in the UAE. Some have probably been abandoned, left to their sad fate. They learned to survive in the wild and are now widespread through the Hajar Mountains. Unlike goats, less agile, they canâ€™t access the steepest parts of the mountains, and limit their movements to lower elevation, or areas relatively easy to access. Among other vegetal material they consume, donkeys eat the bark of some native trees (Moringa peregrina for instance), seriously damaging them, and compromising their growth and survival.\n\nCamels have for a long time been left to free-range and feed in desert areas. Although this practise is increasingly controlled and regulated, they have largely contributed to overgrazing in most areas of the country. Camels are presumed to be native to Arabia (Thompson 2015), although wild populations no longer exist; neither are there any feral populationsâ€”all camels encountered are domestic animals.\n\nCats and dogs have also established feral populations throughout UAE, presumably as abandoned, lost, or escaped pets. Dogs mainly remain in proximity of human settlements where they can find or beg for food. They often live in small clans of a dozen or more individuals and are particularly attracted by landfills. They do not venture far into natural habitats. On the contrary, feral cats are solitary, and although well represented in and around cities and villages, they also venture quite deep in natural habitats, being sometimes observed kilometres away from the nearest habitations, deep in the desert or in mountain wadis. Feral cats have important negative effects on the native fauna, predating on small rodents, birds and reptiles.\n\n2.7 Potential Species"
