        "text": "Text by Héctor Sánchez (UABC), Yael Schoeppe (UDLAP), Leticia Marisol Talavera (UNAM) and Iamania Vergara (UDLAP)\n\nPhotos by Alan Harper, Antonieta Valenzuela and Terra Peninsular\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article was translated by Antonieta Valenzuela\n\nMammals are vertebrate animals that,due to their adaptations, have been able to establish in the most diverse ecosystems in the world (Sánchez-Cordero et al., 2014). In addition to this, mammals are a fundamental link in the food chain, both human and animal, and therefore, are elementary to maintain the balance of ecosystems (IUCN, 2009).\n\nMexico ranks third worldwide for mammal diversity, behind countries such as Indonesia and Brazil. Of the 535 species described in Mexico, 488 are terrestrial, of which 164 are endemic and 47 are marine species (CONABIO, 2009). Particularly in Baja California there are 84 species of mammals (Guevara et al., 2016).\n\nDue to the above, it is considered important to have a broad knowledge of mammals, and based on this knowledge find the best schemes for its management and conservation. With the aim of knowing a little more about the mammals of the nature reserves protected by Terra Peninsular, as a team we conducted field work based on indirect methods such as fingerprinting and placement of trap cameras, as well as direct methods such as rodent sampling with Sherman traps. These traps were placed before sunset and later collected at dawn. To handle rodents, we adhered to the good practices of the American Association of Mastozoology (ASM) and giving priority to the integrity of organisms. Once captured, we collected data: weight, total length, ear size, hind leg and tail length.\n\nIn all the reserves, trap cameras were systematically placed and subsequently dismantled to check the material obtained. The placement of the cameras was done during walking routes, however, the most interesting place to install the cameras was the Valle Tranquilo Nature Reserve; we had to make an excursion on horseback due to the extension of the reserve and the need of traveling long distances. In total we made a 6 mile ride on horseback and installed 7 trap cameras.\n\nMexico ranks third worldwide for mammal diversity, behind countries such as Indonesia and Brazil.\n\nDuring the walking routes to place cameras in all the reserves, traces were identified and with the help of plaster and water, molds were taken for each trace for later identification. Additionally, mammal feces were observed. With the help of identification guides it was possible to determine the species for each of the traces.\n\nThe results obtained were very diverse and gave us interesting data about each area. Within the reserves we can find different species such as the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and the kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans and Dipodomys merriami). One of the most important results from this investigation was the capture of some individuals of the San Quintín kangaroo rat (Dipodomys gravipes), as well as the San Diego pocket mouse (Chaetodipus fallax) and the little desert pocket mouse (Chaetodipus arenarius).\n\nImportant results were also obtained in the three reserves using trap cameras. In the case of the Punta Mazo Nature Reserve, a stable population of coyotes (Canis latrans) was registered for the first time. Adults and puppies were identified in the Monte Ceniza Nature Reserve where individuals of this species were photographed. The Valle Tranquilo Nature Reserve was the site that gave us the most significant results, since we obtained a picture of puma (Puma concolor), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and also coyote (Canis latrans).\n\nThe traces obtained in the reserves were coyote and at least one gray fox, which will remain within the Terra Peninsular collection as study material. Finally, the estimation of hares and rabbits is a precedent for later work; this is important because it is a fact that is unknown within the reserves.\n\nThe extension of the three reserves is a wonderful set of information of which we still know little, all you need is to walk a few feet to find traces, feces or traces of the passage of an animal, and so begin to ask a thousand questions about what is happening and what else we can know, hence the importance of this type of work.\n\nFinally, the work done had a positive impact on the protection and conservation of mammals, since little by little and with the efforts of different people and institutions it is possible to obtain results that contribute to the knowledge of the species found in the region. It is necessary to first know to conserve. We know that with our modest effort we have managed to contribute to the increase of knowledge of mammals in the reserves protected by Terra Peninsular.\n\nReferences\n\n●Guevara- Carrizales, A.A., Ruizcampos, G., Escobar-Flores, J. & Martínez Gallardo, M.
