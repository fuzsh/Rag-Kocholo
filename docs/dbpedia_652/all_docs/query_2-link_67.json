        "text": "The giant manta ray is a migratory species and seasonal visitor along productive coastlines with regular upwelling, in oceanic island groups, and near offshore pinnacles and seamounts. The timing of these visits varies by region and seems to correspond with the movement of zooplankton, current circulation and tidal patterns, seasonal upwelling, seawater temperature, and possibly mating behavior.\n\nAlthough the giant manta ray tends to be solitary, they aggregate at cleaning sites and to feed and mate. Manta rays primarily feed on planktonic organisms such as euphausiids, copepods, mysids, decapod larvae, and shrimp, but some studies have noted their consumption of small and moderately sized fish as well. When feeding, mantas hold their cephalic fins in an “O” shape and open their mouths wide, creating a funnel that pushes water and prey through their mouth and over their gill plates. Manta rays use many different types of feeding strategies, such as barrel rolling (doing somersaults over and over again) and creating feeding chains with other mantas to maximize prey intake.\n\nGiant manta rays also appear to exhibit a high degree of plasticity or variation in terms of their use of depths within their habitat. During feeding, giant manta rays may be found aggregating in shallow waters at depths less than 10 meters. However, tagging studies have also shown that the species conducts dives of up to 200 to 450 meters and is capable of diving to depths exceeding 1,000 meters. This diving behavior may be influenced by season and shifts in prey location associated with the thermocline.\n\nNOAA Fisheries and our partners conduct various research activities on the biology, behavior, and ecology of the giant manta ray. Our partners include federal agencies and nonprofit organizations. The results of this research are used to inform management decisions and enhance our understanding of this threatened species.\n\nTracking Giant Manta Ray Movements\n\nOur research partnership includes four related movement tracking projects to inform population structure and environmental drivers of movement for giant manta rays. The four projects are unique in their locations, involve some overlapping partnerships, and will be combined into a single analytical framework to improve our understanding of manta ray distribution, abundance, population connectivity, life history, response to environmental drivers, and duration of exposure to potential anthropogenic stressors throughout the northwestern Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSoutheast Florida\n\nResearchers with NOAA Fisheries and the Marine Megafauna Foundation are working together to place satellite and acoustic tags on manta rays in south Florida. Scientists with the Marine Megafauna Foundation have recently described this area as a possible juvenile nursery habitat for giant manta rays. The team has successfully tagged numerous juvenile manta rays and the tags are programmed to stay on for up to six months – both satellite and acoustic tags are very carefully attached by scientists using techniques that are as minimally invasive as possible.\n\nWatch a video of a giant manta ray that was tagged by researchers. This tag will allow us to track the movements of this juvenile giant manta ray.\n\nCoastal Louisiana\n\nNOAA Fisheries and the Marine Megafauna Foundation conducted boat-based surveys in coastal Louisiana with specific focus on the Mississippi delta region. A recent study published by NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners indicates that giant manta rays may congregate in the Mississippi delta region during specific times of the year - suggesting that this is an important aggregation site. These findings are further supported by the numerous public sighting reports and fisheries bycatch data. With further study and the deployment of satellite and acoustic tags on giant manta rays in this study area, we hope to better understand their spatiotemporal distribution, habitat use, and site fidelity in the Mississippi Delta region.\n\nMexican Yucatan\n\nNOAA Fisheries scientists teamed up with partners from the Mexican Caribbean Manta Project, Manta Trust, and El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) on giant manta ray research efforts off Isla Mujeres, Mexico. The Mexican Caribbean Manta Protect has been studying the giant manta ray populations in four different Marine Protected Areas off the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula since 2013. This is a highly productive area where giant manta rays aggregate to feed on zooplankton. Researchers are working to tag and collect genetic samples from the manta rays in this region. Data derived from this collaborative effort will help inform the connectivity between giant manta rays in the southern Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean with the northern Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of the United States.\n\nReducing Bycatch\n\nThrough our work with Manta Trust, we have supported research to assess the effects of fishing gear and fishing practices on manta ray survivorship. Off Indonesia, scientists are using a special kind of satellite tag to assess post-release mortality of mobulids, including giant manta rays, after being caught in gillnets by artisanal fisheries. Results from this research can be used to develop standards for manta ray bycatch reduction and safe release practices, and inform management measures at a national and international level.\n\nTissue Sampling\n\nSmall tissue samples are collected during tagging or capture for genetic analysis. Genetics are useful in understanding population structure, diversity within the population, and genetic exchange between populations. For example, we are collecting genetic samples to help us determine whether there is movement and genetic exchange among giant manta rays in the Atlantic and in the Gulf of Mexico. We are also collecting tissue samples from mobula rays incidentally caught by fisheries operating in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico to determine species composition and investigate genetic stock structure. Tissue samples are less than 0.5 oz and collected by scientists and trained fishery observers using non-invasive methods.\n\nGear Modification\n\nGiven that fishing mortality is the main threat to the species, NOAA Fisheries is funding studies to explore bycatch mitigation methods to decrease the number of interactions between fishing gear and giant manta rays. One such study is currently testing the efficacy of bycatch sorting grids to quickly and accurately sort and release mobula rays from purse seine vessels operating in the Pacific. Reducing the handling time of manta rays when caught by fishing vessels can help decrease post-release mortality rates. For this study, NOAA is partnering with the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF), in collaboration with researchers from the University of California at Santa Cruz, AZTI research institute, industry partner American Tunaboat Association, and U.S. purse seine vessel owners.\n\nCitizen Science and Reporting\n\nBy reporting sightings of giant manta rays, members of the public can help researchers gather valuable data on distribution patterns and habitat use.\n\nPlease report manta ray sightings to manta.ray@noaa.gov. To the extent possible, please include the following information: When and where did you see the manta? How big was it? What condition was it in (e.g., any injuries or unusual behavior)? Photos are also helpful and can be used to identify individual manta rays.\n\nThe collection of manta ray sighting information is authorized under the OMB Control Number included in the Citizen Science & Crowdsourcing Information Collection page. This information helps inform recovery efforts for this threatened species."
