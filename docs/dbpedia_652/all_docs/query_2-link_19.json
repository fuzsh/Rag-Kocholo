        "text": "The real temperature was not so great, perhaps 83°F (28°C), but the humidity and the still air in the forest made it seem hotter. I took large, slow strides, my toes instinctively trying to grip the slippery, steep slope through my sandals, my sleeves rolled down to keep the constant flow of sweat from dripping down my arms onto my camera bag. A bandanna looped around my neck served as a towel to mop sweat from my face, sweat that stung my eyes, sweat that was so prodigious that it felt like the inside of my mouth was sweating.\n\nBird calls, the occasional ululating call of a gibbon, and the clicks and whirrs of numerous insects surrounded us. Despite the fecund richness of the forest around us the only animal life to be seen were insects, most obviously large butterflies, predominately black in color, some with large yellow patches, others with cerulean blue patches, many with white polka-dots scattered over their wings. In the warm air they rarely stood still, preferring to dance in the solitary shafts of sunlight and flit erratically through the trees.\n\nOn the forest floor, amongst the leaf litter crawled the occasional giant woodlouse, relatives of common pillbug but far larger. They would curl at the slightest provocation, looking like painted ping-pong balls.\n\nWe were looking for wild orangutan in the hills of Lubuk Baji. We knew they were in the area, abandoned sleeping nests in the trees and their pungent scent attested to their recent presence but they remained hidden in the forest.\n\nLubik Baji is a small hill on the west side of Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. This large park is one of the last remaining protected lowland forests and contains nearly 10% of the world’s remaining orangutan. The nearby town of Sukadana is partially surrounded by the park and a large number of people live nearby, many of them relying on resources found within the park for their livelihoods, especially timber resources.\n\nWe had seemingly missed our chance to see these large forest dwelling primates, perhaps arriving too late in the day. Our guide kept a close eye out and several times pulled us off the trail through small tangles of spiky rattan palm to follow up on potential sightings and sounds. Each turned out to be a false alarm.\n\nWandering off the trail brought its own rewards though.\n\nWhere the ground was a bit more damp large white ground orchids grew, the broad, soft leaves looking more lilly-like than orchid like.\n\nThe tree above was fruiting directly from the trunk. This is a trait called cauliflory. Plants that exhibit cauliflory flower and fruit directly from their stems and trunks. It is relatively common in tropical environments and rare to non-existent elsewhere. I have seen it on many plants in the Amazon, but the fruit growing in this manner that most people will be familiar with is papaya. I think it is one of the most striking and beautiful ways for a tree to flower, in part because it is so unexpected.\n\nI have heard several hypotheses for why tropical trees do this; one has to do with sun protection for delicate flowers and fruits. Tropical sun is intense and the trees may be protecting their fruits under a dark canopy. Another thought is that it makes the fruit easier for large animals to reach as they do not have to rick precarious trips onto thin branches that may not hold their weight. One side effect of this growth form is that trees can produce fruits of immense size. Jackfruit (Artocarpus spp), a delicious fruit of which there are many species, produces some of the largest fruits of any tree, the largest fruits weighing up to 80 pounds (36 kilos).\n\nFailing to see any wild primates we continued our hike along the ridge to an overlook of bare granite shaded by a grove of tall bamboo.\n\nFrom here we finally got an overview of the surrounding countryside. Views like this can be surprisingly rare in forested lands, even when there are hills and mountains. Below us rice paddies infringed on the edge of the national park, then faded into a shaggy carpet of greenery. Here and there eskers of logging tracks could be seen following stream courses and through binoculars it was clear that all the tall trees had been cleared from the lower slopes of the distant hills.\n\nWe sat enjoying the breeze and view for a time, then headed back to the stream and park building for lunch.\n\nI grew restless and maybe 15 minutes before we were to set out I told the guide that I would go first and wait for the rest of the group later on. Walking in nature in large groups always bothers me a bit, too many people talk too loudly, make too much noise moving through the forest, and scare off the wildlife. I tend to walk slowly and quietly with frequent pauses to listen, look, and smell the air.\n\nAs it has so many times in the past my slow approach to nature paid off in spades. Just downhill from the honey gathering tree I saw a large branch move across the stream and head a loud rustle, clearly not from the wind. I froze and waited, watching the closely. Large dark shapes clambered about, difficult to see, sometimes in deep shade, other times so strongly backlit by the sun that all I could see was a dark blob.\n\nI waited with my camera out. After a few minutes of quiet waiting the orangutan began moving about, foraging and breaking off large dead limbs. I waited until they seemed accustomed to my presence, then slipped back up the trail to wait for the rest of my hiking group. Five minutes later they came down the trail, talking and breaking dead branches on the ground. “Shhh, tiga orangutan,” I said holding up 3 fingers. Everyone fell silent and we crept down the hill.\n\nThe orangutan watched us for a few minutes, then returned to foraging. One adolescent clambered directly over us, occasionally peering down through the sheltering leaves, then moving on again.\n\nMost of my photos did not turn out well, the contrast was too great and the apes moved too quickly. After much post processing one image revealed that there were at least 4 orangutan, possibly more nearby.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes we continued on our way down the hill, pausing to swim in a deliciously refreshing pool at the base of a waterfall.\n\nRegretfully donning our clothes once more we continued our hike out of the forest, happy at seeing the orangutan and thinking that out wildlife sights were at an end.\n\nJust inside the margin of the forest we found that we were unexpectedly and happily wrong.\n\nSeveral Red Leaf Monkeys were foraging for fruit in the semi-wild durian orchard. They made long, graceful leaps between the trees, their tails streaming out behind them, accenting the arc of their flight.\n\nPeople often think we need to protect the forest in order to protect species like the orangutan, various monkey species, birds, and other forest inhabitants. While this is indeed true, it is only part of the picture. The forest denizens must be protected as well because without them the forest changes, sometimes radically, becoming a completely different environment.\n\nMany species of plants require their seeds to be consumed along with their fruit and carried far off as part of their dispersal strategy. Many seeds must pass through the digestive tracts of specific animals before they will germinate. The extinction of one animal species can have repercussions that are slow to manifest, are difficult to reverse, and may have a wider impact through the ecosystem.\n\nWe often talk of specific species as being keystone species. It may be wiser to think of all species as being keystone species.\n\nI am back on the West Coast of the US for a few weeks before I fly off into tomorrow sometime in November. The specific part of the west coast I am in is the Santa Monica Mountains, a rugged stretch of steep sided hills perched over the Pacific Ocean covered with blanket of dense chaparral.\n\nThe precipitous, heavily weathered mountain slopes are eroding from ancient sea-floor uplifted and broken by geologic stresses, frequently manifesting in the form of earthquakes. The region is dry, though fog is common and periodic rainstorms can quickly drench the area, causing local flooding and landslides. The dusty ground is colored a dull orange/tan with angular, flat, broken pebbles peeling out of shallow, soft bedrock with occasional anemonite and bivalve fossils. Under the twelve foot chaparral canopy the gritty soil is overlain by several inches of slowly decomposing leaf-litter and twigs, loose in some places, held together by dense mycelial mats in other places, particularly under the scrub and live oaks.\n\nInfrequent damp, cool places are home to massive coastal live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) while a bewildering variety of woody shrubs make up the body of the chaparral cloaking the rest of the mountains. Here and there small meadows, potreros in the southern California vernacular, and wind-blasted rock outcrops break up the gray/green vegetation.\n\nChamise, Toyon, Scrub Oak, Lemonade Berry, Ceanothus, Yucca, and various sages make up much of the more common large shrubs with Black Walnut, Elderberry, Coastal Live Oak, and California Sycamore making up the primary larger trees. The softer vegetative plants of the understory tend be short-lived, only appearing to bloom and set seed after the rain.\n\nThe thick, leathery leaves of the Lemonade Berry (Rhus integrifolia) in the image above are fairly typical of chaparral plants in that they are mostly evergreen and have evolved to husband moisture. Some plants steal their nutrients from other plants, Dodder (Cuscuta californica) is common in the chaparral, some years blanketing their hosts with yellow-orange leafless vines sporting nearly invisible flowers.\n\nFor such a dry region the diversity of both plant and animal life is astounding. The most obvious animal life during the day are the birds. Birds of all sizes everywhere, year round. Little tiny acrobatic birds such as the Bushtit traveling in small noisy flocks.\n\nLarge birds of prey soaring overhead in search of thermals or their next meal.\n\nMeadowlarks, finches, wrens, thrashers, scrub jays, woodpeckers, hummingbirds quail, and a host of other birds flit about within earshot, if not within eyesight.\n\nMammals abound as well. Small rabbits scatter like frogs in a pond in the evenings, and in the mornings I find fresh coyote, fox, bobcat, skunk, raccoon, deer, and mountain lion tracks on the unused dirt roads. In the potreros badgers are not uncommon, large woodrat piles abound, bats fly through the canyons in the evening, and ground squirrels are everywhere. Sometimes, if you have a quiet foot, a lot of patience, and good deal of luck you sneak up on these animals. A few years back I was out here and found a coyote sleeping in the sunlight.\n\nThis being a dry area there are numerous lizards and snakes, mostly hidden from sight, and insects of all sorts.\n\nI prefer wet places, places that stay green, but I do appreciate and enjoy the diversity of life here in the steep chaparral. It is strange to be here between damp New England and my next home in Borneo where I will receive 3-4 meters of rain a year.\n\n* * * *** * * *\n\nSome of these photos are taken with a Nikon D80, some with a Nikon D90, and several with a Nikon D600. I am still learning the latter camera, but if any of you out there are debating buying the D600, I can honestly say I recommend it. The Meadowlark and Hummingbird images were taken with the D600 and are cropped from much larger images.\n\nLawns. I am not a big fan of them. I love meadows, or even lightly tended fields.\n\nI prefer to have a yard rather than a lawn, that flat expanse of close trimmed grass we call a lawn has never been all that appealing to me. A “yard” does not carry the implication of maintenance that a “lawn” implies. Lawns are an integral part of American life though, and are found even in places completely unsuited to their presence. In some areas neighborhood associations mandate how your lawn must look, what you can and can’t have on it, and, in extreme cases, what shade of green it must be and how many inches tall it must be.\n\nThere are many theories behind why lawns exist, some people claim that it is a relict of animal husbandry, particularly sheep and how a grazed landscape looks. Others claim that it taps into some deep species memory of living on a savanna, that the flat, open land is visually soothing and provides a sense of safety and removal from danger and the unknown. Some claim that lawns are a symbol of our control over nature, our own private, manufactured landscapes.\n\nThe most interesting idea I’ve heard for the prevalence of lawns in the US is in Charles C. Mann’s excellent book 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. He suggests that wide, expansive lawns may have been an anti-malaria survival strategy. A house on a rise on the landscape with cleared land around it would catch the breeze and prevent malaria carrying mosquitoes from getting into the house. Lawns became embedded in the social consciousness of the emerging United States and spread with the population, as symbolic as the flag or fireworks, though more subtle and having greater practical value. It is an interesting idea and makes as much, or more, sense as any other idea concerning lawns that I have read.\n\nWhat bothers me about lawns is that they tend to be uniform monocrops with little three-dimensional texture. This lack of diversity limits what wildlife visits a lawn, and I, as an ecologist and someone who is always investigating things, love diversity. My yard here in Vermont is diverse, but my landlord likes a short lawn and cuts it down to an inch or two in height. Every time he does so all the insects, birds, and mammals flee, taking weeks to return. I like all those mobile visitors.\n\nOne of the visitors to my lawn is a plump woodchuck (Marmota monax). It only crosses the road to my lawn when the vegetation reaches 6-8 inches, then it visits nearly every evening and some mornings a well. This rotund fellow is wary and alert, standing up and peering about at the slightest out of place sound.\n\nThe name Woodchuck is actually a derivative of a Native American name wuchak, and has nothing to do with either wood or chucking, despite generations of woodchuck chucking wood tongue-twisters.\n\nWoodchucks, also known as Groundhogs, Land-Beavers, and, my favorite, Whistle-Pigs are marmots, large rodents related to ground squirrels. Most of the marmot family are alpine dwellers, commonly found in high grassy places from Europe to Asia and through North America, but the woodchuck is a lowland species wide-spread in the northeastern and central United States, and through Canada up to Alaska. Like other marmots woodchucks have a piercing alarm call, a sharp whistle that carries far, sometimes with a bit of a burbling quality to it.\n\nMost often a woodchuck will appear as a furry lump on the grass, something like a cross of a loaf of bread, a caterpillar, and a fat otter pretending to be a cat. Many people have a particular dislike for woodchucks because they eat garden vegetables and ornamental plants. A good friend of mine has been driven to distraction by one that is eating her hydrangeas. The one that visits my lawn (but only when it has not been cut for a while) eats the dandelions and fleabane, basically weeding the yard for me.\n\nDuring the spring, summer, and fall woodchucks pile on as much fat as they can, much like small bears. Come winter they retreat to a specially dug winter burrow to hibernate. Marmots are some of the few animals that enter true hibernation. They radically slow all their metabolic processes and remain oblivious to the world until mating time, often beginning in February or March, possibly later the further north they live.\n\nWoodchucks have marvelously thick and soft fur, as do other marmots. I have a hat I bought in western China with a marmot fur ruff that is too warm for me to wear in nearly any weather. Despite putting on a tremendous amount of fat their flesh is lean, most of the fat is in a subcutaneous layer, just beneath the skin, with the rest stored in the body cavity between the internal organs.\n\nWoodchucks are the most solitary of marmots and are said to be aggressive. They can be hand raised to be cuddly, but it takes a great deal of effort to overcome their feisty nature.\n\nSurprisingly, woodchucks are reputed to be agile climbers in an emergency, though I have yet to see one scale a tree. Most often what I see is one popping up to look about:\n\nFollowed by a rapid retreat if I am not careful, quiet, and slow moving:\n\nI like this occasional visitor to my yard, and, given the option, do not mow my lawn as if I do it will not come by to visit.\n\n* * *** * *\n\nA note: my posts may become a bit erratic for a few months, I am in the midst of finishing one job, moving (maybe twice), and will hopefully be beginning a new job in a different country. Eventually this will provide great material for the ongoing exploration of nature, but the route there may be a little irregular and unpredictable. Bear with it, I will not abandon my writing and photography.\n\nHe [Raven] looked about and thought there was nothing on the land as lively as the fish in the water, so he made the shrew-mice, for he said, “They will skip about and enliven the ground and prevent it from looking dead and barren, even if they are not good for food.” – from Clara Bayliss’s 1909 collection A Treasury of Eskimo Tales.\n\nCreation myths aside, our early mammalian ancestors were little omnivorous insectivores very much like modern shrews. Mammals evolved some 200 million or so years ago and lived alongside the dinosaurs, but did not grow to large size until millions of years after the dinosaurs went extinct some 65 million years ago.\n\nToday we are a diverse group of flying, swimming, and running creatures ranging in size from the blue whale 120 feet long with a heart the size of a small car down to shrews no more than a few inches long, weighing less than an ounce. We don’t know much about our early ancestors, small terrestrial creatures rarely leave fossil remains, but from what we can tell it seems that the shrew body design and hunting strategy is extremely successful and has remained a persistent mammalian body plan.\n\nShrew-like creatures live all over the world and are renowned for their ferocity, appetite, boldness, and their unusual (at least in mammals) venomous bite. Here in Vermont the shrew you are most likely to encounter is the Northern Short-Tailed Shrew (Blarina brevicauda). As near as I can make out, Blarina roughly translates to “nose-necked” and brevicauda actually does mean “short-tailed”, making this one of the few animals that has a matching common and scientific name. Shrews are in the Soricidae family, which just means, “the shrew family.”\n\nShrews move rapidly, driven by their rapid metabolism and resulting need to eat constantly. They move with a peculiar blend of short, jerky twitches and weasel-like fluidity. The shrew in the photos was hunting for insects and earthworms in freshly cut grass. I followed it for perhaps 200 feet, and during that time it only stopped to sniff out prey, to eat it, and to hide from the dog that wanted to know what I was watching so avidly.\n\nLike many predators, shrews are curious, engaging in high risk, high reward activities. Their eyesight is poor, but their sense of smell is excellent. How good their hearing is seems to be uncertain, some people thinking it is good, others poor. I suspect that it is pretty good and that they are sensitive to vibrations via their whiskers and feet.\n\nUnlike many animals the shrew had no fear of me what-so-ever, not even flinching when I stroked its back as it ate one of the 4 earthworms it caught while I was watching. Every small animal nearby, on the other hand, was terrified of the shrew. Insects froze into immobility, antennae twitching and heads slowly tracking as the shrew passed by. Well should these creatures be wary of the shrew. If a shrew goes more than a few hours without eating it will starve to death.\n\nShort-Tailed shrews are tiny, massing between 2 and 5 US quarters (about .5 to 1 ounce), but they are perfectly capable of killing and eating prey several times their size. There is a 3 minute National Geographic TV video of a shrew exploring a garden, then killing and eating a garter snake much larger than itself. Most of the time shrews will content themselves with insects, worms, and seeds.\n\nShrew fur is thick and dense, like the fur of an otter, but lacking the oily guard hairs. The fur is so dense that it is waterproof, allowing some species of shrew to hunt underwater. Shrews need this dense fur to keep warm through the winter. Their small size means they lose heat quickly, necessitating both a rapid metabolism and good insulation. In winter they remain beneath the snow as much as possible, eating cached food, keeping activity to a minimum, and burning brown adipose tissue (what we commonly call “brown fat”) to keep warm without resorting to shivering.\n\nThey have as many predators as they have prey, but their venom and unpleasant musk helps to keep some mammalian predators at bay.\n\nShrews are tremendously strong for their size. I could see the back and neck muscles bulging as this shrew pulled earthworms from the soil. It pulled a short section of the worm from the ground and ate it, pulled another short bit, ate that, and continued, as though it was eating Twizzlers at the movies.\n\nWe humans are proud of our accomplishments, but perhaps we should be more humble before the little shrew. This tiny creature, so easily killed by a careless foot is upholding 200 million years of successful mammalian tradition, wearing a body design that gave rise to all other mammals from humans to whales, bats to elephants, beavers to monkeys."
