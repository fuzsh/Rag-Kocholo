        "text": "A species can be a mammal, a tree, a coral, a fungus, an insect, a sponge or any one of a number of life forms.\n\nThey can be found in near-to boiling water, sulphurous sludge, frozen wastelands, underground rivers, spiny forests, perilous cliffs or living almost all their life in mid-air.\n\nTogether we and they make up life on this planet.\n\nAnd altogether we call this range and breadth of life 'biodiversity'.\n\nWWF's mission is make sure we don't lose this marvellous array of life, this biodiversity.\n\nHow much diversity of life is on this Earth?\n\nAccording to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature), humans know about an estimated 1,562,663 different life forms on this planet. This includes:\n\n5,416 mammals\n\n16,000 mushrooms or fungi\n\n29,300 fish\n\n950,000 insects\n\n287,655 plants\n\nMany experts feel we have still to discover many, many more species - some estimates say we have yet to discover and describe millions of 'new' lifeforms.\n\nOf the 1.5 million species, what needs saving?\n\nThe IUCN maintains the red list, which lists 16,118 endangered species.\n\nWhat does Endangered mean?\n\nOfficially, threatened species are those listed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU).\n\nPractically this means:\n\nCritically Endangered (CR): A species facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nEndangered (EN): A species considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.\n\nVulnerable (VU): A species considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild."
