        "text": "Discussion\n\nWith regard to the urinary system, the kidneys of many marine animals are specialized in reniculate form (multi-lobed), with each lobe (renula) having all the components of a complete metanephric kidney (Vardy & Bryden, 1981). Although it is unknown why marine animals have reniculate kidneys, the fact that some large terrestrial mammals also have reniculate kidneys has led to speculation that they represent an adaptation that is associated with their enormous body size (Williams, 2006). The kidneys of marine animals are frequently larger than those of terrestrial mammals of comparable body mass (Beuchat, 1996). Both the dugong and the manatee are marine mammals (Berta, Sumich & Kovacs, 2015). Furthermore, unlike manatees, dugongs appear to be physiologically independent of fresh water (Berta, Sumich & Kovacs, 2015). That could be why dugong kidneys differ from manatee kidneys (Berta, Sumich & Kovacs, 2015).\n\nFurthermore, the kidney of the dugong differs from all other marine mammals in that its kidneys were non-lobular and smoothly elongated on the exterior, resulting in a long medullary crest and implying some type of transverse medullary lobulated kidney (Ca, 2002). This kidney structure is similar to that of camels (Abdalla & Abdalla, 1979), horses (Bolat et al., 2013), swine (Sampaio, Pereira-Sampaio & Favorito, 1998), and humans (Wallace, 1998). Dugong kidneys, on the other hand, were both grossly and microscopically different from elephant kidneys (Maluf, 1995) and all other marine mammals, including manatees (Maluf, 1989), leopard seals (Gray, Canfield & Rogers, 2006), pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) (Stewardson et al., 1999; Vardy & Bryden, 1981), and cetaceans (whales and dolphins) (Maluf & Gassman, 1998; Pfeiffer, 1997), all of which have externally lobulated or multi-reniculated kidneys. The remarkable differences in renal anatomy and histology observed across sirenians imply that these differences in kidney appearance may be attributed to differences in the habitats of each species (Ortiz, 2001).\n\nThe surface was covered with a thick and strong fibrous renal capsule consisting of collagen and elastic fibers that are thicker than they are in canines (Bulger, Cronin & Dobyan, 1979), Indian buffaloes (Ommer & Mariappa, 1970), and elephants (Maluf, 1995; Thitaram et al., 2018). The arcuate arteries were found at the cortico-medullary junction and included connective tissue and smooth muscle. Notably, this feature was similar to what has been reported in a previous study on the leopard seal (Cave & Aumonier, 1964). Furthermore, the cribriform area was flat or concave near the end of the renal papilla, which is an enlarged opening of papillary ducts to the renal pelvis. Accordingly, this feature is similar to that of both the pygmy hippopotamus (Maluf, 1994) and the elephant (Maluf, 1995; Thitaram et al., 2018).\n\nWith regard to the gastrointestinal system, the morphology and histomorphology of the dugong gastrointestinal tracts (stomach, duodenum, and duodenal diverticula) had previously been described by Kenchington (1972) and Murray et al. (1977). Their findings indicate that the dugong is a nonruminant herbivore. Microscopically, the structure of the gastrointestinal tracts of the dugong and the manatee (Reynolds & Krause, 1982; Reynolds & Rommel, 1996) exhibits significant similarities. The esophageal mucosa of the dugong is characterized by a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, resembling that of the elephant (Van Aswegen et al., 1994). In contrast, hind gut fermenters, such as horses, rabbits, and guinea pigs, typically possess a keratinized stratified squamous type of esophageal mucosa, while the degree of keratinization is known to be dependent upon the type of food ingested (Samuelson, 2007). Unlike the elephant esophagus, which contains numerous submucosal mixed glands secreting mucus to lubricate and protect the luminal surface (Thitaram et al., 2018), the dugong esophagus lacks submucosal glands. The stomach of the dugong is a simple mammalian stomach lined with glandular mucosa. Notably, the pyloric epithelium of the dugong lacks stratified squamous cells, which differentiates it from the Florida manatee. In terms of innervation and vascular supply, myenteric nerves and blood vessels are abundant in the muscularis externa of the dugong, albeit to a lesser extent than in the manatee (Reynolds & Rommel, 1996). Among the sections of the small intestine, the duodenum of the dugong closely resembles that of the manatee, another member of the order Sirenia (Reynolds & Krause, 1982). Furthermore, the ileum of the dugong exhibits numerous Peyer’s patches, a feature shared with other Sirenians and terrestrial mammals. The cytoarchitecture of the liver and pancreas in the dugong demonstrates a normal organization when compared with what has been observed in other terrestrial or marine mammals.\n\nWith regard to the cardiovascular system, a histological investigation of the cardiovascular system in the organs of dugongs was conducted to compare our outcomes with the findings of studies involving humans, other domestic mammals, and birds. As far as we know, no previous research has been conducted on the histological structure of the dugongs’ cardiovascular system. Previous studies have focused on the anatomical structure of the heart of the dugongs (Rowlatt & Marsh, 1985). In a histological study of the organs of dugongs, many organs were closely examined, but the heart, adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary glands were not examined (Woolford et al., 2015). In this study, the heart of the dugong could be divided into three layers consisting of the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium, which is similar to the hearts of humans, other domestic mammals, and birds (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020). Interestingly, we found that the epicardial layer of the dugong contained a thick layer of epicardial fat, or epicardial adipose tissue, that was composed of adipocytes, nerve tissue, and coronary vessels ( ). Moreover, the layer may also include immune cells (Iacobellis & Bianco, 2011). There are noticeable species-specific differences in epicardial adipose tissue; in healthy humans, it can cover up to 80% of the surface of the heart (Iacobellis et al., 2005) and account for 20% of the total ventricular weight, in contrast to rodents, where epicardial adipose tissue is almost absent (Corradi et al., 2004). The thickening of the epicardial adipose tissue might be related to many roles in cardiac physiology, such as the storage of free fatty acids (FFAs) as a source of energy for the heart, protection of the myocardium from high fatty acid levels and associated lipotoxicity, thermoregulation in heat production and protection of the heart against cold, mechanical protection of the heart and coronary arteries against the torsion of the arterial pulse wave and cardiac contraction, and immunological support by their immune cells that help to protect the heart against pathogens and inflammatory activators (Antonopoulos & Antoniades, 2017). Moreover, increased epicardial fat thickness has been found to be related to obesity, body mass index, the metabolic syndrome, and heart disease, which are characterized by inflammation, hypertension, and disturbances in insulin sensitivity (Wu et al., 2017).\n\nThe cardiac muscle microstructure of dugongs was similar to that of humans, other domestic mammals, and Asian elephants (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020; Thitaram et al., 2018; Zhang, 1999), but was mostly similar to the horse and Asian elephants in the way that their ventricles contained numerous groups of muscle fascicles ( ) (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020; Thitaram et al., 2018). Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated the space surrounding the cardiac muscle fibers in a cross sectional view ( ) and a longitudinal sectional view ( ). Importantly, there are a number of points of interest: (1) they could be fixation artifacts, cell shrinkage gaps left behind when the tissue was fixed in formalin or another fixative, or they could be areas where the tissue was somewhat pulled apart during sectioning; (2) at the time of tissue collection (Kachaeva & Shenkman, 2012); (3) this space consisted of an excessive accumulation of intercellular collagen networks and numerous capillary networks that could have been present due to the aging associated with myocardial collagen accumulation or fibrotic remodeling (Horn & Trafford, 2016); or (4) these could be the result of muscle atrophy (Aughey & Frye, 2001).\n\nThe Purkinje fibers of the dugong were distributed in the subendocardial connective tissue in the ventricle, similar to those of humans and other domestic mammals (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020; Zhang, 1999). Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that the microstructure of the dugongs’ Purkinje fibers were similar to that of humans and other domestic mammals (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020; Zhang, 1999). Intercalated discs at the junction of two fibers also resembled those of human and monkey Purkinje fibers (Zhang, 1999; Zhang et al., 1996). The histological findings stained with hematoxylin and eosin demonstrated that the microstructure of the dugongs’ blood vessels, including the coronary arteries and veins, small muscle arteries and veins, arterioles and venules, and continuous capillaries, were similar to those of humans and other domestic mammals (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Liebich, 2020; Zhang, 1999).\n\nThe limitations of the histological studies of the cardiovascular system naturally include the lack of some blood vessels, including the aorta, vena cava, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein; while the elastic artery, large vein, medium artery, and medium vein were not examined, respectively. The results of the current studies indicate that almost all of the cardiovascular organs of dugongs in this study had histological findings that were similar to those of other mammal species and birds, with the exception of the dugongs’ epicardial layer, which thickened more than that of other mammalian species and birds. These characteristics may have been linked since they are both marine mammals that live in cold water, and if their habitat is cold, it is crucial for thermoregulation—the process of producing heat and shielding the heart from the cold. Their neutrinos and metabolism may also play a role in this process.\n\nRegarding the reproductive system, aspects of the male dugong reproductive system have been described; however, a complete description of the microanatomy was not possible because the males in this study were juveniles and mature males. This study was conducted to investigate the reproductive system of male dugongs, but only testis organs were collected. Overall, the microanatomy revealed similarities to that of other species, such as the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) (Hernandez et al., 1995; Perez, 2015), African elephant (Loxodonta africana) (Short, Mann & Hay, 1967), and common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) (Murphy, Collet & Rogan, 2005). The tunica albuginea of most domestic mammals is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, with the exception of the stallion, boar, and ram, which are composed primarily of smooth muscle tissue (Bacha & Bacha, 2000). Dugong testes contained an inner layer of smooth muscle in the tunica albuginea, whereas this layer was located in the outer portion in the stallion (Bacha & Bacha, 2000). Thus, the structure of the dugong tunica albuginea more closely resembled that of domestic livestock species. Adult manatees have a thicker tunica layer than juveniles and calves (Perez, 2015), but because we only had juvenile testes with a complete tunica albuginea layer, but no mature males with a tunica albuginea layer, an evaluation of how the tunica albuginea may change with age was not possible. Thus, additional samples across age groups are needed to more fully understand testicular changes in dugongs. Peritubular myoid cells, which are the primary cellular components of the wall of seminiferous tubules and exhibit smooth muscle-like characteristics, have been identified in all mammalian species, although organization within the peritubular interstitial tissue varies among species (Maekawa, Kamimura & Nagano, 1996; Zhou et al., 2019). Similar to dugongs, laboratory rodents, including rats, hamsters, and mice, have only one layer of myoid cells in the testis (Preen, 1995). It is believed that myoid cells play an important role in the intratesticular transport of immobile sperm and so are integral to spermatogenesis (Zhou et al., 2019).\n\nInterstitial cells, or Leydig cells, are the primary source of androgens and play a crucial role in numerous vital physiological processes in males, such as sperm production, sexual development, and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and behaviors (Zhou et al., 2019). Previous studies have suggested that the gonadal activity of mature male dugongs is variable, so not all males in a given population produce spermatozoa continuously (Kwan, 2002; Marsh, 1995; Marsh, Heinsohn & Marsh, 1984). Male dugongs in the tropics were found to have spermatogenic testes mainly in the latter half of the year (austral winter to spring), which is consistent with a diffused breeding season (Kwan, 2002; Marsh, 1995; Marsh, Heinsohn & Glover, 1984). However, the timing of male reproductive cycles and the extent of inactivity have not been exhaustively studied, as only carcass analyses have provided information on individual males at the time of death. The spermatogenic cycle of dugongs is similar to that of Florida manatees, elephants, and hyraxes (Perez, 2015). While testicular function in both dugongs and manatees is influenced by season, these species are comparable in terms of the body length at which sexual maturity occurs (Perez, 2015). Any disparity could be due to species-specific differences in life history and genetics or could be linked to differences in resource availability and the stability of their native habitats.\n\nThe exact age and length of each dugong in this study was unknown, as only tissue samples were available, but it was presumed there were juvenile and mature male testis. This type of information provides important life history data that could have an impact on dugong captive management. Additional tissue analysis and other reproductive system organs are required, especially to better define sexual maturity age and how spermatogenic activity changes over time and with age. Future studies should also include testing hormone concentrations in the blood, feces, or urine in addition to analyzing functionality of the seminiferous tubules and associated cells. Controlling the spermatogenic cycle is largely dependent upon FSH and testosterone (Sharpe, Maddocks & Kerr, 1990), although stress can also have direct and indirect effects on testosterone production. Thus, it may be useful to evaluate correlations between testicular stage, testosterone, and glucocorticoid concentrations to better understand how to manage dugong reproduction. Finally, it is important to examine serial sections of testes, preferably from breeding-season carcasses, to determine if spermatogenic activity is uniform throughout the gonads (Hernandez et al., 1995).\n\nWith regard to the endocrine system (pancreas), the exocrine component of the pancreas was composed of numerous tubuloacinar secretory units. The purpose of this research study was to understand more about the male dugong’s endocrine system. Unfortunately, in this study, we could only use the pancreas organs obtained from these carcasses to identify this system. The endocrine islets of Langerhans (pancreatic islets) are clusters of epithelial cells that are dispersed throughout the secretory units (Bacha & Bacha, 2012; Eurell & Frappier, 2006). In addition to being organized into islets, the endocrine cells are scattered individually and in small clusters among the exocrine acini (Fowler & Mikota, 2006). The pancreas of the dugong is composed of exocrine and endocrine tissue and enclosed by a thin connective tissue capsule that is rich in adipose tissue, blood vessels, and fine collagen fibers. This feature is similar to that of other mammalian species such as the leopard seal, horse, cattle, donkey, and sheep (Gray, Canfield & Rogers, 2006; Hafez, Zaghloul & Caceci, 2015; Mahesh et al., 2017), as well as the gazelle (Hamza, 2018). The histological structure of the endocrine islets of the Langerhans in the dugong was similar to that of other mammals in that they are spherical or ellipsoid in shape and of varying overall size, with irregular shapes reflecting the pressure of an adjacent structure, often a duct, or were limited by a tissue plane (Gray, Canfield & Rogers, 2006; Hafez, Zaghloul & Caceci, 2015; Longnecker, 2021; Mahesh et al., 2017).\n\nThe pancreas regulates blood sugar concentrations, while isolated groups of pale-staining islet cells are dispersed throughout the secretory units. Histochemistry or transmission electron microscopy was used to distinguish four distinct cell types (Eurell & Frappier, 2006). The majority of cells were A, alpha cells that secrete glucagon (a polypeptide hormone secreted in response to hypoglycemia or growth hormone stimulation); or B, beta cells that secrete insulin into the bloodstream in response to a rise in concentration of blood glucose or amino acids. Rare D, or delta, cells that release somatostatin, while F cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide. These cells belong to the group responsible for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) (Aughey & Frye, 2001). Importantly, gap junctions join the islet cells to facilitate intercellular communication (Eurell & Frappier, 2006).\n\nComparable to other animal species, the endocrine pancreas of the dugong contained numerous types of secretory cells; however, in the H & E stained preparations, the cell types were indistinguishable, necessitating the use of special staining techniques. For example, autolytic and inadequately preserved pancreatic tissues prevented identification of endocrine components in Asian elephants (Thitaram et al., 2018). Dolphin islets are primarily formed of beta-cell cords that are dispersed throughout the islet. Few islets predominantly had beta-cells in their center cores (Colegrove & Venn-Watson, 2015). In comparison, a typical rat pancreas shows normal Langerhans islets with pale spherical and ovoid-beta cells in the center (Saad et al., 2015). As a result, future research must use specialized techniques such as immunohistochemistry to identify cell types in the pancreas of dugongs, while other organs in the endocrine system, including the thyroid gland and adrenal gland, should be collected to better understand endocrinology in dugongs.\n\nWith regard to the lymphatic system, the histology of the dugong spleen displayed no differences from the spleen of other mammals. The dense connective tissue capsule and trabeculae consisted of smooth muscle tissue, as well as elastic and collagen fibers. The splenic parenchyma was unable to be divided into a cortex/medulla structure like other lymphoid organs. However, it had two functionally different regions: red pulp and white pulp or the splenic follicle. Interestingly, the follicles of the dugongs in this study were much larger than the follicles of the Australian dugong, but a prominent germinal center or hyperplastic follicle were not observed (Woolford et al., 2015). The white pulp and red pulp were found all over the spleen including in the branch of the splenic microcirculation; trabecular vein and artery, and central arteries (Mescher, 2018).\n\nThe histological findings of the thymus taken from a dugong in this study was similar to the manatee (Goldbach, 2010) and other mammals (Cave & Aumonier, 1967; Igbokwe & Ezenwaka, 2017). The structural component of the thymus consisted of a connective tissue capsule, as well as a cortex, medulla, and Hassall’s corpuscles. The mammalian thymus is gradually replaced by connective and adipose tissue after age-related thymic involution (Igbokwe & Ezenwaka, 2017). However, a few fat invasions in the thymic parenchyma of the dugong were observed, which was in agreement with a study conducted on a dugong from Bahrein (Cave & Aumonier, 1967), suggesting a unique pattern of thymic involution in the dugong. In summary, the histology of the spleen in dugongs revealed no significant differences when compared with other mammalian spleens. Nevertheless, further studies are required to understand the functional significance of the unique thymic histology observed in dugongs.\n\nWith regarding to the muscular system, the overall histological structure of the muscular tissue of the dugong was similar to that of other marine mammals including cetaceans (Sierra et al., 2015; Suárez-Santana et al., 2020) and other closely related species, namely the manatee (Grossman, Hamilton & De Wit, 2014; Reynolds & Rommel, 1996), and the Asian elephant (Thitaram et al., 2018). In this study, the diameter of the visceral striated muscle found in the esophagus of the dugong was at the same size of the striated muscle in the body of the vocal cord of the Florida manatee by cross section in the histological study (Grossman, Hamilton & De Wit, 2014). In the previous study, the visceral striated muscle had also been found in the esophagus of the Asian elephant (Thitaram et al., 2018); however, minor differences were found when compared with the muscular tissue of the dugong in this study. Lesser values in the density and diameter of muscle fibers were observed in the Asian elephant’s esophagus, which was also the case for an elephant clave (Thitaram et al., 2018). This might be because of differences in the span of age, just as an increase in muscle fiber size, could commonly occur in older animals (Miljkovic et al., 2015).\n\nAlthough muscular tissue had been observed in many organs of the dugongs in this study, including the intestinal tract, kidney, heart and trachea, knowledge pertaining to the muscular tissue of the skeleton muscle that attaches to the tendon and bone from the limbs and the body core has still been limited in both morphological and histological studies, suggesting that this organ should be included in the further studies.\n\nWith regard to the respiratory system, the Dugong dugong and Dugong manatee are two species in the family of Sirenia. This study was conducted to investigate the respiratory structure of the Dugong dugong in comparison to other marine species, marine mammals, and terrestrial mammals by histological evaluation. We hypothesize that the respiratory adaptations for diving in dugongs are similar to those of other marine mammals (Pabst, Rommel & McLellan, 1999). It was found to be similar to the tracheal structure of certain marine mammals, such as dolphins, with their continuous cartilage rings and absence of trachealis muscle (Bagnoli et al., 2011). The trachea of dugongs was found to possess an incomplete cartilage ring and present a trachealis muscle that was similar to that of terrestrial mammals. The tracheal respiratory epithelium was pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with submucosal goblet cells. The bronchus structure had multi-plated hyaline cartilages that were similar to other terrestrial mammals. Surprisingly, the terminal bronchioles of the dugong appear to have a small amount of cartilage around the terminal bronchiole lumen. In a previous study of Sirenian, it was found that manatees are also reinforced with cartilage (Pabst, Rommel & McLellan, 1999). The terminal bronchiole cartilage structure indicated an increase in general resistance and stiffness in comparison with terrestrial mammals (Bagnoli et al., 2011). The respiratory epithelium of the bronchioles was composed of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells. In the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts, there was a thick wall that was supported by smooth muscle tissue surrounded by collagen and elastin fibers. The visceral pleura represents thick fibrous connective tissue with a few networks of blood vessels.\n\nThe respiratory physiology of dugongs has indicated that inspiration time was close to animals with paired nostrils and forced expiration, as is commonly present in animals that need to replenish oxygen storage. The dugong has 2–3 min breath intervals, but can extend as long as 24 min in individuals during resting time (Reynolds, 1981). Hypoxemia and hypercapnia conditions have been reported in relation to the respiratory drive of Amazonian manatees. It was found that carbon dioxide, rather than oxygen, was concluded to be the primary controller of ventilation and drive activity.\n\nIn summary, the different anatomy, histology, and stiffer mechanism properties of the dugong respiratory tract might be considered an adaptation of reinforcement and resistance to diving under a high-pressure environment. In comparisons with certain terrestrial mammals, such as cats, dogs, or pigs, this could be explained by respiratory airway structure differences and performance limits displayed by terrestrial vs marine mammals during breath-holding diving."
