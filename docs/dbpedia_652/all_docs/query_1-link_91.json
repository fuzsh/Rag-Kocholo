Australia is home to globally significant and some of the last healthy populations of dugongs. We have a global obligation to conserve and recover this species for future generations.\n\nAbout Dugongs\n\nAustralia is home to the world’s largest dugong population with more than 100,000 thought to live in the Torres Strait.\n\nDugongs diet consists almost entirely of seagrass.\n\nDugongs can live for around 70 years, but they are slow to mature, with females reaching breeding age at around 10 years.\n\nFemales only give birth to a single calf every 3-7 years. The calf will stay with its mother for two years.\n\nIf there are stresses in their environment (such as increased cyclones and floods from climate change) then dugongs will produce fewer young.\n\nDugongs have the ability to hold their breath for up to 11 minutes and dive up to 33 metres.\n\nDugongs grow up to 3 metres in length and weigh over 500 kilograms.\n\nDugongs restore and spread seagrass habitats, making them essential ecosystem engineers. Seeds digested by dugongs are spread further and germinate much faster when transported by the dugong and its poop!\n\nThreats to Dugongs\n\nWhile some of Australia’s dugong populations are healthy, others, such as on the Southern Great Barrier Reef, are in decline.\n\nCommercial gillnet fishing is a major threat to dugongs in Queensland. Dugongs are air breathing marine mammals, and are easily entangled in fishing nets and drown.\n\nSome areas along the eastern Queensland coastline are closed to fishing to protect dugongs and other marine wildlife, but we need more net free zones in our Great Barrier Reef to ensure their recovery.\n\nDugongs are also threatened by climate change and poor water quality. Dugongs are dependent on shallow coastal waters and are vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events, such as cyclones, flooding and water pollution, which destroy their critical seagrass meadows.\n\nCollisions with boats are another threat to dugongs, go-slow zones in key habitats are needed to reduce this risk.\n\nReferences"
