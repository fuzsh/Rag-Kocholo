        "text": "Americans celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act late last year, serving as a reminder of the 1,662 domestic and 638 foreign species it protects. The act is credited with saving 99% of listed species from extinction.\n\nBut, other species remain on the brink of extinction in the U.S. and around the globe. Heat, drought and rising seas brought on by climate change are threatening many species' habitats. Rhinos, which are among the most endangered land animals, face near-unlivable climate change-related rising temperatures in southern Africa, a recent study found.\n\nWhat is the rarest animal in the world?\n\nThe vaquita is the rarest animal in the world and the rarest marine mammal. These porpoises swim in the Gulf of California and were only discovered in 1958, according to the World Wildlife Fund. They are on the brink of extinction, in part, because of the use of gillnets in illegal fishing operations, which often unintentionally trap marine mammals.\n\nThere are only about 10 vaquita remaining.\n\nBut there are still signs of hope – conservationists in northern Mexico spotted a vaquita calf swimming next to its mother in Sept. 2023, a promising sign of population growth.\n\nTwo species of rhinos are contenders for the title of rarest land mammal for different reasons. The Javan rhino is the “most threatened of the five rhino species” when it comes to poaching, according to the WWF. Only about 70 reside in the Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. But the Sumatran rhino, the wooly rhino’s closest living descendent, is threatened due to habitat loss. Remaining Sumatran rhinos live in “small, fragmented non-viable populations,” with low chances of finding each other to mate.\n\nWash ashore: Officials say this could be world's rarest whale species\n\nWhat are the most endangered animals?\n\nHere are the top 10 species in the “critically endangered” category based on population size estimates from the WWF:\n\nVaquita: 10\n\nSumatran rhino: 40\n\nJavan Rhino: 70\n\nAmur Leopards: More than 84\n\nCross River Gorilla: 200-300\n\nSaola: Less than 750\n\nTapanuli orangutan: 800\n\nYangtze finless porpoise: 1,000-1,800\n\nSumatran elephants: 2,400-2,800\n\nSunda tiger: 5,574\n\nOthers on the critically endangered list include the African forest elephant, black rhinos, Bornean orangutans, eastern lowland gorillas, hawksbill turtles, Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran rhinos and western lowland gorillas.\n\nWhat is the rarest fish in the world?\n\nThe Devils Hole pupfish are the rarest fish in the world. Last year, scientists counted just 175 of them swimming in a deep cavernous pool in the Death Valley National Park in Nevada. But the population has held steady in recent years, even reaching 236 during one fall count when food was more abundant. In 2013, there were only 35 fish.\n\nThese fish, who get their name from the way they “frolic about,” live an isolated life and share no common ancestry with any other species. They have one of the smallest, most distinctive habitats in the world, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nJust Curious for more? We've got you covered."
