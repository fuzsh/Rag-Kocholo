        "text": "The dugong is a docile mammal that moves slowly along shallow seabeds and feeds on seagrass, resting on reefs after a full meal. It has poor eyesight but excellent hearing.\n\nResearchers said widespread habitat degradation and hunting were the main contributors to the collapse of the dugong population.\n\nLin’s paper said the animals’ habitat overlapped with areas for fishing and other marine activity, “making them vulnerable to human pressures”.\n\nDugongs have been classified as a “Grade 1 National Key Protected Animal” by China’s State Council since 1988, but the designation did not reverse their falling numbers.\n\nFor at least 4,000 years, humans hunted dugongs for their oil, bones and hides. Other major threats to dugongs include coastal development, pollution, fishing activities and attacks by boats.\n\n“The likely disappearance of dugongs in China was a devastating loss,” said Professor Samuel Turvey of ZSL’s Institute of Zoology, a co-author of the study, in an interview with Reuters.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the loss of the species could have a knock-on effect on ecosystem function and raises concerns about threats to other marine mammals.\n\nIn December 2019, land-reclamation projects for US military bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa affected nearby dugongs, according to a report by Shanghai-based news outlet Guancha.\n\nMost of the world’s remaining dugongs are found along the northern coast of Australia. Even in protected areas, some of the “sea cows” are still killed by poachers and die accidentally from fishing gear and shark nets.\n\nThe scientists said that the extinction of dugongs in China should raise the public’s awareness about pollution, marine habitats and species loss caused by human activity."
