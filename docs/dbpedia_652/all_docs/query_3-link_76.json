        "text": "Often confused with their friend, Manatees and Dugongs seem to look similar at a glance. However, both of them actually possess many differences. The underlying reason for their resemblance could be that both have the same ancestry as both are mammals of the Sirenian order. Besides that, they have many pronounced differences.\n\nOne, manatees and dugongs have different mouths and tails. Manatees have paddle-shaped tails, more similar to a beaver whereas dugongs have tail flukes with pointed projections at the ends, similar to a dolphin. Furthermore, the snout of a manatee has a divided upper lip that curls in whereas a dugongâ€™s snout is broader, trunk-like and faces downward.\n\nTwo, dugongs tend to be smaller than manatees. Dugongs have an average weight of 250-300kg and grow to an average length of 2.7 metres. Manatees, on the other hand, have an average weight of 500kg and are 3 metres on average.\n\nThree, the wild habitats of manatees and dugongs are different as well. Manatees are mainly found in the shallow marshy areas of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico whereas dugongs are found in shallow coastal areas around Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, manatees can either reside in saltwater or freshwater whereas dugongs are only found in saltwater."
