        "text": "Fishing\n\nDugongs can easily get tangled in gillnets or caught in traps set for other species, making them unintentional victims of fishing operations. Also, the overfishing of fish species that graze on seagrasses can indirectly harm dugongs by disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. Bottom trawling also damages seagrass meadows, threatening dugongs’ primary food source.\n\nVessel strikes and noise pollution\n\nBoating activities cause several problems for a wide range of marine species, including dugongs. Dugongs are vulnerable to collisions with boats and watercraft because they are slow-moving and tend to float near the water’s surface.\n\nBoat engines also create underwater noise pollution in dugong habitats. Noise pollution can interfere with their communication, navigation, and foraging, potentially leading to disorientation and stress.\n\nExcessive boat activity can degrade seagrass meadows and interrupt dugong feeding and breeding cycles.\n\nHabitat loss\n\nDugongs face the threat of habitat loss from many causes, including human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling and destructive fishing, and natural disasters like cyclones and tsunamis.\n\nThreats to their food source\n\nDugongs rely on seagrass to survive, and the degradation of their feeding ground directly leads to their decreasing population. Seagrass is constantly threatened by untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging, agricultural pollution, and fishing practices.\n\nClimate change\n\nJust like most other animal species on the planet, dugongs face the looming threat of climate change. Extreme weather events and rising temperatures are constantly contributing to the declining health of dugong populations.\n\nHunting\n\nEven though dugongs are legally protected in most regions, they are still hunted for their meat and oil. In some Asian cultures, dugong meat is considered luxury food and is also believed to have aphrodisiac properties, and they have been hunted to near-extinction in some countries, including Indonesia, Singapore, and Cambodia.\n\nWhile dugong hunting is illegal in most places, in Australia it is legal but heavily regulated. Conservationists are pushing for the number of dugongs hunted in Australia to be drastically reduced.\n\nHow many dugongs are left?\n\nAs of August 2022, there were thought to be around 100,000 dugongs left worldwide.\n\nThe size of dugong populations varies wildly by region. In one area off the coast of Western Australia, called Shark Bay, there are about 10,000 dugongs. Another 20,000 live in the Gulf of Carpentaria, off Australia’s northern coast.\n\nHowever, in other areas, dugong populations are dwindling. They are functionally extinct in Chinese waters, quickly dwindling in Thailand, and there are fewer than 50 left in Okinawa, Japan.\n\nWhat country do dugongs live in?\n\nDugongs can be found in the coastal waters of around 40 countries in the Indian and Pacific oceans. The waters of Australia are home to the most significant dugong populations.\n\nThey also live along the coasts of countries bordering the Red Sea, including Egypt and Sudan, and all the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and the eastern coast of Africa.\n\nThe western, warmer Pacific Ocean is also a dugong habitat, including areas around countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands. In Southeast Asia, some populations exist in regions such as the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nDugong distribution is closely tied to the presence of seagrass habitats, which are their primary food source. The health of these habitats plays a significant role in their presence in a particular area.\n\nAre dugongs friendly?\n\nDugongs are very friendly, curious animals and often interact with people. However, as with all wild animals, you should always be cautious when viewing dugongs. Always keep your distance from mothers with calves, and never interrupt them while they’re eating.\n\nDugongs are intelligent animals with long memories. Disturbing a dugong while it feeds can lead to them not eating enough, impacting the number of calves born.\n\nDo sharks eat dugongs?\n\nIn most cases, dugongs can evade sharks due to their large size and ability to swim quickly. Though it is rare, tiger sharks have been known to attack and feed on dugongs.\n\nDugongs can become targets if isolated or weakened, making them more vulnerable to attacks by larger marine animals.\n\nHow long do dugongs live?\n\nDugongs live long lives—up to 73 years. Females reach sexual maturity at age 10. They give birth every three to seven years and have a 12-month gestation period.\n\nDo dugongs have teeth?\n\nYes, dugongs have teeth. Their teeth and skulls are one way in which they’re different from manatees. As herbivores, their teeth are peglike, adapted for grinding rather than cutting or tearing.\n\nDugongs’ front incisor teeth form short tusks, which are most clearly visible on adult males. These signal to females that the male has reached maturity and is ready to breed.\n\nHow long can dugongs stay underwater?\n\nAs mammals, dugongs breathe oxygen the same way humans do. A dugong can typically stay underwater for around six minutes before it needs to resurface for air. Dugongs can extend their time underwater when resting or sleeping, as they can reduce their metabolic rate during these periods.\n\nIn shallow water, they sometimes breathe by ‘standing’ on their tails and putting their heads above the water’s surface."
