The 32nd Medical Brigade helped kick off Fiesta San Antonio by hosting the annual U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence 2024 Fiesta Fun Run at the n MacArthur Parade Field at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.

King Antonio CI Scott Christy and Rey Feo LXXV John McFadden, along with other Fiesta royalty, joined more than 3,000 soldiers for the two-mile run in the early morning hours of April 17, 2014.

Afterwards the distinguished visitors joined MEDCoE senior leaders at Aabel Hall for a social gathering.

Fiesta San Antonio started in 1891 as a one-parade event to honor the memory of the heroes of the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto.

That historic commemoration still takes place, but for more than a century, Fiesta has grown into a celebration of San Antonio’s rich and diverse cultures and today is one of this nation’s premier festivals.
