        "text": "The 44th Medical Brigade beret flash, more accurately termed an organizational flash since it represents a single unit or organization, was approved for wear 1 August 1995. It is worn centered on the stiffener of the maroon beret authorized for wear in lieu of the black beret by personnel in Airborne units.\n\nOfficers wear their nonsubdued insignia of rank centered on the flash, while NCOs and Junior Enlisted Soldiers wear the 44th Medical Brigade Distinctive Unit Insignia, or unit crest, in similar fashion. All personnel in the Brigade wear the flash regardless of their individual Airborne or Airborne-related qualifications.\n\nOn the other hand, the Brigade’s oval—officially called Airborne background trimming—is worn only by Brigade personnel who have qualified or a Parachutist or Air Assault badge. The main portion of the badge is centered on the oval before they are placed on the AGSU or ASU coat, the Class B ASU shirt, or the green or blue Army Maternity Tunic (female Soldiers only).\n\nRelated Items:\n\n44th Medical Brigade Patch (SSI)\n\n44th Medical Brigade Unit Crest (DUI)\n\n44th Medical Brigade Combat Service ID Badge (CSIB)\n\nAn oval-badge combination is considered a single item toward the maximum number of badges and devices allowed on a uniform, with the edge of the oval (and the top of star or wreathed star on Senior and Master Parachutist badges) used when measuring distances between badges, pockets, etc.\n\nGuidance on the wear of the organizational flash and Airborne background trimming is found in the January 2021 edition of DA PAM 670-1, Chapter 21-32, subsections (a) and (b). Oval and badge placement and positioning varies between the different authorized uniforms; detailed instructions are also found in Chapter 22-16, subsection (b) of DA PAM 670-1.\n\nConstituted in the Regular Army as HQ and HQ Detachment, 44th Medical Brigade on 30 December 1965 and activated on 1 January 1966, the 44th Medical Brigade’s battle honors include a dozen campaigns in Vietnam, 1989’s Operation Just Cause in Panama, three campaigns in the First Gulf War of 1990-1991, and at least three campaigns in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), with additional campaign credits for the GWOT yet to be determined.\n\nDuring its service in Vietnam, the Brigade was selected for two Meritorious Unit Commendations (MUCs) and a Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal, First Class for its service between 1968 and 1970. The Brigade was awarded its third MUC for outstanding service during the First Gulf War, followed by three more MUCs for its service Iraq and Afghanistan between 2004 and 2012.\n\nAs of 2021, the 44th Medical Brigade consists of two Combat Support Hospitals, a Hospital Center, one Multifunctional Medical Battalion, and four forward Surgical Teams, along with numerous Medical Detachments and Dental Companies stationed throughout the Eastern United States. It is headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina."
