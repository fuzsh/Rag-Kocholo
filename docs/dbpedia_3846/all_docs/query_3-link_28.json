His mother went to the brigade requesting medication for his son. When she explained that she couldn¬¥t take him to the brigade because he can¬¥t walk, the doctors and staff decided to go visit him and refer him to GB Patient Referral Program.\n\nCarlos Daniel was born with Down Syndrome and paralysis from his left arm and both legs. He can¬¥t walk, eat or bathe by himself. His mom has to help him permanently, and the main reason why his mother couldn¬¥t take him to the brigade is because they don¬¥t have a wheelchair to help move him around.

Nelson entered the Patient Referral Program at 18 years old and was first seen by the University of Pittsburg during a medical brigade in El Cant√≥n, where he was recommended to the patient referral program.\n\nNelson suffers from cataracts, a cleft palate, as well as severe contractures in both legs. He had three surgeries to correct his cleft palate, but he still needs an additional surgery to help his speech impediment. Due to the severity of the contractures, Nelson is unable stand up straight, and he must use his hands to walk. Although Nelson has adapted and become very agile using all four limbs, he faces significant obstacles in his everyday life.\n\nAfter his initial assessment, Dr. Bruce, the previous head of the patient referral program, believed that the contractures in Nelson‚Äôs legs were due to a folic acid deficiency in his mother during pregnancy. Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy commonly leads to birth defects with the most frequent being spina bifida and other growth problems.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNelson had an initial consultation with an ophthalmologist who confirmed he has congenital cataracts in both eyes and needs a surgery to remove the cataracts and implant new lenses.\n\nNelson also meet with a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to determine what could be done to correct the contractures in his legs. The doctor said that his right leg could be straightened by resetting his bones and installing metal rods in his leg and foot. His left leg is unable to be corrected, but the doctor suggested using a prosthetic, which will allow his right leg to stand upright.\n\nNelson‚Äôs final consultation was with a plastic surgeon about his cleft palette. Upon further examination it was discovered that Nelson needs significant dental surgery. Nelson was able to have the frenum of his tongue (the portion of connective tissue connecting his tongue to his lower jaw) repaired during the visit, which will significantly improve his ability to speak.\n\nCall to Action\n\nThe patient referral team is very hopeful that Nelson can greatly improve his quality of life through these procedures! Please consider donating to help Nelson improve his quality of life through various interventions. Our goal is to raise $3,500 to assist Nelson.\n\nUpdate\n\nWe would like to give a very big thank you to Dr. and Mrs. Butler from Pittsburg who were crucial in this treatment and accompanied Nelson on his initial consultation!\n\nKellin Lizeth Colindres Rosales | Honduras\n\nLipomeningocele, severe equino-cavus deformity of the foot\n\nKellin has been in the Patient Referral Program since 2015 and needs surgery for her feet as a result of a neural cavity defect and severe equino-cavus deformity of the foot.\n\nLearn More\n\n√ó\n\nKellin Lizeth Colindres Rosales | Honduras\n\nLipomeningocele, severe equino-cavus deformity of the foot\n\nDonate Now\n\n$0 of $5000.00\n\n0%\n\nBackground\n\nAGE: 19\n\nCOMMUNITY: Teupasenti\n\nDIAGNOSTIC: Lipomeningocele, severe equino-cavus deformity of the foot\n\nWe met Kellin on a Medical Brigade to Teupasenti in July 2015 and learned of a few pressing health concerns that made her a good candidate for the Patient Referral Program.

He went to a medical brigade in Santa Rosa Guinope a community located approximately 2 hours away from Tegucigalpa, but Quebrachos, the community where he lives, is farther away. People walk to get to other places and they only have a bus service that works only early morning. they don‚Äôt have a health center or nurse in the community. For these reasons, people like Exon and his family walk long distances whenever they find out there is a medical brigade nearby.\n\nThe brigade took place in March 2017, when Exon was evaluated by the doctors in one of the consult stations. A doctor discovered he has had a lipoma of 3 centimeters on his back for 2 years already, it doesn‚Äôt cause him pain, but it is growing rapidly.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThanks to Mount Allison University we are going to be able to take him to the surgeon and decide if he need the surgical procedure. They have donated $165 towards his medical care already! Exon has been receiving treatment in the nearby hospital in Talanga. His initial visits showed that he would not need surgery, but he had a follow-up visit in November 2017 to verify.\n\nCall to Action\n\nExon is in need of additional medical care for his condition. We are seeking $100 in donations to assist Exon to cover medical costs.\n\nUpdate\n\nIn November of 2017 we learned that Exon is a good candidate for surgery to remove the lipoma on his back.

They live in the community of Mezcales, Cantarranas a community that is located about an hour away from Tegucigalpa. It has limited access, and there is no public transportation in this area. People living here must walk long distances to catch a bus, buy groceries, or seek medical attention.\n\nWhen we were going to their home, the difficult access to the community was evident. We saw that there were almost no houses or any other buildings. They live in a small house that is still under construction and has no doors, windows, light, or water. It hasn‚Äôt been possible for them to finish the house because they don‚Äôt have the money to do so.\n\nThere are nine family members living in the house, four of them are kids who are currently in school. Only two of the adults work in agriculture or other minor jobs they can find in the area, and the rest of the family members have to stay home because of their medical condition.\n\nFour members of this family have been diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. They have to visit the doctor for follow up and get medications for each month. Sometimes they don‚Äôt have the money to pay for their transportation, so they can‚Äôt make it to the consult. Luckily for them they receive medication from the public hospital, but, whenever there is no medication at the hospital they have to buy it at a pharmacy. Insulin needs to be stored in a refrigerator, but they don‚Äôt even have electricity at their home so they store it in a clay vase with a little bit of ice.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIt is our wish and desire to help this family, improve their living conditions. The Global Brigades staff is already working on this case, talking with other organizations and the city mayor. Our priority is getting electricity and water for them, and they also need urgently a refrigerator.
