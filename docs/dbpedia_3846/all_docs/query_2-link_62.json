During Inochi No Onjin, which means “lifesaver,” Marines and Sailors refined casualty care techniques through a series of simulated casualty evacuations. More importantly, Inochi No Onjin increased interoperability between joint services on both command and control and en-route care. (U.S. Marine Corps video by Cpl. Deseree Kamm)",
