        "text": "We’ve posted a lot in the past two weeks about the U.S. – Moroccan exercise African Lion, which wrapped up yesterday in Morocco. The exercise involved about 1,200 U.S. and 900 Moroccan military members sharing knowledge and training on everything from amphibious assault landings to water purification to medical and dental treatment.\n\nWe’ve brought you stories, photos and videos of it all, thanks to our U.S. Marine Forces Africa and 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit public affairs personnel.\n\nBut how was the event viewed in Morocco? Like most such engagements, there are supporters and detractors.\n\nOur on-staff Arab linguist translated some of the local media reports and online commentary for us. Here are some excerpts:\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to strengthen the capabilities of both militaries to maneuver, fight terrorism and gather Intel, in addition to conducting other social activities by providing humanitarian services and aid to the local population.\n\n— Assdae Al-Maghreb Online\n\n“African Lion aims to ‘reinforce the coordination and cooperation between the armed forces of both countries, and the mutual understanding of their respective military techniques and standard operating procedures.'”\n\n— Sheba Center for Strategic Studies\n\n“Ahmed Chnaoui, the General Coordinator of the Movement for the consideration of the tribe of the ‘Oulad Buaayta’ … directly criticized the Commander of the Southern Military Region, General de Corps d’Armee, Abdelazizi Bennani, ‘who turned the area which belongs to the noble Oulad Buaayta tribe into an international experimental military center which hosts, among others, NATO air forces.’”\n\n— Hespress\n\n“Because of what is happening close to our lovely kingdom, it’s not enough to have a weapon but you must know how to use it as well. So for the people who are living around the military area, it’s not bad to sacrifice for the country.”\n\n— Reader comment on Hespress\n\n” A well-trained army will protect us from the enemies who surround us.”\n\n— Reader comment on Hespress\n\n“Morocco sure needs to conduct exercises with USMC (United States Marine Corps) for our national security because we have three neighbors at risk, Mauritania, Mali and southern Algerian. The world security evolves and so must Morocco.”"
