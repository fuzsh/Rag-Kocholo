        "text": "These Wisconsin National Guard units, below, were not organic to the 32D Infantry Division. They were included on the rosters in 32d Infantry Division - World War II, likely because they would have supported WisconsinÂ’s half of the Division during annual encampments before the war, almost as if they were organic. The 135TH Med. Regt. provided occasional support for the Division after mobilization as well, at Camp Livingston, in Australia, on New Guinea and in the Philippines."
