This game is pretty wild, gang.\n\nSupport the show at https://www.patreon.com/HyperbolicGameChamber\n\nA lot of stuff happened last year. But also a bunch of video games came out!

In jail! Fei Fong Wong wakes up after the battle for Aveh to a mix of good and bad news. Good news: he's alive. Bad news: he's a prisoner of the Kislev Empire. Luckily, the Nortune prison runs on a fighting tournament based economy, so Fei has an edge.\n\nMeeting Rico Banderas, who definitely does not infringe on any copyrights whatsoever, Fei gets caught up in the investigation of a string of brutal killings.

He has a problem: robot violence. Also amnesia, but the robot violence is the main thing. Caught up in the middle of a centuries long war, Fei suffers from the loss of his home and crushing guilt at his role in its destruction. But whatever because Bart the Pirate King has a corrupt regime to topple, so Fei has more robo-battling ahead of him.\n\nThrough it all, we are confronted by the ultimate question: Dost thou desire The Power?\n\nSupport the show at https://www.patreon.com/HyperbolicGameChamber\n\nThe most requested game we've ever had, it is finally time to face the legendary Sonic '06!\n\nIn this reboot(?), Sonic intervenes in Eggman's evil schemes yet again and rescues the Princess of the bizarre nation of Soleanna. While he pursues whatever his dark designs are, Sonic is pursued by a mysterious time traveler seeking to save a blighted future.

The science is not yet in, but the FDA advises extreme caution. HBGC does not accept responsibility for any mental or physical damages caused by prolonged bopping. Listen at your own risk.\n\nIn this episode, the boys tackle the infamous cult classic adventure game Hopkins FBI!\n\nIn a world made entirely of edgelords, one man stands for justice. I don't know who that man is, because it is not Agent Hopkins. Hopkins is a highly decorated FBI agent who squares off against the worst of the worst and occasionally wins. He \"foils\" a bank robbery only to have his life turned upside down by the return of his arch-nemesis, Bernie Berkson. Hopkins will wade through a sea of dead women on his quest to save his girlfriend and the world.\n\nOne thing he will not do, however, is react to anything like a human being would.\n\nSupport the show at https://www.patreon.com/HyperbolicGameChamber\n\nShow more"
