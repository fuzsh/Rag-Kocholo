        "text": "Ancient Greek mythology is a pretty fertile ground for storytelling. Everything’s there for the taking: sex, violence, gods, tragic heroes, epic fantasy storylines and Zeus only knows what else. Unfortunately, there’s also a lot of boring history to wade through before one gets to the really juicy stuff. Ancient Greece, you see, is the birthplace of democracy, so there’s plenty of fairly dry political machinations and internecine family conflicts to battle through if you’re a historian (of course, a lot of that is pretty compelling too, so fill your boots, I guess). Basically, what I’m trying to say is that Ancient Greece is very fertile ground for video games, and indeed history has borne this out. God of War, Age of Mythology, Spartan: Total Warrior, err, Kid Icarus, and, of course, the subject of today’s testimonial, Rygar. The Rygar franchise started life as a 1986 side-scroller simply titled Rygar (Warrior of Argus if you’re Japanese) with a…let’s charitably call it “obtuse” plot and a pretty sweet precursor to Kratos’ Blades of Chaos in the Diskarmor. In 2001, original Rygar developers Tecmo thought the franchise was ripe for revival, so they dragged it out of the pits of Hades Persephone-style to spend six months soaking up limited commercial appeal and some critical favour. It’s time to examine a game from 2001 through a modern lens and inevitably find it lacking!\n\nOkay, so Rygar: The Legendary Adventure takes place on the Mediterranean island of Argus. The titular Rygar is about to receive an award for being great from Princess Harmonia, when suddenly Titans (yes, those Titans) attack the island, capture Princess Harmonia and sic a Minotaur on Rygar. Armed with the fabled Diskarmor (it’s actually called that, and they pronounce it “dis-KARMOR” in game), Rygar must battle the forces of the Titans in order to save Princess Harmonia and the island. I won’t say more about the plot, simply because I think it has to be experienced to be believed, but suffice it to say that this game has one of the stupidest, most ridiculous narratives I’ve ever seen in a video game and I loved it. Some of the twists and revelations are so genuinely, jaw-droppingly idiotic that I have to wonder if the concept of Ancient Greek history and mythology was explained to the writers in a wind tunnel during a severe bout of crippling norovirus. I’ll leave it there, but let’s just say this game takes poetic license to an entirely new level.\n\nWhich leaves us with the gameplay, and whaddya know, Devil May Cry happened not long ago, so let’s make it like that. Rygar: The Legendary Adventure does owe a lot to Devil May Cry, but it differentiates itself in a few key areas, mainly by just not being quite as good. The game’s a third-person hack-and-slash which takes place across multiple stages, each of which is presented to the player in fixed camera angles. There are platforming challenges, some minor puzzles and a whole heap o’combat. The latter is where the game shines, as the Diskarmor proves itself to be a worthy alternative to Dante’s sword. It’s a meaty, heavy-feeling weapon that really crunches with each enemy impact, and it has a few combos to master and use in different situations, which makes combat feel fairly free-flowing and intuitive. The fixed camera angles, like in Devil May Cry, do make the game feel somewhat stiff at times, and combat can be difficult with no lock-on and no real dodge to speak of (there’s a slide move, but it’s about as useful in combat as a piece of cooked spaghetti is as a pipe-cleaner), but on the whole combat is punchy and cathartic. The platforming is…well, it’s pretty darn awkward, but to be honest it’s kind of nice that it’s there at all, especially in light of many horribly-designed God of War clones which would follow. Finally, there’s boss fights, which approach Ninja Gaiden 2 levels of inconsistent baloney. One or two of the bosses will ruin your steez faster than a Republican politician covering up an illicit affair, while even some late-game encounters are a complete piece of cake. The bosses don’t quite feel designed around the game’s moveset, either, and it’s very possible to get stunlocked into extended combo animations which will drain your HP in a frustratingly slow mockery of interactivity.\n\nAll this said, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure is a pretty short game, so many of these problems may not grate as much as they did with me. Its weird pseudo-open world is confusingly laid out and hard to navigate (apparently, there’s some sort of fast travel system, but I never found it), but it does feature some clever level design. The art style is pretty compelling, too; the developers apparently spent some time in Greece as inspiration, but if they saw the kind of things that feature as bosses in this game then I wouldn’t recommend it as a holiday destination. Rygar: The Legendary Adventure is worth experiencing as a short, punchy, cathartic rush through a few fairly memorable (if occasionally badly designed) levels, but don’t expect to have a hankering to revisit it once you’re done."
