        "text": "Koei Tecmo (the merger of Koei and Tecmo) has created many great games over the years, their best franchises including Nobunaga's Ambition, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive, Atelier, Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Monster Rancher, Fatal Frame, and Nioh. They've even helped work on external franchises, like Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem. They've had a few crossovers, such as Warriors Orochi, but they've probably never had a crossover platform-fighter game. Like KneeOfJustice99 said, Koei Tecmo doesn't have a lot of iconic characters to choose from, so this might be a short project compared to my other Platfighter threads. Anyway, let's name a couple characters to start.\n\nRyu Hayabusa (Ninja Gaiden)\n\nRyu Hayabusa is the protagonist of the Ninja Gaiden series. He made his fighting game debut in Dead or Alive in 1996, probably as a guest character and as a crucial part of the story, and has been a mainstay for the series since then. His theme music could be a remixed medley of Unbreakable Determination and The Shooted.\n\nKasumi (Dead or Alive)\n\nKasumi is the main protagonist of the Dead or Alive series. In the first game, she goes on a personal quest for revenge and ventures off on her own to enter the Dead or Alive tournament, knowing she's skilled in the art of Mugen Tenshin, and defeat her renegade uncle Raidou, breaking the clan's rules by leaving without permission and is now cast out as an outlaw and a traitor. Her theme music would be a remix of Hitohira ~ Reminiscent of Ketsui No Toki.\n\nAyane (Dead or Alive)\n\nAyane is Kasumi's half-sister and one of the main characters of the Dead or Alive series. Ayane was shunned from her village at an early age, and she grew up angry, and vengeful towards the people that made her childhood miserable. As a result of this, she wants Kasumi dead, seeing as she was always favored over Ayane. Her theme music would be a remix of Tehu Tehu.\n\nZhao Yun (Dynasty Warriors)\n\nZhao Yun is basically the poster boy and one of the main characters of the Dynasty Warriors series, which is an iconic part of Koei Tecmo's legacy, especially its rock soundtrack. His theme music could be a remix of Arena.\n\nLu Bu (Dynasty Warriors)\n\nI... I... It's... Lu Bu! Don't pursue Lu Bu! Need I say more? His theme music would obviously be a remix of Theme of Lu Bu.\n\nYukimura Sanada (Samurai Warriors)\n\nLike Zhao Yun, Yukimura Sanada is the poster boy and one of the main characters of the Samurai Warriors series, another iconic part of Koei Tecmo's legacy, especially its techno soundtrack. His theme music could be a remix of Osaka Castle.\n\nNobunaga Oda (Samurai Warriors)\n\nNobunaga Oda is the titular character of the Nobunaga's Ambition series and another one of the main characters of Samurai Warriors, usually recurring as a villain. His theme music could be a remixed medley of Okehazama and Honnoji.\n\nNow let's get started on our first three Jobs.\n\nJob #1:\n\nPick a roster number.\n\nJob #2:\n\nPick a title for the game\n\nJob #3:\n\nPick a \"classic\" Koei Tecmo character and a \"modern\" Koei Tecmo character.\n\nJob #01.\n\n20 Characters. Look, Koei-Tecmo doesn't have anywhere near as many iconic characters as other companies out there. 20 is a decent choice.\n\nJob #02.\n\nKoei-Tecmo All-Stars, pulled from Warriors All-Stars, though this isn't a Warriors game so we can't really use that title again (hence the rewrite.)\n\nJob #03.\n\nClassic Koei-Tecmo Character:\n\nCharacter Name: Bomb Jack\n\nCharacter Origin: Bomb Jack (Arcade, 1984)\n\nAn older series from Tecmo's Tehkan days, I think Bomb Jack could be a pretty fun if unorthodox character to represent half of the company's origins. He's a superhero who can glide around, and typically collects and defuses bombs - though we could easily have his moveset include bombs as well for some flair.\n\nModern Koei-Tecmo Character:\n\nCharacter Name: William Adams\n\nCharacter Origin: Nioh (2017)\n\nAn Irish sailor who would travel to Japan and become a samurai during the late Sengoku period, William's got the potential to be a unique take on what'll likely be a fairly typical \"swordfighter\" archetype here. He'd potentially be able to call on different Guardian Spirits for buffs, and can switch between High and Low Stances."
