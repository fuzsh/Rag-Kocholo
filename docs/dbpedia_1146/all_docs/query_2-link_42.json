        "text": "Introduction\n\nRygar is the long waited remake of an ancient and revered title from the days when 16 bit processors were unheard of. The lone warrior Rygar--raised from the dead to fight the tyranny that has seized the land of Argus-- is well known to the most veteran of gamers.\n\nThe new and improved Rygar does not disappoint. Although its story makes as much sense as the tale about the 88 Chinese ninjas who stole the Mask of Zorro from the Three Musketeers who were guarding the Tower of London following the Deadly Alliance formed between Doctor John Dee and Nostradamus to raise Nobunaga from the dead to conduct a bare knuckled fist fight with Lord Guan Yu atop the Eiffel Tower while half-way across the globe King Kong laid the Smackdown on Godzilla in the American Southwest populated by midgets dressed in Smurf clothing.\n\nRygar, in spite of the murky story, is a very good game, worthy of the words, \"Legendary Adventure\". We'll help get through it with a huge, detailed walkthrough, and extensive secrets section, and even Q&A to answer your most pressing Rygar queries."
