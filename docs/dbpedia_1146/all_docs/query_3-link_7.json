        "text": "Movement - Left Analog Stick. Rygar supports full analog control and may walk or run depending on how far off center the stick is depressed. Movement is screen oriented and like Devil May Cry, will carry over for a while when the camera angle changes.\n\nJumping - X button. Rygar jumps. Since he's fat (and a Heavy Infantryman) you will notice he can't jump high. Like Strider Hiryuu. This button will be used in conjunction with the shoulder buttons to carry out other moves that will help Rygar get the Princess as well as his rocks off.\n\nAttack - Circle, Square, or Triangle. Rygar's attacks will make or break him (usually break him). Each Diskarmour will utilise the buttons differently, and you will want to refer to the Diskarmour section below for any details.\n\nGuard - R1 or L1. Rygar will brace and guard. This is very important if you want to live. Rygar, unlike Link in Ocarina of Time, will turn to face his attacker if an attack strikes him (even from the back). When in doubt, guard. While some attacks may be unblockable, you never know what you can guard without trying. You will also use this for recovery when knocked back and need to recover to land on your feet.\n\nHanging - Sometimes, Rygar only barely makes it to the next ledge. Rare, but it will happen if you miss some jumps and wind up clinging to the edge of a ledge. When Rygar dangles on the precipice, use the Analog stick to haul ass, or the X button to drop down.\n\nMini-map - R3. Toggles the mini-map at the bottom right of the screen on or off. Use it when exploring, and turn it off for boss fights, or in rooms with lots of enemies for you to deal with.\n\nCycle - R2 or L2. Rygar quick cycles through his Diskarmour collection without resorting to the subscreen. Useful only if you don't like to pause the action of the game and get disoriented. You can also \"back-up\" a cycle by pressing R2 or L2 while Rygar is attacking, summoning a familiar, or engaged in other unwholesome activities with Princess Harmonia in order to equip a Diskarmour other than the one he's using that will be needed after attacking, summoning a familiar, or engaging in unwholesome activities with Princess Harmonia. Huhuhuhu.\n\nSubscreen - Start. Accesses a variety of play functions, like Mystic Stones and moves lists. You will use this often.\n\nOption - Select. Accesses game options, like soft reset, sound, video, and other adjustment screens.\n\nSlide - R1 and X. Earned in World 1, Colosseo. Rygar makes a quick move along the ground to go under low obstacles, and to avoid attacks\n\nGrapple - Square or Circle (hold). It requires a latch crystal (purple) to be used, as well as the power you earn in World 3, the Poseidonia Shrine. To effectively grapple, face the latch crystal, do not depress the Analog stick, and hold Square or Circle. Release to traverse the gap. X cancels the grapple before Rygar attempts to traverse.\n\nSwing/Lift - Square or Circle (hold). It requires a latch crystal (yellow or red) to be used, as well as the power you earn in World 4, Labyrinthos. When you swing, Rygar is at his greatest lateral speed when he is at the end of the swing arc, and the lowest lateral speed at the bottom (center) of the swing arc. To effectively lift, go under the latch crystal, do not depress the Analog stick, and hold Square or Circle. Release to hop off from the lift. X cancels the lift. To effectively swing, face the latch crystal, do not depress the Analog stick, then jump and hold Square or Circle in mid-air. Release to detach from the latch orb - hopefully in the right direction.\n\nStomp - R1 (in air). Earned after World 5, Mt. Othrys. Rygar does a fast jump kick that activates switches. It hurts some enemies, but that may be wishful thinking.\n\nTackle - R1 and Square or Circle. Earned in World 6, Arcadia. Rygar will push metal \"tackle\" boxes outta the way. If you use this as an attack, you should at least have Boreas equipped.\n\nSaving\n\nSaving is effected at the various Lion reliefs that ask you to, \"Press the Square button\". Saving can be done on Memory Card 1 or 2, and each card may hold ten saved games. Spread them out, or you will regret it when you encounter a dead game. You should save when the guide prompts you to \"Save the Game\". Although finishing a world should be a good measure to save the game, in order to preclude the possibility of dying and replaying a world you just finished.\n\nIf you have two memory cards,you may want to save across both memory cards, so you'll have the luxury of twenty save files to use rather than ten. Of couse, you will need to note which file has cleared the game and which card has the cleared data saved on it to properly inherit stats.\n\nMini-map\n\nThe different coloured pings represent different things on the mini-map. Naturally the green space is the area Rygar can swarm to while playing. The yellow arrow is Rygar's location and facing. White dots are exits to other areas (i.e., out of this room), while yellow dots are crucial gold statues. Try to have it on when you are exploring the game the first time around; be sure to switch it off (R3) when fighting bosses or numerous enemies.\n\nDiskarmour\n\nThe Diskarmour is a unique weapon, and nothing in the real world is quite like it. It appears as a shield, but in reality, it serves as a weapon as well. Native to the mythical land of Argus, the Diskarmour has attained legendary status as the weapon that brought down great evil many years ago (well, not that many). A Diskarmour protects its user, and when not doing so, provides an impressive long range attack in the pre-gunpowder period. There are four Diskarmours in the game, but in reality, you only need to concern yourself with three, since the first Diskarmour Rygar starts with is actually the Hades Diskarmour in slumber.\n\nStrengthening a Diskarmour will add 10 attack points immediately, as well as allow it to mount an extra mystic stone. You can strengthen each diskarmour twice, after which, you should spend your sfaira on other Diskarmours. Strengthening a Diskarmour to level 2 requires 1000 sfaira, and upgrading from level 2 to level 3 requires 2000 sfaira. In total, you will need to collect 9000 sfaira each play to level up all your Diskarmours. Besides attacking, a Diskarmour can also pick up items when it attacks. This comes in handy if items are just out of reach of Rygar.\n\nNormal and Hades Diskarmour\n\nOverview - The Hades Diskarmour is what you start off with. It is a fairly powerful weapon, but lacks breadth when it comes to multiple enemies. It is about average for a Diskarmour, and its primary strength comes from its long striking range. Against slow, single foes this Diskarmour is unmatched in performance. Its damage modifier is 100%. All moves denoted by Square may be duped by Circle.\n\nSquare - A single attack, used for testing out obstacles or as a probe.\n\nSquare (hold) - Snap throw. When it contacts an enemy, Rygar will spin it around then throw it with the Analog Stick. You will need to rotate the Analog stick to make him twirl the monster first, then point the stick in a direction to throw it once the twirling motion gets underway.\n\nTriangle - Variant single. More powerful (+20% damage) but is slower in execution. Plus Rygar starts moving forward like he wants to hug a half-nekkid vampiress with venomous spiked barbs coming out of her back.\n\nSquare, Square, Square - A powerful triple attack. Note that this is one of the few attacks that Rygar doesn't start moving around, but still does decent damage. Adding a fourth tap of Square will cause Rygar to finish off with a stronger, longer blow, but he will move forward by one or two steps.\n\nSquare, Triangle, Triangle, Triangle - Variant strike. This is Rygar's most powerful attack until he starts learning new moves for his Diskarmours later. It deals with foes above and slightly to the side of him, and is useful for killing some enemies until something else better comes along. Like all variant attacks, it is slow, so don't try it against enemies who have the advantage of range and power over Rygar.\n\nSquare, Square, Triangle - Use this move if you want long range striking power. The variant blow is long, powerful and fast, but winding up to this blow may take longer than expected. You cannot do this \"in a pinch\".\n\nSquare, Square, Triangle (hold) - Up snap. A throw that flings the enemy vertically upwards. Not to useful, unless you plan to use it to knockdown an enemy giving you trouble so you can retreat.\n\nSquare, Triangle, Triangle (hold) - Mid-air snap. After knocking an enemy into the air, Rygar will grab and slam an enemy on the ground for extra style points, but little else. Some enemies take less damage from impacts, but you can theoretically Mid-air snap the first enemy in a line and slam it down on the enemy following behind it.\n\nSquare, Square, Square, Triangle - Hades Execution. You need to earn this move at the entrance to Labyrinthos. It devastates whatever you plan to hit at the end of the Hades Diskarmour chain, but is slower than molasses to pull off. Properly timed, you can kill Cyclops with one of these babies if you processed its monster ass first with some minor hits. Time its use against bosses unless you have a death wish.\n\nSquare (in air) - Lateral attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The lateral attack simply lashes out the Diskarmour straight across, parallel to the ground. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nSquare (hold, in air) - Angled attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The angled attack directs the Diskarmour at a 35 degree angle upwards to hit enemies above Rygar. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nL1 (hold), Triangle (up to 3 times) - Summon familiar. The number of times you press Triangle determines the amount of Icol used and the damage of the attack. Given that the maximum number of times you can summon a familiar is five times on one bar, you will naturally want to resort to this move only if you know it will do you some good. Using it multiple times on any peon enemy (even the Cyclops) shows that you are not skilled to take on any difficulty other than easy. Hades' familiar Cerberus, attacks thusly:\n\nLevel 1 - Straight line attack in front of Rygar to the edge of the screen. Medium damage.\n\nLevel 2 - Star-shaped attack in front of, around, and slightly behind Rygar. Light damage.\n\nLevel 3 - Cone shaped area in front of Rygar, with the heaviest damage where the fireballs land. Medium to heavy damage.\n\nHeaven Diskarmour\n\nOverview - The Heaven Diskarmour is earned after completing World 2, the Elysium Shrine. Its range is less than that of the Hades Diskarmour, its slow, but for all its bad points, it enjoys more damage and attacking horizontally instead of vertically. Against multiple weak foes, the Heaven Diskarmour is great; against one strong enemy, you will resort to the remote option if you don't require too much movement at all. The damage modifier for this Diskarmour is 110%. All moves denoted by Square may be duped by Circle.\n\nSquare - A single attack, easily morphable into the Remote move. When you have a high enough attack rating, you can use this move to decapitate the little bastard gremlins when they are grouped together.\n\nTriangle - The Variant attack is slower than the Hades, so don't press this button unless it is used in conjunction with other attacks.\n\nSquare (hold) - Remote. A very useful move, but lacks range until you get the proper mystic stone (Hera). Rygar basically can whip the Diskarmour around in front of him in a 180 degree arc and anything that it strikes will be \"wiggled hit\" by the undulating chain. You will need to manually control the whipcord with the Analog stick. Square, Square (hold) achieves the same move, but starts the Diskarmour on Rygar's right instead of his left.\n\nSquare, Square, Triangle (hold) - Vortex. Traps enemies in a whirlwind that damages them repeatedly. Does not destroy rubble, statues, or stones, but it sucks in nearby enemies into the micro-tornado. On the other hand, Rygar can't move until the move cancels out or until he's hit.\n\nSquare, Square, Square - Triple attack that rips apart weak enemies like wet tissues at a snot party. It doesn't last as long as the next move listed however, but it is slightly faster and makes Rygar move forward a lot.\n\nSquare, Triangle ... (repeat) - Rygar swings the Diskarmour like a drunk wild man at a soccer riot holding a ten pound metal disk at the end of a fifteen foot heavy gauge chain. Very useful, and one of the better moves that Rygar has.\n\nSquare, Triangle, Square - Similar to Hades Execution, but you can do this as soon as you get the Heaven Diskarmour. It's just as fast but slightly less powerful. It also lacks the range of the Hades attack.\n\nSquare, Square, Square (hold) - Nebular Burst. An earned move (found at Mt. Othrys, half-way up) that whips the Heaven Diskarmour around like Square, Traingle ... (repeat). Slower to build up, shorter travel distance, and a complete waste of effort.\n\nSquare (in air) - Lateral attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The lateral attack simply lashes out the Diskarmour straight across, parallel to the ground. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nSquare (hold, in air) - Angled attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The angled attack directs the Diskarmour at a 35 degree angle upwards to hit enemies above Rygar. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nL1 (hold), Triangle (up to 3 times) - Summon familiar. The number of times you press Triangle determines the amount of Icol used and the damage of the attack. Given that the maximum number of times you can summon a familiar is five times on one bar, you will naturally want to resort to this move only if you know it will do you some good. Using it multiple times on any peon enemy (even the Cyclops) shows that you are not skilled to take on any difficulty other than easy. The Heaven familiar Talos, has the following:\n\nLevel 1 - Single electric punch in front of Rygar that damages around him. Medium damage.\n\nLevel 2 - Cone shaped attack in front of Rygar, with the heaviest damage along the explosion. Light to medium damage.\n\nLevel 3 - Area attack around Rygar. Medium to heavy damage.\n\nSea Diskarmour\n\nOverview - The Sea Diskarmour is earned in the middle of World 3, the Poseidonia Shrine. No boss fight. Just go in and grab it. Just the pain of being slashed by floating enemies with one metal hand. The Sea Diskarmour has the shortest range, but the fastest attack rate. Think back to Maxi from Soul Calibur. What the Sea Diskarmour enjoys in speed, it lacks in strength, having a damage modifier of 90%. However, against a single enemy, you can really rack up the hits and damage if you are persistent and fast enough. When dealing with multiple, moderately strong enemies (Cyclops) you may opt for this Diskamour to quickly kill one enemy quickly (Cyclops) and deal with its comrades later (Cyclops). All moves denoted by Square may be duped by Circle.\n\nTriangle - The variant blow knocks enemies into the air temporarily.\n\nSquare, Square, Square, Square, Square - Quick five hit combo, often used in desperation rather than intention. Other moves are possible for the Sea Diskarmour, but are merely variations of the five to seven hit comboes. Try them out if you prefer, but the Sea Diskarmour is too specialised to be used in every situation unless you plan to combat everyone up close and personal.\n\nSquare, Square, Square, Square (hold) - Oceanic Tempest. Rygar will dash forward and hit an enemy for a pre-set number of hits. The longer you charge the button, the pre-set hits will go up slightly (but not enough to make a big difference). You can chain this move to do a massive number of hits on a lone enemy.\n\nSquare, Square, Square, Square, Triangle - Charybdis. Rygar will do a, \"Call me ninja!\" phantom dash and slice apart whatever was in front of him before the dash. It is not as strong as you think it is, and its use is questionable.\n\nSquare (in air) - Lateral attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The lateral attack simply lashes out the Diskarmour straight across, parallel to the ground. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nSquare (hold, in air) - Angled attack. All Diskarmours have this attack. The angled attack directs the Diskarmour at a 35 degree angle upwards to hit enemies above Rygar. Note that the length of the Diskarmour has no sway over the range of this attack.\n\nL1 (hold), Triangle (up to 3 times) - Summon familiar. The number of times you press Triangle determines the amount of Icol used and the damage of the attack. Given that the maximum number of times you can summon a familiar is five times on one bar, you will naturally want to resort to this move only if you know it will do you some good. Using it multiple times on any peon enemy (even the Cyclops) shows that you are not skilled to take on any difficulty other than easy. Argo's familiar Siren, does the following:\n\nLevel 1 - Siren freezes what ever is in front of Rygar. Light damage.\n\nLevel 2 - Wide area attack around Rygar. Light to medium damage.\n\nLevel 3 - Cone shaped ice attack in front of Rygar. Medium damage."
