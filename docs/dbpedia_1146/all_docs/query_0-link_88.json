        "text": "Man probably the peak of \"childhood gaming\" for me.\n\nI was PC only then. Warcraft 3, Morrowind, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale 2, Jedi Outcast, Allied Assault, UT2K3 all loom large.\n\nAnd then later when I got into consoles it was basically because of Metroid Prime.\n\nBut that summer of WarCraft 3, Morrowind, and Neverwinter Nights, combined with the rest of life as a teenager.. yep. Nostalgia bomb for sure.\n\nI didn't include multiplatforms. Morrowind was Xbox console exclusive. You might add Steel Battalion and Shenmue II too but Shenmue II was on Dreamcast and was Steel Battalion iconic?\n\nOh I don't doubt your choices for the list I'm just remarking because looking back it's kind of amazing Xbox survived against the PS2. So many notable franchises skipped that system.\n\nIt was a really good year especially on PS2.\n\nThe list in the op doesn't even mention lot of the noteworthy PS2 releases like Aggressive Inline, Contra: Shattered Soldier, The Mark of Kri, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure, The Thing (multiplatform) and Wipeout Fusion.\n\nThen there are also more niche cult stuff like Shinobi, Way of the Samurai, Gungrave and Armored Core 3.\n\nWow. So many great games.\n\nMy most played game from that year:\n\nHeroes IV\n\nMy favorite game from then:\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\nShout out for:\n\nSuper Mario Sunshine, Icewindale 2, Vice City, Battlefield 1942, LOTR the Two Towers and Sly Cooper\n\nSo many games I played from this list.\n\nWarcraft III: Reign of Chaos\n\nNeverwinter Nights\n\nAge of Mythology\n\nDungeon Siege\n\nUnreal Tournament 2003\n\nMetroid Prime\n\nSuper Mario Sunshine\n\nGTA: Vice City\n\nRatchet & Clank\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\nThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n\nNo idea where I found either the time or the money. Nowadays I barely play a handful of new releases per year.\n\nOn PS2, I think was mostly still playing games I got from previous year.\n\nOn PC, I'd pickup No One Lives Forever 2...my PC was able run it, but with terrible performance thanks to the wonderful GeForce 2 MX I got stuck with lol.\n\nThat year must've been like diametrically opposed to my tastes because there's almost nothing listed in this that that I played much less liked lol.\n\nMan, imagine someone telling me in 2002 that there would never be a game with Cate Archer again. Goddamn it.\n\nMaybe someday...\n\nNightdive Studios Wants to Remaster No One Lives Forever\n\nNightdive Studios has appealed to Warner Bros. Games to let the studio remaster PS2 classic The Operative: No One Lives Forever and players are being encouraged to help. Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick sent a cheeky tweet to the publisher, a similar tactic used to ask Disney to let them remaster Star...\n\nMaybe someday...\n\nNightdive Studios Wants to Remaster No One Lives Forever\n\nNightdive Studios has appealed to Warner Bros.

Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick sent a cheeky tweet to the publisher, a similar tactic used to ask Disney to let them remaster Star...\n\nI'll never stop beliving.\n\nI just finished Halo yesterday in co-op. I'm 22 yars late to the party... 2022 was the year Halo launched here in Europe. Same year Timesplitters 2 came out.\n\nEarly 2000s were the highest highs in gaming for me back then: 3D gaming maturing, lots of innovations /standards settling... online gaming really becoming mainstream.\n\n2002 was an okay year. I think nostalgia clouds people's judgement of games from this era.\n\nPersonally, as a kid I was playing Super Mario Sunshine and Metroid Prime on the GC.\n\nI was 21 in 2002. Metroid Prime and Eternal Darkness are 2 of the best games ever. But 2002 was really probably not a good year overall. It was right after one of the very best years of 2001."
