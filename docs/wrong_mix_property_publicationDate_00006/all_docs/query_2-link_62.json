        "text": "The first thing you noticed about Bill Gibson was his hands. Bill had huge, powerful hands, the hands of a hardworking man, the hands you shook when he gave you his word. He was a mechanic by trade and a veteran by duty. Most of all, Bill was a proud and loving husband, father and grandfather, remembered not for his hands, but for his even bigger heart.\n\nBill’s story began on a cold winter day in 1920, as the snow fell on the fields in Pullman, Michigan. Those were exciting times in this country, the dawn of the Roaring 20s, ushering in the start of Prohibition and women’s rights to vote, as the world recovered from war. Amid these changing times, Otto and Mabel (Reames) Gibson had another big change in their lives, with the birth of a baby boy on January 13, a son they named John Alfred Gibson.\n\nBill, as he was called, was the baby of four children, joining his three older sisters in the family’s Pullman home. When he was just three years old, however, the family moved to nearby South Haven along the Lake Michigan shoreline, which was the backdrop of his childhood.\n\nBill’s dad was a delivery truck driver, and as a boy he loved riding with his dad on his route. He also loved the lake, from the hot, sunny summer days he spent at the beach, to witnessing the awesome winter weather upon the shore.\n\nBill attended South Haven Schools, participated in Drama Club and graduated in 1937. Diploma in his huge hands, Bill then went to work for his dad, driving the delivery truck. His route took him from South Haven to Kalamazoo every day, and he often exchanged a friendly wave with a beautiful young Western Michigan student as she walked to school.\n\nOne day Bill summoned the courage to stop and ask the girl if she’d like a ride, and she said yes. Her name was Margery Buckham, and the sparks flew between them that day. They quickly began dating, but soon the darkening skies of World War II would split the couple apart.\n\nBill was a big, strong man, with a great sense of duty, and like so many of his peers, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941. Bill (fittingly) drove a truck during the war, using his great driving skills to maneuver through the dangerous, war-torn roads of Germany and Central Europe earning him the Bronze Star in August of 1945. His experiences in the war made him a very patriotic person the rest of his days. He was a staunch defender of the flag and instilled in his grandkids a strong civic sense, telling them, \"You can't bitch if you don't vote.\" He continued to serve his community in a more local capacity from 1971 to 1984 as a member of the Oshtemo Township Fire Board.\n\nWhen the war ended, Bill returned home to Michigan, and home to his beloved Margery. Once reunited, the young couple wasted little time before they were married, on February 9, 1946, in Kalamazoo.\n\nThe newlyweds settled in Kalamazoo, where Bill found a job working for Bill Buell at Kalamazoo Implement as a mechanic. He was a hard-working man, and he provided well for his new bride, and soon enough, his growing family.\n\nThe couple was blessed with four wonderful children over the years, daughters Michele, Carolyn and Holly, and their son, John Jr. Bill was a great dad, and such a great example to his kids. They could never pull a fast one on Bill, either. He had his ways of finding out what they were up to. He’d just look at them sternly and say, “It’d better be a good excuse, because I’ve used them all!” Bill though, always had a joke to share and a funny expression at the ready. “Fair to Middlin,” “That’s how the ball bounces, the mop flops, and the cookie crumbles,” and “Six of one, half-dozen of another,” were all classic Bill-isms.\n\nThe family moved to a beautiful, 10-acre farmhouse in Oshtemo in the 1960s, where Bill lived the rest of his days. Their home was always active, with friends and family coming in and out to visit, snow mobile, play cards or simply enjoy a cup of coffee and a good visit.\n\nWhile the kids were growing up, Bill worked at Kalamazoo Implement but eventually he opened his own shop, Bill Gibson Service. Bill could fix anything. He'd fix machines in the field, in the shop and over the phone, asking the right questions to trouble shoot and relieve a frustrated customer.\n\nBill’s beloved Margery sadly died of cancer in 1990, and though he missed her terribly, he stayed active as ever. He enjoyed going down to Ted and Marie’s Restaurant for coffee every morning, and reading the Kalamazoo Gazette when he came home at night. He loved to read, everything from Reader’s Digest, to Life Magazine, Country Magazine, and several veteran’s magazines. And he enjoyed his TV, as well, especially in recent years, when those huge hands of his were slowed by arthritis. He also made frequent visits to local fruit stands buying boxes and bushels of whatever was in season to share with family. He especially enjoyed the local bounty when it was used for a homemade pie!\n\nBill enjoyed other things, too, like playing cribbage and solitaire, driving through the back woods to watch the local wildlife, and spending time with his family.\n\nBill was a wonderful granddad, and every Christmas he dressed up like Santa Claus (he had the natural build for it!), complete with the bells and all! He also loved to pretend he was a monkey and chase the kids around the house, sending them scattering and screaming! They were scared, but they always begged him to do it again!\n\nThat was Bill, though, such a big, fun-loving man, who was a big, beloved presence in the lives of everyone who knew him.\n\nBill sadly died on Thursday, October 11, 2007, at the age of 87.\n\nBill was such a wonderful man, who lived a wonderful life, a life of hard work and loyal service, a loving family and fond memories. Bill was a husband, father, grandfather and friend, and a man known not just for his hands, but for his humor and his heart. He will be greatly missed.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife Margery Gibson in 1990 and by a daughter Michele McCamman in 1996. Members of his family include 3 children: Carolyn Doornhaag and Holly Gibson both of Paw Paw and John Gibson, Jr. of Kalamazoo; 6 grandchildren, 3 great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Cremation will take place and there will be no visitation. A Life Story memorial service will be held Tuesday, 11:00 AM at the LIFE STORY FUNERAL HOME, Betzler, Kalamazoo 375-2900 followed with food and fellowship at Oshtemo United Methodist Church.
