        "text": "Cath is a girl residing in the Intercontinental, Freeside. Her partner is Bruce.\n\nDescription[]\n\nShe is young with brownish hair, a long body and an artificial melanin-boosted tan (but not one of the Paris jobs) that formed freckles. She seems to be bisexual.\n\nWhen she came to the Emergency, she wore a black shift and a tiny leather purse on a slender neck-thong. Her nails, bitten to the quick, were bright pink against her tan.\n\nBackground[]\n\nShe and Bruce form 3Jane's party circuit and has friendship with her bodyguard, Hideo. One time he tried to show her how to make an origami crane but she never could make it right; he offered one to her which she kept in her bag. 3Jane told her that the Villa Straylight is a real pretty castle, all stone and sunsets, with pools and lilies.\n\nOne time they returned to earth, she visited the Sense/Net Pyramid; it was bad because it was a day after the Sons of Christ the King had put angel in the water (actually being an operation of the Panther Moderns); there she saw Tally Isham in close who smiled, and took shots of her. She taped 5 cibachrome transparencies of her across the glass of the balcony in their hotel room.\n\nOne day she saw a man with a woman in the hotel; the woman, whom she fancied, reminded her of Hideo in her walking.\n\nNeuromancer[]\n\nLater that day she was bathing in the pool at the rooftop garden and noticed again that man sitting nearby. Still wet, she approached, squatting beside his chair to talk with him, asking if he is a gangster. He said that his name is Lupus, and asking about his name, she was told it is Greek. He said that he isn't a gangster, but a drug addict to stimulants. She leaned closer asking if he has any; Lupus said that lacking drugs is his problem and asked where he could find any. She asked his taste, and suggested Betaphenethylamine if he could afford it.\n\nWhile Case was talking with Bruce, he noticed her Tally Isham prints and she boasted that she shot them herself, saying it was after the Christ the King terrs had put angel in the water, without knowing that Case had cooperated in that operation of the Panther Moderns; feeling uneasy, Case agreed it was terrible.\n\nLater Bruce and Cath had a shower when Lupus again showed up asking for help. He asked Bruce to take him to an address and Cath, listening from the shower, shouted cheerfully that he indeed was a gangster. The three rode Bruce's Honda trike to an unnamed Freeside nightclub to find a friend. The drive had dried her wet hair, and craning over Bruce's shoulder asked Lupus if he was expected. She told him to go to the lowest level to find his friend's cubicle, if they let him in.\n\nWhen Lupus returned, Bruce asked how it was, and told him to try it sometime. Cath unhappily said he doesn't seem like the guy who goes for the meat puppets, and thumbed a dermadisk against her wrist. They dropped him to the bars down Rue Jules Verne.\n\nInstead of going home she made Bruce drop her off at a shop and bought a black shift. She entered the Emergency and saw Lupus whom she greeted and showed him the shift, running her palm across the fabric. She came close to him, and Case felt her heat and tension, and asked if he liked the beta. He said that the comedown was difficult and she offered him more, inviting him to a place on the hill behind the Paradise, as its owners left for Earth on business; she took his hand between hers, and asked him if he is a gaijin soldierman for the Yakuza, and how come he still had all his fingers; she also asked if the woman with with him likes it with girls; she reminded her of Hideo, and said about her friendship with 3Jane.\n\nShe squirmed against Lupus as he put his hand on her hip and exposed flesh. Taking a half-failed look of modesty, she said that she and Bruce make 3Jane's party circuit whenever she gets out of the villa. She snuggled in and offered Lupus a derm to \"be together\"; as she pulled it from her purse, an origami crane made by Hideo fell out. She peeled and smoothed the derm across Lupus's inner wrist, who asked about the looks of 3Jane. Once it affected him, she took his hand to go to the villa up the hill and stay all night. Lupus looked at her, dropped her hand and ran for the door. She screamed behind him, calling him ripoff shit."
