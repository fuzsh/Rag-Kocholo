        "text": "James Gibson knows how to try a lawsuit.\n\nA dogged trial lawyer, James has a diverse practice and significant courtroom experience. He develops complex cases, takes them to the courthouse, and works in a cost-efficient and results-oriented manner. James has tried or arbitrated one or more cases every year since 2014—experience that sets him apart from his contemporaries in the era of the \"vanishing trial.\"\n\nWhen a defense verdict isn’t the ultimate goal, James also knows how to quickly develop pressure points in a case that can limit its value and lead to a quick and cost-effective settlement. In any scenario, he takes great pride in learning the nuances of a client’s business and using that knowledge as a strategic benefit throughout the litigation process.\n\nJames’ practice focuses on product liability, medical malpractice and consumer fraud defense, but he deftly handles cases across the litigation spectrum and in venues around the country. Over the years, he has tried cases involving profound personal injuries, tragic wrongful deaths and alleged consumer fraud leading to millions of dollars in claimed damages. He thrives on the demands and pressures of high-stakes litigation and works tirelessly to promote the desired result in the most stressful of environments. He also assists clients by offering on-site employee training on best practices for lawsuit prevention.\n\nJames stays involved at Lightfoot in multiple ways. He is the Chair of the firm’s Innovation Committee, which works to bring cutting-edge technologies to the forefront of client service. He is also a member of the firm’s Recruiting Committee and a former Chair of the Summer Associate Program. Away from his legal practice, James is the proud husband to another Birmingham lawyer and father to two young sons, Andrew and Thomas. He serves on the Board of Directors at the Horizons School, a residential school providing social and career independence to young adults with learning disabilities. He is also an avid sports fan and active musician. James is a member of Red Mountain Church, where he can often be found playing a Gibson (no relation) guitar on Sundays."
