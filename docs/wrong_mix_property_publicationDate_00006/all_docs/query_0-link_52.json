        "text": "BAFTA Award-nominee Callum Turner (Masters of the Air, The Boys in the Boat) is joining Neuromancer, a new 10-episode drama based on the sci-fi novel of the same name by William Gibson.\n\nCreated for television by Graham Roland (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan) and JD Dillard (The Outsider), Neuromancer follows a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case (Turner) who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high stakes crime with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes, aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets.\n\nNeuromancer was Gibson’s debut novel that earned a Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award. It served as the first book in the Sprawl trilogy and was followed by Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive.\n\nThe series will be a co-production between Skydance Television, Anonymous Content and Apple Studios. It will also be produced by Drake’s DreamCrew Entertainment, with Roland serving as showrunner and Dillard set to direct the pilot episode.\n\nNeuromancer will be executive produced by Roland and Dillard, alongside David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Matt Thunell for Skydance Television; Anonymous Content; Drake, Adel ‘Future’ Nur and Jason Shrier for DreamCrew Entertainment; Zack Hayden and Gibson.\n\nTurner is repped by WME, Curtis Brown Group and Johnson, Shapiro, Slewett & Kole."
