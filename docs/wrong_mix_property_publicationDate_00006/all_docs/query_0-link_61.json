        "text": "The Fantasy Review’s list of 9 Awesome Science Fiction Books For Fans of Neuromancer by William Gibson.\n\nNoor by Nnedi Okorafor\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nAnwuli Okwudili prefers to be called AO. To her, these initials have always stood for Artificial Organism. AO has never really felt…natural, and that’s putting it lightly. Her parents spent most of the days before she was born praying for her peaceful passing because even in-utero she was “wrong”. But she lived. Then came the car accident years later that disabled her even further. Yet instead of viewing her strange body the way the world views it, as freakish, unnatural, even the work of the devil, AO embraces all that she is: A woman with a ton of major and necessary body augmentations. And then one day she goes to her local market and everything goes wrong.…\n\nTitanium Noir (Titanium Noir, #1) by Nick Harkaway\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nCal Sounder is a detective working for the police on certain very sensitive cases. So when he’s called in to investigate a homicide at a local apartment, he’s surprised by the routineness of it all. But when he arrives on scene, Cal soon learns that the victim—Roddy Tebbit, an otherwise milquetoast techie—is well over seven feet tall. And although he doesn’t look a day over thirty, he is ninety-one years old. Tebbit is a Titan—one of this dystopian, near-future society’s genetically altered elites. And this case is definitely Cal’s thing.…\n\nSynners by Pat Cadigan\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nSynners are synthesizers – not machines, but people. They take images from the brains of performers, and turn them into a form which can be packaged, sold and consumed. This book is set in a world where new technology spawns new crime before it hits the streets.…\n\nIron Prince (Warformed: Stormweaver, #1) by Bryce O’Connor & Luke Chmilenko\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nReidon Ward will become a god. He doesn’t know it yet, of course. Reidon was born weak, sickly and small. Afflicted with a painful disease and abandoned by his parents because of it, he has had to fight tooth and nail for every minor advantage life has allowed him.…\n\nWomb City by Tlotlo Tsamaase\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nNelah seems to have it all: fame, wealth, and a long-awaited daughter growing in a government lab. But, trapped in a loveless marriage to a policeman who uses a microchip to monitor her every move, Nelah’s perfect life is precarious. After a drug-fueled evening culminates in an eerie car accident, Nelah commits a desperate crime and buries the body, daring to hope that she can keep one last secret.…\n\nRed Team Blues (Martin Hench #1) by Cory Doctorow\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nMartin Hench is 67 years old, single, and successful in a career stretching back to the beginnings of Silicon Valley. He lives and roams California in a very comfortable fully-furnished touring bus, The Unsalted Hash, that he bought years ago from a fading rock star. He knows his way around good food and fine drink. He likes intelligent women, and they like him back often enough.…\n\nThe Jinn-Bot of Shantiport by Samit Basu\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nShantiport was supposed to be a gateway to the stars. But the city is sinking, and its colonist rulers aren’t helping anyone but themselves.\n\nLina, a daughter of failed revolutionaries, has no desire to escape Shantiport. She loves her city and would do anything to save its people. This is, in fact, the plan for her life, made before she was even born….\n\nReady Player One (Ready Player One, #1) by Ernest Cline\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nA world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready?\n\nIn the year 2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual world where most of humanity spends their days.\n\nWhen the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself.…\n\nJunkyard Cats (Junkyard Cats, #1) by Faith Hunter\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nAfter the Final War, after the appearance of the Bug Aliens and their enforced peace, Shining Smith is still alive, still doing business from the old junkyard bequeathed to her by her father. But Shining is no longer human, and the junkyard is no longer just a scrapyard, but a place full of secrets that she has guarded for years.…\n\nRelated to: 9 Awesome Science Fiction Books For Fans of Neuromancer"
