        "text": "“Freshly imagined, compellingly detailed, and chilling in its implications.”—The New York Times\n\nPersonally signed by William Gibson. Neuromancer is the 1984 novel that launched the cyberpunk movement within the science fiction literary genre.\n\nEaston Press. Norwalk, CT. William Gibson \"Neuromancer\" Signed Limited Edition. No jacket as issued. Full genuine leather covers with gilt details. All edges gilt. Includes unattached bookplate and Easton Press Certificate of Authenticity along with collector's notes. Sealed in the original shrink-wrap.\n\nNeuromancer is the 1984 science fiction masterpiece—a classic that ranks as one of the twentieth century’s most potent visions of the future.\n\nConsidered one of the earliest and best-known works in the cyberpunk genre, it is the only novel to win the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award. It was Gibson's debut novel and the beginning of the Sprawl trilogy. Set in the future, the novel follows Henry Case, a washed-up hacker hired for one last job, which brings him up against a powerful artificial intelligence.\n\nNEUROMANCER\n\nThe definitive cyberpunk novel, William Gibson's Neuromancer is a science-fiction masterpiece that ranks as one of the twentieth century's most potent visions of the future. First published as a paperback original in 1984, several years before the Internet was commonplace, William Gibson showed us the Matrix — a world within the world, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace. Neuromancer is the story of Henry Dorsett Case, once the sharpest data-thief in the Matrix, until an ex-employer crippled his nervous system. Now a new employer has recruited him for a last chance run against an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence.\n\nNeuromancer was the first fully-realized glimpse of humankind’s digital future — a shocking vision that has challenged our assumptions about technology and ourselves, reinvented the way we speak and think, and forever altered the landscape of our imaginations.\n\nThe novel is the first in history to win the Nebula, the Hugo, and the Philip K. Dick Award for paperback original, and the Mail & Guardian described this achievement as \"the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker, and Pulitzer in the same year.\" By 2007, it had sold more than 6.7 million copies, and it remains one of the most honored works of science-fiction in recent history. Time magazine included it on their list of 100 Best English-Language Novels Written Since 1923, remarking, \"There is no way to overstate how radical Neuromancer was when it first appeared.\"\n\nNeuromancer ushers us into a dystopian world, exposing the dark side of a culture inextricably linked to computer technology with a keen prophecy that endures.\n\nWilliam Gibson is credited with having coined the term “cyberspace” and having envisioned both the Internet and virtual reality before either existed. He is the author of Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Virtual Light, Idoru, All Tomorrow’s Parties, Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, Zero History, Distrust That Particular Flavor, and The Peripheral. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, with his wife.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nWilliam Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as cyberpunk. Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a \"combination of lowlife and high tech\"—and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson coined the term \"cyberspace\" for \"widespread, interconnected digital technology\" in his short story \"Burning Chrome\" (1982), and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel Neuromancer (1984). These early works of Gibson's have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature in the 1980s.\n\nAfter expanding on the story in Neuromancer with two more novels (Count Zero in 1986, and Mona Lisa Overdrive in 1988), thus completing the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre known as steampunk.\n\nIn the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following the turn of the century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His most recent novels, The Peripheral (2014) and Agency (2020), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction themes.\n\nIn 1999, The Guardian described Gibson as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades\", while The Sydney Morning Herald called him the \"noir prophet\" of cyberpunk. Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 12 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians. His work has been cited as influencing a variety of disciplines: academia, design, film, literature, music, cyberculture, and technology.\n\nPhoto © Michael O’Shea.\n\nFeatures\n\nIncludes all the classic Easton Press qualities:\n\n* Premium Leather\n\n* Silk Moire Endleaves\n\n* Distinctive Cover Design\n\n* Hubbed Spine, Accented in Real 22KT Gold\n\n* Satin Ribbon Page Marker\n\n* Gilded Page Edges\n\n* Long-lasting, High Quality Acid-neutral Paper\n\n* Smyth-sewn Pages for Strength and Durability\n\n* Beautiful Illustrations\n\nReviews\n\nPraise for Neuromancer"
