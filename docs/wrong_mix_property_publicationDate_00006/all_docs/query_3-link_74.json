        "text": "When Valeria did make the permanent move to Great Falls in 1894, she joined Paris in residing in a suite of rooms on the third floor of the Park Hotel. She remained a quiet and solitary figure from the public until the end of her days. On August 18th, 1900, at age 60, Valeria died. The Great Falls Leader was subtle and vague in the description of her death, as a possible kindness to the grieving family:\n\nMRS. GIBSON DEAD.\n\nSuccumbed This Morning After Long Years of Suffering\n\nFuneral Tomorrow Afternoon\n\nMrs. Valeria Gibson, the wife of the Honorable Paris Gibson, the founder of Great Falls, died at her rooms in the Park Hotel at 3:30 [am]. Mrs. Gibson had been invalid for 30 years, and the past year had been in such feeble health that her death was expected at any moment. By an unfortunate accident last night, she received a shock that hastened the end by a few days.\n\nGreat Falls Leader, August 18, 1900\n\nOther newspapers, such as The Missoulian, the Billings Weekly Gazette, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, MN and The Fergus County Argus (below) told the brutal truth:\n\nMRS. PARIS GIBSON DEAD.\n\nGreat Falls, August 18 – While temporarily insane, Mrs. Valeria G. Gibson leaped from the window of her room on the third floor of the Park Hotel in this city about 11:30 last night, alighting on the pavement below. She sustained sever injuries from which she died 4 hours later.\n\nMrs. Gibson was the wife of Paris Gibson, the founder of Great Falls. She has been an invalid for several years and has been confined to her room in the hotel, which was conducted by her son. She has been under the care of two nurses day and night, but during their absence from the room last night she forced the screen from the window and leaped out. Her injuries were not of a fatal nature, but the shock upon her system, in its weak condition, caused her death. The funeral will be held tomorrow afternoon at 2 o’clock.\n\nFergus County Argus, August 22, 1900, p. 1\n\nThough her physical time in Great Falls was brief, she made a lasting impression on its citizens:\n\nTHE LAST SAD RITES\n\nBeautiful services over the remains of Mrs. Paris Gibson\n\nThe Funeral of the late Mrs. Valeria Goodenow Gibson occurred yesterday afternoon from the family residence at 402 Fourth avenue north. The casket containing the remains of the venerated and loved dead was placed in the front parlors, and was literally buried beneath rich and beautiful floral offerings sent as a last tribute of love and respect for her who had passed to her reward.\n\nThe beautiful services of the Episcopal church were read, after which appropriate sacred music was rendered by those present.\n\nThe casket was then placed in a hearse and taken to Highland cemetery for internment, followed by perhaps the largest concourse of people ever attending a funeral service in this city. And thus closed the life on earth of an affectionate wife and a loving mother.\n\nIn his loss Mr. Gibson and the members of his family have the sincere and earnest sympathy of the people of Great Falls and of Montana.\n\nGreat Falls Tribune, August 20, 1900\n\nThis is all I have been able to find on Valeria, through the efforts of others, myself and the Gibson descendants. Many have speculated on her life and death and now I’d like to give you, my interpretation:\n\nI see a wonderful woman who believed in her husband, who raised 4 children while burying 2 others. She did her best as her husband made and lost 2 fortunes before finding lasting success. She became ill or pained, not only physically, but I believe at heart as well sometime during their time living in Minneapolis. She helped spread education and an appreciation for literature and art in the best way she could. Her family loved her, protected her and took joy in her presence. And at the end of her life, when she saw that her family was safe, secure, and having successful lives of their own, she decided she had done enough and could have her final rest. Nothing nefarious, nothing elaborate, but a beautiful person who struggled in life much like the rest of us."
