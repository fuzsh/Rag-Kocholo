        "text": "Dr. Bill J. Gibson\n\nDr. Bill Gibson was born in Charleston, WV, and grew up on Frame Road in Elkview. He graduated salutatorian from Herbert Hoover High School in 1968 and married his high school sweetheart, Mary Good (HHHS ‘68), in 1970. Their son, William, was born in 1971 in Morgantown where Bill attended WVU and received his BA degree in Chemistry in 1972. He was accepted to WVU School of Dentistry and completed his DDS degree in 1976. Dr. Bill worked as an associate with Dr. Robert Harris in Ripley, WV, for one year following his graduation.\n\nDue to their love of West Virginia and the Elk River area, Dr. Bill and Mary decided to return to their hometown and establish a private practice in 1977. They were able to obtain the property across from what is now Elkview Middle School. Tony Engle built the original building during the summer of 1977, and the first patient was seen on September 23rd of that year. The family, with son Will, lived in one of the apartments over the office for a while. Daughter Heather was born in 1978 and, after lots of number crunching, the family purchased their home in Pinch in 1979, where the children grew up and Dr. Bill and Mary still reside.\n\nDr. Bill and Mary are active members of Mt. Calvary Baptist Church on Bigley Avenue in Charleston. They host a weekly Bible study Life Group connected with Mt. Calvary and both are active in the Gideon International Organization where they distribute God’s word. Dr. Bill and Mary have gone on several dental mission trips where he has relieved the pain of patients in Guatemala, Ukraine, and Togo, Africa.\n\nThe Gibson’s enjoy their children and grandchildren who live in the area. They are kept busy following their granddaughters’ sports and school activities, and love introducing their grandson to new adventures. The area of Canaan Valley, WV, draws them frequently to hike, bike, and simply unwind. The couple are deeply grateful to the people of Elk River for allowing the practice to provide care for their dental needs, They say, “We have been blessed beyond our wildest dreams.”\n\nDr. William J. Gibson\n\nDr. Will Gibson was born in Morgantown, WV and raised in the Pinch, WV. He attended local schools and graduated in 1989 from Herbert Hoover HS. Will was also active in Boy Scouts throughout his youth and earned his Eagle Scout in 1989. He attended WVUIT earning degrees in both Chemical Engineering and Chemistry in 1994. After working for a about year, he realized engineering was not his life’s calling and went to WVU to pursue a career in dentistry. While in Morgantown, Will met and married the love of his life Susan in 2000. After graduating in 2001, he did a one year Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency at CAMC and then began practicing in Elkview with the family in 2002.\n\nWill and Susan have two wonderful daughters and a son: Jordan, Alyssa, and Zachary. Will has participated in medical mission trips to Honduras and Haiti with River Ridge Church. Will enjoys spending time with his family in the outdoors and serving at River Ridge Church.\n\nDr. Heather D. Gibson\n\nDr. Heather graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in 1996 and went on to receive a degree in Dental Hygiene from WVUIT (2000); followed by an M.S. in Dental Hygiene from WVU (2002). She worked for Dr. Gibson as a dental hygienist for 3 years, as well as a part-time adjunct instructor at the WVUIT Dental Hygiene Department. Dr. Heather graduated from the WVU School of Dentistry in 2010 and returned home to work alongside her father and brother. Mission work has also been a passion of Heather’s and has taken her to Guatemala and Haiti several times. Her last trip was to India, where she provided dental care for girls that had been rescued from sex trafficking. She also volunteers locally at Cross Roads Pregnancy Care Center and Health Right Dental Clinic.\n\nDr. Heather married her husband, JC, in April of 2016. He is also a WVU alum. They recently moved to Pinch, where they live with their chocolate Labrador Retriever, Beyla. In their spare time they enjoy travelling and spending time in the mountains of West Virginia. Dr. Heather is a member of the WVDA and ADA. Since Dr. Heather has a dental hygiene background, you will find that she values optimal oral hygiene and preventive dentistry."
