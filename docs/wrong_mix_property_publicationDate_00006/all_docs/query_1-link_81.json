The family moved to Clay Co WV about 1854 but moved back to Buchanan Co Va before 1860. After the civil war they returned to Clay Co WV and are found in the 1870 and 1880 Clay Co WV cenus. No two records agree on the year of birth for either Thomas or Matilda, with Thomas ranging between about 1819 and 1827, Matilda's recorded ages would put her nirth between about 1825 and 1835. Because of the marriage date it would seem that neit her Thomas nor Matilda were likely to have been born later than 1819.\n\nPer: M ichael Henline\n\nI have always found William Gibson and Merredmon/Marrimon McGee in the same locations.\n\nWilliam Gibson married #1.

Is this Malchi on the Pike Co., KY census related to the Malachi, son of Richard you mentioned? I show a Malachi Deale married Elizabeth Stacey 12-4-1786 Chowan Co., NC. Perhaps the fact that his name is Malachi may be a coincedence because these Deal families in Pike Co., Ky appear to be connected to the John Anderson Dial family in Cabell Co., VA. John Anderson was the son of James Dial b. 1736 Ireland who was in Halifax Co., VA later in his life. The problem is that there is a Richard Deal in 1809 in Floyd? Co., Ky who was \"released from Paying levies now and in future\". Could this Richard Deal be connected to the Richard Deal you mentioned who was b. 1730?\n\nI believe also living in the household of William Deal is Willoughby (Willis) Deal who married Rebecca Lester. I believe Willoughby is a brother to Joiner. Both Willoughby and Joiner witnessed the marriage of John Lester & Ruth Yates in Pike Co., KY in 1830. Joiner Dial later lives next door to Thomas Dial in the actual 1850 Cabell Co., VA census. Thomas and Polly (Mary) Dial were in household 463. Joiner and Lucy Dial are in household 464 and John (Thomas's brother) and Caroline are in household 465. There is a girl, Caroline, age 5, who shows in Joiner's household, but she is actually the daughter of Thomas and Mary. She is listed out of order in Joiner's household. Also in Joiner's household is William Ellington, age 80. Joiner fits into the John Anderson Dial family. In the 1850 Cabell Co., VA census, John Anderson Dial and his wife, Mary Ann Sprinkle are living in household 465 with their son John. So here we have Joiner living between two brothers, Thomas and John. The fact that two nearest neighbors in a remote region just happen to share the same last name is a little too coincedental to be regarded as mere coincedence. This would link William Deal of Pike Co. with the John Anderson Dial family in Cabell Co. If Joiner who was the son of William is the nearest neighbor of Thomas who was the son of John Anderson, the fact that he is the nearest neighbor obviously establishes some sort of connection.\n\nI believe Willoughby (Willis) and Joiner who were in Floyd and Pike Co. KY may be brothers and may be the sons of William b. 1772. I also believe that William b. 1772 may be the brother of John Anderson Dial b. 1769 whose family was in Cabell Co., VA in the early 1800's. John Anderson was the son of James Dial b. 1732 out of Halifax Co., VA.\n\nThe first known ancestor in the Deel lineage was David Deel, Born in Germany,came to America on the ship\"Favorite\"-Captain Nicholaus Volans from Hamburg, Germany. David move to Washington Co.,Virginia from eastern Virginia,then to Russell Co., Virginia, on to Levisa River,then to Buchanan Co., Virginia.\n\nThe first known ancestor in my Deel lineage was David Deel, born in\n\nGermany, came to America on the ship \"Favorite\", Captain Nicholaus Volans\n\nfrom Hamburg , Germany. David moved to Washington Co Va from eastern Va\n\nthen to Russell Co Va, on Levisa River, now known as Buchanan Co. When he\n\ncame to this country his namewas \"David Diel\". He married Elizabeth\n\nColeman, thought to have been full blooded Cheorkee indian.\n\nLESTER Family\n\nParents of Rebecca Lester are\n\nWilliam Calvin Gillford Lester born abt 1770 Montgomery Co VA died abt 1843 Tazewell Co VA\n\nRachel Rebecca (Skaggs) Bishop born abt 1770 VA\n\nWilliam owned land on the Big Sandy River in Logan & Tazewell Co. in Va.\n\nAlsohad land near what is now Mohawk, WVa."
