        "text": "Our Dad died during the most vibrantly colored and beautiful Fall we have seen in years. Gene William Gibson (January 1, 1943-October 27, 2021) breathed his last in the early morning hours of October 27th 2021 in Sagle, Idaho with his wife Judy and daughters Gena and Jan by his side. His 25-year excruciating battle with cancer has finally ended and he is resting in the sweet and loving arms of his personal savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nEverywhere he went, our Dad was best known as the man with the moustache. For well over 50 years, his fabulous facial hair started conversations, incited unplanned photos and in general, brought people into his life whose paths might not otherwise have crossed. There was shock, delight and laughter generated by his carefully coffered facial hair. Plus, Dad never met a stranger. Every person was a long-lost acquaintance, an old school pal, a distant relative, or a new-found friend. All people were special to him, and he loved to engage in a swapping of life experiences and stories. Especially stories about his favorite things, fishing, hunting, guns, and his abundant love of the outdoors.\n\nGene had two noteworthy careers in his life. He worked with his master’s degree in agriculture science as a County Extension Agent for the University of Idaho in Twin Falls, Gooding, St. Maries and Sandpoint, Idaho. This career allowed him to be the great teacher and educator that he was, to farmers, ranchers, and lots of 4-H kiddos. He took out a short 10 years to run and operate a large swine farm in Shoshone, Idaho, where he and Judy raised their two girls in the best possible environment for exploring, learning, and generally having a great many adventures. But, over all these years, his greatest accomplishment in life, was his relationship with Jesus and his life-long ministry to pastors, congregations, and individuals alike.\n\nIt is impossible to encapsulate such a great life in such a short prose. Gene loved his Country, and he was willing to stand up and declare his beliefs and support his causes. He had strong and conservative beliefs. He valued our Constitution and the ideas laid down by our founding fathers. He was a lifetime member of the NRA and served as the Sandpoint Chapter President for several years. He was also a range master at the Sandpoint City Shooting Range and he taught classes to help others obtain their gun carrier permits. Our Dad did the things he loved, and he did it with a joyful and happy heart. He was almost never without a heartfelt smile.\n\nGene is survived by his wife of 57 years, Judy Gibson; two daughters and son-in law, Gena Gibson; Jan Korsten and Erick Korsten; and two granddaughters Macy and Marlee Korsten, all of Sagle, Idaho. He is also survived by two brothers, Chad Gibson of Homedale, Idaho, and Lynn (Bonnie) Gibson of Weiser Idaho.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, you are welcome to make a donation in Gene’s name to Master Minded Ministries at Masterminded.org\n\nWe, the family of Gene Gibson, shall miss him greatly and honor him in our memories every day. And, as it is written on the urn that holds his earthy remains, are the words from his favorite hymn, “It is well with my soul”."
