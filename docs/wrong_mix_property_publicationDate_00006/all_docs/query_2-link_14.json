        "text": "GIBSON HOUSE (Holland Family renters*) - 1920\n\nLeft to right: Alonza 1871-1952,\n\nLina (Canady)1885-1947 holding Iva,\n\nClarence, Beatrice, Marie, Lila Mae and Haywood.\n\nDemolished in the late 1970s, the Gibson House was located at 302 Main Street on the northeast corner of Main and Elm Streets--now site of First Citizens Bank.\n\nThe house, unique with its flushed chimney, was built about the same time and similar to the Ringware House , diagonally across the street on the southwest corner.\n\nBuilt between 1771 and 1778 by John McCullough or Ezekiel Hunter, both of whom had owned the lot, the two-story, four-bay structure was home to members of the Gibson family for over 150 years.\n\nGIBSON HOUSE - Photo circa 1940s\n\nFamily album photographs included in this post are courtesy of Arizona resident Ora Smith. Ora descended from Susan \"Caroline\" Gibson who married the Reverend John F. Mattocks; Ora Smith was named after their first child Ora DeVaine Mattocks born in Swansboro 27 April 1861.\n\nA 1920 photo from Mel Guss shows Holland family renters on the front porch. *(photo above) Left to right: Alonza 1871-1952, Lina (Canady)1885-1947 holding Iva, Clarence, Beatrice , Marie, Lila Mae and Haywood. Alonza Deene (Riggs) Holland was born in Swansboro, son of Everette Riggs and Caroline Watson.\n\nThe old Gibson family land near Maysville was first acquired by a 1751 land grant to William Gibson 1720-1788, husband of Mary Barclift. On this land, near the Jones County line, where the White Oak River Road meets Gibson Branch Road and Gibson Bridge Road, Gibson built what was called the \"White Oak Plantation.\" He was a carpenter and built the first Onslow County courthouse.\n\nAt some point the Gibson family had to sell their property. However, the land was brought back into Gibson hands when William J. Gibson purchased it between 1835-1837.\n\nThe \"White Oak Plantation\" home no longer exists. The Gibson cemetery, on private property off Gibson Branch Road, has only one readable headstone--that of Susannah, wife of William J. Gibson."
