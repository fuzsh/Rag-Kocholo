        "text": "NEW ALBANY, IN (WAVE)- Deep, dark, and disturbing were the details coming from a woman who knew suspected serial killer William Clyde Gibson. He is accused of murdering three women.\n\nKelly Bailey has a reason for knowing Gibson, she is Gibson's former girlfriend.\n\n\"He wanted to try bank robbery, auto theft, rape and murder,\" Bailey said.\n\nThe gruesome allegation against William Clyde Gibson came as no surprise to Bailey. Dating Gibson in 1999 and 2000, she said she met him after getting out of rocky marriage.\n\n\"I guess maybe that's why he came into my life maybe he thought he could pull something over on me,\" she said.\n\nBailey broke up with Gibson after being frustrated with a man she said was an alcoholic, addicted to drugs and involved with crime.\n\n\"When he took the rent money and started getting high off it and I said 'I'm not going to deal with it anymore' and that's when I called it quits.\" she said.\n\nShe said Gibson was verbally and physically abusive to her, she recalled one of his violent spells.\n\n\"He starts hitting me, tries to knock me out,\" she recalled. \"Hit me in the mouth bunch of times. Wouldn't even give me an answer of why he was doing this.\"\n\nBailey said she fought back many times but, she said she thinks about the women who couldn't. Thirteen years later, Gibson is charged with capital murder for allegedly killing three women over a 10-year span. Gibson is charged with murdering Stephanie Kirk, the woman found buried in his backyard in April. He has also been charged with murder in the deaths of 75-year-old Christine Whitis a family friend found dead inside Gibson's home on April 19, and 44-year-old Karen Hodella in October 2002.\n\n\"It's hard telling how many women he's actually done this to,\" Bailey said. \"We will never know about.\"\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty against Gibson. In a letter sent to WAVE 3, Gibson told us he offered to plead guilty and take the death penalty. Bailey hopes to see it differently.\n\n\"To him in his mind he would win if they put him to death in the death penalty.\" Bailey said. \"It's best to put him as life without parole. And then he would suffer for what he's done.\"\n\nYears later, she still has a sculpture carved out of wood that Gibson made for her. It is an eerie reminder of the man she once cared for.\n\n\"I put this back behind me back from 2001 and I've had to come back to it,\" Bailey said. \"I never dreamed that I would have to come back to this.\"\n\nGibson's trial is expected to start in August. Bailey said she plans on seeing it through."
