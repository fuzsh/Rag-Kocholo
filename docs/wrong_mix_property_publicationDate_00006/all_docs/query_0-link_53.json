        "text": "Following a years-long development process, Apple will officially make a TV series based on William Gibson’s acclaimed sci-fi novel Neuromancer.\n\nThe tech giant and streamer has handed out a 10-episode series order to the drama based on the 1984 cyberpunk novel that launched Gibson’s career and the so-called Sprawl trilogy that also includes novels Count Zero (1986) and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988).\n\nDark Winds creator Graham Roland and J.D. Dillard (The Twilight Zone) created the series for television. The series, a co-production between Skydance Television and Anonymous Content, will see Roland serve as showrunner with Dillard on board to direct the pilot.\n\nApple says Neuromancer revolves around a “damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high stakes crime with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes, aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets.”\n\n“We’re incredibly excited to be bringing this iconic property to Apple TV+,” said creators and executive producers Roland and Dillard. “Since we became friends nearly 10 years ago, we’ve looked for something to team up on, so this collaboration marks a dream come true. Neuromancer has inspired so much of the science fiction that’s come after it and we’re looking forward to bringing television audiences into Gibson’s definitive ‘cyberpunk’ world.”\n\nRoland and Dillard will exec produce the series alongside Skydance TV’s Dana Goldberg and Matt Thunell, Drake’s DreamCrew Entertainment’s Adel “Future” Nur and Jason Shrier and Zack Hayden and author Gibson.\n\nNeuromancer is Apple’s latest collaboration with Skydance TV, joining sci-fi drama Foundation, The Big Door Prize, and the untitled Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson comedy series from David West Read.\n\nApple also has a prolific relationship with Anonymous Content, with the company also collaborating on Jessica Chastain vehicle The Savant, Taika Waititi’s Time Bandits, Alfonso Cuarón’s Disclaimer; The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, Dickinson and Defending Jacob.\n\nNeuromancer has had a troubled development history, with several attempts at a film (and one video game) fizzling before they could get off the ground. Deadpool director Tim Miller most recently tried to helm an adaption for Fox back in 2017."
