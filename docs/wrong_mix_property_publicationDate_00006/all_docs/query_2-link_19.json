        "text": "1948: William Gibson is born in Conway, South Carolina. He later blossoms into legend with the prize-winning fiction that gives the world the term cyberspace.\n\nThe death of his father and a move to rural Wytheville, Virginia, propelled Gibson at age 6 to withdraw into his books, especially science fiction. In the 2000 documentary No Maps for These Territories, he called this his \"native literary culture.\"\n\nThe speculative, experimental novels of William S. Burroughs in particular changed Gibson's perception of what sci-fi could achieve. Through dissatisfaction with his remote environs, he was already attempting to create artificial ones more suitable to his hungry mind and heavy heart.\n\nAfter the sudden death of his mother, Gibson dropped out of his boarding school in Arizona at 18 and set off in search of solace in a 1960s awash in counterculture. Haunting California and Europe, he eventually landed in Canada to avoid a Vietnam draft call that never came — probably because he admitted at his draft hearing that he was interested in taking every drug on Earth.\n\nWith the expired '60s behind him, Gibson married, fathered a child and, in 1977, earned a B.A. in English from the University of British Columbia. There, he widened his literary spectrum beyond sci-fi, turned on to postmodernity, and wrote his first short story, \"Fragments of Hologram Rose,\" which would later appear in his seminal 1982 short-story collection Burning Chrome.\n\nThe stories of Burning Chrome — particularly the title narrative, first published in Omni — married the noir and experimental aesthetics of Raymond Chandler and William S. Burroughs, among many others. He also mixed in a hefty dose of stylistic swagger inherent to the exploding punk and post-punk scenes of the late '70s and early '80s.\n\nThe stories prompted like-minded authors like Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, Lewis Shiner, Rudy Rucker and more to form a loose coalition known as the cyberpunk movement. That coalition would go on to renovate not just sci-fi, but speculative literature, science and even journalism, birthing such publications as Wired magazine and others.\n\nMost important, the story \"Burning Chrome\" marked the first appearance of the term cyberspace — which Gibson would later describe in No Maps for These Territories as an \"evocative and essentially meaningless\" buzzword that could serve as a cipher for all of his cybernetic musings.\n\nIt did that and more, going supernova in his foundational, award-winning debut novel of 1984, Neuromancer. Gibson's networked artificial environment anticipated the globally internetworked technoculture (and its surveillance) in which we now find ourselves.\n\nThe term has gone on to revolutionize popular culture and popular science, heralding the power and ubiquity of the information age we now regard as common as smartphones. Since its invention, \"cyberspace\" has come to represent everything from computers and information technology to the internet and \"consensual hallucinations\" as different as The Matrix, Total Information Awareness and reality TV.\n\nActivists Disrupt Amazon Conference Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n\nMembers of the activist group No Tech for Apartheid interrupted a senior Amazon executive's speech at a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday over the company's Project Nimbus cloud contract.\n\nWar Crime Prosecutions Enter a New Digital Age\n\nA custom platform developed by SITU Research aided the International Criminal Court’s prosecution in a war crimes trial for the first time. It could change how justice is enacted on an international scale.\n\nThe Future of Vaping After the Fall of Juul\n\nThis week, we talk to the hosts of the new podcast Backfired about how the e-cigarette industry got to where it is today and where it can go from here.\n\nAging Might Not Be Inevitable\n\nThere are biological underpinnings to aging—and so researchers are investigating cell manipulations, transfusions of young blood, and chemical compounds that can mimic low-calorie diets.\n\nAir So Polluted It Can Kill Isn’t Being Taken Seriously Enough\n\nToxic air kills over half a million children every year, yet only once has air pollution been listed as a cause of death on a death certificate.\n\nWith AI Tools, Scientists Can Crack the Code of Life\n\nGoogle’s AI research lab DeepMind is steadily building knowledge of how genes and their products work inside the body—and how and why they sometimes go wrong.\n\nWelcome to WIRED Travel\n\nDon't pack your bags without taking us along for the ride.\n\nThe Mystery of AI Gunshot-Detection Accuracy Is Finally Unraveling\n\nHow accurate are gunshot detection systems, really? For years, it's been a secret, but new reports from San Jose and NYC show these systems have operated well below their advertised accuracy rates."
