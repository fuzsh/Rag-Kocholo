He was State's Attorney of Windham County from 1929 to 1933; assistant secretary of the Vermont Senate from 1931 to 1933; and secretary of Senate from 1933 to 1940.[3]\n\nHe was appointed to the U.S. Senate on June 24, 1940 as a Republican to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father, Ernest W. Gibson. He served from June 24, 1940, to January 3, 1941, but did not run for election to fill the vacancy.[4] From January 1941 until May 1941, when he joined the Vermont National Guard, he was Executive Secretary of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies (the William Allen White committee) He served in the South Pacific during World War II as G-2 (Intelligence) with the 43d Infantry and from January 1943 until the end of the war in intelligence at the Pentagon; he was discharged as a colonel.\n\nIn 1946, Gibson challenged incumbent Governor Mortimer R. Proctor in the Republicans' gubernatorial primary. Gibson argued for change, saying \"Under this rule a relatively small clique of people choose governors nearly 10 years in advance, supporting them up a series of political steps to the highest office.\" [1] Gibson won the primary and was elected Governor in 1946, in what was called \"a repudiation by Vermont voters of political practices and traditions that have been long established – a rebellion, not against outright mismanagement and inefficiency in the state government at Montpelier, but rather against the inertia and lack of aggressiveness of administration policies.\" [2] Gibson resigned in 1950, when he was appointed by President Harry Truman as a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Vermont.[5]\n\nDeath[]\n\nGibson died in Brattleboro on November 4, 1969.
