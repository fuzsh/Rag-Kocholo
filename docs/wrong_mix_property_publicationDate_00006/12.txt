I'm looking for more information on James Conley (Conally) Sr. He served as a "Lookout" in the Burks Garden section of Tazewell County in 1776. Watching the indian trails along with 31 other men. ((Pendleton's History of Tazewell County & Southwest Virginia, PAGE 368

He owned 14 acres of land along "little sugar waters" branch of Walker Creek that he purchased on Dec. 24 1793 in what was then Montogery County. He was the father of James Conley that married Rachael Slobough in 1804 in Tazewell County. James Jr. was born in 1774 in Botetourt County. James Conley Sr. was born prior to 1755.

There is a "Sugar Run" Virginia and "Little Sugar Run" Virginia. These streams join near Virginia Rt 100 south of Prospecdale and north of Bane. My family purcahsed land on "Little Sugar Run" in 1792. This was James Conley Sr. These streams flow into Walker Creek and Walker Creek flows into New River.

E.E. Gibson 29, of Sproul on Davis Creek was shot and killed yesterday afternoon by George Hill 25, of Sproul, during an argument between the two men at Hill's home, state police said following an investigation. Gibson received the full charge of a shotgun in the abdomen and died almost instantly. Dr. Williams F. work county coroner who investigated the shooting said yesterday afternoon. Hill was arrested at his home by Serg. Charles Carmen and George Skeen of the state police. He was taken to the county jail where he was booked on a charge of murder. Serg. Carmen said that Hill confessed to the shooting. The shooting occured Carmen said early yesterday afternoon. He said that earlier in the afternoon Hill, who was a brother-in-law of Gibson went to the latters home and asked Gibson to go out with him. Carmen reported that Gibson's wife said the two men appeared to be friendly at that time. He said that they went to Hill's home a little later and Hill started drinking, but that Gibson "took nothing to drink". After Hill had become intoxicated Carmen said he started an argument about differences which the men had about a week ago, and that Hill became enraged when Gibson would pay no attention to him. Carmen said that Hill then left Gibson sitting in the house, going outside got a shotgun and tried to shoot Gibson through the window but failed to hit him. Gibson he said then started to leave the house and was struck in the abdomen by another charge just as he was passing the corner of the house where Hill was waiting for him. He died almost instantly. Hill was arrested several hours later and brought to the county jail. He will be arraigned Monday evening before Justice of the peace H.B. Clay. Gibson is survived by his widow and three daughters.

Tazewell Marriages

1804

Samuel Lusk and Sara Bailey, Jan 5, 1804

William Suter and Rebecca Dills, Jan 10, 1804

Thomas Gibson and Polly Peery, Jan 10, 1804.

My Martin Gibson 'acquired' land which in deeds is referenced as formerly Elijah Bowman's land and then in 1831 he sells to James Hogg (who is married to Barbara Gentry) for $1.00. Martin's wife is named Elenor or Nelly.

Name: Martin GIBSON

Sex: M

Birth: 1776 in Orange Co., NC

Death: ABT 1831 in Perry Co., KY

Note:

He was bound to James Carrington in 1784 along with sisters Dicey and Susannah. He then traveled to Wilkes County, North Carolina for a time before settling in Floyd/Perry Co. Kentucky. There he gives his land to James Hogg for $1.00 for love and affection.

Decended from the prominent Melungeon Gibson's who were pioneer settlers of Kentucky and North Carolina. The family moved to Clay Co WV about 1854 but moved back to Buchanan Co Va before 1860. After the civil war they returned to Clay Co WV and are found in the 1870 and 1880 Clay Co WV cenus. No two records agree on the year of birth for either Thomas or Matilda, with Thomas ranging between about 1819 and 1827, Matilda's recorded ages would put her nirth between about 1825 and 1835. Because of the marriage date it would seem that neit her Thomas nor Matilda were likely to have been born later than 1819.

Per: M ichael Henline

I have always found William Gibson and Merredmon/Marrimon McGee in the same locations.

William Gibson married #1. Unknown at this time; married #2. Elizabeth Swinny Sweeney/Swiney/Swinney. This is the second marriage for both William and Elizabeth.

I always had Esquire as oldest son, info from Tazewell Co Va census 1850. Was William the same as Esquire or was he older and not listed in 1850 census with family. Matilda Davis was the 2nd wife of Martin JR. Where did you get your information that Martin Jr and Matilda Davis were the parents of William Gibson. What was William's birthdate?

The Malachi mentioned above appears to be the son of William. Is this Malchi on the Pike Co., KY census related to the Malachi, son of Richard you mentioned? I show a Malachi Deale married Elizabeth Stacey 12-4-1786 Chowan Co., NC. Perhaps the fact that his name is Malachi may be a coincedence because these Deal families in Pike Co., Ky appear to be connected to the John Anderson Dial family in Cabell Co., VA. John Anderson was the son of James Dial b. 1736 Ireland who was in Halifax Co., VA later in his life. The problem is that there is a Richard Deal in 1809 in Floyd? Co., Ky who was "released from Paying levies now and in future". Could this Richard Deal be connected to the Richard Deal you mentioned who was b. 1730?

I believe also living in the household of William Deal is Willoughby (Willis) Deal who married Rebecca Lester. I believe Willoughby is a brother to Joiner. Both Willoughby and Joiner witnessed the marriage of John Lester & Ruth Yates in Pike Co., KY in 1830. Joiner Dial later lives next door to Thomas Dial in the actual 1850 Cabell Co., VA census. Thomas and Polly (Mary) Dial were in household 463. Joiner and Lucy Dial are in household 464 and John (Thomas's brother) and Caroline are in household 465. There is a girl, Caroline, age 5, who shows in Joiner's household, but she is actually the daughter of Thomas and Mary. She is listed out of order in Joiner's household. Also in Joiner's household is William Ellington, age 80. Joiner fits into the John Anderson Dial family. In the 1850 Cabell Co., VA census, John Anderson Dial and his wife, Mary Ann Sprinkle are living in household 465 with their son John. So here we have Joiner living between two brothers, Thomas and John. The fact that two nearest neighbors in a remote region just happen to share the same last name is a little too coincedental to be regarded as mere coincedence. This would link William Deal of Pike Co. with the John Anderson Dial family in Cabell Co. If Joiner who was the son of William is the nearest neighbor of Thomas who was the son of John Anderson, the fact that he is the nearest neighbor obviously establishes some sort of connection.

I believe Willoughby (Willis) and Joiner who were in Floyd and Pike Co. KY may be brothers and may be the sons of William b. 1772. I also believe that William b. 1772 may be the brother of John Anderson Dial b. 1769 whose family was in Cabell Co., VA in the early 1800's. John Anderson was the son of James Dial b. 1732 out of Halifax Co., VA.

The first known ancestor in the Deel lineage was David Deel, Born in Germany,came to America on the ship"Favorite"-Captain Nicholaus Volans from Hamburg, Germany. David move to Washington Co.,Virginia from eastern Virginia,then to Russell Co., Virginia, on to Levisa River,then to Buchanan Co., Virginia.

from Hamburg , Germany. David moved to Washington Co Va from eastern Va

then to Russell Co Va, on Levisa River, now known as Buchanan Co. When he
