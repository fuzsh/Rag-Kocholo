THE HUGH GIBSON FAMILY

HUGH GIBSON AND JEAN (JANE) ORR GIBSON (My 3rd Great Grandparents)

Hugh 1790 – 1840 Jean 1798 – 1874

Our Gibson family came from Ayrshire, Scotland. Hugh Gibson and Jean (Jane) Orr married Nov 14, 1826. Hugh passed away Nov 19, 1840 in Scotland as well as a son, William, on Oct 30, 1840. The cause of death is unknown; perhaps a disease, since father and son passed within two weeks of one another. Hugh was born Feb 1790 and was a shepherd for Dalblair Farm, in 1835, and then moved to Ochiltree, Ayrshire, to work on the Carsten Farm. Jean was born Jean (Jane) Orr, on June 4, 1778, daughter of William and Janet (Hamilton) Orr, in Muirkirk, Ayrshire, Scotland. I found no record of Hugh’s parents.

NOTE: Jean (Jane) Orr Gibson’s sister, Margaret, married William Lambie on Dec 28, 1828 in Ayrshire, Scotland. They had a daughter, Jean Jane Lambie, who married John Napier in June 1866 in Cambusnethan, Scotland. Their daughter, Jessie Janet Napier married Edwin Delos Sutton on Jan 1, 1894 in Forest City, South Dakota. Jessie was born May 29, 1871 in North Platte, Nebraska and died March 27, 1940 in Hughes County, South Dakota. Edwin Delos Sutton was born April 7, 1865 in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, and died June 7, 1938 in Rochester, Minnesota.

Edwin and sister, Kate Delos Sutton

The following excerpts are from the Raymond Sutton Ranch family history:

Edwin’s sister Kate Sutton was born 1844 in Wisconsin. Edwin and his sister Kate, in 1883, staked out adjoining homesteads along the Missouri River. The wily pair built a duplex shanty straddling their tracts and lived on their respective claims, as required by law. With this strategy, each was able to “prove-up” a quarter sections. After Edwin had “proved-up” his 160-acre claim, he sold it, and with the capital began a lifetime of buying and selling cattle, horses, and land. In 1898, he and his wife, Jessie Napier Sutton, moved back to the Missouri River, not far from where he had first homesteaded and settled on 1,484 acres purchased from the Chicago based department store – Carson, Pirie, Scott, and Company. Edwin parlayed his holdings into one of the choicest ranches along the “Muddy Mo” by having the hands who worked for him “proved-up” on a quarter section of land each, while in his employ, and then they sold it to him. He and Jessie raised eight children, three of whom were to become the well-known Sutton Brothers – John, James, and Raymond.

Edwin raised horses and cattle, and in 1909, began his venture into the bison business to both conserve an endangered species and for profit. Also in 1909, horned Herefords came to the ranch. In 1916, the Sutton’s got into the purebred horse business with the purchase of five Percheron stallions. Raymond Sr. used to tell of a time when his father, Edwin, purchased a whole boxcar of draft stallions and told the boys that their summer project was to break them for sale in the fall. He recalled they started with a broke horse and an unbroken stallion and after one round of the field, unhitched the broke horse and put another unbroken one to plow.

After the demand for draft stock declined, the ranch’s focus shifted to the breeding of good, ranch-bred saddle horses. In 1949, the first registered Quarter Horse foals were born on the ranch. That same year, the Sutton Brothers purchased a registered stallion in Texas. The broodmare band was enlarged as opportunity knocked in 1950, when a severe drought in Texas forced many well-known southern breeders to disperse/reduce their horse herds.

JOHN GIBSON AND SARAH EDWARDS GIBSON:

John (my 2nd Great Grandfather) and brother James came to America in 1852. Their mother, Jane, and young William came later in 1852. Robert and Archibald came in 1853, Hugh in 1854, and Margaret Gibson and her husband, William Colville and family, on May 6, 1856 on the steamer Edinburgh, per the New York passenger lists. Under their obituaries, you will read the information on that voyage. It seems we come from a long line of farmers; the occupations listed for all the men who came from Scotland was farmers. They settled in Sussex, Wisconsin. There were ten Gibson children:

John Gibson’s Family

William Gibson Nov 12, 1840 Scotland – Aug 10, 1889 in Empire Prairie, Andrews, MO

Baptized Dec 1840 Church of Scotland, Parish Church of Ochiltree, Scotland

NOTE: After William Gibson died in Oct 1840, his mother bore another son in Nov that same year and named him William as well. I often wondered, while researching our family tree, why the repeat of so many names. It certainly made it difficult to sort and keep track who was who. The families in the beginning were very large. One has to admire these women who had so many children, and in some instances, bore one each year. These women raised their children to adulthood, toiled hard every day, and faced many hardships. Many of these youngsters, however, died at an early age, bringing more hardship and sadness. Pioneer times were hard, but most of our ancestors survived. We came from tough, sturdy stock.

JOHN AND SARAH (EDWARDS) GIBSON (My 2nd Great Grandparents)

JOHN GIBSON 1828 – 1909 SARAH (EDWARDS) GIBSON 1837 – 1874

Hugh and Jane’s son, John, is my 2nd Great Grandfather. He came to Sussex, Wisconsin in about 1852 where he met his wife, Sarah Edwards. Sarah was born in Saint-Sylvestre, Manganic Co, Quebec, Canada to Henry and Eleanor (Emerson) Edwards. John and Sarah were married December 14, 1855 in Sussex, Waukesha, Wisconsin. Sarah’s father, Henry was born Sept 10, 1802 in Isle of Wight, England, and her mother, Eleanor Emerson, was born 1805 in Dunmore, Ireland. They came to Wisconsin between 1851 and 1855. There were 13 children in Sarah’s family.

These are my 3rd Great Grandparents, Henry and Eleanor (Emerson) Edwards

Henry Edwards’ parents were John and Sarah Burbish Edwards. John was born in 1780, in Ireland and died in 1836, in Quebec, Canada. Sarah Burbish Edwards was born 1779, in Isle of Wight, England and died 1836, in Quebec, Canada.

JOHN EDWARDS SR (Henry Edwards’ Father and Sarah Edwards Gibson’s Grandfather) (My 4th Great Grandfather)

Birth: 1778, Ireland

Death: Mar 9, 1836, Quebec, Canada

He was the son of John Edwards and Sarah Jane Parker

John’s great grandparents lived in Wales until an epidemic likely caused them to move to Ireland around the 1730s. Edwards families lived in an area where Kilkenny and Carlow Counties shared a border for the next 70 years or more. Many were trained for the military.

John married Sarah Burbish/Burrish, a Roman Catholic from Wales on the Isle of Wight in 1797. Charles Armstrong wrote, “This is very astonishing to the Protestant race and his own friends disowned him. He was taken to the docks, hidden under straw and his cousin John, my wife’s brother, sailed with him to Canada. John, my wife’s brother, died and was buried near Montreal at a place called Bencartier.”

In about 1800, John and Sarah returned to the Isle of Wight where they remained until the summer of 1810 when they returned to Canada with their five children.

In 1825, they were listed in Saint-Gilles, Quebec and in 1831 in Saint-Sylvestre, Quebec, living with their son, George. John was buried 11 Mar 1836 (From the Find a Grave Website).

EDWARD EDWARDS 1798 BY JENNIE EDWARDS (Edward was Henry and George’s brother)

(John and Sarah Burbish’s First Child)

Birth: 1798 Quebec, Canada

Death: Unknown

From Jennie E. [Ellen Jane] Edwards Book pages 27 and 28:

Their first child (a son) was born there in Quebec in 1798. The winter of 1799 and 1800 was a severe one. Starvation stared them in the face and they decided to return to the old country by working their way back on-board ship.

A kind-hearted family, by the name of McCauley, offered to take care of their child for one year, as it was their intention to return to Canada in a few months. It was to procure funds that they made this hasty trip back home, as money sent by check or draft was almost unheard of in 1800.

Once more on British soil, surrounded by relatives and friends, and having the comforts of a good home, John Edwards and his wife were persuaded to remain there for an indefinite time.

In the summer of 1810, John Edwards and his wife, accompanied by their five children, once more left their native land, to make their future home in Canada.

They had not forgotten the child they had left with the McCauleys. On arriving at St. Patrick, Quebec, their first quest was for their boy. They were surprised and dismayed when they could find no trace of the McCauley’s or of the child they had left in their care. The boy and the McCauley’s were never found.

JOHN and SARAH EDWARDS GIBSON (MY 2nd GREAT GRANDPARENTS)

John and Sarah moved their family to Andrews County, Missouri at the end of the Civil War in about 1865. Sarah passed away July 25, 1874 and is buried in Empire Prairie Missouri, as well as her mother-in-law, Jean (Jane) Orr Gibson, who passed away March 23, 1874.

My 3rd Great Grandmother, Jean (Jane) Orr Gibson and son William moved to Empire Prairie, Andrews, Missouri, along with John and Sarah. According to the census, they were living there in 1860. After William’s death in 1889, his property was sold.

JOHN GIBSON 1828 – 1909 OBITUARY:

John Gibson was born in Ayrshire, Scotland in 1828 and died at the home of his son, James, Wednesday, June 23rd, 1909, aged eighty-one years, four months and eight days.

He came to America as a young man in 1852 and settled at Sussex, Wisconsin, and was married to Sarah Edwards in 1855. To this union, which was broken by the wife’s death in 1874, there were born three sons and a daughter, all of whom survive, as do also three brothers and a sister.

Mr. Gibson was a resident of Nebraska since 1879, having lived in Fillmore and Furnas counties prior to the last three years spent in this county.

Since 1873, he was a member of the Presbyterian Church.

The funeral was held late Friday at noon at the Congregational church, whence the remains were taken to the Trenton cemetery. Rev. H. L. Mills preached the funeral sermon and officiated at the services. (Trenton Register, Friday, July 2, 1909, p. 1, c.5)

John Gibson was found unconscious when his son, James U. Gibson, went to call him Wednesday morning. He lived but a short time. Mr. Gibson was 83 years old and went to bed feeling well; it is thought his death was due to heart failure or a paralytic stroke.

The bereaved ones have the sympathy of many friends. (Palisade Times, June 25, 1909)

Funeral Services for Mrs. Elliott Thursday Afternoon

Funeral services for Mrs. Martha Elliott, well-known Sac Bay resident who died Monday afternoon, will be held at the Elliott home at 2 o’clock C. S. T. Thursday afternoon. Burial will be in the Sac Bay cemetery.

Mrs. Elliott was born at Saint-Sylvestre, Province of Quebec, Canada, Dec 26, 1843. Her family immigrated to Sussex, Waukesha County, Wisconsin in 1854. On Nov 9, 1864, she was married in St. Alban’s Episcopal Church in Sussex to Samuel Elliott, who died in 1889.

Immediately following her marriage, she came with her husband to Sac Bay, where she had continuously resided for more than 67 years. Five children were born to her: Henry who died at the age of eight; Samuel T. who died in 1912; and three daughters, Misses Lucy, Mattie, and Adelle who are at home.

Because of her long residence in the district, Mrs. Elliott was one of the best known and beloved in the Garden peninsula.

Arrangements are in charge of the Anderson Funeral Home. [Escanaba Daily Press: Sept 14, 1932]

The Elliott sisters were something of a legend in the Sac Bay, Michigan area. None of the three married and were very self-sufficient and took care of their family farm.

SAMUEL “SAMMY” ELLIOTT OBITUARY

Birth: Dec 21, 1826, England

Death: Nov 29, 1889, Sac Bay, Delta County, MI

Married to Martha Edwards (Daughter of Henry and Elllen, sister to Sarah Edwards Gibson)

Samuel was born in Peasmarsh to George and Lucy Transit Elliott. In 1830, he moved with his parents to Augusta, New York and from there, to Lisbon, Wisconsin in 1837. At age 20, he started north ending up in Delta County, Michigan.

A pioneer at Sac Bay, he established a cedar business there and built a three-massed schooner to engage in the lake trade, hauling cedar. In 1864, he returned to Lisbon and married Martha Edwards. Samuel built her a little white house with wood filigree decoration and gable peaked roof. The yard was surrounded by a picket fence. All the lumber for the house was planed by hand by Oscar Topper and Olar Adel, Swedish craftsmen from Escanaba. After the death of their parents, the three daughters took over the operation of the farm.

STEPHEN ELLIOTT OBITUARY (Brother of Samuel)

Death: Feb 24, 1904

Stephen Elliott, Who Passed Away Last Week, aged 75.

Married Esther Le’Cuyer and after her death, married Harriet Edwards, (sister of Martha and Sarah)

Stephen Elliott, aged 75 years, died at his home on Grand Avenue, Wednesday, February 24, 1904, after a year’s illness. He was born in the parish of Peasmarsh, County of Sussex, England. He came to America with his parents in 1830, living in Oneida county, New York until 1837, when the family came to the territory of Wisconsin and settled where the village of Sussex now stands. Here he lived with other pioneers, encountering all the trials and hardships incident to the early settlers. When he grew to manhood, he went to northern Michigan, where he remained until the breaking out of the Civil war. He enlisted in Company G, 2nd Battalion, U. S. 8 Infantry and served his country three years and six months. He was severely wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga, was sent to the hospital for three months, after which he rejoined his regiment. At three different times, he was mentioned in dispatches for coolness and bravery in action. Mr. Elliott was a man of quiet disposition, strictly temperate in his habits, and loved the most by those who knew him the best.

He is survived by his wife, two sons, Floyd of this city and Stephen of Oconto, and a step-daughter, Miss Ida Edwards, a teacher in the high school. Two sisters, Mrs. A. E. Frary of La Moille, Illinois, and Mrs. Harriett Bonham of Empire Prairie, Missouri, and one brother, James Elliott of Sussex, also survive him. The funeral services were held Saturday at one o’clock with the Rev. I. L. Cory officiating. [Unknown newspaper, Feb 24, 1904]

Elliott House – Sac Bay, Michigan Elliott Sister’s House – Sac Bay, Michigan

Elliott Farm in Later Years – Sac Bay, Michigan

Martha Edwards and Samuel Elliott moved to Sac Bay, Michigan after they married. They had five children: Samuel Tilton, died at age 36; Henry Shulton, died at age 8; Lucy Ann, the oldest, lived to age 90; Martha “Mattie” lived to age 83; and Adelle “Babe” lived to age 79. Samuel and his brother Stephen were amongt the earliest farmers of the Sac Bay, Michigan, area. They were fishermen for awhile and then Samuel started his own lumber mill. He built the E.P. Royce Schooner in 1873 and used it to transport timber and other products that were shipped to Chicago. It sank in a storm in Bailey’s Harbor, Wisconsin on Nov 26, 1893, carrying cedar posts and ties. It is unknown how many lives were lost.

The sawmill produced 10,000 boards per day from the timber on his land.

E.P. Royce Schooner built by Samuel Elliott – 1873 in Sac Bay, Michigan

Sam and Martha’s first house burned down, so Sam built a new house in 1882. He used timber from his land and planed it by hand from knotless white pine. The gingerbread trim was designed and cut out by a couple of Swedish craftsmen from Esconaba, Michigan.

The “old-timers” of the Fayette area today claim that the Eliott sisters, in their youth, were good-looking girls, lots of fun, and received many proposals of marriage. Their mother would not permit any of her children to marry. They attended local dances which were held on a wooden platform on the lawns of different families of the Sac Bay area in the summertime.

The sisters all had good educations. Lucy and Mattie attended Ferris Institute in Big Rapids, Michigan and became teachers. Mattie had taught school at Garth and was remembered as a “wonderful teacher.” Lucy taught school in several places in and around Sac Bay. She taught at the Mud Lake school situated in the old cheese factory site. She rode a bike to school and back home again each day. It was a hard rubber-tired bike. The school was later moved to its present sight by ropes and winch. It took two weeks to move. Adelle also attended Ferris Institute at first worked at the First National Bank & Insurance Company at Iron Riber, Michigan.

After the death of young Sam In 1912, Adelle stayed home. She kept records on temperatures and precipitation for the U.S. Weather Bureau for many years. For 35 years, Mattie conducted an experiment with tomatoes, selecting the seed from the earliest fruit each year to develop an even earlier strain. We also must give credit to Adelle for her “History of the Sac Bay” and other points of interest.

The sisters continued to farm for almost a half century, a farm life that to others seemed almost unchanging. They cared for the cows, sheep, turkeys, and chickens. In 1920, they owned the first motor car in the area, with Mattie driving the car. The Elliott farm had its own telephone until the local company went out of business. It was said that around 1953, there was a bear that was threatening their livestock, so one of the sisters shot it. They also made their own butter. They sounded like self-sufficient ladies.

The sisters are all remembered well to this day. The Elliotts now rest in the Sac Bay cemetery which is on a hill above the bay bordered by tall hardwood trees beneath which blooms a carpet of hepatica and trilliums in the springtime.

They left no will and the estate was divided among the heirs group of first cousins, none of whom reside near Sac Bay. They were considered quite well-to-do for their time.

Following Lucy’s death, an antique dealer offered to buy everything in the house but was coldly turned down with, ”We’ve lived this way for all these years and we will continue to do so. When we are dead, we don’t care what becomes of our stuff.”

ISAAC EDWARDS OBITUARY (Brother to Henry)

Birth: Sept 21, 1834 Saint-Sylvestre, Chaudiere-Appalaches, Region Quebec, Canada

Death: Oct 9, 1911 Pewaukee, Waukesha County, WI

ISAAC, EDWARDS has been a resident and respected citizen of Waukesha County for forty years, and in forwarding the interests of his community has ever been foremost. He was born near the historic city of Quebec, Canada, in October, 1834, and was the third in a family of nine children, three sons and six daughters, of whom five are living. The parents of the children were Henry and Ellen (Emerson) Edwards. Until sixteen years of age the gentleman, whose name heads this account, remained with his parents in Canada, where the greater part of his education was acquired; and then leaving the parental roof he began the battle of life which he has waged heroically since. Going to the Green Mountain State [Vermont] he hired out at $14 per month, and after remaining there three years his father induced him to return home. Together they immigrated to Wisconsin in 1854, landing in Milwaukee, which was then a place of no great importance. The first location of the Edwards family was on section 29 of Lisbon Township.

Mr. Edwards of this sketch made his home under the parental roof until his marriage, October 25, 1862, to Miss Sarah Ann Wilkins, a native of Dorchester, England. Nine children were born of this union, two sons and seven daughters, of whom six are living, namely; M. Melinda, who was very proficient in music, became the wife of Robert Taylor, a prosperous farmer of Delafield Township; G. Cora, who graduated from Carroll College in the Class of ’86, and for a number of years was a successful teacher in the public school, wedded Elmer Weaver, son of Hon. Thomas Weaver; M. Julia wedded Alden J. Grover, a farmer and stockman of Hawkeye, Iowa; Ida H., who was a student of Carroll College and a successful teacher for several years, married George J. Stratton, a merchant of Janesville, Wisconsin; Irene, who is at home, was educated in Carroll College, and has developed quite a talent for elocution. That she possesses more than ordinary ability in that direction is shown by the fact that she has taken five or six prizes for which she has competed, among them being gold and a silver medal. Nellie E., the youngest, has given especial attention to instrumental music. Mr. Edwards has four grandchildren, Delbert Ray and Grace S. Stratton, Gladys B. Weaver and an infant of Mrs. Taylor’s.

On the 23d of May, 1893, Mr. Edwards was deprived by death of his beloved companion, who for over thirty years had shared the happiness as well as the trials of life with him. Mrs. Edwards was born October 4, 1841, and until twenty years of age remained in her native land. She was one of eleven children. In June, 1861, the Wilkins family set sail from Liverpool, but so rough and unfavorable was the weather that nine weeks were consumed in making the voyage to New York. The first year after marriage Mr. and Mrs. Edwards lived in the town of Lisbon; they then removed to their present home in the town of Pewaukee. They were without means, but as both were industrious and frugal the road to success was made such shorter and easier. In order to purchase their farm it was necessary to go in debt $3500, which in course of time was paid off; a beautiful home and large barns were erected and other improvements made. The home and all its surroundings evince enterprise, taste and culture. The unimproved farm with its log cabin has been transformed by Mr. Edwards into one of the valuable farms of Pewaukee Township. In addition to farming he is interested in the dairy business.

Politically Mr. Edwards is a true blue Republican, and with his party has been identified since he first voted for John C Fremont, giving every Presidential candidate since his unqualified support. His interest in political affairs has not been prompted by selfish motives, as has never been an aspirant for places of public trust or emolument. He and his family are active workers in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the children belong to the Epworth League, of which Miss Irene is Second Vice-President. The Edwards estate comprises one hundred and thirty-six acres of land on section 2, Pewaukee Township, which has been the home of its present possessor for nearly a third of a century. [PORTRAIT AND BIOGRAPHICAL RECORD; pages 281-282]

Isaac Edwards died at his home in Lisbon, Wednesday, October 11 in the seventy-seventh year of his age. The deceased was born in Sylvester, Canada, but had been a resident of Lisbon in 1855. He leaves a wife and six daughters to mourn his death. Mrs. James Grover, Waukesha; Mrs. George Stratton, LaCrosse; Mrs. William Hawes, Lisbon; Mrs. Robert Taylor, Pewaukee; Mrs. Elmer Weaver, Sussex; and Miss Nellie Edwards, Milwaukee.

Isaac Edwards was born September 21, 1834. He came to Wisconsin in 1855, and resided in the town of Lisbon, Waukesha County, until 1868 when he bought his present farm in the town of Pewaukee, on which he resided continuously up to the time of his death. He was buried in Rose Hill cemetery on October 14. Mr. Edwards was married twice. His first wife, Sarah Wilkins, whom he married October 26, 1862, died Mary 26, 1893. On April 6, 1898, he married Mrs. Lois Nichols Johnson who survives him.

The death of Mr. Edwards, removes a man of strong character, and an upright citizen who did his portion in developing the county, and who will be long missed from his accustomed place. [Waukesha Freeman, October 19, 1911]

JOHN EDWARDS OBITUARY (Son of Henry, brother to Sarah)

Birth: May 7, 1831, Saint-Sylvestre, Chaudiere-Appalaches Region, Quebec, Canada

Death: Nov 13, 1913, Sussex, Waukesha County, WI

JOHN EDWARDS, who follows farming on section 27, Lisbon Township, is numbered among the early settlers of Waukesha County of 1854. He has therefore witnessed much of its growth and development, has seen its wild lands transformed into beautiful homes and farms and has watched the growth of towns and villages. He has always borne his part in the work of progress and advancement and well deserves mention among the founders of the county.

Mr. Edwards was born near the historic city of Quebec, Canada, May 7, 1831, and is a son of Henry and Helen [Ellen] (Emerson) Edwards. His father was born on the Isle of Wight September 10, 1800, and emigrating to Canada in an early day, there carried on agricultural pursuits until his removal to the Badger State in 1854. He was a man of firm convictions, a Democrat in political belief and he and his wife were members of the Episcopal Church. The lady was born in Ireland in 1805 and was a child of five year when with her parents she came to the New World. The Edwards home in Waukesha County comprised one hundred and sixty acres of land, and was transformed from a wild tract into one of rich fertility by his father. His death occurred in 1881, and his wife died in 1883. They were the parents of five sons and seven daughters, of whom our subject is the eldest. The others yet living are, Isaac, a leading farmer and dairyman of Pewaukee Township; Henry, who is married and lives in Andrew County, Mo.; Martha, widow of Samuel Elliott, and a resident of Delta County, Mich.; and Harriet, wife of Stephen Elliott, who runs a transfer line in Waukesha.

John Edwards remained in Canada until twenty-two years of age. He has made farming his life work, and although he started out dependent entirely upon his own resources he has steadily worked his way upward. He purchased the interest of the other heirs in the old homestead and for forty years has resided thereon, having now one of the best improved farms in the township. In 1890 he suffered severe losses by fire, having a large barn, granary, sheds, thirty-eight hundred bushels of grain and fine machinery consumed in the flames. His loss amounted to about $4000, but with characteristic energy be re-built and now has a barn 90 X 36 feet, with eighteen-foot posts and a nine-foot basement, sheds 22 X 52 feet, a wagon shed 22 X 28 feet, and a granary 22 X 38 feet in dimensions. These buildings stand as monuments to his thrift and enterprise.

Mr. Edwards was married November 8, 1859, to Mary McIntyre, of Scotch descent, and they have one son and five daughters, all yet living, namely: William H.S.; Elizabeth A., wife of George Craig, a farmer of Dodge County, Wisconsin; Jennie E., who was educated in the Sussex schools and is now at home; Rhoda, wife of Eugene Craig, an expressman of Denver, Colorado; Alice, at home; Emma, who attended the White Water Normal School for two and a-half years and is a successful teacher, being now employed as primary teacher in Sussex. For his second wife Mr. Edwards chose Mrs. Mary (Simmons) Bacon, a native of Potsdam, New York. They were married January 9, 1875, and had three children, two yet living: John F., of New York; and Bessie, of Sussex. The mother of this family was called to the home beyond in January, 1890.

In politics Mr. Edwards has been a Republican since casting his first Presidential vote for Hon. John C. Fremont, but has never been an office-seeker. He holds membership with the Odd Fellow’s Lodge of Pewaukee; is a prominent member of and was vestryman in St. Alban’s Episcopal Church of Sussex. He is a gentleman of Honor and integrity, and his sterling worth has won him the confidence and esteem of all with whom he has been brought in contact.

Death: June 22, 1920, Pewaukee, Waukesha County, WI

Mrs. Craig left her home March 22, 1920, to go to the home of her daughter, Mrs. James A. Connell, at Pewaukee. She became ill while there and was never able to go back to her home. She wanted to live for the sake of her family and she put up a big fight to get well –“a bigger fight”‘ she told them, “than any man who ever went to war”. But her strength failed her, day after day. She passed peacefully away on Tuesday, June 22, 1920, (three months from the day she left her home”. Elizabeth (Edwards) Craig was a devoted wife and mother and she has been sadly missed by her family and friends. (The Pioneer Ancestors of Little James Craig Connell by Jennie E. Edwards, page 11)

Mrs. Geo. Craig, of Alderly, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. James Connell, on June 22 at the age of 57 years. Some weeks ago Mrs. Craig came to visit her daughter and assist in the care of a son who was ill in the Connell home. She became ill herself and death followed. Her husband and eight children survive. Funeral services and burial took place at Alderly, Friday. [Waukesha Freeman, July 1, 1920: page 5]

Former Senator W. H. Edwards Dies; Funeral Here Saturday

William H. Edwards, 83, one of Waukesha County’s leading Republicans, a generation ago and former State Senator and Assemblyman, died at his Sussex home Wednesday afternoon. Funeral services will be held at the Randall funeral home Saturday at 2 p.m.

Edwards was an Assemblyman from the second district of Waukesha county from 1915 to 1929, with the exception of the 1923 session. In 1930 he was elected State Senator from the 33rd district comprising Waukesha and Jefferson counties, and served until 1934.

Edwards had been a member of the State Tax Commission for many years, town clerk at Sussex for two terms, Waukesha county supervisor for 10 terms, and was chairman of the county board for one term. Before entering the political field, Edwards taught grade school at Sussex for 15 years.

Tax Expert

Survivors include his wife, Mrs. Martha J. Edwards, and a daughter, Mrs. Myrtle G. Austin, Green Bay; 4 grandchildren and a great granddaughter. The Edwards were married Oct 29, 1884. Mrs. Edwards was the former Martha Redford.

For many years the name Edwards was synonymous with state taxes. As a member of the tax commission he made the study of taxes his hobby and was for years consulted on all important state tax matters.

Edwards, who was born on a farm in the town of Lisbon May 14, 1861, and rose to one of the highest places in state government, had been in poor health for four years but did not become seriously ill until a week ago. A heart attack Wednesday afternoon caused his death.

Taught School

After completing a course of study at Carroll College, Edwards taught school and ran a farm at the same time. He was an active farmer for 20 years but retired to his home in Sussex in 1914. It was then that he became interested in politics and later in state political affairs.

K. Lowry, Waukesha attorney and a close friend of Edwards, will deliver a funeral oration during the services Saturday. The Rev. C. W. Heywood, Methodist minister of Wauwatosa, will officiate at the last rites. Burial will be the Prairie Home Cemetery, here.

The pallbearers will be Gavin McKerrow, Pewaukee; Albert Schultz, Sussex; Robert Vick, town of Lisbon; W. C. Zillmer, Sussex; Arthur Wendt, Sussex; and W. H. Steele, Pewaukee. [The Waukesha Freeman; Aug 23, 1944: page 3 col. 1]

MARGARET GIBSON OBITUARY 1832 SCOTLAND – 1916 MO

Margaret Gibson was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, June 20, 1832; died Jan 11, 1916, aged 83 years, 6 months, and 23 days. She was married to William Colville in Ayrshire, Scotland June 4, 1852. They came to this country in 1855 and located in Waukesha County, Wisconsin where they resided ten years. They then came to Missouri to the farm where she lived at the time of her death.

She joined the Presbyterian Church, in Scotland, in early life. After their removal to Missouri she united with the Presbyterian church of Empire Prairie of which she has been a faithful member to the time of her death.

To this union were born seven children, five sons and two daughters, six of who are now living, James the oldest having preceded her April 21, 1911. The living are Hugh of Belleville, Kansas; William, of Empire Prairie; Jane Bashor, of Union Star; Charles of Empire Prairie; John, of Grandfield, Kansas, and Margaret Tunnell of King City. All were present at the bedside at the time of her death. Besides the seven children she raised an orphan from infancy. She also leaves two brothers, twenty living grandchildren, twenty-five great-grandchildren, besides a host of friends to mourn her loss.

The funeral service was at the Empire Presbyterian church Wednesday afternoon, Jan 12th, conducted by the pastor, Rev. Calkins. The remains were laid to rest in the Empire cemetery, south of the church.

WILLIAM COVILLE OBITUARY (HUSBAND OF MARGARET GIBSON)

Our community was shocked on last Sunday afternoon by the report of the death of Wm. Colville, who died at 3 P.M. July 14, 1878. His death was quite unexpected to us all, and a great shock to his family, as he had been seemingly much improved for a few days. I suppose it was a bronchial and pulmonary infection that caused his death. For the benefit of his friends, I will give you a short obituary. Wm. Colville was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, June 11, 1823. He was therefore, fifty years old when he died. He was married to Margaret Gibson, who survives him, on the 24th anniversary of his birth, June 11, 1852. He removed to this country in 1855, and located in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, where he resided ten years. He then removed to Missouri, to the farm where he died, and where he spent 13 years of his life. He united with the established Presbyterian Church of Ayrshire, Scotland when 17 years of age. After his removal to Missouri, he connected with the Union Presbyterian Church of Empire Prairie, of which his wife, daughter and three sons are members. Thus, he was for 33 years a faithful member of the church of his fathers, one branch of the church visible, from which he has graduated to full communion in the Church triumphant – the Church in heaven. His death was emphatically a Christian death. He gently and peacefully fell asleep in Jesus. During his sickness no murmur escaped his lips; his patience was marked, and he frequently said: “I am so happy.” Toward the last his mind was entirely weaned away from earthly things and the principal topics of his conversation were the church, Jesus and heaven. When his natural eye grew dim, he said the eye of faith was stronger than ever. His tranquil, peaceful triumphant death was a fitting close of his upright life. So, the community has lost a useful citizen, the church has lost a devoted member, a wife has lost a true and faithful husband, and seven children have lost a kind and affectionate father. Our great loss is his greater gain.

The funeral services were conducted by the pastor of the Presbyterian Church, Rev, F. G. Strange, at the church, at 2 P.M. July 15, 1878. Two hundred friends and relatives were present and followed the remains to the grave. We will see the cheerful face of brother Colville no more on earth, but we will fondly cherish his memory.

NOTE: The ship the Colville’s took from Glasgow Scotland to New York — though the Colville’s were not on the ship in 1859, this article is about the same ship they did come on in 1855.

In 1859, the steamship Edinburgh, on way from New York to Glasgow, arrived at St. Johns, Newfoundland at 7 o’clock Tuesday, June 6. She had two of her compartments full of water, having struck an iceberg on Monday, June 5, at 11:20 A.M., one hundred and eighty miles east of St. Johns, in a dense fog. The iceberg was first discovered directly ahead, the ship being in lat. 47º40´ long. 48º20´. The helm was put hard-a-port, and she passed close alongside without touching the part above water, but struck underwater a little abaft her port bow, and stove in one of her forward plates. The engines were stopped and backed, but the ship had passed the iceberg before her way was stopped. The two foremost compartments filled almost immediately with water. The pumps were quickly set going, and sails and bedding lowered over into the boats. All the male passengers assisted the crew in working the pumps and bailing. There was a dense fog all day Monday and Monday night, with rain; wind fresh, but sea smooth. At noon of Tuesday, an observation was taken for the first time for three days, and the ship was found to be in lat. 47º42´N, long. 50º20W; distance from St. Johns, 47 miles. All hands worked vigorously at the pumps, and bailing to keep the ship from sinking. The water was only kept from flowing into the other compartments by their incessant labor. The passengers spoke in the highest terms of Captain Cummings’ conduct throughout. Every preparation was made, even to preparing the small boats and providing them with provisions, clothing, etc. The different boats were distributed and lists of the male passengers were also carefully prepared. The lady passengers sat up all night, ready dressed to embark. By 6 o’clock Tuesday morning, a number of the male passengers had become exhausted, and yet the severe labor imposed upon them was continued until she reached port. All the passengers and crew were safe. The captain spoke of the passengers as having behaved with the utmost coolness, and labored unremittingly for thirty hours.

HUGH COLVILLE OBITUARY (Margaret Gibson and William Colville’s son)

Hugh Colville, prominent farmer of Belleville and vice-president of the Peoples National bank, died at his home here Monday morning after several weeks’ illness. Funeral services were conducted yesterday afternoon from the Presbyterian Church and interment was made in Belleville cemetery.

Mr. Colville who was 80 years old Aug 14 last, was one of the organizers of the Peoples National bank, but he was more widely known as a successful farmer and stockman.

Born in Ayrshire, Scotland, on Aug 14, 1855, one of a family of seven children, came to America with his parents, William and Margaret Colville, when but nine months of age, the family settling near Waukesha, Wisconsin, and in the fall of 1864 they removed to a farm near King City, Missouri, where they remained until in the spring of 1884, when he came to Republic County, Kansas, settling upon a farm he purchased and continued to own three and one half miles east of Belleville, until his death.

He married Maggie B. Snyder, Dec 29, 1886, one daughter being born of this marriage. He leaves his widow, Maggie B. Colville, his daughter, Mrs. Ethel Vance and his granddaughters, Virleen Morns and Bernice King, all of Belleville, William and Charles Colville, brothers, and Maggie Tunnel, sister, of King City, Missouri, and John C. Colville, brother, of Grainfield, Kansas.

He continued to operate his farm until his death, though he had lived in Belleville since Aug 1, 1932. A man of sterling qualities, who was respected by all who knew him; successful as a stockman and farmer, always enlisted on the side of questions that would result in the betterment of people and government. A consistent Christian and became a member or the Presbyterian church at Empire Prairie, Missouri, later joining the church at Belleville in 1916 which he attended until his death.

He was one of the organizers of the Peoples National bank of Belleville, continuing to be associated with it and at his death and for some years past was its vice-president, a substantial force in its affairs.

His life was without doubt an example of right living; always true to every trust imposed upon him; a lover of all good things; his fidelity to his family was of the highest order; his lovely farm home was an indication of the care and thoroughness he applied to every life undertaking. In his passing his family, neighbors and associates have lost a good man whose place is not easily filled.

Services were conducted Wed, Aug 28, at 2:30 p.m. in the Presbyterian Church, with Dr. W.S. Smalley in charge, assisted by Dr. Allen Wikgren of the Baptist church, both of Belleville.

Music was furnished by a male quartet composed of G. H. Bramwell, Frederick Herbolsheimer, M. L. Hill and Ron A. Randall, with Mrs. Ruby Bramwell accompanying at the pipe organ. Interment was made in the Belleville cemetery in a beautiful family plot he had owned for fifty years. Thus, another of the sturdy pioneers of this community has left us, but the memories of him and his life will live on and on, reminding of accomplishments gained by earnest and honest effort, fair dealing to all. [Belleville Telescope, Aug 29, 1935]

ARCHIBALD GIBSON OBITUARY 1837 SCOTLAND-1935 NE (John’s brother)

The death summons came to Archibald Gibson Wednesday forenoon, relieving him of a weary life he had been leading for several months. The past three months especially, he appeared to be losing ground steadily, though he had no particular ailment other than the natural decline which accompanies the later years of a long and active life.

Since the death of his wife in 1910, Mr. Gibson has lived with his children, dividing his time among them. When his son, Archie, came back to Trenton about five years ago, Mr. Gibson returned here with his son, with whom he has since made his home.

Funeral services were conducted Thursday forenoon from the home. Pall bearers were Mr. Gibson’s two sons, J.H. and R. A. Gibson, a grandson, Floyd, and his nephews Lloyd, Ulyes and Charles. Burial was in the Trenton cemetery by the side of his wife. (Trenton Republican Leader; Fri Aug 2, 1935, p.1, c.6)

Archibald Gibson was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, May 13th, 1837, and departed this life at the home of his son in Trenton, July 30th, 1935, aged 98 years, 2 months and 17 days. At the age of sixteen he moved with his mother and brothers to the United States, settling near Sussex, Wisconsin, where he was married to Margaret Black. To this union were born three sons and one daughter, all of whom are living.

In Dec 1889, he, with his family, moved to Hitchcock County, Nebraska, settling on a farm southeast of Trenton, where he resided until 1910, when he moved to the village of Trenton, where his wife passed away, Sept 12, 1912. Trenton has been his home ever since with the exception of a few years spent with his children in other states.

While living in Wisconsin he became a member of the United Presbyterian church at Sussex, and while his wife, when living, attended the Congregational church in Trenton.

He leaves to mourn his loss three sons, L.O. Gibson of Cummings, North Dakota, J. H. of Morrill, Nebraska, R.A. Gibson of Trenton, Nebraska, and one daughter, Mrs. Agnes Bundy of Trenton, Nebraska, nine grandchildren, 16 great grandchildren, besides numerous other relatives.

MRS. ARCHIBALD (MARGARET BLACK) GIBSON OBITUARY, 1838-1912

Margaret Black was born in Scotland near Edinburgh, Sept 12, 1838. When she was about two years old, she came with her parents to this country, locating in Wisconsin. Later the family moved to Canada. After some years Miss Black returned to Wisconsin where she met and married Mr. Archibald Gibson, Sept 29, 1865.

In 1899, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson with family consisting of three sons and one daughter moved to Hitchcock County, Nebraska, locating southeast of Trenton. Two years ago, they moved to Trenton.

Mrs. Gibson united with the Methodist church when a girl. Later she joined the United Presbyterian church, and when the family moved to Hitchcock County, the Presbyterian Church. When that church was disbanded she joined the Fairview Congregational Church, and when they came to Trenton, brought her membership here.

Had she lived till the 12th of Sept she would have been 74 years old, however, after a lingering illness, Monday morning, Sept 9th, she was called to that home for which she had been preparing.

She is survived by her children. All her children, but one son, whose home is in North Dakota and who was unable to be present, were at the funeral.

The funeral services were held Wed at the Congregational church. (Trenton Republican Leader; Fri Sept 13, 1912, p.1, c.2)

Besides the children there are 45 living grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. One brother, Archibald, of Nebraska, also survives him. Mr. Gibson’s wife preceded him in death on Nov 3, 1918. They lived together almost 60 years.

Many sacred memories center in the old home farm, where so many joys and sorrows were known, but happiness predominated. Mr. Gibson lingered four years after his faithful helpiness [sic] of 60 years was called to the heavenly home. These years were marked by considerate care on part of his children. His own departure through heart failure was sudden and painless.

So another of the early settlers has passed on. In the 56 years of their busy life as pioneers, they saw many changes and did their part in developing the wilderness and making it blossom as the rose.

The many relatives and friends who held Mr. Gibson in love and high esteem will ever cherish his memory.

Funeral services were held at the late home of the deceased at 2:00 o’clock Friday afternoon and were conducted by Rev. C. W. Pinkney. Interment in Burnside cemetery.

The Spanish American War – Cuba 1898: We had thought we may have had an ancestor who served with Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders. His name was William Christian Gibson, born Nov 19, 1873, in New York. His father was born in Scotland and his name was William, also and his mother’s name was Elizabeth F. Gibson. He was married to Beatrice. However, I was unable to connect him to our family tree. I have searched through all of our family who came from Scotland, Ireland, and England and was unable to link him to our family, in any way. There is the slight possibility he is connected back in Scotland, but the resources are limited. His father possibly could be connected to our Hugh Gibson, my 3rd Great Grandfather, who died in Scotland before our family came to America.

MARGARET EDWARDS GIBSON (HUGH JR) OBITUARY

The death of Mrs. Hugh Gibson, of consumption, at Waukesha, which occurred last Thursday, has occasioned much sorrow. She was thirty-five years of age and leaves five small children. The funeral was held on Sunday and the remains were interred at Sussex.

(Waukesha Freeman: Feb 18, 1886)

MARGARET GIBSON – In the village of Waukesha on Thursday morning, Feb 4th, of consumption, Margaret, loving wife of Hugh Gibson, Jr.

Margaret Edwards was born July 7, 1857; was baptized in infancy by Rev. Dr. King. At the age of sixteen, in St. Alban’s church, Sussex, Rev. John Bennett, then being rector, she renewed her baptismal vows, receiving the blessed spirit, at the hands of the Right Rev. Jackson Kemper, Bishop of the Diocese, being one of a class of fifteen. On Nov 11, 1875, she was united in marriage to Hugh Gibson, Jr. by the Rev. Dr. Wright, in St. Matthias’ Church, Waukesha; also to the Rev. Dr. Wright was appointed the sad duty of laying her remains in their final resting place, in St. Alban’s churchyard, Sunday, Feb 7, (the rector of the church being absent in Texas). And let us judge of the love and respect in which she was held by the vast congregation of sympathizers who came to pay this last tribute of respect to her worth. There must be comfort in this to the afflicted ones, for seldom has St. Alban’s held a larger number of sincere sympathizers. She had been conscious for some time that the end was near, and it must be a great comfort to the afflicted to know that, hard as it was in her case to submit to being parted for a while from her five little ones, still ‘ere she went, she could say:

“Thy will, not mine, be done.”

“Yet ever as time speeds onward, we must lose them one by one,

All falling like leaves in autumn, and leaving us here alone;

Alone with the joys long buried, with sorrow which cannot die,

Which wrings from our hearts high broken, an exceeding bitter cry.

Full surely the greater number are found on the other side,

And since our treasure is garnered there, there should our hearts abide;

‘Ere long shall the veil be lifted, and our dearest Lord say Come,

They dwell in my own safe-keeping, and with joy shall welcome you home.”

Mrs. Nancy McKinney was born in Guernsey County, Ohio, Aug 11, 1819 and departed this life, at the home of her youngest daughter, Mrs. Sigel Casper, in Furnace Co, Nebraska, April 26, 1899, at the age of 79 years, 8 months, and 15 days. Her maiden name was McCreary. She was married to Mathew McKinney in the year 1839. She has been a widow since the death of Mr. McKinney in 1884 (Find A Grave says he died in 1882 but obit says 1884, so not sure which is correct), and made her home since that time with her married children. She gave her heart to God and became a member of the Presbyterian Church when young in life; her whole life was thus consecrated to the service of her Lord, whom she loved dearly.

Mrs. McKinney leaves ten children, six sons and four daughters, aside from the many more distant relatives, to mourn their loss. She was a kind neighbor, a devoted mother, and a loving companion. Appropriate funeral services were conducted Thurs, April 27, at the home of her daughter in Furnas Co., Nebraska, by Rev. A. C. Keeler, pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Norton, Kansas. A goodly number of relatives and friends were present. Her body was taken to Missouri for interment and lies at rest by the remains of her husband, who preceded her so many years. The bereaved family has the sympathy of the entire community.

HUGH GIBSON 1856 – 1939 OBITUARY (MY GREAT GRANDFATHER)

HEART ATTACK FATAL TO HUGH GIBSON

Hugh Gibson, 82, familiar and prominent figure of this community, died very suddenly at his home northeast of Edison, as the result of a heart attack with which he was stricken at eight o’clock Thursday morning.

Although he had been in failing health for some time with a heart ailment, he was about the farm yard as usual that morning. After doing some light chores, he complained of feeling ill and went into the house, where he passed away a few minutes later. His son, Charles, who lived at home, was with him when death came.

Mr. Gibson has been a resident of this locality forty-six years, all of which were spent on the same farm three miles northeast of here. Like many other early residents of this portion of Nebraska, he, with a large family to provide for, experienced privations and hardships which were so common during those years. It is through the perseverance and guidance of these faithful settlers that the newer generations are now enjoying the present conveniences and comforts unknown to their ancestors.

He became a member of the Board of Directors for the Farmers’ Co-op Grain Assn. organized thirty-five years ago, most of that time acting as president. For around thirty years he served as deacon on the Christian church board, taking an active interest in all church services, whenever possible. Along with other activities and toils of the earlier farmer, he served on the school board of District 101 over a long period of time.

Funeral services were held Sunday afternoon March 12 in the Edison Christian church, with the pastor Rev James Wood, officiating. A quartet composed of Mrs. Ruth Tower, Miss Ruth Wood, W.F. Samples and B.W. Burke sang “Face to Face”, “Rock of Ages”, and “Going down the Valley.” Mrs. T.V. French was pianist.

Mr. Gibson was laid to rest in the Edison cemetery where his wife preceded him in death in 1928. Pallbearers were: J.A. French, C.L. Jones, E.E. Bard, C.C. Munday, H.J. Hand and J.C. Sanderson. W.R. Arnold, local Funeral Director was assisted by A.E. Phillipson of Holbrook. D. Stagemeyer of Holbrook had charge of the many beautiful flowers.

The church was filled to its capacity by folks from near and far, as they came to pay a last respect to him, a kind, devoted father; congenial neighbor and friend to all.

OBITUARY

Hugh Gibson was born at Merton, Wisconsin, Oct 21, 1856 and passed away at his home northeast of Edison March 9, 1939, at the age of eight-two years, four months and sixteen days.

At the close of the Civil War the family moved from their home in Wisconsin, to Empire Prairie, Missouri. It was here that Mr. Gibson met Henrietta McKinney, to whom he was united in marriage, Feb 18, 1876. To this union were born 10 children, 8 of whom survive. One child died in infancy and the other at the age of five years. He is also preceded in death by his wife.

RAYMOND LESTER “JACK” HILTON OBITUARY

Birth: Nov 1, 1912, Nodaway County, MO

Death: Dec 3, 2005, McMinnville, Yamhill County, OR

Jack was born November 1, 1912 in Gallagher Corners, about 2 miles west of Ravenwood, Nodaway County, Missouri, on the farm settled by his great grandfather Edward Hilton in 1874. He grew up on a farm a few miles north of there, with his parents, James Edward and Mabel Sarah (Whitehead) Hilton and older brothers, Harold Edward and Ralph Emerson Hilton. He attended the local rural schools and graduated from Gaynor High School.

After a few years of bachelorhood, he saw Verda Irene Clark in a Gaynor High School play, managed to be introduced and gave her a ride home. They were married on June 1, 1938 in the lovely old courthouse in the town square of Savannah, Missouri.

Their first home was in Hopkins, Missouri and Jack worked for several local farmers, milking cows and doing other chores. Later they moved to Maryville where two children were born. Jack found a job as a grease monkey for Curnutt Motor Company, working on the Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks, and Chevrolets that they sold. However, poor economic conditions in Northwest Missouri prompted them to move to Oregon in 1955. They sold most of their household goods, loaded up their 1947 Chevrolet Fleetline and started driving across the arid west with two kids, a dog and a canary in the back seat.

When the family arrived in McMinnville, they stayed with Jack’s Gaynor High School friends, Roland and Cleo Hantze until Jack found a job at the Yamhill Plywood Company running the glue machine. Within a few years he was a millwright for the plant and was on call day or night if any machinery broke down. After the plant closed he found new employment at Cascade Farm Machinery in Silverton. There he repaired tractors, combines and large farm equipment until he retired. During harvest season, he was called into farmer’s fields when machinery broke down because he could always get it running again. He loved the challenge and thought it was fun.

After retirement, he became the patient and diligent primary caregiver for his wife during her long illnesses. Eventually he realized that he needed assistance and they moved from their home to assisted living, and finally to Oakwood Country Place.

Jack was a loving husband and father. He was a creative storyteller and his embellishments of The Three Little Pigs and other stories are fondly remembered by his children. He made friends easily and was deeply loved by his family and relatives. He died December 3, 2005 at Oakwood Country Place in McMinnville.

Jack is survived by his daughter and husband; son and wife; four grandsons, and three great grandchildren.

Viewing will be Tuesday, December 6th from 12:00 to 7:00 at Chapel of Macy & Son. Cryptside services will be held Wednesday at 11:00 at Evergreen Memorial Park Mausoleum.
