        "text": "Academics\n\nAcademics at Whitworth University are “challenging to the point that [students are] kept engaged, but not so hard [to make them] feel helpless.” Many find “one of Whitworth’s greatest strengths [to be] its small class sizes,” but overall the university simply provides a “very supportive community with a positive attitude.” They also appreciate that the community places an “emphasis on Christianity in the classroom and among professors” as well. As for those professors, one Whitworth Pirate notes “I really couldn’t ask for a better, more supportive group.” Others agree, describing the faculty as “wonderful,” “personable,” and “extremely knowledgeable.” Teachers are seemingly “always available for extra help” and will “work independently to … create meaningful relationships [with students] that prove to last beyond college.” Outside of the classroom, “Whitworth also offers a large number of off-campus opportunities, both within the United States and around the world.” Do note, however, that many of these are “spiritual opportunities for the Christian student,” though the school does not force students to participate. While some students feel that the school’s strong Christian background can hinder their growth, many acknowledge the university’s openness and acceptance of others. One declares, “No one is forcing you to attend chapel.” Another adds, “This school lets us have an opinion and somewhere to share it.”\n\nStudent Body\n\nAt Whitworth, you’ll find students who are “very into helping one another succeed in any and every way they possibly can.” To that end, attendees tend to be “open-minded,” “social,” and “caring” to the extent that “you won’t be able to walk through campus without receiving several warm smiles and greetings.” While they’re all driven to learn and succeed, “instead of focusing on competition, most … are just interested in helping themselves and others.” This establishes “a very kind and fun community to be a part of.” There’s also a variety and depth to what you’ll encounter in the company of fellow students, much of which “derives from the international student body, as it adds a lot of cultural benefits and awareness.” One student adds, “We all come from different backgrounds and it is very interesting to see how diverse the campus is.” As another sums it up: “Everyone [here] is unique in their own way, and that just seems to draw people closer.”\n\nCampus Life\n\nWhile many here “tend to fill their days with studying,” Whitworth features a very “down-to-earth campus, so it’s common to see students lounging in tree hammocks or just lying in the grass.” However, anyone seeking a little more activity will find plenty of opportunities here as well. When it’s sunny, hammocking is popular, as are outdoor sports like Frisbee Golf and Spike Ball. During the winter, “many people go up to the [nearby] mountains” to hike, mountain bike, or ski. Other popular spots during the colder months include nearby coffee shops and friends’ dorms where students will watch movies or finish schoolwork. As for school-sponsored happenings, “there are usually different events going on every weekend hosted by clubs.” Many of those organizations also “take into account [differences in] ethnicity, hobbies, and political backgrounds,” which those at Whitworth view as evidence that administration is “working hard to bring more diversity on campus.”"
