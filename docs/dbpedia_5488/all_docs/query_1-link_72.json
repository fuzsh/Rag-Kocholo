        "text": "The purpose of the Called to the City Community is to help churches in Spokane to rediscover their missional calling by training participants to use their God-given talents in the context of their current neighborhood, vocation and city. Over the past year, the Called to the City Calling Community has explored how the church can work with business, government, nonprofits and other stakeholders for the benefit of their city and neighborhood. Representatives from approximately 25 churches have been meeting to explore how their congregation is called to serve in their local context, including their neighborhood and the city at large.\n\nThis work has included mapping demographics (age, gender, income, housing, etc.) within a one-mile radius of each church, adjusting engagement strategies based on community needs, and aligning them with congregational strengths. These discoveries and conversations have helped churches take ideas they already had and increase the overall impact.\n\nFor example, Millwood Presbyterian launched \"Millwood Impact,\" which offers afterschool mentorship to students from third to eighth grade. Mosaic Church is working to provide counseling services to urban workers in the fast-food restaurants located across the street from their building. The Gathering House in the Garland district is turning their parking lot into a neighborhood farmer's market and space for outdoor music.\n\nIn addition to helping churches interpret their local context and find ways to serve, we will talk and pray through the serious ramifications of the COVID pandemic and the ways it has impacted how the church interacts with the city. Strengthening congregations and helping them think creatively on how to engage with culture in this crucial time will be an area critical in the new year."
