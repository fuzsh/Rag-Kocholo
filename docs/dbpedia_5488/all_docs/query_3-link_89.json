In general, it supervises the student newspaper The Whitworthian, and the annual yearbook Natsihi. The position of editor of the newspaper is particularly important and often surrounded by controversial issues noted here in the various items of correspondence and memoranda. Samples of various student publications are in this file. Copies of the newspaper are in a separate file and the yearbooks are available cataloged in the college library. Student handbooks included in this file were produced both by student organizations and the administration of the college."
