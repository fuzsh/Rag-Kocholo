It lives up to its mission statement, it offers an incredible learning environment, and it contains the nicest people possible. I honestly cannot express how wonderful this institution is!\n\nRylee from Spokane, WA\n\nThis university contains some of the most intellectually sound, yet compassionate professors anywhere in the world. Not only do almost all of them hold doctoral degrees from outstanding universities (University of Washington, University of Oregon, University of Alabama, Princeton, Princeton Theological Seminary, Oxford, etc.), they ALL want and do relate to you in incredible ways. Each professor I had desired to get to know me and would call me to check-in (especially if I missed a class), but challenged me to help me become a competitive professional and diligent employee.\n\nJoshua from Mission, TX\n\nwhitworth is a great christian university that doesn't compromise its christ mission, while still having a vibrant, diverse community and high academics. the many opportunities for community, service, faith, and learning provide anyone with the options for success. christian and non-christians alike will feel welcome here and be challenged to ask tough questions and learn about other perspectives.\n\nKatelyn from Union, OR\n\nwhitworth university promotes a sense of community that is incomparable to any other i've seen or heard of. the student body is driven and diverse. and the faculty genuinely cares for the personal and academic growth of their students.\n\nHailey from Greenacres, WA\n\nWhitworth University is wholeheartedly committed to its motto of providing an education of the mind and heart.
