        "text": "Biochemistry major Drexler Yesiki ’23 served his second summer with River City Youth Ops, an organization that creates youth enrichment opportunities in Spokane’s West Central neighborhood. His position was supported by Whitworth’s Dornsife Center for Community Engagement. “I served as a program coordinator and was involved in the day-to-day development of the youth involved. This meant I supervised and engaged with 15-18 youth between the ages of 12-18 years old in planting, harvesting and selling produce that we grew in our urban farm. Other activities that our team was involved in included cooking demos and presentations from guest speakers, as well as community engagement projects around West Central organizations like Our Place and Spokane Riverkeeper. “I was surprised by how much I have learned from the youth in the program. Each of them comes from very different backgrounds and walks of life. This has challenged me to broaden my own perspective and has taught me new ways to engage with different types of people. “Going through this experience has shaped my vision for my future. It has allowed me to understand how much I enjoy collaborating with all kinds of individuals to accomplish a goal that I am passionate about. After this summer I am hopeful to revolve my future career around this newfound passion.”"
