        "text": "Text\n\nBallard Hall is home to about 66 young women, forming part of the historic community with McMillan Hall, known on campus as \"BMAC\". Ballard is a hall known for its rich history and long standing traditions, as well as a close sisterhood and a tight brother-sister relationship with McMillan Hall. Ballard was the second building built on Whitworth's Spokane campus, with its completion in 1915, Ballard was originally the men's dormitory, along with the science labs and the Dean's apartment. Ballard was named for Captain W.R. Ballard of Seattle, for whom the neighborhood in Seattle was named, in 1924. Captain Ballard served as a long time trustee of the college beginning in 1892.\n\nWhitworth College, after moving from Tacoma, opened in Spokane in September 1914 with the completed Young Ladies' Dormitory, today known as McMillian Hall. \"The basement of the Young Men's Dormitory (what would later be known as Ballard) was ready by October for 15 students.\n\nOn March 8, 1927, disaster struck. A fire was discovered by senior Carl Boppell, who lived on the third floor. Students scrambled to carry out furniture and belongings from the fire, but the building itself could not be saved. While firemen quickly arrived on the scene, they suffered from inadequate equipment and had to stand by as Ballard was enveloped in wind-fueled flames, working instead to save McMillan Hall. Dean Orrin Tiffany's extensive library collection and his wife's doctoral research notes were lost in the fire. As mentioned in Kathryn Bockman's account in the yearbook in 1927, the Whitworth community gathered together to sing the Alma Mater as fire crews worked to put out the fire and Ballard Hall lay in a smoldering heap.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, classes carried on in McMillan Hall, and the women \"doubled up\" on the second floor, with the men of Ballard Hall moving onto the third floor, utilizing the fire escapes to enter and exit from their new quarters. After the fire, the college worked hard to rebuild quickly, both physically and in morale. The front page of the Whitworthian from March 30, 1927 contains several articles pertaining to the rebuilding of Ballard Hall. \"A donation of five thousand dollars by Miss Sarah Beaty of Center, Ohio, is the latest encouragement received by President W. A. Stevenson in his planning of a new Ballard Hall. Construction began to rebuild Ballard in June 1927, and construction was completed in December. Ballard remained home to the men of the college until the late 1930's when Ballard Hall was converted into an additional women's dormitory. The difference of the old and new Ballard is that the front is extended out while the main wings of the building is receded back.\n\nWorld War Two dramatically reduced enrollment at Whitworth College. However, in the wake of Pearl Harbor, people of Japanese descent across the west coast were forced to enter internment camps or move inland. Several Japanese families came to Spokane, and \"in 1944, ten percent of the student body was Japanese American, including nearly half of the basketball team.\" Several Japanese-American women lived in Ballard Hall at this time, and their picture hangs over the fireplace in memory of their inclusion into the Whitworth community at a time when those of Japanese descent were seen as the enemy.\n\nIn the 2000's, Ballard reinvented itself as a strong sisterhood with an equally strong connection to McMillan Hall. As a tight community housed in the oldest buildings on campus, the two halls filled the roles of sorority and fraternity, providing a place for students to feel at home and connected. Emilee Bosh, a four-year Ballard Alum from the class of 2009, explained how Ballard came to be defined in her last years as the most desired dorm to live in on campus. In the early 2000's, many of the traditions that continue today were established or reinstated, such as Milk and Cookies every Wednesday. These traditions and the strong community feel are strong components of Ballard today, and the close knit \"family\" is what draws many residents to Ballard each year. Today, a highlight of Ballard traditions is the Ballard Tea. This tradition involved the men of McMillan Hall putting on a talent show and serving tea and cookies to the ladies of Ballard who come to the chapel beautifully dressed up. Every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, the entire BMAC community gathers together around a long table set up through the first floor of McMillan Hall to share a meal together, ending with singing carols gathered around the piano in the lounge. This tradition in particular showcases the strong bond between the two residence halls, as well as the sense of family fostered by their residents."
