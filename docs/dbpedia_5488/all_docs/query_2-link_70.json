        "text": "1. How to get there\n\nThe college is easily accessible by taxi, train, or car. It is located approximately a half hour to 45 minutes from Philadelphia International Airport. If you arrive by air, you can rent a car or get a taxi at the airport. You can also take the SEPTA Regional Rail to Thorndale and exit the train at Haverford Station adjacent to the campus. If you drive, thereâ€™s free parking on campus reserved for registered guests of the college.\n\n2. Touring campus\n\nYou can get a student-guided campus tour with no appointment. These tours leave at the Admissions Office, Whitehead Campus. Keep in mind the busiest months to visit are April, August, and October. You can also explore the campus anytime, with the help of a brochure map from the Admissions Office. Group tours are also available from Monday through Friday. Contact the Admissions Office for such arrangements.\n\n3. Attractions near the college\n\nThe Please Touch Museum, a short drive from Haverford's campus, is a great hands-on museum for families with children. Get in a round of golf at the Merion Golf Club, practically adjacent to campus. Closer to Philadelphia, stroll Fairmount Park and admire historic buildings and public art alike."
