        "text": "Enacting Justice, Mercy, and Reconciliation on a Diverse Campus\n\nThe purpose of this conference is to gather faculty, staff, and administrators from our surrounding region, many of which are in rural, suburban, or small city settings, to discuss how to enact the biblical values of justice, mercy, and reconciliation better in our classrooms, in athletics, in residential and student life, in chapel, and in student success. This conference will be held on May 13, 2024.\n\nExpanding Minds and Hearts through Global Learning and Study Abroad\n\nAbilene Christian University will hold the next conference in its biennial “Best Practices in Christian Higher Ed” series on September 29-October 1, 2024. The theme for the 2024 conference is “Expanding Minds and Hearts Through Global Learning and Study Abroad.” Keynote speaker Melissa Torres, President of The Forum on Education Abroad will present the theme keynote on Study Abroad, and Dr. Alex Sosler, Assistant Professor of Bible and Ministry at Montreat College and Assisting Priest at Redeemer Anglican Church will provide theological perspectives in his keynote address.

Register here.\n\nHabits of Hope: Educational Practices for a Weary World\n\nThe Hedgehog Review’s Jay Tolson offered, “hope may be the most demanding virtue—and, in our time, the one in greatest need.” The purpose of the “Habits of Hope” symposium is to extend that theological logic concerning hope to the work humans called to the academic vocation do. The disorientation plaguing individuals called to such a vocation was on the rise through the 2010s, with Covid-19 only exacerbating it. While the pandemic has gratefully eased, that sense of disorientation is one from which educators have yet to recover.\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKERS INCLUDE\n\nHans Boersma\n\nAudrey K. Bowden\n\nKimberly Battle-Walters Denu\n\nKevin G. Grove, C.S.C.\n\nCherie Harder\n\nPhilip Graham Ryken\n\nDavid I. Smith\n\nJessica Hooten Wilson\n\nManaging Your Academic Career: A Workshop for Mid-Career Women Faculty\n\nMid-career, the longest academic career stage, often represents a crossroads of determining where to go or what to do next. For some, this phase results in a “stalled career” when weighing the benefits and costs of pursuing full professorship or other aspirations such as administrative posts. Others experience the signs and symptoms associated with job burnout, disengagement, and institutional disillusionment with increased responsibilities, tension between research and teaching, and additional administrative and leadership responsibilities.\n\nThis Lilly Fellows Workshop will provide a space for vocational conversations about mid-career teaching, research, service, and leadership development. It will offer specific tools, resources, and strategies to help mid-career women thrive in their work.\n\nRenewing Mind and Heart: Questions for the Next Generation in Higher Education\n\nWhat makes a Christian university education worthwhile? How can our academic communities cultivate an education not just of the mind, but also of the heart and soul? And is it possible for Christian universities to draw upon the deep resources of our theological tradition while also critiquing systemic injustice in society and our own communities?\n\nIn October of 2024, the Weyerhaeuser Center for Christian Faith and Learning will host a conference aiming to rekindle an ongoing conversation around these themes and the future of Christian higher education: \"Renewing Mind and Heart: Questions for the Next Generation in Christian Higher Education.\" Over three days, the conference will feature plenary talks from leading Christian thinkers, worship led by Porter's Gate, facilitated conversation over shared meals, and break-out sessions designed to encourage more focused disciplinary conversations about the integration of faith, scholarship, and teaching.\n\nBuilding Sustainable Peace After Genocide: Lessons from Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe “Building Sustainable Peace after Genocide: Lessons from Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina” webinar on April 11 and 12, 2024 marked the 30th anniversary of the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This LFP sponsored webinar, which Dr. Gerald J. Beyer of Villanova University hosted, included participants from numerous countries, including Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Internationally renowned academics and peace activists discussed their first-hand knowledge and experience of peace building in the Rwandan and Bosnian contexts. Among other topics, they considered the role religion in peacebuilding and fomenting conflict, women as peacebuilders, international law and transitional justice, and the methods, key actors, successes, and ongoing obstacles in the peacebuilding process since the tragedies. They discussed how religious believers courageously and creatively engaged in peacemaking activities in areas characterized by ethnic and religious tensions after the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia. The goal of the webinar was to engender a renewed commitment at church related higher educational institutions to equip peacebuilders with knowledge and insights needed to transform themselves and the world. In addition to providing an opportunity to remember and learn from the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia, The webinar responded to Pope Francis’s call to members of all the world’s religions to intensify their collaboration in the task of peacebuilding. In this vein, the webinar provided participants with a deep understanding of the latest theoretical and practical initiatives in peacebuilding and transitional justice more generally. For those who were not able to attend, the sessions devoted to Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina are available on the Villanova University YouTube page.\n\nChristianity and Core Texts at Global/Cultural Crossroads\n\nOn March 30-31, 2023, Grove City College hosted an on-campus Lilly Fellows Regional Conference on “Christianity and Core Texts at Global/Cultural Crossroads.” Panelists were asked to deliver scholarly or pedagogical papers on a primary text or core text from a non-Western tradition that engages with Christian faith, practice, or tradition, including works of literature, philosophy, theology, history, and the fine arts. Panels engaged with works and authors from Uganda, Rwanda, Peru, India, Japan, Martinique, Cameroon, the United States, and various Christian communities in the Middle East. Gene Luen Yang, an award-winning graphic novelist and cartoonist, delivered the keynote address on Thursday evening. Alongside visuals of his cartooning work throughout the years, Yang offered a personal account of his life as he navigated the tensions and harmonies between his Chinese heritage, his search for vocational direction as an artist, and his Catholic faith. On Friday afternoon, Dr. Susan Van Zanten (Valparaiso University) gave a plenary address centered on Christian ethics in contemporary ecocriticism and West African fiction, particularly the recent novel How Beautiful We Were (2021) by Cameroonian author Imbolo Mbue. Dr. Van Zanten’s lecture offered a critical framework for connecting global literatures in light of current environmental crises."
