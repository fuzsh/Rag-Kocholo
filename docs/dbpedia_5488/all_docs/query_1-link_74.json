Washington State University, Eastern Washington University, Whitworth University, and the Community Colleges of Spokane also have facilities here.\n\nDowntown Spokane\n\nPunctuated by an urban river gorge, Downtown is where city life and nature’s brilliance live side by side. Walk through the city’s core, distinguished by historic buildings, before taking in the mightiness of the Spokane Falls, all located right in the heart of the city.\n\nBrowne's Addition\n\nIt’s Spokane’s oldest neighborhood. Browne’s Addition is a fine example of Spokane history and the result of some of the city’s earliest visionaries. Filled with stately Victorian mansions, small Arts & Crafts bungalows and mid-century apartment buildings, this neighborhood is now an energetic, artistic and eclectic area to experience.\n\nKendall Yards\n\nKendall Yards is Spokane’s premier urban neighborhood, featuring scenic views, diverse businesses, quality homes and walkable streets. Just a five-minute stroll along the Centennial Trail from downtown, explore the wild beauty of the Spokane River Gorge and some of the area’s best local restaurants.\n\nSouth Perry District\n\nThe Perry District has become its own thriving community within the greater sphere of Spokane. Once abandoned buildings are now filled with sound and life. New growth and development make it a perfect mix of new and old for any traveler to experience.\n\nGarland District\n\nTucked on Spokane’s Northside, the Garland District is where culture meets history. A walkable neighborhood, the Garland District is where visitors can explore art galleries and antique shops while stopping in at record and bookstores all under the shadow of the some of the city’s beloved landmarks."
