        "text": "About South Perry\n\n​\n\nThe South Perry Neighborhood is located just southeast of the downtown core and next to the University District and medical district. It runs from about 8th Avenue up to 11th along Perry Street, This walkable neighborhood center is filled with shops, great food and a variety of outdoor events. About 5000 residents call the neighborhood home. The neighborhood character is surprisingly quiet given it is less than a mile from downtown. But it is clear it is up and coming as well due to the proximity to downtown and the resurgence of the South Perry Center.\n\nThis inviting neighborhood is the perfect fit for Spokane's first cohousing community. The Pacific Islander calls The Perry District: A tiny-sized village in a medium-sized city.\n\nUniversity District\n\nThe bustling University District is just a few blocks from our site, and home to six higher education campuses.\n\nFamilies\n\nFor families with young children, Grant Elementary School is located within walking distance, and a number of public, private and Montessori schools are nearby.\n\nParks and Open Space\n\nLiberty and Grant parks are also only a few blocks from the site, offering open space, ball fields, play structures, and access to the Ben Burr Trail. ​\n\nAbout Spokane\n\n​\n\n\"Near Nature, Near Perfect.\" Spokane's motto embodies the city's synergy of green space (with easy access to lakes, skiing, hiking and biking) and it's urban vibrancy (restaurants, breweries, performance venues and more). With a metro population of 593,466, the city features many smaller neighborhoods, each with their own feel. Spokane's cost of living is affordable, with food, transportation and utilities all below the national average.\n\nHigher Education\n\nSpokane boasts six institutions of higher education, including Washington State, Eastern Washington, Gonzaga, and Whitworth Universities. The presence of these institutions, along with dozens of independent arts and culture organizations, have lead to a strong and diverse arts and culture community. Examples include outdoor summer symphony concerts on a floating Spokane River stage and numerous sculpture installations."
