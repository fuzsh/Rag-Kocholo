It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).\n\nBrief history\n\nFounded in 1883 in Sumner, Washington by George Whitworth as the Sumner Academy, it became Whitworth College in 1890. In 1899, Whitworth moved from Sumner to Tacoma, and in 1914, it moved from Tacoma to Spokane.\n\nWhitworth's board of trustees voted to change the institution's official name to Whitworth University effective July 1, 2007 [http://www.whitworth.edu/Students/Whitworthian/V96/I17/Date-set-for-name-change-to-university.html] .\n\ntudent life\n\nWhitworth offers students many opportunities to enjoy college life. Every Thursday at 9:30 p.m., ASWU offers free entertainment, known as \"Half Past 9.\"fact|date=February 2008 Recent Half Past 9s have included concerts, film showings, and comedy shows. ASWU also offers campus-wide programs each year such as Pirate Idol and Relay for Life.\n\nThe over-arching goal of Whitworth Student Life is to build a warm and supportive residential community where students have multiple points of contact – with roommates and other residents, with their student leaders and with the resident directors.\n\nThe editor of Reslife.net, an online magazine serving student-life professionals nationwide, heard about Whitworth’s approach to residence hall staffing and programming and asked the college's associate dean of students to write an article outlining his philosophy. The article recently was re-printed for the Association of College and University Housing Officers International.\n\nThe article points out the fact that Whitworth’s leadership program, developed in the mid-1980s, employs a greater number and variety of student leaders than is typical at most colleges and universities. In addition to the traditional slate of resident assistants, each Whitworth residence hall has ministry coordinators, health coordinators, and cultural diversity advocates – positions quite unique in nature [http://www.whitworth.edu/GeneralInformation/WhyWhitworth/12.htm] .\n\nHaving these additional positions means that more students with more diverse skills and interests are able to take advantage of Whitworth’s student-leadership opportunities and to benefit from the personal growth and vocational experiences that they provide. Additionally, the time commitment is relatively low for most positions, so student leaders also can be involved in other extracurricular activities.\n\nHiring additional student leaders also results in a ratio of residents to leaders in Whitworth’s residence halls of about ten to one, compared to the 20-to-one ratio at many other institutionsfact|date=February 2008, including private liberal-arts colleges.\n\nDorm life\n\nWhitworth offers 10 residence halls for undergraduate students:\n\n* Arend Hall\n\n* Baldwin-Jenkins Hall\n\n* Ballard Hall\n\n* Boppell Hall\n\n* Duvall Hall\n\n* McMillan Hall\n\n* Schumacher Hall\n\n* Stewart Hall\n\n* The Village\n\n* Warren Hall\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to live on campus for at least two years, and many opt to stay longer to be part of student leadership teams or to live in one of the newer buildings. In addition to the 10 residence halls, Whitworth sponsors several 'theme houses' each year. Some recurring themes include Cross-Country, Swimming, Women's Health and Wellness, and Simplicity in Living.\n\n[Whitworth residence halls: http://www.whitworth.edu/administration/studentlife/residencelife&housing/livingoncampus/residencehalls/index.htm]\n\nAthletics\n\nWhitworth's athletics teams are the Pirates (or, unofficially, the Bucs). The university offers 20 varsity sports and competes in the Northwest Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. Men can compete in cross-country, football, basketball, swimming, track and field (indoor and outdoor), golf, tennis, soccer and baseball; women can compete in soccer, volleyball, basketball, swimming, track and field (indoor and outdoor), golf, tennis, and softball.\n\nIn the last eight years, 20 Whitworth athletes have been named Academic All-Americans and more than 42 have received All-America recognition. Since 2000, five Pirate teams have achieved the highest average GPA in NCAA Division III for their respective sports, and 28 teams have captured Northwest Conference championships. The Pirates won the Northwest Conference McIlroy-Lewis Trophy for the best combined standings across all sports in 2008 and 2005, and Whitworth has placed among the top three conference programs for four consecutive years [http://www.whitworth.edu/GeneralInformation/WhitworthFacts/AdditionalFacts.htm#Athletics] .\n\nIn 2007, the Pirates won six NWC titles and added four runner-up finishes, winning the trophy for the second time in the past three years. Also in 2007, the women's soccer team made it to the second round of the DIII tourney while their coach, Sean Bushey, received a national Coach of the Year honor. [http://www.whitworth.edu/GeneralInformation/WhitworthFacts/AdditionalFacts.htm#Athletics] . In 2006, swimmer Samantha Kephart won two national championships – in the 100- and convert|200|yd|sing=on butterfly events, respectively – at the 2006 NCAA Division III swim tournament, setting a Division III record in the 200 butterfly. In addition, the Whitworth Men's Swim Team has won six consecutive conference championshipswhen|date=February 2008. The 2006 Pirate football team had an 11-1 record, its best everfact|date=February 2008, finished the season ranked 9th in the nation, and made it to the second round of the NCAA Div. III playoffs. Tight end Michael Allan, a 2005 AFCA DIII All-American and a pre-season 2006 All-America pick, was invited to participate in the 2006 NFL Combine and to play in both the Hula Bowl and the Shrine East-West All-Star Game. He was the only NCAA DIII football athlete invited to all three events. Among his many postseason honors, Allan was named to the Associated Press Little All-America Team and the D3football.com All-America First Team. On May 8, 2007 he was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 7th round of the NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2005, men's soccer went to the DIII Final Four and finished third in the nationfact|date=February 2008. In that same year, the women's volleyball team set home attendance records while winning the Northwest Conference championship and going on to compete in the regional finals. And the college won the Northwest Conference's McIlroy-Lewis All-Sports Trophy, which measures athletic excellence across all competitive fields.\n\nIn 2004, track-and-field star Kristen Shields was named U.S. College-Division Academic All-American of the Year (along with the University of Connecticut's Emeka Okafor).\n\nThe men's 1996 basketball team finished second in the nation in the NAIA. In 2007, the men's basketball team won another NWC title, defeating Lewis and Clark 69-62 [http://www.whitworth.edu/Students/Whitworthian/V97/I11/Pirates-Clinch.html] .\n\nWhitworth won a national championship as an NAIA school in 1960, when the baseball team defeated Georgia Southern University, 4-0fact|date=February 2008.\n\n[Why Whitworth?: http://www.whitworth.edu/generalInformation/whywhitworth/7.htm] [Additional Whitworth Facts: http://www.whitworth.edu/GeneralInformation/WhitworthFacts/AdditionalFacts.htm#Athletics]\n\nRecent faculty highlights\n\n* Associate Professor of English Laurie Lamon, '78, was chosen by U.S. Poet Laureate Donald Hall as one of two new voices in poetry to receive 2007 Witter Bynner Fellowships.
