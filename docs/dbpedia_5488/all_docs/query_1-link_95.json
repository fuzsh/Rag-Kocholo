        "text": "Several major construction projects with a combined value exceeding $178 million are underway or recently completed at Spokane-area colleges.\n\nOne of the larger projects underway is the 90,000-square-foot, four-story medical and health education building at 840 E. Spokane Falls Blvd., which is expected to be completed this year.\n\nGonzaga University and the University of Washington have committed to a long-term lease for the space to accommodate their medical school partnership.\n\nBouton Construction Co., of Spokane, is the contractor on the $60 million project at the southeast corner of Hamilton Street and Spokane Falls Boulevard, and the Spokane office of CollinsWoerman architecture firm designed it.\n\nIn west Spokane, Spokane Falls Community College is developing a $42.2 million facility in which the school plans to merge its fine visual art programs, including photography, ceramics, sculpture, and printmaking.\n\nConstruction of the 56,500-square-foot facility began in August and is scheduled to be complete by July 2023, says Clinton Brown, director of capital construction.\n\nThe SFCC faculty worked with Spokane-based ALSC Architects PS and Seattle-based HDA Architecture to design the building.\n\nMeantime, construction of a temporary facility for the photography program in another building on the campus was completed in January. Dardan Inc., of Spokane, was the general contractor.\n\nJust north of Spokane, at Whitworth University, construction of the new $20 million Dornsife Health Sciences building is substantially complete, and the university currently is furnishing and equipping the three-level, 40,000-square-foot facility, says Fred Johnson, director of capital projects.\n\nThe building will be ready to accommodate students in fall 2022, he adds.\n\nThe design-build team for the project consisted of Spokane-based Walker Construction Inc. and NAC Architecture.\n\nNear the center of the Gonzaga campus, instruction within the new John and Joan Bollier Family Center for Integrated Science and Engineering facility began in January.\n\nLocated on the south side of Cataldo Way, north of Lake Arthur, just west of the Paccar Center, and just south of Hughes Hall, the $56.1 million project is three stories high, with 82,600 square feet of floor space.\n\nWalker Construction was the contractor on the project\n\nLike this story?"
