        "text": "There are a wide range of restaurants in Spokane. The Wild Sage American Bistro is the place you are most guaranteed satisfaction. It’s upscale, quiet, and most importantly, the food is impeccable. Just as good is the Sante Restaurant, which is also a classy restaurant with creative dishes. The best place for breakfast is easily Frank’s Diner. The Flying Goat is a crazy popular restaurant with a hipster vibe, and interesting dishes, like a cole slaw pork pizza. Mizuna, Churchill’s, and Chicken-N-More. Clinkerdagger (or just Clink’s) overlooks the falls, and is comparable to Churchill’s, considering the quality of their steak and ribs. On campus at Whitworth, there is a Food Court, as well as a cafe with Mexican food, a grill, and subs, two coffee shops, and a quick-stop food mart. Spokane doesn’t have too much traffic congestion, and is nowhere near as bad as Seattle, which tops lists of worst traffic congestion all the time. Rush hour can be a pain, like in any city, but isn’t too bad compared to other cities. I-90 can get slow during commuting hours, and if there is an accident. Overall, Spokane is tied for last place in terms of metro areas with traffic congestion, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it!"
