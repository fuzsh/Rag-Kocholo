        "text": "Higher education institutions regularly exchange practices, successes and challenges, and routinely learn from each other. The College of Idaho has established three groupings of institutions for comparison.\n\nPeer institutions have been selected as most like the College in enrollment (size), curriculum and degrees offered (liberal arts/baccalaureate), and geographic location (suburban/rural).\n\nAspirational institutions are similar to peers but recognized as high achieving institutions.\n\nRegional institutions are similar types of institutions (private/liberal arts) that are located relatively close to the College."
