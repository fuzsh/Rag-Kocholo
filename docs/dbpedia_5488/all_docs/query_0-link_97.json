        "text": "Meet Nara Shin '23! We asked Nara what it's like to be a strategic communication major: Growing up in a family that lived based on the governmental and local non-profit organizational help, I have wanted to help families in hopeless situations by engaging with organizations with their vision to work for equity and inclusion in society. With my passion, I was in several leadership roles in my high school volunteer teams that intended to make changes in society...I realized how communicating with the world better can introduce a certain organization's vision and the work they do, and without a communicator, the mission cannot be driven. I decided to study strategic communication to connect an organization's call to work for equity and inclusion with people who are seeking the call. I joined The Whitworthian in my first semester just because of my interest, and I had a chance to write about the passing of Librarian Kathy Watts. I put my best effort into my article so that the Whitworth community can remember Watts for her kindness and impact on our community. However, one day in January, I got an email from the editor-in-chief of The Whitworthian that he received a phone call from Kathy's mother-in-law that she was extremely impressed and grateful for the article that I wrote...I realized at that moment that my article did touch someone very deeply and that my words have power, and my work does touch the lives of many people in our community. That is the reason why I want to help people by writing and sending a message of hope for people. [Whitworth] is a caring and loving community. I was surprised that professors make efforts to remember students' names. Classmates, student leaders, and professors remembered me. It is more like a family than an institution because people are caring for the people around them...I also want to be a family member to new students or students who feel lonely.\""
