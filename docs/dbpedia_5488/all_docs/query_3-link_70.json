        "text": "Students at Whitworth University have many convenient options for food, drinks and treats to fuel up on during the day. If you will be living on campus, you will have a meal plan with a certain number of swipes into the dining hall and Flex Dollars you can spend everywhere else. Here are the options that Whitworth has to fit every dining need.\n\nMind & Hearth Coffee House\n\nThe Mind & Hearth is at a prime location in the Hixson Union Building (HUB). It has great drinks, delicious food and even macarons from miFLAVOUR, a local French bakery. This coffee shop is the best spot to do homework if you like a noisier atmosphere. It is also a great spot to have group meetings or to talk with a professor over coffee through Whitworth’s Dine with a Mind program.\n\nThe Pines Cafe\n\nThe Pines is Whitworth’s newest coffee shop and is located near Hawthorne Hall. It is farther from the center of campus but still walkable. If you want a Starbucks coffee, The Pines offers all the drinks that a traditional Starbucks offers. It also has additional delicious food and drink options such as breakfast sandwiches, sub sandwiches and salads from Subconnection, Lotus Plant Energy drinks, smoothies, and pastries. The spacious lobby of The Pines is perfect for studying with all the glass windows and a fireplace.\n\nRobinson Science Hall Coffee Bar\n\nThis coffee bar is a go-to if you want some caffeine between classes. It is in a great location inside Robinson Science Hall, which is in the center of campus. While it has a more limited menu than The Pines, it also serves Starbucks coffee and has almost everything you could need in a pinch, including soups and boba tea.\n\nWhitworth Dining Hall\n\nThe dining hall, located in the HUB, is the main place where students eat their meals. It offers breakfast, lunch and dinner options seven days a week. It is a buffet-style dining hall with a communal feel that allows for eating with one person or a big group. The food stations in the dining hall include a salad bar, grill, sandwich bar, international cuisine, pizza, and a section that offers different types of food every day. The dining hall has options for everyone, including vegan and gluten-free food.\n\nQdoba\n\nQdoba serves Mexican-style cuisine and is located in a corner of the HUB with a convenience store inside. The store sells snacks, candy, ice cream and drinks that students can buy with Flex dollars. A major perk about the Qdoba area is its late-night hours, allowing students to grab a bite after classes end for the night. This is a great place to get food and drinks for a study break or to hang out with friends.\n\nStudents at Whitworth can download the “Everyday” app to know what is on the daily menu at the dining hall and coffee shops.\n\nWritten by Denali Herrick ’24"
