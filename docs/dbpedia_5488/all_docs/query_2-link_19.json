        "text": "Buildings & Landscapes is the leading source for scholarly work on vernacular architecture of North America and beyond. The journal continues VAF’s tradition of scholarly publication going back to the first Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture in 1982. Published through the University of Minnesota Press since 2007, the journal moved from one to two issues per year in 2009. It began publishing full color images in 2020.\n\nBuildings & Landscapes examines the places that people build and experience every day: houses and cities, farmsteads and alleys, churches and courthouses, subdivisions and shopping malls. The journal’s contributors include scholars, students, and practitioners; historians and architectural historians; preservationists, architects, geographers, anthropologists, and folklorists; and others whose work involves documenting, analyzing, and interpreting vernacular forms. The journal advances these diverse approaches to built environments as windows into human life and culture, basing scholarship on both fieldwork and archival research. The editors particularly welcome submission of articles on topics related to the study of North American vernacular architecture or that otherwise broaden the context of North American architecture and cultural landscapes.\n\nSubmissions\n\nAuthor’s Guidelines for Buildings & Landscapes may be found here.\n\nThe editors of Buildings & Landscapes: Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Forum invite submissions of articles that explore the ways in which vernacular architecture constructs the every day. Our subject matter includes all aspects of vernacular architecture and urban, suburban, and rural landscapes seen through interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary methods. The editors encourage submission of scholarly articles that integrate fieldwork and archival/primary source research into original arguments about the history of everyday buildings and/or landscapes. Authors are urged to draw linkages between the physical aspects of the built environment they study and the people who create, consume, use, and inhabit it. If an author is unsure about a manuscript’s fit for the journal, they are encouraged to contact the editors in advance of a formal submission.\n\nManuscripts are considered on a rolling basis; authors may submit articles for consideration at any time. Articles submitted to Buildings & Landscapes will be assessed using a double-blind peer review process; manuscripts should not be submitted for publication elsewhere while under review by the journal. All scholars, students, and practitioners in the field are eligible to submit manuscripts; it is not necessary for articles to have been presented at VAF annual meetings, nor for contributors to be members of the VAF.\n\nManuscripts should conform to the Author Guidelines and The Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition). Please send electronic copies of completed articles (approximately 25 pages of text) with illustrations (10-20) and bibliographic endnotes to both editors. Please feel free to direct any inquiries to either editor via email:\n\nMichael Chiarappa\n\nWashington College\n\nmchiarappa2@washcoll.edu\n\nMargaret Grubiak\n\nVillanova University\n\nmargaret.grubiak@villanova.edu\n\nAmanda C.
