        "text": "Location: About 20 minutes North of Spokane, Washington.\n\nEnrollment: 2,789\n\nBONNER PROGRAM AT A GLANCE\n\nName of Campus-Wide Center: Center for Service Learning and Community Engagement\n\nType of Program: Bonner Leaders\n\nYear Began: 1999\n\nNumber of Bonner Leaders: 24\n\nActive in Bonner AmeriCorps Ed Award: 0\n\nActive in Other AmeriCorps Ed Award: 0\n\nActive in Learn & Serve CBR: Yes\n\nActive in FIPSE Civic Ed Certficate/Minor: Yes\n\nReading. Writing. Research. Lectures. These are the tools of learning. And at Whitworth University, we use all these and a little more.\n\nAs an added tool, professors integrate service-learning in the community into dozens of courses across the curriculum as a way to apply course concepts and to engage in critical thinking, creative expression, or structured reflection. You might tutor low-income youth for Educational Psychology or archive museum holdings for Asian American Literature. You may lead drama workshops for mentally ill adults or do something as simple as planting trees. Whatever you do, you'll walk away from your classes with not only a deeper understanding of the material, but with a sense of civic responsibility, and the experience of living out Whitworth's mission – to honor God, follow Christ, and serve humanity.\n\nKEY CONTACTS\n\nPresident: Dr. Beck Taylor\n\nCenter Director: Rhosetta Rhodes\n\nBonner Senior Intern(s): Vacant\n\nBonner Congress Representatives: Vacant\n\nMORE ABOUT US\n\nService and Service-Learning Numbers\n\nCenter for Service-Learning & Community Engagement\n\n1999 - Present\n\nHour summary\n\nTotal SERVE Trip hours……………………5,700\n\nTotal Community Building Day hours…….165,032\n\nTotal Service-Learning hours……………...91,868\n\nTotal Bonner Leader hours………………...54,580\n\nTOTAL HOURS…………………………..146,448\n\nStudent summary\n\nTotal SERVE Trip students………………........147\n\nTotal Community Building Day students…..5,700\n\nTotal Service-Learning students……………5779\n\nTotal Bonner Leader students………………...304\n\nTOTAL STUDENTS……………………….11,930\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES\n\nWhitworth University has 24 Bonner students who provided 4,732 hours of service to the Spokane community during academic year 2010-2011.\n\nOf special note, the Whitworth Bonner Leaders co-led the annual Food for Thought: A Community Dinner this year. This event occured during fall as the last event in Spokane's Homeless Awarness Week. The idea for the event was the creation of Katie Pettit, previous Bonner Senior Intern. Katie was speaking one day to a homeless gentlemen who remarked that it would be nice to be able to interact with \"regular\" people so they could understand that the homeless are like everyone else and shouldn't be feared. Katie and a few other students coordinated the Food for Thought dinner and invited the entire Spokane community to eat and converse together. They walked the streets and passed out invitations to those who are homeless and explained the purpose of the dinner. The event was such a success that they have found sponsors to host the event. This year, they had to turn people away. The lines to enter wrapped around the block. The extensive news coverage has already generated sponsors and participants for noext year.\n\nTo teach students about poverty, the Bonner Leaders partnered with another group on campus to creata a life size Candy Land game. A homemade Candy Land game was spread across the floor, with squares containing facts and solutions about poverty . The Candy Land game was held on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. More than 100 students attended the event.\n\nWorking with the West Central Neighborhood Partnership, students worked withthe neighborhood to create a Neighborhood Business Associaition as part of the neighborhood's economic development plan. The West Central Neighborhood Partnership is a collaborative neighborhood revitalization project between Whitworth University and the West Central Neighborhood Council. This community engagement initiative connects students, faculty and course work to address critical need areas identified by the West Central neighborhood organizations and residents. Students engage in activities to address Workforce development and job training, Job creation and retention through business development, and Neighborhood revitalization through the development and adoption of a neighborhood plan to address poverty, housing, community services and facilities within the West Central Neighborhood.\n\nThis year, Whitworth Bonners went to Mobile, Alabama to work with Habitat for Humanity during spring break. Students engaged in service with Habitat for Humanity rebuilding homes. Whitworth students also went to Jamaica this year to run a Vacation Bible School for the Jamaica Christian School for the Deaf, building relationships with the staff and starting construction on a vocational center at the school. The students also spent time at the Blossom Garden Orphanage caring for 100 Jamiacan orphans.\n\nWhitworth Annual Report.\n\n2009 ANNUAL REPORT OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES\n\n2009 Annual Report\n\nStudent Leadership Planning: Click here to view your 30 Boxes calendar\n\nClick here for Congress Leadership Plans:\n\nWhitworth Congress Action Planning\n\nSPRING 2010 INITIATIVES\n\nServe 2.0\n\nStaff Point Person for project: Rhosetta Rhodes\n\nStudent Point Person for project: Vacant\n\nPlanning to submit mini-grant proposal: no\n\nBonner Program or Campus-Wide Wiki status: not created\n\nParticipating in Bonner Video Project: No\n\nStudent BVL (Bonner Video Liaison) contact info posted on link: Bonner Video Liaisons\n\nNeed a Flip Cam?
