        "text": "Whitworth University's safety program is fortunate to be supported by area law enforcement agencies. Because Whitworth is located within the boundaries of Spokane County, while outside the city limits, our most direct law enforcement contact is with the county sheriff's department. From time to time, however, particularly if you are a resident of the city, you will find the city police department to be an important resource.\n\nIn any emergency, even on campus, 911 should be your first call. On campus, non-emergency security matters should be reported to the Whitworth Security Office: 509.777.4444.\n\nSpokane County Sheriff's Office\n\nEmergency: 911\n\n(Website includes links to information about sex offenders and neighborhood watch programs)\n\nCrime reports: 509.532.9266\n\nOther business: 509.477.5980\n\nAddress: Public Safety Building, Spokane, WA 99260\n\nWeb address: www.spokanesheriff.org\n\nSpokane Police Department"
