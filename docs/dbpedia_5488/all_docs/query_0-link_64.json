The visit is an important decision factor. It can make all the difference. Ask lots of questions and be curious. Although it may seem like admissions counselors are very busy, they are there to answer any questions. If you forget to ask something in the interview, go ahead and just send them an email. They'll be happy to get back to you and help however they can.\n\nJD from Livingston, MT\n\nBe excited and willing to meet new people and have a great time. Try to visit during the fall or late spring--it's beautiful during these times. Visit a class if possible, and talk to current students. They will tell you all about the programs offered at Whitworth, the caliber of students and faculty, the integration of faith and learning, the emphasis on the Christian community, and the warm atmosphere that permeates the university.\n\nJenna from Grand Junction, CO\n\nVisit the campus!!! I didn't and ended up choosing a different university, but after just five weeks, I was home and enrolling at Whitworth because I knew in my heart that Whitworth was the place for me. Don't try to persuade yourself out of a school you think you will fit at because your friends are going somewhere else - I did that, and now I'm behind in credits because I missed a semester. Go and visit all colleges that you are interested in...it really does wonders. Try and talk to students at the schools you are interested in as well; most students at my school love to share why they picked Whitworth / what makes it great, and they can give you real insight about the college. Finally, whatever college you choose, GET INVOLVED! Become part of dorm government, join an intramural, club, or activity, etc. Do something! It will help you make friends and give you a greater sense of purpose at your school.\n\nRylee from Spokane, WA\n\nDefinitely apply and apply early, even if you do not think you have the grades in high school. I received a D during my junior year of high school (because of outside, familial circumstances), but Whitworth looked beyond my academic capabilities and looked to my extracurriculars and character traits. In fact, they notified me of admission within 7 days and granted me over $10,000 in scholarships that could be renewed year after year.\n\nJoshua from Mission, TX\n\nGo to the school and talk to the students on campus. It is a great time to get into the school if you are a science major.\n\nRyan from Kettle Falls, WA\n\ndon't be intimidated by the seemingly confusing registration process, housing forms, and required classes. if you have any questions don't hesitate to call or ask in person and people will be more than willing to help you out. also, the faculty here is great, so don't be afraid to call a department chair just to chat about your intended major or for some more information. finally, if you visit, be sure to visit dorms and see what dorm life is like too.\n\nKatelyn from Union, OR\n\ntake some time to look into the professor's qualifications. whitworth has some amazing academic minds that are beyond qualified and have extensive credentials and field experience. these are great contacts to have and amazing sources of information.\n\nHailey from Greenacres, WA\n\nAny student that is considering attending Whitworth University should stay overnight on campus with a current student! It is the best way to get a genuine feel for the campus and school.\n\nAnya from Medford, OR\n\nAPPLY EARLY! It is so worth it because you will be accepted faster and have first choice for which dorm you want. Also, campus visits give you the best experience for making the final college decision. Especially try to stay overnight in a dorm if possible so you can get a glimpse of student life, which is tons of fun.\n\nEmily from Woodinville, WA\n\nDon't look at just one college. Make sure you do your research first. Also, if you are able, visiting the campuses is key. You never really know how much you are going to like a place until you go and see if for yourself. A lot of the time campus visits end up being the deciding factor for choosing a college.\n\nTaylor from Rathdrum, ID\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nSalem, OR\n\nEllensburg, WA\n\nCheney, WA\n\nSpokane, WA\n\nTacoma, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nPullman, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nBellingham, WA\n\nStanford, CA\n\nPortland, OR\n\nSee All"
