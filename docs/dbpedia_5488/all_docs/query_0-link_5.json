        "text": "Whitworth's campus of first-rate facilities and tall pines offers a beautiful, friendly and secure environment for exploring academic life and American culture. Students can enjoy a championship-winning athletics program, more than 40 clubs, and numerous opportunities to get involved. Whitworth has a thriving international club, which plans activities and excursions throughout the year and hosts a spectacular banquet each November. About 65 percent of Whitworth’s students live on campus.\n\nThe university is located in the greater metropolitan area of Spokane, which is the largest city between Minneapolis and Seattle and the hub of the Inland Northwest region. Spokane offers an ideal climate, an active downtown, nearby mountains featuring ski resorts and summer water sports, a friendly atmosphere and thriving community life. If you study for a full academic year, or during the university's January term, it is possible to take skiing, snowboarding and ice skating for course credit. Athletic facilities are available for use free of charge to ISEP students.\n\nPeer mentors are available to ISEP students during the international student orientation period."
