        "text": "Degree Programs Offered by Whitworth University\n\nWhitworth University appears in our ranking of the Top 50 Online Christian Colleges for Future Missionaries.\n\nWhitworth University offers both undergraduate degree programs for incoming freshmen and adult learners as well as programs for graduate students. With more than 100 programs available for undergrads, the university makes it easy for students to find programs that appeal to their interests and career goals. It has an Army ROTC program that allows students to skip basic training and enlist in the military as an officer. The kinesiology program includes internships that let students gain some practical training with patients before they enter a graduate program. Some of the university’s programs include various concentrations for students too such as its music program. The concentrations in that program include:\n\nComposition\n\nInstrumental Performance\n\nMusic Ministry\n\nVoice Performance\n\nPiano Pedagogy\n\nTo meet the needs of adults and other non-traditional learners, Whitworth University established the School of Continuing Education, which offers programs with evening classes. Adult students can choose from several majors, including criminal justice administration, human services, humanities, public service administration, and organizational management. The university’s elementary education program lets students take nighttime classes to get a degree that also qualifies them for becoming licensed teachers in Washington. There are also certificate programs that have 12 to 24 required credits, including certificates in accounting and operations management.\n\nThe degree programs for graduate students allow them to pick from nine different fields. Teacher certification programs give students the chance to develop strong teaching skills and become licensed educators. Similar programs are available for students who have college degrees but need to get their teaching licenses and for those who want to add one or more endorsements to their licenses. One popular program available from Whitworth University is its Master of Business Administration (MBA). It includes six-week classes that meet twice a week in downtown Spokane. Athletic training, theology, applied behavior analysis, and marriage and family therapy are among the other programs that Whitworth University offers for graduate students.\n\nAbout Whitworth University\n\nWhitworth University is a private university in Spokane, Washington. Established in 1910 as Whitworth College, it opened in a small town not far from Tacoma. It offered classes for students before Washington became an American state. It moved to Tacoma around the turn of the century and then to Spokane after the city donated land for the new campus. Whitworth would gain more attention after it moved to a new campus in the city and after it took over the operations of the old Spokane Junior College. The Board of Trustees voted in favor of a name change in 2006, which led to the school becoming Whitworth University the following year. The university uses the name of George F. Whitworth who was its founder and a Presbyterian minister. Whitworth has a close relationship to and affiliation with the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWhitworth University Accreditation Details\n\nThe Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) granted regional accreditation to Whitworth due to its academic policies and strengths. This is the accreditation that allows students who cannot afford the cost of attendance to apply for aid via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and what entitles students to transfer their credits. Among the organizations that awarded Whitworth specialty accreditation include the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).\n\nWhitworth University Application Requirements\n\nWhitworth prides itself on accepting students who have success in college. The university looks at the student’s background, including high school grades, extracurricular activities and test scores. Prospective students can use the Whitworth Application or the Common Application, which makes it easy for students to apply to multiple schools. Students need to have a guidance counselor or teacher complete a recommendation form. They can use either the recommendation form outline available on the website or submit a written letter to the university. Though Whitworth also asks for a high school transcript, it gives undergrads the choice between submitting a standardized test score or going through an on-campus interview.\n\nAdult students must apply to the School of Continuing Studies. Whitworth encourages prospective students to visit the university and meet with an admissions counselor before they apply. Adult students must submit three letters of recommendation or reference forms. One letter should come from someone who works with the student, and another should come from someone who can speak to the reasons why the student would do well at the university. Whitworth asks for an academic letter of recommendation from those who took classes within the last two years. Students should also provide a transcript, personal statement of 500 to 700 words and their college or high school transcripts. Graduate applicants must meet the requirements of each department or program, which can include letters of recommendation, personal essays, and test scores. They’re also responsible for making sure that the university receives an application, application fee, and transcript.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\n\nAt Whitworth, the cost of attendance depends on whether students enroll in traditional daytime programs or those designed for adults and evening students. Traditional attendance costs $21,900 each semester for full-time students. Those taking fewer than 12 credits will pay $1,825 per credit hour. The university’s evening programs charge students $550 per credit hour. Dual enrollment students can take up to two classes at a time and pay $155, but most local high schools pay for the students’ classes. Graduate students generally pay $550 per credit hour in a certificate program and $665 per credit hour in a degree program. This cost rises to $885 per credit hour in the MBA program and drops to $575 per credit hour in the theology program.\n\nThe financial aid packages that students receive will include different programs based on their enrollment status. Millions of dollars in scholarships go to worthy students each year. The university offers a $1,000 scholarship to any future undergrad who attends an open house event or takes part in another special event. Those who meet income restrictions and other requirements can qualify for the College Bound Scholarship from Washington, which covers the cost of room, board and other expenses that students have. Some of the other financial aid available for all students in the degree programs offered by Whitworth University include student employment, government grants, scholarships for military students and loans.\n\nRelated Resources:"
