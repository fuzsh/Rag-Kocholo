They have banded together to form an umbrella organization complete with constitution and by-laws - the Associated Students of Whitworth College. This organization has played a responsible role in student life beyond the classroom. Note in particular the numerous activities and projects supported by student government during the 1989-1990 academic year (Box 2)."
