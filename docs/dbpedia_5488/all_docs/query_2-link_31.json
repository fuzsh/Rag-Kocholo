        "text": "Our nation was born on the boats of faithful Protestants as they braved a daunting trans-Atlantic journey toward freedom and the great unknown.\n\nFind Your School in 5 Minutes or Less\n\nMany schools have rolling admissions, which means you can start a program in a few weeks!\n\nAmerica's Founding Fathers believed that as \"one nation, under God,\" this country would ultimately find success.\n\nChristian values are embedded within our country's defining documents and scattered throughout our history textbooks.\n\nBecause Christianity lies at the heart of our convictions, it is only natural for it to underpin our educational system.\n\nThe most prestigious post-secondary institutions in America began as faith-based universities. Puritans founded Harvard and Yale, and Princeton was strictly Presbyterian at the time of its establishment. However, all but a rare few have since transitioned to strictly secular institutions.\n\nNotre Dame, Brigham Young University, Georgetown, and several others have withstood the winds of change and held fast to their Christian roots.\n\nStudents at these and other faith-based schools have the opportunity to take religion courses, attend campus-based church services and devotionals, and enjoy the spiritual growth that comes with living and learning in a supportive community of faithful students.\n\nAttending a college that supports your faith and values can help you grow spiritually and academically.\n\nThere is a level of comfort found in attending a college that supports your fundamental values, and surrounding yourself with other students who believe and live their beliefs only makes it easier for you to continue living and believing yours.\n\nThe integration of religious and secular education offers many benefits. Learning opportunities include study-abroad programs, service-based learning experiences, and faith-focused activities.\n\nReligion courses are required at many Christian schools as part of their general education requirements. Christian schools' programs are consistently ranked among the top in the country, a testament to their quality.\n\nDedicated Christians can attend any school they want, but for students whose priority is to continue being strengthened in their faith, there are fantastic opportunities all across America to attend Christian colleges and universities.\n\nOnline Programs That Might Interest You\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nEDsmart provides a simple, reliable, and honest ranking of the best Christian colleges.\n\nIn our analysis of the best Christian colleges, we looked at several factors and ranked our list of schools accordingly.\n\nAffordability (average net price)\n\nStudent Satisfaction (retention rate)\n\nAcademic Quality (4-year graduation rate)\n\nMedian Earnings (the median earnings of former students who received federal financial aid, at 10 years after entering the school)\n\nEach data point is ranked with equal weight. Schools received a weighted overall ranking score for each individual point mentioned above–100 being the highest score possible.\n\nIn the case of tie scoring, the average net price was the determining factor for which school received the higher rank–the lower the net price, the higher the ranking.\n\nAll data was gathered from College Scorecard and school websites.\n\nBest Christian Colleges & Universities for 2024\n\n1.
