        "text": "The Scotland Euro 2024 home kit is out – and it's an absolute belter.\n\nThe Scots are in the ascendancy with some superb results in the run-up to Euro 2024 – their second Euros in a row. So it was always going to be intriguing to see when Adidas dropped their international shirts: were the Tartan Army going to go classic and understated or something bolder for an exciting new generation?\n\nWhile many Euro 2024 kits hark to the past, we don't remember anything quite as cool as this for the Scots.\n\nThe Scotland Euro 2024 home kit is something new and exciting\n\n“An immense passion rings throughout the nation of Scotland, which has been injected into the home design via a modernized tartan graphic and dark blue base that speaks to its heritage – finished with captivating geometric shapes,” according to Adidas.\n\nUsually when brands say things like that, they're jumping through hoops to try and justify a design – but not this time. The tartan is obvious and this is a stunningly modern take on the idea.\n\nWhile the tartan kits of the 90s were something that Scotland should wear – they still make amazing retro tops – there's something immensely satisfying about seeing the pattern rendered for the 2020s.\n\nThe yellow and white are lovely touches – and there's a Scottish cross on the back on the neck, with the same geometric shapes. It's a just a wonderful look all round.\n\nWith Scotland entering a bold new dawn, this is exactly the look they needed. It's stunning: 10/10.\n\nBuy the shirt\n\nMore kit drops\n\nWith a Euros this year, Adidas have dropped their 2024 kits.\n\nBelgium's home kit is crimson, while their away shirt is bright blue. Germany have gradient patterns on both their home kit and away kit, while the Italy home jersey is a classic blue effort: the away shirt may not be as popular. Hungary have a vintage home shirt and away shirt to match, while Spain have may have their nicest home jersey for years. The jury is out on the yellow away shirt, however."
