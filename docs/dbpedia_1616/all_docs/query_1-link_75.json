So much for the anticipated effect of the new tariff, however, is an attempt to increase the price of wools tariff in enabling home wool growers to realize a higher price about twenty-five per cent. It is unncessary to inquire what for their clips. Nor has the tariff been successful in making would be the effect of such a rise in raw material, for it is capa¬ ble of demonstration that no such advance can really be per¬ imported wools dearer.

The most notable feature of the business of the month has been the development of mercantile circles. a vague feeling of apprehension in It would be difficult to account for this phase of affairs upon any definite grounds. Perhaps it may be traceable chiefly to a disappointment which has cer¬ tainly been experienced among merchants in the interior as to the character of the fall business. The purchases of the Western jobbers during the early part of the season were quite liberal, based upon an expectation of a good demand resulting from a plentiful harvest. They now report that new the demand from the retail dealers is limited ; and that, owing to the high prices at which they have to offer mer¬ chandise, they find it impossible to do an average amount of business. At the same time, there are complaints of diffi¬ culty in making collections, the result of which has appeared in the interior jobbers having to request renewals of their maturing notes. The obvious explanation of these symptoms is that the high prices of goods are at last compelling a sharp curtailment of consumption. This phase of business has not been unanticipated among .merchants and manufacturers. On the contrary, its appearance has been looked for with anxiety, as the period at which the inevitable test of the soundness of the present condition of affairs must be applied. They have taken the very rational view7 that so long as con¬ sumers would take the ordinary amount of goods at the cur¬ rent prices there could be no material change in values; but have also foreseen that, so soon as the community found it necessary to economise consumption, it would be impossible, with the current large production, to sustain 'he present high rate of values. It, therefore, is not surprising that these signs of the times should produce a certain degree of anxiety among our city merchants. The uneasiness suggested from these causes has been heightened by the failure of a large manufacturing firm at Cohoes, involving the suspension of a well known commis¬ sion house in this city, and by the suspension of twro firms en£age<I in woolen manufacturing in New England, Owing to these circumstances October closed with a feeling of 3,074,106 Government Bonds sold “ Notes “ State and City Bonds “ Railroad and other Bonds sold $10,282,300 2,703,250 2,792,300 1,234,700 . Total Bonds and Notes sold The $17,012,550 of the gold market has been comparatively steady. The importers and professional operators appear to have discovered the folly of keeping the market constantly oversold, thereby producing a chronic scarcity of gold, sus¬ taining the premium, and playing into the hands of strong combinations for forcing up the price; and there has conse¬ quently been a marked falling off in the amount of “ short” transactions, while the rate of interest on borrowed coin has been nominal. The anticipation of the disbursement, of about $24,000,000 of gold upon the November coupons has had much less effect upon the premium than might have been expected, the price at the close of the month being about the same as at the opening. This circumstance ap¬ pears to be due chiefly to the unsettled condition of home politics and to the new diplomatic aspects suggested by the reported adjustment of the Mexican question. The highest price touched during the month was 153£, and the lowest 145t}. We annex the daily quotations for the month: course t COURSE OF GOLD Openi’g Highs1 t. Lowest. Closing. Date.

Although prices here are now at a comparatively high point, the imports of foreign wheat into the United Kingdom are very limited. Our chief supplies are from the Baltic, the proportion being much greater from Russian than from Prussian ports. The quality of Russian wheat has of recent years considerably improved. The flour it produces is not fine as re¬ gards colour, but there is in it great intrinsic strength, and it forms an excellent commodity for mixing with flour produced from a milder During the last few weeks we have been receiving quantities from Moscow via St. Petersburg.

The Bank Directors have m&de no change in their rates of discount, and the minimum quotation remains at 4-£ per cent. The Bank, however, is not doing much business, the rates in the open market being one-half per cent, beneath those of the Bank of England. The mercantile demand for accommodation is much restricted, owing to the contraction in the volume of, and cautious feeliDg dis¬ played in trade. The supply .of capital seeking employment in the discount market has increased owing to the payment of the dividends, and the bankers have now larger balances in hand than they can profit¬ ably employ. The rates, therefore, tend downwards; but the condition of the wheat and cotton markets serve to check any rapid fall, and pro¬ duce a cautious feeling amongst the Directors of the Bank. lor these reasons, and since the demand for bills on India has considerably in¬ creased, whilst small shipments of silver have already been made* The money doubts are now entertaiued, in some quarters, whether a four per cent* be anticipated.

The following are the quotations at the lead* shipment of important quantities of wheat from the ports of Trieste, in ing cities: the Adriatic, and from Odessa, Tagaurog, and the Danube. Pank Bank Open the recent statements of the great rate may - - Open The wheat and the tendency of prices must be upwards. As the week closes, a strong upward movement is perceptible. The imports for the week are moderate ; but are chiefly, as stated above, from the Baltic. In France, the wheat trade continues firm, and a further advance has taken place in the quotations. The French are said to be making large purchases at Odessa in the Black Sea, but under the present regulations in France, foreign purchases of wheat do not indicate a deficient crop. In Paris, bread cannot be sold by the bakers above a certain price; this regulation is necessary to appease the ouvriers, and prevent dis¬ turbance in the capital, which would be certain to lead to riots in other parts of the Empire. During the period of dear flour, the bakers are compensated by the State for any loss they may sustain, and it is very likely that the Imperial Government therefore made considerable pur¬ chases of foreign wheat in order to have plenty in the country, and especially at the capital. Indeed, I am assured, that the French Gov¬ ernment has ordered the purchase of wheat at the Black Sea. With regard to our own crop. I am informed that thd^deficiency is not very considerable, and I have conversed with farmers who have ad¬ mitted that they have obtained as much as 6| quarters to the acre, which is an excellent crop. Others admit 4^ quarters to the acre, which i« a fair average yield. But even assuming that our crop is an average one, which is not the case, what is likely to be the course of our wheat appearance, noarket rate, trade, however, will certainly continue to present a firm during the present year f Undoubtedly one of great firmoei j, $ c. market. $ c. 3 At Paris Vienna Berlin market. $ c. rate, $ c. 5 Turin Brussels'. 6 — . 2X 3 4. “ 5% adv— 4 4# 5# 5% Frinkfoit Amsterdam Madrid 9 Hamburg - bt.
