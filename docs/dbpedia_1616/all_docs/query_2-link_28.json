Recent research has shown that mutational signatures reflective of the history of a cancer can be detected in a cancer genome.

        "text": "Experimental mutagenesis in C. elegans\n\nTo determine how the interplay between mutagenic processes and DNA repair status impacts mutational spectra, we used 54 C. elegans strains, including wild-type and 53 DNA repair and DNA damage sensing mutants (Fig. 1a). These cover all major DNA repair pathways including direct damage reversal (DR), base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), MMR, DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR), translesion synthesis (TLS), DNA crosslink repair (CLR), and DNA damage sensing checkpoints (DS)10,11,12,13,14 (see Supplementary Table 1 for a full list). To inflict different types of DNA damage we used 12 genotoxic agents encompassing UV-B, X- and γ-radiation; the alkylating agents ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS); AA and aflatoxin B1, which form bulky DNA adducts; hydroxyurea as a replication fork stalling agent; and cisplatin, mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard) and mitomycin C (which was only used in the wild-type) known to form DNA intra- and inter-strand crosslinks.\n\nTo investigate the level of mutagenesis for each genotype in the absence of exogenous mutagens, we clonally propagated wild-type and DNA repair defective C. elegans lines over 5–40 generations in mutation accumulation experiments (Methods, Fig. 1a)9,15. In addition, to measure the effects of genotoxic agents, nematodes were exposed to mutagenize germ cells and mutational spectra were analysed by sequencing clonally derived progeny15. Self-fertilising propagation through single zygotes provides clonally amplified DNA for subsequent whole-genome sequencing (Fig. 1a). Experiments were typically performed in triplicates, with dose escalation for genotoxin treatments.\n\nOverall, we analysed a total of 2717 C. elegans genomes comprising 477 samples from mutation accumulation experiments, 234 samples from genotoxin-treated DNA repair proficient wild-type lines and 2006 samples from interaction experiments combining genotoxin treatment with DNA repair deficiency. The sample set harboured a total of 162,820 acquired mutations (average of ~60 mutations per sample) comprising 135,348 SNVs, 937 MNVs, 24,308 indels and 2,227 SVs. Attribution of observed mutations to each genotoxin, to distinct DNA repair deficiencies, and to their combined action was done using a negative binomial regression analysis leveraging the explicit knowledge of genotoxin dose, genotype, and the number of generations across all samples to obtain absolute mutation rates and signatures, measured in units of mutations/generation/dose (Methods).\n\nMutation accumulation under DNA repair deficiencies\n\nComparing mutations in genomes of the first and final generations for the 477 mutation accumulation samples, we observed a generally low rate of mutagenesis in the range of 0.8–2 mutations per generation similar to previous reports on 17 DNA repair deficient C. elegans strains15,16 (Supplementary Note 1). Notable exceptions were lines carrying knockouts of genes affecting MMR, DSBR and TLS (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Note 1). MMR deficient mlh-1 knockouts manifested in high base substitution rates combined with a pattern of 1 bp insertions and deletions at homopolymer repeats, similar to reports in human cancers (cosine similarity c = 0.85)9,17. DSBR deficient strains carrying a deletion in brc-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the BRCA1 tumour suppressor, exhibited a uniform base substitution spectrum and increased rate of small deletions and tandem duplications (Fig. 1c), features also observed in BRCA1 defective cancer genomes (c = 0.69 relative to SBS3)18. TLS polymerase knockouts of polh-1 and rev-3 yielded a mutational spectrum dominated by 50–400 bp deletions. We postulate that these deletions arise when replication over damaged bases is stalled or fails19,20,21 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Note 1). Furthermore, him-6 mutants, defective for the C. elegans orthologue of the BLM (Bloom syndrome) helicase, and smc-6 mutants, defective for the Smc5/6 cohesin-like complex, showed an increased incidence of SVs (Fig. 1c). Experimentally derived mutational signatures for all 54 genetic backgrounds are summarised in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Data 2. These findings are broadly consistent with data from human cancers, which exhibit hypermutation for deficiency of MMR, POLE exonuclease domain, and DSBR1, but barely for extremely common monoallelic or rarely occurring biallelic mutations in other DNA repair genes (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Data 3).\n\nMutagenesis under genotoxic exposures\n\nGenotoxins tended to have a stronger influence on the mutational spectrum compared to DNA repair deficient backgrounds (Fig. 1b; see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2 for a full list of spectra). The methylating agents MMS and DMS, produced very similar mutation spectra with high numbers of T > A and T > C substitutions (Fig. 1b, d).\n\nSamples treated with the ethylating agent EMS were characterised by C > T mutations, somewhat similar to the mutational signature SBS11 observed in cancer genomes, which has been attributed to exposure to the alkylating agent temozolomide (cosine similarity c = 0.91)2. However, both signatures differ from the EMS spectrum reported in human iPS cells22 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), likely due to differential repair capacity.\n\nBulky adducts created by AA and aflatoxin B1 exposure resulted in mutational spectra with typical T > A and C > A mutations, respectively, similar to those observed in exposed human cancers and cell lines (c = 0.95 and c = 0.92, respectively)4,23. UV-B radiation induced characteristic C > T transitions in a YpCpH context (Y = C/T; H = A/C/T), similar to SBS7a/b (c = 0.95 for C > T alone), but with an unexpected rate of T > A transversions in a WpTpA context (W = A/T; c = 0.69 for all variants), which might be caused by the higher proportion of 6-4 photoproducts induced by UV-B compared to sunlight and possibly lower repair efficiency of these lesions in C. elegans24. Ionizing radiation (X- and ɣ-rays) caused single and multi-nucleotide substitutions, but also deletions and SVs, in agreement with the spectra of radiation-induced secondary malignancies25 (c = 0.89 for substitution spectra). Lastly, cisplatin exposure induced C > A transversions in a CpCpC and CpCpG context, deletions, and SVs in agreement with previous studies (Fig. 1b, d)15,22,26,27. Interestingly, the overall cisplatin-induced mutation spectrum seems strongly organism-specific (Supplementary Methods).\n\nThe general resemblance of genotoxin-derived mutational signatures across organisms (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Methods) reflects the high level of conservation of DNA repair pathways among eukaryotes. Interestingly, discrepancies observed between species or different cell lines derived from the same species may provide insights into differences in genotoxin metabolism or DNA repair capacity.\n\nSignatures of concomitant DNA damage and repair deficiency\n\nThe experimentally controlled exposure time and doses enabled us to quantify how strongly a DNA repair deficiency altered mutational effects of a genotoxin on a genome-wide scale. We considered a DNA repair deficiency and a genotoxin as interacting if the mutation rate of all or a type of mutations (e.g. substitutions, indels or SVs) changed relative to the expectation that the observed mutations can be expressed as the sum of the genotoxin spectrum in wild-type and the DNA repair deficiency spectrum without genotoxin exposure (Methods).\n\nGenotoxin-repair deficiency interactions were very common: In total, 88/196 (41%, at false-discovery rate (FDR) < 5%) of the combinations we tested displayed an interaction between DNA repair status and genotoxin treatment involving 9/11 genotoxins and 32/53 genotypes (Fig. 2, for a comprehensive list of effects see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Data 4). Most frequently interactions increased the numbers of mutations obtained for a given dose of mutagen, with the strongest increase of 50x observed in polk-1 mutants under exposure to alkylating agents (Fig. 2a). Conversely, knockouts of TLS polymerases REV-3 and to a lower extent POLH-1 reduced the rate of point mutations for a range of genotoxins while showing increased numbers of indels and/or SVs (Fig. 2a). While some interactions left the mutational spectrum largely unchanged, such as MMS-exposure of xpc-1 mutants, others, such as MMS- or DMS-exposure of polk-1 mutants, had a profound impact on mutational spectra, indicating that this specific DNA repair pathway only mends a subset of lesions introduced by the genotoxin (Fig. 2b).\n\nOverall, we estimate that of the 141,004 mutations observed in genotoxin exposure experiments in DNA repair deficient strains, 26% were attributed to the endogenous mutagenicity of DNA repair deficiency independent of genotoxic exposure and 54% were attributed to genotoxic exposures independent of the genetic background. In addition, 23% of mutations arose due to positive interactions between mutagen exposure and DNA repair deficiency leading to increased mutagenicity (Fig. 2c). Finally, we found that 3% of mutations were prevented by negative interactions between genotoxins and DNA repair deficiency leading to reduced mutagenesis.\n\nApplying a similar approach to a range of DNA repair deficient and proficient cancers with suspected genotoxic exposures, we were able to characterise several cases of DNA damage-repair interactions leading to increased mutagenesis and/or altered signatures, such as POLEEXO and MMR, tissue-specific changes of the MMR deficiency signature, UV damage and NER, or APOBEC-induced mutagenesis and TLS (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 4). However, we found that interactions were hard to detect due to the unknown history of exposure and DNA repair defects, and detectable effects were typically only moderate.\n\nLesion-specific repair and mutagenicity of DNA alkylation\n\nMany genotoxins, such as the alkylating agent MMS, inflict DNA damage on different nucleotides and residues thereof (Fig. 3a). MMS induces several different base methylations, including non-mutagenic N7-meG, as well as mutagenic N3-meA and O6-meG28, which, taken together, produced a mutation rate of approximately 230 mutations/mM/generation in C. elegans wild-type (Fig. 3a). However, the underlying mutagenic and repair mechanisms for these DNA adducts are very different: O6-meG is subject to direct reversal by alkyl-guanine DNA alkyltransferases and tends to pair with thymine29, whereas N3-meA can be mended by BER or NER30,31. If unrepaired, N3-meA requires TLS polymerases for lesion bypass during replication, which can be error-free or result in the misincorporation of A or C opposite N3-meA32.\n\nIndeed, our analysis showed diverse changes in the MMS-induced signature across DNA repair deficient backgrounds. In the absence of NER, the mutation rate of adenine was elevated 1.5× in xpc-1 mutants and 3× in xpf-1 and xpa-1 mutants without a change in the mutational signature (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Fig. 4a), indicating that an increased proportion of N3-meA underwent error-prone TLS. These fold changes (FCs) correspond to about 30% and 60% of mutations being prevented by error-free XPC-1 and XPF-1/XPA-1 repair activity, respectively (Fig. 3c). A similar trend of 1.5–3-fold increase in T > M mutations was observed for EMS exposure under NER deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In contrast to MMS, EMS mostly induces O6-etG lesions with a small amount of N3-etA29. Consistent with this, we estimate that NER prevents about 25–40% of mutations upon EMS exposure (Supplementary Fig. 4c).\n\nDeficiency of polymerase κ increased the overall mutation rate upon MMS treatment 17× with approximately 3,800 mutations/mM/generation (Fig. 3b). In line with the role of TLS in bypassing N3-meA during replication, polymerase κ deficiency yielded an approximately 10–100× higher rate of T > M (M = A/C) mutations, especially in TpTpN and CpTpN contexts (Fig. 3b). This increase also coincided with a distinct change in the mutational spectrum marked by a highly increased proportion of T > A transversions in a TpTpT context (Fig. 3b). These figures indicate that Pol κ dependent TLS is error-free and prevents 90–99% of DNA adducts caused by MMS exposure from becoming mutagenic (Fig. 3c). A similar increase of T > M substitutions (at the rate of 10×) was observed in Pol κ deficient mutants upon treatment with EMS, corresponding to 50% of EMS-induced mutations being prevented by POLK-1 mediated error-free TLS (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). We postulate that in the absence of Pol κ, the bypass of alkylated adenines has to be achieved by other, error-prone TLS polymerases, leading to increased T > M mutagenesis, particularly in a TpTpT context.\n\nOne of the candidates for this error-prone TLS is rev-3, which encodes the catalytic subunit of TLS Pol ζ. In contrast to polk-1 TLS deficiency where the mutation rate was increased, the knockout of rev-3/Pol ζ partially suppressed MMS-induced base substitutions but increased the number of small deletions (Fig. 3b), indicating that Pol ζ is an essential component for the bypass of alkylated bases. We estimated that about 60% of MMS-induced mutations in wild-type result from error-prone repair synthesis conferred by Pol ζ (Fig. 3c).\n\nCombining MMS exposure with alkyl-transferase agt-1 deficiency also led to a striking change in the MMS signature, increasing the C > T mutation rate from about 15 mutations/mM in the wild-type to over 200 in the mutant, while leaving the rate of T > M mutations unchanged (Fig. 3b). This demonstrates that AGT-1 specifically reverses most O6-methylguanine adducts in an error free manner, thus acting as the functional C. elegans ortholog of the human O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase MGMT. Thus, the repair activity of AGT-1 prevents 50% of mutations which would otherwise be induced by MMS (Fig. 3c). A similar, but weaker effect of agt-1 deficiency was observed upon exposure to the ethylating agent EMS, leading to a 1.5-fold increase in C > T transitions, indicating that AGT-1 is also involved in, but less efficient at, removing ethyl groups, the latter result being consistent with reports measuring single locus reversion rates in E. coli33 (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).\n\nAn even stronger interaction, which has already been therapeutically exploited, occurs between the human agt-1 ortholog MGMT and temozolomide, a DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic, in temozolomide-treated glioblastomas (Fig. 3d)34. This is in good agreement with our experimental findings that the nature of mutation spectra detected upon EMS, DMS or MMS alkylation depends on the status of agt-1 (Fig. 2a).\n\nTLS causes the majority of substitutions\n\nThe contribution of certain low-fidelity TLS polymerases to genotoxin-induced mutagenesis is a wide-spread phenomenon35. Error-prone TLS is a key mechanism used to tolerate and bypass several types of DNA damage19,36, such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers which stall replicative polymerases. Removal of polymerase ζ was shown to decrease the total frequency of mutations in yeast, mouse and human cells37,38,39. In C. elegans, exposing wild-type to UV-B led to approximately 10 mutations per 100 J m−2, comprised mostly of C > T and T > C transitions (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Paradoxically, the overall UV-B mutation rate was reduced 1.5-fold in rev-3/pol ζ mutants, mostly through a reduction in base substitutions, which was in contrast to a 4-fold increase of deletions longer than 50 bp (Supplementary Fig. 5a). To protect the genome from such deletions, which are likely to be deleterious, it is believed that TLS bypasses UV lesions at the cost of a higher base substitution rate40. Quantifying the amount of mutations resulting from the activity of TLS polymerases REV-3/Pol ζ, POLH-1/Pol η and POLQ-1/Pol θ, we observed that 60–80% of single base substitutions induced not only by UV, but also by aflatoxin B1, AA, DMS and MMS could be assigned to the activity of these polymerases (Fig. 4a, b). In contrast, REV-3/Pol ζ and POLH-1/Pol η also prevented 40–80% of indels and SVs following alkylating agents, UV and IR exposure (Fig. 4a). In contrast to previous reports36,41,42, only very small genomic interaction effects were observed in TLS mutants and cisplatin exposure, which was comparably low in this screen due to high lethality.\n\nAn inverse phenomenon is observed upon treating polq-1/Pol θ deficient mutants with AA. Indels, in particular deletions between 50 and 400 bp in length, induced by AA in wild-type were nearly absent in polq-1 deficient mutants (Fig. 4b). Hence, we estimate that POLQ-1/Pol θ causes more than half of AA-induced indels and SVs (Fig. 4a, b). Breakpoint analysis of AA-induced deletions derived from all POLQ-1/Pol θ proficient lines demonstrated an excess of single base matches, indicative of C. elegans POLQ-1/Pol θ mediated end-joining19,43 (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Methods). We speculate that in the absence of POLQ-1/Pol θ, replication-associated DSBs generated by persistent aristolactam adducts are likely to be repaired by HR, a slower but less error-prone pathway44.\n\nA noteworthy example illustrating the role of TLS polymerases in cancer is conferred by APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) and error-prone, TLS-driven BER. APOBEC deaminates single-stranded cytosine to uracil, which pairs with adenine during replication, leading to C > T mutations. Uracil is thought to be removed by Uracil DNA Glycosylase UNG; subsequent synthesis by error-prone TLS REV1 leads to C > G mutations45,46. Indeed, a lack of C > G mutations has been observed in a cancer cell line with UNG silencing47. We found a relatively weak contribution of REV1 and UNG mutation or silencing to APOBEC mutagenesis in human cancers, which nevertheless confirms the expected trend: on average, samples defective for REV1 or UNG display an 8% decrease in C > G mutations (Fig. 4c). However, REV1 and UNG status at diagnosis only explains a small fraction of APOBEC mutations with low rates of C > G transversion, suggesting that other processes contribute to these variants. Alternatively, the underlying signature change may not be detectable due to REV1/UNG mutation occurring late in cancer development compared to APOBEC overactivation.\n\nNER mends most genotoxic lesions\n\nNER acts by excising a large variety of damaged bases, preventing up to 90% of mutations induced by different genotoxins, particularly those which induce damage to adenine or thymine (Fig. 5a). After AA exposure, C. elegans xpf-1 mutants showed a 5-fold increase in mutation rate with a 20-fold increase in the number of 50–400 bp deletions, confirming that NER is crucial for the repair of bulky DNA adducts (Fig. 5b). Aristolactam adducts occur on adenine48, and the failure to excise the modified base would lead to T > A changes or deletions. In contrast to previous reports on the lack of recognition of the aristolactam adducts by global genome NER (GG-NER)49, xpc-1 mutants (which are defective for GG-NER) showed increased numbers of mutations upon AA exposure, especially deletions of 50–400 bps, similar to xpf-1 mutants which are deficient in both GG-NER and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly, only xpf-1 (which is defective for both TC-NER and GG-NER) but not xpc-1 deficiency led to an increase in the number of C > A mutations, suggesting that TC-NER maybe be more crucial to the repair of dG aristolactam adducts, which tend to be mispaired with adenine during Pol η mediated TLS50.\n\nIn contrast to the previous examples in which DNA repair deficiencies changed the mutational spectra induced by mutagens, knockouts of the NER genes xpf-1 and xpc-1 did not alter mutation spectra but uniformly increased the rate of UV-B induced mutagenesis by a factor of 20 and 32, respectively (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 6b). This uniform increase indicates that NER is involved in repairing the majority of mutagenic UV-B DNA damage including both single- and multi-nucleotide lesions. Interestingly, xpf-1 and xpa-1 knockouts also uniformly increased the mutation burden resulting from EMS and MMS alkylation by a factor of 2, indicating that NER also contributes to error-free repair of alkylation damage (Supplementary Fig. 4). Further cases of genotoxin signatures being changed in NER mutants were observed following ionizing radiation and cisplatin exposure (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 6c). In IR treated samples, xpa-1 deficiency led to a 10-fold increase in C > T changes as well as MNVs. Upon cisplatin exposure, NER defects increased the amount of C > A and T > A mutations, as well as dinucleotide substitutions likely introduced during the bypass of cisplatin-induced crosslinks50,51. In addition, in the fan-1 mutant, defective for a conserved nuclease involved in ICL repair, cisplatin exposure led to a dramatic elevation of 50–400 base deletions without affecting base substitutions (Supplementary Fig. 6c).\n\nIn humans, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a hereditary syndrome characterised by an extreme sensitivity to UV exposure and high risk of skin and brain cancers during childhood, is often associated with biallelic inactivation of NER52. Investigating the changes in the UV signature between 8 adult skin tumours and 5 tumours from XPC defective XP patients53, we observed a relatively uniform 30-fold change in mutation rate per year in XP patients across base substitution types in line with findings in C. elegans (Fig. 5d). Moreover, there was a mild shift in certain base contexts, with nearly 3 times more mutations acquired in NpCpT, but also TpCpD context (D = A/G/T). XPC deficiency inactivates GG-NER, which is possibly compensated by transcription coupled NER53. It is thus possible that this shift in mutation spectrum reflects a sequence specificity of GG-NER repair efficiency.\n\nNotably no effects were observed for NER variants in sporadic lung and skin cancers, although one might expect NER involvement in repairing bulky DNA adducts generated from tobacco smoke and UV light (Supplementary Fig. 3e–g). Of note ERCC2/XPD NER mutations are also relevant in urothelial cancers, where they have been reported to produce a mild increase in the number of mutations attributed to COSMIC signature 554.\n\nExperimental design\n\nC. elegans strains backcrossed 6× against the wild-type reference TG181315 and mutagen doses are described in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nMutation accumulation experiments\n\nFor mutation accumulation experiments 5–10 single L4 stage hermaphrodites (F1s) were randomly chosen from wild-type as well as each mutant (P0, 6× backcrossed against wild-type) and transferred to individual 1× NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Every 3–4 days, 1 single L4 hermaphrodite was randomly chosen among the progeny per plate and propagated further, a process repeated until the indicated generation (F5, F20 and F40). The final generation was then starved and used for DNA isolation and glycerol stocks. For each genotype, the P0 or F1 generation plate and at least three plates of the final generation lines were chunked to 9 cm 3× NGM plates and allowed to reach starvation. Worms were then washed off plates, washed 3× in M9 medium, pelleted and frozen in liquid nitrogen, before DNA extraction (below).\n\nGenotoxin treatment\n\nGravid adult worm populations were washed off 1× NGM plates with M9 medium, pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 400 × g, and washed with M9 to remove bacteria. Pelleted worms were then bleached and the released eggs resuspended and washed 3 times in M9 medium. Eggs were left in M9 for 24 h under gentle shaking to permit hatching and synchronisation at early L1 stage and were then transferred to OP50-seeded NGM plates. Once the population reached the young adult stage, 20 worms were picked for each genotype and genotoxin dose and incubated for 16 h at 20 °C in OP50-containing M9 medium with the desired concentration of EMS, DMS, MMS, aflatoxin B1 and AA. After the incubation, worms were centrifuged, transferred to OP50-seeded NGM plates and allowed to recover for 24 h. For cisplatin, mechlorethamine, and mitomycin C treatment 15–20 L4s were picked per genotype and genotoxin dose and were transferred as 24 h post L4 stage adults into OP50-containing M9 medium containing the indicated genotoxin concentrations. Genotoxins were diluted from freshly prepared stock solutions. Incubation was performed for 16 h at 20 °C under the hood in a shaking incubator. Worms were then transferred and left to recover for 24 h on OP50-seeded NGM plates. For X-ray exposure 15–20 L4 larvae were picked into M9 medium per genotype and dose. Irradiation was performed with the indicated radiation doses using a low energy photon radiosurgery system X-ray source. Worms were then transferred and allowed to recover for 24 h on OP50-seeded NGM plates. For γ-ray exposure 15–20 L4 larvae were picked onto OP50-containing NGM plates per genotype and dose. Worms were irradiated with the indicated radiation doses using a 137Cs source (2.14 Gy min−1, IBL 437C, CIS Bio International) and allowed to recover for 24 h. For UV treatment, early L1s, obtained after bleaching and synchronisation, were transferred to OP50-seeded NGM plates and irradiated at the indicated UV dose, in triplicate. Once grown to the young adult stage, 3 × 3 worms per genotype and dose were transferred to a fresh plate for progeny viability testing and propagation. For HU-treatments ~100 L1s were placed onto HU-containing OP50-seeded NGM plates and allowed to grow for 57 h. Worms were then transferred to new plates without HU and allowed to recover for 15 h.\n\nProgeny viability scoring and F1 isolation\n\nFollowing genotoxin treatment and recovery 3× three worms/genotype and dose were transferred to new plates and allowed to lay eggs for 6 h. Adults were then removed. To determine progeny viability, the number of eggs laid as well as the number of unhatched eggs after 24 h was counted. The percentage of hatched eggs compared to the total number of eggs laid was calculated for each plate, and the mean and SD of each technical triplicate calculated. A minimum of three independent experiments (biological triplicate) was performed for each genotoxin. To obtain F1 lines for DNA sequencing, two F1 L4 larvae were picked from each of the three plates for each genotype and dose, transferred individually to a fresh plate and allowed to proliferate. These duplicates enhanced the probability to obtain one fertile line from each plate especially from animals treated with high genotoxin doses. From each duplicate, one line was selected for expansion (see MA experiment above), genomic DNA extraction and sequencing. The zygotes which lead to the F1 generation provide a single cell bottleneck where mutations of exposed male and female germ cells are fixed before being clonally amplified during C. elegans development and passed on to the next generation in a mendelian ratio.\n\nDNA extraction\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from frozen samples using ChargeSwitch® gDNA Mini Tissue Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturers instructions albeit with Proteinase K incubation O/N.\n\nData acquisition\n\nC. elegans genomic DNA was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and X10 short read sequencing platforms at 100 bp paired-end reads with a mean coverage of 50×. Raw sequencing reads were aligned to the C. elegans reference genome (WBcel235/ce11 build) using BWA algorithm59. TCGA human cancer data was taken from NCI GDC (https://gdc.cancer.gov60), and respective studies34,61,62,63,64,65,66.\n\nMutation calling, filtering, and classification\n\nC. elegans aligned sequence reads were processed through the Sanger Cancer IT pipeline using CaVEMan for SNV calling67, Pindel for indel calling68, and DELLY69 for SV identification. Filtering of samples was performed using the same criteria as in ref. 9. Base substitutions were called using CAVEMAN67 with the following filtering criteria:\n\n1.\n\nCoverage of the variant site in both the sample of interest (test sample) and reference (untreated F0 wild-type sample) did not exceed 150 reads or recede below 15 reads.\n\n2.\n\nNo reads reported the variant in the reference sample.\n\n3.\n\nAt least 20% of reads and at least 5 reads reporting the variants in test sample.\n\n4.\n\nAt least one read in the test sample reporting the variant in each read direction.\n\n5.\n\nNo indel was called at the same position (relevant for homopolymer junctions).\n\nAll variants were filtered against the normal panel of six untreated F1 wild-type samples to remove recurrent technical errors. Propagated samples (of generation > F1) of the same genotype from mutation accumulation experiments were not compared to each other to avoid overfiltering of related samples (e.g. when F40 lines were derived from the same F20 lines sequenced in the same study). Multiple substitutions which were found at adjacent sites in the same sample were classified as dinucleotide or MNVs, if their variant allele frequencies were similar (difference less than 5%). Overall, base substitutions were classified into 96 SNV classes (6 base substitution types per 16 trinucleotide contexts) and 2 MNV classes (dinucleotide variants and variants longer than 2 bp).\n\nSmall size insertions and deletions (1–400 bp) were called using PINDEL68 with the following filter criteria:\n\n1.\n\nCoverage of the variant site in both the sample of interest and reference did not exceed 150 reads or recede below 10 reads.\n\n2.\n\nNo more than 1 read reporting the variant in the reference sample.\n\n3.\n\nMore than 20% of reads and at least 5 reads reporting the variants in test sample.\n\n4.\n\nAt least one read in test sample reporting the variant in each direction.\n\n5.\n\nIf the variant falls into a repetitive region, the region should not exceed 18 repeats.\n\nAll variants were filtered against the normal panel of six wild-type samples; samples of the same genotype and generation higher than one were not compared to each other to avoid overfiltering of related samples. Indels were classified into 14 classes based on indel type (deletions, insertions, and complex indels—named deletions-insertions (DI)), size (1, 2–5, 5–50 and 50–400 bp), and presence in repetitive or non-repetitive sequence contexts.\n\nSVs were called using DELLY69 with the following filters:\n\n1.\n\nEach variant was supported by more than ten high-quality reads in test sample and no reads were present in the reference sample.\n\n2.\n\nVariant passed the default DELLY quality filter (paired-end support <5 for translocations or <3 for other SVs, or mapping quality <20).\n\n3.\n\nVariants in telomeric regions were removed.\n\n4.\n\nDuplicated SVs across unrelated samples were removed. Samples of the same genotype and generation higher than 1 were not compared to each other to avoid overfiltering of related samples.\n\nThe resulting sets of breakpoints for each sample were further classified in line with ref. 70 using clustering by proximity and simplified into a set of seven SVs: tandem duplications, deletions, inversions, intrachromosomal translocations, interchromosomal events, foldbacks (change of the orientation of sequence without a second breakpoint in close proximity) and complex variants (not falling in any of the previously described categories). Stand-alone deletions and tandem duplications were additionally tested for reliability by comparing the ratios of the coverages between the test and control samples outside the variant breakpoints and between them, to ensure that there is a drop in coverage for a deletion and an increase for a duplication.\n\nHandling of variant calling results, filtering and classification were performed using R package VariantAnnotation-1.28.1071. Bam file statistics necessary to perform coverage comparison within and outside of deletions and tandem duplications was performed using samtools-0.1.1872. Mutation counts for all samples are listed in Supplementary Data 1. Data visualisation was performed using t-SNE73 based on the cosine distance of the 119-dimensional mutation spectra, averaged across replicates.\n\nExtraction of interaction effects from experimental data\n\nFor each sample i = 1, …, 2717 and mutation class j = 1, …, 119, we counted the respective number of mutations per sample Yij. Using matrix notation, the counts Y \\(\\in\\) \\({\\Bbb N}_0^{2717 \\times 119}\\) (where \\({\\Bbb N}_0\\) means the set of natural numbers and zero) were modelled by a negative binomial distribution\n\n$${\\mathbf{Y}}\\sim {\\mathrm{NB}}({\\mathbf{\\upmu}},\\, {\\varphi} = 100),$$\n\nwith scalar overdispersion parameter \\(\\varphi\\) = 100 selected based on the estimates of overdispersion in the dataset, and matrix-variate expectation \\({\\mathbf{\\upmu }} \\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 119}\\), where \\({\\Bbb R}_{ + 0} = {\\Bbb R}_{+} \\cup \\{ 0\\}\\).\n\nThe basic structure of the expectation is\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upmu }} = {\\mathbf{\\upmu }}_{\\mathrm{G}}\\left( {{\\mathbf{g}} + {\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}_{\\mathrm{I}}} \\right) + {\\mathbf{d}} {\\cdot} {{\\mathbf{\\upmu}}_{\\mathrm{M}}} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{\\upbeta}}_{I}},$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g ∙ μG \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 119}\\) describes the expected mutations just due to the sample’s genotype in the absence of a genotoxin after N \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_0^{2717 \\times 1}\\) generations. The vector g \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 1}\\) denotes the generation number in every sample, \\({\\mathrm{g}}_{\\mathrm{k}} = {\\mathrm{g}}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left( {{{N}}_{{k}}} \\right) = \\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N_k} {2^{1 - i} + \\frac{1}{4}\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N_k - 1} {\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_{j = 1}^i {2^{1 - j}} } }\\), k = 1, …, 2717, adjusted for the chances of fixation after Nk generations given the 25–50–25% probability of each mutation becoming homozygous, remaining heterozygous or being lost in each generation.\n\nThe matrix d ∙ μM \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 119}\\) denotes the expected mutation counts induced by mutagens at doses d \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 1}\\) in wild-type conditions. The terms αI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 1}\\) and βI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_ + ^{2717 \\times 119}\\) model how these terms interact (more details follow below). Here, the dot product ‘∙’ is element-wise and we use the convention that a dimension of length 1 is extended by replication to match the length of the corresponding dimension of other factors in the product.\n\nThe expected number of mutations induced by genotypes, μG, has the structure\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upmu }}_G = {\\mathbf{G}}\\, \\times {\\mathbf{S}}_{\\mathrm{{G}}},$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere G \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{2717 \\times 54}\\) is the binary indicator matrix for denoting which one of the 54 genotypes a given sample has (Gij = 1 if sample i has genotype j, otherwise Gij = 0). The matrix\n\nSG \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_ + ^{54 \\times 119}\\) denotes the mutation spectrum (i.e. signature) across the 119 mutation classes for each of the 54 genotypes in the absence of genotoxic exposures. To provide a more stable estimate for genotype signature, the prior distribution for SG is derived from SG* = SG | YMA, where YMA \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_0^{474 \\times 119}\\) is the matrix of counts coming from mutation accumulation samples only, and SG* has a log-normal prior distribution SG* ~logN(0, σG2) iid with a scalar variance σG2. Thus, we obtained priors for 51 genotypes. agt-1, exo-1 and rad-51 mutant strains did not have MA experiments, so they were assigned with SN2*, wild-type prior. The prior for SG was defined as SG ~ Г(shapeG, rateG), where the matrix parameters shapeG, rateG were fitted to the posterior draws for SG*.\n\nSimilarly, the expected mutations contributed by mutagens at their unit doses, μM, reads\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upmu }}_{\\mathrm{M}} = {\\mathbf{M}}\\, \\times {\\mathbf{S}}_{\\mathrm{M}},$$\n\n(3)\n\nwith M \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{2717 \\times 12}\\) being the indicator for the 12 mutagens (including Mitomycin C, which was eventually not used in the interaction experiments) and SM \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_ + ^{12 \\times 119}\\) being their signatures in wild-type, with per-column prior SM(j) ~logN(0, σMj2), j = 1, … 12, where the variances σM2 = (σM12, …, σM122) have prior distributions σMj2 ~ Г(1, 1) iid.\n\nThus, using the definitions (2) and (3), the matrix-variate expected number of mutations from (1) can be written as\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upmu }} = ({\\mathbf{g}} + {\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}_{\\mathrm{I}}) \\cdot \\left( {{\\mathbf{G}} \\, \\times {\\mathbf{S}}_{\\mathrm{{G}}}} \\right) + {\\mathbf{d}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{\\upbeta }}_I \\cdot \\left( {{\\mathbf{M}}\\, \\times {\\mathbf{S}}_{\\mathrm{{M}}}} \\right).$$\n\n(4)\n\nThe vector-variate interaction term αI measures how the mutations expected for genotypes G may uniformly increase under mutagen exposure and is taken to be linear with respect to the mutagen dose\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}_{\\mathrm{I}} = {\\mathbf{d}} \\cdot \\left( {{\\mathbf{I}}\\, \\times {\\mathbf{b}}_{\\mathrm{I}}} \\right) + {\\mathbf{\\upvarepsilon }},$$\n\n(5)\n\nThe symbol I \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{2717 \\times 196}\\) is the binary indicator matrix for each one of the 196 interactions tested in the screen multiplied by the interaction rate bI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_ + ^{196 \\times 1}\\), which measures how much the mutational signature of the genetic background increases upon genotoxic exposure with dose d. The interaction term is modelled to have a prior exponential distribution bI ~ Exp(1) iid.\n\nLastly, \\({\\mathbf{\\upvarepsilon }}\\) is a random offset to allow for a possible divergence of the genotypes between experiments, adding \\({\\mathbf{\\upvarepsilon }}\\) ∙ \\({\\mathbf{\\upmu }}\\)G mutations with the same spectrum as in the absence of a mutagen in a dosage-independent fashion. The random offset is modelled as \\({\\mathbf{\\upvarepsilon }}\\) = (J × aJ), where J\\(\\,\\, \\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{2717 \\times 208}\\) is an extended binary indicator matrix for each one the 196 interactions and 12 wild-type exposure experiments, with value aJ \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_{ + 0}^{2717 \\times 1}\\), aJ ~Exp(1) iid.\n\nIn addition to this scalar interaction, the wild-type spectrum of the mutagen SM may change by the factors βI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}_ + ^{2717 \\times 119}\\) measuring the FC of each mutation class which is expressed as\n\n$${\\mathbf{\\upbeta }}_{\\mathrm{I}} = {\\mathrm{exp}}({\\mathbf{I}} \\, \\times {\\mathbf{S}}_{\\mathrm{I}}),$$\n\n(6)\n\nwhere SI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}^{196 \\times 119}\\) is the FC for each mutation class in a given interaction.\n\nThe prior distributions for each of the 119 subclasses of mutations in SI are calculated in groups of 11 main mutation categories (6 types of SNVs, MNVs, 3 types of indels, SVs), since the numbers for individual mutation classes were sometimes very small. The prior was defined using SI \\(\\in {\\Bbb R}^{196 \\times 11}\\) from an analogous model as described above, but applied only to observed mutation counts summed into 11 main mutation categories Y \\(\\in {\\Bbb N}_0^{2717 \\times 11}\\). We used a Laplace prior S(j)I ~Laplace(0, σ2Ij), j = 1, …, 196, first to calculate SI|Y. The posterior expected value SI* = E[SI|Y] was chosen as the prior expectation for the 119-dimensional mutation effects SI, SI(j) ~ Laplace(SI* × C, σIj2), j = 1, …, 196, where C is the matrix spreading mutation category value across the corresponding individual mutation classes, and the variances σI2 = (σI12, …, σI1962) and σI2 = (σI12, …, σI1962) were assumed to come from \\(\\Gamma \\left( {1,1} \\right)\\) iid.\n\nBayesian estimates of the parameters SG, SM, SI, aJ, bI and hyperparameters σI2, σM2 were calculated via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling using the ‘greta’ R package (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=greta) (Supplementary Methods). We used 2000 steps for warmup and 5000 steps over 4 chains to ensure convergence. Mean estimates along with their 95% credible intervals may be found in Supplementary Data 2 and 3.\n\nCombined genotype-mutagen interactions were tested for effect in two settings: altering the total number of base substitutions, and changing the distribution of mutations. The FC in the number of single base substitutions was calculated as predicted with interactions versus the one predicted without interactions using 2000 out of 10,000 draws across 4 chains for all 196 interactions. The change in spectrum was quantified by calculating the cosine distance between the expected profiles with and without interactions, and those with distance higher than 0.2 were considered different. As all of the interactions which showed a change in signature appearance also came up in burden analysis, we only applied hypothesis testing (by testing the \\(\\chi\\)2-statistic of the squared z-score of log(E[FCs]), s = 1, …, 196), and corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR control procedure.\n\nBatch effect control for EMS exposure\n\nEMS exposure was the only genotoxin for which we observed very different mutation counts across different experiments in wild-type. Respective samples were coming from 5 batches, which are stated in the ‘Comments’ section of the samples description table in Supplementary Table 1. In order to account for this effect, we introduced additional factor \\({\\mathbf{\\upxi }}\\), \\({\\mathbf{\\upxi }}\\) = {\\(\\xi\\)i}, i = 1, …, 4 which accounted for the log-difference in real dose applied to the samples in batches 2 to 5 compared to batch 1 which was considered as reference. The prior distribution for these adjustments was taken as \\(\\xi\\)i ~N(0, 0.5) iid. The dose for these samples was then calculated as d’ = d ∙ exp(batch × \\({\\mathbf{\\upxi }}\\)), where batch \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{2717 \\times 4}\\) is a binary matrix reflecting if a sample belongs to any of the batches 2–5. These adjustments were estimated along with the rest of the coefficients.\n\nEstimation of mutational contributions of DNA repair components\n\nSubsequent estimates of the fraction of mutations contributed or prevented by different DNA repair components upon genotoxin exposures were acquired as \\(\\left( {1 - \\frac{1}{x}} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%\\) for positive interactions and as \\(\\left( {1 - x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%\\) for negative interactions, where x is the FC in the mutation rate induced by the respective interaction compared to the exposure in wild-type.\n\nTCGA/PCAWG human cancer data analysis\n\nThe susceptibility of a DNA pathway to alteration was defined as having altered expression or high impact mutations in relevant genes (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Data 3). The interaction effect was then estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling74 for the following model for matrix of mutation counts in N samples with R mutation classes Y \\(\\in {\\Bbb N}_0^{R \\times N}\\)\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{Y}}\\sim {\\mathrm{NB}}({\\mathbf{\\upmu }},\\,\\varphi ),\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\upmu }} = {\\mathbf{S}}^{( - K)} \\times {\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}_{( - {\\mathrm{K}})} + ({\\mathbf{S}}^{({\\mathrm{K}})} \\times {\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}_{({\\mathrm{K}})}) \\cdot {\\mathbf{f}}_{\\mathrm{G}},\\\\ {\\mathbf{f}}_{\\mathrm{G}} = {\\mathrm{exp}}({\\mathbf{X}} \\times {\\mathbf{\\upbeta }}),\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}\\sim {\\mathrm{Unif}}\\left( {0,{\\mathrm{M}}} \\right)^{{\\mathrm{K}} \\times {\\mathrm{N}}},\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\upbeta }}\\sim {\\mathrm{N}}\\left( {0,\\,0.5} \\right)^{{\\mathrm{M}} \\times {\\mathrm{R}}},\\end{array}$$\n\nwhere \\({\\mathbf{\\upalpha }}\\) is the matrix of exposures (number of mutations assigned to each signature), S is a R × K matrix of K signatures (each column is a signature, and is normalised to sum to 1), and fG is a R × N matrix of interaction factors which alter the signature. It consists of X \\(\\in {\\Bbb Z}_2^{N \\times M}\\)—a binary matrix of labels, and β which is a M × R matrix of spectra of the interaction effects with a i.i.d. N(0, 0.5) prior. M is the maximal number of mutations per sample in the dataset. The overdispersion parameter \\(\\varphi\\) = 50 was chosen based on variability estimates across all cancer samples. For details on sample selection, analysis of expression, mutations and selective pressure across DNA repair genes, see Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Notes 3 and 4 and Supplementary Data 3 and 5.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article."
