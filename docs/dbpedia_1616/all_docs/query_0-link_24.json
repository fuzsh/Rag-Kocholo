        "text": "Former Southlake Carroll student Sam Watson qualified for the speed climbing quarterfinals Tuesday at the Paris Olympics in historic fashion.\n\nAlready the world recorder holder for the event, Watson qualified in an elimination heat against fellow American Zach Hammer with a time of 4.75 seconds — 0.04 seconds faster than his previous mark.\n\nWatson, who grew up in Southlake before moving to Salt Lake City in April, became one of the favorites to win gold in speed climbing after setting the world record with a time of 4.79 seconds at the IFSC Wujiang World Cup in China earlier this year.\n\nLeonardo Veddriq of Indonesia had equaled Watson’s previous mark earlier in the day in Le Bourget, France.\n\nSpeed climbing is a young person’s sport — “most people are mid to late 20s,” Watson said — and it’s a vertical race in which athletes compete side by side in a one-on-one bracket format and climb a 15-meter high wall with a 5-degree overhang while clipped into a rope hung from the top of the wall.\n\nRelated:Local speed climber Sam Watson wants to win gold and meet Victor Wembanyama at Olympics\n\nSport climbing made its Olympics debut in 2021 in Tokyo, where it was a single-medal event as the three disciplines — speed climbing, lead and bouldering — were combined into one competition. In Paris, speed climbing is its own Olympic event, and Watson is confident he can become the first person to go under 4.70 seconds.\n\n“My current practice personal best is 4.66, so sub 4.7 would be the goal,” he said.\n\nAside from breaking his world record and winning the gold medal, the 18-year-old said his other goal was to meet San Antonio Spurs superstar Victor Wembanyama, a 20-year-old generational talent who is playing for Team France.\n\n“I’m a big Spurs fan,” Watson said. “Manu Ginobili is my favorite athlete. Victor Wembanyama is my favorite current player. I got tickets to the group stage to watch France and America. I love Team USA, and I love my country, but the one exception is that I will be rooting for Team France in basketball.”\n\nSport climbing has become popular over the last 20 years, and there are more than 25 million climbers in 150 countries all over the world, according to Olympics.com. Watson would like it to become an NCAA sport — and even a UIL sport in Texas — to help it grow in the United States.\n\nRelated:Beyond Simone Biles and Sha’Carri Richardson, meet all the Texas Olympians headed to Paris\n\nThe sport has taken Watson all over the world, as he won World Cup titles in Scotland (2022) and France (2024) and the 2023 Pan American Games in Chile. He set a then-U.S. record at a 2023 World Cup event in Korea and earned a silver medal at the 2022 IFSC Climbing World Youth Championships in Russia.\n\nThat globetrotting is one reason he became proficient in Bahasa — the official language of Indonesia — and also learned French, German and Spanish.\n\n“I like the ability to connect with people, and it has a positive effect on breaking down the often perceived American stereotype that we are less open to learning other languages and we want them to come to us,” Watson said. “It’s a good gesture for me to be an ambassador for my country.”\n\nWatson grew up training indoors at the Movement gyms in Grapevine and Plano and set his world record indoors. But he will be competing outdoors at the Olympics, which will present a challenge, even for a Texan accustomed to hot weather.\n\n“It will be over 100 degrees when I am competing,” he said.\n\nThe Southlake native enjoys playing chess and Mario Kart, but climbing as a full-time job doesn’t leave a lot of time for hobbies. Watson also helps his shoe sponsor with product design and does marketing work for other companies.\n\nIn the fall, he’ll begin college at Utah, where he’ll study operational supply chain management with the hope of someday working internationally. But he said he hopes to have a long career in climbing.\n\n“I think I can do it for another 20 years,” he said. “I want to do this as a professional career.”"
