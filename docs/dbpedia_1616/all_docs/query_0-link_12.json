        "text": "A teenage racing driver from Northern Ireland has been offered a dream opportunity to be part of Formula 1 team Red Bull Racing's academy.\n\nMagherafelt's Fionn McLaughlin, 16, recently came through a hugely competitive evaluation week as one one of 11 invited candidates from the UK, Ireland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Lebanon and Mexico.\n\nFrom this aspiring group, the first drivers selected to join the programme were McLaughlin and Sweden's Scott Lindblom.\n\nThe three-day event consisted of prospective young drivers trying and testing open-wheel F4 and GP3 racing cars in a shootout format at the Jerez circuit in Spain.\n\nNew talents join the same path as current F1 drivers Max Verstappen, Carlos Sainz and Daniel Ricciardo in taking part in the Red Bull junior driver development programme.\n\nMcLaughlin began karting at the age of five, and by the time he was seven was competing in and winning in various championships around Ireland.\n\nHe has gone on to compete successfully at British, European and world level and is currently in the OK class, representing Kart Republic as part of the VDK racing team."
