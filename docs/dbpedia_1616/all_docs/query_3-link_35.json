        "text": "Iâ€™m stuck in Aberdeen for a couple of days. I should have been home over a week ago.\n\nI share a lift with a huge shaven-headed Russian and his tiny girlfriend. He looks like a Bond villain. He is softly spoken and politely wishes me good night.\n\nThe hotel is full of Norwegians, they are obviously tourists and despite being on holiday, none of them smile. They save their most severe scowls for the smokers who are hanging around the hotel entrance.\n\nOutside the bar a bloke in his early 30â€™s starts a conversation with me. He is obviously from the south of England, his manner and dress shout â€˜city boyâ€™. He calls me a geordie and tells me that people up here donâ€™t like him. I advise him to get used to it.\n\nWe took a trip up to Hexham, I spent half an hour wandering around the Abbey. As you walk into the Abbey you are faced with a Roman Tombstone, discovered in 1881, it is a memorial to Flavinus, a standard bearer. The carving depicts Flavinus riding over, what I presume is, a native Briton, the victors boot planted on his victims backside. The triumphs of past conquests are often displayed our churches, it is rare to see a memorial depicting our own islands conquest and defeat.\n\nThe original Saxon church was built using stone from nearby Roman sites. The church has been attacked many times during raids by the Vikings and later the Scots.\n\nTo the left of the High Altar is the Leschman Chantry Chapel, containing the tomb of Rowland Leschman, Prior of the Abbey from 1480 to 1491. The carvings on the tomb are an absolute joy.\n\nHeading north out of Wolds I crossed into North Yorkshire and stopped to check out St Nicholas church at North Grimston. The church was built in the 12th century and has been remodelled over the years.\n\nThere are a number of corbels on the south wall, two of which are reputed to be of the exhibitionist type, one depicts a character gripping his ankles baring his backside and groin to the viewer, the other is a bloke in a similar position but with his penis in his hand. Sadly both are very worn and the detail is lost.\n\nRita Wood thinks that this carving of two animals may once have been from the original south doorway which was replaced in the 13th century. It reminded me of the small panel on the church at Newton under Roseberry.\n\nI tried the church door, fully prepared to be disappointed, it opened, another jaw-dropping moment. Iâ€™d seen pictures of this stunning font but to have it there in front of me, to be able to put my hands on it, is an indescribable joy.\n\nThe font is one of the biggest in the country and depicts the the last supper and the crucifixion. There is a depiction of a bishop too, it seems to be the way of things that the bishop gets to feature on the font, I guess he commissioned this thing of beauty so pretty much deserves to be there.\n\nThe chancel arch, if I were to see this in any of our local churches Iâ€™d get quite excited but all I could think about was the magnificent font.\n\nBack outside the church I took another wander around the walls. There are a number of small crosses scratched into the east and west walls, the crosses have been defined by four dots. I presume these are consecration crosses, places where the bishop anointed the original church with holy oil.\n\nNorth Grimston..wow!\n\nEtymology note\n\nIn old Norse Grimr is used as a byname for Ã“Ã°inn. The name is identical with ON grimr â€˜a person who conceals his nameâ€™, lit. â€˜a masked personâ€™, and related to OE grima â€˜a maskâ€™. It refers, like Grimnir to Ã“Ã°innâ€˜s well known habit of appearing in disguise. No dout the Saxons used Grim in the same Way.\n\nE.

This was once the site of a Medieval leper hospital overlain by a nineteenth century tramway, built to transport ironstone from the local mines.\n\nI follow the path uphill, the woodland sits in the winter shadow of the escarpment. I stumble up the steep, muddy track to the lichen-splattered, table-top outcrop, the Hanging Stone.\n\nMany visitors have left their mark on the outcrop.\n\nOut of the shadows, walking from Ryston Nab along Ryston Bank, warmed by the low winter sun. A line of prehistoric barrows follows the scarp edge, the ancestors watch over Bousdale. An intake wall, now in ruins, has been built across the barrows, the tumbled wall stones contain fossils. There were once other cairns here, marked on the early maps, erased by the foresterâ€™s plough.\n\nI leave the footpath and follow a line of boundary stones across Hutton and Newton Moors. The stones follow a low ridge and have been erected on top of prehistoric mounds. The mounds are most likely Bronze Age in date, all have been disturbed by excavation. The boundary stones date from the mid-eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries and mark the parish boundaries between Newton, Pinchinthorpe, Hutton Lowcross, Guisborough and Great Ayton.\n\nRyston: rhiw â€“ Welsh â€˜hill, ascentâ€™\n\nRoseberry Topping â€“ Othensberg 1119\n\n..that of all the unfortunately plain â€“ not to say ugly â€“ structures which do duty for churches in Cleveland this is about the plainest and the most tasteless. One ancient buttress, of Early English character, remains on the north side of the chancel, and that is all which is left to testify to the former existence on this site of a really ecclesiastical building.\n\nHistory of Cleveland Ancient & Modern Vol.1 Rev J. C. Atkinson. 1874\n\nThe lovely Norman font was brought from the ruined church of St Andrew at Upleatham. Rita Wood describes it as square with corner columns and central panels that have bold, well-carved geometric patterns. She tells us that there are similar fonts at Marske and Sneaton that are likely to have been carved by the same person.\n\nThere are a number of stone fragments inside the church including Upleathamâ€™s Big Stone.\n\nOne of the stone fragments is the remains of a Hogback Grave that has probably been re-used as a building block. it is described as a childâ€™s gable-end grave slab. It is classified as a Type E (dragonesque) Hogback, a type confined to the east coast of Yorkshire. It closely resembles two examples found at Lythe.\n\nThe Hogback stone has had a bit of a journey. It was found during an excavation at Upleatham old church, it was then moved into the new church in the village. When the new church was converted into a private home the stone was moved to Kirkleatham museum, where it is currently listed as being located.\n\nSources\n\nHistory of Cleveland Ancient & Modern Vol.1 Rev.

Guy Points. 2007\n\nThe Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Stone Sculpture\n\nFor the past two decades or so I have been researching the links between Cumbria and North Yorkshire. For most of that time my researches have focused upon Prehistory and the movement of people, objects and beliefs.\n\nIn recent years my focus has broadened and Iâ€™ve become interested in the post- Roman period, a time when our identity was more about being Northern than being English. With this in mind I decided to return to Cumbria and spend a couple of days travelling around the Eden Valley.\n\nOn trips like this I can never completely detach myself from Prehistory but I consciously decided to limit the megalithic sites to a couple and loosely focus upon looking for remnants from the post-Roman period onwards.\n\nThe journey started at the western foot of the Stainmore Pass at Brough. For me, Brough has always been the gatekeeper of the Eden valley. The Romans recognised the strategic value of the site and built a large fort there called Verteris, later in the 11th century the Normans chose to build a castle on the Roman site. When seen from the A66 the ruined castle of Brough is generally my first glimpse of the red sandstone of the Eden valley.\n\nSt Michaels Church Brough\n\nIn the bible, Michael the archangel was Godsâ€™ General, leading the forces of heaven in the fight against Satan. It is fitting that the a church built within the confines of a â€˜paganâ€™ roman fort should be dedicated to him. Perhaps the site was once occupied by a Roman temple and continued to be used by local people until the arrival of Christianity. The current church was founded in 12th century and has undergone a number of improvements in the years since.\n\nThere are many masons marks on the exterior walls of the church. Most of them are in the form of a crossed â€˜Zâ€™. I am guessing that the stones as they were quarried and were marked with the orientation of the cross indicating how the stone should be aligned, but this is only a guess.\n\nBuilt into the wall of the porch of the church are a number of large cross slabs and a tribute to the Roman commander of the fort. The stone was found in 1880 during building work to the church. The inscription translates as For the Emperor Caesar Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus and for Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar â€¦ in the consulship of Lateranus and Rufinus.\n\nThe Brough Stone â€“ A Roman tribute, written in Greek, to a young Syrian who died a long way from home.\n\nA lovely Norman arch\n\nA possible Celtic/Romano-British carved head and a hexafoil, a symbol of purity that has been used elsewhere as a folk-magic symbol of protection.\n\nAndy Goldsworthy has built one of his beautiful Cone Pinfolds in the grounds of the local school."
