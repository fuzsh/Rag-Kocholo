The delivery includes a wide range of homes on each site in order to best meet the affordable need in the area.\n\nHarbour Homes has been working in partnership with the housebuilder and recently completed 43 mid-market and social rent properties at Merchant Quay.

Due for completion this autumn, these will include two-bed cottage flats and a mix of three-bedroom semi-detached and terraced homes.\n\nCammo Meadows also has also completed 50 apartments and terraces for sale through Edinburgh Council’s Golden Share Scheme, while Merchant Quay development has recently completed 10 Golden Share homes. The scheme consists of homes which are sold at 80% of their market value, while buyers still own 100% of the property.\n\nWhile a significant number of plots have already completed, all properties will be ready to move into by October.\n\nCllr Stuart McKenzie, Midlothian Cabinet member with responsibility for Housing, said: “There is a real and growing need for affordable homes in Midlothian. “\n\nMidlothian Council is currently active on 13 sites, building 552 Council homes for our communities. Working in partnership with developers is an important source of new affordable housing and we are delighted to have contracted Barratt to build 53 homes for us at Roslin.\n\n“This mix of flats and houses with two and three bedrooms are due to be delivered ahead of schedule.”\n\nHeather Kiteley, Group Chief Executive of Harbour Homes, said: “We are pleased to have been part of this rewarding partnership which has created 43 new affordable homes in Leith, transforming disused brownfield sites into thriving communities.\n\n“Demand for social and mid-market rent homes in the north of the city is especially high, and we are committed to providing brilliant places to live where they are needed most.”\n\nKatie Smart, Director at Places for People Scotland, said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Barratt Homes at Cammo Meadows in Edinburgh.\n\n“At Places for People, we work to change lives by creating and supporting thriving communities and Cammo Meadows is no exception.

According to Moneybox, the Edinburgh area is also the fifth most popular hotspot for first-time buyers.\n\nTo make the move seamless, Barratt Developments, which includes Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes, is currently offering buyers £1,000 for every £20,000 spent, plus flooring included. This cash from the initiative can be used towards a deposit, mortgage repayments or moving costs. A number of selected homes also include upgraded options.\n\nIn addition to a high-quality finish, buyers can expect their home to be energy efficient. According to Barratt Developments’ Tackling the Cost of Living Crisis – 2023 Report, more than 55% of Scots are considering buying a new build home to save on energy bills.\n\nThe recent ‘Watt a Save’ report from the Home Buyers’ Federation (HBF) showed that around 84% of new builds have an energy efficiency rating of A or B, compared to just 4% of existing housing in the UK. Thanks to advanced systems and technologies, all Barratt homes are now up to 63% more energy efficient, which could save homeowners up to £3,100 per year on bills.\n\nAnne Ross, sales director at Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes East Scotland, said: “Location is key when we build our homes, so we’re proud to be able to offer a selection of ‘ready-to-move-into’ properties in some of the most popular areas in Edinburgh and the Lothians.\n\n“These homes are perfect for first time buyers or downsizers looking to mix the hubbub of the capital with suburban living.\n\n“If people reserve now, they can be moved in in time for summer and the process is made even easier with our current incentives – which include mortgage repayments and flooring, in addition to improved energy efficiency. Homebuyers are urged to move quickly, as we expect these homes to be snapped up fast.”\n\nBarratt Homes and David Wilson Homes in the North and West of Scotland also have limited availability on homes ready to move into before summer.\n\nFor more information on available homes or on Barratt Developments in Scotland, visit https://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/scotland-east/\n\nMaximalism, eye-catching colours and unbridled joy are key themes adorning the inside of David Wilson Homes’ newly launched show home at Cammo Meadows in the north-west of Edinburgh.\n\nAs the region’s only three-storey show home, the three-bedroom Ashworth from the five-star housebuilder showcases multifunctional rooms fit for modern family living, designed by leading interior specialists Show Business.\n\nA palette of bold, energetic colours has been used throughout the home, invoking feelings of cheerfulness and happiness – acknowledging a key interior trend for joyful, uplifting and mood boosting spaces recently identified by Wunderman Thompson in its annual trend report.\n\nAnd with various paint brands proclaiming shades of red as their 2023 “colour of the year”, including Pantone’s Viva Magenta, a deep rose shade was selected for the ground-floor family dining room, working as both a grounding neutral and a touch of drama, complemented by a calming teal shade on the opposite wall. Relaxed textures create a laid-back feel to the room, including wood, soft accessories and fur throws.\n\nAlix Riding, creative account manager at Show Business said: “Personality is key when it comes to styling a three-storey home, due to the vast amount of space.\n\n“In this particular home we injected some fun and humour into the rooms with styling pieces such as artwork featuring jumping dogs and children’s artwork, as well as canvasses covered with splashes of paint to add a playful element.\n\n“Pulling colours from wallpapers is a good guide when choosing cushion colours, and don’t be afraid to mix and match different patterns as this adds to the theme of fun and playful.”\n\nUpstairs, subtle touches of maximalist wallpaper make a statement, including animal print in the family bathroom and striped wallpaper on the stairwell. To demonstrate the flexible nature of a three-storey house, the first-floor lounge with Juliet balcony takes an escapist “getaway” style to invoke a sense of calm above the hustle and bustle of family life downstairs.\n\nOn the top storey of the house is the main bedroom with en-suite, which features smooth velvets and panelled walls to create a well curated, smart feel with a wow factor.\n\nAnne Ross, sales director at David Wilson Homes East Scotland, part of Barratt Developments Scotland, said: “We’re really excited to reveal the east of Scotland’s first ever three-storey show home at Cammo Meadows, featuring three uniquely designed floors created for modern family living and with the latest design trends in mind.\n\n“The house sits within a lovely community in the north-west of Edinburgh, less than ten minutes to the beach and just six miles to the city centre.”\n\nHouse hunters are welcome to tour the show home at Cammo Meadows to get a feel for the property first-hand, as well as discover the surrounding area. A mix of three and four-bedroom homes are available, with David Wilson Homes offering incentives including up to £30,000 towards a mortgage, deposit or moving and running costs.\n\nModern building methods and materials also mean owners of new build homes can enjoy savings of up to £2,600 per year on energy bills, according to the HBF “Watt a Save” report published October 2022.\n\nFor more information, visit www.dwh.co.uk.\n\n– Housebuilder supports 1,652 jobs, completes 732 new homes and 13.1ha of green space –\n\nBarratt Developments Scotland, which includes Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes, has made a substantial contribution of £256.3m to the Scottish economy, with the housebuilder’s East Scotland division supplying £106.9m in GVA itself.\n\nIn the year ending 30 June 2021, Barratt East Scotland has also completed 732 new homes of which 144 were affordable and supported 1,652 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the region.\n\n2021 also saw the largest UK housebuilder reinforce its commitment to creating homes for nature as well as people. The business created 13.1ha of public green spaces and private gardens around the region, the equivalent of 19 football pitches, to help support wildlife on and around its sites.\n\nBarratt is working towards reducing its direct carbon emissions by 29% by 2025 and indirect emissions by 24% per square metre by 2030. In the past year, CO2e emissions per 100m.sq. of completed build area fell to 2.25t. across the East Scotland business.\n\n98% of construction waste was also saved from landfill and 26% of new homes were built on previously developed land, up 54% on the previous year.\n\nAlison Condie, managing director for Barratt East Scotland, said: “As the UK’s largest housebuilder, and one of the most sustainable, we place considerable emphasis on supporting people, the environment and generating strong economic growth for the region.\n\n“To have contributed over £106m to the economy and supported over 1,652 jobs is a fantastic achievement and we’re determined to do even better this year.”\n\nAs part of its housebuilding activity, Barratt East Scotland has made £5.4m in local contributions to help build new facilities and community infrastructure. This contribution includes the provision of 320 new school places.\n\nMore than £19.3m has also been spent on physical works within communities, such as highways, environmental improvements and community facilities.\n\nOther key findings from the Barratt East Scotland 2021 socio-economic report include:\n\n· Increased support for public services with £23.9m in generated tax revenues\n\n· Over £36,400 donated to local charitable and community causes\n\n· 284 supplier and 335 sub-contractor companies supported\n\n· Increased support for the UK supply chain with 90% of all components centrally procured, assembled or manufactured in-country\n\n· More than £10.7m in retail spending by new residents, helping support 114 retail and service-related jobs\n\nThe development of new and future talent remains a key priority for Barratt Developments Scotland and 53 graduates, apprentices and trainees launched their careers with the company in 2021, 15 from the East Scotland Division.\n\nThe assessment of Barratt Developments’ performance was carried out by independent consultants Lichfields, who analysed socio-economic impacts through the delivery chain for new housing based on Barratt datasets, published research and national statistics.\n\nIt’s National Nestbox Week (14 – 21 February) and Barratt Developments Scotland is encouraging the nation to get involved with bird conservation from their very own gardens.\n\nGarden birds need a safe place to raise their chicks, and it’s both fun and easy for residents to open up their gardens and give them a home for the season. Britain is in need of more nestboxes to help support bird populations, and National Nestbox Week aims to raise awareness of how quick and easy it is to play an important part.\n\nTo coincide with the week, Barratt has created an online nestbox quiz for homeowners to learn more about their feathered friends and how to make their own gardens wildlife-friendly for nature’s neighbours. Those taking the quiz are in with a chance of winning up to £100 in RSPB vouchers.\n\nIt comes as part of Barratt Developments Scotland’s, which includes Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes, commitment to supporting wildlife on developments and celebrating its national partnership with the RSPB.\n\nEach entrant to the quiz will be able to learn more about a range of birds as they’re asked to match common species to the homes that suit their needs.\n\nEstelle Sykes, Sales Director at Barratt Development Scotland, said: “We always try to give nature a home at our developments, creating new habitats as part of our long-term partnership with the RSPB.\n\n“Alongside National Nestbox Week, hopefully this quiz can help get all generations involved in learning more about wildlife and nature.”\n\nNational Nestbox Week is organised by the British Trust for Ornithology and aims to encourage more people to help the birds by putting up nestboxes.\n\nAnyone wishing to take part in the housebuilder’s digital bird quiz has until Monday 28 February 2022 to enter the prize draw.\n\nWith six prizes up for grabs in the form of RSPB vouchers, homeowners can make their garden inviting for birds, in addition to other wildlife such as hedgehogs, bees and butterflies.\n\nTo take part in the quiz, please visit: https://birdhousequiz.co.uk/.\n\nWhen looking to place a nestbox in a garden, it’s important to find a sheltered, shady location, preferably facing north through east to south-east to avoid prevailing winds and strong direct sunlight. Nestboxes also need to be kept out of reach of cats and other predators.\n\nThere are many ways that residents in the country can help the birds in their garden, such as providing a regular supply of clean water by using a bird bath, providing nestboxes and putting the right bird seed out including flaked maize and sunflower hearts.\n\nFor more information about Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes, visit the website at www.barratthomes.co.uk or www.dwh.co.uk.\n\nEnvironmentally-minded buyers can save thousands with new green deals being offered by housebuilder\n\nBarratt Developments Scotland is leading the way in delivering eco-friendly homes to buyers in Scotland, and is well on its way to meeting top energy efficiency standards set out by the Scottish Government.\n\nLatest research by the UK’s largest housebuilder, which owns Barratt and David Wilson homes, shows that all of Barratt’s new homes (100 per cent) are built to a minimum EPC rating of B or above.\n\nThis puts Barratt ahead of schedule in meeting the Scottish Government’s Heat in Buildings Strategy, which sets housebuilders an ambitious target to achieve a good standard of energy efficiency, and by 2033 to meet at least an EPC band C standard.\n\nAll new homes are given an EPC rating between A and G, with A being the most energy efficient in terms of likely fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions, but there are currently no legal requirements on a minimum EPC rating for new build homes.\n\nThe housebuilder has also announced a new partnership with Halifax bank that now offers green mortgages to environmentally-minded buyers, which means that those purchasing Barratt’s energy-efficient homes could be offered a larger loan with lower interest rates as a consequence of their smaller anticipated energy bills.\n\nDoug McLeod, regional managing director for Barratt Developments in Scotland, believes newly-built properties’ eco credentials could soon be the ultimate selling point for homeowners, in particular first-time buyers struggling to get on the property market. He said: “A new generation of homebuyers could find new homes with green credentials as their only affordable option.\n\n“We know that energy spending can be a major household outgoing and a big part of the consideration when buying a new home. Environmental considerations are also becoming increasingly important for home buyers as we search for ways to create a net zero carbon emission society, and at Barratt Homes we are committed to playing our part by enabling our customers to make greener choices when it comes to buying a new house.\n\n“The affordability of some of the green mortgage deals, combined with the energy efficiency and cheaper running costs of new build homes, are already leading to more and more first-time buyers taking the new build route into home ownership.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Barratt has taken a lead for the housebuilding industry.\n\nLast month, Barratt launched a unique flagship zero carbon home concept called the Z House that will be occupied and monitored to assess its performance. And last year, the company announced its commitment to reduce direct carbon emissions by 29 per cent by 2025 and to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its own operations by 2040.\n\nThe winner of Sustainable House Builder of the Year, Barratt will also cut its indirect carbon emissions (those coming from its homes and from its supply chain) by 24 per cent per square metre by 2030. Building lower carbon homes and using more sustainable materials will be a key part of achieving this target.\n\nIt will also deliver new zero carbon standard house types from 2030 and ensure that 100 per cent of the electricity that it purchases will be renewable by 2025.\n\nAs the country’s largest housebuilder, Doug McLeod, says they have a major role to play in looking after the environment in a sustainable way for future generations, whilst also delivering the homes this country urgently needs.\n\nAll new Barratt homes are up to 57 per cent cheaper to run, meaning homeowners could save up to £1,410 on their bills each year compared to an updated Victorian equivalent property.\n\nThey come with features such as modern double glazing fitted with argon gas that is designed to capture the sunlight and flood rooms with light, as well as smart technologies which include solar panels, highly efficient boilers, heat recovery, and increased insulation in walls, floors and roofs to make sure that draughts won’t cause winter chills.\n\nDavid Balfour, account director at New Homes Mortgage Scotland, said: “We are increasingly hearing from our customers that they’re interested in purchasing an energy efficient home as they prioritise environmentally-friendly lifestyles.\n\n“Green mortgages are most commonly available on new build homes where homebuyers could benefit from cheaper rates and cashback incentives.\n\n“Eligibility for many of the green mortgage deals is linked to the property’s EPC rating – for example, it might need to be A or B. A large proportion of the UK’s housing stock is old. This is one reason why more and more homeowners and first-time buyers are choosing new build properties that are sold with excellent EPC ratings of B and above.”\n\nReducing carbon emissions and having the top energy efficiency ratings in new build homes isn’t the only way Barratt is helping to save the planet. They are also making wildlife-friendly places to live through their partnership with RSPB, the country’s largest nature conservation charity.\n\nBy 2023 Barratt will further prioritise wildlife on all new developments by creating dedicated spaces for local biodiversity conservation, installing a range of wildlife-friendly features including hedgehog hideaways and swift nesting sites. Beyond 2023 their goal is to have at least 10 per cent more wildlife habitats in and around developments, delivering a clear biodiversity net gain across the country.\n\nGreen mortgage case study (Edinburgh)\n\nGraeme Pearson, aged 37, has swapped his draughty Victorian tenement flat with old timber sash and case windows and extremely high ceilings for a three-bed end terrace Barratt home in Edinburgh. He moved in with his partner in November 2021 and is looking forward to a more energy efficient and quick heating home with lower fuel bills.\n\nGraeme, who has benefited from a green mortgage deal with a lower interest rate and cash back deal through Barratt’s partnership with Halifax, said: “My last home was an old Victorian tenement flat that was almost impossible to heat and had draughts everywhere.\n\n“It could be bitterly cold in the winter so my partner and I are very much looking forward to our brand new Barratt home that has plenty of eco credentials to shout about, from below slab insulation to efficient uPVC windows. I also opted for the installation of a convection hob as I believe moving away from gas cooking is an important step towards future sustainability, and we have solar panels on the roof.\n\n“I might consider installing an EV charging point in the future and running a cable across the footway to an adjacent parking space.”\n\nFor more information on Barratt’s eco-friendly homes, visit\n\nwww.barratthomes.co.uk."
