She reported that she had heard several strings of shots being fired from site #62, that approximately 40 to 50 gunshots had come from this campsite over several hours along with loud arguing between a man and a woman, and that she had seen the man acting erratically, dancing wildly and shouting in the campsite. Rangers responded, evacuated about 30 other campers, and sealed off the area. By this time, darkness had fallen and the area around site #62 was quiet, with no one visible. Rangers set up a containment perimeter and began surveillance; they checked the registration of a vehicle at the site, and found it belonged to 25-year-old T.C., III, of Sparks, Nevada. The occupants of the tent were ordered to come out. T.C. and a woman, later identified as 25-year-old J.T., also of Sparks, exited and were detained by rangers. A search of the tent uncovered a loaded semi-automatic 9 millimeter pistol with a round chambered and a magazine bearing 17 more rounds, several other loaded and discharged magazines, copious quantities of beer and tequila, and a leather pouch containing several bundles of a white powdery substance believed to be either cocaine or methamphetamines. Three buds of suspected marijuana were also recovered from J.T.'s wallet. Both J.T. and T.C. have denied ownership of the controlled substances. The two were arrested for possession of controlled substances, and T.C. was also booked into the Yosemite jail for possessing a loaded firearm within a park area and for recklessly discharging a firearm in a park area. Their vehicle and their dog, a pit bull, were impounded. Further investigation revealed that warrants existed for T.C.'s arrest on a variety of traffic offenses in California.

The pair had already climbed about 2,000 feet since they began the climb. If successful, Wellman will become the first paraplegic to climb one of the world's most challenging cliffs. The two should complete the climb late today or early Wednesday. Wellman, who is using his arms to make the ascent, has estimated that it will take him 7,000 pull-ups to reach the top. Wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet during a climb in 1982. (Associated Press report).\n\nThursday, July 27, 1989\n\n89-192 - Yosemite - Follow-up on Paraplegic Ascent of El Capitan\n\nClimbers Dike Corbett and Mark Wellman, a 29-year-old paraplegic ranger, reached the summit of El Capitan yesterday afternoon, seven days and four hours after they began their ascent. Wellman is the first paraplegic to conquer El Capitan. The climb took en estimated 7,000 pull-ups, each of which advanced him only a half foot.

Y.C. was climbing a moderately technical route without the aid of climbing equipment. The 50 foot fall caused serious compound fractures to both lower bones in Y.C.'s right leg and major trauma to his head and face. Ranger response to the scene was delayed by high, gusty winds which precluded helicopter use. The rescue team reached the scene at dusk, stabilized Y.C.'s injuries, and prepared him for either a helicopter or lowering rescue for the following morning. Angel IV, a rescue helicopter from Lemoore Naval Air Station, arrived on scene at 8 a.m. yesterday morning. After making 14 passes in gusty winds and clouds, rescuers in the helicopter were finally able to cable winch Y.C. aboard the ship and transport him to Yosemite Medical Center, where he was treated for his injuries.

After reaching the summit line, he began descending the east slope, lost the trail, then slipped and fell down a ravine and broke his leg. Despite severe pain in his upper right leg, J.H. was able to get into his sleeping bag. Over the ensuing days, he shouted for help, but his cries were not heard. He also made several unsuccessful attempts to ascend the ravine to the trail above. Although he ran out of food after a couple of days, J.H. was able to get water from a nearby stream. On September 7th, J.H. spent seven hours crawling up the ravine and finally gained the trail, where he was found by hikers who gave him some candy bars, then went to a ranger station for help. Rangers hiked in to the area that evening and directed a helicopter crew to the spot on the following morning. J.H. is being treated for his injuries, but is reported, to be in excellent shape.

Elkins was killed instantly; his passengers, A. and J.S., are hospitalized in, respectively, critical and serious condition. J.M., the driver of the second vehicle, sustained a spinal injury; his wife and two small children, aged five and six, received nunor injuries. J.M. was driving under the influence of alcohol and will be charged with felony manslaughter.

He said that the two of them had arrived in the park that afternoon and stopped at Tunnel View. He said that she went for a walk while he took a nap, and that he could not find her after he awoke. A search was begun, and her body was found the next day at the bottom of a 350-foot cliff. A joint investigation involving the NPS and the FBI was begun shortly thereafter. S.G. was an enlisted man at Lemoore NAS at the time of the incident, so the Naval Investigative Service assisted in the probe. Investigators found that the two had been married in August, 1987, and that S.G. had taken cut over $400,000 in insurance policies on her life just prior to her death. On October 20, 1989, following an 18- month-long investigation, S.G., now discharged from the Navy, was arrested for the murder of his wife. He was arraigned in US District Court in Fresno on October 23rd and pleaded innocent. S.G. is being held without bail in the Fresno County jail. A status conference is scheduled for January 29th to determine when the trial will be held. S.G. faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole.

Park visitor E.W. had been attempting to take photographs off the trail when he fell into the cascade pools. Although E.W. was able to extricate himself, he again fell into the creek on his second photo attempt, then slid approximately 100 feet down a cliff and became lodged in the swift water of the inner gorge between upper and lower Yosemite Falls. Rangers Joe Sumner and Kim Aufhauser were helicoptered in wet suits to a site near E.W., then rappelled 180 feet down a tributary waterfall to reach him. E.W. was unhurt, but severely hypothermic, having been up to his lower chest in 40 degree temperature water for over four hours. During the raising procedure (using a chest harness and Z-rig hauling rope system), E.W. stopped breathing. Aufhauser and Sumner stopped the procedure, quickly administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and were able to maintain E.W.'s airway. With E.W. now in a full harness, the raising process began again. Unfortunately, those manning the hauling system were unable to see either E.W., Aufhauser and Sumner or the obstacles that they wer encountering. During the final stages of raising, E.W. and Sumner were pulled through a waterfall and were momentarily unable to breathe. Ranger Kerry Maxwell, acting as spotter, radioed an urgent warning of their predicament and hastened the pulling efforts of the raising team. Sumner's head finally came through the falling water far enough to allow him to breathe and he was able to pull E.W.'s head out of the water as well. Exhausted, Aufhauser and Sumner finally succeeded in bringing the 230-pound E.W. to a site where he could be evacuated by helicopter; he was short-hauled to the valley floor by the park's contract ship just before dark. Rain and windy conditions during the entire operation made helicopter operations difficult. Visibility at the end of the evacuation flight prevented the helicopter from either leaving the valley or evacuating staff from the rescue site. Subsequent reports showed E.W.'s body core temperature to be 83 degrees. He was transported by ambulance from the park and subsequently flown by Medi-Flight to a hospital in Modesto. E.W. was subsequently released from that hospital without permanent injury.

E.R. later said that he'd told two friends where he was going, but neither of them confirmed this. His supervisor reported him overdue on the 27th when he failed to show up for work for the second day. An investigation was begun into the matter. On the 29th, rangers contacted a bus driver who thought he might have left E.R. off at Glacier Point on the 24th, but a search for a possible suicide victim had been going on in the area for three days and E.R. had not been seen during that time. On the 30th, E.R.'s girl friend in New Orleans was contacted, and she reported that he'd sent her a letter saying he was going to Snow Creek Falls. Because of three other rescues in progress, the first flight searching for E.R. was made three hours later at 7 p.m. He was spotted on a small ledge near the falls fifteen minutes later. Three rangers rappelled 200 feet to him, splinted his fractured ankle and prepared him for a helicopter short haul. E.R. was medevaced out just before dark. E.R. told rangers he'd fractured his ankle when he lost his balance while taking a photo, fell 100 feet, and came to rest on the ledge. He was unable to crawl back to the trail due to the steepness of the cliff, and could not yell to hikers in the area due to the roar of the falls. E.R. drank his two canteens of water the first day; he subsisted on his own fluid excretions and insects for the next six days. E.R. apparently learned survival skills as an Eagle Scout and conserved energy by remaining out of the sun and not moving around. Doctors stated that this conservation of energy may have saved his life, as it was unlikely that he could have survived another night in his condition without water. At the time of his rescue, E.R.'s ankle was infested by maggots and was suffering from gangrene. E.R. was cared for at the park's medical clinic, then transferred to a hospital. His foot will be saved and should work well after surgery.

S.A.G. was convicted of first degree murder for killing his wife, D.C.G., by pushing her off a 350-foot cliff in the Discovery View area of the park on December 5, 1987. S.A.G. told rangers at that time that his wife had disappeared while hiking in the area. Her body was discovered the following day after an extensive search, and her death was initially believed to have been an accident. However, contradictory statements made by S.A.G. concerning the circumstances of his wife's death led to further investigation by rangers and FBI agents. It was also learned that S.A.G. had insured his wife of three months for $437,000 just six weeks before the incident. That investigation led to a murder indictment against Gray on October 19, 1989. S.A.G. faces a potential maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Sentencing has been scheduled for September 10th.

It was initially thought that he was lost outside of the park, but his car was found at the Sentinel Dome parking lot on July 9th. His body was soon found in the Bridalveil Falls drainage near the rim of Yosemite Valley. V.B. was a camera buff, and apparently walked west from the parking lot to the point where his body was found. There was no fall involved and no signs of foul play. His death is believed to have been from natural causes, but an investigation is underway.

Shortly thereafter, they stopped in Seattle, where they stole a Seattle Police Department undercover vice vehicle. Later that month, they committed a burglary of a map fee box at Redwoods. On July 2nd, they broke into a Forest Service/National Park Service visitor center at Manzanita Lake at Lassen Volcanic and stole the safe; later that day, they committed additional burglaries in four Forest Service buildings. On July 3rd, M.F.S.S. sexually molested one of the two women with him, which the victim reported to park rangers at Yosemite on the 5th. M.F.S.S. was arrested on July 6th and charged with burglary of the visitor center at Lassen, burglary and theft at the Forest Service sites, possession of stolen property, and possession of a stolen vehicle. The sexual incident is being investigated by the Mono County Sheriff's Office, and the theft of the police vehicle is being investigated by Seattle PD. Additional charges are anticipated.

The quake was strongly felt in the Yosemite Valley area; residents reported that it was extremely loud and lasted for at least 15 seconds. The Tioga Pass road was closed overnight due to rock slides outside of the park which have since been removed by Cal Trans work crews. Rock slides also closed Highway 140 and 120 in the park. One lane of Highway 140 was opened for administrative travel at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, and was scheduled to be completely opened later in the day. large rocks still need to be removed from Highway 120 near the junction with 140 and a stretch of pavement 30 feet long also must be replaced. The road has been closed indefinitely from Crane Flat Junction east. Due to the reduction in services available in the park, entrance fees have been suspended. Services should be fully restored within three to four days.

The pair were charged under 36 CFR 2.35. One of the two admitted to the offense while being questioned, pled guilty upon arraignment, and received a $1,000 fine and two years probation; the other will be prosecuted. The arrests stemmed from an investigation which was initiated after information was received from a confidential informant. Rangers observed and recorded four buys during the investigation.

The vehicle had been used by unknown persons who'd been involved in fraudulent credit card use in Lee Vining, east of the park. When NCIC inquiries were subsequently conducted, rangers found that the Cherokee had been stolen in Orange County, and that the license plates, registration and proof of insurance had been stolen at Grand Canyon. The suspects were also in possession of various stolen credit cards. Photographs found in the Cherokee indicated that the suspects had been visiting parks throughout the Southwest and employing the stolen credit cards there. The cards were in the names of George Derrington and Thomas Hornung.

At the time of his arrest, M.D. was found with a small quantity of marijuana and $740 in $20 bills. M.D. had been under investigation for several weeks for sexual assault, for possession and distribution of controlled substances, and for intimidating and threatening to murder the victim of a sexual assault who was also a possible government witness. During interviews with M.D., rangers learned that he had been making weekly trips to Fresno to purchase quarter- to half-pound quantities of marijuana, which he then brought to Yosemite and sold. M.D. also admitted to illegal sexual contacts with both adults and juveniles. Felony charges are pending. M.D. is currently being held in custody on these and other pending charges pertaining to formal court probation for a burglary conviction in which he has been ordered to make restitution of $20,000.

At 1:00 that afternoon, rangers Lalone and Bardsley found Z.P.'s vehicle at Crane Flat and saw an empty handgun box and ammunition within. They finally spotted Z.P. after tracking her for six miles through the snow up the Tioga Road. As the rangers attempted to communicate with her, Z.P. removed a .38 caliber revolver from her pack and brandished it. She threatened to shoot the rangers if they interfered with her suicide attempt. When both rangers drew their weapons, Z.P. left the road and headed into the woods. Rangers Bardsley and Johnson tracked her for another half mile up the south fork of the Tuolumne drainage and found Z.P. with the weapon still in her hand. They took cover and began talking with her. Z.P. repeated her threat to shoot a ranger if they attempted to interfere with her. After three hours of negotiation, the rangers rushed and subdued her. Rangers Johnson and Lalone sustained minor injuries in the altercation.

Earlier that week, M.S., a former employee of Yosemite Park and Curry Company, allegedly broke into one of the company's buildings and stole a complete set of vending machine keys and a company radio. During the week, M.S. purportedly employed the keys to break into Coke vending machines and utilized tools to break into newspaper vending machines. Informants gave law enforcement rangers information about M.S.'s activities and provided the location of the stolen property. The radio, several master keys, a portion of the vending machine money and stolen tools have been recovered. M.S. allegedly broke into the more remote vending machines in the middle of the night while monitoring Curry security officers' radio transmissions; he is said to have utilized a mountain bike for transportation. M.S. was on supervised parole at the time of his arrest and is being held without bail on five felony counts. It's estimated that over $400 was stolen from the various vending machines.

E.W. and her four passengers - nephews L.T., 5, and M.T., 3; niece S., 7; and the children's grandmother, P.W.J. all survived the crash and climbed onto the car's roof. The girl was able to grab a rope thrown to the car from the shore and was pulled to safety; her brothers tried to hold onto her, but were swept away by the swift current. E.W. then dove into the river in an attempt to rescue the boys, but failed to reach them. She was unconscious by the time rangers reached her and was pronounced dead soon thereafter at the Yosemite Medical Clinic. Meanwhile, P.W.J. was rescued from the car's roof. An air, water and ground search was begun for the two boys, but has so far been fruitless. Six teams of snorkelers and scuba divers searched the less turbulent areas of the river along a two and a half mile stretch from the accident site, but were unable to find either of the victims.

A medic was lowered to S.M.'s location late in the afternoon, but rain and snow prevented evacuation. The medic remained with S.M. on the ledge through the night. S.M. was raised to the summit the next day; when the weather cleared briefly around 4:00 p.m., he was picked up by helicopter and flown to the valley floor. Over 20 people were involved in the rescue effort. This was the 33rd SAR mission of the month.

The group had failed to obtain a permit for the demonstration; rangers told them that they would have to leave the area, but that they would be allowed to obtain a special use permit to demonstrate elsewhere. They were given 15 minutes to leave the housing area. When the rangers returned to the area with a park forestry crew, the demonstrators blocked the roadway to prevent the crew from reaching the work site. The demonstrators were told that they would be arrested if they did not disperse. When they failed to leave, rangers arrested David Orr, 33, of Davis, California. The remaining demonstrators agreed to disperse immediately after his arrest.

Ten park personnel and a helicopter responded to the scene, but were unable to find her. Witnesses indicate that M.B. was standing on a large boulder next to the river's edge and that she apparently slipped and fell into the river. The river is presently classified as white water at this location. Search efforts have been suspended due to other search and rescue activities.

Park and Forest Service firefighters attacked and suppressed the fire within several hours, limiting the burn to a third of anacre. Investigators subsequently determined that the fire was mancaused and probably arson. The fire took place at a permanent camp which is apparently being used as a base camp for poachers. G.P., who was convicted in magistrate's court this spring for having a permanent camp within park boundaries, was spotted in the area the day before the fire and is a suspect in this case. The investigation is continuing.

The theft of the truck had been witnessed by the owner, who advised police that there was a loaded automatic handgun under the front seat. After all visitor traffic was stopped on the Wawona Road, rangers attempted a felony vehicle stop, but the driver, later identified as J.E.Y. of Corona, California, fled at speeds in excess of 65 mph. The park contract helicopter spotted the stolen truck and maintained visual surveillance while patrol units responded to the area. After seeing the helicopter, York stopped the truck and fled on foot. Rangers pursued. J.E.Y. attempted to hide in Big Creek by submerging himself with only his face above the water, but he was spotted and arrested. J.E.Y. has an extensive criminal history, including three prior convictions for grand theft auto.

The park helicopter immediately flew SAR personnel and equipment to a landing zone near the scene. The victim, F.M., had fallen 20 to 25 feet into the water, but had managed to drag himself up onto a boulder in the middle of the stream. He complained of severe pain in one of his legs. Rescue personnel packaged the victim in a prerigged Stokes litter and employed a shorthaul extraction with the helicopter. F.M. was brought to the valley floor, then transported to the park's medical clinic, where Zrays confirmed that he had a fractured femur. Investigation of the incident revealed that F.M. had wandered several hundred feet from the established trail onto slippery, water-polished granite rocks and had then fallen into the stream.

Rescue personnel searched the trail on foot and interviewed hikers and the park helicopter searched from the air that evening, but they were unable to locate a victim. A day pack was found at the top of the falls that evening which contained possible identification of the victim. Searchers found the body at the base of Upper Yosemite Falls above the Middle Cascades at about 1:00 p.m. on the 12th. Nine rescue personnel recovered the body.

The girl was on a commercial pack trip from Mammoth. Her sister discovered her body in the morning. It appears that she had ingested over 80 tablets of Norpramin, an anti-depressant drug, on the previous evening.

Upon arrival at the scene, they found a 1987 BMW which had been damaged by a fire which had been extinguished by passing visitors. The rangers could smell the odor of an accelerant and began an arson investigation. The vehicle belongs to a concession employee who works at the hotel, and it is believedthat the fire was started by another employee.

Two park engines responded and found the fire confined to a closet in the dorm. Initial investigation revealed that an improperly used extension cord had caused the fire. Property damage has been placed at about $2,000. It's estimated that the value of property saved was about $250,000. The dorm serves as concession employee housing for the Yosemite Park and Curry Company.

The caller reported that he had heard what he thought were gunshots and that one man was beating another in a nearby campsite. Rangers Jeff Lynn and Kelly McCloskey arrived at the campsite, observed disorderly behavior, and were immediately confronted by a belligerent A.T., who said that he had a gun and made a move to a van in an apparent attempt to get the weapon. The rangers drew their service revolvers. A.T. moved away from the van without a weapon, though, and instead grabbed a lantern from a neighboring campsite, jumped up on a picnic table and began swinging the lantern at rangers and bystanders and threatening them with serious bodily harm. Two more rangers arrived on scene, and the foursome attempted to calm A.T. and take him into custody peacefully. A.T. continued to threaten them, however, and lunged violently towards any ranger coming close to him. A.T. then moved swiftly through the campground, grabbed a second lantern from another site, and started swinging both of them. A friend of A.T. who tried to calm him down was struck in the head and shoulder by the lanterns. As A.T. headed toward the bank of the Merced River, he told rangers he was getting a knife and reached into his back pocket. Service revolvers were again drawn, and again A.T. failed to produce a weapon. He then jumped into the river; the four rangers and A.T.' friend attempted unsuccessfully to stop him. When A.T. emerged from the other side of the river in another campground, rangers McCloskey, Lynn, Martinez and Obernesser were able to subdue him and take him into custody. Although restrained, A.T. broke his restraints in a caged patrol car and seriously damaged both back doors and one window. He continued to be uncooperative at the park's jail and it took a minimum of six people to move him. A.T. will be charged with four felonies and several misdemeanors, including assault on a federal officer. Nearly all the rangers involved in his arrest incurred at least some minor injuries. One ranger will be on light duty for three days with an ankle injury. Investigation revealed that A.T. had many previous convictions for violence and drug-related offenses and that he was a manic depressive. A.T. admitted that he had not been taking his medication.

They told the ranger that two drunk males who were throwing bottles and yelling obscenities had chased them off the bridge. The rangers made contact with the two men J.M., 21, of Newport Beach, California, and M.A., 25, of Ontario, California and saw that they were significantly under the influence of alcohol or drugs. While attempting to arrest them, one of the rangers was struck in the face by J.M., who subsequently ran from the bridge and into a nearby campground. After securing M.A., the two rangers pursued J.M. on foot. J.M. was waiting behind a tree and lunged at the first ranger, striking him several times in the face and head with his fists. One of the rangers employed an extendable baton to strike J.M., but without effect. J.M. then ran from the rangers again, and again turned and attacked the same ranger. J.M. was finally subdued and arrested. He was charged with two counts of assault on an officer and several misdemeanor charges, including resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and being under the influence.

The action, which came about as the result of information provided by a confidential informant, led to the seizure of LSD, marijuana and documents which revealed details about an active drug distribution network in the Yosemite and San Francisco areas. Acting on that information, which corroborated additional information from the informant, rangers sought and received permission for a consent search of the residence of N.T., 28, also a concession employee in Yosemite. The search revealed more LSD, U.S. currency, and further documentary evidence. Both were charged with violations of 21 USC; they have been arraigned on the felony counts and are currently awaiting detention hearings.

Campers were evacuated from the immediate area. Law enforcement office investigators and California fire marshal and explosives disposal personnel responded. A portable Xray machine was used to examine the devices. Both proved to be highly suspicious, so a decision was made to detonate them on scene. They were exploded without incident. Examination of the rounds indicated that they were decoy explosive devices. An investigation is underway to determine who put the devices in the campground. [J.R.

M.L. and several friends were hiking from the Kibbie Lake wilderness parking lot to their camp at Lake Eleanor when M.L., who had been drinking heavily, stepped off the trail to relieve himself. His friends continued to the campsite. When M.L. failed to show up, his friends searched the area, then contacted park rangers. A search was begun which employed the park helicopter and 150 people and dogs from numerous federal, state, local and volunteer agencies. An observer in the helicopter spotted M.L. in the middle of Cherry Creek at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st. He was six miles from the point last seen. Investigators subsequently determined that M.L. and his four friends had camped at Lake Eleanor on Saturday, August 17th, and that the group had consumed three cases of beer that evening. On Sunday morning, the five of them had drunk 10 liters of wine.

The intercom landed on the mesh grill and the holding cell's spotlight ignited the intercom wires. The fire smoldered for some time before the onduty jailer discovered it. The fire destroyed the jail's intercom system, and it's estimated that it will cost approximately $1,000 to replace it. The jail does not have either sprinkler or fire alarm systems.

The assault followed a lengthy argument the evening before in which M.R., a Yosemite Park and Curry Company employee, made threats of violence and racial insults toward other Camp Six residents. M.R. was intoxicated at the time. Following the argument, M.C., W.K. and A.K., also employees of the concessioner, then drove to Madera, California, where they picked up R.M. and returned to Yosemite. R.M. brought a 12-gauge shotgun and ammunition with him. During the trip back, the group agreed to bring M.R. to a parking area, hit him with the butt of the shotgun and otherwise beat him up, and shoot him if he resisted. When they returned to Camp Six, R.M. and M.C. assaulted M.R., inflicting minor injuries. M.C. apparently hesitated to use the shotgun, thereby limiting the attack to a physical beating. M.C., R.M. and M.R. were arrested; M.C. and R.M. were charged with assault, Riddick with disorderly conduct. A search of R.M.'s residence and work place by Madera police officers led to the discovery and seizure of a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 caliber rifle and to the arrest of another man for violation of parole.

V.T. became agitated during the encounter and was subsequently patted down for weapons. While the pat down was underway, V.T. threw a plastic bag containing marijuana on the ground. He was arrested and taken to the park's jail, and was found to be under the influence of PCP at the time of his booking. An additional pound of marijuana and a pound of suspected PCP were found during an inventory search of Trevino's property. V.T. also had stab wounds no more than four days old on his chest.

On the following evening, rangers received reports of cries for help from El Capitan, and found two climbers, S.P. and D.M., stranded in a hanging bivouac about 2,000 feet up the Sea of Dreams route and under a waterfall created by storm runoff. The climbers said that they were unhurt, but that they were unable to move because of the storm and were becoming hypothermic. Because of the poor weather conditions, ground and air rescue efforts were begun simultaneously. A 17-member ground team made a nine-mile, five-hour-long summit approach during the early morning hours of the 27th and reached the edge of El Capitan at 8:00 a.m. Meanwhile, an Army National Guard CH-47 moved a 12-member team to the top of El Capitan during a lull in the storm. Rescue teams made a 700-foot lowering to the stranded climbers; after being warmed, S.P. and D.M. were able to ascend a fixed line to the summit. While the first team was climbing out, another two-man climbing team began to yell for help. The two men, Russ Walling and Erik Erikson, were located 200 yards east of the first party and 400 feet below the summit. When contacted, they told rescuers that one of them had frostbite and that they were unable to complete the climb. The rescue team divided and made a 400- foot lowering to the pair, who were also able to extricate themselves by climbing a fixed line. Post-rescue interviews revealed that the climbers had been buffeted by high winds that ripped rain shelters from portable ledges and exposed them to the elements. S.P. and D.M. had bivouacked in a location that became a down chute for runoff, and other climbers on the wall reported that at one point during the storm the two men had completely disappeared under a waterfall. All victims were airlifted to the Valley medical center, where they were treated and released.

Both E.B. and S.M.W. have admitted guilt in these cases and are awaiting hearings before a federal grand jury in Fresno. The two men have been committing thefts throughout central California and eastern Nevada, and may have committed similar crimes (with or without accomplices) in the southern Midwest and West. Their method of burglary has been to either remove the safe from the building and open it away from the scene or to peel open the safe at the scene using a pry bar. The method of burglary for the pipe safes has been to either pull out the safe sleeves or break the interior locking mechanism with a chain and pry bar. If you have any information on crimes of this nature, please contact Jeff Sullivan in the Yosemite law enforcement office for additional information (FTS 448-4245 or 209-372-0245).

The party was spotted by observers in a helicopter just after noon on the 2nd. Neither K.B. nor C.A. was injured, but their food supply was virtually exhausted. The pair had been unable to traverse the deep snow, even with snowshoes.

Upon arrival, they found M.C., 28, a former Curry Company employee, lying unconscious on the floor of a dorm restroom. During their examination of M.C., he went into respiratory arrest, and the rangers initiated advanced life support measures. He was taken to the park's clinic, then transferred to the Merced Community Medical Clinic, where he was placed on a life support system. M.C. never regained consciousness, though, and died on January 15th after life support measures were terminated. Yosemite investigators Jablonski, Sullivan and Hinson determined that M.C. had ingested large quantities of methamphetamines prior to the time he was found in the restroom. Law enforcement rangers from the Valley District conducted in-depth interviews within the community and identified several witnesses. A suspect was subsequently taken into custody on two counts of felony possession of Schedule III drugs (methamphetamines). A homicide investigation is being conducted to determine who provided the drugs to M.C.

E.L.W. was reported missing by family members when he failed to return home from the park as planned on January 24th. Investigators learned that he had spent four nights in Yosemite Lodge before leaving on a hike on the 24th. They also found that he was a psychiatric patient with a history of substance abuse, that he believed he was being persecuted by satanic cults, that he had been depressed lately, and that he'd stopped taking his prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. Although he apparently planned to stay out for several days, he had no camping equipment and took only food and alcohol with him. Wilson survived three nights by seeking shelter under overhanging rocks and building fires. He was found uninjured in extremely hazardous terrain in lower Tenaya Canyon, approximately two and a half miles from Yosemite Valley. He was flown by helicopter to the valley, then taken to a local hospital for psychiatric evaluation. Approximately 50 people and a helicopter were employed in the search, including a ten-person investigative unit. U.S. Park Police officers from the San Francisco field office also assisted with the investigation.

Several rangers and visitors were threatened and injured during the incident. A.T. was subsequently charged with four felony counts of assault on federal officers. He pled guilty to one of the four counts, and was sentenced to eight months in jail. A.T. has a long history of violent and drug-related crimes.

A fourth employee, R.C., was arrested in Merced on the 25th by California Highway Patrol officers on an outstanding warrant stemming from this investigation. One additional warrant remains outstanding for an individual who is still at large. P.L. and J.D. have pled guilty to multiple counts of distribution of controlled substances; V.S. has pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance. The case against R.C. for distribution of a controlled substance is pending. The arrests stemmed from a six-month-long undercover operation by investigators who employed confidential informants. Several marijuana purchases were made before the warrants were secured. Rangers from both the Wawona and Valley Districts assisted in the execution of the warrants.

One of the truck's tanks ruptured and spilled about 75 gallons of diesel fuel. Most of the spill was cleaned up with pads by park and concession staff, and a prescribed burn was employed to remove the remaining residue. The spill occurred away from the Merced River, so there was probably no contamination of the river. [CompuServe report from RAD/WRO, 10/23]\n\nFriday, May 1, 1992\n\n92-158 - Yosemite (California) - Structural Fire\n\nYosemite dispatch received a 911 call from a visitor in the Wawona area reporting a rental cabin on fire early on the afternoon of April 28th. Responding park personnel found the structure fully involved, with the fire spreading to a pickup truck and surrounding trees. A nearby residence was protected, an adjacent propane tank was successfully cooled down, and the fire was kept from spreading. Caustic fumes from the burning vehicle and hazardous live power lines provided additional concerns during suppression efforts. The cabin occupants were able to exit the cabin safely, but the husband and a park employee living next to the structure were treated and released on scene for smoke inhalation. The cabin, which is valued at $175,000, is a total loss, as was the $22,000, three-day-old pickup. The cause of the fire is under investigation by Yosemite investigators and the California fire marshall's office.

A.G. was hiking with three companions on the trail to Vernal and Nevada Falls. When A.G. reached the Vernal Fall footbridge, he jumped over the bridge railing to a rock, then slipped and fell into the river. Approximately 20 people were involved in the search for him, including foot searchers on each side of the river, medics and personnel equipped for whitewater rescue. A.G. was found a quarter-mile downstream from the footbridge later that morning. Medics attempted to resuscitate him, but were unsuccessful. This is the first water-related fatality in Yosemite this year; last year, eight such fatalities occurred in the park.

Jacobi was able to find the victim, 28-year-old C.H. of Colin, California, and provide him with medical assistance for a severe head laceration and multiple fractures. During his evaluation of C.H., Jacobi determined that he was probably a BASE jumper, though no parachute was found in the area to confirm this. C.H. was transported to El Capitan Meadow by a carry-out team, then transported by helicopter to Modesto. C.H. later told Marsh that he had experienced some type of parachute failure after jumping off El Capitan. The park prosecutor is reviewing the possibility of filing criminal charges against C.H.

V.I. was knocked unconscious and pinned inside the cab; J.L. was able to escape with minor injuries. As first responders arrived, the vehicle engine compartment caught fire and spread rapidly. Dry chemical fire extinguishers slowed but did not stop the spread of the fire. Efforts were made to free V.I., but the fire drove rescuers back until fire trucks arrived and extinguished the blaze. V.I. continued to breath for about ten minutes after rescuers reached him, but CPR efforts were eventually halted and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ranger Eric Gabriel and SAR team member Dan McDevitt climbed in the dark and reached 24-year-old S.S., a concession employee, at about 1:30 a.m. S.S. had lost the trail he was following and had fallen 50 vertical feet and landed on the ledge where he was found. S.S. suffered a laceration of his right leg and numerous abrasions and contusions. Following a night on the ledge, rangers and Lemoore Naval Air Station personnel evacuated S.S. by helicopter hoist. S.S. was treated at Yosemite's clinic and released.
