        "text": "Emerging paceman Xavier Bartlett is thankful for Cricket Australia allowing him to play white-ball cricket for English side Kent, saying the experience has prepared him for next month’s T20 internationals against Scotland and England.\n\nThe 25-year-old Queensland fast bowler is part of a 14-man Australian squad that will play six T20 games – three against the Scots and three against England – from September 4 to 15.\n\nBartlett was recently in the UK playing for Kent in the T20 Blast competition.\n\nIt was an opportunity that threatened to be taken away from him after CA blocked Bartlett from playing for Kent in the County Championship due to concerns about a previous back injury and overloading him.\n\nHowever, Kent and CA came to an agreement which allowed Bartlett to play in some T20 Blast matches.\n\n“I was definitely grateful to get over there and play in some capacity,” Bartlett said from a national mini-camp in Brisbane on Monday.\n\n“Obviously, I would have loved to play some red-ball cricket, but with my injury history, I just looked after that, but I was really grateful to get over there and for the games that I was there,and get ready to go for this upcoming series.\n\n“I got a few T20 games over there, which was a great experience to get used to the English conditions … (which are) different to here, the different ground dimensions and all that sort of stuff.\n\n“Everyone says with the overhead conditions, (the ball) does swing (in the UK), but it’ll be great challenge over there.\n\n“The England white-ball team has been a really strong force over the last couple of years. I’m really looking forward to it.”\n\nBartlett starred for in the BBL last season for the title-winning Brisbane Heat, and was rewarded with debuts in Australia’s T20 and one-day international teams.\n\nHe was an instant hit, taking eight wickets in two ODIs and two wickets in sole T20 international – all against the West Indies.\n\n“It was a great experience. Playing my first series for Australia, and being in and around that environment was very surreal,” Bartlett said.\n\n“To get a few wickets here and there, and contribute to some wins was really pleasing,\n\n“The group’s been really welcoming, all the coaches and players. It’s a great environment. No wonder they’ve been so successful for so long.”\n\nHowever, Bartlett was not chosen in Australia’s squad for the five-match ODI series against England that follows the six T20 games.\n\n“The team at the moment, they’ve been so successful for such long period of time … but it’s definitely something I want to strive towards, to try to play cricket for Australia in all forms,” he said."
