They also have potential to mitigate climate change by acting as a store of carbon, and to furnish valuable woodfuel and carpentry timber. As such they command our attention. However, the longer-term historical development of native woodlands, over several millennia, has seen a steady decline in their extent and condition, through a combination of climate and soil deterioration and adverse human impacts – clearance for agriculture and development and exploitation for wood products at various times. Their extent has been reduced by around 90% since their post-glacial maximum, with only half of the surviving area believed to be in favourable ecological condition. The Forestry Commission, from its establishment in 1919, has had an important role to play in conservation and management of native woodlands in Scotland. Earlier attention focused on the Caledonian pinewoods, with Forestry Commission reserve and research areas established at Glenmore, Glen Loy and the Black Wood of Rannoch during the 1930s and 1940s. The publication of Steven and Carlisle’s famous book The Native Pinewoods of Scotland in 1959 encouraged further action by the Commission in pinewoods at Glen Affric, for example, and, from the 1970s onwards, action through grant aid to support native pinewood management on private estates. Over the past thirty years, since the ‘Broadleaves Policy’ of 1985, increased attention has been given to other types of native woodland such as the Atlantic oakwoods of the Trossachs, Argyll and Lochaber, riparian woodlands and, most recently, montane scrub above the plantation margin. Measures taken by the Commission, private landowners and charitable conservation organisations over the past half-century have arrested the decline in native woodland extent and begun the inevitably long-term processes of recovery in ecological condition and habitat restoration. However, new challenges arise from the possibility of climate change, the reality of novel tree pests and diseases in recent years and from the aspiration to realise more woodfuel, timber and income from woodlands. Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of the history, science and ecology of native woodlands in Scotland. Documentary and archival studies have\n\nForeword xiii\n\nclarified their history, as have pollen analytical techniques. Technical developments since 1990, such as those of the FC Ecological Site Classification (ESC), the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) and the concept of forest habitat networks (FHN), have been seminal. Most recently, the Native Woodland Survey of Scotland (NWSS), undertaken by Forestry Commission Scotland in partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage and partner organisations, has provided an unprecedentedly detailed ‘snapshot’ of the distribution, extent, composition and condition of the native woodland resource, with information outputs now available on an open-source basis. This new title by Dr Scott McG. Wilson integrates these existing sources of information into a convenient narrative reference volume which should prove valuable both to students and to practising land managers and foresters. The book benefits particularly from the author’s two decades of personal field experience visiting, surveying and ­photographing very many native woodlands across Scotland. Accordingly, I commend this new publication by Dr Scott McG. Wilson to all with an interest in native woodlands. In conjunction with the detailed information produced by the recent Native Woodland Survey of Scotland, it provides a sound basis from which to plan for the future conservation, expansion and utilisation of native woodland resources in Scotland.\n\nIntroduction\n\nObjectives and scope of the book Native woodlands are those comprising tree species that have colonised Scotland naturally since the end of the last Ice Age, 10–12,000 years bp. These include three conifers (Scots pine, yew and juniper) and some thirty broadleaves (Fife 1994; Herbert et al. 1999; Martynoga 2011; Smout et al. 2005). These now represent less than a quarter of Scotland’s tree cover at ~310,000ha or 4% of the Scottish land area (MacKenzie 1999; Forestry Commission Scotland 2014). Over half our native woodlands (or 2–3% of Scotland’s land area) are also regarded as being ‘semi-natural’ in that the trees have established naturally on their individual sites, without having been planted, although there may have been a history of management. It is estimated that native woodlands may once have covered 50–60% of Scotland’s land area (Smout et al. 2005). The importance of native woodlands to Scotland is increasingly recognised, not only for their well-established biodiversity and nature conservation values, but also for their amenity and recreational values in the Scottish landscape and their potential to supply ‘ecosystem services’ such as soil protection, flood mitigation and carbon sequestration. It is now expected that, with careful silvicultural management, native woodlands can also meet an important element of the nation’s future needs for timber products and woodfuel. This book aims to provide a comprehensive but approachable overview of the history, ecology and management of Scotland’s native woodlands. It is hoped that the level of coverage will meet the needs of three readerships: (1) those studying relevant subjects (including forestry, ecology, geography, environmental science and countryside management) up to undergraduate level, (2) those directly involved with management of Scottish native woodlands who do not come from a specialist professional background and (3) those with an informed amateur or recreational interest in Scottish native woodlands and wildlife more generally. The book is not primarily aimed at those with specialist training in woodland ecology, for whom many existing sources of detailed technical information are already available, including forestry textbooks and information bulletins issued by the Forestry Commission, Scottish Natural Heritage, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and so on. However, they may also find this book convenient as a summary or ‘ready-reference’ volume.\n\n2\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nChapter 1 sets the native woodlands of Scotland in their international forest context, with particular reference to Scandinavia, Continental Europe and North America. Chapter 2 deals with their ecological context within the Scottish landscape – aspects of climate, elevation, geology, soils and adjoining open-land vegetation communities such as moorland and heathland. Chapter 3 summarises current understandings of the historical and ecological development of Scottish native woodlands from before the last Ice Age until the present time. This covers some controversial aspects of the subject, including the ongoing debate as to the ecological role of large herbivores in prehistory, the balance between climatic and human factors in native woodland decline and the timescales for that decline. There then follow four chapters dealing with the major types of native woodland found in Scotland: native pinewoods, oak-birch woodlands, ash-elm-hazel woodlands and, finally, the wet woodlands of alder and willow. The smaller remnants of lowland mixed deciduous woodland in Scotland, often having a wood-pasture or parkland structure, are included with the oak-birch woodlands for convenience, although some have greater affinities with lowland oak-ash woodlands in southern and eastern England. Juniper woodlands and montane juniper-willow scrub are both dealt with in association with the native pinewoods, aspen stands with the oak-birch woodlands. Chapters 8, 9 and 10 deal respectively with the conservation and management of existing native woodlands, expansion of the native woodland resource and relationships between native woodlands and plantation forests. The last are of significance due to the greater extent of the plantation forests, their developing ecological and reproductive maturity and current predictions for environmental change within which both native woodlands and plantation forests will have to co-evolve. Chapter 11 presents some ideas on the likely future development of native woodlands in Scotland, taking account of predicted climatic change, novel pests and diseases and changing economic influences. For those wishing to visit native woodlands in Scotland, Chapter 12 provides a gazetteer of interesting woodland sites that can be visited on foot under current Scottish countryside access legislation. These selected locations are intended to best illustrate major ecological types of native woodland and particular approaches to their ­conservation and management.\n\nEarlier publications on Scottish native woodland By comparison with the ecological literature for England, especially lowland England, Scottish native woodlands remain relatively under-reported. This is largely due to the longer history of botanical recording in the English lowlands, coupled with a greater volume of historical sources – the Domesday Book, court rolls and so on. As a result, certain key concepts in native woodland ecology, such as use of ancient woodland indicator species and recognition of the significance of coppicing and pollarding (Peterken 1993; Rackham 1990, 2003), were less well resolved with reference to the Scottish native woodlands. Recent years have, however, seen important advances in these areas, together with considerable attention to historical and cultural landscape dimensions, including the importance of upland wood pasture in\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nScotland (Smout 1997, 2003; Smout et al. 2005). In addition, scientific approaches from the North American and Scandinavian literature, including site classification, island ­biogeography theory and stand dynamics (MacArthur and Wilson 1967; Oliver and Larson 1996; Pyatt et al. 2001), have been increasingly applied to native ­woodland ­complexes in Scotland, particularly those within the Cairngorms National Park. To date, there have been few attempts to produce comprehensive guides to the native woodlands of Scotland – for example, there is no Scottish equivalent of Oliver Rackham’s classic Ancient Woodland (2003). The closest approach to this remains Steven and Carlisle’s The Native Pinewoods of Scotland, first published in 1959. Although that dealt mainly with the native pinewoods, there were also valuable descriptions of associated native woodland habitats, particularly the upland birch woodlands. In recent years, Clifton Bain of the RSPB has revisited the pinewoods by bicycle to update Steven and Carlisle’s impressions, with outcomes reported in Bain (2013). Many other volumes on this subject have taken a primarily historical approach, inspired by Mark Anderson’s A History of Scottish Forestry, published posthumously (Anderson 1967), which did provide considerable commentary on past ecological development of our native woodlands. Some of Anderson’s perspectives are now becoming rather dated in the light of subsequent research findings, particularly in palynology (fossil pollen studies) (H. J. B. Birks 1989; Tipping 1994). More recently, Professor Chris Smout and co-authors (Smout 1997, 2003; Smout et al. 2005) have improved our understandings of documented Scottish woodland history with reference to specific regions, including Badenoch and Strathspey, Breadalbane, Argyll, Lochaber, the Loch Lomond oakwoods and so on. Scottish native woodland types have been dealt with to some extent by noted English-based woodland ecologists such as Oliver Rackham, George Peterken and John Rodwell (Peterken 1993; Rackham 1990, 2003; Rodwell 1991a), but there has continued to be a perception, rightly or wrongly, that they have received lesser emphasis in field sampling work and that they are therefore not always satisfactorily described by resulting woodland classification schemes. A particular issue has been the need to distinguish the semipermanent birch and aspen woodlands of upland Scotland (Worrell 1995, 1999) from the more transient birch woodlands occurring in England and Wales. In recent years there have been a number of illustrated publications by the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage dealing with conservation management and expansion of specific native woodland types (Forestry Commission 2003) that have been assigned priority conservation status. Of particular value for woodland managers are the updated Forestry Commission companion guides Managing the Pinewoods of Scotland (Mason et al. 2004) and Managing Native Broadleaved Woodland (Harmer et al. 2010). These complement earlier Forestry Commission bulletins such as Evans (1984), which tended to adopt a more ‘production-oriented’ approach to silvicultural practice in broadleaved plantations. Finally, there have been several ‘coffee-table’ style books (e.g. Miles and Jackman 1991) adopting a photographic approach, usually highlighting charismatic veteran trees and wildlife species, but sometimes suffering from historical inconsistencies.\n\n4\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nConservation status of Scottish native woodland While commentaries on the declining extent and condition of native woodland resources in Scotland were recorded from the fifteenth century onwards (Smout et al. 2005), it was not until the early twentieth century that professional attention was devoted to their conservation. Field visits to Scotland by eminent British and Continental European forest ecologists between the wars indicated native pinewood stands and acid Atlantic oak woodlands to be of particular botanical interest (Tansley 1939). Pinewoods at the Black Wood of Rannoch, Glenmore and Glen Loy were acquired by the Forestry Commission prior to the Second World War and thereafter managed to an extent as ‘forest reserves’. After the war, the establishment of the Nature Conservancy (later to become Scottish Natural Heritage) saw declaration of further National Nature Reserves within native pinewoods including, most notably, Beinn Eighe in Wester Ross (Laughton Johnston and Balharry 2001). Some of these areas had sustained heavy fellings as part of the wartime timber supply effort. Recognition also increased for the Atlantic oakwood ecosystems of the west coast, with declaration of reserves, for example, at the Ariundle and Taynish Oakwoods, and similarly for the upland ash woodlands, as at Rassal. Many reserves were managed essentially on a ‘non-intervention’ basis, while others were the setting for early experiments in ecological restoration, particularly the native pinewoods at Beinn Eighe (Laughton Johnston and Balharry 2001). Many less prominent native woodlands also acquired some measure of recognition and, after 1981, protection as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). These approaches to conservation, based on reservation and protection of ‘special sites’, were inspired by earlier experiences within the wilderness and wildlife conservation movements of the United States and the British colonies. However, most native woodland remnants in Scotland, throughout this period, remained under the ownership of either the Forestry Commission, whose main purpose was coniferous afforestation, or private landowners, whose main interest was livestock production or the fostering of red deer and grouse for sport shooting. As such, many native woodlands continued to be subject to adverse impacts from over-grazing by sheep and deer (Fraser Darling 1955) or were converted to coniferous plantations. The postwar decades saw continued losses of native woodland cover in Scotland to alternative land-uses, particularly plantation forestry. Although those may not have represented such a significant fraction of the resource as was lost to agriculture and development in England, it became clear that action was needed to ensure their continued survival. In particular, it became essential to conserve native woodlands less as ‘island reserves’ and more as robust and functional ecological systems at the landscape scale, inevitably traversing ownership and management boundaries. Many would date the current raised profile of native woodland conservation in Scotland to the publication in 1959 of Steven and Carlisle’s The Native Pinewoods of Scotland. At an international level, this pioneering book represented one of the earlier attempts to promote research and active conservation within a particular natural forest ecosystem. Again, it was perhaps inspired by conservation experiences overseas, for example in the Californian redwood forests and the Western Ghats in\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nBritish India. The relatively small extent and number of the native pinewood remnants allowed Steven and Carlisle to adopt a site-specific inventory approach, rarely feasible elsewhere. Each site was described in systematic detail, with mapping and some photography. While their book focuses mainly on the pinewoods themselves, it does place these firmly within the context of the wider Scottish native woodland spectrum, including, particularly, adjoining upland birch woodlands. Other influential Scottish publications of the post-war years, such as those by Frank Fraser Darling (1947, 1955), highlighted the extent to which past climatic and human influences had led to decline of the various native woodland types in the wider Scottish landscape over preceding millennia. McVean and Ratcliffe in the early 1960s made valuable proposals, together with predictive mapping, as to those native woodland types that should naturally occur across the country, based on evidence from existing remnants, climate, elevation and soils (McVean and Ratcliffe 1962). The establishment of the Native Woodlands Discussion Group (NWDG) in 1974, followed by a major native pinewood conference held at Aviemore in 1975 (Aldhous 1995), were early signs that the emphasis was shifting from ‘passive preservation’ of existing Scottish native woodland remnants towards the active conservation and landscape-scale expansion of Scottish native woodlands as functioning, inter-connected ecosystems. The last two decades have seen increasing levels of activity in the study, conservation and expansion of native woodlands in Scotland. A major stimulus for this was the 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), under which governments committed to the protection and enhancement of biodiversity at the habitat, species and genetic levels. This led to the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (Department of the Environment 1994) under which the main Scottish native woodland types became subject to Habitat Action Plans (HAPs) and several animal and plant species depending upon these became subject to Species Action Plans (SAPs). Such plans provided a more robust policy basis for public funding of their conservation and expansion. Changes in forestry policy from the mid-1980s onwards (Forestry Commission 1985) had already justified the provision of public-sector financial support for establishment of new woodlands composed of native tree species and for improved management of the existing native woodland remnants. Initially, activity focused on the higherprofile native pinewoods, but more recently a range of other woodland types have been emphasised, including Atlantic oak woodlands, upland birch-aspen woodlands, ash-elm-hazel woodlands and riparian wet woodlands. The recently completed Native Woodland Survey of Scotland (NWSS) (Nelson 2010; Forestry Commission Scotland 2014) provides an extremely valuable update on the current extent, distribution and condition of Scotland’s native woodlands.\n\nScientific advances Important advances in the science of Scottish native woodlands during this period have included (1) development of more detailed schemes for habitat classification of remnant native woodlands, including the Peterken stand-type classification (Peterken 1993) and the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) (Rodwell 1991a),\n\n6\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nand (2) development of computer-based predictive modelling tools, including the Ecological Site Classification (ESC) (Pyatt et al. 2001) and the Macaulay Institute Native Woodland Model (NWM) (Towers et al. 2004), aimed at defining the most appropriate native woodland communities for targeted ecological restoration on specific sites. These approaches developed upon the basic framework for Scottish native woodland potential set out by McVean and Ratcliffe (1962). Much work conducted in connection with Scottish native woodlands today forms part of the wider agenda of ‘restoration ecology’ (Humphrey et al. 2003; van Andel and Aronson 2012), which is also being applied to upland open habitats such as moorland and heathland and to wetland and riparian ecosystems. Techniques for the establishment of new native woodlands by planting and natural colonisation have been developed in practice over recent years, but not all have been successful and this remains an important area of ‘work in progress’. A natural tendency among nature conservation managers to adopt cautious, low-impact methods has frequently proved over-optimistic, and more interventionist forestry methods are sometimes still essential. On the other hand, realistic timescales for native woodland restoration are often much longer than can be readily accommodated within ‘target-driven’ public-funding mechanisms, and this can pose serious challenges for those seeking to adhere to fundamental ecological principles within financially sustainable woodland restoration work. Having said that, as we enter the new millennium, remnant native woodlands in Scotland are probably in the best ecological condition that they have been in for at least the past century. While new challenges from climate change, pest and disease incidence and rising demands for timber and woodfuel are now emerging, there is a sounder platform of knowledge from which to evolve sustainable management models specific to the Scottish native woodland resource. Of particular significance will be the developing interrelationships between native woodlands and more extensive plantation forests created in Scotland over the past 300 years. While plantation forestry has often been seen as an alternative, and sometimes conflicting, land-use to native woodland conservation, the likelihood is that the future will see increasing convergence and intermingling of productive woodland types, as these expand as an element of the overall Scottish land cover.\n\nOwnership and management of native woodland Alongside the increasing pace of native woodland research, conservation and expansion activity described above, the last two decades have also seen important changes in ownership and management patterns for the Scottish native woodland resource. New categories of ownership have emerged during this period, including the advent of large-scale land ownership by conservation charities/NGOs in the Scottish uplands and smaller-scale woodland ownership by local communities and private individuals. By contrast with the previously dominant major public- and private-sector owners – the Forestry Commission and the large sporting and agricultural estates – native woodland is often now the reason for ownership and the focus of ownership attention. This has brought benefits: a greater diversity of management approaches, greater\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nemphasis on the conservation significance of native woodlands, and, in some cases, access to additional sources of funding and personnel to support native woodland management and expansion. On the other hand, there have been less desirable trends towards extensive woodland management with inadequate field input by relevant specialists, and greater day-to-day reliance on non-specialist desk-based managerial staff. A major objective of this book is to make available to these interested, but nonspecialist, woodland managers a single source of information on the subject of native woodland in Scotland to which they can refer for background information. While it inevitably represents a summary of the knowledge available in many key areas, it is hoped that those with more detailed information requirements will find a starting point within these pages, leading them on to further readings wherever required.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nInternational context 1.1 Overview Native woodlands in Scotland do not exist in isolation – they form part of extensive natural forest ecosystems or ‘biomes’ occurring across continents. This chapter sets the native woodlands of Scotland within their international forestry context, and explains how their relationships with major forest biomes have influenced their formation and development. For a territory of relatively small geographical extent, Scotland is unusual in possessing native woodland types that represent at least two, and arguably three, major forest biomes. The majority of Scottish native broadleaved woodlands – those of oak, ash, elm, hazel and alder – form part of the temperate deciduous forest biome (Peterken 1996; Rohrig and Ulrich 1991), which extends throughout the British Isles and most parts of western Europe north of the Alps, including southern parts of Scandinavia. There are similar forests in parts of eastern North America and the far east of Asia – China, Japan and Korea. These forests are adapted to deal with a seasonal climate by shedding their leaves in the autumn and growing a new set in spring. The native pinewoods, together with closely associated birch, aspen and juniper woodlands, form part of the boreal forest biome (Andersson 2005), which extends eastwards across central and northern parts of Scandinavia and Russia, before resuming across Alaska and Canada. The dominant tree species in the boreal forests are evergreen conifers, such as pines, which are adapted to deal with severe winter conditions. Although their leaves are retained, tree growth is negligible in winter due to low temperatures and limited sunlight at high latitudes. Some native woodlands along the western seaboard of Scotland have affinities to the European temperate evergreen forest biome (Ovington 1983) also occurring in parts of Ireland, Portugal and Spain – these are ‘oceanic’ forests where winters are milder and trees do not need to shed their leaves, but instead can keep growing all year round. Atlantic oakwoods, where evergreen holly is common in the understorey, naturally have common features with this biome, and that has been accentuated by recent introductions of Rhododendron from Eurasia and a range of evergreen conifers from the equivalent temperate evergreen forests found on the Pacific coast of North America (Orians and Schoen 2013).\n\nInternational context 9\n\n1.2 Links with native woodlands in England and Wales There is little surprise that strong similarities are to be found between the native woodlands of Scotland and those of England and Wales, our closest neighbouring territories. This applies mainly to the broadleaved native woodland types, as Scots pine forest is not believed to have occurred naturally in England and Wales for many thousands of years (although in some areas there are very old Scots pine plantations). Native broadleaved woodland types found in upland Scotland – acid oak-birch woodlands and more fertile ash-elm-hazel woodlands – occur in similar upland areas of Wales and northern and south-western England, similarly with the wet alder-willow woodland types of river valleys and fens, found throughout the British Isles. There are fewer persistent examples to be found in England and Wales of upland birch-aspen-rowan and juniper scrub woodland types – these, together with the native pinewoods, appear to be particular features of Scotland’s closer links with the Scandinavian boreal forests. In woodlands in the milder upland climates of England and Wales, these species are often outcompeted over time by oak, ash, hazel and other broadleaved trees. Lowland England, and more southern and eastern parts of Wales, support mixed deciduous woodlands dominated by oak and ash, naturally having an understorey of hazel and/or field maple. In the past, many such woodlands would also have had a significant elm component. There are also native woodlands of lime and hornbeam in some parts of south-east England and East Anglia, reflecting forest types found in warmer lowland areas of Continental Europe (Linnard 2000; Peterken 1993; Rackham 2003; Rodwell 1991a). Many of these lowland woodlands have been heavily modified by past forestry management for oak and ash timber, the coppicing of understorey species such as hazel and field maple, and the planting of non-native tree species including beech, sycamore, sweet chestnut and conifers. However, there remain isolated examples in a ‘nearer-to-nature’ condition, such as the New Forest (Peterken 1993, 1996). Historically, similar lowland oak-ash-elm woodlands also occurred extensively in central and eastern Scotland, particularly within the Central Belt and the Tay, Clyde and Forth Valleys. However, most of these were removed long since, when the fertile land on which they once stood was converted to agricultural production or urban development. There are some surviving remnants of these woodland types, many in the form of ancient wood pastures and parklands, deliberately maintained around medieval castle sites, such as at Cadzow, near Glasgow, and Dalkeith, near Edinburgh (Smout et al. 2005). Oak is the dominant tree species today, with ash and elm occurring locally.\n\n1.3 Links with natural forests of Continental Europe The native woodlands found in Scotland are, to a large extent, north-western oceanic outliers of the major temperate deciduous forest types found throughout mainland Europe, ranging between the Alps/Pyrenees and southern Scandinavia (see Plate 1). Similar forests are found in other parts of the world with a seasonal climate, but\n\n10\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nwhere winter conditions are not excessively cold and summer conditions are not so dry as to cause trees to stop growing during a typical year. Other major temperate deciduous forest areas are the eastern United States (the Appalachian and New England forests) and those found in mid-latitude parts of eastern Asia (China, Japan, southern Korea). There are smaller areas of forests of similar type in New Zealand and Chile. The acid oakwoods of the Atlantic coast and Highland margins in Scotland resemble similar oak-dominated woodlands occurring on acidic soils in parts of southern Sweden and Norway, Ireland, Brittany and north-western Spain. The more lowland oakwoods on moderately fertile sites in Scotland, with bluebell and bracken, are similar to those of west-central France. The upland ash-elm-hazel woodlands of Scotland have similarities to those occurring in river valleys and on limestone soils in montane areas such as the Vosges and Jura in eastern France, the foothills of the Pyrenees in south-western France and parts of northern Italy. Some phases of temperate deciduous woodland vegetation in Scotland, notably the Atlantic hazel woodlands, are not found widely elsewhere. The native pinewoods of Scotland, although having stronger links to the boreal pine forests of Scandinavia, also have ecological similarities to the montane and sub-alpine pine forests of the Massif Central in France and the central mountains of Spain. Those are coniferous forests which occur as ‘inliers’ within the temperate deciduous forest biome, due to colder climates at higher elevations. They are also in some senses ‘outliers’ from the boreal forests further north in Scandinavia. Due to the compression of altitudinal ranges close to the Atlantic Ocean, the native pinewoods can occur at much lower elevations than montane Scots pine forests in mainland Europe. Genetic studies have shown that some of the native pinewoods, especially those near sea level in the far north-west Highlands, may be more closely related to the montane Scots pine populations of central France and Spain than to those of the Scandinavian boreal pine forests (Aldhous 1995; Forrest 1992). The same is likely to have been true of the Scots pine once found naturally in Ireland, which, it is conventionally believed, became extinct at least a thousand years ago. The genetics of Scots pine will be discussed in more detail in Chapters 3 and 4, in connection with the development of native woodlands in Scotland before, during and after the last Ice Age. There are certain important natural forest types found in Continental Europe that are not represented naturally within Scotland – these include the classic beech, spruce and silver fir forests of the montane and sub-alpine areas, rich valley woodlands of lime and sycamore and the lowland forests on heavy soils of the European Plain, dominated by lime and hornbeam (see Table 1.1). These will be discussed later within the present chapter.\n\n1.4 Links with Scandinavian and Russian boreal forests Although we have seen that the strongest ecological links of Scotland’s broadleaved native woodlands are to the temperate deciduous forests of England, Wales and Continental Europe, the native pinewoods have equally strong ecological connections to the boreal forests of Scandinavia. The boreal forest biome is the most extensive in\n\nInternational context 11\n\nTable 1.1 Typical altitudinal zonation of forests in central Europe. Partly after Jahn, in Rohrig and Ulrich (1991).\n\nthe world and stretches in a belt around the northern hemisphere between the northern limit of the temperate deciduous forests and the southern limit of the Arctic tundra. There are no boreal forests in the southern hemisphere as the continental landmasses of South America, Southern Africa and Australasia are further from the pole. Boreal forests are composed of a relatively small number of hardy tree genera (families of related species) that can withstand cold climates, including pines, spruces, larches, birches, rowan and aspen. The exact species occurring vary between the boreal forests of the Eurasian landmass (Scandinavia and Russia) and those of the North American landmass (Alaska, Canada and northern parts of the United States), but the structure of these forests is very similar. In Scandinavia and western Russia, the boreal forest is divided into ‘light forest’ communities, dominated by Scots pine, birch, rowan and aspen, and ‘dark forest’ communities, dominated by Norway spruce with smaller components of other conifers (Andersson 2005). ‘Light forest’ tends to dominate on infertile, freely draining soils (see Plate 6), whereas ‘dark forest’ develops over time by colonisation of Norway spruce onto sites with richer, moister soils. The native pinewoods are western oceanic outliers of the ‘light forest’ types found in western Norway and southern Sweden, but tend to have more broadleaved species such as birch, alder, rowan and aspen. Some ecologists therefore regard them as being a transitional type, known as ‘hemi-boreal’ (meaning half-boreal) forests.\n\n12\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nAnother difference between Scottish native pinewoods and the ‘true’ Scandinavian boreal forests relates to the role of fire in stimulating natural regeneration. Only the drier, eastern native pinewoods in Scotland, such as those of Deeside and Speyside, experience such natural fires regularly. The western pinewoods, with higher rainfall and thicker ground vegetation, regenerate mainly by the formation of occasional gaps by windthrow – a feature more comparable to the montane pine forests further south in mainland Europe. A considerable number of the wildlife species that still occur in northern Scandinavian boreal forests became extinct in Scotland before the end of the last Ice Age (e.g. wolverine) or have become extinct in more recent millennia due to habitat loss and hunting pressure (reindeer, brown bear, lynx, wolf, beaver) (Yalden 2002). This means that, in biodiversity terms, native pinewoods in Scotland represent a depauperate (depleted) oceanic outlier of the boreal forests of Scandinavia and Russia.\n\n1.5 Links with North American natural forests Native woodlands in Scotland share many tree genera with natural forests, not only in Eurasia, but also in North America. These include pine, oak, ash, elm, birch and aspen, occurring in both the boreal and temperate deciduous forests of North America. However, there are different species representing each of these genera on either side of the Atlantic and important differences in the way that the structure of these forests has developed. In eastern North America there is a better developed ecological transition zone or ‘ecotone’ between the boreal and temperate deciduous forest biomes than in Europe, where the Baltic Sea ‘masks’ the transition from one biome to the other. The area around the Great Lakes and in northern New England is dominated by the ‘northern mixedwoods’ (Byrd Davis 1996), where elements of the boreal and temperate deciduous forest biomes merge together. In some ways this is comparable to the ‘contact zone’ between the native pinewoods and the broadleaved native woodlands in Scotland. Further east in Russia, and further west in North America, the drier continental climates prevent the widespread development of temperate deciduous forests, and the southern boundary of the boreal forest is marked by a transition to steppe grasslands. Another important ecological relationship between the forests of Scotland and those of North America relates to the temperate evergreen forests of the Pacific Northwest (northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia). Although the two territories share no individual tree species naturally, they do share a very similar climate. For that reason, foresters in Scotland have been interested to introduce many of the highly productive conifer species found in the Pacific Northwest, including Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, redwood, western hemlock, western red cedar, grand fir, Pacific silver fir and noble fir (Macdonald et al. 1957; Wilson 2011b; Wood 1955). These introduced tree species grow more quickly than the native species found in similar climates within Scotland, such as Scots pine, oak and ash, and some can be grown in wet, exposed areas of western Scotland that native tree species cannot utilise (Anderson 1961). Hence, many plantation forests in Scotland\n\nInternational context 13\n\ntoday, having been created over the past 150 years, are composed of ‘exotic’ species from North America.\n\n1.6 Links with European temperate evergreen forests We have seen that the two main forest biomes to which native woodlands in Scotland belong are the temperate deciduous forests and the boreal forests. However, some of the broadleaved native woodlands along the west coast of Scotland, although dominated by oak, also contain a large amount of the evergreen holly in the understorey. This represents a transition to a third forest biome – the temperate evergreen forests (Ovington 1983). Forests of this type develop in areas where the winter is sufficiently mild that some trees can keep growing without risk of frost damage, and hence benefit from retaining their leaves all year round. Because of the oceanic influence, these forests do not experience significant summer droughts, and as a result there is no need for a dry season growth pause. Temperate evergreen forests can be composed mainly of conifers, as in the Pacific Northwest of North America and north-west Morocco, or mainly of broadleaves, as in the Atlantic coastal forests of western Europe. Those in the southern hemisphere, mainly in Chile and New Zealand, tend to be more mixed. As we will see in Chapter 3, the examples of temperate evergreen forests found along the western edges of Europe are in effect remnants of more extensive areas of this ecosystem which existed before the series of glaciations that have occurred over the past two million years. In the far south-west of Ireland, around Killarney, native oak woodlands are found with much holly as in western Scotland, but also naturally occurring yew and strawberry tree (an evergreen broadleaf) (Cross 2012; Tansley 1939) – two other species typical of the European temperate evergreen forests. Yew occurs locally in Scottish woodlands of this type (for example in Glen Etive and at Loch Lomond) but is held by some authors to be an ancient introduction (Dickson 1993). Similar woodlands are found in western Wales, Cornwall and Brittany, although lacking strawberry tree. In north-west Spain and Portugal, we find similar Atlantic oak woodlands (Rohrig and Ulrich 1991), but here with naturally occurring strawberry tree and Rhododendron. Some ecologists therefore recognise a type of west-coast temperate vegetation that they term ‘Hiberno-Lusitanian’ (meaning Irish-Spanish). Although not native in Scotland, Ireland, Wales or Cornwall since the last Ice Age, Rhododendron has been very widely planted in west-coast gardens in these regions over the past 150 years, and has spread outwards into some adjoining native oak woodlands. This has effectively increased representation of the temperate evergreen forest biome, and that is probably also being encouraged by changes in the climate of western Britain towards a milder, wetter oceanic regime (Ray 2008). As was mentioned earlier in this chapter, foresters in Scotland have tended to favour introduced conifer species, particularly Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which originate from the temperate evergreen forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America. As these species mature, and reproduce from seed, they are contributing to the expansion of temperate evergreen forest ­vegetation in western Scotland.\n\n14\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\n1.7 Tree species and forest types missing from Scotland So far as we know, there have been no extinctions of tree species in Scotland since the last Ice Age. There are, however, several tree species that failed to recolonise Scotland naturally after the last Ice Age, when they might have been expected to. Some of these species did, however, manage to recolonise southern Britain before the English Channel was flooded by global sea-level rise, fed by glacial meltwaters, 7,000–8,000 years bp. Others have arrived since, with varying degrees of human assistance. Lime-hornbeam woodland occurs naturally in some lowland parts of south-east England, and may have been more abundant before human modification of woodlands began seriously, 5,000–6,000 years bp. Lime still occurs naturally as far north as the Lake District on limestone soils, but not into Scotland. Field maple occurs widely in southern England and Wales, but not in Scotland (Peterken 1993; Rackham 1990, 2003; Rodwell 1991a). In the case of beech, there is some uncertainty as to when actual recolonisation was accomplished, either naturally before opening of the English Channel, or afterwards with assistance from prehistoric human settlers, who might have brought beech seed (known as ‘mast’) to feed their livestock during their first winter in Britain. The species certainly did not become abundant until 4,000–5,000 years bp. Natural beech woodlands occur in many parts of southern England, especially on chalk and limestone hills such as the Chilterns, South Downs and Cotswolds (Wilson 2010). Sycamore, although possibly introduced at an earlier date, has become widespread only since the 1500s as a result of planting and natural colonisation. While lime, hornbeam and field maple may not be climatically suited to Scotland, due to lack of summer warmth required for reproduction (Piggott and Huntley 1978), there is little doubt that beech and sycamore woodlands could have developed quickly in many parts of Scotland had these species been able to colonise northwards naturally after reaching southern Britain. It is believed that beech was only prevented from doing so, over the past 3,000 to 4,000 years, by human clearance of woodlands for agriculture. Beech and sycamore are shade-tolerant tree species, allowing their seedlings to establish themselves under the canopy of existing native woodlands, eventually becoming dominant as older individuals (e.g. of oak or ash) die naturally. This happens today where beech or sycamore seeds into oak woodlands from nearby planted trees. Beech and sycamore have been introduced to Scotland over the past 400–500 years (Smout et al. 2005) and have become important, ­probably permanent, elements of many otherwise ‘native’ broadleaved woodlands. There are also a number of tree species, absent from Britain as a whole since the last Ice Age, which occur naturally in Continental Europe. The most important of these are Norway spruce, European larch and European silver fir, all of which are believed to have occurred in Britain during Pleistocene interglacials (West 1970, 1980). These species have been deliberately introduced, or perhaps we should say ‘reintroduced’, to Britain over the past 300–400 years, but are still regarded by most ecologists as ‘exotic’ species. The same applies to Rhododendron, which was apparently present in the British Isles during previous warmer interglacial periods.\n\nInternational context 15\n\nFinally there are a range of tree genera (families of species) that have become extinct from Europe as a result of the series of glaciations over the past two million years, but which are still found today in various parts of America and Asia, and which have been introduced by ‘plant hunters’ and foresters over the past 200 years. This is certainly true of the genus Tsuga, represented today by the common forestry species western hemlock (West 1980). Other coniferous genera, now restricted to North America and Eastern Asia, will also once have occurred in Europe (Mai 1989).\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nEcological context 2.1 Overview In order to fully understand the different types of native woodland that occur within Scotland, it is essential to see how they fit into the wider ecology of the Scottish landscape. This chapter will present information in four main areas: (1) how climate and elevation affect the development of native woodlands; (2) how geology and soils act as ‘mediating factors’, influencing how native woodlands develop locally within any particular regional climate; (3) how native woodlands relate to adjoining openland habitats; and (4) classification and description of the different types of native woodland found in Scotland. As well as providing a framework within which to consider native woodlands at the landscape scale, it is also intended that this chapter should allow the reader to take any individual native woodland site with which they are involved and place it within the wider context in terms of its environment and species composition.\n\n2.2 The influences of climate and elevation Climatic factors are the most important natural determinants of native woodland distribution in Scotland and affect both the structure and species composition of the woodlands themselves. Although a large fraction of the original native woodland cover of Scotland has been removed or modified by past human activities, we can still see clearly the effects of climate when we examine the spatial and altitudinal distribution and structure of surviving native woodland remnants in Scotland. Climatic factors also have a very powerful influence on the feasibility and progress of native woodland restoration and expansion efforts. Current concerns over predicted climate change also highlight the need to have a good understanding of the climatic requirements and tolerances of Scotland’s native woodland types. Climate affects the development of native woodlands in a number of ways (Kimmins 1997), the most important of which are: • • • •\n\nprovision of warmth required for plant growth provision of moisture required for plant growth regulation of light required for plant growth risk of damage to vegetation from extremes of heat or cold\n\nEcological context 17 • risk of damage to vegetation from strong winds and flood events • effects on the prevalence and impacts of insects, fungi and bacteria.\n\nPlants, including trees, need sufficient warmth, moisture, soil nutrition and light to survive and to grow by means of photosynthesis, fixing atmospheric carbon to form their vegetative tissues. Most plants can withstand, by means of a growth pause, regular seasons or occasional episodes when these factors become insufficient for growth. However, the average annual climate must be adequate to allow for positive net growth. Different tree and plant species have different requirements in terms of each of these major variables, and this is the main mechanism by which the climate of any area will determine the species composition of native woodlands. For example, Scots pine has much lower requirements in terms of warmth than does ash, and hence native pinewoods tend to occupy colder sites than upland ash woodlands. Few plants will continue positive growth when the temperature falls below 5oC, and so only days when this temperature is exceeded can be counted as part of the growing season (Pyatt et al. 2001). Similarly, the amount of growth that can be achieved is regulated by the supply of light of the correct wavelengths to power photosynthesis (known as ‘photosynthetically active radiation’ or PAR) (Kimmins 1997). Hence the further north one travels, the shorter the growing season becomes regardless of summer warmth and day length. The climate of Scotland is generally regarded as a cool moist or cool temperate one, with a very strong moderating influence from the Atlantic Ocean. Climatic moisture supply is, therefore, rarely a limiting factor on tree growth at present, although there is a distinct climatic gradient between the wetter oceanic conditions of the west coast and the drier, more continental conditions of the east coast (over a relatively short distance of ~300km). This is sufficient to influence the structure and development of native woodlands on either side of the Scottish Highland mountains, and to result in local ecological adaptation within tree populations across the country. It may also have significance for the regional impacts of predicted climate change (Ray 2008). Excessive rainfall, especially if concentrated in very intensive episodes, can become a limiting factor on tree growth through the mechanisms of flooding, landslips and soil erosion. While these are rather localised and infrequent events in Scotland at the present time, they may become much more of a problem in the west under future climate scenarios. By comparison, climatic warmth can be a much more significant limiting factor on tree growth, especially at higher elevations in Scotland. Although the overall winter climate of Scotland is much milder than that of boreal forest regions of Scandinavia and Russia, or within alpine conifer forests of mainland Europe, there is a very strong dependence on altitude, with harsher ‘Arctic-Alpine’ climatic conditions experienced over the hills and mountains. This tends to establish a natural ‘treeline’ in Scotland (an upper limit for woodland development) usually between 450m and 650m above sea level (asl), depending locally upon latitude, slope aspect and exposure. This is a much lower limit than would apply in the Alps, for example, where forests extend up to 2,000–3,000m altitude. The main reason for this difference is the very high average\n\n18\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nwind speeds encountered in Scotland, which accentuate the thermal limitations on tree growth through an exposure or ‘wind-chilling’ effect. Strong winds can also cause mechanical damage to woodland vegetation, and where that is sufficiently frequent or severe, they have the effect of depressing the natural treeline to lower altitudes, especially on slopes more exposed to the prevailing south-westerly winds. In extreme cases, the treeline can be depressed to near sea level, and trees exposed to very severe wind regimes tend to adopt a stunted and misshapen stem form in response. Below the natural treeline, climatic warmth and exposure continue to have marked effects on the structure and composition of the native woodlands that can develop. Light levels also vary between north- and south-facing slopes, due to the low angle of winter sunshine at northern latitudes (Scotland ranges from 55o to 59o North). This has local effects on warmth and growing-season length and can lead to different types of ­woodland developing on either face of glens running east to west. Below the natural treeline, native woodland structure and composition in Scotland is determined by a combination of climate, soils and anthropogenic factors. Soils will be discussed later in this chapter, while woodland history is the subject of Chapter 3. Climate and soils impose a basic structure of altitudinal bands of different types of native woodland. The way in which these are described and classified by ecologists is dealt with later in this chapter, as this is one of the key tools that native woodland managers use when studying existing native woodlands and planning their restoration. However, at a simplified level, a ‘typical’ hillside slope in the Highlands of Scotland naturally has the following woodland types (see Table 2.1): Upper slopes: Montane scrub woodland (juniper, dwarf birch and willow) Upper midslope: Native pinewood, with birch, aspen, rowan and juniper Midslope: Upland birch woodland (over blaeberry and heather) Lower midslope: Oak-birch woodland (over bracken, bramble and bluebell) Slope foot: Ash-elm-hazel woodland, often with some oak Valley bottom: Riparian ash-alder woodland and alder-willow woodland. Of course, the position is more complex and variable than this. In southern Scotland, native pinewoods do not occur naturally, so upland birch woodland extends further up the slopes. In the north-west Highlands, native pinewood locally comes down to the coast (as at Shieldaig). Many areas have had certain types of native woodland or individual native tree species preferentially removed by past human activities, or tree species like beech and sycamore introduced, sometimes many centuries ago. This is most likely to have happened where sites were accessible for farming or forestry management, much less so on very steep and remote sites. Where slopes are cut into (incised) by side valleys, ash-elm-hazel or alder woodland types can reach further up the main slope where sheltered by landform topography. In some parts of the country, boundaries between native woodland types are quite distinct, whereas in others, different types of oak, birch, ash and hazel woodlands merge together to form a habitat mosaic. Where areas of particularly fertile or wet soils occur, this can also modify local patterns.\n\nEcological context 19\n\nTable 2.1 Altitudinal zonation of native woodland vegetation in Scotland (within and outwith Caledonian Pinewood Zone). Partly after Rodwell (1991a) and Peterken (1993).\n\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific and popular discussion of the likely impacts of human-induced climate change (Broadmeadow and Ray 2005; Read et al. 2009), arising from emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a ‘greenhouse’ gas, from burning fossil fuels. While it is possible to make reasonable model-based predictions for global climatic trends, it is much more difficult to apply these at regional scales (e.g. for Scotland). However, work carried out as part of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) over the past ten years has suggested some key directions of climate change for Scotland that may affect native woodland development and conservation in future. It is predicted that both our summers and our winters will become warmer by 2–4oC during the coming century, and that snow and frost events will become less severe and less frequent on average. Rainfall, especially in the summer, may decrease significantly in the east of Scotland, while the west coast could become even wetter. This represents an increase in the climatic gradient already experienced across Scotland (see above). Windstorms and flood events may become stronger and more frequent, although this is subject to considerable uncertainty (Green and Ray 2009; Ray 2008). These trends could have major implications for native woodland types. Generally, existing types would be expected to occur further up the altitudinal range than was discussed earlier, to retain cooler and moister conditions optimal for their growth. This might cause problems for some native woodland types, including montane scrub and native pinewood, that already occur at higher elevations, as they may no longer be able to find a climatic niche in Scotland where they remain competitive. Especially in eastern Scotland, some native tree species may suffer summer drought stress, growing more slowly than at present. Other species, such as holly, spruce and Rhododendron, may expand in the west coast woodlands (Ray 2008). As\n\n20\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\na result, Scotland may tend to ‘weaken its ecological links’ with the Scandinavian boreal forest biome, but ‘strengthen its ecological links’ with the European temperate evergreen forest biome (see Chapter 1). Introduced tree species, such as lime, sweet chestnut, beech and sycamore, may spread further in a warmer climate as they will produce more seed. A particular issue with a changing climate is the potential for pests and diseases to become more prevalent and damaging as the climate warms (Green and Ray 2009). This is one aspect of the impact of climate change on biodiversity more generally. Organisms which have the capacity to migrate in response to climate change should find suitable conditions elsewhere. This would apply to many mammals, birds and insects, and also to short-lived plants which can spread fairly quickly by annual reseeding. However, longer-lived static organisms, such as trees, cannot do this within a single generation, and may therefore begin to experience climatic stress. This tends to make trees more vulnerable to a range of insect, fungal and bacterial pests, which will also become more common and active within a warmer climatic environment. As a result, pest impacts could be one key mechanism by which climate change drives changes in native woodland composition. At present, Scots pine in the native pinewoods is under threat from Dothistroma needle blight (Brown and Webber 2008), a fungal pathogen that spreads more easily in warm, moist climatic conditions. Ash in Scottish native woodland is now under threat from Chalara ash dieback, and larch and juniper from the fungus-like pathogens Phytophthora spp. When wishing to know the climate for any particular native woodland site or potential habitat restoration area, it is usually possible to obtain this information from published (including online) weather maps, many of which can be handled within a Geographical Information System (GIS) – an important new tool for native woodland management (Heywood et al. 2011) (see Plate 2). It is also possible now to obtain maps of predicted future climate, based on computer modelling of climate-change scenarios (Ray 2008). Those with a long-term management involvement with any particular woodland site will sometimes establish a private weather station to provide localised refinement of published climate data.\n\n2.3 The influences of geology and soils Among natural determinants of native woodland development, geology and soils are second only to climatic factors. Whereas climate usually acts at the regional or landscape scale, geology and soil influences are normally active at the stand or site scale within wider climatic zones. For this reason they should be seen partly as mediating or adjusting factors, which help to determine the types of native woodland that will develop on individual sites within a wider landscape subject to a particular regional climate. In the Scottish situation there is currently no volcanic activity and a very limited degree of seismic activity, which rarely disturbs vegetation cover. This is due to the current arrangement of the tectonic plates, which places the British Isles well away from active faults and ‘hotspots’ on the Earth’s crust. There are periodic and localised\n\nEcological context 21\n\nlandslip events, which can result in vegetation cover being disturbed, but these tend to be ‘top down’ events caused by heavy rainfall episodes, rather than ‘bottom up’ events triggered by seismic activity. The overwhelming importance of geology for native woodland development is then its role as the soil parent material. Geology influences rooting depth, particle size, drainage and fertility of soils (Fitzpatrick 1980; Pritchett and Fisher 2000), all of which have direct effects on stability, structure and composition of native woodlands. When considering geological features of any particular site for native woodland development, it is essential to distinguish underlying ‘solid geology’ or ‘country rock’ from any overlying superficial ‘drift’ deposits of glacial (ice age) or fluvial (river deposit) origin. Where these are present, they, rather than underlying geology, determine soil types. In terms of geology, Scotland has several distinct provinces (Gillen 2013) (see Table 2.2): 1. The Highland zone (north of the Highland Boundary Fault, including the Western Isles) mainly comprises ancient hard rocks of varied origins. These strata include Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone, Cambrian quartzite, intrusive granite, Moine schist and Dalradian shale/limestone. These rocks are typically slow to weather and, in many (but not all) cases, produce inherently infertile soils. In some areas these rocks were uplifted, long after their original formation, into the high Caledonian mountains, which underwent subsequent erosion by ice and water, forming the gentler mountain chains we observe today (Grampians, Cairngorms, NW Highlands). 2. The Southern Upland zone (the rounded hills of the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway) comprises sedimentary (or weakly metamorphosed) rocks of a shale/slate type originating from the Ordovician and Silurian periods. These rocks underwent some later uplifting during the process of geological collision between England and Scotland. These rocks weather more quickly than those of the Highland zone and produce soils of low to moderate fertility, depending on local composition. Small areas within this zone, including Merrick and Criffel, comprise intruded granitic masses of younger ages, producing shallower, ­infertile soils. 3. The Central valley zone represents the area between the Highland Boundary Fault and the Southern Upland Fault – effectively a large trench that was at one time flooded by the sea. The bed of the trench accumulated sedimentary deposits, first of Devonian (Old Red) sandstones and later of Carboniferous (coal-bearing) sandstone and limestone. Igneous rocks erupted through these beds in ancient times, forming the various hill ranges of central Scotland. While this zone contains a wide variety of rocks, they generally produce the more fertile soils in Scotland, supporting the lowland arable farmlands of the Mearns (in Angus), Fife, East Lothian and the Merse (Berwickshire). The Old Red Sandstones in upland fringe areas (such as the Kincardineshire hills north of Fettercairn) are rather less fertile, whereas some of the igneous rocks (for example those of the Kinnoull and Moncrieff Hills, east of Perth)\n\nBasalts Chalk and greensand Kimmeridge clays New Red sandstone\n\nTertiary Cretaceous Jurassic Triassic\n\nIgneous Sedimentary Sedimentary Sedimentary\n\nCategory\n\nWest Highlands, Inner Hebrides West Highlands (very localised) East Sutherland (localised) Inner Moray Firth, Inner Solway\n\nMain Regions of Occurrence\n\nHigh High High Poor–Medium\n\nInherent Fertility\n\nTypical Soil Types Formed\n\nBrown earths Brown earths Brown earths, Gleys Sandy brown earths, Podzols Permian Desert sandstones/breccias Sedimentary Ayrshire, Dumfries, Isle of Arran Medium Brown earths (some Podzols) Carboniferous Sandstone/coal measures Sedimentary Ayrshire, Fife, Central Valley Medium Brown earths, Gleys Carboniferous Limestone Sedimentary Fife, Central Valley Medium–High Brown earths, Gleys Carboniferous Basalt (and associates) Igneous Fife, Central Valley, East Lothian Medium–High Brown earths Devonian Old Red sandstone Sedimentary Central Valley/Moray Firth/Orkney/Borders Poor–Medium Sandy brown earths, Podzols Devonian Basalt (and associates) Igneous Fife/Angus/Perth, Argyll, Lanark High Brown earths Silurian Shales (and associates) Sedimentary Borders, Dumfries & Galloway Poor–Medium Upland brown earths, Ironpans Intrusive Granites Intrusive Highlands, Dumfries & Galloway Very Poor–Poor Podzols, Ironpans, Peaty podzols Ordovician Shales (and associates) Sedimentary Borders, Dumfries & Galloway Poor–Medium Upland brown earths, Ironpans Cambrian Quartzites Sedimentary North-west Highlands Very Poor Rankers, Podzols, Ironpans Pre-Cambrian Dalradian limestones Metamorphic Grampian Highlands, Argyll, S.

In the raised area between Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Carboniferous rocks are overlain by thick deposits of fine-textured glacial tills, producing heavy soils. 4. The Mesozoic sedimentary zone comprises a number of smaller areas with younger sedimentary rocks from the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. These softer rocks (called an overburden) once occurred across the Scottish landscape, but have been removed by later erosion from more exposed upland areas, leaving underlying harder strata exposed. Soft rocks continue to form the solid geology of the southern half of England, and have survived in a few parts of Scotland, such as the Dumfries area and the Moray Firth coastlands. A common rock type is the New Red (or ‘desert’) sandstone of Permo-Triassic age, but there are smaller patches of Jurassic clay in east Sutherland and some very small remnants of Cretaceous chalk on Skye and on the Morvern peninsula. These rocks tend to produce relatively fertile lowland soils, although the New Red sandstones in parts of Morayshire can produce coarse and nutrientpoor sands. 5. The Tertiary basalt zone includes several areas along the western seaboard and islands – Skye, Eigg, Mull and the Ardnamurchan peninsula. Parts of Northern Ireland are similar. These are much younger igneous basaltic rocks from the Tertiary period, produced when the continental landmasses of North America and Europe pulled apart, forming the Atlantic Ocean. The same process is still active today in the volcanic landscapes of Iceland, which now sits over the midAtlantic ridge. The basaltic rocks produce inherently very fertile soils, but steep and unstable slopes.\n\nSuperficial drift of glacial origin occurs across large parts of Scotland where it has not been removed by water or wind erosional activity (Gillen 2013). Drift has been deposited during several glaciations over the past two million years and mainly comprises solid rock materials pulverised by the passage of glaciers. It can be deposited either directly when the glacier melts and its rock content is dropped in situ or, more frequently, it is washed out from underneath the glacier and re-sorted by meltwater activity at the end of the glacial period (Gillen 2013). The most recent period of drift deposition was at the end of the last glaciation some 10,000–12,000 years bp. Since that time many deposits have been removed by erosive action where they remained exposed, but a large portion have become ‘protected’ under a covering of soil and vegetation. While the chemical weathering rate of the drift is usually higher than that of the solid rock from which it formed, it can be poorer than the ‘country rock’ type which it now overlies, having been transported a considerable distance. Some deposits of till are dominated by fine textured material which has been compacted or ‘indurated’ by ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles at the end of the glaciation, producing a dense hard layer at the base of the soil which is impervious to rooting and impedes drainage. Locally, there are more recent floodplain deposits from rivers (Edwards and Ralston 2003), which can range from coarser ‘fluvioglacial’ gravels, through sand banks, to finer silt\n\n24\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nand clay beds. All of these drift substrates have implications for the subsequent formation of overlying soils. When seeking to determine the geology for any particular woodland site, relevant information should generally be obtained from geological maps of suitable scales, readily available from the British Geological Survey (including online). Maps are available of both underlying solid geology and overlying drift. Additional information can be obtained by digging a soil pit (see below), especially as regards superficial drift deposits. An undiggable indurated layer, often of a pale greyish-yellow ‘biscuity’ colour and texture, may be found at the base of the pit (from around 30cm depth in some areas), and pebbles, gravel or stones found within the soil itself often derive from superficial drift deposits. If these stones are of a smooth, rounded shape, these are likely to have been transported by water, not ice. Soils are vitally important to the development of native woodlands due to their functions in providing support, moisture and plant nutrients required for growth. Even where the climate is inherently suitable for a wide range of tree species, poor soils may narrow this down to a smaller number and limit their establishment and growth rates. Soil fertility, in particular, is a key determinant of, and limitation on, native woodland development in Scotland, reflecting the prevalence of infertile solid geologies. Many soils in Scotland are seasonally water-logged, impairing their ability to provide physical resistance to windthrow and reducing plant nutrient availability. Soil types are usually described in terms of a soil classification system. There are a variety of these – some traditional schemes, such as the Soil Survey of Scotland classification, describe soils with reference to typical examples found at named geographical locations (e.g. Countesswells, Arkaig). Others, particularly those used in North America, Russia and tropical regions (Pritchett and Fisher 2000), emphasise the physical and chemical processes by which soils have been formed over time. Of most value for native woodland planning are schemes such as the GB Forestry Commission soil classification (Kennedy 2002; Pyatt et al. 2001) which focus on pedological development, current structure, drainage and fertility of soils. There are six main categories of soil likely to be encountered (Fitzpatrick 1980) within native woodlands in Scotland and areas where native tree planting is contemplated, these being (see Plate 4): 1. Brown earths – these are the best soils for woodland growth, with an absence of impervious layers, water-logging and other barriers to rooting. The soil depth is usually at least 60cm and often up to 1m, providing good support. The colour of the soil is normally brown, red or yellow, reflecting the fact that aeration is good and that iron is remaining in the oxidised state. The soil near the surface may be darker, incorporating organic matter, but there should not be a thick build-up of leaf litter and humus on the soil surface. Texture can vary from clay to sand, but is often a well-structured loam (mixture of particle sizes), maintained by the activity of earthworms. Fertility (nutrient supply) from brown earths varies widely, but is normally adequate for a range of trees. Brown earths in Scotland usually support birch, oak and ash woodland types. Brown earths are found throughout Scotland, mainly on plateau and lower valley slope sites, many long\n\nEcological context 25 having been cleared of woodland for agriculture. Brown earths found in upland areas may show some signs of podzolisation. 2. Podzols – these are infertile soils that have been stripped of their nutrients by downward movement of water through the soil profile over long periods of time. They often form over geologies that have a coarse particle size, such as sand or gravel, containing minerals with a rather low content of plant nutrients. High rainfall is also a contributory factor, speeding up formation of podzols. They can be recognised by the development of a series of layers of different colours. There will often be a thick black mat of organic material (humus) on the soil surface, which is slow to decompose and ‘locks up’ plant nutrients. Certain types of acid vegetation, such as heather, blaeberry and some conifers, produce leaf litter which is difficult to break down due to its chemical composition. Birch, on the other hand, produces fertile litter which can ‘improve’ the soil. Beneath the humus there is a grey, ash-like layer (‘podzol’ means ‘ash’ in Russian), from which iron, nutrients and organic material have been leached out (eluviated). This can vary in thickness from a few millimetres to up to a metre in extreme cases. Lower in the profile there is a strong reddish-brown or black layer where organic matter and iron from above are deposited (illuviated). This can take the form of a thin black layer, known as a hardpan, which limits rooting. Unfortunately plant nutrients such as calcium, potassium and magnesium are not redeposited, and are washed downwards out of the soil, depleting its fertility. Podzols in Scotland usually support native pine, birch and juniper woods of boreal type. Podzols are common in the East Highlands and Cairngorms, being associated with granite and Moine schist geologies and fluvioglacial gravels. 3. Gleyed soils – these are soils which are water-logged for all or part of the year, but which show a fairly wide range of fertility levels. Many gleyed soils have a fine clay texture which makes it difficult for water to drain away – this can be throughout the profile or only at some depth in the soil, impeding drainage. Gleyed soils can usually be recognised by their greyish colour, due to the poor aeration and the resulting reduction of iron compounds. Soils that are weakly gleyed retain their brown colour near the surface, but may show orange and grey mottling deeper down where aeration is poorer. Gleyed soils where the water comes primarily ‘down from above’ (as rainfall) are called surface-water gleys. Those where the water comes primarily ‘up from below’ are called ground-water gleys and usually occur in areas of flat, lower-lying land. The poor aeration in gleyed soils makes it difficult for many trees to take up nutrients, even if these are relatively abundant in the soil. Species such as ash, alder and willow are able to do this and are usually dominant on fertile gleys. Infertile gleys can support wet birch-willow woodlands, locally with Scots pine. Gleyed soils are found throughout Scotland, particularly in upland areas with high rainfall and also over poorly drained drift deposits in the Central Belt. 4. Ironpan soils – these are special cases of the podzol and gleyed soil types, which occur on upland moorland and heathland sites. The soil is normally very infertile, and it is uncommon for woodland to develop naturally over ironpan\n\n26\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nsoils. A thin, hard layer of iron is redeposited in the soil profile at a point where there is a change in moisture and aeration conditions (Fitzpatrick 1980). This can be caused by a ‘wet blanket’ of peat at the surface, sitting on drier mineral soil below, or it can occur where an indurated layer at the base of the soil profile holds up moisture, with drier soil below. Trampling and compaction by livestock over a long period can encourage formation of an ironpan soil in upland areas with high rainfall. The presence of an ironpan prevents drainage of moisture, creating a gleyed layer, and, if well developed, also prevents effective rooting. Ironpan soils are unsuitable for the creation of new native woodland unless the pan is first disrupted. Ironpan soils are found in upland areas of Scotland in the Highland and Southern Upland geological zones, often in areas with heather moorland. 5. Peaty soils – these are soils which have at least 30cm of wet organic matter at the surface, accumulated from the slow decay of plant remains deposited from vegetation. There are a number of different types of peaty soils, largely depending on the peat depth. Deep peats form in blanket and raised bogs, while peaty gleys (with shallower peat) form on wet upland moorlands. Peat tends to be found in situations where the rate of decay of plant material is slowed down by a cold, wet climate or excessive ground water. Peaty soils can form over a long period of time on sites that formerly supported native pinewood and upland birch woodland, leading to gradual loss of woodland cover. Normally, peaty soils are not suitable for native woodland development, although there are localised examples of stunted pine and birch bog woodland. Peaty soils are particularly extensive in the far north of Scotland, in areas such as Sutherland and Caithness (the ‘Flow Country’), supporting wetland habitats. 6. Ranker and skeletal soils – these are soils which are incompletely developed due to being relatively recently formed or due to the weathering rate of the underlying rock being exceptionally slow. They are usually infertile and often incapable of supporting native woodland. Large areas of the far north-west Highlands, with Lewisian gneiss geologies, have peaty ranker soils. A special case of the skeletal soils are the beach sands, as at Culbin and Tentsmuir. Manmade soils over old land-fill sites and mining spoils can also be considered in this category, as they are usually still immature. Information about the soil type on a particular woodland site can be collected from a number of sources. There are Soil Survey of Scotland maps available from the James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, which provide the local ‘soil series’ or ‘soil association’, but these groupings can contain a number of different soil types that commonly occur together. Some older Forestry Commission forests have good soil maps, based on detailed surveys. However, in many cases it will be necessary to carry out a fresh soil survey to collect more local information. For a small site this may consist of a single soil test pit, to a depth of 70–100cm. For larger sites, it may be necessary to dig several pits to capture variation in soil conditions across the area of interest. Details of each layer in the soil profile are described from a soil pit, including depth, structure, texture\n\nEcological context 27\n\nand colour (using the Munsell scale). This should allow the soil to be assigned to one of the major categories discussed above (Kennedy 2002). Ground vegetation can also be used to ‘indicate’ soil conditions and that technique will be covered in more detail in Chapter 9, in terms of planning native woodland expansion.\n\n2.4 Relationships with other habitat types By comparison with major forest territories in Scandinavia, Continental Europe and North America, remnant native woodlands in Scotland are now highly scattered and fragmented. This was not always the case – as will be seen in Chapter 3, which deals with woodland history, Scotland once had native woodland cover over perhaps 50–60% of its total land area (Smout et al. 2005). Fragmentation has occurred through processes of human clearance, combined with climatic and soil deterioration, over the past 5,000 years. The relatively few surviving individual native woodland remnants exceeding 100ha are mostly of native pinewood, upland birch woodland or upland oak woodland. The average native woodland patch is much smaller, and a significant proportion of the total resource is accounted for by patches less than 10ha in extent. The degree of fragmentation is highest for the woodland types of better soils – the lowland mixed deciduous, upland ash-elm-hazel woodlands and alder-willow ­woodlands – many of which are long linear features following river valleys. This means that most native woodlands in Scotland now have a strong interaction with other adjoining habitat types – the so-called ‘edge effect’. These habitats fall into two categories: (1) semi-natural habitats and (2) man-made habitats. The former include moorland, heathland, wetland and some grassland ecosystems, which are usually subject to some human influence (e.g. grazing or burning) but are composed of self-sown native plant species, which regenerate themselves without human assistance. Most native woodlands are themselves ‘semi-natural’ habitats, as they have been modified by human activity and continue to be subject to its influence to varying extents. Scotland has few, if any, woodlands that can be considered truly natural, in the sense that they were never subjected to human modification. Man-made habitats have been created by human activity and require its continued influence to maintain their current formation and structure. These include arable land, improved pastures and recreation grasslands, plantation forestry and developed land. Some ecologists argue that the distinction between semi-natural and man-made habitats is artificial – that moorland and heathland, for example, came into existence as a result of human clearance of woodland in prehistory (Edwards and Ralston 2003; Fraser Darling and Morton Boyd 1969; Simmons 2000; Smout 1993). Some recent commentaries, for example by Fenton (2008) and Tipping (2008), have suggested that many open upland habitats in Scotland arose naturally. Many recent man-made habitats have developed semi-natural elements, such as ground vegetation within plantation conifer forests. Nonetheless, these two categories have different ecological implications. Many semi-natural open-land habitats that occur in Scotland are recognised to be of conservation significance at an international level. In certain cases this may\n\n28\n\nThe native woodlands of scotland\n\nexceed the ecological value of any new native woodland that could conceivably be created there now. For example, boreal Scots pine-birch forest occurs in a vast area across Scandinavia and Russia, whereas Scotland holds much of the world’s resource of heather moorland. A range of animal and plant species, some rare, are dependent upon these open habitats. The range of plant species occurring on – and the large stores of carbon locked up within – Scottish blanket and raised peat bogs means that draining these for woodland establishment is now considered to be ecologically inappropriate. When considering ecological management of semi-natural habitats in Scotland, one has to decide what the target or ‘desired future condition’ should be. Often it will be a native woodland habitat, but in some situations it could still be moor or heath. Both moor and heath are usually dominated by the Calluna-Vaccinium ericoid sub-shrubs (these include heathers, blaeberry, cowberry, etc.) – the difference being that moorland or ‘mire’ habitats are, at least seasonally, water-logged, whereas heaths are usually free-draining. Both may develop over infertile soils as a result of human woodland clearance, burning and livestock grazing over millennia. To assist ecologists in studying and managing semi-natural habitats, the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) has been developed over the past thirty years. The key types of open-land habitat of conservation significance in Scotland are mires and heaths (NVC M and H communities) (Rodwell 1991b), upland grasslands (NVC U communities) and wetland/freshwater habitats. There are much smaller areas of neutral and calcareous grasslands (NVC MG and CG communities) in Scotland that might still be considered partly semi-natural. The boundary between native woodland and these open semi-natural habitats is usually fairly gradual and ‘ecologically porous’. There is often an ecotone between the two, such as juniper-birch scrub establishing on heathland adjoining a native woodland. Many animal and plant species can move between these adjoining habitats, and some open-land habitats, such as heathland, are relatively ‘permeable’ for migrating woodland species (Watts et al. 2005). Ecologists and site managers often have to deal with issues that arise from creating artificial boundaries between semi-natural habitats – for example fencing of woodlands to keep out deer or burning of heathlands to remove woody scrub and promote heather. With the exception of grazing impacts and uncontrolled fires, originally started by land managers, there are limited threats to native woodlands arising from adjoining semi-natural habitats. Man-made habitats are regarded somewhat differently as they are usually treated as of lower conservation significance and they often have an abrupt boundary with the native woodland habitat. Many species that occur within native woodlands cannot easily migrate between native woodland habitat patches by crossing arable or developed land. This means that man-made habitats are much more effective in ecologically fragmenting landscapes, for woodland-dependent species, than are semi-natural habitats such as heathland. Plantation forestry may offer better opportunities in this regard (see below). A number of factors associated with man-made habitats can pose direct external threats to adjoining native woodland. These include various forms of pollution from agricultural chemicals (pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers), industrial chemicals (including on abandoned brown-field sites), light, noise, disturbance\n\nEcological context 29\n\nby vehicles, fires, fly-tipping, straying pets and invasive garden plants. In addition, there is often pressure for further expansion of built development and recreational grassland at the expense of native woodland, although many woodlands have a degree of legal protection due to designation and planning controls (see Chapter 8). Attention is increasingly focused on ‘ecological enhancement’ of adjoining manmade habitats so that they pose less of a challenge to native woodlands and offer greater opportunities for native woodland expansion and for migration of woodland species. The aim is to make them more similar to semi-natural habitats and to increase their habitat permeability for particular species of conservation interest (e.g. ­dormouse). In the case of plantation forestry in Scotland, this can be attempted through the processes of restructuring and diversification that will be discussed in Chapter 10. That approach can also offer a more efficient and reliable route to native woodland habitat expansion than new planting or natural colonisation of native trees onto open ground. Recreation grassland habitats such as parkland and golf courses can also be amenable to improvement through vegetation management approaches – riparian corridors and canal banks offer the opportunity to create networks of semi-natural habitats (Fowler and Stiven 2003). More heavily modified man-made environments – such as urban development, transport infrastructure, industrial sites and intensive arable land – pose greater challenges, usually tackled through ‘defensive measures’ for threat mitigation and native woodland protection.\n\n2.5 Ecological classification of native woodlands For purposes of scientific survey and ecological management, it is valuable to be able to place native woodland habitats into a classification of types based on their species composition and the site conditions that they normally require. Such a scheme of classification should be no more complex than is required for its intended purpose. There have been a variety of attempts to do this over the past century, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Earlier systems of classification, devised between 1900 and 1960, took a mainly botanical approach and were really intended for use by ecological researchers. They adopted many features of earlier phyto-sociological (plant community) classifications from Continental Europe (e.g. the ‘Montpellier school’) (Braun-Blanquet 1932). These systems assume that groups of plant species, including trees and herbs, form ‘semi-permanent associations’ that are more than ‘marriages of convenience’. In the 1960s, McVean and Ratcliffe produced a classification of ‘potential natural’ native woodland cover for Scotland, emphasising the historical woodland cover of the country and the most appropriate types for future restoration (McVean and Ratcliffe 1962). During the 1970s, George Peterken, a prominent English-based woodland ecologist, developed a system of ‘stand-type classification’ (Peterken 1993) that dealt mainly with the tree and shrub components of existing woodlands and was intended, to a greater degree, to inform active management of these, rather than as a tool for detailed botanical studies. Finally, the last three decades have seen the development of the woodland section of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC), edited by Professor John Rodwell at the University of Lancaster (Rodwe"
