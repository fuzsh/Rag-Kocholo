        "text": "Portsmouth Football Club is an English football club based in the city of Portsmouth. Portsmouth's home matches have been played at Fratton Park since the club's formation in 1898. The club is playing in Football League One in the 2012–13 season after being relegated from the Football League Championship in 2011–12.\n\nPortsmouth have been a successful club in recent years, especially during the 2007-08 Premier League season, when they won the FA Cup, beating Cardiff City 1–0 in the final. They subsequently qualified for the UEFA Cup (now Europa League). During this period, Portsmouth were recognised to have a large number of international footballers, including England players Glen Johnson and Jermain Defoe, as well as Peter Crouch, David James and Sol Campbell.\n\nPortsmouth have been champions of England twice, in 1949 and 1950. As well as the 2008 FA Cup win, Portsmouth also won in 1939, when they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: History of Portsmouth F.C.\n\nFor information on a breakdown of Portsmouth's league and cup history, see List of Portsmouth F.C. seasons.\n\n1898–1939: Beginnings of Portsmouth F.C.[]\n\nThe club was founded in 1898 with John Brickwood—owner of the local Brickwoods Brewery—as chairman, and Frank Brettell as the club's first manager. A blue plaque on the wall of 12 High St Portsmouth commemorates the founding on 5 April. The club joined the Southern League in 1899, with their first league match being played at Chatham Town on 2 September 1899 (a 1–0 victory),[1] followed three days later by the first match at Fratton Park; a friendly against local rivals Southampton, which was won 2–0, with goals from Dan Cunliffe (formerly with Liverpool) and Harold Clarke (formerly with Everton).[2] That first season was successful, with the club winning 20 out of 28 league matches, earning them the runner-up spot in the league. 1910–11 saw Portsmouth relegated, but with the recruitment of Robert Brown as manager, the team was promoted the following season.\n\nLeague football was suspended during World War I, but following the resumption of matches Portsmouth won the Southern League for the second time. Continuing success saw them in the Third Division for the 1920–21 season. They finished 12th that year, but won the division in the 1923–24 season. The club continued to perform well in the Second Division, winning promotion by finishing 2nd in the 1926–27 season, gaining a record 9–1 win over Notts County along the way. Portsmouth's debut season in the First Division was a struggle. The next season they continued to falter, losing 10–0 to Leicester City, still a club record defeat. However, despite their failings in the league, that season also saw Portsmouth reach the FA Cup final for the first time, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Portsmouth managed to survive relegation, and their fortunes began to change. The 1933–34 season saw Portsmouth again reach the FA Cup Final, beating Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City and Birmingham City on the way. The club was again defeated in the final, this time to Manchester City.\n\n1939: First FA Cup triumph[]\n\nHaving established themselves in the top flight, the 1938–39 season saw Portsmouth reach the FA Cup final, the third time they had done so. This time, Portsmouth managed to convincingly defeat favourites Wolverhampton Wanderers 4–1. Bert Barlow and Jock Anderson scored whilst Cliff Parker scored twice (3rd and 4th) completed the famous victory. League football was again suspended due to the Second World War, meaning Portsmouth hold the unusual distinction of holding the FA Cup for the longest uninterrupted period as the trophy wasn't played again until the 1945–46 season.\n\n1948–49 and 1949–50: Champions of England[]\n\nLeague football resumed for the 1946–47 campaign after five years and Portsmouth continued in the First Division. Portsmouth had a large advantage during the war where a lot of footballers had to move to Portsmouth to serve at the docks. Because of this they decided to play for the closest professional team and Portsmouth had the pick of the best. In their \"Golden Jubilee\" season of 1948–49, the club were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win the Football League and FA Cup double, but crashed out of the FA Cup in the semi-final against Leicester City. They still made up for it by claiming the league title in spectacular fashion. That season also saw them record a (then) massive attendance of 51,385, a club record which still stands to this day. The club powered their way to the title the following year, beating Aston Villa 5–1 on the last day of the season, and are thus one of only five English teams to have won back to back titles since World War II.\n\n1954–1970: The Years to follow[]\n\nPortsmouth finished third in 1954–55 and on 22 February 1956, they played the first league game under floodlights against Newcastle United. Subsequent seasons saw Portsmouth struggle and they were relegated to the Second Division in 1959. Portsmouth went down to the Third Division in 1961 (the first former English League champions to do so) but were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking under the guidance of George Smith. Despite limited financial means, Smith maintained Portsmouth's Second Division status throughout the sixties until moving upstairs to become General Manager in April 1970.\n\n1972–1988: Deacon to Gregory[]\n\nA cash injection, that accompanied the arrival of John Deacon as chairman in 1972, failed to improve Portsmouth's league position. With Deacon unable to continue bankrolling the club on the same scale, Portsmouth were relegated to the Third Division in 1976.\n\nIn November 1976, the club found itself needing to raise £25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy. With players having to be sold to ease the club's financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on an untried manager, Ian St John and inexperienced young players. Consequently, they were relegated to the Fourth Division in 1978.\n\nPortsmouth were promoted back to Division Three in 1980, and in the 1982–83 season they won the Third Division championship, gaining promotion back to the Second Division. Under Alan Ball's management, Portsmouth narrowly missed winning promotion to the First Division twice before finally succeeding in 1986–87. Unfortunately, by the middle of the 1987–88 season the club was again in grave financial trouble, and Portsmouth were relegated straight back to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw Deacon sell the club to London based businessman and former Queens Park Rangers Chairman, Jim Gregory.\n\n1991–2001: Smith, Venables and Mandarić[]\n\nJim Smith's arrival as manager at the start of the 1991–92 season, combined with the emergence of some good young players, sparked a revival in the team's fortunes and that year Portsmouth reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing on penalties to eventual winners Liverpool after a replay. Portsmouth missed out on promotion to the FA Premier League in 1992–93 only by virtue of having scored one less goal than West Ham United.\n\nIn the summer of 1996 Terry Venables arrived at Portsmouth as a consultant, later taking over as chairman after buying the club for £1. The team enjoyed a run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1996–97, beating FA Premier League side Leeds United en route, but finished just short of the qualifying places for the play-offs for promotion to the Premier League.\n\nPortsmouth's centenary season, 1998–99, saw a serious financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into financial administration. Milan Mandarić saved the club with a takeover deal in May 1999, and the new chairman immediately started investing. However the club only survived on the last day of the 2000–01 season when they won their final game and Huddersfield Town lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense.\n\n2002–2008: Harry Redknapp[]\n\nHarry Redknapp took over as manager in early 2002, with Jim Smith returning to the club as assistant manager. Redknapp was able to make the most of Mandarić's willingness to invest in players at a time when competitors were struggling after the collapse of ITV Digital's television deal with the Football League. Just over a year later, Portsmouth were celebrating winning the Division One Championship and promotion to the Premier League, winning the title with a game to spare.[3]\n\nThe club finished 13th, 16th and 17th in their first three Premier League seasons. Redknapp had resigned midway through the club's second Premier League season, after a disagreement with Mandaric, and went on to manage bitter rivals Southampton, only to return just over a year later, with Velimir Zajec and then Alain Perrin having had brief spells as manager in-between. In January 2006, Portsmouth were bought by businessman Alexandre Gaydamak whose funding allowed for the club to buy practically a whole new squad mid-season. The signings included a quartet from Tottenham Hotspur, then record signing Benjani Mwaruwari and the highly rated Argentina international Andrés D'Alessandro on loan from VfL Wolfsburg. With large amounts of money available for the manager to make record signings, the club finished the 2006–07 season in the top half of the table for the first time, only one point short of European qualification.[citation needed]\n\n2008: Second FA Cup triumph[]\n\nThe 2007–08 season started with Portsmouth winning the 2007 Premier League Asia Trophy, beating Liverpool 4–2 on penalties after a goalless final. It was not the club's only success that season; they reached the FA Cup final for the first time since 1939. They eliminated Manchester United at Old Trafford in the quarter-finals, and beat Championship side West Brom 1–0 at Wembley Stadium in the semi-finals, coincidentally the same day that the club celebrated its 110th birthday. Portsmouth went on to win the cup with a 1–0 win over Cardiff, with Nwankwo Kanu scoring the only goal. The win earned them a place in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, the club's first time playing European football. Their first European match was a historic 2–0 victory over Vitória Guimarães in the first round on 18 September. Portsmouth went on to win the tie 4–2 on aggregate, progressing to the group stage.\n\nOn 25 October 2008, Redknapp left Portsmouth for a second time, leaving his assistant Tony Adams to be promoted to the managerial role. On 27 November, Portsmouth managed a historic 2–2 draw with Italian giants A.C. Milan, going 2–0 up through goals from Younes Kaboul and Peter Crouch, but conceding two goals later in the game. However, performances were not consistently good, and the FA Cup holders bowed out of the 2009 competition at the fourth round stage with a 2–0 home defeat at the hands of Championship side Swansea City. Adams was dismissed in February 2009.[4] Youth team coach Paul Hart took over as manager until the end of the season, with Brian Kidd assisting him, and oversaw an upturn in form that resulted in Portsmouth being guaranteed Premier League safety on 16 May 2009. Portsmouth finished the 2008–09 Premier League season in 14th place. On 26 May, Portsmouth accepted a bid from United Arab Emirates businessman Sulaiman Al Fahim to buy the club.[5]\n\n2009–2010: Administration and relegation[]\n\nBecause of the financial problems suffered by the club, Portsmouth were forced to sell several of their top players and high earners, this included selling Peter Crouch, Sylvain Distin, Glen Johnson and Niko Kranjčar. On 21 July, Al Fahim was appointed Non executive Chairman of Portsmouth. On 19 August, Portsmouth announced on their website that a rival consortium headed by current CEO Peter Storrie had also made a bid for the club; unknown at the time, this was backed by Ali Al-Faraj. Despite this, Al Fahim completed the takeover on 26 August; Al Faraj moved to review a takeover of West Ham United.\n\nAs the early stages of the 2009–10 season progressed, the finances dried up and the club admitted on 1 October that some of their players and staff had not been paid. On 3 October, media outlets started to report that a deal was nearing completion for Ali al-Faraj to take control of the club. On 5 October, a deal was agreed for Al Faraj and his associates via BVI-registered company Falcondrone to hold a 90% majority holding, with Al-Fahim retaining 10% stake and the title of non-executive Chairman for two years.[6][7][8] Falcondrone also agreed a deal with Gaydamak the right to buy, for £1, Miland Development (2004) Ltd, which owns various strategic pockets of land around the ground, once refinancing is complete.[9] 2 days after the Al-Faraj takeover was completed Portsmouth's former Technical Director Avram Grant returned as Director of football.[10] On the pitch, Portsmouth's late transfer of funds called for a flurry of transfers at the end of the window, including the loan signing of Ivory Coast international Aruna Dindane who would go on to score a hat trick against Wigan Athletic. An opening run of seven defeats saw fears Hart would be sacked. However at the eighth attempt, at Molineux Stadium, Hassan Yebda another loanee, headed the first win. Portsmouth were beaten 4–2 at home by Aston Villa in the quarter finals of the League Cup having beaten off Premier League high-flyers Stoke City. Yet another loanee Frédéric Piquionne was on target twice. However, because of the financial problems, the Premier League placed the club under a transfer embargo, meaning the club were not allowed to sign any players.\n\nAvram Grant took over at Portsmouth on 26 November 2009[11][12] replacing former manager Paul Hart, who had been sacked by the board two days previously, due to the club's position at the bottom of the league.[13]\n\nIn December 2009, it was announced that the club had failed to pay the players for the second consecutive month,[14] on the 31st it was announced player's wages would again be paid late on 5 January 2010. According to common football contracts, the players then had the right to terminate their contracts and leave the club without any compensation for the club, upon giving two weeks notice. Despite the financial difficulties, Grant's time as manager was initially successful. He gained two wins (against Burnley and Liverpool) and a draw away at Sunderland from his first five games. The only losses inflicted on Portsmouth in this period were by eventual double winners Chelsea and the previous season's champions, Manchester United. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) filed a winding-up petition against Portsmouth at the High Court in London on 23 December 2009.[15] In March 2010, this winding-up petition was dropped,[16] leaving Portsmouth with a nine-point penalty for entering administration.[17] During the 2009–10 season, it had become apparent to the club's new owner Balram Chainrai that Portsmouth were approximately £135 million in debt[18] so to protect the club from liquidation, Chainrai placed the club into administration on 26 February 2010, and the club appointed Andrew Andronikou, Peter Kubik and Michael Kiely of accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young as administrators. This automatically incurred a nine-point penalty from the FA Premier League which came into effect on 17 March and resigned the team to almost certain relegation, which was mathematically confirmed on 10 April.[19]\n\nOn 9 April it was announced David Lampitt would be joining Portsmouth as their new CEO after he had worked a period of notice at the FA his current employer. Portsmouth were relegated to the Championship the following day after West Ham United beat Sunderland. Despite this, Portsmouth won their FA Cup semi-final match against Tottenham 2–0 after extra-time the next day, with goals from Frédéric Piquionne and Kevin-Prince Boateng winning the match. They faced Chelsea in the final at Wembley on 15 May and lost 1–0 to a goal from Didier Drogba. Despite being the FA Cup finalist, the club were denied a licence to play European football the following season in the UEFA Europa League, and therefore the European place went to Liverpool.[20] In May, Grant resigned as Portsmouth manager and later joined West Ham, whose win over Sunderland relegated Portsmouth from the Premier League. On 17 June, the club's creditors voted for a Company Voluntary Arrangement,[21] with a 81.3% majority; Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Paul Hart and the agent of Portsmouth midfielder Tommy Smith were the only ones to reject it, but HMRC appealed against the CVA due to the reduction of their considerable debt.[22] On 15 July 2010 HMRC appealed against the proposed CVA on the last day before it would be formally agreed,[23] the case was originally going to take place in October 2010, but after an appeal from the administrators at the club it was set for 3 August at the High Court in London. The case was heard by Mr Justice Mann from 3 to 5 August where, having heard submissions from both sides, he turned down HMRC's appeal on all five counts put forward by the revenue service. HMRC decided not to appeal against the verdict, leaving Portsmouth's administrators to formally agree the CVA and bring the club out of administration.[24] On 17 August, Balram Chainrai completed his takeover of the club and passed the owners and Directors F&PPT.\n\nOn 22 October, Portsmouth issued a statement saying: \"it appears likely that the club will now be closed down and liquidated by the administrators.\",[25] but key creditor Alexandre Gaydamak announced the next day that he had reached an agreement which could save their future.[26] It was revealed just hours later that Portsmouth had finally come out of administration,[27] with Balram Chainrai regaining control of the company.[28]\n\n2010–2012: The Championship[]\n\nFormer Notts County manager Steve Cotterill was appointed manager of the club in June 2010 on a three-year contract.[29] During the 2010 Summer transfer window, Marc Wilson, who had only recently been named captain, signed for Stoke City on transfer deadline day, with Stoke players Dave Kitson and Liam Lawrence moving to Fratton Park as part of the deal.[30] After a poor start had left Portsmouth rooted to the bottom of the league in September, they went on a seven-match unbeaten run, which helped lift them to mid-table by the end of October.[31] After achieving 19 points from seven matches in October, Cotterill was nominated for the October Manager of the Month award. Lawrence, with six goals under his belt and a number of impressive performances, also received a nomination for Player of the Month.\n\nUnfortunately this run of form did not continue. Later in the season, Portsmouth's form started to falter and they were in 18th place by January 2011. During this time the size of the squad depleted further by contract complications with players Richard Hughes and Michael Brown as a clause written into their contract would trigger a new contract with higher wages. Another seven-match unbeaten run was recorded, picking up 17 points from a possible 21. In March, Portsmouth recorded a 1–0 win over a strong Leicester City with a first-half David Nugent strike splitting the teams apart. Portsmouth finished the season with an eight-game winless run and ended up 16th with 58 points.\n\nOn 1 June 2011, Convers Sports Initiatives owned by Russian Vladimir Antonov completed its takeover of the club.[32] On 15 June the club announced their first summer signing, who was David Norris from Ipswich on a free transfer, this was followed by the signings of Jason Pearce (strangely the first transfer with available money since January 2010),[33] Luke Varney, Stephen Henderson and Greg Halford.[34]\n\nOn 13 August, prior to kick-off against Reading at Fratton Park, it was announced, much to the delight of the home fans, that Portsmouth had re-signed forward Benjani Mwaruwari, Benjani previously left the club in 2008. On 14 October, Steve Cotterill agreed a compensation package to be allowed to take the vacant Nottingham Forest manager's position.[35] Later that day, it was announced that first team coaches Stuart Gray and Guy Whittingham would take over management duties, Cotterill's departure allowed several omitted players a return to the first team, such as Dave Kitson and Ricardo Rocha in a 2–0 home win against Barnsley.\n\nFollowing Cotterill's departure, Michael Appleton was announced as the new manager on 10 November 2011.[36] His first match in charge was a 2–0 defeat at Watford, only Appleton's second match as a first team manager.[clarification needed]\n\nAdministration[]\n\nOn 23 November 2011, a Europe-wide arrest warrant was issued for owner of Portsmouth, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Antonov, by Lithuanian prosecutors as part of an investigation into alleged asset stripping at Lithuanian bank Bankas Snoras, which is 68% owned by Antonov and went into temporary administration the previous week. Operations in another of Antonov's banks, Latvijas Krajbanka were suspended by Latvian authorities on 22 November 2011 for similar reasons.[37] Antonov was subsequently arrested at his offices in London on 24 November and was bailed.[38]\n\nConvers Sports Initiatives (CSI) released a statement which said \"In the light of the recent events at Snoras Bank, Convers Sports Initiatives (CSI) would like to reassure its companies, staff, and the fans of its teams and events, that it remains very much business as usual.\" The statement added that \"CSI has been solely financed through the private wealth of its owners. Snoras Bank has never provided funding for the purchase of a CSI organisation, nor has it lent any money to these businesses after they have been acquired.\"[39] However, Lithuanian prosecutors added that they would be taking \"all the necessary steps\" to freeze assets belonging to Mr Antonov and his business partner.[38] On 29 November 2011, Antonov resigned as chairman of Portsmouth after parent company Convers Sports Initiatives entered administration.[40] On 24 January 2012, Portsmouth were issued with a winding up petition by HMRC for over £1.6 million in unpaid taxes, which was heard on 20 February.[41]\n\nOn 17 February, Portsmouth went into administration for the second time in two years, bringing them an automatic 10-point deduction.[42][43] Administrator Trevor Birch admitted that the financial situation was \"worse than we first feared\" and that Portsmouth were \"struggling to make the end of the season\".[44] On 11 April 2012, reports from administrators PKF revealed that Portsmouth owed £58 million debt with £38 million is owed to UHY Hacker Young, £10.5 million investment made by Vladimir Antonov's Convers Sports Initiatives (CSI) remains outstanding, Players are due £3.5 million in wages and bonuses for the last two seasons, while £2.3 million is owed to Revenue and Customs and additionally, £3.7 million is owed for general trade.[45] On 21 April Portsmouth were relegated from the Championship after a 2–1 loss to Derby County, condemning Portsmouth to League One with no money in the bank – the first time in 30 years that the club has played at that level.\n\n2012–present: League One[]\n\nFollowing Pompey's relegation, the entire professional playing squad left the club, with the final player leaving on 10 August 2012.[46] Portsmouth were due to start the 2012–13 season on −10 points after being told by the Football League that they were allowed into League One with strict financial controls, which administrator Trevor Birch described as \"unjustified\",[47] despite the penalty not being immediately applied, it was confirmed in December 2012.[48]\n\nOn 7 November 2012 it was confirmed that Michael Appleton would leave Portsmouth to become the manager of Blackpool F.C. along with first team coach Ashley Westwood. The club confirmed that Guy Whittingham would take over as caretaker manager.[49] On 9 November 2012 Chanrai halted his attempt to buy the club.[50] Six days later, the Pompey Supporters Trust signed an agreement with PFK to buy the club.[51]. Portsmouth were unable to find a manager on a long-term basis due to their financial state. Guy Whittingham is the current caretaker manager until Portsmouth are out of administration.\n\nPlayers[]\n\nFirst-team squad[]\n\nAs of 28 November 2012[52]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

This kit lasted until 1909 when they changed to white shirts with royal blue shorts and socks. This kit lasted just two years before it was changed for blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was Portsmouth's home strip up until 1947 when the socks were changed to red; this coincided with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since. Yellow and – more recently – gold have also been used as secondary colours on the club's home shirts.[55]\n\nThe most frequent away colours used by Portsmouth have been white shirts with royal or navy blue shorts and either blue or white socks.[citation needed] The club has had white as either the second or third choice shirt for every season since 1998–99 to date.[citation needed] Other colours that have appeared several times on Portsmouth change kits have been yellow (usually with blue shorts) and red (often combined with black).[citation needed] Portsmouth have also briefly experimented with salmon pink, orange, navy blue and, perhaps most notably, gold change strips.[citation needed] From the 2006–07 season to the 2008–09 season the club have used black with a gold trim as their third choice colours.[citation needed] In the 2009–10 season the third kit was black with blue trim and thin blue hoops.[citation needed] The away kit was white with two navy blue vertical lines running the whole way down the side of the shirt, with the badge superimposed on top of them.[citation needed] The home kit has been the classic red white and blue kit, with plain blue shirt, plain white shorts and plain red socks.[citation needed] For the 2010 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth wore a change kit of white, maroon and pink.[citation needed]\n\nClub crest[]\n\nThe official emblem contains a gold star and crescent on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the star and crescent is said to have come from when King Richard I, granted the city \"a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points\" which he had taken from the Byzantine Emperor's standard of Governor Isaac Komnenos, after capturing Cyprus. Throughout their history the club have tried different variations of the crest before reverting back to the basic gold star and crescent. In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional crest was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped the original crest and replaced it with a new design. This crest showed a football on top of an anchor (representing the navy) and a sword (representing the army). An interchangeable version included a circular version of the star and crescent crest in place of the football. The return of the original crest in 1989 only lasted four years when it was replaced by the city's coat of arms in 1993. This design was based around the basic star and crescent but was unpopular with many fans who thought it was over elaborate. After only four seasons the original crest was again reinstated. \"Since 1898\" was added to the badge underneath the club's name in time for the 2007 season. On 6 May 2008, Portsmouth unveiled a new crest which differs significantly from the old crest. The \"star and moon\" now have a three dimensional look after the \"three points\" was removed. The \"moon\" also has more diameter and looks quite like the city's Coat of Arms.\n\nStadium[]\n\nMain article: Fratton Park\n\nPortsmouth play their home games at Fratton Park, in Portsmouth. The ground has been home to the club throughout its entire history.\n\nFratton Park is known for its intense atmosphere, due both to the highly vocal fan support, and the fact that the pitch is literally a few feet from the stands. Thierry Henry was quoted as saying Portsmouth have \"tremendous\" fans after Arsenal beat them 5–1 in the FA Cup,[56]\n\nPlans for relocation were first mooted as long ago as the early 1990s, but due to various objections, and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the Royal Navy at Horsea Island, between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible FIFA World Cup 2018 venue as part of England's bid process. However, the cost to the city's taxpayers to join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take.[57] A third, oft returned to option, is to build a new stadium on the site of the existing Fratton Park.\n\nFollowing Portsmouth F.C.'s financial troubles, subsequent relegation from the FA Premier League, and the failure of the England 2018 bid, as of April 2011 there are no active plans for a new club stadium.\n\nPortsmouth FC also had an award winning Stadium Announcer between 2002 to 2009. Steve Pearson was voted the Upshot Communications Stadium Announcer of the Year on 3 occasions 2003, 2004, and 2008. (Upshot Communications are a media company which provide football clubs with various forms of media, music cds and videos and compiled a league via feedback from fans and clubs.)\n\nRivalries[]\n\nMain article: South Coast derby\n\nPortsmouth's main rivals are near neighbours Southampton. Prior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This derby match has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987–88, 2003–04, 2004–05 and 2011–12). Including Southern League games, there have been 68 games between the clubs. but they have also met in the FA Cup in recent years with Southampton being victorious in the 2005 FA Cup 4th Round, but the next time they met in this competition, Portsmouth beat their bitter rivals 4–1 at St Mary's. Another rivalry over the years, colloquially known as the \"Dockyard Derby\", is with Plymouth Argyle.[58][59] This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports.[60]\n\nThe Pompey Chimes[]\n\nThe best known chant sung by Portsmouth supporters is the Pompey Chimes (\"Play up Pompey, Pompey play up\", sung to the tune of the Westminster Chimes). It is regarded as football's oldest chant still in use today.[61][62] The origins of the Pompey Chimes lies with the Royal Artillery FC, Portsmouth's most popular and successful football team for much of the 1890s, who played many of their home games at the United Services ground in Burnaby Road. The nearby Guildhall clock, completed in 1890, would strike the quarter hours and the referees would use the clock to let them know when the match should finish at 4 pm. Just before 4 pm the crowd would lilt in unison with the chimes of the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle signifying full-time. The original words to 'The Chimes', as printed in the 1900–01 Official Handbook of Portsmouth FC, were:\n\nPlay up Pompey,\n\nJust one more goal!\n\nMake tracks! What ho!\n\nHallo! Hallo!!\n\nWith the demise of Royal Artillery after their expulsion from the 1898–99 FA Amateur Cup for alleged professionalism, many of Royal Artillery's supporters transferred their allegiance to the newly formed Portsmouth F.C. and brought the Chimes chant with them.\n\nPortsmouth in Europe[]\n\nMain article: Portsmouth F.C. in Europe\n\nPortsmouth have only played European football once, taking part in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, in which they were knocked out at the group stage.\n\n[]\n\nThe club's female counterpart is Portsmouth L.F.C., which currently plays in the FA Women's Premier League National Division.\n\nAffiliated clubs[]\n\nPortsmouth have had a long standing relationship with Havant & Waterlooville, with regular pre-season friendlies organised between the two clubs. Portsmouth have also previously used West Leigh Park, Havant & Waterlooville's home stadium, for reserve team matches. Previous links with Belgian side Zulte Waregem[63] and Irish academy Home Farm[64] have been cancelled.\n\nHonours[]\n\nMajor honours[]\n\nPremier League [nb 1]\n\nChampions: (2) – 1949, 1950\n\n3rd: (1) – 1955\n\n4th: (2) – 1931, 1952\n\nFA Cup\n\nWinners: (2) – 1939, 2008\n\nRunners-up: (3) – 1929, 1934, 2010\n\nSemi-finalists: (2) – 1949, 1992\n\nChampionship [nb 1]\n\nChampions: (1) – 2003\n\nRunners-up: (2) – 1927, 1987\n\n3rd: (1) – 1993\n\n4th: (3) – 1925, 1985, 1986\n\n5th: (1) – 1968\n\nLeague One [nb 1]\n\nChampions: (3) – 1924, 1962, 1983\n\n3rd: (1) – 1922\n\n6th: (1) – 1981\n\n7th: (1) – 1923\n\nFA Community Shield\n\nWinners: (1) – 1949\n\nRunners-up: (1) – 2008\n\nLeague Two [nb 1]\n\n4th: (1) – 1980\n\n7th: (1) – 1979\n\nOther honours[]\n\nSee also: Other Honours\n\nClub records[]\n\nRecord attendance: 51,385 v Derby County, FA Cup, 26 February 1949\n\nRecord victory: 9–1 v Notts County, Division 2, 9 April 1927\n\nRecord defeat: 0–10 v Leicester City, Division 1, 20 October 1928\n\nHighest scoring game: 7–4 v Reading, Premier League, 29 September 2007\n\nMost appearances for club: 834 Jimmy Dickinson, 1946–65\n\nMost league goals for club: 194 Peter Harris, 1946–1960\n\nMost league goals in a season: 42 Guy Whittingham, 1992/93\n\nMost goals for club: 211 Peter Harris, 1946–60\n\nMost international caps whilst at club: 48 Jimmy Dickinson\n\nTransfer record (received): £18 million from Real Madrid for Lassana Diarra December 2008\n\nTransfer record (paid): £11 million to Liverpool for Peter Crouch, July 2008\n\nRecord signing[]\n\nOn 11 July 2008, Portsmouth completed the club-record signing – thought to be around £11 million – of England striker Peter Crouch in a four-year deal from Liverpool.[65] This marked the second time Crouch had been Portsmouth's most expensive player as in 2001 his £1.5 million fee was a club record. Portsmouth's first million-pound signing was Rory Allen in July 1999.[66] The highest fee received was £20 million for midfielder Lassana Diarra to Real Madrid.[citation needed]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial websites[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nPortsmouth FC at the UEFA official website\n\nNews sites[]\n\nPortsmouth FC on BBC Sport:\n\nPortsmouth FC news from Sky Sports\n\nPublications[]\n\nColin Farmery (2005).
