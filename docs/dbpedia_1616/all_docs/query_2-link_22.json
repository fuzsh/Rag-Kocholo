Each ecological niche presents a series of challenges to successful colonization with which streptococci have to contend. Some species exist in equilibrium with their host, neither stimulating nor submitting to immune defenses mounted against them. Most are either opportunistic or true pathogens responsible for diseases such as pharyngitis, tooth decay, necrotizing fasciitis, infective endocarditis, and meningitis. Part of the success of streptococci as colonizers is attributable to the spectrum of proteins expressed on their surfaces. Adhesins enable interactions with salivary, serum, and extracellular matrix components; host cells; and other microbes. This is the essential first step to colonization, the development of complex communities, and possible invasion of host tissues. The majority of streptococcal adhesins are anchored to the cell wall via a C-terminal LPxTz motif. Other proteins may be surface anchored through N-terminal lipid modifications, while the mechanism of cell wall associations for others remains unclear. Collectively, these surface-bound proteins provide Streptococcus species with a “coat of many colors,” enabling multiple intimate contacts and interplays between the bacterial cell and the host. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated direct roles for many streptococcal adhesins as colonization or virulence factors, making them attractive targets for therapeutic and preventive strategies against streptococcal infections. There is, therefore, much focus on applying increasingly advanced molecular techniques to determine the precise structures and functions of these proteins, and their regulatory pathways, so that more targeted approaches can be developed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Streptococcus, although not named, was first recorded in 1683 in van Leeuwenhoek's drawings of microscope images of the material removed from between his teeth. The main entry of streptococci into history was in 1879, when Louis Pasteur was studying puerperal fever. This was causing high mortality rates in maternity wards. Within the bodies of diseased women, he found rounded granules (microorganisms) arranged in the form of chains or strings of beads. He was convinced, and it was later proven, that this was the cause of infections in women after childbirth. Thus, streptococci were one of the first microbes to be identified as causing contagious disease, and their existence led to the introduction of hygiene and aseptic practices into hospital wards. Streptococcus comes from the Greek strepto (twisted) and coccus (spherical). There are now over 100 recognized species of Streptococcus. Historically, the classification of streptococci was based on the Lancefield scheme, which groups streptococcal strains according to the carbohydrate composition of cell wall antigens (331). Such antigens, known as group-specific antigens or C substances, are either polysaccharides (as in groups A, B, C, E, F, and G), teichoic acids (as in groups D and N), or lipoteichoic acid (as in group H) (505). This approach has proved successful for the more pathogenic streptococci, but its widespread application is hindered by the fact that group-specific antigens for other species may be absent or shared between distinct taxa. The streptococci may also be organized into six groupings (Fig. ) based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (295). The pyogenic group includes Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A), S. agalactiae and S. uberis (group B), and S. dysgalactiae (group C, G, or L) (Fig. ). S. equi (group C) and S. iniae are also in this group but are not shown in Fig. . These organisms are involved mainly in the colonization of humans and other mammals (although S. iniae colonizes fish). They are associated with a range of diseases including tonsillitis, pharyngitis, impetigo, mastitis, and sequelae such as rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis (S. pyogenes), and neonatal sepsis (S. agalactiae). S. dysgalactiae is a major organism associated with bovine mastitis, while S. equi causes strangles in horses. The mitis group (Fig. ) comprise species almost all of which may be isolated from the human oral cavity or nasopharynx. S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S. pneumoniae are highly related, and because of extensive horizontal gene transfer, the delineation of strains into these species is often blurred. S. pneumoniae is a major pathogen associated with otitis media, bronchitis, sinusitis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Colonization by S. pneumoniae will not be addressed in detail in this article, and the reader is referred to recent excellent reviews of adherence and virulence factors (43, 284). Other groupings include the anginosus and salivarius groups, which contain mainly human and animal oral cavity microbes, and the bovis group (Fig. ). Mutans group streptococci comprise the least related organisms. They include a range of bacteria colonizing the oral cavities of humans (S. mutans and S. sobrinus), macaques (S. downei), rats (S. ratti), and hamsters (S. criceti) that are all associated with the development of dental caries (tooth decay). Oral cavity microbes are often cited as viridans group streptococci because colonies cause greening of blood agar. This is referred to as alpha-hemolysis and is indicative of hydrogen peroxide production. The pyogenic group of organisms is beta-hemolytic, producing true hemolysis on blood agar.\n\nColonization Attributes\n\nThis article focuses on the adherence and colonization properties of selected members of the genus Streptococcus, particularly from the perspective of community development. Bacteria in the natural environment often grow upon surfaces, and it is thought that many species of streptococci that colonize mammals exist naturally within communities of bacteria growing as biofilms. Different streptococci vary in their propensities to form biofilm communities, but in all cases, biofilm formation depends first upon the adherence of cells to a surface. Cell division and multiplication then occur to produce a society (clonal), and the integration of other microorganisms within the society leads to the formation of a community (mixed species) (Fig. ). Environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, oxygen availability, and organic metabolites, etc., influence the development of these communities, and signaling molecules for cell-cell communication are integral to population control (Fig. ). The coverage of this review is summarized diagrammatically in Fig. . Surface and secreted proteins are mediators of adherence and virulence, membrane transporters are central to the import of nutrients and the export of small signaling molecules, and two-component signal transduction systems (TCSS) enable environmental sensing, sampling, and cellular responses. All of these surface components contribute to colonization processes, biofilm formation, and microbial community development.\n\nStudies of the structure and function of proteins in streptococci have been crucial to an understanding of pathogenesis ever since the S. pyogenes M protein was first purified from the group A Streptococcus (GAS) cell surface (121). Cell surface proteins are responsible for initial interactions of streptococci with the host. These interactions may include adherence to host cells or tissues, e.g., salivary pellicle on teeth; binding of soluble factors, e.g., lactoferrin at mucosal surfaces, or of plasma proteins, e.g., immunoglobulins (Igs); and stimulation of host responses, e.g., cytokine production. Similarities between cell surface proteins produced by various species of streptococci enable the delineation of proteins into families in which sequences and overall structures are relatively well conserved. Horizontal gene transfer between strains of streptococci and duplication of genes encoding surface proteins have generated mosaics of structure and function. Despite high genetic identities of strains within species, it is clear that different isolates may express different complements of cell surface proteins. This results in considerable phenotypic heterogeneity between strains with respect to their abilities to adhere to surfaces, develop biofilms, and colonize the host.\n\nFrom a single cell deposited onto a surface in the human body, a mixed-species community may be developed within 24 h (Fig. ). The processes involved in colonization have been difficult to study in vivo. However, the advancement of molecular methods to determine the composition and spatial arrangement of microorganisms within communities has led to studies of oral biofilm development in situ (89). Also, with the introduction of live-animal imaging, it is possible to monitor the temporal and spatial course of colonization and infection (561). Adherence and colonization attributes have of course been studied mainly in the laboratory. Here, new technologies involving the use of flow cells to generate biofilms (58, 110) and multilayer differentiated host cell systems will enable fundamental studies of the role of cell surface proteins in adherence and host cell interactions. Some of these proteins may turn out to be candidates or provide epitopes for incorporation into new vaccines. In addition, since biofilm formation is in many instances associated directly with the development of infections and disease, new agents that interfere with or disrupt biofilms may be important for therapy or prevention.\n\nSTREPTOCOCCUS ADHERENCE\n\nCell Surface Components\n\nAdherence studies have featured throughout the research life of Streptococcus. From the early days of dental research, it was acknowledged that the attachment of S. mutans to oral surfaces, which are usually coated with salivary molecules, was an initial event in the development of dental caries. Likewise, it was observed that S. pyogenes cell surface molecules, including proteins and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), were important for the adherence of these organisms to cultured human cells (34) and to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (Fn). One of the first oral streptococcal surface protein antigens shown to be an adhesin was antigen I/II (AgI/II) (515). The nomenclature for this protein family is confusing and arose because two cell surface antigens, designated AgI and AgII, were initially identified and thought to be the products of distinct genes. However, AgII was found to be a breakdown product of the larger AgI (291). The breakdown of streptococcal surface proteins into discrete fragments is a typical property and continually hinders functional analysis in the laboratory. As interest in the molecular biology of Streptococcus extended, it became established that adherence was mediated principally by surface proteins. LTA plays a part in streptococcal interactions with human tissue components (116, 239) and indeed triggers Toll-like receptor 2 (232, 532, 536), but the precise mechanism by which LTA might be involved in adherence is still not entirely clear. In S. mutans, the production of insoluble extracellular polysaccharides is essential for biofilm formation. However, glucan polysaccharides do not mediate the initial adherence to the tooth surface unless glucan-binding proteins (GBPs) are present within the salivary pellicle (26).\n\nAdhesin-Receptor Interactions\n\nStreptococci colonize different sites in the human body because they express multiple adhesins. These are usually proteins that recognize specific receptors, often sugars or oligosaccharides, expressed at various body sites. The keratinized epithelial cells at the buccal mucosal surface display different receptors from, for example, those present within the salivary pellicle formed on the tooth surface. This provides selectivity for the adherence of different streptococcal species (272). Following initial adherence processes (Fig. ), bacteria will grow and survive only if the physical and chemical environment, e.g., pH, oxygen levels, and redox potential, is conducive. It is sometimes forgotten that adherence is a dynamic process. It may be advantageous for bacteria to detach from a surface if the growth conditions become unfavorable. As a result, streptococci have evolved methods for detachment as well as attachment.\n\nIn the development of a community, the initial adherence of single cells gives rise to microcolonies (Fig. ). This results in the formation of what has been termed a linking film (80). Cell division leads to the generation of a small society with the concomitant incorporation and accumulation of other bacterial cells to establish a community (Fig. ). In a dental plaque community, there may be over 100 different kinds of bacteria present (1). Multiple adhesive and metabolic interactions occur between bacterial cells in these communities. Appendages such as fimbriae (or pili), made up of multiple protein subunits (polymeric), are present on the surfaces of some streptococcal cells (see “Pili” below). These extended structures allow long-range adhesion to occur, sometimes across 5 μm, and may confer the ability to penetrate mucus or slime layers present on the surfaces of tissues. Shorter-range adherence processes occur through interactions of protein monomers or oligomers attached to the bacterial cell wall or membrane with host glycoproteins, e.g., integrins, or ECM proteins, e.g., Fn (431). Very close interactions between microbial cells and surfaces are mediated by hydrophobic or electrostatic forces. Collectively these can be quite strong, but generally they have low affinity (431).\n\nAdhesins may be proteins that are linked directly to the cell surface or components of surface structures, e.g., pili projected away from the confines of the cell wall. The protein subunits of pili may themselves mediate adherence, or they may carry the adhesins along their lengths or at their tips. The specificity of microbial adherence is often associated with protein-carbohydrate (lectin-like) reactions. Common sugars (saccharides) that are recognized include galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), sialic acid (neuraminic acid [NeuNAc]), fucose (Fuc), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and glucose (Glu). The recognition of Gal-containing carbohydrate chains or oligosaccharides is a common feature in oral microbial community development (306). On the other hand, the cell wall-anchored Hsa and GspB polypeptides in S. gordonii recognize NeuNAc residues on human cells (590), while the GBPs expressed by S. mutans attach to dextrans (26). Adherence processes may lead to one or more outcomes: commensal bacterial colonization, superficial infection of tissues, or intracellular invasion by pathogens and systemic spread.\n\nAdherence Forces\n\nIt is thought that the streptococcal cell surface presents a vast spectrum of proteins to the host environment. Complex arrays of molecules are present upon host surfaces, e.g., salivary pellicle and epithelia, etc., with which streptococcal cells interact. Therefore, adhesin-receptor interactions between Streptococcus and the host will be multiply mediated. Interactions may be lectin-like (as described above), but they may also involve protein-protein or carbohydrate-carbohydrate recognition events. Adherence may involve ionic or Coulombic interactions, hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect, or coordination involving divalent metal ions. These interactions differ quite considerably in their ranges and intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces can play important roles in protein-protein recognition when complementary shapes are involved. This is the case for adhesin-receptor recognition, where a lock-and-key fit yields extensive Van der Waals attractions. Hydrophobic side chains of proteins can closely associate and are shielded from interactions with solvent H2O. The force generating a hydrophobic bond is approximately 20 pN (488), while the forces required to maintain stereospecific lectin-CHO binding range from 50 to 120 pN (608). With the development of force spectroscopy, forces between cells or purified adhesins and individual molecules can be reasonably accurately determined (609). This methodology provides a new means for comparative analyses of adhesin-receptor interactions. Measurements of forces between microbial cells and their receptors, or of bacterial cell softness or viscoelasticity, provide novel biomechanical information on bacterial adhesins and cellular functions (619).\n\nA model for initial attachment envisages first a weak association of the microbial cell with substratum. For S. pyogenes, it has been suggested that LTA may counteract the electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and host surfaces. Alternatively, longer-distance first-attachment events (Fig. ) may be mediated through surface appendages such as fimbriae (or pili). The initial attachment events are dynamic in that they demonstrate an on-off kinetic effect. They may be rather weak electrostatic or ionic forces or strong hydrophobic interactions and involve multiple molecular forces (117). A second stage might then involve more specific and irreversible interactions occurring, e.g., lectin-carbohydrate or protein-protein interactions, which could be of higher affinity or high complexity and involve multiple adhesins. A two-step model has been proposed for the interaction of GAS with human cells (223). The first step would involve a weak hydrophobic interaction between LTA and potential binding domains on the host cell surface, while the second step might involve protein adhesins such as M protein, Fn-binding proteins, and laminin-binding proteins, etc., depending upon the receptors available. In general, the adherence mechanisms for streptococci follow the general paradigms for adherence in other bacteria quite closely. However, it should be emphasized that streptococci, like other gram-positive bacteria, present a potentially more vast and complex surface proteome than gram-negative bacteria. This highly advanced surface protein repertoire enables multiple interactions with different host components, and so streptococci have versatility when it comes to occupying adherence sites and evading immune recognition. This property of streptococci to engage multiple adhesin-receptor interactions with various affinities is one reason for the difficulties that have been encountered in the characterization of adhesins. For example, single-gene knockouts may reveal very little about adherence mechanisms, and antibodies generated to specific surface proteins may have little or no effect on streptococcal adherence.\n\nSurface Fibrillar Structures\n\nWhen viewed under an electron microscope, there are at least two types of filamentous structures that may be seen extending away from the streptococcal cell surface: fibrils and pili (otherwise known as fimbriae). Fibrils were first visualized in the 1970s and appeared as thin flexible rods of various lengths from 40 nm to about 400 nm. These structures have been best described for oral streptococci, including S. sanguinis and S. salivarius, and exhibit either a peritrichous (hair-like, all around the surface) distribution or localized distribution as tufts (214, 215). Clearly, the surface structures are important for growth and survival in the oral cavity because all freshly isolated streptococci show some form of surface structure (215). However, the composition of these structures remained unknown for many years, and precisely what controls their surface topography is still not explained. Recent evidence supporting a concept that there may be specific sites for the secretion of proteins through the cell membrane of streptococci (490, 506) might provide a future basis for understanding the lateral distribution of fibril tufts, composed of glycoproteins, observed in some strains of S. cristatus and S. mitis (265). Surface fibrils have been implicated in mediating adhesion to host cells and to ECM and salivary components (217), although direct evidence has been lacking because mutants have been hard to generate and because fibrillar proteins have been difficult to purify. Fibrils have also been implicated in facilitating interbacterial coaggregation (215, 217, 333, 650), but the composition and assembly of most of these fibrillar structures remain unknown. However, the CshA polypeptide (259 kDa) produced by S. gordonii has been identified as the structural and functional component of one fibril type (394) (Table ). The fibrils composed of CshA mediate attachment to immobilized Fn and to other oral bacteria. CshA-like proteins have also been found on the surfaces of S. oralis and S. sanguinis (148), on which they possibly function in a similar capacity. Also, serine-rich repeat (Srr) proteins have been characterized for several Streptococcus species (S. gordonii, S. sanguinis, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, and S. pneumoniae) (Table ). The Hsa (Srr) polypeptide forms surface fibrils in S. gordonii (588), while SrpA has been shown to comprise long (400-nm) fibrils in S. cristatus and to confer coaggregation capabilities (216). Because these fibrillar structures presumably confer a selective advantage to streptococci colonizing the host, perhaps initially by mediating adherence interactions, they are important to consider as potential targets for inhibitors or vaccines. Unfortunately, it has repeatedly proved technically challenging to identify the genes necessary for the production of these structures, except for the few instances described above. However, sequencing of Streptococcus genomes has thrown up a considerable number of surprises, not the least being the identification of pilus islands (PI) in the pyogenic group and recently in S. sanguinis. Studies of pili have been more fulfilling and provide much promise for the development of new protein vaccines.\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nProtein groupProtein(s)SpeciesCell surface linkagebFunction(s) and/or substrate(s)Reference(s)AgI/II familyaSpaP/P1/PAc/Sr/AgBS. mutansLPxTzCoaggregation;

Interestingly, while they have been reported for just two species of oral streptococci, S. parasanguinis and S. salivarius (166, 214), they have been found in the three major streptococcal human pathogens, namely, S. agalactiae (336), S. pyogenes (412), and S. pneumoniae (29) (Table ). The precise composition of S. salivarius pili remains to be defined, but the structural component of S. parasanguinis pili has been identified as a serine-rich repeat protein, designated Fap1 (652, 653). The genes encoding pili of the pathogenic streptococci are found in discrete loci, termed PI. To date, three PI have been identified for S. agalactiae (512), two have been identified for S. pneumoniae (23), and nine have been identified for S. pyogenes (157), with the latter occurring within the Fn-binding, collagen-binding, T-antigen (FCT) region that forms part of the Lancefield T-serotyping system. While the exact composition varies, each PI comprises genes that encode LPxTz family proteins, which are linked to cell wall peptidoglycan precursors via sortase cleavage between T and z (see below). These form the physical structure of the pilus and can be divided into the “backbone” subunit, which forms the shaft of the pilus, and one or two “ancillary” subunits, which appear intermittently. There are also genes encoding transpeptidase enzymes of the sortase C subfamily that function to polymerize the protein subunits (see reference 469 for a detailed model of pilus assembly). Much attention has recently been given to such pili, as the protein subunits have been shown to elicit protective immunity against the corresponding pathogen in mouse models of infection, making them potential vaccine candidates (187, 376, 412). Such strategies have particular promise for S. agalactiae, where pilus protein conservation across a large number of clinical isolates has been shown to be relatively high (383).\n\nPili have also been implicated as putative virulence factors. Using recombinant protein subunits or whole bacterial cells, pili have been associated with mediating adhesion to a wide variety of host epithelia including cells derived from the lungs, cervix, nasopharynx, tonsils, and intestine (2, 23, 139, 459). In addition to mediating cell attachment, pili of S. agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) have been shown to promote the invasion of human endothelial cells (377) and may facilitate paracellular translocation across the epithelial barrier (459). Immunomodulatory capabilities have also been associated with pili. Those of S. pneumoniae have been shown to promote inflammatory cytokine release (29), while S. agalactiae pili confer resistance to phagocytic killing (378). The pili of S. pyogenes promote bacterial aggregation via binding to the salivary component gp340, a process that may lead to increased bacterial clearance (145). Similarly, pili of S. parasanguinis were shown to bind salivary molecules adsorbed onto the surface of hydroxyapatite, an in vitro model of the tooth surface (153, 653).\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulties associated with their dissociation and purification, relatively little is known about the actual structures of pili. There have, however, been some recent breakthroughs. Advanced microscopy techniques, including atomic force and cryo-electron microscopy, have been utilized to visualize pneumococcal pili (156, 237). From these data, a model has been proposed in which protofilaments of backbone protein organize into coiled-coil structures to which “clusters” of ancillary proteins are attached intermittently (237). An ancillary protein component of S. agalactiae pili was crystallized (320) and was shown to have an IgG-rev fold. Such a conformation has been found in microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) of other gram-positive bacteria and contributes to the adhesive capabilities of these proteins. The crystal structure of a backbone subunit from S. pyogenes has also been resolved (287). From these data, backbone subunits were shown to organize into filamentous structures supported by sortase-catalyzed intermolecular bonds and by self-generated intramolecular isopeptide bonds. This organization has been proposed to stabilize the thin pilus structures, enabling them to withstand the tensile forces associated with adhesion to host tissues. Interestingly, sequence comparisons have identified similar intramolecular isopeptide bonds in other surface adhesins, including PFBP of S. pyogenes, FnbB of S. dysgalactiae, and Cna of Staphylococcus aureus (287).\n\nBackbone and ancillary subunits from each PI have been shown to elicit protective immunity against GBS in a neonatal mouse model of immunization (376, 383, 512), and a recent analysis of pilus distribution and conservation found that 94% of 289 clinical isolates expressed pili on their surface. Those studies also showed that a vaccine comprising just three pilus protein subunits could confer protection against 94% of GBS strains currently found in the United States and Italy (383). A pilus-based vaccine, therefore, has great potential for development as an effective universal vaccine against GBS disease.\n\nSortases\n\nMany streptococcal surface proteins are attached to the bacterial cell wall by membrane-associated transpeptidases of the sortase family (comprehensively reviewed in reference 384). These enzymes function by cleaving target proteins at a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal (CWSS), typically LPxTz, to form an acyl enzyme intermediate. This is then resolved by the nucleophilic attack of amino groups, often provided by the lipid II precursor of peptidoglycan, which is subsequently incorporated into the cell envelope via the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions of cell wall synthesis. Target proteins of sortases are initially expressed in a precursor form bearing at least two topogenic sequences: an N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal CWSS. The signal sequence directs the protein for translocation across the plasma membrane, typically via the Sec secretion system, until the CWSS is reached. At this point, the protein is held in the membrane by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids immediately downstream of the CWSS. The CWSS is then available for cleavage by the membrane-bound sortase, resulting in a protein that is exposed on the bacterial surface while securely embedded within the cell envelope.\n\nSortases have been found in virtually all gram-positive bacterial genomes available to date. Based on phylogenetic analyses, two recent studies have proposed their classification into either four (subfamilies A to D) or five (SrtA, SrtB, and families 3 to 5) subfamilies (109, 140). The sortase A (SrtA) subgroup contains the archetypal SrtA from Staphylococcus aureus, and virtually all gram-positive bacteria analyzed to date possess a single srtA gene. Often referred to as the “housekeeping” sortase, this enzyme typically anchors the majority of surface proteins with a CWSS expressed by a given bacterium. As such, SrtA target proteins are abundant and functionally diverse. The genes encoding SrtA-type enzymes are never proximal to their substrates, and SrtA enzymes show a preference for an LPxTG CWSS motif. Members of the sortase B (SrtB) subgroup can be found in a small number of gram-positive bacilli and cocci. The prototype SrtB is from S. aureus and acts upon IsdC, a protein involved in heme-iron acquisition. Similarly, the genes encoding other SrtB members occur in the same operon as their target proteins and are involved in iron uptake. SrtB enzymes possess three amino acid regions that are not present in SrtA, and the CWSS motifs recognized by SrtB include NPQTN (S. aureus), NPKSS (Listeria species), and NPKTG (Bacillus anthracis). The sortase C (SrtC) subgroup (or subfamily 3) has the highest number of members. Multiple copies of genes encoding SrtC are often found per genome, and they are frequently located adjacent to their substrates. As for SrtA, SrtC enzymes recognize the LPxTG CWSS motif, often followed by a second G residue, but act upon a much smaller group of proteins than SrtA. Furthermore, while SrtA has an N-terminal stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, similar to type I membrane proteins, SrtC enzymes have a hydrophobic C terminus that could act as the membrane anchor, as for type II membrane proteins. Members of this subgroup have recently been found in pathogenic streptococci including S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae. In these genomes, the srtC genes occur within loci that encode pili, putative virulence factors, and function to covalently link pilus protein subunits to form the filamentous pilus structure. Subfamily D sortases (or subgroups 4 and 5) have been found in bacilli, clostridia, and actinomycetales. Their target proteins often have enzymatic functions and are characterized by atypical CWSS motifs, including LPxTA and LAxTG.\n\nDespite extensive knowledge of the biochemical reactions that result in the covalent linkage of secreted polypeptides to the cell wall peptidoglycan, the control mechanisms operating on sortase-catalyzed linkage and on surface protein localization are not well understood. There is evidence for a membrane microdomain in S. pyogenes, enriched in anionic phospholipids, within which proteins such as SpeB (cysteine protease) are secreted and folded (507). This microdomain, termed the ExPortal, was suggested to be the primary cellular site for protein secretion, accumulating high concentrations of translocons of the general secretion (Sec) pathway in addition to accessory proteins, e.g., HtrA, necessary for postsecretion folding (506). Since, however, the localization patterns of surface proteins are quite distinct, there must be additional signals that play a role in targeting polypeptides to discrete sites. One such signal appears to be the leader peptide (signal sequence), which, in S. pyogenes, directs the secretion of proteins to different subcellular regions. The signal sequence of M protein directs secretion at the division septum, whereas that of PrtF preferentially promotes the secretion of this polypeptide at the old pole (85). In those studies, SecA was shown to be distributed throughout the periphery of S. pyogenes, thus arguing against evidence for a single ExPortal. More recently, evidence has been obtained to show that sortase is distributed to the new division septum, colocalizing with areas of M protein anchoring (490). This supports the notion that the sorting process is dynamic and linked closely with cell division. The control of sortase activity is also of interest, and it was suggested that the C-terminal peptide that remains as a result of sortase-catalyzed cleavage may play a subsequent role in modulating the expression or secretion of other proteins (J. Kreth, A. Khammanivong, Y. Lei, Y. Zhang, and M. C. Herzberg, presented at the International Association for Dental Research 85th General Session, New Orleans, LA, 21 to 24 March 2007). Overall, this area of study is of significant interest since the regulation of surface protein expression is closely linked to the ability of streptococci to colonize and invade tissues.\n\nSTREPTOCOCCUS ADHESINS\n\nThere are three ways in which streptococcal proteins may be held at the cell surface. First, they may be covalently anchored through the C terminus to the cell wall peptidoglycan. Second, they may be tethered to the cell membrane through N-terminal modifications with lipid (lipoproteins). Third, they may be retained on the cell surface, or bound back to the cell surface, through noncovalent interactions with cell surface components such as other proteins or polysaccharides. Many of the polypeptides listed in Table belong to the superfamily of gram-positive bacterial proteins that are linked to the cell wall. These contain a C-terminal motif, the consensus for which is LPxTz, followed by a hydrophobic region and a charged tail. The motif is recognized by sortase A, for which there is one gene on the streptococcal chromosome. Since it is thought that all C-terminal protein linkage to the cell wall peptidoglycan occurs through the activity of SrtA (see above), there must be strong evolutionary selection against mutation within srtA. Streptococci appear to differ considerably in the numbers of LPxTz proteins produced on their cell surfaces. Genomic analyses show that whereas there are 33 genes encoding potential cell wall-anchored proteins in S. sanguinis SK36, S. mutans UA159 has only 6, S. pyogenes M1 has 13, S. gordonii CH1 has 20, and S. agalactiae NEM316 has 21 (161, 194, 657). However, there is always some redundancy in cell wall protein genes, and within the 33 genes in S. sanguinis, there are 9 paralogous genes across three families (657). These observations underscore the notion that streptococci utilize different complements of adhesins in order to successfully colonize the host.\n\nCell Wall-Anchored Polypeptides\n\nMost of the adhesins listed in Table are of the LPxTz superfamily. These adhesins come in many sizes, designs, and potential conformations (e.g., α-helical, coiled coil, and β-sheet). Within the superfamily, there are proteins that seem to be assembled, at least in part, from a relatively defined range of modules that are related in primary sequence and in adherence functions. An overriding feature of these polypeptides is that they contain amino acid repeat blocks or motifs. These may be short sequences, for example, the five blocks of 14 amino acid (aa) residues making up the A repeats of the M6 protein (Fig. ), or highly repeated motifs, such as the 113 repeats of SASTSASVSASE in the S. gordonii Hsa protein (Fig. ). Alternatively, they may comprise much larger repeats, for example, the 13 repeat blocks of 101 aa residues within S. gordonii CshA (398). The genes encoding these polypeptides are highly subject to intragenic recombination, intergenic recombination, gene duplication, and point mutation as a result of host selective pressures. For example, 34 distinct alleles of the Fn-binding protein SfbI (Fig. ) have been found in 54 strains of S. pyogenes (610) as a result of horizontal gene transfer. The N-terminal aromatic-amino-acid-rich domain has a high degree of sequence variability, while the deletion or duplication of repeat units has resulted in variable numbers of proline-rich (P) repeats (1 to 11 repeats) and Fn-binding (Fnb) repeats (1 to 5 repeats) (Fig. ). This generates antigenic variation and also variable functional capabilities. Different lengths of repeat blocks also elicit different antibody repertoires (199), so lower-repeat-number variants with fewer epitopes might be able to escape antibodies generated to higher-repeat-number variants.\n\nThe structures of seven streptococcal cell wall-anchored proteins are depicted in Fig. . They have been selected to cover many of the different design features of streptococcal proteins. Each of the precursor proteins carries a leader (signal) peptide, usually about 30 to 40 aa residues in length but much longer (up to 90 aa residues) for some polypeptides, e.g., Hsa (Fig. ). These leader sequences direct the respective proteins to the primary Sec secretion apparatus or to an accessory secretion system (Sec2) dedicated to exporting specific subsets of proteins (499, 670).\n\nM proteins.\n\nGAS species are classified into 180 emm types based on the sequence of the hypervariable (N-terminal) region of the M protein. M protein typically consists of four repeat regions (Fig. ), the A repeats of which are hypervariable and the B repeats of which are semivariable. Physicochemical studies suggested that M proteins form entirely α-helical coiled-coil dimers and are in an extended conformation on the cell surface as hair-like projections (424). Secondary structure predictions indicated that the N-terminal regions are stabilized by antiparallel interactions, so this may contribute to cell-cell aggregation (174). Many of the hypervariable repeat regions from different M proteins bind human C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a plasma protein that inhibits complement activation (17), plasminogen, IgA, IgG, and factor H (389). The B repeats bind fibrinogen, human serum albumin (HSA), and IgG, while the C repeats bind factor H, HSA, and the membrane cofactor protein CD46 (188, 433). Different M proteins have the ability to interact only with various subsets of the human plasma proteins specified, and A and B repeats vary in most of the known GAS serotypes. Strong sequence similarities to the C repeats are found in Arp polypeptides (M-like proteins), but the so-called B repeats in Arp are not similar to those in M6 or other serotypes (Table ). Structural irregularities and instabilities throughout the coiled-coil structure of the M1 protein enhance fibrinogen binding, thus promoting proinflammatory and antiphagocytic activities (399). Soluble M1 protein released from S. pyogenes is a potent inducer of T-cell proliferation and the release of Th1-type cytokines. This leads to the suggestion that it is also a novel streptococcal superantigen contributing to excessive T-cell activation and inflammatory responses during invasive streptococcal infections (445). The pathological inflammatory response is believed to be enhanced by IgG antibodies to the C repeats (Fig. ), complexing with fibrinogen and activating FcgII receptors on neutrophils to release heparin-binding protein, resulting in vascular leakage (285).\n\nAgI/II polypeptides.\n\nMost indigenous streptococci found in the oral cavity express cell surface polypeptides of the AgI/II family. These have been shown to interact with multiple host environmental receptors such as collagen, Fn, laminin, and other oral microorganisms, e.g., Actinomyces naeslundii, S. oralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans (271). It was suggested, therefore, that these proteins contribute to initial adherence as well as to microbial community development. A major receptor for AgI/II family proteins is gp340, a highly glycosylated (∼25% carbohydrate) innate defense molecule produced at mucosal surfaces (466) and involved in the regulation of cellular immune responses (59) and epithelial differentiation (288). In the fluid phase, gp340 promotes bacterial aggregation and clearance, but when surface immobilized, it provides a receptor for streptococcal adherence (62). AgI/II polypeptides interact with gp340 oligosaccharides and with peptide backbone sequences (52, 263). The AgI/II polypeptides from oral streptococci contain between 1,310 and 1,653 aa residues, while the genes present in some strains of S. pyogenes and in S. agalactiae encode polypeptides in the range of 863 to 1,352 aa residues. The overall structure of AgI/II polypeptides from different streptococci is conserved, with ligand-binding domains assigned to alanine-rich (A) and central (V) regions and to a C-terminal region downstream of the proline-rich (P) region (Fig. ). The N-terminal region including the A repeats is predicted to form α-helical coiled-coil structures similar to M protein. The V region (approximately 370 aa residues in SpaP) is predicted to carry a lectin-like trench for carbohydrate binding (611). The P region carries repeats of 39 aa residues rich in proline and is essential for the secretion and stability of AgI/II (541). Adhesive and immunodominant epitopes of AgI/II have been identified and enabled the development of pilot synthetic peptide inhibitors of bacterial adherence. One of these, a synthetic 20-aa-residue peptide designated p1025, comprising 1,025 to 1,044 aa of AgI/II from S. mutans, blocks the binding of streptococci to gp340 (292). Epitopes within the A and P regions are in close proximity in native AgI/II (622), and so it is believed that the A and P regions interact to orientate the V region to bind oligosaccharides. Ag I/II-binding domains for P. gingivalis are discussed below (see Community Development).\n\nIg-binding proteins.\n\nA number of Ig-binding proteins (Table ) contribute to the ability of GAS to escape detection by the immune system. The proteins include M protein; the M-like proteins Enn, Mrp, and protein H; IgA receptor protein (Arp); streptococcal Ig receptor (Sir); streptococcal Ig-binding protein from GAS (SibA); and SfbI. All of these proteins contain leucine zipper motifs that consist of leucine residues spaced 6 or 7 aa residues apart. The Lzp protein is found in GAS and GBS and is a 66-kDa protein with 24 leucine zipper motifs and a signal peptide but no LPxTz motif. It reacts with light chains of human IgG and IgA and heavy chains of IgG and IgM. Protein H, SfbI, and Mrp bind only IgG, while Arp, Sir, and SibA bind IgA and IgG. Protein H has the highest affinity for IgG (1.6 × 10−9 M), while the affinity of Lzp for IgG is 5.5 × 10−8 M. Lzp binds several isotypic IgGs with high affinity and also binds to itself and forms multimers on the cell surface. Like protein H (173), Lzp binds a wide range of proteins (434). Protein G (Spg) (Fig. ) (57) and FOG (425) contribute to the accumulation of IgG on the surfaces of group C and group G streptococci. FOG has no homology to the IgG-binding sequences of protein G. Protein G binds all four IgG subclasses, while FOG does not bind IgG3. The interaction with protein G ablates the ability of IgG to bind C1q, thus preventing the activation of the classical pathway of complement. The alanine-rich E region of Spg (Fig. ) binds α2-macroglobulin, which is a protease inhibitor and immunoregulator. This occurs independently of IgG binding, and of HSA binding, to the three-α-helix-containing B1B2 region (Fig. ). The IgG-binding region of Spg is similar in sequence to the IgG-binding regions of the MIG and MAG proteins, but there is no homology toward the N terminus.\n\nThe S. equi M protein is known as fibrinogen binding protein and binds to the interdomain region of IgG Fc (350). The same regions are recognized by staphylococcal protein A and by protein G. The unrelated IgA-binding proteins Sir22 (GAS), beta-protein (GBS), and SSL27 from S. aureus all bind the Fc domain interface in human IgA (481).\n\nFn-binding proteins.\n\nFn-binding proteins are expressed by all streptococci (Table ), but the proteins differ in their binding affinities. Some are able to bind soluble Fn with high affinities in the nM range, while others appear not to be able to bind soluble Fn and attach only to Fn immobilized onto a surface (396). Most of the Fn-binding proteins are anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan through the LPxTz motif (Table ), although some are classed as anchorless adhesins (see below). The Fn-binding proteins attach bacteria to the ECM, which acts as a bridge between streptococci and host cells. There are at least 11 Fn-binding proteins in S. pyogenes (310), including SfbI (PrtF1) (Fig. ), protein F2 (PrtF2/FbaB/PFBP), serum opacity factor (SOF/SfbII), FbaA (601), and several different M proteins. The expression of Fn-binding proteins is highly regulated in response to environmental factors (312). The binding of Fn by these proteins is associated mainly with sequences within the amino acid repeat blocks toward the C-terminal end of the polypeptide (Fig. ). The numbers and sizes of these blocks vary between different proteins. SfbI contains four blocks of 37 aa residues, and they each contain the core consensus sequence ED(T/S)(X,7-10)GG(X,4)(I/V)(D/E)(F/I/T) for binding Fn, which is also found in many of the other proteins with Fn-binding repeats (Table ). However, regions upstream of the repeat blocks have been shown to be involved secondarily in binding Fn, and in SfbI, the upstream spacer region (Fig. ) is able to bind Fn when expressed as a separate polypeptide (593). The N-terminal aromatic domain of SfbI (Fig. ) may provide some specificity in the recognition of glycosylated receptors or carbohydrate repeat structures. The region has homology to an aromatic sequence comprising YG repeat blocks of approximately 20 aa residues found within the C-terminal repeating unit of glucosyltransferases (GTFs) (190). The YG repeats are also found in S. mutans GBPs (25), Clostridium difficile toxin, and the S. pneumoniae autolysin LytA. Polypeptides such as S. gordonii CshA, which bind only to immobilized Fn, do not contain the core consensus sequence (398). In addition, C5a peptidases of S. pyogenes (ScpA) and S. agalactiae (ScpB) (Fig. ) are able to bind Fn with high affinity (96, 595), but this is not associated with the protease cleavage site or with Fn-binding repeats (the repeats shown in Fig. are Fn type III domains). There is therefore still much to be learned about the molecular mechanisms involved in interactions of cell surface proteins with Fn and other ECM molecules.\n\nSerine-rich repeat polypeptides.\n\nSerine-rich repeat (Srr) glycoproteins have been found in oral streptococci, pathogenic streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli (Table ). These are characterized by containing multiple serine-rich repeats running through approximately 75% of the polypeptide. A unique N-terminal region is thought to be held out from the cell surface via a stalk-like structure generated by the O-glycosylated repeats (587). The Hsa polypeptide from S. gordonii DL1 (Fig. ) is one of two alleles encoding Srr proteins in this species, the other being GspB (41). Like all Srr proteins, Hsa contains two repeat regions, with the smaller repeat region at the N terminus being flanked by two nonrepeated regions. The latter are diverse, and the nonrepeat II region may be basic (Fig. ) or acidic (pI < 6.0). The pI value may be important in directing this region to binding host receptors. The B region in Hsa, GspB, and SrpA directs the recognition of sialic acid oligosaccharides (39, 460) found on epithelial cells, platelets, and salivary glycoproteins. Isogenic mutants in Srr protein genes are correspondingly deficient in adherence to host cells (261) and the salivary pellicle (653). The Srr protein genes are found at loci containing additional genes encoding glycosylation enzymes and an alternative secretion system. There is a core region of seven genes that are conserved in every genome that contains an Srr protein gene (670). The rest of the locus contains genes encoding glycosyltransferases, but these genes may also be at other sites on the chromosome. The diversity of glycosyltransferases produced across streptococci ensures that glycolytic modifications to these proteins are structurally and antigenically distinct. The presence of an alternative secretion system (SecA2) has also sparked interest in novel export functions, with evidence that the glycosylation of Fap1 in S. parasanguinis is linked to secretion and that the Sec2 system in Listeria monocytogenes is associated with the secretion of virulence factors and of proteins like superoxide dismutase that do not possess conventional signal sequences (18, 499). Interestingly, while genes encoding Srr proteins have been identified for a wide range of streptococci (Table ), they have not yet been found for S. pyogenes. Clearly, the selection pressures for the retention of a locus of approximately 20 kb encoding a surface protein and a dedicated secretion and modification system must be high, suggesting that the expression of Srr polypeptides by oral streptococci and GBS must be critical to their successful colonization.\n\nCollagen-like proteins.\n\nCollagen-like proteins are characterized by carrying a conserved collagen-like region and a hypervariable N-terminal portion (484). There are two genes encoding collagen-like proteins in S. pyogenes, designated SclA (Scl1) and SclB (Scl2) (Table ). The transcription of sclA is upregulated by the transcriptional regulator Mga, while sclB is downregulated. In addition, slipped-strand mispairing at sites containing pentanucleotide noncoding repeats leads to phase variation of SclB (483). Orthologs of these genes have not been found in any of the Streptococcus genomes sequenced to date, except S. equi (closely related to S. pyogenes). The collagen-like sequences are comprised of Gxy triplet amino acid residue motifs, and there are 50 of these contiguous repeats in SclA (Fig. ) (369). The noncollagenous globular domain of SclA binds factor H (87) and apolipoprotein B, a component of low-density lipoprotein (210). The collagen-like region has the functional properties of human collagen, interacting with α2β1 integrin and activating intracellular signaling pathways (248). Interestingly, proteins containing the collagen-like sequences (Gxy triplet motif) are found in S. pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, and Haemophilus species. This suggests that this is a well-conserved sequence distributed widely across bacteria, possibly providing extension, flexibility, and additional functionality to surface protein modules.\n\nPeptidases.\n\nA number of hydrolytic enzymes such as glycanases, glycosidases, proteinases, and peptidases are secreted by streptococci. Some of these carry the LPxTz motif for covalent cell wall anchorage, and some do not and are released into the environment (Tables and ). A dipeptidase from S. gordonii is secreted and released but carries no signal peptide (195). Clearly, there is still a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein secretion in streptococci. Also, it is apparent from genomic sequencing data that there are numerous genes encoding LPxTz polypeptides with potential proteolytic activities based on homology searches, which are yet to be characterized. However, GAS and GBS both produce a C5a peptidase (Scp), a cell wall-anchored LPxTz protein that specifically inactivates complement factor C5a (Fig. ). This factor is normally a chemotactic peptide that attracts polymorphonuclear neutrophils, which are critical for phagocytosis. Scp is a subtilisin-like protease with a 68-aa-residue prosequence that must be removed to produce active Scp (Fig. ). The PA domain is shared by other proteases such as the Lactococcus cell wall-associated protease, and there are three Fn type III repeats in the C-terminal region. It is thought that the Pro- and Gly-rich sequences within these repeats are α-helical and could push the protein and active-site region out from the cell surface. Two RGD (integrin recognition) sequences could interact with cellular receptors and increase Scp activity through conformational changes (70).\n\nTABLE 2.\n\nProtein groupProtein(s)SpeciesFunction(s) and/or substrate(s)Reference(s)Glucosyltransferases (secreted)GtfB, GtfC, GtfDS. mutansGlucan synthesis26, 533, 659GtfB, GtfPS. sanguinis244, 657GtfGS. gordonii628GtfI, GtfS, GtfT, GtfUS. sobrinus192, 211, 212, 420, 519GtfRS. oralis175GtfJ, GtfK, GtfL, GtfMS. salivarius189, 191, 553Fructosyltransferases (secreted)SacB/FtfS. mutansFructan synthesis6FtfS. salivarius487Hemolysins (secreted)Hemolysin IIIS. mutansErythrocytes6, 407CylES. agalactiae468SLO, SLSS. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae13, 51, 575Other degradative enzymes (secreted)DNase A-DNase DS. pyogenesDNA13HyaluronidaseS. pyogenes, S. pneumoniaeHyaluronic acid236, 482EndoSS. pyogenesEndoglycosidase, IgG108SpeBS. pyogenesIgG (cleavage)108Toxins (secreted)SMEZ, SMEZ-2, SMEZ-3S. pyogenesSuperantigens182, 286, 470SSAS. pyogenes14, 410SpeA, SpeC, SpeG, SpeH, SpeI, SpeJ, SpeK, SpeL, SpeMS. pyogenes14, 407, 470NADaseS. pyogenesNAD+-glycohydrolase; promotes survival and proliferation66PneumolysinS. pneumoniaeCytolysis107Other secreted factorsStreptokinase (Ska)S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiaePlasminogen379, 407MacS. pyogenesInhibits opsonophagocytosis; CD11b, CR3339, 407SICS. pyogenesInhibits complement-mediated lysis9Sg-xPDPPS. gordoniiX-prolyl dipeptidyl-peptidase195TransportersPiuBCDA/PiaABCDS. pneumoniaeFe71, 73FhuBDGCS. pneumoniaeFe467PitADBCS. pneumoniaeFe72FtsABCDS. pyogenesFe218SiaABC/HtsABCS. pyogenesFe32, 340SiuADBGS. pyogenesFe411SsaCBAS. sanguinisFe177, 270PsaABCDS. pneumoniaeMn522MtsABCS. pyogenes, S. agalactiaeMn, Fe, Zn, Cu63, 267, 268ScaCBAS. gordoniiMn303, 304, 647FimCBAS. parasanguinisMn160, 270, 430SloABCRS. mutansMn, Fe299, 446AdcRCBAS. pneumoniae, S. gordonii, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. mitis, S. mutansMn, Zn134, 365CopYAZS. gordonii, S. mutans, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. sobrinus, S. mitisCu408, 494, 624PstSCABS. pneumoniaePhosphate429FruRKIS. mutans, S. gordonii, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. mitisFructose38, 364FxpABCS. mutans, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniaeFructose, xylitol38LacABCDFES. mutansLactose511ScbCBAS. cristatusUnknown111BfrCD, BfrEFGS. gordoniiBiofilm formation669BfrCD, BfrXYS. sanguinisBiofilm formation669SilDES. pyogenesVirulence151, 235OppABCDFS. pyogenesVirulence461, 637HppABCDFS. gordoniiAdhesion, coaggregation397\n\nAnchorless Adhesins\n\nThe majority of streptococcal surface proteins anchor through their C termini via an LPxTz motif. There are, however, a small group of proteins that bind to the cell surface but possess no recognized anchor. Such proteins also frequently lack an N-terminal signal sequence. The mechanism by which these so-called “anchorless adhesins” are exported from the cytoplasm to the cell surface is not understood. However, many can be removed by chaotropic agents (129), implying that they are likely bound to the cell surface through less-defined charge or hydrophobic interactions.\n\nThe anchorless adhesins have not been grouped together as a family in Table because they are structurally and functionally diverse and have a wide range of adherence properties. A large proportion of the anchorless adhesin family comprises proteins with enzymatic functions. Five of the streptococcal anchorless adhesins identified to date are glycolytic enzymes typically found in the cytosol, namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), α-enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, and triosephosphate isomerase (298, 447). Of these, GAPDH and α-enolase are the best characterized. α-Enolase is the major plasmin- and plasminogen-binding protein of streptococci (Table ), although it has also been associated with binding to mucin MG2 for S. mutans (180). Plasminogen can be converted following cleavage by plasminogen activators to the serine protease plasmin. This in turn can degrade ECM proteins. Thus, surface-associated plasmin has been proposed to facilitate bacterial invasion and dissemination through epithelial barriers.\n\nGAPDH (variously named SDH and Plr in GAS) has been described for several species of Streptococcus (Table ) and exhibits binding to a broad spectrum of extracellular targets, including the matrix proteins plasmin, plasminogen, Fn, and fibrinogen. Given its multiple binding specificities, GAPDH is therefore likely to make a significant contribution to the colonization capabilities of streptococci. Furthermore, GAPDH has been shown to interact with the pharyngeal cell cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin (447, 540) and with urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (277), factors that may contribute to the modulatory effects of GAPDH in triggering host cell internalization by GAS (as described elsewhere). In addition to their adhesive and glycolytic functions, another interesting property of the five anchorless enzymes described above is that they function as a complex in the production of ATP (164). This has important implications for host modulatory effects, as extracellular ATP is able to bind P2X7 receptors on the surface of immune and epithelial cells and induce apoptosis (135, 660). Thus, an ability to produce extracellular ATP on the cell surface provides an opportunity for streptococci to manipulate host cell behavior and, potentially, the progression of infection.\n\nOther enzymes within the anchorless adhesin family include GtfG, SpeB, and HtrA. GtfG of S. gordonii is a GTF responsible for the synthesis of α-1,3- and α-1,6-linked glucans. Similar to GTFs of other streptococci (Table ), GtfG is secreted, but a proportion of this protein has been shown to bind back to the cell surface via its C terminus (626). The regulator Rgg (see below) controls gtfG transcription, and levels of cell-associated GtfG have been shown to influence S. gordonii adhesion to host surfaces and dispersal (626). SpeB is a potent cysteine protease known to play a significant role in GAS virulence, being able to degrade host proteins and activate interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Originally identified as a secreted product, SpeB was also found to become associated with the cell surface, possibly via its propeptide moiety (251). In this form, SpeB mediates adhesion to glycoproteins and the ECM component laminin, functions that may promote the colonization capabilities of GAS. HtrA is also a protease and has been found in a number of streptococci (Table ). Unlike SpeB, however, HtrA is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane via a single, hydrophobic transmembrane domain located near the N terminus (463). HtrA is a serine protease, and homologs in other bacteria serve to degrade abnormal exported proteins in response to environmental stresses (297). A similar role is proposed for streptococci, as the deletion of htrA in S. mutans altered its ability to withstand environmental stresses (temperature, pH, and oxidative stress) (131), while in GAS, the biogenesis of secreted virulence factors was affected (371).\n\nAside from enzymatic capabilities, other members of the anchorless adhesin family share an ability to bind ECM proteins and so promote adhesion to host tissues via an ECM protein bridge. One of the first such adhesins to be reported was Fn/fibrinogen-binding protein Fbp54 in GAS (114). Homologs in a number of other streptococci have since been discovered, exhibiting high percent identities: FbpA in S. gordonii (81%), PavA in S. pneumoniae (70%), and SmFnB in S. mutans (70%). All have been shown to adhere directly to immobilized Fn (Table ), although FbpA also exerts its effects through the modulation of CshA expression, another Fn-binding adhesin of S. gordonii (102). The role of these adhesins in streptococcal colonization is implied by the fact that an N-terminal fragment of Fbp54 can impair GAS adhesion to buccal epithelial cells (112), while PavA was shown to be essential for virulence in a mouse model of pneumococcal sepsis (241). A further Fn-binding anchorless adhesin identified in GAS is Shr (165). Unlike Fbp54, this 145-kDa protein bears an N-terminal signal peptide and is predicted to be anchored to the cell membrane via a transmembrane domain at its C terminus. Shr binds myoglobin and hemoglobin and is thought to mediate heme acquisition through the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type SiaABC transporter (32). Shr also binds laminin and Fn but does not contain Fn-binding repeat blocks or the Fn-binding consensus motif (see above).\n\nTwo further anchorless adhesins of GAS that adhere to Igs have been described, Sib35 and Lzp. Both possess an N-terminal signal sequence, but whereas Lzp has five C-terminal hydrophobic regions that are predicted to hold it within the cell membrane, no such domains exist in Sib35. Sib35 exhibits adhesion to human IgG, IgA, and IgM (289) and has been shown to act as a mitogen, triggering proliferation and differentiation of mouse B cells (435).\n\nIn summary, the anchorless adhesins complement the functions of cell wall-anchored adhesins because they provide positional as well as functional flexibility. They have the potential to act as scouts in the inevitable battle between bacteria and host defenses. They could be released from the cell surface to sense the environment and may be bound back to the cell surface, perhaps in complex with their ligands. The possibility exists, therefore, that they may represent a mechanism for feeling the environmental waters, interacting with host molecules at a distance and with a surface dispensability that cannot be achieved through activities of cell wall-anchored adhesins.\n\nHost Cell Modulation\n\nReceptor recognition by bacterial surface adhesins is an essential step in mediating attachment to host tissues. It is increasingly evident, however, that these events can also trigger host cell signaling cascades and so modulate host cell behavior. In many cases, the precise sequence of signaling events triggered by streptococci remains to be defined. Nonetheless, the outcomes of streptococcal host cell modulation can be grouped into three general categories: (i) internalization of streptococci by host cells, (ii) induction of cytokine release, and (iii) induction of apoptosis.\n\nInternalization.\n\nA common property shared by host cells and a number of streptococcal adhesins is the ability to bind ECM proteins. For mammalian cells, this is often facilitated by integrin receptors. Integrins are a large family of αβ heterodimeric glycoproteins that regulate diverse cellular processes including cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion. To date, 18 α and 8 β subunits that combine to form 24 distinct heterodimers, each with various affinities for ECM proteins, have been identified (249). Using common ECM protein ligands as bridging molecules, several streptococci have been found to interact with integrins and exploit their signaling pathways to promote their own adhesion, colonization, and invasion. One of the best-characterized examples of this is signaling via Fn-binding integrin α5β1 by GAS, a process that leads to GAS internalization by nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Two Fn-binding adhesins of GAS are principally associated with this process, SfbI and M protein, and trigger distinct uptake mechanisms (refer to reference 426 for a comprehensive review of this process). SfbI interacts with the N terminus of Fn, which in turn binds integrin α5β1 via its RGD motif. Interactions with multiple Fn molecules leads to integrin clustering and the formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions, which contain numerous signaling and structural components linked to the host cytoskeleton. These are the sites of activation for two independent signaling pathways. One requires tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin and involves the Src kinases Src, Yes, and Fyn. The second requires the recruitment and activation of the GTPases Rac and Cdc42. These pathways then ultimately converge to trigger the formation and fusion of caveolae beneath the attached bacteria, resulting in large invaginations via which GAS species are internalized (441) (Fig. ).\n\nM protein also interacts with integrin α5β1 via a Fn bridge, but the subsequent downstream signaling events differ from those triggered by SfbI. The reason for this variation is not fully understood, but as SfbI and M protein interact with different domains of Fn, it has been postulated that this may affect the way in which Fn binds to integrin, which in turn may influence subsequent signaling events. For M protein, major cytoskeletal rearrangements are triggered, and this is dependent upon the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (472). This activates a classic endocytotic pathway, the result of which is the recruitment and fusion of microvilli around the streptococcal cells and their uptake via a zipper-like mechanism (137). Rather than caveolae, bacteria ingested by this pathway ultimately enter phagolysosomes, as characterized by the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (137). Similar entry mechanisms are also utilized by GBS (79, 620) and S. dysgalactiae (82).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that adhesins that bind ECM proteins are not the only mediators of streptococcal host cell invasion. GAS strain A8, which lacks Fn-binding capabilities, has been shown to trigger its uptake in a Fn- and α5β1 integrin-independent manner (409), although details of the surface proteins and signaling networks in this process remain to be defined. Furthermore, both SDH (GAPDH) (Table ) and hyaluronic acid capsular polysaccharide (CPS) have been shown to promote GAS internalization. SDH-mediated invasion triggers a series of signaling events following adhesion to two pharyngeal membrane proteins, one outcome of which is the phosphorylation of nuclear core histone H3 (449). In contrast, CPS signals via keratinocyte receptor CD44 to induce membrane ruffling, a process that requires the activation of Rac1 and the cytoskeleton linker protein ezrin (123). Rather than leading to direct host cell invasion, the latter mechanism disrupts intercellular junctions, allowing the passage of GAS to underlying tissues via a paracellular route. This alternative method of promoting streptococcal dissemination has also been described for GBS and is associated with pilus expression (459, 564).\n\nInvasion may enable bacteria to translocate or disseminate to other parts of the host, but there is growing evidence that an ability to enter nonphagocytic cells may also provide bacteria with an increased opportunity for survival. Once internalized, bacteria are protected against host innate immune defenses and antibiotic therapies, and this is thought to explain, at least in part, the recurrence of some GAS infections (439). The notion of host cells as a reservoir of bacteria has implications not only for pathogens but also for commensal microorganisms. Rudney et al. (514) demonstrated that an extensive polymicrobial flora can be found within buccal epithelial cells, a large proportion of which corresponds to commensal streptococci. This implies that commensals are also able to become internalized, and the commensal S. gordonii was shown to trigger its internalization by HEp-2 epithelial cells via an interaction of its SspA and SspB (AgI/II family polypeptides) with integrin α5β1 (427).\n\nCytokine release.\n\nProinflammatory responses resulting from de novo or increased cytokine synthesis are a frequent outcome of streptococcal interactions with a range of host cells. These can significantly influence the progression of disease by affecting a number of processes including immune cell infiltration, tissue inflammation, and tissue damage. In some cases, the streptococcal triggers are known and include both cell-bound adhesins and secreted factors. One powerful inducer of inflammation is the GAS M protein. This has been shown to trigger the release of the cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) following recognition by Toll-like receptor 2 on the surface of monocytes (444). In S. mutans, rhamnose glucose polymers, GTFs, and AgI/II polypeptides have been shown to induce IL-6 and IL-8 release from epithelial, endothelial, and T cells (12, 97, 625). For the AgI/II proteins, this process is associated with binding to integrin α5β1 and the activation of FAK, paxillin, and phospholipase Cγ, fundamental components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (12). In contrast, S. gordonii was found to inhibit the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from epithelial cells (222), a phenomenon that may contribute to the ability of this organism to persist in the oral cavity as a commensal. Interestingly, S. gordonii and other oral streptococci were also shown to suppress the IL-8 release normally induced by the opportunistic periodontopathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum (664), providing insight into how the presence of such commensals might promote a “healthy” oral environment (273). Aside from proinflammatory effects, cytokine release may also influence mechanisms such as streptococcal invasion, as described above. Interactions of GAS with epithelial cells and tonsillar fibroblasts have been shown to trigger the production of transforming growth factor β1 (635). This is a multifunctional cytokine and a positive regulator of integrin signaling, upregulating several proteins including FAK, paxillin, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. GAS-mediated transforming growth factor β1 release was found to upregulate integrin α5 expression (635). Thus, GAS is able to manipulate host cytokine production to increase levels of expression of target receptors and so promote its own adherence and internalization.\n\nApoptosis.\n\nApoptosis is often considered a host strategy for clearance of infection by eliminating infected cells and removing potential targets for adhesion and internalization. However, the ability to induce apoptosis may be beneficial to bacteria, enabling escape from phagocytic activity or damaging host tissues and so promoting deeper penetration and dissemination. There are two main pathways via which mammalian cells commit to apoptosis. The first results from the deregulation of mitochondrial function. Cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, where it binds APAf-1 and cleaves procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which in turn activates caspase-3 (intrinsic apoptosis). Alternatively, the ligation of death receptors such as CD95 and TNF receptors on the cell surface leads to the cleavage of procaspase-8. This then cleaves procaspase-3, leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death (extrinsic apoptosis). Bacterial components with proapoptotic effects can be broadly differentiated into four groups: (i) superantigens, (ii) pore-forming toxins, (iii) nonenzymatic structural components, and (iv) metabolic end products (comprehensively reviewed in reference 614). Knowledge of apoptosis regulation by streptococci is limited but has been best studied for pathogenic species, including GAS and GBS.\n\nGAS induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including neutrophils (301), macrophages (323), and epithelial cells (416, 417, 612), and can activate both pathways. Extrinsic apoptosis can be attributed in part to the activities of SpeB, which has been shown to activate matrix metalloproteinases on the surface of mammalian cells and trigger TNF-α and Fas ligand release (594). Alternatively, interactions of GAS with epithelial cells induce caspase-9 activation, cytochrome c release, and Bax translocation to the mitochondria (416, 417). These events are associated with intrinsic apoptosis and are dependent upon SfbI-mediated internalization (416), as described previously. The GAS-secreted toxin NADase has also been shown to promote the apoptosis of keratinocytes in conjunction with the hemolysin streptolysin O (SLO). SLO forms pores in the cell membrane, and NADase enters the cell through these pores and exerts its effects (66). Similarly, the hemolysin CylE of GBS triggers the apoptosis of macrophages, but the mechanism is not yet understood (163). It should be noted, however, that not all modulatory effects lead to enhanced host cell apoptosis. For example, GBS infection of HeLa cells has been shown to trigger prosurvival signaling events and protection against caspase-3 cleavage (79). It seems, therefore, that a delicate balance exists between the pro- and antiapoptotic effects of streptococci upon host cells and that this can significantly influence disease progression. By promoting apoptosis, bacteria can escape phagocytic killing and enhance their dissemination, while apoptosis inhibition can allow bacteria to create an intracellular refuge and so persist in the host.\n\nPlatelet Interactions\n\nThe adherence of streptococci to platelets is thought to be crucial for the colonization of damaged heart valves, which may result in the life-threatening condition infective endocarditis (IE). Streptococci that can induce platelet activation, and the resulting thrombus formation, are believed to play a role in disseminated intravascular coagulation by causing increased platelet and clotting factor consumption (Fig. ). Interactions of streptococci with platelets usually occurs by direct binding to platelets via streptococcal surface proteins (293). It may also occur indirectly via streptococci binding a plasma-bridging molecule, such as fibrinogen (171), engaged with a platelet surface receptor. Bacteria may activate platelets or simply adhere to them, suggesting that platelet adherence and activation are separate events that are perhaps mediated by different bacterial and platelet components.\n\nViridans group streptococci including S. sanguinis, S. oralis, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. parasanguinis, and S. gordonii (31) have long been recognized as major etiological agents of IE. They gain entry to the vascular system via the oral cavity, and their adherence to platelets is thought to be pivotal to pathogenic potential (234). Components of streptococci involved in colonization and virulence in IE include lipoproteins, polysaccharides, and LPxTz-anchored proteins. The lipoproteins shown to be virulence factors in IE are FimA from S. parasanguinis and SloC from S. mutans. These are divalent metal ion-binding proteins of ABC transport systems for the uptake of Mn2+ or Fe2+/Fe3+ (430, 446). S. mutans mutants that do not produce extracellular glucan show decreased virulence in rat models of endocarditis (414). Moreover, the serotype-specific cell wall polysaccharides from S. mutans comprised of rhamnose-glucose polymers induce platelet aggregation in the presence of plasma (98).\n\nThe Srr proteins (see above) SrpA (460) and GspB/Hsa (39) have been identified as recognizing sialyl-T antigen found on platelet integrin GPIbα. GspB/Hsa are strain specific to S. gordonii and have been shown to induce platelet adherence by interacting with sialic acid residues on the sialomucin core and the N terminus of GPIbα, respectively (39, 588). They act in concert with the AgI/II polypeptides SspA (172 kDa) and SspB (164 kDa) (427) to aggregate platelets (261). The M1 protein of S. pyogenes triggers thrombus formation by forming complexes with fibrinogen, which, in the presence of IgG against M protein, engage the Fc receptor on platelets and activate them (545). This leads to platelet aggregation and the formation of platelet-rich thrombi. Streptococci thus utilize a range of different components and mechanisms for adherence to, and activation of, platelets. It is important to decipher further the molecular mechanisms involved in Streptococcus-induced thrombus formation so that potential new targets for the prevention of IE or disseminated intravascular coagulation may be identified.\n\nSTREPTOCOCCUS SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT\n\nAfter the first encounter of Streptococcus with a surface, and adherence to that surface, the bacterial cells may begin to multiply if the environmental conditions are favorable. A small society of streptococci can then form, sometimes referred to as a linking film, and provides a new surface onto which other bacteria may deposit (Fig. ). Alternatively, some species may attach but become internalized before a linking film can develop. Within the society, cell-cell signaling ensures coordinated growth and development, while the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes provides new nutrients, and polysaccharide formation promotes the retention and accumulation of streptococci (Fig. ). All these activities occurring within the society are central to the overall colonization processes, which may then lead to carriage, to the formation of mixed-species communities, or on to infection.\n\nBiofilm Formation\n\nDental plaque, comprising many hundreds of bacterial species, is the best example of a natural biofilm in the human body. Complex biofilms are also formed on the intestinal linings and on the mucosal surfaces of the vagina, but these biofilms are conceptually different for this article because they do not generally incorporate commensal streptococci. Single-species biofilms (biofilm societies) may occur in some instances in nature, such as in the colonization of prosthetic implants by Staphylococcus epidermidis or of the middle ear by S. pneumoniae. However, many studies of single-species biofilm formation, although providing information on the growth of the organisms as sessile societies, do not truly represent the biofilm communities encountered in vivo, where there is intense competition as well as metabolic synergism among many microbial species. S. mutans, S. gordonii, and other oral streptococci readily form single-species biofilms in the laboratory on a variety of surfaces, and biofilm formation is dependent upon activities of multiple genetic loci (Fig. ), as discussed below. Thus, mutations in genes encoding components of quorum-sensing systems, e.g., comCDE (354); TCSS, e.g., vicRK (543); GBPs (370); and metal ion permeases (503) can impair S. mutans biofilm formation. Optimal biofilm formation by S. gordonii and S. sanguinis also requires multiple gene products including sortase (428) and proteins involved with β-glucoside metabolism and carbon catabolite control (296, 364), nucleotide biosynthesis (181), oxidative stress (322, 363), and environmental sensing and signaling (193). The growth of non-mitis-group streptococci as biofilms is only just beginning to be studied, but the complexities of M serotypes, capsular serotypes, and the expression of pilus types and antigenically variable surface proteins will probably make interpretations of the molecular pathways involved extremely difficult. Already, it is clear that strains of S. pyogenes encompassing clinically important serotypes behave very differently and quite unpredictably in biofilm formation (341). Pili (382), M protein, and streptococcal protective antigen (Spa) (115) are some factors that have been implicated, but the complements of surface components required for biofilm development may turn out to be strain and serotype specific. Interestingly, the inactivation of the regulator Srv in S. pyogenes results in the upregulation of the cysteine protease SpeB and a significant decrease in biofilm formation (136). Thus, it is possible that the production of SpeB may be associated with a transition from a colonizing to an invasive phenotype.\n\nPolysaccharide Production\n\nThe production of extracellular polysaccharides by oral streptococci plays a key role in the development of biofilms and dental plaque (Fig. ). The accumulation of S. mutans is enhanced through the binding of extracellular glucans by cell surface-associated GBPs (Table ). GTFs and fructosyltransferases are enzymes secreted by viridans group streptococci (Table ) that are responsible for the synthesis of glucans and fructans. There are three genes encoding GTFs in S. mutans, designated gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD. The GtfB enzyme (162 kDa) synthesizes a water-insoluble glucan comprised of α1-3-linked glucose (Glc) residues, GtfC (149 kDa) produces a low-molecular-mass partly water-soluble glucan, and GtfD (155 kDa) synthesizes a water-soluble glucan. Sucrose induces the expression of gtfB, while Glc and fructose repress it (246, 646) at acidic pHs, possibly through the activity of the RegM transcriptional regulator (similar to catabolite control protein A) (74). The GBPs help determine the architecture of the biofilm, with GbpC being the principal glucan receptor (370). The transcriptional regulator CovR represses gbpC (53) as well as gtfB and gtfC (55). The water-insoluble glucans contribute to adherence and society formation, while the water-soluble glucans are akin to trapped nutrient supplies, which are readily degraded into metabolizable sugars by extracellular or cell-bound dextranases (Fig. ).\n\nA large amount of work carried out over the last few decades has confirmed that colonization and dental caries production by S. mutans in rodents fed high-sucrose diets depend upon the synthesis of water-insoluble glucans. However, it is clear that the polysaccharide-synthesizing enzyme products of all four genes gtfBC, gtfD, and ftf are involved in eliciting dental caries (415). The GTFs secreted by oral streptococci contain a common four-domain structure: a signal (leader) peptide of 36 to 38 aa residues, followed by a nonconserved region (200 aa residues), a highly conserved catalytic domain (800 aa residues), and a C-terminal region of approximately 500 aa residues that binds glucans. The latter regions are composed of a series of YG repeats, each of which comprises a 21-aa-residue sequence with one or more aromatic residues (190). The YG repeats are present in regular arrays within GtfB, GtfC, GtfD, and GtfI (S. downei), etc., and have arisen from multiple duplication events, with evidence for a functional selection of conserved residues for carbohydrate binding.\n\nThe virulence of S. pyogenes correlates closely with the expression of hyaluronic acid CPS. Heavily capsulated strains are spread more readily, while capsule production is repressed during carriage. The upregulation of capsule during systemic infection protects S. pyogenes from opsonophagocytosis and masks other immunogenic determinants on the cell surface, constituting a mechanism for the evasion of antigen-specific antibodies (133). The biosynthesis of the capsule is directed by the hasABC gene cluster (20), and there is evidence that the antimicrobial protein human cathelicidin LL-37, perhaps with other signals from the host, may trigger increased CPS production through the CsrRS TCSS (202).\n\nA major factor contributing to the virulence of S. agalactiae is the polysaccharide capsule. It is composed of repeating units of Glc, Gal, GlcNAc, and NeuNAc (sialic acid), and variations in saccharide linkages and composition result in the designation of nine capsular serotypes to date. All GBS capsule types share a terminal NeuNAc that is similar to the sialic acid on human cells. It has been envisaged that this may play a role in resistance to complement-mediated killing by binding factor H, as well as binding CD33rSiglecs on neutrophils and macrophages to exert suppressive effects on the innate immune system (84). The oral streptococci S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and S. gordonii also express antigenically diverse cell wall polysaccharides on their cell surfaces that contain the host-like recognition motifs GalNAcβ1→3Gal or Galβ1→3GalNAc (103). These are receptor polysaccharides for the fimbrial lectins of Actinomyces naeslundii in the development of oral microbial communities, but the host glycoconjugate-like features of the receptor polysaccharides suggest that they may also be involved in the evasion of the secretory immune response by oral streptococci.\n\nTwo-Component Signal Transduction Systems\n\nTo successfully colonize and persist within the host, bacteria must adapt their gene expression profiles in response to environmental changes. Streptococci utilize two main types of transcriptional regulators: TCSS and stand-alone regulators (see below). TCSS (more formally known as histidine-aspartate phosphorelay systems) comprise two signaling proteins: a sensor kinase, which is anchored to the cell membrane, and a cognate response regulator found within the cytoplasm. Sensor kinases typically possess a highly variable N-terminal sensor region, containing one to several transmembrane domains, and a more conserved C terminus, containing the kinase and transmitter domains. Comparative analyses across the sensor kinase family have identified five amino acid motifs (or boxes) within the C-terminal region, named after the most conserved residue (H, N, D, F, and G). Response regulator proteins can be divided into an N-terminal region, which carries a highly conserved “receiver” domain, and the C-terminal “effector” domain, which often exhibits DNA-binding capabilities. Upon receipt of an appropriate stimulus, the sensor kinase is activated and autophosphorylates at the conserved histidine residue of the H box. The kinase then donates the high-energy phosphate group to an invariant aspartate residue within the receiver domain of the response regulator. This phosphorylation leads to structural changes in the regulator, enabling the modulation of gene expression or protein function.\n\nAnalyses of complete genomes have revealed 13 independent TCSS in GAS (161), S. pneumoniae (334, 605) and S. mutans (6), while 20 TCSS were found in GBS (194). TCSS are not, however, restricted to these species of streptococci and have been associated with the regulation of an array of cellular responses including pathogenesis, nutrient utilization, competence, and stress resistance (Table ). Nonetheless, it should be noted that for many TCSS, the precise regulatory networks and functional roles are still not understood.\n\nTABLE 3.\n\nTCSSSpeciesHomolog(s)Function(s) and/or substrate(s)bReference(s)CsrRS (CovRS)S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiaeGcrR/TarC (S. mutans); orphanVirulence, biofilm formation, negative global regulator330, 349, 575VicRKS. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutansVirulence, stress resistance; ↑ GtfBCD, GbpB, Ftf; biofilm formation, competence, nutrient uptake360, 543, 630CiaRHS. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. agalactiae, S. gordonii, S. sanguinisVirulence, competence, biofilm formation5, 186, 203, 495BfrABS. gordonii, S. sanguinisBiofilm formation668, 669ComEDS. mutans, S. pneumoniae, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. anginosus, S. cristatus, S. sanguinis, S. mitisCompetence (CSP), mutacin production, biofilm formation122, 225, 352, 453HdrRMS. mutansHigh cell density, bacteriocin production, biofilm formation, competence404HK11/RR11S. mutansAcid resistance, biofilm formation353TcbRKS. mutansSpiHR (S. pneumoniae)Biofilm formation50TcdRK (TCS3)S. mutansScnRK (S. pyogenes)Mutacin production50, 348SpiHRS. pneumoniaeTcbRK (S. mutans)Bacteriocin production491BlpRHS. pneumoniaeBacteriocin production130ScnRKS. pyogenesTcdRK (TCS3) (S. mutans)Lantibiotic production393SalKRS. salivariusLantibiotic (SalA) production617LytRSS. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniaeVirulence197, 280, 607Ihk-IrrS. pyogenesPolymorphonuclear neutrophil signal, virulence629FasBCAS. pyogenesFasCAX (S. dysgalactiae), RgfAC (S. agalactiae)Local tissue destruction309TrxSRS. pyogenesMga virulence regulon337SptRSS. pyogenesCarbohydrate uptake and utilization549SilABS. pyogenesVirulence151PnpRS (TCS04)S. pneumoniaePhosphate regulation; ↑ PsaA; oxidative stress334, 390, 429VncRSS. pneumoniaeVancomycin resistance429MicABS. pneumoniaeOxidative stress144CbpRSS. pneumoniae↓ pili508CpsXYS. pneumoniaeCapsule expression307HK/RR03S. pneumoniae↓ pili508HK06/RR06S. pneumoniaeVirulence (CbpA, PspA)573, 574TCS08S. pneumoniaeVirulence, cellobiose metabolism334, 392RelRSS. mutans(p)ppGpp production344LiaSRS. mutansVirulence; ↓ Gbp; mutacin production54, 101LevRSS. mutans↑ FruA663LytTSS. mutansAutolysin regulation, cell division91TCS9S. mutansCompetence348GcrR/TarCS. mutansCovR (S. pyogenes)Acid tolerance response; ↓ GtfS, GbpC141, 253RgfACS. agalactiaeFasBCA (S. pyogenes)Surface adhesins (↓ ScpB)566DltRSS. agalactiaeLTA biosynthesis464FasCAXS. dysgalactiaeFasBCA (S. pyogenes)Streptokinase and SLS production575StkP/PhpP/RitRaS. pneumoniaeGlobal; stress resistance, iron homeostasis142, 615, 616Stk1/Stp1/CovaS. agalactiaeBeta-hemolysin/cytolysin production, growth, virulence477, 478\n\nCsrRS.\n\nOne of the best-characterized TCSS is CsrRS (capsule synthesis regulator), otherwise known as CovRS (control of virulence genes). As its names suggest, CsrRS was first shown to repress the expression of the capsule synthesis has operon in GAS (349) but has since been found to affect the expression of a wide range of genes associated with GAS colonization and virulence (159, 197). These include genes encoding surface adhesins (e.g., lmb and scl2), extracellular enzymes (e.g., speB, ska, and sagA), and stress response proteins (e.g., dnaJK and grpE). Furthermore, CsrRS regulates other TCSS (e.g., ciaRH, ihk-irr, and trxSR) and global regulators (e.g., rgg and RofA-like protein [RALP] family genes), thereby mediating indirect effects on the expression of a secondary set o"
