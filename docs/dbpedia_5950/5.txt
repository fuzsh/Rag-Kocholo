Sinitta has fuelled the rumours that best pal Simon Cowell could be about to bring back his most famous TV show, The X Factor.

The former popstar, who often made appearances alongside friend Cowell during the judges' houses round of the ITV singing contest, was a guest on Good Morning Britain on Thursday where she admitted it was the music mogul's "heart's desire" to revive the show.

Recent rumours have suggested that The X Factor could reappear on Channel 5 and when Sinitta was asked if she knew anything, she gave hope to the show's fans.

The 58-year-old said: “I do know it is Simon’s heart’s desire to bring the show back.

“I have no idea what channel it will be on and who will be doing it with him.

“It would be fun. It is a great outlet for talent and I think people have missed it now.”

Pressed on what channel could end up airing the rebooted show, she told the ITV news programme's presenters Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins that "it would be good if we got it".

The X Factor began in 2004 and last aired in 2018, with Cowell making two spin-off series for ITV in 2019 – The X Factor: Celebrity and The X Factor: The Band.

It is rumoured to be making a return in 2023, although reports have not been confirmed.

Previous winners have included Leona Lewis, Alexandra Burke, Little Mix and James Arthur, but with Cowell recently having dramatically downscaled his Syco record label, it's unclear who would provide the record deal prize in a new series.

Sinitta also spoke about Cowell’s forthcoming wedding, saying: “I am ordained – I could officiate if Simon and Lauren (Silverman) would like me to.

“It is a legal situation so the offer is out there and it is up to them.”
