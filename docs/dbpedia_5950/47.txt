When it comes to the world of film, there are plenty of genres to consider. Some may love romantic comedies, while others might prefer classic horror films. But for certain movie buffs, the category that reigns supreme is musical movies. After all, ever since song and dance first hit the silver screen with the invention of sound technology in the early 20th century, musical movies have long been a part of cinematic history. And with the rise of music biopics, stage-to-screen adaptations and live-action films based on cartoons (hello, Disney!), you can’t go to the movie theater without some version of one being available to screen.

While all musical films tend to follow a similar formula (like catchy songs and impressive dance routines), the actual genre is actually quite diverse. This means there’s always an option for everyone, from a heartbreaking drama to ones that give a peek at important events in history. What’s more, some of the most popular Broadway shows have been adapted for the screen, bringing a touch of the Great White Way right to your couch.
