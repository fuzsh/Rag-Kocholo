        "text": "Buck wrestled with the front door, trying to open it with his knee without dropping the tupperware he was carefully cradling in the crook of his arms.\n\n“Hey babe!” he called towards the living room and the sound of the TV playing. At least the invalid had made it out of bed. “I have in my hand a bowl of Cap’s bonafide, certified, cold-busting chicken soup.”\n\nThere was a soft thud from the other room, followed by a crash. Buck sprinted towards the sound, his mind already racing through possible scenarios – had Tommy fallen? Had a cardiac arrest? Been attacked by ninjas?\n\nInstead, he found his boyfriend, red eyed and red nosed, sprawled on the ground from where he'd fallen off the couch, surrounded by a pile of coffee table books he’d knocked on the floor. Tommy frantically waved the remote at the TV which clicked off when Buck walked in.\n\n“Hey…” Buck said carefully. “Everything okay in here?”\n\n“Hi,” said Tommy. “I um… got my leg caught up in the blanket.” His bunged up nose smeared out the words, making Tommy sound utterly adorable. But Buck refused to be distracted.\n\n“Is that so,” said Buck, narrowing his eyes, as he set the soup down on the side and paced towards Tommy. “And that’s why you needed to turn the TV off so quickly?”\n\nTommy looked at the remote in his hand with surprise, feigning that he hadn't even noticed he'd picked it up. “Oh! Uhhhh…”\n\nThe cold really must have been clouding Tommy’s thoughts, as he struggled to think of any excuse. Buck decided to put him out of his misery. “You know, it's okay if you wanna watch porn when I'm not here, right?”\n\nTommy’s eyebrows shot up. “Huh?”\n\nWith a laugh, Buck set the soup down on the side before crossing the room to his boyfriend. “It makes you feel better when you have a cold. Sex. Or at least, orgasms anyway. Constricts the blood vessels in your nasal passages which makes it easier to breathe. And releases endorphins as a little pick-you up. You taking things into your own hands before I got here means you don’t risk passing your cold on to me, because I would feel honour bound to help you out. So, you knocking one out is actually a really thoughtful gesture.”\n\nTommy blinked at him, the words seeming to take longer than normal to seep in. The remote was still clutched to his chest. Buck stepped forward to take it from him, but Tommy just subtly turned away to evade his grasp.\n\n“Yes,” he said. “I was watching porn. To masturbate. That is what happened.”\n\nWell, that was about as believable as when Jee said she didn’t know what happened to the leftover birthday cake while frosting was clearly visible in her hair. “Tommy… What were you actually watching?”\n\n“Soup?” Tommy said, pointing at the container. He started to stride towards the counter, but his steps soon faltered, and he wavered on his feet as if about to fall again. Buck managed to wrap his arm around Tommy’s waist just in time, guiding him back down to the safety of the sofa.\n\n“You okay there?” he asked, pushing the hair from where it was plastered across Tommy’s forehead. His skin was hot and sweaty, but not worryingly so.\n\n“I’m fine,” said Tommy, blinking back his dizziness as he let Buck guide him back to the couch. “Really. This cold is just kicking my ass. Don't get too close, I don't want you to catch it.”\n\nBuck pressed a gentle kiss to Tommy’s forehead. “Aww. My big strong manly man is looking out for me.”\n\nAs he tried to relax into Tommy, he couldn’t help but notice how the other man remained oddly stiff. Was he trying to hold off the shivers? Pretending he wasn’t as sick as he was.\n\n“How did you get in?” Tommy asked quietly.\n\n“Spare key,” said Buck. “Behind the owl. You showed me like a month ago, remember?”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Right,” Tommy said. He took a deep breath as if to steady himself, but it must have caught something in his throat as a coughing fit racked through him. Buck was about to spring forward to get a glass of water, but when Tommy grabbed one already waiting on the side table. Instead, he just rubbed circles across Tommy’s broad back until the cough subsided.\n\n“I didn’t think you’d be over today, is all,” said Tommy.\n\n“Why not? Was I not supposed to be?” Buck asked, wracking his brain. They’d blocked this night in together a week ago, during their usual ritual of ‘comparing the schedules’, but it wouldn’t have been the first time he’d turned up on the wrong day or forgotten they’d rescheduled something. Same old Buck - overkeen and excitable when it came to the prospect of seeing his boyfriend.\n\n“I mean, I told you I was sick.”\n\n“Yes,” said Buck, still trying to work out where he’d gone wrong.\n\n“But I’m sick ,” Tommy said again. “Why would you still come over?”\n\n“To take care of you. Obviously.”\n\nTommy’s brow remained furrowed in confusion and Buck felt his skin prickle. Had he overstepped? He knew first hand that not everyone liked being fussed over when they were sick. Had Tommy been trying to tell him he’d rather spend the evening resting alone and Buck had totally missed the message?\n\n“Sorry,” said Buck, hating how he heard his insecurities in the tremble of his voice. “I can go. It’s fine.”\n\nTommy’s hand shot to Buck’s arm, gripping him tightly. “No. Stay.”\n\nBuck looked down into Tommy’s eyes - usually so steady and strong, now nervous and needy. “Please?”\n\nIt was then that Buck realised – Tommy had never had anyone to take care of him before.\n\nThey’d never gone into the details, but Buck knew the man’s previous partners hadn’t always been very nice to him. His parents were even worse. And while Tommy had loads of buddies for a trivia night or a work out session, none of them had the same deep caring connection that Buck had with his family at the 118. Tommy spent so much time supporting everyone around him that Buck had never noticed there was no one returning the favour. At least, not until now.\n\nBuck slotted himself in beside Tommy, letting his lips curl into the ghost of a smile. His fingers traced through the subtle curls of Tommy’s hair, mussed and crushed from where they’d been resting on a pillow.\n\n“Okay,” he whispered, running his hand down Tommy’s side. Buck’s fingers danced across the fabric of his shirt, lingering over the bare skin revealed where his shirt had ridden up. “I got nowhere else to be and nothing I’d rather do.”\n\nHis fingers brushed against the hard plastic of the remote. “Though I am going to need to see what you were watching?”\n\nBefore Tommy could react, Buck playfully plucked the remote away and clicked on the TV. He threw his arm away as Tommy lunged for the remote, but it was too late.\n\nWhatever Buck had been expecting to see, it wasn’t a familiar golden ‘H’ materialising in the centre of the screen.\n\n“Stay tuned for even more festive romance, only on Hallmark.”\n\nAt first Buck thought he must have accidentally changed channel, but the guilty look on Tommy’s face betrayed him.\n\n“You were watching Hallmark movies?”\n\nTommy avoided his eyes, leaning back into the opposite corner of the couch. “Yeah.”\n\n“And you felt the need to hide that from me?” Buck didn’t mean it to come out as an accusation – he was just thoroughly non-plussed.\n\n“I wasn’t hiding it from you,” said Tommy emphatically. “I mean… yes, I did. But… I’m supposed to be your ‘big strong manly man’.” He deepened his voice, speaking as low and gruffly as his stuffed nose allowed. “The man who likes beer and monster trucks. Not cheesy romance movies about a big city lawyer who goes back to the small town they grew up in to help save the family farm, before ending up falling in love with a prince who has a British accent despite coming from some random European country you've never heard of.”\n\nBuck could tell that Tommy was embarrassed, but he couldn’t keep the fond smile from his face. “That is… extremely specific.”\n\n“You’d think so,” said Tommy defeatedly. “But there are at least six movies with that plot. They’re my favourite ones.”\n\nBuck had to stifle his chuckles. When they’d first started dating, Chim had insisted on telling Buck everything he knew about Tommy, including that his favourite movie was one of those British rom-coms from 20 years ago – Four Notting Hills and a Bridget Jones’ funeral , or whatever it was called. At the time, Buck had ignored him, wanting to learn about Tommy from the man himself, but it made sense now.\n\n“I guess I should have pegged you as a romantic when you turned up at my sister’s wedding still in your turnouts after a 24 hour shift fighting a forest fire so you didn’t miss our date,” said Buck. “That move is straight out of a Hallmark movie.”\n\n“I might have been taking a few pointers along the way,” Tommy laughed, self consciously running his fingers through his hair. “But mostly I just think they’re really comforting. You always know how it’s going to go. Sometimes you can predict the whole movie just from the title. Even though things always seem bad around the 1 hour 20 minute mark, by the end of the movie the bad guys will have got their due and everyone else will get their happy ever after.” Tommy brought his legs up, wrapping himself in a ball. It made him look oddly small, as if he was trying to take up as little space in the world as he could. “I just like to spend a few hours believing in a world where that’s possible.”\n\nThere was an ocean of hurt in those words. Buck had glimpsed those waters before, and knew they ran far and deep, but now wasn’t the time to explore the depths. Right now, what Tommy needed was to be guided back to shore.\n\n“I’m not with you because you’re a big strong manly man,” soothed Buck, scooching closer and curling himself around Tommy. “Obviously, that doesn’t hurt. But I like you because you’re you . You’re the guy who picks up the phone when a friend he hasn’t heard from in years calls and then flies into a hurricane. But you’re also the guy that watches sappy romance movies when he’s feeling sick. And I like both of those guys. And every other guy that you are, because all those guys are you.”\n\nTommy finally met his eye, and Buck could see his own affection reflected back at him. “Maybe you should be the one writing the movie, if you’re going to spin cliched lines like that at me.”\n\nBuck’s face split in a grin before he leant forward, capturing Tommy’s lips with his own before the other man could push him away.\n\n“No! Don’t. I’ll make you sick,” said Tommy, making no effort to actually escape from Buck’s attentions.\n\n“Then you’ll just have to come and take care of me,” said Buck. He gave Tommy one more quick peck before standing up and heading towards the kitchen. He was just stopping to pick up the soup container when he registered the sound of sleigh bells coming from the ads playing on the TV.\n\n“Wait. Didn’t it say festive movies?”\n\n“Yeah,” said Tommy, distractedly arranging the cushions.\n\n“It’s July.”\n\nTommy paused, twisting a cushion in his hands. “Oh. I, uh, record the entire Christmas season every year. They’re always the best ones.”\n\n“I will have to take your word on that,” said Buck, grabbing the container and disappearing into the kitchen. He returned a few minutes later, with a tray carrying two steaming bowls of soup and a couple of equally steaming mugs.\n\n“Hot chocolate?” Tommy asked, as Buck set the tray down on the coffee table.\n\n“You can’t watch Christmas movies without hot chocolate,” Buck explained, settling himself back in. “Not sure how well it will pair with chicken and lemon soup, or an LA summer for that matter, but rules are rules. I even found some marshmallows in the back of one of your cupboards that were only slightly out of date, and I added a dash of cinnamon to make it really taste like Christmas.”\n\nTommy lifted the mug to sniff it, but his nose was still so bunged up he just made a god-awful gurgling sound. “I will have to take your word on that.”\n\nBuck wrapped his arm around Tommy’s shoulders just as the sprightly jingle bells of the movie’s theme song began to play. The screen transformed into a sea of red and gold, the words ‘A Very Merry Mistletoe Inn’ looping their way across the foreground. It might have had something to do with the man plastered against his side, but Buck couldn’t help but be buoyed by the snowy scenes on the screen in front of them. A generically beautiful woman emerged on the screen, skidding down the street where she collided with a generically handsome man. They both blathered for a moment, before their eyes meet in one single, electric moment – one they both feel, but neither recognise. Not yet.\n\nIn his mind, Buck is transported back to the hangar at Harbour, walking across the floor towards a figure in a blue jumpsuit. The man turns, their eyes meet and there it is – that spark, jumping between them and catching alight. He hadn’t recognised it at the time either, but it was the start of everything. The meet cute beginning his own real life love story. And though it was still early in their tale, when Buck looked at the way Tommy’s face crinkled with joy as he watched the movie pressed up against him, he felt a warm certainty that this, right here, was his happily ever after."
