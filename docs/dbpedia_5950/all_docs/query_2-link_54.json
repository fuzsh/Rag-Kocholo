        "text": "27.3K\n\nJohn Lennon wrote the Beatles song “In My Life,” with some help from Paul McCartney and Beatles producer George Martin (who should have received a co-writing credit) in 1965. Fifteen years later, in his last major interview, Lennon described it as “a remembrance of friends and lovers of the past.”\n\nThat is, I think, how most people see it: A sweet song about looking back on the past.\n\nBut that’s not what it’s about. It’s really the least nostalgic song you could imagine.\n\nI’ve thought this about “In My Life” for a long time, but was inspired to write this post after seeing the new jukebox musical, “My Very Own British Invasion,” at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn. (Here’s my review). The song is used at the end of the evening, to put a sentimental spin on a story of love won and lost in the heady days of the 1960s British Invasion.\n\n“In My Life” ends with the line “I love you more,” but in “My Very Own British Invasion,” it is changed to “I loved you more.” And it wasn’t just sung incorrectly on the night I happened to be there, or heard wrong by me: The change is spelled out in a projection above the actors. (See photo)\n\nI believe the change (“love” to “loved”) makes the song into what most people think it is — that whole “a remembrance of friends and lovers of the past” thing — but this represents a huge change in the intention of the song, as it was originally recorded.\n\nLet’s take a close look at the song’s lyrics, starting with the first verse:\n\nThere are places I’ll remember\n\nAll my life, though some have changed\n\nSome forever, not for better\n\nSome have gone and some remain\n\nAll these places have their moments\n\nWith lovers and friends I still can recall\n\nSome are dead and some are living\n\nIn my life, I’ve loved them all\n\nOkay, that fits the conventional thinking about the song: Nice, sweet nostalgia. Fine. But then we get to the second verse:\n\nBut of all these friends and lovers\n\nThere is no one compares with you\n\nAnd these memories lose their meaning\n\nWhen I think of love as something new\n\nThough I know I’ll never lose affection\n\nFor people and things that went before\n\nI know I’ll often stop and think about them\n\nIn my life, I love you more\n\nThis upends the first verse, where Lennon sang about the past. Now he is singing about the present. His meaning couldn’t be clearer. Those old friends and lovers can’t compare with the person who is standing before him, now. Not only that, those memories “lose their meaning” (!) in the presence of new love.\n\nHe reiterates his “affection” (a carefully chosen word; “affection” is not as powerful as love) for the past and says he’ll still think about it. But “I love you more.” In other words, the past just can’t compare. (Now that I think about it, “I Love You More” really would have been a better title for this song.)\n\nThe song ends by repeating the second half of the second verse. This emphasizes the point: This is a song about the present, and rebirth.\n\nThat’s not how the song is used in “My Very Own British Invasion.” The singer there hasn’t found anyone new, but is just revisiting the past. That’s why “love” had to be turned into “loved.” But this turns the song on its head.\n\nI’m sure most of the musical’s attendees don’t mind. That’s what they think “In My Life” is about, anyway. Even Lennon himself, apparently, thought about the song that way, years after he recorded it.\n\nBut I just wanted to set the record straight."
