        "text": "Sample interview questions\n\nThese sample interview questions come direct from the tutors who conduct the interviews. We hope they'll make you think, and help you understand why we ask the questions that we do.\n\nAsian and Middle Eastern Studies\n\nInterviewer: Alison Salvesen, Mansfield College.\n\nCan archaeology ‘prove’ or ‘disprove’ the Bible?\n\nCandidates in my subject come from a wide variety of backgrounds and qualifications, so we generally try to tailor the interview questions to the individual according to what they have on the UCAS form or wrote about in their submitted work, in order to find out whether they have a genuine interest in the subject area and an aptitude for the course.\n\nFor this particular question I would be looking for an answer that showed the candidate could appreciate that the Bible was a collection of documents written and transmitted over several centuries, and containing important traditions that have a bearing on history, but that academic study of the Bible means that it has to be examined carefully to see when and where these traditions had come from and for what purpose they had been written.\n\nWhereas they should recognise that archaeology relies on non-literary sources preserved from ancient periods such as the remains of buildings and tools. These can often be dated by scientific means (and so appear more objective than literature), but we still frequently need additional information such as inscriptions or evidence from other similar sites in order to make sense of the ancient remains.\n\nIn the end I would hope the candidate would work towards a realisation of the very different nature of these types of evidence, which sometimes gives a complementary picture, while in others it may be contradictory. Both require very careful interpretation, and just arguing that ‘The Bible says’ or that ‘Archaeology proves’ is much too simplistic. (The same kind of thing applies to archaeology, the Quran, and non-Islamic historical sources for a study of the early Arab conquests.)\n\nBiochemistry\n\nBiology\n\nBiomedical Sciences\n\nChemistry\n\nClassics\n\nComputer Science\n\nEarth Sciences\n\nEconomics\n\nEconomics and Management\n\nEngineering\n\nEnglish Literature\n\nGeography\n\nHistory\n\nLaw\n\nMaterials Science\n\nMathematics\n\nMedicine\n\nModern Languages\n\nMusic\n\nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPhysics\n\nPsychology\n\nTheology and Religion"
