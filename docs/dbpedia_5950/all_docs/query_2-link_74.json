        "text": "This list of the 30 best selling singles in the world reveals three Christmas hits, three charity singles, four film theme songs, novelty records and artists from Japan, Germany, Africa, Italy, Sweden, the UK and US.\n\nABBA ‘Fernando’\n\nEstimated sales 10m. Released 1975\n\nComposed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus the song carried the working title of ‘Tango’. ‘Fernando’ was not originally released as an ABBA song but as a solo single by band member Anni-Frid Lyngstad – featured on her 1975 solo album Frida ensam. The English version, with completely different lyrics presents a vision of nostalgia for two veterans reminiscing in old age about a lost battle in which they participated.\n\nRoger Whittaker ‘The Last Farewell’\n\nEstimated sales 11m. Released 1975\n\nBritish folk singer Roger Whittaker hosted a radio programme in the UK in 1971, and would invite listeners to send their poems or lyrics in and he would attempt to make songs out of them. Ron A. Webster, a silversmith from Birmingham sent Whittaker his poem entitled ‘The Last Farewell’, and this became one of the selections to appear on the radio programme. It was subsequently recorded and featured on Whittaker’s 1971 album New World in the Morning. Released as a single ‘The Last Farewell’ went to number one in 11 countries including the US.\n\nMills Brothers ‘Paper Doll’\n\nEstimated sales 11m. Released 1943\n\nThe Mills Brothers (originally known as Four Boys and a Guitar) were an African-American jazz and pop vocal quartet who made more than 2,000 recordings that sold more than 50 million copies. They were the first African-American artists to have their own show on national network radio (on CBS in 1930), and were the first to have a No. 1 hit on the Billboard singles chart.‘Paper Doll’ has been named one of the Songs of the Century and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nGeorge McCrae ‘Rock Your Baby’\n\nEstimated sales 11m. Released 1974\n\nWritten and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC and the Sunshine Band, ‘Rock Your Baby’ was one of the landmark recordings of early disco music and was also one of the first records to use a drum machine – an early Roland rhythm machine. The backing track for the record was recorded in 45 minutes as a demo. The chord progression of John Lennon’s ‘Whatever Gets You thru the Night’, released a few months later, bears a great resemblance to the one found in ‘Rock Your Baby’ and Lennon later admitted to using the song as an inspiration.\n\nCarl Douglas ‘Kung Fu Fighting’\n\nEstimated sales 11m. Released 1974\n\n‘Kung Fu Fighting’ was originally meant to be a B-side recorded quickly in the last ten minutes of studio time in only two takes. The song, which uses the quintessential Oriental riff, a short musical phrase that is used to signify Chinese culture was released as a single in 1974 on the cusp of a chopsocky film craze. The follow-up ‘Dance the Kung Fu’ did not crack the Top 40.\n\nCher ‘Believe’\n\nEstimated sales 11m. Released 1998\n\nLifted from her twenty-second album of the same name, it became her fourth number-one single and made Cher the oldest female artist (at the age of 52) to perform this feat.
