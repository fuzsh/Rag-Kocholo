ourselves independently salvageable.\n\nWe became friends in the late '50s, just as the United States was poised to make its quantum leap into the future; just as Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and other Southerners were girding themselves for the second civil war in one hundred years; and just when Malcolm X was giving voice to the anger in the streets and in the minds of Northern Black city folks.\n\nIn that riotous pulse of political fervor, James Baldwin and I met again and liked each other.\n\nIn this particular society... ...we are supposed to be so contained.\n\nMen are supposed to be men, women are supposed to be women, and not need, really need, anybody else.\n\nThe ability to ask, \"Will you be my brother?\n\n\", the courage to ask, is often missing.\n\nJames Baldwin was a brother.\n\nIncredible!\n\n-He lived his life as witness.\n\nHe wrote until the end.\n\nWe hear of the writer's blocks of celebrated Americans, how great they are, so great, indeed, that their writing fingers have been turned to checks.\n\nBut Jimmy wrote.\n\nHe produced, he spoke, he sang, no matter the odds.\n\nHe remained man and spirit and voice ever-expanding and ever more conscious.\n\n[

father came from New Orleans, my mother came from Maryland, and if they had waited, you know, two more seconds, I might have been born in the South.\n\nThe first house I remember was on Park Avenue, which is not the American Park Avenue.\n\nOr maybe it is the American Park Avenue.\n\n-Uptown Park Avenue.\n\n-Uptown Park Avenue, where the railroad tracks are.\n\nWe used to play on the roof, and I can't call it an alley, but near the river, there was a kind of dump -- garbage dump.\n\nThat was the first -- Those were the first scenes I remember.\n\nI remember my father had trouble keeping us alive.\n\nThere were nine of us, and I was the oldest.\n\nSo I took care of the kids and dealt with Daddy, whom I understand much better now.\n\nPart of his problem was, he couldn't feed his kids.\n\nBut I was a kid, and I didn't know that.\n\nAnd he was very religious, very rigid.\n\nIn fact, in a word, he wanted power.\n\nHe wanted Negroes to do, in effect, what he imagined White people did -- that is to have -- to own the houses, to own U.S. Steel.\n\nAnd this is what, in effect, killed him.\n\nBecause there was something in him which could not bend.\n\nHe could only be broken.\n\n[

and I read everything there.\n\nI mean, every single book in that library.\n\n♪♪ In some blind and instinctive way, I knew that what was happening in those books was also happening all around me.\n\nAnd I was trying to make a connection between the books and the life I saw and the life I lived.\n\n[ Children playing ] I knew I was Black, of course, but I also knew I was smart.\n\nI didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if I could, but that was the only thing I had to use, and I was going to get whatever I wanted that way, and I was going to get my revenge that way.\n\nSo I watched school the way I watched the streets, because part of the answer was there.\n\n-He did a play, when I was very, very small.\n\nHe had to be very small himself.\n\nHe must have been about 8 or 9 years old when he wrote his first play.\n\nAnd he also wrote the school song, which they used until the school closed down.\n\nThe whole family went to this school, P.S.\n\n24, 128th St. between Fifth and Madison, and everyone had to sing this same song.\n\nIf I can remember, let's see.\n\n♪ Farewell, farewell to 24 ♪ ♪ We shall miss you evermore ♪ ♪ We hate to say goodbye to you ♪ ♪ That's

be a writer.\n\nAnd I wrote all the time.\n\nI wrote at first on paper bags.\n\nI wrote plays and poetry and stories, and writing was my great consolation.\n\nMy father was very opposed to it, very frightened by it, and that frightened me.\n\nMy mother was frightened -- was frightened, too, but my mother was another kind of person.\n\nShe didn't try to stop me.\n\n-Did you think he was going to be as big a success and as important?\n\n-No, no, I didn't think that.\n\nBut I knew that he had to write.\n\n-I-I got something from school today, and Mom said I should show you.\n\n-Hmm.\n\nHistory of New York, huh?\n\n-I-I wrote it over and over again, and I had to read a lot of books about it.\n\n-It might have been nice if you had written something about the Bible.\n\nSomething about your own people and God.\n\n-I will, next time, sir.\n\nI'll tell you this: My father frightened me so badly, I had to fight him so hard, that nobody has ever frightened me since.\n\nAnd I went into the church, partly because I had been driven there all my life, and my father had always determined that I would be a preacher, I'd always said I wouldn't be, but life outwitted me, you know, and corroborated him, because at that point in my life, there was no place for me to go.\n\nI had no intention, ever, of becoming a preacher or of entering that terrifying church that I'd spent nearly 14 years, by that time, trying to get out of.\n\nBut I was so afraid of everything else, that in a way, I ended up with the devil I knew, though I couldn't have said it then.\n\n[ Gospel music plays ] -♪

take that and put it to good use, it's worthless.\n\n-Amen.\n\n-The whole question of Jimmy and religion is a knotty question, it's a difficult question.\n\nIt's one that as a biographer, obviously, I have to deal with, and I haven't really finished dealing with it.\n\nI think it's important to realize that, rhetorically, the church is extremely important to Jimmy, the language of the church, the language of the Bible primarily, the patterns of the Bible, even the struggles of the Bible.\n\n-I had been a boy preacher for three years.\n\nAnd those three years, really, in a sense, you know -- those three years in the pulpit, I didn't realize it then, that is what turned me into a writer, really.\n\nDealing with all that anguish and that despair and that beauty for those three years.\n\nAnd I left because I didn't want to cheat my congregation.\n\nI knew I didn't know anything at all.\n\nAnd I couldn't leave -- If I'd left the pulpit, I had to leave home.\n\nSo I left the pulpit and I left home in the same day.\n\nThat was quite a day.\n\n[ Chuckles ] And, uh, well, in a sense, I became a writer because I thought if I got through, my old man would be proud of me.\n\nYou know?\n\nI started writing when I was very, very, very young.\n\nI started being published when I was 22.\n\nAnd once I was out of Harlem, I began to see -- Well, I was a book reviewer, you know?\n\nI wrote some of the early, early essays in that time.\n\nBut I had written myself into a wall.\n\nI was -- You know, I was -- I was expected to write about one subject only.\n\nSo, for two years, I reviewed all those post-war \"Be kind to colored people,\" \"Be kind to Jews\" books.\n\nAll 47,000 of them came across my desk.\n\nAnd [Chuckles] I simply had to go, you know, and try to figure what in the world was happening to me.\n\nNegroes were not served here, Negroes cannot eat there.\n\nIf you were a Negro, there was nothing you could do at all.\n\nAnd one evening, something happened to me which was -- which has frightened me ever since.\n\nAnd it was simply that I walked into a restaurant where I knew I would not be served.\n\nBut I walked in with the determination to be served or to die.\n\nAnd I waited, I wasn't served, of course.\n\nThe woman said -- poor little girl -- said that Negroes were not served here, and I wanted to kill her, but I couldn't get close enough to her, so I threw a glass a water at her.\n\nAnd when the glass of water hit the mirror behind the bar, I woke up.\n\nIt was a terrible turning point in my life.\n\n[ Whoosh ] [ Glass shatters ] I never forgot it, because it was the first time in my life that I ever wanted, really, to hurt anybody.\n\nAnd that drove me, finally, out of the country.\n\n[ Soft music plays ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ The best thing I ever did with my life, I think, was, in effect, flee America and go to Paris in 1948.\n\nAnd it gave me time to vomit up a great deal, a great deal of bitterness.\n\n♪♪ At least, I could operate in Paris without being menaced socially.\n\nNo one cared what I did.\n\n-I met Jimmy in '49, in Paris.\n\nUh...\n\nI was 17, he was 24.\n\nWe were both kids in the streets.\n\nNo money.\n\nAnd we became friends.\n\n-Everybody was poor in Paris.\n\nThose who worked were poor.\n\nJimmy was very poor, and he was living in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank.\n\nHe'd move around.\n\nHe loved to give parties.\n\nLoved to invite people in, and he didn't spend a lot of money on them.\n\nPeople would just -- just come just to be -- just to be there.\n\n[ Mid-tempo music plays ] And even then, when we were young, we use to break up bars and drink all night long.\n\n♪♪ We would sit up at night, dance and sing and laugh until 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning, and the neighbors would say \"We heard you, but you didn't bother us.\"\n\n-All our time, all our life was ours.\n\nI mean, we had no job, nothing else to do than live.\n\nAnd he lived.\n\nMy God, he lived.\n\nMe too, I lived.\n\nWe went around the streets, drinking, a lot already.\n\nI heard also about the complaints about that, but, you know, we could drink.\n\nWe both could drink very well.\n\n[ Chuckles ] Very well.\n\nI used to see him every day, we would talk, usually all night, and, uh, we were in love with each other, you know, Being two young kids, both in different ways lost.\n\nI was a very lost kid, and he was certainly, but another way -- a completely different way.\n\n-He said that he came because he wanted to be a writer, and he couldn't be a writer in America.\n\nIt was that simple.\n\n-It was very significant.\n\nThe first thing I wrote in Paris, once I caught my breath, was \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" you know, to get that behind me and to find out what I could really do, you know, if I really was a writer instead of a pamphleteer.\n\n-I think the next thing that really was impressed on me, because I had been reading some things, was \"Notes of a Native Son.\"\n\nWhen that book came out, it impressed me because a young Black man, you know, whose picture looked like he was earnest and serious about what he was saying, and I think he was impressive on a whole generation of Black people, not just writers.\n\n-I mean, he never lost sight of the fact that he was an American.\n\nHe always considered himself very much an American, even in -- you can see that in his early essays, the \"Notes of a Native Son\" essays, in which really he is using Paris, using France, as a means of discovering his own identity.\n\n-I was very lucky.\n\nThe first thing I realized in Paris was that you don't ever leave home.\n\nYou take your home with you.\n\nYou better.\n\nYou know?\n\nOtherwise, you're homeless.\n\n-France was not without its race prejudices.\n\nIt simply didn't have any guilt vis-à-vis Black Americans.\n\nAnd Black Americans who went there, from Richard Wright to Sidney Bechet, were so colorful and so talented and so marvelous and so exotic, who wouldn't want them?\n\nOf course.\n\nBut among the people they did not want in France were the Algerians.\n\nAs Jimmy said, they were the niggers of France.\n\nTo him, they were his brothers.\n\nHe was very outspoken during the Algerian War, when they were trying to win their freedom from France in the '50s.\n\nHe wrote about the Algerians in this excerpt from \"No Name in the Street.\"\n\n\"I had come to Paris with no money, and this meant that in those early years, I lived mainly among les misérables.\n\nAnd in Paris, les misérables are Algerian.\n\nThey scraped such sustenance as they could off the filthy, unyielding stones of Paris.\n\nThe French called them lazy, but they were not lazy.\n\nThey were mostly unable to find work.\n\nAnd their rooms were freezing.\n\nAnd although they spoke French, and had been, in a sense, produced by France, they were no more at home in Paris than I.\"\n\n[ Indistinct shouting ] James Baldwin was relentless in his insight.\n\nHe knew where he was.\n\n[ Indistinct conversations ] -The problem with him was that he needed quiet.\n\nHe loved the streets.\n\nBut he had to get out of the streets once in a while and get off someplace where he could work.\n\nHe was -- He was -- He was moving all the time, to find places where he could work.\n\n-So we went to Switzerland.\n\nI had that idea to go to Switzerland, where he would have a house of his own and nothing else to do in that village.\n\nThat I knew.\n\nThere was nothing else.\n\nThere was all snow, all mountains, so there was nothing else but just work.\n\nI mean, it's life like 10 centuries ago.\n\nNow it has changed a lot, but at that time, it was a lost village, really -- nothing else but snow, mountains, a few cows, and people.\n\nIt's true that, uh, we must have been a very strange couple, that's true.\n\nA very strange couple in that village.\n\n[ Chuckles ] Well, what can you do?\n\nC'est la vie.\n\nHe'd be writing.\n\nI would go do the shopping.\n\nI would take him out again, after the work, have drinks, and have fun.\n\nIt was a very strange experience, but mostly for the people of the village.\n\nBut then that's how we learned about the first reaction of people towards a Black man, and these reactions come from a whole culture.\n\nAnd that's in his essay, \"Stranger in the Village.\"\n\nThere, he lived all that winter, and it was a fabulous experience for him, you know, in a whole, I mean, white village, all white.\n\nThe snow, mountains, everything was white.\n\nA lot of children.\n\nThat, he loved.\n\nThe children adored him, and they loved him, and he loved the children, and we went along very well.\n\nI mean, Jimmy -- I guess he charmed them, really.\n\n[ Chuckles ] We had a marvelous winter.\n\nHe did his work, and how well.\n\nAnd that's where he finished his first novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" okay?\n\n-It's true, in that chalet, in the snow, I listened to Bessie Smith and to Fats Waller, and they carried me back to what I myself had been like when I was a little boy and gave me the key to the language which gave me \"Go Tell It on the Mountain.\"\n\n[ Child giggles ] -Because of the sound of the typewriter, I remember when he finished the novel, because he typed, you know, \"The End.\"\n\nYou know, bing, bing, very slowly, with hitting, you know, very strongly.\n\nThen, I think I came out of the kitchen, I said \"Eh, bien, mon vieux, je crois que c'est fini.\"\n\nAnd he said \"Yes, it's the end!\"\n\nSo we got out, we had a lotta, lotta drinks.\n\nOkay?\n\nWe got drunk, and that was it.\n\nBut then we came down to the valley, put that novel on the mail, and it was published, obviously.\n\n[ Chuckles ] -Well, in 1948, I was the publicity director of Knopf, Alfred Knopf, the publisher.\n\nAnd sounds grand, but it was $75 a week then, however.\n\nAnd I read a lot of magazines in the course of doing publicity.\n\nAnd I read these marvelous pieces by a James Baldwin.\n\nFirst, in \"Commentary\" magazine, a piece about Harlem.\n\nAnd then a few pieces in \"The New Leader,\" which is sort of a Trotskyite I guess, magazine of the times.\n\nStill going.\n\nAnd they were so wonderful, these pieces, that I went to the editor-in-chief, named Harold Strauss, and I said, \"Harold, look at this.\n\nThis is a wonderful writer.\n\nHe's concise, he's powerful, he's witty, and he's saying something, and you should get after him.\"\n\nI wasn't doing any editing then.\n\nAnd Harold said, \"Oh, thank you,\" and he read the pieces.\n\nHe said they were very nice.\n\nHe liked them very much, and he knew the woman who was Jimmy's agent then, who's also named Strauss -- Helen Strauss, no relation whatsoever.\n\nAnd Helen said, \"Yes, Jimmy's working on a novel, and I'll send it over to you.\"\n\nAnd eventually, Harold got this bale of a manuscript in all different size pages and different typewriters obviously used on it over the course of the years.\n\nAnd he looked -- he read some of it, and he called me in and he said, \"I don't like this kind of book, Bill.\n\nIt's not a real straightforward narrative novel, you know.\n\nWould you look at it?\"\n\nAnd so I took it home in here, this very apartment.\n\nAnd I read it, and I thought, \"My God, this is a big book.\n\nThis is important.\"\n\nAnd I took it in, back to the office.\n\nAnd two other editors read it and agreed with me, said it was a wonderful book.\n\nAnd we did it.\n\n-And I think this is an autobiographical novel.\n\nYou know, he wrote these confessionals, he wrote a lot of autobiographical work, explaining what it is to grow up in Harlem.\n\nI'm gonna give an example of this excellent scene here with -- and notice the detail, and the economy of this passage.\n\nOkay?\n\nAnd this is Sunday morning in church.\n\nOkay, now get this: \"The sisters in white, heads raised.\n\nThe brothers in blue, heads back.\n\nThe white caps of the women seeming to glow in the charged air, like crowns.\n\nThe kinky gleaming heads of men seeming to be lifted up.\n\nAnd the rustling and the whispering ceased.\n\nAnd the children were quiet.\n\nPerhaps someone coughed, or the sound of a car horn or a curse from the streets came in.\n\nThen, Elijah hit the keys, beginning at once to sing, and everybody joined him.\"\n\n[ Piano plays softly ] -♪ Precious Lord ♪ ♪ Take my hand ♪ ♪ And lead me on ♪ ♪♪ -Baldwin's idea was that

Horton, a Black slave writing about 1840, '50.\n\nHe wrote, \"Alas, and was I born for this, to wear this slavish chain.\"\n\nI hear Baldwin.\n\n-After \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" was published, he

to find -- and I'm not the only case, or even the most spectacular -- you have to find a way to do your work, because if you don't do your work, then you really are useless.\n\n-You do spend a long

working the last few years, between assassinations.\n\nAnd that doesn't make it any easier either.\n\n-He was working on \"If Beale Street Could Talk,\" and he was -- It was the first novel he had written since America.\n\nAnd that bothers him very much.\n\n-It's a book that stands out from the other books.\n\nIt's a very bitter book.\n\nAnd I think that's because he'd been disillusioned by what happened in the '60s, by the assassination of Malcolm X, the assassination of Martin Luther King.\n\nYou know, it's a very desperate period, and sort of like a post rev-- I would call it a

the hook, and some people are bothered by that.\n\nAnd one way of handling the problem is to say, \"Oh, his powers have slipped,\" you know.\n\n[ Teletypewriter clacking ] [ Soft jazz plays ] ♪♪ -It's too bad that the public has to regard a writer of Jimmy's value and worth and contributions as somebody who was \"in and out of vogue.\"\n\nI don't think somebody who fought for human rights and dignity, the way Jimmy did, should be like last year's bow tie or this year's straw hat.\n\n-What people tend to forget is that Jimmy spent a large part of his later years teaching, as well as writing.\n\nHe lectured all over the country.\n\nHe taught for several years in Amherst.\n\nAnd this was very important to him.\n\n-I thought he was a marvelous teacher and very invested and really cared that he was getting through to the students and that -- that there was that connection, that there was a dialogue going on.\n\nOne of the reasons that I think he decided to teach is that he wanted to be around young people who are getting the basis for their ideas.\n\nAnd he was interested in what they were thinking.\n\n-Well, I was fortunate.\n\nMy whole senior year I got to spend basically on James Baldwin's knee.\n\nHe would give us assignments, we would do writing, and then we would come in and read to each other.\n\nBecause Jimmy was so busy, because he was on the road while he was teaching the course, he would always take the class out for drinks afterwards because this is how he could get to know his students.\n\nWe hung out, and, you know, we laughed, and that's how our friendship started.\n\n-He liked reading the students' work.\n\nHe liked -- He liked budding creativity.\n\nReally liked being around it.\n\nAnd he liked the fact that the students looked up to him for guidance and that they asked real intelligent, well-informed questions about, \"How did you do that?\n\nHow do I do it?\"\n\n-One of my problems going to Mount Holyoke and going to such a staid college was that they always complained that I wrote in Black English, and -- First they would complain that you're writing in Black English, and then I'd say, \"Well, I speak Black English, and I speak, you know.\"\n\nAnd they'd say, \"Well, okay, if you're going to write in Black English, you gotta just write in Black English.\n\nYou can't mix it with regular old American language.\"\n\nAnd, you know, so, those were the kind of battles I was fighting until Jimmy came along.\n\nAnd Jimmy said, \"Write whatever you want to write.\"\n\nAnd, you know, not only, \"Write what you want to write,\" but, \"This is my experience, too.\n\nYou know?\n\nThis is real.\n\nI can relate to this.\"\n\n-Black people need witnesses in this hostile world which thinks, um, everything

despair.\n\nI can't afford despair.\n\nI can't tell my nephew, my niece... You can't tell the -- You can't tell the children there's no hope.\n\n-Most people would agree that Jimmy was a hero, in a sense, that Jimmy was an adventurer.\n\nJimmy didn't take the easy way.\n\nThere are people who have liked him to go on writing \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" over and over again.\n\nBut Jimmy didn't like going back to what he had already done.\n\nNow, it may be that in any given novel he wasn't as successful as he was in some other given novel, but that's the game.\n\nThat's the game of writing novels.\n\nIt's not an easy game.\n\nAnd, uh, the things he attempted in the later works were much more difficult, I think.\n\n-You know, James Baldwin gave Black people an example.\n\nI know he inspired me to write.\n\nWhen you see another Black person out there writing, when all you've been fed is Milton and Shelley and all these people who were dead 200 years ago, that gets your attention.\n\n-God knows the handicaps and the hazards are very, very, very real and, you know, tremendous.\n\nBut if we can get beyond the place where we are now, something very important may happen in the world.\n\nI believe that.\n\n-He brought that cry into the cocktail parties, as well as the universities, as well as the streets.\n\nAnd I think that all of us, you know, owe James Baldwin -- those of us who are interested in Black liberation, those of us who are interested in human progress, and those of us that are interested in writing -- owe him a great -- a great debt.\n\n-On the 1st of April, Jimmy had an appointment at the Institut Cinc, which is a private hospital.\n\nAnd they gave him an examination and found that it was cancer.\n\nHe said the doctors had told him it was very, very serious and he knew it was very, very serious.\n\nBut he had things to do.\n\nHe would say, \"I'm skating on my reputation now.\n\nI've got to do something else.\"\n\nHe wanted to finish a play.\n\nHe was rewriting a play, \"The Welcome Table.\"\n\nAnd he wanted to get that done.\n\nHe knew, himself, that it wasn't going to be as long as I thought it would be, because he gave up his novel.\n\nHe read the first six pages of his new novel to me, then he gave that up.\n\n-The last letter I got from him, he wrote on July 4th.\n\nAnd he said to me... \"July 4th!\n\n'87.\n\nMy Dear Cindy, a note.\n\nForcing myself to attempt to write by hand in an

morning -- He said, um... \"I see Simone's face on the wall.\"\n\n\"Do you ever see people's faces on the wall?\"\n\nHe said, \"I see her face on the wall.\"\n\nAnd I called the doctor, and the doctor said, \"I think he's going to go tonight.\"\n\nAnd -- He couldn't swallow anymore.\n\nSo I was trying to find a bent straw, so he could pull it in.\n\nHe didn't have the strength to pull it in a straw.\n\n-And that -- In the evening, I went out of his room, told David to come help me bring -- take Jimmy.\n\nAnd we stayed there.\n\nDavid felt it was the last hour.\n\nYes, it was amazing.\n\nWe were the three of us, sitting.\n\nDavid was holding his hand, and I was sitting on a chair, in the beginning, and Bernard was putting water on his lips.\n\nDavid talked to him.\n\nWe felt -- We felt -- He looked at us.\n\nHe looked at us.\n\nHe didn't talk.\n\nHe looked at us.\n\nAnd it -- I have the feeling we accompanied him, you know, a part of his trip.\n\nAnd Jimmy looked, little by little, looked elsewhere, and as I told you, we accompanied him.\n\nThen, personally, I had the feeling, at one point, I came back, came back to life.\n\nHe was gone.\n\nThat was it.\n\nJimmy had gone.\n\n♪♪
