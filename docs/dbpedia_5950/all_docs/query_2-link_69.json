        "text": "Ethos, Pathos, Logos, Definition\n\nThe Rhetorical Triangle\n\nRhetoric is a type of communication a writer or speaker uses to persuade, inform or motivate. We can see rhetoric everywhere — politics, law, advertising, creative writing, and even our everyday conversations.\n\nRhetorical devices include irony, metaphor, hyperbole and many other techniques writers and speakers employ to great effect.\n\nA subset of these devices are known as rhetorical appeals, often attributed to Aristotle, and include: ethos, pathos and logos.\n\nThis is also known as the Rhetorical Triangle and we still depend on it today.\n\nEthos, pathos and logos are the three categories of persuasive advertising techniques\n\nEach category invokes a different appeal between speaker and audience.\n\nEthos calls upon the ethics, or what we'd call the values, of the speaker. Pathos elicits emotions in the audience. Finally, logos puts logic into play by using evidence and facts.\n\nGood persuasive advertising technique is when you balance all three.\n\nBut using ethos, pathos and logos in commercials sometimes means featuring one advertising technique prominently.\n\nLearn More Logos Ethos and Pathos\n\nComparing other techniques\n\nThere are many types of rhetorical strategies. To get a full picure on how they work together, or when to use which rhetorical strategies, explore the full guide below.\n\nEverything About Rhetorical Appeals\n\nEach of these rhetorical strategies can be effective in its own way. When combined, their potential effects grow exponentially. To fully understand the power of persusaion, these are the tools you need.\n\nETHOS DEFINITION\n\nWhat is ethos?\n\nEthos is the persuasive technique that appeals to an audience by highlighting credibility. Ethos advertisement techniques invoke the superior “character” of a speaker, presenter, writer, or brand.\n\nEthos examples aim to convince the audience that the advertiser is reliable and ethical. It’s easier to make a decision when someone you respect signs off on it, right? This is broadly the function of ethos in commercials.\n\nWhen an esteemed public figure endorses a product, it validates it to the end consumer. An ethos advertisement plays off the consumer’s respect for a given spokesperson.\n\nThrough that respect, the spokesperson appears convincing, authoritative and trustworthy enough to listen to. Of the types of persuasive techniques in advertising, ethos is best used to unlock trust.\n\nUSE OF ETHOS IN ADVERTISING\n\nHow is ethos used in advertising?\n\nSo what does ethos mean?\n\nIt’s all about credibility. Famous people enjoy a high status in our society. So they’re the ones selling products to us — whether or not they have product-specific expertise.\n\nExample of ethos in advertising: Jennifer Aniston in a campaign for Glaceau Smart Water\n\nFor example, an Infiniti commercial featured Steph Curry. Even though he’s not known for his taste in vehicles, his stature validates the product.\n\nThis is ethos in commercials at work.\n\nExample of ethos in commercials: Steph Curry in a recent spot for Infiniti\n\nEthos rhetoric is also invoked to tie a brand to fundamental rights.\n\nBrands build trust with their audience when they stand with an important cause. Anheuser-Busch illustrated this in their “Born the Hard Way” ad.\n\nEthos examples: This ethos advertisement by Anheuser-Busch underscores the value of multiculturalism\n\nThis spot focuses on the origin story of Anheuser-Busch’s founders.\n\nIt shows Busch’s turbulent immigration from Germany to St. Louis, and speaks to the importance of immigration and multiculturalism.\n\nThis is how ethos rhetoric is used in advertising.\n\nOf the many types of persuasive advertising techniques in advertising, ethos is best for playing up the strength of a brand or spokesperson’s character.\n\nETHOS EXAMPLE IN COMMERCIALS\n\nEthos Advert Case Study\n\nIf you want a really strong example of ethos that also has a pretty funny meta quality to it, check out the shot list for this Heineken spot. See how many times they use foreground elements and OTS shots in this spot:\n\nThis Heineken commercial shows famous actor Benicio Del Toro at the bar enjoying a Heineken. Benicio chats about how both he, and Heineken, are world famous and instantly recognizable.\n\nThen, a pair of goofy tourists spot him in the bar, and they call out for him to pose for a photo, but... they actually think he's Antonio Banderas.\n\nEthos Example in Heineken Commercial\n\nThis commercial not only uses ethos as a way to tie the celebrity of Benicio to the celebrity of Heineken, but it uses humor and the bold faced usage of ethos to make fun of the brand, people, and fame.\n\nTHE \"PLAIN FOLKS\" PERSUASIVE ADVERTISING TECHNIQUE\n\nHow is \"Plain Folks\" used in ads?\n\nEthos rhetoric often employs imagery of everyday, ordinary people.\n\nKnown as the Plain Folks persuasive advertising technique, in this approach a spokesperson or brand appears as an Average Joe to feel common and sensible. In doing so, they appear concerned and cut from the same cloth as you.\n\nThis approach is very common in political ads. Consider the “Family Strong” ad from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nEthos Examples: Hillary Clinton underscores the “Plain Folks” definition in her campaign videos.\n\nDespite her status and wealth, Clinton draws on imagery of her family and upbringing to make her feel more relatable. In this way, “Plain” folks is propaganda and also a logical fallacy.\n\nBut it’s also an effective and persuasive advertising technique.\n\nOf the types of persuasive techniques in advertising, Plain Folks aligns your brand with the values of the everyday consumer.\n\nPathos DEFINITION\n\nWhat is pathos?\n\nPathos is persuasive technique that try to convince an audience through emotions. Pathos advertisement techniques appeal to the senses, memory, nostalgia, or shared experience. Pathos examples pull at the heartstrings and make the audience feel.\n\nA quick way to appeal to a viewer’s emotions? A cute animal. A devastated family. A love story. Overcoming great odds. An inspirational song and imagery. A good zinger.\n\nEmotions create responses and, in our increasingly consumer-driven culture, the response is to buy something. Pathos appeals to an audience’s basic emotions like joy, fear, and envy. All are easily triggered in many ways.\n\nSo what is pathos?\n\nWell, it's a model enjoying a refreshing Coke. Or a frustrated infomercial character desperate for a better remedy. And \"tired\" of the \"same old blah-blah-blah.\"\n\nThe many different pathos advertisement examples not only evoke your feelings but anticipate your responses too. If you want to explore pathos in advertising, language is the best place to start.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the words we hear and read trigger specific feelings. Positive words conjure feelings of love, excitement and wonder.\n\nWhat is pathos? Cutting to the emotional core, really\n\nLook at how General Mills and Cheerios achieved this in their “Good Goes Round” campaign.\n\nExample of pathos: This Cheerios pathos advertisement injects good vibes with positive words\n\nWe see sunshine, smiles and bright colors while we hear the words “good goes around.” It invites positivity and encourages us to associate Cheerios accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, pathos advertisements can also employ unpleasant emotions like fear and worry just as effectively.\n\nPathos examples: this somber pathos advertisement says don’t let heart disease happen to you\n\nThis ad by the British Heart Foundation underscores the dangers of heart disease. As the spot unfolds, you start to realize that the narrator suddenly died at her sister’s wedding.\n\nHer tragic story encourages you to not let it happen to you.\n\nPathos examples: BMW warns against drinking and driving in this pathos advertisement example\n\nPaTHOS EXAMPLE IN COMMERCIALS\n\nPathos advert case study\n\nIf you want a really strong example of pathos is an advertisement, check out this shot list from a particularly emotional Zillow spot. Notice how the shots on the son are often singles and medium close-ups:\n\nThis Zillow commercial shows a father and son who have just suffered the terrible loss of their wife/mother. The father tries to cheer his son up by finding a new home, one preferably near the boy's grandparents.\n\nThe son seems disinterested, but then the father finds his son and the family dog looking up at the stars, one of which is particularly bright. The son decides that the star is his mother, looking down on him.\n\nThat gives the father an idea:\n\nPathos example in Zillow Commercial\n\nThe father searches on Zillow, finds a home, and buys it. We then learn that the home is not only close to the grandparents, but it also has a skylight in the son's room, allowing him to see his Mother's star at night.\n\nThis commercial uses the emotions of the father, the son, the grandparents, and of course the viewer to suggest that Zillow is the type of website that can balm grief through its functionality.\n\nUSE OF PATHOS IN ADVERTISING\n\nThe appeal of pathos in advertising\n\nSex appeal is of course also hugely successful among the pathos advertising techniques. Open any Cosmopolitan magazine and you’ll find scantily clad models, muscular men and sexual innuendo.\n\nAlthough the common expression “sex sells” has been debated, sexually provocative ads do leave a lasting impression. Mr. Clean, for example, spiced up their eponymous mascot for comedic effect.\n\nPathos Examples: This Mr. Clean pathos advertisement gave their mascot a sexy upgrade\n\nTheir brawny Mr. Clean upgrade wears tight clothes and turns mopping the floor into something more... sensual?\n\nHumor, patriotism and snob appeal are also all common in pathos advertisement examples. The pathos definition even extends to nostalgia and the strategic use of music in ads.\n\nPathos Examples: The pathos definition extends to evoking emotions with music ... even *NSYNC\n\nTHE BANDWAGON ADVERTISING TECHNIQUE\n\nWhat is the \"bandwagon advertising\"?\n\n“Bandwagon advertising” is commonly categorized under pathos advertisement examples. While it may sound unfamiliar, you're probably pretty familiar with it. It creates that impression that using certain product will put you on the “winning team.” It adheres to the pathos definition because it plays off your fear... of being left out.\n\nOld Spice used this in their “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” spot.\n\nBandwagon advertising: to be The Man Your Man Could Smell Like, you buy Old Spice\n\nIn its comical way, it puts pressure on men to smell as good as the Old Spice Guy. Like the “Plain Folks” technique, Bandwagon advertising is a very popular form of propaganda.\n\nOf the persuasive advertising techniques, “Bandwagon” puts your brand on the right side of popular opinion. Remember the \"Be like Mike\" Ads?\n\nPathos example: Talk about putting the consumer on the \"winning team\"\n\nLOGOS DEFINITION\n\nWhat is logos?\n\nLogos is the persuasive technique that aims to convince an audience by using logic and reason. Also called “the logical appeal,” logos examples in advertisement include the citation of statistics, facts, charts, and graphs.\n\nLogos Examples: This Samsung ad puts the Logos persuasive advertising technique to work\n\nEver told someone to “listen to reason” during an argument? This is what logos does. The best logos advertisement examples are when a speaker appeals to logic. Statistics, surveys, facts, and historical data can make a product seem like a more reasonable decision. Whether the data is sound or not is another story.\n\nLOGOS EXAMPLE IN COMMERCIALS\n\nLogos advert case study\n\nIf you want a really strong example of logos is an advertisement, check out this shot list from a recent Nissan Commercial. You'll notice how the camera angles and shot size change when the \"ProPilot\" system clicks on:\n\nThis Nissan commercial shows a daughter and father driving on a highway. The daughter is about to drive past some scary construction, but then the father uses his sage like wisdom to instruct her to turn on the \"ProPilot\" system that Nissan now features in their cars.\n\nOnce the daughter does this, we see a Star Wars battle scene playing out in front of out eyes, and she becomes so distracted that she begin to veer off the road... but guess what? The \"ProPilot\" system saves her by auto-correcting the trajectory of the car based on the sensor system.\n\nSo how is this logos? Well, the commercial places the daughter in a relatively common situation and uses the machine logic behind having a guided system in the car to keep your distracted children safe.\n\nNow... is it logical that this Star Wars homage suggests the daughter reach out to use the force by using a guided machine? Of course not! That's the opposite of what Luke does in the movie. Is it logical for your kid to be scared of driving past construction at 40mph? Of course not!\n\nIs there anything in this spot that is logical? The basic fact that young drivers get distracted, and the Nissan \"ProPilot\" system might just save their lives one day, well that is how you use logic to sell cars.\n\nLOGOS TECHNIQUES\n\nHow is logos being used in advertising?\n\nTechnology advertisements use logos because their goal is to showcase cool new features. Consider the example of logos in Apple’s ad for the iPhone:\n\nA logos advertisement example: In Apple’s iPhone spot, the features pop out at you\n\nIn logos rhetoric, you have to the sell best reasons to buy your product.\n\nHow does Apple do that?\n\nThey have their new innovative features pop out at you. From durable glass to Face ID software. It effectively asks you why you would choose any phone but iPhone. Logos often use buzzwords to sell the product.\n\nWhat's a great example of this?\n\nFood companies capitalizing on the rising demand for healthy choices.\n\nLogos Examples: I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter underscore the health benefits\n\nThis I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter ad hinges on the health benefits to prove their point. Of the types of persuasive techniques in advertising, logos will build your brand as the most logical, functional and helpful option.\n\nLearn More Logos Ethos and Pathos\n\nComparing other techniques\n\nThere are many types of rhetorical strategies. To get a full picure on how they work together, or when to use which rhetorical strategies, explore the full guide below.\n\nEverything About Rhetorical Appeals\n\nEach of these rhetorical strategies can be effective in its own way. When combined, their potential effects grow exponentially. To fully understand the power of persusaion, these are the tools you need.\n\nUp Next\n\nExplore more rhetorical devices\n\nEthos, pathos, and logos are highly effective rhetorical appeals but there is much more to explore, including kairos and telos. Or dive into more rhetorical devices that help construct and support these appeals, including metaphor, hyperbole, and metonymy. When you've mastered these techniques, your ability to convince and persuade in your writing will be unmatched.\n\nUp Next: Rhetorical Devices Index →"
