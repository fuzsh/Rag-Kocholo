        "text": "GARDNER, John (1926-2007).\n\nLondon: Frederick Muller, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1970,1970, 1975. [Cold War Thrillers] ALL FIRST EDITIONS. Eight volumes. Octavos (21 x 14 x 19cm). Publisher's hardcover cloth bindings, seven in pictorial dust-jackets. Contets clean, no inscriptions, some light spotting to some edges, wrappers lightly worn, with the odd chip/rub, spine sunned to final volume. Very good or better. The full collection of secret agent Boysie Oakes novel, written before Gardner's stint as the official James Bond novelist. Many of these had small print runs, some apparently tiny; this hardback first of Traitor's Exit took ten years to locate (even then, lacking the jacket). A particularly difficult set to assemble. From the comprehensive archive assembled by Jon Gilbert (pencil signature within). His encyclopaedic guide to the works of Ian Fleming (2012) won the 16th Breslauer Prize for bibliography. Item #67004\n\nHubin; Crime Fiction IV.\n\nPrice: Â£495.00"
