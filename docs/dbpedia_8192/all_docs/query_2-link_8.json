It was made into a film in 1965 staring Rod Taylor and Trevor Howard. It is perfect for fans of classic British spy fiction, including Ian Fleming, Len Deighton, and Desmond Bagley.\n\nBefore coming an author of fiction in the early 1960s John Gardner was variously a stage magician, a Royal Marine officer and a journalist. In all Gardner has fifty-four novels to his credit, including Maestro, which was the New York Times book of the year. He was also invited by Ian Flemings literary copyright holders to write a series of continuation James Bond novels, which proved to be so successful that instead of the contracted three books he went on to publish some fourteen titles, including Licence Renewed and Icebreaker. Having lived in the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the UK, John Gardner sadly died in August of 2007 having just completed his third novel in the Moriarty trilogy, Conan Doyles eponymous villain of the Sherlock Holmes series.\n\n'Cool polished story-telling with all the sexy sidelines in the best James Bond tradition' Evening Standard\n\nGenre: Mystery\n\nVisitors also looked at these books\n\nUsed availability for John E Gardner's The Liquidator\n\nSearch for\n\nAbout Fantastic Fiction Information for Authors"
