        "text": "Charlottesville resident John Gardner is the author of the popular Boysie Oakes novels in the 1960s and, more recently, the \"Secret Generations\" trilogy. These days, he probably is more widely known for reviving Ian Fleming's James Bond in 11 novels.\n\nOn June 12 he'll be in town to sign copies of his newest Bond thriller, \"Never Send Flowers,\" published by Putnam's. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., he's scheduled to be at the Ram's Head Book Shop in Towers Mall. Then from 2-4 p.m. he'll be at Books Strings & Things on the City Market.\n\n- MIKE MAYO, Book Page Editor\n\nby CNB"
