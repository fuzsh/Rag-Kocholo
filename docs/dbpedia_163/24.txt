Pros:

A pro would be that the drama genre is sometimes very emotional and can have a very personal affect on someone which makes them connect more to the film.

They are mostly really well-written story lines that are very effective to delivering a dramatic and realistic performance to the audience.

There is often a lot of emotion in a good drama to cause the audience to feel upset and sometimes even cry at a very meaningful scene. This shows that the actors have done their part correctly and the director has done this work correctly as well to make the audience feel this upset from the genre of drama.

To the relevance of my last con point, as the drama is about music I have more knowledge already to begin my opening sequence and as I have a more musical mind, I have a good idea of how to create my sequence.

Cons:

There could sometimes, but very rarely, be some abusive, inappropriate language in the drama that can offend some viewers in the audience.

There could also be some unsuitable violence/aggression that can affect particular viewers and give them the wrong messages.

One of the cons is that the quality of actors would have to be very good in order to make the narrative actually seem realistic and include a lot of emotion through-out the film, if there was to be laughing and half smiles during a serious scene, it would release the tension and emotion from any dramatic scene created in that moment.

In the view of practical abilities for doing this as my opening sequence, it would be very difficult to acquire the actors that can deliver the emotion needed and to ensure it they create the dramatic atmosphere in my sequence. This would be a challenge.
