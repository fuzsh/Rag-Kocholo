All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent (mimesis) characters. In this broader sense, drama is a mode distinct from novels, short stories, and narrative poetry or songs.

In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television, "drama" came to be used within the theatre as a generic term to describe a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy.

It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted. "Radio drama" has been used in both sensesâ€”originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.
