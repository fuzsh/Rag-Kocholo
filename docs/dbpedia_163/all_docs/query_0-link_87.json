        "text": "Nessun Dorma is probably the most famous opera song used in movies. Nessun Dorma (in English, “None shall Sleep”) is an aria from the opera Turandot.\n\nListen to Pavarotti sing Nessun Dorma\n\nWritten in Italian by Giacomo Puccini it premiered at La Scala opera house in 1926 after the death of the composer. Puccini had left with the opera unfinished. His family chose Franco Alfano to complete it.\n\nAt the first performance, the orchestra stopped playing in the middle of Act III. Then the conductor, Arturo Toscanini, told the audience “Qui finisce l’opera, perché a questo punto il maestro è morto” (“Here the opera ends, because at this point the maestro died”). The curtain was then lowered. The new ending was then always played at subsequent performances.\n\nThe aria, Nessun Dorma, is the final act of Turandot. The eponymous princess challenges all prospective suitors to three riddles. The opera revolves around the first prince to succeed in solving her riddles.\n\nIn Act 3, the Princess admits that she still does not want to marry the prince. He offers to waive the marriage if she finds out his real name before the next day. She tells everyone in her kingdom that they shall not sleep until the name is discovered. The aria is sung by the prince as he realises dawn is coming and he is going to win (in Italian, Vincerò!).\n\nNessun Dorma was popularised in the UK in 1990. The BBC chose Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti’s 1972 version sung with the London Philharmonic Orchestra as the theme music for Italia 90 – the Men’s FIFA World Cup held in Italy that year.\n\nPavarotti then sung the aria twice during a concert the night before the final match of the tournament. The first time he performed it alone then he teamed up with two other legendary tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras, to sing it as an encore.\n\nThe live recording of this concert became the best-selling clasical music album of all time. It launched the Three Tenors on the world stage as an operatic supergroup. They then repeated their Three Tenors concert, including their trio version of Nessun Dorma, at the next 3 men’s football World Cups. These were in Los Angeles, USA in 1994; Paris, France 1998 and Yokohama, Japan 2002."
