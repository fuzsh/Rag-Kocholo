        "meta_description": "The Soundtrack; The Soundtrack is a multi-disciplinary, double-blind peer-reviewed journal that brings together research in the area of music and sound in relation to film and other moving image media, including television, games and installations. A complex cultural, technological, industrial and artistic phenomenon, sound-with-moving image is a rich area for analysis, investigation and speculation. We encourage writing that is accessible to audiences from a diversity of intellectual backgrounds and disciplines as well as providing a forum for practitioners to discuss and describe their work. The Soundtrack's aim is to nurture this new and expanding area of academic investigation in dialogue with soundtrack producers of all kinds.\r\nFor more information, to access the journal or to subscribe visit the Discover platform here.",
