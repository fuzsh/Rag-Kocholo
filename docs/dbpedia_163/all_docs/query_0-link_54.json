        "text": "Music and Movies go hand in hand and have been a natural combination ever since sound was first added to moving images. Whether the film is an action-packed thriller a tear-jerking drama or a side-splitting comedy, the right song at the right moment will always elevate the impact of a scene.\n\nMovies have produced some of the biggest hits of all time, and in some cases, these soundtrack songs are now more famous than the films they came from. Sometimes it’s a perfect thematic fit with the film’s narrative. Sometimes it just sounds good. These songs are forever ingrained in the history of both music and film as a result of their popularity and greatness. Here are 50 movie soundtrack anthems.\n\nWhitney Houston – ‘I Will Always Love You’ (The Bodyguard)\n\nWritten and originally recorded in 1973 by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton, Whitney Houston‘s version peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for a then-record-breaking 14 weeks. When the 1974 recording of the song reached number one on the country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley’s manager, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused.\n\nBJ Thomas – ‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head’ (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid)\n\nThis song was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Based loosely on fact, the film tells the story of Wild West outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker, known as Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman), and his partner Harry Longabaugh, the “Sundance Kid” (Robert Redford), who are on the run from a crack US posse after a string of train robberies. The single topped the US chart and won an Oscar for Best Original Song. Ray Stevens (The Streak) was first offered the opportunity to record it for the film but turned it down. Bob Dylan is supposed to have been approached for the song, but he reportedly declined too.\n\nBerlin – ‘Take My Breath Away’ (Top Gun)\n\nThe main love theme from Tom Cruise’s Top Gun movie, “Take My Breath Away” was written by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock and was performed by the American new wave band Berlin who formed in Los Angeles in 1978. The second single from the Top Gun soundtrack album, following Kenny Loggins’ “Danger Zone”, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1986. Berlin disbanded right after reaching global success. The song was first offered to The Motels, who much later released their original demo.\n\nJoe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes – ‘Up Where We Belong’ (An Officer and a Gentleman)\n\nWritten by Jack Nitzsche, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Will Jennings and recorded by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes for the 1982 film. Cocker and Warnes were awarded the Grammy for Best Pop Performance and Nitzsche, Sainte-Marie, and Jennings won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nHuey Lewis & the News – ‘The Power of Love’ (Back to the Future)\n\nThe ultimate feel-good ’80s movie pop anthem, Huey Lewis was hired to come up with a couple of tunes for Back to the Future, the song became the band’s first number-one hit in the US. McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his band play a hard rock version of the song for a Battle of the Bands audition, at which a judge played by Huey Lewis tells Marty’s group that they are “just too darn loud.”\n\nKenny Loggins – ‘Footloose’ (Footloose)\n\nCo-written with Dean Pitchford and recorded by American singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins, it was released in January 1984 as the first of two singles by Loggins from the 1984 film of the same name. Kenny Loggins’s early soundtrack contributions date back to A Star Is Born in 1976 and he is known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack after he experienced a string of soundtrack successes.\n\nBette Midler – ‘The Wind Beneath My Wings’ (Beaches)\n\nThe song was first recorded by Australian singer Kamahl in 1982 for a country and western album. A heartbreaking ballad performed by Midler at the end of Beaches, in this instance singing about the importance of lifelong friendships. The song won Grammy Awards for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nJohn Travolta & Olivia Newton-John – ‘You’re the One that I Want’ (Grease)\n\nWritten and produced by John Farrar, and released in 1978 as the second single from Grease. As a songwriter and producer, Farrar worked with Olivia Newton-John from 1971 to 1989. He wrote her US number-one hit single: “Have You Never Been Mellow” (1975), “Hopelessly Devoted to You” (1978), and “Magic” (1980). The song is one of the best-selling singles in history to date, having sold over 4 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom alone, with estimates of more than 15 million copies sold overall.\n\nThe Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss) – Cher (Mermaids)\n\nIt took Cher over 25 years to score a Number 1 song by herself. Written and composed by Rudy Clark (Who also wrote “Got My Mind Set on You” a number 1 hit for George Harrison), the Shoop Shoop Song was first released as a single in 1963 by Merry Clayton.\n\nUnchained Melody – The Righteous Brothers (Ghost)\n\nThis 1955 song with music by Alex North and lyrics by Hy Zaret was first written as a theme for the prison film Unchained (1955) hence the song title. While not specially recorded for the movie it came from, “Unchained Melody” will forever be associated with Ghost. In the film the song appears both in instrumental and vocal form, the latter being the version recorded by Bobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers in 1965.\n\nLa Bamba – Los Lobos (La Bamba)\n\nA cover of a classic Mexican folk song to promote a biopic of the late Richie Valens. The song is best known for a 1958 adaptation by Ritchie Valens, a Top 40 hit in the US charts. Los Lobos interestingly knocked another movie theme tune off the top to get to Number 1, Madonna‘s Who’s That Girl, managing two weeks there in the summer 1987.\n\nNight Fever – Bee Gees (Saturday Night Fever)\n\n1978 was a big year for movies, especially ones starring John Travolta. Months before Grease’s chart takeover, the soundtrack to his other starring role in Saturday Night Fever was having a moment. The album spent a whopping 18 consecutive weeks at Number 1 from May 1978, and its centrepiece, the Bee Gees‘ Night Fever, spent two weeks at the top.\n\nMy Heart Will Go On – Celine Dion (Titanic)\n\nThe biggest film of 1998, became the highest-grossing film of all time. Featuring the mega-hit ‘My Heart Will Go On’ the only vocal track on the album, the Titanic soundtrack spent 16 weeks on the Billboard 200 and launched the career of Celine Dion. Composed by James Horner, with lyrics by Will Jennings it topped the charts in more than 25 countries and was the best-selling single of 1998. With worldwide sales estimated at more than 18 million, it is the second-best-selling single by a woman in music history and one of the Best-Selling singles of all time.\n\n(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life – Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes (Dirty Dancing)\n\nDirty Dancing produced several hits upon its release in 1987, including Eric Carmen’s ‘Hungry Eyes,’ Patrick Swayze’s ‘She’s Like the Wind’ and ‘(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life’ by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. The song has won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWilson Phillips – ‘Hold On’ (Bridesmaids)\n\nIn one of cinema’s most rousing endings, the 2011 comedy Bridesmaids gave a new lease of life to 1990’s biggest hit from American trio Wilson Phillips. In the film, the characters played by Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph fondly recall the song from their teenage years. Wilson Phillips then makes an appearance to sing the song at the wedding at the end of the film.\n\nMichael Sembello – ‘Maniac’ (Flashdance)\n\nOriginally intended as a horror movie song, the original idea for the song came to the song’s co-writer Dennis Matkosky while watching a news report on a serial killer. It was later reworked as a song to play while Jennifer Beals trained hard at home, it became a big ’80s pop hit for Sembello. The soundtrack album of Flashdance has gone on to sell over six million copies in the US alone. In 1984, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special.\n\nSonny & Cher – ‘I Got You Babe’ (Groundhog Day)\n\nBill Murray may have grown to hate this song thanks to his character Phil constantly hearing it every time he woke up, but it’s now an iconic movie song because of his suffering. The American fantasy romantic comedy tells the story of a cynical television weatherman (Bill Murray), covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.\n\nBarbra Streisand – ‘The Way We Were’ (The Way We Were)\n\nThis American romantic drama film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford was nominated for several awards and won the Academy Awards for Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Original Song for the theme song ‘The Way We Were’.

A music video was shot in London, and features Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito as lip-synching backing vocalists. The video was initially banned on Top of the Pops because the actors were not part of the Musicians’ Union, meaning DeVito’s miming of the saxophone solo went against the rules.\n\nIsaac Hayes – ‘Theme from Shaft (Shaft)\n\nFuture South Park star Isaac Hayes created one of Funk’s finest moments for the main theme for the 1971 drama. Hayes became the first African American to win the Best Original Song Oscar – or any Academy Award in a non-acting category. In 2000, Hayes told National Public Radio that he had only agreed to write and record the Shaft score after the film’s producer, Joel Freeman, promised him an audition for the lead role, which was taken by a then-unknown Richard Roundtree. Hayes, who also had no acting experience, never got the chance to audition but kept his end of the deal anyway.\n\nIrene Cara – ‘Fame’ (Fame)\n\nBefore Flashdance, Irene Cara (who played the role of Coco Hernandez in the original film), was hired to record the theme tune for the 1980 musical film Fame. Set in New York City, it chronicles the lives and hardships of students attending The High School of Performing Arts, from their auditions to their freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years. It was Irene’s debut single, and it won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song. The song was later used as the theme song for the Fame television series, which aired from 1982 to 1987.\n\nStarship – ‘Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now’ (Mannequin)\n\nPop-rock veterans Starship provided this ’80s anthem as the main theme song to the romantic comedy Mannequin in 1987.

Warren has written nine number-one songs and 33 top-10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCoolio – ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ (Dangerous Minds)\n\nThe 1995 movie Dangerous Minds might not have had a lasting legacy, but its main theme from rapper Coolio and singer LV very much has. Sampling the Stevie Wonder song ‘Pastime Paradise’, the huge-selling single also featured an appearance from the film’s main star Michelle Pfieffer. The song was the number one biggest-selling single of 1995 on the US Billboard chart.\n\nBen E King – ‘Stand By Me’ (Stand By Me)\n\nThe 1986 American coming-of-age drama film gave the Ben E King soul classic a new lease of life thanks to its use in the film. Originally released in 1961, King had written it for the Drifters, who passed on recording it. After a recording session in 1960, King had some studio time left over. The session’s producers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller asked if he had any more songs. King played it on the piano for them. They liked it and called the studio musicians back in to record it. There have been over 400 recorded versions of the song, performed by many artists, notably Otis Redding and John Lennon.\n\nRoxette – ‘It Must Have Been Love’ (Pretty Woman)\n\nOriginally a Christmas song, (“It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted)”, the festive references were removed as Swedish pop duo Roxette recorded a new version for the Pretty Woman soundtrack. Its use in the film made the song a massive international hit. The song was a massive hit in Norway, where it spent twelve weeks at number one.\n\nRay Parker Jr – ‘Ghostbusters’ (Ghostbusters)\n\nParker was approached by the film’s producers to create a theme song, although he only had a few days to do so and the film’s title seemed impossible to include in any lyrics. However, when watching television late at night, Parker saw a commercial for a local service that reminded him that the film had a similar commercial featured for the fictional business. This inspired him to write the song as a pseudo-advertising jingle. Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, stated that he was approached to write the Ghostbusters theme but declined the opportunity as he did not want to be known as a soundtrack artist.\n\nSteppenwolf – ‘Born to Be Wild’ (Easy Rider)\n\nSometimes, “Born to Be Wild” is described as the first heavy metal song, and the second verse lyric “heavy metal thunder” marks the first use of this term in rock music. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper play two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and South, carrying the proceeds from a cocaine deal. Easy Rider explores the societal landscape, issues, and tensions towards adolescents in the United States during the 1960s, such as the rise of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyle. Real drugs were used in scenes showing the use of marijuana and other substances\n\nStealers Wheel – ‘Stuck in the Middle with You’ (Reservoir Dogs)\n\n“Stuck in the Middle with You” was released on Stealers Wheel’s 1972 eponymous debut album. Written by Scottish musicians Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan, Rafferty provided the lead vocals, with Egan singing harmony.

Parr was inspired to write the lyrics not by the movie (which he had not seen) but by the Canadian athlete Rick Hansen who, at the time, was travelling around the world via his wheelchair to raise awareness for spinal cord injuries.\n\nKenny Loggins – ‘Danger Zone’ (Top Gun)\n\nThe soundtrack to the 1986 American action drama film Top Gun, was the the best-selling of 1986, and one of the best-selling of all time. The story was inspired by an article titled “Top Guns”, written by Ehud Yonay and published in California magazine three years earlier. The band Toto was originally intended to perform the track, but legal conflicts between the producers of Top Gun and the band’s lawyers prevented this. The film producers offered the song to Loggins. Reaching number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Danger Zone” was kept out of the number 1 spot by Peter Gabriel‘s “Sledgehammer”. It became Loggins’ second-highest chart hit, bested only by his 1984 number 1 hit “Footloose”.\n\nJohn Travolta & Olivia Newton-John – ‘Summer Nights’ (Grease)\n\nIn the movie version of Grease, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John played the lead roles of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson. Grease was certainly the word in 1978, when it ruled the charts with several massive hits from the soundtrack. This opening number between the pair and their pals is still a karaoke favourite nearly 50 years later. The song spent seven weeks at number 1. In the UK, and combined with an earlier nine-week run with “You’re the One That I Want,” the Travolta-Newton-John duet team spent 16 weeks at number 1 in 1978 in the UK.\n\nSeal – ‘Kiss from a Rose’ (Batman Forever)\n\nSeal wrote ‘Kiss from a Rose’ in 1987, several years before the release of his eponymous debut album from 1991 but felt embarrassed by it and threw the tape in the corner. The second single taken from the Batman Forever film soundtrack, it topped the US Billboard Hot 100. It also was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Song from a Movie in 1996. The soundtrack also gave U2 a major hit with “Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me”.\n\nTina Turner – ‘We Don’t Need Another Hero’ (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome)\n\nWritten by Graham Lyle and Terry Britten (who also wrote Turner’s hit “What’s Love Got to Do with It?”), this power ballad received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. As songwriters, Lyle and Britten received the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. The 1985 Australian post-apocalyptic action film stars Mel Gibson and Tina Turner in a story of a lone roving warrior who is exiled into the desert, and encounters an isolated child cargo cult, centred on a crashed Boeing 747 and its deceased captain.\n\nPeter Cetera – ‘The Glory of Love’ (The Karate Kid II)\n\nThe song was recorded by Cetera shortly after he left the band Chicago to pursue a solo career. Featured in the film The Karate Kid Part II (1986), it was Cetera’s first hit single after he left the band, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Cetera has said that he originally wrote and composed “Glory of Love” as the end title for the film Rocky IV (1985), but it was passed over by United Artists.\n\nPharrel Williams – ‘Happy’ (Despicable Me 2)\n\nFrom the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack, Pharrell became one of the few artists to land three separate stints at Number 1 with the same song and landed his third million-seller within a year. “Happy” was the biggest song of 2014, and sold over 1.94 million downloads to become the eighth biggest-selling singles of all time in the UK.\n\nSurvivor – ‘The Eye of the Tiger’ (Rocky III)\n\nSylvester Stallone, the director and star of Rocky III, enlisted Survivor to write the song after the band Queen denied him permission to use their song “Another One Bites the Dust”. “Eye of the Tiger” was written by the guitarist, Frankie Sullivan, and the keyboardist, Jim Peterik. They conceived a riff based on chord changes to mirror the timing of punches. They took the title from a line spoken by Rocky’s coach, Apollo Creed: “You had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge… You gotta get it back.” Stallone took the phrase from the 1969 film A Dream of Kings.\n\nChristopher Cross – ‘Arthur’s Theme’ (Arthur)\n\nThis was the main theme for the 1981 film Arthur starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981 and was a number-one hit in the US. It was written in collaboration between Cross, pop legend Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach’s frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. The line in the chorus “When you get caught between the moon and New York City” was taken from an unreleased song written by Allen and Bayer Sager. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nPatrick Swayze – ‘She’s Like the Wind’ (Dirty Dancing)\n\nSwayze and Stacy Widelitz co-wrote the song in 1984.

During the production of Dirty Dancing in 1987, Swayze played the demo for producer Linda Gottlieb and director Emile Ardolino.

Two years later, it was the UK’s surprise Christmas number one after a new single release, and it remains one of cinema’s most moving music moments.\n\nJohn Parr – ‘St. Elmo’s Fire (Man in Motion)’ (St. Elmo’s Fire)\n\nThe song hit No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on 7 September 1985, remaining there for two weeks.

The power ballad was the lead single for both the soundtrack album from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Adams’s sixth studio album, Waking Up the Neighbours (1991). The song was written in London, UK at the studio Adams was working at in 1990, and he and Mutt Lange wrote it in 45 minutes.\n\nBruce Springsteen – ‘Streets of Philadelphia’ (Philadelphia)\n\nWritten by Bruce Springsteen for the 1993 film Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, this was the first Hollywood big-budget, big-star film to tackle the issue of AIDS in the US.

The recording featured every current member of the group except Brian Wilson, who did not attend the sessions. The film which stars Tom Cruise, Bryan Brown and Elisabeth Shue tells the story of a young New York City business student, who takes up bartending to make ends meet.\n\nQueen – ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ (Wayne’s World)\n\nIn 1992, Mike Myers used “Bohemian Rhapsody” as the rambunctious centrepiece of the indelible opening scene of the film, Wayne’s World, which had been adapted from a Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, and gave the song and the band behind it an unprecedented second life. Despite being bedbound, Freddie Mercury was able to watch a preview of the scene before his death on 24th November 1991, and he loved it.\n\nRandy Newman – ‘You’ve Got a Friend in Me’ (Toy Story)\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter scored hits as a recording artist including “Short People” (1977), “I Love L.A.” (1983), while other artists have enjoyed success with cover versions of his “Mama Told Me Not to Come” (1966), “I Think It’s Going to Rain Today” (1968) and “You Can Leave Your Hat On” (1972). ‘You’ve Got a Friend in Me’ was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nChuck Berry – ‘Johnny B Goode’ (Back to the Future)\n\nOne of the most memorable moments from Back to the Future is when Marty McFly, played by Michael J Fox, is on stage at his parents’ 1955 “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance playing “Johnny B. Goode”. Marty’s singing voice was that of Mark Campbell, a member of the soul and R&B band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Campbell wasn’t credited as the production crew wanted to fully make the illusion that Fox was singing, but music supervisor Bones Howe made sure Campbell got a small percentage of the soundtrack revenue as compensation.\n\nAs for Michael J Fox learning guitar, that was done via 2 methods. Fist off, Michael was taught how to play the actual song by Paul Hanson, who is a famed guitar coach in Hollywood. Michael got so good he told Robert Zemeckis he could cut to his hands playing anytime time, as he was that confident in his abilities to play the song.\n\nJudy Garland – ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ (The Wizard of Oz)\n\n“Over the Rainbow”, also known as “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”, may just be the most iconic movie song of them all. The ballad by Harold Arlen with lyrics by Yip Harburg was written for the 1939 American musical fantasy film The Wizard of Oz, in which it was sung by actress Judy Garland in her starring role as Dorothy Gale. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Garland’s signature song.
