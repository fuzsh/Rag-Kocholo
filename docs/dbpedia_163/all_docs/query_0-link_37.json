        "text": "The drama minor at Berklee has at its foundation the belief that theater is best understood when performed. Students balance course work in theory, history, writing, and literature with course work in the applied arts of theatrical performance. The minor provides an opportunity for students to study dramatic literature, to write scripts, and to practice theatrical artsâ€”to write, act, perform, direct, and produce plays and musicals. Students explore theater's history and rich literature. They explore theater as a global art embodying diverse cultures and traditions. In addition, they develop their skills in writing dramatic works and in acting, as well as skills in dance, design, and production. Through the minor, students synthesize the interdisciplinary nature of theatrical creation and performance."
