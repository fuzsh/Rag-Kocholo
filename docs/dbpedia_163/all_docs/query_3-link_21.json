        "text": "In this article, Ufuk Önen recommends that the first step into the world of audio post-production for film and visual media should be to get a good grasp of what kinds of sounds there are in films and their functions rather than diving right into the technical side. This article is especially for you if you are starting out in audio post-production.\n\nWhat Is Soundtrack?\n\nIt all starts with this question: What is 'soundtrack'?\n\nThe popular answer would be to say the music contained in a film, but surely it is way more than that? The soundtrack is the entire audio content of a film or video. All components of sounds in a film are collectively referred to as soundtrack.\n\nNow, let's break the soundtrack down into categories.\n\nThe soundtrack has three essential ingredients:\n\nHuman voices\n\nSound effects\n\nMusic\n\n1 - Human Voices\n\nHuman voices in a film are monologues, dialogs, and voice-overs.\n\nMonologues are speeches given by one actor. Its origin is the Greek word 'monologos,' which means speaking alone.\n\nDialogues are conversations between two or more people. While every effort is made to record dialogues as cleanly as possible during the filming, a proportion of the location sound ends up being unusable because film sets can be rather noisy places, and are often chosen for their look rather than their sound!\n\nWhen the tragedy strikes, the dialogue is re-recorded in the studio during the post-production phase with a technique called ADR (Automatic Dialog Replacement). Originally called looping, the ADR process involves an actor watching the image repeatedly while listening to the original production track on headphones as a guide and re-performing each line to match wording, lip movements, and emotions.\n\nIn this video, featuring veteran ADR mixer Doc Kane of Walt Disney Studio you will see that there is nothing automatic about ADR. It requires lots of talent and hard work!\n\n2 - Sound Effects\n\nIn film jargon, the term 'sound effects' refers to an entire hierarchy of sound elements that are recorded or electronically/digitally produced. Any sound that is not a human voice or music is generally accepted as a sound effect.\n\nThere are four main categories of sound effects: Principal effects, background sound effects, foley, and designed sound effects.\n\nPrincipal effects, sometimes called hard effects, are the 'what-you-see-is-what-you-hear' type of sounds: You see a car passing by on the screen, you hear a car passing by. You see somebody firing a gun, you hear a gunshot sound. These sounds are usually, but not exclusively, recorded outside the studio by field recording teams.\n\nBackground sound effects (BGs), also called ambient sounds or ambience for short, are the sounds that are present in a location, whether it is indoor or outdoor. Although we label them as background, this does not mean they are not important. On the contrary, they are an essential part of the soundtrack because they indicate the setting to the audience. Traffic noises, forest sounds, a variety of noises heard in a large department store are all examples of background sound effects.\n\nFoley sound effects are live sounds that are matched with the action in the film. They are created by foley sound artists by watching the picture and mimicking the actions with appropriate props. Foley is a combination of creativity and performance. This technique, which is still used today, is named after Jack Foley, who developed it in the 1930s at Universal Studios. Here is a great video demonstrating the art of foley.\n\n3 - Music\n\nWe can break down music in films into three sub-categories: Soundtrack, source music, and score.\n\nSoundtrack - Even though, as we said at the beginning of this article that all sounds in a film are collectively referred to as soundtrack, the term ‘soundtrack’ is also used for the songs featured in a movie and for a collection (album) of them. These are often existing songs; in other words, they are not created for that movie.\n\nSource music is a song or a piece of music that is visually performed or comes from a prop, such as TV or radio. For example, in the film, in a bar scene, we see a band playing. That music is source music.\n\nI saved the best for the last: Score!\n\nScore is the music composed exclusively for a film by a composer. A score's primary function is to heighten emotions provoked by the imagery and provide an emotional or atmospheric environment or background to the action on screen.\n\nFilm music composers compose their music following what happens on-screen - minute by minute, second by second, and even frame by frame. Unlike traditional and mainstream genres, film scores do not have a specific structure such as verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, verse, chorus, and so forth. Film scores are not based on traditional musical forms but on what appears on the screen.\n\nFactors such as economics and studio contracts have an influence when it comes to choosing a composer for a film. However, the crucial element is the relationship between the composer and the director.\n\nTo learn more about composing music for film, check out Walter Everton’s excellent article How To Compose Music In Pro Tools.\n\nMost directors are not musicians. Even though some directors do not understand the music jargon, the director and composer need to be able to speak the same language without talking about music. When the director says, \"I want something sinister sounding here\" or \"I need to feel everything is opening up here,\" the composer needs to be able to translate that into music.\n\nLong-lasting professional partnerships based on this, as exemplified by Steven Spielberg and John Williams, Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer, and Luc Besson and Éric Serra, to name a few.\n\nIn this next video, Hans Zimmer and Ridley Scott emphasize the importance of the relationship between directors and composers."
