        "text": "On that concept of in-yun, I was really struck by the passivity of it, how it comes to you rather than you going to it. I was wondering about the in-yun of casting Greta Lee as Nora—how did you know that she was the perfect fit for this role?\n\nAll casting is some form of in-yun; you’re hoping that the next person who walks in is Nora, right? When Greta walked in, you got a sense of it right away. Then, in the conversation and in the work that we were doing together, it was so clear and revealed itself as like, ‘Yeah, this is Nora.’\n\nGreta was raised by Korean immigrants while Teo Yoo is a South Korean born in Germany, and I was wondering if their backgrounds and their experiences with alienation played into your casting decision.\n\nIt made it easier for me to have a conversation with them about the movie. I think that is at the heart of working with an actor, because each relationship that I have with an actor is a very deep, intimate partnership, and for a good partnership there has to be great communication. I knew that I could have a really deep communication with these actors because of the way they felt connected to the story. They really wanted to do the movie because of [this]—we were united in that goal, and for that to happen, I think the experience of alienation is helpful for you to completely connect to the story of the movie.\n\nFrom the opening scene, the film really interrogates the veracity of perception. One facet in particular is the perceptions of white people, and how they can look at and assume things about us Asian people. I love how Nora directly challenges these false notions by looking into the camera. Could you elaborate upon this subversion of the white American gaze?\n\nThe breaking of the fourth wall, which is a theater trick, can always feel a little bit confrontational. It always implicates the audience and lets them into the story in a way that is a little bit more direct. I think that’s why I’ve always loved that in theater. That’s what that moment is: Nora does turn to the audience and implicates them, and also by implicating them, she’s welcoming them into the movie where the central mystery is, ‘Who are these three people to each other?’ It’s like, these are maybe the things that you think right now, but by the end of the movie, you’re gonna have a deeper understanding. You’re going to have followed them through this journey, and you’re going to have discovered life and their lives along with them.\n\nTouching on your background as a playwright, the elliptical editing and flashes of the past play out like a sense memory, like we’re remembering as Nora does. It’s a very cinematic technique that may be difficult to effectively accomplish on stage. I’m curious as to whether this played into your decision to turn this story into a film screenplay rather than a stage play.\n\nI think that the things that are unseen are also a part of theatrical storytelling, because often things are happening offstage or things are happening in a way where it is implied, like when a person dies in a play. You can imply something by somebody walking in after you hear a gunshot and saying that that person is dead, right? The reason why I wanted to turn this into our film and not a stage play is because of the locations, honestly, and also the decades—this story takes place over many decades and two different continents, so you need a sense of time and space, and that actually is a part of the storytelling, that the time and space is different. To really present the difference, I knew that it had to live in film and screen.\n\nWhat skills did you bring from your stage experience as a playwright to this film set, as both director and writer?\n\nWhat I know about building a scene and working with actors and dialogue and blocking and all those things are just a part of the theater tool set. I think that did end up transferring pretty smoothly to filmmaking. And in filmmaking, you have to do similar things—pulling focus and pointing out details and finding the perfect way to handle time and space—but I actually found that I had more technical tools to be able to do that. You had the camera, you had the lighting, you had actual locations that were beautiful, you could do multiple takes, different angles… It was amazing that I was like, ‘Oh, actually, the task at hand is the same. It’s just the medium is different.’\n\nSpeaking of the importance of locations, there’s that scene where Nora and Hae Sung reunite in New York, and bridges are so prominent in the background. It kept making me think about bridges between two worlds, and how Nora is kind of trapped on one, but at least she has a beautiful view. I was wondering if you could speak about this bridge iconography, and how intentional it was.\n\nI think that Nora is very much existing as a bridge between both worlds, and that’s what the movie’s about. She’s at the center of it in that way: she doesn’t have to refer to one thing or the other, and that can be true about all of us. Like, you don’t necessarily have to say that you are only one kind of a thing, because you’re not, you’re a complex person, right? You’re a complex person who has made complex decisions and lived your complex life.\n\nBridges are, in general, transitional spaces. You don’t really live on a bridge; it’s just a place that you’re passing through. Hae Sung is somebody who is passing right through Nora’s life and also, by extension, passing through Arthur’s life too. There is something amazing about his visit, because Hae Sung himself is ordinary, but he’s doing something that’s extraordinary, which is to blow through like the wind and leave a mark on both Arthur and Nora. But the mark is not physical; the mark is deep, in their soul. That’s not something you can see, you know?\n\nYes! And then Nora and Hae Sung both miss the ideas of each other, of their past selves. Nora even admits that the little girl she used to be in South Korea is gone. Do you feel that way about your past self, and what have you retained as you’ve grown into your current self?\n\nWhat’s amazing about being a person—and I think it’s true about not just myself, but for everyone—is that we have in us the contradiction of being the little child that we once were, and also being the adult that you are at this moment at your age. If I think about the way I was when I was a kid, I’m like, I still kind of am that kid, but I also know that I’m now grown up. Now I have to do these other things that are very grown up-y and I can’t actually behave like the way I did when I was a kid.\n\nAs you live through time, you’re always letting go of a little bit that you have. I always talk about how every day I feel like I’m a new person. You think about yourself, like, six months ago, and you’re just like, ‘Oh God, that’s embarrassing.’ [Laughs] Like, ‘Oh, she thought! She thought all these things were gonna be true. So crazy, so cute.’ Then [later] you’re like, ‘Well, now I’m so wise. Now I know everything,’ and then, of course, six months from now we’re gonna be looking at ourselves here and I’ll be like, ‘My God, such a fool. Didn’t know anything.’ That’s really just the nature of human life. I think the experience of living itself is passing through time.\n\nThat’s how I feel when I look at my old Letterboxd reviews from 2015. I’m like, ‘Who was she? What was she talking about?’ Back to the specific locations of the film, what do you miss most about South Korea? And what do you love most about New York?\n\nWhat I miss the most is, honestly, South Korean food. I love the food culture, and I love that you can just walk into any restaurant and eat something pretty great. In Korea, you can spend $5 to get a great broth or something. That’s sometimes hard to do in New York City, because everything is, like, $30, you know what I mean? [Laughs] When I was shooting in Korea, I loved taking my crew to these restaurants and being like, ‘Just sit down. I’m gonna order you everything.’\n\nWhat I love the most about New York is the way that the city loves you, but doesn’t need you. Everybody comes and goes; they don’t need you there. Then when the sun hits the sidewalk in such a perfect way, and the cabs are driving by, and some people are yelling at somebody on the phone, and you’re just walking around and the weather’s perfect, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I love New York and New York loves me!’ But you also know that if you left New York, New York wouldn’t think about you once, and to me, that feels like a really healthy relationship to a city.\n\nI totally agree. I’m LA-based, but I’m in New York for the month right now, and I’m having the exact same experience you’re describing. I’m really gonna miss it here, and on that topic, you capture the ache of goodbyes so well—the silences, the looks and then that lonely walk home. Could you talk about that beautiful, pivotal tracking shot that follows Nora all the way from the apartment to the cab and back again and any challenges you had filming that?\n\nThe whole shot was a challenge because we were trying to shoot it on a Friday night in the East Village. So [the actors] are on the right side and on the left side of the shot there were many, many drunk people who were yelling and asking if we’re shooting Spider-Man. [Laughs] Then of course you have to clear every single one of those buildings, you have to get permission to hang lights in every single one of those buildings and you have to also clear the whole road so that you can lay 150 feet of track, because if a car parks there, the whole plan is done. It really took so much effort from everybody, from my DP and location manager to the PAs and every human being who worked on the movie. It was a challenging thing.\n\nI remember when we were doing tech scouting and we went to that location, I declared to everybody who was gonna work on that set, ‘This street is where the movie lives and dies. This is the hill that I’m going to die on. We are going to do everything we can to make it possible for us to achieve the miracle of being able to shoot this thing the way we want.’ And like a miracle, it was amazing.\n\nAnd, in all of the technical chaos, the actors had to perform an unbelievably pivotal scene. Greta had to cry as Nora over and over and over and over again, because of the way I wanted to shoot it, which was as an all-in-oner. But I think that because I said I was gonna die on this hill, the crew really rallied so that we could make this thing happen, and I think that it really did pay off.\n\nIt absolutely paid off. That was the scene where I was quietly weeping—it was so beautiful. Thank you for dying on that hill. It was so worth it.\n\nMy body is happy on the hill. [Laughs]"
