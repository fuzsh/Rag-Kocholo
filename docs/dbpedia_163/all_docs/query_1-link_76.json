        "text": "Oxford on stage\n\nIf you're into drama then Oxford offers a wealth of different productions, venues and groups to help you develop as an actor, director, designer or technician. There are also many drama and stage-craft related resources for you to use:\n\nUniversity Drama Officer\n\nThe University Drama Officer is a full-time staff member who helps students to plan, programme and publicise student productions, organises free workshops and talks and can advise those planning a career in theatre or film on graduation.\n\nGet in touch at [email protected].\n\nOxford University Dramatic Society\n\nOUDS is one of the many drama societies here that nurtures new talent and encourages involvement. It is the society which helps drama happen at the University of Oxford, and is primarily a funding body providing financial support to student productions. However, it also oversees student drama more generally, ensuring it offers fair opportunities to all.\n\nIt is not a ‘traditional’ drama society in the sense that it is not a group who put on plays, but is made up of a committee which meets every week to discuss funding for shows and to make decisions which improve opportunities for drama across the University.\n\nOUDS nurtures new dramatic talent and works hard to introduce new students to drama in Oxford. The annual Cuppers competition, and the programme of workshops in Michaelmas term, aim to give new students the confidence and experience they need to put on their own shows.\n\nThe extensive and varied range of plays put on each term - for people of all levels of experience and of every interest - ensures that this is a vibrant scene with something for everyone. OUDS also hosts a national tour every summer.\n\nOxBAME Drama\n\nStudent theatre society for the promotion of BAME students in the creative arts at the University of Oxford.\n\nOxford Imps\n\nThe Oxford Imps are a mixture of Oxford students and locals who perform improvised comedy every Monday night in a local pub, and at the Edinburgh Fringe for a month each summer. They are a training as well as performance company, offering a boot camp and workshops for each new generation of comedians and actors.\n\nEvery year they hold auditions (no experience required!) but also need technicians, production assistants, improvising keyboard players and a keen audience to provide suggestions for the show.\n\nThe Imps are a regular fixture at college balls and charity events, and put their skills to use in a wide variety of other formats, from full-length improvised musicals and radio plays to short films.\n\nOxford Revue\n\nIf you are interested in writing and performing sketches and stand-up then the Oxford Revue may be for you.\n\nThis comedy community has spawned some of Britain’s best loved writers and comedians, from Alan Bennett and Rowan Atkinson, to Armando Iannucci and Sally Phillips, to Stewart Lee and Katy Brand.\n\nOxford University Technical Theatre Society\n\nOxford University Technical Theatre Society (OUTTS) is for those who work on the technical side of theatre and theatre design, including stage and production management, lighting, sound, props, and costume and set design.\n\nAs a society, it provides support, advice and training for students who are interested in technical theatre. It also seeks to increase the understanding of technical theatre in the broader University theatre community. Throughout the year it runs workshops on a variety of aspects of technical theatre.\n\nCameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor\n\nEach year a major theatrical figure is appointed to give a series of lectures and workshops at St Catherine’s College. The incoming Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre is Gregory Doran.\n\nPrevious professors include:\n\nAdjoa Andoh\n\nTom Stoppard\n\nSimon Russell Beale\n\nStephen Fry\n\nSir Ian McKellen\n\nArthur Miller\n\nMeera Syal\n\nThelma Holt\n\nDiana Rigg.\n\nOxford University Light Entertainment (OULES)\n\n\">Video of Drama at Oxford - OULES (Oxford University Light Entertainment Society)\n\nRead video transcript.\n\nOxford on screen\n\nYou may have seen Oxford's famous landmarks in innumerable films and TV shows. What you might not have realised, though, is that some of the famous faces you've seen on screen are graduates of the University.\n\nFor instance, Star Wars: Rogue One stars Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed were both students here. Other graduate film stars include Hugh Grant, Emilia Fox, Rosamund Pike, Alfred Enoch and Kate Beckinsale.\n\nIf film-making interests you, then there are many resources and groups to help you develop your skills.\n\nOxford University Filmmaking Foundation\n\nThe Oxford University Filmmaking Foundation exists to support and promote filmmaking at Oxford University, and has a long history of supporting actors, directors, composers and other talented individuals who have then gone on to work at the highest professional levels.\n\nSupport from the Careers Service\n\nThe Oxford University Careers Service has specific support and guidance available to anyone wanting to work in stage, film or television after graduation. Resources include podcasts about breaking into professional acting and tv/ film production."
