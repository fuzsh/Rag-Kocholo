        "text": "Georgia’s Musical Theatre Performance Certificate is an exciting interdisciplinary certificate for students pursuing the bachelor’s degrees in Theatre, Music, or Dance. In addition to taking required courses for their major, students take 10-18 additional credits beyond major requirements. Acceptance into the program is competitive, based on auditions that are held each semester. Students must be accepted into UGA and majoring in theatre, music, or dance, to be eligible to audition.\n\nThis program is a collaboration between the Department of Theatre and Film Studies, Department of Dance, and School of Music. Professor George Contini of the Dept. of Theatre and Film Studies, is serving as program director. The program’s Musical Theatre Faculty include voice instructor, Michael Hadary and opera/musical director Daniel Ellis from Hugh Hodgson School of Music. If you have any questions regarding the Certificate Program please contact gcontini@uga.edu or mhadary@uga.edu.\n\nOverview of Program\n\nThe Musical Theatre Certificate Program will be open only to students pursuing an undergraduate major (AB, BFA, or B.Mus) in Theatre, Music, or Dance, and is designed to supplement and build on the curricula of those majors. Certificate courses in the student’s major department will also count toward the students’ AB, BFA, or B.Mus degree, and consequently the Certificate program will require that a student take between 10 and 17 hours beyond the requirements of their major.\n\nStudents will audition for the program for a panel comprised of at least one representative from each area of Dance, Music, and Theatre. The audition will consist of one short monologue, and two contrasting 32 cuts from songs (each cut should be about a minute) from the Broadway Musical repertoire. They will also prepare a short statement of purpose and submit a headshot and resume.\n\nOnce accepted into the program, students will work with their academic advisor to make certain they are meeting all requirements. Classes require a passing grade of at least a B to successfully complete the program.\n\nThe demand for the program is very high and the number of slots can be limited. To ensure that the program can accommodate the most dedicated and qualified students, students applying for the program must have at least a 3.0 GPA\n\nApplication Forms for Download\n\nApplication & Audition Guidelines\n\nAudition Tips\n\nApplication (Print & Fill Out)\n\nMusical Theatre Certificate Reference Form\n\nAudition & Adjudication Form\n\nInformational Flyer on Program\n\nApplication and Audition Process\n\nApplication & Auditions are to be submitted via the Musical Theatre Certificate Submission Portal.\n\nOnce you have submitted your documents, pick a time slot for your individual audition here: Link to Sign Up for 10-Minute Audition Slot\n\nAll materials are due by midnight on Tuesday, October 10, 2023.\n\nYour Completed Application, Headshot, and Performance Resume (1 file, .pdf)\n\nHeadshot and Performance Resume — While you are not required to have professional headshots, your photo should align to industry standards, be well lit, and sized 8 x 10. Resumes should be formatted as per professional acting resume templates.\n\nRecommendation Form from Professor or Teacher (1 file, .pdf)\n\nCopy of Unofficial Transcript (1 file, .pdf)\n\nStatement of Purpose — In 100 words or less please express your rationale for gaining the certificate and how it aligns with your professional and academic goals.

Bring clothes that you can move in (and dance shoes if you have them) for a group dance call. Loose clothing is not the best; form fitting is better as it allows the auditors to make better assessments. You will be taught a short combination to be presented in various groups/pairings. Following the dance call will be individually scheduled 10-minute slots beginning at 12:00PM.\n\nFor your audition slot, you are asked to prepare one contemporary monologue of no more than 1 minute in length. Also, as previously stated, prepare two 32 bar (each about 1 minute in length) cuts of contrasting songs from the standard Broadway musical repertoire...not to be longer than 3 minutes total. The total running time of your slate, monologue and two songs must not exceed 5 minutes.\n\nPlease have music in the proper key with all cuts clearly marked. No chords, no lead sheets, or accompaniment tracks, SHEET MUSIC only. (Feel free to reach out to Professor Hadary for help in marking your sheet music - mhadary@uga.edu.)\n\nAuditioners will be judged on the following:\n\nActing: Memorization and presentation, ability to live in the given circumstances of the play, pursuing a clear objective in the monologue, focusing on the imaginary other to whom you are speaking.\n\nSinging: Tone, intonation (pitch accuracy), musicality (phrasing, dynamics, style)\n\nDancing: Coordination and rhythm, ability to take direction, focus\n\nProgram of Study\n\n*In addition to requirements for degrees in Theatre, Music, or Dance\n\n* Theatre majors may count THEA courses towards theatre requirements where applicable, and DANC/MUSI courses in area 6 fine arts/humanities.\n\nDepartment of Theatre and Film Studies (10 hours total)\n\nTHEA 3500: Acting 1 (3 hours)\n\nTHEA 5550: Performance Styles: Musical Theatre (3 hours)\n\nTHEA 4500: The Broadway Musical and American Culture (3 hours)\n\nTHEA 5950: Musical Theatre Showcase (1 hour)\n\nHugh Hodgson School of Music (8-9 credit hours total)\n\n1.
