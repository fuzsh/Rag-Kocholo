        "text": "Okay, okay, everyone will have their own ideas of who should be in a Top 10 of film composers – let’s face it, film music (as we know it) has been around for almost 90 years and every filmmaking country on the planet has composers. Even a Top 50 might be tricky to agree on. This list of the best film composers, though, takes in some of the legends, trailblazers and downright popular composers who have played their part in establishing and innovating the art form, or quite simply attracted global attention to it.\n\nSix of the best… film scores\n\nThe 50 Greatest Composers of All Time\n\nWhat is the difference between a film score and film soundtrack?\n\nAll the Oscar winners and nominees for Best Original Score, since 1935\n\nBest film composers of all time\n\n10. Rachel Portman (b1960)\n\nIn 10th place we have film composer Rachel Portman. While she was by no means the first woman to compose film music, Portman did make history in 1997 when she won an Oscar for Emma (1996). Her painterly scores have graced award-winning films in all genres and she remains one of the UK’s most respected and highly sought-after film composers.\n\nRecommended recording: Chocolat (Music from the Miramax Motion Picture)\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n9. Maurice Jarre (1924-2009)\n\nMaurice Jarre is ninth. The first French composer to win an Oscar (for 1962’s Lawrence of Arabia), Maurice Jarre enjoyed a high profile career in his native France, the UK and Hollywood. His keen sense of melody was matched by an experimental streak, which often saw him integrate ethnic instrumentation and electronic sounds into his music.\n\nRecommended recording: Lawrence of Arabia (World Premiere Recording of the Complete Score)\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n8. John Barry (1933-2011)\n\nEighth is the British film composer John Barry. Perhaps Britain’s most famous film music export, John Barry enjoyed a high profile career throughout the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. His music, and songs, for many of the original James Bond films are probably good enough reason alone to include him in this list, though he enjoyed a rich and varied career beyond 007 and won five Oscars to boot.\n\nRecommended recording: John Barry: Dances With Wolves (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n7. Joe Hisaishi (b1950)\n\nIn seventh place is Joe Hisaishi. Dubbed ‘the Japanese John Williams’, Hisaishi is a household name in his home country, but also has legions of fans around the world thanks to his sweeping, characterful scores for the films of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. He has won eight Japanese Academy Awards.\n\nRecommended recording: Joe Hisaishi: Dream Songs – The Essential Joe Hisaishi\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n6. AR Rahman (b1967)\n\nSixth is AR Rahman. The most prolific and successful film composer in Indian cinema, AR Rahman’s scores and original songs have graced countless Tamil and Hindi productions. His music for UK and US productions has only increased his fan-base – the music he wrote for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him two Academy Awards, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe.\n\nRecommended recordings:\n\nAR Rahman: Slumdog Millionaire (Music from the Motion Picture)\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\nThe Best of AR Rahman\n\nStream on Amazon\n\nTop 5 film composers of all time\n\n5. Ennio Morricone (1928-2020)\n\nThe first of our top five is Ennio Morricone. The name is about as iconic as the music, and the late Italian film composer will go down in history thanks to the hugely original music he created for the ‘Spaghetti Westerns’ alone. Beyond the colourful thrills of those scores, Morricone was a true music artist and one of the hardest working composers in film.\n\nRecommended recording: Ennio Morricone: Morricone 60\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n4. Bernard Herrmann (1911-75)\n\nIn fourth place is Bernard Herrmann. Less than ten years after Max Steiner wrote the film music rulebook, Bernard Herrmann tore it up. With a singular voice, the American film composer created scintillating film scores that relied less on melodic sweep and more on rhythm, tone and unusual instrumentation. His scores for Alfred Hitchcock remain some of the most striking ever written.\n\nRecommended recording: Bernard Herrmann: Bernard Herrmann – The Essential Film Music Collection\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n3. Hans Zimmer (b1957)\n\nAnd now we come to our top 3 and if ever there is a single artist who dominates 21st-century film music, it is Hans Zimmer. The German-born composer all but rules the Hollywood film music landscape thanks to his ahead-of the-curve production methods, collaborative spirit and innate sense of musical drama.\n\nHans Zimmer to receive Outstanding Contribution to Music Award at the 2013 Classic Brits\n\nA guide to the music of Disney's The Lion King\n\nRecommended recording: Hans Zimmer: The World of Hans Zimmer – A Symphonic Celebration\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n2. John Williams (b1932)\n\nIn second place is John Williams. The film music of John Williams represents some of the most familiar ever written, having been composed for some of the most popular films of all time. The American composer reignited an interest in symphonic film music (à la Max Steiner) in the late 1970s with his score for Star Wars (1977). He has won five Oscars.\n\nAll nine Star Wars scores ranked...\n\nFour of the best John Williams recordings\n\nJohn Williams announced as 2020 RPS Gold Medal recipient\n\nRecommended recording: John Williams: John Williams in Vienna\n\nStream on Apple\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\nAll nine Star Wars scores ranked...\n\nJohn Williams’s Star Wars theme named nation’s favourite film score\n\nFour of the best John Williams recordings\n\n1. Max Steiner (1888-1971)\n\nAnd... drum roll please... our top film composer of all time is Max Steiner. The Vienna-born composer Max Steiner almost single-handedly created the art of film music with groundbreaking Hollywood scores in the early 1930s. His music for films like King Kong (1933) helped shape industry and audience understanding of what original music could do for a movie in terms of dramatic nuance and great musicianship.\n\nRecommended recording: Max Steiner: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – The Classic 1948 Film Score\n\nStream on Apple Music\n\nBuy from Amazon\n\n6 of the best classical music-themed films on Netflix\n\nSix of the best... festive film scores\n\nSix of the best...
