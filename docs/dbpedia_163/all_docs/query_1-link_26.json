        "text": "Ok I live for Drama/Fantasy/Action/Adventure Stories. And I think that Epic\n\n(Inspirational/Motivational/Battle/Emotional) music can make a huge impact and bring these stories to life!\n\nEpisode only has like maybe 1 or 2 Epic style sounds. And they sound like “music_emotionalstringpop” and “music_melancholy” and maybe “music_dramaticballad” but that’s about it. These are great but its mostly a sad/ melancholy vibe,\n\nI got a lot of feedback about how the music itself along with the story made them cry or feel what the MC feels or literally bring the story to life, make it seem “real”. Specifically “music_emotionalstringpop” played right can make many people cry for some reason lol.\n\nSo how cool would it be for more motivational/ inspirational versions/ vibes?\n\nEpic Motivational Music Playlist (Epic Battle Music may fall here and is awesome too)\n\nEpic Inspirational Music Playlist\n\nEpic Emotional Music Playlist\n\nJust a thought! It can have a great impact on the story, bring it to another level!\n\nBut seriously… more epic style music would make stories more… epic. ALMOST MOVIE-LIKE! Episode is similar to movies in a way so lets add some epic movie style music shall we?\n\nSorry for the overkill just give us geeks some epic music pretty please! lol"
