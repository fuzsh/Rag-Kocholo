        "text": "Mutant, in partnership with Back Lot Music, are proud to present the premiere physical release of Grammy-and Emmy-nominated composer Benjamin Wallfisch's score to the hit film Twisters.\n\nNot to be confused with Twisters: The Album - the various artists, country pop compilation - the original motion picture soundtrack to Twisters exclusively features Benjamin Wallfisch's beautiful, romantic and action packed score.\n\nFrom the opening notes of the first track \"Nature's Masterpiece\" the tone is set for a score that marvels in awe of the beauty of the American landscape, and the powers that mother nature contains.\n\n“It was such a thrill and joy to work with director Lee Isaac Chung on Twisters. Even in the most intense and powerful action pieces he still manages to always make it feel personal and about the characters.\" says composer Wallfisch. \"The sheer power and majesty of the storms is always grounded in us rooting for Kate, Tyler, Javi and all the others, and finding a way to capture that balance and tone was the main starting point for the score. As a huge fan of the 1996 movie, it was an honor to have been invited to be a part of this incredible film.”\n\nThis limited edition vinyl release is pressed on 2x 140 gram Mutant Webstore exclusive color vinyl and is mastered at Bernie Grundman.\n\nSide One\n\nNature’s Masterpiece\n\nTeam Kate\n\nJavi\n\nThis Car’s Gonna Fly\n\nAftermath\n\nSide Two\n\nShe Told Us East\n\nShifting Path\n\nThe Race\n\nComplete the Triangle\n\nRodeo\n\nAfter the Storm\n\nSide Three\n\nTornado Theory\n\nEveryone Into Position\n\nRefinery\n\nKate’s Theme\n\nSide Four"
