        "text": "A very, very, very hot take, yep I know. But I did NOT like the music and it literally made the movie a lot less enjoyable for me. It felt monotone, repetitive, and pushing aside that I wasn't liking the 80s vibe (that's just a generational thing mainly, to be fair), it came close to spoiling the action and story of the movie for me.\n\nWow, reading that back I sound like a nerd lol.\n\nBut what are your thoughts? Does anyone else think this too or am I just an uncultured schmuck?\n\nWhether you are an uncultured schmuck, I cannot say. However, Top Gun is/was a sign of the times, so to speak (maybe you had to be there?)\n\nI have not seen it in [*cough*] years, but I can certainly imagine that it hasn't aged well.\n\nand pushing aside that I wasn't liking the 80s vibe (that's just a generational thing mainly, to be be fair)\n\nTo me, part's of that film, just can't be divorced from the period it was made (mid 80's). And that goes beyond just the musical element's, but also just certain ways Tony Scott filmed/edited some of the sequences.\n\nI saw this video close to a decade ago, and still value it more than the film itself, lol.\n\nWow hot take indeed. I love the soundtrack even though it's something I'd never compose or even think would be fitting in the film. Yet it works very well. This bizarre, Wendy Carlos-ish, take on some kind of Chopin-adjacent piece with purely synths, is amazing in the movie -\n\nThere's a lot of late 80s and early 90s scores that aged extremely poorly because of everything that happened in film music between 2003 and 2010... you know... and this is one score that holds up I think.\n\nAny movie that stars Tom Cruise sucks regardless of the score.\n\nEven Minority Report?? Love that movie. Also Risky Business is one of my favourites. He really acted brilliantly in both those movies. There are others too that are up there like A Few Good Men. Watching him act alongside Jack Nicholson is electric. I think Nicholson is better but not by much.\n\nI think I understand where people are coming from who dislike him. I do find him slightly annoying when does that cheesy grin as if he’s in love with himself. The last few years I’ve found his acting to be much more boring and wooden that the early part of his career. Not sure why - perhaps it’s his obsession with action movies and doing his own stunts and attempts at comedy (not his forte). I feel he’s forgotten how to act, or maybe his film roles are less meaty and gritty.\n\nEven Minority Report?? Love that movie. Also Risky Business is one of my favourites.

Friggin' great movie.\n\nDon't forget War of the Worlds.\n\nI'm hoping that after he does Mission Impossible 12,000 he'll go back to doing the cool movies he was doing last decade.\n\nA very, very, very hot take, yep I know.

Does anyone else think this too or am I just an uncultured schmuck?\n\nyou had to be there to get it...\n\nI wasn't a fan of Tom Cruise early in his career, probably his pretentious side.\n\nBut the movie Vanilla Sky made me change my point of view on this actor, and I started to like his films.\n\nI like Top Gun, even though it was not the movie of the century and it was in its arrogant period, and despite the American propaganda side of the film (we are USA, the sherifs of the world, we are the most beautiful, we are the strongest ...).\n\nThe music is inseparable from the film, but to realize it you have to be someone from the 80's generation, otherwise it will not actually stick with today's codes.\n\nTo each their own, I guess. I'm probably nostalgic, but \"Top Gun\" was amongst the first films I've ever seen as a young child in the late 80's, so it always brings back memories. IMO, only a few soundtracks mix songs and instrumental pieces effectively and memorably. \"Rain Man\" is probably my favorite of these in this particular era, but \"Top Gun\" doesn't fall much behind either. As for the synth pieces by Harold Faltermeyer, I love his sun-drenched sounds, especially in the opening titles of \"Top Gun\", though I'm not too keen on the featured solo guitar sound at the same time.\n\nIt's probably a generation thing as someone noticed earlier. To me, music from the past always has so much more charm than the modern one, including film music. Sure, some might sound flashy and kitschy by today's \"standards\", but I find it much more memorable than most of the modern stuff.\n\nYou probably did have to be there. I was 13 when Top Gun came out... my Dad told the guy at our local Odeon I was 15 so that we could get in and - aside from Star Wars - this is one of the films I hold dear, maybe more than it deserves. But the music is absolutely key to the experience, and to me it fits perfectly, both in terms of the supporting the picture, and from a distinctiveness/memorable/branding standpoint; i.e. getting teenagers to actually remember which movie they went to see on Saturday so they would recommend it to their friends, and/or go and see it again.\n\nI know lots of people here like the epic orchestra stuff that seems to be copy and pasted between every action film released nowadays, but give me a handful of decent songs any day.\n\nHaving said that, if you think Dido would have improved the soundtrack in any way, you guys are crazy... that video that @Jish posted makes it look sooo boring\n\nAnd I like Tom Cruise, so ner."
