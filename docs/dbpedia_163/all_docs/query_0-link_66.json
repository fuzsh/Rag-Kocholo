These artists are: Celeste, Gregory Porter, Olivia Dean, Ray Laurél, Sekou and Self Esteem.\n\nMeanwhile, the original songs for the series have been written by Dan Carey and Kae Tempest, and the show has been co-produced with Mercury Studios (part of the Universal Music Group), which has, according to the BBC, \"helped create the musical backdrop for Knight’s incredible story\".\n\nCarey is a producer who has worked with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Lily Allen, Sia and Franz Ferdinand, while Tempest is a poet, recording artist, novelist and playwright.\n\nThe show has been described as a \"love letter to Birmingham and the Midlands\" by star Shyvonne Ahmmad.\n\nShe added: \"And it's a love letter to that time. So those who grew up during that time, or even children of parents who grew up in that time, it's so exciting to get to step into it.\"\n\nShe went on to say that \"it's all about self-expression, it's all about figuring out who you are. So step into it, I'd say for audience members, and remember who you were trying to be at that time and who you thought you were\".\n\n\"And if you are still figuring out, like all of us, I think it's a lifelong endeavour to try and figure out who you are and what you want and who your tribe is,\" Ahmmad continued. \"Step into it and just enjoy it.\"\n\nHer co-star Ben Rose also explained to RadioTimes.com how the show is both similar and different to Peaky Blinders, saying: \"It’s just the writing. Steven Knight, the writer, he has a really incredible sort of voice, I think, and he's able to create really grounded, naturalistic characters who all speak in poetry, and all have a heightened sense of reality within this really gritty, very earthly world.\n\n\"His language is sort of otherworldly. And the way Peaky uses contemporary popular music to contrast with the era, our show kind of has the opposite, because it's using music of the time, of the era, to make you feel even more immersed in that world.\"\n\nThis Town is available to stream on BBC iPlayer from 6am on Sunday 31st March, while the first episode airs on BBC One at 9pm.\n\nCheck out more of our Drama coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on."
