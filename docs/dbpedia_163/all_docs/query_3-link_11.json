        "text": "Film soundtracks are undoubtedly one of the foundations of any production. With the right mix and tone, they can develop two characters just having a conversation into a hugely emotional scene.\n\nYou’ve probably seen the Dune: Part Two memes on social media, featuring the iconic Hans Zimmer soundtrack for when Paul Atreides rides a sandworm. That’s the power of film soundtracks – they can bring a scene to life (and capture the imaginations of content creators on TikTok, too).\n\nWe’re peering behind the curtain to take a look at what goes into making a film soundtrack great – from the psychology behind a heart-wrenching composition to the business turning the wheels behind it all. Keep reading.\n\nThe Evolution of Film Soundtracks\n\nRewinding the clock to the silent film era in the early 1900s, a pianist or small ensemble would play live in theatres to bring the picture to life for audiences. Synchronised sound then changed the game in 1927, bringing music and voice to the screens for the first time.\n\nIt’s nearly been a century since that breakthrough, and times have changed rapidly for film soundtracks. They went from a pleasant addition to a film-defining moment: think of the iconic two-note Jaws soundtrack that still fills everyone with dread, or the suspenseful strings in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. The film soundtrack had become a powerful narrative device in its own right.\n\nFast forward, and using popular music in film soundtracks marked another evolution. Instead of orchestral scores, films like Saturday Night Fever and The Graduate tapped into the beat of the times, using songs the audience knew and loved, blending cinema with pop culture.\n\nToday, film soundtracks are diverse. They can range from the epic cinema experiences of composers Hans Zimmer and John Williams to the saccharine, sweet pop culture references like in the Barbie film. They’ve grown from simple accompaniments to pivotal elements that filmmakers and composers work on together.\n\nCreating a Soundtrack for the Screens\n\nThe magic begins early in with a collaboration between the director and the composer. They’ll sit down to discuss the emotions they want to draw out in the audience, the narrative’s pace and how music can amplify the story being told.\n\nComposers then retreat to their tools: instruments and scores. They’ll consider plot narratives like the hero’s journey, the low point for the main character and the ending. These themes inform the compositions.\n\nRecording the soundtrack involves orchestras, bands, or even electronic synthesis, depending on the film’s needs. A pop culture-focused production might involve music artists recording songs, especially for the film’s release.\n\nOnce the music is composed, recorded and edited to align with the visuals, the soundtrack becomes an inseparable part of the film’s narrative. It’s a labour of love that gives us, as the audience, music that captivates and stays with us long after the credits roll.\n\nEmotional and Psychological Impact\n\nHave you ever felt chills run down your spine as a movie reached its climax or found yourself humming a tune from a film days after watching it? That’s the emotional and psychological power of a film soundtrack at work. Music has a knack for getting past our rational brain and tapping directly into our emotional cores, making it a powerful storytelling tool.\n\nThis is because music speaks a universal language of emotions. It can convey hope, despair, love and fear, often without a single word being said. It sets the mood and atmosphere for a film, like the eerie and suspenseful music for a thriller’s big reveal or the light, bubbly tunes for a rom-com. The music cues help prepare the audience’s emotions.\n\nThe psychological impact of film music extends to how we remember a film. Part of the reason franchises like Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are still popular today is their exemplary soundtracks that have introduced new audiences to the films.\n\nSoundtracks in the Digital Age\n\nThe way we experience film soundtracks has drastically changed in the last decade. With Spotify and Apple Music at our fingertips, it’s easier than ever to find that brilliant soundtrack from your favourite childhood movie or TV show and listen on repeat. This ease of access has increased the popularity of film music and allowed soundtracks to chart alongside mainstream hits, reaching audiences far beyond moviegoers.\n\nSocial media is another tool. With its power to make content viral, a film soundtrack can become a sensation in the latest TikTok trend and catapult decades-old songs and soundtracks back into relevance.\n\nThis digital landscape has also opened up new avenues for creativity. Composers and film production services now experiment with sound in previously unimaginable ways, using AI and other new tech to create a broader palette of sounds and symphonies.\n\nThe Business of Film Soundtracks\n\nMaking film soundtracks is big business, and now they have increased prominence in the digital streaming era. It makes sense for film companies to invest in a good composer, as a compelling soundtrack can drive album sales, streaming numbers and even concert tours.\n\nA hit song from a movie can top charts worldwide and go viral on social media, boosting a film’s visibility. Soundtracks also open revenue streams for composers and audio companies through licensing and royalties. Every time a song is played on the radio, performed live, or used in another media, it generates income for the rights holders. This aspect of the business is particularly lucrative for evergreen films whose music continues to resonate with audiences long after their release.\n\nMarketing is another factor for film soundtracks. A well-selected or specially commissioned song can become the centrepiece of a film’s promotional efforts, creating a buzz before the film hits the cinemas. Through album sales, licensing deals, marketing campaigns and potential global reach, soundtracks have a pivotal role in the film business.\n\nThat’s a Wrap"
