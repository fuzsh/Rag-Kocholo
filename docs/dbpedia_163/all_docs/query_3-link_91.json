        "text": "We have the name of the movie and we know it takes place in 1977 and it is likely set in Los Angeles or related to the film industry, which is a rough equivalent substantially speaking. The name of the film by the way is The Movie Critic. For a guy who was formally sensitive about his works in progress, Quentin seems a bit loose lipped about what he has deemed his final film.\n\nI, for one, will take him at his word on that. It is possible Quentin has run out of ideas. He has actually repeated themes in his films and that is just at the conceptual level: revisionist history, Spaghetti Westerns and Grind House martial arts and horror genre homages. His dialogue, casting and framing also contain repeated idiosyncrasies.\n\nNone of this is to say that his films aren’t interesting and fun and better then 99% of what Hollywood releases in any given year. I actually hope that he just takes a long break. For example, even though I vehemently disagree with the revisionist ending of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, there was a small part of me that was cheered by the notion that the lovely and completely charming Sharon Tate, as played by Margo Robbie, survived her real fate.\n\nBut, when you pull back, that essentially means Quentin is tacking a happy ending onto a gruesome actual event but leaving in the slaughter. He just turns the tables on it. Which of course is great for the movie’s Sharon but not so great for the actual Sharon whom all the viewers must know the truth of. Meaning what exactly?\n\nBut I digress, my point here is his non original soundtrack music. At a certain level it is — no surprise — predictable. To clarify what I mean, predictable in his selection logic but not the selections themselves which are all unique and possibly the best part of every one of his movies.\n\nAs best as I can tell, he avoids most of the bigger hits of the 1960’s and 1970’s and with a few exceptions, has not used a song past 1979. Urge Overkill’s cover of Girl You Will Be A Woman Soon is one of the very few memorable exceptions and, yes, I am not counting the closing song of Django Unchained.\n\nWhen the performer is a bit more higher profile — like Kool and the Gang — he tends to choose a deeper cut, Jungle Boogie over Celebration for example, not always but enough. A few more examples here would be Bill Withers and Johnny Cash on the Jackie Brown soundtrack.\n\nQuentin also favors Soul over Rock and Soft Rock over Hard Rock. And in his musical world, The British Invasion never happened. But the best part of his soundtrack curation logic, is his ability to find obscure and forgotten gems by one hit wonders. So what follows is my selections for his final film soundtrack. I will personally just accept screen credit for my efforts but a payment toward my son’s college tuition would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLatina — Sentinels: I know, I know, outside of Pulp Fiction, Quentin never used another Surf Rock song but that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t revisit the sub genre. As befits, his atmospherics there is a hint of noir here and maybe the film’s heroine will be a Latina. And if all else don’t persuade you just listen and appreciate that this one is pretty kick ass.\n\nTry Loving Me — The Webs: Tarantino loves a good Soul ballad and the more obscure the better…so what more is there to say here. Well there is one more thing to say, this is a great fucking song.\n\nMorning Will Come — Spirit: Quentin clearly loves all things Los Angeles and California, including it’s late 1960’s Pop and Rock. This is about as California as you can get in a Rock group. The band’s ill fated guitarist actually went by the stage name Randy California. On a side note, it should be forever noted that Randy died saving his son from drowning. He also claimed to have originally come up with the acoustic melody for Stairway To Heaven but his heirs lost that suit a few years ago.\n\nEverything I Own — Bread: My sense is that The Movie Critic will have a romantic angle, something Quentin has never fully explored. To be sure his films have a number of interesting romantic couplings throughout his work: think Honey Bunny and Fabienne in Pulp Fiction, Jackie and Max in Jackie Brown and even Shosanna and Marcel in Inglorious Bastards. But he has never centered a plot on a romance, so perhaps this is it. And here — for just the right scene — is a romantic Soft Rock masterpiece from a somewhat forgotten and great California band.\n\nThe Whatcha Call Them — Huey “Piano” Smith: Obscure Funk via a great New Orleans artist who first charted in the 1950’s. This is the kind of mix Quentin should love: mature sensibility mashed up with a then youthful energy and spiked with some sly good humor. I will also assume Huey’s heirs could use one last and well deserved payday for a career that should have been more high profile. RIP Huey.\n\nKeep On Smilin — Wet Willie: I am not sure if Quentin likes weed but I sense he at least likes weed songs and this mid 1970’s number should work perfectly for any getting high sequences he might be considering.\n\nThe Jam — Graham Central Station: The setting specifically mentioned for the proposed script is 1977 but it is likely that the film will build to 1977. Meaning the era encompasses the rise of Disco as a rival to Rock and Soul. Quentin, however, has never shown much interest or love for Disco (assuming Strawberry Letter 23 ain’t Disco) but this one may help bridge the eras transition from Soul/Funk to Disco.\n\nHair Of The Dog — Nazareth: What movie doesn’t need a kick ass Hard Rock stomper from the 1970’s? Here is one that ain’t overplayed.\n\nGreen Tambourine — Lemon Pipers: As already mentioned, Quentin directly avoids the British Invasion but he favors many adjacent aspects of it. This is especially true in Death Proof and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. In both, he includes Garage and Psychedelic Garage numbers recorded in the wake of the Beatlemania. The Pipers weren’t exactly Garage and not exactly Psychedelic but close to both and I bet they were all over LA Pop radio when it topped the charts.\n\nSally Go Round The Roses — The Jaynetts: A forgotten one hit wonder Soul classic that went to Number 2 in 1963 and check out those keys. The organ and electric piano are as tasty as Ray Charles on What’d I Say.\n\nI Just Want To be Your Everything — Andy Gibb: Disco Pop from 1977. More importantly this one is BeeGees adjacent without having to be so obvious as directly selecting a well worn track from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. In other words, this just fits the bill for the films proposed era. Also, RIP to Andy, Maurice and Robin."
