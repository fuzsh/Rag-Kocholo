        "text": "What does a music editor do?\n\nMusic editors are responsible for all the music in a film or TV production, including the soundtrack and any music created by the composer. The extent of their role varies considerably depending on the type of production concerned.\n\nOn a medium-budget film, they usually start work while the film is being edited. They work with the director to decide on the purpose of the music, find a style to suit the story and mark the points in the film where music is required (spotting). Then they develop the temp (temporary) score.\n\nMusic editors then work closely with a composer, who is usually appointed by the director, and who composes the music using the temp score as a template. The temp score is also used by the film editors to achieve the right tempo with the cut. Music editors often act as a bridge between the sound and picture teams.\n\nThey attend all recording sessions, helping with any revisions and design a 'click track' which is used to help the musicians achieve synchronisation with the movie. Working with a specialist music mixer, they create different mixes, lay down the tracks and fit them exactly to the picture, ready for the final mix or dub.\n\nOne of the final tasks for music editors on films is preparing the cue sheet - a detailed breakdown of all the music featured on soundtracks. This is sent to the Performing Rights Society and all exhibitors so that royalties can be paid every time the film is screened.\n\nWatch\n\nDay at work: film composer\n\nWhat does a music editor do?\n\nInside Game of Thrones: a story in score (HBO)\n\nGabriel Yared on composing for film\n\nWhat’s a music editor good at?\n\nMusic: know the history and construction of music, compose in different styles and genres, improvise, read scores, create themes quickly under the pressure of deadlines\n\nUnderstanding film production: appreciate the process and techniques of making films, know how music affects images and adds drama, have a passion for the industry\n\nCollaboration: listen to the director, translate the vision into music, be flexible, communicate the vision with the editor, composer and other musicians\n\nUsing software: produce electronic scores using technology such as ProTools, use editing and mixing software\n\nBusiness: know people in the music, film and TV industries, build up contacts, understand contracts and copyright clearances, organise, communicate and negotiate\n\nWho does a music editor work with?\n\nWithin the post-production house, music editors work closely with the supervising sound editor. They also work with the following:\n\nMusic supervisor\n\nMusic supervisors negotiate deals and contracts, prepare budgets, and attend scheduling meetings. They oversee the composing process, ensuring that the required music is being written, listened to, and reported upon. They organise music orchestration and copying. If the music is to be published, they ensure that it’s registered properly.\n\nComposer\n\nComposers write original music. They write themes to pictures and deal with any revisions, collaborating with the editor. Composers prepare the score, usually on midi files, for the orchestrator and copyist. They also prepare the score's electronic aspects for the recording sessions and deliver the score to the producer, together with all recordable media."
