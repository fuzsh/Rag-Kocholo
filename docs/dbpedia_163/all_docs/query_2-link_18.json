        "text": "What makes the Star Wars soundtrack so good? An analysis of John Williams’ music.\n\nWe take a galactic deep-drive into the supersonic music that soundtracks the Star Wars film franchise, unearthing the out-of-this world magic of John Williams’ score.\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…\n\nSome of the most beloved film music of all time was composed for Star Wars by the legendary John Williams.\n\nThe franchise’s original director, George Lucas, wanted a ‘classical’ (small ‘c’) score for the movies, and the depth, variety, tension, and orchestration of Williams’ Star Wars music makes it downright masterful, unforgettable and instantly iconic.\n\nIndeed, it’s hard to imagine the Star Wars universe coming to life quite as powerfully without Williams’ soundtrack. His use of Wagner-inspired orchestration, leitmotifs, and simply incredible melodies has made Star Wars as recognisable by ear as it is by name or visually.\n\nBut what makes the music so great? Let the force be with us, as we delve into the various elements that go into creating one of the most iconic film soundtracks ever made.\n\nRead more: You can now stream the Star Wars soundtrack with an actual lightsaber as the play bar\n\nThe rhythm and pacing\n\nStar Wars is often described as being a ‘space opera’, and Williams’ music has just the right amount of drama required to bring it to life on the big screen, unquestionably operatic in scale, style and longevity as it is.\n\nKey to the drama is the tension and release produced by the music’s rhythm, pacing and placement alongside the onscreen action.\n\nLots of the famous orchestral moments – think of the main theme or the ‘Imperial March’, above – feature impactful triplet rhythms contrasted with bold held notes, as well as detailed string and woodwind flourishes. There’s also syncopation (long-short, long-short patterns) in the melodies, which makes make them rhythmic and memorable.\n\nWilliams doesn’t waste a single moment of music, and no detail is too small for the soundtrack.\n\nSo detail-oriented was Williams that he wrote the Star Wars main theme, used in the opening credits, in the same key and style as production company 20th Century Fox’s ident that kicks off the film – a theme that Williams later described as ‘probably a little overwritten’ in a New Yorker interview. Nah, we think it’s just right.\n\nRead more: John Williams confesses his Star Wars opening credits music was ‘probably a little overwritten’\n\nBrilliant melodies\n\nAs well as rhythms being matched pitch-perfectly to the action on screen, characters and environments are given their own unique melody in Star Wars. This is a device German opera composer Richard Wagner used in his works – called a leitmotif.\n\nTunes like ‘Princess Leia’s Theme’ and ‘Yoda’s Theme’ are stunning, and they recur throughout Star Wars as the characters appear and reappear.\n\nAnd the melodies perfectly communicate the action of scenes, and overall message of Star Wars. The main theme, for example, features a melody that keeps ascending in an uplifting and hopeful way – communicating the ultimate message of hope that weaves through the franchise.\n\nRead more: John Williams conducts the Vienna Philharmonic in sensational ‘Imperial March’\n\nVariety\n\nWhile we’re on melody, it’s worth drawing attention to the sheer variety there is in the memorable musical themes for the characters.\n\nWhile Darth Vader’s ‘leitmotif’ is the brooding and, let’s face it, pretty terrifying ‘Imperial March’, which is rhythmically and stylistically reminiscent of the main theme, ‘Princess Leia’s Theme’ is a heart-wrenchingly beautiful melody played in the brasswinds, characterised by a hope and clarity, and a very gentle accompaniment from the strings.\n\n‘Yoda’s Theme’ is contrasted again. Noble, reflective and stately, it’s gorgeous stuff.\n\nRead more: Star Wars’ Darth Vader gatecrashes a classical concert, stays for ‘Imperial March’\n\nThe orchestration\n\nWhen director George Lucas originally called for a ‘classical’ approach to the music for his epic space saga, John Williams took him at his word and produced a soundtrack that makes any symphony orchestra do what symphony orchestras do best: rich sounds, bold colours, contrasted textures and no end of drama.\n\nWilliams uses the forces of the orchestra to full effect. Since he was first asked to compose for Star Wars in the 1970s, he’s called on the same techniques and devices as established film composers like Erich Korngold, Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann who also used full symphony orchestra.\n\nThey in turn were influenced by Romantic opera and orchestral composers, especially the aforementioned Richard Wagner who, with his epic works, revolutionised opera.\n\nRead more: A Star Wars piano medley meets 360-degree virtual reality, and the force is strong\n\nWilliams’ Star Wars score was also influenced by English composer Gustav Holst – especially his work The Planets, fittingly (compare ‘Mars’ with the Star Wars main theme) – and other Romantic and early 20th century composers, like Stravinsky.\n\nWilliams also uses choral forces.\n\n‘Duel of the Fates’, heard in Phantom Menace, for example has a fully choral opening before the clarinets introduce an uneasy melody It’s reminiscent of Carl Orff’s dramatic 1937 choral cantata, Carmina Burana.\n\nAfter producing eight film scores in the Star Wars franchise, Williams’ use of full symphony orchestra never lost its potency. And the force has remained strong with the composers who’ve since composed for Star Wars, continuing Williams’ legacy of truly great orchestral film score writing.\n\nRecent Star Wars movie director J.J. Abrams once said, Williams “writes feelings… and knows how to make your heart soar like no one else.”\n\nWe couldn’t agree more."
