        "text": "Lees het artikel in het Nederlands.LEIT REVIEW\n\nThe Mission: Impossible franchise has been going on for decades. With that, I do not only mean the television series from the ‘60s but also the Mission Impossible movies with Tom Cruise that started in 1996. The latest film is Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, with music from Lorne Balfe, who returned after writing the score for this movie’s predecessor, Mission Impossible: Fallout. As can be read in my review, I was not fond of that particular score. In recent years, Balfe was able to surprise me with many exciting scores for other movies. I was hoping that the trend would continue with Dead Reckoning Part One, and to get ahead of myself: He absolutely did.\n\nIn my review of Fallout, I mentioned that I did like one particular track, namely “Stairs and Rooftops,” which I found to be a perfect fit for that movie. That track uses bongos and the orchestra in harmony to create a fun track that worked for the scene and was fun to listen to without the context of the film. The reason for talking so much about a track from a different movie in this review is that the entire score of Dead Reckoning Part One gives me the same vibes. If you are thinking about Mission Impossible, its main theme probably comes to mind, and Balfe transformed a part of it into Ethan Hunt’s theme, which he also used in Fallout. Its melody is again the foundation for the music for Dead Reckoning Part One, together with original themes from Lalo Schifrin from the sixties. Balfe also wrote new thematic material, representing the antagonists Gabriel and The Entity, for example, cleverly integrated into the music and appearing at the right moments in the film.\n\nWhat stands out is how the soundtrack for Dead Reckoning Part One stays engaging. The movie has many sequences that are pretty long, with many things happening on screen and without any dialogue. In those sequences, the music is allowed to shine. Not only does Balfe use different orchestral elements to keep the music going without getting boring, but he also is able to blend his iconic bongos in exceptionally well. In addition, for this score, he also used military drums, to add even more freshness to the soundtrack. I was engaged the whole time while watching the movie, and the music reality contributed to that. I am quite excited for Part Two. Let us see what the music will bring.\n\nListen or buy\n\nBuy this soundtrack from Amazon.com or Apple Music\n\nListen to this soundtrack on Spotify\n\nTracklist\n\nThe highlights are in bold.\n\nThe Sevastopol (2:07)\n\nThe Phantom (3:05)\n\nCollision Alarm (1:31)\n\nA Ghost in the Machine (2:38)\n\nThe Sum of Our Choices (1:24)\n\nDead Reckoning Opening Titles (1:12)\n\nThe Entity (3:22)\n\nYour Mission… (2:34)\n\nThis Is Not a Drill (2:13)\n\nThe Plot Thickens (8:21)\n\nYou Are Dunn (5:54)\n\nGet Out Now (1:56)\n\nA Colourful Past (3:11)\n\nRush Hour in Rome (3:33)\n\nRoman Getaway (2:46)\n\nYou’re Driving (2:04)\n\nHit It (2:10)\n\nHe Calls Himself Gabriel (6:22)\n\nA Most Probable Next (5:20)\n\nRun As Far As You Can (1:59)\n\nYou Are Done (3:28)\n\nChasing Grace (2:51)\n\nI Was Hoping It’d Be You (1:41)\n\nPonte Dei Conzafelzi (2:19)\n\nTo Be a Ghost (2:21)\n\nWhat Is Your Objective (4:27)\n\nMurder and The Orient Express (3:34)\n\nMask of Lies (2:37)\n\nI Missed the Train (3:05)\n\nKey Details (3:36)\n\nThe Moment of Truth (2:17)\n\nShould You Choose to Accept (1:59)\n\nLeap of Faith (1:36)\n\nConsequences (1:41)\n\nYou Stop the Train (3:48)\n\nChaos on the Line (2:48)\n\nCountdown (2:54)\n\nThis Was the Plan (6:15)\n\nCurtain Call (1:01)"
