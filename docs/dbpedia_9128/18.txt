Zhytomyr, city, western Ukraine. It lies along the Teteriv River where it runs between high rocky banks. Zhytomyr is believed to date from the 9th century, but the first record is from 1240, when it was sacked by the Tatars.

Long a major trade focus and a seat of provincial government, modern Zhytomyr became an important junction where the main rail and road routes westward from Kyiv are crossed by north-south routes. Its industries have included the processing of wood for furniture and flax for linen as well as the production of synthetic fibers. Musical instruments, notably accordions, are a specialty. Zhytomyr has agricultural and teacher-training institutes. Pop. (2001) 284,236; (2005 est.) 277,875.
