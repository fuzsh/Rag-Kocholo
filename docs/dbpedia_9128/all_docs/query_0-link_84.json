        "text": "\"Do not brag about your father, brag about your son who has done well.\"\n\nFolk proverb.\n\nEtymology\n\nOrigin of the surname\n\nAccording to the professor of the Institute of the Polish Language Alexandra Cheslikova (Aleksandra CieÅlikowa), the surname Gulevich is one of the surnames most characteristic of the Russian-Polish border since the 15th century. and probably refers to the most ancient Western Russian surnames.\n\nThe Belarusian philologist Ivan Stankevich (Yanka Stankevich) emphasized that surnames ending in -ich or -vich are an original Slavic tradition.\n\nSuch endings meant origin either by blood or by place of birth. Among the Slavic tribes, surnames were formed either in the form of simple personal nicknames that passed hereditarily from one generation to another without any change, or with the addition of the ending -ich (-vich), used in the sense of a full Russian patronymic.\n\nSimilar examples can be found on the pages of ancient Russian chronicles, which mention the voivode Pretich (968), Luta - the son of Sveneld as \"Svenaldich\" (975), Jan Usmovich and Alexander Popovich (1001), etc.\n\nAs Stankevich noted, surnames (otherwise nicknames) in -ich began to appear even at that time in the life of the Slavic people, when tribal relations still took place. For example, those that were from the Smala clan began to be called Smolichs, from the Baba clan - Babichi, etc.\n\nThe same endings are also known in the names of the tribes that eventually formed the basis of the Belarusian people (Krivichi, Dregovichi, Radimichi)\n\nSurnames on -ich and localities (oikonyms) on -ichi on the Belarusian territory are generally found in a multitude, starting from the Disna povet (district) of the Vilna region (the northwestern part of the modern Vitebsk region). There are even more of them in the west, south and center of the Vitebsk region, and it is likely that there are quite a lot of these surnames in the east of the Vitebsk lands, quite often they are found throughout the Mogilev region, and little by little throughout the rest of Belarus.\n\nOf all the Slavs, except for Belarusians, surnames with -ich are also especially characteristic of Serbs (Pashic, Vuyachich, Stoyanovich).\n\nIn Silesia, Moravia, Saxony, where the now Germanized Slavs once lived, there are still many towns, castles, villages ending in -ich or in German sounding -itz (by the way, surnames too).\n\nIn fairness, it should be noted that similar oikonyms were preserved in the eastern direction, and had the meaning of generic nicknames, which later on the territory of Russia were everywhere replaced by the ending -vo (example: Dyatkovichi-Dyatkovo in the former Oryol province).\n\nSuch a trend in the Muscovite state was clearly manifested in the evolution of nicknames in -vich, which gradually personified in patronymics, although the latter turned out to be the lot of far from every boyar or representative of the privileged nobility.\n\nIn the \"pre-Moscow period\" in Russia, the conversion of one's own name or nickname was carried out by adding the ending -ich (-vich) to the first. In Muscovite Rus', this order was destroyed, including because of the humiliation of one person over another, who was considered superior (the consequences of parochialism).\n\nFamily nicknames in ancient Rus' in the form of a full patronymic in -vich were an expression of respect and honor. In Muscovy, \"vich\" was truncated to give the nickname a diminutive-pejorative form. Moreover, the grand dukes continued to \"vicitate\" themselves as before, as well as their relatives and those persons who enjoyed their special grace. Slaves \"vicili\" gentlemen, ordinary people - noble persons.\n\nIn Moscow replies, “vich” was added as a sign of honor to non-Moscow surnames. The Radziwills were called the Radzivillovichs, similarly to Sapieha, Dovgerdov. However, with those with whom they kept without fear, they did not stand on ceremony. Examples of this are remarks to Hetman Khmelnytsky, who used his patronymic with \"vich\". Hetman Samoilovich was cut down to Samoilov, the same was done with the Mokrievichs, Domontovichs, Yakubovichs, Mikhneviches, and the Mokrievs, Domontovs, Yakubovs, Mikhnevs were obtained.\n\nSurnames on -vich existed for a long time in Novgorod, Pskov (where, by the way, there were the following boyar surnames - Stroilovichi, Kazachkovichi, Doynikovichi, Raigulovichi, Ledovichi, Lyushkovichi), which turned into truncated ones under Moscow influence.\n\nThe ending -vich turned at the end of the 16th century. as a special extraordinary award, the sovereign himself indicated who should be written with \"vich\". In the reign of Catherine II, a list of very few persons was compiled, which in government papers should be written with “-vich”.\n\nWhen the question arose of how to deal with patronymics in this case, the empress’s order followed: the persons of the first 5 classes should be written with their full patronymics, those from the 6th to the 8th inclusive - with semi-patronymics (without “ich”), and all the rest - no patronymic, first name only.\n\nHowever, the \"Smolensk\" Gulevichs, as well as some others who, over time, found themselves in Russian citizenship, managed to keep their family name unchanged.\n\nThere are several versions explaining the origin of the surname Gulevich, or rather its root.\n\nPolish professor Kazimierz Rymut in his work “Polish surnames (“Nazwiska Polakow”) writes that names starting with\n\n“Hum-”, apparently, comes from the verb “walk” in the sense of “to revel” or “to rebel” ... As another option, the professor suggested the origin from the noun “ hum” - identifying it as “blow” or even “bulge”.\n\nIt is known that in the Ukrainian language “gulya” is a “bump”, meaning a rounded bulge, a tubercle, for example, on the forehead. The Explanatory and Derivational Dictionary of the Russian Language (T.F. Efremova. 2000) also indicates the same meaning (gulya - a colloquial version of “bump”, “swelling”, “swelling under the eyes”)\n\nThe suffix -vich means \"son\", so the surname Gulevich, according to Professor Rimunt, would mean \"son of Gula or Gul\", i.e. literally, as an option - the son of a reveler, a rebel.\n\nThe Belarusian writer and literary critic Vladimir Yurevich (Uladzimir Yurevich), in his work devoted to Belarusian surnames, directly wrote that such surnames as: Gul, Gulko, Gulich, Gulevich, Gulenka, Gulkevich, Gulitsky, Guleba, Gulyaka, Gulyakevich come from the word \"walk\", contrasting it with the verb \"work\".\n\nHowever, the compilers of the Dictionary of Russian Personal Names offer a different version: “The surnames Gulevich, as well as the same-root Gulyaev, Gulyai, Gulak, Gulevsky, Guleichik, Gulenko, Gulia, Gulichev, Gulyga, Gulkevich, Gulko, Gulchinsky and others could come from various forms of the name Sergei . This is a Roman generic name, possibly meaning \"high\", \"highly venerated\". Among the diminutive forms from him there are also the following: Gulenka, Gulechka, Gulya, Gulyushka, Gulya, Gunechka, Gunechka, Gunka, Gunyushka, Gunya, Goose, Gusechka, Guska, Goose, Gusha, Gushka .... ”(source - A. N. Tikhonov, L. Z. Boyarinova, A. G. Ryzhkova \"Dictionary of Russian Personal Names\". M., 1995.). A different etymology for surnames with this root is offered by another dictionary, indicating that the stem Gul- is a diminutive of the name Yegor, George, or even goes back to a proper name - Gulyai, which is quite common in Rus'. (source - Russian surnames: a popular etymological dictionary / Yu. A. Fedosyuk. - 6th ed., Rev. - M .: Flinta: Nauka, 2006.\n\nWithout stopping definitely on any of the interpretations of the proper personal name, which has become a patronymic for an extensive family, the following should be noted; among representatives of the Gulevich clan and adjacent clans in the 15th century. there are such forms of proper names as: Mikhno (Mikhail), Vasko (Ivan), Senko (Semyon), Galshka (Elizaveta), Gulko ....\n\nStory\n\nPart 1. Volyn\n\nVolyn is the oldest among the Christian lands of Ancient Rus'; following Kiev, one of the first, she would have the right to celebrate the millennium of her baptism. But, perhaps, the earliest preachers of the Word of God appeared here even earlier: according to legend, the western part of present-day Volhynia already at the end of the 9th century was part of the diocese of Equal-to-the-Apostles Methodius (+ 885), which stretched from Moravia to the Volyn rivers Bug and Styr. And who knows, if the first monks had already come here, who fell in love with the mountain, which later received the name Pochaevskaya, covered with dense forest and having many caves.\n\nHistory has not preserved for us any information about their lives. However, more than a century later, Grand Duke Vladimir Svyatoslavovich brought the Greek and Bulgarian clergy to Volyn and was accepted here for the baptism of the villages and cities subject to him. In these parts, he also founds a new city - Vladimir-Volynsky, where he builds a church consecrated in the name of Basil the Great, the saint, whose name he himself was named at his baptism. In 992, he established an episcopal see here and built a cathedral church in the name of the Assumption of the Most Holy Theotokos, and Vladimir-Volynsky became the center of the church and political life of the Western Russian outskirts.\n\nThis is how Volhynia enters the circle of Christian lands.\n\nThe original population of Volyn is the Slavic union of Volyns (they are also Dulebs or Buzhans), represented, by the way, both in the center of Europe and in the Baltic (the island and the city of Volin at the mouth of the Oder). During the great migration of peoples, the duleb tribal union broke up into \"Czech\" dulebs and dulebs in the basin of the Pripyat and Bug rivers, which at the end of the 8th or at the beginning of the 9th century. moved beyond Pripyat to the lands of another Slavic tribe - the Dregovichi.\n\nMedieval written sources record dulebs in Volyn, in the Czech Republic, on the Middle Danube, between Lake. Balaton and r. Mursa, etc. They had 230 \"cities\" (castles). According to the Primary Chronicle, in con. 6 - beg. 7th century Dulebs suffered heavily from the invasion of the Avars (obrovs), with whom they waged a fierce struggle. In 907, their squad participated in the campaign of the Kyiv Prince. Oleg the Prophet to Constantinople. Dulebs and their \"king\" are mentioned by the Arab geographer al-Masudi. In the 10th century The association of the Dulebs, apparently, broke up, and they became part of Kievan Rus under the name of the Volynians (\"Dulebs live along the Bug, where the Volynians are now\") and Buzhans (\"zane sedosha along the Bug\"). Slavic toponyms and hydronyms presented in Volyn can serve as a kind of standard for Slavic topography.\n\nThe Volyn landscape is a fertile plain stretching from east to west with a wide belt cut through by many rivers (the southern tributaries of the Pripyat). To the north of the Volyn opolye, the vast forests of the Pripyat Polissya rustle. To the south, Volhynia cuts through a stone ridge from west to east, pointing the Carpathian massif to the east, to the center of Eastern Europe. The Slavic population in Volyn since ancient times lived along the banks of the upper reaches of the rivers Sluch, Goryn, Styr. Settlements and settlements of the Volhynians in the 5th-13th centuries. stood on the banks of the rivers, as on the side of a high road. There were also land routes in Volhynia, going from the middle Dnieper (from Kiev) to Przemysl and Berest with Drogochin and further to Krakow, to the Danube, to South Germany.\n\nThe natural boundary of Volhynia in the west is the valley of the upper reaches of the Western Bug. In the east, from the lands of the chronicle meadows and the later Kyiv principality, Volhynia is separated by the valley of the Sluch River. The historical center of the union of the Volynians of the 5th-10th centuries, apparently, was located in the city of Volyn, in the valley of the Western Bug near the modern city of Khrubeshuv (Poland). The chronicle mentions the city of Volyn under 1018. Archeology points to the 7th century as the time of the beginning of life in the settlement of Volyn. Around the middle of the 7th c. subjected to destruction, located nearby Zimnovskaya settlement. It could be the forerunner of historical Volhynia. In total, there were up to 70 cities and settlements in Volhynia.\n\nTo the west of the upper reaches of the Western Bug there is a historical region called Chervonnaya Rus, the center of which was in the 9th-13th centuries. was the city of Cherven. North of the ancient Cherven, at the beginning of the 13th century. a new center arose - the city of Kholm (now Chelm in Poland), and the surrounding lands began to be called Kholm Rus.\n\nIn 10-13 centuries. The Volyn Principality included lands in the upper reaches of the Neman with the cities of Goroden (now Grodno), Volkovysk, Tureisk, Slonim and Novgorodok (now Novogrudok - all on the territory of modern Belarus). The connection between Volhynia and the upper Neman was carried out through the Berestey land, the center of which was the city of Berestye (now Brest). The valleys of the Pripyat, Yaselda and Shchara rivers, due to their extreme swampiness and impassability, were at that time a kind of land \"Terra incognita\" on the way from Volyn to Ponemanye and to this day are one of the most picturesque places in Belarusian Polissya. The cities of Berestye and Drogochin, standing on the banks of the Western Bug, served for Volyn and for Kievan Rus as a whole - the western gate to the center of Europe.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 10th c. the old center of the union of the Volynians, Volyn, gave way to the new capital - Vladimir-Volynsky, which became a stronghold for the Kyiv dynasty, which planted its governors there. It is interesting that oikonyms with curious names are located south of Vladimir-Volynsky - Rusnov, Rusin (to the northeast of the city of Belz) and Varyazh, standing on the Verenzhanka River (the left tributary of the Western Bug). It is very likely that at the end of the 10th c. Kyiv princes-governors in Volhynia had to rely on the armed forces of Rus' and the Varangians. It is unlikely that toponyms with such eloquent names appeared in Volhynia by themselves.\n\nIn the Gorodishche tract, on the site of Volyn, there is a barrow necropolis of the 9th-12th centuries. Under its earthen hills there are burials made according to the rite of burial on the back, oriented with the head to the west. In the large Christian cities of Kievan Rus of that time, the creation of barrow necropolises was hardly possible, because it contradicted Christian ideas.\n\nConsequently, under the burial mounds of ancient Volhynia in the 9th-12th centuries. the nobility of the Volynians were buried, who stood apart from the princely dynasty of the Yaroslavovichs, and whom the metropolitan chronicles ignored.\n\nMainly, it was on these lands - Volhynia, Polissya, Beresteyshchyna, that later settlements arose, which, with one degree or another, can be attributed to the family members of the Gulevich surname.\n\nGulsk is a village a few kilometers south of the city of Zvyagel (now Novograd-Volynsky, Zhytomyr region) on the Sluch River.\n\nGuli is a settlement in the Vinnitsa region.\n\nHulivtsy (Hulivtsi, Hulowce, Hulewce) - a village south of Rivne (now Khmelnytsky region, Bilogirsky district) was known earlier in 1552 as the possession of the Gulevich zemyans.\n\nGulivka is a settlement in the Volyn region.\n\nGulevichi - a village south of the city of Kalinkovichi (Mozyr Polesie) has been known since the 16th century\n\nGulevichi - a village in the Beresteyshchyna (now the Kamenetsky district of the Brest region)\n\nGulevichevo - a village, existed in the Lutsk district of the Volyn province in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA little further, to the east, another settlement Gulevichi (now the Kirovograd region)\n\nThe hydronyms are also indicative: the river Gulva and the lake of the same name with it.\n\nPart 2. Lutsk\n\nOn an elevated cape formed by the bend of the Styr River and its right tributary, the Glusha River, stands ancient Lutsk, one of the most famous cities in Volhynia. The city most directly connected with the representatives of the large Gulevich family in Volhynia.\n\nNature itself took care of making Lutsk a stronghold of the land of Volyn, surrounding it with water from everywhere, surrounding the city from the south, west and north with riverbeds and lakes of oxbow lakes, and from the east with impenetrable swamps.\n\nThe peninsula thus formed consisted of three hills. On the higher of them, about 100 - 110 meters in size, there was a citadel of Lutsk. To the south, on a larger but lower hill, was a roundabout city. The area of ââLutsk surrounded by fortifications reached seven hectares.\n\nIt is known from archaeological research that the territory where Lutsk arose was inhabited during the Neolithic. Archaeologists have found the remains of dugouts dated to the 4th millennium BC. e. Material evidence of a later period was also found, in particular, the remains of land dwellings of Slavic origin, several groups of burial mounds, where samples of weapons, silver coins, etc. were found.\n\nThere are several versions regarding the origin of the name Lutsk. Some researchers believe that it is associated with the Luchanans, one of the tribes that were part of the Duleb union; later, the Luchians went to Eastern Europe and are known to sources among the tribes that became the basis of the future Czech nation.\n\nAnother assumption is based on the name, which comes from the Old Russian word \"bow\" - \"curvature\", \"bend\", \"bay\", \"shore of the bay\", \"bank of the river arc\". Indeed, the river Styr near Lutsk bends like a bow under a stretched bowstring.\n\nIt is possible that both versions are related to each other, and the Luchan tribe, like most Slavic tribes, received such a name from the surrounding area, such as the Dregovichi-Draguvites from “drygva” (Old Belative: swamp) or the Drevlyans, whose etymology is also transparent.\n\nThe most ancient settlements of Lutsk residents occupied only a small triangular cape between the rivers Styr and Maly Glushets (currently defunct), where the Lutsk castle now stands. In the times preceding the emergence of Kievan Rus, there was an ancient settlement on this territory, on the site of which a fortress was subsequently built.\n\nSettlement founded in the 7th or 8th c. Luchians, under the Kiev prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich (as indicated by some Polish sources) turned into a well-fortified fortress. In the annals, the city is referred to as Luchsk or \"Luchesk the Great in Styr\". For the first time, we find information about it, as about an already existing city, in the Ipatiev Chronicle under 1083, when the Polish army, led by King Boleslav the Bold, stood under the walls of Lutsk for 6 months.\n\nIn 1085, the Volyn prince Yaropolk Izyaslavovich, who went to Kyiv, was forced to flee to the Polish lands, leaving his family in reliable and impregnable Lutsk.\n\nIn 1097, the Grand Duke of Kiev Svyatopolk Izyaslavovich handed over Lutsk to the Chernigov prince Davyd Svyatoslavovich, who was soon forced to leave the city to the Volyn prince Davyd Igorevich. From then until the end of the 12th century. Lutsk remained part of the Vladimir-Volyn principality, and since 1199 - Galicia-Volyn. It was then that Lutsk was developing rapidly, gradually outpacing its older brother, the city of Vladimir. The navigable Styr through Pripyat connected Lutsk with Kiev, and further along the Dnieper - with Byzantium. In addition, trade routes that ran to the countries of the West and the Baltics crossed here. In the middle of the 13th c. the defense structures of the city are being improved.\n\nIt is generally accepted that at the end of the 13th century. Lutsk was surrounded by a stone fortress wall. In the 14th century the upper part of the walls and towers of Lutsk was finished with bricks. But in Lutsk there are no traces of the oldest log-earth fortifications, which should have preceded the stone ones. This suggests that already in the 11th-12th centuries Lutsk had stone defensive walls and was practically impregnable. However, Lutsk residents themselves had to go on military campaigns more than once.\n\nBack in 1173, the then prince of Lutsk Yaroslav Izyaslavovich appeared at the walls of capital Kyiv with a huge army, wanting to establish himself as the eldest among the South Russian princes. This campaign was repeated a year later, in retaliation for the desecration of their prince, betrayed along with his family by the people of Kiev. Then not only Kyiv and the property of its inhabitants were robbed, incl. abbots, priests, monks and nuns, foreigners, guests and even the cells of hermits, but also the cities of the neighboring Chernihiv land - Lutava and Moravsk. Yaroslav himself, having thus avenged the fullness of his wife and children, no longer wished to sit on the grand princely Kiev table and returned to his native Lutsk.\n\nIn 1202 and 1214 already his son Ingvar Yaroslavovich, with the support of the Luchians and the influential Volyn prince Roman Mstislavovich (and in 1214 - Mstislav Mstislavovich Udaly), was twice installed in Kiev on the grand prince's table, however, also not for long. Brother Mstislav Yaroslavovich Nemoy, who replaced him in Lutsk, together with the Lutsk militia, took part in the famous battle of the Kalka River in 1224, rescuing Daniel of Galicia in the battle. That battle with the soldiers of the Mongol commanders Dzhebe and Subedei ended very tragically for the Russian-Polovtsian troops. Of the 18 princes who participated in the battle, 9 perished. In the Russian squads, only one in ten survived.\n\nIn 1240, Lutsk did not escape the fate of most other Russian cities and was destroyed by Mongol detachments moving into Western Europe, but was soon rebuilt by Daniel of Galicia and his brother Vasilko Romanovich.\n\nIn the early fifties, 13 Art. the rulers of the Golden Horde made an attempt to strengthen their power in Volhynia, which actually did not belong to them. In 1252, the army of governor Kuremsa took possession of the Lower River, and in 1254 broke into Volhynia. In 1255, a long siege of Lutsk began. Kuremsa bombarded the city with stones from ballistic machines (gunpowder), but the townspeople heroically defended themselves and forced the enemy to retreat.\n\nFor several years there was a war with the hordes of Kuremsa, which did not lead to the submission of Southern Rus'. Prince Daniil of Galicia \"keeps the army with Kuremsa and is not at all afraid of Kuremsa.\" Only in 1259, when Burundai came \"with a multitude of Tatar regiments,\" Prince Daniel of Galicia was forced to submit. By order of Burundai, the fortifications of Lutsk, Danilov, Stozhesk, Lvov, Kremenets, Vladimir were destroyed. The second half of the 13th century was marked by the period of the rise of the city, when the son of Daniel of Galicia, Mstislav, ruled in the Principality of Lutsk. It was then that Lutsk was called Luchesky Bolshoy. Trade routes were concentrated here, which led from Lithuania (modern part of Belarus), North-Eastern Rus', Galich, Transnistria and the countries of Western Europe.\n\nAs a result of a number of victorious campaigns, Mstislav Daniilovich managed to eliminate the threat of encroachments by neighboring Lithuania on Lutsk. To assert his power, the prince seeks the formation of a separate Lutsk episcopal see. He paid great attention to construction. Under him, the construction of the castle tower over the entrance gates of the city, as well as the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, began. Another building of that time - the Dmitrievskaya Church, or rather, its history, turned out to be closely intertwined with the Gulevichs (more on this in the following chapters).\n\nBuilt in 1132 in the eastern part of the Lower Castle, it also served as a defensive structure. In 1845 it was destroyed by fire. The remains of the walls with fragments of the original ornament and wall paintings were dismantled in 1893. But thanks to the sketches made by the Russian artist A. Strokov, who was in Lutsk in 1866, we can have an idea of ââthe uniqueness of this landmark of ancient architecture. One of the masterpieces of Ukrainian painting of the 12th-13th centuries has survived to our time. - the icon of the Volyn (Lutsk) Mother of God, now located in the State Museum of Ukrainian Art in Kyiv. Experts attribute this work to 1289 and believe that it was commissioned by Prince Mstislav Daniilovich for the Cathedral of St. John the Theologian.\n\nIn 1320, the active expansion of \"Belarusian\" Lithuania to the former territories of the Volyn princes began, during which Lutsk was captured by supporters of the Lithuanian prince Gedemin. The last ruler of Lutsk from the \"Rurikovich\" Prince Lev Yuryevich died in 1323.\n\nSince 1340, Volhynia was completely under the control of the then risen principality of Lithuania, which united all the former Western Russian principalities on its base, the backbone of which was the territory of modern Belarus, and in cultural and linguistic terms, the new state became proto-Belarusian. Lubart-Dmitry Gediminovich, married to a Volyn princess from the defunct dynasty of Daniil Galitsky, became the prince of the Volyn land. Lubart chose Lutsk as his residence. The desire to gain a foothold in the city prompted him to continue strengthening the city, in particular, the Upper Castle.\n\nWhen in 1349 the Polish king Casimir occupied the Volyn and Galician lands, Lutsk became that stronghold that was beyond the strength of the Polish king, and from him Lubart began to win back the lands previously captured by the Poles bit by bit. After the death of Lubart (1384), his son Fyodor reigned in Lutsk.\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, whole quarters appeared in the city, inhabited by immigrants from Lithuania (mainly the territories of Polissya and Ponemanya adjacent to Volhynia) and Polish lands. To a large extent, the last fact was facilitated by the Union of 1387, concluded between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Russian and Zhamoit. Then, the Grand Duke Jagiello, in exchange for the hand of the Polish princess Jadwiga and the Polish crown, added the lands of his country to the nascent Commonwealth of both peoples. The result of the Unia was the transition of Jagiello and many of his entourage from Orthodoxy to Catholicism, as well as the granting of special liberty to the cities, whose inhabitants, for the most part, converted to the Latin faith, the Magdeburg Law.\n\nNot all cities supported Jagiello and the Polish protectorate, and after a three-year war in 1392, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vitovt achieved significant autonomy from the Polish crown lands, losing only to Galicia, which was annexed to the Polish crown immediately after the Union of 1387.\n\nIn 1410, the Lutsk detachment as part of the Polish-Lithuanian-Tatar army took part in the defeat of the knights of the Teutonic Order near Grunwald. In this battle, the backbone of the GDL army under the command of Vitovt was the banners of the Belarusian and Volyn cities, which made a decisive contribution to the overall victory.\n\nDuring the reign of Vytautas (1388-1430), Lutsk became the second capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after Vilna. At the suggestion of the emperor of the \"Holy Roman Empire\" Sigismund, in 1429, a congress of monarchs of European countries was held here, at which the issue of common actions against the raids of the Ottoman conquerors, the unification of the Catholic and Orthodox churches was discussed. The congress was very representative. Lutsk, in addition to the emperor, was honored by the presence of the former Grand Duke of Lithuania - King of Poland Jagiello (Vladislav I Jagiello), Grand Duke of Moscow Vasily II with many specific princes and Metropolitan Photius, papal legate, King of Denmark, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Wallachian ruler and ambassador from the Byzantine emperor. The Crimean Khan also came. Vitovt rebuilds Lubart's castle, promotes the resettlement of the Jewish, Tatar and Keraim population in Lutsk, giving them broad rights. The grand duke also takes care of the catholic church that was born here. Together with Jagiello, he founded the monastery of the \"Dominicans\" in Lutsk, the Catholic department of St. Trinity, and in 1428 transferred to Lutsk the Catholic episcopal see from Volodymyr Volynsky. In 1432, Lutsk finally won Magdeburg rights for itself...\n\nSpeaking about the restructuring of the Lutsk castle and its maintenance, one cannot fail to note the following feature. The fortress walls and towers of the castle were divided between the ruling urban families, whose responsibility was to maintain and repair the wooden \"gorodenny\" located on them at the expense of funds from their estates. Among these families, by the way, are the Gulevichs. Later sources give an idea of ââthis.\n\nFor example, the first “gorodnya” from the Entrance (Gate) tower “on the right hand going to the castle” was assigned to the Gulevichs “from their patrimonial estate Sernik and other estates”; Mikhno Boratinsky from the Vishnevo estate, Semyon and Gavriil Gulevich-Voyutinsky from Voyutin are also listed there as “responsible”, and the roof of this town was built by the Drozdenskys (all representatives of different branches of the Gulevichs). Another gorodnya, which belonged to the Gulevichs, was located directly on the stone walls of the district castle. The first, in the order of calculation according to the source, is precisely “the town of Gulevich, from Sernik and from others, Drozdensky from Drozdyan, Voyutinsky from Voyutino, Mikhno from Brokhovich and from Vishnevo”.\n\nDirectly at the moat of the castle, near the Entrance Tower, a unique architectural monument of the 16th-18th centuries has been preserved to this day. - a residential building of the Gulevichs, originally owned by the Orthodox Bishop A. Puzyna, and then passed to the Gulevichs.\n\nPart 3. Svidrigailo\n\nAt the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries. most of the boyars of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of Rusyn origin, were obliged to serve the Grand Duke of Lithuania. These were numerous boyar families - Glebovichi, Ilinichi, Nemirovichi, Olekhnovichi, Mitkovichi, Volodkovichi in Vitebsk, Korsakovichi and Radkevichi - in Polotsk, Polozovichi in Kiev, Shilovichi and Gulevichi - in Volyn, etc.\n\nThe first information about the Gulevichs dates back to 1407, when Mikhail Gulevich was mentioned in Galicia.\n\nAnother Gulevich - Ivan in 1421 received a loan letter from a certain Vasily Moshonchich: \"... Ozhe knew that Pan Ivashka had a hundred poods from Gulevich, and I have Pan Ivashkovi to give a hundred kopecks from this Mother of God ...\" (A sheet is written under years of the Nativity of Christ 1000 years 421 at the house near Tsindl, in Lvov.).\n\nIn May 1432, Ivan Gulevich was among the signatories of the truce between the great Lithuanian prince Svidrigailo and the crusaders, and together with his brother Masko Gulevich was mentioned in the privilege of Svidrigailo from 1438.\n\nProbably, these first, of the Gulevichs known to us, were among the active supporters of the Grand Duke Svidrigailo, to whom they owed their service. Their participation in the signing of agreements with the Order was most likely due to the desire of the Grand Duke to rely, including on urban communities and volosts, because on the part of the Order, in addition to officials ... and knights .., also cities. ..” The agreement specifies representatives of the GDL cities, called “landrichter” or “lantrichter”, which can be translated as “zemstvo judges”, “zemstvo administrators”, with a stretch - something like the heads of city magistrates.\n\nConfirmation of the active participation of urban communities in the war on the side of Svidrigailo is found in the Slutsk and Academic Chronicles, which indicate that during the Vilkomir battle of 1435, “many ... princes, and boyars, and burghers (mestiches)” fell on the side of Svidrigailo.\n\nIn order to understand the motives for which Orthodox residents, including the Gulevich brothers known to us, united around Svidrigailo, we need to go back to 1413. In that year, the so-called Horodel Union between the Crown of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was concluded by King Vladislav-Jagiello of Poland and his cousin Vytautas. The very nature of the Union of Gorodel was largely anti-Orthodox, which was regarded by the local Orthodox population as an encroachment on its ancient spiritual foundations. The gentry of the “Lithuanian lands” was granted a number of privileges, which, as it was repeatedly emphasized in the privilege, could only be used by “... admirers of the Christian religion, subject to the Roman Church, not schismatics or other unbelievers.” In particular, Orthodox nobles were denied the right to hold public office and sit in the grand ducal council when discussing matters relating to the \"good of the state.\" It was assumed that the very act of the union had to be approved by each successive Grand Duke of Lithuania or the King of Poland. After the death of Vitovt, Svidrigailo was elected Grand Duke in Lithuania and approved by Jagiello without \"advice\" from the Polish gentry, however, the Polish gentry was even more dissatisfied with the fact that the approval of the new act of the union depended on the newly elected Grand Duke, which the son of the Tver princess Ulyana never was not going to do as a person committed to Orthodoxy.\n\nThe Polish gentry at the Sandomierz Sejm even suspected their king Jagiello of treason and secret patronage of the Lithuanian \"schismatic\" prince. They force Jagiello to unleash hostilities in Podolia and Volhynia. 1430-1431 were marked for Svidrigailo by an alliance with the Livonian Order, the struggle with the Kingdom of Poland for Podolia and Volhynia (the so-called \"Lutsk War\"),\n\nIn the summer of 1431, Polish troops crossed the Bug, captured Vladimir-Volynsky and besieged the Lutsk castle. Having met with the Poles near Lutsk, Svidrigailo evaded the battle, but the governor Svidrigailov - Yursha managed to repulse several assaults on the city and the siege of Lutsk dragged on. The inhabitants of Lutsk withstood the siege from the royal army with amazing courage; despite the fact that, according to the assurances of the Polish historian, the city would have to surrender soon and the war would have ended with benefit and honor for the king and kingdom, if Jagiello himself did not interfere, favoring Svidrigailo and his subjects, with whom he hastened to conclude a truce, and there was a time and a place for negotiations for perpetual peace. The king lifted the siege of Lutsk, and the Russians celebrated the retreat of the enemy by destroying all the Catholic churches in the Lutsk land.\n\nSince 1432, a civil war broke out in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Svidrigailo was opposed by his cousin Sigismund (Zhigimont) Keistutevich. Sigismund, who overthrew Svidrigailo from the throne in 1432, was a \"creature of the Poles\", received military and political assistance from them in exchange for humility in matters relating to Podolia and the resumption of the union. As the order spy reported to the master: “The whole Lithuanian land is against the Poles, and common people say that they submitted to Zhigimont, not knowing that Svidrigailo is alive, many residents, having left their wives and children, flock to Svidrigailo.”\n\nForced to flee to Polotsk, or to the so-called Lithuanian Rus, Svidrigailo, as before, relied mainly on the Russian Orthodox population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It is no coincidence that, according to the Belarusian-Lithuanian chronicles, Svidrigailo, who found support there, was declared \"Russian princes and boyars\" - the Grand Duke of Russia.\n\nAll Eastern Belarus, Volyn and Podolsk lands, Kiev, Chernigov, Putivl, Novgorod-Seversky, Trubchesk, Starodub, Serpeysk, Tula, Kursk, Vyazma, Smolensk, Oskol, Pinsk submitted to Svidrigailo. The Grand Duchy split into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Russia.\n\nConfrontation between \"Catholic Lithuania\" \"Lithuanians and Poles\" Sigismund Keistutyevich and \"Russian nationality\", which included \"a wide front of the Russian population: princes, boyars, petty feudal lords ... petty bourgeois\", as well as \"natural\" Lithuanian princes and gentry who adhered to Orthodoxy; determined the confessional component of the civil war of the 1430s. The war became a prologue to future confessional contradictions of the late 16th - early 17th centuries.\n\nThe fact that it was mainly of a political and confessional nature is evidenced by the chronicles of those years. So Stryikovsky, in relation to one of the events of the Lutsk war (1431), writes: In the Lutsk castle \"... the Russians and Lithuanians, who were with them of the Greek religion,\" killed all the Poles and Catholics. During the struggle for Podolia, the Orthodox population \"turned to ashes\" Catholic churches and destroyed the Catholics themselves. In turn, at one appearance of the Polish Catholic army, the “Rusyns” (that is, the same Orthodox) fled and hid in the forests with all their families and property. Dlugosh noted that during the siege of Lutsk, both sides were filled with bloody cruelty towards the captives.\n\nTrying to attract the Orthodox population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the side of Sigismund, on October 15, 1432, Jagiello issued a state-legal act (privilege), according to which representatives of the most ancient families of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Orthodox faith were equalized in rights with Catholics. After the death of Jagiello in 1434, despite the fact that Sigismund on May 6 of this year confirmed the privileges of the Orthodox nobility proclaimed by Jagiello, the war continued. The 9th paragraph of the Gorodel Privilege of 1413, which deprived persons of the Orthodox faith of the right to occupy the highest government posts in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was not canceled.\n\nThe brutal defeat near Vilkomir (now Ukmerge in Lithuania), as a result of which more than 30 Orthodox princes were captured, as well as the defection of prominent military leaders of Svidrigailo, led by Fedor Ostrozhsky, to the side of Sigismund, significantly weakened the position of the \"Orthodox party\" in the GDL.\n\nFor some time, Svidrigailo himself thought about introducing a church union, but this step did not find support among his allies - the Orthodox magnates of Volhynia and other Ruthenian lands.\n\nIn 1435, on the orders of Svidrigailo, the head of the Western Russian church, Metropolitan Gerasim, was burned alive in Vitebsk. Previously, Gerasim himself advocated the extension of the union with the papal throne to the Grand Duchy. The Pskov chronicles indicate the reason for the execution: some “letters of passage” from Gerasim to Sigismund Keystutevich were intercepted, in other words, Gerasim was preparing a conspiracy against Svidrigailo. It can be assumed that friction between the head of the Orthodox coalition and Metropolitan Gerasim could arise on the basis of the unpopularity of the church union among Svidrigailo's supporters, which the prince could not ignore.\n\nLutsk for several years played the role of a strategic point in the struggle of Svidrigailo against the Poles and Sigismund Keystutevich. For this reason, the leaders of the enemy camps of the civil war vying with each other tried to attract its inhabitants with their favors. Svidrigailo gave Lutsk burghers the right to free use of local forest land, including logging for construction, mowing hay and grazing livestock. The Polish king Jagiello granted the Lutsk land of Privilei, according to which princes, prelates, boyars, “milites nobiles ceterique ...” (i.e., “nobles and gentry”) were equalized in rights with the king’s Polish subjects, regardless of religion. However, this privileges had no practical significance, since the city soon came under the control of supporters of the Orthodox party of Svidrigailo, among whom were Gulevichi.\n\nIn 1437, Svidrigailo was actually forced to recognize vassal dependence on the Polish king Vladislav III. Two years later, he finally lost influence in the lands of the GDL and was forced to seek refuge in the territory of Wallachia and Hungary.\n\nReturning, Svidrigailo received back his lands in Volhynia and Podolia, but already as a vassal of King Sigismund, being reigning in Lutsk.\n\nWhen in 1450 Sigismund Keistutovich fell at the hands of the conspirators, Svidrigailo was again called to the Grand Duke's table, but, not being able, due to old age, to do something energetic, he remained until his death in the Podolsk and Volyn lands, which were behind him in 1442 city ââapproved by the Poles. He died a natural death on February 10, 1452, at a very advanced age, which was an extremely rare occurrence for that time. He transferred his possessions to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nAfter the death of Svidrigailo in 1452, the Poles from Lesser (southern) Poland tried to capture Lutsk, but their actions were not supported by the nobility of Greater (northern) Poland and the monarch himself. In 1453, Casimir IV at the Sejm in Petrikov (now the Gomel region of Belarus) swore to the Poles that the lands belonging to it, including Lithuania, Rus' and Moldavia, would not be alienated from the Polish crown. Casimir's speech caused a negative reaction from the aristocracy of the GDL. The Litvins defiantly renounced the Polish emblems and privileges that were associated with them, and expressed their readiness to start a war with Poland. A fierce rebuff forced the Polish king to renounce his claims to Volhynia. In 1456, Casimir IV reaffirmed the state sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nThe sons of Ivan (Ivashko) Gulevich - Vasko from Voyutin and Mikita from Dublyan, as well as their sister Nastasya - laid the foundation for the next generation of the Gulevichs known from the sources, of which only Vasko continued the line of the future family, leaving behind his sons: Parkhom (Pavel), Mikita (Dimitr) and Yatsko. The middle of them was destined to become the founder of the most famous branches of the Gulevichs - the Volyn noble family, who played an active role in the course of the future confrontation between the Orthodox and Catholic Uniate parties in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nIn the census of the troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (\"Popis of the Volyn land\") of 1528, two brothers Gulevichi are indicated : Mikhailo and Fedor, who fielded 3 and 4 fully armed horsemen for the army, respectively. I must say that arming and equipping even one rider was not an easy task and required a lot of money. Probably, the Gulevichi, by that time, gradually began to win the position of one of the significant families of the Volyn land, both in wealth and in influence.\n\nPart 4. Union\n\nBy the end of the 16th century The Gulevichi were a fairly branched clan, which consisted of six main branches, namely: Voyutinskaya, Drozdenskaya, Dolskaya (Dolzhetskaya), Zaturkishskaya, Perekalskaya and Gulevichevskaya proper. The latter, with their property status, belonged rather to the magnates, while the rest of their relatives were content with a more modest role, being located among the middle and fractional gentry. However, the entire Gulevich family enjoyed well-deserved authority among the Volyn nobility, as evidenced by the presence of various representatives of the Gulevich family in high elected positions, matrimonial ties with representatives of princely families and a prominent place for their representatives among the higher and middle clergy of the Orthodox Church.\n\nOn July 1, 1569, in the city of Lublin, the formation of the Commonwealth, the federal state of the \"two peoples\" of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which merged into a \"single inseparable body\", was proclaimed by the Act of the Unifying Seimas. Volyn, and with it Lutsk, fell under the rule of the Polish Crown for more than two centuries and became the center of the Volyn province.\n\nLike many other ancient Russian families, Gulevichi at the turn of the 15th-16th centuries. were forced to participate in religious, confessional conflicts, which by that time had engulfed the territory of the western Russian lands, dependent on the Polish Crown and the papal throne. And although different representatives of the family expressed sympathy for almost all the confessional groups that were then active - Catholics, Uniates (Greek Catholics) and Protestants, Gulevichs, basically, for a long time remained principled and consistent champions of Orthodoxy - the faith of their ancestors, and defenders of the rights of the Orthodox population .\n\nThe “Orthodox group” of this surname was numerous, according to the documents, more than 30 representatives of the surname were identified who supported Orthodoxy in various ways, participating in sejmiks, signing protests and collective statements, stood at the foundation of the Lutsk Orthodox Brotherhood or acted as patrons of Orthodox churches, monasteries and schools.\n\nBy the time the Brest Church Union was proclaimed, the Orthodox gentry of Volhynia actively used various methods of political confrontation in their struggle against the Uniates (those who agreed to go under the pressure of the state machine of the Commonwealth under the patronage of the Roman Church). One of the most effective was the \"parliamentary struggle\", during which the rights of the Orthodox gentry were defended at povet sejmiks and sejms. It should be noted that the state structure of the Commonwealth, unlike the neighboring states of that time, despite the obvious dominant role of the Catholic Church, allowed this to be done. And the role of the Gulevich family in this struggle was quite noticeable.\n\nIn the Lutsk diocese and in general in Volhynia, the union immediately began to spread among the Orthodox nobility, or gentry. In 1598, several noblemen of the Voivodeship of Volyn and other counties, having gathered in Lutsk, wrote a statement, or request, to the Senate and the king. In this statement, they said that they thanked God, who had enabled them to live until the union of the Eastern Church with the Roman Church, they also thanked the spiritual persons who zealously labored for the union, and recognized them as their bishops, and asked that the holy union should not be violated in any way. “And besides,” the nobles added in conclusion, “we humbly ask for a new calendar, so that there will be no confusion and separation between us, since the calendar is not a member of the faith, but that we, as happened before, celebrate and celebrate holidays of our Greek faith all together and with one accord; these nobles not only themselves agreed to accept the new calendar, but asked that it be imposed by the government and all the Uniates, although during the adoption of the union in Brest, according to Metropolitan Ragoza, who will rise to the new.\" Up to 33 nobles, or landowners, signed and affixed their seals to the king and the senate, including Stanislav Radziwill, Yury Chartoryisky, Mikhail Myshka, the castellan of Volyn, the headman of Kamenets, Abraham Myshka, the headman of Ovruch, Ivan Gulevich, Gabriel Savitsky, protopresbyter Dedinsky, Sasin Rusinovich Berestetsky, judge Grodsky Lutsky, Zakhary Yalovitsky, clerk of his royal grace, Ivan Tyshkevich and others. these nobles not only themselves agreed to accept the new calendar, but asked that it be imposed by the government and all the Uniates, although during the adoption of the union in Brest, according to Metropolitan Ragoza, who will rise to the new.\" Up to 33 nobles, or landowners, signed and affixed their seals to the king and the senate, including Stanislav Radziwill, Yury Chartoryisky, Mikhail Myshka, the castellan of Volyn, the headman of Kamenets, Abraham Myshka, the headman of Ovruch, Ivan Gulevich, Gabriel Savitsky, protopresbyter Dedinsky, Sasin Rusinovich Berestetsky, judge Grodsky Lutsky, Zakhary Yalovitsky, clerk of his royal grace, Ivan Tyshkevich and others. so that it be imposed by the government and all the Uniates, although during the adoption of the union in Brest, according to Metropolitan Ragoza, \"they kept the calendar and Paschal in the old way, but whoever will grow up in a new way.\" Up to 33 nobles, or landowners, signed and affixed their seals to the king and the senate, including Stanislav Radziwill, Yury Chartoryisky, Mikhail Myshka, the castellan of Volyn, the headman of Kamenets, Abraham Myshka, the headman of Ovruch, Ivan Gulevich, Gabriel Savitsky, protopresbyter Dedinsky, Sasin Rusinovich Berestetsky, judge Grodsky Lutsky, Zakhary Yalovitsky, clerk of his royal grace, Ivan Tyshkevich and others. so that it be imposed by the government and all the Uniates, although during the adoption of the union in Brest, according to Metropolitan Ragoza, \"they kept the calendar and Paschal in the old way, but whoever will grow up in a new way.\" Up to 33 nobles, or landowners, signed and affixed their seals to the king and the senate, including Stanislav Radziwill, Yury Chartoryisky, Mikhail Myshka, the castellan of Volyn, the headman of Kamenets, Abraham Myshka, the headman of Ovruch, Ivan Gulevich, Gabriel Savitsky, protopresbyter Dedinsky, Sasin Rusinovich Berestetsky, judge Grodsky Lutsky, Zakhary Yalovitsky, clerk of his royal grace, Ivan Tyshkevich and others.\n\nThe Orthodox did not stop taking their measures to protect themselves and their faith from the Uniates and papists. Patriarch Meletios of Alexandria resigned in 1599 the locum tenens of the Patriarchal Throne of Constantinople, but even after that he did not stop his pastoral care for the Western Russian Church, with which he had been in contact for a long time. In 1600, he sent here, through his protosyncell Cyril Lukaris, several messages to various people. There were messages: to Prince K.K. did not know about his fall into the union), Mikhail Gulevich, Andrey and Alexander Zagorovsky and others, now with praise for firmness in the Orthodox faith, now with the conviction to keep it in the future.\n\nZemsky ambassadors of those voivodeships where Orthodoxy prevailed were instructed by the sejmiks to insist on improving the position of the Orthodox faith, on eliminating the injustices tolerated by the Orthodox.\n\nAs an example of such instructions, one can point to the instruction to the Sejm ambassadors of the Volyn Voivodeship. It says that the nobility of the ancient Greek faith, under the obedience of the Patriarch of Constantinople from 1596, complains about the violation (orpressia) of their ancient rights, approved by the privileges of the Polish-Lithuanian sovereigns and the confederations of the previous kingdoms. The mentioned violations consist in non-observance of peace among those scattered in faith, in the distribution of benefices, connected with the Kiev Metropolis, dominions and archimandrites, not to local natives, in accordance with the rights and privileges of the union (Lublin 1569), but to outsiders (extraneis) and those who succumbed to the Roman church, and not to their own pastors, who were subordinate to the Patriarch of Constantinople - in that\n\nThe ambassadors had to demand thorough reassurance, namely: that benefices be distributed to the metropolitan, who obeys the Patriarch of Constantinople, and to the bishops consecrated to him, and for the future, always and everywhere in this way, and not otherwise, and, upon the release of the metropolis or diocese, it was provided to worthy people, local natives, in accordance with the privilege given at the conclusion of the Union of Lublin, and what is violated must be restored again, so that there is no reason for further violations, but so that everyone remains in peace with their rights. Without such reassurance, the ambassadors should not proceed to any business, and even more so to the coronation (do coronaciey) of the king. The same nobility instructs its ambassadors to insist that the priests should not be burdened by any taxes (podatkami) either personally or from their churches, to the Lutsk castle church of St. Demetrius, built by the pans Gulevich, who do not recognize the union, was returned to them from the Uniates and so that their surname would forever have the right to submit to this church a priest who is in obedience to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Volhynian ambassadors also had to strive for the diocese of Vladimir to be taken away from the metropolitan (Rutsky) and given to a special bishop, since the concentration of the metropolis and dominion in the same hands is contrary to the law de incompatibilibus. The same ambassadors were charged with the duty to try to ensure that the oath by the future king was pronounced literally (intacte) in the form in which it was pronounced by the last three kings (i.e. Henry of Valois, Stefan Batory and Sigismund III), because it is well defined the position of those divided in faith. built by the pans Gulevich, who do not recognize the union, was returned to them from the Uniates and so that their surname would forever have the right to give to this church a priest who is in obedience to the Patriarch of Constantinople.

The envoys had to point out the violation of the rights of the dissidents, confirmed by the kings, which resulted in various places for the churches of the Greek religion and for dissident gatherings and prayer houses great falsehoods and violence; at the same time, they must demand, for the sake of inner peace, the establishment of due process and execution for persons of every rank and state, both spiritual and secular, for violating the religious peace and ensuring the free exercise of religion for everyone and everywhere, which should be expresse discussed in the assembly laws (in codice legum) and is included in the formula of the oath of the future king.\n\nThe first to stand up for the Orthodox among the Gulevichs was one of the grandsons of the Lutsk Orthodox Bishop Theodosius Gulevich, Demyan Romanovich, who himself was a supporter of the Protestant Church, which was gaining strength in Western Europe. Demyan Gulevich took part in the work of the Orthodox (anti-Uniate) cathedral in Brest in October 1596. Being a member of the Sejm in 1597, he spoke at it from the Orthodox group, and in 1598 he was sent to Warsaw with the same mission, delegating him to Orthodox electors.\n\nFour months after the Brest Council, which adopted the union, the General Seim opened in Warsaw (in February and March 1597). The Russian Orthodox ambassadors who arrived first of all announced that they would not start any business until they received satisfaction in the case of their faith, demanded that their rulers, who did not want to obey the pope, remain in their old rights and that pacta conventa be sacredly performed in general. , approved by the oath of the king.\n\nEspecially sharply, which the royal chroniclers did not use to note, Demyan Gulevich spoke to the king on March 7, insisting that the Russian lords remain with their ancient faith, and the lords who accepted the union were overthrown. Chancellor Sapega answered Gulevich that all the Orthodox in Brest wanted the union and accepted it, except for Nicephorus the Greek, according to Sapieha, a rebel and a vicious person. With these words, another influential Orthodox magnate, Prince K. K. Ostrozhsky, was deeply upset and entered into a strong altercation with Sapieha ....\n\nIn 1601, the statement of the Orthodox Volyn gentry about their readiness to support the Lublin Orthodox Brotherhood was already signed by four representatives of the Gulevich family: the Lutsk Zemstvo clerk Mikhailo Gulevich-Voyutinsky, Andrei Gulevich, Mikhailo Gulevich and Yuri Gulevich. Andrei was the most active, who twice more - in 1608 and 1616 signed special instructions from the Volyn gentry to his ambassadors to the Sejm, in which they were ordered to protect the rights of the Orthodox Church.\n\nAmong such instructions are 1608, 1616, 1632, 1639. in defense of Orthodoxy, we find the signatures of the above-mentioned Mikhailo Gulevich, as well as Fedor, Luka and Danila from the Gulevich-Voyutinsky branch.\n\nBut the struggle of the Orthodox gentry for the restoration of their own rights was expressed not only by instructions to the ambassadors. The members of the sejmiks filed protests with the district courts on various issues that, in their opinion, infringe on the Orthodox population. One such protest, dated 10 September 1607, concerned nominations for the chair of Lutsk Bishop - Ostafiy Yelo-Malinsky, signed by Gnevosh Gulevich-Drozdensky and Ivan Gulevich. Another protest dated September 1, 1635 concerned the candidacy of Joseph Bakovetsky for the Vladimir-Volyn episcopal see. This statement was signed by the Lutsk subcommissar Yuriy Gulevich, the Lutsk Zemsky clerk Semyon Gulevich-Voyutinsky (the future Orthodox Bishop of Przemysl Sylvester), as well as Pavel Gulevich - Voyutinsky and Ivan Gulevich. Probably, both applicants did not meet the interests of the Orthodox gentry.\n\nAn important contribution to the political struggle of the Orthodox gentry against the union was the active participation of the Guleviches in the founding of the Lutsk Orthodox Brotherhood. It is known that among its founders in 1617-1619. there were seven representatives of the Gulevich family, namely: the Lutsk tribunal Mikhailo Gulevich - Voyutinsky, Yatsko Gulevich - Voyutinsky, Semyon Gulevich - Voyutinsky, Fedor Gulevich - Voyutinsky, as well as Ivan, Roman and Peter Gulevichi.\n\nBut the struggle between the Uniates and the Orthodox often developed into military actions. In a number of cases, one of the parties (both Uniates and Orthodox) staged military raids on their opponents, seeking to restore their rights to churches or possessions where, due to the weakness of the current local authorities, court decisions on this matter were not implemented. And here it could not do without the Gulevichs, who spoke on the side of the Orthodox.\n\nSo, during the struggle of the Orthodox Bishop Sylvester Gulevich with the Uniate Bishop Athanasius Krupetsky, Alexander and Danilo Gulevich \"distinguished themselves\". For active participation in the storming of the monastery of the Holy Savior, these Gulevichs were given infamily.\n\nThe Gulevichs also took part in anti-Uniate actions in Volhynia and became their target themselves.\n\nDuring the uprising of Severin Nalivaiko, when in October 1595 the Cossack detachments operated on the territory of Volhynia, they found supporters, mainly among the opponents of the Union. The side of the rebels was also held by some nobles, so Prince Janusz Voronetsky gave a brothel to Nalivaiko's associates in his estate Omelnik. Another accomplice of the Cossack ataman was Alexander Gulevich, the son of Demyan Gulevich mentioned above. In 1599, father and son were killed as a result of a robbery on the road to the Sejm in Warsaw, probably organized by their opponents from the camp of the Uniates.\n\nIn October 1637, the Orthodox Bishop of Lutsk Athanasius Puzina tried to annex the possessions of the Lutsk Uniate Chapter, which, after the death of Bishop Jeremiah Pochapovsky, were to go to the Orthodox. Since the Uniates themselves did not want to voluntarily retreat from these possessions, Bishop Athanasius used force. On October 30-31, an armed detachment led by Jan Gulevich captured the town of Rozhishchi, as well as the village of Vodirady, driving out the Uniate priests and viceroys of the Uniate chapter.\n\nThe most effective method of struggle between supporters and opponents of the union was to obtain the right of patronage for the gentry over churches and monasteries in their possessions. The struggle for the Church of St. Demetrius in Lutsk between the Lutsk episcopate and Gulevichi - Zaturkishki is a confirmation of this. The history of this opposition dates back to the 16th century, when the ancestor of these Gulevichs, the already known to us Bishop Theodosius of Lutsk (in the world Fyodor Gulevich), rebuilt this temple, known since the 13th century. Prior to the adoption of the Unia, the conflict with the ownership of the Church of St. Demetrius and the adjacent village of Korshovets had a sluggish character. The Lutsk episcopate proceeded from the fact that the activity of the Lutsk Bishop Theodosius was in itself proof that the Dimitrov Church and Korshovets should be in the possession of the Lutsk episcopate. Against, the descendants of Theodosius - Gulevichi-Zaturkursky (nickname from the family property - the village of Zaturtsy, now the Lokachinsky district of the Volyn region) insisted that the temple was founded as a family one and, according to family legends, since the time of the \"Russian princes\"; whose heirs, the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and the kings of Poland, confirmed the right of the Gulevichs to patronage over this temple, together with the village of Korshovets. The situation was complicated by the lack of reliable documents from both sides confirming their rights and was unresolved, giving rise to enmity between the Guleviches and subsequent Lutsk Orthodox bishops. However, the severity of the problem became apparent after the Brest Cathedral in 1596, which announced the Union of the Orthodox lands with the Catholic Church. The Gulevich-Zaturksky family from the very beginning took an anti-Uniate position,\n\nIn addition to the religious, the Gulevichs also had economic reasons to fight against the Lutsk Uniates in the late 16th - early 17th centuries. One of the richest representatives of the Gulevich family of that time, Vasily Fedorovich Gulevich - Zaturkishsky (one of the younger sons of the Lutsk Bishop Theodosius), shortly before his death, joined the fight against the supporters of the Union: in November 1600, he finally captured the village of Korshovets by force and annexed to his possessions of land in the Lutsk castle, together with the church of St. Demetrius. Attempts of the Lutsk Bishops-Uniates to challenge the actions of Vasily Gulevich in court were not successful. The influence of this Gulevich (since 1561 - the elder, and from 1566 - the troops (voivode) of Vladimir) was too great, and the possessions were quite extensive. Therefore, until the founding of the Lutsk Orthodox Brotherhood, the Dimitrov Church became the only Orthodox church in Lutsk that was not subordinate to the Uniate bishops.\n\nObviously, the temple itself became the center of the struggle between supporters and opponents of the Unia in Lutsk. Orthodox priests, with the direct support of Vasily's son, Andrey Gulevich - Zaturetsky, openly agitated the Uniate parishioners against the Uniate clergy. The activities of the Orthodox community of the church of St. Demetrius aroused the indignation of the Uniate rulers, but after the death of the patron of all Orthodox Lutsk - Andrey Vasilyevich Gulevich (died no later than 1623), the situation changed dramatically. The eldest sons of Andrei - Alexander and Mikhail Gulevich died young, and the younger Dmitry went to the Catholic Order of the \"Dominicans\", taking the name \"Hippolit\" and transferring his \"fatherland\" - the Orthodox Church of St. Demetrius to the possession of Dominican Catholics. The reasons that prompted the last representative of this branch of the Gulevichs to take such a step are not known for certain.\n\nIn 1610, Melety Smotrytsky, under the name of Ortologist, in the book \"Lament of the Eastern Church\" complains about the loss of the most important Russian surnames. These are the lines, expressed consciousness in the successes that Catholicism had already won among the noble Russian nobility at that time. “Where is that priceless stone,” asked the Orthodox Church, mourning her losses, “which I, among other pearls, like the sun between the stars, wore in a crown on my head, — where is the house of the Ostrozhsky princes, which shone more than all others with the brilliance of its ancient faith? Where and other precious stones of the same crown - the families of the princes of Slutsk, Zaslavsky, Vishnevetsky, Zbarazhsky, Sangushek, Czartorysky, Pronsky, Ruzhinsky, Solomeretsky, Golovchinsky, Krashinsky, Masalsky, Gorsky, Sokolinsky, Lukomsky, Puzynov and others, which would take a long time to list? Where are my other treasures - where are the ancient, well-born, strong, famous throughout the world for their courage and valor Khodkevichi, Glebovichi, Kishki, Sapieha, Dorogostaisky, Voyny, Volovichi,\n\n“The villains took away this precious clothes from me and now they are cursing my poor body, from which everyone came out!”\n\nWhat impression Smotrytsky's book made can be seen from the fact that the famous Jesuit Peter Skarga himself hurried to publish in the same year his \"Warning for Russia of the Greek Faith Against the Lamentation of Theophilus Orthologue\", and two years later (1612) and the learned Uniate Ilya Morokhovsky, royal secretary, published in Vilna his \"Consolation, or Satisfaction, of the Weeping of the Eastern Church by Theophilus Orthologue\". Both authors fiercely attacked Smotrytsky, called him a disciple of Luther and Calvin and tried to prove, contrary to his evidence, that the Roman Church always preserved and retains the true teaching of the faith, but on the contrary, the Eastern evaded it as soon as it broke off communication and unity with the Roman.\n\nIt should not, of course, be understood that all these Russian noble families betrayed Orthodoxy already during the period of the union and in their entire composition or in all their branches: some adopted Protestantism and then Catholicism or directly Catholicism even before the union, and in other genera (which are : Skumin, Solomeretsky, Gulevich) there were still branches that still adhered to Orthodoxy.\n\nWishing to prevent the spread of Smotrytsky's \"Frinos\", the enemies of the Orthodox informed the king, who was then near Smolensk with an army, that books filled with libels were being secretly printed in the Vilna drukarna of the Holy Spirit Brotherhood and inciting a revolt against spiritual and civil authorities. And Sigismund issued a decree (May 7, 1610) that no one should buy or sell those books under fear of a fine of five thousand zlotys, and ordered the Vilna voit and the magistrate to take away that drukarny, books also to be taken away and burned, as well as printers and authors those libels, as well as \"their proof-reader Logvin Karpovich, especially if he is not a gentry\", put him in the town hall or in some kind of prison until further notice. The Vilna Burmisters soon (June 13) selected 36 books of Frinos, to which at the same time the elders of the Orthodox Vilna Brotherhood brought a complaint to the Tribunal. But the brotherhood probably managed to save its drukarny and font and move it to the town of Evie (now Vevis in Lithuania), the estate of his brother and former headman, Prince Bogdan Oginsky (35 versts from Vilna). At least here it was, as in the printing house of the \"Vilna brotherhood of the Holy Spirit\", from 1611 the monks of the Vilna cenobitic monastery of the Holy Spirit began to print their books, some with \"cost and overhead\" of the noble pan Oginsky, and others with their own, and for three years (1611 - 1613) published the Psalter and the New Testament (in one book), Book of Hours, Dioptra and Anthologion. managed to save and transfer to the town of Evie (now Vevis in Lithuania), the estate of his brother and former headman, Prince Bogdan Oginsky (35 miles from Vilna). At least here it was, as in the printing house of the \"Vilna brotherhood of the Holy Spirit\", from 1611 the monks of the Vilna cenobitic monastery of the Holy Spirit began to print their books, some with \"cost and overhead\" of the noble pan Oginsky, and others with their own, and for three years (1611 - 1613) published the Psalter and the New Testament (in one book), Book of Hours, Dioptra and Anthologion. managed to save and transfer to the town of Evie (now Vevis in Lithuania), the estate of his brother and former headman, Prince Bogdan Oginsky (35 miles from Vilna).

At the head of this struggle are now representatives The Voyutin branch of this family, in particular, the Lutsk clerk Semyon Gulevich-Voyutinsky, as well as Pavel and Andrey Gulevich-Voyutinsky. In the city of Lutsk, in which there were eight Orthodox churches before the union, now there was not a single one, and the surrounding Orthodox nobles, who often visited this city on business, did not find a place in it where they could pray on holidays. Only half a verst from Lutsk, on an island across the Styr River, there remained a small Orthodox monastery Chernchitsky or Cherchitsky, where the Orthodox resorted to for their spiritual needs. The pious schemnik Grigory Mikulich labored here, formerly hegumen of the Chernchitsky monastery and was called Gerasim. He proposed to the Orthodox the idea of ââfounding a church brotherhood in Lutsk, and in 1617 In addition to Gregory himself, his successor as abbess, Hieromonk Isaakiy Boriskovich, several priests and secular persons, including Prince Fyodor Svyatopolk-Chetvertinsky, Mikhail Gulevich, the Lutsky court, Lavrenty Drevinsky, the cup of the land of Volyn, Vladimir Zubtsevsky, the mayor of Lutsk, signed up as members of this brotherhood. The reason for the establishment of the brotherhood was that during a strong fire that was in Lutsk, the Russian almshouse, or hospital, burned to the ground, and there was no place for the sick and poor of the Russian faith. The brotherhood was formed with the aim of rebuilding a Russian almshouse in Lutsk, and with it to build a church, both for the sick and the poor, and for all Orthodox, and a school for raising children. The king, at the request of the nobles of the Volyn province and the inhabitants of Lutsk, approved (February 20, 1619) ) the newly formed Russian \"brotherhood of mercy\" and allowed the brotherhood to build not only an almshouse, but also a church and a school, take care of them and freely support the clergy at the church. When the place for the proposed buildings in Lutsk was chosen by the brotherhood, the members of the brotherhood from the nobility, pointing out that they did not live permanently in the city, instructed their younger brothers - Lutsk burghers - to supervise the buildings and at the end of them to manage the church, school and hospital, and they themselves pledged to help these philistines in everything, intercede for them and protect them everywhere.\n\nPart 5. Funders\n\nEarly 17th century inscribed another famous name from the Gulevich family in the history of Western Russian lands.\n\nIn 1615, on October 15, Anna (Galshka) Gulevichevna, the wife of the marshal of the Mozyr povet, Stefan Lozka, appeared in the Zemstvo court of Kiev together with her husband and, with his permission, asked to write the following entry in the Zemstvo Kiev books: \"I, Anna Gulevichevna ... living constantly in the ancient Orthodox faith of the holy Eastern Church and burning with pious zeal for it, for the spread of the glory of God, one in the Trinity, out of love and devotion to my brethren, the Russian people, for a long time I thought to do good for the Church of God. I give the fulfillment to the faithful Christians of the Russian people, who are in the districts of the provinces of Kiev, Volyn and Bratslav, consisting of spiritual and secular estates, princes, nobles and everyone, no matter what rank they may be, but only invariably abiding in the Orthodox faith,under the blessing of the most holy Patriarch of Constantinople, for eternity I give, donate, record and refuse my own hereditary estate, enjoying the rights and liberties of the gentry: my court and land, received by me as an eternal gift from my husband and located in Kiev between famous streets, with all land and income belonging to that court ... And all this I assign to the monastery of the patriarchal stavropegic cenobitic, according to the order of Basil the Great, and to a school for children, both noble and petty-bourgeois, and to a hotel for spiritual wanderers of the faith of the Eastern Church, with so that that monastery, and the school, and the whole rite, be organized according to the law of the catholic Eastern Church ... And so that my real foundation would have its effect, I immediately brought spiritual and secular Orthodox into that courtyard with the land,it was the holy monk Isaiah Kopinski and other monastics who also introduced the school, transferring to them equally to all Orthodox, spiritual and secular, which I donate to the actual possession and management of the wagon and the nobles appointed for that ... 1615, the month of October, fourteenth day.\"\n\nThe wife of Mozyr marshal Stefan Lozka, Galshka (Alzhbeta, Gamika, Anna) Gulevichevna from Kiev, was the daughter of the already mentioned Vasily Fedorovich Gulevich - Zaturetsky and in her first marriage was married to Christopher Potiy, the son of the future Uniate metropolitan. Unlike the Poti family, which was dominated by Uniate sentiments, Galshka remained faithful to Orthodoxy. For this reason, she seriously quarreled with the relatives of her first husband. It is possible that the transfer of her own hereditary possession to an Orthodox monastery was conceived by Galshka Gulevichevna as a kind of compensation for the damage inflicted on the Orthodox people of Kiev by her father-in-law, Uniate Metropolitan Ipatiy, who seized a number of Orthodox churches in Kiev. The property transferred by Galshka was located in Kiev Podil - the center of concentration of Kyiv life of that era.\n\nThe motives for such an act of Gulevichevna have rather deep roots, connected not so much with the principled family tradition of the Orthodox Gulevichs, but with the general political situation that developed at a time when Russian Orthodox culture, under the pressure of the Roman Catholic authorities, began to give up its positions even in its own, it would seem, unshakable centers, which, of course, were the ancient Volyn land and, of course, the Kiev region, with the once capital city of all Old Russian lands. “The local Orthodox gentry, unorganized and flooded from the very beginning by the Polish gentry flood, already at first was knocked down from all positions, pushed aside and removed from everything so that only by adjusting to the dominant Polish element, and only by becoming Polonized and becoming Catholic could they achieve actual equality. By the beginning of the 16th century. everything that was outstanding, striving for power and importance among the local gentry of Galicia, Podolia, Kholmsky land - with a few exceptions - was already completely Polonized, and in the 16th century. the same thing begins to repeat itself in Volhynia and the Dnieper region, ”Mykhailo Grushetsky wrote in his History of Ukraine.\n\nThe upper strata of the local population understood that they could not resist the state machine of Catholicization, and even in Volhynia, in this nest of Orthodox aristocracy - princes and magnates, they began to quickly become Polonized, depriving the Orthodox Rusyns of the only class that could have at least some influence and significance in the existence of the Russian political nation within the Commonwealth. The same processes took place on the territory of the so-called White Rus', which completely bled and Polonized the Litvins - the once powerful local aristocracy. The peasantry, unable to take the place of the state-forming national force instead of the polonized gentry who left it, was forced to be content with that local national-social niche that subsequently, the Belarusian people - a people who, despite the processes of polonization on the one hand and Russification on the other, have retained and still retain the core of the Litvinian nation, the descendants of the GDL that has sunk into oblivion.\n\nSo in Volhynia, the former Orthodox lords quickly became Polonized, and the next generation even exposed them as direct enemies of Orthodoxy, which were the children of the zealots of the Orthodox faith themselves - the son of Kurbsky Dimitry, the son of Ostrozhsky Yanush. The sons of Konstantin-Vasily Ostrozhsky were already Catholics, only Alexander remained Orthodox, but he died during the life of his father, and the elder Janusz, who inherited the rich Ostroh estates along with the well-known Ostroh Orthodox school and printing house organized there, converted early to Catholicism - for which received the high position of the Krakow castellan. Janusz Ostrozhsky completely destroyed the activities of the Ostrog circle and its institutions, which fell into decay under him.\n\nAnd in Slutsk, in the lands of White Rus', with the death of the founder of the Slutsk Orthodox school, Prince Yuri Semenovich Slutsky (d. 1587), his possessions passed into the hands of his successors from among the Catholics, and all the beginnings of Orthodox educational work died. The children of magnates and wealthy gentry went to Catholic schools, especially to the Jesuits, who founded their schools in Vilna, Yaroslav, Lublin and other cities, where the young generation of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania flocked. In these schools, the Jesuits attracted children from the upper classes and raised them as zealous Catholics. Similar processes partly affected the gentry branches of the Gulevichs, subsequently absorbing into Catholicism almost all of their descendants who remained on the land of their ancestors, giving over time, by the way, true patriots of the Polish state.\n\n“Russian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) patriots watched this horrific decline of their nationality with fear,” Mikhailo Grushetsky wrote. Such losses forced the remaining Orthodox to unite their efforts in strengthening their nationality and faith, founding Orthodox brotherhoods, the main purpose of which was to enlighten, which was so necessary in this difficult period for Orthodox Rusyns. In addition to the oldest brotherhoods, Lvov and Vilna, brotherhoods arose in Przemysl, Slutsk, Minsk, Mogilev, Lutsk and other cities. Such associations of Orthodox tried to defend the Orthodox dioceses given by the central royal government to the supporters of the union.\n\nSince 1599, the Uniates were headed by the Metropolitan of Kiev Ipatiy Potiy (Potey), who, when he was bishop of Vladimir and Brest, became the main character in the Union with the Roman Catholic Church. Born in 1541 into an Orthodox family, the future father-in-law of Galshka Gulevichevna, Adam Lvovich Potiy, was educated at the Calvin College of the Princes Radziwills, higher education at the Krakow Academy. He served for a long time in the affairs of the Radziwill princes and at that time openly accepted Protestantism. Moving along the line of public service, he reached the rank of pan-radets, i.e. senator. He married the daughter of a prince, through which he became related to Prince. Konstantin-Vasily Ostrozhsky. Around 1574, apparently in an atmosphere of family kinship, he again accepted his natural Orthodoxy from the cradle. Then he was widowed, and at this time in 1588\n\nLutsk Roman Catholic Bishop Bernard Matsievsky wrote in 1588 to the papal nuncio in Poland, Archbishop Annibal: “In June, when I went to Podlyakhia, to the other half of my diocese, Patriarch Jeremiah of Constantinople was passing to Moscow there. In excess of my expectation, he very soon passed the city where I was. The falling night prevented me from overtaking him. And I hurried to Brest, where it seemed that he would stop. But even from there he left before my arrival. A few days later, Mr. Brest judge (Adam Potiy), although a schismatic, but by authority, education and experience, an outstanding person and in religious matters, apparently, the most knowledgeable among his own. After several conversations about religion with Fr. a Jesuit, Potius came to me more than once and with the greatest perseverance convinced me, that we, along with other Catholic theologian bishops, take care of the union of the Russians with the Roman Church, especially at the present time, when such an opportunity presents itself, which is unlikely to happen again. Potiy said that God's providence itself arranged so that the Patriarch of Tsaregrad arrived in our region. He added that more effort should be made in interviews with the Greeks than in publishing essays against Russians, or than in objections to Russians, such as are found in our sermons. If the patriarch agrees to a conversation and is defeated and convicted of error, then he is a judge (Potiy) and many others, distinguished by birth and virtues, desiring nothing more than that our conversation with the patriarch should take place in the spirit of love and meekness, not they will want to obey him more and follow his error. If he refuses to compete, then he will fall under the suspicion of a real schism and the sooner he will be abandoned by the Russians. The venerable husband also reported that he and his people would observe very carefully: whether the patriarch had arrived to rob his lords and priests, or to take care of the salvation of the souls entrusted to him. Believe that what we heard greatly comforted and encouraged us. And I am convinced that your Eminence will by no means miss this, such an opportunity to support our Russians in their jealousy, with which they are burning.\n\nSuspecting nothing, Adam Potiy's father-in-law, Prince Ostrozhsky, himself recommended him to the king as a brilliant candidate for the position of bishop after the death of Bishop Meletiy Khrebtovich. The Orthodox Bishop of Lutsk, Kirill Terletsky (another supporter of the union), tonsured Adam himself and named him Ipatiy. In 1593, King Sigismund III notified Prince Konstantin Ostrozhsky that he \"gave the dominion of Vladimir to the Brest castellan Adam Potey for his services to the king and the Commonwealth.\" A high educational qualification, fluency in Latin, family ties with noble families and a conscious plan for a union made Hypatius Potius a fatal figure for the Russian Orthodox Church, which was exhausted from above. So Hypatius Potius became the personal creator of the union.\n\nAfter the death of Patriarch Jeremiah of Constantinople, at the end of 1594, several higher exarchs of the Orthodox Church, including Bishop Ipatiy Potiy of Vladimir, Bishop Kirill Terletsky of Lutsk, Bishop of Turov Pelchitsky, Bishop Zborovsky of Kholm, as well as Bishop Gideon Balaban of Lviv and Metropolitan Mikhail Rogoza of Kiev made a declaration to the Pope and the King, in which they announced their decision to surrender themselves under the authority of the pope and bring the rest of the clergy and their Orthodox flock to this. At the end of 1595, Potius and Terletsky went to Rome and on December 23, at a solemn meeting in front of the entire papal court and cardinals, on behalf of all the bishops, they testified their submission and took an oath of allegiance to Pope Clement VIII and the Catholic Church .\n\nOn October 6, 1596, a unifying council was convened in Potiy's possessions in Brest to sign the Church Union. In the camp of opponents, Prince Konstantin-Vasil Ostrozhsky and his son Alexander, the bishops of Lvov Gedeon Balaban and Przemysl Kopystensky (originally among the supporters of the Union), many monastic clergy, gentry, representatives of fraternities and philistines who were unfavorable to reunification, such as the prince Yury Czartorysky and princes Olelkovichi (from Slutsk), or supporters of the Calvinist Radziwill. All of them, not wanting either to talk with the \"papezhniks\" or to take part in joint meetings, held their own Council in parallel in Brest under the leadership of a protosinkel who had come from Moldova Nicephorus, who called himself an authorized representative and deputy of the Patriarch of Constantinople. In the end, the Unia was accepted by: Metropolitan Mikhail Ragoza of Kiev, Bishop Ipatiy Potiy of Vladimir, Exarch Kirill Terletsky of Lutsk, Archbishop Hermogen of Polotsk, Bishop Ivan Gogol of Pinsk, Bishop Denis Zborovsky of Kholmsk, and, in addition, three archimandrites - Bratslav, Lavrishevsky and Minsk, a significant part of the diocesan clergy and gentry. The Latin Bishops Jan Solikowski, Bernard Maciejowski, StanisÅaw Gomolinsky were present as papal delegates, as well as the well-known Jesuit preacher Piotr Skarga, Justin Rab, Martin Lyaterna and Kasper Nehaj as theologians. In Vilna, the stavropegial Brotherhood came out with a condemnation of the Union, and with it the famous priests Vasily,\n\nDespite opposition to the union and mutual curses, the king strongly supported the Uniates.\n\nIpatiy Potiy became the Metropolitan of Kiev after the death of Mikhail Ragoza, who did not show much zeal for spreading the union (it was even said about him that he died of grief, because the Orthodox cursed him with betrayal). Potiy, on the other hand, was a talented preacher, polemicist, administrator, but in the struggle for union he acted mainly by force. A sharp reaction from the Orthodox was caused by Potii's attempts to prove that the Western Russian Church had always been Catholic, as well as his intention to transfer the ancient Orthodox shrines to the Uniates. Actually, this explains the fact that Ipatiy Potiy, having the title of Metropolitan of Kyiv, was forced to stay in Vilna. The Cossacks and the Orthodox nobility did not let him into Kyiv.\n\nAs Mikhailo Grushetsky wrote: “... The king with the local bishop Potius completely defeated the Berestey brotherhood. In Vilna, the center of Belarusian church and cultural life, by force, with the help of troops, churches were taken from the Orthodox - locks and doors were broken, and the churches were handed over to the Uniates. The king happened at this time in Vilna; Orthodox, surrounding him in the street, with their wives and children, fell on their knees before him, praying that their consciences would not be violated, that churches would not be taken away from them, but this did not stop the violence. It is noteworthy that one of these churches was located in the \"Rossa\" area, the Church of St. George, after which the Orthodox Russian Yuryevsky Brotherhood in Vilna was named. Even then there was a large tsmentar (cemetery), the Orthodox and “Russian part” of Vilnius was significantly erased in the minds of the people living there, mostly identifying themselves with the Polish nation or, simply, Tutai…\n\nWhen Metropolitan Potiy, encouraged by the defeat of the Orthodox Vilnius, tried to do the same in his other metropolitan capital, Kiev, and sent his viceroy there, the Cossack hetman Tiskinevich warned the latter not to take it into his head to force the local clergy into obedience, since in case of this he , hetman, has already given the order: this governor “wherever it happens, kill like a dog (1610).\n\nWhen the king wanted to take the Pechersk Lavra from the Orthodox Archimandrite Nicephorus of Tours, Konstantin-Vasil Ostrozhsky, being the Kyiv governor, did not react to the royal order in any way. And when the king sent his nobleman with an order to seize the Caves Monastery from Tur by force and hand it over to Metropolitan Potiy, Tur defended the monastery with weapons in his hands, and then, with various “Nalivaikas”, as the Uniates complained, defended the Pechersk estates with armed force.\n\nIn the same way, the Orthodox defended the Zhydychinsky Monastery, the most prominent among the Volyn monasteries.\n\nIpatiy Potiy died on July 18, 1613 and was buried, according to his will, in the Cathedral Church of the Assumption in Vladimir-Volynsky \"in front of the royal gates, between the pulpit and the door.\" From marriage he had three sons - Jan, Peter and Christopher. The younger Christopher Potey (d. before 1615) became the first husband of Galshka Gulevichivna (1575-1642), from whose marriage he had a daughter, Katerina Potiivna, wife of the Orsha cornet Mikola Mlechko. Galshka Gulevichevna and Christopher Potiy lived in the town of Nesvich, given to her by her father Vasily Gulevich.\n\nHalshka's second husband, Stefan Lozka, had a rich house with lands in Kiev, which Elizaveta Vasilievna, \"jealous of the Orthodox faith\", donated in 1615 \"to the monastery of the patriarchal stavropegy of a common life, according to the rank of Basil the Great\", to a school, as for children nobility, and petty-bourgeois, and a hotel for wanderers. The condition of this gift was that this place with its institutions should in no case leave Orthodox possession. Galshka left her descendants the right to take away from the brotherhood the place she had given, if by some means it passed into the hands of the non-Orthodox, and obliged them in such a case to separate another place on their own land for the same purpose. Having accepted such a generous donation from Gulevichevna, the Orthodox immediately formed a church brotherhood in Kiev \"with the blessing\", as they themselves say in their register, of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Timothy, in accordance with the charters of other brotherhoods, Lvov, Vilna, Mogilev, and kissing the cross \" each for all and all for everyone\", assumed the obligation to serve - to comfort and affirm in the faith the sons of Eastern Orthodoxy, the inhabitants of the Kiev voivodeship, to educate cherished disciples, both spiritual and secular, - to protect widows, orphans and to help all the poor people. This happened probably on January 4, 1616, or somewhat earlier, judging by a note made by one of the clergy who then entered the register of the new brotherhood. Brotherhood is in the church,\n\nIn 1620, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophan approved the charter of the brotherhood and blessed it so that this brotherhood with its church would be a patriarchal stauropegee, i.e. was not subject to any other spiritual authorities, except for the Patriarch of Constantinople. At the same time, at the request of the Volhynian nobles and petty bourgeois, the patriarch blessed the Exaltation of the Cross Church in Lutsk with the right of stavropegy, under which the Lutsk brotherhood with a school was founded, and the Patriarch of Constantinople Kirill Lukaris, for his part, gave a letter, which approved the statutes of the fraternal schools in Lutsk and Kiev.\n\nThis is how a monastery and a school got their start, the first of which was known as the Kiev Brotherhood School Epiphany Monastery, whose patron was a graduate of the Ostroh Schools, Hetman of the Registered Cossacks Pyotr Konashevich-Sagaydachny. He decorated the monastery with the magnificent Epiphany Cathedral (the construction of the temple was completed around 1620, later it was rebuilt at the expense of Hetman Mazepa; destroyed by decision of the Soviet authorities in 1935). But the school at the monastery was destined to develop into the famous Mohyla Collegium, and further - into the Kiev-Mohyla Academy. Galshka Gulevichevna herself, having returned at the end of her life to Lutsk, her native family, according to the testament of April 2, 1641, handed over to the local Orthodox brotherhood 200 gold for the fraternal church, the same amount for the fraternal monastery and 50 gold for the hospital attached to it.\n\nShe supported Galshka and the Chernchitsky nunnery, donating 30 gold pieces to it, and 10 gold pieces to the priests of the Chernchitsky and Prechistensky monasteries. Other Gulevichi were also noted for patronage in favor of Orthodox compatriots. So Galshka's cousin-niece, Anna Gulevicheva-Dolzhetskaya (her grandfather Janusz was the brother of Galshka's father, Vasily) also lived in Kiev, and donated to schools and monasteries, in particular to the St. Cyril Monastery (1629).\n\nA generous gift in the amount of 1 thousand gold pieces, provided by the town of Ivankov and neighboring villages in the Kiev province, was donated by Anna to the Orthodox Lutsk Brotherhood. Danilo Gulevich-Voyutinsky donated 300 gold coins to the brotherly church in the same Lutsk with a testament from 1642. Raina Gulevich-Drozdenskaya conveyed 50 gold coins to the priest of the Church of the Prechistenskaya in the town of Pavoloch (Podolsk Voivodeship) and 30 gold coins to the Pavoloch \"Russian\" hospital (testament dated 1617).
