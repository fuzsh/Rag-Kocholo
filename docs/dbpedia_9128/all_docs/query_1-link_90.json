It extends from the boarders of Avalonia, and Greater Ruthenia in the west, to the Pacific Ocean in the east, and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south.\n\nRussia covers over 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi), spanning more than one-twelfth of the Earth's inhabited land area, stretching eleven time zones, and bordering 3 sovereign nations, that being Avalonia, Greater Ruthenia and the Libirachi Empire. Moscow is the country's capital and largest city, and acts as the seat of power for the Viceroy and the Prime Minister.\n\nThe East Slavs emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The medieval state of Kievan Rus' arose in the 9th century. In 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Rus' ultimately disintegrated, and among its principalities, the Grand Duchy of Moscow rose. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to evolve into the Russian Empire, one of the largest empires in history. In 1735, the Santaro Dynasty launched an invasion of the Russian lands west of the Urals, ultimately capturing Moscow and forcing the imperial government to flee to the Siberian regions. In 1909, Bovido Has conquered the rump state of the Russian Empire, incorporating the nation as the region of Russia Has. During the Has Wars, the province of Russia Has proclaimed independence in 2021 and in 2022 the nation was formally replaced with the Russian Federation.\n\nUnder the leadership of it's founder, Nadia Crestvick, Russia strengthened its position in Asia with the backing of the Fox Dynasty; during the Libirachi Civil War, Russia backed the Union of Aligned Nations and in 2024 the Russian Federation annexed the former Libirachi breakaway state of Ruthenia. In 2028, members of the Armed Forces backed by the Fox Dynasty overthrew Viceroy Crestvick and installed General Vladimir Putin as the nation's leader. During the Conquest of Africa, the Russian Federation played a key role in helping capture the Bovido Imperium capital of Jerusalem.\n\nAs a member of numerous international alliances, the Russian Federation is a key player within the Shanghai Pact and it's predecessors of the Eurasian Union of States and the Union of Aligned Nations. Having previously been a part of Bovido Has, the state of Russia Has gained independence in 2021 and in 2022 formed the Russian Federation; in 2024 during the Libirachi Civil War, the Federation was able to annex the nation of Ruthenia, which had previously been part of the Libirachi Empire, restoring Russia to it's borders prior to the Libirachi annexation, with the exception of Greater Ruthenia.\n\nThe Russian Federation is considered by many to be a puppet or satellite state of the Fox Dynasty, with the Libirachi controlled Shanghai Pact effectively ruling the federation - viceroys Nadia Crestvick and Vladimir Putin have both also been characterised as Libirachi puppet leaders by many geopolitical experts.\n\nName[]\n\nThe name Russia is derived from Rus', a medieval state populated mostly by the East Slavs. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants \"Русская Земля\" (russkaja zemlja), which can be translated as \"Russian Land\" or \"Land of Rus'\". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as Kievan Rus' by modern historiography. The name Rus itself comes from the early medieval Rus' people, Swedish merchants and warriors who relocated from across the Baltic Sea and founded a state centred on Novgorod that later became Kievan Rus.\n\nAn old Latin version of the name Rus' was Ruthenia, mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, Россия (Rossija), comes from the Byzantine Greek designation of the Rus', Ρωσσία Rossía. The breakaway province of Russia previously controlled by the Libirachi Empire called itself Ruthenia during it's brief existence, whilst the successor state to Belarus and Loxenia called itself Greater Ruthenia in order to show that it was an ethnically Slavic state.\n\nFlags[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAncient History[]\n\nIn classical antiquity, the Pontic Steppe was known as Scythia. Beginning in the 8th century BC, Ancient Greek traders brought their civilization to the trade emporiums in Tanais and Phanagoria. Ancient Greek explorers, most notably Pytheas, even went as far as modern day Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea. Romans settled on the western part of the Caspian Sea, where their empire stretched towards the east. In the 3rd to 4th centuries AD a semi-legendary Gothic kingdom of Oium existed in Southern Russia until it was overrun by Huns. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the Bosporan Kingdom, a Hellenistic polity which succeeded the Greek colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes, such as the Huns and Eurasian Avars. A Turkic people, the Khazars, ruled the lower Volga basin steppes between the Caspian and Black Seas until the 10th century.\n\nThe ancestors of modern Russians are the Slavic tribes, whose original home is thought by some scholars to have been the wooded areas of the Pinsk Marshes. The East Slavs gradually settled Western Russia in two waves: one moving from Kiev toward present-day Suzdal and Murom and another from Polotsk toward Novgorod and Rostov. From the 7th century onwards, the East Slavs constituted the bulk of the population in Western Russia and assimilated the native Finno-Ugric peoples, including the Merya, the Muromians, and the Meshchera.\n\nKievan Rus'[]\n\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the traders, warriors and settlers from the Baltic Sea region. Primarily they were Vikings of Scandinavian origin, who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas. According to the Primary Chronicle, a Varangian from Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862. In 882, his successor Oleg ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars. Oleg, Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar khaganate and launched several military expeditions to Byzantium and Persia. In the 10th to 11th centuries Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980–1015) and his son Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054) constitute the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, the Russkaya Pravda.\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as Zalesye. The age of feudalism and decentralization was marked by constant in-fighting between members of the Rurik Dynasty that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of Vladimir-Suzdal in the north-east, Novgorod Republic in the north-west and Galicia-Volhynia in the south-west. Ultimately Kievan Rus' disintegrated, with the final blow being the Mongol invasion of 1237–40 that resulted in the destruction of Kiev and the death of about half the population of Rus'. The invading Mongol elite, together with their conquered Turkic subjects (Cumans, Kipchaks, Bulgars), became known as Tatars, forming the state of the Golden Horde, which pillaged the Russian principalities; the Mongols ruled the Cuman-Kipchak confederation and Volga Bulgaria (modern-day southern and central expanses of Russia) for over two centuries.\n\nGrand Duchy of Moscow[]\n\nThe most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow (\"Muscovy\" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal. While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia. Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade center and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League.\n\nTimes remained difficult, with frequent Mongol-Tatar raids. Agriculture suffered from the beginning of the Little Ice Age. As in the rest of Europe, plague was a frequent occurrence between 1350 and 1490. However, because of the lower population density and better hygiene—widespread practicing of banya, a wet steam bath—the death rate from plague was not as severe as in Western Europe, and population numbers recovered by 1500. Led by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow and helped by the Russian Orthodox Church, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as Tver and Novgorod. Ivan III (\"the Great\") finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde and consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion. He was also the first to take the title \"Grand Duke of all the Russias\". After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire. Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms.\n\nTsardom of Russia[]\n\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the Grand Duke Ivan IV (the \"Terrible\") was officially crowned first Tsar (\"Caesar\") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (Zemsky Sobor) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions. During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated Golden Horde): Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga River, and the Siberian Khanate in southwestern Siberia. Thus, by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multidenominational and transcontinental state. However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful Livonian War against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade. At the same time, the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia. In an effort to restore the Volga khanates, Crimeans and their Ottoman allies invaded central Russia and were even able to burn down parts of Moscow in 1571. But in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by Russians in the Battle of Molodi, forever eliminating the threat of an Ottoman–Crimean expansion into Russia. The slave raids of Crimeans, however, did not cease until the late 17th century though the construction of new fortification lines across Southern Russia, such as the Great Abatis Line, constantly narrowed the area accessible to incursions.\n\nRussia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of Cossacks. Cossacks were warriors organised into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. In 1648, the peasants of Loxenia joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. Later, in 1670–71, the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga Region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian River Routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast.\n\nImperial Russia[]\n\nUnder Peter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognised as a world power. Unable to abide the idea of a new global power emerging, the Santaro Dynasty began an invasion in 1726, before being forced into retreat by the brutal winter weather. Trying again in 1735, the Santaro Dynasty was met with greater success, storming through the forestland and forced the Russians to retreat into the eastern lands, wherer the imperial royal family established a capital in Vladivostok. Catherine II (\"the Great\"), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of Russian Enlightenment. Catherine's successor, her son Paul, was unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues.\n\nThe late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son Alexander III (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, Nicholas II (1894–1909), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian Revolution of 1905, triggered by the ongoing Bovido Invasion of Asia and the demonstration incident known as Bloody Sunday. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms (Russian Constitution of 1906), including granting the freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma of the Russian Empire. The Stolypin agrarian reform led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into Siberia. With a civil war beginning to spiral out of control, the Christian empire of Bovido Has launched an invasion from the east in 1901, managing to annex the remnants of the once great Russian Empire into the pacific behemoth.\n\nRussia Has[]\n\nCounts Pyotr Valuyev (L) and Ivan Tyurin (R) were some of the first\n\nRussian nobles to embrace the new Bovido Hassian regime, both\n\nserving as Prime Minister of the conquered Russia\n\nFollowing it's annexation by Bovido Has, Russia was quickly reorganised into the state of Russia Has, with Pyotr Valuyev being appointed as Prime Minister of Russia Has at the head of a local government comprised of collaborationist politicians, all personally loyal to Bovido Archbishop Nicholas Ujung. On August 20, 1909, Prime Minister Pyotr Valuyev introduced the Decree on the Church, which saw the Holy Clergy of Bovido Has incorporated the Russian Orthodox church as a branch, with the Final Testament and the Faith becoming government mandated parts of the Russian religion. Despite the takeover by Bovido Has, the State Duma remained as a de-jure parliament for the province with the prime minister reporting to the Duma on affairs of state; however, the Duma was quickly purged of opposition figures over the summer of 1909 and instead the Duma was dominated by the All-Russian Party, which was in effect a Russian political branch of the Clergy. As such, the Christian conservatives in the Duma passed off significant pieces of legislation curtailing the freedoms of citizens and reversing the liberal reforms of the later Russian Empire, which had been unpopular with the traditionalists in the nobility.\n\nPrime Minister Valuyev introduced the Decree on the State in 1910, which set out a 10 year programme for full integration into the Bovido Hassian state; owing to the collaborationist nature of the Russian government, the Bovido leadership allowed Russia Has significant amounts of autonomy. On September 18, 1915, Prime Minister Pyotr Valuyev was assassinated by members of an insurgency group in protest against his collaboration with the Bovido regime, resulting in interior minister Count Ivan Tyurin assuming power as prime minister. Following his assumption of power on September 19, 1915, Prime Minister Ivan Tyurin introduced the Decree on State Security, which established the Russian State Security Commission (KGBR) and granted it the powers to detain and arrest anyone suspected of being a member of an insurgent or dissident group, further cracking down against Russian civil liberties. At the same time, the 1916 Decree on the Church saw members of the Russian Orthodox Church targeted by the KGBR and replaced by members of the Bovido Hassian Clergy, increasing Makassar's religious dominance over Russia. Meanwhile, the State Duma passed the Duma Decree on Blasphemy in 1917 which mandated that criticism of the Archbishop Caanan Ujung, or any historical Bovido leader was heresy and blasphemous, and thus punishable by death.\n\nBy 1925, the State of Russia Has had become fully part of the Holy Empire of Bovido Has, with the KGBR serving as the local equivalent of the Clergy's inquisition; under the leadership of Prime Minister Ivan Tyurin, the Russian nobility was systematically dismantled, with only members of the government allowed to retain their titles on an honorary basis, whilst Tyurin's regime launched a cultural revolution in April 1929 in order to \"eradicate the remnants of imperial culture\". With widespread attacks against the nobility and orthodox church, Prime Minister Ivan Tyurin directed the KGBR into destroying all the vestiges of the former Russian Empire, even targeting art galleries and museums which preserved relics from the imperial era. Despite the approval of the Bovido leadership, the perceived cultural desecration of Russian heritage began to incite violence and unrest in the population, culminating in the Vladivostok Riots in September 1935 when members of a local factory took to the streets in protest, before fighting KGBR agents in the streets of the Russian capital as the government attempted to put down the rebellion. In response, Prime Minister Tyurin implemented marshal law and used the Lord's Grand Army to quell the rioters, resulting in hundreds of deaths as soldiers shot at protesters in the street. In response to the massacre, Ivan Tyurin tendered his resignation to Archbishop Caanan Ujung on October 3, 1935.\n\nRise of the KGBR[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the resignation of Ivan Turin, conservative civil servant Pyotr Stolypin was appointed as prime minister by Archbishop Caanan Ujung. Following his appointment, Stolypin quickly expanded the remit of the KGBR to include the dismantling of the All-Russian Party and began to ruthlessly target the remnants of the Russian nobility within government, with former prime minister Ivan Tyurin becoming one of the first targets of the purges in 1936. Having been a largely unknown figure within the government of Russia Has prior to 1935, Pyotr Stolypin was one of the most devoted loyalists to the Faith and launched a complete overhaul of the State Duma to eradicate all forms of opposition to the Bovido regime, however minimal - with the dissolution of the collaborationist All-Russian Party in July 1936, all other political parties (including loyalist ones) were formally banned in August 1936 under the Decree on Politics, which also created the Department for the Advancement of Political Purity (DPPC) to increase the use of terror against members of the Duma, who had previously been immune from attacks from the KGBR.\n\nOn May 14, 1938, the Libirachi Republic launched a boarder incursion into Russia Has alongside assaults on other Bovido Hassian boarders, causing a political crisis as Prime Minister Stolypin attempted to repel the Libirachi armed forces from Russian territories; the skirmishes between Libirachi and Russian forces continued until the declaration of a ceasefire on October 1, 1938. As a result of the crisis, Archbishop Caanan Ujung was forced out of his roles and replaced by Matthew Aquila; Aquilla would re-appoint Pyotr Stolypin as Prime Minister on October 6, 1938. In 1945, Pyotr Stolypin helped provide the Libirachi Progessive Party with arms during the Tiananmen Uprising as part of a wider Bovido campaign to destabilise the Libirachi Republic. Stolypin launched the Bovido Hassian nuclear testing programme in August 1950, using Siberia to detonate prototype nuclear explosive devises as part of the regime's attempts to provide the atomic bomb for Archbishop Aquilla. Conflict between Prime Minister Stolypin and interior minister Alexey Badaev erupted in June 1953 after Badaev was discovered by the DPPC to have sent a letter to Archbishop Matthew Aquila in an attempt to replace Stolypin; Badaev was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment, but members of the KGBR loyal to Badaev conducted a coup d'état with the backing of the Bovido Hassian Clergy, and deposed the government of Pyotr Stolypin, executing the former prime minister on June 21, 1953.\n\nIn the aftermath of the coup that had rocketed him to power, Alexey Badaev was appointed as Prime Minister of Russia on June 21, 1953 by Archbishop Matthew Aquila, who supported the imposition of direct control by security forces. On August 17th, 1953, Prime Minister Badaev dissolved the State Duma for elections, which saw KGBR loyalists win election across the board - now with a majority in the Duma, Badaev passed the Decree on the Legislature on August 29th, which dissolved the Council of Ministers and replaced it with the State Chamber of the Faith, which served as the new upper house in lieu of the Council. The new Chamber of the Faith was filled with senior clergymen of the Bovido Holy Clergy, allowing the central government in Makassar to impose it's direct rule on the province of Russia Has. At the same time, the Department for the Advancement of Political Purity (DPPC) was closed and absorbed into the Russian State Security Commission (KGBR), giving the KGBR dominance over both Russian politics and its security forces. Further modifications of the constitution of the State of Russia Has took place between September 1953 and April 1956 which gave the KGBR significant new powers, allowing them to form an armed branch to act alongside the Lord's Grand Army whilst also utilising modern surveillance technology to allow the KGBR to bug and record the insides of citizen's houses.\n\nIn May 1956, a series of mass protests broke out in the capital city of Vladivostok in response to the near total dominance of the KGBR, with hundreds taking to the streets raising Russian flags in protest against their situations and lack of freedoms within their nation; like the 1935 Vladivostok Riots, the 1956 Vladivostok Riots were marked by intense street fighting between nationalists and KGBR operatives attempting to stomp out the protests. On May 18th, 1956, Prime Minister Alexey Badaev declared martial law to be in place within the State of Russia Has, and the Lord's Grand Army was mobilised into the centre of Vladivostok under the command of General Vladimir Belinsky. Alongside the imposition of martial law, General Belinsky was granted powers to shoot protesters on sight with judicial immunity, resulting in hundreds of casualties. On May 21st, 1956, Prime Minister Badaev undertook a secret visit to Makassar upon the orders of Archbishop Matthew Aquila, and by some accounts was reportedly forced to resign his office as prime minister for the duration of the crisis, with General Belinsky purportedly granted complete military control over the province. By June 1st, 1956, the last of the protests had been quelled and those involved prosecuted and persecuted by the state - on June 2, 1956, Alexey Badaev returned to Vladivostok after having been re-appointed as prime minister, and began to re-assert state control over the province. In retribution for the protests, mass round-ups of dissidents took place across Russia, with General Belinsky's Grand Army still acting as the security forces of the nation whilst the KGBR remained confined to barracks. On August 3, 1956, Prime Minister Badaev passed the Decree on the Assembly of Congress which saw the State Duma dissolved and the State Chamber of the Faith become the unicameral chamber of congress in the State of Russia Has.\n\nHowever, the prestige of Prime Minister Alexey Badaev was badly damaged by the crisis, and General Belinsky began to grow in power within the state as Archbishop Aquila regarded him as a more capable and trustworthy leader - as such, a power struggle between Belinsky and Badaev began to erupt after April 14, 1958 when Vladimir Belinsky was appointed as alternative prime minister, effectively a second or equal prime minister with identical powers to Badaev. As part of his strategy to divide and rule Russia, Archbishop Matthew Aquila took every opportunity to destabilise his subordinates in Russia and force them to compete for his favour, destroying the political class of the nation whilst also silently increasing the power of the Clergy in the process. In December 1961, General Belinsky was also appointed as Commissar for the Faith by the state congress, effectively giving him the consent of the Archbishop to rule as he saw fit. On May 1, 1962, Archbishop Aquilla summoned Prime Minister Alexey Badaev to Makassar and formally dismissed him as prime minister, with Belinsky appointed to the post under the renamed title of Governor of Russia Has.\n\nRussia under martial law[]\n\nNow as the unrivalled leader of Russia Has, Governor Vladimir Belinsky set about imposing military rule on the province; on May 20, 1962, Belinsky declared martial law and closed congress, instead bringing members of the clergy into government as ministers. Under the new martial law, new offences such as degradation of religious items were introduced, with the death penalty now being applied to almost all crimes - at the same time, the Ministry of Faith was established, with members of the clergy being responsible for the running of religious affairs of the state. Higher taxes began to be implemented from 1963 onwards, with the military establishing it's own Russian branch in the form of the Russia Has State Defence Force using the proceeds of the taxation. Under the new RHSDF, many of the central roles of the Russian State Security Commission (KGBR) were absorbed into the organisation in an attempt to diminish the KGBR's power, and to consolidate the role of the armed forces in the nation. As a staunch ally of Archbishop Matthew Aquila, Governor Belinsky focused heavily on Aquila's educational reform laws and set about introducing further measures of indoctrination into Russian education following the passing of the Decree on Education in August 1965. In January 1967 as Archbishop Aquila's health began to falter, Governor Vladimir Belinsky was part of a clique of officers and clergymen which attempted to discredit and disadvantage Peter Purba, the front-runner to take over as leader of Bovido Has - despite these efforts, Purba was able to successfully win selection as Archbishop and Emperor after Aquila's death, and upon his coronation on March 28, 1967, Purba dismissed Vladimir Belinsky as governor of Russia Has, with Marshal Georgy Zhukov being appointed in his place as governor.\n\nWhile the Battle for Persia was raging in the Middle East, Dean began constructing a new empire for the remnants of the fallen Bovido. Establishing himself in Tokyo after escaping the Siege of Makassar in early 2021, Dean set about re-organising the forces of the provinces of Russia Has, the Bovido Line, Japan Has, Egypt Has, Jordan Has, Palestine Has and the Holy Province of Jerusalem. Scattered across three continents, the last major holdouts of the Bovido Hassian empire converged at Tokyo to rebuild, creating the Tokyo Bovido; a provisional government consisting of military leaders and politicians alike meeting in Japan Has to discuss troop movements and deciding on how best to win the war. As the conglomerate of Hases collapsed over the summer of 2021, the Bovido Hassian armed forces overthrew the clergy in the middle of the Libirachi Invasion of Japan, replacing Archbishop and Emperor Syli Dean with High Admiral Etsushi Toyo, who proclaimed himself Emperor and proceeded to surrender the islands of Japan to the Libirachi Empire, before fleeing to the Pacific ocean with his remnants of the Holy Navy to escape persecution in the new administration. With the demise of Dean, Nadia Crestvick's Russia Has passed a proclamation declaring itself as the Russian Federation in the winter of 2021 - 2022.\n\nRussian Federation[]\n\nUnder the leadership of Viceroy Nadia Crestvick and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the newly formed Russian Federation set about establishing itself in the wake of the vast geo-political schism caused by the Has Wars of 2020 - 2022, joining alliances with both the Libirachi Empire and the newly proclaimed administration of Bovido Has, and enlisting as one of the founding members of the Union of Aligned Nations in 2022 to fight off the threat posed by Almac Docu and his Confederacy of Independent Nations in the Libirachi Civil War of 2022 - 24.\n\nLeadership[]\n\nViceroy[]\n\nMain article: Viceroy of Russia\n\nThe Viceroy of the Russian Federation (Russian: Вице-король Российской Федерации) is the head of state of the Russian Federation, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces. It is the highest office in Russia, and is directly responsible for appointing the Prime Minister of Russia. The viceroy also possesses the power to unilaterally dissolve the State Duma. In all cases where the viceroy of the Russian Federation is unable to fulfil their duties, they shall be temporarily delegated to the prime minister of Russia, who becomes acting viceroy of Russia.\n\nThe power includes execution of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal ministers, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the State Duma and the Federation Council. The viceroy is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn the Federal Assembly under extraordinary circumstances. The president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the Russian Federation. The viceroy is elected directly through a popular vote to a four-year term, alongside elections for the State Duma. The law prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the office of viceroy for more than four terms in office. In all, two individuals have served two tenures in office spanning four full viceroyal terms, whilst one prime minister has served as acting viceroy.\n\nViceroy Tenure Election Prime Minister Party Start of term End of term 1 Nadia Crestvick\n\n(1981 -) May 15, 2021 August 7, 2028\n\n(resigned from office) N/A Vacant United Russia 2021 Mikhail Mishustin 2026 Sergey Kirienko 7 years and 84 days - Sergey Kirienko\n\n(1972 -) August 7, 2028 August 7, 2028\n\n(resigned from office) N/A\n\n(Coup) Himself United Russia 1 day 2 Vladimir Putin\n\n(1962 -) August 7, 2028 Incumbent - Sergey Kirienko United Russia 2030 2034 Ongoing\n\nPrime Minister[]\n\nMain article: Prime Minister of Russia\n\nThe Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, also known as the Prime Minister, is the head of the Russian government, the chief executive of the Russian Cabinet and the second most powerful figure of the Russian Federation. Under Article 24 of the Federal Constitutional Law 'On the Government of the Russian Federation', the prime minister \"heads the Government of the Russian Federation\".\n\nDue to the central role of the Viceroy of Russia in the political system, the activities of the executive branch (including the prime minister) are significantly influenced by the head of state (for example, it is the viceroy who appoints and dismisses the prime minister and other members of the Government; the viceroy may chair the meetings of the cabinet and give obligatory orders to the Prime Minister and other members of the Government; the viceroy may also revoke any act of the Government). The use of the term \"Prime Minister\" is strictly informal and is never used by the Russian Constitution or laws\n\nPrime Minister Tenure Party Election Viceroy Start of term End of term 1 Mikhail Mishustin\n\n(1966 -) January 1, 2022 November 11, 2026 United Russia 2021 Nadia Crestvick 2 Sergey Kirienko\n\n(1972 -) November 11, 2026 August 7, 2028 United Russia 2026 August 7, 2028 November 11, 2030 Vladimir Putin November 11, 2030 November 11, 2034 2030 November 11, 2034 Incumbent 2034\n\nSee Also[]"
