Sintra is the capital and largest city by population.\n\nFeluga is one of the oldest continuously existing nation state on the Amutian subcontinent, its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. It was inhabited by pre-Geltic and Geltic peoples who had contact with Laimiaic traders, it was ruled by the Aroman, followed by the invasions of Qubdi who eventually were expelled.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Feluga experienced a dark period during the Gran Viatge.

Feluga is part of several international and intergovernmental institutions, including the Assembled Nations.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word Feluga derives from the Aroman-Geltic place name Veloca; a city where present-day Veloz and Morisca. The Aroman took over the basecamp of the Velones and named it to Veloca to simplify Velones Loca (literally means the Velones’ dwelling place).\n\nGeography\n\n[WIP] Landscape. Climate.
