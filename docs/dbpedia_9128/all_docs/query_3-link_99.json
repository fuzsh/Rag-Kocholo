I was in graduate school at the University of Dnipropetrovsk, and my undergraduate adviser, Iurii Mytsyk, showed up on my doorstep with two books in his bag. One of them was a pre1917 edition of Mykhailo Hrushevsky’s Illustrated History of Ukraine, and the other was Mykola Zerov’s Lectures on the History of Ukrainian Literature, published in 1977 by the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. My guest had reason to believe that he was under investigation by the authorities for anti-Stalinist remarks that he had made at a private meeting. He was expecting a search of his apartment and wanted to get rid of the compromising publications in his home library. I agreed to take both books for safekeeping. I had read Hrushevsky before in the special collections of the Moscow, Kyiv, and Lviv libraries, but this was my first opportunity not merely to gulp down excerpts in the course of short research trips, but to read a whole book carefully at home, thinking about what I was reading. Hrushevsky’s book struck me as a revelation about the Ukrainian past – a truth hidden from us by official Soviet historiography and the regime that it supported. It was my first encounter with an alternative account of East Slavic history, one that went far beyond the class-struggle-driven and Russocentric narrative of Soviet historiography. Its scholarly appeal and the fact that it was prohibited in the USSR made it especially attractive in my eyes. From that point on, I knew what the history of Ukraine was and how the Soviet version had to be reconstructed to meet the demands of historical scholarship. In the early 1990s, when the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies,\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nthe publisher of the second ‘prohibited’ book brought to me by my former professor, invited me to participate in the Hrushevsky Translation Project undertaken by its Peter Jacyk Centre, I was given the opportunity to become much more intimately acquainted with Hrushevsky and his work and to fully appreciate his talent as a historian. My work on the project – an English translation of Hrushevsky’s ten-volume History of Ukraine-Rus’ – also gave me ample opportunity to put the historical narrative that had so impressed me in the early 1980s into a much broader context, comparing it not only with the anemic Soviet narrative of the USSR’s last decade of existence but also with a number of other narratives with which it had interacted and competed. In the process, I lost my earlier belief that I knew what the history of Ukraine was supposed to be, but maintained my admiration for Hrushevsky and the historiographic revolution or paradigm shift that he accomplished through his writings. The actual text of this book grew out of my work on the Hrushevsky Translation Project. Thus, my thanks go to Professor Mytsyk in the first instance for entrusting me with one of his prohibited bibliographic treasures. I am also grateful to those with whom I have been working at the Peter Jacyk Centre. In my work on this project, I have benefited greatly from their support and expertise. I particularly appreciate the advice offered me by the director of the Centre, Frank Sysyn, and the cooperation of the managing editor of the Hrushevsky Translation Project, Uliana Pasicznyk. My special thanks go to the senior editor of the project, Myroslav Yurkevich, who edited the original text of my book and helped me handle numerous editorial and bibliographic problems. Without his help, support, and encouragement, this book probably would still be in the making. In the course of my work on the manuscript, I benefited greatly from discussions with my colleagues at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies and the Department of History and Classics at the University of Alberta. Zenon Kohut read the text and strongly supported the project from the very beginning. John-Paul Himka offered advice on improving the manuscript, while Bohdan Klid and Andriy Zayarnyuk shared their insights into East European social and intellectual history. I would also like to thank Peter Matilainen, who, as always, was very helpful in dealing with computer glitches, viruses, and the author’s inability to grasp some basic principles of the cybernetic work ethic. My stay at the Ukrainian Research Institute of Harvard University in the spring semester of 2002 as Petro Jacyk Distinguished Fellow al-\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nlowed me not only to complete the first draft of the manuscript but also to benefit from the expertise and advice of Roman Szporluk, Lubomyr Hajda, and the Eugene and Daymel Shklar fellows at the Institute, Volodymyr Kulyk and Olia Hnatiuk. During my tenure as visiting professor at the Department of History of Harvard University in the spring of 2003, I had very helpful discussions on the content of my book with Terry Martin, David Brandenberger, Eric Lohr, and Kathleen McDermott. I am also thankful for the support and encouragement given to me by Dr Roman Procyk. Hiroaki Kuromiya read the manuscript and offered useful advice on improving it. Special thanks are due to Lubomyr Wynar for his help in acquiring unpublished materials, as well as to colleagues in Ukraine who shared their knowledge of Ukrainian and Russian history and historiography. I would like to thank Oleksii Tolochko, Natalia Iakovenko, and Vladyslav Verstiuk for their advice. I learned much from my discussions with Ukraine’s leading experts on Hrushevsky – Ruslan Pyrih, Iurii Shapoval, Vasyl Ulianovsky, and Ihor Hyrych – as well as with the intellectual leaders and organizers of impressive conferences on Hrushevsky and his historiographic legacy, Iaroslav Dashkevych and Iaroslav Hrytsak. My special thanks go to Hennadii Boriak, Liudmyla Demchenko, and Halyna Svarnyk for their help in gaining access to archival materials in Kyiv and Lviv. A grant from the Peter Jacyk Centre helped cover expenses related to bibliographic research and editing of the volume, while the Jaroslawa Demianchuk-Paclavsky Exchange Fellowship awarded to me by the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, as well as a grant from the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, were instrumental in helping me finish the project. I am also grateful to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for a publication grant and for financial support for the publication of this book from the Ukrainian Studies Fund Inc. (New York). At the University of Toronto Press, my thanks go to Suzanne Rancourt, Barbara Porter, and Miriam Skey for their advice and assistance. Last but not least, I would like to thank my wife, Olena, who not only encouraged me to undertake the writing of the book and put up with my research trips to Ukraine and long stays at Harvard, taking care of our two teenage children, but also brought order to my chaotic filing system – not the least important prerequisite for writing a scholarly work. My research and writing of this book led me to contemplate not only the historical analyses produced by the scholars I discuss but also the\n\nxii Preface\n\nterrible price that many of them were forced to pay for their loyalty to their political beliefs and the conscientious practice of their profession. The book’s protagonist, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, who was arrested in 1931 and exiled from Ukraine, died under suspicious circumstances in 1934. His daughter, Kateryna Hrushevska, a historical anthropologist, was arrested in 1938 and perished in the GULAG during the Second World War. Hrushevsky’s younger brother, the historian Oleksander Hrushevsky, was arrested in 1938 and died in the spring of 1943 while in exile in Kazakhstan. His nephew Serhii Shamrai, also a historian, was arrested twice, in 1933 and 1937, and died in the GULAG in 1939. Their fate was shared by many other historians in the USSR – people of various nationalities – who had their lives and careers destroyed by Stalin’s terror machine. I dedicate this book to their memory.\n\nReproduced from Mykhailo Hrushevsky, History of Ukraine-Rus’, vol. 1 (Edmonton and Toronto, 1997), by permission.\n\n1.

If the authors of the eleventh edition claimed that ‘the history of Kiev cannot be satisfactorily separated from that of Russia’ and presented it as the seat of the first Christian church, school, and library in Russia, the authors of the fifteenth edition treated it as the capital of Kyivan Rus’, which was defined as the first East Slavic state.3 Behind the terminological change adopted by the editors of the Britannica, who replaced the words ‘Russia’ and ‘Russian’ with ‘Rus’,’ ‘East Slavic,’ and ‘Ukrainian,’ lies the major geopolitical and cultural shift that took place in Eastern Europe in the course of the socalled short twentieth century (1914–91).4 The editorial changes also reflected a major paradigm shift in the sphere of East European historiography – a change closely associated with the geopolitical shift in that part of the world. The present work is primarily concerned with this historiographic transformation. The specific paradigm of Russian history that was profoundly restructured in the course of the ‘short twentieth century’ was a product of imperial Russian historiography. Imperial Russia, as distinct from Muscovite Russia before it and Soviet Russia after it, had an established view of itself as a tripartite nation. For a long time the Russian imperial elites officially maintained that the Russian nation consisted of three\n\n4 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\nbranches: Great Russian, Little Russian (Ukrainian), and White Russian (Belarusian). That view, which came into existence in the aftermath of the Muscovite government’s occupation of the eastern Ukrainian and eastern Belarusian territories in the second half of the seventeenth century, expired (on the official level, at least) with the collapse of the Romanov regime in the flames of the 1917 revolution. The rise of independent states on the territory of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus spelled the end of imperial Russia and undermined its concept of a tripartite Russian nation. The dismantling of the institutional, intellectual, and spiritual heritage of the empire did not begin or end with the Bolshevik victory of 1917. Its demise resulted from the failure of the pan-Russian project of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which sought to establish a modern Russian nation on the basis of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian ethnic groups (nationalities). The failure of the imperial Russian state to assimilate the Ukrainian peasantry to the Russian nationality was closely related to the development of the Ukrainian nationalizing project, which succeeded in turning most Little Russian peasants into Ukrainians in the course of the revolution and immediately after it. The Belarusians followed suit, reducing the builders of the modern Russian nation to little more than their Great Russian core. The imperial Russian authorities, who realized relatively early the danger of a split in the ‘Russian nationality,’ strove to prevent the development of the Ukrainian movement. Twice in the second half of the nineteenth century they attempted to stop the spread of ‘subversive’ ideas in Little/Southern/Southwestern Russia, as the Ukrainian provinces of the empire were known at the time, by prohibiting Ukrainian-language publications. These measures proved futile. Efforts to accomplish the linguistic Russification of the Ukrainian peasantry through the educational system were quite weak, lacking both resources and consistency on the part of the government; moreover, the official campaign against the much more obvious danger, that of Polish influence in central and western Ukraine, required the assistance of the Ukrainophile intelligentsia and thus had the ultimate effect of strengthening the Ukrainian movement in those regions.5 When pressure on Ukrainian activists in Russian-ruled Ukraine became too strong to withstand, they crossed the border into neighbouring Austria-Hungary, where the Habsburg regime was much more tolerant of the nation-building efforts of the local Ruthenians, as the ethnic Ukrainian population of the region was known at the time. In the late\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nnineteenth century, the Ruthenian intellectuals of Galicia and many of their compatriots in Bukovyna, not unlike their counterparts in Dnipro Ukraine, were torn between two competing nationalizing projects, Russian and Ukrainian. Ironically, the prohibitions imposed on Ukrainianlanguage publications in the Russian Empire resulted in the transfer of Ukrainophile nation-building initiatives to Galicia, which helped local Ukrainophiles defeat the Russophile (Muscophile) nationalizing project in the Habsburg realm. Galicia became a veritable Piedmont of Ukrainianism, preparing the ground for the rapid expansion of the Ukrainian project in the Russian Empire during and after the Revolution of 1905. The Russian imperial government’s exclusive reliance on repressive methods clearly backfired.6 The failure of the pan-Russian enterprise, like the collapse of any other imperial project, was closely associated with the dismantling or deconstruction of its historical narrative. Neither process took place overnight. In the case of the Russian imperial narrative, its disintegration began with the penetration of romanticism and populist ideology into the realm of historiography and acquired a new dynamic in the 1890s, given the growing dissatisfaction with the legacy of the ‘statist’ school in Russian historiography and its subsequent revision. This process reached its nadir at the turn of the 1930s, before the Stalin-era attempts to reassemble the Russian historical narrative under the rubric ‘History of the Peoples of the USSR.’ The forty-year period from the early 1890s to the mid-1930s also proved crucial for the fate of the Ukrainian national narrative. The formulation of the new historical paradigm, which brought about the ‘nationalization’ of the Ukrainian past and established Ukrainian history as a separate field of study, provided the young nation with a birth certificate and curriculum vitae sufficiently respectable to support an application for membership in the exclusive club of modern European nations. Not surprisingly, the delimitation of the past between Russia and Ukraine turned into a process involving numerous encounters, conflicts, and negotiations between individual historians and entire historiographic schools throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.7 No historian was more intimately involved in that process or played a more prominent role in the demise of the old imperial Russian narrative and the forging of the new Ukrainian paradigm than Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866–1934). Hrushevsky was one of the most eminent figures of the Ukrainian national movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He took an active part in the work of Ukrain-\n\n6 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\nian scholarly, cultural, and political organizations, becoming the first head of the independent Ukrainian state in 1918. Hrushevsky received his graduate degree in history from Kyiv University. His professor there was Volodymyr Antonovych, a well-known historian and founder of the Ukrainian ‘documentary school,’ and his field of specialization was Ukrainian history of the medieval and early modern periods. Upon graduation, Hrushevsky accepted a position at Lviv University, where he taught Ukrainian history from 1894 until the outbreak of the First World War. He served as president of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv, headed the Ukrainian Scientific Society in Kyiv, presided over the Historical ‘Institutions’ of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and held its Chair of Modern Ukrainian History. Hrushevsky was persecuted both by the tsarist regime and by the Soviet authorities. In the early 1930s Hrushevsky was arrested by the Soviet secret police and released, only to die under suspicious circumstances in 1934, effectively becoming a martyr for the Ukrainian cause.8 If one were to apply Miroslav Hroch’s periodization of national movements to Ukraine, it would become apparent that Hrushevsky was a leading figure of the Ukrainian movement in all three stages of its development.9 As the greatest Ukrainian national historian and a prominent political activist, he played a leading role in stages A (scholarly interest), B (patriotic agitation), and C (the rise of a mass movement), partly because those stages overlapped and varied in different parts of Ukraine. In a fascinating way, Hrushevsky’s life brought together a number of very different periods and trends of the Ukrainian national revival. It encompassed the cultural and political struggles of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Lviv and those of prerevolutionary and revolutionary Kyiv, the life of émigré circles of the 1920s, and cultural and political developments in Kyiv and Kharkiv during the first decades of Soviet rule. Hrushevsky was a major figure on the Ukrainian cultural and political scene in all those centres throughout the period, and one could hardly overestimate his role in shaping the modern Ukrainian nation and its view of itself, of its past and future. Hrushevsky’s major scholarly work, which preoccupied him throughout his life, was the History of Ukraine-Rus’, his ten-volume magnum opus published in Lviv and Kyiv between 1898 and 1936.10 It covers its subject from ancient times to the mid-seventeenth century and is widely regarded as the major achievement of modern Ukrainian historiography. The History was impressive proof of the maturity of Ukrainian scholarship; it was also a major cultural and political state-\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nment strengthening Ukraine’s claim to national distinctiveness and ultimately supporting the cause of its political independence.11 This book examines the dismantling or deconstruction of the Russian imperial narrative, and construction of the Ukrainian one, as fundamental elements in the unmaking of Russian imperial identity and the creation of Ukrainian national consciousness. Approaching these problems through the life and writings of Mykhailo Hrushevsky, I do not limit myself to analysing the role of the historian as nation-builder by tracing his involvement in the political transformations of the period, but go on to examine how particular historiographic concepts suggested and promoted by Hrushevsky were related to the formation of the new national identity.12 It would be difficult, if not impossible, to overestimate the role of history in the formation, maintenance, and subsequent disintegration of national identity. Every nation has its ‘story,’ and agreeing on that story is essential to becoming and remaining a nation. The modern era became a golden age of history by dramatically increasing the demand for ‘stories,’ which were sought after not only by monarchs, their courtiers, and diplomats of premodern times, but also by incomparably larger numbers of nation-builders, state elites, and citizens. History, dressed in national costume and divided as a scholarly discipline along national lines, not only provided nations with their own exclusive ‘stories’ but also gave much-needed legitimacy to their existence.13 In dealing with the widely discussed and highly challenging topic of the construction of national identities, my study takes as its point of departure Benedict Anderson’s maxim that modern nations are in fact imagined communities.14 I treat the deconstruction of imperial identities and their replacement with new national ones in the context of the paradigm of the ‘making, unmaking and remaking’ of nations, originally suggested by Roman Szporluk as an approach to the interpretation of Ukrainian history.15 I extend his maxim that ‘one nation’s fall is another nation’s rise’ to the realm of imperial and national identities and historical narratives. As the foregoing discussion indicates, my approach to the interrelation of history and nation-building is based on the assumption, broadly accepted in contemporary scholarship, that the development of national identity requires the construction of a coherent historical narrative. My other key assumption is that the ‘othering’ of ethnic groups (often dominant ones), in opposition to which the new identity is constructed or reconstructed, plays a major role in the formation of national grand narratives.16\n\n8 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\nFor the purposes of this study, I treat the historical narrative as an intellectual framework that serves, according to Alun Munslow’s definition, as ‘the primary vehicle for the transmission, and arguably the constitution, of historical understanding.’17 In this book I discuss a number of historical narratives that belong to two major categories, imperial and national. The Soviet historical narrative is in a class by itself, for at different stages of its development it included numerous elements of both the above-mentioned narratives in varying proportions. For present purposes, I regard every historical narrative as a product of a number of different discourses, which I treat in the broadest terms – again, in accordance with one of Munslow’s definitions – as a ‘shared language terrain.’18 The interrelations between the dominant and oppressed/alternative discourses in the Russian Empire and later in the Soviet Union are treated here as a process of negotiation through which the creation, maintenance, and deconstruction of different historical narratives took place.19 In my analysis of the decline of the Russian imperial narrative and the emergence of the Ukrainian one, I distinguish Russo-Ukrainian relations in the sphere of culture and identity from Russia’s relations with the non-Slavic nations of the empire in those same spheres. It is the first set of relations that I discuss in this book, and my treatment of the crisis of Russian imperial narrative is related first and foremost to the failed imperial project of creating one modern nation on the basis of the three East Slavic peoples of the empire. I treat Russia’s relations with the non-Slavic nations of the former empire only in the course of discussing the Soviet historical narrative, which sought to establish a common historical identity for both the Slavic and the non-Slavic peoples of the former Romanov realm – a project all but ignored by Russian imperial historiography. Thus, when I write about Russian imperial historiography and the Russian imperial narrative, what I mean is the dominant historical narrative of the Russian Empire, not a narrative centred on Russia’s relations with the subject peoples of the empire. The latter simply did not exist, for Russian historiography of the time all but ignored the historical experience of the non-Russians, treating the whole empire as a Russian nation-state. As Andreas Kappeler has correctly noted, ‘the Great Russian historians of the nineteenth century, Karamzin, Soloviev, Kliuchevsky and Platonov, wrote national history, like the majority of historians in other countries.’20 My interpretation of the Russo-Ukrainian historiographic encounter of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in terms of the interrelation\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nbetween different historical narratives builds on research undertaken in the last decade by Stephen Velychenko, Zenon Kohut, David Brandenberger, and Serhy Yekelchyk.21 A distinguishing feature of my approach is that I begin the ascent to the heights of the historical grand narrative from the level of the individual author, examining in depth how those narratives interacted in the writings of Mykhailo Hrushevsky, by far the most important actor in the whole process. In taking a close look at Hrushevsky and his role in the restructuring of East European historiography, I have been helped enormously by the recent boom in research on Hrushevsky and his legacy. The boom began in the 1960s in North America, where Ukraïns’kyi istoryk (The Ukrainian Historian, published in Munich and New York), the official organ of the Ukrainian Historical Association, emerged as one of the main vehicles for the popularization of Hrushevsky and his ideas. Its editor, Lubomyr Wynar (Liubomyr Vynar), became a leading specialist on Hrushevsky, producing dozens of studies on the life and legacy of the great master and promoting research on Hrushevsky as a distinct field of historical study. The late 1980s saw the publication of the first English-language scholarly biography of Hrushevsky by Thomas Prymak.22 The English translation of Hrushevsky’s ten-volume History of Ukraine-Rus’ was a project that the Ukrainian community in North America conceived in the 1960s and began to realize in the 1990s with the publication of its first volumes by the Peter Jacyk Centre for Ukrainian Historical Research at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta.23 The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in August of that year made Hrushevsky one of the major heroes of the new Ukrainian state. A great historian, a socialist politician, and head of the first Ukrainian parliament who was also rightly perceived as a victim of Stalinism, Hrushevsky was an ideal father figure for the builders of the new Ukraine. Although his legacy was interpreted in different ways, it was embraced by all Ukraine’s major political forces, from the nationalists and national democrats on the right to the slightly reformed communists on the left. The ruling elite contributed to the veneration of Hrushevsky by treating him as the first president of Ukraine, although in reality he was president of the Central Rada.24 Monuments to Hrushevsky were erected in the major cities of Ukraine. Academic institutes vied with one another for the right to bear his name, and streets were renamed in his honour: thus, both the parliament and the government of Ukraine are currently located on Hrushevsky Street in downtown Kyiv.25\n\n10 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\nHrushevsky’s transformation from prohibited author to national hero generated enormous interest in the man and his work in Ukraine’s postSoviet academic community. The ten-volume History of Ukraine-Rus’ was reissued in Kyiv, with the print runs of some volumes reaching 100,000 copies.26 The publication of Hrushevsky’s collected works in fifty volumes has recently begun in Ukraine,27 while Hrushevsky’s previously inaccessible diaries and memoirs have been published by Serhii Bilokin, Leonid Zashkilniak, and Ihor Hyrych.28 A number of monographs and hundreds of articles dealing with Hrushevsky and his writings have been published in Ukraine in recent years.29 Special library collections in which Hrushevsky’s works were concealed during the Soviet regime are now open to the public. The same is true of formerly closed archival collections containing numerous sources on Hrushevsky’s life and career, especially in Soviet Ukraine during the 1920s. A number of books based on previously inaccessible archival materials were published in Ukraine in the 1990s. Among the most important is a book by Ruslan Pyrih that draws mainly on Communist Party archives.30 Pavlo Sokhan, Vasyl Ulianovsky, and Serhii Kirzhaev, and recently Oksana Iurkova have researched Hrushevsky’s work in the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, mainly on the basis of that institution’s archival collections.31 Thanks to the efforts of Iurii Shapoval and Volodymyr Prystaiko, partial access was obtained to the former KGB archives, with the subsequent publication of archival materials pertaining to the secret police surveillance and persecution of Hrushevsky. Today Hrushevsky is probably the only person investigated by the Soviet secret police whose GPU/NKVD special file (deloformuliar) has been studied by historians and partly published.32 In the last several years a number of interpretative studies of Hrushevsky’s historical views have been added to the already impressive body of Ukrainian Hrushevskiana. These include the historiographic studies of Vitalii Telvak and Vitalii Masnenko,33 as well as an in-depth analysis of Hrushevsky’s writings based on the application of postmodern approaches by Volodymyr Vashchenko.34 The opening of the archives in the early 1990s and the research conducted by Ukrainian scholars over the past decade has contributed immensely to our understanding of Hrushevsky himself and the multiple contexts in which he acted during the last decade of his life. In researching the development of relations between the Russian and Ukrainian historical narratives, I often had to cross the boundaries that divide the contemporary historiographic map of Eastern Europe, where\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nthe old-fashioned approach based on empires and states still holds its ground against the aggressive advance of the national paradigm. I studied subjects and topics defined by that map as belonging to the realm of Russian imperial history, the chronicles of the Habsburg Monarchy, the annals of the Russian Revolution and, finally, the records of the Soviet Union. In a number of ways, this book deals with all the above subdivisions of East European and Eurasian history, while also touching on a variety of topics in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish, and Austrian history. Studying the career and activities of Mykhailo Hrushevsky helped me bring together all these realms and periods, which are now compartmentalized by modern historical scholarship. This study of Hrushevsky’s intellectual biography and scholarly activities thus affords unique insight into the encounter between Russian and Ukrainian historiography and identity at a crucial juncture in their development. It also touches upon a number of other historiographically important topics, and I hope it contributes to the better understanding of historiographic problems related to those topics. The major themes discussed in this book include the disintegration of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires – a process to which Hrushevsky contributed immensely through his scholarly and political work. Another subject of my study is the history of the Russian and Ukrainian revolutions, in which Hrushevsky played a major role as head of the first autonomous and then independent Ukrainian state in 1917–18. The cultural revolution in the USSR and the role of academics and academies of sciences in that process is another important subject treated in this study. No less important as a field of research has been the history of the USSR as a multinational state and the role of the Soviet policy of korenizatsiia (and, in the case of Ukraine, of linguistic and cultural Ukrainization) in the shaping of Soviet-era institutions and identities. All these major topics of East European history of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries figure in one way or another in the present work. In my research on Hrushevsky’s role in the construction of Ukrainian historical identity, I was often haunted by the ‘accursed’ question of modern historiography: to what degree was my protagonist biased in his interpretation of history, and what was the relationship between evidence and paradigm in his historiographic construction? Ever since the early twentieth-century rejection of the Rankean view of historical writing as a discipline that could describe the past as it actually happened, debates between proponents of history as a science and their\n\n12 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\n‘relativist’ opponents have shaken the historical profession.35 That debate was given new impetus by the advent of postmodernism, which prompted traditionalist historians to try to prevent history from being ‘killed’ by the new methods.36 In the present work, which is influenced to some degree by postmodern approaches (as the description of my research methods makes apparent), I often interrogate my sources by posing the ‘accursed’ question, seeking to determine to what degree Hrushevsky’s interpretation of history was driven by his nation-building agenda as opposed to a ‘scientific’ study of sources. My answers, which vary from one case to another, are presented in the text, but my work on this project has strengthened my original belief that, although influenced and often driven by a very specific nation-building agenda, Hrushevsky made an enormous contribution to the expansion and deepening of our knowledge about the history of Eastern Europe. ‘Getting history wrong is an essential factor in the formation of a nation,’ wrote Ernest Renan,37 basing this observation on his analysis of the nation-building experience in nineteenth-century Europe. Contrary to Renan’s statement, the national historians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries generally believed that they were finally putting things right and returning the histories of their peoples, usurped by oppressive states and dominant nations, to their rightful owners – nations awakened from long intellectual slumber. The national historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, unlike their postmodern successors, were convinced of their ability to uncover the truth about the past.38 As Anthony Smith has argued, national historians were generally faced with a twofold task: to endow their emerging nations with ancient and glorious histories, thereby justifying claims to autonomous or independent political existence; and to present those histories in a scholarly manner so that they might be properly recognized by neighbouring nations.39 In pursuing the latter task, these historians contributed tremendously to the development of historiography as a scholarly discipline. As Hrushevsky’s example attests, the deconstruction of imperial narratives and the promotion of national ones in the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries not only extended our knowledge of subjects traditionally at the centre of attention of imperial historiographies but also helped change the field in qualitative terms. The advent of national historiographies dominated (as in Eastern Europe) by imperial paradigms helped shift the attention of historians and societies alike from political to social history; from dynasties and states to peoples; from elites to masses; from ruling\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nnations to submerged ones, thereby contributing to the development of the type of historical vision that we share today. In conclusion, a few words about the chronological framework and structure of this book. It covers the period from 1890, when Hrushevsky published his first scholarly work, to 1934, the year of his death. This period coincides with an all-important stage in the development of Russo-Ukrainian relations in general and their historiographic dialogue in particular. The 1890s saw the rise of the concept of Ukrainian political independence. That was also the period in which Russian imperial historiography faced an ever more insistent challenge from representatives of national and Marxist historiographies. The year 1934 was in many respects a turning point in Soviet history. In the political sphere, it marked the end of a period of relative pluralism in the Soviet political system and inaugurated the era of Stalin’s despotic rule, as the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December of that year opened the door to a campaign of mass terror. The same year witnessed a major turn in the development of Soviet historiography, which was supposed to follow the new guidelines set forth by the supreme party leadership represented by Joseph Stalin, Andrei Zhdanov, and the soon to be assassinated Kirov.40 The period of autonomous (if not completely independent) development of national historiographies was effectively over, and their amalgamation into the Russocentric ‘history of the USSR’ was about to begin. The book consists of two parts, each divided into three chapters. Part 1 discusses the interrelations between the imperial Russian historical narrative and the newly emerging Ukrainian national paradigm. The first chapter deals with Hrushevsky’s biography and the development of his political and cultural views from his student years at the Tbilisi gymnasium until his brief tenure as leader of an independent Ukrainian state. The next two chapters discuss the interrelated process of the deconstruction of the Russian imperial narrative and the construction of the Ukrainian national one. Chapter 2 analyses the reclamation of the Ukrainian past in Hrushevsky’s historical writings. The third chapter focuses on the main principles and methods employed by Hrushevsky in constructing his national narrative of Ukrainian history. Part 2 comprises three chapters that focus on the encounter, conflict, and negotiation between the national and class-based paradigms of Russian and Ukrainian history under Bolshevik rule. Chapter 4 discusses the evolution of Hrushevsky’s political and cultural views in the 1920s and early 1930s. Chapter 5 deals with his reevaluation of the major problems of\n\n14 Unmaking Imperial Russia\n\nUkrainian history as exemplified by his treatment of the Khmelnytsky Uprising – a topic that Hrushevsky studied throughout his scholarly career, which spanned more than thirty years. Chapter 6 looks into the relations between the Russian Marxist, Ukrainian Marxist, and Ukrainian national historical narratives during the first decade of the existence of the USSR. It analyses the processes that led to the official suppression of the Ukrainian national narrative, making it exceedingly dangerous for professional historians to imagine Ukraine outside the prescribed Russia-based historiographic scheme. In the text of this book, the simplified Library of Congress system is used to transliterate Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian personal names and toponyms. This system omits the prime (’) used to transliterate the Cyrillic soft sign (\\) and, in masculine personal surnames, the final ‘6’ (thus Hrushevsky, not Hrushevs’kyi). The same system is applied in non-bibliographic references to persons and places in the endnotes. This simplified transliteration has the virtue of presenting East Slavic names to the reader in a form well adapted to standard English orthography. In the bibliography and bibliographic references in the endnotes, where the reader must be able to reconstruct Cyrillic spelling precisely from its Latin-alphabet transliteration, the full Library of Congress system (ligatures omitted) is used, and the titles of publications are given in modernized orthography. Variant spellings of authors’ names are noted in the bibliography. In endnote bibliographic references, the author’s name appears in the language of the given publication. Thus, in references to Hrushevsky’s Ukrainian-language publications, his surname appears as ‘Hrushevs’kyi,’ while the Russian form, ‘Grushevskii,’ is used with his Russian-language publications. Similarly, the historian Viacheslav Lypynsky figures as ‘Lypyns’kyi’ in endnote bibliographic references to his Ukrainian-language publications and as ‘Lipióski’ in references to his Polish-language publications. Unless otherwise noted, all translations of quoted material are mine. As mentioned in the preface, Mykhailo Hrushevsky’s magnum opus, the History of Ukraine-Rus’, is currently being translated into English by the Hrushevsky Translation Project of the Peter Jacyk Centre for Ukrainian Historical Research at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. Volumes 1, 7, and 8 have been published to date, and quotations from them appear frequently in my book. In\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nbibliographic references to the History, the author’s name appears in its simplified English form, ‘Hrushevsky,’ which is used in the series. Toponyms are transliterated from the language of the country in which they are now located. Thus, Ukrainian forms are used for geographic names in Ukraine: Kyiv, not Kiev; Kharkiv, not Kharkov; Lviv, not Lwów or Lemberg; Odesa, not Odessa; the Dnipro (not Dnieper) River, and so on. Because Ukraine did not become a united country until the twentieth century, I have capitalized the names of the various Ukrainian lands (Eastern Ukraine, Western Ukraine, and so on). The same principle applies to the capitalization of Western, Southwestern, and Northern Rus’, which were not regions of a centralized polity but developed into the three East Slavic states of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. The Julian calendar used by the Eastern Slavs until 1918 lagged behind the Gregorian calendar used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Western Europe (by ten days in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, eleven days in the eighteenth century, twelve days in the nineteenth, and thirteen days in the twentieth). Pre-1918 dates in this book are generally given in both styles, with the Gregoriancalendar date in parentheses, for example, 7 (17) April.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\nHans Kohn, a Western pioneer in the study of East European nationbuilding, maintained that East European nationalisms differed profoundly from their West European counterparts because of their orientation toward the past. ‘Nationalism in the West,’ wrote Kohn, ‘arose in an effort to build a nation in the political reality and the struggles of the present without too much sentimental regard for the past; nationalists in Central and Eastern Europe created often, out of the myths of the past and the dreams of the future, an ideal fatherland, closely linked with the past, devoid of any immediate connection with the present, and expected to become sometime a political reality.’1 Kohn’s differentiation of East and West European nationalisms was viewed with scepticism by many students of the region. One of the most prominent, Hugh Seton-Watson, flatly refused to accept the notion ‘that nationalism in eastern Europe is something different from nationalism in western Europe, that it is something essentially reactionary and harmful without the positive features that made west European nationalism, in earlier centuries, a force for progress.’2 Further research on European national movements has indeed shown that the adaptation of historical myths and the construction of glorious pasts were essential elements of nation-building projects in both parts of Europe.3 Still, what continues to give pause to students of nationalism in Europe is the role played by historians in shaping nationalist ideologies and nations themselves in the eastern part of the continent. There, unlike in Western Europe, historians not only endowed their nations with imposing traditions but also crossed the line between the writing and making of history, taking a direct hand in the construction of their nations and securing independent statehood for them. The\n\n24 Nation and Empire\n\nsymbol of the Polish uprising of 1830 and leader of the great Polish emigration in Western Europe, Joachim Lelewel, was one of the East European historians who successfully combined historical scholarship with political activism in service of a national cause.4 Two prominent Romanians, Mihail Koglniceanu, an eminent historian and Romanian foreign minister in the 1870s, and Nicolae Iorga, another great historian and president of the Romanian Council of Ministers in the 1930s, come to mind as political activists and authors of East European national histories.5 Also no stranger to historical scholarship was a professor of philosophy at Charles University in Prague and the first holder of the chair of Slavic Studies at the University of London, and subsequently the first president of Czechoslovakia, Thomas Masaryk.6 The prominence of historians in the struggle of East European nations for their independence indicates among other things the importance of the historical element in the broader undertaking of destroying empires and constructing nations in modern-day Eastern Europe. In this sense, national projects in that part of Europe were indeed different from those in the West. So was the social role of historians. In many ways, Mykhailo Hrushevsky ideally fit the profile of an East European historian-awakener of his suppressed nation. In Ukraine he merely continued the tradition of political activism established by his predecessors in the field of Ukrainian history. Mykola Kostomarov, the author of the first scholarly monograph on Ukrainian history, also wrote the first political program of the Ukrainian movement, and, as noted above, headed the clandestine Brotherhood of SS. Cyril and Methodius.7 Hrushevsky’s own professor at Kyiv University, Volodymyr Antonovych, was a leader of the Kyiv Hromada.8 No less active in politics were some of Hrushevsky’s younger colleagues, such as Dmytro Doroshenko, the author of the first survey of Ukrainian historiography (1923) and of popular histories of Ukraine published in the 1920s and 1930s, who was also a minister in the government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky (1918).9 Hrushevsky’s main ideological rival of the 1920s, Viacheslav Lypynsky, the founder of the ‘statist school’ in Ukrainian historiography, served as the Skoropadsky government’s ambassador to Austria.10 Hrushevsky was only one of many Ukrainian historians who took part in the Ukrainian national movement, but he was by far the most prominent in political importance and scholarly achievement. Hrushevsky’s life and activities well exemplify the interconnections between nation-building and historical writing in Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and are thus of particular\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n25\n\ninterest to students of the demise of empires and the rise of nationstates in that part of the world. This chapter examines Hrushevsky’s life and political activities up to the Revolution of 1917, focusing mainly on the development of his political ideas, and more specifically on the evolution of his views about the Russian-Ukrainian entanglement. The chapter follows Hrushevsky from his years at the Tbilisi gymnasium and Kyiv University through his professorship at Lviv University and involvement in the Ukrainian movement in the Habsburg and Russian empires, culminating with his role in the Revolution of 1917 and the emergence of independent Ukraine. The elements of Hrushevsky’s intellectual biography presented here provide a background for understanding the development of his historical views, which are discussed in subsequent chapters. The Shaping of a Populist In the course of his long academic and political career, Mykhailo Hrushevsky never forgot the place where he was born – the town of Kholm (CheÂm) on the Polish-Ukrainian ethnic border, a battleground of several nationalizing projects throughout the nineteenth and a good part of the twentieth century. Hrushevsky often addressed the problem of the Kholm region in his numerous articles and historical studies, claiming Ukrainian rights to that territory. Hrushevsky was born in Kholm on 17 (29) September 1866. The time and place of his birth are highly symbolic for the history of the Ukrainian national movement. Hrushevsky’s father, Serhii, like many of his compatriots, came to the former Congress Kingdom of Poland as part of the government-sponsored program to Russify the area after the Polish insurrection of 1863–4. Unexpectedly for the government, the dePolonization of Ukrainian ethnic territory helped keep the Ukrainian movement alive in the empire. Quite a few government recruits sent to the Congress Kingdom in the 1860s shared Ukrainophile sympathies. This was especially true of those who, like Serhii Hrushevsky, came to the Kholm region as teachers at the invitation of the head of the local school administration, Feofan Lebedyntsev (1828–1907), the subsequent publisher of the Ukrainophile journal Kievskaia starina (Kyivan Antiquity).11 Among the cadres recruited by Lebedyntsev to the Kholm region was one of Hrushevsky’s future literary mentors, the famous Ukrainian writer Ivan Nechui-Levytsky.12 Serhii Hrushevsky was a descendant of an Orthodox priestly family\n\n26 Nation and Empire\n\nin the Chyhyryn region on the Right Bank of the Dnipro. Thanks to multiple reprints of his textbook of Church Slavonic, he became widely known and even well-to-do. Even though he spent most of his career in the North Caucasus (the family moved there from Kholm in 1869), he was deeply attached to his Ukrainian roots and passed on his love of Ukraine and its culture to his children.13 ‘The vital attachment to the Ukrainian element that I can recall within me from a very early age must, of course, be credited entirely to my father’s legacy,’ wrote Hrushevsky in his memoirs.14 Hrushevsky’s mother, Hlafira Opokova (Opotskevych), came from a family with a strong Polish cultural bent. She was educated in Polish and Russian, although she knew and spoke Ukrainian. She was also the one who started Mykhailo’s education at home, using a Russian grammar as a textbook.15 Although the family’s link with Ukraine and its culture remained unbroken, the young Hrushevsky was growing up in a Russian linguistic and cultural environment. In 1880 Mykhailo’s parents sent him to Tbilisi (the family was then living in Vladikavkaz) to attend a classical Russian gymnasium. There he became an avid reader of Russian and Western literature. Among other authors, he read Vasilii Zhukovsky, Mikhail Lermontov, and Ivan Turgenev – his favourite Russian author at the time – as well as Byron, Emile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.16 Paradoxically at first glance, the years that Hrushevsky spent at the Tbilisi gymnasium made him more attached to his distant homeland than ever before. It was in those years that his interest in Ukraine and its history and culture took concrete form under the influence of books and articles on Ukrainian and Russian history and literature.17 The gymnasium library had no books on Ukrainian literature or history (the only exceptions were collections of popular Ukrainian songs, which Mykhailo read with deep interest), and Hrushevsky used his trips to Ukraine, which the whole family occasionally visited during summer vacations, to acquire books on Ukrainian topics; he also ordered them by mail. In his autobiography Hrushevsky specifically mentioned works of Mykola Kostomarov, Panteleimon Kulish, Apollon Skalkovsky, and Aleksandr Pypin among the books that most influenced him, as well as collections of Ukrainian folk songs published by Mykhailo Maksymovych and Amvrosii Metlynsky.18 It appears that the young student was particularly impressed by the journal Kievskaia starina, published by the members of the Kyiv Ukrainophile circle known as the Hromada. Serhii Hrushevsky sub-\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n27\n\nscribed to the journal, which began publication in 1882 under the aegis of his former director in Kholm, Feofan Lebedyntsev. Mykhailo noted in his memoirs that by acquiring the issues of the journal published in 1882 and subscribing to it in the following year, his father gave him ‘tremendous pleasure and, perhaps without anticipating it, indicated the path of my further activity.’19 What was the political and cultural orientation of Kievskaia starina, and what impact could it have had on the upbringing of a young student? In its first years, the journal published numerous articles on Ukrainian history, literature, and folklore, thereby promoting local Ukrainian patriotism and culture. Conversely, the journal was a product of the political circumstances of the 1880s, which were unfavourable to the Ukrainophile movement. As a result of restrictions imposed on Ukrainian publications by the Valuev circular of 1863 and the Ems Ukase of 1876, the journal was published in Russian. Its content also reflected a major shift in Ukrainophile activity of that period from the political sphere, as was the case in the 1870s, to the cultural one. Under pressure from the authorities, a leader of the Ukrainophile movement, Volodymyr Antonovych, professor of Russian history at Kyiv University and one of the most influential contributors to Kievskaia starina, tried to stay as far away from politically sensitive topics as possible. Lebedyntsev, the journal’s publisher, was largely responsible for its Orthodox and anti-Polish stand, as he tried to acquire a subsidy for its publication from the Holy Synod.20 Despite the anti-Polish overtones of many contributions to Kievskaia starina, the orientation of the Kyivan Ukrainian movement of the 1880s toward apolitical cultural work largely paralleled the dominant trend among Polish national activists of the day.21 After the defeat of the uprising of 1863, they declared their loyalty to the foreign states controlling Polish territory and focused on ‘organic work’ – the development of Polish culture and society in apolitical forms.22 It was only in the 1890s that the clear politicization of both the Polish and the Ukrainian national movements began, and the leaders of both camps strongly rejected the limitation of national activity to the cultural sphere. It was from this new perspective that Hrushevsky later gave an unflattering assessment of Ukrainophile activity in the 1880s. ‘Cultural work,’ he wrote in 1906, ‘developed in two directions. One, represented in part by the Kievskaia starina circle, had – I shall permit myself to express it this way – a more all-Russian character. It relegated political and social work, in a more liberal or conservative direction ... to the all-empire elements, so to speak. It was the Ukrainians’ place to build a super-\n\n28 Nation and Empire\n\nstructure over that activity in the form of studying Ukraine and preserving the tradition of the Ukrainian language and literature at least in the most modest scope – “for home use,” as the expression went – that would not arouse charges of separatism.’23 In his memoirs, written in 1918, Hrushevsky somewhat softened his assessment of the journal, noting that ‘it could be said of Kievskaia starina in its first years that “the glass from which it drank was small, but its own,” and that glass was fairly clean.’24 For all the reservations that Hrushevsky expressed in the revolutionary year 1906 about the activities and ideology of Kievskaia starina, it was the journal that turned him into a Ukrainian patriot.25 In 1883 Hrushevsky, then a seventeen-year-old student of the sixth grade at the Tbilisi gymnasium, began to keep a private diary that provides unique insight into the formation of his world view.26 As it appears from his diary, Hrushevsky’s adoption of Ukrainian identity was a conscious choice. Like other leaders of the Ukrainian movement at the time, Hrushevsky had to master a language and culture that were foreign to his milieu. Hrushevsky began his diary in Russian, but in time included more and more excerpts in Ukrainian as he tried to improve his written command of what he considered his native language. Following a long diary entry written in Ukrainian in September 1883, Hrushevsky noted in Russian: ‘Yesterday I read what I had written: my command of the language is poor. There are many words I do not know; thoughts that I cannot express with the vocabulary that I have. But what am I to do: I must practise the language as much as possible. I have already suffered great harm from the circumstance of having spent my childhood in the Caucasus, far from my homeland, among foreigners. Nevertheless, I am bound to know the Little Russian language, and, given the impossibility of studying it in practice, I must be satisfied with the few methods available to me: reading Little Russian books, synopses in the Little Russian language, and so on.’27 Hrushevsky’s reading of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s novel Die Ideale unserer Zeit in Russian translation also led him to comment on the problem of choosing a language in which to write. He believed that Masoch, the son of the Lviv police chief, was a Ukrainian by birth, and regretted that he had forgotten his native language and become a German author at a time when Ukrainians needed good writers of their own. Hrushevsky commented as follows on Masoch’s ‘choice’ to become a German writer: ‘It is clear that he has a fine knowledge of his native Galicia and could probably converse in his native language. Perhaps it was also not to his liking that his writing would not have\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n29\n\ngained such a reputation if it had been written in Ruthenian, but it would have been all the more valuable to Ukraine, and from Ukraine it would slowly have spread across the whole world.’28 Hrushevsky also regretted Nikolai Gogol’s choice of language.29 These comments in the diary reflected Hrushevsky’s own dilemma at the time. Far from his family, which was then living in Vladikavkaz, and even farther from the ancestral land that he glorified in his poems and diary entries, Hrushevsky developed a very strong attachment to Ukraine, which he viewed as his homeland.30 In the romantic dreams that he recorded in his diary, the young Hrushevsky aspired to devote his life to Ukraine and gain a place in history by serving his homeland. He wanted to be ‘the leader of a Ukrainian circle; to become, as they say, the leading fighter of all the boys who love their Ukraine.’ ‘Well,’ wrote the young Hrushevsky in his diary, ‘perhaps God will help me become leader: I shall work as much as I can to that end. And I want it very much, for these leaders will shine in history above all others.’31 From the very beginning, Hrushevsky’s romantic nationalism had strong populist overtones. He was concerned first and foremost with the plight of the people, and while he was not prepared to idealize the peasantry, he was extremely unforgiving in his assessment of its ‘exploiters,’ whether Ukrainians or foreigners. Recording his impressions of Ukraine in his diary, Hrushevsky wrote that idyllic scenes of Ukrainian life did not blind him to its negative characteristics. ‘Through the rainbow prism of my love for Ukraine,’ wrote the young student, ‘I discerned much that is unenviable – poverty, drunkenness, bowing low to the strong, strivings to abandon one’s milieu, and so on. Of course, it would be as unjust to blame the people for all that as to hold up the peasant as some kind of ideal of honesty and nobility. The general exploitation of peasant labour had a particularly unpleasant effect on me. Although the Poles, Jews, and Germans are generally foremost in that regard ... the Russian [East Slavic] “bourgeoisie” also gives the peasants no respite.’32 Hrushevsky’s thinking about the role of the native elite in the exploitation of the peasantry was clearly influenced by his reading of Ukrainian history. In his diary, Hrushevsky compared the situation of the peasantry in his own day to that under Polish rule, commenting ironically on the role played in the exploitation of the peasantry by the Cossack officer stratum. According to Hrushevsky, that stratum, ‘overflowing with patriotic feeling and cursing the Poles, tore the skin off the very same “common people” (not all did so, of course) whom it had resolved to defend, all the while considering itself\n\n30 Nation and Empire\n\nthe veritable bastion of the Ruthenian nationality.’33 This critical approach to the history of the Ukrainian elite, fully developed in the writings of many regular contributors to Kievskaia starina and picked up by the young Hrushevsky during his gymnasium years, would long dominate his historical writings. Especially important for Hrushevsky’s intellectual development were the writings of Mykola Kostomarov. Kostomarov’s idea of the betrayal of the popular masses by the elites, who first sided with the Poles, then with the Muscovites, and eventually returned to their own people under the banner of the Ukrainophile movement, would later become an important element of Hrushevsky’s own interpretation of the history of Ukraine. Following Kostomarov, Hrushevsky noted in his diary that the Ukrainian movement was not the result of an anti-Russian intrigue but evolved naturally out of elite interest in the popular language and culture.34 Hrushevsky fully accepted Kostomarov’s argument that the Ukrainian people spoke their own language, not a corrupt version of Russian. Commenting on Kostomarov’s thoughts about Ukrainian literature, Hrushevsky noted in his diary: ‘As for those who say that there can be no literature in Ukrainian, that is a lie: if a man wants to express his thoughts in his native language, he has the right to do so; hence a native literature can exist and has the right to do so. Here, it seems, one may adduce the principle that anything can exist and has the right to exist when it is needed; when it is prompted by a need.’35 Notwithstanding all the influence that Kostomarov and his ideas exerted on the young Hrushevsky, he was quite critical of Kostomarov’s federalism – an attitude that was to become more moderate with the passage of time. Upon learning of the death of Volodymyr Barvinsky, a leader of the Ukrainian movement in Galicia, Hrushevsky recounted in his diary Barvinsky’s views on the Ukrainian issue and objected to his idea of a Slavic federation. ‘But I am thinking,’ wrote the young critic of federalism, ‘how to avoid any harm to us from this “federative” model: we have already had a scent of this federation and are well aware of what it implies; we have already been with Lithuania and then with the Poles “as equal with equal and free man with free man,” and we have already seen more than enough of it. No, first we have to regain our freedom, win it back, then bring our land properly back to rights, repairing all that is amiss, and only then make all sorts of unions and “federations.”’36 There is little doubt that the young Hrushevsky’s suspicion of federalism was rooted in his distrust of the prospective future members of\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n31\n\nsuch a federation – Poland and Russia. In complete accord with the general line taken by the editors and authors of Kievskaia starina, Hrushevsky considered the period of Polish rule in Ukraine to have been the worst for the Ukrainian peasantry. Surprisingly, his attitude toward the Russians was no more favourable, and he often used derogatory terms – moskali and katsapy – when referring to them in his diary. This negative attitude toward the Russian role in Ukrainian history could not have originated with Hrushevsky’s reading of Kievskaia starina, but can easily be traced back to Taras Shevchenko and some of the writings of Mykola Kostomarov that did not appear in Kievskaia starina. Although, as Hrushevsky wrote, he was not a ‘fanatical worshipper’ of Taras Shevchenko, he admired the verses of the ‘great Taras,’ as he called him, and defended him against accusations that his works were lacking in social content.37 To Hrushevsky’s mind, the Russians were directly responsible for the persecution of Ukrainian culture and attempts to deny the existence of a distinct Ukrainian people with its own language and literature. Commenting on Mykola Petrov’s article on the history of Ukrainian literature serialized in the Istoricheskii vestnik (Historical Herald),38 Hrushevsky wrote in his diary: ‘Let them now assert – these katsapy, who have become so overbearing, and have forgotten how the Tatars and the Poles once gave it to them hot and heavy, and have become so eager to breathe down the necks of others – let them assert, I say, that there can be no Ukrainian or, better, Ruthenian people with a life of its own; that it cannot have its own literature. It is no great thing to stick a gag into a man’s mouth and say, “Look, he cannot speak: he is struggling and trying to get something out, muttering something under his breath, and that is all.” Let them just give Ukraine its freedom, and then they will see with what fine flowers Ukrainian literature will pride itself among the others.’39 During his gymnasium years Hrushevsky came under the strong influence of Russian radicalism. The reading of back issues of the journal Russkoe slovo (Russian Word), the organ of Russian radical thought, to which he gained access during one of his trips to Sestrynivka, a family estate in Ukraine, introduced him to nihilism.40 Entries in Hrushevsky’s diaries reflect the influence of the ideas of Dmitrii Pisarev, which were then extremely popular among Russian gymnasium youth. Hrushevsky’s favourite author at the time was Ivan Turgenev, and his favourite literary character was Bazarov in Turgenev’s Fathers and Sons – a ‘nihilist’ of the sort admired and popularized by Pisarev. Also close to Hrushevsky’s heart were Pisarev’s ideas about forging a new man – one\n\n32 Nation and Empire\n\nprepared to sacrifice himself for the common good.41 Hrushevsky’s attitudes to society at large were also shaped by the ideas of Petr Lavrov, whose thinking influenced generations of young intellectuals in the Russian Empire. Lavrov promoted the ideal of the ‘critically thinking individual’ (a formula employed in Hrushevsky’s diaries) and saw the intelligentsia as playing a crucial role in Russian society by educating and awakening the people. Like Lavrov, Hrushevsky believed in the special role of the intelligentsia in society and refused to idealize the popular masses.42 The young Hrushevsky graduated from the Tbilisi gymnasium an ardent supporter of the Ukrainian cause; a believer in the existence of a distinct Ukrainian people with its own language and literature and in the natural right of Ukrainian culture to develop freely. Hrushevsky saw the source of that right in the common people. Living in a society in which young people embraced populist ideas en masse, reading the nihilist Russkoe slovo as well as the loyalist and conservative but Ukrainophile Kievskaia starina, Hrushevsky had evolved into a particular type of populist. In the tradition of Ukrainian populism, he hated both foreign and native exploiters of the people. He dreamed of bringing freedom to his native Ukraine and the unification of its ethnic territory, rejecting the idea of a future federation with Russia and Poland. In his memoirs, Hrushevsky retrospectively assessed his views as follows: ‘My world view took shape in a moderate liberal direction with populist deviations and a cultural and national coloration.’43 Hrushevsky’s diaries attest that his actual views during his last years at the Tbilisi gymnasium were more radical than he was later prepared to admit. In 1886 Hrushevsky came to Kyiv and enrolled at the St Volodymyr (Vladimir) University, then a hotbed of Ukrainophilism. In Kyiv Hrushevsky met many of the authors whose works he had read in Kievskaia starina and other scholarly and literary journals. Back in 1885 he had unsuccessfully attempted to make contact with the leaders of the Ukrainian cultural community in Kyiv through his acquaintances in the North Caucasus. Now he could meet many of them in person. Hrushevsky’s university diary, which, like his previous diary of the Tbilisi years, was written with unusual openness and sincerity,44 gives us a unique insight into his spiritual life, although it has much less open discussion of issues pertaining to his interest in Ukrainian affairs. In the late 1880s and early 1890s Hrushevsky maintained close contacts with the leading members of the ‘Old’ Ukrainophile Hromada in Kyiv and\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n33\n\nsupervised the activities of the Ukrainian circle at the Orthodox seminary, but his diary is silent about these matters. Mykhailo’s father agreed to finance his son’s education in Kyiv on condition that he not join any student circles and stay away from politics. The young Hrushevsky honoured that condition for quite a long time, concentrating first and foremost on his studies. Ukrainophilism was a punishable offence, as Hrushevsky knew even during his years in Tbilisi. His grandfather Zakharii became quite upset when he saw Ukrainian books in Hrushevsky’s possession, and both Mykhailo and Serhii Hrushevsky were worried about possible consequences when they decided to order Ukrainian books by mail from the Ukrainian bookstore in Kyiv in 1882.45 Hrushevsky became even more aware of the dangers associated with the Ukrainophile movement during his years at Kyiv University. Not only his father, but also his uncle, who resided in Kyiv, warned Hrushevsky against taking part in student meetings.46 Some of his close friends at the university had problems with the police because of their Ukrainophile activities. There can be little doubt that Hrushevsky was cautious about what he wrote in his diary because he did not want to give the police the evidence they were seeking against the members of the Ukrainian movement. There was another reason why Hrushevsky’s university diaries differed from those of his gymnasium years. Clearly, the Hrushevsky who entered Kyiv University was a very different person from the one revealed in his Tbilisi diaries. During his last months at the gymnasium, he suffered a major psychological breakdown that took more than three years to overcome. The crisis was caused by the denial of a medal that Hrushevsky deserved and badly wanted to receive because fellow students had stolen questions for the matriculation exam – a traditional student prank at that time.47 Hrushevsky’s mental breakdown turned him into a very religious individual who often attended church services and was known among other students as an extremely pious Christian. Hrushevsky later referred to this stage in his life as a period of deep religiosity and explained it by psychological traits inherited from his mother, who was also extremely rigid in carrying out her religious obligations. In his memoirs Hrushevsky wrote openly about ‘a certain lack of psychic balance in my character’ and stated in that regard: ‘At every moment, at every stage of my life I must have a certain goal before me to which I must devote myself completely and without reserve, straining my energies to the utmost, to self-oblivion, and I feel normal only when I can devote myself to the attainment of that goal\n\n34 Nation and Empire\n\nwith no obstacle.’48 Eventually, Hrushevsky managed to turn this trait of his character into one of the sources of his success. Hrushevsky’s psychological crisis coincided with and probably was exacerbated by the need to make some difficult choices. One of the most fundamental was whether he should devote his life to serving God or the people, as he had dreamt of doing in his gymnasium years. It appears that by 1889 Hrushevsky had overcome his psychological problems and resolved to serve his people. The first step in that direction was to join the Ukrainophile student movement. The promise Hrushevsky gave his father not to join the student movement was effective only up to a point. With the growth of Hrushevsky’s reputation at Kyiv University as an outstanding student and potential professor, he came under increasing pressure to join clandestine Ukrainian student organizations. In the end Hrushevsky’s religious piety was put to good use by his Ukrainophile advisers, as he agreed to lead the Ukrainophile student circle at the Kyiv Theological Seminary.49 Once Hrushevsky decided to devote his life to serving his people, he had no doubt that his research would be devoted to Ukraine. That conviction made it relatively easy for him to decline recruitment efforts on the part of professors who specialized outside Ukrainian history. In December 1888, when Iulian Kulakovsky, a professor of ancient and Byzantine history, approached Hrushevsky with an offer to specialize in ancient philosophy, praising his knowledge of Greek and hinting at the possibility of a postgraduate degree, Hrushevsky responded that he was not interested. He noted in his diary: ‘I thought myself a hero, declining advantage for the sake of Ukrainianism.’50 In Kyiv, as in Tbilisi, Hrushevsky maintained a mostly negative view of the roles played by Russia and Poland in Ukrainian history. In 1888, while at Kyiv University, he published two reviews of works devoted to Slavic studies in the Lviv periodical Pravda (Truth), criticizing panSlavic tendencies coming first from Poland and then from Russia.51 Judging by another of Hrushevsky’s reviews, published in Pravda in 1892 (this time of a study of the Ukrainian nobility by Aleksandra Efimenko [Oleksandra Iefymenko]), Hrushevsky had quite a negative attitude toward historical Russia/Muscovy, which exploited conflicts between the Ukrainian masses and elites to enhance the centralization of the Russian state and curtail Ukrainian autonomy.52 When one of Hrushevsky’s acquaintances, the Russian scholar Fedor Uspensky, suggested that he was choosing his research topics out of patriotic motives, Hrushevsky recorded the comment in his diary with no indication of\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n35\n\ndisagreement.53 Nevertheless, the compatibility of his patriotism with scholarly objectivity was a question that bothered Hrushevsky. He discussed it with Nikolai Ogloblin, a Moscow historian and native of Kyiv whom Hrushevsky met repeatedly in Moscow during his visit there in February and March 1892, and noted in his diary: ‘But I am still uncertain before my conscience: am I tendentious?’54 By the time of his graduation from Kyiv University, Hrushevsky was well read in the Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish historical literature, had a good knowledge of European historiography, including writings on British, French, and German history, and possessed sufficient knowledge of ancient and modern European languages to embark on a successful scholarly career.55 Among Ukrainian historians, apart from his supervisor, Volodymyr Antonovych, Hrushevsky was especially well read in the works of Mykola Kostomarov, whose book on Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the first scholarly monograph on Ukrainian history, had impressed him the most. ‘Yesterday I spent the whole day reading Bohdan Kh[melnytsky]. It makes too strong an impression on me: sometimes I cannot read it; it is so difficult,’ noted Hrushevsky in his diary.56 Among Polish historians, Hrushevsky was clearly influenced by the works of MichaÂ Bobrzyóski, a representative of the Cracow historiographic school. He paid special attention to Bobrzyóski’s statements on the historian’s need for a broad education and on the importance of objectivity in historical research. The latter question particularly interested Hrushevsky with reference to his own Ukrainophilism. Another important question for the young student, especially given his populist upbringing and the strong populist influences among professors and students at Kyiv University, was the role of the individual in history. He read Nikolai Kareev’s study of the philosophy of history and discussed the role of the individual with his acquaintances in the Ukrainian community.57 He also read Thomas Carlyle’s famous study on the hero in history, concluding that the book had more to do with poetry than with philosophy or historical research.58 As for Hrushevsky’s views on the philosophy of history, they underwent a profound evolution from the rejection of philosophical positivism to its complete acceptance. In July 1889, reacting to a letter from a friend, he recorded in his diary his thoughts about Western education and Western influences: ‘I received a letter from S. – very sad. He writes that without European education we shall perish. I am always somewhat displeased when people go overboard in making obeisance to European education; I am afraid, as it were, that instead of what is truly\n\n36 Nation and Empire\n\ngood in that education, people will substitute the false worship of false and fickle intellect, such as positivism, etc. For there is certainly good where there appeared true humanism, freedom, the rights of the individual, and concern for the infirm, not to speak of scholarly attainments.’59 Thus, Hrushevsky accepted Western humanism and scholarship but rejected some of the more recent trends in European thought that he termed ‘positivism.’ He was to change his views on that point in very short order. As Hrushevsky’s diary attests, in his last years at Kyiv University he became well acquainted with the works of some representatives of positivist scholarship and sociology, including Henry Buckle and Thomas Malthus. He familiarized himself with European philosophy, read Hegel, knew the works of Charles Darwin, and was especially well read in European political economy, including works by Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx.60 As Omeljan Pritsak has noted in his study of Hrushevsky’s ‘historiosophy,’ his writings on Ukrainian history were profoundly shaped by positivist terminology and ideas, which found expression, inter alia, in his belief in progress and evolution.61 In that respect Hrushevsky followed his professor, Volodymyr Antonovych, who was influenced by the positivist ideas popular among Polish intellectuals of the late nineteenth century.62 Hrushevsky’s acquaintance with leading proponents of positivism among the historians of the Russian Empire – his professor at Kyiv University, Ivan Luchytsky,63 and his Moscow acquaintance Nikolai Kareev64 – attracted him to that school of thought. Later he cooperated in scholarly and political affairs with Maksym Kovalevsky, an ethnic Ukrainian and one of the most original positivist thinkers in the realm of sociology.65 It was Kovalevsky who invited Hrushevsky to teach a course on Ukrainian history at the Advanced School of Social Sciences in Paris in 1903. All the above-mentioned scholars worked in historical sociology, and Hrushevsky often considered himself a historian-sociologist, as he was influenced by the ideas of the Paris sociological school, especially the writings of Emile Durkheim and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl.66 During his years at Kyiv University, Hrushevsky developed into a scholar in his own right. He began his scholarly career under the supervision of Volodymyr Antonovych, whose article on the history of Kyiv in the first issue of Kievskaia starina had impressed him so much, and whom he already considered his teacher when he was enrolled in the gymnasium.67 It was under Antonovych’s supervision that Hrushevsky published his first scholarly works, an essay on Ukrainian castles of the\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n37\n\nsixteenth century and a history of the Kyivan Land up to the end of the fourteenth century.68 The publication of his master’s thesis on the history of the Bar starosta district in 1894 was followed by a two-volume collection, Documents of the Bar Starosta District.69 Hrushevsky’s first major study, his graduate thesis on the history of the Kyivan Land, acquainted him with the Rus’ chronicles and the rich literature on the history of Kyivan Rus’. His master’s thesis made him an expert on Rus’, Lithuanian, and Polish archival materials and introduced him to the study of major topics in Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Polish, Crimean, and Ottoman history of the early modern era. The book on the history of the Kyivan Land made Hrushevsky’s name known to broad circles of historians specializing not only in Ukrainian but also in Russian history. It was positively reviewed by Ivan Filevich70 and somewhat critically by Pavel Miliukov, who criticized Hrushevsky for an alleged lack of source analysis in his narrative and noted that he was a moderate supporter of the ‘Ukrainophile theory’ on the continuity of settlement in the Kyivan Land from the days of Kyivan Rus’ to the Lithuanian period.71 The book had a strong Ukrainian undertone indeed, as it attacked Mikhail Pogodin’s theory of the Great Russian origins of the Kyivan population during the princely era and developed the views of Mykhailo Maksymovych, Volodymyr Antonovych, and other Ukrainian scholars on the continuity of Ukrainian presence in the region.72 The study, written on a topic suggested by Antonovych, was a continuation of the work done by Antonovych’s students on the history of the particular ‘lands’ of Ukraine. Hrushevsky’s study was clearly superior in scholarly quality to the master’s theses written by Antonovych’s previous students, including Petro Holubovsky,73 Nykandr Molchanovsky,74 and Dmytro Bahalii.75 Hrushevsky’s work was awarded a gold medal by Kyiv University, brought him the recognition he was seeking in the scholarly community, and helped him apply successfully for postgraduate studies at the university. It also eventually contributed to his appointment to a teaching position at Lviv University. In the Habsburg Monarchy Despite Hrushevsky’s desperate attempts during his first years at Kyiv University to stay away from Ukrainophile organizations, he eventually became very closely associated with the leaders of the Old Hromada in Kyiv. Apart from Volodymyr Antonovych, these included such indi-\n\n38 Nation and Empire\n\nviduals as Oleksander Konysky, the editor of the Galician newspaper Pravda, who lived in Kyiv and was one of the young Hrushevsky’s closest advisers, and Vasyl Vovk-Karachevsky, whose daughter, Mariia, he wanted to marry.76 All these authoritative leaders of the Ukrainian movement predicted a great future for the young scholar, and at receptions at Vovk-Karachevsky’s house, Hrushevsky was often seated next to the most respected guests, such as Konysky and the leading Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko, who was also a member of the Old Hromada.77 Antonovych not only encouraged Hrushevsky’s research and growth as a scholar but also recommended him to others as his best student and thought that one day Hrushevsky would become as respected a scholar as he was.78 Antonovych’s support and recommendation were crucial to Hrushevsky’s appointment to the chair of history at Lviv University, which was originally offered to Antonovych himself. The appointment represented a major success for the young scholar, fresh from the master’s program, who was immediately given the rank of full professor. In the Russian universities he would have qualified at best for the dotsentura (associate professorship), obtaining tenure and promotion to full professorship only after the defence of his doctoral dissertation, as was the case with another of Antonovych’s students, Dmytro Bahalii, at Kharkiv University. Hrushevsky’s supporters in Kyiv were jubilant about the appointment. Konysky, for example, wrote to one of his correspondents on hearing the news: ‘For me personally this is an ineffably great joy! This is the moment with which the history of our national education and culture will begin.’79 Konysky’s words were prophetic indeed. In his autobiography Hrushevsky presented the background and significance of his appointment to the position at Lviv University as follows: ‘In the Ukrainian circles of Kyiv in which I moved, great importance was attached to the reform of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. Following the so-called “agreement” of the Ukrainian populists of Galicia with the government, support was expected from the Polish side for the Ukrainian cultural and educational movement. At the beginning of 1891, Professor Antonovych, having returned from a trip to Galicia, told me of the plan for a chair of Ukrainian history at Lviv University; the chair had been offered to Professor Antonovych, but he did not want to take that burden on his old shoulders and recommended me. I accepted the plan with enthusiasm, given the importance then attributed to the Galician movement in Ukrainian circles: in Galicia they hoped to create an all-Ukrainian cultural, literary, and scholarly\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n39\n\ncentre and, through the work of literati and scholars of all Ukraine and through its achievements, to break the system of proscription of the Ukrainian word and nationality in Russia, revive the national movement there, and so on.’80 The chair of Ukrainian history at Lviv University with Ukrainian as the language of instruction was the fifth Ukrainian chair at that institution (the others were in Ukrainian language and literature, civil law, criminal law, and theology),81 which had ceased to be a Germanlanguage school in 1871 and was supposed to offer instruction in the languages of the local population. Under the circumstances, that meant Ukrainian and Polish. In a few years, however, Polish academics took complete control of the university, creating a situation in which any new chair with Ukrainian as the language of instruction could be established only as a result of strong political pressure. Ukrainian populist politicians, led by Oleksander Barvinsky,82 demanded a chair of the history of the Ruthenian people (ruthenischen Volkes) but had to settle for a chair of world history with special emphasis on the history of Eastern Europe. A report of the imperial minister for religious affairs and education, Paul von Gautsch, found that ‘under prevailing conditions, there are no grounds for the exclusion of the Ruthenian population of Poland from the history of Poland, which might give rise to a conflict between the Polish and Ukrainian populations that would be harmful to the country and the monarchy.’83 In hindsight, it is quite clear that Hrushevsky’s appointment to the chair of ‘world history with special emphasis on the history of Eastern Europe’ helped make that ‘exclusion’ not only possible but obligatory, from the political viewpoint as well as the scholarly one. How did a young graduate of Kyiv University, as Hrushevsky was at the time of his appointment to the chair, manage to acquire such an important post? As Barvinsky stated in a letter to one of the Polish proponents of the ‘new era,’ Prince Adam Sapieha, both sides needed not just a professor but an experienced ‘statesman’ who could reconcile Poles and Ruthenians and serve as a contact in dealings with Ukraine. He and his colleagues saw Volodymyr Antonovych as just such a person, but the viceroy of Galicia, Count Kazimierz Badeni, and the Austrian authorities had reservations about him, treating him as a politically dangerous pan-Slav.84 Nor was Antonovych interested in the position, for which he recommended his best student, Hrushevsky. As his graduation from the master’s program became imminent and Antonovych’s Galician friends realized that they would not be able to get the master\n\n40 Nation and Empire\n\nhimself, they decided to settle for his student. Hrushevsky accepted the idea with enthusiasm and began to prepare himself for the appointment.85 He gave his formal agreement on three conditions: he would accept the appointment only at the level of full professor; he would not move to Lviv until he had defended his master’s thesis and published the documents related to it; and he would not change his religion.86 These conditions were accepted and in April 1894, even before Hrushevsky’s defence of his master’s thesis, he was appointed full professor of world history at Lviv University, effective 1 October 1894, by order of the emperor himself.87 Hrushevsky was viewed as an acceptable candidate, if not an ideal one, by all the parties involved. The Polish professors of the faculty of arts at Lviv University, where the new chair was located, were in favour of the appointment, although they expressed regret that this young and talented scholar did not know any languages other than Slavic ones. This inaccurate assessment probably reflected the fact that prior to his appointment in Lviv, Hrushevsky had published his works exclusively in Russian and Ukrainian. Count Badeni obtained information on the candidate’s political background, which was corroborated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In these reports Hrushevsky was characterized as an individual who devoted all his time to scholarship and was neither a pan-Slavist nor a radical nationalist, but gave his political allegiance to the Young Ruthenian/Ukrainian orientation.88 In other words, Hrushevsky was characterized as an adherent of the Ukrainian populists, a party that supported the ‘new era’ and thus fit the requirements. The authorities were apparently trying to avoid the appointment of a Russophile or a pan-Slav supporter of the Russophile movement – an orientation of which they suspected Antonovych. The Austrian bureaucrats assured the emperor that, once appointed, Hrushevsky would renounce his Russian citizenship.89 He never did so. But even more than the emperor, Hrushevsky was to disappoint the Polish professors at Lviv University and his own supporters among the Ukrainian populists. He came to Lviv above all as a representative of the Kyiv Ukrainophiles and embarked on his own agenda, which was not easily reconciled with the plans of the Austrian government, the Polish ruling elite, or even the leadership of the Ukrainian populists. For some of Hrushevsky’s Ukrainian backers, the surprises began with the young professor’s inaugural lecture, delivered at Lviv University on 30 September (12 October) 1894.90 He presented a view according to which the history of the popular masses served as the principal\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n41\n\ntheme of Ukrainian historical development. As Hrushevsky saw it, the economic, cultural, and spiritual life of the people was the principal subject of historical research, with the history of the state and elites removed to the periphery of the historian’s attention.91 The lecture, crafted in the best traditions of Ukrainian populism, presented the history of Rus’/Ukraine as a history of the popular masses. Its principal thesis was based on the inaugural lectures of Mykola Kostomarov at St Petersburg University in 185992 and Volodymyr Antonovych at Kyiv University in 1870.93 While it probably would not have caused any controversy among the Ukrainian public in Russian-ruled Ukraine, that was not the case in Galicia. It appears that many conservative members of the Ukrainian community were shocked by Hrushevsky’s presentation of Rus’ history as a struggle of the popular masses against their rulers, while the younger generation was eager to embrace that thesis.94 But even the students were shocked by Hrushevsky’s desire to treat them as equals and by his addressing them as ‘comrades,’ seemingly an accepted practice in Kyiv, but one that was viewed with suspicion by the politically more conservative Galicians.95 Hrushevsky came to Lviv and began to work in Ukrainian scholarly and cultural circles under the auspices of individuals like Barvinsky, who spared no effort to develop and strengthen the Ukrainian project in Galicia. This allowed Hrushevsky to get an early start in Lviv, but it took him a while to reformulate the Ukrainian project in Galicia according to his own views, and not those of his allies. An early beneficiary of the policy of political compromise with the Polish elite for the benefit of Ukrainian culture, Hrushevsky soon became disappointed with it and distanced himself from his former benefactors, such as Barvinsky, who remained loyal to the ‘new era.’ When young and still very religious, Hrushevsky met Barvinsky for the first time in Kyiv in October 1890 and was very gratified to find that Barvinsky was ‘for religion.’96 But that was also the time when Hrushevsky rejected the socialist ideals of the Protestant sects on the grounds that they undermined the Gospel. Lviv saw a very different Hrushevsky. Much later, Hrushevsky would write that intellectually and politically he had been brought up in the ‘strict tradition of radical Ukrainian populism.’97 In Galicia, that tradition fully manifested itself in Hrushevsky’s political, scholarly, and cultural activities. During his first years in Galicia, Hrushevsky sought to take a position ‘above the battle’ and avoid excessive involvement in party politics so as to draw support for his scholarly and cultural projects from all\n\n42 Nation and Empire\n\nquarters of Ukrainian society. The years 1898–9 were a major turning point with regard to Hrushevsky’s involvement in Galician politics. The ‘bloody’ Galician elections of 1897, in which the Polish administration put pressure on populist candidates who did not support the ‘new era,’ led him to break with proponents of the Polish-Ukrainian compromise. After some hesitation Hrushevsky also turned against the ‘new era,’ citing his disappointment with the behaviour of the Polish politicians, who had not kept their part of the bargain.98 He wrote in his autobiography: ‘It was still more disagreeable to learn that the hopes of favourable circumstances for Ukrainian cultural and special scholarly development, of a favourable attitude toward the Ukrainian national idea on the part of the government and the Poles with which I went to Galicia, relying on the assurances of Kyivans of the older generation who were better acquainted with Galician conditions, were based on false assurances from the Poles, who, by means of the “agreement” and at the price of certain concessions in the sphere of national culture, sought to crush any oppositional, freedom-loving movement among the Galician Ruthenians.’99 In 1898 Hrushevsky explained his opposition to the ‘new era’ in a letter to the newspaper Dilo (The Deed).100 Later he commented on it in an essay of 1910, where he explained his critique of the policy as follows: ‘It was entirely clear to anyone of sober disposition that only actual strength could give the Ukrainian movement serious achievements in the cultural sphere, as in every other aspect of Polish dominance in Galicia.’101 Hrushevsky strongly believed that the only way to acquire cultural and national rights for the Ukrainian population in Galicia was through uncompromising struggle with the Polish ruling elite. Hrushevsky’s stand on Polish-Ukrainian relations was closely linked to his populist ideas, for he saw the struggle against Polish oppression of the Ukrainian nation as a struggle against the social oppression of the Ukrainian popular masses by the Polish elite. That elite possessed the fullness of administrative and economic power in Galicia and, in Hrushevsky’s opinion, consciously strove to deprive Ukrainians of a high culture, hindering their transformation from an ethnic mass into a nation (or ‘nationality,’ as Hrushevsky called it).102 Indeed, the leaders of the Polish national movement in Galicia, especially with the rise to prominence in the 1890s of the National Democratic Party led by Roman Dmowski, aggressively pursued the Polonization of the Ukrainian peasantry, claiming that if the Ukrainians wanted to build their own nation, they would have to prove their right to do so in open confrontation with Polish society.103\n\nThe Historian as Nation-Builder\n\n43\n\nVery soon after his arrival in Galicia, Hrushevsky became interested in the activities of the Ukrainian Radical Party – a political grouping with strong socialist leanings. He was also looking for ways to bring the radicals and moderate populists together in one political party. Hrushevsky not only began to cooperate closely with the famous Ukrainian writer and poet Ivan Franko, a political radical, but also met with other leaders of the Radical Party to discuss the possibility of joining radical and populist forces.104 The time for action came in 1899, when most of the populists, dissatisfied with the ‘new era’ policy, decided to create a new party by allying themselves with a group of radicals. This resulted in the formation of the National Democratic Party, led by the"
