Zhytomyr is believed to date from the 9th century, but the first record is from 1240, when it was sacked by the Tatars.\n\nLong a major trade focus and a seat of provincial government, modern Zhytomyr became an important junction where the main rail and road routes westward from Kyiv are crossed by north-south routes. Its industries have included the processing of wood for furniture and flax for linen as well as the production of synthetic fibers. Musical instruments, notably accordions, are a specialty. Zhytomyr has agricultural and teacher-training institutes. Pop. (2001) 284,236; (2005 est.) 277,875."
