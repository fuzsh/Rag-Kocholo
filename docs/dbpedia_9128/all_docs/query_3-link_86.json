The rebels seize large portions of farmland, and begin drafting demands along the lines of abolition of provincial borders, opening of highways for trade, and self-rule by the peasants.\n\nAlthough I explained this to MP already, the peasant revolts causes are non-existent. The local lords were cruel because they had the right to buy goods first at an extremely cheap price and then sell it at an expensive one. However, this right was connected to an economic crisis caused by Ottomans. And let's not forget that Ferenc Tahy is one of local lords responsible, yet I highly doubt many Hungarians would be left in Croatia post the war. SkyGreen24(Party,quotes) 05:48, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nIf a revolt is really needed, could I at least help write it? I already have some ideas. SkyGreen24(Party,quotes) 05:55, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nCour said I should suggest a change. One possibility is a pro-Hungarian revolt led by a portion of the Garays or a revolt in Bosnia led by the remains of the members of the Bosnian church or perhaps even a revolt against the current Knyaz of Slovenia since he isn't of Slovene descent I think SkyGreen24(Party,quotes) 16:36, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nA bubonic plague outbreak in Venice kills many of its citizens, and also spreads to towns in central Italy through the city’s frequent trade with the peninsula.\n\nThe pointy tree is uninstalled from its presentation in Bavaria to be shipped off. On its way, eight citizens of Münich helping its installation are stabbed. Three die of their wounds, two die of tetanus.\n\nYemen needs the pointy tree .-. RexImperio (talk) 08:46, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe pointy tree is for nations involved in the Austrian or Hamburg Wars. Stephanus rex (talk) 16:02, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nWhat dumbass decided they needed to use sharpened swords for the tree? Kurt Cobain's Haircut (talk) 17:43, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth successfully siege the city of Novgorod, and alongside the Tsarist faction of the civil war, manage to make heavy ground against the former Novgorodian government. The republican faction soon begins combatting the foreigners. However, when it becomes clear that the invaders are not solely fighting for a republican government. Despite the coalition’s success in seizing the throne of Novgorod, rebellion continues as the new monarchy fights to secure its rule across the nation.\n\nDamascan Sultanate: Sulimen II rules as Sultan, now aging at 38. He, like his brother, promotes migration to Damascus as it now numbers 352,000. Damascus has grown huge now, and continues to as it is now the largest city in the Damascan Sultanate. The military is expanded. Antioch's population grows to 231,000.Sulimen II marries the Princess of Yemen, they have a son, named Sulimen IV.Sulimen III now is acting regent Sultan of Kurdistan at the very young age of 19. Sulimen III is wed to a noble from the Mansuriyya Sultanate. The people continue to rally toward Islam. Although most of the Sultanate sees itself as an Arabic nation, the Turks begin slowly migrating to the Tartary, as a known haven for Turks. In Kurdistan, the Turks begin to slow their chaotic behavior with the leverlocked equipped Janissaries entering the newly conquered territory. As an Arab nation now begins to enter the land with good Turk relation the people seem to be happier. Sulimen III starts implementing more of the Qu'ran into the law in Kurdistan, people begin taking a liking to it. Spices and salt are sent to the Malaccan Sultanate. Sulimen II is made the new Sultan of the UIN. We begin modernizing our guns. We receive more ships (snaphaunces) from Malacca in return for glass and textiles. We begin developing and advancing our weaponry, the old lever-lock guns are being replaced slowly with Arquebuses. Allahdrashda at the age of 10 was stabbed multiple times as well by the Spanish assassin. Allahdrashda, the second son of Sulimen I, dies. We begin building ships in the Red and Mediterranean Sea. The total census of the Damascan Sultanate has risen to 24.9 million. The two colonies, Dijakkadir and Bubuddahla, show signs of increased prosperity. We take over our land in Yemen mainly being three different city-states. The northern one near the border: Yeminda, the southern city-state Aleppraqht, and the one farthest away, Jivadier. Navy expands. We take over the Roman Empire's old colonies in Somalia and Eritrea. They were abandoned and now occupied by Damascan forces. We purchase the tip of the Yemeni sea colony from Romania for 120,000 Stavron, currency maybe changed in case of inflation. A port is still given haven to any travels and any merchants the Romanians may have. The navy is upgraded, and we begin building our ships to be more like the old Dutch model given to us by the Malaccan Sultanate. Turk relations with the Arabs begin to grow iffy in Anatolia. Turks have felt minorized in Anatolia, due to over one million being migrated to the Tartary. Due to this Ankara begins to suffer from riots. We declare war on Oman and request Yemeni and Mansuriyyan support.\n\nAnkara (vassal of the Damascan Sultanate): Turks and Arab citizens are requested to show people whom have betrayed the land and are acting as spies. The infrastructure is expanded as reparations are made on devastated neighborhoods and towns. The revolts and rebellions begin to stop.

Population growth, however, is becoming increasingly stunted by many Spaniards - even some of noble birth - immigrating to the colonies and other territories overseas. The immigration of multiple high nobles confuses the parliament and King Phillip but he allows this to continue seeing it as a way to organize troops and territories further under the Viceroy. The economy, thanks to the aggressive colonialism, continues to expand immensely and the Spanish economy becomes the most powerful in Europe passing the French economy by leaps and bounds with the massive influx of gold, silver and jewels contributing heavily regardless of many of these precious items being non-integrated into the economy and stored. The armed forces continue their push to remain the most modern and begins to build a host of new ships to replace older ones which are sold to its vassals, trade companies and other territories of the Empire. Hispania has now fully recovered her economy and having proven her military reputation once again in the war in Indonesia. Hispania begins to take more interest in her colonies as the walls of San Marcos (walls of Saint Marcus) are nearly half completed and taking shape to isolate Spain from the continent. King Phillip regardless of his alliance with france begins to distance himself from the nation militarily hoping to avoid another war of economic ruin as advised by many of his trade advisors. The Empire of Hispania officially cuts its active military strength in half with 40,000 troops left in a state of partial mobilization within Spain with the other 40,000 of various sorts garrisoned around the empire. The Empire itself also begins its second wave of investment into New Spain, New Granada, and Cape Ferdinand using funds to increase returns on cash crops and other production elements.\n\nKingdom of Italy: Italy reaches its troop amount of 30,000 with it being armed and trained by Spanish troops in tactics.

The Italian navy reaches nearly 200 ships and growing. Some Hispanicized Italians (Italians who have adopted Spanish culture) are allowed to settle in the Spanish colonies. Some smaller towns and cities in coastal Italy see the first real merging of Spanish and Italian culture. The Kingdom of Italy shows a new prominent gunmaker known as Ferdinand Auditore, a man of mixed Spanish and Italian descent. The Walls of the Alps are continued under construction to using labor from some of the economically depressed northern states in Italy recently annexed to Hispania in the war.\n\nSavoy: The economy, thanks to trade with Spain, expands moderately. The people of Savoy begin to work toward building up a trade fleet now at 120 ships. The military stands at about 10,000 and is worked on.\n\nGenoa: Genoa's armed forces reach about 12,000. These people continue to find ways to live under the Spanish empire in a more prosperous way, by establishing multiple trade companies. These companies begin to be common throughout Spanish lands as the Genoans begin to build up a trade fleet of a sizable number now at 100 ships. 15,000 troops are sent with a decent amount being mercenaries.\n\nKingdom of Lombardy: The New King Phillip (King of Spain) is installed on the throne of Lombardy as his military leadership will be needed in the kingdom and the crown is tied with the Spanish one just as the Italian crown is. With this he begins a process toward rebuilding the economy and military of the kingdom. The military is a raised force of 25,000 with many of them being pro-Spanish Hispanicized Italians which have been rapidly spreading across Italy. The population of Lombardy is at an estimated 1.5 million and counting. The Nation's economy is now in a process of integration into the Hispanian economy.\n\nModena: The nation of Modena's government is but up as the Barony of Modena and its military is improved significantly under the Spanish umbrella as they get a new slew of modern arms among other things.

Its military forces are expanded to about 5000.\n\nRavenna: Ravenna now known as the Barony of Ravenna is expanded economically heavy under Spain's trade umbrella as the majority of the Italian region has come under Spain's control. The military is also expanded as the city receives arms from Spain and Italy. Its armed forces reach a size of about 6000 and the military is drilled in Spanish tactics.\n\nVatican City: Vatican City is re-instated as the Pope requested a small enclave of the Papacy for himself. Wielding considerable influence the current Pope seeing Spanish advances deems it the will of God and declares the Spanish rule in Italy is one of the biggest acts of peace and prosperity seen on the peninsula since the Roman empire itself. The Vatican State recruits a series of guards to protect themselves and begins the process of adding many things to the Papal palace and beginning to root out corruption in the churches of the City of Rome and many other places in Italy.\n\nKingdom of Morocco: The country continues the construction of various canals and cultivates trees farther inland to help increase arable farmland. The Moroccan economy continues to expand with greater trade coming from Spain and the Canaries all the way down to Capo Verde increasing the relative wealth. The Kingdom, with many canals having been completed, has vastly expanded its farmland among other things. Morocco's total population is 1.8 million with Christianity becoming dominant in the area. The Moroccan Assassins Guild forms and spreads keeping the peace and killing the corrupt as well as making Morocco much more peaceful for Spain. The Moroccan navy increases to nearly 130 ships. Morocco's economy continues to boom as the major canal projects have turned some of Morocco's harshest areas into incredibly useful farmland and for the first time in recorded history the area is covered in green farmland, trees and grasses.\n\nKongo: The Kingdom begins to work toward a trade and production economy focusing on helping provide resources for Castile's burgeoning West African trade network.

The Kingdom of the Kongo in an attempt to increase economic output and trade begins to export a large amount of raw materials to Castile and begins to push toward heavy exploitation methods. The Kongo continues to expand its economy in order to export material to Spain, seeing a notable upswing as population and Spanish involvement helps the nation out.\n\nMapuche: The Mapuche people begin to see the first mixed children between Spanish and Mapuche people. The Spanish institute the Ecomienda system. However, the Spanish governor, in order to keep control of the people, orders the Spanish heads of the system to treat the natives fairly in order to prevent mass deaths from overworking and resentment. Spanish farming techniques have definitely prevented starvation as the Mapuche continue to expand toward the coast building a road to connect it all. The Spanish governor, also using the local Mapuche as scouts, is able to expand much more than the Buenos Aires colony and uses this to his advantage to secure more land to be able to turn over to Spanish settlers. The royal governor ramps up expansion for some of the new plantation owners setting up expanding the the territory by 2500 sq km. The population of the Mapuche people is lowly put at about 15,000 with about 40,000 Spanish settlers living within the borders. The sharp increase in Mapuche is purely built out of many Mapuche starting to come back in order to live in peace under the Hesperian leagues mandates.\n\nMorelia: The military and economy of the Maya under Spain is developed and roads are upgraded to Spanish standards. The Spanish begin to sponsor settlers in Morelia to begin expanding on the continent down the coast. (2500 sq km). The Island of Cuba is cultivated for sugar as Spain begins looking for more trade income rather than just total income from gold. The Captaincy of Morelia is said to have a population of nearly 800,000 with many natives surviving due to mass conversions being taken place done by priests of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).\n\nAztecs: Spanish continue their Ecomienda system from the Mapuche in the south to the Aztec areas to extract gold and silver. Along with this many of the remaining Aztec people become infected decreasing the population further. The economy of the Aztecs becomes entirely reliant on the Spanish Empire and the military remains non-existent with areas being occupied by Zapotec and remaining Spanish forces. However, its garrison is made up of Spanish forces who are settling the territory. Almost 50,000 Spaniards live in the Aztec nation. The Aztecs expand by 2500 sq km.\n\nMission of Galicia: Set up by a few opportunistic Spaniards the Mission of New Galicia is set up in the diorganized Colorado Territories using newly subjugated natives as a base for this (this is a vassal set up out of the disorganized Colorado Territory). Many of the Coloradans are happy for some semblance of organization and the mission is set up to expand through the well known Colorado Territories for trade supplies, or to come across settlements with which to trade. The Republic immediately begins to expand through the territory seeking for trade goods (50 px) This Mission (a church for the sole purpose of converting) is more or less turned into a small town with the Church at the center but with many heavily armed Spanish guarding the fort's walls and keeping the surrounding territory around.\n\nKingdom of Venezia: The businessmen and high level economists, bankers and multiple other fully knowledgeable individuals of Venezia remaining after the war go on a trip to Spain's vibrant trade cities and after careful negotiations many of these men take over one of Spain's newest rising trade companies, the Buenos Aires trade company, with some offices based out of the Buenos Aires colony in Hesperia. The Venezians, unable to select a king from their remaining nobles, delegate to the Queen of Spain (Castile and Aragon) who chooses a man named Antonio Lo Grato to rule as Prince of Venice in place of the Queen of Spain. A well acclaimed and respected man, he immediately enacts reforms. The Venezian economy with access to the Spanish economy begins to recover and for the first time in years due to this. The Venezians begins its long road to naval recovery and begins to use its vast knowledge to begin building ships not only for itself but acquires the blueprints to improve on Spanish ships to allow for sale back to the Queen. The Venezian military is also raised to a token force of about 10,000 due to its location but remains lightly armed and unable to project power or fight any unsupported offensives. The Prince of Venezia, Antonio, begins the drift toward Spanish culture. The tactics of quarantine are implemented to hold off more Bubonic plague. its estimated that nearly 2000 people are killed during the outbreak.\n\nViceroyalty of New Spain: The Viceroyalty of New Spain is established with a massive amount of coastal territory secured begins to expand its major settlements seriously with Buenos Aires maintaining the most with nearly 45,000 people but stagnating as more people are settling the country side and establishign new towns and cities. The colony proper reaches nearly 550,000 in population seeing large amounts of Colonial immigration now from both Spain and Hispanicized Italians. The viceroy in order to expand the food supply of the large colony expands cattle ranching and agriculture in certain areas.. The Spanish inhabitants of the colonies form more militias under command of a Spanish officer which is trained only to fight off native attacks. The Colony specifically expands 50 px. New Spain begins an immense project to attact settlers and set up a much more organized settlement system. Viceroy Hernan Alacantra develops a council system for small colonial villages and settlements and to mirror the parliament back in Spain creates a Colonial parliament in Buenos Aires. Of many cities developing some begin to gain large populations as well with multiple cities farther north and south develop heavily.\n\nCape Ferdinand: The Cape Ferdinand colony expands its population hoping to attract more settlers. The population of Cape Ferdinand reaches 65,000 colonists. The area itself begins to show up as a trade hub. Zulu Africans in the area begin being contacted with missionaries looking to speak to these people. The expansion of colonists in the area is truly more along the lines of some Zulus who have been converted and contracted by the local colonists. This has led to Many of them being recruited as colonial troops for their very warlike tendencies and well recognized attribute of following strong and powerful leaders of which the CMA sends only these to command the Zulu troops.\n\nNew Granada: The colony of New Granada - formerly San Francisco - sees more immigration but has become a sort of hub for Colonial adminstration fleets coming through the area to trade and explore as well as a staging point for those looking to sail to the Philippines hoping to reach them via the Pacific Ocean. The colony itself expands by 25 px. The colony's population expands to around 15,000 as the colony continues to grow in importance and the agriculture begins to take precedence - especially in the areas above the colony of San Francisco. The establishment of wineries and even terrace farming for food begins in the San Lorenzo Valley and the surrounding mountains. The wineries are considered a lucrative cash crop and the Colonists take great pride in growing them in the area.\n\nPhilippines: Spanish continue to establish majority control over the area through trade and other means. The Spanish then begin to send in a royal governor who makes plans to expand the island nation, and begins work on its economy and military to do so. Gold and silver from Spain is sent to facilitate buying materials to build up the area as the Philippines are garrisoned by mercenaries hired by Spain and nearly 300 of Spain's most well trained troops but the forces are expanded to about 5000 using locally trained soldiers or more mercenaries. The Philippines is built up as a massive trade and naval base and a fleet of Spanish ships sent from here make more trips to Central Borealia with Spain becoming the first nation to connect a trade route along the entire planet. This trip begins to gradually shift toward New Granada. The Colony itself. The Philippines lower their expansion (now 20 px) per Spanish order as the potential for hostile natives and other threats in the area has led to a switch in policy as well as the movement of nearly 2000 Spaniards and a fleet of nearly 20 warships to the area preventing any force from attacking unless they beat the Spanish by sea. Philippines requests Spain to aid their forces to prevent issues from arising by the Netherlands colony from falling to Muslim troops.\n\nProtectorate of Oyo: The extraction economy of the protectorate increases and the royal governor makes quotas much less demanding allowing the people to actually live somewhat rather than be in a bond of virtual slavery. The Military forces in the area are augmented with newer weaponry and are some of the most advanced troops in the region. The Protectorate exports many cash crops, metals, and precious goods to Spain.\n\nChile: The few hundred Spanish settlers who established some terraced farms and a small town expand settlements in the mountains to avoid earthquakes and other acts of God.. The area is militarily supported by the CMA located in the Inca and a force of about 2000 is used to maintain order in the area. The Chilean royal governor along with the Colonial authority begins to increase the economy of the area and is planning on a period of expansion coming up in the next few years. Chile begins its first year of expansion south heading 2500 sq km south to meet up with the Spaniards who used the Mapuche for their own expansion for Pacific ports.\n\nEast African Protectorates: The Territories are consolidated under the Colonial Administration Authority as the East African protectorates. These nations remain fully semi-autonomous under their own governments and do not answer to Madagasikara, but to Hispania and her Colonial Administration Authority. The Colonial Authority makes it a major directive in the area to keep these states happy and encourages the expanded trade of the local league to boost economy. The Protectorates each maintain about three-to-five separate small to moderately sized independent armed forces nearing a force of about 30,000 total among all the protectorates and are used for local peacekeeping, and promoting better relations among all the states. This military is also outfitted with older Spanish equipment and is trained in older but still effective tactics. With colonial Authority in place, and the Colonial Military Administration keeping the areas from devolving into a regional arms race between the protectorates the area is effectively administered as a singular entity under the Administration, with each state keeping its local culture, customs, and minor armed forces. The Colonial Military Administration does take extra care in keeping these forces loyal and small, having more to gain by serving with Spain rather than for nationalistic purposes.\n\nDo you have any idea how much I have to scroll because of your long post. Just annex a few states >_>\n\nGet over it. You can't be that lazy. -Feud\n\nPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Due to the revolts that are still occurring within Novgorod, around 6,000 extra troops are sent into the Rus’. The Nowa Wspólnota Firma have set sail to the Imperial Sea with the intent to expanding our nation’s boundaries. After several months of crossing the Atlantic Ocean that separated our two land masses, the ships soon land on an island within the Imperial Sea which has been named St Stanislaus (OTL: Guadeloupe). Around 100 settlers land and begin constructing a small settlement. By the end of the year the population grows to 150. Adomas Klimas has been awarded the position of Governor of the Polish Imperial Isles. At least two more 64 cannon galleons and three 32 gun frigates are completed. We continue to exert influence on Hungary (One Turn). Military development continues with our navy construction more vessels.\n\nEmpire of Urdustan: فضل بچت (Bacata anugraha): Continues to rebuild his acquired lands from the Third Treaty of Delhi, building Hindu mosques and Hindu cultural centers before the Islamic ones, so as to prevent overwhelming anger by the Hindus from seemingly favoring the Muslims. However, Islamic buildings and cultural centers are also being rebuilt at this time, but with less importance. Several Urdu merchants continue to sponsor gem mines in the Mogok area of Ava, due to the high concentration of gems such as rubies, sapphires, garnets and moonstones, and the first of many mines begin to return with more successes. Cash crops continue to be grown in large amounts. With our merchants traveling to Ava, Kamarumpa and Arakan regularly, Islam continues to grow in their areas. Financial loans continue to be given to Bahmani and Jaunpur. Merchants also travel exclusively to Multan, Sind, Ladakh, and Kangra. The construction of schools and universities several years ago has led to an increase in scholars and literacy in our nation. Construction of ships based upon Castilian designs, granted to us by them, continues, in order to further our efforts to explore and trade. New crops continue to enter into several plantations, opium and cannabis. With the increasing popularity of wood-block printing, works in Urdu/Hindi are created and stored in large amounts, in order to further cement the change in Urdustan. To continue the conversion of his Sultanate to an Empire, plans for statues and gardens are drawn up, to build a sort of cult of personality around the current emperor, and affirm to the people of Urdustan that he is the leader, and he is the law. Efforts to better the military continue with a mandatory rearming of the noble levies, with the Emperor offering to pay half the costs per noble, and with any noble refusing to do so, being met with increasingly less beneficial trade interaction by other nobles and foreign merchants. The Islamitization of Urdustan continues from an increase in missionary activity.\n\nRajya of Orissa (Uṛīsā kē rājya, اڑیسہ کی بادشاہی): Kalua Deva continues to listen to his advisers and bring about several reforms to his nation that make it more Islamic friendly, one of which is new, and calls for the creation of one mosque for each Hindu temple in the name of tolerance, when in reality, his advisers have prescribed this to bring about larger Islamic influence. Training of levies by Bengali advisors continues.\n\nSwargadeo of Kamarupa (Grēṭara asama kē rājya, گریٹر آسام کی بادشاہی): Now vassalized by Bengal, the Swargadeo of Ahom continues to receive extensive help in creating viable farmland. They do this by continuing a process of land reclamation in the northern part of the state, which is largely marshy and thinly populated. This process of reclamation begins by using dikes, embankments and irrigation systems. The land reclamation, having been going on for decades, is extremely successful in creating viable farmland for rice, grain and other staple crops, increasing Kamarupa's population and their yearly trade output. Training of levies by Bengali advisors continues.\n\nRayja of Vijaynagara (وجینگر کی بادشاہی, Vijayanagara kē rājya): Revassalized by Urdustan, the rebels that were removed from power are gathered up and executed by being crushed by elephants should they refuse to repent their militaristic ways and return to a more peaceful form of Hinduism. The land is distributed to Urdustan's allies in this war, and restructuring of Vijaynagar following the rebellion begins. The rebels and militaristic Hinduism is denounced as not being on par with religious teachings, and non-violent existence between Hinduism and Islam is approached by declaring that for each state mosque sponsored, there shall be a state Hindu temple. Rebuilding of the infrastructure, such as roads and ports, continues, as does reassessment of the military forces of Vijaynagara.\n\nUrdustani Diplomacy (NEEDS MOD RESPONSE PLEASE): The Urdustani Emperor wishes to take the hand in marriage of the second daughter of the Sultanate of Multan.\n\nKorea: Korea continues to build up its military.

Regular (read: not Imperial) Shinto gains a few more followers as well, mainly along the coastline in Southeastern Korea, particularly in Busan, Jejudo and Ulsan.\n\nYemeni Sultanate: Following the death of the Sultan due to his old age, his eldest son and heir to the throne; Prince Ahmad bin Usman al-Mahri bin Fadhl was declared the new Sultan. The new Sultan waa keen on developing relations with foreign states especially the Damascan Sultanate, Sultanate of Oman and the Roman Empire after Yemen had been left in isolation during the tyrannical reign of the false Prophet. The Sultan ordered the constructions of wells and transportation of food supplies to the underdeveloped areas and he, himself, arrived to comfort the people suffering. Although referred to as naive by many people of the royal family, he was considered a saint by the poor people. He ordered the construction of a major port near the Bab-el-Mandeb to be utilized by foreign states who were passing through and ordered an increase in the sale of coffee to foreign nations and tried his very best to prevent others from finding out the way to grow and make coffee. The Sultan gave orders that every male above the age of 16 would receive military training regardless of the fact as to whether he was willing to join the military or not. This move was taken so as to make sure the people of the nation are strong enough to fight if war ever started and finally, after discussion with close advisors; the Sultan proclaimed the start of a plan to develop the infrastructure to Yemen to make sure that at least 90% of the population had a home to live in. We continued to expand and develop our military by producing more firearms and cannons as well as practicing new tactics. The military was indeed much more capable of fighting in the desert than various states and the navy was developed to prevent any attempt by any foreign states to block the Bab-el-Mandeb. They imported of firearms from the Damascan Sultanate and some territory near the Bab-el-Mandeb was ceded to the Damascan Sultanate in exchange for a no war pact. Meanwhile, our economy rose due to our control over the three major islands of Pahrem (Perim), Dahlak and Sawabi which granted us a lot of control over the Bab-el-Mandeb and the navy, too, was deployed to protect the islands. We concentrated our trade mainly with Eritrea although trade with Damascus, Mansuriyya and Oman too played a huge part in our economy. Many advisors were sent to Eritrea to advise the Eritrean King on how to develop their economy and humanitarian aid was also sent to the poor although not in large amount. The Sultan Ahmed invited the Eritrean King for a visit to Sana'a. [MOD RESPONSE]. Mil and Eco Turn\n\nYemeni - Damascan Diplomacy: The Sultan offers the daughter of his young brother for marriage\n\nYemeni - Somali Diplomacy: The Yemeni Sultan requests the Somali King, as to whether he would be willing to sell enclaves at the tip of the Horn of Africa and near its border with Eritrea in exchange for receiving military as well as economic aid and the deployment of Yemeni soldiers to protect the King from any threat. The Sultan also offered to have the Somali soldiers trained by Yemen and protection from various other African states and possible admittance in the United Islamic States (UIN) [MOD RESPONSE]\n\nDamascan Sultanate Dip: Sultan Sulimen II, Sultan of the UIN would like to remind Sultan Ahmed that all admittance into the UIN must be voted on by the members of the UIN, and later then approved by the head Sultan at the time.

The colony continues expanding and growing by 700 sq km among both colonies into the Galapago Islands called Illes d'Neptune The colonies continue growing as expected. The colony of Nouvelle Rouen continues to expand eastward by 4000 sq km. The government decides to move on the Dutch reformists by allowing them to remain on the French territory, however, putting some taxes for allowing them free passage in French land. However, the French government makes clear that their beliefs are with Catholicism and that any attempt of violent expansion will be considered as an act of aggression and hence the Dutch-Wallon reformist may be persecuted. The colony in Kenya continues expanding by 300 sq km. Mining continues in the colony of Nouevelle Orleans in the area of OTL Cundinamarca in the search of the Aureana - a city made of gold - in the vicinity of several lakes. Although not finding the city lots of gold gods are found and sent to France in order to boost the economy back on its feet. Mining begins in the Pirouien mountains and the region of Equatoriale Province for gold and silver though only a few are found. The colony of Nouvelle Orleans divides in five provinces New Orleans OTL northern Colombia and Antioquia Sableville in north western Venezuela, Equatoriale in southwest Colombia and Aurienne in the central areas and Emeraldia in central eastern Colombia. After years of ignoring an important part of the treaty France decides helping Austria to rebuild initiating in the area of Tyrol and Western Austria.

Though adopting \"western farming\", the idea of \"the tribe\" is still very much so alive, as people always share the crops they have grown, or the animals they have hunted amongst the community. Due to the policy of planting tree groves, desert reclamation has started taking serious effect in some parts of |onte. This year has resulted in sixty elephants being killed. A new expansion of the elephant pen has begun. |onte's population rises to over 378,000. The city of Kunene, the city of marble, reaches almost 80,000 people. Mon IV ups his expansion north to 300 sq km (6 pixels) with the newly equipped Eheresito hu Kunene. Mon V brings books from |onte to !Xoonte as a gift, and a few gifts of ivory hoping to improve relations with their King, and spread |on culture. Mon V begins teaching the King of Zimbabwe about the many wonders of literature and |on, along with giving him many gifts. So Kuneneli offers to sell the rest of his paintings to the British. It has become the fashion, in Kunene, for men to go without the traditional loincloth, and embrace masculinity.\n\nRaigama: Begins to build up and train military for a war with the hostile nations on the island. Raigama continues trading around the island, gaining a normal income. King Samir decides to continue impoving infrastructures, walls, and build temples. Population hits 250,000. Many defensive structures are being built across Raigama.\n\nTibet: More Buddhist temples are continuing to be built. Roads are continuing to be fixed so that travelers on the silk roads can easily get to our nation. Our own version of the arquebus gun is being made. Farming is our most important industry. We continue to vassalize Nepal by sending monks into their nation. We mine resources in our caves. We ask the people of our nation if they can help increase the population.

Western weapons begin to appear in the nation from trade with the outside world. The current chief dies and the now 27 year old chief Hok'ee becomes ruler of the confederacy. Christianity becomes slowly popular in the southern Navajo regions. Also, horses coming from the Spanish controlled area see use in Colorado villages.\n\nKingdom of Croatia: Croatia focuses primarily on its military. Trade routes are strengthened after and the salt mines around Tuzla are explored as well as the salt industry in Pag and Nin. Using irrigation from the Danube, Sava, Drava, Drina, Cetina, Una, Vrbaš, Kupa, Neretva and other rivers the fields in the kingdom are developed, used for crops such as wheat, rye and barley. With trade routes increasing and Croatia entering an era of peace and of stability, the development of new trade ships is issued. Both the Ban and the King begin supporting urbanization and the spread of free cities, much to the disagreement of the Sabor. The Brothers of the Raven continue spreading their influence in Croatia. Stone mining is furthered as well as the timber industry. The need for these resources rises as urbanization carries on. The navy, under command of the King and the First Admiral is developed due to the purchase of Britannic ships which are inspected and introduced into the Royal War Navy of Croatia or HKRM (Hrvatska Kraljevska Ratna Mornarica). Iron ores in Dugopolje, Zenice and alas the 'mud' ore in Vojvodina and eastern Slavonia are to be exploited alongside the silver and copper ores more frequent and of better quality than the iron ores. The exploitation of iron ores in the Lika and Gorski kotar areas continues. The peasant revolt is quickly extinguished due to the fact that the peasants do not actually have a reason to revolt since the cruel treatment of local lords which was thought to be caused by the local lords didn't happen as they didn't have the pre-emption right. The revolt is extinguished in 12 days (just like in OTL) and Ambroz Matija Gubec, leader of the revolt is caught. On 15 February he was publicly tortured, being forced to wear a red-hot iron crown, cruelly dragged along the streets of the city, pinched with red-hot iron pincers, and was subsequently quartered\n\nKnyazdom of Slovenia: Ulrich also supports Croat writers in Slovenia who write in the Slovenian dialect of Croatia. Furthermore, the military is primarily developed.\n\nKnyazdom of Trst: The economy develops due to the trade power of Trst. The focus this year is on the military.\n\nKingdom of Hawaii: Mixing of populations between all of the Hawaiian islands continues to take place, and as a result old tribal divisions are being further eroded away. This now includes the Hawaiian islands of OTL Micronesia, and due to their tiny populations, the native populations are now the minority, with Hawaiians from the Home Islands making up the majority of the populations. Thanks to the capture of OTL Micronesia there are now new plentiful waters for the Kingdom to fish in. As a result of this, the Kingdom's population begins to grow exponentially, as resources start to become abundant and plentiful. However, land for hunting is still required, something which OTL Micronesia does not provide in significant enough quantities. As a result of this the Kingdom is once again called upon to expand. With the focus being on greater land area. As a result of this, Hawaiian watercraft begin to spread out south from the Home Islands and OTL Micronesia in search of land to call Hawaiian. They find the lands of Samoa and Tonga, which they bring under complete Hawaiian control. As well of this, the coastlines of OTL Fiji are brought under Hawaiian control. With Hawaiian settlers spreading to these islands, integrating with the local populaces. Quickly turning the native populations into minorities in their own lands.\n\nWaaaaaaaaaayyyyy tooo fast and Waaaaaaay too far, if we didn't let the Maori do it you can't be doing that either -Feud\n\nFrom what I gathered the Maori tried to invade Australia. I am merely bringing individuals from the same cultural group as mine under my flag. I have watercraft capable of making the journey, as well as the capability to administer the land. I don't see the issue here? -- Hailstormer (talk) 18:42, July 31, 2014 (UTC)\n\nYou have to settle it, its ungoverned territory on par with Central South America right now. You cant just roll up and start annexing all that -Feud\n\nMansurryian Sultanate: The Mosque Model, the nationwide construction of mosques, is finally finished and so is the Rebuildment Era of the Sultanate. With the Mosque's Models completion, there is a surge of support for Sunni Islam and thus nearly all of the Sultanate's people are Sunnis. Another positive thing emerges from the completion of the Mosque Model as well, such as an infrastructure boom. Under the Mosque Model, the mosques become the centers of new towns (being the centers of new towns, they are also the centers of art, education, science, and culture and thus new towns emerged organically. With the new towns emerging, roads were also constructed between these towns, which finally connected to Baghdad. As a result of the infrastructure boom, there is also an economic boom as well as a result of the thriving of internal trade. With all this accumulation of positive things, (surges of support for Sunni Islam, infrastructure, economic, cultural, and science booms) there is ultimately a surge of support for the Sultan, and thus a Grand Parade is held in the center of Baghdad. With domestic infrastructure and internal trade established and new money flowing in, we seek to open ourselves to the world once again, so we decide to work on our economy and vassalizes Oman (Turn One of Ten) in order to gain control of the Gulf. We also seek to open up relations with Urdistan and the Tartary, offering them trade agreements.\n\nSouthern Persia: The Mosque Model, the nationwide construction of mosques, is finally finished. With the Mosque's Models completion, there is a surge of support for Sunni Islam and thus nearly all of Southern Persia's people are Sunnis. Many ethnic Safavids and Shias are also successfully pushed out of Southern Persia with the majority being in and around the Holy City of Qom. Another positive thing emerges from the completion of the Mosque Model as well, such as an infrastructure boom. Under the Mosque Model, the mosques become the centers of new towns (being the centers of new towns, they are also the centers of art, education, science, and culture and thus new towns emerged organicly. With the new towns emerging, roads were also constructed between these towns, which finally connected to Baghdad. As a result of the infrastructure boom, there is also an economic boom as well as a result of the thriving of internal trade. With all this accumulation of positve things, (surges of support for Sunni Islam, infrastructure, economic, cultural, and science booms) there is ultimately a surge of support for the Governor, and thus a Grand Parade is held in the center of Isfahan. With all this money flowing in, we are able to use this money to further build up the economy. There is also a population boom of ethnic Mansuryians and Sunnis, making the Settlement Program established by the Governor to be successful.\n\nDamascan Sultanate Dip: We request your military assistance with Oman.\n\nMany more merchants go to Pskov, who gives them more opportunities than the failing Novgorod. The money some people even brought back some riches from Novgorod, and many of the republican rebels and their families move to Pskov in unprecedented numbers, and people for fear of their life move to the city and whatnot. Pskov continues to work toward scientific progress. The island of OTL Puerto Rico, named Novostrovsk (New Ostrov), and people start becoming fascinated by sugarcane, trading it with the locals and shipping it back to Pskov to sell, gains its first small settlement of Pskovians interested in trading with the locals. IN any case, the Veche votes that a national census must take place once every 20 years after 1580 (i.e. in 1600, 1620, 1640, etc ...) with the only exception being 1590. The Veche also votes that beginning on January 1st of the year of census, until December 31st of the next year, nobody is allowed to change their place of residence, in order to easier census the population (although this will do nothing about \"unofficial\" changes of address). an estimated 50,000 people have fled to Pskov during the war in Novgorod (mostly rebels and their families that have lost all hope of a republican government), with more people fleeing persecution by the Muscovites every day. In any case, Pskov uses this as a means to fortify its defences, and increases the permanant retinue of soldiers to about 10,000 people in the Prince's guard, each armed with rifled muskets, the old ones being sold for money. The Nizhegorodks arsenal continues to produce more ships, with better and better efficiency each year. the Pskovian navy continues to grow and grow, improving its naval defences. Astronomy becomes very popular in the Academy of Sciences, with more and more people coming to the University to learn the subject.\n\nCounty of Oldenburg: The military is expanded. Particular attention is given to the oft-maligned Landwehr militia. Officers are given proper training, and work begins on a standardised dress code for the landwehr. It is decided that landwehr soldiers will wear a dark blue doublet with helmet. Unlike the regular army though, these clothes will not be provided by the state, but by the individual soldier. They also train with the regular army during summer. The OHG sends an exploratory expedition to Neu Juist (OTL Newfoundland) to scout out potential colony locations. They decide on the \"Grand Peninsula\" (OTL Avalon Peninsula).\n\nPrince-Bishopric of Osnabruck: Committed festival-goers are now almost able to recite the Fairy King with the actors; a funny sight when half the audience is intoxicated. Many people attend the play festival for the drinking atmosphere rather than the plays (which, being written by university students, can be of dubious quality), but the student-actors feel like stars, which is all they want. The Prince-Bishop is very glad not only for the annual free entertainment but also for the interest in his Bishopric that it is creating.\n\nThe Consulate of Romania: Vladimir, now 51, resumes growing the economy and making the military stronger. The economy suddenly rebounds this year as profits from the colony stimulate unheard of growth. The policies of the last few years are abandoned as the evidence of strong growth mounts. The sudden upswing of last year continues, comparatively vast wealth begins to enter Romania. This causes a huge boom in land cultivation as wealthy persons are able to purchase vast estates that produce huge surpluses of food. The population begins to grow at an extremely rapid pace due to the sudden depression in food prices. Constanta Fabrică de Tun, continues developing its cannons, a new design is tested, where a Culverini is mounted on significantly larger wheels. this allows for better mobility, but makes it more dangerous to fire the cannon. The cannons produced and developed at the factory begin to make the company quite rich and powerful. The company begins to develop a new form of cannons, the Culverini. The new guns are tested on a Sunbeci, and prove to be exceptionally accurate for naval guns. However, the large Culverini are too heavy for the smaller Sunbeci. More work must be done to refine the cannons, but they are developing well. A redesigned Culverini, the Mic-Culverini is tested on a Sunbeci. The test is extremely positive as the redesigned cannons are smaller and much more portable than the full size Culverini. The army begins to begin drilling with rotating ranks and pikes begin to be phased out by Leverlocks. More disputes occur in the senate. Aside from the politicking of the capital much work is put into strengthening bonds with Transylvania, and thousands of Romanians travel to the new province. Pressure from Catholics in Transylvania begins to mount, as religious diversity leads to some conflict. Dan Drăculești, now 16, begins learning of courts, he begins to shadow his father as he manages the nation's resources.\n\nThe Consulate of Bulgaria: Thousands of Romanians move into the country, seeking cheap and productive land. Meanwhile, intermarriage becomes very common. Bulgarians also begin to migrate to trade towns in Romania to seek more economic opportunities. The economy grows as many larger farms and mills open. The military is improved this year, the Bulgarian Legion drills and the soldiers become more professional, the tactics implemented in Romania begin to be taken up as well. .\n\nKiev: The military becomes more professional, and officers arrive from Romania to train the soldiers. The economy grows more this year as much farmland becomes cultivated after years of disuse.\n\nRomanian Somalia: Trade with India continues, and the cities of Bosaso and Qandala grow slowly. The economy of Mogadishu continues to grow and it expands northward by 100 sq km (2 pixels).\n\nVorlayacor: Logging and agriculture continue to fuel growth in the northwest provinces while shipping and manufacturing comprise most of the economy on the coast. Roads are heavily upgraded and expanded this year, allowing for increased trade and faster deployment of troops.\n\nAustria: This turn in both our nation and the nations of Bohemia, Luxembourg, Austrian Switzerland, Lusatia, and our colonial territories and possessions is dedicated to military. We train and expand our military using new experience from recent wars, and grow our nation economically. In Morocco our position in Melilla is fortified. All fortifications around the region are rebuilt and manned by stationed guards in case of an attack. To protect Melilla the construction of a fortress outside the city is considered, although postponed for now. The port of Melilla is rebuilt to begin operation as a trade port and military outpost. Construction continues on a shipyard in the Melilla port to facilitate the construction and repair of friendly ships. Melilla is granted a permanent naval garrison in the city’s port, to respond to dangers in the area and to support the small garrison on land which mans the fortifications. Our position in Morocco is fortified by re-inforcements, bringing Melilla operational against attacks. For now a small fleet is stationed in its harbor, while its garrison continues to hold the north and its supply lines, supporting our Christian brethren. With much of the Muslim population of Melilla left dead after the war against Morocco, the local government attempts to entice settlers by offering large quantities of land to Christian settlers. Many Europeans, particularly of German descent and/or from central Europe begin settling the area around Melilla. With finances from Augsburg-based banking establishments, the Trieste Company continues to launch expeditions to West Africa. Several ships begin construction in Trieste, Melilla, Venice, and other ports, to further facilitate and protect overseas trade. Trade is increased with the Grand Duchy of Bavaria and other trade partners, bringing about new avenues of trade and commerce. Expeditions to the New World continue to increase trade with our possessions, establishing a trade route between Westenland, Reichland, and the West Indies. Trade posts in the Caribbean are expanded and grow as they become more frequently visited. Neu Bruchhausen and Dominisburg continues to expand. We ask to buy back the territory of Kluftland from Hispania, and also offer a potential military alliance to ensure the safe transfer of the territory and to ensure our mutual defense in the future. Military from the time of our union with Spain continues to be reformed and upgraded, forming the tercio, an infantry formation made up of pikemen, swordsmen and arquebusiers in a mutually supportive formation. Each tercio is standardized at 3000 soldiers, and drilled to be proficient in combat.\n\nRoman Empire: The various loans and increased trade does much to help out the Empire's economy, and slowly the Empire recovers, although the process is not yet complete. Trade in new areas in India and Africa increase the revenue of the Empire, while the colonies continue to generate a healthy profit from sales of cash crops. The region of Malabar is also particularly wealthy, for while it is only an enclave, it is a regional trade center as well as an exporter of rubber and black pepper. In the same area, Roman troops and supplies take part in the war in India, although the Empire does not commit to a full declaration of war. A fleet of ships also takes part, attacking Indian vessels. Local militias and mercs also take part supporting the Urdus. As part of the Indian war, the Maldives are occupied to provide a larger staging ground In the war. A ship sails south to the Chagos islands and also secures their nominal loyalty to the Roman state. Cyrencaica, more and more Berbers convert to Christianity, although the process remains a slow one. Those that do are rewarded with slightly lower taxes as well as better chances for government favors. In Phoenicia, the region has become stable enough for it to be elevated to that of an Archonate, and a Grand Prince of Phoenicia is crowned.\n\nRagusa: Ships continue to trade far and wide and bring much wealth to the republic.\n\nSerbia: More and more nobles become Roman citizens, and some even begin suggesting that the region join the Empire as Montenegro and Albania have in years past.\n\nYamasee: The colony continues to expand north and inland by 20 pixels each as the war with Hamburg ends and the colony of New Hamburg is dissolved. Most of the Germans there are steadily deported, although those that remain are mainly those that were not from Hamburg. The Roman military garrison there is deployed to maintain order while others immigrate in. Cash crops continue to be grown, namely cotton.\n\nRoanoke: The colony expands inland by 10 pixels and south by 10 pixels. Cash crops continue to be grown, namely rice, tobacco, cotton, hemp, and indigo.\n\nPowhatan: The colony continues to expand east by 20 pixels to help secure the region. More colonists travel there as the cash crop boom continues, namely tobacco in this region.\n\nGrand Duchy of Moscow: This turn in Moscow and all vassals is officially dedicated to military. We begin recovering from the war and rebuild our nation’s infrastructure and defenses. Surprised by the sudden betrayal we faced by our neighbors, we put aside resources for new fortifications and an undated military. Ship production continues, as does trade along our many trade routes. With the war in Novgorod over, we continue fighting against rebel organizations to secure the territory.\n\nVologda: This turn is officially dedicated to military. Trade between Moscow, Prussia and other nations helps to amass wealth, which is partially used to finance infrastructural projects and military fortifications.\n\nVolhynia: This turn is officially dedicated to military. Trade between Moscow, Prussia and other nations helps to amass wealth, which is partially used to finance infrastructural projects and military fortifications.\n\nNovgorod: This turn is officially dedicated to military. Trade between Moscow, Prussia and other nations helps to amass wealth, which is partially used to finance infrastructural projects and military fortifications.\n\nDai Viet: This turn is officially dedicated to military expansion. The nation of Dai Viet begins expanding its military to protect the nation against any foreign attack. The government begins an active role in equipping some units, using its funds to ensure that the entirety of the militia is equipped with pikes and swords. Crossbows also begin to be used in select units, who are trained to be most effective during cavalry charges and to provide support for our infantry. Gunpowder based weapons also become common in our nation and certain regiments begin training with the new devices. Government forces are called and put to the test securing our southern border, garrisoning in recently acquired territory. Alongside expanding ground forces, the government also sees to need to expand naval forces, a process that began several decades ago. Small ships capable of longer journeys are constructed in major port cities, and cities in the south along the coast are expanded to facilitate naval activity on par with our northern cities. Trade ships are attracted to our major ports from nearby nations. Facilities are upgraded to better facilitate trade. With several dozen small trade ships and warships under the command of the government vassals, and several ships under its personal command, the government orders a series of operations in the east waters of the nation, hoping to root out pirates and protect trade routes. As a test of our navy, our largest warships, equipped with cannons and other weapons, make several expeditions around the Biển Đông (South China Sea). Several more trade posts are established in the Philippines. We also make several expeditions to the Riau Islands, where we come into contact with the Orang laut people. Settlements on the Riau Islands grow as more people begin to settle them. After several years of expanding and trading in the region, the city of Ranai in the Natuna Islands grows to become a regional trade center and port city.\n\nKingdom of Bavaria: In 1580, Bavaria expands its economy. The population continues to rise. Queen Catherine and her council continue to allow the training of new troops. Several modern warships and trade vessels begin construction at Bremen Port. The Curia Bavaria order the Bavarian Army to be outfitted in modern uniform and to hold modern weaponry. Snaphaunce rifles make their introduction in Bavaria. In diplomatic news, Bavaria maintains alliances with Hispania, Britannia, France, The Netherlands, and Scandinavia. Bavaria has royal ties with Austria, Hamburg, Hispania, Britannia, France, The Netherlands, Scandinavia, Italy, and Venice, and a future union with Hesse and currently a dynastic union with the Palatinate. In religious news, around 76% of the country adheres to the Western Church. Most adherents live around Munchen and Landshut. In political news, the Curia Bavaria continue to implement the Bavarian Commands and Collegiate Writs into a codified, national law. In domestic news, Catherine continues to attempt propagation of the Bavarian dialect of German. So far, there has been an uptick of 10% of Bavaro-Germany secondary speakers in Saxony and Wurzburg. In colonial news, Neu Bayern 150 sq km up the coast of Wilhelmsbaum, 50 sq km around the southern tip, and a final 50 sq km around the previously settled bay area of mainland Borealia. A settlement is founded there (basically OTL Seattle). However, the settlement is not likely to expand east or westward, with the BBC knowing that the Hispanian monarchy has claimed much of the area. Edmund von Jülich is proclaimed to be the new Viceroy of Neu Bayern. In other news, Bremen is annexed into Bavaria but kept as a separate administrative area than Bremen Port.\n\nGrand Duchy of Landshut: Trausnitz continues to be the national capital. The Curia Bavaria continue to operate. Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nGrand Duchy of Munchen: By 1580, the total class of Queen Isabell University amounts to about 5000 men. Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. The Collegiate Writs begin to draw more men to college.\n\nDuchy of Straubing: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nDuchy of Ingolstadt: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nCounty Burgau: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nCounty of Nurnburg: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. The Nurnburg Incident continues to remain in memory, having put the country into a startled stupor for the majority of 1561.\n\nCounty of Burggrafschaft: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nCounty of Bamberg: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nCounty of Wurzburg: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders.\n\nGrand Duchy of Greater Saxony: Troops authorized by Catherine and Grand Duke Adalbert II continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. Grand Duke Adalbert II normalizes taxes in an effort to subset any rebellion.\n\nBremen Port: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. Several cogs are constructed, and plans are drafted to construct many larger ships. Several modern warships and trade vessels begin construction at Bremen Port.\n\nCounty of Swabia-Württemberg: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. Württemberg is proclaimed to be a county, with countship being retained by Queen Catherine. The Queen, acting as Countess Catherine, authorizes the teaching of Bavarian German in several Württemberger schools and colleges. Seeing as how the area has been historically called \"Swabia\" by most of its inhabitants, and by Austrian suzerains when the area was a Habsburg vassal, Queen Catherine adds the prefix of 'Swabia' to the official name of the province. Elevation to a Duchy will occur upon the death of Queen Catherine, and a Duke will be appointed.\n\nBremen: Troops authorized by Catherine continue training. Several markets are constructed as well as trade houses for European traders. Bremen is proclaimed to be a Duchy, and Queen Catherine is proclaimed as Duchess Catherine of Bremen.\n\nNeu Bayern: The colony of Neu Bayern is established in north-western Borealia, on the island of Wilhemsbaum. Katharinas-Hafen expands, reaching a population of 478 by the end of the year. Houses and shops continue to be built. The first church is built in 1578.Franznacken continues to expand. Edmund von Jülich arrives in Katharinas-Hafen in mid 1579 and finds that a house has already been built for him. Neu Bayern expands 150 sq km northward up the island, and 100 sq km eastward onto mainland Borealia (OTL Vancouver City).\n\nIn the Mississippian Confederation, Zacharie's advisers, many of whom hail from France or Rome, are decidely liberal in terms of political alignment. They favor greater freedoms for the smaller citizens of the confederate states, and begin to draft a Charter that would establish the basic laws of the Mississippian Confederation. This Charter is in favor of the older and more distinguished and capable in society, based upon méritekratos, a new philosophy that was pushed by the intellectuals of Mississippia's governing elite. Jean-Frances Desjardin dies this year, which allows the governing elite to take even more power, filling the vacuum left by Desjardin's death. Intermarriage continues as a more and more accepted policy, as the first generations of mixed-blood people come of age. The reproduction, including the breeding of faster and faster horses, continues with great success. The work on a navy continues, with canoes being built throughout the Gichigami and along the Mississippia, as well as on the off-shoot rivers. Furthermore, the census is conducted this year. In Cahokia, Émeric Desjardin continues to build the Université de Cahokia. Furthermore, construction on the Kankakee-Gichigami Canal (1589) continues. In Moundville, the release of Natchez has brought and end to expansion, and many are hopeful for future improvements in infrastructure under the current Chief. Similar hopes begin to develop in Parkin, which is done expanding. Parkin trades more and more with the French, but maintains the initial Mississippian culture. Etowah grows closer to the Roman colonies, and the increase in trade has brought about increased desire of protection by the Roman Empire, which is extremely strong. Odawa grows up to Aksimiki, and builds up defences against possible Scandinavian incursions. Santee experiences more contact with the French, also. This increased contact has caused a rupture in the Great Sioux Nation, as the largest and most profitable nation (Santee) is separated from the other five nations. Some resent among the Sioux begins to ferment against the French. Aksimiki, missionary activity is extremely high. The conversion of many to Catholicism brings about greater prosperity as better trade abilities are available to them. In Erie, construction of the Allegheny-Genesee Canal (1586), is pushed forward a year to 1585. In Natchez, the focus is shifted on creating a \"European style\" port at OTL New Orleans. Plans are in development for this ambitious plan, but many rumor of Spanish assistance. All of the Confederate States expand their militaries.\n\nMississippian Diplomacy: Due to the ever increasing interaction between our people, Great Chief Zacharie calls for an alliance of mutual trust, mutual trade, and mutual protection to be instituted with the great Roman Empire.\n\nRoman Diplomacy: We accept the alliance on the condition that the Roman's existing native allies are not threatened.\n\nThe Tartary begins to experience negative effects of the influx of Turks, as they have settled down in the chief cities and have terminantly refused to settle down. The Tatar authorities begin to incentive small communities of a few hundreds of Turks to go to Siberia and settle there, rather than the chief cities. They also begin supporting Mastoravic priests who go preach to the Turkish population, although this is maintained a secret. The economy grows at this dynamic influx of citizens (the population reaches 14 million people this year), which boosts production and trade even though the court finds a few problems. Some Turks are also drafted into the army, as the Grand Kurultay believes this would be a worthy tactic to try out, as is worked with Romanisation during the Roman Empire. Mangut Nivkhgu finally becomes a vassal of the Tartary. The road system also begins to be thoroughly expanded. Fortifications are also constructed in the Tartary's small direct borders with the rest of the world, as well as the shores of the Moskva, Dnieper, and Volga rivers, and the strips of land in southern Siberia (where northward expansion continues). With the influx of new Muslim settlers who convert to Mastoravism, the Mastoravic issue is resolved; polygamy and polyandry are considered sanctioned by the Faith. Paul Khan has his first son this year; little Alexander is christened in the construction building of the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in New Sarai, which continues construction. Virtän also has a legitimate daughter, who he names Irine. A new baby also pops up in court, as Virtän has a new bastard, Theodore.\n\nNews continue to shock the Kingdom of Parthia as more nobles claim ancient descent. If they are to be trusted (as they are to be unwittingly, given that it it likely that, due to the demographics of human growth, they all did descend from their true millenial antecessors), four out of seven Old Parthian Houses (Dahae, Karen, Mihran and Ispadhuban) have been retrieved and given lines, although the Mihrans are first and foremost in power. The road network from the Taleshi/Dahae capital of Ardabil to Gorgan in the Golestani/Karen region begins to be constructed. Fortresses in the Alborz mountain range and in the major cities of the nation, including Tehran, Beybar, Qaemshahr, Rasht, Tehran, Qazvan and Zahin, as well as the main borders of the nation. The large-scale construction work, and the great farming of the fertile lands around the coast of the Caspian Sea improve the economy. The military also grows.\n\nMangut Nivkhgu: At last wakes from a long period of isolation and slumber in 1580, as the courts of the city of Ñeƞdaqo once again experience growth. This time, however, rather than Buddhist armies of Chinese bakers, the ocurrence that intrigues the inhabitants of the city, which has now grown fairly populous, is the arrival of twenty thousand men from the Tatar court, who come to assure the loyalty of the sons of Mang Hangut. The Mangut are granted almost full autonomy, but are pressured into swearing fealty to the Tatar Khan. The Grand Kurultay in Qazan is glad to give the Nivkhs their right to expand their nation. Expansion down the coast of Sakhalin begins once again, at 3000 sq km. As poppy seeds, oranges and bananas arrive to the nation, the bakers of Ñeƞdaqo much rejoice. This expands the national population, as well as its economy. The population is quickly developed. A swarm of lemmings is displaced by the Tatar army when marching in, but the lemmings are given the right to return to the nation whenever they want.\n\nThe Khanate of Azov develops its military and its economy, as it continues growth. The population rapidly develops as great crop yields are measured this year. This leads to heavy economic development in the nation. The military also begins heavy government-sanctioned development. Mastoravism grows in the nation, becoming the absolute majority. The city of Özu-Cale becomes the largest city of the Khanate. Tatars from the nation begin moving away from the Dnieper river, toward the east bank and the Tartary itself.\n\nThe Emirate of Bukhara also continues development. The Manghit become further centred in the nation, with more members of the family being made local princes in the nation, being granted titles around major cities such as Samarkand, Tashkent, Dushanbe, Ashgabat and many others.\n\nBajkal, Khiva, Chernihiv all develop military and economy.\n\nScandinavian Empire: The economy is drastically improved by deals from Indonesian nations, namely Selebar and Majaphit. The Scandinavian Spice Company continues to grow in power. In the meantime, coffee becomes another major export from Selebar and Siak. Scandianvia sends missionaries to Siak especially, trying to get rid of the Muslims in the area. As Scandinavia's holdings in Indonesia continue to consolidate, the holdings in Borealia also increase. Scandinavia makes Vinland a prime location for shipbuilding and other activities. This activity stimulates the economy as Scandinavia works drastically to recover from the Four Year's War and the war with Austria. Rome is offered a few loans to pay for damages. Scandinavia begins vassalizing Majapahit (Turn One of Three).\n\nBrandenburg: The economy is expanded.\n\nFinland: The nation expands by 3500 sq km and expands its economy.\n\nGreater Ingria: The economy is expanded.\n\nHolstein: The economy is expanded.\n\nIceland: The economy is expanded.\n\nKarelia: The economy is expanded. Karelia expands by 3500 sq km.\n\nLubeck: The city works on rebuilding. The economy expands.\n\nPomerania: The economy expands.\n\nNew Gotland: The economy expands.\n\nSchleswig: The economy expands.\n\nSelebar: The economy expands.\n\nSiak: The economy is expanded.\n\nStrombek: Expansion down the St Lawrence river earns 2000 sq km for Strombek. The economy is improved.\n\nVinland: Vinland begins expanding to the west by 2000 sq km. The economy is expanded.\n\nNetherlands: This turn is officially dedicated to military. In the European continent the Netherlands continues to grow culturally, economically, and scientifically, as promoted by the government. The cities of Amsterdam and Brussels remain the largest cities of the lowlands and their influence over the rest of the lowlands is starting to be seen. Lowland French continues to develop along separate lines then southern French, and the language continues to be important as both French and Dutch are spoken in the upper class and French is used for diplomatic ventures. The University of Brussels continues to flourish and the city itself is recognized as the most beautiful city in the Kingdom with only The Hague, Amsterdam and Namur rivaling it. The Palace of the Orient continues to be an important cultural centre in the city and the Mirza wing is built for the Mirza family to live in should they choose to. The Dutch navy is nearly completely remodeled now with modern ships replacing older models, which are scuttled or sold to privateers and merchants. After seeing through the Treaty of Luxembourg, we ask for a military alliance with the nation of Austria to solidify our co-operation.\n\nGuiana Colony: This turn is officially dedicated to military. Settlements along the coast of Hesperia continue to grow and expand as settlers establish homes in the region. Merchants hoping to establish trade lines with the area expand the territory, establishing fortifications and private trade houses. Realizing how important trade is to the region, the Netherlands issues a decree that all major settlements must be equip with a fort capable of hindering attack by sea. Towns are also required to have a trained militia to man fortifications. It is hoped that this new initiative will cut back on piracy and raiding in the region, and ensure colonies in the New World are adequately defendable in case of war. Dutch explorers continue to explore the New Rhine and Amazon Rivers charting the lands and waters of the interior. The settlements continue to grow and prosper as more land is set aside for farming and plantations and the cities along the coastline grow as trade grows in the region. Fighting against the natives in the interior intensifies as Dutch-Wallon colonists and explorers push the frontier and establish forts along them. More slaves are sold in the New World and to the Indian states particularly to Urdistan as demand increases.\n\nBenin: This turn is officially dedicated to military.

Initially popular among some nobles and elite in the nation, following the overthrow of the dictatorship and the successful invasion of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the religion falls out of favor, with many of its initial supporters dead or forced to convert.\n\nA meteorite makes landfall in Thuringia in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nKaraman, Diyabakir Ankara ally together and revolt from the Damascan Sultanate, forming the Turkish Sultanate, for the blatant removal of Turks from Anatolia against their will and their replacement with Arabs. (Scores undoubled: Military: 6, Economy: 6, Infrastructure: 4) They raise an army of 100,000 peasants and soldiers from local lords, who pledge a united front against the Damascan Sultanate.\n\nDiyabakir, maybe would revolt, maybe. Karaman, definitely not. It was majoritly Arab already due to the Mamluks. And when I took it over begun becoming even more Arab. Definitely doesn't have enough Turks to revolt. Both of Diyabakir and Karaman are annexed into the empire. So it wouldn't be a one year revolt victory it go on for a couple years if they successfully rioted. And it wouldn't be a definite revolt. I say fine to Ankara, and I guess Diyabakir. But Karaman? No way. First of all Ankara was the only one migrating Turks. -SwankyJ\n\nI have been reading over some of my turns. I can accept the fact that Diyabakir and Ankara have ceded and unionized. But Karaman was 70% Arabic, I can show you in a map of the ethnicity in Anatolia. I have also never moved Turks out of Karaman, simply more Arabs moved in from Antioch/Ramazan. -SwankyJ\n\nDamascan Sultanate: Sulimen II rules as Sultan, now aging at 39. He, like his brother, promotes migration to Damascus as it now numbers 358,000. Damascus has grown huge now, and continues to as it is now the largest city in the Damascan Sultanate.

Sulimen III is wed to a noble from the Mansuriyya Sultanate. The people continue to rally toward Islam. Although most of the Sultanate sees itself as an Arabic nation, the Turks begin slowly migrating to the Tartary, as a known haven for Turks. In Kurdistan, the Turks begin to slow their chaotic behavior with the leverlocked equipped Janissaries entering the newly conquered territory. As an Arab nation now begins to enter the land with good Turk relation the people seem to be happier. Sulimen III starts implementing more of the Qu'ran into the law in Kurdistan, people begin taking a liking to it. Spices and salt are sent to the Malaccan Sultanate. Sulimen II is made the new Sultan of the UIN. We begin modernizing our guns. We receive more ships (snaphaunces) from Malacca in return for glass and textiles. We begin developing and advancing our weaponry, the old lever-lock guns are being replaced slowly with Arquebuses. Allahdrashda at the age of 10 was stabbed multiple times as well by the Spanish assassin. Allahdrashda, the second son of Sulimen I, dies. We begin building ships in the Red and Mediterranean Sea. The total census of the Damascan Sultanate has risen to 24.9 million. Navy expands. We purchase the tip of the Yemeni seaport from Romania for 120,000 Stavron, currency maybe changed in case of inflation. A port is still given haven to any travels and any merchants the Romanians may have. The navy is upgraded, and we begin building our ships to be more like the old Dutch model given to us by the Malaccan Sultanate. Turk relations with the Arabs begin to grow iffy in Anatolia. Turks have felt minorized in Anatolia, due to over one million being migrated to the Tartary. Due to this Ankara begins to suffer from riots. The war is halted with Oman. We declare war on the Turkish Sultanate. Request aid from: The Tartary, Urudstan, Mansuriyya, and Yemen.\n\nAzerbaijan (vassal of the Damascan Sultanate): The northern land is given to the Tartary, due to their good relations and acceptance and tolerance of Islam.

As the city has fully been repaired, the military is expanded training Muslim militias. Sultan Sulimen II, leader of the Damascan Sultanate, announces that Jerusalem will continue to be a unified city for all religions, and all are welcome to use the city for religious purposes.\n\nDijakkadir: Glass plate is shipped and moved from the Red Sea to the new established colony.

The new Sultan waa keen on developing relations with foreign states especially the Damascan Sultanate, Sultanate of Oman and the Roman Empire after Yemen had been left in isolation during the tyrannical reign of the false Prophet. The Sultan ordered the constructions of wells and transportation of food supplies to the underdeveloped areas and he, himself, arrived to comfort the people suffering. Although referred to as naive by many people of the royal family, he was considered a saint by the poor people. He ordered the construction of a major port near the Bab-el-Mandeb to be utilized by foreign states who were passing through and ordered an increase in the sale of coffee to foreign nations and tried his very best to prevent others from finding out the way to grow and make coffee. The Sultan gave orders that every male above the age of 16 would receive military training regardless of the fact as to whether he was willing to join the military or not. This move was taken so as to make sure the people of the nation are strong enough to fight if war ever started and finally, after discussion with close advisors; the Sultan proclaimed the start of a plan to develop the infrastructure to Yemen to make sure that at least 90% of the population had a home to live in. We continued to expand and develop our military by producing more firearms and cannons as well as practicing new tactics. The military was indeed much more capable of fighting in the desert than various states and the navy was developed to prevent any attempt by any foreign states to block the Bab-el-Mandeb. They imported of firearms from the Damascan Sultanate and some territory near the Bab-el-Mandeb was ceded to the Damascan Sultanate in exchange for a no war pact. Meanwhile, our economy rose due to our control over the three major islands of Pahrem (Perim), Dahlak and Sawabi which granted us a lot of control over the Bab-el-Mandeb and the navy, too, was deployed to protect the islands. We concentrated our trade mainly with Eritrea although trade with Damascus, Mansuriyya and Oman too played a huge part in our economy. Many advisors were sent to Eritrea to advise the Eritrean King on how to develop their economy and humanitarian aid was also sent to the poor although not in large amount. Our influence spread rapidly through Eritrea as many people were also sent to spread Islam in the name of Eritrea and construct mosques as well as spread Yemeni culture. The Sultan Ahmed invited the Eritrean King for a visit to Sana'a. [MOD RESPONSE]. Mil and Eco Turn.\n\nYemeni - Damascan Diplomacy: Sultan Ahmad requests Sultan Sulimen II to halt their invasion of Oman due to the revolt by the Turks at Anatolia and offers to send troops as well as coffee to be used by the UIN army.\n\nDamascan - Yemeni Diplomacy: Sultan Sulimen II agrees to a halt to the Oman invasion. The Sultan thanks Yemen for their support, and agrees that a counterattack to the this revolt will be immediate.\n\nYemeni - Somali Diplomacy: The Yemeni Sultan requests the Somali King, as to whether he would be willing to sell enclaves at the tip of the Horn of Africa and near its border with Eritrea in exchange for receiving military as well as economic aid and the deployment of Yemeni soldiers to protect the King from any threat. The Sultan also offered to have the Somali soldiers trained by Yemen and protection from various other African states and possible admittance as a candidate to become a future member of the United Islamic States (UIN). Refusal to accept the offer would result in a complete blockade which would starve the people of Somalia and its economy. [They Respond No]\n\nAyutthaya: Sorry, guys. It will take me a while to figure out my relations. We look at growing our relations to China and European colonial powers. We also focus on building stronger infrastructure and looking into military research. We begin to spread influence to Lanna and the Shan States. We are interested in trade with European nations to help build our economy.\n\n​Sukhothai: More growth in economy and investments into more farming.\n\nHispanian Dip: Hispania offers to trade with Ayutthaya but request that an enclave be bought if possible (out of the OTL Burma area)\n\nAyutthayan Dip: We accept and we are willing to offer an enclave for a reasonable price. However, we will keep strict military supervision around the area if you were to buy one. How much would you be offering?\n\nFusahito Dip: The Emperor asks whether the alliance between our nations from the early 1500s still stands.\n\nHispanian Dip: We will offer a large sum of Gold and silver for the territory (all of the OTL Burma sliver if you're willing) and in exchange will aid in any conquests against you for a period of 25-30 years.\n\nPrussia: The Prussians continue to develop their economy. Prussia continues to Germanize their ethnic minorities.\n\nCourland: The Curonians also continue developing their economy.\n\nEstland: Estland also continues developing their economy.\n\nNew Pomerania: Missionary Injuns and Germans alike spread across the nation with Bibles written in German, spreading both the word of God and the words of German. We launch ten slave raids this year, totalling 780 Injuns, 130 of which are kept and the rest sold. We continue expansion 15 px inland as we are now boxed in.\n\nPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: With the revolts in Novgorod over, 4000 troops are called back with 2000 remaining to aid Muscovite forces consolidate power. Tensions with the Republic of Pskov have risen due to the government’s support of Republican rebels within Novgorod. As punishment, we demand that Pskov may not colonize the Imperial Sea. Further talks with the General Sejm and the Privy Council suggest a declaration of war against the nation for directly attempting to begin insurrection within our ally’s boundaries. In the case the General Sejm vote for war, our military will be temporarily mobilized on our eastern border. At least two more 64 cannon galleons and three 32 gun frigates are completed. Military development continues with our navy construction more vessels. Military development continues with our navy construction more vessels.\n\nPolish Imperial Isles: We expand the island of St Stanislaus by four pixels. Local militia that have been hired from the Nowa Wspólnota Firma came in contact with several native tribes. All of which shortly died off after a month or two after coming in contact. It is believed that the tribes of the island aren’t resistant to European disease.\n\nZapoteca: The Emperor continues financing Spanish settlers to come to the kingdom and marry into the population. Trade increases and continues with the Spanish. The Emperor expands roadways connecting cities in the alliance to help merchants and soldiers move freer between them. The military, which had been outdated for many years, continues to be upgraded. The economy booms with trade as a result of the roads. Naval technology is rapidly advanced under the Spanish with an advancing fleet of 25 light and medium ships purchased from Spain. The Emperor orders more to be manufactured to bring in goods from the sea. Itzapam continues prospering under Zapotecan rule, improving their military. Zapoteca expands 50 px north with the help of Spanish explorers.\n\nKorea: Korea continues to build up its military. Meanwhile, more Taoist, Neo-Confucian and Buddhist temples are built. Taoism rises in popularity and gains more followers. Regular (read: not Imperial) Shinto gains a few more followers as well, mainly along the coastline in Southeastern Korea, particularly in Busan, Jejudo and Ulsan.\n\nHispania: The Spanish populace reaches about 14.1 million and growing thanks in large part to the inplementation of learned Incan farming methods, and the incorporation of some of the new American staple crops into Spanish diet. Population growth, however, is becoming increasingly stunted by many Spaniards - even some of noble birth - immigrating to the colonies and other territories overseas. The immigration of multiple high nobles confuses the parliament and King but allows this to continue seeing it as a way to organize troops and territories further under the Viceroy. The economy, thanks to the aggressive colonialism, continues to expand immensely and the Spanish economy becomes the most powerful in Europe passing the French economy by leaps and bounds with the massive influx of gold, silver and jewels contributing heavily regardless of many of these precious items being non-integrated into the economy and stored. The armed forces continue their push to remain the most modern and begins to build a host of new ships to replace older ones which are sold to its vassals, trade companies and other territories of the Empire. Hispania has now fully recovered her economy and having proven her military reputation once again in the war in Indonesia. Hispania begins to take more interest in her colonies as the walls of San Marcos (walls of Saint Marcus) are nearly half completed and taking shape to isolate Spain from the continent. The king, regardless of his alliance with France, begins to distance himself from the nation militarily hoping to avoid another war of economic ruin as advised by many of his trade advisors. The Empire of Hispania officially cuts its active military strength in half with 40,000 troops left in a state of partial mobilization within Spain with the other 40,000 of various sorts garrisoned around the empire. The Empire itself also begins its second wave of investment into New Spain, New Granada and Cape Ferdinand using funds to increase returns on cash crops and other production elements. Emperor of Hispania, Don Phillip de Habsburg, dies of a heart attack during the night. Don Alejandro de Habsburg is crowned as Emperor of Hispania and king over all the various personal kingdoms held and tied to the imperial crown of Hispania. The transition is extremely smooth as the Emperor holds a grand feast and a military parade in honor of his father and the military prowess of Spain and her empire.\n\nDai Viet Diplomacy: We offer a trade agreement to the nation of Hispania.\n\nHispanian Dip: We agree.\n\nKingdom of Italy: Italy reaches its troop amount of 30,000 with it being armed and trained by Spanish troops in tactics. The Italian army is expanded moderately with some naval ships being purchased to replace losses. However, the Invulnerable Spanish army discourages any from speaking their mind and most deal with the relatively benevolent rule of the Spanish. The Italian navy reaches nearly 200 ships and growing. Some Hispanicized Italians (Italians who have adopted Spanish culture) are allowed to settle in the Spanish colonies. Some smaller towns and cities in coastal Italy see the first real merging of Spanish and Italian culture. The Kingdom of Italy shows a new pr"
