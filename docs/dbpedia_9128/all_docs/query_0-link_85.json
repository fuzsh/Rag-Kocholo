        "text": "The 19th century was a period which was characterized by a strong interest in the cultural heritage, art collection, documentation of historical monuments and their protection. At the same time, tourism had developed an a so far unprecedented scale and one of the most important magnets which attracted tourists were historical cities, monuments and museums. This fusion between cultural heritage and tourism is perfectly well visible in the 19th century tourist guidebooks. The authors and publishers of these publications, including such well-known personages as Karl Baedeker and John Murray, attached great importance to the descriptions of the cultural attractions of the individual countries, cities and areas. On Polish territories, the fascination with the monuments of the past revealed itself, primarily within the framework of historical research, and also in the organization of exhibitions, compiling lists and inventories of monuments and the popularization of knowledge about the latter, among others through publications appearing in the contemporary press as well as in travel guides. The interest in the cultural heritage was strongly rooted in national history and patriotic sentiment, as in the period under discussion, Poland was deprived of its own statehood which it had lost in the aftermath of the partitions carried out in the course of the latter half of the 18th century. In the year 1801, the oldest Polish museum which was open to the public had been founded in Puławy. Its foundress, Princess Izabela Czartoryska, catalogued her own collections herself and in the year 1828, she published a book entitled Poczet pamiątek zachowanych w Domu Gotyckim w Puławach (Collection of Memorabilia Preserved in the Gothic House in Puławy). In the article, an analysis of this publication was carried out which revealed its links both with catalogues of museum collections that had arisen at a similar time, as well as with tourist guidebooks. It seems that Princess Izabela's publication, which without a doubt occupies an important place in the history of Polish museology, could have successfully fulfilled both these functions.\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/216422 Karl Ritter von Strahl (1850−1929) was the last owner of the renowned collection of paintings and art objects kept in his castle of Stara Loka (Altenlack) near Škofja Loka in Carniola. In 1929, Strahl sold 32 paintings to Stanko Senečić, an antique dealer from Nova Ves in Zagreb. In the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb, there are five paintings of hitherto unknown provenance, which undoubtedly originate from the Strahl Collection. The paper discusses the circumstances of Senečić’s purchase and the earlier provenance of the five paintings. Furthermore, different paths by which the paintings came to the museum in Zagreb are analyzed. As previous research of the interwar art market in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) has shown that Croatian private buyers and professional antique dealers visited regularly the sales of castle and manor furnishings in interwar Slovenia, we can assume that there are more art heritage items originating from Slovenia in present-day Croatian public and private collections, awaiting an analysis of their provenance.\n\nThis article is based on two lectures delivered during the symposium “Collecting Antiquities from the Middle Ages to the End of the Nineteenth Century” held at the University of Wrocław, 25–26 March, 2021. It discusses two collections related to the glyptic art housed in Krakow: a pictorial archive once owned by Philipp von Stosch including visual reproductions of his own gems as well as those from other contemporary cabinets, now in the Princes Czartoryski Museum in Krakow and the Constantine Schmidt-Ciążyński collection of engraved gems in the National Museum in Krakow. These two different sets enable us to illustrate the history of collecting intaglios and cameos, and explain why engraved gems became such a popular phenomenon among the eighteenth and nineteenth century enthusiasts of antiquity, its art and craftsmanship. In addition, Constantine Schmidt-Ciążyński’s collection of Old Masters paintings is briefly discussed as another proof of his extraordinary connoisseurship and taste."
