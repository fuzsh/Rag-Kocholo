        "text": "In this week's letter...\n\nwe have excellent news: Napoleonica les Archives is now online again, offering access to a wealth of digitised Napoleonic documents relating to the First Empire. We also have a new painting of the month, Yvon's Napoleon III handing Baron Haussmann the Decree Annexing the Parisian Suburban Communes - a painting originally rejected by its commissioners for not thoroughly glorifying this momentous event in the history of Paris. The discovery of Richard III's skeleton has been garnering a lot of media attention this week, but there's been a recent Napoleonic discovery, too: a pair of shoes belonging to Napoleon I's sister, Pauline - we've got more details and a news article about it. Then there are details of two events in Italy: a conference on Napoleonic influence in Mestre, organised by the Souvenir Napol�onien in North Italy, and an exhibition on marksmanship at the Museo Glauco Lombardi, Parma, as well as details of the London National Army Museum's search for �Britain's greatest battle', with information on how to vote and details of a conference to be held in April.\n\nOn the right hand side, as usual, we bring you a handpicked selection of publications - this week about the War of 1812, the Campaign in Italy in 1866 and a new bibliography of the Seven Weeks' War between Austria and Prussia in the same year. Don't forget to check out our seen on the web section to see an overview of Napoleonic related art in museums in the UK and an online exhibition about thePeninsular War, known in Spain as the War of Independence.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPainting of the Month\n\nNapoleon III Hands Baron Haussmann the decree Annexing the Parisian Suburban Communes, by Adolphe Yvon\n\nYvon often received official commissions, and he was asked to paint the work here, Napoleon III Hands Baron Haussmann the Decree Annexing the Parisian Suburban Communes, by the Paris municipal council, as decoration for its meeting room. However, the council judged the painting too formulaic for such a major event in the history of Paris and demanded a new one from Yvon. This second painting, which depicted the the reception of the prefect Haussmann and the municipal council by the Imperial couple with all the splendour of the court, was lost during the fire at the H�tel de Ville at the time of the commune in 1871. Thus it is the first �failed' version, presented here, which is the only surviving figurative commemoration of the extension of Paris.\n\nWhat's on\n\n1809-1813 Aquile sotto assedio (Eagles under Siege), Forte Marghera, Mestre (Italy)\n\nA series of talks, an exhibition and a reenactment focused on Napoleonic military influence in northern Italy between 1809-1813, organised by Le Souvenir Napol�onien and the Associazione Culturale Historica Memoria.\n\n150 Years of Marksmanship, Museo Glauco Lombardi, Parma (Italy)\n\nAn exhibition displaying 250 various types of muzzleloading guns and the equipment used with them, showing the development of the art of marksmanship over the course of 150 years.\n\nBritain's Greatest Battles, The National Army Museum in London (UK)\n\nThe National Army Museum are running a campaign for the public to vote for �Britain's greatest battles' from the country's long military history. You can read about the different battles, make suggestions and vote online here. As part of the campaign, there will be a series of talks on 20 April, 2013, with prominent speakers putting forward their own thoughts about which historic battle deserves the title of �greatest'."
